To solve the problem, we need to determine how many beakers Igor lost. Let's break down the information given step by step.

1. **Items Requested by Dr. Grumpus:**
   - Test tubes: 16
   - Beakers: 7
   - Petri dishes: 14

2. **Items Gathered by Igor:**
   - Test tubes: Igor gathered half as many as requested.
     \[
     \text{Test tubes gathered} = \frac{16}{2} = 8
     \]
   - Petri dishes: Igor gathered two more than the number requested.
     \[
     \text{Petri dishes gathered} = 14 + 2 = 16
     \]
   - Beakers: Igor gathered the correct number, which is 7, but he lost some on the way.

3. **Total Items on the Lab Bench:**
   Igor placed a total of 29 items on the lab bench. We can express this total in terms of the items he gathered:
   \[
   \text{Total items} = \text{Test tubes gathered} + \text{Beakers gathered} + \text{Petri dishes gathered}
   \]
   Substituting the values we have:
   \[
   29 = 8 + \text{Beakers gathered} + 16
   \]
   Simplifying this equation:
   \[
   29 = 24 + \text{Beakers gathered}
   \]
   To find the number of beakers Igor actually placed on the bench, we subtract 24 from both sides:
   \[
   \text{Beakers gathered} = 29 - 24 = 5
   \]

4. **Determining How Many Beakers Igor Lost:**
   Since Igor originally gathered 7 beakers, but only placed 5 on the bench, we can find the number of beakers he lost:
   \[
   \text{Beakers lost} = \text{Beakers gathered} - \text{Beakers placed} = 7 - 5 = 2
   \]

Thus, Igor lost **2 beakers**.

Final answer: **2**
