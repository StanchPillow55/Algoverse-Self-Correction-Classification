It seems like there is a misunderstanding with the problem statement "Sample math problem 384." This doesn't provide enough information to solve a specific math problem. However, I can create a sample math problem involving the number 384 and solve it step-by-step for you. Let's consider the following problem:

**Problem:**
Find the prime factorization of the number 384.

**Solution:**

To find the prime factorization of 384, we need to express it as a product of prime numbers. We can do this by dividing 384 by the smallest prime number and continue the process with the quotient until we reach 1.

1. **Divide by 2 (the smallest prime number):**

   \[
   384 \div 2 = 192
   \]

   So, 384 = 2 × 192.

2. **Continue dividing by 2:**

   \[
   192 \div 2 = 96
   \]

   So, 192 = 2 × 96, and thus 384 = 2 × 2 × 96.

3. **Continue dividing by 2:**

   \[
   96 \div 2 = 48
   \]

   So, 96 = 2 × 48, and thus 384 = 2 × 2 × 2 × 48.

4. **Continue dividing by 2:**

   \[
   48 \div 2 = 24
   \]

   So, 48 = 2 × 24, and thus 384 = 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 24.

5. **Continue dividing by 2:**

   \[
   24 \div 2 = 12
   \]

   So, 24 = 2 × 12, and thus 384 = 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 12.

6. **Continue dividing by 2:**

   \[
   12 \div 2 = 6
   \]

   So, 12 = 2 × 6, and thus 384 = 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 6.

7. **Continue dividing by 2:**

   \[
   6 \div 2 = 3
   \]

   So, 6 = 2 × 3, and thus 384 = 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 3.

Now, we have reached a quotient of 3, which is a prime number. Therefore, we stop here.

The prime factorization of 384 is:

\[
384 = 2^7 \times 3
\]

**Final Answer:**
The prime factorization of 384 is \(2^7 \times 3\).
