==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to understand what "Sample math problem 384" refers to. Since the problem is not explicitly stated, I'll assume it involves the number 384 in some mathematical context. Let's explore a few possibilities:

### Possibility 1: Factorization of 384
Let's factorize the number 384 into its prime factors.

1. **Divide by 2 (the smallest prime number):**
   - 384 ÷ 2 = 192
2. **Continue dividing by 2:**
   - 192 ÷ 2 = 96
   - 96 ÷ 2 = 48
   - 48 ÷ 2 = 24
   - 24 ÷ 2 = 12
   - 12 ÷ 2 = 6
   - 6 ÷ 2 = 3

3. **Now, 3 is a prime number, and we cannot divide it by 2 anymore. So, we divide by 3:**
   - 3 ÷ 3 = 1

Thus, the prime factorization of 384 is \(2^7 \times 3^1\).

### Possibility 2: Sum of Digits of 384
Let's calculate the sum of the digits of 384.

- The digits of 384 are 3, 8, and 4.
- Sum = 3 + 8 + 4 = 15

### Possibility 3: Check if 384 is a Perfect Square
To check if 384 is a perfect square, we need to find its square root and see if it is an integer.

- Calculate the square root of 384: \(\sqrt{384} \approx 19.6\)

Since 19.6 is not an integer, 384 is not a perfect square.

### Possibility 4: Divisors of 384
Let's find all the divisors of 384.

Using the prime factorization \(2^7 \times 3^1\), we can find the divisors by considering all combinations of these factors:

- The exponents of 2 can be 0 through 7.
- The exponent of 3 can be 0 or 1.

The number of divisors is \((7+1)(1+1) = 16\).

The divisors are:
1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 3, 6, 12, 24, 48, 96, 192, 384.

### Conclusion
Since the problem was not explicitly stated, I explored several mathematical aspects of the number 384. Here are the key findings:

1. **Prime Factorization:** \(2^7 \times 3^1\)
2. **Sum of Digits:** 15
3. **Not a Perfect Square**
4. **Divisors:** 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16, 24, 32, 48, 64, 96, 128, 192, 384
