==================================================

To solve the problem, we first need to understand what "Sample math problem 384" refers to. Since no specific problem is provided, I'll create a hypothetical math problem involving the number 384 and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**
Find the prime factorization of 384 and determine the number of divisors it has.

**Step 1: Prime Factorization of 384**

To find the prime factorization, we start by dividing 384 by the smallest prime number, which is 2, and continue dividing by 2 until we can no longer do so evenly.

1. \( 384 \div 2 = 192 \)
2. \( 192 \div 2 = 96 \)
3. \( 96 \div 2 = 48 \)
4. \( 48 \div 2 = 24 \)
5. \( 24 \div 2 = 12 \)
6. \( 12 \div 2 = 6 \)
7. \( 6 \div 2 = 3 \)

At this point, 3 is a prime number, and we can no longer divide by 2. So, we divide by 3:

8. \( 3 \div 3 = 1 \)

Thus, the prime factorization of 384 is:
\[ 384 = 2^7 \times 3^1 \]

**Step 2: Determine the Number of Divisors**

To find the number of divisors of a number given its prime factorization, use the formula:
\[ (e_1 + 1)(e_2 + 1) \cdots (e_n + 1) \]
where \( e_1, e_2, \ldots, e_n \) are the exponents in the prime factorization.

For 384, the prime factorization is \( 2^7 \times 3^1 \). Therefore, the number of divisors is:
\[ (7 + 1)(1 + 1) = 8 \times 2 = 16 \]

**Final Answer:**

The prime factorization of 384 is \( 2^7 \times 3^1 \), and it has 16 divisors.
