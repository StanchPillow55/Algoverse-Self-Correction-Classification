==================================================

To solve the problem, we will follow these steps:

1. **Determine the initial weight of the cow.**
   - The initial weight of John's cow is given as 400 pounds.

2. **Calculate the new weight after the cow increases its weight to 1.5 times its starting weight.**
   - To find the new weight, we multiply the initial weight by 1.5:
     \[
     \text{New Weight} = \text{Initial Weight} \times 1.5 = 400 \, \text{pounds} \times 1.5
     \]
   - Performing the multiplication:
     \[
     400 \times 1.5 = 600 \, \text{pounds}
     \]

3. **Calculate the value of the cow before and after the weight gain.**
   - The value of the cow is calculated by multiplying its weight by the price per pound.
   - The price per pound is given as $3.

   - **Value before weight gain:**
     \[
     \text{Value Before} = \text{Initial Weight} \times \text{Price per Pound} = 400 \, \text{pounds} \times 3 \, \text{dollars/pound}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Value Before} = 1200 \, \text{dollars}
     \]

   - **Value after weight gain:**
     \[
     \text{Value After} = \text{New Weight} \times \text{Price per Pound} = 600 \, \text{pounds} \times 3 \, \text{dollars/pound}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Value After} = 1800 \, \text{dollars}
     \]

4. **Calculate the increase in value after the weight gain.**
   - To find out how much more the cow is worth after gaining weight, we subtract the value before the weight gain from the value after the weight gain:
     \[
     \text{Increase in Value} = \text{Value After} - \text{Value Before} = 1800 \, \text{dollars} - 1200 \, \text{dollars}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Increase in Value} = 600 \, \text{dollars}
     \]

5. **State the final answer.**
   - The cow is worth **$600 more** after gaining the weight.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{600}
\]
