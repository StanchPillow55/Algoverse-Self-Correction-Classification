==================================================

First, we need to find out how much the cow weighs after it increased its weight by 1.5 times. 

To do this, we multiply the starting weight of the cow by 1.5:

400 pounds * 1.5 = 600 pounds

So, after gaining weight, the cow weighs 600 pounds.

Next, we need to find out how much the cow is worth after gaining the weight. 

To do this, we multiply the weight of the cow by the price per pound:

600 pounds * $3 per pound = $1800

So, after gaining weight, the cow is worth $1800.

Now, we need to find out how much the cow was worth before it gained the weight. 

To do this, we multiply the starting weight of the cow by the price per pound:

400 pounds * $3 per pound = $1200

So, before gaining weight, the cow was worth $1200.

Finally, we need to find out how much more the cow is worth after gaining the weight. 

To do this, we subtract the value of the cow before it gained weight from the value of the cow after it gained weight:

$1800 - $1200 = $600

So, the cow is worth $600 more after gaining the weight. 

Therefore, the final answer is $600.
