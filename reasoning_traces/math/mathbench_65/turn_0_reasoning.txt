==================================================

It seems like the problem statement is incomplete or unclear. "Sample math problem 65" doesn't provide enough information for me to solve a specific math problem. However, I can guide you through a general approach to solving math problems, or if you have a specific problem in mind, please provide the full details.

Here's a general approach to solving math problems:

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - Read the problem carefully.
   - Identify what is being asked.
   - Determine what information is given.

2. **Devise a Plan:**
   - Consider possible strategies to solve the problem. This could include drawing a diagram, creating an equation, or breaking the problem into smaller parts.

3. **Carry Out the Plan:**
   - Execute the steps you have planned.
   - Perform calculations carefully.
   - Keep track of units and ensure consistency.

4. **Review/Check Your Work:**
   - Verify each step of your solution.
   - Check if the answer makes sense in the context of the problem.
   - Recalculate if necessary to ensure accuracy.

5. **State the Final Answer:**
   - Clearly write down the final answer.
   - Include units if applicable.

If you provide a specific math problem, I can apply this approach to solve it and show all the steps involved.
