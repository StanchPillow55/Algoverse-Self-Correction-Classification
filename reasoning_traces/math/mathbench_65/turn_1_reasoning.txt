==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 65," we first need to understand what the problem is asking. However, the phrase "Sample math problem 65" is not specific enough to determine the exact nature of the problem. It could refer to a problem labeled as number 65 in a textbook or a specific set of problems, but without additional context, we cannot know what the problem entails.

Since the problem is not specified, let's consider a hypothetical math problem that could be labeled as number 65 in a typical math context. For the sake of this exercise, let's assume that "Sample math problem 65" refers to a common type of math problem, such as solving a quadratic equation.

**Hypothetical Problem 65: Solve the quadratic equation \(x^2 - 5x + 6 = 0\).**

To solve this quadratic equation, we can use the factoring method, as the equation is factorable.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Write the equation in standard form:**
   The given equation is already in standard form: \(x^2 - 5x + 6 = 0\).

2. **Factor the quadratic expression:**
   We need to find two numbers that multiply to the constant term (+6) and add up to the linear coefficient (-5).

   The numbers -2 and -3 multiply to +6 and add up to -5. Therefore, we can factor the quadratic as:
   \[
   x^2 - 5x + 6 = (x - 2)(x - 3)
   \]

3. **Set each factor equal to zero:**
   To find the solutions for \(x\), set each factor equal to zero:
   \[
   x - 2 = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad x - 3 = 0
   \]

4. **Solve for \(x\):**
   Solving these equations gives:
   \[
   x = 2 \quad \text{or} \quad x = 3
   \]

5. **Verify the solutions:**
   Substitute \(x = 2\) and \(x = 3\) back into the original equation to verify:
   - For \(x = 2\): \(2^2 - 5(2) + 6 = 4 - 10 + 6 = 0\)
   - For \(x = 3\): \(3^2 - 5(3) + 6 = 9 - 15 + 6 = 0\)

   Both solutions satisfy the original equation.

### Final Answer:
The solutions to the quadratic equation \(x^2 - 5x + 6 = 0\) are \(x = 2\) and \(x = 3\).

If you have a specific problem labeled as "Sample math problem 65," please provide the details of the problem so that I can assist you accurately.
