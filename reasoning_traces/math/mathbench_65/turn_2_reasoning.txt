Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 65," we first need to understand what the problem is asking. However, the problem statement "Sample math problem 65" is not specific enough for us to determine what mathematical operations or concepts are involved. Therefore, I will assume that "Sample math problem 65" refers to a generic math problem that involves basic arithmetic or algebra, as these are common types of problems.

Let's assume a hypothetical problem for demonstration purposes:

**Hypothetical Problem:**
Solve for \( x \) in the equation: \( 2x + 5 = 15 \).

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Equation:**
   The equation given is \( 2x + 5 = 15 \). This is a linear equation in one variable, \( x \).

2. **Isolate the Variable:**
   To solve for \( x \), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We can do this by performing inverse operations.

3. **Subtract 5 from Both Sides:**
   To eliminate the constant term on the left side, subtract 5 from both sides of the equation:
   \[
   2x + 5 - 5 = 15 - 5
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   2x = 10
   \]

4. **Divide by 2:**
   Now, divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( x \):
   \[
   \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{10}{2}
   \]
   Simplifying gives:
   \[
   x = 5
   \]

5. **Check the Solution:**
   Substitute \( x = 5 \) back into the original equation to verify the solution:
   \[
   2(5) + 5 = 15
   \]
   Simplifying the left side gives:
   \[
   10 + 5 = 15
   \]
   Since both sides of the equation are equal, the solution \( x = 5 \) is correct.

**Final Answer:**
The solution to the equation \( 2x + 5 = 15 \) is \( x = 5 \).

If you have a specific "Sample math problem 65" in mind, please provide the details, and I will be happy to solve it for you.
