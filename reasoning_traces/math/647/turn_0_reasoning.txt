==================================================

To determine how long it will take Bill to dig the well, we need to calculate the time it takes him to dig through both the soil and the clay separately, and then sum those times.

### Step 1: Calculate the time to dig through the soil

Bill digs through soil at a rate of 4 feet per hour. He needs to dig through 24 feet of soil.

To find the time taken to dig through the soil, we use the formula:

\[
\text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Rate}}
\]

Substituting the values for soil:

\[
\text{Time}_{\text{soil}} = \frac{24 \text{ feet}}{4 \text{ feet/hour}} = 6 \text{ hours}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the time to dig through the clay

Bill digs through clay at half the speed of digging through soil, which means he digs at a rate of:

\[
\text{Rate}_{\text{clay}} = \frac{4 \text{ feet/hour}}{2} = 2 \text{ feet/hour}
\]

He needs to dig through 8 feet of clay. Using the same formula for time:

\[
\text{Time}_{\text{clay}} = \frac{8 \text{ feet}}{2 \text{ feet/hour}} = 4 \text{ hours}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the total time to dig the well

Now we sum the time taken to dig through the soil and the clay:

\[
\text{Total Time} = \text{Time}_{\text{soil}} + \text{Time}_{\text{clay}} = 6 \text{ hours} + 4 \text{ hours} = 10 \text{ hours}
\]

### Final Answer

The total time it will take Bill to dig the well is:

\[
\boxed{10 \text{ hours}}
\]
