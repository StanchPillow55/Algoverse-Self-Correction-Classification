Question ID: 535
Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step.

1. **Define Variables**:
   - Let \( G \) be the number of candies George originally had.
   - Since Nick had twice as many candies as George, we can express Nick's candies as \( N = 2G \).

2. **Understand the Situation After George Eats Candies**:
   - According to the problem, George ate 5 candies. After eating, he has 3 candies left. We can set up the equation:
     \[
     G - 5 = 3
     \]

3. **Solve for George's Original Candies**:
   - To find \( G \), we can rearrange the equation:
     \[
     G = 3 + 5
     \]
     \[
     G = 8
     \]
   - So, George originally had 8 candies.

4. **Calculate Nick's Candies**:
   - Now that we know \( G \), we can find \( N \):
     \[
     N = 2G = 2 \times 8 = 16
     \]

5. **Final Answer**:
   - Therefore, Nick has 16 candies.

In conclusion, after working through the problem step by step, we find that Nick has **16 candies**.
