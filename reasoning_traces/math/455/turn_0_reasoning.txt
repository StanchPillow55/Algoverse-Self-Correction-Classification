To solve the problem of how many days it will take for one amoeba to divide into 16 amoebae, we need to understand the process of reproduction by fission.

1. **Understanding the Reproduction Process**:
   - An amoeba reproduces by splitting into two. This means that every time an amoeba reproduces, the number of amoebae doubles.
   - The amoeba reproduces every 2 days.

2. **Calculating the Number of Amoebae Over Time**:
   - Let's denote the number of amoebae at the start (day 0) as \( N_0 = 1 \).
   - After 2 days (1 reproduction cycle), the number of amoebae will be:
     \[
     N_1 = 2 \times N_0 = 2 \times 1 = 2
     \]
   - After 4 days (2 reproduction cycles), the number of amoebae will be:
     \[
     N_2 = 2 \times N_1 = 2 \times 2 = 4
     \]
   - After 6 days (3 reproduction cycles), the number of amoebae will be:
     \[
     N_3 = 2 \times N_2 = 2 \times 4 = 8
     \]
   - After 8 days (4 reproduction cycles), the number of amoebae will be:
     \[
     N_4 = 2 \times N_3 = 2 \times 8 = 16
     \]

3. **Counting the Days**:
   - We can see that it takes 4 reproduction cycles to reach 16 amoebae.
   - Since each reproduction cycle takes 2 days, the total number of days is:
     \[
     \text{Total Days} = 4 \text{ cycles} \times 2 \text{ days/cycle} = 8 \text{ days}
     \]

4. **Final Answer**:
   - Therefore, it will take **8 days** for one amoeba to divide into 16 amoebae.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{8}
\]
