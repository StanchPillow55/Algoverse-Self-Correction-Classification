To solve this problem, we need to determine how many times the original amoeba must divide to result in a total of 16 amoebae. Each division doubles the number of amoebae, and each division takes 2 days.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Understand the division process:**
   - Initially, there is 1 amoeba.
   - After the first division, there will be 2 amoebae.
   - After the second division, there will be 4 amoebae.
   - After the third division, there will be 8 amoebae.
   - After the fourth division, there will be 16 amoebae.

2. **Determine the number of divisions needed:**
   - We start with 1 amoeba and want to reach 16 amoebae.
   - The sequence of amoebae after each division is: 1, 2, 4, 8, 16.
   - We observe that it takes 4 divisions to reach 16 amoebae.

3. **Calculate the total time required:**
   - Each division takes 2 days.
   - Therefore, the total time for 4 divisions is: 
     \[
     4 \text{ divisions} \times 2 \text{ days/division} = 8 \text{ days}
     \]

Thus, it will take 8 days for one amoeba to divide into 16 amoebae.

**Final Answer: 8 days**
