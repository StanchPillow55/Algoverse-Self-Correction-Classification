Question ID: 455
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem of how many days it will take for one amoeba to divide into 16 amoebae, we can follow these steps:

1. **Understand the reproduction process**: Each amoeba reproduces by fission every 2 days. This means that every 2 days, the number of amoebae doubles.

2. **Determine the growth pattern**: Starting with 1 amoeba:
   - After 2 days: \(1 \times 2 = 2\) amoebae
   - After 4 days: \(2 \times 2 = 4\) amoebae
   - After 6 days: \(4 \times 2 = 8\) amoebae
   - After 8 days: \(8 \times 2 = 16\) amoebae

3. **Count the days**: From the calculations above, we see that it takes 8 days for the initial amoeba to reproduce into 16 amoebae.

Thus, the final answer is:

**8 days**.
