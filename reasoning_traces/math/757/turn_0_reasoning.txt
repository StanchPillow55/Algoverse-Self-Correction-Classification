To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step, calculating the number of shirts needed for each size based on the information provided.

1. **Extra-small shirts**: 
   - Krissa needs shirts for 11 students in size extra-small.
   - Let \( E = 11 \).

2. **Small shirts**: 
   - It is stated that twice as many students need size small as extra-small.
   - Therefore, the number of small shirts needed is:
   \[
   S = 2 \times E = 2 \times 11 = 22
   \]

3. **Medium shirts**: 
   - Four less than the number of size small students need size medium.
   - Therefore, the number of medium shirts needed is:
   \[
   M = S - 4 = 22 - 4 = 18
   \]

4. **Large shirts**: 
   - Half as many students need size large as size medium.
   - Therefore, the number of large shirts needed is:
   \[
   L = \frac{M}{2} = \frac{18}{2} = 9
   \]

5. **Extra-large shirts**: 
   - Six more students need size extra-large than large.
   - Therefore, the number of extra-large shirts needed is:
   \[
   XL = L + 6 = 9 + 6 = 15
   \]

Now, we have calculated the number of shirts needed for each size:
- Extra-small: \( E = 11 \)
- Small: \( S = 22 \)
- Medium: \( M = 18 \)
- Large: \( L = 9 \)
- Extra-large: \( XL = 15 \)

6. **Total shirts ordered**: 
   - To find the total number of shirts Krissa ordered, we sum all the shirts:
   \[
   \text{Total} = E + S + M + L + XL
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total} = 11 + 22 + 18 + 9 + 15
   \]

Now, we perform the addition step-by-step:
- First, add \( 11 + 22 = 33 \)
- Next, add \( 33 + 18 = 51 \)
- Then, add \( 51 + 9 = 60 \)
- Finally, add \( 60 + 15 = 75 \)

Thus, the total number of shirts Krissa ordered is:
\[
\text{Total} = 75
\]

Therefore, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{75}
\]
