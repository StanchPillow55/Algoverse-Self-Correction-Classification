To calculate how much Madeline spends on her dog per year, we need to break down her monthly expenses into three categories: food, treats, and medicine. Then, we will sum these monthly expenses and multiply by the number of months in a year.

### Step 1: Calculate Monthly Food Cost
Madeline spends $25 per week on dog food. Since there are 4 weeks in a month, we can calculate the monthly food cost as follows:

\[
\text{Monthly Food Cost} = \text{Cost per week} \times \text{Number of weeks in a month}
\]
\[
\text{Monthly Food Cost} = 25 \, \text{dollars/week} \times 4 \, \text{weeks/month} = 100 \, \text{dollars/month}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate Monthly Treats Cost
Madeline spends $20 per month on treats. This is already given, so:

\[
\text{Monthly Treats Cost} = 20 \, \text{dollars/month}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate Monthly Medicine Cost
Madeline spends $100 per month on medicine. This is also given, so:

\[
\text{Monthly Medicine Cost} = 100 \, \text{dollars/month}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate Total Monthly Expenses
Now, we can sum all the monthly expenses to find the total monthly cost for her dog:

\[
\text{Total Monthly Expenses} = \text{Monthly Food Cost} + \text{Monthly Treats Cost} + \text{Monthly Medicine Cost}
\]
\[
\text{Total Monthly Expenses} = 100 \, \text{dollars/month} + 20 \, \text{dollars/month} + 100 \, \text{dollars/month}
\]
\[
\text{Total Monthly Expenses} = 220 \, \text{dollars/month}
\]

### Step 5: Calculate Annual Expenses
To find out how much Madeline spends on her dog per year, we multiply the total monthly expenses by the number of months in a year (12):

\[
\text{Total Annual Expenses} = \text{Total Monthly Expenses} \times 12 \, \text{months/year}
\]
\[
\text{Total Annual Expenses} = 220 \, \text{dollars/month} \times 12 \, \text{months/year}
\]
\[
\text{Total Annual Expenses} = 2640 \, \text{dollars/year}
\]

### Final Answer
Madeline spends **$2640** on her dog per year.
