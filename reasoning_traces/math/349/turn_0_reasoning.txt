To solve this problem, we need to set up equations based on the information given and then solve for the number of goats.

Let's define the variables:
- Let \( c \) represent the number of cows.
- Let \( p \) represent the number of pigs.
- Let \( g \) represent the number of goats.

From the problem, we have the following information:
1. The farmer has twice as many pigs as cows: \( p = 2c \).
2. The farmer has 4 more cows than goats: \( c = g + 4 \).
3. The total number of animals is 56: \( c + p + g = 56 \).

Now, we will substitute the expressions for \( p \) and \( c \) from the first two equations into the third equation.

Substitute \( p = 2c \) into the total equation:
\[ c + 2c + g = 56 \]
This simplifies to:
\[ 3c + g = 56 \]

Next, substitute \( c = g + 4 \) into the equation \( 3c + g = 56 \):
\[ 3(g + 4) + g = 56 \]

Expand and simplify:
\[ 3g + 12 + g = 56 \]
\[ 4g + 12 = 56 \]

Subtract 12 from both sides to isolate the term with \( g \):
\[ 4g = 44 \]

Divide both sides by 4 to solve for \( g \):
\[ g = 11 \]

Thus, the farmer has 11 goats.

To verify, let's find the number of cows and pigs:
- Since \( c = g + 4 \), substitute \( g = 11 \) into this equation:
  \[ c = 11 + 4 = 15 \]
- Since \( p = 2c \), substitute \( c = 15 \) into this equation:
  \[ p = 2 \times 15 = 30 \]

Now, check the total number of animals:
\[ c + p + g = 15 + 30 + 11 = 56 \]

The calculations are consistent with the total number of animals given in the problem. Therefore, the solution is correct.

Final Answer: The farmer has 11 goats.
