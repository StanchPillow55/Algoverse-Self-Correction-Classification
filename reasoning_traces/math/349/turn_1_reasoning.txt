==================================================

Let's define the variables for the number of animals:

- Let \( c \) be the number of cows.
- Let \( p \) be the number of pigs.
- Let \( g \) be the number of goats.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:

1. The farmer has twice as many pigs as cows:
   \[
   p = 2c
   \]

2. The farmer has 4 more cows than goats:
   \[
   c = g + 4
   \]

3. The total number of animals is 56:
   \[
   p + c + g = 56
   \]

Now, we can substitute the expressions for \( p \) and \( c \) in terms of \( g \) into the total animals equation.

First, substitute \( c \) from the second equation into the first equation:
\[
p = 2c = 2(g + 4) = 2g + 8
\]

Now substitute \( p \) and \( c \) into the total animals equation:
\[
(2g + 8) + (g + 4) + g = 56
\]

Combine like terms:
\[
2g + 8 + g + 4 + g = 56
\]
\[
4g + 12 = 56
\]

Now, solve for \( g \):
\[
4g = 56 - 12
\]
\[
4g = 44
\]
\[
g = \frac{44}{4} = 11
\]

Thus, the number of goats is \( g = 11 \).

To verify, we can find the number of cows and pigs:
- From \( c = g + 4 \):
  \[
  c = 11 + 4 = 15
  \]

- From \( p = 2c \):
  \[
  p = 2 \times 15 = 30
  \]

Now, check the total:
\[
p + c + g = 30 + 15 + 11 = 56
\]

Everything checks out. Therefore, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{11}
\]
