==================================================

To solve the problem, we first need to understand what "Sample reasoning question 401" entails. Since the problem statement is not specific, I'll assume it's a placeholder for a typical math problem. Let's create a hypothetical math problem and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**

A company produces two types of widgets: A and B. The company can produce a maximum of 100 widgets per day. Each widget A requires 2 hours of labor, and each widget B requires 3 hours of labor. The company has a total of 240 labor hours available per day. If the profit from each widget A is $5 and from each widget B is $7, how many of each type of widget should the company produce to maximize profit?

**Step-by-step Solution:**

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( x \) be the number of widget A produced per day.
   - Let \( y \) be the number of widget B produced per day.

2. **Set Up Constraints:**
   - The total number of widgets produced cannot exceed 100:
     \[
     x + y \leq 100
     \]
   - The total labor hours cannot exceed 240:
     \[
     2x + 3y \leq 240
     \]
   - Non-negativity constraints:
     \[
     x \geq 0, \quad y \geq 0
     \]

3. **Objective Function:**
   - The profit function to maximize is:
     \[
     P = 5x + 7y
     \]

4. **Graph the Constraints:**
   - Plot the lines \( x + y = 100 \) and \( 2x + 3y = 240 \) on a graph.
   - Identify the feasible region that satisfies all constraints.

5. **Find the Corner Points:**
   - Solve the system of equations to find the intersection points:
     - \( x + y = 100 \)
     - \( 2x + 3y = 240 \)

   Solving these simultaneously:
   - From \( x + y = 100 \), express \( y \) in terms of \( x \): \( y = 100 - x \).
   - Substitute into the second equation:
     \[
     2x + 3(100 - x) = 240
     \]
     \[
     2x + 300 - 3x = 240
     \]
     \[
     -x + 300 = 240
     \]
     \[
     x = 60
     \]
   - Substitute \( x = 60 \) back into \( y = 100 - x \):
     \[
     y = 100 - 60 = 40
     \]

   - Other corner points are found by setting \( x = 0 \) and \( y = 0 \):
     - \( x = 0 \): \( y = 100 \)
     - \( y = 0 \): \( x = 80 \) (from \( 2x = 240 \))

6. **Evaluate the Objective Function at Each Corner Point:**
   - \( (x, y) = (0, 80) \): \( P = 5(0) + 7(80) = 560 \)
   - \( (x, y) = (60, 40) \): \( P = 5(60) + 7(40) = 300 + 280 = 580 \)
   - \( (x, y) = (100, 0) \): \( P = 5(100) + 7(0) = 500 \)

7. **Determine the Maximum Profit:**
   - The maximum profit is \( 580 \), which occurs at \( (x, y) = (60, 40) \).

**Final Answer:**
The company should produce 60 widgets of type A and 40 widgets of type B to maximize profit, resulting in a maximum profit of $580.
