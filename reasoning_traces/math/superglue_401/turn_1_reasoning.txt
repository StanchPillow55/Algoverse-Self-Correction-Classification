==================================================

To solve the problem effectively, let's first clarify what "Sample reasoning question 401" entails. Since the problem statement is not explicitly provided, I'll assume it involves a typical math problem-solving scenario. Let's create a hypothetical problem and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**

A company produces two types of gadgets: Gadget A and Gadget B. The production cost for Gadget A is $50, and for Gadget B, it is $70. The company sells Gadget A for $80 and Gadget B for $120. If the company produces 100 units of Gadget A and 150 units of Gadget B, what is the total profit?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Identify the Given Information:**
   - Production cost of Gadget A = $50
   - Selling price of Gadget A = $80
   - Production cost of Gadget B = $70
   - Selling price of Gadget B = $120
   - Number of Gadget A produced = 100 units
   - Number of Gadget B produced = 150 units

2. **Calculate the Profit per Unit for Each Gadget:**
   - Profit per unit of Gadget A = Selling price of Gadget A - Production cost of Gadget A
     \[
     \text{Profit per unit of Gadget A} = 80 - 50 = 30
     \]
   - Profit per unit of Gadget B = Selling price of Gadget B - Production cost of Gadget B
     \[
     \text{Profit per unit of Gadget B} = 120 - 70 = 50
     \]

3. **Calculate the Total Profit for Each Gadget:**
   - Total profit from Gadget A = Profit per unit of Gadget A × Number of Gadget A produced
     \[
     \text{Total profit from Gadget A} = 30 \times 100 = 3000
     \]
   - Total profit from Gadget B = Profit per unit of Gadget B × Number of Gadget B produced
     \[
     \text{Total profit from Gadget B} = 50 \times 150 = 7500
     \]

4. **Calculate the Total Profit for the Company:**
   - Total profit = Total profit from Gadget A + Total profit from Gadget B
     \[
     \text{Total profit} = 3000 + 7500 = 10500
     \]

**Final Answer:**

The total profit for the company from producing and selling 100 units of Gadget A and 150 units of Gadget B is $10,500.
