==================================================

To solve the problem effectively, I need to understand the context and details of "Sample reasoning question 401." However, since the question itself is not provided, I'll demonstrate how to approach a typical math problem by creating a hypothetical example and solving it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**

*Question 401: A farmer has a rectangular field that is 100 meters long and 60 meters wide. He wants to divide the field into two equal parts by building a fence parallel to the shorter side. How long will the fence be?*

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - The field is rectangular with dimensions 100 meters (length) and 60 meters (width).
   - The farmer wants to divide the field into two equal parts by building a fence parallel to the shorter side (width).

2. **Visualize the Problem:**
   - Imagine the rectangle with the longer side (100 meters) as the base and the shorter side (60 meters) as the height.
   - To divide the field into two equal parts, the fence should be parallel to the shorter side (60 meters).

3. **Determine the Length of the Fence:**
   - Since the fence is parallel to the shorter side, it will span the entire length of the field.
   - Therefore, the length of the fence will be equal to the length of the field, which is 100 meters.

4. **Verify the Solution:**
   - Dividing the field into two equal parts means each part will have an area of half the total area of the field.
   - Total area of the field = Length × Width = 100 meters × 60 meters = 6000 square meters.
   - Area of each part = 6000 square meters / 2 = 3000 square meters.
   - The dimensions of each part will be 100 meters (length) × 30 meters (width), confirming that the fence divides the field into two equal areas.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The length of the fence needed to divide the field into two equal parts is 100 meters.

**Final Answer:**
The length of the fence is 100 meters.
