Question ID: superglue_401
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem effectively, let's first clarify what "Sample reasoning question 401" might entail. Since the problem statement is not explicitly given, I'll assume a generic math problem-solving approach and demonstrate how to tackle a typical reasoning question.

### Step-by-Step Approach:

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - Since the problem is not specified, let's assume it's a typical math reasoning problem involving numbers, patterns, or logical deductions.

2. **Identify Known Information:**
   - We have a placeholder "Sample reasoning question 401," which suggests a sequence or pattern might be involved.

3. **Identify What is Being Asked:**
   - Without specific details, let's assume the question asks us to find the next number in a sequence or solve for a variable.

4. **Devise a Plan:**
   - If it's a sequence, identify the pattern.
   - If it's an equation, solve for the unknown.

5. **Carry Out the Plan:**
   - **Example Sequence Problem:** Suppose the sequence is 2, 4, 8, 16, ...
     - Identify the pattern: Each number is multiplied by 2.
     - Next number: 16 * 2 = 32.

   - **Example Equation Problem:** Suppose the equation is 2x + 3 = 11.
     - Solve for x:
       - Subtract 3 from both sides: 2x = 8.
       - Divide both sides by 2: x = 4.

6. **Check Your Work:**
   - For the sequence: Verify that multiplying by 2 consistently produces the next number.
   - For the equation: Substitute x = 4 back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies 2x + 3 = 11.

7. **State the Final Answer:**
   - For the sequence example, the next number is 32.
   - For the equation example, the solution is x = 4.

### Conclusion:

Without a specific problem statement, the approach above demonstrates how to tackle a reasoning question by identifying patterns or solving equations. If you have a specific problem or more details, please provide them for a more tailored solution.
