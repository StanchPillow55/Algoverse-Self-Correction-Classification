==================================================

To solve the problem, I need more information about "Sample reasoning question 401." Since the problem statement is missing, I'll provide a general approach to solving math problems step by step. If you have a specific problem in mind, please provide the details, and I'll be happy to help.

### General Approach to Solving Math Problems

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - Read the problem carefully.
   - Identify what is being asked.
   - Determine what information is given and what needs to be found.

2. **Devise a Plan:**
   - Consider possible strategies to solve the problem, such as drawing a diagram, creating an equation, or breaking the problem into smaller parts.
   - Choose the most appropriate method based on the problem type.

3. **Carry Out the Plan:**
   - Execute the chosen strategy step by step.
   - Perform calculations carefully, showing all work.
   - Keep track of units and ensure consistency throughout the calculations.

4. **Review/Check Your Work:**
   - Verify each step to ensure accuracy.
   - Check if the solution makes sense in the context of the problem.
   - Review calculations and logic to confirm the solution is correct.

5. **State the Final Answer:**
   - Clearly write the final answer.
   - Include units if applicable.
   - Ensure the answer addresses the question asked.

### Example Problem

Let's apply this approach to a simple example problem:

**Problem:**
Find the sum of the first 10 positive integers.

**Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We need to find the sum of the first 10 positive integers: 1, 2, 3, ..., 10.

2. **Devise a Plan:**
   - Use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series: \( S_n = \frac{n}{2} \times (a + l) \)
     - Where \( n \) is the number of terms, \( a \) is the first term, and \( l \) is the last term.

3. **Carry Out the Plan:**
   - Here, \( n = 10 \), \( a = 1 \), and \( l = 10 \).
   - Substitute these values into the formula:
     \[
     S_{10} = \frac{10}{2} \times (1 + 10) = 5 \times 11 = 55
     \]

4. **Review/Check Your Work:**
   - Verify by manually adding the numbers: \( 1 + 2 + 3 + \ldots + 10 = 55 \).
   - The calculation matches the formula result.

5. **State the Final Answer:**
   - The sum of the first 10 positive integers is 55.
