==================================================

To solve the problem, I need more specific information about "Sample reasoning question 401." Since the question is not provided, I'll demonstrate a general approach to solving a reasoning problem in mathematics. If you have a specific problem in mind, please provide the details, and I'll be happy to help.

Let's consider a sample reasoning problem:

**Problem:**
A train travels from Station A to Station B at a speed of 60 km/h and returns from Station B to Station A at a speed of 40 km/h. What is the average speed of the train for the entire journey?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We need to find the average speed of the train for the entire journey from Station A to Station B and back to Station A.
   - The train travels at different speeds in each direction.

2. **Define the Variables:**
   - Let the distance between Station A and Station B be \( d \) km.

3. **Calculate the Time for Each Leg of the Journey:**
   - Time taken to travel from A to B: 
     \[
     t_1 = \frac{d}{60} \text{ hours}
     \]
   - Time taken to travel from B to A:
     \[
     t_2 = \frac{d}{40} \text{ hours}
     \]

4. **Calculate the Total Time for the Journey:**
   \[
   t_{\text{total}} = t_1 + t_2 = \frac{d}{60} + \frac{d}{40}
   \]

5. **Find a Common Denominator and Simplify:**
   - The common denominator of 60 and 40 is 120.
   - Convert the fractions:
     \[
     \frac{d}{60} = \frac{2d}{120}, \quad \frac{d}{40} = \frac{3d}{120}
     \]
   - Add the fractions:
     \[
     t_{\text{total}} = \frac{2d}{120} + \frac{3d}{120} = \frac{5d}{120} = \frac{d}{24} \text{ hours}
     \]

6. **Calculate the Total Distance:**
   - The total distance for the round trip is \( 2d \) km.

7. **Calculate the Average Speed:**
   - Average speed is given by the total distance divided by the total time:
     \[
     \text{Average speed} = \frac{\text{Total distance}}{\text{Total time}} = \frac{2d}{\frac{d}{24}} = 2d \times \frac{24}{d} = 48 \text{ km/h}
     \]

8. **Conclusion:**
   - The average speed of the train for the entire journey is 48 km/h.

**Final Answer:**
The average speed of the train for the entire journey is 48 km/h.
