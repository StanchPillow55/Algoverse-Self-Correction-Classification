==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 88" entails. Since the problem statement is not explicitly provided, I will demonstrate a general approach to solving a typical math problem by using a hypothetical example. Let's assume "Sample reasoning question 88" involves solving a quadratic equation. 

### Problem:
Solve the quadratic equation: \(2x^2 - 4x - 6 = 0\).

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Identify the quadratic equation**: The given equation is \(2x^2 - 4x - 6 = 0\).

2. **Simplify the equation**: Check if the equation can be simplified by dividing all terms by a common factor. In this case, all terms are divisible by 2:
   \[
   \frac{2x^2}{2} - \frac{4x}{2} - \frac{6}{2} = 0 \implies x^2 - 2x - 3 = 0
   \]

3. **Factor the quadratic equation**: Look for two numbers that multiply to the constant term (-3) and add to the linear coefficient (-2). The numbers -3 and 1 satisfy these conditions:
   \[
   x^2 - 2x - 3 = (x - 3)(x + 1) = 0
   \]

4. **Solve for the roots**: Set each factor equal to zero and solve for \(x\):
   \[
   x - 3 = 0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad x = 3
   \]
   \[
   x + 1 = 0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad x = -1
   \]

5. **Verify the solutions**: Substitute the solutions back into the original equation to ensure they satisfy it:
   - For \(x = 3\):
     \[
     2(3)^2 - 4(3) - 6 = 18 - 12 - 6 = 0
     \]
   - For \(x = -1\):
     \[
     2(-1)^2 - 4(-1) - 6 = 2 + 4 - 6 = 0
     \]

Both solutions satisfy the original equation.

### Final Answer:
The solutions to the quadratic equation \(2x^2 - 4x - 6 = 0\) are \(x = 3\) and \(x = -1\).
