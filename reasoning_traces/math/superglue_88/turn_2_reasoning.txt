==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 88" refers to. Since the problem statement is not explicitly provided, I will assume this is a placeholder for a typical math problem. Let's create a hypothetical problem and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**

A farmer has a rectangular field that is 100 meters long and 50 meters wide. He wants to build a fence around the field and also divide the field into two equal smaller rectangles with a fence parallel to the shorter side. Calculate the total length of the fence required.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We have a rectangular field with dimensions 100 meters (length) and 50 meters (width).
   - We need to calculate the total length of the fence required to enclose the field and divide it into two equal parts.

2. **Calculate the Perimeter of the Field:**
   - The perimeter \( P \) of a rectangle is given by the formula:
     \[
     P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width})
     \]
   - Substituting the given values:
     \[
     P = 2 \times (100 + 50) = 2 \times 150 = 300 \text{ meters}
     \]

3. **Divide the Field into Two Equal Parts:**
   - To divide the field into two equal rectangles, we need to add a fence parallel to the shorter side (width).
   - This additional fence will be equal to the length of the field, which is 100 meters.

4. **Calculate the Total Length of the Fence:**
   - The total length of the fence required is the perimeter of the field plus the additional fence for division:
     \[
     \text{Total Length} = \text{Perimeter} + \text{Additional Fence}
     \]
   - Substituting the values:
     \[
     \text{Total Length} = 300 + 100 = 400 \text{ meters}
     \]

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The total length of the fence required to enclose the field and divide it into two equal parts is 400 meters.

**Final Answer:**

The total length of the fence required is 400 meters.
