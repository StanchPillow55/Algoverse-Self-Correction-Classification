To solve the problem, I need more specific details about "Sample reasoning question 88." Since the problem statement is not provided, I'll demonstrate how to approach a typical math problem step by step. If you have a specific problem in mind, please provide the details, and I'll be happy to help.

Let's consider a sample math problem:

**Problem:**  
A car travels from Town A to Town B at a speed of 60 km/h and returns from Town B to Town A at a speed of 40 km/h. What is the average speed of the car for the entire journey?

**Solution:**

To find the average speed for the entire journey, we need to consider the total distance traveled and the total time taken.

1. **Define the Variables:**
   - Let the distance from Town A to Town B be \( D \) km.

2. **Calculate the Time for Each Leg of the Journey:**
   - Time taken to travel from Town A to Town B at 60 km/h:  
     \[
     \text{Time}_{AB} = \frac{D}{60} \text{ hours}
     \]
   - Time taken to travel from Town B to Town A at 40 km/h:  
     \[
     \text{Time}_{BA} = \frac{D}{40} \text{ hours}
     \]

3. **Calculate the Total Distance and Total Time:**
   - Total distance for the round trip:  
     \[
     \text{Total Distance} = D + D = 2D \text{ km}
     \]
   - Total time for the round trip:  
     \[
     \text{Total Time} = \frac{D}{60} + \frac{D}{40}
     \]

4. **Simplify the Total Time Expression:**
   - Find a common denominator for the fractions:  
     \[
     \frac{D}{60} + \frac{D}{40} = \frac{2D}{120} + \frac{3D}{120} = \frac{5D}{120} = \frac{D}{24} \text{ hours}
     \]

5. **Calculate the Average Speed:**
   - Average speed is the total distance divided by the total time:  
     \[
     \text{Average Speed} = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Total Time}} = \frac{2D}{\frac{D}{24}} = 2D \times \frac{24}{D} = 48 \text{ km/h}
     \]

**Final Answer:**
The average speed of the car for the entire journey is 48 km/h.
