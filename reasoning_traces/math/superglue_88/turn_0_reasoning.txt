==================================================

To solve the problem, I need more context or details about "Sample reasoning question 88." Since the question is not provided, I'll guide you through a generic approach to solving a math problem step by step. If you have a specific problem in mind, please provide the details, and I'll be happy to assist you further.

### Generic Approach to Solving a Math Problem:

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - Carefully read the problem statement.
   - Identify what is being asked.
   - Note down any given information or data.

2. **Devise a Plan:**
   - Determine the mathematical concepts involved (e.g., algebra, geometry, calculus).
   - Choose an appropriate strategy to solve the problem (e.g., equation solving, graphing, logical reasoning).

3. **Carry Out the Plan:**
   - Execute the chosen strategy step by step.
   - Perform calculations carefully.
   - Keep track of units and conversion factors if applicable.

4. **Check Your Work:**
   - Review each step to ensure accuracy.
   - Verify that the solution satisfies the conditions of the problem.
   - Consider alternative methods to cross-check the result.

5. **State the Final Answer:**
   - Clearly present the solution.
   - Include units if applicable.
   - Ensure the answer addresses the question posed.

### Example Problem:

**Problem:** Solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).

**Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We need to find the value of \( x \) that satisfies the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).

2. **Devise a Plan:**
   - Use algebraic manipulation to isolate \( x \).

3. **Carry Out the Plan:**
   - Start with the equation: \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).
   - Subtract 3 from both sides to isolate the term with \( x \):
     \[
     2x + 3 - 3 = 11 - 3
     \]
     \[
     2x = 8
     \]
   - Divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( x \):
     \[
     \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{8}{2}
     \]
     \[
     x = 4
     \]

4. **Check Your Work:**
   - Substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation to verify:
     \[
     2(4) + 3 = 8 + 3 = 11
     \]
   - The left side equals the right side, confirming the solution is correct.

5. **State the Final Answer:**
   - The solution to the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \) is \( x = 4 \).

If you have a specific problem or question number in mind, please provide the details, and I can tailor the solution to that particular problem.
