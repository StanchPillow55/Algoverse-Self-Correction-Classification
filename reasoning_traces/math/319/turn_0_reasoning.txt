==================================================

To solve the problem, we will break it down into steps and perform calculations based on the information given.

1. **Initial Number of Diaries**: 
   Natalie's sister starts with 8 small diaries.

2. **Buying More Diaries**: 
   Last summer, she bought double the number of diaries she originally had. Since she had 8 diaries, we calculate the number of diaries she bought:
   \[
   \text{Diaries bought} = 2 \times 8 = 16
   \]

3. **Total Number of Diaries After Purchase**: 
   After buying the additional diaries, we add the number of diaries she bought to the original number of diaries:
   \[
   \text{Total diaries after purchase} = 8 + 16 = 24
   \]

4. **Losing Diaries**: 
   She then lost 1/4 of the total number of diaries she had after the purchase. First, we need to calculate 1/4 of the total number of diaries:
   \[
   \text{Diaries lost} = \frac{1}{4} \times 24 = 6
   \]

5. **Calculating Remaining Diaries**: 
   Now, we subtract the number of diaries lost from the total number of diaries she had after the purchase:
   \[
   \text{Remaining diaries} = 24 - 6 = 18
   \]

Thus, after all the calculations, we find that Natalie's sister has a total of **18 diaries** now.

Final answer:
\[
\boxed{18}
\]
