Question ID: 319
Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we start by understanding the ratio given in the question. The ratio of electric poles to electric wires is 1:3. This means that for every 1 electric pole, there are 3 electric wires.

Let's denote:
- The number of electric poles as \( P \)
- The number of electric wires as \( W \)

From the ratio, we can express the relationship between poles and wires mathematically:
\[
\frac{P}{W} = \frac{1}{3}
\]

This can be rearranged to express \( P \) in terms of \( W \):
\[
P = \frac{1}{3} W
\]

According to the problem, the total number of electric wires \( W \) is given as 45. We can substitute this value into the equation:
\[
P = \frac{1}{3} \times 45
\]

Now, we perform the multiplication:
\[
P = \frac{45}{3} = 15
\]

Thus, the total number of electric poles required is 15.

To summarize:
1. The ratio of poles to wires is 1:3.
2. The number of wires \( W \) is 45.
3. Using the ratio, we calculated the number of poles \( P \) as \( P = \frac{1}{3} \times 45 = 15 \).

Therefore, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{15}
\]
