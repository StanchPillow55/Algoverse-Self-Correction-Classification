==================================================

To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step, following the sequence of events described:

1. **Initial Number of Diaries:**
   Natalie's sister initially had 8 small diaries in her locker.

2. **Doubling the Number of Diaries:**
   Last summer, she bought double the number of diaries she initially had. 
   - The initial number of diaries is 8.
   - Doubling this amount means multiplying by 2: 
     \[
     8 \times 2 = 16
     \]
   - So, she bought 16 more diaries.

3. **Total Diaries After Purchase:**
   After buying 16 more diaries, we need to add these to the original number she had:
   \[
   8 + 16 = 24
   \]
   - Now, she has a total of 24 diaries.

4. **Losing 1/4 of the Diaries:**
   She then lost 1/4 of the diaries she had after the purchase.
   - To find out how many diaries she lost, calculate 1/4 of 24:
     \[
     \frac{1}{4} \times 24 = 6
     \]
   - She lost 6 diaries.

5. **Final Number of Diaries:**
   Subtract the number of diaries lost from the total she had after the purchase:
   \[
   24 - 6 = 18
   \]

Therefore, after all these events, Natalie's sister has 18 diaries now.

**Final Answer: 18 diaries**
