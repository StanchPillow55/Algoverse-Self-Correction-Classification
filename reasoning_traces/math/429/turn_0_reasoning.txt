To solve this problem, we need to determine how many English-language books in the school's library were published outside the country. Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the number of English-language books:**

   We know that 80% of all the books in the library are in English. The total number of books in the library is 2300. To find the number of English-language books, we calculate 80% of 2300.

   \[
   \text{Number of English books} = 0.80 \times 2300
   \]

   \[
   \text{Number of English books} = 1840
   \]

   So, there are 1840 English-language books in the library.

2. **Determine the number of English-language books published in the country:**

   We are told that 60% of the English-language books were published in the country. To find this number, we calculate 60% of the 1840 English-language books.

   \[
   \text{Number of English books published in the country} = 0.60 \times 1840
   \]

   \[
   \text{Number of English books published in the country} = 1104
   \]

   Therefore, 1104 English-language books were published in the country.

3. **Determine the number of English-language books published outside the country:**

   To find the number of English-language books published outside the country, we subtract the number of English-language books published in the country from the total number of English-language books.

   \[
   \text{Number of English books published outside the country} = 1840 - 1104
   \]

   \[
   \text{Number of English books published outside the country} = 736
   \]

Thus, the number of English-language books that have been published outside the country is 736.

**Final Answer: 736**
