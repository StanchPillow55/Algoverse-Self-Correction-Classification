Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of English books**: We know that 80% of the 2300 books are in English. 

   \[
   \text{Number of English books} = 80\% \text{ of } 2300 = 0.80 \times 2300
   \]

   \[
   = 1840
   \]

2. **Calculate the number of English books published in the country**: We are told that 60% of the English books were published in the country.

   \[
   \text{Number of English books published in the country} = 60\% \text{ of } 1840 = 0.60 \times 1840
   \]

   \[
   = 1104
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of English books published outside the country**: To find the number of English-language books published outside the country, we subtract the number of books published in the country from the total number of English books.

   \[
   \text{Number of English books published outside the country} = \text{Total English books} - \text{English books published in the country}
   \]

   \[
   = 1840 - 1104
   \]

   \[
   = 736
   \]

Thus, the number of English-language books that have been published outside the country is \( \boxed{736} \).
