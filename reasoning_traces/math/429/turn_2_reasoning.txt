Question ID: 429
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of letters in both Indras' name and her sister's name.

1. **Identify the number of letters in Indras' name:**
   - The problem states that Indras has 6 letters in her name.
   - Therefore, we have:
     \[
     \text{Letters in Indras' name} = 6
     \]

2. **Determine the number of letters in her sister's name:**
   - The problem states that her sister's name has 4 more letters than half of the letters in Indras' name.
   - First, we need to calculate half of the letters in Indras' name:
     \[
     \text{Half of Indras' letters} = \frac{6}{2} = 3
     \]

3. **Add 4 letters to this half:**
   - Now, we add 4 to the half we just calculated:
     \[
     \text{Letters in sister's name} = 3 + 4 = 7
     \]

4. **Summarize the findings:**
   - Indras has 6 letters in her name.
   - Her sister has 7 letters in her name.

5. **Final answer:**
   - The number of letters in Indras' name is 6, and the number of letters in her sister's name is 7.

Thus, the final answer is:
- Indras: 6 letters
- Sister: 7 letters
