Question ID: 8
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we will break it down into parts and calculate the distances traveled by John during each segment of his trip.

1. **Initial Drive Away from Home:**
   - John drives for 3 hours at a speed of 60 mph.
   - Distance = Speed × Time
   - Distance = 60 mph × 3 hours = 180 miles
   - At this point, John is 180 miles away from home.

2. **Return Trip:**
   - John tries to get home in 4 hours but spends the first 2 hours in standstill traffic. During this time, he does not cover any distance.
   - Distance covered in standstill traffic = 0 miles.

3. **Next Half-Hour Driving at 30 mph:**
   - After 2 hours of standstill traffic, he drives for 0.5 hours at 30 mph.
   - Distance = Speed × Time
   - Distance = 30 mph × 0.5 hours = 15 miles
   - After this segment, he has traveled 15 miles towards home.

4. **Remaining Time Driving at 80 mph:**
   - Total time for the return trip is 4 hours, and he has already spent 2 hours in traffic and 0.5 hours driving at 30 mph, totaling 2.5 hours.
   - Remaining time = 4 hours - 2.5 hours = 1.5 hours.
   - He drives the remaining 1.5 hours at 80 mph.
   - Distance = Speed × Time
   - Distance = 80 mph × 1.5 hours = 120 miles
   - After this segment, he has traveled an additional 120 miles towards home.

5. **Total Distance Traveled Towards Home:**
   - Total distance traveled towards home = Distance from 30 mph segment + Distance from 80 mph segment
   - Total distance towards home = 15 miles + 120 miles = 135 miles

6. **Calculating Distance from Home:**
   - John was initially 180 miles away from home.
   - After traveling 135 miles towards home, the distance from home is:
   - Distance from home = Initial distance - Distance traveled towards home
   - Distance from home = 180 miles - 135 miles = 45 miles

Thus, at the end of the 4 hours, John is **45 miles away from home**.

**Final Answer:** 45 miles
