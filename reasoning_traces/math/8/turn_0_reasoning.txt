To determine how much Alexis paid for the shoes, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total amount spent on the other clothing items.**
   - Button-up shirt: $30
   - Suit pants: $46
   - Suit coat: $38
   - Socks: $11
   - Belt: $18

   We will add these amounts together:

   \[
   \text{Total spent on clothing items} = 30 + 46 + 38 + 11 + 18
   \]

   Let's calculate this step-by-step:

   - First, add the shirt and pants:
     \[
     30 + 46 = 76
     \]
   - Next, add the suit coat:
     \[
     76 + 38 = 114
     \]
   - Then, add the socks:
     \[
     114 + 11 = 125
     \]
   - Finally, add the belt:
     \[
     125 + 18 = 143
     \]

   So, the total amount spent on the clothing items is **$143**.

2. **Determine the total budget and the remaining amount.**
   - Alexis's total budget is $200.
   - She has $16 left after her purchases.

3. **Calculate the amount spent on the shoes.**
   To find out how much she spent on the shoes, we can use the following equation:

   \[
   \text{Total spent} = \text{Budget} - \text{Remaining amount}
   \]

   We know that the total spent includes the clothing items and the shoes. Therefore, we can express it as:

   \[
   \text{Total spent} = 143 + \text{Cost of shoes}
   \]

   Setting up the equation based on her budget:

   \[
   143 + \text{Cost of shoes} = 200 - 16
   \]

   Simplifying the right side:

   \[
   200 - 16 = 184
   \]

   Now we have:

   \[
   143 + \text{Cost of shoes} = 184
   \]

   To find the cost of the shoes, we subtract 143 from both sides:

   \[
   \text{Cost of shoes} = 184 - 143
   \]

   Calculating this gives:

   \[
   \text{Cost of shoes} = 41
   \]

4. **Final Answer:**
   Alexis paid **$41** for the shoes.
