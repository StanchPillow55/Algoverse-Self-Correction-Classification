==================================================

To solve the problem, we will break it down into parts and calculate the distances traveled by John during each segment of his journey.

1. **Initial Drive Away from Home:**
   - John drives for 3 hours at a speed of 60 mph.
   - Distance traveled = Speed × Time
   - Distance = 60 mph × 3 hours = 180 miles

   So, John is 180 miles away from home after his initial drive.

2. **Return Journey:**
   - John tries to get home in 4 hours but spends the first 2 hours in standstill traffic.
   - During these 2 hours, he does not cover any distance, so the distance remains 180 miles.

3. **Driving at 30 mph:**
   - After 2 hours of standstill traffic, he drives for the next half-hour (0.5 hours) at a speed of 30 mph.
   - Distance traveled = Speed × Time
   - Distance = 30 mph × 0.5 hours = 15 miles

   Now, we subtract this distance from the total distance he was from home:
   - Remaining distance from home = 180 miles - 15 miles = 165 miles

4. **Driving at 80 mph:**
   - After driving at 30 mph for 0.5 hours, he has 1.5 hours left in his 4-hour journey (4 hours - 2 hours of traffic - 0.5 hours of driving at 30 mph = 1.5 hours).
   - He drives the remaining 1.5 hours at a speed of 80 mph.
   - Distance traveled = Speed × Time
   - Distance = 80 mph × 1.5 hours = 120 miles

   Now, we subtract this distance from the remaining distance from home:
   - Remaining distance from home = 165 miles - 120 miles = 45 miles

5. **Final Calculation:**
   - At the end of the 4 hours, John is 45 miles away from home.

Thus, the final answer is:

**John is 45 miles away from home at the end of those 4 hours.**
