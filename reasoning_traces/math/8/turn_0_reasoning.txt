Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to find out how much Alexis spent on the clothes she bought. We do this by adding up the cost of the button-up shirt, suit pants, suit coat, socks, and belt. 

$30 (shirt) + $46 (pants) + $38 (coat) + $11 (socks) + $18 (belt) = $143

So, Alexis spent $143 on these items. 

Next, we need to find out how much money Alexis had left after buying these items. We do this by subtracting the cost of these items from her original budget.

$200 (original budget) - $143 (cost of items) = $57

So, Alexis had $57 left after buying the shirt, pants, coat, socks, and belt.

Finally, we need to find out how much Alexis spent on the shoes. We do this by subtracting the amount of money she has left from the amount she had after buying the other items.

$57 (money left after buying other items) - $16 (money left after buying shoes) = $41

So, Alexis spent $41 on the shoes.

Therefore, Alexis paid $41 for the shoes.
