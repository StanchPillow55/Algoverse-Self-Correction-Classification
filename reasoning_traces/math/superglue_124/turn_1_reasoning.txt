==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what is being asked. However, the question "Sample reasoning question 124" is not clear or specific enough to provide a detailed solution. It seems like a placeholder or a reference to a specific problem that is not fully described here.

To proceed, let's assume that "Sample reasoning question 124" refers to a typical math problem that requires logical reasoning and step-by-step calculations. Without specific details, I'll create a hypothetical problem and solve it to demonstrate the process of reasoning and calculation.

**Hypothetical Problem:**
A farmer has a rectangular field that is 100 meters long and 60 meters wide. He wants to divide the field into two equal parts by constructing a fence parallel to the shorter side. Calculate the length of the fence needed and the area of each part.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - The field is rectangular with dimensions 100 meters (length) and 60 meters (width).
   - The farmer wants to divide the field into two equal parts with a fence parallel to the shorter side (width).

2. **Determine the Orientation of the Fence:**
   - Since the fence is parallel to the shorter side (60 meters), it will run along the length of the field (100 meters).

3. **Calculate the Length of the Fence:**
   - The fence will be as long as the length of the field, which is 100 meters.

4. **Calculate the Area of Each Part:**
   - The total area of the field is given by the formula for the area of a rectangle: 
     \[
     \text{Area} = \text{Length} \times \text{Width} = 100 \, \text{meters} \times 60 \, \text{meters} = 6000 \, \text{square meters}
     \]
   - Since the field is divided into two equal parts, the area of each part will be half of the total area:
     \[
     \text{Area of each part} = \frac{6000 \, \text{square meters}}{2} = 3000 \, \text{square meters}
     \]

5. **Final Answer:**
   - The length of the fence needed is 100 meters.
   - The area of each part of the field is 3000 square meters.

This hypothetical problem demonstrates the process of understanding a problem, identifying what is being asked, performing calculations, and arriving at a solution. If you have a specific problem in mind, please provide more details so I can assist you accurately.
