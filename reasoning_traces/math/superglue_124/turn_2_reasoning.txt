Question ID: superglue_124
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 124" entails. Since the problem statement is not specific, I'll assume it involves a typical math problem-solving scenario. Let's create a hypothetical math problem and solve it step by step.

### Hypothetical Problem:
**Question:** If \( x + 3 = 7 \), what is the value of \( x \)?

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Understand the Equation:**
   The equation given is \( x + 3 = 7 \). This is a simple linear equation where we need to solve for \( x \).

2. **Isolate the Variable:**
   To find the value of \( x \), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We can do this by performing the same operation on both sides of the equation.

3. **Subtract 3 from Both Sides:**
   To isolate \( x \), subtract 3 from both sides of the equation:
   \[
   x + 3 - 3 = 7 - 3
   \]

4. **Simplify the Equation:**
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   x = 4
   \]

5. **Verify the Solution:**
   To ensure our solution is correct, substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation:
   \[
   4 + 3 = 7
   \]
   Since both sides of the equation are equal, our solution is verified.

### Final Answer:
The value of \( x \) is 4.

This process demonstrates a clear and logical approach to solving a basic algebraic equation. If "Sample reasoning question 124" refers to a different type of problem, please provide more details for a tailored solution.
