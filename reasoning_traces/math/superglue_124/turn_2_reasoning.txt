Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 124" entails. Since the problem statement is not explicitly given, I'll assume this is a placeholder for a typical math problem. Let's create a hypothetical math problem and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**

Let's say the problem is as follows:

"Calculate the sum of the first 124 positive integers."

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   We need to find the sum of the first 124 positive integers. This is a classic problem that can be solved using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series.

2. **Identify the Formula:**
   The sum \( S \) of the first \( n \) positive integers is given by the formula:
   \[
   S = \frac{n(n + 1)}{2}
   \]
   where \( n \) is the number of terms.

3. **Substitute the Values:**
   In this problem, \( n = 124 \). Substitute 124 into the formula:
   \[
   S = \frac{124(124 + 1)}{2}
   \]

4. **Perform the Calculations:**
   - First, calculate \( 124 + 1 \):
     \[
     124 + 1 = 125
     \]
   - Next, calculate \( 124 \times 125 \):
     \[
     124 \times 125 = 15500
     \]
   - Finally, divide by 2 to find the sum:
     \[
     S = \frac{15500}{2} = 7750
     \]

5. **Verify the Calculation:**
   To ensure accuracy, let's verify the multiplication:
   - Break down \( 124 \times 125 \) using the distributive property:
     \[
     124 \times 125 = 124 \times (100 + 25) = 124 \times 100 + 124 \times 25
     \]
   - Calculate each part:
     \[
     124 \times 100 = 12400
     \]
     \[
     124 \times 25 = 3100
     \]
   - Add the results:
     \[
     12400 + 3100 = 15500
     \]
   - Divide by 2:
     \[
     \frac{15500}{2} = 7750
     \]

6. **State the Final Answer:**
   The sum of the first 124 positive integers is \( \boxed{7750} \).

This solution demonstrates a clear understanding of the problem, the application of the arithmetic series formula, and verification of calculations to ensure accuracy.
