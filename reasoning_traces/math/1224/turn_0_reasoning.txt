==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to determine how much it will rain on Tuesday based on the information given about Monday's rainfall.

1. **Identify Monday's Rainfall**: 
   - It rained 2 inches on Monday.

2. **Determine Tuesday's Rainfall**: 
   - We are told that Tuesday's rainfall will be "1 more inch than twice of Monday’s total."
   - First, we need to calculate "twice of Monday’s total." Since Monday's total is 2 inches, we calculate:
     \[
     2 \times 2 = 4 \text{ inches}
     \]

3. **Add 1 Inch to Tuesday's Rainfall**: 
   - Now, we need to add 1 inch to the result from the previous step:
     \[
     4 \text{ inches} + 1 \text{ inch} = 5 \text{ inches}
     \]

4. **Conclusion**: 
   - Therefore, the total amount of rain expected on Tuesday is 5 inches.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\text{Tuesday's rainfall} = 5 \text{ inches}
\]
