Question ID: superglue_130
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 130" entails. Since the problem statement is not explicitly provided, I'll guide you through a general approach to solving reasoning-based math problems. This will include identifying the type of problem, breaking it down into manageable steps, and solving it systematically.

### Step 1: Identify the Type of Problem
Reasoning questions often involve logical thinking, pattern recognition, or problem-solving skills. They can be numerical, algebraic, geometric, or involve word problems. Without specific details, I'll assume a generic approach.

### Step 2: Break Down the Problem
Let's assume "Sample reasoning question 130" involves a numerical pattern or sequence. A common type of reasoning question might ask you to find the next number in a sequence or solve for a variable given a set of conditions.

### Step 3: Solve the Problem
#### Example Problem: Find the next number in the sequence 2, 4, 8, 16, ...

1. **Identify the Pattern:**
   - Look at the differences or ratios between consecutive numbers.
   - Here, each number is double the previous one: \(4 = 2 \times 2\), \(8 = 4 \times 2\), \(16 = 8 \times 2\).

2. **Apply the Pattern:**
   - To find the next number, continue the pattern.
   - The next number after 16 is \(16 \times 2 = 32\).

3. **Verify the Pattern:**
   - Check if the pattern holds for all given numbers.
   - Yes, each number is indeed double the previous one.

### Step 4: State the Final Answer
For the example sequence, the next number is 32.

### Conclusion
Without the specific details of "Sample reasoning question 130," I provided a general method for approaching reasoning problems. If you have a specific problem or more details, please provide them, and I can offer a more targeted solution.
