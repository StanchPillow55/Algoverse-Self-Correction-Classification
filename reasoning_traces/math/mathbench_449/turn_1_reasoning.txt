==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample math problem 449" entails. Since the problem isn't explicitly stated, let's assume it's a placeholder for a typical math problem. For demonstration purposes, let's create a sample math problem and solve it step by step.

**Sample Math Problem 449:**

**Problem:**  
A rectangle has a length that is 3 times its width. If the perimeter of the rectangle is 48 units, find the dimensions of the rectangle.

**Solution:**

1. **Understand the problem:**  
   We need to find the length and width of a rectangle given that the length is 3 times the width and the perimeter is 48 units.

2. **Define variables:**  
   Let \( w \) be the width of the rectangle.  
   Then, the length \( l \) is \( 3w \).

3. **Use the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle:**  
   The perimeter \( P \) of a rectangle is given by the formula:  
   \[
   P = 2l + 2w
   \]

4. **Substitute the known values into the formula:**  
   We know the perimeter is 48 units, so:  
   \[
   48 = 2(3w) + 2w
   \]

5. **Simplify and solve for \( w \):**  
   \[
   48 = 6w + 2w
   \]  
   \[
   48 = 8w
   \]  
   Divide both sides by 8:  
   \[
   w = \frac{48}{8} = 6
   \]

6. **Find the length using the width:**  
   Since the length \( l \) is 3 times the width:  
   \[
   l = 3w = 3 \times 6 = 18
   \]

7. **Verify the solution:**  
   Check if the dimensions satisfy the perimeter condition:  
   \[
   P = 2l + 2w = 2(18) + 2(6) = 36 + 12 = 48
   \]  
   The calculated perimeter matches the given perimeter, confirming our solution is correct.

**Final Answer:**  
The dimensions of the rectangle are:  
Width = 6 units  
Length = 18 units
