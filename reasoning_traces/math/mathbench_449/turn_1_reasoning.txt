==================================================

To solve "Sample math problem 449," we need to first understand what the problem is asking. Since the problem statement is not provided, I'll create a hypothetical math problem and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem 449:**

"Calculate the area of a triangle with a base of 8 cm and a height of 5 cm."

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Formula:**
   The area \( A \) of a triangle can be calculated using the formula:
   \[
   A = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height}
   \]

2. **Identify the Given Values:**
   - Base (\( b \)) = 8 cm
   - Height (\( h \)) = 5 cm

3. **Substitute the Values into the Formula:**
   \[
   A = \frac{1}{2} \times 8 \times 5
   \]

4. **Perform the Multiplication:**
   First, multiply the base and the height:
   \[
   8 \times 5 = 40
   \]

5. **Calculate the Area:**
   Now, multiply the result by \(\frac{1}{2}\):
   \[
   A = \frac{1}{2} \times 40 = 20
   \]

6. **State the Final Answer:**
   The area of the triangle is 20 square centimeters.

By following these steps, we have calculated the area of the triangle using the given base and height. The final answer is:

**Final Answer:**
The area of the triangle is 20 cmÂ².
