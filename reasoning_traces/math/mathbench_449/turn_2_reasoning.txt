==================================================

To solve the problem labeled "Sample math problem 449," I need more specific details about the problem itself. Since the problem statement is not provided, I'll walk you through a general approach to solving math problems, which you can apply once you have the specific details of the problem.

### General Approach to Solving Math Problems

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - Carefully read the problem statement.
   - Identify what is being asked.
   - Determine what information is given and what needs to be found.

2. **Devise a Plan:**
   - Consider possible strategies to solve the problem. This could include:
     - Drawing a diagram.
     - Writing an equation.
     - Breaking the problem into smaller parts.
     - Looking for patterns.
     - Using logical reasoning.

3. **Carry Out the Plan:**
   - Execute the chosen strategy step by step.
   - Perform calculations carefully.
   - Keep track of units and ensure consistency.

4. **Check Your Work:**
   - Verify each step of your solution.
   - Check if the final answer makes sense in the context of the problem.
   - Review calculations for accuracy.

5. **State the Final Answer:**
   - Clearly write down the final answer.
   - Include units if applicable.

### Example Problem and Solution

Since I don't have the specific details of "Sample math problem 449," I'll demonstrate the approach with a generic example problem:

**Example Problem:**
Find the value of \( x \) if \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).

**Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We need to solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).

2. **Devise a Plan:**
   - Isolate \( x \) by performing algebraic operations.

3. **Carry Out the Plan:**
   - Subtract 3 from both sides of the equation:
     \[
     2x + 3 - 3 = 11 - 3
     \]
     \[
     2x = 8
     \]
   - Divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( x \):
     \[
     \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{8}{2}
     \]
     \[
     x = 4
     \]

4. **Check Your Work:**
   - Substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation to verify:
     \[
     2(4) + 3 = 8 + 3 = 11
     \]
   - The left side equals the right side, so the solution is correct.

5. **State the Final Answer:**
   - The value of \( x \) is 4.

If you provide the specific details of "Sample math problem 449," I can apply this structured approach to solve it.
