==================================================

To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step.

1. **Calculate the number of people who think horse #2 will win:**
   We know that 20% of 50 people think horse #2 will win. To find this number, we calculate:
   \[
   \text{Number of people who think horse #2 will win} = 20\% \times 50 = \frac{20}{100} \times 50 = 10
   \]

2. **Determine the number of remaining people:**
   After accounting for the 10 people who think horse #2 will win, we find the remaining number of people:
   \[
   \text{Remaining people} = 50 - 10 = 40
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of people who think horse #7 will win:**
   We know that 60% of the remaining 40 people think horse #7 will win. We calculate this as follows:
   \[
   \text{Number of people who think horse #7 will win} = 60\% \times 40 = \frac{60}{100} \times 40 = 24
   \]

4. **Determine the number of people who think horse #12 will win:**
   To find out how many people think horse #12 will win, we need to subtract the number of people who think horse #2 and horse #7 will win from the total number of people:
   \[
   \text{Number of people who think horse #12 will win} = \text{Total people} - (\text{People for horse #2} + \text{People for horse #7})
   \]
   Substituting the values we found:
   \[
   \text{Number of people who think horse #12 will win} = 50 - (10 + 24) = 50 - 34 = 16
   \]

5. **Final Answer:**
   Therefore, the number of people who think horse #12 will win is:
   \[
   \boxed{16}
   \]
