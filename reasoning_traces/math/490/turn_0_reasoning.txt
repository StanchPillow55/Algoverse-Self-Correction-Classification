To find the length of the third side of the triangle, we can use the formula for the perimeter of a triangle. The perimeter \( P \) is the sum of the lengths of all three sides.

Given:
- The perimeter \( P = 160 \) cm
- The lengths of two sides \( a = 40 \) cm and \( b = 50 \) cm

Let the length of the third side be \( c \).

The formula for the perimeter of the triangle is:
\[
P = a + b + c
\]

Substituting the known values into the formula:
\[
160 = 40 + 50 + c
\]

Now, we can simplify the right side:
\[
160 = 90 + c
\]

Next, we need to isolate \( c \). To do this, we subtract 90 from both sides:
\[
c = 160 - 90
\]
\[
c = 70
\]

Thus, the length of the third side is \( 70 \) cm.

Finally, we can summarize our findings:
- The perimeter of the triangle is 160 cm.
- The lengths of the two known sides are 40 cm and 50 cm.
- The calculated length of the third side is 70 cm.

Therefore, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{70 \text{ cm}}
\]
