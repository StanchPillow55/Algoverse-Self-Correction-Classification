==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to find the length of the third side of the triangle given that the perimeter is 160 cm and two of the sides are 40 cm and 50 cm.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Understand the Perimeter Formula for a Triangle:**
   The perimeter of a triangle is the sum of the lengths of its three sides. If we denote the sides of the triangle as \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \), then the perimeter \( P \) is given by:
   \[
   P = a + b + c
   \]

2. **Substitute the Known Values:**
   We are given:
   - The perimeter \( P = 160 \) cm
   - Two sides of the triangle: \( a = 40 \) cm and \( b = 50 \) cm

   We need to find the third side, which we will denote as \( c \).

3. **Set Up the Equation:**
   Substitute the known values into the perimeter formula:
   \[
   160 = 40 + 50 + c
   \]

4. **Solve for \( c \):**
   Simplify the equation:
   \[
   160 = 90 + c
   \]

   To isolate \( c \), subtract 90 from both sides:
   \[
   c = 160 - 90
   \]

   Calculate the result:
   \[
   c = 70
   \]

5. **Conclusion:**
   The length of the third side of the triangle is 70 cm.

### Final Answer:
The length of the third side of the triangle is \( \boxed{70} \) cm.
