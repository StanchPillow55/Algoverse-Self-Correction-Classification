Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to find the length of the third side of a triangle given the perimeter and the lengths of the other two sides.

**Step 1: Understand the problem**

We are given:
- The perimeter of the triangle is 160 cm.
- Two sides of the triangle are 40 cm and 50 cm.

We need to find the length of the third side.

**Step 2: Recall the formula for the perimeter of a triangle**

The perimeter \( P \) of a triangle is the sum of the lengths of its three sides. If the sides are denoted as \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \), then:

\[ P = a + b + c \]

**Step 3: Substitute the known values into the formula**

We know:
- \( P = 160 \) cm
- \( a = 40 \) cm
- \( b = 50 \) cm

We need to find \( c \).

Substitute the known values into the perimeter formula:

\[ 160 = 40 + 50 + c \]

**Step 4: Solve for the unknown side \( c \)**

First, add the known side lengths:

\[ 40 + 50 = 90 \]

Now substitute back into the equation:

\[ 160 = 90 + c \]

To find \( c \), subtract 90 from both sides:

\[ c = 160 - 90 \]

\[ c = 70 \]

**Step 5: Verify the solution**

To ensure the solution is correct, check that the sum of all three sides equals the given perimeter:

\[ 40 + 50 + 70 = 160 \]

The calculation is correct, as the sum of the sides equals the perimeter.

**Final Answer:**

The length of the third side is 70 cm.
