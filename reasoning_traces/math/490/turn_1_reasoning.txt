==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine the length of the third side of a triangle given that the perimeter of the triangle is 160 cm and two of its sides are 40 cm and 50 cm.

### Step-by-step Solution:

1. **Understand the Perimeter of a Triangle:**
   The perimeter of a triangle is the sum of the lengths of all its sides. If we denote the sides of the triangle as \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \), then the perimeter \( P \) is given by:
   \[
   P = a + b + c
   \]

2. **Given Values:**
   - The perimeter \( P = 160 \) cm.
   - Two sides of the triangle are \( a = 40 \) cm and \( b = 50 \) cm.

3. **Set Up the Equation:**
   We need to find the length of the third side, which we'll denote as \( c \). Using the formula for the perimeter, we have:
   \[
   40 + 50 + c = 160
   \]

4. **Solve for \( c \):**
   Combine the known side lengths:
   \[
   90 + c = 160
   \]
   To isolate \( c \), subtract 90 from both sides:
   \[
   c = 160 - 90
   \]
   \[
   c = 70
   \]

5. **Conclusion:**
   The length of the third side of the triangle is 70 cm.

### Final Answer:
The length of the third side of the triangle is \( \boxed{70} \) cm.
