==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to find the length of the third side of a triangle given the perimeter and the lengths of the other two sides.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We are given that the perimeter of the triangle is 160 cm.
   - Two sides of the triangle are given as 40 cm and 50 cm.
   - We need to find the length of the third side.

2. **Recall the Formula for the Perimeter of a Triangle:**
   - The perimeter of a triangle is the sum of the lengths of all its sides.
   - If the sides of the triangle are \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \), then the perimeter \( P \) is given by:
     \[
     P = a + b + c
     \]

3. **Assign Known Values:**
   - Let the sides of the triangle be \( a = 40 \) cm, \( b = 50 \) cm, and \( c \) be the unknown side we need to find.
   - The perimeter \( P \) is given as 160 cm.

4. **Set Up the Equation:**
   - Substitute the known values into the perimeter formula:
     \[
     160 = 40 + 50 + c
     \]

5. **Solve for the Unknown Side \( c \):**
   - First, calculate the sum of the known sides:
     \[
     40 + 50 = 90
     \]
   - Substitute this back into the equation:
     \[
     160 = 90 + c
     \]
   - To find \( c \), subtract 90 from both sides of the equation:
     \[
     c = 160 - 90
     \]
   - Calculate the result:
     \[
     c = 70
     \]

6. **Conclusion:**
   - The length of the third side of the triangle is 70 cm.

### Final Answer:
The length of the third side of the triangle is 70 cm.
