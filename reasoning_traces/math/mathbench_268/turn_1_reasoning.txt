==================================================

To solve the problem, I'll need more specific information about "Sample math problem 268." Since I don't have access to external databases or specific problem sets, I'll create a hypothetical math problem and solve it step by step. If you have a specific problem in mind, please provide the details.

Let's assume "Sample math problem 268" is the following:

**Problem:**
Solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 3x + 5 = 20 \).

**Solution:**

Step 1: Understand the equation.
- We have a linear equation in one variable: \( 3x + 5 = 20 \).

Step 2: Isolate the variable term.
- To solve for \( x \), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We start by eliminating the constant term on the left side. We do this by subtracting 5 from both sides of the equation.

\[
3x + 5 - 5 = 20 - 5
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
3x = 15
\]

Step 3: Solve for \( x \).
- Now, we need to solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides of the equation by 3, which is the coefficient of \( x \).

\[
\frac{3x}{3} = \frac{15}{3}
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
x = 5
\]

Step 4: Verify the solution.
- To ensure our solution is correct, we substitute \( x = 5 \) back into the original equation to check if it satisfies the equation.

Original equation: \( 3x + 5 = 20 \)

Substitute \( x = 5 \):

\[
3(5) + 5 = 20
\]

Calculate the left side:

\[
15 + 5 = 20
\]

Since both sides of the equation are equal, our solution is verified.

**Final Answer:**
\( x = 5 \)

This is the complete solution to the hypothetical problem. If you have a different problem in mind, please provide the details, and I'll be happy to solve it for you.
