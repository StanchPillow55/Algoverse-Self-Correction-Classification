Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, I need more specific information about "Sample math problem 268." Since the problem is not provided, I'll demonstrate how to solve a generic math problem using a step-by-step approach. Let's assume a sample math problem:

**Problem:** Solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).

**Step 1: Understand the Problem**
The equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \) is a linear equation in one variable. Our goal is to find the value of \( x \) that makes this equation true.

**Step 2: Isolate the Variable**
To solve for \( x \), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We can do this by performing inverse operations.

**Step 3: Perform Inverse Operations**
- First, subtract 3 from both sides of the equation to eliminate the constant term on the left side:
  \[
  2x + 3 - 3 = 11 - 3
  \]
  Simplifying both sides gives:
  \[
  2x = 8
  \]

- Next, divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( x \):
  \[
  \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{8}{2}
  \]
  Simplifying both sides gives:
  \[
  x = 4
  \]

**Step 4: Verify the Solution**
To ensure our solution is correct, substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation:
\[
2(4) + 3 = 11
\]
Simplifying the left side gives:
\[
8 + 3 = 11
\]
Since both sides of the equation are equal, our solution \( x = 4 \) is verified.

**Final Answer**
The solution to the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \) is \( x = 4 \).
