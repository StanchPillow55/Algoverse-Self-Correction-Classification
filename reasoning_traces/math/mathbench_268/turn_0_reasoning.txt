To solve the problem, I need more information about "Sample math problem 268" as it is not specified in your question. However, I can guide you through a general approach to solving math problems step by step. If you provide the specific details of the problem, I can give a more tailored solution. Hereâ€™s a general approach:

### Step-by-Step Approach to Solving a Math Problem

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - Read the problem carefully.
   - Identify what is being asked.
   - Determine what information is given and what needs to be found.

2. **Devise a Plan:**
   - Think about the strategies that can be used to solve the problem. This could involve algebraic manipulation, drawing a diagram, using a formula, etc.
   - Consider similar problems you have solved before and how they might inform your approach.

3. **Carry Out the Plan:**
   - Execute your chosen strategy step by step.
   - Perform calculations carefully, showing all your work.
   - Keep track of units and ensure consistency throughout the problem.

4. **Review/Check Your Work:**
   - Verify each step of your solution.
   - Check if your final answer makes sense in the context of the problem.
   - Re-calculate if necessary to ensure accuracy.

5. **State the Final Answer:**
   - Clearly write down the final answer, ensuring it answers the question posed.
   - Include units if applicable.

### Example Problem and Solution

**Problem:**
Solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).

**Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We need to find the value of \( x \) that satisfies the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).

2. **Devise a Plan:**
   - We can isolate \( x \) by performing algebraic operations.

3. **Carry Out the Plan:**
   - Start by subtracting 3 from both sides of the equation:
     \[
     2x + 3 - 3 = 11 - 3
     \]
     \[
     2x = 8
     \]
   - Next, divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( x \):
     \[
     \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{8}{2}
     \]
     \[
     x = 4
     \]

4. **Review/Check Your Work:**
   - Substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation to verify:
     \[
     2(4) + 3 = 8 + 3 = 11
     \]
   - The left side equals the right side, confirming our solution is correct.

5. **State the Final Answer:**
   - The solution to the equation is \( x = 4 \).
