Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we will follow these steps:

1. **Determine Andy's weight after gaining weight.**
2. **Calculate the weight loss over the next 3 months.**
3. **Find the difference between his initial weight and his final weight.**

### Step 1: Determine Andy's weight after gaining weight.

Andy started the year weighing 156 pounds and gained 36 pounds. We can calculate his new weight as follows:

\[
\text{New Weight} = \text{Initial Weight} + \text{Weight Gained}
\]
\[
\text{New Weight} = 156 \text{ pounds} + 36 \text{ pounds} = 192 \text{ pounds}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the weight loss over the next 3 months.

Andy lost an eighth of his weight every month for 3 months. First, we need to calculate how much weight he loses each month.

**Weight loss per month:**
\[
\text{Weight Loss per Month} = \frac{1}{8} \times \text{Current Weight}
\]

**Calculating the weight loss for each month:**

- **Month 1:**
  \[
  \text{Weight Loss Month 1} = \frac{1}{8} \times 192 = 24 \text{ pounds}
  \]
  \[
  \text{Weight after Month 1} = 192 - 24 = 168 \text{ pounds}
  \]

- **Month 2:**
  \[
  \text{Weight Loss Month 2} = \frac{1}{8} \times 168 = 21 \text{ pounds}
  \]
  \[
  \text{Weight after Month 2} = 168 - 21 = 147 \text{ pounds}
  \]

- **Month 3:**
  \[
  \text{Weight Loss Month 3} = \frac{1}{8} \times 147 = 18.375 \text{ pounds}
  \]
  \[
  \text{Weight after Month 3} = 147 - 18.375 = 128.625 \text{ pounds}
  \]

### Step 3: Find the difference between his initial weight and his final weight.

Now we will calculate how much less Andy weighs now compared to the beginning of the year.

\[
\text{Difference in Weight} = \text{Initial Weight} - \text{Final Weight}
\]
\[
\text{Difference in Weight} = 156 \text{ pounds} - 128.625 \text{ pounds} = 27.375 \text{ pounds}
\]

### Final Answer

Andy weighs **27.375 pounds** less now than at the beginning of the year.
