Question ID: 483
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to track Andy's weight changes throughout the year and calculate how much less he weighs now compared to the beginning of the year.

1. **Initial Weight:**
   - Andy started the year weighing 156 pounds.

2. **Weight Gain:**
   - Andy gained 36 pounds after growing 3 inches.
   - New weight after gaining 36 pounds: 
     \[
     156 \text{ pounds} + 36 \text{ pounds} = 192 \text{ pounds}
     \]

3. **Weight Loss Over 3 Months:**
   - Andy loses an eighth of his weight each month for 3 months.
   - We need to calculate his weight at the end of each month.

   **Month 1:**
   - Weight loss in the first month:
     \[
     \frac{1}{8} \times 192 = 24 \text{ pounds}
     \]
   - New weight after the first month:
     \[
     192 - 24 = 168 \text{ pounds}
     \]

   **Month 2:**
   - Weight loss in the second month:
     \[
     \frac{1}{8} \times 168 = 21 \text{ pounds}
     \]
   - New weight after the second month:
     \[
     168 - 21 = 147 \text{ pounds}
     \]

   **Month 3:**
   - Weight loss in the third month:
     \[
     \frac{1}{8} \times 147 = 18.375 \text{ pounds}
     \]
   - New weight after the third month:
     \[
     147 - 18.375 = 128.625 \text{ pounds}
     \]

4. **Final Calculation:**
   - Andy's weight at the beginning of the year was 156 pounds.
   - His weight after 3 months of exercise is 128.625 pounds.
   - The difference in weight from the beginning of the year:
     \[
     156 - 128.625 = 27.375 \text{ pounds}
     \]

Therefore, Andy weighs 27.375 pounds less now than at the beginning of the year.

**Final Answer:**
Andy weighs 27.375 pounds less now than at the beginning of the year.
