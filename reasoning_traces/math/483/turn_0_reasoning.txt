To solve the problem, we will follow these steps:

1. **Determine Andy's weight after gaining weight.**
2. **Calculate the weight loss over the next 3 months.**
3. **Find the difference between his initial weight and his final weight.**

### Step 1: Determine Andy's weight after gaining weight

Andy started the year weighing 156 pounds and gained 36 pounds. We can calculate his new weight as follows:

\[
\text{New Weight} = \text{Initial Weight} + \text{Weight Gained}
\]
\[
\text{New Weight} = 156 \text{ pounds} + 36 \text{ pounds} = 192 \text{ pounds}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the weight loss over the next 3 months

Andy lost an eighth of his weight every month for 3 months. We need to calculate how much weight he loses each month and then the total weight lost over the 3 months.

**Weight loss in the first month:**

\[
\text{Weight Loss (Month 1)} = \frac{1}{8} \times 192 \text{ pounds} = 24 \text{ pounds}
\]

After the first month, his weight will be:

\[
\text{Weight after Month 1} = 192 \text{ pounds} - 24 \text{ pounds} = 168 \text{ pounds}
\]

**Weight loss in the second month:**

Now, we calculate the weight loss based on his new weight:

\[
\text{Weight Loss (Month 2)} = \frac{1}{8} \times 168 \text{ pounds} = 21 \text{ pounds}
\]

After the second month, his weight will be:

\[
\text{Weight after Month 2} = 168 \text{ pounds} - 21 \text{ pounds} = 147 \text{ pounds}
\]

**Weight loss in the third month:**

Again, we calculate the weight loss based on his new weight:

\[
\text{Weight Loss (Month 3)} = \frac{1}{8} \times 147 \text{ pounds} = 18.375 \text{ pounds}
\]

After the third month, his weight will be:

\[
\text{Weight after Month 3} = 147 \text{ pounds} - 18.375 \text{ pounds} = 128.625 \text{ pounds}
\]

### Step 3: Find the difference between his initial weight and his final weight

Now we can find out how much less Andy weighs now compared to the beginning of the year:

\[
\text{Weight Difference} = \text{Initial Weight} - \text{Final Weight}
\]
\[
\text{Weight Difference} = 156 \text{ pounds} - 128.625 \text{ pounds} = 27.375 \text{ pounds}
\]

### Final Answer

Andy weighs **27.375 pounds less** now than at the beginning of the year.
