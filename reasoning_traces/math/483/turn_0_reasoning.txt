To solve this problem, we need to track Andy's weight changes over the course of the year and determine how much less he weighs now compared to the beginning of the year.

1. **Initial Weight:**
   - Andy started the year weighing 156 pounds.

2. **Weight Gain:**
   - Andy gained 36 pounds.
   - New weight after gaining: 
     \[
     156 \text{ pounds} + 36 \text{ pounds} = 192 \text{ pounds}
     \]

3. **Weight Loss Over 3 Months:**
   - Andy loses an eighth of his weight every month for 3 months.
   - We will calculate his weight at the end of each month.

   **Month 1:**
   - Weight loss in the first month:
     \[
     \frac{1}{8} \times 192 = 24 \text{ pounds}
     \]
   - New weight after first month:
     \[
     192 - 24 = 168 \text{ pounds}
     \]

   **Month 2:**
   - Weight loss in the second month:
     \[
     \frac{1}{8} \times 168 = 21 \text{ pounds}
     \]
   - New weight after second month:
     \[
     168 - 21 = 147 \text{ pounds}
     \]

   **Month 3:**
   - Weight loss in the third month:
     \[
     \frac{1}{8} \times 147 = 18.375 \text{ pounds}
     \]
   - New weight after third month:
     \[
     147 - 18.375 = 128.625 \text{ pounds}
     \]

4. **Final Calculation:**
   - Andy's final weight is 128.625 pounds.
   - To find out how much less Andy weighs now than at the beginning of the year:
     \[
     156 - 128.625 = 27.375 \text{ pounds}
     \]

Therefore, Andy weighs 27.375 pounds less now than at the beginning of the year.

**Final Answer:**
Andy weighs 27.375 pounds less now than at the beginning of the year.
