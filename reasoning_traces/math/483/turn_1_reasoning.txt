Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we will break it down into several steps:

1. **Determine Andy's weight after gaining weight**:
   - Initial weight: 156 pounds
   - Weight gained: 36 pounds
   - New weight = Initial weight + Weight gained
   \[
   \text{New weight} = 156 + 36 = 192 \text{ pounds}
   \]

2. **Calculate the weight loss over the next 3 months**:
   - Andy loses an eighth of his weight every month. We need to calculate how much weight he loses each month and then subtract that from his current weight.
   - First, we find out how much weight he loses in the first month:
   \[
   \text{Weight loss in month 1} = \frac{1}{8} \times 192 = 24 \text{ pounds}
   \]
   - After the first month, his weight will be:
   \[
   \text{Weight after month 1} = 192 - 24 = 168 \text{ pounds}
   \]

   - Now, we calculate the weight loss for the second month:
   \[
   \text{Weight loss in month 2} = \frac{1}{8} \times 168 = 21 \text{ pounds}
   \]
   - After the second month, his weight will be:
   \[
   \text{Weight after month 2} = 168 - 21 = 147 \text{ pounds}
   \]

   - Next, we calculate the weight loss for the third month:
   \[
   \text{Weight loss in month 3} = \frac{1}{8} \times 147 = 18.375 \text{ pounds}
   \]
   - After the third month, his weight will be:
   \[
   \text{Weight after month 3} = 147 - 18.375 = 128.625 \text{ pounds}
   \]

3. **Calculate how much less Andy weighs now compared to the beginning of the year**:
   - We need to find the difference between his initial weight and his weight after 3 months:
   \[
   \text{Weight difference} = \text{Initial weight} - \text{Weight after 3 months}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Weight difference} = 156 - 128.625 = 27.375 \text{ pounds}
   \]

Thus, Andy weighs **27.375 pounds less** than he did at the beginning of the year.

**Final Answer**: Andy weighs 27.375 pounds less than at the beginning of the year.
