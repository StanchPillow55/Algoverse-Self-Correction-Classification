To determine how much money David has left after buying the bolts, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total cost of the bolts**: 
   David wants to buy 16 bolts, and each bolt costs $0.03. We can find the total cost by multiplying the number of bolts by the cost per bolt.

   \[
   \text{Total cost} = \text{Number of bolts} \times \text{Cost per bolt}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = 16 \times 0.03
   \]

   Now, let's perform the multiplication:

   \[
   16 \times 0.03 = 0.48
   \]

   So, the total cost for 16 bolts is $0.48.

2. **Subtract the total cost from the amount David has**:
   David initially has $12.48. To find out how much money he has left after buying the bolts, we subtract the total cost from his initial amount.

   \[
   \text{Money left} = \text{Initial amount} - \text{Total cost}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Money left} = 12.48 - 0.48
   \]

   Now, let's perform the subtraction:

   \[
   12.48 - 0.48 = 12.00
   \]

3. **Final answer**:
   After buying the bolts, David has $12.00 left.

Thus, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{12.00}
\]
