==================================================

To solve the problem, we first need to understand what "Sample math problem 27" refers to. Since the problem is not explicitly stated, I'll assume a generic math problem and solve it step by step. Let's consider a common type of problem such as solving a quadratic equation, which is a typical math problem one might encounter.

**Problem: Solve the quadratic equation \(2x^2 - 4x - 6 = 0\).**

**Step 1: Identify the coefficients.**

The standard form of a quadratic equation is \(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\). For the equation \(2x^2 - 4x - 6 = 0\), the coefficients are:
- \(a = 2\)
- \(b = -4\)
- \(c = -6\)

**Step 2: Calculate the discriminant.**

The discriminant (\(\Delta\)) of a quadratic equation is given by the formula \(\Delta = b^2 - 4ac\). It helps determine the nature of the roots.

\[
\Delta = (-4)^2 - 4 \times 2 \times (-6) = 16 + 48 = 64
\]

Since the discriminant is positive (\(\Delta > 0\)), the equation has two distinct real roots.

**Step 3: Use the quadratic formula to find the roots.**

The quadratic formula is given by:

\[
x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{\Delta}}{2a}
\]

Substitute the values of \(a\), \(b\), and \(\Delta\) into the formula:

\[
x = \frac{-(-4) \pm \sqrt{64}}{2 \times 2} = \frac{4 \pm 8}{4}
\]

**Step 4: Calculate the two possible values for \(x\).**

1. For the positive square root:

\[
x_1 = \frac{4 + 8}{4} = \frac{12}{4} = 3
\]

2. For the negative square root:

\[
x_2 = \frac{4 - 8}{4} = \frac{-4}{4} = -1
\]

**Final Answer:**

The solutions to the quadratic equation \(2x^2 - 4x - 6 = 0\) are \(x = 3\) and \(x = -1\).
