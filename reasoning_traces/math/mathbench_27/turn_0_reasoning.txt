Dataset Type: math
==================================================

It seems like there is a misunderstanding. "Sample math problem 27" does not provide enough information for me to solve a specific math problem. To assist you effectively, I need a complete and specific math problem statement. 

For example, if you have a problem like "Solve for x: 2x + 3 = 11," I can walk you through the solution. Please provide the full details of the math problem you would like me to solve.
