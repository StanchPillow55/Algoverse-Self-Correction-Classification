To find out how long John's trip took, we need to calculate the time taken for each segment of his journey: the trip to his friend's house and the trip back home.

### Step 1: Calculate the time taken to drive to his friend's house.

1. **Distance to friend's house**: 200 miles + 10 miles (detour) = 210 miles
2. **Speed**: 70 mph

Using the formula for time, which is:

\[
\text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}}
\]

we can calculate the time taken to drive to his friend's house:

\[
\text{Time to friend's house} = \frac{210 \text{ miles}}{70 \text{ mph}} = 3 \text{ hours}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the time taken to drive back home.

1. **Distance back home**: 240 miles
2. **Speed**: 80 mph

Using the same formula for time:

\[
\text{Time back home} = \frac{240 \text{ miles}}{80 \text{ mph}} = 3 \text{ hours}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the total time for the trip.

Now, we add the time taken for both segments of the trip:

\[
\text{Total time} = \text{Time to friend's house} + \text{Time back home} = 3 \text{ hours} + 3 \text{ hours} = 6 \text{ hours}
\]

### Final Answer

The total time for John's trip is **6 hours**.
