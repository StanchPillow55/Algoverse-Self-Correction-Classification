==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine the cost of a bunch of bananas. Let's define the variables and set up the equations based on the information given:

Let:
- \( A \) be the cost of one dozen apples.
- \( B \) be the cost of one bunch of bananas.

From the problem, we have the following information:

1. Tony paid $7 for 2 dozen apples and 1 bunch of bananas.
2. Arnold paid $5 for 1 dozen apples and 1 bunch of bananas.

We can translate these statements into equations:

1. For Tony: 
   \[
   2A + B = 7
   \]

2. For Arnold:
   \[
   A + B = 5
   \]

Now, we have a system of two linear equations:

\[
\begin{align*}
2A + B &= 7 \quad \text{(Equation 1)} \\
A + B &= 5 \quad \text{(Equation 2)}
\end{align*}
\]

To find the value of \( B \), we can eliminate \( A \) by subtracting Equation 2 from Equation 1:

\[
(2A + B) - (A + B) = 7 - 5
\]

Simplifying the left side:

\[
2A + B - A - B = 2
\]

This reduces to:

\[
A = 2
\]

Now that we know \( A = 2 \), we can substitute this value back into Equation 2 to find \( B \):

\[
A + B = 5
\]

Substitute \( A = 2 \):

\[
2 + B = 5
\]

Subtract 2 from both sides:

\[
B = 3
\]

Thus, the cost of a bunch of bananas is \( \boxed{3} \).
