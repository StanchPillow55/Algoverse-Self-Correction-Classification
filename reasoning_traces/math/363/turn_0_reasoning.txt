==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to set up equations based on the information given about the costs of apples and bananas.

Let:
- \( x \) = cost of one dozen apples
- \( y \) = cost of one bunch of bananas

From the problem, we have the following information:

1. Tony paid $7 for 2 dozen apples and 1 bunch of bananas.
2. Arnold paid $5 for 1 dozen apples and 1 bunch of bananas.

We can translate this information into equations.

### Step 1: Set up the equations

From Tony's purchase:
- The cost for 2 dozen apples is \( 2x \).
- The total cost for Tony's purchase can be expressed as:
  \[
  2x + y = 7 \quad \text{(Equation 1)}
  \]

From Arnold's purchase:
- The cost for 1 dozen apples is \( x \).
- The total cost for Arnold's purchase can be expressed as:
  \[
  x + y = 5 \quad \text{(Equation 2)}
  \]

### Step 2: Solve the equations

Now we have a system of two equations:
1. \( 2x + y = 7 \)
2. \( x + y = 5 \)

We can solve this system using substitution or elimination. Here, we will use substitution.

From Equation 2, we can express \( y \) in terms of \( x \):
\[
y = 5 - x \quad \text{(Equation 3)}
\]

Now, we substitute Equation 3 into Equation 1:
\[
2x + (5 - x) = 7
\]

### Step 3: Simplify and solve for \( x \)

Now simplify the equation:
\[
2x + 5 - x = 7
\]
\[
x + 5 = 7
\]
\[
x = 7 - 5
\]
\[
x = 2
\]

### Step 4: Find \( y \)

Now that we have \( x \), we can find \( y \) using Equation 3:
\[
y = 5 - x = 5 - 2 = 3
\]

### Conclusion

The cost of one bunch of bananas, \( y \), is:
\[
\boxed{3}
\] 

Thus, a bunch of bananas costs $3.
