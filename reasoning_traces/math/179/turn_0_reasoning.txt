==================================================

To find out how much Lloyd earned for the first two weeks of tutoring, we need to calculate his earnings for each week separately and then sum them up.

**Step 1: Calculate earnings for the first week.**

Lloyd earns $10 per hour. For the first week, he tutored for 5 hours. 

To find his earnings for the first week, we multiply his hourly rate by the number of hours he worked:

\[
\text{Earnings for the first week} = \text{Hourly rate} \times \text{Hours worked}
\]
\[
\text{Earnings for the first week} = 10 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 5 \, \text{hours} = 50 \, \text{dollars}
\]

**Step 2: Calculate earnings for the second week.**

For the second week, Lloyd tutored for 8 hours. We will use the same formula to calculate his earnings for this week:

\[
\text{Earnings for the second week} = \text{Hourly rate} \times \text{Hours worked}
\]
\[
\text{Earnings for the second week} = 10 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 8 \, \text{hours} = 80 \, \text{dollars}
\]

**Step 3: Calculate total earnings for the two weeks.**

Now, we will add the earnings from both weeks to find the total earnings:

\[
\text{Total earnings} = \text{Earnings for the first week} + \text{Earnings for the second week}
\]
\[
\text{Total earnings} = 50 \, \text{dollars} + 80 \, \text{dollars} = 130 \, \text{dollars}
\]

**Final Answer:**

Lloyd earned a total of **$130** for the first two weeks of tutoring.
