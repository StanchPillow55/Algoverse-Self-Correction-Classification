To solve this problem, we need to determine how many stickers Colton gave away and subtract that from the total number of stickers he initially had. Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Number of Stickers:**
   - Colton starts with 72 dolphin stickers.

2. **Stickers Given to 3 Friends:**
   - Colton gives 4 stickers to each of his 3 friends.
   - Total stickers given to these 3 friends = \( 4 \times 3 = 12 \) stickers.

3. **Stickers Given to Mandy:**
   - Colton gives Mandy 2 more stickers than the total he gave to his 3 friends.
   - Total given to 3 friends = 12 stickers.
   - Therefore, stickers given to Mandy = \( 12 + 2 = 14 \) stickers.

4. **Stickers Given to Justin:**
   - Colton gives Justin 10 less than what he gave Mandy.
   - Stickers given to Mandy = 14 stickers.
   - Therefore, stickers given to Justin = \( 14 - 10 = 4 \) stickers.

5. **Total Stickers Given Away:**
   - Total stickers given to 3 friends = 12 stickers.
   - Stickers given to Mandy = 14 stickers.
   - Stickers given to Justin = 4 stickers.
   - Total stickers given away = \( 12 + 14 + 4 = 30 \) stickers.

6. **Stickers Colton Has Left:**
   - Colton started with 72 stickers.
   - He gave away a total of 30 stickers.
   - Stickers left = \( 72 - 30 = 42 \) stickers.

Therefore, Colton has 42 stickers left.

**Final Answer: 42 stickers**
