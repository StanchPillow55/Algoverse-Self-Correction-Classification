To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the total number of stickers given to the three friends:**
   Colton gave 4 stickers each to 3 friends. We can calculate the total stickers given to these friends as follows:
   \[
   \text{Total stickers to 3 friends} = 4 \text{ stickers/friend} \times 3 \text{ friends} = 12 \text{ stickers}
   \]

2. **Calculate the number of stickers given to Mandy:**
   Colton gave Mandy 2 more stickers than he gave to his three friends combined. Since he gave a total of 12 stickers to the three friends, we can calculate the number of stickers given to Mandy:
   \[
   \text{Stickers to Mandy} = \text{Total stickers to 3 friends} + 2 = 12 + 2 = 14 \text{ stickers}
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of stickers given to Justin:**
   Colton gave Justin 10 less stickers than he gave to Mandy. Since Mandy received 14 stickers, we can calculate the number of stickers given to Justin:
   \[
   \text{Stickers to Justin} = \text{Stickers to Mandy} - 10 = 14 - 10 = 4 \text{ stickers}
   \]

4. **Calculate the total number of stickers given away:**
   Now, we need to find the total number of stickers Colton gave away. This includes the stickers given to the three friends, Mandy, and Justin:
   \[
   \text{Total stickers given away} = \text{Stickers to 3 friends} + \text{Stickers to Mandy} + \text{Stickers to Justin}
   \]
   Substituting the values we calculated:
   \[
   \text{Total stickers given away} = 12 + 14 + 4 = 30 \text{ stickers}
   \]

5. **Calculate the number of stickers Colton has left:**
   Colton started with 72 stickers. To find out how many he has left after giving away 30 stickers, we perform the following calculation:
   \[
   \text{Stickers left} = \text{Initial stickers} - \text{Total stickers given away} = 72 - 30 = 42 \text{ stickers}
   \]

Thus, the final answer is that Colton has **42 stickers left**.
