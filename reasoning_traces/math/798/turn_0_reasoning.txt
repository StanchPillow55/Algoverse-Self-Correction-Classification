To solve the problem, we will first determine Billy's hourly wage at different points in time and then calculate how much he earns compared to Sally.

1. **Billy's Starting Salary**:
   - Billy's starting hourly wage is $10.00.

2. **Billy's Salary After 2 Months**:
   - After 2 months, Billy receives a raise of $0.50 per hour.
   - New hourly wage = $10.00 + $0.50 = $10.50.

3. **Billy's Salary After 1 Year**:
   - On his first anniversary, Billy receives another raise of $1.00 per hour.
   - New hourly wage = $10.50 + $1.00 = $11.50.

4. **Sally's Starting Salary**:
   - Sally's starting salary is $0.50 more than Billy's starting salary.
   - Sally's starting hourly wage = $10.00 + $0.50 = $10.50.

5. **Calculating Earnings for Both**:
   - Both Billy and Sally work 20 hours.

   - **Billy's Earnings**:
     - Since we need to compare their earnings, we will use Billy's hourly wage after his first anniversary, which is $11.50.
     - Billy's earnings = Hourly wage × Hours worked = $11.50 × 20 = $230.00.

   - **Sally's Earnings**:
     - Sally's hourly wage is $10.50.
     - Sally's earnings = Hourly wage × Hours worked = $10.50 × 20 = $210.00.

6. **Calculating the Difference in Earnings**:
   - Difference in earnings = Billy's earnings - Sally's earnings = $230.00 - $210.00 = $20.00.

Thus, the final answer is that Billy will earn **$20.00** more than Sally.
