==================================================

To determine how many crayons Mary has left after giving some to Becky, we will follow these steps:

1. **Identify the initial number of crayons**:
   - Mary has 5 green crayons.
   - Mary has 8 blue crayons.

2. **Calculate the total number of crayons Mary starts with**:
   \[
   \text{Total crayons} = \text{Green crayons} + \text{Blue crayons} = 5 + 8 = 13
   \]

3. **Determine how many crayons Mary gives to Becky**:
   - Mary gives away 3 green crayons.
   - Mary gives away 1 blue crayon.

4. **Calculate the total number of crayons given to Becky**:
   \[
   \text{Total given to Becky} = \text{Green crayons given} + \text{Blue crayons given} = 3 + 1 = 4
   \]

5. **Calculate how many crayons Mary has left**:
   - We subtract the total number of crayons given to Becky from the total number of crayons Mary initially had:
   \[
   \text{Crayons left} = \text{Total crayons} - \text{Total given to Becky} = 13 - 4 = 9
   \]

6. **Final answer**:
   Mary has **9 crayons left** after giving some to Becky.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{9}
\]
