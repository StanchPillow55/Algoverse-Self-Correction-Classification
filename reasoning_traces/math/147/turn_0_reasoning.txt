==================================================

To solve the problem, we will break it down into parts and calculate the number of bees that leave and return to the hive in each time segment.

### Step 1: Bees leaving the hive in the first 6 hours
Debra sees **30 bees** leave the hive in the first 6 hours.

### Step 2: Bees returning to the hive in the next 6 hours
In the next 6 hours, Debra sees **1/2** of the bees that left return. Since 30 bees left, the number of bees that return is:
\[
\text{Bees returning} = \frac{1}{2} \times 30 = 15 \text{ bees}
\]

### Step 3: Bees leaving the hive in the next 6 hours
In the following 6 hours, Debra sees **two times** as many bees leave as the first group. Therefore, the number of bees that leave is:
\[
\text{Bees leaving} = 2 \times 30 = 60 \text{ bees}
\]

### Step 4: Bees returning to the hive in the last 6 hours
In the final 6 hours, every bee that left before this point and hadn't already returned will return to the hive. 

- **Total bees that left before the last 6 hours**: 
  - First 6 hours: 30 bees
  - Second 6 hours: 60 bees
  - Total = \(30 + 60 = 90\) bees

- **Bees that returned before the last 6 hours**: 
  - From the first 6 hours, 15 bees returned.

- **Bees that have not returned**: 
  \[
  \text{Bees not returned} = \text{Total left} - \text{Total returned} = 90 - 15 = 75 \text{ bees}
  \]

### Final Calculation
In the last 6 hours, all 75 bees that had left and not yet returned will return to the hive.

Thus, the total number of bees that Debra sees return to the hive in the last 6 hours is:
\[
\text{Final answer} = 75 \text{ bees}
\]

Therefore, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{75}
\]
