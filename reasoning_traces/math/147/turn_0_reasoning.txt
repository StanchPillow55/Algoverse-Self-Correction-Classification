To solve this problem, we need to determine how many crayons Mary has left after giving some to Becky. Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Count of Crayons:**
   - Mary starts with 5 green crayons.
   - Mary also has 8 blue crayons.

2. **Crayons Given to Becky:**
   - Mary gives 3 green crayons to Becky.
   - Mary gives 1 blue crayon to Becky.

3. **Calculate Remaining Green Crayons:**
   - Initially, Mary has 5 green crayons.
   - She gives away 3 green crayons.
   - The number of green crayons left is calculated as follows:
     \[
     \text{Remaining Green Crayons} = 5 - 3 = 2
     \]

4. **Calculate Remaining Blue Crayons:**
   - Initially, Mary has 8 blue crayons.
   - She gives away 1 blue crayon.
   - The number of blue crayons left is calculated as follows:
     \[
     \text{Remaining Blue Crayons} = 8 - 1 = 7
     \]

5. **Total Crayons Left:**
   - Now, we add the remaining green crayons and blue crayons to find the total number of crayons Mary has left:
     \[
     \text{Total Crayons Left} = \text{Remaining Green Crayons} + \text{Remaining Blue Crayons} = 2 + 7 = 9
     \]

Therefore, after giving crayons to Becky, Mary has a total of 9 crayons left.

**Final Answer: Mary has 9 crayons left.**
