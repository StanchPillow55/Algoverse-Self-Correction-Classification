==================================================

To find out how much Mr. Marcellus got in refunds for the sour milk, we will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total amount of milk purchased**: 
   Mr. Marcellus bought 4000 gallons of milk.

2. **Determine the cost per gallon**: 
   The cost of each gallon of milk is $3.5.

3. **Calculate the total cost of the milk purchased**:
   \[
   \text{Total Cost} = \text{Number of gallons} \times \text{Cost per gallon}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total Cost} = 4000 \, \text{gallons} \times 3.5 \, \text{dollars/gallon} = 14000 \, \text{dollars}
   \]

4. **Calculate the amount of milk that passed the expiry date**:
   According to the problem, \( \frac{2}{5} \) of the milk purchased had passed the expiry date. We need to find out how many gallons that is:
   \[
   \text{Gallons of sour milk} = \frac{2}{5} \times 4000 \, \text{gallons}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Gallons of sour milk} = 1600 \, \text{gallons}
   \]

5. **Calculate the refund amount for the sour milk**:
   To find out how much Mr. Marcellus will get back for the sour milk, we need to calculate the cost of the sour milk:
   \[
   \text{Refund Amount} = \text{Gallons of sour milk} \times \text{Cost per gallon}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Refund Amount} = 1600 \, \text{gallons} \times 3.5 \, \text{dollars/gallon} = 5600 \, \text{dollars}
   \]

6. **Final answer**:
   Therefore, the total refund amount Mr. Marcellus received for the sour milk is:
   \[
   \boxed{5600} \, \text{dollars}
   \]
