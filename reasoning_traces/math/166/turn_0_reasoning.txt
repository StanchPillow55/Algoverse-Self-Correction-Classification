To solve the problem, we need to determine how many full-length movies Grandpa Lou watched on Tuesday and then calculate how many he watched on Wednesday based on that number.

1. **Convert Tuesday's total viewing time into minutes:**
   - Grandpa Lou watched for a total of 4 hours and 30 minutes.
   - We convert this time into minutes:
     \[
     4 \text{ hours} = 4 \times 60 = 240 \text{ minutes}
     \]
     \[
     30 \text{ minutes} = 30 \text{ minutes}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total time on Tuesday} = 240 + 30 = 270 \text{ minutes}
     \]

2. **Determine how many movies he watched on Tuesday:**
   - Each movie lasts 90 minutes.
   - To find out how many full movies he watched, we divide the total viewing time by the length of one movie:
     \[
     \text{Number of movies on Tuesday} = \frac{270 \text{ minutes}}{90 \text{ minutes/movie}} = 3 \text{ movies}
     \]

3. **Calculate the number of movies watched on Wednesday:**
   - On Wednesday, Grandpa Lou watched twice as many movies as he did on Tuesday:
     \[
     \text{Number of movies on Wednesday} = 2 \times 3 = 6 \text{ movies}
     \]

4. **Calculate the total number of movies watched over the two days:**
   - Now, we add the number of movies watched on both days:
     \[
     \text{Total movies} = \text{Movies on Tuesday} + \text{Movies on Wednesday} = 3 + 6 = 9 \text{ movies}
     \]

Therefore, the maximum number of full-length movies Grandpa Lou could have watched during these two days is:

\[
\boxed{9}
\]
