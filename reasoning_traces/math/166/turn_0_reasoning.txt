To solve this problem, we need to determine how many full-length movies Grandpa Lou watched on Tuesday and Wednesday, given the total time he spent watching movies each day.

### Step 1: Determine the number of movies watched on Tuesday

1. **Convert the total viewing time on Tuesday to minutes:**
   - Grandpa Lou watched movies for 4 hours and 30 minutes on Tuesday.
   - Convert hours to minutes: \(4 \text{ hours} = 4 \times 60 = 240 \text{ minutes}\).
   - Add the remaining 30 minutes: \(240 \text{ minutes} + 30 \text{ minutes} = 270 \text{ minutes}\).

2. **Calculate the number of full-length movies watched on Tuesday:**
   - Each movie lasts 90 minutes.
   - Divide the total viewing time by the length of one movie: 
     \[
     \frac{270 \text{ minutes}}{90 \text{ minutes/movie}} = 3 \text{ movies}
     \]
   - Therefore, Grandpa Lou watched 3 full-length movies on Tuesday.

### Step 2: Determine the number of movies watched on Wednesday

1. **Calculate the number of movies watched on Wednesday:**
   - On Wednesday, Grandpa Lou watched twice as many movies as he did on Tuesday.
   - Since he watched 3 movies on Tuesday, he watched:
     \[
     2 \times 3 = 6 \text{ movies on Wednesday}
     \]

### Step 3: Calculate the total number of movies watched over the two days

1. **Add the number of movies watched on both days:**
   - Movies watched on Tuesday: 3
   - Movies watched on Wednesday: 6
   - Total movies watched:
     \[
     3 + 6 = 9 \text{ movies}
     \]

### Conclusion

The maximum number of full-length movies Grandpa Lou could have watched during these two days is \(\boxed{9}\).
