==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine the total amount of wrapping paper required for all three presents. Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **First Present:**
   - The first present requires 2 square feet of wrapping paper.

2. **Second Present:**
   - The second present needs three-quarters of the amount required by the first present.
   - To find this, we calculate \(\frac{3}{4}\) of 2 square feet:
     \[
     \frac{3}{4} \times 2 = \frac{3 \times 2}{4} = \frac{6}{4} = 1.5
     \]
   - Therefore, the second present requires 1.5 square feet of wrapping paper.

3. **Third Present:**
   - The third present requires the same amount of wrapping paper as both the first and second presents combined.
   - First, we calculate the total amount of wrapping paper needed for the first and second presents:
     \[
     2 + 1.5 = 3.5
     \]
   - Thus, the third present requires 3.5 square feet of wrapping paper.

4. **Total Wrapping Paper Needed:**
   - To find the total amount of wrapping paper needed for all three presents, we add the amounts required for each present:
     \[
     2 + 1.5 + 3.5 = 7
     \]

Therefore, Carrie needs a total of 7 square feet of wrapping paper for all three presents.

**Final Answer:**
Carrie needs 7 square feet of wrapping paper.
