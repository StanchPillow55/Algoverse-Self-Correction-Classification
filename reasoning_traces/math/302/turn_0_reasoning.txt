To find out how many square feet of wrapping paper Carrie needs for all three birthday presents, we will calculate the amount of wrapping paper needed for each present step by step.

1. **Calculate the amount of wrapping paper for the first present:**
   - The first present requires 2 square feet of wrapping paper.

   \[
   \text{Wrapping paper for first present} = 2 \text{ square feet}
   \]

2. **Calculate the amount of wrapping paper for the second present:**
   - The second present needs three-quarters of the amount needed for the first present. 
   - Three-quarters of 2 square feet can be calculated as follows:

   \[
   \text{Wrapping paper for second present} = \frac{3}{4} \times 2 = \frac{3 \times 2}{4} = \frac{6}{4} = 1.5 \text{ square feet}
   \]

3. **Calculate the amount of wrapping paper for the third present:**
   - The third present needs the same amount of wrapping paper as both the first and second presents combined.
   - First, we need to find the total amount of wrapping paper used for the first and second presents:

   \[
   \text{Total for first and second presents} = 2 + 1.5 = 3.5 \text{ square feet}
   \]

   - Therefore, the amount of wrapping paper needed for the third present is:

   \[
   \text{Wrapping paper for third present} = 3.5 \text{ square feet}
   \]

4. **Calculate the total amount of wrapping paper needed for all three presents:**
   - Now, we will sum the amounts of wrapping paper needed for all three presents:

   \[
   \text{Total wrapping paper} = \text{First present} + \text{Second present} + \text{Third present}
   \]

   \[
   \text{Total wrapping paper} = 2 + 1.5 + 3.5
   \]

   - Performing the addition:

   \[
   2 + 1.5 = 3.5
   \]
   \[
   3.5 + 3.5 = 7
   \]

Thus, the total amount of wrapping paper Carrie needs for all three presents is:

\[
\boxed{7} \text{ square feet}
\]
