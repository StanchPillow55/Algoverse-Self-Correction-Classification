==================================================

It seems like the problem statement "Sample math problem 235" is not providing enough information to solve a specific math problem. To help you effectively, I need a clear and complete math problem statement. However, I can guide you through a generic approach to solving math problems, which you can apply to a specific problem once you have it.

Hereâ€™s a general approach to solving math problems:

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - Read the problem carefully.
   - Identify what is being asked.
   - Determine what information is given and what needs to be found.

2. **Devise a Plan:**
   - Consider possible strategies to solve the problem. This could include drawing a diagram, creating an equation, or breaking the problem into smaller parts.

3. **Carry Out the Plan:**
   - Execute the chosen strategy step by step.
   - Perform calculations carefully and check each step for accuracy.

4. **Review/Check:**
   - Once a solution is found, review the problem and the solution.
   - Check if the solution makes sense and if it answers the question posed.
   - Verify calculations and consider if there is another way to solve the problem.

Since I don't have a specific problem to work through, I can't provide detailed calculations or a final answer. If you have a specific math problem in mind, please provide the details, and I would be happy to help you solve it step by step.
