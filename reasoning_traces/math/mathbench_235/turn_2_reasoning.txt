Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we first need to understand what "Sample math problem 235" refers to. Since the problem itself is not explicitly stated, I'll assume a generic math problem involving the number 235. Let's create a problem involving this number and solve it step-by-step.

**Problem:**
Find the sum of the digits of the number 235 and then multiply the result by 3. Finally, subtract 10 from the product.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Identify the digits of the number 235:**
   - The number 235 consists of the digits 2, 3, and 5.

2. **Calculate the sum of the digits:**
   - Sum = 2 + 3 + 5
   - Sum = 10

3. **Multiply the sum by 3:**
   - Product = 10 Ã— 3
   - Product = 30

4. **Subtract 10 from the product:**
   - Result = 30 - 10
   - Result = 20

**Final Answer:**
The final result after performing all the operations is 20.
