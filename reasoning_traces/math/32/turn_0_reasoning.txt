==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to determine the distance the car traveled after the 3rd turn, given the total distance traveled around the ring and the distances traveled after the first three turns.

1. **Identify the distances traveled after each turn:**
   - After the 1st turn: 5 meters
   - After the 2nd turn: 8 meters
   - After the 3rd turn: Let's denote this distance as \( x \) meters.
   - After the 4th turn: The car exits the tunnel immediately after this turn.

2. **Total distance traveled:**
   The total distance traveled around the ring is given as 23 meters. Therefore, we can set up the equation based on the distances traveled after each turn:
   \[
   5 + 8 + x + d = 23
   \]
   where \( d \) is the distance traveled after the 4th turn. However, since the car exits immediately after the 4th turn, we can assume \( d = 0 \) for the purpose of this calculation.

3. **Simplifying the equation:**
   Since \( d = 0 \), we can simplify our equation to:
   \[
   5 + 8 + x = 23
   \]

4. **Combine the known distances:**
   Adding the distances after the first two turns:
   \[
   5 + 8 = 13
   \]
   Now, substituting this back into the equation gives:
   \[
   13 + x = 23
   \]

5. **Solve for \( x \):**
   To find \( x \), we subtract 13 from both sides:
   \[
   x = 23 - 13
   \]
   \[
   x = 10
   \]

Thus, the distance the car traveled after the 3rd turn is **10 meters**.

**Final Answer:**
The car had to travel **10 meters** after the 3rd turn.
