Question ID: 32
Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

The car has driven a total of 23 meters around the ring. We know that after the first turn, it traveled 5 meters, and after the second turn, it traveled 8 meters. 

So, the total distance traveled after the first two turns is 5 meters + 8 meters = 13 meters.

The total distance the car has driven is 23 meters, so to find out how far it traveled after the third turn, we subtract the distance traveled after the first two turns from the total distance.

So, the distance traveled after the third turn is 23 meters - 13 meters = 10 meters.

Therefore, the car had to travel 10 meters after the third turn.
