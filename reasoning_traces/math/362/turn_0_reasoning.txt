To solve the problem, we need to determine the total amount of stuffing required for 4 chihuahua beds and 3 collie beds.

1. **Calculate the stuffing needed for the chihuahua beds:**
   - Each chihuahua bed requires 2 pounds of stuffing.
   - For 4 chihuahua beds, the total amount of stuffing needed is:
     \[
     \text{Stuffing for chihuahua beds} = 4 \text{ beds} \times 2 \text{ pounds/bed} = 8 \text{ pounds}
     \]

2. **Determine the stuffing needed for the collie beds:**
   - The collie bed requires an average amount of stuffing between the Rottweiler bed and the chihuahua bed.
   - The Rottweiler bed requires 8 pounds of stuffing, and the chihuahua bed requires 2 pounds of stuffing.
   - To find the average, we use the formula for the average of two numbers:
     \[
     \text{Average} = \frac{\text{Rottweiler stuffing} + \text{Chihuahua stuffing}}{2} = \frac{8 \text{ pounds} + 2 \text{ pounds}}{2} = \frac{10 \text{ pounds}}{2} = 5 \text{ pounds}
     \]
   - Therefore, each collie bed requires 5 pounds of stuffing.
   - For 3 collie beds, the total amount of stuffing needed is:
     \[
     \text{Stuffing for collie beds} = 3 \text{ beds} \times 5 \text{ pounds/bed} = 15 \text{ pounds}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total amount of stuffing needed:**
   - Now, we add the stuffing needed for the chihuahua beds and the collie beds:
     \[
     \text{Total stuffing} = \text{Stuffing for chihuahua beds} + \text{Stuffing for collie beds} = 8 \text{ pounds} + 15 \text{ pounds} = 23 \text{ pounds}
     \]

Thus, the total amount of stuffing Mark needs to make 4 chihuahua beds and 3 collie beds is:

\[
\boxed{23} \text{ pounds}
\]
