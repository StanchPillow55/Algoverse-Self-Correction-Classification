To solve this problem, we need to set up equations based on the information given and solve for the unknowns. Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( B \) be the weight of Kevin's empty briefcase.
   - Let \( L \) be the weight of Kevin's laptop.
   - Let \( P \) be the weight of Kevin's work papers.
   - The weight of Karen's tote bag is given as 8 pounds.

2. **Translate the Problem into Equations:**
   - Karen’s tote bag is twice the weight of Kevin’s empty briefcase:
     \[
     8 = 2B
     \]
     Solving for \( B \), we divide both sides by 2:
     \[
     B = 4
     \]
     So, Kevin's empty briefcase weighs 4 pounds.

   - When Kevin puts his laptop and work papers in his briefcase, it is twice the weight of Karen’s tote:
     \[
     B + L + P = 2 \times 8 = 16
     \]
     Substitute \( B = 4 \) into the equation:
     \[
     4 + L + P = 16
     \]
     Simplifying gives:
     \[
     L + P = 12
     \]

   - Kevin’s work papers are a sixth of the weight of the contents of his full briefcase:
     \[
     P = \frac{1}{6}(B + L + P)
     \]
     Substitute \( B + L + P = 16 \) into the equation:
     \[
     P = \frac{1}{6} \times 16 = \frac{16}{6} = \frac{8}{3}
     \]

3. **Solve for \( L \):**
   - We have two equations:
     \[
     L + P = 12
     \]
     \[
     P = \frac{8}{3}
     \]
   - Substitute \( P = \frac{8}{3} \) into the equation \( L + P = 12 \):
     \[
     L + \frac{8}{3} = 12
     \]
     Subtract \(\frac{8}{3}\) from both sides:
     \[
     L = 12 - \frac{8}{3}
     \]
     Convert 12 to a fraction with a denominator of 3:
     \[
     L = \frac{36}{3} - \frac{8}{3} = \frac{28}{3}
     \]

4. **Calculate the Difference in Weight:**
   - We need to find how many more pounds Kevin’s laptop weighs than Karen’s tote:
     \[
     L - 8 = \frac{28}{3} - 8
     \]
     Convert 8 to a fraction with a denominator of 3:
     \[
     L - 8 = \frac{28}{3} - \frac{24}{3} = \frac{4}{3}
     \]

5. **Final Answer:**
   - Kevin’s laptop weighs \(\frac{4}{3}\) pounds more than Karen’s tote.

Thus, the final answer is that Kevin's laptop weighs \(\frac{4}{3}\) pounds more than Karen's tote.
