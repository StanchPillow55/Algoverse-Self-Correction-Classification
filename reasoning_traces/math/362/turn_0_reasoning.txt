To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step, using the information provided.

1. **Identify the weight of Karen's tote bag**:
   - We are given that Karen's tote bag weighs 8 pounds.

2. **Determine the weight of Kevin's empty briefcase**:
   - According to the problem, Karen’s tote bag is twice the weight of Kevin’s empty briefcase. 
   - Let \( K \) be the weight of Kevin's empty briefcase.
   - Therefore, we have:
     \[
     8 = 2K
     \]
   - Solving for \( K \):
     \[
     K = \frac{8}{2} = 4 \text{ pounds}
     \]
   - So, Kevin's empty briefcase weighs 4 pounds.

3. **Determine the weight of Kevin's full briefcase**:
   - When Kevin puts his laptop and work papers in his briefcase, it is stated that the full briefcase weighs twice the weight of Karen’s tote.
   - Therefore, the weight of the full briefcase is:
     \[
     2 \times 8 = 16 \text{ pounds}
     \]

4. **Determine the weight of the contents of Kevin's briefcase**:
   - The weight of the contents of Kevin's briefcase (which includes his laptop and work papers) is the weight of the full briefcase minus the weight of the empty briefcase:
     \[
     \text{Weight of contents} = 16 - 4 = 12 \text{ pounds}
     \]

5. **Determine the weight of Kevin's work papers**:
   - We know that Kevin's work papers are a sixth of the weight of the contents of his full briefcase:
     \[
     \text{Weight of work papers} = \frac{1}{6} \times 12 = 2 \text{ pounds}
     \]

6. **Determine the weight of Kevin's laptop**:
   - The weight of Kevin's laptop can be found by subtracting the weight of the work papers from the total weight of the contents:
     \[
     \text{Weight of laptop} = \text{Weight of contents} - \text{Weight of work papers}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Weight of laptop} = 12 - 2 = 10 \text{ pounds}
     \]

7. **Determine how many more pounds Kevin's laptop weighs than Karen's tote**:
   - We need to find the difference between the weight of Kevin's laptop and the weight of Karen's tote:
     \[
     \text{Difference} = \text{Weight of laptop} - \text{Weight of tote}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Difference} = 10 - 8 = 2 \text{ pounds}
     \]

Thus, the final answer is that Kevin's laptop weighs **2 pounds more** than Karen's tote.
