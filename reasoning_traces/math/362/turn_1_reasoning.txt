==================================================

To solve this problem, let's define the variables and work through the problem step by step.

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( B \) be the weight of Kevin's briefcase when it is empty.
   - Let \( L \) be the weight of Kevin's laptop.
   - Let \( P \) be the weight of Kevin's work papers.
   - Let \( T \) be the weight of Karen's tote bag.

2. **Given Information:**
   - Karen’s tote bag weighs 8 pounds, so \( T = 8 \).
   - Karen's tote bag is twice the weight of Kevin’s empty briefcase: 
     \[
     T = 2B
     \]
     Substituting the value of \( T \):
     \[
     8 = 2B \implies B = 4
     \]
   - When Kevin puts his laptop and work papers in his briefcase, it is twice the weight of Karen’s tote:
     \[
     B + L + P = 2T
     \]
     Substituting the values of \( B \) and \( T \):
     \[
     4 + L + P = 2 \times 8 = 16
     \]
     Simplifying:
     \[
     L + P = 12
     \]
   - Kevin’s work papers are a sixth of the weight of the contents of his full briefcase:
     \[
     P = \frac{1}{6}(B + L + P)
     \]
     Substituting the expression for \( B + L + P \):
     \[
     P = \frac{1}{6} \times 16 = \frac{16}{6} = \frac{8}{3}
     \]

3. **Solve for \( L \):**
   - From the equation \( L + P = 12 \), substitute \( P = \frac{8}{3} \):
     \[
     L + \frac{8}{3} = 12
     \]
     Solving for \( L \):
     \[
     L = 12 - \frac{8}{3} = \frac{36}{3} - \frac{8}{3} = \frac{28}{3}
     \]

4. **Calculate the Difference in Weight:**
   - We need to find how many more pounds Kevin’s laptop weighs than Karen’s tote:
     \[
     L - T = \frac{28}{3} - 8
     \]
     Convert 8 to a fraction with a denominator of 3:
     \[
     8 = \frac{24}{3}
     \]
     Subtract:
     \[
     L - T = \frac{28}{3} - \frac{24}{3} = \frac{4}{3}
     \]

5. **Final Answer:**
   - Kevin’s laptop weighs \(\frac{4}{3}\) pounds more than Karen’s tote.

Therefore, Kevin's laptop weighs \(\frac{4}{3}\) pounds more than Karen's tote.
