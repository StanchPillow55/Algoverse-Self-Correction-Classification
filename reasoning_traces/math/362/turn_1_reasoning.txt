==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to set up equations based on the information given and solve for the unknowns. Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( T \) be the weight of Karen's tote bag.
   - Let \( B \) be the weight of Kevin's empty briefcase.
   - Let \( L \) be the weight of Kevin's laptop.
   - Let \( P \) be the weight of Kevin's work papers.

2. **Given Information:**
   - Karen’s tote bag weighs 8 pounds: \( T = 8 \).
   - Karen’s tote bag is twice the weight of Kevin’s empty briefcase: \( T = 2B \).
   - When Kevin puts his laptop and work papers in his briefcase, it is twice the weight of Karen’s tote: \( B + L + P = 2T \).
   - Kevin’s work papers are a sixth of the weight of the contents of his full briefcase: \( P = \frac{1}{6}(B + L + P) \).

3. **Substitute Known Values:**
   - From \( T = 8 \), we have \( B = \frac{T}{2} = \frac{8}{2} = 4 \).

4. **Equation for Full Briefcase:**
   - Substitute \( B = 4 \) and \( T = 8 \) into \( B + L + P = 2T \):
     \[
     4 + L + P = 2 \times 8 = 16
     \]
   - Simplifying gives:
     \[
     L + P = 16 - 4 = 12
     \]

5. **Equation for Work Papers:**
   - Substitute \( B = 4 \) into \( P = \frac{1}{6}(B + L + P) \):
     \[
     P = \frac{1}{6}(4 + L + P)
     \]
   - Multiply both sides by 6 to clear the fraction:
     \[
     6P = 4 + L + P
     \]
   - Rearrange to solve for \( L \):
     \[
     5P = 4 + L
     \]
     \[
     L = 5P - 4
     \]

6. **Solve the System of Equations:**
   - We have two equations:
     1. \( L + P = 12 \)
     2. \( L = 5P - 4 \)

   - Substitute equation 2 into equation 1:
     \[
     (5P - 4) + P = 12
     \]
     \[
     6P - 4 = 12
     \]
     \[
     6P = 16
     \]
     \[
     P = \frac{16}{6} = \frac{8}{3}
     \]

   - Substitute \( P = \frac{8}{3} \) back into equation 2 to find \( L \):
     \[
     L = 5 \times \frac{8}{3} - 4
     \]
     \[
     L = \frac{40}{3} - 4
     \]
     \[
     L = \frac{40}{3} - \frac{12}{3}
     \]
     \[
     L = \frac{28}{3}
     \]

7. **Calculate the Difference:**
   - We need to find how many more pounds Kevin’s laptop weighs than Karen’s tote:
     \[
     L - T = \frac{28}{3} - 8
     \]
     \[
     L - T = \frac{28}{3} - \frac{24}{3}
     \]
     \[
     L - T = \frac{4}{3}
     \]

8. **Final Answer:**
   - Kevin’s laptop weighs \(\frac{4}{3}\) pounds more than Karen’s tote.

Thus, the final answer is \(\frac{4}{3}\) pounds.
