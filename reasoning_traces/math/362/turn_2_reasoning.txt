Question ID: 362
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to establish relationships between the weights of the different items mentioned: Karen's tote bag, Kevin's empty briefcase, Kevin's laptop, and Kevin's work papers.

Let's define the variables:
- Let \( T \) be the weight of Karen's tote bag.
- Let \( B \) be the weight of Kevin's empty briefcase.
- Let \( L \) be the weight of Kevin's laptop.
- Let \( P \) be the weight of Kevin's work papers.

From the problem, we have the following information:
1. Karen’s tote bag is twice the weight of Kevin’s empty briefcase: 
   \[
   T = 2B
   \]

2. When Kevin puts his laptop and work papers in his briefcase, it is twice the weight of Karen’s tote:
   \[
   B + L + P = 2T
   \]

3. Kevin’s work papers are a sixth of the weight of the contents of his full briefcase:
   \[
   P = \frac{1}{6}(B + L + P)
   \]

4. Karen’s tote weighs 8 pounds:
   \[
   T = 8
   \]

Now, let's solve these equations step by step.

**Step 1: Solve for \( B \) using the weight of Karen's tote.**

From equation 1:
\[
T = 2B \implies 8 = 2B \implies B = 4
\]

**Step 2: Use the relationship for the weight of the full briefcase.**

From equation 2:
\[
B + L + P = 2T \implies 4 + L + P = 2 \times 8 \implies 4 + L + P = 16
\]
\[
L + P = 12
\]

**Step 3: Solve for \( P \) using the relationship for the work papers.**

From equation 3:
\[
P = \frac{1}{6}(B + L + P)
\]

Substitute \( B = 4 \) into the equation:
\[
P = \frac{1}{6}(4 + L + P)
\]

Substitute \( L + P = 12 \) into the equation:
\[
P = \frac{1}{6}(4 + 12) = \frac{1}{6} \times 16 = \frac{16}{6} = \frac{8}{3}
\]

**Step 4: Solve for \( L \).**

From \( L + P = 12 \):
\[
L + \frac{8}{3} = 12
\]

Subtract \(\frac{8}{3}\) from both sides:
\[
L = 12 - \frac{8}{3} = \frac{36}{3} - \frac{8}{3} = \frac{28}{3}
\]

**Step 5: Calculate how many more pounds Kevin’s laptop weighs than Karen’s tote.**

We need to find \( L - T \):
\[
L - T = \frac{28}{3} - 8
\]

Convert 8 to a fraction with the same denominator:
\[
8 = \frac{24}{3}
\]

Subtract:
\[
L - T = \frac{28}{3} - \frac{24}{3} = \frac{4}{3}
\]

Thus, Kevin’s laptop weighs \(\frac{4}{3}\) pounds more than Karen’s tote.

**Final Answer:**
Kevin’s laptop weighs \(\frac{4}{3}\) pounds more than Karen’s tote.
