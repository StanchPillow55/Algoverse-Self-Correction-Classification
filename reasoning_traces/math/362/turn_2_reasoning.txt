Question ID: 362
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to establish relationships between the weights of Karen's tote, Kevin's briefcase, and the contents of Kevin's briefcase. Let's define the variables and work through the problem step by step.

### Step 1: Define Variables
- Let \( T \) be the weight of Karen's tote bag.
- Let \( B \) be the weight of Kevin's briefcase when it is empty.
- Let \( L \) be the weight of Kevin's laptop.
- Let \( P \) be the weight of Kevin's work papers.

### Step 2: Translate the Problem into Equations
1. **Karen’s tote bag is twice the weight of Kevin’s empty briefcase:**
   \[
   T = 2B
   \]

2. **When Kevin puts his laptop and work papers in his briefcase, it is twice the weight of Karen’s tote:**
   \[
   B + L + P = 2T
   \]

3. **Kevin’s work papers are a sixth of the weight of the contents of his full briefcase:**
   \[
   P = \frac{1}{6}(B + L + P)
   \]

4. **Karen’s tote weighs 8 pounds:**
   \[
   T = 8
   \]

### Step 3: Solve the Equations

#### Substitute the Known Value of \( T \)
From equation (4), we know \( T = 8 \). Substitute this into equation (1):
\[
8 = 2B \implies B = 4
\]

#### Substitute \( B \) and \( T \) into Equation (2)
Substitute \( B = 4 \) and \( T = 8 \) into equation (2):
\[
4 + L + P = 2 \times 8 \implies 4 + L + P = 16
\]
\[
L + P = 12
\]

#### Solve for \( P \) Using Equation (3)
Substitute \( B = 4 \) into equation (3):
\[
P = \frac{1}{6}(4 + L + P)
\]

Multiply both sides by 6 to eliminate the fraction:
\[
6P = 4 + L + P
\]

Rearrange to solve for \( L \):
\[
6P - P = 4 + L \implies 5P = 4 + L \implies L = 5P - 4
\]

#### Substitute \( L = 5P - 4 \) into \( L + P = 12 \)
Substitute into the equation \( L + P = 12 \):
\[
(5P - 4) + P = 12
\]
\[
6P - 4 = 12
\]
\[
6P = 16
\]
\[
P = \frac{16}{6} = \frac{8}{3}
\]

#### Solve for \( L \)
Substitute \( P = \frac{8}{3} \) back into \( L = 5P - 4 \):
\[
L = 5 \times \frac{8}{3} - 4
\]
\[
L = \frac{40}{3} - 4
\]
Convert 4 to a fraction with a denominator of 3:
\[
L = \frac{40}{3} - \frac{12}{3}
\]
\[
L = \frac{28}{3}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the Difference in Weight
We need to find how many more pounds Kevin’s laptop weighs than Karen’s tote:
\[
L - T = \frac{28}{3} - 8
\]

Convert 8 to a fraction with a denominator of 3:
\[
L - T = \frac{28}{3} - \frac{24}{3}
\]
\[
L - T = \frac{4}{3}
\]

### Final Answer
Kevin's laptop weighs \(\frac{4}{3}\) pounds more than Karen’s tote.
