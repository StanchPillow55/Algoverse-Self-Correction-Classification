Question ID: 82
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to calculate Irene's total income based on her regular hours and any overtime hours she worked.

### Step 1: Determine Regular Income
Irene earns $500 for working 40 hours a week. This is her regular income for a standard workweek.

### Step 2: Calculate Overtime Hours
Irene worked 50 hours last week. To find the number of overtime hours, we subtract the regular hours from the total hours worked:

\[
\text{Overtime hours} = \text{Total hours worked} - \text{Regular hours} = 50 - 40 = 10 \text{ hours}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate Overtime Pay
Irene earns an extra $20 for each hour of overtime. Therefore, her overtime pay can be calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Overtime pay} = \text{Overtime hours} \times \text{Overtime rate} = 10 \times 20 = 200
\]

### Step 4: Calculate Total Income
To find Irene's total income for the week, we add her regular income to her overtime pay:

\[
\text{Total income} = \text{Regular income} + \text{Overtime pay} = 500 + 200 = 700
\]

### Final Answer
Irene's total income for the week in which she worked 50 hours is \(\boxed{700}\) dollars.
