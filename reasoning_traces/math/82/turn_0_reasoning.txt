==================================================

Irene's regular pay is $500 for 40 hours of work. 

However, she worked 50 hours last week, which means she worked 10 hours of overtime. 

The problem states that she earns an extra $20 for every hour of overtime. 

To calculate her overtime pay, we multiply the number of overtime hours by the overtime rate:

10 hours * $20/hour = $200

So, Irene earned $200 in overtime pay. 

To find her total income, we add her regular pay to her overtime pay:

$500 (regular pay) + $200 (overtime pay) = $700

Therefore, Irene's total income last week was $700.
