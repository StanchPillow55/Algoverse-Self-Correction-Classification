To calculate Irene's total income for the week, we need to break down her earnings based on her regular hours and her overtime hours.

1. **Identify Regular and Overtime Hours:**
   - Irene works 40 hours a week at a regular pay rate.
   - She worked 50 hours last week.
   - Therefore, the number of overtime hours she worked is:
     \[
     \text{Overtime Hours} = \text{Total Hours Worked} - \text{Regular Hours} = 50 - 40 = 10 \text{ hours}
     \]

2. **Calculate Regular Income:**
   - Irene earns $500 for her regular 40 hours of work.
   - Thus, her regular income is:
     \[
     \text{Regular Income} = 500 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Calculate Overtime Income:**
   - Irene earns an extra $20 for every hour of overtime.
   - Since she worked 10 hours of overtime, her overtime income is:
     \[
     \text{Overtime Income} = \text{Overtime Hours} \times \text{Overtime Rate} = 10 \text{ hours} \times 20 \text{ dollars/hour} = 200 \text{ dollars}
     \]

4. **Calculate Total Income:**
   - To find her total income for the week, we add her regular income and her overtime income:
     \[
     \text{Total Income} = \text{Regular Income} + \text{Overtime Income} = 500 \text{ dollars} + 200 \text{ dollars} = 700 \text{ dollars}
     \]

5. **Final Answer:**
   - Therefore, Irene's total income for the week is:
     \[
     \boxed{700} \text{ dollars}
     \]
