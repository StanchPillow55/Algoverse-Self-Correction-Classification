==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to calculate Irene's total income based on her regular hours and any overtime hours she worked. Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Regular Work Hours and Pay:**
   - Irene earns $500 for working 40 hours a week. This is her regular pay for a standard workweek.

2. **Overtime Hours:**
   - Last week, Irene worked a total of 50 hours.
   - To find out how many overtime hours she worked, we subtract the regular hours from the total hours worked:
     \[
     \text{Overtime hours} = \text{Total hours worked} - \text{Regular hours} = 50 - 40 = 10 \text{ hours}
     \]

3. **Overtime Pay:**
   - Irene earns an extra $20 for each hour of overtime.
   - To calculate her overtime pay, we multiply the number of overtime hours by the overtime rate:
     \[
     \text{Overtime pay} = \text{Overtime hours} \times \text{Overtime rate} = 10 \times 20 = 200
     \]

4. **Total Income:**
   - Irene's total income for the week is the sum of her regular pay and her overtime pay:
     \[
     \text{Total income} = \text{Regular pay} + \text{Overtime pay} = 500 + 200 = 700
     \]

Therefore, Irene's total income for the week, including her overtime pay, is \(\boxed{700}\) dollars.
