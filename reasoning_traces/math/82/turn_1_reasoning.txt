==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to calculate Irene's total income based on her regular hours and any overtime hours she worked.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Identify Regular and Overtime Hours:**
   - Irene's regular workweek is 40 hours.
   - Last week, she worked a total of 50 hours.

2. **Calculate Overtime Hours:**
   - Overtime hours are the total hours worked minus the regular hours.
   \[
   \text{Overtime hours} = 50 \text{ hours} - 40 \text{ hours} = 10 \text{ hours}
   \]

3. **Calculate Regular Income:**
   - Irene earns $500 for working 40 hours a week. This is her regular income.

4. **Calculate Overtime Income:**
   - Irene earns an extra $20 for each hour of overtime.
   - For 10 overtime hours, her overtime income is:
   \[
   \text{Overtime income} = 10 \text{ hours} \times \$20/\text{hour} = \$200
   \]

5. **Calculate Total Income:**
   - Total income is the sum of regular income and overtime income.
   \[
   \text{Total income} = \text{Regular income} + \text{Overtime income} = \$500 + \$200 = \$700
   \]

### Final Answer:
Irene's total income for working 50 hours last week is \(\$700\).
