Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To determine how many pages Shiela has left to write for her 15-page research paper, we can follow these steps:

1. **Identify the total number of pages required**: Shiela needs to write a total of 15 pages.

2. **Determine how much of the paper she has already completed**: Shiela has finished writing \( \frac{1}{3} \) of the paper.

3. **Calculate the number of pages she has already written**:
   - To find out how many pages \( \frac{1}{3} \) of the total 15 pages is, we multiply:
   \[
   \text{Pages written} = \frac{1}{3} \times 15
   \]
   - Performing the multiplication:
   \[
   \text{Pages written} = \frac{15}{3} = 5
   \]
   So, Shiela has written 5 pages.

4. **Calculate the number of pages left to write**:
   - To find out how many pages are left, we subtract the number of pages she has already written from the total number of pages:
   \[
   \text{Pages left} = \text{Total pages} - \text{Pages written}
   \]
   - Plugging in the values:
   \[
   \text{Pages left} = 15 - 5 = 10
   \]

5. **Final answer**: Shiela has 10 pages left to write.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{10}
\]
