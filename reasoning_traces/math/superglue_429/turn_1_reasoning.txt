==================================================

To solve the problem effectively, let's first understand what is being asked. The question is labeled as "Sample reasoning question 429," but it doesn't provide specific details or context. Since the question is not clear, I'll assume it's a placeholder for a typical math problem. Let's create a hypothetical math problem and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**

A company produces two types of widgets: Type A and Type B. The company sells Type A widgets for $50 each and Type B widgets for $70 each. Last month, the company sold a total of 500 widgets and earned $30,000 in revenue. How many of each type of widget did the company sell?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( x \) be the number of Type A widgets sold.
   - Let \( y \) be the number of Type B widgets sold.

2. **Set Up Equations:**
   - The total number of widgets sold is 500. Therefore, we have the equation:
     \[
     x + y = 500
     \]
   - The total revenue from selling the widgets is $30,000. Therefore, we have the equation:
     \[
     50x + 70y = 30,000
     \]

3. **Solve the System of Equations:**
   - We have the system of equations:
     \[
     \begin{align*}
     x + y &= 500 \\
     50x + 70y &= 30,000
     \end{align*}
     \]

   - Solve the first equation for \( x \):
     \[
     x = 500 - y
     \]

   - Substitute \( x = 500 - y \) into the second equation:
     \[
     50(500 - y) + 70y = 30,000
     \]

   - Distribute and simplify:
     \[
     25,000 - 50y + 70y = 30,000
     \]

   - Combine like terms:
     \[
     20y = 5,000
     \]

   - Solve for \( y \):
     \[
     y = \frac{5,000}{20} = 250
     \]

   - Substitute \( y = 250 \) back into the equation \( x = 500 - y \):
     \[
     x = 500 - 250 = 250
     \]

4. **Verify the Solution:**
   - Check the total number of widgets:
     \[
     x + y = 250 + 250 = 500
     \]
   - Check the total revenue:
     \[
     50x + 70y = 50(250) + 70(250) = 12,500 + 17,500 = 30,000
     \]

Both conditions are satisfied, confirming our solution is correct.

**Final Answer:**
The company sold 250 Type A widgets and 250 Type B widgets.
