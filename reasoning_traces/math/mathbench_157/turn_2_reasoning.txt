==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 157," we need to first understand what the problem is asking. However, the problem statement "Sample math problem 157" is not specific enough for me to determine the exact mathematical question or context. Therefore, I will assume this is a placeholder for a specific math problem.

To proceed, let's consider a hypothetical math problem that could be labeled as "Sample math problem 157." I'll create a problem and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**

"Sample math problem 157: Solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 3x + 5 = 20 \)."

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Equation:**
   The equation given is \( 3x + 5 = 20 \). This is a linear equation in one variable, \( x \).

2. **Isolate the Variable:**
   To solve for \( x \), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We can do this by performing inverse operations.

3. **Subtract 5 from Both Sides:**
   \[
   3x + 5 - 5 = 20 - 5
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   3x = 15
   \]

4. **Divide Both Sides by 3:**
   \[
   \frac{3x}{3} = \frac{15}{3}
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   x = 5
   \]

5. **Verify the Solution:**
   Substitute \( x = 5 \) back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies the equation:
   \[
   3(5) + 5 = 20
   \]
   Simplifying the left side:
   \[
   15 + 5 = 20
   \]
   \[
   20 = 20
   \]
   The left side equals the right side, confirming that \( x = 5 \) is indeed the correct solution.

**Final Answer:**

The solution to the equation \( 3x + 5 = 20 \) is \( x = 5 \).

If you have a specific "Sample math problem 157" in mind, please provide the details of the problem, and I will be happy to solve it for you.
