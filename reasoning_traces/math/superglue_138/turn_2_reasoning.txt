==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 138" entails. Since the question itself is not provided, I'll demonstrate a general approach to solving a typical math problem by breaking it down into steps. Let's assume a hypothetical math problem and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**

Calculate the value of \( x \) in the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We have a linear equation in one variable: \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).
   - Our goal is to find the value of \( x \) that satisfies this equation.

2. **Isolate the Variable:**
   - To solve for \( x \), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation.
   - Start by eliminating the constant term on the left side. Subtract 3 from both sides of the equation:
     \[
     2x + 3 - 3 = 11 - 3
     \]
     Simplifying both sides, we get:
     \[
     2x = 8
     \]

3. **Solve for \( x \):**
   - Now, divide both sides of the equation by 2 to solve for \( x \):
     \[
     \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{8}{2}
     \]
     Simplifying both sides, we find:
     \[
     x = 4
     \]

4. **Verify the Solution:**
   - Substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies the equation:
     \[
     2(4) + 3 = 11
     \]
     Simplifying the left side, we get:
     \[
     8 + 3 = 11
     \]
     Since both sides of the equation are equal, our solution is verified.

5. **State the Final Answer:**
   - The value of \( x \) that satisfies the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \) is \( x = 4 \).

**Final Answer:**
\( x = 4 \)

This approach demonstrates a clear, step-by-step method for solving a linear equation. If you have a specific problem or need further assistance, please provide more details, and I'll be happy to help!
