Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 138" entails. Since the problem statement does not provide specific details about the question, I will outline a general approach to solving reasoning questions and then apply it to a hypothetical math problem.

### General Approach to Solving Reasoning Questions:

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - Carefully read the problem statement.
   - Identify what is being asked.
   - Determine what information is given and what needs to be found.

2. **Plan a Solution:**
   - Consider different strategies to solve the problem.
   - Choose the most efficient method based on the given information.

3. **Execute the Plan:**
   - Carry out the calculations or logical steps needed to solve the problem.
   - Keep track of all work to ensure accuracy.

4. **Review and Verify:**
   - Check the solution for correctness.
   - Ensure that the answer makes sense in the context of the problem.

### Hypothetical Math Problem:

Let's assume "Sample reasoning question 138" is a math problem involving algebra. Here's a hypothetical problem:

**Problem:** Solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 3x + 5 = 20 \).

#### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We need to solve for \( x \) in the linear equation \( 3x + 5 = 20 \).

2. **Plan a Solution:**
   - To isolate \( x \), we need to perform operations that will leave \( x \) on one side of the equation.

3. **Execute the Plan:**
   - Start by subtracting 5 from both sides of the equation to eliminate the constant term on the left side:
     \[
     3x + 5 - 5 = 20 - 5
     \]
     \[
     3x = 15
     \]

   - Next, divide both sides by 3 to solve for \( x \):
     \[
     \frac{3x}{3} = \frac{15}{3}
     \]
     \[
     x = 5
     \]

4. **Review and Verify:**
   - Substitute \( x = 5 \) back into the original equation to verify the solution:
     \[
     3(5) + 5 = 20
     \]
     \[
     15 + 5 = 20
     \]
     \[
     20 = 20
     \]
   - The left side equals the right side, confirming that \( x = 5 \) is the correct solution.

### Final Answer:

The solution to the equation \( 3x + 5 = 20 \) is \( x = 5 \).

This approach demonstrates how to solve a reasoning question by breaking it down into understandable steps, even when the specific details of "Sample reasoning question 138" are not provided.
