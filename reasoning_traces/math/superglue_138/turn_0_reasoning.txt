==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 138" entails. Since the problem statement doesn't provide specific details or context, I'll assume it's a generic math problem that requires logical reasoning and problem-solving skills. Let's create a sample math problem and solve it step by step.

**Sample Problem:**

A farmer has a rectangular field that is 120 meters long and 80 meters wide. He wants to divide the field into smaller, equal-sized square plots. What is the largest possible side length of each square plot?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We have a rectangular field with dimensions 120 meters by 80 meters.
   - We need to divide this field into square plots of equal size.
   - The goal is to find the largest possible side length for these square plots.

2. **Identify the Mathematical Concept:**
   - The problem involves finding the largest square that can fit into both dimensions of the rectangle.
   - This requires finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the two dimensions.

3. **Calculate the GCD:**
   - The dimensions of the field are 120 meters and 80 meters.
   - We need to find the GCD of 120 and 80.

4. **Use the Euclidean Algorithm:**
   - The Euclidean algorithm is a method for finding the GCD of two numbers.
   - Start with the larger number, 120, and divide it by the smaller number, 80.
   - Calculate the remainder: \( 120 \div 80 = 1 \) remainder \( 40 \).
   - Replace the larger number with the smaller number (80) and the smaller number with the remainder (40).
   - Repeat the process: \( 80 \div 40 = 2 \) remainder \( 0 \).
   - Since the remainder is now 0, the last non-zero remainder is the GCD.

5. **Determine the GCD:**
   - The GCD of 120 and 80 is 40.

6. **Interpret the Result:**
   - The largest possible side length of each square plot is 40 meters.
   - This means the field can be divided into square plots that are 40 meters on each side.

7. **Verify the Solution:**
   - Check if 40 meters divides both dimensions of the field evenly:
     - \( 120 \div 40 = 3 \) (exact division)
     - \( 80 \div 40 = 2 \) (exact division)
   - Both dimensions are divisible by 40, confirming the solution is correct.

**Final Answer:**

The largest possible side length of each square plot is 40 meters.
