==================================================

To solve the problem, I need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 84" refers to. Since I don't have access to external databases or specific documents, I will assume this is a hypothetical math problem. Without specific details, I'll create a sample math problem and solve it step by step.

Let's assume "Sample reasoning question 84" is a problem involving algebra, specifically solving for \( x \) in a quadratic equation. Here's a sample problem:

**Problem:**
Solve the quadratic equation \( 2x^2 - 4x - 6 = 0 \).

**Step-by-step Solution:**

1. **Identify the quadratic equation:**
   The given equation is \( 2x^2 - 4x - 6 = 0 \).

2. **Simplify the equation:**
   Check if the equation can be simplified by dividing all terms by a common factor. Here, all terms are divisible by 2:
   \[
   \frac{2x^2}{2} - \frac{4x}{2} - \frac{6}{2} = 0 \implies x^2 - 2x - 3 = 0
   \]

3. **Factor the quadratic equation:**
   We need to find two numbers that multiply to \(-3\) (the constant term) and add to \(-2\) (the coefficient of \(x\)). The numbers \(-3\) and \(1\) satisfy these conditions:
   \[
   (x - 3)(x + 1) = 0
   \]

4. **Solve for \(x\):**
   Set each factor equal to zero and solve for \(x\):
   \[
   x - 3 = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad x + 1 = 0
   \]
   \[
   x = 3 \quad \text{or} \quad x = -1
   \]

5. **Verify the solutions:**
   Substitute \(x = 3\) and \(x = -1\) back into the original equation to verify:
   - For \(x = 3\):
     \[
     2(3)^2 - 4(3) - 6 = 18 - 12 - 6 = 0
     \]
   - For \(x = -1\):
     \[
     2(-1)^2 - 4(-1) - 6 = 2 + 4 - 6 = 0
     \]

Both solutions satisfy the original equation.

**Final Answer:**
The solutions to the quadratic equation \( 2x^2 - 4x - 6 = 0 \) are \( x = 3 \) and \( x = -1 \).
