==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to understand the context and the specific question being asked. However, the question "Sample reasoning question 84" is not detailed enough for me to provide a specific solution. Instead, I'll demonstrate how to approach a typical math problem by using a structured reasoning process.

Let's assume a sample math problem for demonstration:

**Problem:**
A rectangle has a length that is twice its width. If the perimeter of the rectangle is 36 units, what are the dimensions of the rectangle?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We have a rectangle with a length (L) and a width (W).
   - The length is twice the width: \( L = 2W \).
   - The perimeter of the rectangle is given as 36 units.

2. **Recall the Formula for Perimeter:**
   - The perimeter (P) of a rectangle is given by the formula: 
     \[
     P = 2L + 2W
     \]

3. **Substitute Known Values:**
   - Substitute the expression for L into the perimeter formula:
     \[
     36 = 2(2W) + 2W
     \]

4. **Simplify the Equation:**
   - Simplify the equation:
     \[
     36 = 4W + 2W
     \]
     \[
     36 = 6W
     \]

5. **Solve for W:**
   - Divide both sides by 6 to solve for W:
     \[
     W = \frac{36}{6} = 6
     \]

6. **Find the Length:**
   - Use the relationship \( L = 2W \) to find L:
     \[
     L = 2 \times 6 = 12
     \]

7. **Verify the Solution:**
   - Check that these dimensions satisfy the original perimeter condition:
     \[
     P = 2L + 2W = 2(12) + 2(6) = 24 + 12 = 36
     \]
   - The perimeter matches the given value, confirming our solution is correct.

**Final Answer:**
The dimensions of the rectangle are 12 units for the length and 6 units for the width.

This structured approach ensures that we understand the problem, apply the correct formulas, and verify our solution. If you have a specific problem or need further assistance, please provide more details, and I'll be happy to help!
