==================================================

To solve the problem, I need more specific information about "Sample reasoning question 84." Since the question is not provided, I'll demonstrate how to approach a typical math problem by solving an example problem. Let's assume the problem is as follows:

**Example Problem:**

A car travels from Town A to Town B at a speed of 60 km/h and returns from Town B to Town A at a speed of 40 km/h. If the total travel time is 5 hours, what is the distance between Town A and Town B?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( d \) be the distance between Town A and Town B in kilometers.

2. **Set Up Equations Based on the Problem:**
   - The time taken to travel from Town A to Town B at 60 km/h is \( \frac{d}{60} \) hours.
   - The time taken to return from Town B to Town A at 40 km/h is \( \frac{d}{40} \) hours.

3. **Total Travel Time:**
   - According to the problem, the total travel time is 5 hours. Therefore, we can write the equation:
     \[
     \frac{d}{60} + \frac{d}{40} = 5
     \]

4. **Solve the Equation:**
   - To solve for \( d \), find a common denominator for the fractions. The least common multiple of 60 and 40 is 120.
   - Rewrite the equation with the common denominator:
     \[
     \frac{2d}{120} + \frac{3d}{120} = 5
     \]
   - Combine the fractions:
     \[
     \frac{5d}{120} = 5
     \]
   - Simplify the equation by multiplying both sides by 120 to eliminate the fraction:
     \[
     5d = 600
     \]
   - Divide both sides by 5 to solve for \( d \):
     \[
     d = 120
     \]

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The distance between Town A and Town B is 120 kilometers.

**Final Answer:**

The distance between Town A and Town B is 120 km.
