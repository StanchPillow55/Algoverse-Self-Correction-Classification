To solve the problem, we will follow these steps:

1. **Determine the number of cars Joe has.**
2. **Calculate the number of cars Joe sells.**
3. **Calculate the number of cars Joe gives to his mother.**
4. **Determine how many cars Joe has left after selling and giving away.**

### Step 1: Determine the number of cars Joe has.

We know that Robert has 20 cars. According to the problem, Joe has twice as many cars as Robert.

\[
\text{Number of cars Joe has} = 2 \times \text{Number of cars Robert has} = 2 \times 20 = 40
\]

So, Joe has 40 cars.

### Step 2: Calculate the number of cars Joe sells.

Joe sells 20% of his cars. To find out how many cars that is, we calculate 20% of 40.

\[
\text{Number of cars sold} = 20\% \times 40 = \frac{20}{100} \times 40 = 0.2 \times 40 = 8
\]

Joe sells 8 cars.

### Step 3: Calculate the number of cars Joe gives to his mother.

According to the problem, Joe gives away twice as many cars as the number he sold to his mother. Since he sold 8 cars, he gives away:

\[
\text{Number of cars given to mother} = 2 \times \text{Number of cars sold} = 2 \times 8 = 16
\]

Joe gives 16 cars to his mother.

### Step 4: Determine how many cars Joe has left.

Now we need to calculate how many cars Joe has left after selling and giving away cars. 

Starting with the original number of cars Joe had (40), we subtract the number of cars he sold (8) and the number of cars he gave to his mother (16):

\[
\text{Number of cars left} = \text{Original number of cars} - \text{Number of cars sold} - \text{Number of cars given to mother}
\]

\[
\text{Number of cars left} = 40 - 8 - 16 = 40 - 24 = 16
\]

### Final Answer

Joe has **16 cars** remaining after selling and giving some to his mother.
