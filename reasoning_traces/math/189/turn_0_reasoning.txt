To solve the problem, we will define the ages of each character based on the relationships given in the problem. Let's denote the ages of the characters as follows:

- Let \( T \) be Thor's age.
- Let \( C \) be Captain America's age.
- Let \( P \) be Peter Parker's age.
- Let \( I \) be Ironman's age.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:

1. Thor is 13 times older than Captain America:
   \[
   T = 13C
   \]

2. Captain America is 7 times older than Peter Parker:
   \[
   C = 7P
   \]

3. Ironman is 32 years older than Peter Parker:
   \[
   I = P + 32
   \]

We are given that Thor is 1456 years old:
\[
T = 1456
\]

Now, we can substitute \( T \) into the first equation to find Captain America's age \( C \):
\[
1456 = 13C
\]
To find \( C \), we divide both sides by 13:
\[
C = \frac{1456}{13}
\]
Calculating this gives:
\[
C = 112
\]

Now that we have Captain America's age, we can find Peter Parker's age \( P \) using the second equation:
\[
C = 7P \implies 112 = 7P
\]
Dividing both sides by 7 gives:
\[
P = \frac{112}{7} = 16
\]

Now we have Peter Parker's age. We can now find Ironman's age \( I \) using the third equation:
\[
I = P + 32 = 16 + 32 = 48
\]

Thus, Ironman's age is:
\[
\boxed{48}
\]
