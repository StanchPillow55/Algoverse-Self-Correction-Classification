==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine the ages of Captain America, Peter Parker, and Ironman based on the information given about Thor's age.

1. **Determine Captain America's Age:**
   - We know that Thor is 13 times older than Captain America.
   - Let \( C \) represent Captain America's age.
   - According to the problem, Thor's age is 1456 years.
   - Therefore, we can write the equation: 
     \[
     13C = 1456
     \]
   - To find \( C \), divide both sides by 13:
     \[
     C = \frac{1456}{13} = 112
     \]
   - So, Captain America is 112 years old.

2. **Determine Peter Parker's Age:**
   - Captain America is 7 times older than Peter Parker.
   - Let \( P \) represent Peter Parker's age.
   - We have the equation:
     \[
     7P = 112
     \]
   - To find \( P \), divide both sides by 7:
     \[
     P = \frac{112}{7} = 16
     \]
   - So, Peter Parker is 16 years old.

3. **Determine Ironman's Age:**
   - Ironman is 32 years older than Peter Parker.
   - We know Peter Parker's age is 16.
   - Therefore, Ironman's age is:
     \[
     16 + 32 = 48
     \]

Thus, Ironman is 48 years old.

**Final Answer: Ironman is 48 years old.**
