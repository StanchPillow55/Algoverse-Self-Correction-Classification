==================================================

To solve the problem, we will break it down into parts and calculate each expense step by step.

1. **Calculate the total cost of the tickets:**
   The friends spent $20.25 on 3 tickets. This amount is already given, so we can denote:
   \[
   \text{Cost of tickets} = 20.25
   \]

2. **Calculate the cost of food:**
   The problem states that they spent $4.50 less on food than on the tickets. Therefore, we can calculate the cost of food as follows:
   \[
   \text{Cost of food} = \text{Cost of tickets} - 4.50 = 20.25 - 4.50 = 15.75
   \]

3. **Calculate the total cost of the rides:**
   They went on 2 rides, and each ride costs $33. Thus, the total cost for the rides is:
   \[
   \text{Cost of rides} = 2 \times 33 = 66
   \]

4. **Calculate the total expenses:**
   Now, we will sum up all the expenses (tickets, food, and rides):
   \[
   \text{Total expenses} = \text{Cost of tickets} + \text{Cost of food} + \text{Cost of rides}
   \]
   Substituting the values we calculated:
   \[
   \text{Total expenses} = 20.25 + 15.75 + 66 = 102
   \]

5. **Calculate the amount each friend pays:**
   Since there are 3 friends who agreed to split the total expenses evenly, we divide the total expenses by 3:
   \[
   \text{Amount each friend pays} = \frac{\text{Total expenses}}{3} = \frac{102}{3} = 34
   \]

Thus, each friend pays **$34.00**.

Final answer:
\[
\text{Each friend pays} = 34.00
\]
