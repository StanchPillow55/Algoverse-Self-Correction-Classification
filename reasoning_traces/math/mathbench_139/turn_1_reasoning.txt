==================================================

To solve the problem, I need more specific information about "Sample math problem 139" as it is not provided in your question. However, I can guide you through a generic approach to solving math problems by explaining the steps typically involved. If you provide the specific details of the problem, I can give a more tailored solution. Here's a general approach:

### Step-by-Step Problem Solving Approach

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - Carefully read the problem statement.
   - Identify what is being asked.
   - Determine the information given and what needs to be found.

2. **Devise a Plan:**
   - Consider possible strategies to solve the problem, such as drawing a diagram, creating an equation, or breaking the problem into smaller parts.
   - Choose the most appropriate method based on the problem type (e.g., algebra, geometry, calculus).

3. **Carry Out the Plan:**
   - Execute the chosen strategy step by step.
   - Perform calculations carefully and systematically.
   - Keep track of units and ensure consistency throughout the calculations.

4. **Check Your Work:**
   - Review each step to ensure accuracy.
   - Verify that the solution makes sense in the context of the problem.
   - Check calculations for any arithmetic errors.

5. **State the Final Answer:**
   - Clearly present the final answer, ensuring it addresses the question asked.
   - Include units if applicable.

### Example Problem and Solution

Let's consider an example problem: "Solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \)."

**Step 1: Understand the Problem**
- We need to find the value of \( x \) that satisfies the equation.

**Step 2: Devise a Plan**
- We can solve this linear equation by isolating \( x \).

**Step 3: Carry Out the Plan**
- Start with the equation: \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).
- Subtract 3 from both sides to isolate the term with \( x \):
  \[
  2x + 3 - 3 = 11 - 3 \implies 2x = 8
  \]
- Divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( x \):
  \[
  \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{8}{2} \implies x = 4
  \]

**Step 4: Check Your Work**
- Substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation to verify:
  \[
  2(4) + 3 = 8 + 3 = 11
  \]
- The left side equals the right side, confirming our solution is correct.

**Step 5: State the Final Answer**
- The solution to the equation is \( x = 4 \).
