==================================================

To solve the problem, I need more information about "Sample math problem 139" as it is not specified in your request. However, I can guide you through a general approach to solving math problems step by step. If you provide the specific details of the problem, I can give a more targeted solution. Here's a general framework for solving math problems:

### Step 1: Understand the Problem
- **Read the problem carefully.** Make sure you understand what is being asked.
- **Identify the type of problem.** Is it algebra, geometry, calculus, etc.?
- **Determine what information is given** and what needs to be found.

### Step 2: Devise a Plan
- **Choose a strategy** to solve the problem. Common strategies include:
  - Drawing a diagram
  - Creating an equation
  - Looking for patterns
  - Breaking the problem into smaller parts
  - Working backwards

### Step 3: Carry Out the Plan
- **Execute your chosen strategy** step by step.
- **Perform calculations** carefully and check each step.
- **Keep track of units** if applicable.

### Step 4: Review/Check Your Work
- **Verify your solution.** Does it make sense in the context of the problem?
- **Check your calculations** for errors.
- **Consider alternative methods** to see if they yield the same result.

### Example Problem
Let's apply this framework to a sample problem:

**Problem:** Solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).

#### Step 1: Understand the Problem
- We need to find the value of \( x \) that satisfies the equation.

#### Step 2: Devise a Plan
- We will isolate \( x \) by performing algebraic operations.

#### Step 3: Carry Out the Plan
1. Start with the equation:  
   \[
   2x + 3 = 11
   \]
2. Subtract 3 from both sides to isolate the term with \( x \):  
   \[
   2x + 3 - 3 = 11 - 3
   \]
   \[
   2x = 8
   \]
3. Divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( x \):  
   \[
   \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{8}{2}
   \]
   \[
   x = 4
   \]

#### Step 4: Review/Check Your Work
- Substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation to verify:  
  \[
  2(4) + 3 = 8 + 3 = 11
  \]
- The left-hand side equals the right-hand side, confirming our solution is correct.

### Final Answer
The solution to the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \) is \( x = 4 \).

If you provide the specific details of "Sample math problem 139," I can offer a detailed solution tailored to that problem.
