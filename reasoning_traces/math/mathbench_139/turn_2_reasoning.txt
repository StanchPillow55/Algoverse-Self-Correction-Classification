==================================================

To solve the problem, I need more specific information about "Sample math problem 139." Since the problem is not provided, I'll demonstrate how to solve a generic math problem step by step. Let's consider a common type of problem: solving a quadratic equation.

**Problem:** Solve the quadratic equation \(2x^2 - 4x - 6 = 0\).

**Step 1: Identify the coefficients.**

The standard form of a quadratic equation is \(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\). For the equation \(2x^2 - 4x - 6 = 0\), the coefficients are:
- \(a = 2\)
- \(b = -4\)
- \(c = -6\)

**Step 2: Calculate the discriminant.**

The discriminant (\(\Delta\)) of a quadratic equation is given by the formula \(\Delta = b^2 - 4ac\). It helps determine the nature of the roots.

\[
\Delta = (-4)^2 - 4 \times 2 \times (-6) = 16 + 48 = 64
\]

**Step 3: Determine the nature of the roots.**

Since the discriminant \(\Delta = 64\) is positive, the quadratic equation has two distinct real roots.

**Step 4: Use the quadratic formula to find the roots.**

The quadratic formula is:

\[
x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{\Delta}}{2a}
\]

Substitute the values of \(a\), \(b\), and \(\Delta\) into the formula:

\[
x = \frac{-(-4) \pm \sqrt{64}}{2 \times 2} = \frac{4 \pm 8}{4}
\]

**Step 5: Calculate the two possible values for \(x\).**

1. First root:

\[
x_1 = \frac{4 + 8}{4} = \frac{12}{4} = 3
\]

2. Second root:

\[
x_2 = \frac{4 - 8}{4} = \frac{-4}{4} = -1
\]

**Step 6: State the final answer.**

The solutions to the quadratic equation \(2x^2 - 4x - 6 = 0\) are \(x = 3\) and \(x = -1\).

Final Answer: \(x = 3\) and \(x = -1\).
