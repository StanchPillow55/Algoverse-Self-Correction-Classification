Question ID: mathbench_139
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem effectively, I'll need more specific information about "Sample math problem 139" as it is not provided in your question. However, I can guide you through a general approach to solving math problems step by step. If you provide the specific details of the problem, I can tailor the solution to that.

Here's a general approach to solving math problems:

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - Read the problem carefully.
   - Identify what is being asked.
   - Determine what information is given and what needs to be found.

2. **Devise a Plan:**
   - Consider possible strategies to solve the problem, such as drawing a diagram, creating an equation, or breaking the problem into smaller parts.

3. **Carry Out the Plan:**
   - Execute the chosen strategy step by step.
   - Perform calculations carefully and check each step for accuracy.

4. **Review/Check the Solution:**
   - Verify that the solution makes sense in the context of the problem.
   - Double-check calculations and ensure all parts of the problem are addressed.

Since I don't have the specific details of "Sample math problem 139," I can't provide a detailed solution. However, if you provide the problem, I can apply this approach to solve it and show all the work and reasoning involved.
