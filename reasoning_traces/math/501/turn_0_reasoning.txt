To find out how many yards of yarn Mariah and her grandma used altogether, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine how much yarn Mariah used in yards**:
   - Mariah used \( \frac{1}{4} \) of a skein of yarn.
   - Since there are 364 yards in a skein, we calculate Mariah's usage:
   \[
   \text{Yards used by Mariah} = \frac{1}{4} \times 364
   \]
   - Performing the multiplication:
   \[
   \frac{1}{4} \times 364 = \frac{364}{4} = 91 \text{ yards}
   \]

2. **Determine how much yarn her grandma used in yards**:
   - Her grandma used \( \frac{1}{2} \) of a skein of yarn.
   - We calculate her grandma's usage:
   \[
   \text{Yards used by Grandma} = \frac{1}{2} \times 364
   \]
   - Performing the multiplication:
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} \times 364 = \frac{364}{2} = 182 \text{ yards}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total yarn used by both Mariah and her grandma**:
   - Now we add the yards used by Mariah and her grandma:
   \[
   \text{Total yards used} = \text{Yards used by Mariah} + \text{Yards used by Grandma}
   \]
   - Substituting the values we calculated:
   \[
   \text{Total yards used} = 91 + 182
   \]
   - Performing the addition:
   \[
   91 + 182 = 273 \text{ yards}
   \]

Thus, the total amount of yarn that Mariah and her grandma used altogether is \( \boxed{273} \) yards.
