==================================================

To find out how much John paid for his gym memberships in the first year, we need to calculate the total costs for both gyms.

1. **Calculate the cost of the first gym membership:**
   - Monthly cost: $10
   - Sign-up fee: $50
   - Total cost for the first year (12 months):
     \[
     \text{Total cost for first gym} = (\text{Monthly cost} \times 12) + \text{Sign-up fee}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total cost for first gym} = (10 \times 12) + 50 = 120 + 50 = 170
     \]

2. **Calculate the cost of the second gym membership:**
   - The second gym is 3 times more expensive than the first gym:
     \[
     \text{Monthly cost for second gym} = 3 \times 10 = 30
     \]
   - The sign-up fee for the second gym is 4 months of membership:
     \[
     \text{Sign-up fee for second gym} = 4 \times \text{Monthly cost for second gym} = 4 \times 30 = 120
     \]
   - Total cost for the second gym for the first year (12 months):
     \[
     \text{Total cost for second gym} = (\text{Monthly cost} \times 12) + \text{Sign-up fee}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total cost for second gym} = (30 \times 12) + 120 = 360 + 120 = 480
     \]

3. **Calculate the total cost for both gyms:**
   \[
   \text{Total cost for both gyms} = \text{Total cost for first gym} + \text{Total cost for second gym}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total cost for both gyms} = 170 + 480 = 650
   \]

Therefore, the total amount John paid for gym memberships in the first year is **$650**.
