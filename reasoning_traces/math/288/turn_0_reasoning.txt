==================================================

To determine how many trucks are needed to transport 80 flagstones, we will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total weight of the flagstones.**
   Each flagstone weighs 75 pounds. Therefore, the total weight of 80 flagstones can be calculated as follows:

   \[
   \text{Total weight} = \text{Number of flagstones} \times \text{Weight of each flagstone}
   \]

   Substituting the values:

   \[
   \text{Total weight} = 80 \times 75
   \]

   Now, we perform the multiplication:

   \[
   80 \times 75 = 6000 \text{ pounds}
   \]

2. **Determine the capacity of one truck.**
   The delivery truck can carry a total weight of 2000 pounds.

3. **Calculate the number of trucks needed.**
   To find out how many trucks are required to transport the total weight of 6000 pounds, we divide the total weight by the capacity of one truck:

   \[
   \text{Number of trucks} = \frac{\text{Total weight}}{\text{Truck capacity}}
   \]

   Substituting the values:

   \[
   \text{Number of trucks} = \frac{6000}{2000}
   \]

   Performing the division:

   \[
   \frac{6000}{2000} = 3
   \]

4. **Conclusion.**
   Therefore, the landscaping company will need **3 trucks** to transport 80 flagstones in one trip.

Final answer: **3 trucks**.
