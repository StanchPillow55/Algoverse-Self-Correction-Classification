To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of both gym memberships for the first year, including both the monthly fees and the sign-up fees.

### Step 1: Calculate the cost of the first gym membership

1. **Monthly Fee**: The first gym costs $10 per month.
2. **Sign-up Fee**: The sign-up fee for the first gym is $50.

For the first gym, the total cost for one year (12 months) is calculated as follows:

- Monthly cost for 12 months: \( 12 \times 10 = 120 \) dollars
- Total cost for the first gym: \( 120 + 50 = 170 \) dollars

### Step 2: Calculate the cost of the second gym membership

1. **Monthly Fee**: The second gym is 3 times more expensive than the first gym. Therefore, the monthly fee is:
   \[
   3 \times 10 = 30 \text{ dollars per month}
   \]

2. **Sign-up Fee**: The sign-up fee for the second gym is equivalent to 4 months of membership. Therefore, the sign-up fee is:
   \[
   4 \times 30 = 120 \text{ dollars}
   \]

For the second gym, the total cost for one year (12 months) is calculated as follows:

- Monthly cost for 12 months: \( 12 \times 30 = 360 \) dollars
- Total cost for the second gym: \( 360 + 120 = 480 \) dollars

### Step 3: Calculate the total cost for both gym memberships

Finally, we add the total costs of both gym memberships to find the total amount John paid in the first year:

- Total cost for the first gym: \( 170 \) dollars
- Total cost for the second gym: \( 480 \) dollars

Adding these together gives:

\[
170 + 480 = 650 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Conclusion

The total amount John paid in the first year for both gym memberships is \(\boxed{650}\) dollars.
