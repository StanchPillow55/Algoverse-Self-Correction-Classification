To find out how much John paid for his gym memberships in the first year, we need to break down the costs for each gym membership.

### Step 1: Calculate the costs for the first gym membership.

1. **Monthly Cost**: The first gym costs $10 per month.
2. **Sign-up Fee**: The sign-up fee for the first gym is $50.

**Total Cost for the First Gym in One Year**:
- There are 12 months in a year, so the total monthly cost for the first gym is:
  \[
  12 \text{ months} \times 10 \text{ dollars/month} = 120 \text{ dollars}
  \]
- Adding the sign-up fee:
  \[
  120 \text{ dollars} + 50 \text{ dollars} = 170 \text{ dollars}
  \]

### Step 2: Calculate the costs for the second gym membership.

1. **Monthly Cost**: The second gym is 3 times more expensive than the first gym. Therefore, the monthly cost for the second gym is:
   \[
   3 \times 10 \text{ dollars} = 30 \text{ dollars/month}
   \]
2. **Sign-up Fee**: The sign-up fee for the second gym is 4 months of membership. Therefore, the sign-up fee is:
   \[
   4 \times 30 \text{ dollars/month} = 120 \text{ dollars}
   \]

**Total Cost for the Second Gym in One Year**:
- The total monthly cost for the second gym for 12 months is:
  \[
  12 \text{ months} \times 30 \text{ dollars/month} = 360 \text{ dollars}
  \]
- Adding the sign-up fee:
  \[
  360 \text{ dollars} + 120 \text{ dollars} = 480 \text{ dollars}
  \]

### Step 3: Calculate the total cost for both gym memberships.

Now, we add the total costs of both gym memberships:
\[
170 \text{ dollars (first gym)} + 480 \text{ dollars (second gym)} = 650 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Final Answer:
John paid a total of **$650** for gym memberships in the first year.
