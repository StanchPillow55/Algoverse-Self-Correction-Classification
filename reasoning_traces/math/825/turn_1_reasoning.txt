Question ID: 825
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

Let \( B \) represent the number of cards Becca has, \( S \) represent the number of cards Smendrick has, and \( P \) represent the number of cards PJ has. We can set up the following equations based on the information given:

1. The total number of cards is:
   \[
   B + S + P = 341
   \]

2. Becca has 12 more cards than Smendrick:
   \[
   B = S + 12
   \]

3. Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has:
   \[
   S = 3P
   \]

Now, we can substitute the expressions for \( B \) and \( S \) into the first equation.

First, substitute \( S = 3P \) into the equation for \( B \):
\[
B = 3P + 12
\]

Now substitute both \( B \) and \( S \) into the total cards equation:
\[
(3P + 12) + (3P) + P = 341
\]

Combine like terms:
\[
3P + 12 + 3P + P = 341
\]
\[
7P + 12 = 341
\]

Next, isolate \( P \) by subtracting 12 from both sides:
\[
7P = 341 - 12
\]
\[
7P = 329
\]

Now, divide by 7 to solve for \( P \):
\[
P = \frac{329}{7} = 47
\]

Now that we have \( P \), we can find \( S \):
\[
S = 3P = 3 \times 47 = 141
\]

Next, we can find \( B \):
\[
B = S + 12 = 141 + 12 = 153
\]

Finally, we can verify the total:
\[
B + S + P = 153 + 141 + 47 = 341
\]

Since the total is correct, we conclude that Becca has:
\[
\boxed{153}
\] cards.
