==================================================

Let's define the variables for the number of cards each person has:

- Let \( P \) be the number of cards PJ has.
- Let \( S \) be the number of cards Smendrick has.
- Let \( B \) be the number of cards Becca has.

From the problem, we have the following relationships:

1. The total number of cards is 341:
   \[
   B + S + P = 341
   \]

2. Becca has 12 more cards than Smendrick:
   \[
   B = S + 12
   \]

3. Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has:
   \[
   S = 3P
   \]

Now, we can substitute the expressions for \( B \) and \( S \) in terms of \( P \) into the total cards equation.

First, substitute \( S = 3P \) into the equation for \( B \):
\[
B = 3P + 12
\]

Now we can substitute both \( B \) and \( S \) into the total cards equation:
\[
(3P + 12) + (3P) + P = 341
\]

Combine like terms:
\[
3P + 12 + 3P + P = 341
\]
\[
7P + 12 = 341
\]

Next, we will isolate \( P \) by subtracting 12 from both sides:
\[
7P = 341 - 12
\]
\[
7P = 329
\]

Now, divide both sides by 7 to find \( P \):
\[
P = \frac{329}{7} = 47
\]

Now that we have \( P \), we can find \( S \) and \( B \).

First, calculate \( S \):
\[
S = 3P = 3 \times 47 = 141
\]

Next, calculate \( B \):
\[
B = S + 12 = 141 + 12 = 153
\]

Now we have:
- \( P = 47 \)
- \( S = 141 \)
- \( B = 153 \)

Finally, let's verify that the total number of cards adds up to 341:
\[
B + S + P = 153 + 141 + 47 = 341
\]

Since the total is correct, we can conclude that the number of cards Becca has is:
\[
\boxed{153}
\]
