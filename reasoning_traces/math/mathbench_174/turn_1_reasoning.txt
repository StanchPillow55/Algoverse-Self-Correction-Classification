==================================================

To solve "Sample math problem 174," we need to first understand what the problem is asking. Since the problem statement is not provided, I'll create a hypothetical math problem and solve it step by step. Let's assume the problem is:

**Problem:**
Solve for \( x \) in the equation:
\[ 3x + 5 = 20 \]

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Equation:**
   The equation given is a linear equation in one variable, \( x \). Our goal is to isolate \( x \) on one side of the equation to find its value.

2. **Isolate the Variable:**
   To isolate \( x \), we need to perform operations that will leave \( x \) alone on one side of the equation.

   \[
   3x + 5 = 20
   \]

   First, subtract 5 from both sides to eliminate the constant term on the left side:

   \[
   3x + 5 - 5 = 20 - 5
   \]

   Simplifying both sides gives:

   \[
   3x = 15
   \]

3. **Solve for \( x \):**
   Now, divide both sides by 3 to solve for \( x \):

   \[
   \frac{3x}{3} = \frac{15}{3}
   \]

   Simplifying both sides gives:

   \[
   x = 5
   \]

4. **Verify the Solution:**
   Substitute \( x = 5 \) back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies the equation:

   \[
   3(5) + 5 = 20
   \]

   Simplifying the left side:

   \[
   15 + 5 = 20
   \]

   \[
   20 = 20
   \]

   Since both sides of the equation are equal, our solution \( x = 5 \) is correct.

**Final Answer:**
\[ x = 5 \]

This is the complete solution to the hypothetical problem based on the given instruction. If you have a specific "Sample math problem 174" in mind, please provide the details, and I can solve that particular problem.
