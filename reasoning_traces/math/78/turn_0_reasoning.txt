==================================================

To solve the problem, we will follow these steps:

1. **Determine the total number of people sharing the cookie pies.**
   - Manny has 24 classmates and 1 teacher, Mr. Keith. 
   - Therefore, the total number of people is:
     \[
     1 \text{ (Manny)} + 24 \text{ (classmates)} + 1 \text{ (Mr. Keith)} = 26 \text{ people}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total number of slices from the cookie pies.**
   - Manny has 3 cookie pies, and each pie is cut into 10 slices.
   - The total number of slices is:
     \[
     3 \text{ (cookie pies)} \times 10 \text{ (slices per pie)} = 30 \text{ slices}
     \]

3. **Determine how many slices are consumed.**
   - Each of the 26 people gets 1 slice, so the total number of slices consumed is:
     \[
     26 \text{ (people)} \times 1 \text{ (slice per person)} = 26 \text{ slices}
     \]

4. **Calculate the number of slices left.**
   - To find the number of slices left after everyone has had a slice, we subtract the number of slices consumed from the total number of slices:
     \[
     30 \text{ (total slices)} - 26 \text{ (slices consumed)} = 4 \text{ slices left}
     \]

Thus, the final answer is that there are **4 slices left**.
