Question ID: 78
Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to determine the total number of slices that Manny had. Since each cookie pie was cut into 10 slices, and he had 3 cookie pies, we multiply 3 by 10 to get 30 slices.

Next, we need to determine how many slices were eaten. Manny, his 24 classmates, and Mr. Keith all had 1 piece. So, we add 1 (for Manny) + 24 (for his classmates) + 1 (for Mr. Keith) to get 26 slices eaten.

Finally, to determine how many slices are left, we subtract the number of slices eaten from the total number of slices. So, we subtract 26 from 30 to get 4 slices.

Therefore, there are 4 slices of cookie pie left.
