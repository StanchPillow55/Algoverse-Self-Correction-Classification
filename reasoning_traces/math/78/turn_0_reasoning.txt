==================================================

To determine how much money Vincent saves by buying 18 flowers at the better price, we first need to calculate the total cost of buying 18 flowers using both packaging options.

### Option 1: Packages of 3 for $2.50

1. **Calculate the number of packages needed:**
   \[
   \text{Number of packages} = \frac{18 \text{ flowers}}{3 \text{ flowers/package}} = 6 \text{ packages}
   \]

2. **Calculate the total cost for 6 packages:**
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = 6 \text{ packages} \times 2.50 \text{ dollars/package} = 15.00 \text{ dollars}
   \]

### Option 2: Packages of 2 for $1

1. **Calculate the number of packages needed:**
   \[
   \text{Number of packages} = \frac{18 \text{ flowers}}{2 \text{ flowers/package}} = 9 \text{ packages}
   \]

2. **Calculate the total cost for 9 packages:**
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = 9 \text{ packages} \times 1 \text{ dollar/package} = 9.00 \text{ dollars}
   \]

### Compare the Costs

Now we compare the total costs from both options:

- Cost of buying 18 flowers in packages of 3: **$15.00**
- Cost of buying 18 flowers in packages of 2: **$9.00**

### Calculate the Savings

To find out how much money Vincent saves by choosing the better price (packages of 2), we subtract the lower cost from the higher cost:

\[
\text{Savings} = \text{Cost with packages of 3} - \text{Cost with packages of 2}
\]
\[
\text{Savings} = 15.00 \text{ dollars} - 9.00 \text{ dollars} = 6.00 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Final Answer

Vincent saves **$6.00** by buying 18 flowers at the better price.
