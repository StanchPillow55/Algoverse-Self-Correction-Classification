==================================================

To determine how much money Vincent saves by buying 18 flowers at the better price, we first need to calculate the total cost of buying 18 flowers using both packaging options.

**Option 1: Packages of 3 for $2.50**

1. Calculate how many packages of 3 are needed for 18 flowers:
   \[
   \text{Number of packages} = \frac{18 \text{ flowers}}{3 \text{ flowers/package}} = 6 \text{ packages}
   \]

2. Calculate the total cost for 6 packages:
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = 6 \text{ packages} \times 2.50 \text{ dollars/package} = 15.00 \text{ dollars}
   \]

**Option 2: Packages of 2 for $1**

1. Calculate how many packages of 2 are needed for 18 flowers:
   \[
   \text{Number of packages} = \frac{18 \text{ flowers}}{2 \text{ flowers/package}} = 9 \text{ packages}
   \]

2. Calculate the total cost for 9 packages:
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = 9 \text{ packages} \times 1 \text{ dollar/package} = 9.00 \text{ dollars}
   \]

**Comparison of Costs:**

- Cost using packages of 3: $15.00
- Cost using packages of 2: $9.00

**Calculate the savings:**
\[
\text{Savings} = \text{Cost with packages of 3} - \text{Cost with packages of 2} = 15.00 - 9.00 = 6.00 \text{ dollars}
\]

Thus, the amount of money Vincent saves by buying 18 flowers at the better price is \(\boxed{6.00}\) dollars.
