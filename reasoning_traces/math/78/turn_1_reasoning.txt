Question ID: 78
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine how many slices of cookie pie are left after Manny, his 24 classmates, and Mr. Keith each have one slice.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of slices.**

Manny has 3 cookie pies, and each pie is cut into 10 slices. Therefore, the total number of slices is calculated as follows:

\[
3 \text{ pies} \times 10 \text{ slices per pie} = 30 \text{ slices}
\]

**Step 2: Determine the total number of people sharing the slices.**

Manny is sharing the cookie pies with his 24 classmates and Mr. Keith. Including Manny himself, the total number of people is:

\[
1 \text{ (Manny)} + 24 \text{ (classmates)} + 1 \text{ (Mr. Keith)} = 26 \text{ people}
\]

**Step 3: Calculate the number of slices consumed.**

Since each person has 1 slice, the total number of slices consumed is equal to the number of people:

\[
26 \text{ people} \times 1 \text{ slice per person} = 26 \text{ slices}
\]

**Step 4: Calculate the number of slices left.**

Subtract the number of slices consumed from the total number of slices:

\[
30 \text{ total slices} - 26 \text{ slices consumed} = 4 \text{ slices left}
\]

Therefore, after everyone has had a slice, there are 4 slices left.

**Final Answer:**

4 slices are left.
