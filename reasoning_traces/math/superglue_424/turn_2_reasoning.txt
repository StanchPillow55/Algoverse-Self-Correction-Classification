Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, let's first understand what "Sample reasoning question 424" might entail. Since the problem is not explicitly stated, I'll create a hypothetical math problem that involves reasoning and problem-solving skills. Let's assume the problem is as follows:

**Problem:**
A farmer has a rectangular field that is 120 meters long and 80 meters wide. He wants to divide the field into smaller, equal-sized square plots. What is the largest possible side length of each square plot?

**Solution:**

To solve this problem, we need to find the largest possible side length of the square plots that can fit perfectly into the rectangular field. This means the side length of the square must be a common divisor of both the length and the width of the rectangle.

1. **Identify the dimensions of the rectangle:**
   - Length of the field = 120 meters
   - Width of the field = 80 meters

2. **Find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the two dimensions:**
   - The GCD of two numbers is the largest number that divides both numbers without leaving a remainder.

3. **List the divisors of each dimension:**
   - Divisors of 120: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 15, 20, 24, 30, 40, 60, 120
   - Divisors of 80: 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 10, 16, 20, 40, 80

4. **Identify the common divisors:**
   - Common divisors of 120 and 80: 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 10, 20, 40

5. **Determine the greatest common divisor:**
   - The greatest common divisor is 40.

6. **Conclusion:**
   - The largest possible side length of each square plot is 40 meters.

Therefore, the largest possible side length of each square plot that can fit perfectly into the rectangular field is **40 meters**.
