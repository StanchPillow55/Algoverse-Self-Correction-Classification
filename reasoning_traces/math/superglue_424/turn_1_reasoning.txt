==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 424" entails. Since the problem statement is not specific, I'll assume a hypothetical math problem and solve it step by step. Let's say the problem is as follows:

**Problem:**
Calculate the sum of the first 424 positive integers.

**Solution:**

To find the sum of the first \( n \) positive integers, we can use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series:

\[
S_n = \frac{n(n + 1)}{2}
\]

where \( S_n \) is the sum of the first \( n \) integers.

In this case, \( n = 424 \). Plugging this value into the formula gives:

\[
S_{424} = \frac{424 \times (424 + 1)}{2}
\]

First, calculate \( 424 + 1 \):

\[
424 + 1 = 425
\]

Next, multiply 424 by 425:

\[
424 \times 425 = 180200
\]

Now, divide the product by 2 to find the sum:

\[
S_{424} = \frac{180200}{2} = 90100
\]

Therefore, the sum of the first 424 positive integers is 90,100.

**Final Answer:**

The sum of the first 424 positive integers is 90,100.
