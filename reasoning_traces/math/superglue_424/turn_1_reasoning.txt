Question ID: superglue_424
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 424" refers to. Since the problem statement does not provide specific details or numbers, I'll assume this is a placeholder for a typical math problem. Let's create a hypothetical math problem and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**

Calculate the area of a triangle with a base of 8 units and a height of 5 units.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Formula:**
   The area \( A \) of a triangle can be calculated using the formula:
   \[
   A = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height}
   \]

2. **Identify the Given Values:**
   - Base (\( b \)) = 8 units
   - Height (\( h \)) = 5 units

3. **Substitute the Values into the Formula:**
   \[
   A = \frac{1}{2} \times 8 \times 5
   \]

4. **Perform the Multiplication:**
   First, multiply the base and the height:
   \[
   8 \times 5 = 40
   \]

5. **Calculate the Area:**
   Now, multiply the result by \(\frac{1}{2}\):
   \[
   A = \frac{1}{2} \times 40 = 20
   \]

6. **State the Final Answer:**
   The area of the triangle is 20 square units.

This solution demonstrates the process of calculating the area of a triangle using the given base and height. If "Sample reasoning question 424" refers to a different problem, please provide more details for an accurate solution.
