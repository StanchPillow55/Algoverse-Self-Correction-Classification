==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 424" entails. Since the question is not explicitly provided, I'll create a hypothetical math problem and solve it step by step.

Let's assume the problem is as follows:

**Problem:**
A rectangle has a length that is 4 units more than its width. The perimeter of the rectangle is 24 units. Find the dimensions of the rectangle.

**Step 1: Understand the problem.**
We are given:
- The perimeter of the rectangle is 24 units.
- The length (L) is 4 units more than the width (W).

**Step 2: Set up equations.**
The formula for the perimeter (P) of a rectangle is:
\[ P = 2L + 2W \]

We know:
\[ 2L + 2W = 24 \]

We also know:
\[ L = W + 4 \]

**Step 3: Substitute and solve for one variable.**
Substitute \( L = W + 4 \) into the perimeter equation:
\[ 2(W + 4) + 2W = 24 \]

Simplify and solve for \( W \):
\[ 2W + 8 + 2W = 24 \]
\[ 4W + 8 = 24 \]
Subtract 8 from both sides:
\[ 4W = 16 \]
Divide by 4:
\[ W = 4 \]

**Step 4: Solve for the other variable.**
Now that we have \( W = 4 \), substitute back to find \( L \):
\[ L = W + 4 = 4 + 4 = 8 \]

**Step 5: Verify the solution.**
Check if the dimensions satisfy the perimeter condition:
\[ 2L + 2W = 2(8) + 2(4) = 16 + 8 = 24 \]

The perimeter is indeed 24, which matches the given condition.

**Final Answer:**
The dimensions of the rectangle are:
- Width (W) = 4 units
- Length (L) = 8 units
