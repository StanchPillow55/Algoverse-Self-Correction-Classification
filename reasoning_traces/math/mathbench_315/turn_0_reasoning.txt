To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample math problem 315" refers to. Since the problem isn't specified, I'll assume it involves the number 315 and create a problem around it. Let's consider a problem involving the factors of 315.

**Problem:**  
Find all the prime factors of 315 and express 315 as a product of its prime factors.

**Solution:**

Step 1: **Identify if 315 is divisible by the smallest prime number, 2.**

315 is an odd number, so it is not divisible by 2.

Step 2: **Check divisibility by the next smallest prime number, 3.**

A number is divisible by 3 if the sum of its digits is divisible by 3.  
The sum of the digits of 315 is \(3 + 1 + 5 = 9\).  
Since 9 is divisible by 3, 315 is also divisible by 3.

Now, divide 315 by 3:  
\[ 315 \div 3 = 105 \]

Step 3: **Repeat the process for 105.**

Check if 105 is divisible by 3:  
The sum of the digits of 105 is \(1 + 0 + 5 = 6\).  
Since 6 is divisible by 3, 105 is divisible by 3.

Divide 105 by 3:  
\[ 105 \div 3 = 35 \]

Step 4: **Check divisibility of 35 by the next smallest prime number, 5.**

A number is divisible by 5 if it ends in 0 or 5.  
35 ends in 5, so it is divisible by 5.

Divide 35 by 5:  
\[ 35 \div 5 = 7 \]

Step 5: **Check if 7 is a prime number.**

7 is a prime number because it has no divisors other than 1 and itself.

Step 6: **Compile the prime factors.**

The prime factors of 315 are 3, 3, 5, and 7.  
Thus, 315 can be expressed as a product of its prime factors:  
\[ 315 = 3^2 \times 5 \times 7 \]

**Final Answer:**  
The prime factorization of 315 is \(3^2 \times 5 \times 7\).
