==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample math problem 315" refers to. Since the problem itself is not explicitly stated, I'll assume it involves a mathematical operation or concept related to the number 315. Let's explore a few possibilities:

### Possibility 1: Prime Factorization of 315

One common type of problem involving a number like 315 is finding its prime factorization. Let's work through this:

1. **Divide by the smallest prime number**: Start with the smallest prime number, which is 2. Since 315 is odd, it is not divisible by 2.

2. **Next prime number**: Try dividing by 3. The sum of the digits of 315 is \(3 + 1 + 5 = 9\), which is divisible by 3. Therefore, 315 is divisible by 3.
   \[
   315 \div 3 = 105
   \]

3. **Continue with 105**: Check if 105 is divisible by 3. The sum of the digits of 105 is \(1 + 0 + 5 = 6\), which is divisible by 3.
   \[
   105 \div 3 = 35
   \]

4. **Next prime number for 35**: Check divisibility by 5. Since 35 ends in 5, it is divisible by 5.
   \[
   35 \div 5 = 7
   \]

5. **Check 7**: The number 7 is a prime number.

Thus, the prime factorization of 315 is:
\[
315 = 3^2 \times 5 \times 7
\]

### Possibility 2: Divisibility Check

Another possibility is checking if 315 is divisible by a certain number. Let's assume we want to check divisibility by 9.

- **Divisibility by 9**: A number is divisible by 9 if the sum of its digits is divisible by 9. The sum of the digits of 315 is 9, which is divisible by 9. Therefore, 315 is divisible by 9.

### Possibility 3: Calculating the Sum of Digits

Calculate the sum of the digits of 315:

- The digits of 315 are 3, 1, and 5.
- Sum of the digits: \(3 + 1 + 5 = 9\).

### Conclusion

Since the problem "Sample math problem 315" is not explicitly defined, I've explored a few mathematical operations related to the number 315. The prime factorization of 315 is \(3^2 \times 5 \times 7\), it is divisible by 9, and the sum of its digits is 9.

If you have a specific problem involving the number 315, please provide more details, and I can solve it accordingly.
