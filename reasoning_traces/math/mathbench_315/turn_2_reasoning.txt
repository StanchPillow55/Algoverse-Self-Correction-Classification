==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 315," we need to first understand what the problem is asking. However, the problem statement "Sample math problem 315" is not specific enough for me to determine what the problem entails. It seems like a placeholder or a reference to a specific problem in a textbook or a set of problems.

To proceed, I'll assume that "Sample math problem 315" is a placeholder for a generic math problem. Since I don't have the specific details of the problem, I'll demonstrate how to solve a typical math problem involving basic arithmetic or algebra. If you have a specific problem in mind, please provide more details.

Let's consider a sample math problem involving basic algebra:

**Sample Problem:**
Solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 2x + 3 = 15 \).

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Equation:**
   The equation given is \( 2x + 3 = 15 \). Our goal is to solve for \( x \).

2. **Isolate the Variable:**
   To solve for \( x \), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We can start by eliminating the constant term on the left side.

   Subtract 3 from both sides of the equation:
   \[
   2x + 3 - 3 = 15 - 3
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   2x = 12
   \]

3. **Solve for \( x \):**
   Now, we need to solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides of the equation by 2:
   \[
   \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{12}{2}
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   x = 6
   \]

4. **Verify the Solution:**
   To ensure our solution is correct, we can substitute \( x = 6 \) back into the original equation:
   \[
   2(6) + 3 = 15
   \]
   Simplifying the left side gives:
   \[
   12 + 3 = 15
   \]
   Since both sides of the equation are equal, our solution is verified.

**Final Answer:**
The solution to the equation \( 2x + 3 = 15 \) is \( x = 6 \).
