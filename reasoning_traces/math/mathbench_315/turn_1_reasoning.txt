==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 315," we need to first understand what the problem is asking. However, the problem statement "Sample math problem 315" is not specific enough to determine the exact nature of the problem. Since there is no additional context or details provided, I will assume this is a placeholder for a typical math problem. 

To illustrate how I would solve a math problem, let's consider a hypothetical problem that involves the number 315. For example, let's solve the following problem:

**Problem:** Find the prime factorization of 315.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   The problem asks us to find the prime factorization of 315. Prime factorization involves expressing a number as a product of its prime factors.

2. **Start with the Smallest Prime Number:**
   Begin by dividing 315 by the smallest prime number, which is 2. Since 315 is odd, it is not divisible by 2.

3. **Try the Next Prime Number:**
   The next prime number is 3. Check if 315 is divisible by 3 by adding its digits: 3 + 1 + 5 = 9. Since 9 is divisible by 3, 315 is also divisible by 3.

   Divide 315 by 3:
   \[
   315 \div 3 = 105
   \]

4. **Continue Factoring 105:**
   Now, factor 105. Again, check divisibility by 3:
   \[
   1 + 0 + 5 = 6
   \]
   Since 6 is divisible by 3, divide 105 by 3:
   \[
   105 \div 3 = 35
   \]

5. **Factor 35:**
   Next, factor 35. Check divisibility by the next prime number, which is 5. Since 35 ends in 5, it is divisible by 5.

   Divide 35 by 5:
   \[
   35 \div 5 = 7
   \]

6. **Check if 7 is Prime:**
   The number 7 is a prime number.

7. **Write the Prime Factorization:**
   We have divided 315 completely into prime factors. The prime factorization of 315 is:
   \[
   315 = 3 \times 3 \times 5 \times 7
   \]
   Or, using exponents:
   \[
   315 = 3^2 \times 5 \times 7
   \]

**Final Answer:**
The prime factorization of 315 is \(3^2 \times 5 \times 7\).

This is a complete solution to the hypothetical problem based on the number 315. If you have a specific problem labeled "Sample math problem 315," please provide the details so I can assist you further.
