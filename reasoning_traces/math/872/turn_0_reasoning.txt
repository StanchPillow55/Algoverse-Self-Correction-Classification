To solve the problem, we need to determine the cost of soda and water per bottle and then calculate the total cost for David's purchase.

### Step 1: Calculate the cost per bottle of soda

We know that:
- 7 bottles of soda cost $21.00.

To find the cost per bottle of soda, we divide the total cost by the number of bottles:

\[
\text{Cost per bottle of soda} = \frac{\text{Total cost of soda}}{\text{Number of bottles of soda}} = \frac{21.00}{7}
\]

Calculating this gives:

\[
\text{Cost per bottle of soda} = 3.00
\]

So, each bottle of soda costs $3.00.

### Step 2: Calculate the cost per bottle of water

Next, we know that:
- 4 bottles of water cost $8.00.

To find the cost per bottle of water, we divide the total cost by the number of bottles:

\[
\text{Cost per bottle of water} = \frac{\text{Total cost of water}}{\text{Number of bottles of water}} = \frac{8.00}{4}
\]

Calculating this gives:

\[
\text{Cost per bottle of water} = 2.00
\]

So, each bottle of water costs $2.00.

### Step 3: Calculate the total cost for David's purchase

David wants to buy:
- 3 bottles of soda
- 2 bottles of water

Now we can calculate the total cost for each type of beverage.

**Total cost for soda:**

\[
\text{Total cost for soda} = \text{Number of bottles of soda} \times \text{Cost per bottle of soda} = 3 \times 3.00
\]

Calculating this gives:

\[
\text{Total cost for soda} = 9.00
\]

**Total cost for water:**

\[
\text{Total cost for water} = \text{Number of bottles of water} \times \text{Cost per bottle of water} = 2 \times 2.00
\]

Calculating this gives:

\[
\text{Total cost for water} = 4.00
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the total cost for David's entire purchase

Now we add the total costs for soda and water:

\[
\text{Total cost} = \text{Total cost for soda} + \text{Total cost for water} = 9.00 + 4.00
\]

Calculating this gives:

\[
\text{Total cost} = 13.00
\]

### Final Answer

Therefore, the total cost for David to buy 3 bottles of soda and 2 bottles of water is **$13.00**.
