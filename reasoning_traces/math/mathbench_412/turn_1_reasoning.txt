Question ID: mathbench_412
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 412," we need to first understand what the problem is asking. However, the problem statement "Sample math problem 412" is not specific enough for us to determine what the actual mathematical question is. It seems like a placeholder or a reference to a specific problem that is not provided here.

To proceed, let's assume that "Sample math problem 412" refers to a generic math problem, and I'll create a hypothetical problem to solve. Let's assume the problem is as follows:

**Hypothetical Problem 412:**
Solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).

Now, let's solve this hypothetical problem step by step:

### Step 1: Understand the Equation
The equation given is:
\[ 2x + 3 = 11 \]

This is a linear equation in one variable, \( x \).

### Step 2: Isolate the Variable
To solve for \( x \), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We can do this by performing the same operation on both sides of the equation.

#### Subtract 3 from both sides:
\[ 2x + 3 - 3 = 11 - 3 \]

This simplifies to:
\[ 2x = 8 \]

### Step 3: Solve for \( x \)
Now, divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( x \):
\[ \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{8}{2} \]

This simplifies to:
\[ x = 4 \]

### Step 4: Verify the Solution
To ensure our solution is correct, we can substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation and check if both sides are equal.

Substitute \( x = 4 \) into the original equation:
\[ 2(4) + 3 = 11 \]

Calculate the left side:
\[ 8 + 3 = 11 \]

Since both sides of the equation are equal, our solution is verified.

### Final Answer
The solution to the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \) is:
\[ x = 4 \]

This concludes the solution to the hypothetical problem. If you have a specific "Sample math problem 412" in mind, please provide the details, and I will be happy to solve it for you.
