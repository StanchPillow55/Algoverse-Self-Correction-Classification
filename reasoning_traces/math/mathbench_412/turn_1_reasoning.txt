==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 412," we need to first understand what the problem is asking. However, the problem statement "Sample math problem 412" is not specific and doesn't provide any details about the actual mathematical question or context. Therefore, I will assume this is a placeholder or a reference to a specific problem that needs to be addressed.

Since I don't have the details of "Sample math problem 412," I will create a hypothetical math problem and solve it step by step. Let's assume "Sample math problem 412" refers to a problem involving solving a quadratic equation. Here's a step-by-step solution to a sample quadratic equation problem:

**Problem:**
Solve the quadratic equation \(2x^2 - 4x - 6 = 0\).

**Step 1: Identify the coefficients.**
The standard form of a quadratic equation is \(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\). For the equation \(2x^2 - 4x - 6 = 0\), the coefficients are:
- \(a = 2\)
- \(b = -4\)
- \(c = -6\)

**Step 2: Use the quadratic formula.**
The quadratic formula is given by:
\[ x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the discriminant.**
The discriminant (\(D\)) is the part of the quadratic formula under the square root: \(b^2 - 4ac\).
\[ D = (-4)^2 - 4 \times 2 \times (-6) \]
\[ D = 16 + 48 \]
\[ D = 64 \]

**Step 4: Determine the roots using the quadratic formula.**
Since the discriminant is positive (\(D = 64\)), there are two distinct real roots.
\[ x = \frac{-(-4) \pm \sqrt{64}}{2 \times 2} \]
\[ x = \frac{4 \pm 8}{4} \]

**Step 5: Calculate the two roots.**
- For the positive case (\(+\)):
  \[ x = \frac{4 + 8}{4} \]
  \[ x = \frac{12}{4} \]
  \[ x = 3 \]

- For the negative case (\(-\)):
  \[ x = \frac{4 - 8}{4} \]
  \[ x = \frac{-4}{4} \]
  \[ x = -1 \]

**Final Answer:**
The solutions to the quadratic equation \(2x^2 - 4x - 6 = 0\) are \(x = 3\) and \(x = -1\).

If you have a specific problem in mind, please provide the details, and I will be happy to solve it for you.
