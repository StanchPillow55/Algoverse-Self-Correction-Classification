Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve a math problem, we first need to understand the problem statement and identify what is being asked. However, the given input "Sample math problem 412" is not a complete math problem. It appears to be a reference to a specific problem, but without additional context or details, it's impossible to solve it directly.

To proceed, I will create a hypothetical math problem based on the number 412 and solve it step by step. Let's assume the problem is as follows:

**Problem:**
Find the sum of the digits of the number 412 and determine if the sum is a prime number.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Identify the digits of the number 412:**
   - The number 412 consists of the digits 4, 1, and 2.

2. **Calculate the sum of the digits:**
   - Sum = 4 + 1 + 2

3. **Perform the addition:**
   - 4 + 1 = 5
   - 5 + 2 = 7

   Therefore, the sum of the digits is 7.

4. **Determine if the sum is a prime number:**
   - A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.
   - The number 7 is greater than 1.
   - The divisors of 7 are 1 and 7.

   Since 7 has no divisors other than 1 and itself, it is a prime number.

**Final Answer:**
The sum of the digits of the number 412 is 7, and 7 is a prime number.
