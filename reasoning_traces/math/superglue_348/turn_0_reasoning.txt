==================================================

It seems like the question "Sample reasoning question 348" is a placeholder or reference to a specific problem that isn't fully described here. Without additional context or details about the problem, I can't provide a specific solution. However, I can guide you on how to approach solving a math problem step by step.

### General Approach to Solving Math Problems:

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - Read the problem carefully.
   - Identify what is being asked.
   - Note down any given information and what needs to be found.

2. **Devise a Plan:**
   - Think about the mathematical concepts that might apply.
   - Consider different strategies such as drawing a diagram, creating an equation, or breaking the problem into smaller parts.

3. **Carry Out the Plan:**
   - Execute the steps youâ€™ve planned.
   - Perform calculations carefully.
   - Keep track of units and ensure consistency.

4. **Check Your Work:**
   - Review each step to ensure accuracy.
   - Verify that the solution makes sense in the context of the problem.
   - Check calculations and consider alternative methods to confirm results.

5. **State the Final Answer:**
   - Clearly write down the final answer.
   - Include units if applicable.

### Example Problem:

Let's apply this approach to a simple example problem:

**Problem:** A rectangle has a length that is twice its width. If the perimeter of the rectangle is 36 units, find the dimensions of the rectangle.

**Step 1: Understand the Problem**
- We need to find the length and width of the rectangle.
- Given: Length \( L = 2W \) (where \( W \) is the width), Perimeter \( P = 36 \).

**Step 2: Devise a Plan**
- Use the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle: \( P = 2L + 2W \).

**Step 3: Carry Out the Plan**
- Substitute the given values into the perimeter formula:
  \[
  36 = 2(2W) + 2W
  \]
  Simplify the equation:
  \[
  36 = 4W + 2W
  \]
  \[
  36 = 6W
  \]
  Solve for \( W \):
  \[
  W = \frac{36}{6} = 6
  \]
  Now find \( L \):
  \[
  L = 2W = 2 \times 6 = 12
  \]

**Step 4: Check Your Work**
- Verify the perimeter with the found dimensions:
  \[
  P = 2L + 2W = 2(12) + 2(6) = 24 + 12 = 36
  \]
  The calculation is correct.

**Step 5: State the Final Answer**
- The dimensions of the rectangle are: Length = 12 units, Width = 6 units.
