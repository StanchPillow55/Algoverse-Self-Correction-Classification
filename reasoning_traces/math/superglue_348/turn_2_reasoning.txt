==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 348" entails. Since the question is not explicitly provided, let's assume a hypothetical math problem that involves reasoning and calculations. I'll create a problem and solve it step by step.

**Problem:**

A company sells two types of products: Product A and Product B. The company sells Product A for $50 each and Product B for $30 each. In one week, the company sold a total of 200 products, generating a total revenue of $7,000. How many of each product did the company sell?

**Solution:**

To solve this problem, we need to determine how many units of Product A and Product B were sold. Let's define:

- \( x \) as the number of Product A sold.
- \( y \) as the number of Product B sold.

We have two pieces of information that can be translated into equations:

1. The total number of products sold is 200:
   \[
   x + y = 200
   \]

2. The total revenue generated is $7,000. Since Product A sells for $50 and Product B sells for $30, the revenue equation is:
   \[
   50x + 30y = 7000
   \]

Now, we have a system of linear equations:

\[
\begin{align*}
1) & \quad x + y = 200 \\
2) & \quad 50x + 30y = 7000
\end{align*}
\]

**Step 1: Solve the first equation for one variable.**

From equation (1), solve for \( y \):
\[
y = 200 - x
\]

**Step 2: Substitute \( y \) in the second equation.**

Substitute \( y = 200 - x \) into equation (2):
\[
50x + 30(200 - x) = 7000
\]

**Step 3: Simplify and solve for \( x \).**

Distribute the 30:
\[
50x + 6000 - 30x = 7000
\]

Combine like terms:
\[
20x + 6000 = 7000
\]

Subtract 6000 from both sides:
\[
20x = 1000
\]

Divide by 20:
\[
x = 50
\]

**Step 4: Solve for \( y \).**

Substitute \( x = 50 \) back into the equation \( y = 200 - x \):
\[
y = 200 - 50 = 150
\]

**Conclusion:**

The company sold 50 units of Product A and 150 units of Product B.

**Final Answer:**

Product A: 50 units  
Product B: 150 units
