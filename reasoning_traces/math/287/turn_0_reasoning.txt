==================================================

To determine how much Bran still needs to pay for his tuition fee, we will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the scholarship amount**: The scholarship covers 30% of Bran's tuition fee. 
   \[
   \text{Scholarship amount} = 30\% \text{ of } 90 = 0.30 \times 90 = 27
   \]

2. **Calculate the amount Bran needs to pay after the scholarship**: We subtract the scholarship amount from the total tuition fee to find out how much Bran is responsible for.
   \[
   \text{Amount Bran needs to pay} = \text{Total tuition fee} - \text{Scholarship amount}
   \]
   \[
   = 90 - 27 = 63
   \]

3. **Calculate Bran's total earnings from his part-time job over 3 months**: Bran earns $15 per month from his job. Over 3 months, his total earnings will be:
   \[
   \text{Total earnings} = \text{Monthly earnings} \times \text{Number of months}
   \]
   \[
   = 15 \times 3 = 45
   \]

4. **Determine how much Bran still needs to pay after considering his earnings**: We subtract Bran's total earnings from the amount he needs to pay.
   \[
   \text{Amount still needed to pay} = \text{Amount Bran needs to pay} - \text{Total earnings}
   \]
   \[
   = 63 - 45 = 18
   \]

Thus, after considering his scholarship and earnings from his part-time job, Bran still needs to pay **$18**.

Final answer: **$18**.
