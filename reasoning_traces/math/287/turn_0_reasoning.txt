To solve this problem, we need to determine how much Bran still needs to pay for his tuition fee after accounting for his part-time job earnings and his scholarship.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Calculate the scholarship amount:**
   The scholarship covers 30% of Bran's tuition fee. The tuition fee is $90.

   \[
   \text{Scholarship amount} = 0.30 \times 90 = 27
   \]

   So, the scholarship covers $27 of the tuition fee.

2. **Calculate the remaining tuition fee after the scholarship:**
   Subtract the scholarship amount from the total tuition fee to find out how much Bran still needs to pay after the scholarship.

   \[
   \text{Remaining tuition fee} = 90 - 27 = 63
   \]

   Bran still needs to pay $63 after the scholarship is applied.

3. **Calculate Bran's earnings from his part-time job:**
   Bran earns $15 per month from his part-time job. He has 3 months to pay the tuition fee.

   \[
   \text{Total earnings from job} = 15 \times 3 = 45
   \]

   Bran will earn $45 from his part-time job over the 3 months.

4. **Calculate the amount Bran still needs to pay:**
   Subtract Bran's total earnings from the remaining tuition fee after the scholarship.

   \[
   \text{Amount still needed} = 63 - 45 = 18
   \]

   After using his earnings from the part-time job, Bran still needs to pay $18.

Therefore, the final answer is that Bran still needs to pay $18.
