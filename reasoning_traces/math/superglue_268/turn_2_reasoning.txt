==================================================

To solve the problem effectively, I'll need more specific information about "Sample reasoning question 268." Since the question isn't provided, I'll demonstrate how to approach a typical math problem step by step. Let's assume a sample math problem and solve it.

**Sample Problem:**

A rectangle has a length that is twice its width. If the perimeter of the rectangle is 36 units, what are the dimensions of the rectangle?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We have a rectangle with a length (L) and a width (W).
   - The length is twice the width: \( L = 2W \).
   - The perimeter of the rectangle is 36 units.

2. **Recall the Formula for Perimeter:**
   - The perimeter (P) of a rectangle is given by the formula: 
     \[
     P = 2L + 2W
     \]

3. **Substitute the Known Values:**
   - Substitute the expression for L in terms of W into the perimeter formula:
     \[
     36 = 2(2W) + 2W
     \]

4. **Simplify the Equation:**
   - Simplify the equation:
     \[
     36 = 4W + 2W
     \]
     \[
     36 = 6W
     \]

5. **Solve for W:**
   - Divide both sides by 6 to solve for W:
     \[
     W = \frac{36}{6} = 6
     \]

6. **Find the Length (L):**
   - Since \( L = 2W \), substitute W = 6 into the equation for L:
     \[
     L = 2 \times 6 = 12
     \]

7. **Verify the Solution:**
   - Check that the dimensions satisfy the original perimeter condition:
     \[
     P = 2L + 2W = 2(12) + 2(6) = 24 + 12 = 36
     \]
   - The calculated perimeter matches the given perimeter, confirming the solution is correct.

**Final Answer:**
The dimensions of the rectangle are:
- Width (W) = 6 units
- Length (L) = 12 units

This approach demonstrates a systematic way to solve a math problem by understanding the problem, using relevant formulas, substituting known values, solving for unknowns, and verifying the solution.
