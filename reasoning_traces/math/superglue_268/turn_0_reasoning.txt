To solve the problem effectively, I need more information about "Sample reasoning question 268." Since the question is not provided in your prompt, I'll guide you through a general approach to solving math problems step by step. If you have a specific problem, please provide the details, and I'll be happy to help with that.

### General Approach to Solving Math Problems

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - Read the problem carefully to understand what is being asked.
   - Identify the knowns (given information) and unknowns (what you need to find).

2. **Devise a Plan:**
   - Think about the mathematical concepts that might apply (e.g., algebra, geometry, calculus).
   - Consider similar problems you have solved before and the strategies you used.

3. **Carry Out the Plan:**
   - Execute the steps you have planned.
   - Perform calculations carefully, showing all steps to avoid mistakes.
   - Keep track of units and ensure consistency if applicable.

4. **Review/Check Your Work:**
   - Verify each step to ensure no errors were made.
   - Check if your solution makes sense in the context of the problem.
   - If possible, use a different method to confirm your answer.

5. **State the Final Answer:**
   - Clearly write down the final answer, ensuring it answers the question posed.
   - Include units if applicable.

### Example Problem

Let's apply this approach to a simple example problem:

**Problem:** Solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).

**Step 1: Understand the Problem**
- We need to find the value of \( x \) that satisfies the equation.

**Step 2: Devise a Plan**
- We can solve this linear equation by isolating \( x \).

**Step 3: Carry Out the Plan**
- Start by subtracting 3 from both sides of the equation:
  \[
  2x + 3 - 3 = 11 - 3
  \]
  \[
  2x = 8
  \]
- Next, divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( x \):
  \[
  \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{8}{2}
  \]
  \[
  x = 4
  \]

**Step 4: Review/Check Your Work**
- Substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation to verify:
  \[
  2(4) + 3 = 8 + 3 = 11
  \]
- The left side equals the right side, confirming our solution is correct.

**Step 5: State the Final Answer**
- The solution to the equation is \( x = 4 \).
