==================================================

To determine how much of Aiden's secret steakhouse seasoning he will need to make 80 meatballs, we can follow these steps:

1. **Determine the number of pounds of ground beef needed**:
   Aiden gets 16 meatballs from each pound of ground beef. We need to find out how many pounds of ground beef are required to make 80 meatballs.

   \[
   \text{Number of pounds of ground beef} = \frac{\text{Total meatballs needed}}{\text{Meatballs per pound}} = \frac{80 \text{ meatballs}}{16 \text{ meatballs/pound}} = 5 \text{ pounds}
   \]

2. **Calculate the amount of seasoning needed**:
   Aiden adds 2 tablespoons of seasoning for every pound of ground beef. Since we calculated that he needs 5 pounds of ground beef, we can find the total amount of seasoning needed.

   \[
   \text{Total seasoning needed} = \text{Pounds of ground beef} \times \text{Seasoning per pound} = 5 \text{ pounds} \times 2 \text{ tablespoons/pound} = 10 \text{ tablespoons}
   \]

3. **Final answer**:
   Aiden will need a total of 10 tablespoons of his secret steakhouse seasoning to make 80 meatballs.

Thus, the final answer is:

**Aiden will need 10 tablespoons of his secret steakhouse seasoning.**
