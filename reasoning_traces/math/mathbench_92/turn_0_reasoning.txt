==================================================

It seems like there might be some confusion with the problem statement "Sample math problem 92." This doesn't provide specific details about the math problem you want to solve. However, I can create a sample math problem for you and solve it step by step. Let's proceed with a typical algebra problem:

**Sample Math Problem:**

Solve for \( x \) in the equation:
\[ 3x + 5 = 20 \]

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Equation:**
   The equation \( 3x + 5 = 20 \) is a linear equation in one variable, \( x \). Our goal is to isolate \( x \) on one side of the equation.

2. **Subtract 5 from Both Sides:**
   To begin isolating \( x \), we need to eliminate the constant term on the left side. We do this by subtracting 5 from both sides of the equation:
   \[
   3x + 5 - 5 = 20 - 5
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   3x = 15
   \]

3. **Divide Both Sides by 3:**
   Next, we need to solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides of the equation by the coefficient of \( x \), which is 3:
   \[
   \frac{3x}{3} = \frac{15}{3}
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   x = 5
   \]

4. **Verify the Solution:**
   To ensure our solution is correct, we substitute \( x = 5 \) back into the original equation:
   \[
   3(5) + 5 = 20
   \]
   Simplifying the left side:
   \[
   15 + 5 = 20
   \]
   \[
   20 = 20
   \]
   Since both sides of the equation are equal, our solution is verified.

**Final Answer:**
The solution to the equation \( 3x + 5 = 20 \) is \( x = 5 \).
