Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we first need to understand what "Sample math problem 295" refers to. Unfortunately, without additional context or details about what this specific problem entails, I can't provide a direct solution. However, I can guide you through a general approach to solving math problems, which you can apply to problem 295 once you have more information.

### General Approach to Solving Math Problems:

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - Read the problem carefully.
   - Identify what is being asked.
   - Determine what information is given and what needs to be found.

2. **Devise a Plan:**
   - Consider strategies that might help solve the problem, such as drawing a diagram, creating an equation, or breaking the problem into smaller parts.
   - Think about similar problems you have solved before and how they might inform your approach.

3. **Carry Out the Plan:**
   - Execute your chosen strategy step by step.
   - Perform calculations carefully, showing all work.
   - Keep track of units and ensure consistency throughout the problem.

4. **Review/Check Your Work:**
   - Verify each step to ensure there are no errors.
   - Check if the final answer makes sense in the context of the problem.
   - If possible, use a different method to confirm the result.

5. **State the Final Answer:**
   - Clearly write down the final answer, ensuring it addresses the question asked.

### Example Problem:

Let's apply this approach to a hypothetical math problem:

**Problem:** Solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).

**Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We need to find the value of \( x \) that satisfies the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).

2. **Devise a Plan:**
   - We can isolate \( x \) by performing algebraic operations.

3. **Carry Out the Plan:**
   - Start by subtracting 3 from both sides of the equation:
     \[
     2x + 3 - 3 = 11 - 3
     \]
     \[
     2x = 8
     \]
   - Next, divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( x \):
     \[
     \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{8}{2}
     \]
     \[
     x = 4
     \]

4. **Review/Check Your Work:**
   - Substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation to verify:
     \[
     2(4) + 3 = 8 + 3 = 11
     \]
   - The left side equals the right side, confirming our solution is correct.

5. **State the Final Answer:**
   - The solution to the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \) is \( x = 4 \).

Once you have the details of "Sample math problem 295," you can apply this structured approach to find the solution. If you provide the specific problem, I can offer a more tailored solution.
