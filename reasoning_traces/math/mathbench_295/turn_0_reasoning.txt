==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample math problem 295" refers to. Since the problem itself is not provided, I'll assume it is a placeholder for a specific math problem. Without the actual problem, I can't provide a solution. However, I can guide you through a general approach to solving math problems.

Here's a step-by-step method for solving a typical math problem:

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - Read the problem carefully.
   - Identify what is being asked.
   - Determine what information is given.

2. **Devise a Plan:**
   - Consider possible strategies to solve the problem. This could include drawing a diagram, creating an equation, or breaking the problem into smaller parts.
   - Choose the most appropriate method based on the problem type (e.g., algebraic, geometric, statistical).

3. **Carry Out the Plan:**
   - Execute the chosen strategy step by step.
   - Perform calculations carefully, showing all work.
   - Keep track of units and ensure consistency.

4. **Review/Check the Solution:**
   - Verify that the solution answers the question posed.
   - Check calculations for accuracy.
   - Consider whether the answer is reasonable in the context of the problem.

5. **State the Final Answer:**
   - Clearly write the final answer, including units if applicable.

Since I don't have the specifics of "Sample math problem 295," I can't provide a detailed solution. If you can provide the actual problem, I'd be happy to help solve it using the steps outlined above.
