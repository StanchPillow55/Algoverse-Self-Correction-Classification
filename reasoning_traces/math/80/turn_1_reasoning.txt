Question ID: 80
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine how many additional cans Jennifer bought based on the number of cans Mark bought.

We know that for every 5 cans Mark bought, Jennifer bought 6 additional cans. Therefore, if Mark bought 50 cans, we can calculate the number of additional cans Jennifer bought by dividing Mark's total by 5 and then multiplying by 6.

50 cans / 5 = 10
10 * 6 = 60 additional cans

So, Jennifer bought 60 additional cans of milk.

However, we know that Jennifer initially bought 40 cans of milk before meeting Mark. Therefore, to find the total number of cans Jennifer bought, we need to add the initial 40 cans to the 60 additional cans.

40 cans + 60 cans = 100 cans

Therefore, Jennifer brought home 100 cans of milk from the store.
