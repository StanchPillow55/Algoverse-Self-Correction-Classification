Question ID: 80
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to find out how many additional cans Jennifer bought based on the number of cans Mark bought, and then add that to the initial number of cans she bought.

First, we know that Jennifer bought 6 additional cans for every 5 cans that Mark bought. Mark bought 50 cans. To find out how many additional cans Jennifer bought, we divide the number of cans Mark bought by 5 and then multiply by 6.

50 cans / 5 = 10
10 * 6 = 60 cans

So, Jennifer bought an additional 60 cans of milk based on the number of cans Mark bought.

Next, we add the initial number of cans Jennifer bought to the additional cans she bought. Jennifer initially bought 40 cans.

40 cans + 60 cans = 100 cans

Therefore, Jennifer brought home a total of 100 cans of milk from the store.
