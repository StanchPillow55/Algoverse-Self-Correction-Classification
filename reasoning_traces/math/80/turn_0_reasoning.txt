==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to determine how many cans of milk Jennifer brought home after her purchases.

1. **Initial Purchase by Jennifer**: 
   Jennifer initially purchased 40 cans of milk.

2. **Mark's Purchase**: 
   Mark purchased 50 cans of milk.

3. **Jennifer's Additional Purchase**: 
   According to the problem, Jennifer bought 6 additional cans for every 5 cans that Mark bought. 

   To find out how many additional cans Jennifer bought, we first need to determine how many groups of 5 cans are in the 50 cans that Mark bought:
   \[
   \text{Number of groups of 5 cans} = \frac{50}{5} = 10
   \]

   Since Jennifer buys 6 additional cans for each of these groups, we calculate the total additional cans she bought:
   \[
   \text{Additional cans} = 10 \times 6 = 60
   \]

4. **Total Cans Jennifer Brought Home**: 
   Now, we add the initial cans Jennifer bought to the additional cans she purchased:
   \[
   \text{Total cans} = \text{Initial cans} + \text{Additional cans} = 40 + 60 = 100
   \]

Thus, Jennifer brought home a total of 100 cans of milk from the store.

**Final Answer**: 100 cans
