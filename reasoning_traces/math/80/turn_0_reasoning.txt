Question ID: 80
Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

Jennifer initially bought 40 cans of milk.

For every 5 cans that Mark bought, Jennifer bought an additional 6 cans. Since Mark bought 50 cans, we can calculate the number of additional cans Jennifer bought by dividing Mark's total by 5 and then multiplying by 6.

50 cans / 5 = 10 sets of 5 cans
10 sets * 6 cans/set = 60 additional cans

So, Jennifer bought 60 additional cans of milk.

To find the total number of cans Jennifer bought, we add the initial 40 cans to the 60 additional cans:

40 cans + 60 cans = 100 cans

So, Jennifer brought home 100 cans of milk from the store.
