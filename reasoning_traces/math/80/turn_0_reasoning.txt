Question ID: 80
Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step.

1. **Calculate how much water each girl received**:
   Each girl received \( \frac{1}{6} \) of the total 24 liters of water. 

   \[
   \text{Water each girl received} = \frac{1}{6} \times 24 = \frac{24}{6} = 4 \text{ liters}
   \]

   Since there are two girls, we can calculate the total amount of water they received:

   \[
   \text{Total water received by both girls} = 4 \text{ liters} \times 2 = 8 \text{ liters}
   \]

2. **Calculate how much water the boy received**:
   The boy received 6 liters of water.

3. **Calculate the total amount of water distributed**:
   Now, we can find the total amount of water distributed to the girls and the boy:

   \[
   \text{Total water distributed} = \text{Total water received by girls} + \text{Water received by boy}
   \]

   \[
   \text{Total water distributed} = 8 \text{ liters} + 6 \text{ liters} = 14 \text{ liters}
   \]

4. **Calculate the remaining water**:
   To find out how much water is left, we subtract the total amount of water distributed from the original amount of water:

   \[
   \text{Water left} = \text{Total water} - \text{Total water distributed}
   \]

   \[
   \text{Water left} = 24 \text{ liters} - 14 \text{ liters} = 10 \text{ liters}
   \]

Thus, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{10} \text{ liters}
\]
