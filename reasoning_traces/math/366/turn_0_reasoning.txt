==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total length of the ladders climbed by both Keaton and Reece in inches. We will first calculate the total length for each worker and then sum these lengths.

### Step 1: Calculate Keaton's Total Ladder Climb

1. **Ladder Height for Keaton**: Keaton climbed a ladder that is 30 feet tall.
2. **Number of Climbs**: Keaton climbed this ladder 20 times.
3. **Total Climb in Feet**: 
   \[
   \text{Total climb for Keaton in feet} = 30 \text{ feet/ladder} \times 20 \text{ climbs} = 600 \text{ feet}
   \]

### Step 2: Convert Keaton's Total Climb to Inches

1. **Conversion Factor**: There are 12 inches in a foot.
2. **Total Climb in Inches**:
   \[
   \text{Total climb for Keaton in inches} = 600 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 7200 \text{ inches}
   \]

### Step 3: Calculate Reece's Total Ladder Climb

1. **Ladder Height for Reece**: Reece climbed a ladder that is 4 feet shorter than Keaton's ladder. Therefore, Reece's ladder is:
   \[
   30 \text{ feet} - 4 \text{ feet} = 26 \text{ feet}
   \]
2. **Number of Climbs**: Reece climbed this ladder 15 times.
3. **Total Climb in Feet**:
   \[
   \text{Total climb for Reece in feet} = 26 \text{ feet/ladder} \times 15 \text{ climbs} = 390 \text{ feet}
   \]

### Step 4: Convert Reece's Total Climb to Inches

1. **Total Climb in Inches**:
   \[
   \text{Total climb for Reece in inches} = 390 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 4680 \text{ inches}
   \]

### Step 5: Calculate the Combined Total Length in Inches

1. **Combined Total Length**:
   \[
   \text{Total length climbed by both} = 7200 \text{ inches (Keaton)} + 4680 \text{ inches (Reece)} = 11880 \text{ inches}
   \]

### Final Answer

The total length of the ladders that both Keaton and Reece climbed is \( \boxed{11880} \) inches.
