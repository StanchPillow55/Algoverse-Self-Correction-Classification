To find the total length of the ladders that Keaton and Reece climbed in inches, we will follow these steps:

1. **Determine the length of Keaton's ladder in inches.**
   - Keaton's ladder is 30 feet long.
   - To convert feet to inches, we use the conversion factor that 1 foot = 12 inches.
   - Therefore, the length of Keaton's ladder in inches is:
     \[
     30 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 360 \text{ inches}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total length of the ladders Keaton climbed.**
   - Keaton climbed his ladder 20 times.
   - The total length climbed by Keaton is:
     \[
     20 \text{ climbs} \times 360 \text{ inches/climb} = 7200 \text{ inches}
     \]

3. **Determine the length of Reece's ladder in feet.**
   - Reece's ladder is 4 feet shorter than Keaton's ladder.
   - Therefore, the length of Reece's ladder is:
     \[
     30 \text{ feet} - 4 \text{ feet} = 26 \text{ feet}
     \]

4. **Convert the length of Reece's ladder to inches.**
   - Using the same conversion factor:
     \[
     26 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 312 \text{ inches}
     \]

5. **Calculate the total length of the ladders Reece climbed.**
   - Reece climbed his ladder 15 times.
   - The total length climbed by Reece is:
     \[
     15 \text{ climbs} \times 312 \text{ inches/climb} = 4680 \text{ inches}
     \]

6. **Calculate the total length of the ladders climbed by both workers.**
   - We add the total lengths climbed by Keaton and Reece:
     \[
     7200 \text{ inches} + 4680 \text{ inches} = 11880 \text{ inches}
     \]

Thus, the total length of the ladders that both workers climbed is:

\[
\boxed{11880} \text{ inches}
\]
