Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To determine the minimum number of points Jane must score on her third test to be promoted to the next school year, we can follow these steps:

1. **Understand the total points required**: Jane needs a total of at least 42 points from all three tests combined.

2. **Identify the scores from the first two tests**: 
   - First test score: 15 points
   - Second test score: 18 points

3. **Calculate the total points scored from the first two tests**:
   \[
   \text{Total from first two tests} = 15 + 18 = 33 \text{ points}
   \]

4. **Set up the equation for the third test score**: Let \( x \) be the score Jane needs on the third test. The equation representing the total points is:
   \[
   15 + 18 + x \geq 42
   \]

5. **Simplify the equation**:
   \[
   33 + x \geq 42
   \]

6. **Isolate \( x \)**:
   \[
   x \geq 42 - 33
   \]
   \[
   x \geq 9
   \]

7. **Conclusion**: Jane must score at least 9 points on her third test to meet the requirement of at least 42 points in total.

Thus, the minimum number of points Jane must score on the third test is \( \boxed{9} \).
