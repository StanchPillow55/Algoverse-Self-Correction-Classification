Question ID: 4
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To determine how many pages James writes in a year, we will break the problem down step by step.

1. **Identify the number of pages written per letter**: 
   James writes a 3-page letter.

2. **Identify the number of friends**: 
   He writes to 2 different friends.

3. **Calculate the total pages written per week**: 
   Since he writes to 2 friends and each letter is 3 pages long, the total pages he writes in one session (to both friends) is:
   \[
   \text{Total pages per session} = \text{Pages per letter} \times \text{Number of friends} = 3 \text{ pages} \times 2 = 6 \text{ pages}
   \]
   Since he writes to both friends twice a week, we multiply the total pages per session by the number of sessions per week:
   \[
   \text{Total pages per week} = \text{Total pages per session} \times \text{Number of sessions per week} = 6 \text{ pages} \times 2 = 12 \text{ pages}
   \]

4. **Calculate the total pages written in a year**: 
   There are 52 weeks in a year. Therefore, the total number of pages James writes in a year is:
   \[
   \text{Total pages per year} = \text{Total pages per week} \times \text{Number of weeks in a year} = 12 \text{ pages} \times 52 = 624 \text{ pages}
   \]

5. **Final answer**: 
   Thus, the total number of pages James writes in a year is:
   \[
   \boxed{624}
   \]
