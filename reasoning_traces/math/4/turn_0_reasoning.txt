Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to determine how many pages James writes in a week. He writes a 3-page letter to 2 different friends, so that's 3 pages * 2 friends = <<3*2=6>>6 pages.

Since he does this twice a week, he writes 6 pages * 2 = <<6*2=12>>12 pages in a week.

There are 52 weeks in a year, so in a year, he writes 12 pages/week * 52 weeks/year = <<12*52=624>>624 pages.

So, James writes 624 pages in a year.
