To find out how many pages James writes in a year, we can break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the number of letters James writes per week**:
   - James writes 2 letters each week.

2. **Calculate the total number of pages he writes in one week**:
   - Each letter is 3 pages long.
   - Therefore, the total number of pages written in one week is:
     \[
     \text{Pages per week} = \text{Number of letters} \times \text{Pages per letter} = 2 \times 3 = 6 \text{ pages}
     \]

3. **Determine the number of weeks in a year**:
   - There are 52 weeks in a year.

4. **Calculate the total number of pages written in a year**:
   - To find the total pages written in a year, we multiply the number of pages written per week by the number of weeks in a year:
     \[
     \text{Total pages in a year} = \text{Pages per week} \times \text{Number of weeks in a year} = 6 \times 52
     \]

5. **Perform the multiplication**:
   \[
   6 \times 52 = 312
   \]

Thus, the total number of pages James writes in a year is **312 pages**.

Final answer: **312 pages**.
