==================================================

To determine how many cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total amount of feed needed for the entire day**:
   Each chicken receives 3 cups of feed per day. Since Wendi has 20 chickens, we can calculate the total daily feed requirement as follows:

   \[
   \text{Total feed per day} = \text{Number of chickens} \times \text{Feed per chicken}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total feed per day} = 20 \text{ chickens} \times 3 \text{ cups/chicken} = 60 \text{ cups}
   \]

2. **Add up the feed given in the morning and afternoon**:
   Wendi gives her chickens 15 cups of feed in the morning and 25 cups in the afternoon. We can calculate the total feed given in these two meals:

   \[
   \text{Total feed given in morning and afternoon} = 15 \text{ cups} + 25 \text{ cups} = 40 \text{ cups}
   \]

3. **Calculate the feed needed for the final meal**:
   To find out how much feed Wendi needs to give in the final meal, we subtract the total feed given in the morning and afternoon from the total feed needed for the day:

   \[
   \text{Feed needed for final meal} = \text{Total feed per day} - \text{Total feed given in morning and afternoon}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Feed needed for final meal} = 60 \text{ cups} - 40 \text{ cups} = 20 \text{ cups}
   \]

Thus, Wendi needs to give her chickens **20 cups of feed** in the final meal of the day.

Final answer: **20 cups**
