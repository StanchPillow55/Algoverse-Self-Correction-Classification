==================================================

To determine how many bottles of sunscreen Pamela needs to pack for her vacation, we will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total amount of sunscreen needed per day.**
   - Pamela reapplies an ounce of sunscreen every hour.
   - She will be outside for 4 hours each day.
   - Therefore, the total amount of sunscreen she uses in one day is:
     \[
     \text{Sunscreen per day} = \text{ounces per hour} \times \text{hours per day} = 1 \text{ ounce/hour} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 4 \text{ ounces}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total amount of sunscreen needed for the entire vacation.**
   - Pamela is on vacation for 8 days.
   - Thus, the total amount of sunscreen she will need for the entire vacation is:
     \[
     \text{Total sunscreen} = \text{Sunscreen per day} \times \text{number of days} = 4 \text{ ounces/day} \times 8 \text{ days} = 32 \text{ ounces}
     \]

3. **Determine how many bottles of sunscreen are needed.**
   - Each bottle of sunscreen contains 8 ounces.
   - To find out how many bottles Pamela needs, we divide the total amount of sunscreen by the amount in each bottle:
     \[
     \text{Number of bottles} = \frac{\text{Total sunscreen}}{\text{ounces per bottle}} = \frac{32 \text{ ounces}}{8 \text{ ounces/bottle}} = 4 \text{ bottles}
     \]

4. **Final answer:**
   - Pamela needs to pack **4 bottles of sunscreen** for her vacation.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{4}
\]
