==================================================

To determine how much money was withheld from Sally's wage, we can follow these steps:

1. **Identify the initial amount in the bank account**: 
   Sally started the week with $200 in her bank account.

2. **Identify the final amount in the bank account**: 
   At the end of the week, her bank account holds $420.

3. **Calculate the total amount of money that has entered her bank account this week**: 
   We can find this by subtracting the initial amount from the final amount:
   \[
   \text{Total money added} = \text{Final amount} - \text{Initial amount}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total money added} = 420 - 200 = 220
   \]

4. **Identify Sally's expected weekly wage**: 
   Sally's weekly wage should be $300.

5. **Determine how much was withheld from her wage**: 
   To find out how much was withheld, we subtract the total money that was added to her account from her expected wage:
   \[
   \text{Withheld amount} = \text{Expected wage} - \text{Total money added}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Withheld amount} = 300 - 220 = 80
   \]

Thus, the amount of money that was withheld from Sally's wage is **$80**.

Final answer: **$80**.
