==================================================

To solve the problem, we first need to understand what "Sample reasoning question 192" entails. Since the problem statement is not specific, I'll assume it's a generic math problem and demonstrate a step-by-step approach to solving a typical math problem. Let's assume the problem is as follows:

**Problem:**
A rectangle has a length that is 3 times its width. If the perimeter of the rectangle is 192 units, what are the dimensions of the rectangle?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We have a rectangle with a length (L) and a width (W).
   - The length is 3 times the width: \( L = 3W \).
   - The perimeter of the rectangle is 192 units.

2. **Recall the Formula for Perimeter:**
   - The perimeter (P) of a rectangle is given by the formula:
     \[
     P = 2L + 2W
     \]

3. **Substitute the Known Values:**
   - We know the perimeter is 192 units, so:
     \[
     2L + 2W = 192
     \]

4. **Substitute the Expression for Length:**
   - Since \( L = 3W \), substitute this into the perimeter equation:
     \[
     2(3W) + 2W = 192
     \]

5. **Simplify the Equation:**
   - Simplify the terms:
     \[
     6W + 2W = 192
     \]
   - Combine like terms:
     \[
     8W = 192
     \]

6. **Solve for Width (W):**
   - Divide both sides by 8 to solve for W:
     \[
     W = \frac{192}{8} = 24
     \]

7. **Find the Length (L):**
   - Use the relationship \( L = 3W \):
     \[
     L = 3 \times 24 = 72
     \]

8. **Verify the Solution:**
   - Check if the dimensions satisfy the perimeter condition:
     \[
     2L + 2W = 2(72) + 2(24) = 144 + 48 = 192
     \]
   - The calculation is correct, confirming our solution.

**Final Answer:**
The dimensions of the rectangle are:
- Width (W) = 24 units
- Length (L) = 72 units
