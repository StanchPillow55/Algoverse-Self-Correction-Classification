==================================================

To solve the problem effectively, let's first clarify what "Sample reasoning question 192" might entail. Since the problem statement is not explicitly given, I'll assume it's a hypothetical math problem that requires logical reasoning and problem-solving skills. I'll create a sample problem and solve it step by step.

**Sample Problem:**

A farmer has a rectangular field that is 100 meters long and 60 meters wide. He wants to divide the field into two equal parts by building a fence parallel to one of the sides. Calculate the length of the fence needed and explain your reasoning.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - The field is rectangular with dimensions 100 meters (length) and 60 meters (width).
   - The farmer wants to divide the field into two equal parts using a fence parallel to one of the sides.

2. **Determine the Possible Orientations for the Fence:**
   - The fence can be parallel to the length (100 meters) or the width (60 meters).

3. **Calculate the Area of the Field:**
   - The area of the rectangular field is given by the formula:
     \[
     \text{Area} = \text{Length} \times \text{Width} = 100 \, \text{m} \times 60 \, \text{m} = 6000 \, \text{m}^2
     \]

4. **Divide the Field into Two Equal Parts:**
   - Since the field needs to be divided into two equal parts, each part will have an area of:
     \[
     \frac{6000 \, \text{m}^2}{2} = 3000 \, \text{m}^2
     \]

5. **Determine the Fence Orientation:**
   - **Option 1:** Fence parallel to the length (100 meters):
     - Each part will have dimensions 100 meters by \( x \) meters.
     - The area of each part is:
       \[
       100 \times x = 3000 \, \text{m}^2 \implies x = \frac{3000}{100} = 30 \, \text{m}
       \]
     - The fence will be parallel to the width, so its length will be 60 meters.

   - **Option 2:** Fence parallel to the width (60 meters):
     - Each part will have dimensions \( y \) meters by 60 meters.
     - The area of each part is:
       \[
       y \times 60 = 3000 \, \text{m}^2 \implies y = \frac{3000}{60} = 50 \, \text{m}
       \]
     - The fence will be parallel to the length, so its length will be 100 meters.

6. **Conclusion:**
   - The farmer can choose either orientation for the fence. The length of the fence needed will depend on the orientation:
     - If the fence is parallel to the width, the length of the fence is 60 meters.
     - If the fence is parallel to the length, the length of the fence is 100 meters.

**Final Answer:**
The length of the fence needed is either 60 meters or 100 meters, depending on the orientation chosen by the farmer.
