Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 192" entails. Since the problem statement is not explicitly given, I'll demonstrate a general approach to solving a reasoning-based math problem by creating a hypothetical scenario.

Let's assume "Sample reasoning question 192" is a typical math reasoning problem involving arithmetic sequences. Here's how we might approach solving it:

**Problem Statement (Hypothetical):**
Consider an arithmetic sequence where the first term is 5 and the common difference is 3. What is the 50th term of this sequence?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Formula for an Arithmetic Sequence:**
   The formula for the \(n\)-th term of an arithmetic sequence is given by:
   \[
   a_n = a_1 + (n-1) \cdot d
   \]
   where \(a_n\) is the \(n\)-th term, \(a_1\) is the first term, \(d\) is the common difference, and \(n\) is the term number.

2. **Identify Given Values:**
   - First term (\(a_1\)) = 5
   - Common difference (\(d\)) = 3
   - Term number (\(n\)) = 50

3. **Substitute the Values into the Formula:**
   \[
   a_{50} = 5 + (50-1) \cdot 3
   \]

4. **Calculate the Expression:**
   - Calculate \(50 - 1\):
     \[
     50 - 1 = 49
     \]
   - Multiply the result by the common difference:
     \[
     49 \cdot 3 = 147
     \]
   - Add this result to the first term:
     \[
     a_{50} = 5 + 147 = 152
     \]

5. **Conclusion:**
   The 50th term of the arithmetic sequence is 152.

**Final Answer:**
The 50th term of the sequence is 152.

This example demonstrates a structured approach to solving a reasoning-based math problem involving arithmetic sequences. If "Sample reasoning question 192" refers to a different type of problem, please provide additional context or details for a more accurate solution.
