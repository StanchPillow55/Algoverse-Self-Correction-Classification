==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample reasoning question 192," we need to first understand what the problem is asking. However, the question as stated is not clear or specific. It seems to be a placeholder or a reference to a specific problem that is not provided here. Therefore, I will demonstrate how to approach a typical math problem by creating a hypothetical problem and solving it step by step.

Let's assume the problem is as follows:

**Problem:** A rectangle has a length that is 3 times its width. If the perimeter of the rectangle is 192 units, what are the dimensions of the rectangle?

**Step 1: Understand the problem.**
We need to find the length and width of the rectangle. We know the relationship between the length and width, and we know the perimeter.

**Step 2: Set up equations.**
Let \( w \) be the width of the rectangle. Then the length \( l \) is \( 3w \).

The formula for the perimeter \( P \) of a rectangle is:
\[ P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width}) \]

Given that the perimeter is 192, we have:
\[ 192 = 2 \times (3w + w) \]

**Step 3: Simplify and solve the equation.**
First, simplify the expression inside the parentheses:
\[ 192 = 2 \times (4w) \]
\[ 192 = 8w \]

Now, solve for \( w \):
\[ w = \frac{192}{8} \]
\[ w = 24 \]

**Step 4: Find the length.**
Since the length \( l \) is 3 times the width:
\[ l = 3w = 3 \times 24 = 72 \]

**Step 5: Verify the solution.**
Check that these dimensions satisfy the original condition about the perimeter:
\[ P = 2 \times (l + w) = 2 \times (72 + 24) = 2 \times 96 = 192 \]

The calculations confirm that the perimeter is indeed 192, so the solution is correct.

**Final Answer:**
The width of the rectangle is 24 units, and the length is 72 units.
