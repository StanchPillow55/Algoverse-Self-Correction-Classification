==================================================

It seems like the problem statement is incomplete or unclear. "Sample math problem 123" doesn't provide enough information for me to solve a specific math problem. However, I can guide you through a generic approach to solving math problems, or if you have a specific math problem in mind, please provide the details, and I'll be happy to help!

Here's a general approach to solving math problems:

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - Read the problem carefully.
   - Identify what is being asked.
   - Determine what information is given and what is needed.

2. **Devise a Plan:**
   - Think about the strategies that could be used to solve the problem (e.g., algebraic manipulation, drawing a diagram, logical reasoning).
   - Consider similar problems you have solved before.

3. **Carry Out the Plan:**
   - Execute the steps you have planned.
   - Perform calculations carefully.
   - Keep track of units and signs.

4. **Review/Check Your Work:**
   - Verify each step of your solution.
   - Check if your answer makes sense in the context of the problem.
   - Recalculate if necessary to ensure accuracy.

5. **State the Final Answer:**
   - Clearly write down the final answer.
   - Include units if applicable.

If you provide a specific math problem, I can apply this approach to solve it and show all the work and reasoning involved.
