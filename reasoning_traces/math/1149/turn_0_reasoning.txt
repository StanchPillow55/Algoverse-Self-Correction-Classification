==================================================

To determine how much Jen spends on food for her fish in the month of May, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Identify the number of fish**: Jen has 3 fish.

2. **Determine the daily food cost per fish**: Each fish requires $1 worth of food per day.

3. **Calculate the total daily food cost for all fish**: 
   - Since each fish costs $1 per day, the total cost for 3 fish would be:
   \[
   \text{Total daily cost} = \text{Number of fish} \times \text{Cost per fish per day} = 3 \times 1 = 3 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Determine the number of days in May**: May has 31 days.

5. **Calculate the total food cost for the month of May**:
   - To find the total cost for the month, we multiply the total daily cost by the number of days in May:
   \[
   \text{Total cost for May} = \text{Total daily cost} \times \text{Number of days in May} = 3 \times 31 = 93 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Thus, the total amount Jen spends on food for her fish in the month of May is **$93**.

Final answer: **$93**.
