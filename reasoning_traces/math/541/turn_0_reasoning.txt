To solve the problem, we need to determine how much Elvis saves daily in the first half of April and how that relates to his savings in the second half of the month.

1. **Identify the number of days in April**: 
   April has 30 days. Therefore, the first half consists of the first 15 days, and the second half consists of the last 15 days.

2. **Define variables**:
   Let \( x \) be the amount Elvis saves each day in the first half of the month (the first 15 days).
   According to the problem, in the second half of the month, he saves twice as much daily, which means he saves \( 2x \) each day for the last 15 days.

3. **Calculate total savings**:
   - Total savings from the first half of the month (15 days):
     \[
     \text{Savings from first half} = 15 \cdot x
     \]
   - Total savings from the second half of the month (15 days):
     \[
     \text{Savings from second half} = 15 \cdot (2x) = 30x
     \]

4. **Set up the equation for total savings**:
   The total savings for the month must equal his monthly saving target of $1125:
   \[
   15x + 30x = 1125
   \]

5. **Combine like terms**:
   \[
   45x = 1125
   \]

6. **Solve for \( x \)**:
   To find \( x \), divide both sides of the equation by 45:
   \[
   x = \frac{1125}{45} = 25
   \]

   So, Elvis saves $25 each day in the first half of the month.

7. **Calculate savings for the second half**:
   Since he saves twice as much in the second half:
   \[
   2x = 2 \cdot 25 = 50
   \]

Thus, Elvis has to save **$50** each day in the second half of the month.

**Final Answer**: $50
