==================================================

To solve the problem, we will follow these steps:

1. **Determine the total number of oranges Jennifer bought.**
   - Jennifer bought 12 oranges.

2. **Calculate how many oranges she gave to her daughters.**
   - Jennifer has three daughters, and each daughter received 2 oranges.
   - The total number of oranges given to the daughters can be calculated as follows:
     \[
     \text{Total oranges given to daughters} = \text{Number of daughters} \times \text{Oranges per daughter} = 3 \times 2 = 6 \text{ oranges}
     \]

3. **Calculate how many oranges she gave to her son.**
   - Jennifer's only son received 3 oranges.
   - So, the total number of oranges given to her son is:
     \[
     \text{Total oranges given to son} = 3 \text{ oranges}
     \]

4. **Calculate the total number of oranges given away.**
   - Now, we can find the total number of oranges given away by adding the oranges given to her daughters and her son:
     \[
     \text{Total oranges given away} = \text{Total oranges given to daughters} + \text{Total oranges given to son} = 6 + 3 = 9 \text{ oranges}
     \]

5. **Calculate how many oranges Jennifer has left.**
   - To find out how many oranges Jennifer has remaining, we subtract the total number of oranges given away from the total number of oranges she initially bought:
     \[
     \text{Oranges remaining} = \text{Total oranges bought} - \text{Total oranges given away} = 12 - 9 = 3 \text{ oranges}
     \]

Thus, after giving away oranges to her daughters and son, Jennifer has 3 oranges left.

**Final Answer:**
Jennifer remains with 3 oranges.
