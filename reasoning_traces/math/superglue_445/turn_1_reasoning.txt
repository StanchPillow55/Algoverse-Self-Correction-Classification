==================================================

To solve a math problem effectively, it's important to follow a structured approach. However, the question you've provided, "Sample reasoning question 445," doesn't contain specific details or numerical data to work with. Therefore, I'll guide you through a general approach to solving a math problem, using a hypothetical example.

Let's assume the problem is as follows:

**Problem:** A store sells apples at $2 each and oranges at $3 each. If a customer buys a total of 10 fruits consisting of apples and oranges and spends $25, how many apples and how many oranges did the customer buy?

**Step 1: Define Variables**
Let \( a \) be the number of apples and \( o \) be the number of oranges.

**Step 2: Set Up Equations**
From the problem, we have two key pieces of information:
1. The total number of fruits is 10.
2. The total cost is $25.

This gives us the following equations:
\[ a + o = 10 \]  (Equation 1)
\[ 2a + 3o = 25 \]  (Equation 2)

**Step 3: Solve the System of Equations**
We can use substitution or elimination to solve these equations. Here, I'll use substitution.

From Equation 1, express \( o \) in terms of \( a \):
\[ o = 10 - a \]

Substitute \( o = 10 - a \) into Equation 2:
\[ 2a + 3(10 - a) = 25 \]

Simplify and solve for \( a \):
\[ 2a + 30 - 3a = 25 \]
\[ -a + 30 = 25 \]
\[ -a = 25 - 30 \]
\[ -a = -5 \]
\[ a = 5 \]

Now, substitute \( a = 5 \) back into the expression for \( o \):
\[ o = 10 - a \]
\[ o = 10 - 5 \]
\[ o = 5 \]

**Step 4: Verify the Solution**
Check if the solution satisfies both original equations:
- Equation 1: \( a + o = 5 + 5 = 10 \) (Correct)
- Equation 2: \( 2a + 3o = 2(5) + 3(5) = 10 + 15 = 25 \) (Correct)

Both equations are satisfied, confirming our solution is correct.

**Final Answer:**
The customer bought 5 apples and 5 oranges.
