==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 445" entails. Since the question doesn't provide specific details, I'll create a hypothetical math problem to demonstrate the process of solving it step by step.

Let's assume "Sample reasoning question 445" is a math problem involving algebra, specifically solving a linear equation. Here's the problem:

**Problem:**
Solve the equation for \( x \):  
\[ 3x + 5 = 20 \]

**Step-by-step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Equation:**
   The equation given is \( 3x + 5 = 20 \). Our goal is to solve for \( x \), which means we need to isolate \( x \) on one side of the equation.

2. **Isolate the Variable:**
   To isolate \( x \), we first need to eliminate the constant term on the left side of the equation. The constant term here is \( 5 \).

   - Subtract \( 5 \) from both sides of the equation:
     \[
     3x + 5 - 5 = 20 - 5
     \]
     Simplifying both sides gives:
     \[
     3x = 15
     \]

3. **Solve for \( x \):**
   Now that we have \( 3x = 15 \), we need to solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides by the coefficient of \( x \), which is \( 3 \).

   - Divide both sides by \( 3 \):
     \[
     \frac{3x}{3} = \frac{15}{3}
     \]
     Simplifying both sides gives:
     \[
     x = 5
     \]

4. **Verify the Solution:**
   To ensure our solution is correct, we substitute \( x = 5 \) back into the original equation and verify that both sides are equal.

   - Substitute \( x = 5 \) into the original equation:
     \[
     3(5) + 5 = 20
     \]
     Simplifying the left side gives:
     \[
     15 + 5 = 20
     \]
     \[
     20 = 20
     \]
   Since both sides of the equation are equal, our solution \( x = 5 \) is correct.

**Final Answer:**
The solution to the equation \( 3x + 5 = 20 \) is \( x = 5 \).
