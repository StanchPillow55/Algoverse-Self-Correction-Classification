==================================================

To solve the problem effectively, I need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 55" refers to. However, since I don't have access to external databases or specific documents, I will assume this is a hypothetical math problem. Without specific details, I'll create a sample math problem and solve it step by step.

**Sample Problem:**

A company produces two types of widgets: Type A and Type B. The production cost for Type A is $5 per unit, and for Type B, it is $8 per unit. The company sells Type A widgets for $10 each and Type B widgets for $15 each. If the company produces 100 units of Type A and 150 units of Type B, what is the total profit?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Calculate the Total Production Cost:**
   - For Type A widgets: 
     \[
     \text{Cost for Type A} = 100 \text{ units} \times \$5/\text{unit} = \$500
     \]
   - For Type B widgets:
     \[
     \text{Cost for Type B} = 150 \text{ units} \times \$8/\text{unit} = \$1200
     \]
   - Total production cost:
     \[
     \text{Total Production Cost} = \$500 + \$1200 = \$1700
     \]

2. **Calculate the Total Revenue:**
   - Revenue from Type A widgets:
     \[
     \text{Revenue for Type A} = 100 \text{ units} \times \$10/\text{unit} = \$1000
     \]
   - Revenue from Type B widgets:
     \[
     \text{Revenue for Type B} = 150 \text{ units} \times \$15/\text{unit} = \$2250
     \]
   - Total revenue:
     \[
     \text{Total Revenue} = \$1000 + \$2250 = \$3250
     \]

3. **Calculate the Total Profit:**
   - Profit is calculated as total revenue minus total production cost:
     \[
     \text{Total Profit} = \text{Total Revenue} - \text{Total Production Cost} = \$3250 - \$1700 = \$1550
     \]

**Final Answer:**

The total profit from producing and selling 100 units of Type A and 150 units of Type B widgets is \$1550.
