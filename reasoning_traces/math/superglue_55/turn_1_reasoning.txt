==================================================

To solve the problem effectively, we need to first understand the context and details of the question. However, the question "Sample reasoning question 55" is not specific enough to provide a detailed solution. It appears to be a placeholder or reference to a specific problem that is not included in your message.

To proceed, let's assume a hypothetical math problem that involves reasoning and calculations. I will create a problem and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**

A farmer has a rectangular field that is 100 meters long and 50 meters wide. He wants to divide the field into two equal parts by constructing a fence parallel to the shorter side. How long will the fence be?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - The field is rectangular with dimensions 100 meters (length) and 50 meters (width).
   - The farmer wants to divide the field into two equal parts with a fence parallel to the shorter side (width).

2. **Visualize the Problem:**
   - Imagine the rectangle with the longer side (100 meters) as the base.
   - The fence will be parallel to the shorter side (50 meters), meaning it will run along the length of the field.

3. **Calculate the Length of the Fence:**
   - Since the fence is parallel to the shorter side, it will span the entire length of the field.
   - Therefore, the length of the fence will be equal to the length of the field.

4. **Perform the Calculation:**
   - Length of the fence = Length of the field = 100 meters.

5. **Verify the Solution:**
   - Dividing the field into two equal parts means each part will have an area of half the total area of the field.
   - Total area of the field = Length × Width = 100 meters × 50 meters = 5000 square meters.
   - Area of each part after division = 5000 square meters / 2 = 2500 square meters.
   - Each part will be 50 meters wide and 50 meters long (since the fence divides the length into two equal parts).

6. **Conclusion:**
   - The length of the fence required to divide the field into two equal parts is 100 meters.

**Final Answer:**
The length of the fence is 100 meters.
