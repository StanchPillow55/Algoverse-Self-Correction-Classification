==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 392," we need to first understand what the problem is asking. However, the problem statement "Sample math problem 392" is not specific enough to provide any details or context. Therefore, I will create a hypothetical math problem labeled as "Sample math problem 392" and solve it step by step.

Let's assume "Sample math problem 392" is the following:

**Problem Statement:**
A rectangle has a length that is 3 times its width. If the perimeter of the rectangle is 48 units, find the dimensions of the rectangle.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( w \) be the width of the rectangle.
   - Since the length is 3 times the width, let the length be \( 3w \).

2. **Perimeter Formula:**
   - The formula for the perimeter \( P \) of a rectangle is given by:
     \[
     P = 2(\text{length} + \text{width})
     \]

3. **Substitute Known Values:**
   - We know the perimeter is 48 units, so:
     \[
     48 = 2(3w + w)
     \]

4. **Simplify the Equation:**
   - Combine like terms inside the parentheses:
     \[
     48 = 2(4w)
     \]
   - Simplify further:
     \[
     48 = 8w
     \]

5. **Solve for \( w \):**
   - Divide both sides by 8 to isolate \( w \):
     \[
     w = \frac{48}{8} = 6
     \]

6. **Find the Length:**
   - Since the length is 3 times the width:
     \[
     \text{Length} = 3w = 3 \times 6 = 18
     \]

7. **Verify the Solution:**
   - Check if the dimensions satisfy the perimeter condition:
     \[
     P = 2(\text{length} + \text{width}) = 2(18 + 6) = 2 \times 24 = 48
     \]
   - The calculated perimeter matches the given perimeter, confirming our solution is correct.

**Final Answer:**
The dimensions of the rectangle are:
- Width = 6 units
- Length = 18 units
