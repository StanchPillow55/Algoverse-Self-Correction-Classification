==================================================

It seems like the problem statement "Sample math problem 35" is not providing enough information to determine the specific math problem you are referring to. However, I can create a sample math problem involving the number 35 and solve it step-by-step. Let's consider the following problem:

**Problem:**
Find the sum of all positive divisors of the number 35.

**Solution:**

To solve this problem, we need to find all the positive divisors of 35 and then sum them up.

**Step 1: Find the divisors of 35.**

A divisor of a number is an integer that divides the number without leaving a remainder. To find the divisors of 35, we start by checking each integer from 1 up to 35 to see if it divides 35 evenly.

- 1 divides 35 (since \(35 \div 1 = 35\)).
- 2 does not divide 35 (since \(35 \div 2 = 17.5\), which is not an integer).
- 3 does not divide 35 (since \(35 \div 3 \approx 11.67\), which is not an integer).
- 4 does not divide 35 (since \(35 \div 4 = 8.75\), which is not an integer).
- 5 divides 35 (since \(35 \div 5 = 7\)).
- 6 does not divide 35 (since \(35 \div 6 \approx 5.83\), which is not an integer).
- 7 divides 35 (since \(35 \div 7 = 5\)).
- 8 through 34 do not divide 35 evenly.
- 35 divides 35 (since \(35 \div 35 = 1\)).

Thus, the positive divisors of 35 are 1, 5, 7, and 35.

**Step 2: Sum the divisors.**

Now, we sum the divisors we found:

\[ 1 + 5 + 7 + 35 = 48. \]

**Final Answer:**

The sum of all positive divisors of 35 is 48.
