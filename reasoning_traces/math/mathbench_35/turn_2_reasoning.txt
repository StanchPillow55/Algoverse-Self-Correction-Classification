Question ID: mathbench_35
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample math problem 35" refers to. Since the problem is not explicitly stated, I'll assume a generic math problem involving the number 35. Let's consider a problem involving basic arithmetic operations with the number 35.

**Problem:** What is the result when you add 15 to 35, then multiply the sum by 2, and finally subtract 10 from the result?

Let's solve this step by step:

1. **Add 15 to 35:**
   \[
   35 + 15 = 50
   \]

2. **Multiply the sum by 2:**
   \[
   50 \times 2 = 100
   \]

3. **Subtract 10 from the result:**
   \[
   100 - 10 = 90
   \]

Thus, the final result after performing all the operations is 90.

**Final Answer:** 90
