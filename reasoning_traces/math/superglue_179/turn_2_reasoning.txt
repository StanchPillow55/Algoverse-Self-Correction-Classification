==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 179" refers to. Since the problem statement is not explicitly provided, I'll assume that "Sample reasoning question 179" is a placeholder for a specific math problem. Without the actual content of the problem, I will demonstrate how to approach a typical math problem by creating an example problem and solving it step-by-step.

### Example Problem:
Let's assume "Sample reasoning question 179" is the following problem:

**Problem:**
A farmer has a rectangular field that is 120 meters long and 80 meters wide. He wants to divide the field into two equal parts by building a fence parallel to one of the sides. Calculate the length of the fence needed and the area of each part.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We have a rectangular field with dimensions 120 meters (length) and 80 meters (width).
   - We need to divide this field into two equal parts using a fence parallel to one of the sides.

2. **Determine How to Divide the Field:**
   - The field can be divided either by a fence parallel to the length (120 meters) or the width (80 meters).
   - Since the problem does not specify, we will consider both scenarios.

3. **Scenario 1: Fence Parallel to the Length (120 meters):**
   - The fence will be parallel to the 120-meter side, dividing the field into two smaller rectangles.
   - Each smaller rectangle will have a width of 80 meters and a length of 60 meters (since 120 meters divided by 2 equals 60 meters).

4. **Calculate the Length of the Fence:**
   - In this scenario, the fence will run along the width of the field, which is 80 meters.

5. **Calculate the Area of Each Part:**
   - Area of each smaller rectangle = Length × Width = 60 meters × 80 meters = 4800 square meters.

6. **Scenario 2: Fence Parallel to the Width (80 meters):**
   - The fence will be parallel to the 80-meter side, dividing the field into two smaller rectangles.
   - Each smaller rectangle will have a length of 120 meters and a width of 40 meters (since 80 meters divided by 2 equals 40 meters).

7. **Calculate the Length of the Fence:**
   - In this scenario, the fence will run along the length of the field, which is 120 meters.

8. **Calculate the Area of Each Part:**
   - Area of each smaller rectangle = Length × Width = 120 meters × 40 meters = 4800 square meters.

### Conclusion:
- In both scenarios, the field is divided into two equal parts, each with an area of 4800 square meters.
- The length of the fence needed depends on the orientation:
  - If the fence is parallel to the length, the fence is 80 meters long.
  - If the fence is parallel to the width, the fence is 120 meters long.

### Final Answer:
- Length of the fence: 80 meters (if parallel to the length) or 120 meters (if parallel to the width).
- Area of each part: 4800 square meters.

This example demonstrates how to approach a problem by breaking it down into manageable steps, considering different scenarios, and calculating the necessary values. If you have a specific problem in mind, please provide the details, and I can work through that problem specifically.
