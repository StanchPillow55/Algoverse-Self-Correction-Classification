==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 179" entails. Since the problem statement is not explicitly provided, I'll demonstrate a general approach to solving a typical math reasoning problem. Let's assume a hypothetical math problem and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**

A farmer has a rectangular field that is 100 meters long and 60 meters wide. He wants to divide the field into smaller rectangular sections, each with an area of 150 square meters, to plant different crops. How many such sections can he create?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - The field is a rectangle with dimensions 100 meters by 60 meters.
   - Each smaller section should have an area of 150 square meters.
   - We need to determine how many such sections can be created.

2. **Calculate the Total Area of the Field:**
   - The area of a rectangle is given by the formula: 
     \[
     \text{Area} = \text{Length} \times \text{Width}
     \]
   - For the farmer's field:
     \[
     \text{Area of the field} = 100 \, \text{meters} \times 60 \, \text{meters} = 6000 \, \text{square meters}
     \]

3. **Determine the Number of Sections:**
   - Each section has an area of 150 square meters.
   - To find the number of sections, divide the total area of the field by the area of one section:
     \[
     \text{Number of sections} = \frac{\text{Total area of the field}}{\text{Area of one section}} = \frac{6000 \, \text{square meters}}{150 \, \text{square meters}}
     \]

4. **Perform the Division:**
   - Simplify the division:
     \[
     \frac{6000}{150} = 40
     \]

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The farmer can create 40 sections, each with an area of 150 square meters.

**Final Answer:**
The farmer can divide the field into 40 smaller rectangular sections, each with an area of 150 square meters.
