==================================================

To solve this problem, let's first understand what is being asked. The problem is titled "Sample reasoning question 179," but it doesn't provide any specific details or numbers to work with. Since there is no explicit mathematical problem or data given, I'll assume this is a hypothetical situation where we need to demonstrate problem-solving skills and reasoning.

Let's create a sample math problem and solve it step by step:

**Sample Problem:**

A farmer has a rectangular field that is 100 meters long and 60 meters wide. He wants to divide the field into two equal parts by building a fence parallel to the shorter side. How long will the fence be?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - The field is rectangular with dimensions 100 meters (length) and 60 meters (width).
   - The farmer wants to divide the field into two equal parts with a fence parallel to the shorter side (width).

2. **Visualize the Problem:**
   - Imagine the rectangle with the longer side (100 meters) as the base.
   - The shorter side (60 meters) is the width.
   - To divide the field into two equal parts, the fence should be parallel to the width (60 meters).

3. **Determine the Length of the Fence:**
   - Since the fence is parallel to the width, it will run along the length of the field.
   - Therefore, the length of the fence will be equal to the length of the field.

4. **Calculate the Length of the Fence:**
   - The length of the field is 100 meters.
   - Therefore, the length of the fence will also be 100 meters.

5. **Verify the Solution:**
   - Dividing the field into two equal parts means each part will have an area of half the total area of the field.
   - Total area of the field = Length × Width = 100 meters × 60 meters = 6000 square meters.
   - Area of each part = 6000 square meters / 2 = 3000 square meters.
   - Each part will have dimensions of 100 meters (length) × 30 meters (width), confirming the fence divides the field equally.

**Final Answer:**
The length of the fence needed to divide the field into two equal parts is 100 meters.
