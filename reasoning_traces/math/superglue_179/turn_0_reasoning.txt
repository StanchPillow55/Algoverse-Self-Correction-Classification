To solve the problem, I'll need more specific information about "Sample reasoning question 179." Since I don't have access to external databases or specific problem sets, I'll demonstrate how to approach a generic math reasoning problem step by step. If you have a specific problem in mind, please provide the details, and I'll be happy to help.

Let's consider a sample math reasoning problem:

**Problem:**
A farmer has a rectangular field that is 100 meters long and 60 meters wide. He wants to divide the field into smaller, equal-sized square plots. What is the largest possible side length of each square plot?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We have a rectangular field with dimensions 100 meters by 60 meters.
   - We need to divide this field into square plots of equal size.
   - The goal is to find the largest possible side length for these square plots.

2. **Identify the Mathematical Concept:**
   - The problem involves finding the largest square that can fit into both the length and width of the rectangle.
   - This requires finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the two dimensions of the rectangle.

3. **Calculate the GCD:**
   - The dimensions of the rectangle are 100 meters and 60 meters.
   - We need to find the GCD of 100 and 60.

4. **Use the Euclidean Algorithm:**
   - The Euclidean algorithm is a method for finding the GCD of two numbers.
   - Start with the larger number, 100, and divide it by the smaller number, 60.
   - Calculate the remainder: \(100 \div 60 = 1\) remainder \(40\).
   - Now, take 60 and divide it by the remainder, 40.
   - Calculate the new remainder: \(60 \div 40 = 1\) remainder \(20\).
   - Continue the process: divide 40 by 20.
   - Calculate the remainder: \(40 \div 20 = 2\) remainder \(0\).
   - When the remainder is 0, the divisor at this step (20) is the GCD.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The greatest common divisor of 100 and 60 is 20.
   - Therefore, the largest possible side length for the square plots is 20 meters.

**Final Answer:**
The largest possible side length of each square plot is 20 meters.
