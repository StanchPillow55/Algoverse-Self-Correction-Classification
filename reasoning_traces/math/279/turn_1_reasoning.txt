To solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern in Robi's savings and then calculate the total savings over the first six months.

### Step 1: Identify the Pattern

Robi's savings pattern is as follows:
- January: $2
- February: $4
- March: $8

We can see that each month's savings is double the previous month's savings. This suggests that the savings follow a geometric sequence where each term is multiplied by 2 to get the next term.

### Step 2: Define the Sequence

The sequence of savings can be defined as:
- \( a_1 = 2 \) (January)
- \( a_2 = 4 \) (February)
- \( a_3 = 8 \) (March)

The general formula for the \( n \)-th term of a geometric sequence is:
\[ a_n = a_1 \times r^{(n-1)} \]
where \( a_1 \) is the first term and \( r \) is the common ratio.

For this problem:
- \( a_1 = 2 \)
- \( r = 2 \)

### Step 3: Calculate the Savings for Each Month

Using the formula, we calculate the savings for each of the first six months:

- **January (Month 1):**
  \[ a_1 = 2 \]

- **February (Month 2):**
  \[ a_2 = 2 \times 2^{(2-1)} = 2 \times 2 = 4 \]

- **March (Month 3):**
  \[ a_3 = 2 \times 2^{(3-1)} = 2 \times 4 = 8 \]

- **April (Month 4):**
  \[ a_4 = 2 \times 2^{(4-1)} = 2 \times 8 = 16 \]

- **May (Month 5):**
  \[ a_5 = 2 \times 2^{(5-1)} = 2 \times 16 = 32 \]

- **June (Month 6):**
  \[ a_6 = 2 \times 2^{(6-1)} = 2 \times 32 = 64 \]

### Step 4: Calculate the Total Savings After 6 Months

Now, we sum the savings for each of the six months:
\[ \text{Total Savings} = a_1 + a_2 + a_3 + a_4 + a_5 + a_6 \]
\[ \text{Total Savings} = 2 + 4 + 8 + 16 + 32 + 64 \]

Adding these amounts:
\[ \text{Total Savings} = 2 + 4 + 8 + 16 + 32 + 64 = 126 \]

### Final Answer

Robi's total savings after 6 months will be **$126**.
