To solve the problem, we first need to identify the pattern in Robi's savings. 

Robi's savings for each month are as follows:
- January: $2
- February: $4
- March: $8

We can observe that each month, Robi is saving double the amount he saved in the previous month. This indicates that his savings follow a geometric progression where the first term \( a = 2 \) and the common ratio \( r = 2 \).

Let's calculate his savings for the next months:

1. **January**: 
   \[
   S_1 = 2
   \]

2. **February**: 
   \[
   S_2 = 2 \times 2 = 4
   \]

3. **March**: 
   \[
   S_3 = 4 \times 2 = 8
   \]

4. **April**: 
   \[
   S_4 = 8 \times 2 = 16
   \]

5. **May**: 
   \[
   S_5 = 16 \times 2 = 32
   \]

6. **June**: 
   \[
   S_6 = 32 \times 2 = 64
   \]

Now, we can summarize Robi's savings for each of the 6 months:
- January: $2
- February: $4
- March: $8
- April: $16
- May: $32
- June: $64

Next, we will calculate the total savings after 6 months by adding all these amounts together:

\[
\text{Total Savings} = S_1 + S_2 + S_3 + S_4 + S_5 + S_6
\]
\[
\text{Total Savings} = 2 + 4 + 8 + 16 + 32 + 64
\]

Now, we perform the addition step by step:

1. \( 2 + 4 = 6 \)
2. \( 6 + 8 = 14 \)
3. \( 14 + 16 = 30 \)
4. \( 30 + 32 = 62 \)
5. \( 62 + 64 = 126 \)

Thus, the total savings after 6 months is:

\[
\text{Total Savings} = 126
\]

Finally, we state the final answer:

Robi's total savings after 6 months will be **$126**.
