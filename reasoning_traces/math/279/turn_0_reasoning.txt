To solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern in Robi's savings and then calculate the total savings over 6 months.

### Step 1: Identify the Pattern
Robi's savings pattern is as follows:
- January: $2
- February: $4
- March: $8

We can see that each month's savings is double the previous month's savings. This indicates that Robi's savings follow a geometric sequence where each term is multiplied by 2 to get the next term.

### Step 2: Define the Sequence
The sequence of savings can be defined as:
- \( a_1 = 2 \) (savings in January)
- \( a_2 = 4 \) (savings in February)
- \( a_3 = 8 \) (savings in March)

The general formula for the \( n \)-th term of a geometric sequence is:
\[ a_n = a_1 \times r^{(n-1)} \]
where \( a_1 \) is the first term and \( r \) is the common ratio. Here, \( a_1 = 2 \) and \( r = 2 \).

### Step 3: Calculate Savings for Each Month
Using the formula, we calculate the savings for each of the 6 months:
- \( a_1 = 2 \)
- \( a_2 = 2 \times 2^{(2-1)} = 2 \times 2 = 4 \)
- \( a_3 = 2 \times 2^{(3-1)} = 2 \times 4 = 8 \)
- \( a_4 = 2 \times 2^{(4-1)} = 2 \times 8 = 16 \)
- \( a_5 = 2 \times 2^{(5-1)} = 2 \times 16 = 32 \)
- \( a_6 = 2 \times 2^{(6-1)} = 2 \times 32 = 64 \)

### Step 4: Calculate Total Savings After 6 Months
To find the total savings after 6 months, we sum the savings for each month:
\[ \text{Total Savings} = a_1 + a_2 + a_3 + a_4 + a_5 + a_6 \]
\[ \text{Total Savings} = 2 + 4 + 8 + 16 + 32 + 64 \]

Now, let's add these amounts:
\[ 2 + 4 = 6 \]
\[ 6 + 8 = 14 \]
\[ 14 + 16 = 30 \]
\[ 30 + 32 = 62 \]
\[ 62 + 64 = 126 \]

Therefore, Robi's total savings after 6 months is $126.

### Final Answer
Robi's total savings after 6 months is \(\boxed{126}\) dollars.
