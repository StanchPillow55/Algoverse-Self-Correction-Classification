Question ID: 279
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern in Robi's savings and then calculate the total savings after 6 months.

### Step 1: Identify the Pattern
Robi's savings pattern is as follows:
- January: $2
- February: $4
- March: $8

We can see that each month's savings is double the previous month's savings. This indicates a geometric sequence where each term is multiplied by 2 to get the next term.

### Step 2: Determine the Savings for Each Month
Given the pattern, we can calculate the savings for each of the first 6 months:
- January: \( a_1 = 2 \)
- February: \( a_2 = 2 \times 2 = 4 \)
- March: \( a_3 = 4 \times 2 = 8 \)
- April: \( a_4 = 8 \times 2 = 16 \)
- May: \( a_5 = 16 \times 2 = 32 \)
- June: \( a_6 = 32 \times 2 = 64 \)

### Step 3: Calculate the Total Savings After 6 Months
To find the total savings, we sum the savings for each month from January to June:
\[
\text{Total Savings} = a_1 + a_2 + a_3 + a_4 + a_5 + a_6
\]
\[
= 2 + 4 + 8 + 16 + 32 + 64
\]

### Step 4: Perform the Addition
Let's add these amounts step by step:
\[
2 + 4 = 6
\]
\[
6 + 8 = 14
\]
\[
14 + 16 = 30
\]
\[
30 + 32 = 62
\]
\[
62 + 64 = 126
\]

### Final Answer
Robi's total savings after 6 months is \(\boxed{126}\) dollars.
