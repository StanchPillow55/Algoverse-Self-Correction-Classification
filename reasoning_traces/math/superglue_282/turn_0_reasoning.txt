==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 282" refers to. Since the question is not explicitly provided, I'll assume a generic math problem-solving approach and demonstrate how to tackle a typical math problem step by step. 

Let's assume "Sample reasoning question 282" is a math problem involving algebra, such as solving a linear equation. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to solve a linear equation:

### Problem:
Solve the equation: \(3x + 5 = 20\).

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Understand the Equation**: 
   The equation \(3x + 5 = 20\) is a linear equation in one variable, \(x\). Our goal is to find the value of \(x\) that makes this equation true.

2. **Isolate the Variable**:
   To solve for \(x\), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We start by eliminating the constant term on the left side.

   \[
   3x + 5 = 20
   \]

   Subtract 5 from both sides to remove the constant term from the left side:

   \[
   3x + 5 - 5 = 20 - 5
   \]

   Simplifying both sides gives:

   \[
   3x = 15
   \]

3. **Solve for \(x\)**:
   Now, we need to solve for \(x\) by dividing both sides of the equation by the coefficient of \(x\), which is 3.

   \[
   \frac{3x}{3} = \frac{15}{3}
   \]

   Simplifying both sides gives:

   \[
   x = 5
   \]

4. **Verify the Solution**:
   Substitute \(x = 5\) back into the original equation to verify that it satisfies the equation:

   \[
   3(5) + 5 = 20
   \]

   Calculate the left side:

   \[
   15 + 5 = 20
   \]

   Since both sides of the equation are equal, our solution \(x = 5\) is correct.

### Final Answer:
The solution to the equation \(3x + 5 = 20\) is \(x = 5\).

This step-by-step approach can be applied to various types of math problems, ensuring a clear and logical solution process. If "Sample reasoning question 282" refers to a different type of problem, please provide more details, and I can adjust the solution accordingly.
