Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem effectively, I'll need more information about "Sample reasoning question 282." Since the question isn't provided, I'll demonstrate how to approach a typical math problem by creating a hypothetical example. Let's assume the problem is as follows:

**Problem:**  
A train travels from City A to City B at a speed of 60 miles per hour. The distance between the two cities is 180 miles. How long does it take for the train to travel from City A to City B?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We need to find the time it takes for the train to travel a distance of 180 miles at a speed of 60 miles per hour.

2. **Identify the Formula:**
   - The formula to calculate time when distance and speed are known is:
     \[
     \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}}
     \]

3. **Substitute the Known Values:**
   - Distance = 180 miles
   - Speed = 60 miles per hour
   - Substitute these values into the formula:
     \[
     \text{Time} = \frac{180 \text{ miles}}{60 \text{ miles per hour}}
     \]

4. **Perform the Calculation:**
   - Divide 180 by 60:
     \[
     \text{Time} = 3 \text{ hours}
     \]

5. **Verify the Solution:**
   - To ensure the calculation is correct, consider the units:
     - Distance is in miles, speed is in miles per hour, so the time should be in hours.
   - Recalculate if necessary to confirm the result.

6. **State the Final Answer:**
   - The train takes 3 hours to travel from City A to City B.

By following these steps, we systematically solved the problem. If you have a specific "Sample reasoning question 282," please provide the details, and I'll be happy to work through it with you.
