Question ID: superglue_204
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 204" entails. Since the problem statement is not clear, I'll assume this is a hypothetical math problem that requires a structured approach to solve. Let's break down the process of solving a typical math problem step by step.

### Step 1: Understand the Problem
Without specific details, let's assume this is a generic math problem. Typically, a math problem will involve:

- Identifying what is being asked.
- Determining what information is given.
- Recognizing any constraints or conditions.

### Step 2: Devise a Plan
For a generic math problem, the plan might involve:

- Identifying relevant formulas or theorems.
- Considering different approaches (e.g., algebraic manipulation, graphical analysis, numerical methods).
- Breaking the problem into smaller, more manageable parts.

### Step 3: Carry Out the Plan
Let's assume a simple algebraic problem as an example:

**Example Problem:** Solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).

1. **Isolate the variable \( x \):**
   \[
   2x + 3 = 11
   \]
   Subtract 3 from both sides:
   \[
   2x = 8
   \]

2. **Solve for \( x \):**
   Divide both sides by 2:
   \[
   x = 4
   \]

### Step 4: Review/Check the Solution
1. Substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation to verify:
   \[
   2(4) + 3 = 8 + 3 = 11
   \]
   The left-hand side equals the right-hand side, confirming the solution is correct.

### Final Answer
For the example problem, the solution is \( x = 4 \).

Since "Sample reasoning question 204" was not specified, this example illustrates a typical approach to solving a math problem. If you have a specific problem in mind, please provide more details so I can tailor the solution to that particular question.
