==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 204" refers to. Since the question is not explicitly stated, I'll assume it's a placeholder for a typical math problem. Let's create a sample math problem and solve it step by step.

**Sample Problem:**

A farmer has a rectangular field that is 150 meters long and 100 meters wide. He wants to divide the field into smaller rectangular plots, each with an area of 500 square meters. How many such plots can the farmer create?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We have a rectangular field with dimensions 150 meters by 100 meters.
   - We need to divide this field into smaller plots, each with an area of 500 square meters.

2. **Calculate the Total Area of the Field:**
   - The area of a rectangle is given by the formula: 
     \[
     \text{Area} = \text{Length} \times \text{Width}
     \]
   - For the field:
     \[
     \text{Area of the field} = 150 \, \text{m} \times 100 \, \text{m} = 15000 \, \text{square meters}
     \]

3. **Determine the Number of Plots:**
   - Each plot has an area of 500 square meters.
   - To find the number of plots, divide the total area of the field by the area of one plot:
     \[
     \text{Number of plots} = \frac{\text{Area of the field}}{\text{Area of one plot}} = \frac{15000 \, \text{square meters}}{500 \, \text{square meters}}
     \]
   - Calculate the division:
     \[
     \frac{15000}{500} = 30
     \]

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The farmer can create 30 plots, each with an area of 500 square meters.

**Final Answer:**

The farmer can create 30 plots, each with an area of 500 square meters.
