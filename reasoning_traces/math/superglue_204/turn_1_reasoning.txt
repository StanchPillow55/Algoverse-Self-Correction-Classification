==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 204" entails. Since the question is not explicitly provided, I will assume it involves a typical math problem-solving scenario. Let's consider a hypothetical math problem and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**

A rectangle has a length that is twice its width. If the perimeter of the rectangle is 36 units, what are the dimensions of the rectangle?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We have a rectangle with a length (L) and a width (W).
   - The length is twice the width: \( L = 2W \).
   - The perimeter of the rectangle is given as 36 units.

2. **Recall the Formula for Perimeter:**
   - The perimeter (P) of a rectangle is given by the formula:
     \[
     P = 2L + 2W
     \]

3. **Substitute the Known Values:**
   - Substitute the expression for L in terms of W into the perimeter formula:
     \[
     36 = 2(2W) + 2W
     \]

4. **Simplify the Equation:**
   - Simplify the equation:
     \[
     36 = 4W + 2W
     \]
     \[
     36 = 6W
     \]

5. **Solve for W:**
   - Divide both sides of the equation by 6 to solve for W:
     \[
     W = \frac{36}{6} = 6
     \]

6. **Find the Length (L):**
   - Use the relationship \( L = 2W \) to find L:
     \[
     L = 2 \times 6 = 12
     \]

7. **Verify the Solution:**
   - Check that the dimensions satisfy the original perimeter condition:
     \[
     P = 2L + 2W = 2(12) + 2(6) = 24 + 12 = 36
     \]
   - The calculated perimeter matches the given perimeter, confirming our solution is correct.

**Final Answer:**

The dimensions of the rectangle are:
- Width (W) = 6 units
- Length (L) = 12 units
