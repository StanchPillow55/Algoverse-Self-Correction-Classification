==================================================

To determine how many hours James runs in a week, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total distance James runs in a week**:
   James runs 12 miles a day for 5 days a week. We can calculate the total distance he runs in a week by multiplying the daily distance by the number of days he runs.

   \[
   \text{Total distance} = \text{Daily distance} \times \text{Number of days}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total distance} = 12 \text{ miles/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 60 \text{ miles}
   \]

2. **Calculate the time it takes to run that distance**:
   James runs at a speed of 10 miles per hour. To find out how many hours he runs in a week, we can use the formula:

   \[
   \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}}
   \]
   Substituting the total distance and speed into the formula gives us:

   \[
   \text{Time} = \frac{60 \text{ miles}}{10 \text{ miles/hour}} = 6 \text{ hours}
   \]

3. **Final answer**:
   Therefore, the total time James runs in a week is:

   \[
   \boxed{6} \text{ hours}
   \]
