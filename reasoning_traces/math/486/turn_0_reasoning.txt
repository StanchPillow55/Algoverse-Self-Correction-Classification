To solve this problem, we need to determine the total amount of rain that fell each day and then calculate the daily average for the week.

**Step 1: Calculate the rain for each day.**

- **Monday:**
  - It rained 2 inches in the morning and 1 more inch later that day.
  - Total rain on Monday = 2 inches + 1 inch = 3 inches.

- **Tuesday:**
  - It rained twice as much as it did on Monday.
  - Total rain on Tuesday = 2 × 3 inches = 6 inches.

- **Wednesday:**
  - It did not rain.
  - Total rain on Wednesday = 0 inches.

- **Thursday:**
  - It rained 1 inch.
  - Total rain on Thursday = 1 inch.

- **Friday:**
  - The rain on Friday was equal to the total from Monday through Thursday.
  - First, calculate the total rain from Monday to Thursday:
    - Total rain from Monday to Thursday = 3 inches (Monday) + 6 inches (Tuesday) + 0 inches (Wednesday) + 1 inch (Thursday) = 10 inches.
  - Total rain on Friday = 10 inches.

**Step 2: Calculate the total rain for the week.**

- Total rain for the week = Rain on Monday + Rain on Tuesday + Rain on Wednesday + Rain on Thursday + Rain on Friday
- Total rain for the week = 3 inches + 6 inches + 0 inches + 1 inch + 10 inches = 20 inches.

**Step 3: Calculate the daily average rain total for the week.**

- There are 7 days in a week.
- Daily average rain total = Total rain for the week / Number of days in the week
- Daily average rain total = 20 inches / 7 days ≈ 2.857 inches per day.

**Final Answer:**
The daily average rain total for the week was approximately 2.857 inches.
