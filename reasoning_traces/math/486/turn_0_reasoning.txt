To find the daily average rain total for the week, we first need to calculate the total amount of rain that fell each day from Monday to Friday.

1. **Calculate the total rain for each day:**
   - **Monday:**
     - Rain in the morning: 2 inches
     - Rain later that day: 1 inch
     - Total for Monday = 2 inches + 1 inch = 3 inches

   - **Tuesday:**
     - It rained twice as much as Monday.
     - Total for Tuesday = 2 * 3 inches = 6 inches

   - **Wednesday:**
     - It did not rain.
     - Total for Wednesday = 0 inches

   - **Thursday:**
     - It rained 1 inch.
     - Total for Thursday = 1 inch

   - **Friday:**
     - The total rain on Friday was equal to the total rain from Monday through Thursday combined.
     - Total rain from Monday to Thursday = 3 inches (Monday) + 6 inches (Tuesday) + 0 inches (Wednesday) + 1 inch (Thursday) = 10 inches
     - Total for Friday = 10 inches

2. **Calculate the total rain for the week:**
   - Total rain for the week = Total for Monday + Total for Tuesday + Total for Wednesday + Total for Thursday + Total for Friday
   - Total rain for the week = 3 inches + 6 inches + 0 inches + 1 inch + 10 inches = 20 inches

3. **Calculate the daily average rain total for the week:**
   - There are 5 days in the week (Monday to Friday).
   - Daily average = Total rain for the week / Number of days
   - Daily average = 20 inches / 5 days = 4 inches

Thus, the daily average rain total for the week is **4 inches**. 

Final answer: **4 inches**.
