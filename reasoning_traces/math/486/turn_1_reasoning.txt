==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine the total amount of rain that fell each day and then calculate the daily average for the week. Let's break it down step by step.

### Step 1: Calculate the Rainfall for Each Day

**Monday:**
- It rained 2 inches in the morning and 1 more inch later that day.
- Total rainfall on Monday = 2 inches + 1 inch = 3 inches.

**Tuesday:**
- It rained twice as much as it did on Monday.
- Total rainfall on Tuesday = 2 × 3 inches = 6 inches.

**Wednesday:**
- It did not rain on Wednesday.
- Total rainfall on Wednesday = 0 inches.

**Thursday:**
- It rained 1 inch.
- Total rainfall on Thursday = 1 inch.

**Friday:**
- The rainfall on Friday was equal to the total rainfall from Monday through Thursday combined.
- First, calculate the total rainfall from Monday to Thursday:
  - Monday: 3 inches
  - Tuesday: 6 inches
  - Wednesday: 0 inches
  - Thursday: 1 inch
  - Total from Monday to Thursday = 3 + 6 + 0 + 1 = 10 inches.
- Therefore, the total rainfall on Friday = 10 inches.

### Step 2: Calculate the Total Rainfall for the Week

Add up the rainfall for each day from Monday to Friday:

- Monday: 3 inches
- Tuesday: 6 inches
- Wednesday: 0 inches
- Thursday: 1 inch
- Friday: 10 inches

Total rainfall for the week = 3 + 6 + 0 + 1 + 10 = 20 inches.

### Step 3: Calculate the Daily Average Rainfall for the Week

The week consists of 7 days (Monday through Sunday), even though it didn't rain on Saturday and Sunday, we still consider these days for the average calculation.

Daily average rainfall = Total rainfall for the week / Number of days in the week
= 20 inches / 7 days
≈ 2.857 inches per day

### Final Answer

The daily average rain total for the week is approximately 2.857 inches.
