==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of rain that fell each day and then find the daily average for the week. Let's break it down step by step.

### Step 1: Calculate the Rainfall for Each Day

**Monday:**
- It rained 2 inches in the morning and 1 more inch later that day.
- Total rain on Monday = 2 inches + 1 inch = 3 inches.

**Tuesday:**
- It rained twice as much as it did on Monday.
- Total rain on Tuesday = 2 Ã— 3 inches = 6 inches.

**Wednesday:**
- It did not rain on Wednesday.
- Total rain on Wednesday = 0 inches.

**Thursday:**
- It rained 1 inch.
- Total rain on Thursday = 1 inch.

**Friday:**
- The rain on Friday was equal to the total from Monday through Thursday combined.
- First, calculate the total rain from Monday to Thursday:
  - Monday: 3 inches
  - Tuesday: 6 inches
  - Wednesday: 0 inches
  - Thursday: 1 inch
  - Total from Monday to Thursday = 3 + 6 + 0 + 1 = 10 inches.
- Therefore, the total rain on Friday = 10 inches.

### Step 2: Calculate the Total Rainfall for the Week

Add up the rainfall for each day from Monday to Friday:
- Monday: 3 inches
- Tuesday: 6 inches
- Wednesday: 0 inches
- Thursday: 1 inch
- Friday: 10 inches

Total rainfall for the week = 3 + 6 + 0 + 1 + 10 = 20 inches.

### Step 3: Calculate the Daily Average Rainfall for the Week

The week consists of 7 days (Monday through Sunday). To find the daily average, divide the total rainfall by the number of days in the week:

\[
\text{Daily average rainfall} = \frac{\text{Total rainfall for the week}}{\text{Number of days in the week}} = \frac{20 \text{ inches}}{7 \text{ days}} \approx 2.857 \text{ inches per day}
\]

### Final Answer

The daily average rain total for the week is approximately 2.857 inches per day.
