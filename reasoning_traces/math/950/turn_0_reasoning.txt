==================================================

Let's denote the points scored by Bahati, Azibo, and Dinar as \( B \), \( A \), and \( D \) respectively. According to the problem, we have the following information:

1. The total points scored by the team is 45:
   \[
   B + A + D = 45
   \]

2. Bahati scored 20 more points than Azibo:
   \[
   B = A + 20
   \]

3. Bahati scored 10 more points than Dinar:
   \[
   B = D + 10
   \]

Now, we can substitute the expressions for \( B \) from the second and third equations into the first equation.

First, let's substitute \( B = A + 20 \) into the total points equation:
\[
(A + 20) + A + D = 45
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
2A + D + 20 = 45
\]
Subtracting 20 from both sides gives:
\[
2A + D = 25 \quad \text{(Equation 1)}
\]

Next, we substitute \( B = D + 10 \) into the total points equation:
\[
(D + 10) + A + D = 45
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
A + 2D + 10 = 45
\]
Subtracting 10 from both sides gives:
\[
A + 2D = 35 \quad \text{(Equation 2)}
\]

Now we have a system of two equations:
1. \( 2A + D = 25 \) (Equation 1)
2. \( A + 2D = 35 \) (Equation 2)

We can solve this system of equations. Let's solve Equation 1 for \( D \):
\[
D = 25 - 2A
\]

Now, we substitute this expression for \( D \) into Equation 2:
\[
A + 2(25 - 2A) = 35
\]
Expanding this gives:
\[
A + 50 - 4A = 35
\]
Combining like terms results in:
\[
-3A + 50 = 35
\]
Subtracting 50 from both sides gives:
\[
-3A = -15
\]
Dividing by -3 results in:
\[
A = 5
\]

Now that we have \( A \), we can find \( D \) using the expression we derived for \( D \):
\[
D = 25 - 2(5) = 25 - 10 = 15
\]

Finally, we can find \( B \) using the equation \( B = A + 20 \):
\[
B = 5 + 20 = 25
\]

To summarize:
- Bahati scored \( B = 25 \)
- Azibo scored \( A = 5 \)
- Dinar scored \( D = 15 \)

We can double-check that these values satisfy the total points:
\[
B + A + D = 25 + 5 + 15 = 45
\]
This is correct.

Thus, the number of points Azibo scored is:
\[
\boxed{5}
\]
