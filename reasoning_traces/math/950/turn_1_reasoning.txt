Question ID: 950
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

Let \( B \), \( A \), and \( D \) represent the points scored by Bahati, Azibo, and Dinar, respectively. According to the problem, we have the following relationships:

1. The total points scored by all three is 45:
   \[
   B + A + D = 45
   \]

2. Bahati scored 20 points more than Azibo:
   \[
   B = A + 20
   \]

3. Bahati scored 10 points more than Dinar:
   \[
   B = D + 10
   \]

Now, we can express \( A \) and \( D \) in terms of \( B \):

From the second equation:
\[
A = B - 20
\]

From the third equation:
\[
D = B - 10
\]

Now, we substitute \( A \) and \( D \) into the total points equation:
\[
B + (B - 20) + (B - 10) = 45
\]

Simplifying this:
\[
B + B - 20 + B - 10 = 45
\]
\[
3B - 30 = 45
\]

Next, we add 30 to both sides:
\[
3B = 75
\]

Now, divide by 3:
\[
B = 25
\]

Now that we have \( B \), we can find \( A \) and \( D \):
\[
A = B - 20 = 25 - 20 = 5
\]
\[
D = B - 10 = 25 - 10 = 15
\]

Thus, the points scored by each player are:
- Bahati: \( B = 25 \)
- Azibo: \( A = 5 \)
- Dinar: \( D = 15 \)

Finally, we confirm the total:
\[
B + A + D = 25 + 5 + 15 = 45
\]

Everything checks out. Therefore, the number of points scored by Azibo is:
\[
\boxed{5}
\]
