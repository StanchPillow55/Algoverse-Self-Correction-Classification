==================================================

To determine how many inches a crocodile will grow in 13 years, we first need to find the growth rate of the crocodile per year based on the information given.

1. **Calculate the growth rate per year**:
   The crocodile grows 8 inches in 4 years. To find the growth per year, we divide the total growth by the number of years:
   \[
   \text{Growth per year} = \frac{\text{Total growth}}{\text{Number of years}} = \frac{8 \text{ inches}}{4 \text{ years}} = 2 \text{ inches per year}
   \]

2. **Calculate the growth in 13 years**:
   Now that we know the crocodile grows 2 inches per year, we can calculate how much it will grow in 13 years by multiplying the growth per year by the number of years:
   \[
   \text{Growth in 13 years} = \text{Growth per year} \times \text{Number of years} = 2 \text{ inches per year} \times 13 \text{ years}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Growth in 13 years} = 26 \text{ inches}
   \]

3. **Final answer**:
   Therefore, the crocodile will grow **26 inches** in 13 years.

In conclusion, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{26}
\]
