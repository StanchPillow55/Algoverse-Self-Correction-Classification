==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to calculate the total number of fish caught by Anakin and Locsin separately, and then sum those totals.

### Step 1: Calculate Anakin's Catches
Anakin caught:
- Starfish: 10
- Sea horses: 6
- Clownfish: 3

Now, we will find the total number of fish caught by Anakin:

\[
\text{Total caught by Anakin} = \text{Starfish} + \text{Sea horses} + \text{Clownfish}
\]
\[
\text{Total caught by Anakin} = 10 + 6 + 3 = 19
\]

### Step 2: Calculate Locsin's Catches
Locsin caught:
- Starfish: 5 fewer than Anakin
- Sea horses: 3 fewer than Anakin
- Clownfish: 2 more than Anakin

Now, we will calculate each type of fish caught by Locsin:

1. **Starfish**:
   \[
   \text{Starfish caught by Locsin} = 10 - 5 = 5
   \]

2. **Sea horses**:
   \[
   \text{Sea horses caught by Locsin} = 6 - 3 = 3
   \]

3. **Clownfish**:
   \[
   \text{Clownfish caught by Locsin} = 3 + 2 = 5
   \]

Now, we will find the total number of fish caught by Locsin:

\[
\text{Total caught by Locsin} = \text{Starfish} + \text{Sea horses} + \text{Clownfish}
\]
\[
\text{Total caught by Locsin} = 5 + 3 + 5 = 13
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the Total Catches
Now, we will find the total number of fish caught by both Anakin and Locsin:

\[
\text{Total fish caught} = \text{Total caught by Anakin} + \text{Total caught by Locsin}
\]
\[
\text{Total fish caught} = 19 + 13 = 32
\]

### Final Answer
The total number of fish that Anakin and Locsin were able to catch is:

\[
\boxed{32}
\]
