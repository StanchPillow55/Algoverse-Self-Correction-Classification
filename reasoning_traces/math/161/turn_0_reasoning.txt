To solve the problem, we need to determine how much of the town's annual budget is allocated to policing and education, and then find out how much money remains for managing public spaces.

1. **Identify the total budget**: The town's annual budget is given as $32 million.

2. **Calculate the amount allocated to policing**: 
   - It is stated that half of the budget goes towards policing. 
   - To find half of the budget, we divide the total budget by 2:
     \[
     \text{Amount for policing} = \frac{32 \text{ million}}{2} = 16 \text{ million}
     \]

3. **Identify the amount allocated to education**: 
   - The problem states that $12 million goes towards education.

4. **Calculate the total amount allocated to policing and education**:
   - We add the amounts allocated to policing and education:
     \[
     \text{Total for policing and education} = \text{Amount for policing} + \text{Amount for education} = 16 \text{ million} + 12 \text{ million} = 28 \text{ million}
     \]

5. **Calculate the remaining budget for managing public spaces**:
   - To find out how much money is left for managing public spaces, we subtract the total amount allocated to policing and education from the total budget:
     \[
     \text{Remaining budget} = \text{Total budget} - \text{Total for policing and education} = 32 \text{ million} - 28 \text{ million} = 4 \text{ million}
     \]

6. **Final answer**: The amount of money left for managing public spaces is:
   \[
   \boxed{4 \text{ million}}
   \]
