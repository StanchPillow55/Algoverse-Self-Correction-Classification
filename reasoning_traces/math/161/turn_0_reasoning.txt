To solve this problem, we need to determine how much of the town's annual budget is left for managing public spaces after accounting for the amounts allocated to policing and education.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the total budget:**
   The total annual budget for the town is $32 million.

2. **Determine the amount allocated to policing:**
   According to the problem, half of the budget goes towards policing. Therefore, we calculate the amount for policing as follows:
   \[
   \text{Amount for policing} = \frac{1}{2} \times 32 \text{ million dollars} = 16 \text{ million dollars}
   \]

3. **Determine the amount allocated to education:**
   The problem states that $12 million goes towards education.

4. **Calculate the total amount already allocated:**
   We add the amounts allocated to policing and education to find the total amount already allocated:
   \[
   \text{Total allocated} = \text{Amount for policing} + \text{Amount for education} = 16 \text{ million dollars} + 12 \text{ million dollars} = 28 \text{ million dollars}
   \]

5. **Calculate the remaining budget for managing public spaces:**
   Subtract the total allocated amount from the total budget to find the remaining budget for managing public spaces:
   \[
   \text{Remaining budget for public spaces} = \text{Total budget} - \text{Total allocated} = 32 \text{ million dollars} - 28 \text{ million dollars} = 4 \text{ million dollars}
   \]

Therefore, the amount of money left for managing public spaces is \(\boxed{4 \text{ million dollars}}\).
