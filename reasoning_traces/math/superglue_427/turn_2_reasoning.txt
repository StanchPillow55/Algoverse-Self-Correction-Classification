Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem effectively, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 427" entails. Since the problem statement is not explicitly provided, I'll assume this is a hypothetical or placeholder question. Let's create a sample math problem and solve it step by step.

**Sample Problem:**
Calculate the sum of the first 100 positive integers.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   We need to find the sum of the first 100 positive integers. These integers are 1, 2, 3, ..., 100.

2. **Identify the Formula:**
   The sum of the first \( n \) positive integers can be calculated using the formula:
   \[
   S = \frac{n(n + 1)}{2}
   \]
   where \( S \) is the sum and \( n \) is the number of terms.

3. **Substitute the Values:**
   Here, \( n = 100 \). Substitute 100 into the formula:
   \[
   S = \frac{100(100 + 1)}{2}
   \]

4. **Perform the Calculations:**
   - Calculate \( 100 + 1 = 101 \).
   - Multiply 100 by 101:
     \[
     100 \times 101 = 10100
     \]
   - Divide the result by 2:
     \[
     S = \frac{10100}{2} = 5050
     \]

5. **Verify the Calculation:**
   To ensure accuracy, let's verify using a different method, such as pairing numbers:
   - Pair the numbers from the start and end: (1 + 100), (2 + 99), ..., (50 + 51).
   - Each pair sums to 101.
   - There are 50 such pairs.
   - Total sum = 50 pairs \(\times\) 101 per pair = 5050.

6. **Conclusion:**
   The sum of the first 100 positive integers is 5050.

**Final Answer:**
The sum of the first 100 positive integers is 5050.
