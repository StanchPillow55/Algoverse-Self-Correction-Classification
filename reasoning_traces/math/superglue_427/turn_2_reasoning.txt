==================================================

To solve a problem effectively, it's important to understand the question, identify the relevant information, and apply appropriate mathematical concepts. However, the problem statement "Sample reasoning question 427" does not provide specific details or context. Therefore, I'll guide you through a general approach to solving math problems, which you can apply to a variety of situations.

### Step-by-Step Approach to Solving Math Problems

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - Carefully read the problem statement.
   - Identify what is being asked.
   - Determine what information is given and what needs to be found.

2. **Devise a Plan:**
   - Consider what mathematical concepts or formulas might be relevant.
   - Think about similar problems you have solved before.
   - Decide on a strategy to tackle the problem (e.g., algebraic manipulation, drawing a diagram, logical reasoning).

3. **Carry Out the Plan:**
   - Execute your chosen strategy step by step.
   - Perform calculations carefully, showing all work.
   - Keep track of units and ensure consistency.

4. **Review/Check Your Work:**
   - Verify each step to ensure accuracy.
   - Check if the final answer makes sense in the context of the problem.
   - If possible, use a different method to confirm the result.

5. **State the Final Answer:**
   - Clearly write down the final answer, including units if applicable.
   - Ensure the answer addresses the question asked.

### Example Problem

Let's apply this approach to a hypothetical problem:

**Problem:** A rectangle has a length that is twice its width. If the perimeter of the rectangle is 36 units, what are the dimensions of the rectangle?

**Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We need to find the length and width of the rectangle.
   - Given: Length = 2 Ã— Width, Perimeter = 36 units.

2. **Devise a Plan:**
   - Use the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle: \( P = 2 \times (\text{Length} + \text{Width}) \).

3. **Carry Out the Plan:**
   - Let the width be \( w \).
   - Then the length is \( 2w \).
   - Substitute into the perimeter formula: 
     \[
     36 = 2 \times (2w + w)
     \]
   - Simplify and solve for \( w \):
     \[
     36 = 2 \times 3w = 6w
     \]
     \[
     w = \frac{36}{6} = 6
     \]
   - Find the length:
     \[
     \text{Length} = 2w = 2 \times 6 = 12
     \]

4. **Review/Check Your Work:**
   - Check the perimeter with these dimensions:
     \[
     P = 2 \times (12 + 6) = 2 \times 18 = 36
     \]
   - The calculations are correct.

5. **State the Final Answer:**
   - The width of the rectangle is 6 units, and the length is 12 units.

This structured approach can be adapted to solve a wide range of mathematical problems. If you have a specific problem or more details, feel free to provide them, and I can offer a more targeted solution.
