==================================================

To solve the problem, we first need to understand what "Sample reasoning question 26" refers to. However, since the problem statement is not provided, I will demonstrate a general approach to solving a typical math problem by making an assumption about the type of problem it could be. Let's assume it's a basic algebra problem, as an example.

**Problem Assumption:**
Let's assume the problem is: Solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   The equation given is \( 2x + 3 = 11 \). We need to find the value of \( x \) that makes this equation true.

2. **Isolate the Variable:**
   To solve for \( x \), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We can do this by performing operations that will leave \( x \) by itself.

3. **Subtract 3 from Both Sides:**
   Start by eliminating the constant term on the left side of the equation. Subtract 3 from both sides:

   \[
   2x + 3 - 3 = 11 - 3
   \]

   Simplifying both sides gives:

   \[
   2x = 8
   \]

4. **Divide by 2:**
   Next, divide both sides of the equation by 2 to solve for \( x \):

   \[
   \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{8}{2}
   \]

   Simplifying both sides gives:

   \[
   x = 4
   \]

5. **Verify the Solution:**
   Substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies the equation:

   \[
   2(4) + 3 = 11
   \]

   Simplifying the left side gives:

   \[
   8 + 3 = 11
   \]

   Since both sides of the equation are equal, our solution \( x = 4 \) is correct.

**Final Answer:**
The solution to the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \) is \( x = 4 \).

This example demonstrates a typical approach to solving a basic algebraic equation. If "Sample reasoning question 26" refers to a different type of problem, please provide additional details or context, and I can adjust the solution accordingly.
