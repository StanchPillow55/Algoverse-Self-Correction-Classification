==================================================

It seems like you've referenced a "Sample reasoning question 26," but I don't have the specific details of that question. However, I can guide you through a general approach to solving a math problem by showing complete reasoning and work. If you provide the specific details of the question, I can tailor the solution to that problem. For now, I'll demonstrate how to approach a typical math problem:

### Example Problem:
**Problem:** Solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We need to find the value of \( x \) that satisfies the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).

2. **Isolate the Variable:**
   - To solve for \( x \), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We start by eliminating the constant term on the left side of the equation.

3. **Subtract 3 from Both Sides:**
   \[
   2x + 3 - 3 = 11 - 3
   \]
   \[
   2x = 8
   \]

4. **Divide by the Coefficient of \( x \):**
   - The coefficient of \( x \) is 2. To isolate \( x \), divide both sides by 2.
   \[
   \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{8}{2}
   \]
   \[
   x = 4
   \]

5. **Verify the Solution:**
   - Substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies the equation.
   \[
   2(4) + 3 = 11
   \]
   \[
   8 + 3 = 11
   \]
   \[
   11 = 11
   \]
   - The left side equals the right side, confirming that \( x = 4 \) is the correct solution.

### Final Answer:
The solution to the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \) is \( x = 4 \).

If you have a specific problem in mind, please provide the details, and I can work through that particular problem for you.
