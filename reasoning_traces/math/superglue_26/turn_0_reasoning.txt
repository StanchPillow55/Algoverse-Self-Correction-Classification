==================================================

To solve the problem, I need more information about "Sample reasoning question 26" as it is not provided in your query. However, I can guide you on how to approach a typical math problem by outlining a general problem-solving strategy. If you provide the specific details of the question, I can offer a more tailored solution. Here's a general approach:

### Step-by-Step Problem-Solving Strategy

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - Read the problem carefully.
   - Identify what is being asked.
   - Determine what information is given.
   - Note any assumptions or constraints.

2. **Devise a Plan:**
   - Consider possible strategies to solve the problem, such as:
     - Drawing a diagram.
     - Creating a table.
     - Writing an equation.
     - Breaking the problem into smaller parts.
   - Choose the strategy that seems most appropriate.

3. **Carry Out the Plan:**
   - Implement the chosen strategy.
   - Perform calculations carefully.
   - Keep track of units and conversions if applicable.
   - Check each step for accuracy.

4. **Review/Check Your Work:**
   - Verify that the solution answers the question.
   - Check calculations and logic.
   - Consider if there is another method to solve the problem and compare results.

5. **State the Final Answer:**
   - Clearly write the final answer.
   - Include units if applicable.

### Example Problem

Let's apply this strategy to a simple example problem:

**Problem:** A rectangle has a length of 10 units and a width of 5 units. What is the area of the rectangle?

**Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We need to find the area of a rectangle.
   - Given: Length = 10 units, Width = 5 units.

2. **Devise a Plan:**
   - Use the formula for the area of a rectangle: Area = Length × Width.

3. **Carry Out the Plan:**
   - Area = 10 units × 5 units = 50 square units.

4. **Review/Check Your Work:**
   - Recalculate to ensure accuracy: 10 × 5 = 50.
   - The calculation is correct.

5. **State the Final Answer:**
   - The area of the rectangle is 50 square units.

If you provide the specific details of "Sample reasoning question 26," I can apply this strategy to solve that particular problem.
