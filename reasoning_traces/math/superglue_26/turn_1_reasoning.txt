==================================================

To solve this problem, I need more context about "Sample reasoning question 26" as it seems to refer to a specific question from a set or a textbook. Without the actual content of the question, I can't provide a solution. However, I can guide you on how to approach solving a typical math problem by breaking it down into steps.

Let's assume a generic math problem and solve it step-by-step:

**Problem:** Solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).

**Step 1: Understand the Problem**

The equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \) is a linear equation in one variable. Our goal is to find the value of \( x \) that makes this equation true.

**Step 2: Isolate the Variable**

To solve for \( x \), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We can do this by performing inverse operations.

1. **Subtract 3 from both sides** to get rid of the constant term on the left side:
   \[
   2x + 3 - 3 = 11 - 3
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   2x = 8
   \]

2. **Divide both sides by 2** to solve for \( x \):
   \[
   \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{8}{2}
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   x = 4
   \]

**Step 3: Verify the Solution**

Substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies the equation:
\[
2(4) + 3 = 11
\]
Calculating the left side:
\[
8 + 3 = 11
\]
Since both sides of the equation are equal, \( x = 4 \) is indeed the correct solution.

**Final Answer:**

The solution to the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \) is \( x = 4 \).
