==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 26" refers to. Since the problem statement is not fully provided, I'll assume it's a generic math problem and demonstrate a step-by-step approach to solving a typical math problem. Let's consider a hypothetical problem:

**Problem:**  
Solve for \( x \) in the equation:  
\[ 2x + 3 = 11 \]

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Equation:**
   - We have a linear equation in one variable, \( x \).
   - The equation is \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).

2. **Isolate the Variable:**
   - Our goal is to solve for \( x \). To do this, we need to isolate \( x \) on one side of the equation.
   - Start by eliminating the constant term on the left side of the equation. We do this by subtracting 3 from both sides:
     \[
     2x + 3 - 3 = 11 - 3
     \]
     Simplifying both sides gives:
     \[
     2x = 8
     \]

3. **Solve for \( x \):**
   - Now, we need to solve for \( x \) by getting rid of the coefficient of \( x \), which is 2.
   - Divide both sides of the equation by 2:
     \[
     \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{8}{2}
     \]
     Simplifying both sides gives:
     \[
     x = 4
     \]

4. **Verify the Solution:**
   - Substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies the equation:
     \[
     2(4) + 3 = 11
     \]
     Simplifying the left side gives:
     \[
     8 + 3 = 11
     \]
     Since both sides of the equation are equal, our solution \( x = 4 \) is correct.

**Final Answer:**
The solution to the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \) is \( x = 4 \).

This step-by-step approach demonstrates how to solve a basic linear equation. If "Sample reasoning question 26" refers to a different problem, please provide the specific details so I can address it accurately.
