==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to determine how many people John lost to after arm wrestling 20 people, given that he beats 80% of them.

### Step 1: Calculate the number of people John beats
John beats 80% of the 20 people he arm wrestles. To find out how many people this is, we can calculate:

\[
\text{Number of people John beats} = \text{Total number of people} \times \text{Percentage beaten}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\text{Number of people John beats} = 20 \times 0.80
\]

Calculating this gives:

\[
\text{Number of people John beats} = 20 \times 0.80 = 16
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the number of people John loses to
To find out how many people John lost to, we subtract the number of people he beats from the total number of people he arm wrestled:

\[
\text{Number of people John loses to} = \text{Total number of people} - \text{Number of people John beats}
\]

Substituting the values we have:

\[
\text{Number of people John loses to} = 20 - 16
\]

Calculating this gives:

\[
\text{Number of people John loses to} = 4
\]

### Final Answer
John lost to **4 people**.
