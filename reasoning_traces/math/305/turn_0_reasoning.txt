==================================================

To determine how much money Tommy needs to save up to buy 8 new books, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total cost of the books**: 
   Each book costs $5, and Tommy wants to buy 8 books. We can find the total cost by multiplying the number of books by the cost per book.

   \[
   \text{Total cost} = \text{Number of books} \times \text{Cost per book}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = 8 \times 5 = 40
   \]

   So, the total cost for 8 books is $40.

2. **Determine how much money Tommy already has**: 
   Tommy currently has $13.

3. **Calculate how much more money Tommy needs**: 
   To find out how much more money Tommy needs to save, we subtract the amount he already has from the total cost of the books.

   \[
   \text{Amount needed} = \text{Total cost} - \text{Amount Tommy has}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Amount needed} = 40 - 13 = 27
   \]

   Therefore, Tommy needs to save an additional $27.

4. **Final answer**: 
   Tommy needs to save up **$27** to buy the 8 new books.

Thus, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{27}
\]
