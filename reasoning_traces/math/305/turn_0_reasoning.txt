==================================================

To determine how much money Tommy needs to save up to buy 8 new books, we can break the problem down into a series of steps:

1. **Calculate the total cost of the books:**

   Each book costs $5, and Tommy wants to buy 8 books. Therefore, the total cost of the books can be calculated by multiplying the cost per book by the number of books:

   \[
   \text{Total cost of books} = 8 \times 5 = 40
   \]

   So, the total cost for 8 books is $40.

2. **Determine how much money Tommy already has:**

   Tommy already has $13.

3. **Calculate how much more money Tommy needs:**

   To find out how much more money Tommy needs to save, we subtract the amount of money he already has from the total cost of the books:

   \[
   \text{Amount needed to save} = \text{Total cost of books} - \text{Money Tommy already has}
   \]

   Substituting the known values:

   \[
   \text{Amount needed to save} = 40 - 13 = 27
   \]

   Therefore, Tommy needs to save up $27 more to be able to buy the 8 books.

**Final Answer:**

Tommy needs to save up $27.
