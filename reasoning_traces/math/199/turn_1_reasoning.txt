==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine how much Gary is paying per month under two different repayment plans: one over 5 years and the other over 2 years. Then, we'll find the difference between these two monthly payments.

**Step 1: Calculate the monthly payment for the 5-year plan.**

1. The total amount Gary borrowed is $6,000.
2. The repayment period for the 5-year plan is 5 years.
3. There are 12 months in a year, so over 5 years, there are:
   \[
   5 \text{ years} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 60 \text{ months}
   \]
4. To find the monthly payment, divide the total amount by the number of months:
   \[
   \frac{6,000}{60} = 100
   \]
   So, Gary would pay $100 per month under the 5-year plan.

**Step 2: Calculate the monthly payment for the 2-year plan.**

1. The repayment period for the 2-year plan is 2 years.
2. Over 2 years, there are:
   \[
   2 \text{ years} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 24 \text{ months}
   \]
3. To find the monthly payment, divide the total amount by the number of months:
   \[
   \frac{6,000}{24} = 250
   \]
   So, Gary would pay $250 per month under the 2-year plan.

**Step 3: Calculate the difference in monthly payments.**

1. Subtract the monthly payment of the 5-year plan from the monthly payment of the 2-year plan:
   \[
   250 - 100 = 150
   \]

Therefore, Gary is spending $150 more per month to pay off the loan in 2 years instead of 5 years.

**Final Answer:**
Gary is spending $150 more per month to pay the loan off in 2 years instead of 5.
