To determine how much more Gary is spending per month to pay off the loan in 2 years instead of 5 years, we will first calculate the monthly payments for both scenarios.

### Step 1: Calculate the monthly payment for 5 years

1. **Total loan amount**: $6,000
2. **Loan term**: 5 years
3. **Convert years to months**: 
   \[
   5 \text{ years} = 5 \times 12 = 60 \text{ months}
   \]
4. **Monthly payment calculation**:
   \[
   \text{Monthly payment} = \frac{\text{Total loan amount}}{\text{Number of months}} = \frac{6000}{60} = 100
   \]

So, if Gary pays back the loan over 5 years, his monthly payment will be **$100**.

### Step 2: Calculate the monthly payment for 2 years

1. **Loan term**: 2 years
2. **Convert years to months**: 
   \[
   2 \text{ years} = 2 \times 12 = 24 \text{ months}
   \]
3. **Monthly payment calculation**:
   \[
   \text{Monthly payment} = \frac{\text{Total loan amount}}{\text{Number of months}} = \frac{6000}{24} = 250
   \]

So, if Gary pays back the loan over 2 years, his monthly payment will be **$250**.

### Step 3: Calculate the difference in monthly payments

Now we will find out how much more Gary is spending per month when he pays off the loan in 2 years compared to 5 years.

1. **Difference in monthly payments**:
   \[
   \text{Difference} = \text{Monthly payment for 2 years} - \text{Monthly payment for 5 years}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Difference} = 250 - 100 = 150
   \]

### Final Answer

Gary is spending **$150 more per month** to pay off the loan in 2 years instead of 5 years.
