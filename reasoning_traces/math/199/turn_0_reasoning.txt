To solve the problem, we need to break it down step by step.

1. **Identify the payment rates:**
   - Publisher A pays Mark 5 cents per sentence.
   - Publisher B pays Mark twice what Publisher A pays. Therefore, the payment from Publisher B is:
     \[
     \text{Payment from Publisher B} = 2 \times \text{Payment from Publisher A} = 2 \times 5 \text{ cents} = 10 \text{ cents}
     \]

2. **Determine the number of sentences edited for each publisher:**
   - Mark edits a total of 1000 sentences each week, and he edits an equal number of sentences for both publishers. Therefore, the number of sentences edited for each publisher is:
     \[
     \text{Sentences per publisher} = \frac{1000 \text{ sentences}}{2} = 500 \text{ sentences}
     \]

3. **Calculate the earnings from each publisher:**
   - **Earnings from Publisher A:**
     \[
     \text{Earnings from Publisher A} = \text{Sentences edited for A} \times \text{Payment per sentence from A} = 500 \text{ sentences} \times 5 \text{ cents/sentence} = 2500 \text{ cents}
     \]
   - **Earnings from Publisher B:**
     \[
     \text{Earnings from Publisher B} = \text{Sentences edited for B} \times \text{Payment per sentence from B} = 500 \text{ sentences} \times 10 \text{ cents/sentence} = 5000 \text{ cents}
     \]

4. **Calculate the total earnings for the week:**
   - The total earnings are the sum of the earnings from both publishers:
     \[
     \text{Total earnings} = \text{Earnings from Publisher A} + \text{Earnings from Publisher B} = 2500 \text{ cents} + 5000 \text{ cents} = 7500 \text{ cents}
     \]

5. **Final answer:**
   - Therefore, Mark makes a total of **7500 cents** in a week.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{7500}
\]
