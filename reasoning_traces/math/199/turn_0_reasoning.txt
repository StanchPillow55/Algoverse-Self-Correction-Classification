To solve this problem, we need to determine how much Gary would pay per month if he repaid the loan over 5 years versus 2 years, and then find the difference between these two monthly payments.

### Step 1: Calculate the monthly payment for a 5-year repayment plan

1. **Total loan amount**: $6,000
2. **Repayment period**: 5 years

First, convert the repayment period from years to months:
\[ 5 \text{ years} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 60 \text{ months} \]

Now, calculate the monthly payment for a 5-year plan:
\[ \text{Monthly payment for 5 years} = \frac{\text{Total loan amount}}{\text{Number of months}} = \frac{6000}{60} = 100 \]

### Step 2: Calculate the monthly payment for a 2-year repayment plan

1. **Total loan amount**: $6,000
2. **Repayment period**: 2 years

Convert the repayment period from years to months:
\[ 2 \text{ years} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 24 \text{ months} \]

Now, calculate the monthly payment for a 2-year plan:
\[ \text{Monthly payment for 2 years} = \frac{\text{Total loan amount}}{\text{Number of months}} = \frac{6000}{24} = 250 \]

### Step 3: Calculate the difference in monthly payments

Now, we find the difference between the monthly payments for the 2-year plan and the 5-year plan:
\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Monthly payment for 2 years} - \text{Monthly payment for 5 years} = 250 - 100 = 150 \]

### Final Answer

Gary is spending $150 more per month to pay off the loan in 2 years instead of 5 years.
