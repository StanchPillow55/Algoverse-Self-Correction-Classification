Question ID: superglue_345
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 345" entails. Since the problem statement is not specific, let's assume it involves a mathematical reasoning problem that requires a step-by-step approach.

### Step 1: Identify the Problem Type
Since the problem is labeled as "Sample reasoning question 345," it could involve numerical reasoning, logical reasoning, or pattern recognition. Without specific details, let's assume it's a numerical reasoning problem involving basic arithmetic or algebra.

### Step 2: Define the Problem
Let's assume the problem is to find the sum of a sequence of numbers or solve a simple algebraic equation. For illustration, let's consider a basic algebraic problem:

**Example Problem:** Solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).

### Step 3: Solve the Problem
1. **Isolate the Variable:** 
   - Start by isolating the term with the variable \( x \). To do this, subtract 3 from both sides of the equation:
     \[
     2x + 3 - 3 = 11 - 3
     \]
     Simplifying both sides gives:
     \[
     2x = 8
     \]

2. **Solve for \( x \):**
   - Now, divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( x \):
     \[
     \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{8}{2}
     \]
     Simplifying gives:
     \[
     x = 4
     \]

### Step 4: Verify the Solution
- Substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation to verify:
  \[
  2(4) + 3 = 11
  \]
  Simplifying the left side:
  \[
  8 + 3 = 11
  \]
  Since both sides of the equation are equal, our solution \( x = 4 \) is verified.

### Final Answer
The solution to the problem is \( x = 4 \).

This example illustrates a typical approach to solving a basic algebraic equation. If the original "Sample reasoning question 345" involves a different type of problem, the approach would be adjusted accordingly to fit the specific requirements of that problem.
