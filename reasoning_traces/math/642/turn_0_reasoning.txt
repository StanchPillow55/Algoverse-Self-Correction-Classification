==================================================

To find the total cost of James's new wardrobe, we will calculate the costs of the suits, dress pants, and dress shirts separately, and then sum them up.

### Step 1: Calculate the cost of the suits
James buys 10 suits, and each suit costs $750.

\[
\text{Cost of suits} = \text{Number of suits} \times \text{Cost per suit}
\]
\[
\text{Cost of suits} = 10 \times 750 = 7500
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the cost of the dress pants
The dress pants cost 1/5 of the cost of each suit. 

\[
\text{Cost of dress pants per pair} = \frac{1}{5} \times \text{Cost per suit}
\]
\[
\text{Cost of dress pants per pair} = \frac{1}{5} \times 750 = 150
\]

James buys 10 pairs of dress pants.

\[
\text{Cost of dress pants} = \text{Number of pants} \times \text{Cost per pair}
\]
\[
\text{Cost of dress pants} = 10 \times 150 = 1500
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the cost of the dress shirts
James buys 3 dress shirts for each suit. Since he has 10 suits, the total number of dress shirts is:

\[
\text{Total dress shirts} = \text{Number of suits} \times \text{Shirts per suit}
\]
\[
\text{Total dress shirts} = 10 \times 3 = 30
\]

Each dress shirt costs $60.

\[
\text{Cost of dress shirts} = \text{Total dress shirts} \times \text{Cost per shirt}
\]
\[
\text{Cost of dress shirts} = 30 \times 60 = 1800
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the total cost
Now, we will sum the costs of the suits, dress pants, and dress shirts.

\[
\text{Total cost} = \text{Cost of suits} + \text{Cost of dress pants} + \text{Cost of dress shirts}
\]
\[
\text{Total cost} = 7500 + 1500 + 1800
\]
\[
\text{Total cost} = 10800
\]

### Final Answer
The total cost of James's new wardrobe is **$10,800**.
