==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 180" refers to. However, since the problem statement does not provide any specific details or context about "Sample reasoning question 180," we need to make some assumptions or request more information to proceed accurately.

Given that we don't have any specific details about the problem, let's consider a hypothetical scenario where "Sample reasoning question 180" might involve a common type of reasoning or math problem. For the sake of illustration, let's assume it involves a basic arithmetic or algebraic problem.

Let's assume "Sample reasoning question 180" is a simple algebra problem:

**Problem:** Solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).

**Step-by-step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Equation:**
   The equation given is \( 2x + 3 = 11 \). Our goal is to solve for \( x \).

2. **Isolate the Variable:**
   To solve for \( x \), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We start by eliminating the constant term on the left side of the equation.

   \[
   2x + 3 = 11
   \]

   Subtract 3 from both sides:

   \[
   2x + 3 - 3 = 11 - 3
   \]

   Simplifying both sides gives:

   \[
   2x = 8
   \]

3. **Solve for \( x \):**
   Now, we need to solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides of the equation by 2:

   \[
   \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{8}{2}
   \]

   Simplifying both sides gives:

   \[
   x = 4
   \]

4. **Verify the Solution:**
   To ensure our solution is correct, we substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation:

   \[
   2(4) + 3 = 11
   \]

   Simplifying the left side:

   \[
   8 + 3 = 11
   \]

   Since both sides of the equation are equal, our solution is verified.

**Final Answer:**

The solution to the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \) is \( x = 4 \).

If "Sample reasoning question 180" refers to a different type of problem, please provide additional context or details so that I can assist you more accurately.
