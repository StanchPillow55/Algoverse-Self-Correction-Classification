==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to understand what "Sample reasoning question 180" refers to. Since there is no specific mathematical problem given, I'll assume this is a placeholder for a typical math problem. Let's create a sample math problem and solve it step by step.

**Sample Problem:**

A car travels from City A to City B at a constant speed. The distance between the two cities is 180 miles. If the car travels at a speed of 60 miles per hour, how long does it take for the car to reach City B from City A?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We need to find the time it takes for a car to travel 180 miles at a speed of 60 miles per hour.

2. **Identify the Formula:**
   - The formula to calculate time when distance and speed are known is:
     \[
     \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}}
     \]

3. **Substitute the Given Values:**
   - Distance = 180 miles
   - Speed = 60 miles per hour

   Substitute these values into the formula:
   \[
   \text{Time} = \frac{180 \text{ miles}}{60 \text{ miles per hour}}
   \]

4. **Perform the Calculation:**
   - Divide 180 by 60:
     \[
     \text{Time} = \frac{180}{60} = 3 \text{ hours}
     \]

5. **Verify the Calculation:**
   - To ensure the calculation is correct, consider the units:
     - Miles cancel out, leaving hours as the unit for time, which is appropriate.
   - Recalculate to confirm:
     \[
     180 \div 60 = 3
     \]

6. **State the Final Answer:**
   - The car takes 3 hours to travel from City A to City B.

Therefore, the final answer is that it takes 3 hours for the car to reach City B from City A.
