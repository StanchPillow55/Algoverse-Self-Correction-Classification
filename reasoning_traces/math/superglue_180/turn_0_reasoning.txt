==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to understand what "Sample reasoning question 180" refers to. Since the question is not explicitly provided, I'll assume it's a typical math problem that might involve logical reasoning or numerical calculations. Let's create a hypothetical problem and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**

"Calculate the sum of all even numbers between 1 and 180."

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Identify the Sequence:**
   - The even numbers between 1 and 180 are: 2, 4, 6, ..., 180.

2. **Determine the Sequence Characteristics:**
   - This is an arithmetic sequence where the first term \( a_1 = 2 \) and the common difference \( d = 2 \).

3. **Find the Number of Terms:**
   - The general formula for the \( n \)-th term of an arithmetic sequence is:
     \[
     a_n = a_1 + (n-1) \cdot d
     \]
   - We need to find \( n \) such that \( a_n = 180 \):
     \[
     180 = 2 + (n-1) \cdot 2
     \]
     \[
     180 = 2 + 2n - 2
     \]
     \[
     180 = 2n
     \]
     \[
     n = \frac{180}{2} = 90
     \]
   - There are 90 even numbers between 1 and 180.

4. **Calculate the Sum of the Sequence:**
   - The sum \( S_n \) of the first \( n \) terms of an arithmetic sequence is given by:
     \[
     S_n = \frac{n}{2} \cdot (a_1 + a_n)
     \]
   - Substitute the known values:
     \[
     S_{90} = \frac{90}{2} \cdot (2 + 180)
     \]
     \[
     S_{90} = 45 \cdot 182
     \]

5. **Perform the Multiplication:**
   - Calculate \( 45 \times 182 \):
     \[
     45 \times 182 = 45 \times (180 + 2) = 45 \times 180 + 45 \times 2
     \]
     \[
     45 \times 180 = 8100
     \]
     \[
     45 \times 2 = 90
     \]
     \[
     45 \times 182 = 8100 + 90 = 8190
     \]

**Final Answer:**

The sum of all even numbers between 1 and 180 is \( 8190 \).
