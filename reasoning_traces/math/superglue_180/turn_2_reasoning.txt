Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 180" refers to. Since the question is not explicitly stated, I'll assume it's a placeholder for a typical math problem. Let's create a sample math problem and solve it step by step.

**Sample Problem:**
A car travels from City A to City B at a constant speed of 60 miles per hour. The distance between City A and City B is 180 miles. How long does the journey take?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Identify the Given Information:**
   - Speed of the car: 60 miles per hour
   - Distance between City A and City B: 180 miles

2. **Determine What We Need to Find:**
   - We need to find the time it takes for the car to travel from City A to City B.

3. **Use the Formula for Time:**
   The formula to calculate time when distance and speed are known is:
   \[
   \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}}
   \]

4. **Substitute the Given Values into the Formula:**
   \[
   \text{Time} = \frac{180 \text{ miles}}{60 \text{ miles per hour}}
   \]

5. **Perform the Calculation:**
   \[
   \text{Time} = \frac{180}{60} = 3 \text{ hours}
   \]

6. **Verify the Calculation:**
   - To ensure the calculation is correct, consider the units:
     - Distance is in miles, and speed is in miles per hour, so the resulting time is in hours.
   - The calculation \(\frac{180}{60}\) simplifies to 3, confirming the time is 3 hours.

7. **State the Final Answer:**
   The journey from City A to City B takes 3 hours.

By following these steps, we have solved the problem completely, showing all calculations and reasoning. The final answer is that the journey takes 3 hours.
