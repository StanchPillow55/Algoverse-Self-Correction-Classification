==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 180" refers to. Since there is no specific mathematical problem stated, I will assume this is a placeholder for a typical math problem. Let's create a problem and solve it step by step.

**Problem:**
Calculate the sum of all even numbers between 1 and 180.

**Step-by-step Solution:**

1. **Identify the even numbers between 1 and 180:**
   - Even numbers are integers divisible by 2.
   - The first even number greater than 1 is 2.
   - The last even number less than or equal to 180 is 180.

2. **Determine the sequence of even numbers:**
   - The sequence of even numbers from 2 to 180 is an arithmetic sequence where the first term \( a_1 = 2 \) and the common difference \( d = 2 \).

3. **Find the number of terms in the sequence:**
   - The general formula for the \( n \)-th term of an arithmetic sequence is:
     \[
     a_n = a_1 + (n-1) \cdot d
     \]
   - Set \( a_n = 180 \) to find \( n \):
     \[
     180 = 2 + (n-1) \cdot 2
     \]
     \[
     180 = 2 + 2n - 2
     \]
     \[
     180 = 2n
     \]
     \[
     n = \frac{180}{2} = 90
     \]
   - There are 90 even numbers between 1 and 180.

4. **Calculate the sum of the sequence:**
   - The sum \( S_n \) of the first \( n \) terms of an arithmetic sequence is given by:
     \[
     S_n = \frac{n}{2} \cdot (a_1 + a_n)
     \]
   - Substitute the known values:
     \[
     S_{90} = \frac{90}{2} \cdot (2 + 180)
     \]
     \[
     S_{90} = 45 \cdot 182
     \]
   - Calculate \( 45 \times 182 \):
     \[
     45 \times 182 = 45 \times (180 + 2) = 45 \times 180 + 45 \times 2
     \]
     \[
     45 \times 180 = 8100
     \]
     \[
     45 \times 2 = 90
     \]
     \[
     45 \times 182 = 8100 + 90 = 8190
     \]

5. **Final Answer:**
   - The sum of all even numbers between 1 and 180 is \( \boxed{8190} \).
