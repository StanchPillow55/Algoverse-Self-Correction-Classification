==================================================

To solve the problem effectively, let's first clarify what "Sample reasoning question 197" might entail. Since no specific details are provided about the content of this question, I'll assume it's a generic math problem that requires logical reasoning and problem-solving skills. I will create a hypothetical problem and solve it step-by-step.

### Hypothetical Problem:
**Question 197:**
A train travels from City A to City B at a speed of 60 miles per hour. After reaching City B, it immediately returns to City A at a speed of 40 miles per hour. The total round trip takes 5 hours. What is the distance between City A and City B?

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( d \) be the distance between City A and City B in miles.

2. **Calculate Time for Each Leg of the Trip:**
   - **Time from City A to City B:** 
     \[
     \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{d}{60} \text{ hours}
     \]
   - **Time from City B to City A:**
     \[
     \text{Time} = \frac{d}{40} \text{ hours}
     \]

3. **Set Up the Equation for Total Time:**
   - The total time for the round trip is given as 5 hours. Therefore, we can write:
     \[
     \frac{d}{60} + \frac{d}{40} = 5
     \]

4. **Solve the Equation:**
   - To solve the equation, find a common denominator for the fractions. The least common multiple of 60 and 40 is 120.
   - Rewrite the equation with a common denominator:
     \[
     \frac{2d}{120} + \frac{3d}{120} = 5
     \]
   - Combine the fractions:
     \[
     \frac{5d}{120} = 5
     \]
   - Simplify the equation by multiplying both sides by 120 to eliminate the fraction:
     \[
     5d = 600
     \]
   - Divide both sides by 5 to solve for \( d \):
     \[
     d = 120
     \]

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The distance between City A and City B is 120 miles.

### Final Answer:
The distance between City A and City B is 120 miles.
