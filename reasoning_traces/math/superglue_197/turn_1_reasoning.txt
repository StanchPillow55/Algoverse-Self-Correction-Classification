Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 197" entails. Since the problem statement is not explicitly given, I'll demonstrate a general approach to solving a typical math problem by breaking it down into steps. Let's assume this is a math problem involving algebraic reasoning.

### Step 1: Understand the Problem
Without specific details, let's assume a hypothetical algebra problem: 

**Problem:** Solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 3x + 5 = 20 \).

### Step 2: Identify What is Being Asked
We need to find the value of \( x \) that satisfies the equation.

### Step 3: Plan a Solution
To solve for \( x \), we need to isolate \( x \) on one side of the equation. This involves basic algebraic manipulation.

### Step 4: Execute the Plan
1. **Subtract 5 from both sides**:  
   \[
   3x + 5 - 5 = 20 - 5
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   3x = 15
   \]

2. **Divide both sides by 3**:  
   \[
   \frac{3x}{3} = \frac{15}{3}
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   x = 5
   \]

### Step 5: Verify the Solution
Substitute \( x = 5 \) back into the original equation to ensure it holds true:
\[
3(5) + 5 = 20
\]
\[
15 + 5 = 20
\]
\[
20 = 20
\]
The left-hand side equals the right-hand side, confirming that \( x = 5 \) is indeed the correct solution.

### Final Answer
The solution to the equation \( 3x + 5 = 20 \) is \( x = 5 \).

This approach demonstrates a structured method to solving algebraic equations, which can be applied to a variety of similar problems. If "Sample reasoning question 197" refers to a different type of problem, please provide additional details for a more specific solution.
