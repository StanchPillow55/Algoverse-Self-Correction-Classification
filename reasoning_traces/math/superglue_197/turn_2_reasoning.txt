==================================================

To solve the problem effectively, I need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 197" refers to. Since the question is not explicitly stated, I will assume it is a placeholder for a typical math problem. Without specific details, I will create a hypothetical math problem and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**

A farmer has a rectangular field that is 120 meters long and 80 meters wide. He wants to build a fence around the entire field and also divide the field into two equal smaller rectangles by adding a fence parallel to the shorter side. How much fencing material does he need in total?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Calculate the Perimeter of the Entire Field:**

   The perimeter \( P \) of a rectangle is given by the formula:
   \[
   P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width})
   \]

   For the entire field:
   \[
   P = 2 \times (120 \, \text{m} + 80 \, \text{m}) = 2 \times 200 \, \text{m} = 400 \, \text{m}
   \]

2. **Calculate the Length of the Fence Needed to Divide the Field:**

   The farmer wants to divide the field into two equal smaller rectangles by adding a fence parallel to the shorter side (width). This means the dividing fence will be along the length of the field.

   The length of this dividing fence is equal to the length of the field:
   \[
   \text{Length of dividing fence} = 120 \, \text{m}
   \]

3. **Calculate the Total Fencing Material Needed:**

   The total fencing material required is the sum of the perimeter of the field and the dividing fence:
   \[
   \text{Total fencing} = \text{Perimeter of field} + \text{Length of dividing fence}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total fencing} = 400 \, \text{m} + 120 \, \text{m} = 520 \, \text{m}
   \]

**Final Answer:**

The farmer needs a total of 520 meters of fencing material to enclose the field and divide it into two equal smaller rectangles.
