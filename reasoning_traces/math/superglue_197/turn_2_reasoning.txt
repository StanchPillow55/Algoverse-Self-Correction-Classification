==================================================

To solve the problem effectively, I need more specific information about "Sample reasoning question 197." Since the problem statement is not provided, I'll demonstrate how to approach a typical math reasoning problem by creating an example problem and solving it step by step.

**Example Problem:**

A train travels from City A to City B at a speed of 60 km/h. After reaching City B, it immediately returns to City A at a speed of 90 km/h. The total travel time for the round trip is 5 hours. What is the distance between City A and City B?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( d \) be the distance between City A and City B in kilometers.

2. **Determine Time for Each Leg of the Trip:**
   - Time taken to travel from City A to City B at 60 km/h is \( \frac{d}{60} \) hours.
   - Time taken to travel back from City B to City A at 90 km/h is \( \frac{d}{90} \) hours.

3. **Set Up the Equation for Total Time:**
   - The total travel time for the round trip is given as 5 hours. Therefore, we can write the equation:
     \[
     \frac{d}{60} + \frac{d}{90} = 5
     \]

4. **Solve the Equation:**
   - To solve the equation, find a common denominator for the fractions. The least common multiple of 60 and 90 is 180.
   - Rewrite the equation with a common denominator:
     \[
     \frac{3d}{180} + \frac{2d}{180} = 5
     \]
   - Combine the fractions:
     \[
     \frac{5d}{180} = 5
     \]
   - Multiply both sides by 180 to eliminate the fraction:
     \[
     5d = 900
     \]
   - Divide both sides by 5 to solve for \( d \):
     \[
     d = 180
     \]

5. **Verify the Solution:**
   - Calculate the time for each leg of the trip using \( d = 180 \):
     - Time from City A to City B: \( \frac{180}{60} = 3 \) hours.
     - Time from City B to City A: \( \frac{180}{90} = 2 \) hours.
   - Total time: \( 3 + 2 = 5 \) hours, which matches the given total travel time.

**Final Answer:**

The distance between City A and City B is 180 kilometers.
