It seems like you've referenced a "Sample reasoning question 197," but without specific details about the problem, I can't provide a direct solution. However, I can guide you on how to approach a typical math problem with step-by-step reasoning. If you have a specific problem in mind, please provide the details. For now, I'll demonstrate a general approach to solving a math problem:

### Example Problem:
Let's say the problem is: "Solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \)."

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We need to find the value of \( x \) that makes the equation true.

2. **Isolate the Variable:**
   - The equation given is \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).
   - To isolate \( x \), we first need to get rid of the constant term on the left side. We can do this by subtracting 3 from both sides of the equation.

   \[
   2x + 3 - 3 = 11 - 3
   \]

   Simplifying both sides gives:

   \[
   2x = 8
   \]

3. **Solve for the Variable:**
   - Now, we need to solve for \( x \). Since \( 2x \) means \( 2 \times x \), we can divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( x \).

   \[
   \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{8}{2}
   \]

   Simplifying both sides gives:

   \[
   x = 4
   \]

4. **Verify the Solution:**
   - Substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies the equation.

   \[
   2(4) + 3 = 11
   \]

   Simplifying the left side gives:

   \[
   8 + 3 = 11
   \]

   Since both sides of the equation are equal, our solution is verified.

5. **State the Final Answer:**
   - The solution to the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \) is \( x = 4 \).

This is a basic example of how to approach solving a linear equation. If you have a specific problem or a different type of math question, please provide the details, and I can work through that problem specifically.
