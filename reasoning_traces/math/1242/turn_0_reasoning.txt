==================================================

To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the number of red hats:**
   - Skyler has a total of 100 hats.
   - According to the problem, half of the hats are red.
   - Therefore, the number of red hats is:
     \[
     \text{Number of red hats} = \frac{100}{2} = 50
     \]

2. **Calculate the number of remaining hats after accounting for the red hats:**
   - Since there are 50 red hats, the number of remaining hats is:
     \[
     \text{Remaining hats} = 100 - 50 = 50
     \]

3. **Determine the number of blue hats:**
   - The problem states that \( \frac{3}{5} \) of the remaining hats are blue.
   - To find the number of blue hats, we calculate:
     \[
     \text{Number of blue hats} = \frac{3}{5} \times 50
     \]
   - Performing the multiplication:
     \[
     \text{Number of blue hats} = 30
     \]

4. **Calculate the number of white hats:**
   - After accounting for the red and blue hats, we can find the number of white hats by subtracting the number of red and blue hats from the total number of hats.
   - The total number of hats is 100, and we have already determined that there are 50 red hats and 30 blue hats.
   - Thus, the number of white hats is:
     \[
     \text{Number of white hats} = 100 - (50 + 30)
     \]
   - Simplifying this gives:
     \[
     \text{Number of white hats} = 100 - 80 = 20
     \]

5. **Final answer:**
   - Therefore, the number of white hats that Skyler has is:
     \[
     \boxed{20}
     \]
