==================================================

Let's start by determining Melanie's current age. According to the problem, in 10 years, Melanie will be 18 years old. 

To find her current age, we can set up the following equation:

\[
\text{Current Age} + 10 = 18
\]

Subtracting 10 from both sides gives us:

\[
\text{Current Age} = 18 - 10 = 8
\]

So, Melanie is currently 8 years old.

Next, we need to find out in how many years her age will be thrice her present age. Her present age is 8, so we need to find the time \( x \) such that:

\[
\text{Current Age} + x = 3 \times \text{Current Age}
\]

Substituting her current age into the equation gives:

\[
8 + x = 3 \times 8
\]

Calculating \( 3 \times 8 \):

\[
3 \times 8 = 24
\]

Now, we can rewrite the equation:

\[
8 + x = 24
\]

To solve for \( x \), we subtract 8 from both sides:

\[
x = 24 - 8 = 16
\]

Thus, in 16 years, Melanie's age will be thrice her present age.

To summarize:

- Melanie's current age is 8 years.
- In 16 years, she will be \( 8 + 16 = 24 \) years old.
- Thrice her current age is \( 3 \times 8 = 24 \).

Therefore, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{16}
\]
