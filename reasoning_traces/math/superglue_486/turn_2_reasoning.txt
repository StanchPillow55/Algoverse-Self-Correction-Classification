Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 486" entails. Since the problem statement is not specific, I'll assume this is a generic math problem-solving task. Let's create a hypothetical math problem and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**

A store sells two types of candies: chocolate and gummy bears. The price of a chocolate is $2, and the price of a gummy bear is $1.50. If a customer buys a total of 20 candies and spends $32, how many chocolates and gummy bears did the customer purchase?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( x \) be the number of chocolates.
   - Let \( y \) be the number of gummy bears.

2. **Set Up Equations:**
   - From the problem, we know the total number of candies is 20:
     \[
     x + y = 20
     \]
   - We also know the total cost is $32:
     \[
     2x + 1.5y = 32
     \]

3. **Solve the System of Equations:**

   We have the system:
   \[
   \begin{align*}
   x + y &= 20 \quad \text{(Equation 1)} \\
   2x + 1.5y &= 32 \quad \text{(Equation 2)}
   \end{align*}
   \]

   **Step 1: Solve Equation 1 for \( y \):**
   \[
   y = 20 - x
   \]

   **Step 2: Substitute \( y \) in Equation 2:**
   \[
   2x + 1.5(20 - x) = 32
   \]

   **Step 3: Simplify and solve for \( x \):**
   \[
   2x + 30 - 1.5x = 32
   \]
   \[
   0.5x + 30 = 32
   \]
   \[
   0.5x = 2
   \]
   \[
   x = \frac{2}{0.5} = 4
   \]

   **Step 4: Substitute \( x = 4 \) back into Equation 1 to find \( y \):**
   \[
   4 + y = 20
   \]
   \[
   y = 20 - 4 = 16
   \]

4. **Verify the Solution:**

   - Check the total number of candies:
     \[
     x + y = 4 + 16 = 20 \quad \text{(Correct)}
     \]

   - Check the total cost:
     \[
     2x + 1.5y = 2(4) + 1.5(16) = 8 + 24 = 32 \quad \text{(Correct)}
     \]

5. **Final Answer:**

   The customer purchased 4 chocolates and 16 gummy bears.
