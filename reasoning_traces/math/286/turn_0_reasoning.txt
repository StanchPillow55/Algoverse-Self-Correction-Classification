==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine how many girls were not able to join the field trip given the conditions provided.

1. **Identify the total number of students and the number of boys:**
   - Total number of students assigned to the minibus = 18
   - Number of boys = 8

2. **Calculate the initial number of girls:**
   - Since the total number of students is the sum of boys and girls, we can find the number of girls by subtracting the number of boys from the total number of students:
     \[
     \text{Number of girls} = \text{Total number of students} - \text{Number of boys} = 18 - 8 = 10
     \]

3. **Understand the condition on the day of the field trip:**
   - On the day of the field trip, the number of girls and boys was the same. This means the number of girls who actually went on the trip was equal to the number of boys.

4. **Determine the number of girls who went on the trip:**
   - Since the number of boys is 8, and the number of girls who went on the trip is equal to the number of boys, the number of girls who went on the trip is also 8.

5. **Calculate the number of girls who did not join the trip:**
   - Initially, there were 10 girls. If 8 girls went on the trip, then the number of girls who did not join the trip is:
     \[
     \text{Number of girls not joining} = \text{Initial number of girls} - \text{Number of girls who went} = 10 - 8 = 2
     \]

Thus, the number of girls who were not able to join the field trip is \(\boxed{2}\).
