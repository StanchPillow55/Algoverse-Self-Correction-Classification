Question ID: 286
Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we start by identifying the total number of students assigned to the minibus and the number of boys.

1. **Total Students**: There are 18 students assigned to the minibus.
2. **Number of Boys**: Out of these, 8 students are boys.

Next, we can calculate the number of girls assigned to the minibus:

\[
\text{Number of Girls} = \text{Total Students} - \text{Number of Boys}
\]
\[
\text{Number of Girls} = 18 - 8 = 10
\]

So, there are 10 girls assigned to the minibus.

On the day of the field trip, it is stated that the number of girls and boys was the same. Since we already know there are 8 boys, we can conclude that the number of girls who actually joined the trip must also be 8.

Let \( x \) represent the number of girls who were not able to join the trip. The number of girls who did join the trip can be expressed as:

\[
\text{Number of Girls who joined} = \text{Total Girls} - x
\]
\[
8 = 10 - x
\]

Now, we can solve for \( x \):

\[
8 = 10 - x
\]
\[
x = 10 - 8
\]
\[
x = 2
\]

Thus, the number of girls who were not able to join the field trip is \( 2 \).

Finally, we can state the answer clearly:

**Final Answer**: 2 girls were not able to join the field trip.
