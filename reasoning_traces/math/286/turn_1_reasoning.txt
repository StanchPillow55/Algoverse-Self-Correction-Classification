Question ID: 286
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine how many girls did not join the field trip, given that the number of boys and girls on the trip ended up being equal.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Information:**
   - Total number of students assigned to the minibus: 18
   - Number of boys: 8

2. **Calculate the Initial Number of Girls:**
   - Since the total number of students is 18 and there are 8 boys, the number of girls initially assigned is:
     \[
     \text{Number of girls} = 18 - 8 = 10
     \]

3. **Condition on the Day of the Field Trip:**
   - On the day of the field trip, the number of girls and boys was the same.

4. **Determine the Number of Girls on the Trip:**
   - Let \( x \) be the number of girls who actually joined the trip.
   - According to the problem, the number of girls who joined the trip is equal to the number of boys:
     \[
     x = 8
     \]

5. **Calculate the Number of Girls Who Did Not Join:**
   - Initially, there were 10 girls assigned to the trip.
   - If 8 girls joined the trip, then the number of girls who did not join is:
     \[
     \text{Number of girls who did not join} = 10 - 8 = 2
     \]

6. **Conclusion:**
   - Therefore, 2 girls were not able to join the field trip.

Final Answer: 2 girls were not able to join the field trip.
