Question ID: 286
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine how many girls were not able to join the field trip. Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Identify the Total Number of Students:**
   - There were 18 students assigned to the minibus for the field trip.

2. **Determine the Number of Boys:**
   - Out of these 18 students, 8 were boys.

3. **Calculate the Initial Number of Girls:**
   - Since there are 18 students in total and 8 of them are boys, the number of girls initially assigned to the minibus is:
     \[
     \text{Number of girls} = 18 - 8 = 10
     \]

4. **Understand the Condition on the Day of the Field Trip:**
   - On the day of the field trip, the number of girls and boys was the same. This means the number of girls who actually went on the trip was equal to the number of boys, which is 8.

5. **Calculate the Number of Girls Who Went on the Trip:**
   - Since the number of girls who went on the trip is equal to the number of boys, 8 girls went on the trip.

6. **Determine How Many Girls Did Not Join the Trip:**
   - Initially, there were 10 girls assigned to the trip. If 8 girls went on the trip, then the number of girls who did not join is:
     \[
     \text{Number of girls not joining} = 10 - 8 = 2
     \]

Therefore, the number of girls who were not able to join the field trip is 2.

**Final Answer:**
2 girls were not able to join the field trip.
