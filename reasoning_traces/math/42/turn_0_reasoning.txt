==================================================

First, let's calculate the total number of bananas in the 6 piles with 9 hands each, and each hand having 14 bananas.

6 piles * 9 hands/pile * 14 bananas/hand = 756 bananas

Next, let's calculate the total number of bananas in the remaining 4 piles (10 total piles - 6 piles = 4 piles) with 12 hands each, and each hand having 9 bananas.

4 piles * 12 hands/pile * 9 bananas/hand = 432 bananas

Now, let's add these two amounts to find the total number of bananas.

756 bananas + 432 bananas = 1188 bananas

Finally, let's divide this total number of bananas by the number of monkeys to find out how many bananas each monkey gets.

1188 bananas / 12 monkeys = 99 bananas/monkey

So, each monkey would get 99 bananas.
