To solve the problem, we need to calculate the total number of bananas collected by the monkeys and then divide that total by the number of monkeys to find out how many bananas each monkey would get.

### Step 1: Calculate the number of bananas in the first 6 piles.

Each of the first 6 piles has:
- 9 hands per pile
- 14 bananas per hand

So, the total number of bananas in one pile is:
\[
\text{Bananas per pile} = \text{hands per pile} \times \text{bananas per hand} = 9 \times 14 = 126 \text{ bananas}
\]

Now, for 6 piles:
\[
\text{Total bananas in 6 piles} = 6 \times 126 = 756 \text{ bananas}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the number of bananas in the remaining 4 piles.

Each of the remaining 4 piles has:
- 12 hands per pile
- 9 bananas per hand

So, the total number of bananas in one of these piles is:
\[
\text{Bananas per pile} = \text{hands per pile} \times \text{bananas per hand} = 12 \times 9 = 108 \text{ bananas}
\]

Now, for 4 piles:
\[
\text{Total bananas in 4 piles} = 4 \times 108 = 432 \text{ bananas}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the total number of bananas collected.

Now, we add the total number of bananas from both sets of piles:
\[
\text{Total bananas} = \text{Total from 6 piles} + \text{Total from 4 piles} = 756 + 432 = 1188 \text{ bananas}
\]

### Step 4: Divide the total number of bananas by the number of monkeys.

There are 12 monkeys in total. To find out how many bananas each monkey would get, we divide the total number of bananas by the number of monkeys:
\[
\text{Bananas per monkey} = \frac{\text{Total bananas}}{\text{Number of monkeys}} = \frac{1188}{12}
\]

Calculating this gives:
\[
\text{Bananas per monkey} = 99
\]

### Final Answer

Each monkey would get **99 bananas**.
