==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to determine how many pieces of pie were taken by the guests. We can do this step by step.

1. **Calculate the total number of pieces of pie baked by Grandma Jones:**
   - Grandma baked 5 apple pies.
   - Each pie was cut into 8 pieces.
   - Therefore, the total number of pieces of pie is calculated as follows:
     \[
     \text{Total pieces} = \text{Number of pies} \times \text{Pieces per pie} = 5 \times 8 = 40
     \]

2. **Determine how many pieces of pie were left after the guests served themselves:**
   - At the end of the evening, there were 14 pieces of pie remaining.

3. **Calculate how many pieces of pie were taken by the guests:**
   - To find out how many pieces were taken, we subtract the number of pieces remaining from the total number of pieces.
   - The calculation is as follows:
     \[
     \text{Pieces taken} = \text{Total pieces} - \text{Pieces remaining} = 40 - 14 = 26
     \]

4. **Final answer:**
   - The number of pieces of pie taken by the guests is \( \boxed{26} \).
