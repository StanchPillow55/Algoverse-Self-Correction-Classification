==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample reasoning question 116," let's assume this is a placeholder for a specific math problem. Since no specific details are provided, I'll create a hypothetical problem and solve it step by step. Let's assume the problem is as follows:

**Problem:**  
A store sells apples at $2 each and oranges at $3 each. If a customer buys a total of 10 fruits consisting of apples and oranges and spends $25, how many apples and how many oranges did the customer buy?

**Solution:**

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( a \) be the number of apples.
   - Let \( o \) be the number of oranges.

2. **Set Up Equations:**
   - The total number of fruits is 10:  
     \[
     a + o = 10
     \]
   - The total cost is $25:  
     \[
     2a + 3o = 25
     \]

3. **Solve the System of Equations:**

   We have the following system of equations:
   \[
   \begin{align*}
   a + o &= 10 \quad \text{(Equation 1)} \\
   2a + 3o &= 25 \quad \text{(Equation 2)}
   \end{align*}
   \]

   **Substitution Method:**

   From Equation 1, express \( a \) in terms of \( o \):
   \[
   a = 10 - o
   \]

   Substitute \( a = 10 - o \) into Equation 2:
   \[
   2(10 - o) + 3o = 25
   \]

   Simplify and solve for \( o \):
   \[
   20 - 2o + 3o = 25
   \]
   \[
   20 + o = 25
   \]
   \[
   o = 25 - 20
   \]
   \[
   o = 5
   \]

   Substitute \( o = 5 \) back into the expression for \( a \):
   \[
   a = 10 - o = 10 - 5 = 5
   \]

4. **Verify the Solution:**

   Check the total number of fruits:
   \[
   a + o = 5 + 5 = 10
   \]

   Check the total cost:
   \[
   2a + 3o = 2(5) + 3(5) = 10 + 15 = 25
   \]

   Both conditions are satisfied.

5. **Final Answer:**

   The customer bought 5 apples and 5 oranges.
