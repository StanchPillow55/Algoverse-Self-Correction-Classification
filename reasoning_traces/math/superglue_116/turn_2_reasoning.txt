==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 116" refers to. Since the question itself is not provided, I'll assume it's a placeholder for a specific type of reasoning or math problem. Without specific details, I'll demonstrate a general approach to solving a typical math problem involving reasoning.

Let's assume "Sample reasoning question 116" is a logic puzzle or a math problem that requires step-by-step reasoning. I'll create a hypothetical problem and solve it:

**Hypothetical Problem:**

A farmer has chickens and cows on his farm. There are a total of 22 animals. If the total number of legs is 56, how many chickens and how many cows are there?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( c \) be the number of chickens.
   - Let \( w \) be the number of cows.

2. **Set Up Equations:**
   - We know the total number of animals is 22:
     \[
     c + w = 22
     \]
   - Chickens have 2 legs and cows have 4 legs. The total number of legs is 56:
     \[
     2c + 4w = 56
     \]

3. **Solve the System of Equations:**

   - From the first equation, express \( c \) in terms of \( w \):
     \[
     c = 22 - w
     \]

   - Substitute \( c = 22 - w \) into the second equation:
     \[
     2(22 - w) + 4w = 56
     \]

   - Simplify and solve for \( w \):
     \[
     44 - 2w + 4w = 56
     \]
     \[
     44 + 2w = 56
     \]
     \[
     2w = 56 - 44
     \]
     \[
     2w = 12
     \]
     \[
     w = 6
     \]

   - Substitute \( w = 6 \) back into the equation for \( c \):
     \[
     c = 22 - 6 = 16
     \]

4. **Verify the Solution:**

   - Check the total number of animals:
     \[
     c + w = 16 + 6 = 22
     \]
   - Check the total number of legs:
     \[
     2c + 4w = 2(16) + 4(6) = 32 + 24 = 56
     \]

Both conditions are satisfied, confirming our solution is correct.

**Final Answer:**

There are 16 chickens and 6 cows on the farm.
