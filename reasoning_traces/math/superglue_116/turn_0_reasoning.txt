==================================================

To solve the problem, I need more specific information about "Sample reasoning question 116." Since the problem statement is not provided, I'll demonstrate how to approach a generic math problem by explaining the steps involved in solving a typical math problem. 

Let's assume we have a math problem:

**Problem:** Solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).

**Step 1: Understand the Problem**

The equation given is a linear equation in one variable. Our goal is to find the value of \( x \) that makes the equation true.

**Step 2: Isolate the Variable**

To solve for \( x \), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We can do this by performing inverse operations.

1. **Subtract 3 from both sides**: 
   \[
   2x + 3 - 3 = 11 - 3
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   2x = 8
   \]

2. **Divide both sides by 2**:
   \[
   \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{8}{2}
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   x = 4
   \]

**Step 3: Verify the Solution**

Substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies the equation:
\[
2(4) + 3 = 11
\]
\[
8 + 3 = 11
\]
\[
11 = 11
\]
The left-hand side equals the right-hand side, confirming that \( x = 4 \) is the correct solution.

**Final Answer**

The solution to the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \) is \( x = 4 \).

If you have a specific problem or question number in mind, please provide the details, and I can work through that specific problem for you.
