==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample math problem 210" refers to. Since the problem statement is not provided, I'll assume this is a placeholder for a specific math problem. Let's create a hypothetical math problem based on the number 210 and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**

"Find the prime factorization of the number 210 and determine the number of divisors it has."

**Step 1: Prime Factorization**

To find the prime factorization of 210, we start by dividing it by the smallest prime number, which is 2.

1. \( 210 \div 2 = 105 \)

Since 105 is not divisible by 2, we move to the next smallest prime number, which is 3.

2. \( 105 \div 3 = 35 \)

Next, we check if 35 is divisible by 3. It is not, so we move to the next prime number, which is 5.

3. \( 35 \div 5 = 7 \)

Finally, 7 is a prime number, so we stop here.

Thus, the prime factorization of 210 is:
\[ 210 = 2 \times 3 \times 5 \times 7 \]

**Step 2: Determine the Number of Divisors**

To find the number of divisors of a number, we use its prime factorization. If a number \( n \) has the prime factorization \( n = p_1^{a_1} \times p_2^{a_2} \times \ldots \times p_k^{a_k} \), then the number of divisors \( D(n) \) is given by:
\[ D(n) = (a_1 + 1)(a_2 + 1) \ldots (a_k + 1) \]

For 210, the prime factorization is \( 2^1 \times 3^1 \times 5^1 \times 7^1 \). Therefore, each exponent \( a_i \) is 1.

So, the number of divisors is:
\[ D(210) = (1 + 1)(1 + 1)(1 + 1)(1 + 1) = 2 \times 2 \times 2 \times 2 = 16 \]

**Final Answer:**

The prime factorization of 210 is \( 2 \times 3 \times 5 \times 7 \), and it has 16 divisors.
