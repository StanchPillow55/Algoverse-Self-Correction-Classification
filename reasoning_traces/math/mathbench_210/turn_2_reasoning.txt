Question ID: mathbench_210
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we first need to understand what "Sample math problem 210" refers to. Since the problem itself is not explicitly stated, I'll assume it's a placeholder for a specific math problem. Without the actual problem, I can't provide a solution. However, I can guide you through a generic approach to solving math problems.

Let's assume "Sample math problem 210" is a typical algebra problem. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to approach it:

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - Read the problem carefully.
   - Identify what is being asked.
   - Note down any given information or equations.

2. **Devise a Plan:**
   - Determine the type of problem (e.g., linear equation, quadratic equation, etc.).
   - Choose an appropriate method to solve it (e.g., substitution, elimination, factoring).

3. **Carry Out the Plan:**
   - Execute the chosen method step by step.
   - Perform calculations carefully.
   - Keep track of units and signs.

4. **Check Your Work:**
   - Verify each step to ensure there are no errors.
   - Substitute your solution back into the original equation to check if it satisfies the problem.
   - Consider if the solution makes sense in the context of the problem.

5. **State the Final Answer:**
   - Clearly write down the final answer.
   - Include units if applicable.

Since I don't have the specific details of "Sample math problem 210," I can't provide a specific solution. If you provide the actual problem, I can work through it with you.
