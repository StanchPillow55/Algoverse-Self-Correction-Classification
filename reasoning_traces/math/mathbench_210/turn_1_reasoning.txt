==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 210," we need to first understand what the problem is asking. However, the problem statement "Sample math problem 210" is not specific enough to determine the exact nature of the problem. It seems like a placeholder or a reference to a specific problem that is not provided here.

To proceed, let's assume that "Sample math problem 210" refers to a generic math problem involving the number 210. Without additional context, I will create a math problem involving the number 210 and solve it step by step.

**Problem Assumption:**
Let's assume the problem is: "Find the prime factorization of 210."

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understanding Prime Factorization:**
   Prime factorization is the process of expressing a number as a product of its prime factors. A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.

2. **Start with the Smallest Prime:**
   Begin dividing the number 210 by the smallest prime number, which is 2.

   \[
   210 \div 2 = 105
   \]

   So, 2 is a prime factor of 210.

3. **Continue with the Next Smallest Prime:**
   Now, take the quotient 105 and divide it by the next smallest prime number, which is 3.

   \[
   105 \div 3 = 35
   \]

   So, 3 is another prime factor of 210.

4. **Proceed with the Next Prime:**
   Next, take the quotient 35 and divide it by the next smallest prime number, which is 5.

   \[
   35 \div 5 = 7
   \]

   So, 5 is another prime factor of 210.

5. **Check the Remaining Quotient:**
   Finally, we are left with 7, which is itself a prime number.

6. **Compile the Prime Factors:**
   The prime factors of 210 are 2, 3, 5, and 7. Therefore, the prime factorization of 210 is:

   \[
   210 = 2 \times 3 \times 5 \times 7
   \]

**Final Answer:**
The prime factorization of 210 is \(2 \times 3 \times 5 \times 7\).

This completes the solution to the assumed problem. If "Sample math problem 210" refers to a different problem, please provide additional details or context so that I can assist you further.
