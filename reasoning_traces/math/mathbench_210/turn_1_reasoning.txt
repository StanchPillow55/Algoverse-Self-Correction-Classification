==================================================

To solve the sample math problem 210, we need to first understand what the problem is asking. However, the problem statement "Sample math problem 210" is not specific enough for us to determine the exact nature of the problem. Therefore, I will assume a hypothetical math problem related to the number 210 and solve it.

Let's assume the problem is as follows:

**Problem:** Find the prime factorization of the number 210.

**Step-by-step Solution:**

1. **Identify if 210 is divisible by the smallest prime number, 2:**
   - A number is divisible by 2 if it is even. Since 210 is even, it is divisible by 2.
   - Divide 210 by 2: 
     \[
     210 \div 2 = 105
     \]
   - So, 210 = 2 × 105.

2. **Check if 105 is divisible by the next smallest prime number, 3:**
   - A number is divisible by 3 if the sum of its digits is divisible by 3. The sum of the digits of 105 is 1 + 0 + 5 = 6, which is divisible by 3.
   - Divide 105 by 3:
     \[
     105 \div 3 = 35
     \]
   - So, 105 = 3 × 35, and thus 210 = 2 × 3 × 35.

3. **Check if 35 is divisible by the next smallest prime number, 5:**
   - A number is divisible by 5 if it ends in 0 or 5. Since 35 ends in 5, it is divisible by 5.
   - Divide 35 by 5:
     \[
     35 \div 5 = 7
     \]
   - So, 35 = 5 × 7, and thus 210 = 2 × 3 × 5 × 7.

4. **Verify that 7 is a prime number:**
   - A prime number is only divisible by 1 and itself. Since 7 is only divisible by 1 and 7, it is a prime number.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The prime factorization of 210 is 2 × 3 × 5 × 7.

**Final Answer:**
The prime factorization of 210 is \(2 \times 3 \times 5 \times 7\).
