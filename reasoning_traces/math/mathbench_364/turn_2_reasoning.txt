Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the sample math problem 364, let's first understand what the problem is asking. Since the problem is not explicitly stated, I'll assume it's a generic math problem involving the number 364. Let's explore a few possibilities:

### Possibility 1: Prime Factorization
One common math problem is to find the prime factorization of a number. Let's find the prime factors of 364.

1. **Check divisibility by 2**: 
   - 364 is even, so it is divisible by 2.
   - \( 364 \div 2 = 182 \)

2. **Check divisibility of 182 by 2**:
   - 182 is also even, so it is divisible by 2.
   - \( 182 \div 2 = 91 \)

3. **Check divisibility of 91 by 2**:
   - 91 is odd, so it is not divisible by 2.

4. **Check divisibility by 3**:
   - Sum of digits of 91 is \( 9 + 1 = 10 \), which is not divisible by 3. So, 91 is not divisible by 3.

5. **Check divisibility by 5**:
   - 91 does not end in 0 or 5, so it is not divisible by 5.

6. **Check divisibility by 7**:
   - \( 91 \div 7 = 13 \), which is an integer. So, 91 is divisible by 7.

7. **Check divisibility of 13**:
   - 13 is a prime number.

Thus, the prime factorization of 364 is:
\[ 364 = 2^2 \times 7 \times 13 \]

### Possibility 2: Divisors of 364
Another common problem is to find all the divisors of a number. Using the prime factorization, we can find the divisors.

- Prime factorization: \( 364 = 2^2 \times 7 \times 13 \)
- To find the divisors, consider all combinations of the prime factors:
  - \( 2^0, 2^1, 2^2 \)
  - \( 7^0, 7^1 \)
  - \( 13^0, 13^1 \)

- Calculate the divisors:
  - \( 1, 2, 4 \) (from \( 2^0, 2^1, 2^2 \))
  - \( 1, 7 \) (from \( 7^0, 7^1 \))
  - \( 1, 13 \) (from \( 13^0, 13^1 \))

- Combine these to find all divisors:
  - \( 1, 2, 4, 7, 13, 14, 26, 28, 52, 91, 182, 364 \)

### Final Answer
Since the problem was not explicitly stated, I explored two common possibilities involving the number 364. Here are the results:

1. **Prime Factorization of 364**: \( 2^2 \times 7 \times 13 \)
2. **Divisors of 364**: \( 1, 2, 4, 7, 13, 14, 26, 28, 52, 91, 182, 364 \)

If you have a specific problem involving the number 364, please provide more details for a precise solution.
