==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 364," we first need to understand what the problem is asking. However, the problem statement "Sample math problem 364" is not specific and does not provide any details about what needs to be solved. Therefore, I will assume this is a placeholder for a specific math problem. 

Let's create a hypothetical math problem to solve. Suppose the problem is as follows:

**Problem:**
Calculate the sum of all even numbers between 1 and 364.

**Solution:**

To solve this problem, we need to identify all even numbers between 1 and 364 and then find their sum.

1. **Identify the even numbers:**
   - Even numbers are integers that are divisible by 2.
   - The smallest even number greater than 1 is 2.
   - The largest even number less than or equal to 364 is 364 itself.

2. **List the even numbers:**
   - The even numbers between 1 and 364 are: 2, 4, 6, ..., 364.

3. **Determine the sequence:**
   - This is an arithmetic sequence where the first term \( a_1 = 2 \) and the common difference \( d = 2 \).

4. **Find the number of terms in the sequence:**
   - The \( n \)-th term of an arithmetic sequence is given by the formula:
     \[
     a_n = a_1 + (n-1) \cdot d
     \]
   - We set \( a_n = 364 \) to find \( n \):
     \[
     364 = 2 + (n-1) \cdot 2
     \]
     \[
     364 = 2 + 2n - 2
     \]
     \[
     364 = 2n
     \]
     \[
     n = \frac{364}{2} = 182
     \]
   - There are 182 even numbers between 1 and 364.

5. **Calculate the sum of the sequence:**
   - The sum \( S_n \) of the first \( n \) terms of an arithmetic sequence is given by:
     \[
     S_n = \frac{n}{2} \cdot (a_1 + a_n)
     \]
   - Substituting the known values:
     \[
     S_{182} = \frac{182}{2} \cdot (2 + 364)
     \]
     \[
     S_{182} = 91 \cdot 366
     \]

6. **Perform the multiplication:**
   \[
   91 \times 366 = 91 \times (360 + 6) = 91 \times 360 + 91 \times 6
   \]
   \[
   91 \times 360 = 32760
   \]
   \[
   91 \times 6 = 546
   \]
   \[
   91 \times 366 = 32760 + 546 = 33306
   \]

Therefore, the sum of all even numbers between 1 and 364 is **33,306**.

**Final Answer:**
33,306
