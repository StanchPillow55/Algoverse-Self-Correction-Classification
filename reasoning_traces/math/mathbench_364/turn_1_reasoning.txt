==================================================

Certainly! Let's tackle the problem step by step. However, it seems like the problem statement is incomplete or unclear as "Sample math problem 364" doesn't provide specific details about what needs to be solved. To proceed, I'll assume a hypothetical math problem related to the number 364 and solve it. Let's say the problem is:

**Problem:** Find the prime factorization of 364.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Understanding Prime Factorization:**
   Prime factorization involves expressing a number as a product of its prime factors. A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.

2. **Start with the Smallest Prime:**
   Begin by dividing the number by the smallest prime number, which is 2, and continue dividing by 2 until the result is no longer divisible by 2.

   \[
   364 \div 2 = 182
   \]

   Since 182 is still even, divide by 2 again:

   \[
   182 \div 2 = 91
   \]

   Now, 91 is not divisible by 2 (as it is odd).

3. **Proceed to the Next Smallest Prime:**
   The next smallest prime number is 3. Check if 91 is divisible by 3 by summing its digits (9 + 1 = 10), which is not divisible by 3. So, 91 is not divisible by 3.

4. **Check Divisibility by 5:**
   A number is divisible by 5 if it ends in 0 or 5. Since 91 does not, it is not divisible by 5.

5. **Check Divisibility by 7:**
   To check divisibility by 7, perform the division:

   \[
   91 \div 7 = 13
   \]

   Since 13 is a prime number, we stop here.

6. **Compile the Prime Factors:**
   The prime factorization of 364 is the product of all the prime numbers we used in the division process:

   \[
   364 = 2 \times 2 \times 7 \times 13
   \]

   This can be written as:

   \[
   364 = 2^2 \times 7 \times 13
   \]

### Final Answer:

The prime factorization of 364 is \(2^2 \times 7 \times 13\).
