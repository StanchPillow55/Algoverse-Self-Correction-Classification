==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample math problem 364" refers to. Since the problem itself isn't specified, I'll create a sample math problem and solve it step by step.

**Sample Math Problem 364:**

**Problem:**  
A rectangle has a length that is 4 times its width. If the perimeter of the rectangle is 90 units, find the dimensions of the rectangle.

**Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We have a rectangle with a length \( L \) and a width \( W \).
   - The length is 4 times the width: \( L = 4W \).
   - The perimeter of the rectangle is 90 units.

2. **Recall the Formula for Perimeter:**
   - The perimeter \( P \) of a rectangle is given by the formula:
     \[
     P = 2L + 2W
     \]

3. **Substitute the Known Values:**
   - We know \( P = 90 \) and \( L = 4W \).
   - Substitute these into the perimeter formula:
     \[
     90 = 2(4W) + 2W
     \]

4. **Simplify the Equation:**
   - Simplify the terms:
     \[
     90 = 8W + 2W
     \]
   - Combine like terms:
     \[
     90 = 10W
     \]

5. **Solve for \( W \):**
   - Divide both sides by 10 to isolate \( W \):
     \[
     W = \frac{90}{10} = 9
     \]

6. **Find the Length \( L \):**
   - Use the relationship \( L = 4W \):
     \[
     L = 4 \times 9 = 36
     \]

7. **Verify the Solution:**
   - Check the perimeter with the found dimensions:
     \[
     P = 2L + 2W = 2(36) + 2(9) = 72 + 18 = 90
     \]
   - The calculated perimeter matches the given perimeter, confirming our solution is correct.

**Final Answer:**
- The dimensions of the rectangle are:
  - Width \( W = 9 \) units
  - Length \( L = 36 \) units
