Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand the context and the specific question being asked. However, the question "Sample reasoning question 476" doesn't provide any specific details or numerical data to work with. It seems like a placeholder or a reference to a specific problem that isn't fully described here.

Since there are no details provided, I will demonstrate how to approach a typical math problem by creating a hypothetical example and solving it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**

Let's say the problem is: "A train travels from City A to City B, a distance of 300 miles, at a constant speed. If the train takes 5 hours to complete the journey, what is the speed of the train in miles per hour?"

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We need to find the speed of the train.
   - We know the distance (300 miles) and the time taken (5 hours).

2. **Identify the Formula:**
   - The formula to find speed is: 
     \[
     \text{Speed} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Time}}
     \]

3. **Substitute the Known Values:**
   - Distance = 300 miles
   - Time = 5 hours
   - Substitute these values into the formula:
     \[
     \text{Speed} = \frac{300 \text{ miles}}{5 \text{ hours}}
     \]

4. **Perform the Calculation:**
   - Divide 300 by 5:
     \[
     \text{Speed} = 60 \text{ miles per hour}
     \]

5. **Verify the Solution:**
   - Check if the units are correct: We are looking for speed in miles per hour, which matches our calculation.
   - Ensure the calculation makes sense: If a train travels 60 miles per hour, in 5 hours it would cover \(60 \times 5 = 300\) miles, which matches the given distance.

6. **State the Final Answer:**
   - The speed of the train is 60 miles per hour.

This is an example of how to approach a math problem by breaking it down into understandable steps, using appropriate formulas, and verifying the solution. If you have a specific problem or more details, please provide them so I can assist you further.
