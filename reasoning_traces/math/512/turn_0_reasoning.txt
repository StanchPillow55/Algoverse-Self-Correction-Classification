==================================================

To determine how much water Hannah needs to drink, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total distance Hannah will run**:
   - Each lap is 0.25 km.
   - Hannah is required to run 8 laps.
   - Therefore, the total distance she runs can be calculated as:
     \[
     \text{Total distance} = \text{Number of laps} \times \text{Distance per lap} = 8 \text{ laps} \times 0.25 \text{ km/lap}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total distance} = 2 \text{ km}
     \]

2. **Determine the amount of water needed per kilometer**:
   - Hannah needs to drink 60 ml of water for each kilometer she runs.

3. **Calculate the total amount of water needed**:
   - Since she runs a total of 2 km, we can calculate the total water needed as follows:
     \[
     \text{Total water needed} = \text{Total distance} \times \text{Water per kilometer} = 2 \text{ km} \times 60 \text{ ml/km}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total water needed} = 120 \text{ ml}
     \]

Thus, the total amount of water Hannah needs to drink is **120 ml**.

Final answer: **120 ml**
