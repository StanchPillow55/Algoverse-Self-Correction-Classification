Question ID: 1136
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Understanding the problem**: We know that if Bob receives 2 dozen marbles, he will have a total of 60 marbles. We need to find out how many marbles Bob currently has.

2. **Calculating 2 dozen**: 
   \[
   2 \text{ dozen} = 2 \times 12 = 24 \text{ marbles}
   \]

3. **Setting up the equation**: Let \( x \) be the number of marbles Bob currently has. According to the problem, if he receives 24 more marbles, he will have 60 marbles. We can express this as:
   \[
   x + 24 = 60
   \]

4. **Solving for \( x \)**:
   \[
   x = 60 - 24
   \]
   \[
   x = 36
   \]
   So, Bob currently has 36 marbles.

5. **Finding out how many marbles Bob will have if he loses 10**: 
   If Bob loses 10 marbles, we can calculate the number of marbles he will have left as follows:
   \[
   36 - 10 = 26
   \]

6. **Final answer**: Therefore, if Bob loses 10 of the marbles he has, he will have 26 marbles left.

\[
\text{Final answer: } 26
\]
