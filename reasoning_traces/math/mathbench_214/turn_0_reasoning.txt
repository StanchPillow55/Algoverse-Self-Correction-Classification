Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, I need more specific information about "Sample math problem 214," as the description provided is not sufficient to identify the problem. However, I can guide you through a generic approach to solving math problems, which you can apply to the specific problem once you have the details.

### General Approach to Solving Math Problems

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - Read the problem carefully.
   - Identify what is being asked.
   - Determine what information is given and what needs to be found.

2. **Devise a Plan:**
   - Consider possible strategies to solve the problem, such as drawing a diagram, creating an equation, or breaking the problem into smaller parts.
   - Choose the most appropriate method based on the type of problem.

3. **Carry Out the Plan:**
   - Execute the chosen strategy step by step.
   - Perform calculations carefully and check each step for accuracy.

4. **Review/Check the Solution:**
   - Verify that the solution answers the question asked.
   - Check the calculations and logic used in the solution.
   - Consider whether there is another way to solve the problem or if the solution can be simplified.

5. **State the Final Answer:**
   - Clearly write the final answer, ensuring it is in the correct form and units (if applicable).

### Example Problem and Solution

Let's consider a simple example problem to illustrate this approach:

**Example Problem:**
Find the sum of the first 10 positive integers.

**Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We need to find the sum of the integers from 1 to 10.

2. **Devise a Plan:**
   - Use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series: \( S_n = \frac{n}{2} \times (a + l) \)
     - Where \( n \) is the number of terms, \( a \) is the first term, and \( l \) is the last term.

3. **Carry Out the Plan:**
   - Here, \( n = 10 \), \( a = 1 \), and \( l = 10 \).
   - Substitute these values into the formula: 
     \[
     S_{10} = \frac{10}{2} \times (1 + 10) = 5 \times 11 = 55
     \]

4. **Review/Check the Solution:**
   - Verify by adding the numbers directly: \( 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 10 = 55 \).
   - Both methods give the same result, confirming the solution is correct.

5. **State the Final Answer:**
   - The sum of the first 10 positive integers is 55.

If you provide the specific details of "Sample math problem 214," I can apply this structured approach to solve it.
