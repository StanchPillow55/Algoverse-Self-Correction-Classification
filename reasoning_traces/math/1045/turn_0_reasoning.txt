Let's denote the amount that the first person took as \( x \).

According to the problem:
- The second person took $80 more than the first person, so the amount the second person took can be expressed as \( x + 80 \).
- The third person took twice what the second person took, which can be expressed as \( 2(x + 80) \).

Now, we can set up an equation based on the total amount of money that was divided among the three people. The total amount is $1920, so we can write the equation as follows:

\[
x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = 1920
\]

Now, let's simplify the left side of the equation step by step:

1. Combine the terms:
   \[
   x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = x + x + 80 + 2x + 160
   \]
   This simplifies to:
   \[
   4x + 240
   \]

2. Now, we can rewrite the equation:
   \[
   4x + 240 = 1920
   \]

3. Next, we will isolate \( 4x \) by subtracting 240 from both sides:
   \[
   4x = 1920 - 240
   \]
   \[
   4x = 1680
   \]

4. Now, divide both sides by 4 to solve for \( x \):
   \[
   x = \frac{1680}{4} = 420
   \]

Thus, the share of the first person is \( x = 420 \).

To verify, we can calculate the amounts taken by the second and third persons:
- The second person took:
  \[
  x + 80 = 420 + 80 = 500
  \]
- The third person took:
  \[
  2(x + 80) = 2 \times 500 = 1000
  \]

Now, let's check if the total adds up to $1920:
\[
420 + 500 + 1000 = 1920
\]

Since the total is correct, we confirm that our calculations are accurate.

Therefore, the share of the first person is \(\boxed{420}\).
