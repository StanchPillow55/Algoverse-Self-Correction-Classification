Question ID: 1045
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

Let the amount the first person took be \( x \).

According to the problem:
- The second person took \( x + 80 \).
- The third person took \( 2 \times (x + 80) = 2x + 160 \).

Now, we can express the total amount divided among the three people as follows:

\[
x + (x + 80) + (2x + 160) = 1920
\]

Now, let's simplify the left side of the equation:

\[
x + x + 80 + 2x + 160 = 1920
\]

Combining like terms:

\[
4x + 240 = 1920
\]

Next, we will isolate \( x \) by subtracting 240 from both sides:

\[
4x = 1920 - 240
\]
\[
4x = 1680
\]

Now, divide both sides by 4 to solve for \( x \):

\[
x = \frac{1680}{4} = 420
\]

Thus, the share of the first person is \( \boxed{420} \).

To verify, we can calculate the shares of the second and third persons:
- The second person took \( 420 + 80 = 500 \).
- The third person took \( 2 \times 500 = 1000 \).

Now, let's check the total:

\[
420 + 500 + 1000 = 1920
\]

Since the total matches the original amount, our solution is confirmed. The share of the first person is indeed \( \boxed{420} \).
