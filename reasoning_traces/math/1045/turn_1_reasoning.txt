==================================================

Let the amount taken by the first person be \( x \).

According to the problem:
- The second person took \( x + 80 \).
- The third person took \( 2(x + 80) \).

Now, we can express the total amount taken by all three people as follows:

\[
x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = 1920
\]

Now, let's simplify the left side of the equation:

1. Combine like terms:
   \[
   x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = x + x + 80 + 2x + 160
   \]
   \[
   = 4x + 240
   \]

2. Set the equation equal to 1920:
   \[
   4x + 240 = 1920
   \]

3. Subtract 240 from both sides:
   \[
   4x = 1920 - 240
   \]
   \[
   4x = 1680
   \]

4. Divide both sides by 4 to solve for \( x \):
   \[
   x = \frac{1680}{4} = 420
   \]

Thus, the share of the first person is \( \boxed{420} \).

### Verification:
- First person's share: \( 420 \)
- Second person's share: \( 420 + 80 = 500 \)
- Third person's share: \( 2 \times 500 = 1000 \)

Now, let's check the total:
\[
420 + 500 + 1000 = 1920
\]

The calculations are correct, confirming that the share of the first person is indeed \( \boxed{420} \).
