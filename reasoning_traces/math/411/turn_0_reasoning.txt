==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine how many grandchildren Max has. Let's break down the information given and work through the problem step by step.

1. **Identify the number of Max's children:**
   - Max has 8 children.

2. **Determine the number of children each of Max's children has:**
   - We are told that each of Max's children has the same number of children as Max does, except for 2 of them who have 5 children each.

3. **Define variables:**
   - Let \( x \) be the number of children each of Max's children (except the 2 exceptions) has. Since Max has 8 children, and each of them (except 2) has the same number of children as Max, we assume \( x = 8 \).

4. **Calculate the number of grandchildren from the 6 children who have 8 children each:**
   - There are 6 children who each have 8 children.
   - The total number of grandchildren from these 6 children is:
     \[
     6 \times 8 = 48
     \]

5. **Calculate the number of grandchildren from the 2 children who have 5 children each:**
   - There are 2 children who each have 5 children.
   - The total number of grandchildren from these 2 children is:
     \[
     2 \times 5 = 10
     \]

6. **Add the number of grandchildren from both groups:**
   - Total number of grandchildren is the sum of the grandchildren from the two groups:
     \[
     48 + 10 = 58
     \]

Therefore, Max has a total of 58 grandchildren.

**Final Answer: 58**
