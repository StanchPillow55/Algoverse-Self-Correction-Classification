To solve the problem, we need to determine how many grandchildren Max has based on the information provided.

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - Max has 8 children.
   - Each of his children has the same number of children as Max does, except for 2 of his children who each have 5 children.

2. **Defining Variables**:
   - Let \( x \) be the number of children each of Max's children has (except for the 2 children who have 5 children each).

3. **Calculating the Total Number of Grandchildren**:
   - Max has 8 children in total.
   - Out of these 8 children, 2 have 5 children each. Therefore, the total number of grandchildren from these 2 children is:
     \[
     2 \times 5 = 10
     \]

4. **Finding the Number of Grandchildren from the Other Children**:
   - The remaining 6 children (since 8 total - 2 with 5 children = 6) each have \( x \) children.
   - Therefore, the total number of grandchildren from these 6 children is:
     \[
     6 \times x
     \]

5. **Finding the Value of \( x \)**:
   - According to the problem, each of Max's children (including the 6 children) has the same number of children as Max does. Since Max has 8 children, we can conclude that:
     \[
     x = 8
     \]

6. **Calculating the Total Number of Grandchildren**:
   - Now we can calculate the total number of grandchildren:
     - From the 2 children with 5 children each: 10 grandchildren.
     - From the 6 children, each having 8 children:
       \[
       6 \times 8 = 48
       \]

7. **Adding Both Contributions**:
   - The total number of grandchildren is:
     \[
     10 + 48 = 58
     \]

8. **Final Answer**:
   - Therefore, the total number of grandchildren Max has is:
     \[
     \boxed{58}
     \]
