==================================================

To find out how much Tim spent in total on fireworks, we will break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate the cost of the fireworks packs:**
   - The first pack of fireworks costs $400.
   - The second pack costs twice as much as the first pack. Therefore, the cost of the second pack is:
     \[
     2 \times 400 = 800 \text{ dollars}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total cost of both packs before the discount:**
   - To find the total cost of both packs, we add the cost of the first pack and the cost of the second pack:
     \[
     400 + 800 = 1200 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Calculate the discount on the total cost:**
   - Tim receives a 20% discount on the total cost of the fireworks packs. First, we need to calculate 20% of $1200:
     \[
     0.20 \times 1200 = 240 \text{ dollars}
     \]
   - Now, we subtract the discount from the total cost:
     \[
     1200 - 240 = 960 \text{ dollars}
     \]

4. **Add the cost of the finale firework:**
   - Tim also buys a finale firework that costs $150. We need to add this cost to the discounted total:
     \[
     960 + 150 = 1110 \text{ dollars}
     \]

5. **Final Calculation:**
   - Therefore, the total amount Tim spent on fireworks is:
     \[
     \boxed{1110} \text{ dollars}
     \]

In conclusion, Tim spent a total of $1110 on fireworks after applying the discount and including the cost of the finale firework.
