==================================================

To solve the problem effectively, we need to first understand the context and the specific question being asked. However, the given text "Sample reasoning question 177" does not provide any specific mathematical problem or context to work through. It seems like a placeholder or a reference to a specific question that is not included in the text provided.

To proceed, let's assume that "Sample reasoning question 177" refers to a typical math problem that requires logical reasoning and step-by-step calculations. Since no specific details are given, I'll create a hypothetical math problem and solve it step-by-step to demonstrate the process.

**Hypothetical Problem:**

"Calculate the sum of the first 10 positive integers."

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   We need to find the sum of the first 10 positive integers. These integers are 1, 2, 3, ..., 10.

2. **Identify the Formula:**
   The sum of the first \( n \) positive integers can be calculated using the formula:
   \[
   S = \frac{n(n + 1)}{2}
   \]
   where \( S \) is the sum and \( n \) is the number of terms.

3. **Substitute the Values:**
   Here, \( n = 10 \). Substitute 10 into the formula:
   \[
   S = \frac{10(10 + 1)}{2}
   \]

4. **Perform the Calculations:**
   \[
   S = \frac{10 \times 11}{2}
   \]
   \[
   S = \frac{110}{2}
   \]
   \[
   S = 55
   \]

5. **Verify the Result:**
   To ensure the calculation is correct, let's add the numbers manually:
   \[
   1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 10 = 55
   \]

6. **State the Final Answer:**
   The sum of the first 10 positive integers is 55.

This step-by-step approach demonstrates how to solve a typical math problem involving the sum of a sequence of numbers. If "Sample reasoning question 177" refers to a different problem, please provide the specific details or context so I can assist you accurately.
