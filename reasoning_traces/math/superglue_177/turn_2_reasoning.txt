==================================================

To solve the problem effectively, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 177" entails. However, since the problem statement is not provided, I will demonstrate how to approach a typical math problem by creating a hypothetical example and solving it step-by-step.

Let's assume the problem is as follows:

**Problem:**  
A rectangle has a length that is twice its width. If the perimeter of the rectangle is 36 units, find the dimensions of the rectangle.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We have a rectangle with a length (L) and width (W).
   - The length is twice the width: \( L = 2W \).
   - The perimeter of the rectangle is 36 units.

2. **Recall the Formula for Perimeter:**
   - The perimeter (P) of a rectangle is given by the formula:  
     \[ P = 2L + 2W \]

3. **Substitute the Given Values:**
   - We know the perimeter is 36 units, so:  
     \[ 2L + 2W = 36 \]

4. **Substitute the Relationship Between Length and Width:**
   - Since \( L = 2W \), substitute \( L \) in the perimeter equation:  
     \[ 2(2W) + 2W = 36 \]

5. **Simplify the Equation:**
   - Simplify the left side of the equation:  
     \[ 4W + 2W = 36 \]
   - Combine like terms:  
     \[ 6W = 36 \]

6. **Solve for Width (W):**
   - Divide both sides by 6 to solve for \( W \):  
     \[ W = \frac{36}{6} = 6 \]

7. **Find the Length (L):**
   - Use the relationship \( L = 2W \):  
     \[ L = 2 \times 6 = 12 \]

8. **Verify the Solution:**
   - Check if the dimensions satisfy the perimeter condition:  
     \[ 2L + 2W = 2(12) + 2(6) = 24 + 12 = 36 \]
   - The calculated perimeter matches the given perimeter, confirming our solution is correct.

**Final Answer:**
The dimensions of the rectangle are:
- Width = 6 units
- Length = 12 units

This approach demonstrates a structured method to solve a math problem by understanding the problem, applying relevant formulas, substituting known values, solving for unknowns, and verifying the solution.
