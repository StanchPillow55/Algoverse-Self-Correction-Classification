To solve this problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 177" entails. Since the problem statement is not specific, I'll assume it's a placeholder for a typical math problem. Let's create a hypothetical math problem and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**

A store sells two types of candies: chocolate and gummy bears. The price of a chocolate is $2, and the price of a gummy bear is $1.50. If a customer buys a total of 10 candies and spends $17, how many chocolates and gummy bears did the customer buy?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( x \) be the number of chocolates.
   - Let \( y \) be the number of gummy bears.

2. **Set Up Equations:**
   - From the problem, we know the total number of candies is 10:
     \[
     x + y = 10
     \]
   - We also know the total cost is $17:
     \[
     2x + 1.5y = 17
     \]

3. **Solve the System of Equations:**

   We have the system:
   \[
   \begin{cases} 
   x + y = 10 \\
   2x + 1.5y = 17 
   \end{cases}
   \]

   - From the first equation, express \( y \) in terms of \( x \):
     \[
     y = 10 - x
     \]

   - Substitute \( y = 10 - x \) into the second equation:
     \[
     2x + 1.5(10 - x) = 17
     \]

   - Distribute the 1.5:
     \[
     2x + 15 - 1.5x = 17
     \]

   - Combine like terms:
     \[
     0.5x + 15 = 17
     \]

   - Subtract 15 from both sides:
     \[
     0.5x = 2
     \]

   - Divide by 0.5 to solve for \( x \):
     \[
     x = \frac{2}{0.5} = 4
     \]

4. **Find \( y \):**

   - Substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the equation \( y = 10 - x \):
     \[
     y = 10 - 4 = 6
     \]

5. **Verify the Solution:**

   - Check the total number of candies:
     \[
     x + y = 4 + 6 = 10
     \]
     This is correct.

   - Check the total cost:
     \[
     2x + 1.5y = 2(4) + 1.5(6) = 8 + 9 = 17
     \]
     This is also correct.

**Final Answer:**

The customer bought 4 chocolates and 6 gummy bears.
