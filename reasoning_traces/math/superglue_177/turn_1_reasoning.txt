==================================================

To solve this problem, let's first clarify what "Sample reasoning question 177" might entail. Since no specific details are provided, I'll create a hypothetical math problem and solve it step by step. Let's assume the problem involves solving a quadratic equation, as this is a common type of math problem.

**Problem:**
Solve the quadratic equation \(2x^2 - 4x - 6 = 0\).

**Step 1: Identify the coefficients.**

The standard form of a quadratic equation is \(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\). For the given equation \(2x^2 - 4x - 6 = 0\), the coefficients are:
- \(a = 2\)
- \(b = -4\)
- \(c = -6\)

**Step 2: Use the quadratic formula.**

The quadratic formula is given by:
\[
x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
\]

**Step 3: Calculate the discriminant.**

The discriminant \(\Delta\) is given by \(b^2 - 4ac\). Let's calculate it:
\[
\Delta = (-4)^2 - 4 \cdot 2 \cdot (-6) = 16 + 48 = 64
\]

Since the discriminant is positive, there will be two distinct real roots.

**Step 4: Calculate the roots using the quadratic formula.**

Substitute the values of \(a\), \(b\), and \(\Delta\) into the quadratic formula:
\[
x = \frac{-(-4) \pm \sqrt{64}}{2 \cdot 2}
\]
\[
x = \frac{4 \pm 8}{4}
\]

**Step 5: Solve for the two possible values of \(x\).**

1. First root:
   \[
   x_1 = \frac{4 + 8}{4} = \frac{12}{4} = 3
   \]

2. Second root:
   \[
   x_2 = \frac{4 - 8}{4} = \frac{-4}{4} = -1
   \]

**Final Answer:**

The solutions to the quadratic equation \(2x^2 - 4x - 6 = 0\) are \(x = 3\) and \(x = -1\).
