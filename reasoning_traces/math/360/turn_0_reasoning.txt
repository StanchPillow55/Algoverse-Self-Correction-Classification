==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to determine how much oil Sonja used in her last batch of peanut butter, which weighed 20 ounces. We know the ratio of oil to peanuts is 2 ounces of oil for every 8 ounces of peanuts.

### Step 1: Understand the Ratio
The ratio of oil to peanuts is given as:
- 2 ounces of oil : 8 ounces of peanuts

This can be simplified to:
- 1 ounce of oil : 4 ounces of peanuts

### Step 2: Determine the Total Parts in the Ratio
In the simplified ratio, for every 1 ounce of oil, there are 4 ounces of peanuts. Therefore, the total parts in the ratio can be calculated as follows:
- Total parts = 1 (oil) + 4 (peanuts) = 5 parts

### Step 3: Calculate the Weight of Each Part
Since the total weight of the peanut butter is 20 ounces, we can find the weight of each part by dividing the total weight by the total number of parts:
\[
\text{Weight of each part} = \frac{\text{Total weight}}{\text{Total parts}} = \frac{20 \text{ ounces}}{5 \text{ parts}} = 4 \text{ ounces per part}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the Amount of Oil Used
Now that we know the weight of each part, we can find out how much oil Sonja used. Since the ratio indicates that there is 1 part oil:
\[
\text{Amount of oil} = 1 \text{ part} \times 4 \text{ ounces per part} = 4 \text{ ounces of oil}
\]

### Step 5: Conclusion
Thus, the amount of oil Sonja used in her last batch of peanut butter is:
\[
\boxed{4} \text{ ounces}
\]
