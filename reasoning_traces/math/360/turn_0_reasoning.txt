To solve this problem, we need to determine how much oil Sonja used in her last batch of peanut butter, which weighed 20 ounces in total. We know from the problem statement that Sonja uses a ratio of two ounces of oil for every eight ounces of peanuts.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Understand the Ratio**: The ratio of oil to peanuts is 2:8. This means for every 8 ounces of peanuts, 2 ounces of oil are used. We can simplify this ratio by dividing both numbers by 2, resulting in a simplified ratio of 1:4. This means for every 4 ounces of peanuts, 1 ounce of oil is used.

2. **Set Up the Equation**: Let \( x \) be the amount of oil used in ounces, and \( y \) be the amount of peanuts used in ounces. According to the problem, the total weight of the peanut butter is 20 ounces. Therefore, we have the equation:
   \[
   x + y = 20
   \]

3. **Use the Ratio**: From the simplified ratio of 1:4, we know that for every 4 ounces of peanuts, 1 ounce of oil is used. This can be expressed as:
   \[
   x = \frac{1}{4}y
   \]

4. **Substitute the Ratio into the Total Weight Equation**: Substitute \( x = \frac{1}{4}y \) into the equation \( x + y = 20 \):
   \[
   \frac{1}{4}y + y = 20
   \]

5. **Combine Like Terms**: Combine the terms on the left side:
   \[
   \frac{1}{4}y + \frac{4}{4}y = 20
   \]
   \[
   \frac{5}{4}y = 20
   \]

6. **Solve for \( y \)**: Multiply both sides by 4 to eliminate the fraction:
   \[
   5y = 80
   \]
   Divide both sides by 5:
   \[
   y = 16
   \]

   So, Sonja used 16 ounces of peanuts.

7. **Find the Amount of Oil**: Use the ratio \( x = \frac{1}{4}y \) to find \( x \):
   \[
   x = \frac{1}{4} \times 16 = 4
   \]

Thus, Sonja used 4 ounces of oil in her last batch of peanut butter.

**Final Answer**: Sonja used 4 ounces of oil.
