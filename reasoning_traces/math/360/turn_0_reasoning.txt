==================================================

To find the age of Carver's son, we can set up an equation based on the information given in the problem.

1. **Identify Carver's Age**: Carver is currently 45 years old.

2. **Understand the Relationship**: The problem states that Carver's age is 5 years less than twice the age of his son. We can express this relationship mathematically.

   Let \( s \) be the age of Carver's son. According to the problem, we can write the equation as:
   \[
   45 = 2s - 5
   \]

3. **Solve for \( s \)**: We need to isolate \( s \) in the equation. First, we can add 5 to both sides of the equation to eliminate the -5:
   \[
   45 + 5 = 2s
   \]
   \[
   50 = 2s
   \]

4. **Divide by 2**: Now, we divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( s \):
   \[
   s = \frac{50}{2}
   \]
   \[
   s = 25
   \]

5. **Conclusion**: Carver's son is 25 years old.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\text{Carver's son is } 25 \text{ years old.}
\]
