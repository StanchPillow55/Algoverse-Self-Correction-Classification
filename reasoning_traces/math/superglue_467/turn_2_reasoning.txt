==================================================

To solve the problem labeled "Sample reasoning question 467," we need to first understand what the problem is asking. However, the problem statement provided is incomplete and does not contain any specific mathematical question or context. Therefore, I will demonstrate a general approach to solving a typical math problem by creating a hypothetical problem and solving it step-by-step.

Let's assume the problem is as follows:

**Problem:**
Calculate the sum of all even numbers between 1 and 100, inclusive.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Identify the Even Numbers:**
   Even numbers are integers that are divisible by 2. Between 1 and 100, the even numbers are 2, 4, 6, ..., 100.

2. **Determine the Sequence:**
   The sequence of even numbers from 2 to 100 is an arithmetic sequence where the first term \( a_1 = 2 \) and the common difference \( d = 2 \).

3. **Find the Number of Terms:**
   To find the number of terms \( n \) in the sequence, use the formula for the \( n \)-th term of an arithmetic sequence:
   \[
   a_n = a_1 + (n-1) \cdot d
   \]
   Set \( a_n = 100 \) (the last term) and solve for \( n \):
   \[
   100 = 2 + (n-1) \cdot 2
   \]
   \[
   100 = 2 + 2n - 2
   \]
   \[
   100 = 2n
   \]
   \[
   n = 50
   \]
   So, there are 50 even numbers between 1 and 100.

4. **Calculate the Sum:**
   The sum \( S_n \) of an arithmetic sequence can be calculated using the formula:
   \[
   S_n = \frac{n}{2} \cdot (a_1 + a_n)
   \]
   Substitute the known values:
   \[
   S_{50} = \frac{50}{2} \cdot (2 + 100)
   \]
   \[
   S_{50} = 25 \cdot 102
   \]
   \[
   S_{50} = 2550
   \]

5. **Final Answer:**
   The sum of all even numbers between 1 and 100 is 2550.

This hypothetical problem demonstrates a typical approach to solving a math problem involving arithmetic sequences. If you have a specific problem labeled "Sample reasoning question 467," please provide the details, and I will be happy to solve it for you.
