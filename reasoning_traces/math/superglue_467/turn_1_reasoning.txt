==================================================

To solve a math problem effectively, it's important to understand the problem, identify what is being asked, and then systematically work through the solution. However, the question you've provided, "Sample reasoning question 467," does not contain any specific mathematical problem or context to solve. Therefore, I'll guide you through a general approach to solving a math problem using a hypothetical example.

Let's assume the problem is as follows:

**Problem:**  
Calculate the sum of all even numbers between 1 and 100.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We need to find the sum of all even numbers between 1 and 100.

2. **Identify the Even Numbers:**
   - Even numbers are integers divisible by 2. Between 1 and 100, the even numbers are 2, 4, 6, ..., 100.

3. **Determine the Sequence:**
   - The sequence of even numbers from 2 to 100 is an arithmetic sequence where the first term \(a_1 = 2\), the last term \(a_n = 100\), and the common difference \(d = 2\).

4. **Find the Number of Terms:**
   - The formula for the \(n\)-th term of an arithmetic sequence is:
     \[
     a_n = a_1 + (n-1) \cdot d
     \]
   - Plugging in the known values:
     \[
     100 = 2 + (n-1) \cdot 2
     \]
     \[
     100 = 2 + 2n - 2
     \]
     \[
     100 = 2n
     \]
     \[
     n = 50
     \]
   - There are 50 even numbers between 1 and 100.

5. **Calculate the Sum:**
   - The sum \(S_n\) of an arithmetic sequence is given by:
     \[
     S_n = \frac{n}{2} \cdot (a_1 + a_n)
     \]
   - Substituting the known values:
     \[
     S_{50} = \frac{50}{2} \cdot (2 + 100)
     \]
     \[
     S_{50} = 25 \cdot 102
     \]
     \[
     S_{50} = 2550
     \]

6. **Final Answer:**
   - The sum of all even numbers between 1 and 100 is 2550.

This step-by-step approach ensures that each part of the problem is addressed systematically, leading to a clear and correct solution. If you have a specific problem or need further assistance, please provide more details, and I'll be happy to help!
