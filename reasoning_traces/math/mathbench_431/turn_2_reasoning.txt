==================================================

To solve "Sample math problem 431," we need to first understand what the problem is asking. Since the problem itself isn't specified, I'll create a hypothetical math problem and solve it step by step. Let's assume the problem is as follows:

**Problem:**  
A rectangle has a length that is 3 times its width. If the perimeter of the rectangle is 48 units, find the dimensions of the rectangle.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We have a rectangle with a length (L) and a width (W).
   - The length is 3 times the width: \( L = 3W \).
   - The perimeter of the rectangle is 48 units.

2. **Recall the Formula for Perimeter of a Rectangle:**
   - The perimeter (P) of a rectangle is given by the formula:  
     \[ P = 2L + 2W \]

3. **Substitute the Known Values:**
   - We know \( P = 48 \) and \( L = 3W \).
   - Substitute these into the perimeter formula:  
     \[ 48 = 2(3W) + 2W \]

4. **Simplify the Equation:**
   - Distribute the 2 in the equation:  
     \[ 48 = 6W + 2W \]
   - Combine like terms:  
     \[ 48 = 8W \]

5. **Solve for W (Width):**
   - Divide both sides by 8 to solve for W:  
     \[ W = \frac{48}{8} = 6 \]

6. **Find the Length (L):**
   - Use the relationship \( L = 3W \):  
     \[ L = 3 \times 6 = 18 \]

7. **Verify the Solution:**
   - Check if the dimensions satisfy the perimeter condition:  
     \[ P = 2L + 2W = 2(18) + 2(6) = 36 + 12 = 48 \]
   - The calculated perimeter matches the given perimeter, confirming our solution is correct.

**Final Answer:**
The dimensions of the rectangle are:
- Width (W) = 6 units
- Length (L) = 18 units
