==================================================

To solve "Sample math problem 431," I need more specific information about the problem itself. Since the problem is not explicitly stated, I'll demonstrate how to approach a generic math problem step by step. Let's assume a typical algebra problem for demonstration purposes:

**Problem:** Solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).

**Step 1: Understand the Problem**

The equation given is \( 2x + 3 = 11 \). We need to find the value of \( x \) that makes this equation true.

**Step 2: Isolate the Variable**

To solve for \( x \), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We can do this by performing inverse operations.

1. **Subtract 3 from both sides**: This will help eliminate the constant term on the left side.

   \[
   2x + 3 - 3 = 11 - 3
   \]

   Simplifying both sides gives:

   \[
   2x = 8
   \]

2. **Divide both sides by 2**: This will solve for \( x \).

   \[
   \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{8}{2}
   \]

   Simplifying both sides gives:

   \[
   x = 4
   \]

**Step 3: Verify the Solution**

To ensure our solution is correct, substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation:

\[
2(4) + 3 = 11
\]

Calculate the left side:

\[
8 + 3 = 11
\]

Since both sides of the equation are equal, our solution \( x = 4 \) is verified.

**Final Answer**

The solution to the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \) is \( x = 4 \).

If you have a specific "Sample math problem 431" in mind, please provide the details, and I can solve that particular problem for you.
