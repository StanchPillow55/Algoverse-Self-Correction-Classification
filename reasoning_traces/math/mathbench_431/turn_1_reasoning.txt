Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample math problem 431" entails. Since the problem itself isn't provided, I'll create a hypothetical math problem and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem 431:**

*Calculate the value of \( x \) in the equation \( 3x + 7 = 22 \).*

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Understand the Equation:**
   The equation given is \( 3x + 7 = 22 \). This is a linear equation in one variable, \( x \).

2. **Isolate the Variable:**
   To solve for \( x \), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We start by eliminating the constant term on the left side.

   \[
   3x + 7 = 22
   \]

   Subtract 7 from both sides to remove the constant:

   \[
   3x + 7 - 7 = 22 - 7
   \]

   Simplifying both sides gives:

   \[
   3x = 15
   \]

3. **Solve for \( x \):**
   Now, we need to solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides by the coefficient of \( x \), which is 3.

   \[
   \frac{3x}{3} = \frac{15}{3}
   \]

   Simplifying both sides gives:

   \[
   x = 5
   \]

4. **Verify the Solution:**
   To ensure our solution is correct, we substitute \( x = 5 \) back into the original equation:

   \[
   3(5) + 7 = 22
   \]

   Calculate the left side:

   \[
   15 + 7 = 22
   \]

   Since both sides of the equation are equal, our solution is verified.

### Final Answer:

The value of \( x \) is \( 5 \).
