Question ID: 138
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To determine the total savings from the discounts on the milk and cereal, we will calculate the savings for each item separately and then combine them.

1. **Savings on Milk:**
   - Normal price of one gallon of whole milk: $3
   - Discounted price of one gallon of whole milk: $2
   - Savings per gallon: 
     \[
     3 - 2 = 1 \text{ dollar}
     \]
   - If you buy 3 gallons, the total savings on milk is:
     \[
     3 \text{ gallons} \times 1 \text{ dollar savings per gallon} = 3 \text{ dollars}
     \]

2. **Savings on Cereal:**
   - Assume the normal price of one box of cereal is \( P \) dollars.
   - Discount on one box of cereal: $1
   - Savings per box: 
     \[
     1 \text{ dollar}
     \]
   - If you buy 5 boxes, the total savings on cereal is:
     \[
     5 \text{ boxes} \times 1 \text{ dollar savings per box} = 5 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Total Savings:**
   - Combine the savings from both items:
     \[
     \text{Total savings} = \text{Savings on milk} + \text{Savings on cereal} = 3 \text{ dollars} + 5 \text{ dollars} = 8 \text{ dollars}
     \]

Thus, the total amount saved via discounts when buying 3 gallons of whole milk and 5 boxes of cereal is:

\[
\boxed{8 \text{ dollars}}
\]
