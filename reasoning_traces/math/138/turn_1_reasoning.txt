Question ID: 138
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To determine how much you will save via discounts when buying 3 gallons of whole milk and 5 boxes of cereal, we will first calculate the original prices and then the discounted prices.

1. **Calculate the original cost of the milk:**
   - The original price of one gallon of whole milk is $3.
   - For 3 gallons, the original cost is:
     \[
     3 \text{ gallons} \times 3 \text{ dollars/gallon} = 9 \text{ dollars}
     \]

2. **Calculate the discounted cost of the milk:**
   - The discounted price of one gallon of whole milk is $2.
   - For 3 gallons, the discounted cost is:
     \[
     3 \text{ gallons} \times 2 \text{ dollars/gallon} = 6 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Calculate the savings on the milk:**
   - The savings from buying the milk at a discount is:
     \[
     9 \text{ dollars (original)} - 6 \text{ dollars (discounted)} = 3 \text{ dollars}
     \]

4. **Calculate the original cost of the cereal:**
   - Letâ€™s assume the original price of one box of cereal is \( x \) dollars. Since the problem does not specify the original price, we will denote it as \( x \).
   - The total original cost for 5 boxes of cereal is:
     \[
     5 \text{ boxes} \times x \text{ dollars/box} = 5x \text{ dollars}
     \]

5. **Calculate the discounted cost of the cereal:**
   - The cereal is sold at a discount of $1 per box, so the discounted price per box is \( x - 1 \) dollars.
   - The total discounted cost for 5 boxes of cereal is:
     \[
     5 \text{ boxes} \times (x - 1) \text{ dollars/box} = 5(x - 1) = 5x - 5 \text{ dollars}
     \]

6. **Calculate the savings on the cereal:**
   - The savings from buying the cereal at a discount is:
     \[
     5x \text{ dollars (original)} - (5x - 5) \text{ dollars (discounted)} = 5 \text{ dollars}
     \]

7. **Calculate total savings:**
   - The total savings from both the milk and cereal is:
     \[
     3 \text{ dollars (milk)} + 5 \text{ dollars (cereal)} = 8 \text{ dollars}
     \]

Thus, the total amount you will save via discounts if you buy 3 gallons of whole milk and 5 boxes of cereal is:

\[
\boxed{8 \text{ dollars}}
\]
