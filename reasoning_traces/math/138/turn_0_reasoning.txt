==================================================

To determine how much you will save via discounts when buying 3 gallons of whole milk and 5 boxes of cereal, we will first calculate the original prices and the discounted prices for both items, then find the total savings.

### Step 1: Calculate the original and discounted prices for whole milk.

1. **Original price of one gallon of whole milk**: $3
2. **Discounted price of one gallon of whole milk**: $2

**Savings per gallon of whole milk**:
\[
\text{Savings per gallon} = \text{Original price} - \text{Discounted price} = 3 - 2 = 1 \text{ dollar}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the total savings for 3 gallons of whole milk.

**Total savings for 3 gallons**:
\[
\text{Total savings for milk} = \text{Savings per gallon} \times \text{Number of gallons} = 1 \times 3 = 3 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the original and discounted prices for cereal.

1. **Original price of one box of cereal**: Let's assume the original price is \( P \) dollars (since it is not provided).
2. **Discount on cereal**: $1

**Discounted price of one box of cereal**:
\[
\text{Discounted price} = P - 1
\]

**Savings per box of cereal**:
\[
\text{Savings per box} = 1 \text{ dollar}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the total savings for 5 boxes of cereal.

**Total savings for 5 boxes**:
\[
\text{Total savings for cereal} = \text{Savings per box} \times \text{Number of boxes} = 1 \times 5 = 5 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Step 5: Calculate the total savings from both items.

**Total savings**:
\[
\text{Total savings} = \text{Total savings for milk} + \text{Total savings for cereal} = 3 + 5 = 8 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Final Answer:
The total amount saved via discounts when buying 3 gallons of whole milk and 5 boxes of cereal is **$8**.
