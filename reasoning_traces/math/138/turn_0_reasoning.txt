To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total savings from the discounts on both the milk and the cereal.

**Step 1: Calculate the savings per gallon of milk.**

- The normal price of a gallon of whole milk is $3.
- The discounted price of a gallon of whole milk is $2.
- The savings per gallon of milk is the difference between the normal price and the discounted price:
  \[
  \text{Savings per gallon of milk} = 3 - 2 = 1 \text{ dollar}
  \]

**Step 2: Calculate the total savings for 3 gallons of milk.**

- Since the savings per gallon is $1, for 3 gallons, the total savings is:
  \[
  \text{Total savings for 3 gallons} = 3 \times 1 = 3 \text{ dollars}
  \]

**Step 3: Calculate the savings per box of cereal.**

- The discount on a box of cereal is $1.
- Therefore, the savings per box of cereal is $1.

**Step 4: Calculate the total savings for 5 boxes of cereal.**

- Since the savings per box is $1, for 5 boxes, the total savings is:
  \[
  \text{Total savings for 5 boxes} = 5 \times 1 = 5 \text{ dollars}
  \]

**Step 5: Calculate the total savings from both the milk and the cereal.**

- Add the total savings from the milk and the total savings from the cereal:
  \[
  \text{Total savings} = \text{Total savings for milk} + \text{Total savings for cereal} = 3 + 5 = 8 \text{ dollars}
  \]

Therefore, the total savings via discounts if you buy 3 gallons of whole milk and 5 boxes of cereal is \(\boxed{8}\) dollars.
