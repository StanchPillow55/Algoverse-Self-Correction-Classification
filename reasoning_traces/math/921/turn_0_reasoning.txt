==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to determine how many slices of bread Abby and Josh can eat together per day and then calculate how many days the loaf of bread will last based on that consumption.

1. **Determine Abby's daily consumption:**
   - Abby eats 2 slices of bread per day.

2. **Determine Josh's daily consumption:**
   - Josh can eat twice as much as Abby. Therefore, we calculate Josh's consumption as follows:
     \[
     \text{Josh's daily consumption} = 2 \times \text{Abby's daily consumption} = 2 \times 2 = 4 \text{ slices per day}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total daily consumption of both Abby and Josh:**
   - To find the total number of slices they eat together in one day, we add Abby's and Josh's daily consumption:
     \[
     \text{Total daily consumption} = \text{Abby's daily consumption} + \text{Josh's daily consumption} = 2 + 4 = 6 \text{ slices per day}
     \]

4. **Determine how many days the loaf of bread will last:**
   - The loaf of bread has a total of 24 slices. To find out how many days it will last, we divide the total number of slices by the total daily consumption:
     \[
     \text{Number of days the loaf lasts} = \frac{\text{Total slices}}{\text{Total daily consumption}} = \frac{24}{6} = 4 \text{ days}
     \]

Thus, the loaf of bread will last for **4 days**.

Final answer: **4 days**.
