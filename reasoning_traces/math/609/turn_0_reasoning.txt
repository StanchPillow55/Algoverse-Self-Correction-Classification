==================================================

To determine how many pounds of butter Juan will need to make croissants for a week, we can break the problem down into several steps.

1. **Determine the amount of butter needed for one dozen croissants**: 
   According to the problem, it takes \( \frac{1}{4} \) pound of butter to make 1 dozen croissants.

2. **Calculate the amount of butter needed for 4 dozen croissants**: 
   Since Juan wants to make 4 dozen croissants, we can calculate the total amount of butter needed for these 4 dozen by multiplying the amount of butter needed for 1 dozen by 4.

   \[
   \text{Butter for 4 dozen} = 4 \times \frac{1}{4} \text{ pound}
   \]

   Performing the multiplication:

   \[
   \text{Butter for 4 dozen} = \frac{4}{4} \text{ pound} = 1 \text{ pound}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total amount of butter needed for a week**: 
   Juan plans to make 4 dozen croissants each day for a week (7 days). Therefore, we need to multiply the amount of butter needed for 4 dozen by the number of days in a week.

   \[
   \text{Total butter for a week} = 1 \text{ pound/day} \times 7 \text{ days}
   \]

   Performing the multiplication:

   \[
   \text{Total butter for a week} = 7 \text{ pounds}
   \]

4. **Final Answer**: 
   Juan will need a total of 7 pounds of butter to make croissants for a week.

Thus, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{7} \text{ pounds}
\]
