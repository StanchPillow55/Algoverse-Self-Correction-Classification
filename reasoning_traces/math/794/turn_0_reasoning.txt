==================================================

To find the total number of lions in the enclosure, we need to consider the counts of female lions, male lions, and lion cubs.

1. **Count of Female Lions**: The problem states that there are 12 female lions.
   \[
   \text{Number of female lions} = 12
   \]

2. **Count of Male Lions**: The problem indicates that there are half as many male lions as female lions. Since there are 12 female lions, we calculate the number of male lions as follows:
   \[
   \text{Number of male lions} = \frac{12}{2} = 6
   \]

3. **Count of Lion Cubs**: The problem states that there are 14 lion cubs.
   \[
   \text{Number of lion cubs} = 14
   \]

4. **Total Count of Lions**: Now, we can find the total number of lions in the enclosure by adding the counts of female lions, male lions, and lion cubs together:
   \[
   \text{Total number of lions} = \text{Number of female lions} + \text{Number of male lions} + \text{Number of lion cubs}
   \]
   Substituting the values we calculated:
   \[
   \text{Total number of lions} = 12 + 6 + 14
   \]

5. **Performing the Addition**:
   \[
   12 + 6 = 18
   \]
   \[
   18 + 14 = 32
   \]

Thus, the total number of lions in the enclosure is:
\[
\boxed{32}
\]
