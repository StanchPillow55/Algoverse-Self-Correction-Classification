To solve the problem, we need to determine how long it takes Grandma to complete her entire 3-mile walk, given the information about her walking speeds on the beach and the sidewalk.

1. **Identify the distances and speeds:**
   - Grandma walks 2 miles on the beach and 1 mile on the sidewalk.
   - Let \( v \) be her walking speed on the beach (in miles per minute).
   - Therefore, her speed on the sidewalk is \( 2v \) (since she walks at twice the speed on the sidewalk).

2. **Calculate the time spent on the beach:**
   - We know that Grandma spends 40 minutes walking on the beach.
   - The distance she walks on the beach is 2 miles.
   - Using the formula for time, which is \( \text{time} = \frac{\text{distance}}{\text{speed}} \), we can express the time spent on the beach as:
     \[
     \text{Time on beach} = \frac{2 \text{ miles}}{v} = 40 \text{ minutes}
     \]
   - From this equation, we can solve for \( v \):
     \[
     2 = 40v \implies v = \frac{2}{40} = \frac{1}{20} \text{ miles per minute}
     \]

3. **Calculate the speed on the sidewalk:**
   - Since her speed on the sidewalk is \( 2v \):
     \[
     2v = 2 \times \frac{1}{20} = \frac{1}{10} \text{ miles per minute}
     \]

4. **Calculate the time spent on the sidewalk:**
   - The distance she walks on the sidewalk is 1 mile. Using the speed we calculated:
     \[
     \text{Time on sidewalk} = \frac{1 \text{ mile}}{\frac{1}{10} \text{ miles per minute}} = 1 \times 10 = 10 \text{ minutes}
     \]

5. **Calculate the total time for the entire walk:**
   - The total time for the entire 3-mile walk is the sum of the time spent on the beach and the time spent on the sidewalk:
     \[
     \text{Total time} = \text{Time on beach} + \text{Time on sidewalk} = 40 \text{ minutes} + 10 \text{ minutes} = 50 \text{ minutes}
     \]

Thus, the total time it takes Grandma to complete her entire 3-mile walk is \( \boxed{50} \) minutes.
