To solve the problem, we will first calculate the total number of letters in the words spelled by Craig and then determine how many letters Craig's brother has spelled. Finally, we will sum these totals to find the overall count of letters.

1. **Calculate the total number of letters Craig has spelled:**
   - Craig has spelled 20 words, each with 15 letters.
   - The total number of letters Craig has spelled can be calculated using the formula:
     \[
     \text{Total letters by Craig} = \text{Number of words} \times \text{Letters per word}
     \]
   - Substituting the values:
     \[
     \text{Total letters by Craig} = 20 \times 15 = 300
     \]

2. **Determine the total number of letters Craig's brother has spelled:**
   - According to the problem, Craig's brother has spelled words with a total count of letters that is 50 more than Craig's total.
   - Therefore, we can calculate the total letters spelled by Craig's brother as follows:
     \[
     \text{Total letters by Craig's brother} = \text{Total letters by Craig} + 50
     \]
   - Substituting Craig's total:
     \[
     \text{Total letters by Craig's brother} = 300 + 50 = 350
     \]

3. **Calculate the total number of letters spelled by both Craig and his brother:**
   - To find the total number of letters spelled by both, we add the total letters spelled by Craig and his brother:
     \[
     \text{Total letters} = \text{Total letters by Craig} + \text{Total letters by Craig's brother}
     \]
   - Substituting the totals:
     \[
     \text{Total letters} = 300 + 350 = 650
     \]

Thus, the total number of letters in the words they've spelled after the ten rounds is:

\[
\boxed{650}
\]
