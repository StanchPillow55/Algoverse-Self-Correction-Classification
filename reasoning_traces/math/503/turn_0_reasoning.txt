==================================================

To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step, using the information provided.

1. **Identify the width of the chair**: 
   The problem states that the chair is 3 feet wide. 
   \[
   \text{Width of the chair} = 3 \text{ feet}
   \]

2. **Determine the width of the rug**: 
   The rug is 5 feet wider than the chair. Therefore, we can calculate the width of the rug as follows:
   \[
   \text{Width of the rug} = \text{Width of the chair} + 5 \text{ feet}
   \]
   Substituting the width of the chair:
   \[
   \text{Width of the rug} = 3 \text{ feet} + 5 \text{ feet} = 8 \text{ feet}
   \]

3. **Calculate the length of the couch**: 
   The couch is described as being 2 feet longer than twice the width of the rug. We first need to find twice the width of the rug:
   \[
   2 \times \text{Width of the rug} = 2 \times 8 \text{ feet} = 16 \text{ feet}
   \]
   Now, we add 2 feet to this value to find the length of the couch:
   \[
   \text{Length of the couch} = 16 \text{ feet} + 2 \text{ feet} = 18 \text{ feet}
   \]

4. **Final answer**: 
   The length of the couch is:
   \[
   \boxed{18 \text{ feet}}
   \] 

This completes the problem, and we have determined that the couch is 18 feet long.
