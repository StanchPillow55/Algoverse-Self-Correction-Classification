==================================================

To solve a math problem effectively, it's important to follow a structured approach. However, the problem statement "Sample reasoning question 129" does not provide any specific mathematical question or context to work with. Therefore, I will guide you through a generic approach to solving a math problem, which you can apply to any specific problem once you have the details.

### Step-by-Step Approach to Solving Math Problems

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - Carefully read the problem statement.
   - Identify what is being asked.
   - Determine what information is given and what needs to be found.

2. **Devise a Plan:**
   - Consider possible strategies to solve the problem, such as:
     - Drawing a diagram.
     - Writing an equation.
     - Breaking the problem into smaller parts.
     - Looking for patterns.
     - Using logical reasoning.

3. **Carry Out the Plan:**
   - Execute the chosen strategy step by step.
   - Perform calculations carefully.
   - Keep track of units and ensure consistency.
   - Check each step for accuracy.

4. **Review and Reflect:**
   - Verify the solution by checking if it satisfies the conditions of the problem.
   - Consider alternative methods to solve the problem.
   - Reflect on the problem-solving process to improve future performance.

### Example Problem

Since no specific problem is given, let's consider a simple example:

**Problem:** Solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).

**Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We need to find the value of \( x \) that makes the equation true.

2. **Devise a Plan:**
   - Isolate \( x \) on one side of the equation.

3. **Carry Out the Plan:**
   - Start with the equation: \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).
   - Subtract 3 from both sides to isolate the term with \( x \):
     \[
     2x + 3 - 3 = 11 - 3
     \]
     \[
     2x = 8
     \]
   - Divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( x \):
     \[
     \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{8}{2}
     \]
     \[
     x = 4
     \]

4. **Review and Reflect:**
   - Substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation to verify:
     \[
     2(4) + 3 = 8 + 3 = 11
     \]
   - The solution satisfies the equation, confirming that \( x = 4 \) is correct.

**Final Answer:** \( x = 4 \)

Once you have a specific problem, you can apply this structured approach to find the solution. If you have a specific problem in mind, please provide the details, and I will be happy to assist you further.
