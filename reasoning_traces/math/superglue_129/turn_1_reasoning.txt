Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 129" entails. Since the problem statement is not provided, I'll demonstrate a general approach to solving a typical math reasoning problem. Let's assume this is a problem involving arithmetic or algebraic reasoning.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Identify the Problem Type:**
   - Since the problem is not explicitly stated, let's assume it involves solving an equation or finding a pattern.

2. **Assume a Sample Problem:**
   - Let's assume the problem is to solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).

3. **Isolate the Variable:**
   - To solve for \( x \), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation.
   - Start by subtracting 3 from both sides of the equation:
     \[
     2x + 3 - 3 = 11 - 3
     \]
     \[
     2x = 8
     \]

4. **Solve for the Variable:**
   - Next, divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( x \):
     \[
     \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{8}{2}
     \]
     \[
     x = 4
     \]

5. **Verify the Solution:**
   - Substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation to verify:
     \[
     2(4) + 3 = 11
     \]
     \[
     8 + 3 = 11
     \]
   - Since both sides of the equation are equal, the solution \( x = 4 \) is correct.

6. **State the Final Answer:**
   - The solution to the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \) is \( x = 4 \).

### Conclusion:
Since the original problem was not provided, I demonstrated a general approach to solving a simple algebraic equation. The final answer, based on the assumed problem, is \( x = 4 \). If you have a specific problem or additional details, please provide them for a more tailored solution.
