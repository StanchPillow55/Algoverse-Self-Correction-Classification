Question ID: superglue_40
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem effectively, let's first clarify the question. It seems like the question is labeled as "Sample reasoning question 40," but no specific mathematical problem is provided. Without a specific problem, it's challenging to provide a detailed solution. However, I can guide you through a general approach to solving a typical math problem.

Let's assume a hypothetical math problem to illustrate the process:

**Hypothetical Problem:**
"Calculate the area of a triangle with a base of 10 units and a height of 5 units."

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We need to find the area of a triangle.
   - We are given the base (\(b\)) of the triangle as 10 units.
   - We are given the height (\(h\)) of the triangle as 5 units.

2. **Recall the Formula for the Area of a Triangle:**
   - The formula to calculate the area (\(A\)) of a triangle is:
     \[
     A = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height}
     \]

3. **Substitute the Given Values into the Formula:**
   - Substitute \(b = 10\) and \(h = 5\) into the formula:
     \[
     A = \frac{1}{2} \times 10 \times 5
     \]

4. **Perform the Calculations:**
   - First, multiply the base and the height:
     \[
     10 \times 5 = 50
     \]
   - Then, multiply the result by \(\frac{1}{2}\):
     \[
     A = \frac{1}{2} \times 50 = 25
     \]

5. **State the Final Answer:**
   - The area of the triangle is 25 square units.

### Conclusion:
By following these steps, we have calculated the area of the triangle to be 25 square units. This approach can be applied to various math problems by understanding the problem, recalling relevant formulas, substituting known values, performing calculations, and stating the final answer.

If you have a specific problem labeled as "Sample reasoning question 40," please provide the details, and I will be happy to work through it step by step.
