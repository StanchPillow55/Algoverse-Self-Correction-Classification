==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample math problem 261" refers to. Since the problem statement is not explicitly provided, I'll create a hypothetical math problem and solve it step by step. Let's assume "Sample math problem 261" is the following:

**Problem:**  
Solve for \( x \) in the equation:  
\[ 3x + 5 = 2x - 7 \]

**Step-by-step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Equation:**
   The equation given is a linear equation in one variable, \( x \). Our goal is to find the value of \( x \) that makes the equation true.

2. **Isolate the Variable:**
   To solve for \( x \), we need to get all terms containing \( x \) on one side of the equation and constant terms on the other side.

   Start by subtracting \( 2x \) from both sides of the equation to get all \( x \)-terms on one side:
   \[
   3x + 5 - 2x = 2x - 7 - 2x
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   x + 5 = -7
   \]

3. **Solve for \( x \):**
   Next, subtract 5 from both sides to isolate \( x \):
   \[
   x + 5 - 5 = -7 - 5
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   x = -12
   \]

4. **Verify the Solution:**
   Substitute \( x = -12 \) back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies the equation:
   \[
   3(-12) + 5 = 2(-12) - 7
   \]
   Calculate each side:
   \[
   -36 + 5 = -24 - 7
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   -31 = -31
   \]
   Since both sides are equal, \( x = -12 \) is indeed the correct solution.

**Final Answer:**
The solution to the equation \( 3x + 5 = 2x - 7 \) is \( x = -12 \).
