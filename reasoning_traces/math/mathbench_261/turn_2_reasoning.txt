==================================================

To solve "Sample math problem 261," we first need to understand what the problem entails. Since the specific details of "Sample math problem 261" are not provided, I'll create a hypothetical math problem and solve it step by step. Let's assume the problem involves solving a quadratic equation, as this is a common type of math problem.

**Problem:** Solve the quadratic equation \(2x^2 - 4x - 6 = 0\).

**Step 1: Identify the coefficients.**

The given quadratic equation is in the standard form \(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\), where:
- \(a = 2\)
- \(b = -4\)
- \(c = -6\)

**Step 2: Use the quadratic formula.**

The quadratic formula is given by:
\[
x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
\]

**Step 3: Calculate the discriminant.**

The discriminant \(\Delta\) is calculated as:
\[
\Delta = b^2 - 4ac
\]
Substitute the values of \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\):
\[
\Delta = (-4)^2 - 4 \times 2 \times (-6) = 16 + 48 = 64
\]

**Step 4: Determine the roots using the quadratic formula.**

Since the discriminant is positive (\(\Delta = 64\)), there are two distinct real roots. Substitute the values into the quadratic formula:
\[
x = \frac{-(-4) \pm \sqrt{64}}{2 \times 2}
\]
\[
x = \frac{4 \pm 8}{4}
\]

**Step 5: Calculate the two possible values for \(x\).**

1. For the positive square root:
   \[
   x = \frac{4 + 8}{4} = \frac{12}{4} = 3
   \]

2. For the negative square root:
   \[
   x = \frac{4 - 8}{4} = \frac{-4}{4} = -1
   \]

**Final Answer:**

The solutions to the quadratic equation \(2x^2 - 4x - 6 = 0\) are \(x = 3\) and \(x = -1\).
