==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 408," we need to first understand what the problem is asking. However, the problem statement is incomplete as it only says "Sample math problem 408" without any specific details or question. 

Since there is no specific problem given, let's assume a hypothetical math problem related to the number 408 and solve it. 

Let's consider the problem: "Find the prime factorization of 408."

Step 1: Determine if 408 is divisible by the smallest prime number, which is 2.
- 408 is an even number, so it is divisible by 2.
- Divide 408 by 2: 
  \[
  408 \div 2 = 204
  \]

Step 2: Check if 204 is divisible by 2.
- 204 is also an even number, so it is divisible by 2.
- Divide 204 by 2:
  \[
  204 \div 2 = 102
  \]

Step 3: Check if 102 is divisible by 2.
- 102 is an even number, so it is divisible by 2.
- Divide 102 by 2:
  \[
  102 \div 2 = 51
  \]

Step 4: Check if 51 is divisible by 2.
- 51 is not an even number, so it is not divisible by 2.
- Move to the next smallest prime number, which is 3.

Step 5: Check if 51 is divisible by 3.
- To check divisibility by 3, sum the digits of 51: \(5 + 1 = 6\).
- 6 is divisible by 3, so 51 is divisible by 3.
- Divide 51 by 3:
  \[
  51 \div 3 = 17
  \]

Step 6: Check if 17 is a prime number.
- 17 is only divisible by 1 and itself, so it is a prime number.

Now, we have completely factored 408 into prime numbers. The prime factorization of 408 is:
\[
408 = 2^3 \times 3 \times 17
\]

Final Answer: The prime factorization of 408 is \(2^3 \times 3 \times 17\).
