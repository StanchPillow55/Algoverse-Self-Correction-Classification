==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 408," we need to first understand what the problem is asking. However, the problem statement "Sample math problem 408" is not specific enough for us to determine what the mathematical question is. 

Since the problem is not defined, let's consider a hypothetical math problem that involves the number 408. We will create a problem and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**
Find the prime factorization of the number 408.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   We need to express 408 as a product of prime numbers.

2. **Start with the Smallest Prime:**
   Begin with the smallest prime number, which is 2. Check if 408 is divisible by 2.

   \[
   408 \div 2 = 204
   \]

   Since 408 is even, it is divisible by 2. So, 2 is a factor.

3. **Continue Factoring 204:**
   Now, take 204 and divide by 2 again.

   \[
   204 \div 2 = 102
   \]

   204 is also even, so it is divisible by 2.

4. **Continue Factoring 102:**
   Divide 102 by 2.

   \[
   102 \div 2 = 51
   \]

   102 is even, so it is divisible by 2.

5. **Factor 51:**
   Now, 51 is not even, so it is not divisible by 2. Check the next smallest prime number, which is 3.

   \[
   51 \div 3 = 17
   \]

   51 is divisible by 3.

6. **Factor 17:**
   The number 17 is a prime number, so it cannot be factored further.

7. **Compile the Prime Factors:**
   We have divided 408 by 2 three times, by 3 once, and we are left with 17. Therefore, the prime factorization of 408 is:

   \[
   408 = 2^3 \times 3 \times 17
   \]

**Final Answer:**
The prime factorization of 408 is \(2^3 \times 3 \times 17\).

This solution demonstrates a complete reasoning process for finding the prime factorization of the number 408. If you have a specific math problem labeled as "Sample math problem 408," please provide the details, and I will be happy to solve it for you.
