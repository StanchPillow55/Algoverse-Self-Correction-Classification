Question ID: superglue_300
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 300" refers to. Since the question is not explicitly stated, I will assume that "Sample reasoning question 300" is a placeholder for a specific math problem. Without the actual content of the problem, I will demonstrate how to approach a typical math problem by solving a sample problem.

Let's assume the problem is as follows:

**Problem:** Calculate the sum of the first 300 positive integers.

To solve this problem, we can use the formula for the sum of the first \( n \) positive integers:

\[
S_n = \frac{n(n + 1)}{2}
\]

Where \( S_n \) is the sum of the first \( n \) positive integers.

**Step-by-step Solution:**

1. **Identify \( n \):** In this problem, \( n = 300 \).

2. **Apply the formula:**

   Substitute \( n = 300 \) into the formula:

   \[
   S_{300} = \frac{300(300 + 1)}{2}
   \]

3. **Calculate \( 300 + 1 \):**

   \[
   300 + 1 = 301
   \]

4. **Multiply 300 by 301:**

   \[
   300 \times 301 = 90300
   \]

5. **Divide the product by 2:**

   \[
   \frac{90300}{2} = 45150
   \]

Therefore, the sum of the first 300 positive integers is \( 45150 \).

**Final Answer:**

The sum of the first 300 positive integers is \( 45150 \).
