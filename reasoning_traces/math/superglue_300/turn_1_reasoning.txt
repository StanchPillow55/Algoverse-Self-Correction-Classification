Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 300" refers to. However, the problem statement is not clear or complete. It seems like there might be a misunderstanding or missing information in the question. Let's approach this step by step:

1. **Identify the Problem:**
   - The phrase "Sample reasoning question 300" does not provide any specific mathematical problem or context. It might be a placeholder or a reference to a specific problem in a textbook or a set of problems.

2. **Clarify the Question:**
   - Since there is no mathematical operation or context provided, we need to clarify what "300" refers to. It could be a number involved in a mathematical operation, a reference number for a problem, or something else entirely.

3. **Assumptions:**
   - Without additional information, we can make some assumptions to create a problem involving the number 300. For example, we could assume it is asking for a calculation involving the number 300, such as finding its factors, converting it to another unit, or solving an equation where 300 is a solution.

4. **Possible Interpretations:**
   - **Factorization:** Find the prime factors of 300.
   - **Equation:** Solve an equation where 300 is a solution.
   - **Conversion:** Convert 300 into another unit or format.

5. **Solve a Sample Problem:**
   - Let's choose to factorize 300 as a sample problem:
     - Start with the smallest prime number, 2. Since 300 is even, divide by 2:
       \[
       300 \div 2 = 150
       \]
     - 150 is also even, divide by 2 again:
       \[
       150 \div 2 = 75
       \]
     - 75 is not divisible by 2, move to the next prime number, 3. Sum of digits of 75 is 12, which is divisible by 3:
       \[
       75 \div 3 = 25
       \]
     - 25 is not divisible by 3, move to the next prime number, 5. Since 25 ends in 5, it is divisible by 5:
       \[
       25 \div 5 = 5
       \]
     - Finally, 5 is a prime number, and 5 divided by 5 is 1.

6. **Prime Factorization of 300:**
   - The prime factors of 300 are \(2^2 \times 3 \times 5^2\).

7. **Conclusion:**
   - Without a specific problem statement, we assumed a problem involving the number 300 and solved it by finding its prime factorization.

**Final Answer:**
The prime factorization of 300 is \(2^2 \times 3 \times 5^2\).

If this is not the intended problem, please provide additional context or details for a more accurate solution.
