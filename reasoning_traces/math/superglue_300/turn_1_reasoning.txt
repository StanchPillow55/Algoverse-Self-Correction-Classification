==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample reasoning question 300," we need to first understand what the problem is asking. However, the problem statement as given is not clear or complete. It seems to be a placeholder or a reference to a specific problem that is not fully described here.

Since the problem is not explicitly stated, let's consider a hypothetical scenario where "Sample reasoning question 300" refers to a typical math problem that involves reasoning and calculations. For the sake of this exercise, I'll create a sample math problem and solve it step by step.

### Hypothetical Problem:
**Problem:** A company produces 300 units of a product each day. Each unit costs $5 to produce and is sold for $8. Calculate the daily profit the company makes from selling all 300 units.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Determine the Cost of Production:**
   - The cost to produce one unit is $5.
   - The company produces 300 units each day.
   - Total daily production cost = Cost per unit × Number of units
   \[
   \text{Total daily production cost} = 5 \times 300 = 1500
   \]

2. **Determine the Revenue from Sales:**
   - Each unit is sold for $8.
   - The company sells 300 units each day.
   - Total daily revenue = Selling price per unit × Number of units sold
   \[
   \text{Total daily revenue} = 8 \times 300 = 2400
   \]

3. **Calculate the Daily Profit:**
   - Profit is calculated as the difference between total revenue and total production cost.
   \[
   \text{Daily profit} = \text{Total daily revenue} - \text{Total daily production cost}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Daily profit} = 2400 - 1500 = 900
   \]

### Final Answer:
The daily profit the company makes from selling all 300 units is $900.

This solution assumes a straightforward interpretation of a typical production and sales problem. If "Sample reasoning question 300" refers to a different or more specific problem, please provide additional details or context so that I can assist you more accurately.
