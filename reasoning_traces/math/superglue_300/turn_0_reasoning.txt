To solve the problem, we first need to understand what "Sample reasoning question 300" refers to. Since this is not a standard math problem statement, I'll assume it's a placeholder for a specific problem. Let's create a hypothetical math problem that involves reasoning and calculations. 

**Hypothetical Problem:**

A company produces two types of widgets: Type A and Type B. The production cost for Type A is $5 per unit, and for Type B, it is $7 per unit. The company sells Type A for $10 per unit and Type B for $12 per unit. Last month, the company produced a total of 300 widgets and made a total revenue of $3,200. How many of each type of widget did the company produce?

**Solution:**

Let's define:
- \( x \) as the number of Type A widgets produced.
- \( y \) as the number of Type B widgets produced.

We have two main pieces of information:
1. The total number of widgets produced is 300.
2. The total revenue from selling the widgets is $3,200.

From the first piece of information, we can write the equation:
\[ x + y = 300 \]

From the second piece of information, we can write the revenue equation:
\[ 10x + 12y = 3200 \]

Now, we have a system of linear equations:
1. \( x + y = 300 \)
2. \( 10x + 12y = 3200 \)

Let's solve this system using the substitution or elimination method. We'll use the substitution method here:

From equation 1, express \( y \) in terms of \( x \):
\[ y = 300 - x \]

Substitute \( y = 300 - x \) into equation 2:
\[ 10x + 12(300 - x) = 3200 \]

Distribute the 12:
\[ 10x + 3600 - 12x = 3200 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ -2x + 3600 = 3200 \]

Subtract 3600 from both sides:
\[ -2x = 3200 - 3600 \]
\[ -2x = -400 \]

Divide both sides by -2:
\[ x = 200 \]

Now that we have \( x = 200 \), substitute it back into the equation for \( y \):
\[ y = 300 - x \]
\[ y = 300 - 200 \]
\[ y = 100 \]

Therefore, the company produced 200 Type A widgets and 100 Type B widgets.

**Final Answer:**
The company produced 200 Type A widgets and 100 Type B widgets.
