Question ID: 852
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to calculate the total cost of purchasing 3 baskets of food, specifically 3 baskets of green food and red food, while considering the discount on the red food baskets.

### Step 1: Define the costs
- Cost of one basket of green food = $25
- Cost of one basket of red food = $18

### Step 2: Determine the number of baskets
We are buying a total of 3 baskets. However, the problem does not specify how many of each type of basket we are buying. For the sake of this calculation, let's assume we buy:
- 2 baskets of green food
- 1 basket of red food

### Step 3: Calculate the total cost without discounts
1. **Cost of green food baskets:**
   \[
   \text{Cost of 2 green baskets} = 2 \times 25 = 50
   \]

2. **Cost of red food baskets:**
   \[
   \text{Cost of 1 red basket} = 1 \times 18 = 18
   \]

3. **Total cost without discounts:**
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = \text{Cost of green baskets} + \text{Cost of red baskets} = 50 + 18 = 68
   \]

### Step 4: Apply the discount on red food baskets
The problem states that there is a discount of $2 for each basket of red food. Since we are buying 1 basket of red food, the discount will be:
\[
\text{Discount on red basket} = 1 \times 2 = 2
\]

### Step 5: Calculate the total cost after applying the discount
1. **Adjusted cost of red food baskets after discount:**
   \[
   \text{Adjusted cost of 1 red basket} = 18 - 2 = 16
   \]

2. **Recalculate the total cost with the adjusted red basket price:**
   \[
   \text{Total cost after discount} = \text{Cost of green baskets} + \text{Adjusted cost of red baskets} = 50 + 16 = 66
   \]

### Final Answer
The total amount you will have to pay after applying the discount is:
\[
\boxed{66}
\]
