To solve the problem, we need to calculate the total cost of purchasing 3 baskets of food, which includes both green and red food. We will also account for the discount applied to the red food baskets.

1. **Identify the costs of the baskets:**
   - Cost of one basket of green food = $25
   - Cost of one basket of red food = $18

2. **Determine the total number of baskets:**
   - We are buying a total of 3 baskets. We need to decide how many of each type of basket we will buy. For this example, let's assume we buy 2 baskets of green food and 1 basket of red food.

3. **Calculate the cost of the green food baskets:**
   - Number of green food baskets = 2
   - Total cost for green food = Number of green baskets × Cost per green basket
   \[
   \text{Total cost for green food} = 2 \times 25 = 50
   \]

4. **Calculate the cost of the red food baskets before discount:**
   - Number of red food baskets = 1
   - Total cost for red food = Number of red baskets × Cost per red basket
   \[
   \text{Total cost for red food} = 1 \times 18 = 18
   \]

5. **Apply the discount for the red food basket:**
   - Discount per red basket = $2
   - Total discount for red food = Number of red baskets × Discount per red basket
   \[
   \text{Total discount for red food} = 1 \times 2 = 2
   \]

6. **Calculate the final cost for the red food after applying the discount:**
   \[
   \text{Final cost for red food} = \text{Total cost for red food} - \text{Total discount for red food}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Final cost for red food} = 18 - 2 = 16
   \]

7. **Calculate the total cost for all baskets:**
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = \text{Total cost for green food} + \text{Final cost for red food}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = 50 + 16 = 66
   \]

Thus, the total amount you will have to pay for the 3 baskets of food is **$66**.

**Final Answer: $66**
