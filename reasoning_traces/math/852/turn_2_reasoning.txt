Question ID: 852
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to calculate the total cost of purchasing 3 baskets of food, specifically focusing on the costs of green and red food baskets, and applying the discount for the red food baskets.

### Step 1: Identify the costs of the food baskets
- Cost of one basket of green food = $25
- Cost of one basket of red food = $18

### Step 2: Determine the number of baskets to buy
We are buying a total of 3 baskets. However, the problem does not specify how many of each type of basket we are buying. For the sake of this calculation, let's assume we buy:
- 2 baskets of green food
- 1 basket of red food

### Step 3: Calculate the total cost without discounts
1. **Cost of green food baskets:**
   \[
   \text{Cost of 2 green baskets} = 2 \times 25 = 50
   \]

2. **Cost of red food baskets:**
   \[
   \text{Cost of 1 red basket} = 1 \times 18 = 18
   \]

3. **Total cost without discounts:**
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = \text{Cost of green baskets} + \text{Cost of red baskets} = 50 + 18 = 68
   \]

### Step 4: Apply the discount for the red food basket
The problem states that there is a $2 discount for each basket of red food. Since we are buying 1 basket of red food, we will apply the discount as follows:
\[
\text{Discount for red basket} = 2 \times 1 = 2
\]

### Step 5: Calculate the total cost after applying the discount
1. **Total cost after discount:**
   \[
   \text{Total cost after discount} = \text{Total cost} - \text{Discount} = 68 - 2 = 66
   \]

### Final Answer
The total amount you will have to pay after applying the discount for the red food basket is:
\[
\boxed{66}
\]
