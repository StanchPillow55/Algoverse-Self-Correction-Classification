==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to determine how many red blocks are in the tower given the total number of blocks and the quantities of blue and yellow blocks.

1. **Identify the number of blue blocks**: 
   The problem states that there are 4 blue blocks.

2. **Determine the number of yellow blocks**: 
   It is mentioned that there are twice as many yellow blocks as blue blocks. Therefore, the number of yellow blocks can be calculated as follows:
   \[
   \text{Number of yellow blocks} = 2 \times \text{Number of blue blocks} = 2 \times 4 = 8
   \]

3. **Calculate the total number of blue and yellow blocks**: 
   Now we can find the total number of blue and yellow blocks combined:
   \[
   \text{Total blue and yellow blocks} = \text{Number of blue blocks} + \text{Number of yellow blocks} = 4 + 8 = 12
   \]

4. **Use the total number of blocks to find the number of red blocks**: 
   The problem states that the total number of blocks in the tower is 32. We can set up the equation to find the number of red blocks:
   \[
   \text{Total blocks} = \text{Number of blue blocks} + \text{Number of yellow blocks} + \text{Number of red blocks}
   \]
   Substituting the known values:
   \[
   32 = 4 + 8 + \text{Number of red blocks}
   \]

5. **Simplify the equation**: 
   We already calculated that the total number of blue and yellow blocks is 12. Therefore, we can rewrite the equation as:
   \[
   32 = 12 + \text{Number of red blocks}
   \]

6. **Solve for the number of red blocks**: 
   To find the number of red blocks, we subtract 12 from both sides of the equation:
   \[
   \text{Number of red blocks} = 32 - 12 = 20
   \]

Thus, the number of red blocks in the tower is \( \boxed{20} \).
