==================================================

To find out how many pages Rene, Lulu, and Cherry have finished reading in total after 240 minutes, we will first determine how many pages each person reads in 240 minutes based on their reading rates.

### Step 1: Calculate the reading rate for each person

1. **Rene's reading rate:**
   - Rene reads 30 pages in 60 minutes.
   - To find his reading rate per minute, we divide the number of pages by the number of minutes:
     \[
     \text{Rene's rate} = \frac{30 \text{ pages}}{60 \text{ minutes}} = 0.5 \text{ pages per minute}
     \]

2. **Lulu's reading rate:**
   - Lulu reads 27 pages in 60 minutes.
   - Her reading rate per minute is:
     \[
     \text{Lulu's rate} = \frac{27 \text{ pages}}{60 \text{ minutes}} = 0.45 \text{ pages per minute}
     \]

3. **Cherry's reading rate:**
   - Cherry reads 25 pages in 60 minutes.
   - Her reading rate per minute is:
     \[
     \text{Cherry's rate} = \frac{25 \text{ pages}}{60 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{25}{60} = \frac{5}{12} \text{ pages per minute} \approx 0.4167 \text{ pages per minute}
     \]

### Step 2: Calculate the total pages read by each person in 240 minutes

1. **Pages read by Rene in 240 minutes:**
   - Using his rate of 0.5 pages per minute:
     \[
     \text{Pages read by Rene} = 0.5 \text{ pages/minute} \times 240 \text{ minutes} = 120 \text{ pages}
     \]

2. **Pages read by Lulu in 240 minutes:**
   - Using her rate of 0.45 pages per minute:
     \[
     \text{Pages read by Lulu} = 0.45 \text{ pages/minute} \times 240 \text{ minutes} = 108 \text{ pages}
     \]

3. **Pages read by Cherry in 240 minutes:**
   - Using her rate of \(\frac{5}{12}\) pages per minute:
     \[
     \text{Pages read by Cherry} = \frac{5}{12} \text{ pages/minute} \times 240 \text{ minutes} = \frac{5 \times 240}{12} = \frac{1200}{12} = 100 \text{ pages}
     \]

### Step 3: Calculate the total pages read by all three

Now we will sum the pages read by each person:
\[
\text{Total pages} = \text{Pages read by Rene} + \text{Pages read by Lulu} + \text{Pages read by Cherry}
\]
\[
\text{Total pages} = 120 + 108 + 100 = 328 \text{ pages}
\]

### Final Answer
The total number of pages they have finished reading in 240 minutes is \( \boxed{328} \).
