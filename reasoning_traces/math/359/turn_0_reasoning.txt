To solve the problem, we will break it down into several steps:

1. **Determine how much money Billy has after buying candy.**
2. **Calculate how much he spends on gumballs.**
3. **Find out how much change he has left after buying gumballs.**
4. **Calculate how many pounds of candy he bought.**

### Step 1: Determine how much money Billy has after buying candy.

Billy starts with $10. The cost of candy is $1.50 per pound. Let \( x \) be the number of pounds of candy he buys. The total cost of the candy can be expressed as:

\[
\text{Cost of candy} = 1.5x
\]

After buying the candy, the amount of money Billy has left (his change) is:

\[
\text{Change} = 10 - 1.5x
\]

### Step 2: Calculate how much he spends on gumballs.

Billy takes half of his change to buy gumballs. The amount he spends on gumballs is:

\[
\text{Amount spent on gumballs} = \frac{1}{2} \times (10 - 1.5x)
\]

The cost of each gumball is $0.05. If he buys 40 gumballs, the total cost for the gumballs is:

\[
\text{Cost of gumballs} = 0.05 \times 40 = 2
\]

### Step 3: Set up the equation for the change after buying gumballs.

We know that the amount he spends on gumballs is equal to half of his change:

\[
\frac{1}{2} \times (10 - 1.5x) = 2
\]

Now, we will solve for \( x \).

### Step 4: Solve the equation.

First, multiply both sides of the equation by 2 to eliminate the fraction:

\[
10 - 1.5x = 4
\]

Next, isolate \( x \):

\[
10 - 4 = 1.5x
\]
\[
6 = 1.5x
\]

Now, divide both sides by 1.5:

\[
x = \frac{6}{1.5} = 4
\]

### Final Answer

Billy bought **4 pounds of candy**.
