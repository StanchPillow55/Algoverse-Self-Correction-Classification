To solve this problem, we need to determine how many pages each person has read in 240 minutes and then sum these amounts to find the total number of pages read by all three individuals.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Determine the reading rate per minute for each person:**

   - **Rene's reading rate:**
     Rene can read 30 pages in 60 minutes. Therefore, Rene's reading rate is:
     \[
     \text{Rene's rate} = \frac{30 \text{ pages}}{60 \text{ minutes}} = 0.5 \text{ pages per minute}
     \]

   - **Lulu's reading rate:**
     Lulu can read 27 pages in 60 minutes. Therefore, Lulu's reading rate is:
     \[
     \text{Lulu's rate} = \frac{27 \text{ pages}}{60 \text{ minutes}} = 0.45 \text{ pages per minute}
     \]

   - **Cherry's reading rate:**
     Cherry can read 25 pages in 60 minutes. Therefore, Cherry's reading rate is:
     \[
     \text{Cherry's rate} = \frac{25 \text{ pages}}{60 \text{ minutes}} \approx 0.4167 \text{ pages per minute}
     \]

2. **Calculate the number of pages each person reads in 240 minutes:**

   - **Pages read by Rene in 240 minutes:**
     \[
     \text{Pages read by Rene} = 0.5 \text{ pages/minute} \times 240 \text{ minutes} = 120 \text{ pages}
     \]

   - **Pages read by Lulu in 240 minutes:**
     \[
     \text{Pages read by Lulu} = 0.45 \text{ pages/minute} \times 240 \text{ minutes} = 108 \text{ pages}
     \]

   - **Pages read by Cherry in 240 minutes:**
     \[
     \text{Pages read by Cherry} = 0.4167 \text{ pages/minute} \times 240 \text{ minutes} \approx 100 \text{ pages}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total number of pages read by all three:**

   \[
   \text{Total pages read} = 120 \text{ pages (Rene)} + 108 \text{ pages (Lulu)} + 100 \text{ pages (Cherry)} = 328 \text{ pages}
   \]

### Final Answer:
The total number of pages read by Rene, Lulu, and Cherry in 240 minutes is 328 pages.
