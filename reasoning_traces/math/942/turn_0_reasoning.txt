To determine how much Patty's Plumbing charged for the job, we need to break down the charges into three components: the service call fee, the labor cost, and the cost of parts.

1. **Service Call Fee**: Patty's Plumbing charges a flat fee of $40 for visiting a house. This is a fixed cost that applies to every job.

   \[
   \text{Service Call Fee} = 40
   \]

2. **Labor Cost**: The labor cost is $35 per hour, or part thereof. The job took 2.25 hours. Since the charge is for "per hour, or part thereof," we need to round up the 2.25 hours to the next whole hour. This means we will charge for 3 hours of labor.

   \[
   \text{Labor Hours Charged} = \lceil 2.25 \rceil = 3 \text{ hours}
   \]

   Now, we calculate the labor cost:

   \[
   \text{Labor Cost} = \text{Labor Hours Charged} \times \text{Cost per Hour} = 3 \times 35 = 105
   \]

3. **Parts Cost**: The cost of parts used for the job is given as $60.

   \[
   \text{Parts Cost} = 60
   \]

Now, we can sum all these components to find the total charge:

\[
\text{Total Charge} = \text{Service Call Fee} + \text{Labor Cost} + \text{Parts Cost}
\]

Substituting in the values we calculated:

\[
\text{Total Charge} = 40 + 105 + 60
\]

Calculating this gives:

\[
\text{Total Charge} = 205
\]

Thus, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{205}
\] 

Patty charged a total of $205 for the job.
