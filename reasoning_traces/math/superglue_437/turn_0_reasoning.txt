==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 437" entails. Since the question is not specified, I'll create a hypothetical math problem and solve it step by step.

Let's assume the problem is as follows:

**Problem:**
A rectangle has a length that is 3 times its width. If the perimeter of the rectangle is 48 units, what are the dimensions of the rectangle?

**Step-by-step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We need to find the length and width of a rectangle.
   - We know the relationship between the length and width: Length = 3 × Width.
   - We also know the perimeter of the rectangle is 48 units.

2. **Set Up the Equations:**
   - The formula for the perimeter \( P \) of a rectangle is given by:
     \[
     P = 2 \times (\text{Length} + \text{Width})
     \]
   - Substitute the given perimeter:
     \[
     48 = 2 \times (\text{Length} + \text{Width})
     \]
   - Substitute the relationship between length and width (Length = 3 × Width):
     \[
     48 = 2 \times (3W + W)
     \]

3. **Simplify the Equation:**
   - Combine like terms inside the parentheses:
     \[
     48 = 2 \times (4W)
     \]
   - Simplify further:
     \[
     48 = 8W
     \]

4. **Solve for Width:**
   - Divide both sides by 8 to isolate \( W \):
     \[
     W = \frac{48}{8} = 6
     \]

5. **Find the Length:**
   - Use the relationship Length = 3 × Width:
     \[
     \text{Length} = 3 \times 6 = 18
     \]

6. **Verify the Solution:**
   - Check if the calculated dimensions satisfy the perimeter condition:
     \[
     P = 2 \times (\text{Length} + \text{Width}) = 2 \times (18 + 6) = 2 \times 24 = 48
     \]
   - The calculated perimeter matches the given perimeter, confirming our solution is correct.

**Final Answer:**
The dimensions of the rectangle are:
- Width = 6 units
- Length = 18 units
