==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to follow a structured approach. However, the problem statement "Sample reasoning question 437" is not clear or specific enough to provide a direct solution. It seems like a placeholder or reference to a specific problem that might be detailed elsewhere. Without additional information or context, it's challenging to provide a complete solution.

However, I can guide you on how to approach a typical math problem using logical reasoning and step-by-step calculations. Let's assume a generic math problem and work through it:

**Example Problem:**
Solve for \( x \) in the equation: \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We need to find the value of \( x \) that satisfies the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).

2. **Isolate the Variable:**
   - To solve for \( x \), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We start by eliminating the constant term on the side with \( x \).

3. **Subtract 3 from Both Sides:**
   \[
   2x + 3 - 3 = 11 - 3
   \]
   \[
   2x = 8
   \]

4. **Divide Both Sides by 2:**
   \[
   \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{8}{2}
   \]
   \[
   x = 4
   \]

5. **Verify the Solution:**
   - Substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies the equation.
   \[
   2(4) + 3 = 11
   \]
   \[
   8 + 3 = 11
   \]
   - The left side equals the right side, confirming that \( x = 4 \) is the correct solution.

6. **State the Final Answer:**
   - The solution to the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \) is \( x = 4 \).
