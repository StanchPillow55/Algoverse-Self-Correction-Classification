==================================================

To solve the problem effectively, I need to first understand the context and details of "Sample reasoning question 437." However, since the problem statement is not provided, I will demonstrate a general approach to solving a typical math problem by outlining the steps and reasoning involved.

### Step-by-Step Approach:

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - Carefully read the problem statement to identify what is being asked.
   - Determine the type of problem (e.g., algebra, geometry, calculus, etc.).
   - Identify the known variables and the unknowns that need to be solved.

2. **Devise a Plan:**
   - Choose an appropriate strategy to solve the problem. This could involve setting up equations, drawing diagrams, or using specific formulas.
   - Consider if there are any theorems or properties that can be applied.

3. **Carry Out the Plan:**
   - Execute the chosen strategy step by step.
   - Perform calculations carefully, showing all work to avoid errors.
   - Simplify expressions and solve equations as needed.

4. **Check Your Work:**
   - Verify each step to ensure no mistakes were made.
   - Check if the solution makes sense in the context of the problem.
   - If possible, substitute the solution back into the original problem to confirm its validity.

5. **State the Final Answer:**
   - Clearly present the final answer, ensuring it addresses the question asked.
   - Include units of measurement if applicable.

### Example Problem:

**Problem Statement:**
Solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).

**Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We need to find the value of \( x \) that satisfies the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).

2. **Devise a Plan:**
   - Isolate \( x \) by performing algebraic operations.

3. **Carry Out the Plan:**
   - Start with the equation: \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).
   - Subtract 3 from both sides to isolate the term with \( x \):
     \[
     2x + 3 - 3 = 11 - 3
     \]
     \[
     2x = 8
     \]
   - Divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( x \):
     \[
     \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{8}{2}
     \]
     \[
     x = 4
     \]

4. **Check Your Work:**
   - Substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation to verify:
     \[
     2(4) + 3 = 8 + 3 = 11
     \]
   - The left side equals the right side, confirming the solution is correct.

5. **State the Final Answer:**
   - The solution to the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \) is \( x = 4 \).

This structured approach ensures a thorough understanding and accurate solution to math problems. If you have a specific problem labeled "Sample reasoning question 437," please provide the details, and I can apply this method to solve it.
