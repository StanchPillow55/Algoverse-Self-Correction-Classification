==================================================

To solve the problem, I need more information about "Sample math problem 182." Since the problem statement is not provided, I will demonstrate how to approach a generic math problem step by step. If you have a specific problem in mind, please provide the details.

Let's consider a sample math problem:

**Problem:** Solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).

**Step 1: Understand the problem.**
We need to find the value of \( x \) that satisfies the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).

**Step 2: Isolate the variable.**
To solve for \( x \), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We can do this by performing inverse operations.

**Step 3: Perform inverse operations.**
- Subtract 3 from both sides of the equation to eliminate the constant term on the left side:
  \[
  2x + 3 - 3 = 11 - 3
  \]
  Simplifying both sides gives:
  \[
  2x = 8
  \]

- Divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( x \):
  \[
  \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{8}{2}
  \]
  Simplifying both sides gives:
  \[
  x = 4
  \]

**Step 4: Verify the solution.**
Substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies the equation:
\[
2(4) + 3 = 11
\]
Simplifying the left side gives:
\[
8 + 3 = 11
\]
Since both sides of the equation are equal, \( x = 4 \) is indeed the correct solution.

**Final Answer:**
The solution to the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \) is \( x = 4 \).
