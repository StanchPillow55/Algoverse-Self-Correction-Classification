==================================================

To solve the problem effectively, I need to first understand what "Sample math problem 182" refers to. Since I don't have access to specific problem sets or external databases, I'll assume this is a placeholder for a typical math problem. Let's create a hypothetical math problem and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Math Problem 182:**

*Calculate the area of a triangle with a base of 10 units and a height of 5 units.*

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We need to find the area of a triangle.
   - The formula for the area of a triangle is: 
     \[
     \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height}
     \]
   - Given values:
     - Base (\(b\)) = 10 units
     - Height (\(h\)) = 5 units

2. **Substitute the Values into the Formula:**
   - Plug the given values into the area formula:
     \[
     \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times 10 \times 5
     \]

3. **Perform the Calculations:**
   - First, multiply the base and the height:
     \[
     10 \times 5 = 50
     \]
   - Then, multiply by \(\frac{1}{2}\):
     \[
     \frac{1}{2} \times 50 = 25
     \]

4. **State the Final Answer:**
   - The area of the triangle is 25 square units.

### Conclusion:

By following the steps and applying the formula for the area of a triangle, we determined that the area is 25 square units. This solution demonstrates a clear understanding of the problem and the application of mathematical principles to reach the final answer.
