==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to calculate the total time taken by all eight runners to finish the race.

1. **Identify the finishing times of the runners**:
   - The first five runners finish the race in **8 hours**.
   - The remaining three runners finish the race **2 hours later** than the first five. Therefore, their finishing time is:
     \[
     8 \text{ hours} + 2 \text{ hours} = 10 \text{ hours}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total time for each group of runners**:
   - For the first five runners, since they all finish in 8 hours, the total time taken by these runners is:
     \[
     5 \text{ runners} \times 8 \text{ hours} = 40 \text{ runner-hours}
     \]
   - For the last three runners, since they all finish in 10 hours, the total time taken by these runners is:
     \[
     3 \text{ runners} \times 10 \text{ hours} = 30 \text{ runner-hours}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total time for all eight runners**:
   - Now, we add the total time taken by both groups of runners:
     \[
     40 \text{ runner-hours} + 30 \text{ runner-hours} = 70 \text{ runner-hours}
     \]

4. **Final answer**:
   - The total time taken by all eight runners to finish the race is **70 runner-hours**.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\text{Total time taken by the eight runners} = 70 \text{ runner-hours}
\]
