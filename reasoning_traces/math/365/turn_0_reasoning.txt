==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total time taken by all eight runners to finish the race.

1. **Identify the groups of runners:**
   - The first group consists of the first five runners.
   - The second group consists of the remaining three runners.

2. **Determine the time taken by each group:**
   - The first five runners finish the race in 8 hours.
   - The remaining three runners finish the race 2 hours later than the first group. Therefore, they finish in \(8 + 2 = 10\) hours.

3. **Calculate the total time for each group:**
   - For the first group of five runners, each runner takes 8 hours. Therefore, the total time for this group is:
     \[
     5 \text{ runners} \times 8 \text{ hours/runner} = 40 \text{ hours}
     \]

   - For the second group of three runners, each runner takes 10 hours. Therefore, the total time for this group is:
     \[
     3 \text{ runners} \times 10 \text{ hours/runner} = 30 \text{ hours}
     \]

4. **Calculate the total time for all runners:**
   - Add the total time for both groups:
     \[
     40 \text{ hours} + 30 \text{ hours} = 70 \text{ hours}
     \]

Thus, the total time the eight runners took to finish the race is 70 hours.

**Final Answer: 70 hours**
