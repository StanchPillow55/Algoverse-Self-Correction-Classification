==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine how long it takes both Emery and Serena to read the book individually, and then calculate the average number of days they take to read the book.

### Step 1: Determine Emery's Reading Time
We are given that Emery can read the book in 20 days.

### Step 2: Determine Serena's Reading Time
We are told that Emery reads five times as fast as Serena. This means that if Serena takes \( x \) days to read the book, Emery would take \( \frac{x}{5} \) days to read the same book. Since we know Emery takes 20 days, we can set up the equation:

\[
\frac{x}{5} = 20
\]

To solve for \( x \), multiply both sides by 5:

\[
x = 20 \times 5 = 100
\]

So, Serena takes 100 days to read the book.

### Step 3: Calculate the Average Number of Days
Now that we know Emery takes 20 days and Serena takes 100 days, we can calculate the average number of days they take to read the book. The average is given by the formula:

\[
\text{Average} = \frac{\text{Emery's days} + \text{Serena's days}}{2}
\]

Substitute the known values:

\[
\text{Average} = \frac{20 + 100}{2} = \frac{120}{2} = 60
\]

### Final Answer
The average number of days Emery and Serena take to read the book is 60 days.
