To solve the problem, we need to determine how long it takes both Emery and Serena to read the book and then find the average time they take.

1. **Understanding the Reading Speeds**:
   - Let \( S \) be the speed at which Serena reads (in books per day).
   - Since Emery reads five times as fast as Serena, her reading speed is \( 5S \).

2. **Time Taken by Emery**:
   - We know that Emery takes 20 days to read the book. 
   - The relationship between speed, time, and work (in this case, reading a book) is given by:
     \[
     \text{Work} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time}
     \]
   - For Emery, the work done (reading one book) can be expressed as:
     \[
     1 = 5S \times 20
     \]
   - Simplifying this equation gives:
     \[
     1 = 100S
     \]
   - Therefore, we can solve for \( S \):
     \[
     S = \frac{1}{100} \text{ books per day}
     \]

3. **Time Taken by Serena**:
   - Now we can find out how long it takes Serena to read the book. Using her speed \( S \):
     \[
     \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Work}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{1}{S} = \frac{1}{\frac{1}{100}} = 100 \text{ days}
     \]

4. **Calculating the Average Time**:
   - Now we have the time taken by both:
     - Emery: 20 days
     - Serena: 100 days
   - The average time taken by both can be calculated using the formula for the average:
     \[
     \text{Average} = \frac{\text{Time}_1 + \text{Time}_2}{2} = \frac{20 + 100}{2} = \frac{120}{2} = 60 \text{ days}
     \]

5. **Final Answer**:
   - The average number of days the two take to read the book is \( \boxed{60} \).
