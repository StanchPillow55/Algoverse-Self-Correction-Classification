To find out how much Mark pays for everything related to the purchase of the fleet of cars, we need to break down the costs step by step.

1. **Calculate the total cost of the cars before tax and registration:**
   - Each car costs $20,000.
   - Mark buys 12 cars.
   \[
   \text{Total cost of cars} = \text{Number of cars} \times \text{Cost per car} = 12 \times 20,000 = 240,000
   \]

2. **Calculate the tax on the cars:**
   - The tax rate is 10%.
   - To find the tax amount, we calculate 10% of the total cost of the cars.
   \[
   \text{Tax amount} = \text{Total cost of cars} \times \text{Tax rate} = 240,000 \times 0.10 = 24,000
   \]

3. **Calculate the total cost of registration:**
   - The registration cost is $1,000 per car.
   - For 12 cars, the total registration cost is:
   \[
   \text{Total registration cost} = \text{Number of cars} \times \text{Registration cost per car} = 12 \times 1,000 = 12,000
   \]

4. **Calculate the total amount paid for everything:**
   - To find the total amount paid, we need to add the total cost of the cars, the tax amount, and the total registration cost.
   \[
   \text{Total amount paid} = \text{Total cost of cars} + \text{Tax amount} + \text{Total registration cost}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total amount paid} = 240,000 + 24,000 + 12,000 = 276,000
   \]

Thus, the final amount that Mark pays for everything is \(\boxed{276,000}\).
