==================================================

To find out how much Mark pays for everything related to the purchase of the fleet of cars, we will break down the problem into several steps:

1. **Calculate the total cost of the cars before tax and registration.**
   - Mark buys 12 cars, and each car costs $20,000.
   - Total cost of the cars = Number of cars × Cost per car
   \[
   \text{Total cost of cars} = 12 \times 20,000 = 240,000
   \]

2. **Calculate the tax on the cars.**
   - The tax rate is 10%.
   - Tax amount = Total cost of cars × Tax rate
   \[
   \text{Tax amount} = 240,000 \times 0.10 = 24,000
   \]

3. **Calculate the total cost of registration for the cars.**
   - The registration fee is $1,000 per car.
   - Total registration cost = Number of cars × Registration fee per car
   \[
   \text{Total registration cost} = 12 \times 1,000 = 12,000
   \]

4. **Calculate the total amount paid for everything.**
   - Total amount paid = Total cost of cars + Tax amount + Total registration cost
   \[
   \text{Total amount paid} = 240,000 + 24,000 + 12,000
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total amount paid} = 240,000 + 24,000 = 264,000
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total amount paid} = 264,000 + 12,000 = 276,000
   \]

Thus, the total amount Mark pays for everything is **$276,000**.

Final answer: **$276,000**.
