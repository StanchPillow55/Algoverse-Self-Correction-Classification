==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine how long it takes both Emery and Serena to read the book individually, and then find the average number of days they take to read the book.

### Step 1: Determine Emery's Reading Speed

We are given that Emery can read the book in 20 days. Therefore, Emery's reading speed is:

\[
\text{Emery's speed} = \frac{1 \text{ book}}{20 \text{ days}}
\]

### Step 2: Determine Serena's Reading Speed

We are also told that Emery reads five times as fast as Serena. Let \( x \) be the number of days it takes Serena to read the book. Therefore, Serena's reading speed is:

\[
\text{Serena's speed} = \frac{1 \text{ book}}{x \text{ days}}
\]

Since Emery reads five times as fast as Serena, we have:

\[
\frac{1}{20} = 5 \times \frac{1}{x}
\]

### Step 3: Solve for \( x \)

To find \( x \), solve the equation:

\[
\frac{1}{20} = \frac{5}{x}
\]

Cross-multiply to solve for \( x \):

\[
x = 5 \times 20
\]

\[
x = 100
\]

So, it takes Serena 100 days to read the book.

### Step 4: Calculate the Average Number of Days

Now, we need to find the average number of days it takes both Emery and Serena to read the book. The average is calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Average days} = \frac{\text{Emery's days} + \text{Serena's days}}{2}
\]

Substitute the known values:

\[
\text{Average days} = \frac{20 + 100}{2}
\]

\[
\text{Average days} = \frac{120}{2}
\]

\[
\text{Average days} = 60
\]

### Final Answer

The average number of days it takes Emery and Serena to read the book is 60 days.
