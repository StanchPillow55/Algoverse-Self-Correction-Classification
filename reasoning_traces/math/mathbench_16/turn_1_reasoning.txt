==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 16," we need to first understand what the problem is asking. Since the problem statement is not fully provided, I'll assume a hypothetical math problem involving the number 16. Let's consider a common type of math problem involving the number 16, such as finding the square root, factoring, or solving an equation.

Let's assume the problem is to find the square root of 16.

**Step 1: Understand the Problem**

The problem asks us to find the square root of 16. The square root of a number \( x \) is a number \( y \) such that \( y^2 = x \).

**Step 2: Recall the Definition**

The square root of 16 is a number \( y \) such that:

\[ y^2 = 16 \]

**Step 3: Solve the Equation**

To find \( y \), we need to determine what number squared equals 16. We can test small integer values:

- \( 1^2 = 1 \)
- \( 2^2 = 4 \)
- \( 3^2 = 9 \)
- \( 4^2 = 16 \)

When \( y = 4 \), \( y^2 = 16 \). Therefore, one solution is \( y = 4 \).

**Step 4: Consider Negative Solutions**

Since squaring a negative number also results in a positive number, we should also consider:

- \( (-4)^2 = 16 \)

Thus, \( y = -4 \) is also a solution.

**Step 5: State the Final Answer**

The square root of 16 has two solutions: \( y = 4 \) and \( y = -4 \).

Therefore, the final answer is:

The square roots of 16 are \( 4 \) and \( -4 \).
