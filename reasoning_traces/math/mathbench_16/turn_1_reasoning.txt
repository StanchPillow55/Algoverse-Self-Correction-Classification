==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 16," we need to first understand what the problem is asking. Since the problem is not explicitly stated, I'll assume a generic math problem involving the number 16. Let's consider a problem involving basic arithmetic operations with the number 16.

**Problem:** What is the result when you add 16 to the product of 16 and 3?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Identify the operations involved:**
   - We need to find the product of 16 and 3.
   - Then, we add 16 to this product.

2. **Calculate the product of 16 and 3:**
   \[
   16 \times 3 = 48
   \]
   Here, we multiply 16 by 3 to get 48.

3. **Add 16 to the product:**
   \[
   48 + 16 = 64
   \]
   We take the product from the previous step, which is 48, and add 16 to it.

4. **Final Answer:**
   The result of adding 16 to the product of 16 and 3 is 64.

Therefore, the final answer is 64.
