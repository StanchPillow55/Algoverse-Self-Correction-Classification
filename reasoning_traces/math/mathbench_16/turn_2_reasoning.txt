==================================================

To solve the problem, we first need to understand what "Sample math problem 16" refers to. Since no specific details are provided about the problem, I'll create a sample math problem labeled as "16" and solve it step by step.

**Sample Math Problem 16:**

Calculate the value of \( x \) in the equation:

\[ 4x + 7 = 31 \]

**Step-by-step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Equation:**
   The equation given is a linear equation in one variable, \( x \). Our goal is to solve for \( x \).

2. **Isolate the Variable:**
   To solve for \( x \), we need to get \( x \) by itself on one side of the equation. We start by eliminating the constant term on the left side of the equation.

   \[
   4x + 7 = 31
   \]

   Subtract 7 from both sides to remove the constant term from the left side:

   \[
   4x + 7 - 7 = 31 - 7
   \]

   Simplifying both sides gives:

   \[
   4x = 24
   \]

3. **Solve for \( x \):**
   Now, we need to solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides of the equation by 4, which is the coefficient of \( x \).

   \[
   \frac{4x}{4} = \frac{24}{4}
   \]

   Simplifying both sides gives:

   \[
   x = 6
   \]

4. **Verify the Solution:**
   To ensure our solution is correct, we substitute \( x = 6 \) back into the original equation and check if both sides are equal.

   Substitute \( x = 6 \) into the original equation:

   \[
   4(6) + 7 = 31
   \]

   Calculate the left side:

   \[
   24 + 7 = 31
   \]

   Since both sides are equal, our solution is verified.

**Final Answer:**

The value of \( x \) is \( 6 \).
