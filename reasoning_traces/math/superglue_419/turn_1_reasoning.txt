==================================================

To solve a reasoning problem effectively, it's important to understand the context and the specific question being asked. Since "Sample reasoning question 419" is not a specific math problem, I'll create a hypothetical reasoning problem and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**

A farmer has a total of 100 animals, consisting of chickens and cows. The total number of legs among all the animals is 280. How many chickens and how many cows does the farmer have?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( c \) represent the number of chickens.
   - Let \( w \) represent the number of cows.

2. **Set Up Equations:**
   - We know the total number of animals is 100, so:
     \[
     c + w = 100
     \]
   - Chickens have 2 legs each, and cows have 4 legs each. The total number of legs is 280, so:
     \[
     2c + 4w = 280
     \]

3. **Solve the System of Equations:**
   - Start with the first equation:
     \[
     c + w = 100
     \]
     Solve for \( c \):
     \[
     c = 100 - w
     \]

   - Substitute \( c = 100 - w \) into the second equation:
     \[
     2(100 - w) + 4w = 280
     \]

   - Simplify and solve for \( w \):
     \[
     200 - 2w + 4w = 280
     \]
     \[
     200 + 2w = 280
     \]
     \[
     2w = 80
     \]
     \[
     w = 40
     \]

   - Substitute \( w = 40 \) back into the equation for \( c \):
     \[
     c = 100 - w = 100 - 40 = 60
     \]

4. **Verify the Solution:**
   - Check the total number of animals:
     \[
     c + w = 60 + 40 = 100
     \]
   - Check the total number of legs:
     \[
     2c + 4w = 2(60) + 4(40) = 120 + 160 = 280
     \]

Both conditions are satisfied, confirming the solution is correct.

**Final Answer:**
The farmer has 60 chickens and 40 cows.
