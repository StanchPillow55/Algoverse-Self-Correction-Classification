==================================================

To solve the problem, I need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 419" refers to. Since the question is not explicitly provided, I'll assume that this is a placeholder for a typical math problem. Let's create a sample math problem and solve it step by step.

**Sample Problem:**

A farmer has a rectangular field that is 100 meters long and 60 meters wide. He wants to divide the field into smaller rectangular plots, each with an area of 150 square meters. How many such plots can he create?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - The field is a rectangle with dimensions 100 meters by 60 meters.
   - Each plot should have an area of 150 square meters.
   - We need to determine how many plots of this size can fit into the field.

2. **Calculate the Area of the Field:**
   - The area of a rectangle is given by the formula: 
     \[
     \text{Area} = \text{Length} \times \text{Width}
     \]
   - For the field:
     \[
     \text{Area of the field} = 100 \, \text{meters} \times 60 \, \text{meters} = 6000 \, \text{square meters}
     \]

3. **Determine the Number of Plots:**
   - Each plot has an area of 150 square meters.
   - To find out how many plots can fit into the field, divide the total area of the field by the area of one plot:
     \[
     \text{Number of plots} = \frac{\text{Area of the field}}{\text{Area of one plot}} = \frac{6000 \, \text{square meters}}{150 \, \text{square meters}}
     \]
   - Perform the division:
     \[
     \frac{6000}{150} = 40
     \]

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The farmer can create 40 plots, each with an area of 150 square meters, in the field.

**Final Answer:**
The farmer can create 40 plots of 150 square meters each in the rectangular field.
