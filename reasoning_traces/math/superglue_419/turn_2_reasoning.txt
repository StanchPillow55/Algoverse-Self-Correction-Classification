==================================================

To solve this problem, I need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 419" refers to. Since this is not a standard math problem description, I'll need to make some assumptions or create a hypothetical problem to solve. Let's assume "Sample reasoning question 419" is a placeholder for a specific math problem. I'll create a problem and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**

Let's assume the problem is as follows:

"A store sells apples at $2 each and bananas at $1.50 each. If a customer buys a total of 10 fruits consisting of apples and bananas and spends a total of $17, how many apples and how many bananas did the customer buy?"

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( a \) be the number of apples.
   - Let \( b \) be the number of bananas.

2. **Set Up Equations:**
   - From the problem, we have two conditions:
     1. The total number of fruits is 10: 
        \[
        a + b = 10
        \]
     2. The total cost is $17:
        \[
        2a + 1.5b = 17
        \]

3. **Solve the System of Equations:**

   We have the system:
   \[
   \begin{align*}
   a + b &= 10 \quad \text{(Equation 1)} \\
   2a + 1.5b &= 17 \quad \text{(Equation 2)}
   \end{align*}
   \]

   **Substitution Method:**

   From Equation 1, express \( b \) in terms of \( a \):
   \[
   b = 10 - a
   \]

   Substitute \( b = 10 - a \) into Equation 2:
   \[
   2a + 1.5(10 - a) = 17
   \]

   Simplify and solve for \( a \):
   \[
   2a + 15 - 1.5a = 17
   \]
   \[
   0.5a + 15 = 17
   \]
   \[
   0.5a = 2
   \]
   \[
   a = 4
   \]

   Substitute \( a = 4 \) back into the expression for \( b \):
   \[
   b = 10 - a = 10 - 4 = 6
   \]

4. **Verify the Solution:**

   Check if these values satisfy both original equations:
   - Total number of fruits: \( 4 + 6 = 10 \) (Correct)
   - Total cost: \( 2(4) + 1.5(6) = 8 + 9 = 17 \) (Correct)

Both conditions are satisfied, so the solution is verified.

**Final Answer:**

The customer bought 4 apples and 6 bananas.
