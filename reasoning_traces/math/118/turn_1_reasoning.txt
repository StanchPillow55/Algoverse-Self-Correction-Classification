Question ID: 118
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To determine how many objects Jeanette can juggle after practicing for 5 weeks, we can break the problem down step by step.

1. **Initial number of objects**: Jeanette starts by juggling 3 objects.

2. **Increase per week**: Each week, she can juggle 2 more objects than the previous week.

3. **Calculate the number of objects for each week**:
   - **Week 1**: She starts with 3 objects.
   - **Week 2**: 3 objects + 2 objects = 5 objects.
   - **Week 3**: 5 objects + 2 objects = 7 objects.
   - **Week 4**: 7 objects + 2 objects = 9 objects.
   - **Week 5**: 9 objects + 2 objects = 11 objects.

4. **Summarizing the number of objects each week**:
   - Week 1: 3 objects
   - Week 2: 5 objects
   - Week 3: 7 objects
   - Week 4: 9 objects
   - Week 5: 11 objects

5. **Final calculation**: After 5 weeks, Jeanette can juggle 11 objects.

Thus, the final answer is that Jeanette can juggle **11 objects** after practicing for 5 weeks.
