==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to determine how many objects Jeanette can juggle after practicing for 5 weeks, given that she starts with juggling 3 objects and increases the number of objects she can juggle by 2 each week.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the starting point**: Jeanette starts by juggling 3 objects.

2. **Determine the weekly increase**: Each week, she can juggle 2 more objects than the previous week.

3. **Calculate the number of objects she can juggle each week**:
   - **Week 1**: She starts with 3 objects.
   - **Week 2**: She can juggle \(3 + 2 = 5\) objects.
   - **Week 3**: She can juggle \(5 + 2 = 7\) objects.
   - **Week 4**: She can juggle \(7 + 2 = 9\) objects.
   - **Week 5**: She can juggle \(9 + 2 = 11\) objects.

4. **Summarize the weekly juggling counts**:
   - Week 1: 3 objects
   - Week 2: 5 objects
   - Week 3: 7 objects
   - Week 4: 9 objects
   - Week 5: 11 objects

5. **Final Calculation**: After practicing for 5 weeks, Jeanette can juggle 11 objects.

Thus, the final answer is:

**Jeanette can juggle 11 objects after practicing for 5 weeks.**
