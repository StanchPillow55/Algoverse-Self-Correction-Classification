==================================================

To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the number of vehicles from the first day:**
   - The customs officer counted 2 containers of imported vehicles.
   - Each container has 5 vehicles.
   - Therefore, the total number of vehicles from the first day is calculated as follows:
     \[
     \text{Total vehicles from the first day} = \text{Number of containers} \times \text{Vehicles per container} = 2 \times 5 = 10 \text{ vehicles}
     \]

2. **Determine the total number of vehicles after the second day:**
   - According to the problem, the total number of vehicles at the port became 30 after the second day.

3. **Calculate the number of vehicles added on the second day:**
   - To find out how many vehicles were added on the second day, we subtract the number of vehicles from the first day from the total number of vehicles:
     \[
     \text{Vehicles added on the second day} = \text{Total vehicles after second day} - \text{Total vehicles from the first day}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Vehicles added on the second day} = 30 - 10 = 20 \text{ vehicles}
     \]

4. **Determine the number of containers imported on the second day:**
   - We know that each container contains 5 vehicles. To find the number of containers that were imported on the second day, we divide the number of vehicles added by the number of vehicles per container:
     \[
     \text{Number of containers on the second day} = \frac{\text{Vehicles added on the second day}}{\text{Vehicles per container}} = \frac{20}{5} = 4 \text{ containers}
     \]

5. **Final answer:**
   - The number of containers that were imported on the second day is \( \boxed{4} \).
