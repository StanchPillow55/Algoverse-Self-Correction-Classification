==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine how many objects Jeanette can juggle each week, given that she starts with 3 objects and increases the number by 2 each week for 5 weeks.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Week (Week 0):**
   - Jeanette starts by juggling 3 objects.

2. **Week 1:**
   - She can juggle 2 more objects than the previous week.
   - Number of objects = 3 (initial) + 2 = 5 objects.

3. **Week 2:**
   - She can juggle 2 more objects than the previous week.
   - Number of objects = 5 (Week 1) + 2 = 7 objects.

4. **Week 3:**
   - She can juggle 2 more objects than the previous week.
   - Number of objects = 7 (Week 2) + 2 = 9 objects.

5. **Week 4:**
   - She can juggle 2 more objects than the previous week.
   - Number of objects = 9 (Week 3) + 2 = 11 objects.

6. **Week 5:**
   - She can juggle 2 more objects than the previous week.
   - Number of objects = 11 (Week 4) + 2 = 13 objects.

Now, let's summarize the number of objects Jeanette can juggle each week:

- Week 0: 3 objects
- Week 1: 5 objects
- Week 2: 7 objects
- Week 3: 9 objects
- Week 4: 11 objects
- Week 5: 13 objects

After practicing for 5 weeks, Jeanette can juggle 13 objects.

**Final Answer:**
Jeanette can juggle 13 objects after 5 weeks of practice.
