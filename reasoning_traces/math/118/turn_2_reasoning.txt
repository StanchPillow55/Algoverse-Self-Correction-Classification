Question ID: 118
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine how many objects Jeanette can juggle after practicing for 5 weeks, given that she starts juggling 3 objects and increases the number of objects by 2 each week.

Let's break it down week by week:

1. **Initial Week (Week 0):**  
   Jeanette starts by juggling 3 objects.

2. **Week 1:**  
   She can juggle 2 more objects than the previous week.  
   Number of objects = 3 (initial) + 2 = 5 objects.

3. **Week 2:**  
   Again, she can juggle 2 more objects than the previous week.  
   Number of objects = 5 (Week 1) + 2 = 7 objects.

4. **Week 3:**  
   She continues to increase by 2 more objects.  
   Number of objects = 7 (Week 2) + 2 = 9 objects.

5. **Week 4:**  
   Number of objects = 9 (Week 3) + 2 = 11 objects.

6. **Week 5:**  
   Number of objects = 11 (Week 4) + 2 = 13 objects.

After practicing for 5 weeks, Jeanette can juggle 13 objects.

**Final Answer:** Jeanette can juggle 13 objects after 5 weeks of practice.
