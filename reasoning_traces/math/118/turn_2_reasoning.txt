Question ID: 118
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To determine how many objects Jeanette can juggle after practicing for 5 weeks, we can follow these steps:

1. **Identify the starting point**: Jeanette starts juggling 3 objects.

2. **Determine the increase per week**: Each week, she can juggle 2 more objects than the previous week.

3. **Calculate the number of objects she can juggle each week**:
   - **Week 1**: 3 objects (starting point)
   - **Week 2**: 3 + 2 = 5 objects
   - **Week 3**: 5 + 2 = 7 objects
   - **Week 4**: 7 + 2 = 9 objects
   - **Week 5**: 9 + 2 = 11 objects

4. **Summarize the results**:
   - After 5 weeks, Jeanette can juggle 11 objects.

Thus, the final answer is that Jeanette can juggle **11 objects** after practicing for 5 weeks.
