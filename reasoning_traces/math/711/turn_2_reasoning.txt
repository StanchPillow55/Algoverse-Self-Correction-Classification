==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to determine how many scoops of ice cream Erin can buy with her $6.00, taking into account the special deal offered by the ice cream parlor.

1. **Understanding the Deal**: The deal states that if you buy 2 scoops of ice cream, you get 1 scoop free. This means for every 2 scoops purchased, Erin will receive a total of 3 scoops (2 paid + 1 free).

2. **Cost of Scoops**: Each scoop of ice cream costs $1.50. Therefore, the cost for 2 scoops is:
   \[
   \text{Cost for 2 scoops} = 2 \times 1.50 = 3.00 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Total Scoops from the Deal**: With the purchase of 2 scoops for $3.00, Erin will receive:
   \[
   \text{Total scoops} = 2 \text{ (paid)} + 1 \text{ (free)} = 3 \text{ scoops}
   \]

4. **Calculating How Many Sets of the Deal Erin Can Afford**: Erin has $6.00. We need to find out how many sets of the deal (2 scoops + 1 free) she can buy:
   \[
   \text{Number of sets} = \frac{\text{Total money}}{\text{Cost for 2 scoops}} = \frac{6.00}{3.00} = 2 \text{ sets}
   \]

5. **Total Scoops from All Sets**: Since Erin can buy 2 sets of the deal, the total number of scoops she will get is:
   \[
   \text{Total scoops} = 2 \text{ (sets)} \times 3 \text{ (scoops per set)} = 6 \text{ scoops}
   \]

6. **Final Calculation**: Erin spends:
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = 2 \text{ (sets)} \times 3.00 \text{ (cost per set)} = 6.00 \text{ dollars}
   \]
   This confirms that she can afford this purchase with her $6.00.

In conclusion, Erin should buy 2 sets of the deal to maximize her scoops of ice cream. Therefore, the total number of scoops of ice cream Erin should buy is:

\[
\boxed{6}
\]
