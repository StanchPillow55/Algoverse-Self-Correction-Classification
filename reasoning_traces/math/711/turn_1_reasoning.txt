==================================================

To determine how many scoops of ice cream Erin can buy with her $6.00, we need to analyze the deal and the cost of the scoops.

1. **Cost of Scoops**: Each scoop of ice cream costs $1.50.

2. **Deal Offered**: The deal states that if Erin buys 2 scoops, she gets 1 scoop free. This means for every 2 scoops she pays for, she receives a total of 3 scoops.

3. **Calculating the Cost for the Deal**:
   - If Erin buys 2 scoops, the cost is:
     \[
     2 \text{ scoops} \times 1.50 \text{ dollars/scoop} = 3.00 \text{ dollars}
     \]
   - With this deal, she receives 3 scoops for $3.00.

4. **How Many Deals Can Erin Afford?**:
   - Erin has $6.00. We can find out how many sets of the deal she can buy:
     \[
     \frac{6.00 \text{ dollars}}{3.00 \text{ dollars/deal}} = 2 \text{ deals}
     \]

5. **Total Scoops from Deals**:
   - Each deal gives her 3 scoops. Therefore, if she buys 2 deals:
     \[
     2 \text{ deals} \times 3 \text{ scoops/deal} = 6 \text{ scoops}
     \]

6. **Final Calculation**:
   - Erin spends $6.00 on 2 deals, which gives her a total of 6 scoops of ice cream.

Thus, the final answer is that Erin should buy **6 scoops of ice cream**.
