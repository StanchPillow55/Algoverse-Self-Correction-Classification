To solve the problem, we need to determine how many scoops of ice cream Erin can buy with her $6.00, taking into account the special deal offered by the ice cream parlor.

1. **Understanding the Deal**: The deal states that if you buy 2 scoops of ice cream, you get 1 scoop free. This means that for every 2 scoops purchased, Erin will receive a total of 3 scoops (2 purchased + 1 free).

2. **Cost of Scoops**: Each scoop of ice cream costs $1.50. Therefore, the cost for 2 scoops is:
   \[
   \text{Cost for 2 scoops} = 2 \times 1.50 = 3.00 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Total Scoops from the Deal**: When Erin buys 2 scoops for $3.00, she gets 1 additional scoop for free, resulting in a total of:
   \[
   \text{Total scoops} = 2 + 1 = 3 \text{ scoops}
   \]

4. **Calculating How Many Sets of the Deal Erin Can Afford**: Erin has $6.00. To find out how many sets of the deal she can afford, we divide her total money by the cost of one set (which is 2 scoops):
   \[
   \text{Number of sets} = \frac{6.00}{3.00} = 2
   \]

5. **Total Scoops from All Sets**: Since each set gives Erin 3 scoops, if she can afford 2 sets, the total number of scoops she can get is:
   \[
   \text{Total scoops from 2 sets} = 2 \times 3 = 6 \text{ scoops}
   \]

6. **Final Calculation**: Erin can buy 6 scoops of ice cream with her $6.00 by taking advantage of the deal.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{6}
\]
