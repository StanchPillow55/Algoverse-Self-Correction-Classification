==================================================

To solve the problem effectively, let's first clarify what "Sample reasoning question 103" entails. Since the problem statement is not explicitly provided, I'll assume it's a generic math problem that requires logical reasoning and step-by-step calculations. 

To demonstrate the process, I'll create a hypothetical math problem and solve it step-by-step:

**Hypothetical Problem:**
A train travels from City A to City B, a distance of 300 miles. The train travels the first 100 miles at a speed of 50 miles per hour, and the remaining distance at a speed of 75 miles per hour. Calculate the total time taken for the journey.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Identify the Distances and Speeds:**
   - First segment: 100 miles at 50 mph.
   - Second segment: 200 miles (300 - 100) at 75 mph.

2. **Calculate the Time for Each Segment:**
   - Time is calculated using the formula: 
     \[
     \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}}
     \]

   - **First Segment:**
     \[
     \text{Time}_1 = \frac{100 \text{ miles}}{50 \text{ mph}} = 2 \text{ hours}
     \]

   - **Second Segment:**
     \[
     \text{Time}_2 = \frac{200 \text{ miles}}{75 \text{ mph}} = \frac{200}{75} \text{ hours} = \frac{8}{3} \text{ hours} \approx 2.67 \text{ hours}
     \]

3. **Calculate the Total Time:**
   - Add the time for both segments:
     \[
     \text{Total Time} = \text{Time}_1 + \text{Time}_2 = 2 \text{ hours} + \frac{8}{3} \text{ hours}
     \]

   - Convert 2 hours to a fraction with a denominator of 3 to add:
     \[
     2 \text{ hours} = \frac{6}{3} \text{ hours}
     \]

   - Add the fractions:
     \[
     \text{Total Time} = \frac{6}{3} + \frac{8}{3} = \frac{14}{3} \text{ hours} \approx 4.67 \text{ hours}
     \]

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The total time taken for the journey is approximately 4.67 hours.

This step-by-step approach ensures that each part of the problem is addressed logically and systematically, leading to the correct final answer.
