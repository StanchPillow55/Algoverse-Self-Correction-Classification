==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to determine how many candy bars Marissa bought for her brother Jimmy after purchasing a ball.

1. **Identify the total amount of money Marissa had initially**: 
   Marissa had $80.

2. **Determine the cost of the ball**: 
   Marissa bought a ball for $20.

3. **Calculate the remaining money after buying the ball**:
   To find out how much money Marissa has left after her purchase, we subtract the cost of the ball from her initial amount:
   \[
   \text{Remaining money} = \text{Initial amount} - \text{Cost of the ball}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Remaining money} = 80 - 20 = 60
   \]
   So, Marissa has $60 left after buying the ball.

4. **Determine the cost of each candy bar**: 
   The problem states that candy bars are sold at $5 each.

5. **Calculate how many candy bars Marissa can buy with her remaining money**:
   To find out how many candy bars she can buy, we divide the remaining money by the cost of each candy bar:
   \[
   \text{Number of candy bars} = \frac{\text{Remaining money}}{\text{Cost of each candy bar}}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Number of candy bars} = \frac{60}{5} = 12
   \]

6. **Final answer**:
   Marissa bought 12 candy bars for Jimmy.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{12}
\]
