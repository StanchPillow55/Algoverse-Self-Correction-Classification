==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 332" refers to. Since the problem statement is not explicitly given, I will assume that "Sample reasoning question 332" is a placeholder for a specific math problem. Without the actual content of the problem, I will demonstrate how to approach a typical math problem step by step.

Let's assume a sample math problem for demonstration:

**Problem:**  
Solve for \( x \) in the equation:  
\[ 2x + 3 = 11 \]

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Equation:**
   The equation given is a linear equation in one variable, \( x \). Our goal is to isolate \( x \) on one side of the equation to find its value.

2. **Isolate the Variable:**
   To solve for \( x \), we need to get rid of the constant term on the left side of the equation. The equation is:
   \[ 2x + 3 = 11 \]

   Subtract 3 from both sides to eliminate the constant term:
   \[ 2x + 3 - 3 = 11 - 3 \]
   \[ 2x = 8 \]

3. **Solve for \( x \):**
   Now, we have \( 2x = 8 \). To isolate \( x \), divide both sides of the equation by 2:
   \[ \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{8}{2} \]
   \[ x = 4 \]

4. **Verify the Solution:**
   Substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies the equation:
   \[ 2(4) + 3 = 11 \]
   \[ 8 + 3 = 11 \]
   \[ 11 = 11 \]

   The left side equals the right side, confirming that \( x = 4 \) is indeed the correct solution.

**Final Answer:**
The solution to the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \) is \( x = 4 \).

This step-by-step approach can be applied to various types of math problems. If you have a specific problem or need further assistance, please provide more details or clarify the question.
