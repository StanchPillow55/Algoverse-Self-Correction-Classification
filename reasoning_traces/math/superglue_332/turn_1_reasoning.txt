==================================================

To solve the problem effectively, let's first understand what "Sample reasoning question 332" might entail. Since the problem itself is not explicitly stated, I'll create a hypothetical math problem and solve it step by step. 

Let's assume the problem is as follows:

**Problem:**
A company produces two types of gadgets: Gadget A and Gadget B. The company sells Gadget A for $50 each and Gadget B for $70 each. The cost to produce Gadget A is $30, and the cost to produce Gadget B is $40. Last month, the company sold a total of 200 gadgets and made a total revenue of $11,000. How many of each type of gadget did the company sell?

**Solution:**

To solve this problem, we need to determine how many of each type of gadget were sold. Let's define:

- \( x \) as the number of Gadget A sold.
- \( y \) as the number of Gadget B sold.

We have two key pieces of information:

1. The total number of gadgets sold is 200.
2. The total revenue from selling these gadgets is $11,000.

We can set up the following system of equations based on this information:

1. \( x + y = 200 \)  (Equation 1: Total gadgets sold)
2. \( 50x + 70y = 11,000 \)  (Equation 2: Total revenue)

**Step 1: Solve Equation 1 for one variable.**

From Equation 1, we can express \( y \) in terms of \( x \):

\[ y = 200 - x \]

**Step 2: Substitute into Equation 2.**

Substitute \( y = 200 - x \) into Equation 2:

\[ 50x + 70(200 - x) = 11,000 \]

**Step 3: Simplify and solve for \( x \).**

Expand and simplify the equation:

\[ 50x + 14,000 - 70x = 11,000 \]

Combine like terms:

\[ -20x + 14,000 = 11,000 \]

Subtract 14,000 from both sides:

\[ -20x = -3,000 \]

Divide by -20:

\[ x = 150 \]

**Step 4: Solve for \( y \).**

Substitute \( x = 150 \) back into the expression for \( y \):

\[ y = 200 - 150 = 50 \]

**Conclusion:**

The company sold 150 units of Gadget A and 50 units of Gadget B.

**Final Answer:**
Gadget A: 150 units, Gadget B: 50 units.
