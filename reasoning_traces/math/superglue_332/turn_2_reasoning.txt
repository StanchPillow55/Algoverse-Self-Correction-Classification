==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 332" refers to. Since the problem statement doesn't provide specific details about the question, I'll assume it's a placeholder for a generic math problem. Let's create a sample problem and solve it step by step.

**Sample Problem:**

Let's assume "Sample reasoning question 332" is a math problem involving algebra. Here's a hypothetical problem:

"Find the value of \( x \) in the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \)."

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Equation:**
   The equation given is \( 2x + 3 = 11 \). This is a linear equation in one variable, \( x \).

2. **Isolate the Variable:**
   To find the value of \( x \), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We can do this by performing operations that will simplify the equation.

3. **Subtract 3 from Both Sides:**
   To eliminate the constant term on the left side, subtract 3 from both sides of the equation:
   \[
   2x + 3 - 3 = 11 - 3
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   2x = 8
   \]

4. **Divide by 2:**
   Now, divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( x \):
   \[
   \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{8}{2}
   \]
   Simplifying gives:
   \[
   x = 4
   \]

5. **Verify the Solution:**
   Substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation to verify:
   \[
   2(4) + 3 = 11
   \]
   Simplifying the left side:
   \[
   8 + 3 = 11
   \]
   Since both sides of the equation are equal, our solution is verified.

**Final Answer:**

The value of \( x \) is \( 4 \).

This completes the problem-solving process for our hypothetical "Sample reasoning question 332." If you have a specific problem in mind, please provide the details, and I can work through that particular problem.
