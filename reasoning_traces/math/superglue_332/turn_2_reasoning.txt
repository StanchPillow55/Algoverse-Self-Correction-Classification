==================================================

To solve the problem effectively, we need to first understand the context and details of the question. However, the question provided, "Sample reasoning question 332," lacks specific details or numerical data to work with. Therefore, I'll demonstrate a general approach to solving a typical math reasoning problem by creating a hypothetical example.

Let's assume the problem is as follows:

**Problem:**
A train travels from City A to City B, a distance of 120 miles, at a constant speed. On its return trip, the train travels at a speed that is 20 miles per hour faster and takes 1 hour less to complete the journey. What is the speed of the train on the way to City B?

**Solution:**

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( x \) be the speed of the train from City A to City B in miles per hour.
   - The speed on the return trip is \( x + 20 \) miles per hour.

2. **Set Up Equations:**
   - The time taken to travel from City A to City B is \( \frac{120}{x} \) hours.
   - The time taken for the return trip is \( \frac{120}{x + 20} \) hours.
   - According to the problem, the return trip takes 1 hour less than the trip to City B:
     \[
     \frac{120}{x} - \frac{120}{x + 20} = 1
     \]

3. **Solve the Equation:**
   - To eliminate the fractions, find a common denominator and solve for \( x \):
     \[
     120(x + 20) - 120x = x(x + 20)
     \]
     \[
     120x + 2400 - 120x = x^2 + 20x
     \]
     \[
     2400 = x^2 + 20x
     \]
   - Rearrange the equation:
     \[
     x^2 + 20x - 2400 = 0
     \]

4. **Factor the Quadratic Equation:**
   - We need to find two numbers that multiply to -2400 and add to 20. These numbers are 60 and -40.
   - Factor the equation:
     \[
     (x + 60)(x - 40) = 0
     \]

5. **Solve for \( x \):**
   - Set each factor equal to zero:
     \[
     x + 60 = 0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad x = -60
     \]
     \[
     x - 40 = 0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad x = 40
     \]
   - Since speed cannot be negative, the speed of the train from City A to City B is \( x = 40 \) miles per hour.

6. **Verify the Solution:**
   - Time from City A to City B: \( \frac{120}{40} = 3 \) hours.
   - Speed on the return trip: \( 40 + 20 = 60 \) miles per hour.
   - Time for the return trip: \( \frac{120}{60} = 2 \) hours.
   - The return trip takes 1 hour less, confirming the solution is correct.

**Final Answer:**
The speed of the train on the way to City B is 40 miles per hour.
