==================================================

To solve the problem, we first need to understand what "Sample math problem 338" refers to. Since the problem itself is not provided, I'll assume a hypothetical math problem for demonstration purposes. Let's consider the following problem:

**Problem:**
Solve for \( x \) in the equation: 
\[ 2x + 5 = 17 \]

**Step-by-step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Equation:**
   The equation given is a simple linear equation in one variable, \( x \). Our goal is to isolate \( x \) on one side of the equation to find its value.

2. **Isolate the Variable:**
   To isolate \( x \), we need to perform operations that will leave \( x \) alone on one side of the equation. We start by eliminating the constant term on the left side.

   \[
   2x + 5 = 17
   \]

   Subtract 5 from both sides to remove the constant term from the left side:

   \[
   2x + 5 - 5 = 17 - 5
   \]

   Simplifying both sides gives:

   \[
   2x = 12
   \]

3. **Solve for \( x \):**
   Now, we need to solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides of the equation by the coefficient of \( x \), which is 2.

   \[
   \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{12}{2}
   \]

   Simplifying both sides gives:

   \[
   x = 6
   \]

4. **Verify the Solution:**
   To ensure our solution is correct, we substitute \( x = 6 \) back into the original equation and check if both sides are equal.

   \[
   2(6) + 5 = 17
   \]

   Calculate the left side:

   \[
   12 + 5 = 17
   \]

   Since both sides of the equation are equal, our solution is verified.

**Final Answer:**
The solution to the equation \( 2x + 5 = 17 \) is \( x = 6 \).
