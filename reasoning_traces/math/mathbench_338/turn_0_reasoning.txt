==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample math problem 338" refers to. Since there is no specific problem statement provided, I'll assume this is a placeholder and create a sample math problem to solve.

Let's create a problem involving algebra and solve it step by step.

**Sample Math Problem:**

Solve for \( x \) in the equation:

\[ 3x + 5 = 2x + 11 \]

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Identify the Equation:**

   We are given the equation:

   \[ 3x + 5 = 2x + 11 \]

2. **Isolate the Variable:**

   To solve for \( x \), we need to get all terms involving \( x \) on one side of the equation and constant terms on the other side.

   Start by subtracting \( 2x \) from both sides to move the \( x \)-terms to one side:

   \[ 3x + 5 - 2x = 2x + 11 - 2x \]

   Simplifying both sides gives:

   \[ x + 5 = 11 \]

3. **Solve for \( x \):**

   Next, subtract 5 from both sides to isolate \( x \):

   \[ x + 5 - 5 = 11 - 5 \]

   Simplifying both sides gives:

   \[ x = 6 \]

4. **Verify the Solution:**

   Substitute \( x = 6 \) back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies the equation:

   \[ 3(6) + 5 = 2(6) + 11 \]

   Calculate both sides:

   Left side: \( 18 + 5 = 23 \)

   Right side: \( 12 + 11 = 23 \)

   Since both sides are equal, our solution \( x = 6 \) is correct.

**Final Answer:**

The solution to the equation \( 3x + 5 = 2x + 11 \) is \( x = 6 \).
