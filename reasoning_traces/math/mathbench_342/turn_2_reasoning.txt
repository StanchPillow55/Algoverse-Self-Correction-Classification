Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 342," we need to first understand what the problem is asking. However, the problem statement "Sample math problem 342" is not specific enough to determine the exact question or the mathematical operations involved. Therefore, I will provide a general approach to solving math problems and demonstrate how to solve a hypothetical problem.

### General Approach to Solving Math Problems

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - Read the problem carefully.
   - Identify what is being asked.
   - Determine what information is given and what is needed.

2. **Devise a Plan:**
   - Choose an appropriate strategy to solve the problem (e.g., algebraic manipulation, drawing a diagram, logical reasoning).

3. **Carry Out the Plan:**
   - Execute the chosen strategy step by step.
   - Perform calculations carefully.

4. **Review/Check the Solution:**
   - Verify that the solution is correct.
   - Ensure that all parts of the problem are addressed.

### Hypothetical Problem Example

Let's assume "Sample math problem 342" refers to the following hypothetical problem:

**Problem:** Solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).

#### Step-by-Step Solution

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We need to find the value of \( x \) that satisfies the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).

2. **Devise a Plan:**
   - We can solve for \( x \) by isolating it on one side of the equation.

3. **Carry Out the Plan:**
   - Start with the equation: \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).
   - Subtract 3 from both sides to isolate the term with \( x \):
     \[
     2x + 3 - 3 = 11 - 3
     \]
     \[
     2x = 8
     \]
   - Divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( x \):
     \[
     \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{8}{2}
     \]
     \[
     x = 4
     \]

4. **Review/Check the Solution:**
   - Substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation to verify:
     \[
     2(4) + 3 = 8 + 3 = 11
     \]
   - The left side equals the right side, confirming that \( x = 4 \) is correct.

### Final Answer

The solution to the hypothetical problem \( 2x + 3 = 11 \) is \( x = 4 \).
