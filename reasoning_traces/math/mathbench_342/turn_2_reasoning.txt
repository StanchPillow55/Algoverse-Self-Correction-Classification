Question ID: mathbench_342
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 342," we need to first understand what the problem is asking. However, the problem statement "Sample math problem 342" is not specific and does not provide any details about the nature of the problem. 

In order to proceed, let's assume that "Sample math problem 342" refers to a specific type of math problem. Since we don't have the actual problem, I'll create a hypothetical problem and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem 342:**
"Calculate the sum of the first 10 positive integers."

Let's solve this problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Sequence:**
   The first 10 positive integers are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.

2. **Understand the Formula for the Sum of an Arithmetic Series:**
   The sum \( S \) of the first \( n \) positive integers can be calculated using the formula:
   \[
   S = \frac{n(n + 1)}{2}
   \]
   where \( n \) is the number of terms.

3. **Substitute the Values:**
   Here, \( n = 10 \). Substitute \( n \) into the formula:
   \[
   S = \frac{10(10 + 1)}{2}
   \]

4. **Perform the Calculations:**
   \[
   S = \frac{10 \times 11}{2} = \frac{110}{2} = 55
   \]

5. **Verify the Calculation by Adding the Numbers Directly:**
   Let's add the numbers directly to verify:
   \[
   1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 10 = 55
   \]

Both methods give the same result, confirming the calculation is correct.

**Final Answer:**
The sum of the first 10 positive integers is 55.
