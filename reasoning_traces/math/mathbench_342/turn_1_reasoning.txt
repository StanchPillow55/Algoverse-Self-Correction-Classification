==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 342," we first need to understand what the problem is asking. However, the problem statement "Sample math problem 342" is not specific enough for us to determine the exact mathematical question or context. Therefore, I will demonstrate a general approach to solving a typical math problem by creating a hypothetical problem based on common math topics.

Let's assume "Sample math problem 342" refers to a problem involving solving a quadratic equation. Here's a step-by-step solution to a sample quadratic equation problem:

**Problem:** Solve the quadratic equation \(2x^2 - 4x - 6 = 0\).

**Step 1: Identify the coefficients.**
The given quadratic equation is in the standard form \(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\), where:
- \(a = 2\)
- \(b = -4\)
- \(c = -6\)

**Step 2: Use the quadratic formula.**
The quadratic formula is given by:
\[
x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
\]

**Step 3: Calculate the discriminant.**
The discriminant (\(\Delta\)) is the part under the square root in the quadratic formula: \(b^2 - 4ac\).
\[
\Delta = (-4)^2 - 4 \times 2 \times (-6) = 16 + 48 = 64
\]

**Step 4: Determine the roots using the quadratic formula.**
Since the discriminant is positive (\(\Delta = 64\)), there are two distinct real roots.
\[
x = \frac{-(-4) \pm \sqrt{64}}{2 \times 2}
\]
\[
x = \frac{4 \pm 8}{4}
\]

**Step 5: Calculate the two possible values for \(x\).**
- For the positive square root:
  \[
  x_1 = \frac{4 + 8}{4} = \frac{12}{4} = 3
  \]

- For the negative square root:
  \[
  x_2 = \frac{4 - 8}{4} = \frac{-4}{4} = -1
  \]

**Final Answer:**
The solutions to the quadratic equation \(2x^2 - 4x - 6 = 0\) are \(x = 3\) and \(x = -1\).

This is a complete step-by-step solution to a sample quadratic equation problem. If "Sample math problem 342" refers to a different type of problem, please provide more details or context so I can assist you accordingly.
