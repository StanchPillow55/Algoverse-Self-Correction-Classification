Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 342," we need to first understand what the problem is asking. However, the problem statement is incomplete as it stands. Since "Sample math problem 342" does not provide any specific details or numbers to work with, I will assume this is a placeholder or reference to a specific math problem that needs to be solved.

To proceed, let's create a hypothetical math problem that could be labeled as "Sample math problem 342" and solve it step by step. Let's assume the problem is as follows:

**Problem Statement:**
"Find the value of \( x \) in the equation \( 2x + 5 = 17 \)."

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Equation:**
   The equation given is \( 2x + 5 = 17 \). This is a linear equation in one variable, \( x \).

2. **Isolate the Variable:**
   To solve for \( x \), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We start by eliminating the constant term on the left side of the equation.

   \[
   2x + 5 = 17
   \]

   Subtract 5 from both sides to remove the constant term:

   \[
   2x + 5 - 5 = 17 - 5
   \]

   Simplifying both sides gives:

   \[
   2x = 12
   \]

3. **Solve for \( x \):**
   Now, we need to solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides of the equation by the coefficient of \( x \), which is 2.

   \[
   \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{12}{2}
   \]

   Simplifying both sides gives:

   \[
   x = 6
   \]

4. **Verify the Solution:**
   To ensure our solution is correct, we substitute \( x = 6 \) back into the original equation and check if both sides are equal.

   Original equation: \( 2x + 5 = 17 \)

   Substitute \( x = 6 \):

   \[
   2(6) + 5 = 12 + 5 = 17
   \]

   Since both sides of the equation are equal, our solution is verified.

**Final Answer:**
The value of \( x \) is 6.
