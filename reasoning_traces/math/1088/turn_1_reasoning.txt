Question ID: 1088
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To determine how many hours a week John spends learning, we will break down the problem step by step.

### Step 1: Calculate the total class time during the week

1. **Normal class periods per day**: 6 periods
2. **Extra classes**: 2 extra classes
3. **Total classes per day**: 
   \[
   6 + 2 = 8 \text{ classes}
   \]
4. **Duration of each class**: 40 minutes
5. **Total class time per day**:
   \[
   8 \text{ classes} \times 40 \text{ minutes/class} = 320 \text{ minutes/day}
   \]
6. **Total class time per week** (5 days):
   \[
   320 \text{ minutes/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 1600 \text{ minutes/week}
   \]

### Step 2: Calculate the extra learning time on the weekend

1. **Total minutes in a week**: 
   \[
   7 \text{ days} \times 24 \text{ hours/day} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 10080 \text{ minutes/week}
   \]
2. **Extra learning time on Saturday and Sunday**: 
   - He spends \( \frac{1}{16} \) of his weekly minutes on each of these days.
   - Calculate \( \frac{1}{16} \) of total weekly minutes:
   \[
   \frac{10080 \text{ minutes}}{16} = 630 \text{ minutes}
   \]
   - Therefore, he spends 630 minutes on Saturday and 630 minutes on Sunday.

3. **Total extra learning time on the weekend**:
   \[
   630 \text{ minutes} + 630 \text{ minutes} = 1260 \text{ minutes}
   \]

### Step 3: Calculate the total learning time for the week

1. **Total learning time for the week**:
   \[
   1600 \text{ minutes (class time)} + 1260 \text{ minutes (extra learning)} = 2860 \text{ minutes}
   \]

### Step 4: Convert total learning time from minutes to hours

1. **Convert minutes to hours**:
   \[
   \frac{2860 \text{ minutes}}{60 \text{ minutes/hour}} \approx 47.6667 \text{ hours}
   \]

### Final Answer

John spends approximately **47.67 hours** learning each week. 

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{47.67}
\]
