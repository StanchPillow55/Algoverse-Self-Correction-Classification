To determine how many hours a week John spends learning, we will break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate the total class time during the weekdays:**
   - John has 6 periods in a day, and he takes 2 extra classes, making it a total of \(6 + 2 = 8\) classes per day.
   - Each class is 40 minutes long, so the total time spent in classes each day is:
     \[
     8 \text{ classes} \times 40 \text{ minutes/class} = 320 \text{ minutes/day}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total class time for the week:**
   - John goes to class for 5 days a week, so the total class time for the week is:
     \[
     320 \text{ minutes/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 1600 \text{ minutes/week}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total minutes in a week:**
   - There are 7 days in a week, and each day has 24 hours. Therefore, the total number of minutes in a week is:
     \[
     7 \text{ days} \times 24 \text{ hours/day} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 10080 \text{ minutes/week}
     \]

4. **Calculate the extra learning time on the weekend:**
   - John spends \( \frac{1}{16} \) of his weekly minutes on Saturday and Sunday as extra learning time. First, we calculate \( \frac{1}{16} \) of the total weekly minutes:
     \[
     \frac{1}{16} \times 10080 \text{ minutes} = 630 \text{ minutes}
     \]
   - Since this is the total for both Saturday and Sunday, the extra learning time for each day is:
     \[
     \frac{630 \text{ minutes}}{2} = 315 \text{ minutes/day}
     \]

5. **Calculate the total extra learning time for the weekend:**
   - The total extra learning time for both Saturday and Sunday is:
     \[
     315 \text{ minutes} + 315 \text{ minutes} = 630 \text{ minutes}
     \]

6. **Calculate the total learning time for the week:**
   - Now, we add the total class time for the week to the total extra learning time:
     \[
     1600 \text{ minutes (class time)} + 630 \text{ minutes (extra learning)} = 2230 \text{ minutes/week}
     \]

7. **Convert total learning time from minutes to hours:**
   - To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60:
     \[
     \frac{2230 \text{ minutes}}{60 \text{ minutes/hour}} \approx 37.1667 \text{ hours}
     \]

8. **Final answer:**
   - Rounding to two decimal places, John spends approximately \( 37.17 \) hours a week learning.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{37.17} \text{ hours/week}
\]
