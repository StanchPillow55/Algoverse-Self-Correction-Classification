Question ID: 1088
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To determine how many hours a week John spends learning, we will break down the problem step by step.

### Step 1: Calculate the total class time during the week

1. **Normal Class Periods**: John has 6 periods each day.
2. **Extra Classes**: John has 2 extra classes each day.
3. **Total Classes per Day**: 
   \[
   \text{Total Classes per Day} = 6 + 2 = 8 \text{ classes}
   \]
4. **Duration of Each Class**: Each class is 40 minutes long.
5. **Total Class Time per Day**: 
   \[
   \text{Total Class Time per Day} = 8 \text{ classes} \times 40 \text{ minutes/class} = 320 \text{ minutes}
   \]
6. **Days per Week**: John attends class for 5 days a week.
7. **Total Class Time per Week**: 
   \[
   \text{Total Class Time per Week} = 320 \text{ minutes/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 1600 \text{ minutes}
   \]

### Step 2: Calculate the extra learning time on the weekend

1. **Total Minutes in a Week**: There are 7 days in a week, and each day has 24 hours.
   \[
   \text{Total Minutes in a Week} = 7 \text{ days} \times 24 \text{ hours/day} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 10080 \text{ minutes}
   \]
2. **Extra Learning Time on Saturday and Sunday**: John spends \( \frac{1}{16} \) of his weekly minutes on each of these days.
3. **Extra Learning Time Calculation**:
   \[
   \text{Extra Learning Time per Day} = \frac{1}{16} \times 10080 \text{ minutes} = 630 \text{ minutes}
   \]
4. **Total Extra Learning Time for the Weekend**: 
   \[
   \text{Total Extra Learning Time} = 630 \text{ minutes/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 1260 \text{ minutes}
   \]

### Step 3: Calculate the total learning time for the week

1. **Total Learning Time**: This includes both class time and extra learning time.
   \[
   \text{Total Learning Time} = \text{Total Class Time per Week} + \text{Total Extra Learning Time}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total Learning Time} = 1600 \text{ minutes} + 1260 \text{ minutes} = 2860 \text{ minutes}
   \]

### Step 4: Convert total learning time from minutes to hours

1. **Convert Minutes to Hours**: There are 60 minutes in an hour.
   \[
   \text{Total Learning Time in Hours} = \frac{2860 \text{ minutes}}{60 \text{ minutes/hour}} \approx 47.6667 \text{ hours}
   \]

### Final Answer

To express this in a more standard format, we can say:
\[
\text{Total Learning Time} \approx 47 \text{ hours and } 40 \text{ minutes}
\]

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\text{John spends approximately } 47.67 \text{ hours a week learning.}
\]
