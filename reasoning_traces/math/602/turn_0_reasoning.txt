==================================================

To solve the problem, we first need to determine the speed of the plane based on the information given. 

1. **Calculate the speed of the plane:**
   The plane travels 1200 miles in 3 hours. We can find the speed by using the formula:

   \[
   \text{Speed} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Time}}
   \]

   Substituting the values:

   \[
   \text{Speed} = \frac{1200 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ hours}} = 400 \text{ miles per hour}
   \]

2. **Determine the time required to travel an additional 2000 miles:**
   Now that we know the speed of the plane is 400 miles per hour, we can calculate how long it will take to travel an additional 2000 miles using the same speed formula rearranged to find time:

   \[
   \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}}
   \]

   Substituting the values:

   \[
   \text{Time} = \frac{2000 \text{ miles}}{400 \text{ miles per hour}} = 5 \text{ hours}
   \]

3. **Conclusion:**
   The additional time it would take to travel an additional 2000 miles at the same speed of 400 miles per hour is 5 hours.

Thus, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{5 \text{ hours}}
\]
