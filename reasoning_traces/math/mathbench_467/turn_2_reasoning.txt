==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 467," we need to first understand what the problem is asking. Since the problem statement is not provided, I'll assume a hypothetical math problem with the number 467 involved. Let's create a problem and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**
"Find the sum of the digits of the number 467 and determine if the sum is a prime number."

**Step 1: Break down the number 467 into its individual digits.**

The number 467 consists of three digits: 4, 6, and 7.

**Step 2: Calculate the sum of these digits.**

Sum = 4 + 6 + 7

Let's perform the addition:

- First, add 4 and 6:
  \[
  4 + 6 = 10
  \]

- Next, add the result to 7:
  \[
  10 + 7 = 17
  \]

So, the sum of the digits of 467 is 17.

**Step 3: Determine if the sum (17) is a prime number.**

A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.

- Check divisibility of 17 by any prime numbers less than its square root. The square root of 17 is approximately 4.12, so we check divisibility by 2 and 3 (the prime numbers less than 4.12).

- 17 is not divisible by 2 because it is an odd number.

- To check divisibility by 3, sum the digits of 17:
  \[
  1 + 7 = 8
  \]
  Since 8 is not divisible by 3, 17 is not divisible by 3.

Since 17 is not divisible by any prime numbers less than its square root, 17 is a prime number.

**Final Answer:**

The sum of the digits of 467 is 17, and 17 is a prime number.
