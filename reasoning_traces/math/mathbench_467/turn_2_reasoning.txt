==================================================

To solve the problem, I need to understand what "Sample math problem 467" refers to. Since I don't have access to external databases or specific problem sets, I'll create a hypothetical math problem labeled as "Sample math problem 467" and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem 467:**

*Solve for \( x \) in the equation:*

\[ 3x^2 - 12x + 9 = 0 \]

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Identify the type of equation:**
   The given equation is a quadratic equation in the standard form \( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \), where \( a = 3 \), \( b = -12 \), and \( c = 9 \).

2. **Check if the equation can be simplified:**
   Notice that all coefficients are divisible by 3. Simplify the equation by dividing every term by 3:

   \[
   x^2 - 4x + 3 = 0
   \]

3. **Factor the quadratic equation:**
   We need to find two numbers that multiply to 3 (the constant term) and add up to -4 (the coefficient of \( x \)).

   The numbers -3 and -1 satisfy these conditions because:
   \[
   (-3) \times (-1) = 3 \quad \text{and} \quad (-3) + (-1) = -4
   \]

   Therefore, the equation can be factored as:
   \[
   (x - 3)(x - 1) = 0
   \]

4. **Solve for \( x \):**
   Set each factor equal to zero and solve for \( x \):

   \[
   x - 3 = 0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad x = 3
   \]

   \[
   x - 1 = 0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad x = 1
   \]

5. **Verify the solutions:**
   Substitute \( x = 3 \) and \( x = 1 \) back into the original equation to ensure they satisfy it.

   For \( x = 3 \):
   \[
   3(3)^2 - 12(3) + 9 = 27 - 36 + 9 = 0
   \]

   For \( x = 1 \):
   \[
   3(1)^2 - 12(1) + 9 = 3 - 12 + 9 = 0
   \]

   Both solutions satisfy the original equation.

**Final Answer:**

The solutions to the equation \( 3x^2 - 12x + 9 = 0 \) are \( x = 3 \) and \( x = 1 \).
