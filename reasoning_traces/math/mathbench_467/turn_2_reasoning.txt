==================================================

To solve the problem labeled "Sample math problem 467," we first need to understand the problem itself. However, since the problem statement is not provided, I will create a hypothetical math problem labeled as "Sample math problem 467" and solve it step by step.

Let's assume "Sample math problem 467" is as follows:

**Problem Statement:**
A rectangle has a length that is 3 times its width. If the perimeter of the rectangle is 48 units, find the dimensions of the rectangle.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We are given a rectangle with a length that is 3 times its width.
   - The perimeter of the rectangle is 48 units.
   - We need to find the dimensions of the rectangle (i.e., the length and the width).

2. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( w \) be the width of the rectangle.
   - Since the length is 3 times the width, let \( l = 3w \).

3. **Use the Perimeter Formula:**
   - The formula for the perimeter \( P \) of a rectangle is given by:
     \[
     P = 2l + 2w
     \]
   - Substitute the given perimeter and the expression for the length:
     \[
     48 = 2(3w) + 2w
     \]

4. **Simplify and Solve for \( w \):**
   - Simplify the equation:
     \[
     48 = 6w + 2w
     \]
     \[
     48 = 8w
     \]
   - Divide both sides by 8 to solve for \( w \):
     \[
     w = \frac{48}{8} = 6
     \]

5. **Find the Length \( l \):**
   - Since \( l = 3w \), substitute \( w = 6 \):
     \[
     l = 3 \times 6 = 18
     \]

6. **Verify the Solution:**
   - Check the perimeter with the found dimensions:
     \[
     P = 2l + 2w = 2(18) + 2(6) = 36 + 12 = 48
     \]
   - The calculated perimeter matches the given perimeter, confirming our solution is correct.

**Final Answer:**
The dimensions of the rectangle are:
- Width \( w = 6 \) units
- Length \( l = 18 \) units
