To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of tomato seeds planted by both Mike and Ted, both in the morning and in the afternoon.

**Step 1: Calculate the number of seeds planted in the morning.**

- Mike planted 50 tomato seeds in the morning.
- Ted planted twice as many seeds as Mike in the morning. Therefore, the number of seeds Ted planted is:
  \[
  2 \times 50 = 100
  \]

**Step 2: Calculate the total number of seeds planted in the morning by both Mike and Ted.**

- Total seeds planted in the morning:
  \[
  50 \, (\text{Mike}) + 100 \, (\text{Ted}) = 150
  \]

**Step 3: Calculate the number of seeds planted in the afternoon.**

- Mike planted 60 tomato seeds in the afternoon.
- Ted planted 20 fewer seeds than Mike in the afternoon. Therefore, the number of seeds Ted planted is:
  \[
  60 - 20 = 40
  \]

**Step 4: Calculate the total number of seeds planted in the afternoon by both Mike and Ted.**

- Total seeds planted in the afternoon:
  \[
  60 \, (\text{Mike}) + 40 \, (\text{Ted}) = 100
  \]

**Step 5: Calculate the total number of seeds planted altogether.**

- Total seeds planted altogether (morning + afternoon):
  \[
  150 \, (\text{morning}) + 100 \, (\text{afternoon}) = 250
  \]

Thus, the total number of tomato seeds planted by Mike and Ted altogether is \(\boxed{250}\).
