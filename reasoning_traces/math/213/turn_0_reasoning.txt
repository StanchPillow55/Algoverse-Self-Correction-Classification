==================================================

To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step, calculating the number of tomato seeds planted by both Mike and Ted in the morning and afternoon, and then summing those amounts.

### Step 1: Calculate the number of seeds planted in the morning.

- **Mike's morning planting**: Mike planted 50 tomato seeds.
  
- **Ted's morning planting**: Ted planted twice as much as Mike. Therefore, we calculate Ted's morning planting as follows:
  \[
  \text{Ted's morning planting} = 2 \times \text{Mike's morning planting} = 2 \times 50 = 100 \text{ seeds}
  \]

### Step 2: Calculate the number of seeds planted in the afternoon.

- **Mike's afternoon planting**: Mike planted 60 tomato seeds.
  
- **Ted's afternoon planting**: Ted planted 20 fewer seeds than Mike. Therefore, we calculate Ted's afternoon planting as follows:
  \[
  \text{Ted's afternoon planting} = \text{Mike's afternoon planting} - 20 = 60 - 20 = 40 \text{ seeds}
  \]

### Step 3: Sum the total number of seeds planted by Mike and Ted.

Now we will calculate the total number of seeds planted by both Mike and Ted in the morning and afternoon.

- **Total seeds planted by Mike**:
  \[
  \text{Total by Mike} = \text{Morning} + \text{Afternoon} = 50 + 60 = 110 \text{ seeds}
  \]

- **Total seeds planted by Ted**:
  \[
  \text{Total by Ted} = \text{Morning} + \text{Afternoon} = 100 + 40 = 140 \text{ seeds}
  \]

### Step 4: Calculate the overall total.

Now, we will sum the total seeds planted by both Mike and Ted:
\[
\text{Total seeds planted} = \text{Total by Mike} + \text{Total by Ted} = 110 + 140 = 250 \text{ seeds}
\]

### Final Answer:
The total number of tomato seeds planted by Mike and Ted altogether is **250 seeds**.
