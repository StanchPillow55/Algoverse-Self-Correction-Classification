==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 203" entails. Since the question is not explicitly stated, I'll assume it involves a typical math problem-solving scenario. Let's consider a hypothetical problem and solve it step-by-step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**

A store sells apples and oranges. An apple costs $0.50, and an orange costs $0.70. If a customer buys a total of 10 fruits consisting of apples and oranges and spends $6.20, how many apples and how many oranges did the customer buy?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( x \) be the number of apples.
   - Let \( y \) be the number of oranges.

2. **Set Up Equations:**
   - The total number of fruits is 10: 
     \[
     x + y = 10
     \]
   - The total cost of the fruits is $6.20:
     \[
     0.50x + 0.70y = 6.20
     \]

3. **Solve the System of Equations:**

   We have the following system of equations:
   \[
   \begin{align*}
   x + y &= 10 \quad \text{(Equation 1)} \\
   0.50x + 0.70y &= 6.20 \quad \text{(Equation 2)}
   \end{align*}
   \]

   **Substitution Method:**

   From Equation 1, express \( y \) in terms of \( x \):
   \[
   y = 10 - x
   \]

   Substitute \( y = 10 - x \) into Equation 2:
   \[
   0.50x + 0.70(10 - x) = 6.20
   \]

   Simplify and solve for \( x \):
   \[
   0.50x + 7 - 0.70x = 6.20
   \]
   \[
   -0.20x + 7 = 6.20
   \]
   \[
   -0.20x = 6.20 - 7
   \]
   \[
   -0.20x = -0.80
   \]
   \[
   x = \frac{-0.80}{-0.20}
   \]
   \[
   x = 4
   \]

   Substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the expression for \( y \):
   \[
   y = 10 - 4 = 6
   \]

4. **Verify the Solution:**

   Check the total number of fruits:
   \[
   x + y = 4 + 6 = 10
   \]

   Check the total cost:
   \[
   0.50(4) + 0.70(6) = 2.00 + 4.20 = 6.20
   \]

   Both conditions are satisfied.

**Final Answer:**

The customer bought 4 apples and 6 oranges.
