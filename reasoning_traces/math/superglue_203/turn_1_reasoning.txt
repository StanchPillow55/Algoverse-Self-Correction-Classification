==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 203" refers to. However, since this is a placeholder and not an actual math problem, I'll create a hypothetical math problem to demonstrate how to solve it step by step.

Let's assume the problem is:

**Problem:**  
A company sells two types of products: Product A and Product B. The company sells Product A for $50 each and Product B for $30 each. In one week, the company sold a total of 100 products and made $3,800 in revenue. How many of each product did the company sell?

**Solution:**

To solve this problem, we need to set up a system of equations based on the information given.

1. **Define the Variables:**
   - Let \( x \) be the number of Product A sold.
   - Let \( y \) be the number of Product B sold.

2. **Set Up the Equations:**
   - From the problem, we know the total number of products sold is 100. Therefore, the first equation is:
     \[
     x + y = 100
     \]
   - We also know the total revenue is $3,800. The revenue from Product A is $50 per unit, and from Product B is $30 per unit. Therefore, the second equation is:
     \[
     50x + 30y = 3800
     \]

3. **Solve the System of Equations:**

   We can use the substitution or elimination method. Here, we'll use the substitution method.

   - From the first equation, solve for \( y \):
     \[
     y = 100 - x
     \]

   - Substitute \( y = 100 - x \) into the second equation:
     \[
     50x + 30(100 - x) = 3800
     \]

   - Simplify and solve for \( x \):
     \[
     50x + 3000 - 30x = 3800
     \]
     \[
     20x + 3000 = 3800
     \]
     \[
     20x = 800
     \]
     \[
     x = 40
     \]

   - Substitute \( x = 40 \) back into the equation for \( y \):
     \[
     y = 100 - 40 = 60
     \]

4. **Verify the Solution:**

   - Check the total number of products:
     \[
     x + y = 40 + 60 = 100
     \]
   - Check the total revenue:
     \[
     50x + 30y = 50(40) + 30(60) = 2000 + 1800 = 3800
     \]

Both conditions are satisfied, confirming our solution is correct.

**Final Answer:**
The company sold 40 units of Product A and 60 units of Product B.
