==================================================

It seems like the question "Sample reasoning question 234" is not a specific math problem but rather a placeholder or an incomplete query. To provide a meaningful response, I need a specific math problem or question to solve. However, I can guide you through a generic example of how to solve a math problem step-by-step. Let's consider a sample math problem:

**Sample Problem:**

Solve for \( x \) in the equation: \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Equation:**
   The equation given is \( 2x + 3 = 11 \). Our goal is to solve for \( x \), which means we need to isolate \( x \) on one side of the equation.

2. **Isolate the Term with \( x \):**
   To isolate the term with \( x \), we need to get rid of the constant term on the left side of the equation. We can do this by subtracting 3 from both sides of the equation:
   \[
   2x + 3 - 3 = 11 - 3
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   2x = 8
   \]

3. **Solve for \( x \):**
   Now that we have \( 2x = 8 \), we need to solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides of the equation by 2:
   \[
   \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{8}{2}
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   x = 4
   \]

4. **Verify the Solution:**
   To ensure our solution is correct, we can substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation and check if both sides are equal:
   \[
   2(4) + 3 = 11
   \]
   Simplifying the left side gives:
   \[
   8 + 3 = 11
   \]
   Since both sides of the equation are equal, our solution is verified.

**Final Answer:**

The solution to the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \) is \( x = 4 \).

If you have a specific math problem or question, please provide it, and I will be happy to work through it step-by-step.
