Question ID: mathbench_109
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we first need to understand what "Sample math problem 109" refers to. Since the problem is not explicitly stated, I'll assume it involves a typical math problem that could be labeled as such. Let's consider a common type of math problem, such as solving a quadratic equation, and work through it step by step.

**Sample Problem: Solve the quadratic equation \(x^2 - 5x + 6 = 0\).**

### Step 1: Identify the coefficients
The standard form of a quadratic equation is \(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\). For the equation \(x^2 - 5x + 6 = 0\), the coefficients are:
- \(a = 1\)
- \(b = -5\)
- \(c = 6\)

### Step 2: Use the quadratic formula
The quadratic formula is given by:
\[
x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the discriminant
The discriminant (\(D\)) is the part of the quadratic formula under the square root: \(b^2 - 4ac\).
\[
D = (-5)^2 - 4 \times 1 \times 6 = 25 - 24 = 1
\]

### Step 4: Determine the roots using the quadratic formula
Since the discriminant is positive, there are two distinct real roots. Substitute the values into the quadratic formula:
\[
x = \frac{-(-5) \pm \sqrt{1}}{2 \times 1} = \frac{5 \pm 1}{2}
\]

### Step 5: Calculate the two possible values for \(x\)
1. \(x = \frac{5 + 1}{2} = \frac{6}{2} = 3\)
2. \(x = \frac{5 - 1}{2} = \frac{4}{2} = 2\)

### Conclusion
The solutions to the quadratic equation \(x^2 - 5x + 6 = 0\) are \(x = 3\) and \(x = 2\).

**Final Answer:**
The roots of the equation are \(x = 3\) and \(x = 2\).
