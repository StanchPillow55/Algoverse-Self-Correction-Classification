==================================================

To solve "Sample math problem 109," I need more specific information about the problem itself. Since the problem isn't provided, I'll create a sample math problem and solve it step by step.

**Sample Math Problem:**

Calculate the area of a triangle with a base of 10 units and a height of 5 units.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Formula for the Area of a Triangle:**

   The area \( A \) of a triangle can be calculated using the formula:
   \[
   A = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height}
   \]

2. **Identify the Given Values:**

   From the problem, we know:
   - The base of the triangle \( b = 10 \) units
   - The height of the triangle \( h = 5 \) units

3. **Substitute the Given Values into the Formula:**

   Substitute \( b = 10 \) and \( h = 5 \) into the area formula:
   \[
   A = \frac{1}{2} \times 10 \times 5
   \]

4. **Perform the Multiplication:**

   First, multiply the base and the height:
   \[
   10 \times 5 = 50
   \]

5. **Calculate the Area:**

   Now, multiply by \(\frac{1}{2}\):
   \[
   A = \frac{1}{2} \times 50 = 25
   \]

6. **State the Final Answer:**

   The area of the triangle is \( 25 \) square units.

By following these steps, we have calculated the area of the triangle using the given base and height. The final answer is \( 25 \) square units.
