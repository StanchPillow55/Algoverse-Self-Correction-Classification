==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to determine the total number of gems in the treasure chest, which includes diamonds, rubies, and emeralds.

1. **Identify the number of diamonds**:
   The problem states that there are 175 diamonds.

   \[
   \text{Diamonds} = 175
   \]

2. **Calculate the number of rubies**:
   The problem states that there are 35 fewer rubies than diamonds. Therefore, we can calculate the number of rubies as follows:

   \[
   \text{Rubies} = \text{Diamonds} - 35 = 175 - 35 = 140
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of emeralds**:
   The problem states that there are twice the number of emeralds than the rubies. Thus, we can calculate the number of emeralds as follows:

   \[
   \text{Emeralds} = 2 \times \text{Rubies} = 2 \times 140 = 280
   \]

4. **Calculate the total number of gems**:
   Now, we can find the total number of gems by adding the number of diamonds, rubies, and emeralds together:

   \[
   \text{Total Gems} = \text{Diamonds} + \text{Rubies} + \text{Emeralds}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total Gems} = 175 + 140 + 280
   \]

   Performing the addition step-by-step:

   - First, add diamonds and rubies:
     \[
     175 + 140 = 315
     \]

   - Next, add the emeralds:
     \[
     315 + 280 = 595
     \]

5. **Final Answer**:
   Therefore, the total number of gems in the chest is:

   \[
   \boxed{595}
   \]
