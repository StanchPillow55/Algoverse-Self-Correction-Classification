==================================================

First, let's calculate how many miles Jesse and Mia have already run.

Jesse:
For the first three days, Jesse averages 2/3 of a mile. So, she runs (2/3) * 3 = 2 miles in the first three days.
On the fourth day, she runs 10 miles.
So, in total, Jesse has run 2 + 10 = 12 miles.

Mia:
Mia averages 3 miles a day over the first 4 days. So, she runs 3 * 4 = 12 miles in the first four days.

Now, let's calculate how many miles they still have to run.

The total distance they have to run is 30 miles. So, Jesse still has to run 30 - 12 = 18 miles, and Mia still has to run 30 - 12 = 18 miles.

They have three days left to run these miles. So, on average, they have to run 18 / 3 = 6 miles a day.

Therefore, the average of their average that they have to run over the final three days is 6 miles.
