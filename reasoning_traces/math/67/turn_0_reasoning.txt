To solve the problem, we need to determine how many miles Jesse and Mia have run over the first four days and how many miles they have left to run in the final three days. Then we can calculate the average of their averages for the final three days.

### Step 1: Calculate Jesse's total miles for the first four days.

1. **First three days**: Jesse averages \( \frac{2}{3} \) of a mile per day.
   \[
   \text{Miles in first three days} = 3 \times \frac{2}{3} = 2 \text{ miles}
   \]

2. **Day four**: Jesse runs 10 miles.
   \[
   \text{Miles on day four} = 10 \text{ miles}
   \]

3. **Total miles for Jesse after four days**:
   \[
   \text{Total miles} = 2 + 10 = 12 \text{ miles}
   \]

### Step 2: Calculate Mia's total miles for the first four days.

1. **Mia averages 3 miles a day over the first four days**:
   \[
   \text{Miles in four days} = 4 \times 3 = 12 \text{ miles}
   \]

### Step 3: Calculate the total miles run by both Jesse and Mia after four days.

1. **Total miles run by both**:
   \[
   \text{Total miles} = \text{Jesse's miles} + \text{Mia's miles} = 12 + 12 = 24 \text{ miles}
   \]

### Step 4: Calculate the remaining miles to be run in the final three days.

1. **Total miles for the week**: 30 miles
2. **Miles left to run**:
   \[
   \text{Remaining miles} = 30 - 24 = 6 \text{ miles}
   \]

### Step 5: Calculate the average of their averages for the final three days.

1. **Average miles per day for Jesse over the final three days**:
   \[
   \text{Average for Jesse} = \frac{\text{Remaining miles}}{3} = \frac{6}{3} = 2 \text{ miles per day}
   \]

2. **Average miles per day for Mia over the final three days**:
   Since Mia has also run 6 miles over the final three days:
   \[
   \text{Average for Mia} = \frac{6}{3} = 2 \text{ miles per day}
   \]

### Step 6: Calculate the average of their averages.

1. **Average of Jesse's and Mia's averages**:
   \[
   \text{Average of averages} = \frac{\text{Average for Jesse} + \text{Average for Mia}}{2} = \frac{2 + 2}{2} = 2 \text{ miles per day}
   \]

### Final Answer:
The average of their averages that they have to run over the final three days is \( \boxed{2} \) miles per day.
