==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to determine how many miles Jesse and Mia have left to run after the first four days and then calculate the average of their averages for the final three days.

### Step 1: Calculate Jesse's total distance after 4 days

1. **Distance Jesse runs in the first 3 days:**
   - Average per day = \( \frac{2}{3} \) miles
   - Total for 3 days = \( 3 \times \frac{2}{3} = 2 \) miles

2. **Distance Jesse runs on day 4:**
   - Distance = 10 miles

3. **Total distance Jesse runs in 4 days:**
   \[
   \text{Total distance} = 2 \text{ miles} + 10 \text{ miles} = 12 \text{ miles}
   \]

### Step 2: Calculate Mia's total distance after 4 days

1. **Distance Mia runs in the first 4 days:**
   - Average per day = 3 miles
   - Total for 4 days = \( 4 \times 3 = 12 \) miles

### Step 3: Calculate total distance run by both after 4 days

1. **Total distance run by both:**
   \[
   \text{Total distance} = \text{Jesse's distance} + \text{Mia's distance} = 12 \text{ miles} + 12 \text{ miles} = 24 \text{ miles}
   \]

### Step 4: Calculate remaining distance to run

1. **Total distance of the race:**
   - Total distance = 30 miles

2. **Remaining distance to run:**
   \[
   \text{Remaining distance} = 30 \text{ miles} - 24 \text{ miles} = 6 \text{ miles}
   \]

### Step 5: Calculate average distance each needs to run over the final 3 days

1. **Average distance per day for the remaining 3 days:**
   \[
   \text{Average per day} = \frac{\text{Remaining distance}}{3} = \frac{6 \text{ miles}}{3} = 2 \text{ miles}
   \]

### Step 6: Calculate the average of their averages for the final 3 days

1. **Jesse's average for the final 3 days:**
   - Average = 2 miles

2. **Mia's average for the final 3 days:**
   - Average = 2 miles

3. **Average of their averages:**
   \[
   \text{Average of their averages} = \frac{\text{Jesse's average} + \text{Mia's average}}{2} = \frac{2 + 2}{2} = 2 \text{ miles}
   \]

### Final Answer

The average of their averages that they have to run over the final three days is \( \boxed{2} \) miles.
