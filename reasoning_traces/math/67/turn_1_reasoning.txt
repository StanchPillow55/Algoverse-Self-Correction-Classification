==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to determine how many miles Jesse and Mia have left to run after the first four days and then calculate the average of their averages for the final three days.

### Step 1: Calculate Jesse's total distance after 4 days

1. **Distance Jesse runs in the first 3 days:**
   - Average per day = \( \frac{2}{3} \) miles
   - Total for 3 days = \( 3 \times \frac{2}{3} = 2 \) miles

2. **Distance Jesse runs on day 4:**
   - Distance on day 4 = 10 miles

3. **Total distance Jesse runs in 4 days:**
   \[
   \text{Total distance} = 2 \text{ miles} + 10 \text{ miles} = 12 \text{ miles}
   \]

### Step 2: Calculate Mia's total distance after 4 days

1. **Distance Mia runs in the first 4 days:**
   - Average per day = 3 miles
   - Total for 4 days = \( 4 \times 3 = 12 \) miles

### Step 3: Calculate the total distance run by both after 4 days

1. **Total distance run by both:**
   \[
   \text{Total distance} = \text{Jesse's distance} + \text{Mia's distance} = 12 \text{ miles} + 12 \text{ miles} = 24 \text{ miles}
   \]

### Step 4: Calculate the remaining distance to run

1. **Total distance of the race:**
   - Total distance = 30 miles

2. **Remaining distance after 4 days:**
   \[
   \text{Remaining distance} = 30 \text{ miles} - 24 \text{ miles} = 6 \text{ miles}
   \]

### Step 5: Calculate the average distance each needs to run over the final 3 days

1. **Average distance per day for the final 3 days:**
   \[
   \text{Average distance} = \frac{\text{Remaining distance}}{3} = \frac{6 \text{ miles}}{3} = 2 \text{ miles}
   \]

### Step 6: Find the average of their averages for the final 3 days

1. **Jesse's average for the final 3 days:** 2 miles
2. **Mia's average for the final 3 days:** 2 miles

3. **Average of their averages:**
   \[
   \text{Average of averages} = \frac{\text{Jesse's average} + \text{Mia's average}}{2} = \frac{2 + 2}{2} = 2 \text{ miles}
   \]

### Final Answer
The average of their averages that they have to run over the final three days is \( \boxed{2} \) miles.
