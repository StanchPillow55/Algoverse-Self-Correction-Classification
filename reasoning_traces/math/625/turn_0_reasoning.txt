==================================================

To find out how many flowers in Arianna's garden have bloomed, we will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of flowers in the garden.**
   - Arianna has 10 rows of flowers, and each row contains 20 flowers.
   - To find the total number of flowers, we multiply the number of rows by the number of flowers per row:
     \[
     \text{Total flowers} = \text{Number of rows} \times \text{Flowers per row} = 10 \times 20
     \]
   - Performing the multiplication:
     \[
     10 \times 20 = 200
     \]
   - So, there are a total of 200 flowers in the garden.

2. **Determine how many of the flowers have bloomed.**
   - We know that currently, \( \frac{4}{5} \) of the planted flowers have bloomed.
   - To find the number of flowers that have bloomed, we multiply the total number of flowers by \( \frac{4}{5} \):
     \[
     \text{Bloomed flowers} = \frac{4}{5} \times \text{Total flowers} = \frac{4}{5} \times 200
     \]
   - Now, we calculate \( \frac{4}{5} \times 200 \):
     \[
     \frac{4}{5} \times 200 = \frac{4 \times 200}{5} = \frac{800}{5} = 160
     \]
   - Therefore, 160 flowers have bloomed.

3. **State the final answer.**
   - The number of flowers in Arianna's garden that have bloomed is \( \boxed{160} \).
