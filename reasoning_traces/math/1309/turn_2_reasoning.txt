Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to determine how much money each girl raised and then find the total amount raised by all of them. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Identify how much Alexandra raised:**
   - We know from the problem that Alexandra raised $430.

2. **Calculate how much Kim raised:**
   - The problem states that Kim raises $320 more than Alexandra. 
   - Therefore, we can calculate Kim's amount as follows:
     \[
     \text{Kim's amount} = \text{Alexandra's amount} + 320 = 430 + 320 = 750
     \]

3. **Identify how much Sarah raised:**
   - The problem states that Sarah raised $300.

4. **Calculate how much Maryam raised:**
   - The problem states that Maryam raises $400 more than Sarah. 
   - Therefore, we can calculate Maryam's amount as follows:
     \[
     \text{Maryam's amount} = \text{Sarah's amount} + 400 = 300 + 400 = 700
     \]

5. **Now, we have the amounts raised by each girl:**
   - Alexandra: $430
   - Kim: $750
   - Sarah: $300
   - Maryam: $700

6. **Calculate the total amount raised by all the girls:**
   - We add up all the amounts:
     \[
     \text{Total amount} = \text{Alexandra's amount} + \text{Kim's amount} + \text{Sarah's amount} + \text{Maryam's amount}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total amount} = 430 + 750 + 300 + 700
     \]

7. **Perform the addition step-by-step:**
   - First, add Alexandra and Kim:
     \[
     430 + 750 = 1180
     \]
   - Next, add Sarah's amount:
     \[
     1180 + 300 = 1480
     \]
   - Finally, add Maryam's amount:
     \[
     1480 + 700 = 2180
     \]

8. **Final answer:**
   - The total amount of money raised by all the girls is:
     \[
     \boxed{2180} \text{ dollars}
     \]
