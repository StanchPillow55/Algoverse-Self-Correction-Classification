To solve the problem, we need to determine how much money each girl raised and then find the total amount raised by all of them.

1. **Identify the amounts raised by Alexandra and Kim:**
   - Alexandra raises $430.
   - Kim raises $320 more than Alexandra. Therefore, we can calculate Kim's amount as follows:
     \[
     \text{Kim's amount} = \text{Alexandra's amount} + 320 = 430 + 320 = 750
     \]

2. **Identify the amounts raised by Sarah and Maryam:**
   - Sarah raises $300.
   - Maryam raises $400 more than Sarah. Therefore, we can calculate Maryam's amount as follows:
     \[
     \text{Maryam's amount} = \text{Sarah's amount} + 400 = 300 + 400 = 700
     \]

3. **Now we have the amounts raised by each girl:**
   - Alexandra: $430
   - Kim: $750
   - Sarah: $300
   - Maryam: $700

4. **Calculate the total amount raised by all the girls:**
   We add all the amounts together:
   \[
   \text{Total amount} = \text{Alexandra's amount} + \text{Kim's amount} + \text{Sarah's amount} + \text{Maryam's amount}
   \]
   Substituting the values we found:
   \[
   \text{Total amount} = 430 + 750 + 300 + 700
   \]

5. **Perform the addition step by step:**
   - First, add Alexandra's and Kim's amounts:
     \[
     430 + 750 = 1180
     \]
   - Next, add Sarah's amount:
     \[
     1180 + 300 = 1480
     \]
   - Finally, add Maryam's amount:
     \[
     1480 + 700 = 2180
     \]

6. **Final answer:**
   The total amount of money raised by all the girls is:
   \[
   \boxed{2180} \text{ dollars}
   \]
