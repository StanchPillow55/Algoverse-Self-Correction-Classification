Question ID: 1309
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step, calculating how much each girl raised and then summing those amounts to find the total.

1. **Determine how much Alexandra raised**:
   - According to the problem, Alexandra raised $430.

2. **Determine how much Kim raised**:
   - Kim raised $320 more than Alexandra. Therefore, we can calculate Kim's amount as follows:
   \[
   \text{Kim's amount} = \text{Alexandra's amount} + 320 = 430 + 320 = 750
   \]

3. **Determine how much Sarah raised**:
   - The problem states that Sarah raised $300.

4. **Determine how much Maryam raised**:
   - Maryam raised $400 more than Sarah. We can calculate Maryam's amount as follows:
   \[
   \text{Maryam's amount} = \text{Sarah's amount} + 400 = 300 + 400 = 700
   \]

5. **Calculate the total amount raised by all girls**:
   - Now we will sum the amounts raised by Alexandra, Kim, Sarah, and Maryam:
   \[
   \text{Total amount} = \text{Alexandra's amount} + \text{Kim's amount} + \text{Sarah's amount} + \text{Maryam's amount}
   \]
   Substituting the values we found:
   \[
   \text{Total amount} = 430 + 750 + 300 + 700
   \]

6. **Perform the addition**:
   - First, add Alexandra's and Kim's amounts:
   \[
   430 + 750 = 1180
   \]
   - Next, add Sarah's amount:
   \[
   1180 + 300 = 1480
   \]
   - Finally, add Maryam's amount:
   \[
   1480 + 700 = 2180
   \]

Thus, the total amount of money raised by all the girls is \(\boxed{2180}\) dollars.
