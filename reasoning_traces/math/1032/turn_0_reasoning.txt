==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to establish the relationships between the different sizes of jelly beans based on the information provided.

1. **Large Jelly Beans**: Grandpa can eat 75 large jelly beans.

2. **Medium Jelly Beans**: It is stated that Grandpa can eat twice as many medium-sized beans as large beans. Therefore, the number of medium jelly beans he can eat is:
   \[
   \text{Medium beans} = 2 \times \text{Large beans} = 2 \times 75 = 150
   \]

3. **Small Jelly Beans**: The problem states that eating 3 small beans is equivalent to eating 1 medium-sized bean. This means that for every medium jelly bean, Grandpa can eat 3 small jelly beans. 

   Since we found that Grandpa can eat 150 medium jelly beans, we can calculate the number of small jelly beans he can eat by multiplying the number of medium beans by the number of small beans equivalent to one medium bean:
   \[
   \text{Small beans} = 3 \times \text{Medium beans} = 3 \times 150 = 450
   \]

Thus, the total number of small jelly beans that Grandpa can eat is 450.

Finally, we can state the answer clearly:

**Final Answer**: Grandpa can eat 450 small jelly beans.
