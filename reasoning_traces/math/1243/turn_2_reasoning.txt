==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to determine the cost per stick of beef jerky after Archie buys a bag that is discounted. Let's break down the steps:

1. **Determine the original price of the bag**: 
   The original price of a bag of beef jerky is $18.00.

2. **Calculate the discount**: 
   The problem states that there is a discount of $3.00 off the bag. 
   \[
   \text{Discounted Price} = \text{Original Price} - \text{Discount} = 18.00 - 3.00 = 15.00
   \]

3. **Determine the number of sticks in the bag**: 
   Each bag contains 30 sticks of beef jerky.

4. **Calculate the cost per stick**: 
   To find the cost per stick, we divide the total cost of the bag by the number of sticks in the bag.
   \[
   \text{Cost per stick} = \frac{\text{Discounted Price}}{\text{Number of sticks}} = \frac{15.00}{30}
   \]
   Performing the division:
   \[
   \frac{15.00}{30} = 0.50
   \]
   This means each stick of jerky costs $0.50.

5. **Convert the cost per stick to cents**: 
   Since the problem asks for the cost in cents, we convert dollars to cents by multiplying by 100.
   \[
   \text{Cost per stick in cents} = 0.50 \times 100 = 50 \text{ cents}
   \]

Finally, we conclude that the cost of each stick of jerky is **50 cents**.

**Final Answer**: 50 cents
