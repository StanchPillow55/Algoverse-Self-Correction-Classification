==================================================

To find out how much each stick of beef jerky costs in cents, we will follow these steps:

1. **Determine the discounted price of the bag of beef jerky.**
   - The original price of a bag is $18.00.
   - The discount is $3.00.
   - Therefore, the discounted price is calculated as follows:
     \[
     \text{Discounted Price} = \text{Original Price} - \text{Discount} = 18.00 - 3.00 = 15.00
     \]

2. **Calculate the cost per stick of jerky.**
   - Each bag contains 30 sticks of jerky.
   - To find the cost per stick, we divide the total cost of the bag by the number of sticks:
     \[
     \text{Cost per Stick} = \frac{\text{Discounted Price}}{\text{Number of Sticks}} = \frac{15.00}{30}
     \]

3. **Perform the division to find the cost per stick.**
   - Calculating the division:
     \[
     \frac{15.00}{30} = 0.50
     \]
   - This means each stick of jerky costs $0.50.

4. **Convert the cost per stick from dollars to cents.**
   - Since there are 100 cents in a dollar, we multiply the cost in dollars by 100:
     \[
     \text{Cost per Stick in Cents} = 0.50 \times 100 = 50 \text{ cents}
     \]

Thus, the final answer is that each stick of jerky costs **50 cents**.
