==================================================

To find out how much Tim paid for both his doctor's visit and his cat's visit, we will break down the costs step by step.

### Step 1: Calculate Tim's Doctor's Visit Cost

1. **Total Cost of Doctor's Visit**: $300
2. **Insurance Coverage**: 75% of the total cost

To find out how much the insurance covered, we calculate 75% of $300:

\[
\text{Insurance Coverage} = 0.75 \times 300 = 225
\]

Now, we can find out how much Tim has to pay after the insurance coverage:

\[
\text{Amount Tim Pays} = \text{Total Cost} - \text{Insurance Coverage}
\]
\[
\text{Amount Tim Pays} = 300 - 225 = 75
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the Cat's Visit Cost

1. **Total Cost of Cat's Visit**: $120
2. **Pet Insurance Coverage**: $60

To find out how much Tim has to pay for the cat's visit, we subtract the pet insurance coverage from the total cost:

\[
\text{Amount Tim Pays for Cat} = \text{Total Cost} - \text{Pet Insurance Coverage}
\]
\[
\text{Amount Tim Pays for Cat} = 120 - 60 = 60
\]

### Step 3: Calculate Total Amount Tim Paid

Now, we add the amounts Tim paid for both his doctor's visit and his cat's visit:

\[
\text{Total Amount Tim Pays} = \text{Amount Tim Pays for Doctor} + \text{Amount Tim Pays for Cat}
\]
\[
\text{Total Amount Tim Pays} = 75 + 60 = 135
\]

### Final Answer

Thus, the total amount that Tim paid for both his and his cat's visits is:

\[
\boxed{135}
\]
