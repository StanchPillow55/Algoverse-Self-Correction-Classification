To solve this problem, we need to calculate the out-of-pocket expenses Tim incurred for both his own doctor's visit and his cat's veterinary visit.

1. **Calculate Tim's out-of-pocket cost for his doctor's visit:**

   - The total cost of Tim's doctor's visit is $300.
   - His insurance covers 75% of this cost.

   First, we calculate the amount covered by insurance:
   \[
   \text{Insurance coverage} = 0.75 \times 300 = 225
   \]

   Next, we calculate the amount Tim has to pay out-of-pocket:
   \[
   \text{Out-of-pocket cost for Tim} = 300 - 225 = 75
   \]

2. **Calculate Tim's out-of-pocket cost for his cat's veterinary visit:**

   - The total cost of the cat's veterinary visit is $120.
   - His pet insurance covers $60 of this cost.

   We calculate the amount Tim has to pay out-of-pocket for the cat:
   \[
   \text{Out-of-pocket cost for the cat} = 120 - 60 = 60
   \]

3. **Calculate the total out-of-pocket cost for both visits:**

   We add the out-of-pocket costs for both Tim and his cat:
   \[
   \text{Total out-of-pocket cost} = 75 + 60 = 135
   \]

Therefore, the total amount Tim paid out-of-pocket for both his and his cat's visits is \(\boxed{135}\).
