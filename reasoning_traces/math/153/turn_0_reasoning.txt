Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how many french fries were in the pack when Dave bought it.

1. **Initial Consumption by Dave**: 
   Dave ate 14 french fries.

2. **Seagull's Consumption**: 
   The seagull ate half the amount of fries that Dave ate. 
   \[
   \text{Seagull's fries} = \frac{14}{2} = 7 \text{ fries}
   \]

3. **Total Fries Eaten by Dave and the Seagull**: 
   Now, we can calculate the total number of fries eaten by both Dave and the seagull:
   \[
   \text{Total eaten by Dave and Seagull} = 14 + 7 = 21 \text{ fries}
   \]

4. **Pigeons' Consumption**: 
   Three pigeons each ate 3 fries. 
   \[
   \text{Total eaten by pigeons} = 3 \times 3 = 9 \text{ fries}
   \]

5. **Total Fries Eaten So Far**: 
   Adding the fries eaten by the pigeons to the previous total:
   \[
   \text{Total eaten} = 21 + 9 = 30 \text{ fries}
   \]

6. **Remaining Fries After Pigeons**: 
   Let \( x \) be the total number of fries in the pack when Dave bought it. After the pigeons ate, the remaining fries are:
   \[
   \text{Remaining fries} = x - 30
   \]

7. **Raccoon's Consumption**: 
   The raccoon stole two-thirds of the remaining fries. The amount taken by the raccoon is:
   \[
   \text{Raccoon's fries} = \frac{2}{3} \times (x - 30)
   \]
   Thus, the remaining fries after the raccoon took his share is:
   \[
   \text{Remaining after raccoon} = (x - 30) - \frac{2}{3}(x - 30) = \frac{1}{3}(x - 30)
   \]

8. **Ants' Consumption**: 
   Finally, the ants carried off 1 french fry, leaving 5 behind. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
   \[
   \frac{1}{3}(x - 30) - 1 = 5
   \]

9. **Solving the Equation**: 
   First, add 1 to both sides:
   \[
   \frac{1}{3}(x - 30) = 6
   \]
   Now, multiply both sides by 3 to eliminate the fraction:
   \[
   x - 30 = 18
   \]
   Finally, add 30 to both sides:
   \[
   x = 48
   \]

Thus, the total number of french fries in the pack when Dave bought it is \( \boxed{48} \).
