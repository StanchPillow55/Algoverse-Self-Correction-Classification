==================================================

To solve the problem effectively, let's first clarify what "Sample reasoning question 328" might entail. Since the problem is not explicitly stated, I'll assume it's a typical math problem that requires logical reasoning and step-by-step calculations. 

Let's consider a hypothetical math problem that involves reasoning, such as solving a system of equations. Here's an example problem:

**Problem:**
Solve the following system of equations for \( x \) and \( y \):

1. \( 2x + 3y = 12 \)
2. \( 4x - y = 5 \)

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

**Step 1: Choose a method to solve the system.**

We can use either the substitution method or the elimination method. Here, I'll use the elimination method.

**Step 2: Align the equations for elimination.**

The given equations are:
1. \( 2x + 3y = 12 \)
2. \( 4x - y = 5 \)

To eliminate \( y \), we can multiply the second equation by 3 to align the coefficients of \( y \):

- Multiply the second equation by 3:
  \[
  3(4x - y) = 3(5)
  \]
  \[
  12x - 3y = 15
  \]

Now, the system of equations is:
1. \( 2x + 3y = 12 \)
2. \( 12x - 3y = 15 \)

**Step 3: Add the equations to eliminate \( y \).**

Add the two equations:
\[
(2x + 3y) + (12x - 3y) = 12 + 15
\]
\[
2x + 12x + 3y - 3y = 27
\]
\[
14x = 27
\]

**Step 4: Solve for \( x \).**

Divide both sides by 14:
\[
x = \frac{27}{14}
\]

**Step 5: Substitute \( x \) back into one of the original equations to find \( y \).**

Substitute \( x = \frac{27}{14} \) into the first equation:
\[
2\left(\frac{27}{14}\right) + 3y = 12
\]
\[
\frac{54}{14} + 3y = 12
\]

Convert \(\frac{54}{14}\) to a simpler form:
\[
\frac{54}{14} = \frac{27}{7}
\]

Subtract \(\frac{27}{7}\) from both sides:
\[
3y = 12 - \frac{27}{7}
\]

Convert 12 to a fraction with a denominator of 7:
\[
12 = \frac{84}{7}
\]

Subtract:
\[
3y = \frac{84}{7} - \frac{27}{7}
\]
\[
3y = \frac{57}{7}
\]

**Step 6: Solve for \( y \).**

Divide both sides by 3:
\[
y = \frac{57}{21}
\]

Simplify \(\frac{57}{21}\):
\[
y = \frac{19}{7}
\]

**Final Answer:**

The solution to the system of equations is:
\[
x = \frac{27}{14}, \quad y = \frac{19}{7}
\]

This completes the solution to the hypothetical problem. If you have a specific problem in mind, please provide the details, and I can solve that for you.
