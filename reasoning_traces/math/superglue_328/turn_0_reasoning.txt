==================================================

To solve the problem, I need more specific information about "Sample reasoning question 328." Since the question itself is not provided, I'll demonstrate how to approach a generic math problem by solving a sample problem step by step. Let's assume the problem is as follows:

**Problem:**  
A rectangle has a length that is twice its width. If the perimeter of the rectangle is 36 units, find the dimensions of the rectangle.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We have a rectangle with a length (L) and a width (W).
   - The length is twice the width: \( L = 2W \).
   - The perimeter of the rectangle is 36 units.

2. **Recall the Formula for Perimeter:**
   - The perimeter (P) of a rectangle is given by the formula:  
     \[ P = 2L + 2W \]

3. **Substitute the Known Values:**
   - We know \( P = 36 \) and \( L = 2W \).
   - Substitute \( L = 2W \) into the perimeter formula:  
     \[ 36 = 2(2W) + 2W \]

4. **Simplify the Equation:**
   - Simplify the expression:  
     \[ 36 = 4W + 2W \]
   - Combine like terms:  
     \[ 36 = 6W \]

5. **Solve for W:**
   - Divide both sides by 6 to solve for W:  
     \[ W = \frac{36}{6} \]
     \[ W = 6 \]

6. **Find the Length:**
   - Since \( L = 2W \), substitute \( W = 6 \) into the equation for L:  
     \[ L = 2 \times 6 \]
     \[ L = 12 \]

7. **Verify the Solution:**
   - Check the perimeter with the found dimensions:  
     \[ P = 2L + 2W = 2(12) + 2(6) = 24 + 12 = 36 \]
   - The calculated perimeter matches the given perimeter, confirming our solution is correct.

**Final Answer:**
- The width of the rectangle is 6 units, and the length is 12 units.
