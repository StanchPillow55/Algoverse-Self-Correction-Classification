Question ID: superglue_328
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand the context and the specific question being asked. However, the problem statement provided is "Sample reasoning question 328" which does not contain any specific mathematical problem or context to solve. 

Since there is no specific mathematical problem or context given, I will demonstrate a general approach to solving a typical math problem by creating a sample problem and solving it step by step.

**Sample Problem:**

Let's consider a sample math problem:

"Calculate the area of a triangle with a base of 10 units and a height of 5 units."

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We need to find the area of a triangle.
   - We are given the base (b) of the triangle as 10 units.
   - We are given the height (h) of the triangle as 5 units.

2. **Recall the Formula for the Area of a Triangle:**
   - The formula for the area (A) of a triangle is:
     \[
     A = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height}
     \]

3. **Substitute the Given Values into the Formula:**
   - Substitute \( b = 10 \) units and \( h = 5 \) units into the formula:
     \[
     A = \frac{1}{2} \times 10 \times 5
     \]

4. **Perform the Calculations:**
   - First, multiply the base and height:
     \[
     10 \times 5 = 50
     \]
   - Then, multiply by \(\frac{1}{2}\):
     \[
     A = \frac{1}{2} \times 50 = 25
     \]

5. **State the Final Answer:**
   - The area of the triangle is 25 square units.

**Final Answer:**
The area of the triangle is 25 square units.

In the absence of a specific problem statement, I created a sample problem and demonstrated the process of solving it. If you have a specific problem or context in mind, please provide more details so I can assist you accordingly.
