Question ID: 7
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial Weight of the Box**: 
   - Ken places a box on the scale. We don't know the weight of the box itself, so let's denote it as \( W \) pounds.

2. **Adding Jelly Beans**: 
   - Ken pours jelly beans into the box until the total weight reaches 2 pounds. Therefore, the weight of the jelly beans added is:
     \[
     2 - W \text{ pounds}
     \]

3. **Adding Brownies**: 
   - Ken then adds brownies that cause the weight to triple. The new weight is:
     \[
     3 \times 2 = 6 \text{ pounds}
     \]
   - The weight of the brownies added is:
     \[
     6 - 2 = 4 \text{ pounds}
     \]

4. **Adding More Jelly Beans**: 
   - Next, Ken adds another 2 pounds of jelly beans. The new total weight becomes:
     \[
     6 + 2 = 8 \text{ pounds}
     \]

5. **Adding Gummy Worms**: 
   - Finally, Ken adds enough gummy worms to double the weight. The new weight is:
     \[
     2 \times 8 = 16 \text{ pounds}
     \]

Now, we can summarize the total weight of the box of goodies:

- After adding jelly beans: 2 pounds
- After adding brownies: 6 pounds
- After adding more jelly beans: 8 pounds
- After adding gummy worms: 16 pounds

Thus, the final weight of the box of goodies is:
\[
\boxed{16} \text{ pounds}
\]
