Question ID: 7
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial Weight of the Box**: 
   Let the initial weight of the empty box be \( W \) pounds.

2. **Adding Jelly Beans**: 
   Ken pours jelly beans into the box until the total weight reaches 2 pounds. Therefore, we have:
   \[
   W + \text{weight of jelly beans} = 2
   \]
   This means the weight of the jelly beans is:
   \[
   \text{weight of jelly beans} = 2 - W
   \]

3. **Adding Brownies**: 
   Ken then adds brownies that cause the weight to triple. The new weight is:
   \[
   3 \times (W + (2 - W)) = 3 \times 2 = 6 \text{ pounds}
   \]
   So, after adding brownies, the total weight is now 6 pounds.

4. **Adding More Jelly Beans**: 
   Next, Ken adds another 2 pounds of jelly beans. The weight now becomes:
   \[
   6 + 2 = 8 \text{ pounds}
   \]

5. **Adding Gummy Worms**: 
   Finally, Ken adds gummy worms that double the weight. The new weight is:
   \[
   2 \times 8 = 16 \text{ pounds}
   \]

Now, we can summarize the final weight of the box of goodies:
\[
\text{Final weight} = 16 \text{ pounds}
\]

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{16}
\]
