==================================================

Let's break down the problem step by step, keeping track of the weight at each stage.

1. **Initial Weight of the Box**: 
   Let the initial weight of the empty box be \( W \) pounds. We don't know this value yet, but we will keep it as a variable.

2. **Adding Jelly Beans**:
   Ken pours enough jelly beans into the box to bring the total weight to 2 pounds. Therefore, we can write the equation:
   \[
   W + \text{weight of jelly beans} = 2
   \]
   This means the weight of the jelly beans added is:
   \[
   \text{weight of jelly beans} = 2 - W
   \]

3. **Adding Brownies**:
   Next, Ken adds enough brownies to triple the weight. The new total weight after adding the brownies is:
   \[
   3 \times (W + (2 - W)) = 3 \times 2 = 6 \text{ pounds}
   \]
   So, after adding the brownies, the weight of the box is now 6 pounds.

4. **Adding More Jelly Beans**:
   Ken then adds another 2 pounds of jelly beans. The new total weight becomes:
   \[
   6 + 2 = 8 \text{ pounds}
   \]

5. **Adding Gummy Worms**:
   Finally, Ken adds enough gummy worms to double the weight. The new total weight is:
   \[
   2 \times 8 = 16 \text{ pounds}
   \]

Now, we have calculated the final weight of the box of goodies. 

Thus, the final weight of the box of goodies is:
\[
\boxed{16} \text{ pounds}
\]
