==================================================

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Ken first adds jelly beans to the box until it weighs 2 pounds.

2. Then, he adds brownies, which triples the weight. This means the weight of the box is now 2 pounds * 3 = 6 pounds.

3. Next, he adds another 2 pounds of jelly beans, bringing the total weight to 6 pounds + 2 pounds = 8 pounds.

4. Finally, he adds gummy worms, which doubles the weight. This means the final weight of the box is 8 pounds * 2 = 16 pounds.

So, the final weight of the box of goodies is 16 pounds.
