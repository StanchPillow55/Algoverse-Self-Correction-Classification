==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to break it down into steps and calculate the total time it takes for Carla to download the 200 GB file, considering the interruption caused by the forced restart.

### Step 1: Calculate the amount of data downloaded before the restart

Carla can download at a rate of 2 GB per minute. We first need to determine how much of the file she has downloaded before the restart occurs.

The restart happens when she is 40% of the way through the download. We can calculate 40% of the total file size:

\[
\text{Amount downloaded before restart} = 0.40 \times 200 \text{ GB} = 80 \text{ GB}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the time taken to download 80 GB

Next, we calculate how long it takes Carla to download 80 GB at her download speed of 2 GB/minute:

\[
\text{Time to download 80 GB} = \frac{80 \text{ GB}}{2 \text{ GB/min}} = 40 \text{ minutes}
\]

### Step 3: Account for the forced restart

After downloading 80 GB, Windows forces a restart that takes 20 minutes. We need to add this time to the total time:

\[
\text{Total time before restart} = 40 \text{ minutes} + 20 \text{ minutes} = 60 \text{ minutes}
\]

### Step 4: Restart the download

After the restart, Carla has to start the download from the beginning. Therefore, she needs to download the entire 200 GB file again.

### Step 5: Calculate the time to download the entire file again

Since she has to download the full 200 GB again at the same rate of 2 GB/minute, we calculate the time for the full download:

\[
\text{Time to download 200 GB} = \frac{200 \text{ GB}}{2 \text{ GB/min}} = 100 \text{ minutes}
\]

### Step 6: Calculate the total time for the entire process

Now, we add the time taken before the restart (60 minutes) to the time taken to download the file again (100 minutes):

\[
\text{Total time} = 60 \text{ minutes} + 100 \text{ minutes} = 160 \text{ minutes}
\]

### Final Answer

The total time it takes for Carla to download the 200 GB file, considering the forced restart, is:

\[
\boxed{160 \text{ minutes}}
\]
