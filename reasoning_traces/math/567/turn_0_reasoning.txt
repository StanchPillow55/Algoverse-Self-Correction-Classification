==================================================

To solve the problem, we will break down the amounts Sharon received for each of her lost teeth step by step.

1. **First Tooth:**
   - For the first tooth, Sharon received $5.00.

2. **Next Three Teeth:**
   - For each of the next three teeth, Sharon received $1.00.
   - Therefore, for these three teeth, the total amount is:
     \[
     3 \text{ teeth} \times 1 \text{ dollar/tooth} = 3 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Last Two Teeth:**
   - For the last two teeth, the tooth fairy gave Sharon half the amount of money per tooth as she received for each of the previous three teeth.
   - Since Sharon received $1.00 for each of the previous three teeth, half of that amount is:
     \[
     \frac{1 \text{ dollar}}{2} = 0.50 \text{ dollars}
     \]
   - Therefore, for the last two teeth, the total amount is:
     \[
     2 \text{ teeth} \times 0.50 \text{ dollars/tooth} = 1 \text{ dollar}
     \]

4. **Total Amount:**
   - Now, we will add up all the amounts Sharon received:
     - Amount for the first tooth: $5.00
     - Amount for the next three teeth: $3.00
     - Amount for the last two teeth: $1.00
   - The total amount is:
     \[
     5.00 + 3.00 + 1.00 = 9.00 \text{ dollars}
     \]

Thus, the total amount of money that the tooth fairy left Sharon is \(\boxed{9.00}\) dollars.
