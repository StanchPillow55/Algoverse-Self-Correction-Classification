==================================================

To solve the problem, we will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the initial number of each type of Pokemon card.**
   - Fire type: 30
   - Grass type: 20
   - Water type: 40

2. **Determine the changes in the number of cards.**
   - James loses 8 water type cards:
     \[
     \text{New water type count} = 40 - 8 = 32
     \]
   - James buys 14 grass type cards:
     \[
     \text{New grass type count} = 20 + 14 = 34
     \]

3. **Calculate the total number of cards after these changes.**
   - Total cards = Fire type + Grass type + Water type
   - Using the updated counts:
     \[
     \text{Total cards} = 30 + 34 + 32
     \]
   - Performing the addition:
     \[
     \text{Total cards} = 30 + 34 = 64
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total cards} = 64 + 32 = 96
     \]

4. **Calculate the percentage chance that a randomly picked card will be a water type.**
   - The number of water type cards is now 32.
   - The percentage chance is calculated using the formula:
     \[
     \text{Percentage chance} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of water type cards}}{\text{Total number of cards}} \right) \times 100
     \]
   - Substituting the values:
     \[
     \text{Percentage chance} = \left( \frac{32}{96} \right) \times 100
     \]

5. **Perform the division and multiplication:**
   - First, calculate \( \frac{32}{96} \):
     \[
     \frac{32}{96} = \frac{1}{3} \approx 0.3333
     \]
   - Now multiply by 100 to convert to a percentage:
     \[
     0.3333 \times 100 \approx 33.33
     \]

6. **Round to the nearest integer:**
   - Rounding 33.33 gives us 33.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{33}
\] 

This means there is a 33% chance that a randomly picked card will be a water type card.
