==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of chairs in the hall by considering the number of chairs at each type of table.

1. **Determine the number of tables with 2 chairs:**
   - We know that half of the tables have 2 chairs each.
   - Total number of tables = 32
   - Half of these tables = \( \frac{32}{2} = 16 \)
   - Therefore, there are 16 tables with 2 chairs each.

2. **Determine the number of tables with 3 chairs:**
   - We are given that 5 tables have 3 chairs each.

3. **Determine the number of tables with 4 chairs:**
   - We need to find out how many tables have 4 chairs each.
   - Total tables = 32
   - Tables with 2 chairs = 16
   - Tables with 3 chairs = 5
   - Therefore, the remaining tables have 4 chairs each:
     \[
     32 - 16 - 5 = 11
     \]
   - So, there are 11 tables with 4 chairs each.

4. **Calculate the total number of chairs:**
   - **Chairs from tables with 2 chairs each:**
     \[
     16 \text{ tables} \times 2 \text{ chairs/table} = 32 \text{ chairs}
     \]
   - **Chairs from tables with 3 chairs each:**
     \[
     5 \text{ tables} \times 3 \text{ chairs/table} = 15 \text{ chairs}
     \]
   - **Chairs from tables with 4 chairs each:**
     \[
     11 \text{ tables} \times 4 \text{ chairs/table} = 44 \text{ chairs}
     \]

5. **Add up all the chairs:**
   \[
   32 \text{ chairs} + 15 \text{ chairs} + 44 \text{ chairs} = 91 \text{ chairs}
   \]

Therefore, the total number of chairs in the hall is \(\boxed{91}\).
