==================================================

To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step.

1. **Identify the number of tables with different numbers of chairs**:
   - We know there are a total of 32 tables in the hall.
   - Half of the tables have 2 chairs each. Since half of 32 is \( \frac{32}{2} = 16 \), there are 16 tables with 2 chairs.
   - There are 5 tables with 3 chairs each.

2. **Calculate the number of tables with 4 chairs**:
   - To find the number of tables with 4 chairs, we first need to determine how many tables have already been accounted for:
     - Tables with 2 chairs: 16
     - Tables with 3 chairs: 5
   - Adding these together gives us:
     \[
     16 + 5 = 21
     \]
   - Since there are 32 tables in total, the number of tables with 4 chairs is:
     \[
     32 - 21 = 11
     \]

3. **Calculate the total number of chairs**:
   - Now we will calculate the total number of chairs contributed by each type of table:
     - For the 16 tables with 2 chairs:
       \[
       16 \text{ tables} \times 2 \text{ chairs/table} = 32 \text{ chairs}
       \]
     - For the 5 tables with 3 chairs:
       \[
       5 \text{ tables} \times 3 \text{ chairs/table} = 15 \text{ chairs}
       \]
     - For the 11 tables with 4 chairs:
       \[
       11 \text{ tables} \times 4 \text{ chairs/table} = 44 \text{ chairs}
       \]

4. **Sum the total number of chairs**:
   - Now we add the number of chairs from each type of table:
   \[
   32 \text{ chairs (from 2-chair tables)} + 15 \text{ chairs (from 3-chair tables)} + 44 \text{ chairs (from 4-chair tables)} = 91 \text{ chairs}
   \]

5. **Final answer**:
   - Therefore, the total number of chairs in the hall is:
   \[
   \boxed{91}
   \]
