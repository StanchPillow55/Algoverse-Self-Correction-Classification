To solve the problem, we need to determine the total number of Pokemon cards James has after he loses some water type cards and buys some grass type cards. Then, we will calculate the percentage chance that a randomly picked card will be a water type.

### Step 1: Calculate the initial number of cards
James has the following types of cards:
- Fire type: 30
- Grass type: 20
- Water type: 40

To find the total number of cards initially, we add these numbers together:

\[
\text{Total initial cards} = \text{Fire type} + \text{Grass type} + \text{Water type}
\]
\[
\text{Total initial cards} = 30 + 20 + 40 = 90
\]

### Step 2: Adjust for lost and bought cards
James loses 8 water type cards and buys 14 grass type cards. We will adjust the counts accordingly.

**Water type cards after losing some:**
\[
\text{Water type after loss} = \text{Initial water type} - \text{Lost water type}
\]
\[
\text{Water type after loss} = 40 - 8 = 32
\]

**Grass type cards after buying some:**
\[
\text{Grass type after purchase} = \text{Initial grass type} + \text{Bought grass type}
\]
\[
\text{Grass type after purchase} = 20 + 14 = 34
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the new total number of cards
Now we need to calculate the new total number of cards after these adjustments:

\[
\text{Total cards after adjustments} = \text{Fire type} + \text{Grass type after purchase} + \text{Water type after loss}
\]
\[
\text{Total cards after adjustments} = 30 + 34 + 32 = 96
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the percentage chance of picking a water type card
To find the percentage chance that a randomly picked card will be a water type, we use the formula:

\[
\text{Percentage chance} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of water type cards}}{\text{Total number of cards}} \right) \times 100
\]

Substituting in the values we have:

\[
\text{Percentage chance} = \left( \frac{32}{96} \right) \times 100
\]

Calculating the fraction:

\[
\frac{32}{96} = \frac{1}{3} \approx 0.3333
\]

Now, multiplying by 100 to get the percentage:

\[
\text{Percentage chance} \approx 0.3333 \times 100 \approx 33.33
\]

### Step 5: Round to the nearest integer
Rounding 33.33 to the nearest integer gives us:

\[
\text{Rounded percentage chance} = 33
\]

### Final Answer
The percentage chance that a randomly picked card will be a water type is \( \boxed{33} \).
