Question ID: 226
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of chairs in the hall by considering the distribution of chairs across the tables.

1. **Identify the number of tables with each type of chair arrangement:**

   - We know there are a total of 32 tables.
   - Half of these tables have 2 chairs each. So, the number of tables with 2 chairs each is:
     \[
     \frac{32}{2} = 16 \text{ tables}
     \]
   - There are 5 tables with 3 chairs each.

2. **Determine the number of tables with 4 chairs each:**

   - Since 16 tables have 2 chairs each and 5 tables have 3 chairs each, the remaining tables must have 4 chairs each.
   - The number of tables with 4 chairs each is:
     \[
     32 - 16 - 5 = 11 \text{ tables}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total number of chairs:**

   - For the tables with 2 chairs each:
     \[
     16 \text{ tables} \times 2 \text{ chairs/table} = 32 \text{ chairs}
     \]
   - For the tables with 3 chairs each:
     \[
     5 \text{ tables} \times 3 \text{ chairs/table} = 15 \text{ chairs}
     \]
   - For the tables with 4 chairs each:
     \[
     11 \text{ tables} \times 4 \text{ chairs/table} = 44 \text{ chairs}
     \]

4. **Add up all the chairs to find the total:**

   - Total chairs = Chairs from tables with 2 chairs + Chairs from tables with 3 chairs + Chairs from tables with 4 chairs
   - Total chairs = \(32 + 15 + 44\)

5. **Perform the final addition:**

   \[
   32 + 15 = 47
   \]
   \[
   47 + 44 = 91
   \]

Therefore, the total number of chairs in the hall is \(\boxed{91}\).
