Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the initial counts of each type of card**:
   - Fire type: 30
   - Grass type: 20
   - Water type: 40

2. **Calculate the total number of cards before any changes**:
   \[
   \text{Total cards} = \text{Fire type} + \text{Grass type} + \text{Water type} = 30 + 20 + 40 = 90
   \]

3. **Account for the changes in the number of cards**:
   - James loses 8 water type cards:
     \[
     \text{New water type count} = 40 - 8 = 32
     \]
   - James buys 14 grass type cards:
     \[
     \text{New grass type count} = 20 + 14 = 34
     \]

4. **Calculate the new total number of cards after the changes**:
   \[
   \text{New total cards} = \text{Fire type} + \text{New grass type} + \text{New water type} = 30 + 34 + 32 = 96
   \]

5. **Calculate the percentage chance that a randomly picked card will be a water type**:
   - The number of water type cards is now 32.
   - The total number of cards is now 96.
   - The percentage chance is calculated as follows:
   \[
   \text{Percentage chance} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of water type cards}}{\text{Total number of cards}} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{32}{96} \right) \times 100
   \]

6. **Perform the division**:
   \[
   \frac{32}{96} = \frac{1}{3} \approx 0.3333
   \]

7. **Convert to percentage**:
   \[
   0.3333 \times 100 \approx 33.33
   \]

8. **Round to the nearest integer**:
   \[
   33.33 \text{ rounds to } 33
   \]

Therefore, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{33}
\] 

This means there is a 33% chance that a randomly picked card will be a water type.
