==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to determine the total number of chairs in the hall based on the distribution of tables and their respective number of chairs.

1. **Identify the number of tables with different chair counts**:
   - We know there are a total of 32 tables.
   - Half of the tables have 2 chairs each. Since half of 32 is 16, there are 16 tables with 2 chairs each.
   - There are 5 tables with 3 chairs each.
   - We need to find out how many tables have 4 chairs each.

2. **Calculate the number of tables with 4 chairs**:
   - We can find the number of tables with 4 chairs by subtracting the number of tables with 2 chairs and 3 chairs from the total number of tables:
     \[
     \text{Number of tables with 4 chairs} = \text{Total tables} - (\text{Tables with 2 chairs} + \text{Tables with 3 chairs})
     \]
     \[
     \text{Number of tables with 4 chairs} = 32 - (16 + 5) = 32 - 21 = 11
     \]

3. **Calculate the total number of chairs**:
   - Now we can calculate the total number of chairs contributed by each type of table:
     - For the tables with 2 chairs:
       \[
       \text{Chairs from 2-chair tables} = 16 \text{ tables} \times 2 \text{ chairs/table} = 32 \text{ chairs}
       \]
     - For the tables with 3 chairs:
       \[
       \text{Chairs from 3-chair tables} = 5 \text{ tables} \times 3 \text{ chairs/table} = 15 \text{ chairs}
       \]
     - For the tables with 4 chairs:
       \[
       \text{Chairs from 4-chair tables} = 11 \text{ tables} \times 4 \text{ chairs/table} = 44 \text{ chairs}
       \]

4. **Add all the chairs together**:
   - Now we can find the total number of chairs in the hall by adding the chairs from each type of table:
     \[
     \text{Total chairs} = \text{Chairs from 2-chair tables} + \text{Chairs from 3-chair tables} + \text{Chairs from 4-chair tables}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total chairs} = 32 + 15 + 44 = 91
     \]

5. **Final answer**:
   - Therefore, the total number of chairs in the hall is \( \boxed{91} \).
