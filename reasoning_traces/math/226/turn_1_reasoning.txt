==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of chairs in the hall by considering the distribution of chairs across the tables.

1. **Identify the number of tables with each type of chair arrangement:**

   - We know there are a total of 32 tables.
   - Half of the tables have 2 chairs each. Therefore, the number of tables with 2 chairs each is:
     \[
     \frac{32}{2} = 16 \text{ tables}
     \]

   - 5 tables have 3 chairs each.

   - The rest of the tables have 4 chairs each. To find the number of these tables, we subtract the number of tables with 2 chairs and the number of tables with 3 chairs from the total number of tables:
     \[
     32 - 16 - 5 = 11 \text{ tables}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total number of chairs for each type of table arrangement:**

   - For the tables with 2 chairs each:
     \[
     16 \text{ tables} \times 2 \text{ chairs/table} = 32 \text{ chairs}
     \]

   - For the tables with 3 chairs each:
     \[
     5 \text{ tables} \times 3 \text{ chairs/table} = 15 \text{ chairs}
     \]

   - For the tables with 4 chairs each:
     \[
     11 \text{ tables} \times 4 \text{ chairs/table} = 44 \text{ chairs}
     \]

3. **Add up all the chairs to find the total number of chairs in the hall:**

   \[
   32 \text{ chairs} + 15 \text{ chairs} + 44 \text{ chairs} = 91 \text{ chairs}
   \]

Therefore, the total number of chairs in the hall is \(\boxed{91}\).
