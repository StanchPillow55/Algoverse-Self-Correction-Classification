==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 388" entails. Since the problem statement is not explicitly provided, I'll assume it's a placeholder for a typical math problem. Let's create a hypothetical problem and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**

A company produces two products, A and B. The profit from each unit of product A is $5, and the profit from each unit of product B is $8. The company can produce a maximum of 100 units of product A and 150 units of product B per week. However, due to resource constraints, the total production of products A and B combined cannot exceed 200 units per week. How many units of each product should the company produce to maximize profit?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( x \) be the number of units of product A produced.
   - Let \( y \) be the number of units of product B produced.

2. **Objective Function:**
   - The profit function \( P \) can be defined as:
     \[
     P = 5x + 8y
     \]
   - We want to maximize \( P \).

3. **Constraints:**
   - The production constraints are:
     \[
     x \leq 100 \quad \text{(Product A constraint)}
     \]
     \[
     y \leq 150 \quad \text{(Product B constraint)}
     \]
     \[
     x + y \leq 200 \quad \text{(Total production constraint)}
     \]
   - Additionally, \( x \geq 0 \) and \( y \geq 0 \) since negative production is not possible.

4. **Graphical Solution:**
   - Plot the constraints on a graph with \( x \) on the horizontal axis and \( y \) on the vertical axis.
   - The feasible region is bounded by the lines \( x = 100 \), \( y = 150 \), and \( x + y = 200 \).

5. **Identify Corner Points:**
   - The corner points of the feasible region are where the lines intersect:
     - \( (0, 0) \)
     - \( (100, 0) \)
     - \( (0, 150) \)
     - \( (50, 150) \) from solving \( x + y = 200 \) with \( y = 150 \)
     - \( (100, 100) \) from solving \( x + y = 200 \) with \( x = 100 \)

6. **Evaluate the Objective Function at Each Corner Point:**
   - \( P(0, 0) = 5(0) + 8(0) = 0 \)
   - \( P(100, 0) = 5(100) + 8(0) = 500 \)
   - \( P(0, 150) = 5(0) + 8(150) = 1200 \)
   - \( P(50, 150) = 5(50) + 8(150) = 250 + 1200 = 1450 \)
   - \( P(100, 100) = 5(100) + 8(100) = 500 + 800 = 1300 \)

7. **Determine the Maximum Profit:**
   - The maximum profit occurs at the point \( (50, 150) \) with a profit of \( 1450 \).

**Final Answer:**
The company should produce 50 units of product A and 150 units of product B to maximize profit, resulting in a maximum profit of $1450.
