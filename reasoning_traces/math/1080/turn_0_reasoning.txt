==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to determine how many jellyfish are created by 5 springs in 4 hours, given that each spring creates 1 jellyfish every second.

### Step 1: Calculate the number of seconds in 4 hours

First, we need to convert hours into seconds. 

1 hour = 60 minutes  
1 minute = 60 seconds  

Thus, the number of seconds in 1 hour is:
\[
60 \text{ minutes/hour} \times 60 \text{ seconds/minute} = 3600 \text{ seconds/hour}
\]

Now, for 4 hours:
\[
4 \text{ hours} \times 3600 \text{ seconds/hour} = 14400 \text{ seconds}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the number of jellyfish produced by one spring in 4 hours

Since each spring creates 1 jellyfish every second, the number of jellyfish produced by one spring in 4 hours (or 14400 seconds) is:
\[
1 \text{ jellyfish/second} \times 14400 \text{ seconds} = 14400 \text{ jellyfish}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the total number of jellyfish produced by 5 springs

Now, since there are 5 springs, we multiply the number of jellyfish produced by one spring by the number of springs:
\[
14400 \text{ jellyfish/spring} \times 5 \text{ springs} = 72000 \text{ jellyfish}
\]

### Final Answer

Thus, the total number of jellyfish created by 5 springs working at the same rate in 4 hours is:
\[
\boxed{72000}
\]
