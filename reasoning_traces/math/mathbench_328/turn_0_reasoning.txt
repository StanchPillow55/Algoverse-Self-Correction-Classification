==================================================

It seems like there might be some confusion with the problem statement "Sample math problem 328." This doesn't provide specific details about the math problem to be solved. However, I can guide you through a generic approach to solving a math problem. If you have a specific problem in mind, please provide the details. For now, let's consider a sample math problem and solve it step by step.

### Sample Math Problem:
Let's solve the following problem:

**Problem:** Solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We are given a linear equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).
   - Our goal is to find the value of \( x \) that makes this equation true.

2. **Isolate the Variable:**
   - To solve for \( x \), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation.
   - Start by eliminating the constant term on the left side of the equation.

3. **Subtract 3 from Both Sides:**
   \[
   2x + 3 - 3 = 11 - 3
   \]
   \[
   2x = 8
   \]

4. **Divide by the Coefficient of \( x \):**
   - The coefficient of \( x \) is 2. Divide both sides of the equation by 2 to solve for \( x \).
   \[
   \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{8}{2}
   \]
   \[
   x = 4
   \]

5. **Verify the Solution:**
   - Substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies the equation.
   \[
   2(4) + 3 = 11
   \]
   \[
   8 + 3 = 11
   \]
   - Since both sides of the equation are equal, \( x = 4 \) is the correct solution.

### Final Answer:
The solution to the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \) is \( x = 4 \).
