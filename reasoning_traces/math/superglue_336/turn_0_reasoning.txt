==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 336" refers to. Since this is not a standard math problem or a known reference, I'll assume it's a placeholder for a specific type of reasoning or math question. Without specific details, I'll create a sample reasoning problem and solve it step by step.

Let's assume the problem is as follows:

**Problem:**
A company sells two products, A and B. The profit from selling one unit of product A is $5, and the profit from selling one unit of product B is $7. The company sold a total of 100 units of both products combined and made a total profit of $620. How many units of each product did the company sell?

**Solution:**

To solve this problem, we need to set up a system of equations based on the information given.

1. **Define the variables:**
   - Let \( x \) be the number of units of product A sold.
   - Let \( y \) be the number of units of product B sold.

2. **Set up the equations:**
   - From the problem, we know the total number of units sold is 100. Therefore, we have the equation:
     \[
     x + y = 100
     \]
   - We also know the total profit is $620. The profit from product A is $5 per unit, and from product B is $7 per unit. Therefore, we have the equation:
     \[
     5x + 7y = 620
     \]

3. **Solve the system of equations:**

   We have the following system of equations:
   \[
   \begin{align*}
   x + y &= 100 \quad \text{(Equation 1)} \\
   5x + 7y &= 620 \quad \text{(Equation 2)}
   \end{align*}
   \]

   First, solve Equation 1 for \( y \):
   \[
   y = 100 - x
   \]

   Substitute \( y = 100 - x \) into Equation 2:
   \[
   5x + 7(100 - x) = 620
   \]

   Simplify and solve for \( x \):
   \[
   5x + 700 - 7x = 620
   \]
   \[
   -2x + 700 = 620
   \]
   \[
   -2x = 620 - 700
   \]
   \[
   -2x = -80
   \]
   \[
   x = 40
   \]

   Now, substitute \( x = 40 \) back into the equation for \( y \):
   \[
   y = 100 - x = 100 - 40 = 60
   \]

4. **Verify the solution:**

   Check the total number of units:
   \[
   x + y = 40 + 60 = 100
   \]

   Check the total profit:
   \[
   5x + 7y = 5(40) + 7(60) = 200 + 420 = 620
   \]

   Both conditions are satisfied.

**Final Answer:**
The company sold 40 units of product A and 60 units of product B.
