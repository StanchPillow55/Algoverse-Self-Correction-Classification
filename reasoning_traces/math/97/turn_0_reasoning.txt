To determine how many books Nancy had on the book cart when she started, we will analyze the information provided step by step.

1. **Books shelved from the top section of the cart:**
   - History books: 12
   - Romance books: 8
   - Poetry books: 4

   We can calculate the total number of books shelved from the top section:

   \[
   \text{Total from top section} = \text{History books} + \text{Romance books} + \text{Poetry books}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total from top section} = 12 + 8 + 4 = 24
   \]

2. **Books on the bottom section of the cart:**
   - It is stated that half of the books on the bottom section were mystery books, which she put back into place. We do not know the total number of books in the bottom section yet, but we will denote the total number of books in the bottom section as \( x \). Therefore, the number of mystery books is \( \frac{x}{2} \).

   Since half of the books are mystery books, the other half (the remaining books) must also be \( \frac{x}{2} \).

3. **Remaining books shelved from the bottom section:**
   - Nancy shelved 5 Western novels and 6 biographies from the bottom section. Therefore, the total number of books shelved from the bottom section is:

   \[
   \text{Total shelved from bottom section} = \text{Western novels} + \text{Biographies}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total shelved from bottom section} = 5 + 6 = 11
   \]

4. **Setting up the equation:**
   - The total number of books in the bottom section is the sum of the mystery books and the books that were shelved (Western novels and biographies):

   \[
   x = \text{Mystery books} + \text{Shelved books}
   \]
   \[
   x = \frac{x}{2} + 11
   \]

5. **Solving for \( x \):**
   - To eliminate the fraction, we can multiply the entire equation by 2:

   \[
   2x = x + 22
   \]

   - Now, we can isolate \( x \):

   \[
   2x - x = 22
   \]
   \[
   x = 22
   \]

   This means there are 22 books in the bottom section of the cart.

6. **Calculating the total number of books on the cart:**
   - Now we can find the total number of books on the cart by adding the books from the top section and the bottom section:

   \[
   \text{Total books} = \text{Total from top section} + \text{Total from bottom section}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total books} = 24 + 22 = 46
   \]

Thus, the total number of books Nancy had on the book cart when she started is \( \boxed{46} \).
