Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to find out how many books Nancy shelved from the top section of the cart. We do this by adding the number of history, romance, and poetry books together:

12 history books + 8 romance books + 4 poetry books = 24 books

Next, we need to find out how many books Nancy shelved from the bottom section of the cart. We know that she shelved 5 Western novels and 6 biographies, so we add these together:

5 Western novels + 6 biographies = 11 books

However, we know that these 11 books were only half of the books on the bottom section of the cart, because the other half were mystery books that she put back into place. To find out the total number of books on the bottom section of the cart, we need to double the number of books she shelved:

11 books * 2 = 22 books

Finally, to find out how many books Nancy had on the book cart when she started, we need to add the number of books from the top section of the cart to the number of books from the bottom section of the cart:

24 books (top) + 22 books (bottom) = 46 books

So, Nancy had 46 books on the book cart when she started.
