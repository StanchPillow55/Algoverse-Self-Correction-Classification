==================================================

To solve "Sample math problem 284," we first need to understand what the problem is asking. Since the problem statement is not provided, let's assume a hypothetical math problem and solve it step by step. 

Let's assume the problem is:

**Problem:** Solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 2x + 5 = 13 \).

**Step 1: Understand the Equation**

The equation given is a linear equation in one variable. Our goal is to isolate \( x \) on one side of the equation to find its value.

**Step 2: Isolate the Variable**

To isolate \( x \), we need to perform operations that will leave \( x \) alone on one side of the equation. We start with the equation:

\[ 2x + 5 = 13 \]

**Step 3: Eliminate the Constant Term**

Subtract 5 from both sides of the equation to eliminate the constant term on the left side:

\[ 2x + 5 - 5 = 13 - 5 \]

This simplifies to:

\[ 2x = 8 \]

**Step 4: Solve for \( x \)**

Now, divide both sides of the equation by 2 to solve for \( x \):

\[ \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{8}{2} \]

This simplifies to:

\[ x = 4 \]

**Step 5: Verify the Solution**

To ensure our solution is correct, substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation:

\[ 2(4) + 5 = 13 \]

Calculate the left side:

\[ 8 + 5 = 13 \]

Since both sides of the equation are equal, our solution is verified.

**Final Answer:**

The solution to the equation \( 2x + 5 = 13 \) is \( x = 4 \).
