==================================================

To solve the problem, we first need to understand what "Sample math problem 284" refers to. Since the problem is not explicitly stated, I'll assume it's a generic math problem and demonstrate how to solve a typical math problem step by step. Let's consider a common algebra problem:

**Problem:** Solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).

**Step 1: Understand the Problem**

The equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \) is a linear equation in one variable, \( x \). Our goal is to find the value of \( x \) that makes this equation true.

**Step 2: Isolate the Variable**

To solve for \( x \), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We can do this by performing inverse operations.

1. **Subtract 3 from both sides** to eliminate the constant term on the left side:
   \[
   2x + 3 - 3 = 11 - 3
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   2x = 8
   \]

2. **Divide both sides by 2** to solve for \( x \):
   \[
   \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{8}{2}
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   x = 4
   \]

**Step 3: Verify the Solution**

To ensure our solution is correct, we substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation and check if both sides are equal.

Substitute \( x = 4 \) into \( 2x + 3 = 11 \):
\[
2(4) + 3 = 11
\]
Calculate the left side:
\[
8 + 3 = 11
\]
Since both sides are equal, our solution \( x = 4 \) is correct.

**Final Answer:**

The solution to the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \) is \( x = 4 \).
