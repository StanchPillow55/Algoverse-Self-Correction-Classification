==================================================

To solve the problem, I need more information about what "Sample math problem 284" entails. Since I don't have the specifics of this problem, I'll guide you through a general approach to solving math problems, and you can apply this method to your specific problem once you have the details.

### General Approach to Solving Math Problems

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - Read the problem carefully.
   - Identify what is being asked.
   - Determine what information is given and what needs to be found.

2. **Devise a Plan:**
   - Think about the mathematical concepts that might be applicable (e.g., algebra, geometry, calculus).
   - Consider similar problems you've solved before.
   - Choose a strategy (e.g., drawing a diagram, creating an equation, logical reasoning).

3. **Carry Out the Plan:**
   - Execute your chosen strategy step by step.
   - Perform calculations carefully.
   - Keep track of units and ensure consistency.

4. **Check Your Work:**
   - Review each step to ensure accuracy.
   - Verify that your solution makes sense in the context of the problem.
   - Check your calculations for errors.

5. **State the Final Answer:**
   - Clearly write down the final answer.
   - Include units if applicable.

### Example Problem and Solution

Let's solve an example problem to illustrate this approach:

**Example Problem:**
Solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).

**Step 1: Understand the Problem**
- We need to find the value of \( x \) that satisfies the equation.

**Step 2: Devise a Plan**
- We can isolate \( x \) by performing algebraic operations.

**Step 3: Carry Out the Plan**
- Start with the equation: \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).
- Subtract 3 from both sides to isolate the term with \( x \):
  \[
  2x + 3 - 3 = 11 - 3
  \]
  \[
  2x = 8
  \]
- Divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( x \):
  \[
  \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{8}{2}
  \]
  \[
  x = 4
  \]

**Step 4: Check Your Work**
- Substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation to verify:
  \[
  2(4) + 3 = 8 + 3 = 11
  \]
- The left side equals the right side, confirming our solution is correct.

**Step 5: State the Final Answer**
- The solution to the equation is \( x = 4 \).

Once you have the details of "Sample math problem 284," you can apply this structured approach to find the solution. If you provide the specific problem, I can help solve it directly.
