==================================================

To solve "Sample math problem 284," we first need to understand what the problem is asking. Since the problem statement is not provided, I'll create a hypothetical math problem based on the number 284 and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**
Determine if the number 284 is a perfect number.

**Step 1: Understand the Definition of a Perfect Number**
A perfect number is a positive integer that is equal to the sum of its proper divisors, excluding itself. For example, 6 is a perfect number because its divisors are 1, 2, and 3, and 1 + 2 + 3 = 6.

**Step 2: Find the Proper Divisors of 284**
To find the proper divisors of 284, we need to find all the numbers less than 284 that divide 284 evenly (without leaving a remainder).

1. Start with 1, which is a divisor of every integer.
2. Check divisibility by 2: 284 is even, so 2 is a divisor.
3. Check divisibility by 3: The sum of the digits of 284 is 2 + 8 + 4 = 14, which is not divisible by 3, so 3 is not a divisor.
4. Check divisibility by 4: The last two digits of 284 are 84, and 84 is divisible by 4, so 4 is a divisor.
5. Check divisibility by 5: 284 does not end in 0 or 5, so 5 is not a divisor.
6. Check divisibility by 6: Since 284 is not divisible by 3, it is not divisible by 6.
7. Check divisibility by 7: Divide 284 by 7 to see if it results in an integer. \( 284 \div 7 \approx 40.57 \), so 7 is not a divisor.
8. Check divisibility by 8: The last three digits of 284 are 284, and 284 is not divisible by 8, so 8 is not a divisor.
9. Continue this process up to the square root of 284, which is approximately 16.85. We only need to check divisibility up to 16.

Continuing this process, we find the divisors:
- 1
- 2
- 4
- 71 (since \( 284 \div 4 = 71 \))
- 142 (since \( 284 \div 2 = 142 \))

**Step 3: Sum the Proper Divisors**
Add the proper divisors of 284:
\[ 1 + 2 + 4 + 71 + 142 = 220 \]

**Step 4: Compare the Sum to the Original Number**
The sum of the proper divisors of 284 is 220, which is not equal to 284.

**Conclusion:**
Since the sum of the proper divisors of 284 is not equal to 284, 284 is not a perfect number.

**Final Answer:**
284 is not a perfect number.
