==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to determine how many glasses and plates Jeff has after the event, taking into account the items that were broken.

**Step 1: Calculate the initial quantities of glasses and plates.**

Jeff sent:
- 8 dozen glasses
- 4 dozen plates

First, we need to convert dozens into individual items. 

1 dozen = 12 items.

**Calculating the number of glasses:**
\[
8 \text{ dozen glasses} = 8 \times 12 = 96 \text{ glasses}
\]

**Calculating the number of plates:**
\[
4 \text{ dozen plates} = 4 \times 12 = 48 \text{ plates}
\]

**Step 2: Calculate the number of broken items.**

According to the problem:
- 10 glasses were broken.
- 6 plates were broken.

**Step 3: Calculate the remaining quantities of glasses and plates.**

**Calculating remaining glasses:**
\[
\text{Remaining glasses} = \text{Initial glasses} - \text{Broken glasses}
\]
\[
\text{Remaining glasses} = 96 - 10 = 86 \text{ glasses}
\]

**Calculating remaining plates:**
\[
\text{Remaining plates} = \text{Initial plates} - \text{Broken plates}
\]
\[
\text{Remaining plates} = 48 - 6 = 42 \text{ plates}
\]

**Step 4: State the final answer.**

After the event, Jeff has:
- 86 glasses
- 42 plates

Thus, the final answer is:
Jeff has **86 glasses and 42 plates** now.
