Question ID: 753
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we will first determine the total number of glasses and plates that Jeff initially sent to the event. Then, we will account for the broken items to find out how many glasses and plates he has left.

### Step 1: Calculate the initial quantities

1. **Glasses**:
   - Jeff sent 8 dozen glasses.
   - Since 1 dozen equals 12, we calculate the total number of glasses:
     \[
     8 \text{ dozen} \times 12 \text{ glasses/dozen} = 96 \text{ glasses}
     \]

2. **Plates**:
   - Jeff sent 4 dozen plates.
   - Again, using the conversion of dozen to individual items:
     \[
     4 \text{ dozen} \times 12 \text{ plates/dozen} = 48 \text{ plates}
     \]

### Step 2: Calculate the number of broken items

1. **Broken Glasses**:
   - Jeff had 10 glasses broken.

2. **Broken Plates**:
   - Jeff had 6 plates broken.

### Step 3: Calculate the remaining quantities

1. **Remaining Glasses**:
   - To find the remaining glasses, we subtract the number of broken glasses from the initial number of glasses:
     \[
     96 \text{ glasses} - 10 \text{ broken glasses} = 86 \text{ glasses}
     \]

2. **Remaining Plates**:
   - Similarly, we subtract the number of broken plates from the initial number of plates:
     \[
     48 \text{ plates} - 6 \text{ broken plates} = 42 \text{ plates}
     \]

### Final Calculation

Now we have the final counts of glasses and plates:

- Remaining glasses: 86
- Remaining plates: 42

### Final Answer

Jeff now has **86 glasses** and **42 plates**.
