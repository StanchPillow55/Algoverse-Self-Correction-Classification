To determine how many more years Lauren needs to work to save enough for her retirement, we will break the problem down into several steps.

### Step 1: Calculate Lauren's Annual Retirement Needs

Lauren plans to live on 40% of her current annual salary during retirement. Her current salary is $100,000.

\[
\text{Annual Retirement Needs} = 0.40 \times \text{Current Salary}
\]
\[
\text{Annual Retirement Needs} = 0.40 \times 100,000 = 40,000
\]

### Step 2: Calculate Total Retirement Savings Required for 20 Years

Lauren plans to retire for 20 years. Therefore, we need to calculate the total amount she will need to cover her retirement expenses over this period.

\[
\text{Total Retirement Savings Required} = \text{Annual Retirement Needs} \times \text{Retirement Period}
\]
\[
\text{Total Retirement Savings Required} = 40,000 \times 20 = 800,000
\]

### Step 3: Calculate Annual Savings from Paycheck

Lauren saves 20% of her paycheck. We can calculate her annual savings based on her current salary.

\[
\text{Annual Savings} = 0.20 \times \text{Current Salary}
\]
\[
\text{Annual Savings} = 0.20 \times 100,000 = 20,000
\]

### Step 4: Determine How Many Years Lauren Needs to Work to Save $800,000

To find out how many years Lauren needs to work to save the required amount of $800,000, we divide the total savings required by her annual savings.

\[
\text{Years Needed to Work} = \frac{\text{Total Retirement Savings Required}}{\text{Annual Savings}}
\]
\[
\text{Years Needed to Work} = \frac{800,000}{20,000} = 40
\]

### Conclusion

Lauren needs to work for **40 years** to save enough for her retirement. 

Thus, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{40}
\]
