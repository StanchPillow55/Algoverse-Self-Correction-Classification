Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we will break down the spending of both Lisa and Carly step by step.

### Step 1: Calculate Lisa's Spending

1. **T-shirts**: Lisa spends $40 on t-shirts.
   \[
   \text{Lisa's spending on t-shirts} = 40
   \]

2. **Jeans**: Lisa spends half of the amount she spent on t-shirts on jeans.
   \[
   \text{Lisa's spending on jeans} = \frac{40}{2} = 20
   \]

3. **Coats**: Lisa spends twice the amount she spent on jeans on coats.
   \[
   \text{Lisa's spending on coats} = 2 \times 20 = 40
   \]

4. **Total Spending by Lisa**: Now, we can calculate Lisa's total spending by adding her expenditures on t-shirts, jeans, and coats.
   \[
   \text{Total spending by Lisa} = 40 + 20 + 40 = 100
   \]

### Step 2: Calculate Carly's Spending

1. **T-shirts**: Carly spends a quarter of what Lisa spends on t-shirts.
   \[
   \text{Carly's spending on t-shirts} = \frac{40}{4} = 10
   \]

2. **Jeans**: Carly spends three times what Lisa spends on jeans.
   \[
   \text{Carly's spending on jeans} = 3 \times 20 = 60
   \]

3. **Coats**: Carly spends a quarter of what Lisa spends on coats.
   \[
   \text{Carly's spending on coats} = \frac{40}{4} = 10
   \]

4. **Total Spending by Carly**: Now, we can calculate Carly's total spending by adding her expenditures on t-shirts, jeans, and coats.
   \[
   \text{Total spending by Carly} = 10 + 60 + 10 = 80
   \]

### Step 3: Calculate Total Spending by Both

Now, we will add the total spending of Lisa and Carly to find out how much they spent together.
\[
\text{Total spending by both} = \text{Total spending by Lisa} + \text{Total spending by Carly}
\]
\[
\text{Total spending by both} = 100 + 80 = 180
\]

### Final Answer

Thus, the total amount spent by Lisa and Carly together is:
\[
\boxed{180}
\]
