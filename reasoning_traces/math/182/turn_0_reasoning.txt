==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount spent by both Lisa and Carly on t-shirts, jeans, and coats. Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Lisa's Spending:

1. **T-shirts:**
   - Lisa spends $40 on t-shirts.

2. **Jeans:**
   - Lisa spends half of the amount she spent on t-shirts on jeans.
   - Amount spent on jeans = \(\frac{1}{2} \times 40 = 20\) dollars.

3. **Coats:**
   - Lisa spends twice the amount she spent on t-shirts on coats.
   - Amount spent on coats = \(2 \times 40 = 80\) dollars.

4. **Total Spending by Lisa:**
   - Total = Amount spent on t-shirts + Amount spent on jeans + Amount spent on coats
   - Total = \(40 + 20 + 80 = 140\) dollars.

### Carly's Spending:

1. **T-shirts:**
   - Carly spends a quarter of what Lisa spent on t-shirts.
   - Amount spent on t-shirts = \(\frac{1}{4} \times 40 = 10\) dollars.

2. **Jeans:**
   - Carly spends 3 times what Lisa spent on jeans.
   - Amount spent on jeans = \(3 \times 20 = 60\) dollars.

3. **Coats:**
   - Carly spends a quarter of what Lisa spent on coats.
   - Amount spent on coats = \(\frac{1}{4} \times 80 = 20\) dollars.

4. **Total Spending by Carly:**
   - Total = Amount spent on t-shirts + Amount spent on jeans + Amount spent on coats
   - Total = \(10 + 60 + 20 = 90\) dollars.

### Total Spending by Lisa and Carly:

- Total spending = Total spent by Lisa + Total spent by Carly
- Total spending = \(140 + 90 = 230\) dollars.

Thus, the total amount spent by Lisa and Carly together is \(\boxed{230}\) dollars.
