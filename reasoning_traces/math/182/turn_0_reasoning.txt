Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Step 1: Calculate Lisa's Spending

1. **T-shirts**: Lisa spends $40 on t-shirts.
   \[
   \text{Lisa's spending on t-shirts} = 40
   \]

2. **Jeans**: Lisa spends half of the amount she spent on t-shirts on jeans.
   \[
   \text{Lisa's spending on jeans} = \frac{40}{2} = 20
   \]

3. **Coats**: Lisa spends twice the amount she spent on jeans on coats.
   \[
   \text{Lisa's spending on coats} = 2 \times 20 = 40
   \]

### Step 2: Total Spending for Lisa

Now, we can calculate Lisa's total spending:
\[
\text{Total spending by Lisa} = \text{T-shirts} + \text{Jeans} + \text{Coats}
\]
\[
\text{Total spending by Lisa} = 40 + 20 + 40 = 100
\]

### Step 3: Calculate Carly's Spending

1. **T-shirts**: Carly spends a quarter of what Lisa spent on t-shirts.
   \[
   \text{Carly's spending on t-shirts} = \frac{40}{4} = 10
   \]

2. **Jeans**: Carly spends three times what Lisa spent on jeans.
   \[
   \text{Carly's spending on jeans} = 3 \times 20 = 60
   \]

3. **Coats**: Carly spends a quarter of what Lisa spent on coats.
   \[
   \text{Carly's spending on coats} = \frac{40}{4} = 10
   \]

### Step 4: Total Spending for Carly

Now, we can calculate Carly's total spending:
\[
\text{Total spending by Carly} = \text{T-shirts} + \text{Jeans} + \text{Coats}
\]
\[
\text{Total spending by Carly} = 10 + 60 + 10 = 80
\]

### Step 5: Total Spending for Both

Finally, we can find the total spending by both Lisa and Carly:
\[
\text{Total spending by both} = \text{Total spending by Lisa} + \text{Total spending by Carly}
\]
\[
\text{Total spending by both} = 100 + 80 = 180
\]

### Final Answer

Thus, the total amount that Lisa and Carly spent together is:
\[
\boxed{180}
\]
