==================================================

To solve the problem, we will break down the spending of both Lisa and Carly step by step.

**Step 1: Calculate Lisa's spending.**

1. **T-shirts:** 
   - Lisa spends $40 on t-shirts.

2. **Jeans:** 
   - Lisa spends half of the amount she spent on t-shirts on jeans.
   - Half of $40 is:
     \[
     \frac{40}{2} = 20
     \]
   - So, Lisa spends $20 on jeans.

3. **Coats:** 
   - Lisa spends twice the amount she spent on jeans on coats.
   - Twice $20 is:
     \[
     2 \times 20 = 40
     \]
   - So, Lisa spends $40 on coats.

**Step 2: Calculate the total spending for Lisa.**
- Total spending by Lisa is the sum of her spending on t-shirts, jeans, and coats:
\[
40 + 20 + 40 = 100
\]
So, Lisa spends a total of $100.

**Step 3: Calculate Carly's spending.**

1. **T-shirts:** 
   - Carly spends a quarter of what Lisa spent on t-shirts.
   - A quarter of $40 is:
     \[
     \frac{40}{4} = 10
     \]
   - So, Carly spends $10 on t-shirts.

2. **Jeans:** 
   - Carly spends 3 times what Lisa spent on jeans.
   - Lisa spent $20 on jeans, so Carly spends:
     \[
     3 \times 20 = 60
     \]
   - So, Carly spends $60 on jeans.

3. **Coats:** 
   - Carly spends a quarter of what Lisa spent on coats.
   - Lisa spent $40 on coats, so Carly spends:
     \[
     \frac{40}{4} = 10
     \]
   - So, Carly spends $10 on coats.

**Step 4: Calculate the total spending for Carly.**
- Total spending by Carly is the sum of her spending on t-shirts, jeans, and coats:
\[
10 + 60 + 10 = 80
\]
So, Carly spends a total of $80.

**Step 5: Calculate the total spending for both Lisa and Carly.**
- The total spending by both Lisa and Carly is:
\[
100 + 80 = 180
\]

**Final Answer:**
Lisa and Carly spent a total of $180.
