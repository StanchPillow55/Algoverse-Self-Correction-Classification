Question ID: superglue_416
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what the question is asking. However, the question provided is "Sample reasoning question 416," which does not give us any specific mathematical problem to solve. It seems like there might be a misunderstanding or missing information in the question.

To proceed, let's assume that "Sample reasoning question 416" is a placeholder for a specific math problem. Since no details are provided, I will create a hypothetical math problem and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**
Let's assume the problem is: "If 416 is divided by a number, the result is 52. What is the number?"

**Step-by-step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We are given that when 416 is divided by a certain number, the result is 52.
   - We need to find this unknown number.

2. **Set Up the Equation:**
   - Let the unknown number be \( x \).
   - According to the problem, \(\frac{416}{x} = 52\).

3. **Solve for \( x \):**
   - To find \( x \), we can multiply both sides of the equation by \( x \) to get rid of the fraction:
     \[
     416 = 52x
     \]
   - Next, solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides by 52:
     \[
     x = \frac{416}{52}
     \]

4. **Perform the Division:**
   - Calculate \(\frac{416}{52}\):
     \[
     416 \div 52 = 8
     \]

5. **Verify the Solution:**
   - To ensure the solution is correct, check if dividing 416 by 8 gives 52:
     \[
     \frac{416}{8} = 52
     \]
   - Since this is true, our solution is verified.

6. **State the Final Answer:**
   - The number is \( \boxed{8} \).

This completes the solution to the hypothetical problem. If you have a specific problem in mind, please provide the details, and I will be happy to solve it for you.
