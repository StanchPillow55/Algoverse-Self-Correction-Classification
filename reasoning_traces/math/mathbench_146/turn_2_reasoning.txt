Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, I need more specific information about "Sample math problem 146." Since the problem is not provided, I'll demonstrate how to approach a generic math problem by solving an example problem step by step. If you have a specific problem in mind, please provide the details.

**Example Problem:**

Solve for \( x \) in the equation: \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We need to solve for \( x \) in the linear equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).

2. **Isolate the Variable:**
   - Our goal is to get \( x \) by itself on one side of the equation. We start by eliminating the constant term on the side with the variable.

3. **Subtract 3 from Both Sides:**
   \[
   2x + 3 - 3 = 11 - 3
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   2x = 8
   \]

4. **Divide by the Coefficient of \( x \):**
   - The coefficient of \( x \) is 2. To isolate \( x \), divide both sides of the equation by 2:
   \[
   \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{8}{2}
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   x = 4
   \]

5. **Verify the Solution:**
   - Substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies the equation:
   \[
   2(4) + 3 = 11
   \]
   Simplifying the left side:
   \[
   8 + 3 = 11
   \]
   Since both sides of the equation are equal, \( x = 4 \) is indeed the correct solution.

**Final Answer:**
The solution to the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \) is \( x = 4 \).
