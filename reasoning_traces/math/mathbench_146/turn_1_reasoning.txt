Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem effectively, I'll need more specific information about "Sample math problem 146." Since the problem isn't provided, I'll demonstrate how to approach a generic math problem step by step. Let's assume a sample problem:

**Problem:** Solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).

**Step 1: Understand the Problem**
The equation given is a simple linear equation in one variable, \( x \). Our goal is to find the value of \( x \) that makes the equation true.

**Step 2: Isolate the Variable**
To solve for \( x \), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We can do this by performing inverse operations.

**Step 3: Perform Inverse Operations**
1. **Subtract 3 from both sides:**  
   \[
   2x + 3 - 3 = 11 - 3
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   2x = 8
   \]

2. **Divide both sides by 2:**  
   \[
   \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{8}{2}
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   x = 4
   \]

**Step 4: Verify the Solution**
Substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies the equation:
\[
2(4) + 3 = 11
\]
\[
8 + 3 = 11
\]
\[
11 = 11
\]
The left side equals the right side, confirming that our solution is correct.

**Final Answer:**
The solution to the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \) is \( x = 4 \).

This approach can be applied to a wide range of algebraic problems by following similar steps: understanding the problem, isolating the variable, performing inverse operations, and verifying the solution. If you have a specific problem (like "Sample math problem 146"), please provide the details, and I can solve it using a similar method.
