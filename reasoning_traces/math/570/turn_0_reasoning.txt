==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to determine how much Peter spends each day and how many action figures he can buy with his total budget of $70 over the course of one week (7 days).

### Step 1: Determine Daily Spending
Peter wants to spend an equal amount each day for one week. Since there are 7 days in a week, we can calculate his daily spending as follows:

\[
\text{Daily Spending} = \frac{\text{Total Money}}{\text{Number of Days}} = \frac{70}{7} = 10
\]

So, Peter spends $10 each day.

### Step 2: Calculate Spending from Sunday to Wednesday
From Sunday through Wednesday, Peter spends his money on wooden action figures that cost $5 each. He spends $10 each day for 4 days (Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday).

The total amount spent from Sunday to Wednesday is:

\[
\text{Total Spending (Sun-Wed)} = 10 \times 4 = 40
\]

Now, we can calculate how many wooden action figures he buys during these days:

\[
\text{Number of Wooden Action Figures} = \frac{\text{Total Spending (Sun-Wed)}}{\text{Cost per Wooden Figure}} = \frac{40}{5} = 8
\]

### Step 3: Calculate Spending from Thursday to Saturday
For the rest of the week (Thursday, Friday, Saturday), Peter spends $10 each day on plastic action figures that cost $2 each. He spends $10 each day for 3 days.

The total amount spent from Thursday to Saturday is:

\[
\text{Total Spending (Thu-Sat)} = 10 \times 3 = 30
\]

Now, we can calculate how many plastic action figures he buys during these days:

\[
\text{Number of Plastic Action Figures} = \frac{\text{Total Spending (Thu-Sat)}}{\text{Cost per Plastic Figure}} = \frac{30}{2} = 15
\]

### Step 4: Calculate Total Action Figures
Now, we can find the total number of action figures Peter has by adding the number of wooden action figures and plastic action figures:

\[
\text{Total Action Figures} = \text{Number of Wooden Action Figures} + \text{Number of Plastic Action Figures} = 8 + 15 = 23
\]

### Final Answer
Peter will have a total of **23 action figures** by the end of the week.
