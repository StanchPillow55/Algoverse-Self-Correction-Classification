To determine how long the tree has grown from the end of 2017 until the end of 2019, we first need to calculate the height of the tree at the end of each year, given that it grows by 10% of its previous height each year.

1. **Initial Height (End of 2017)**:
   - The height of the tree at the end of 2017 is given as 100 meters.

2. **Growth Calculation for 2018**:
   - The tree grows by 10% of its height at the end of 2017.
   - Growth in 2018 = 10% of 100 meters = 0.10 × 100 = 10 meters.
   - Therefore, the height at the end of 2018 = Height at end of 2017 + Growth in 2018
   - Height at end of 2018 = 100 + 10 = 110 meters.

3. **Growth Calculation for 2019**:
   - Now we calculate the growth for 2019 based on the new height at the end of 2018.
   - Growth in 2019 = 10% of 110 meters = 0.10 × 110 = 11 meters.
   - Therefore, the height at the end of 2019 = Height at end of 2018 + Growth in 2019
   - Height at end of 2019 = 110 + 11 = 121 meters.

4. **Duration of Growth**:
   - The tree has grown from the end of 2017 until the end of 2019.
   - This is a period of 2 years (2018 and 2019).

In conclusion, the tree has grown for a total of **2 years** from the end of 2017 until the end of 2019. 

Final answer: **2 years**.
