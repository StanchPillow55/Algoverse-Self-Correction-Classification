==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to establish the relationships between the quantities of flowers Sandra ordered. Let's denote the number of white carnations as \( x \).

1. **Determine the number of red roses:**
   According to the problem, Sandra ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations. Therefore, the number of red roses can be expressed as:
   \[
   \text{Number of red roses} = 4x
   \]

2. **Determine the number of pink calla lilies:**
   The problem states that Sandra ordered 200 pink calla lilies, which were five times the number of white carnations. We can set up the equation for pink calla lilies as follows:
   \[
   \text{Number of pink calla lilies} = 5x
   \]
   Since we know that the number of pink calla lilies is 200, we can set up the equation:
   \[
   5x = 200
   \]

3. **Solve for \( x \):**
   To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 5:
   \[
   x = \frac{200}{5} = 40
   \]
   So, the number of white carnations \( x \) is 40.

4. **Calculate the number of red roses:**
   Now that we have \( x \), we can find the number of red roses:
   \[
   \text{Number of red roses} = 4x = 4 \times 40 = 160
   \]

5. **Final answer:**
   Therefore, the number of red roses that Fred must deliver by 5 pm to satisfy Sandra is:
   \[
   \boxed{160}
   \]
