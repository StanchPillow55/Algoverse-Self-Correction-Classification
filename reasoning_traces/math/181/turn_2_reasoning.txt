==================================================

To determine how long the tree has grown from the end of 2017 until the end of 2019, we first need to calculate the height of the tree at the end of each year from 2017 to 2019, given that it grows by 10% each year.

1. **Initial Height (End of 2017)**: 
   - The tree's height at the end of 2017 is 100 meters.

2. **Growth Calculation for 2018**:
   - The tree grows by 10% of its height at the end of 2017.
   - Growth in 2018 = 10% of 100 meters = 0.10 × 100 = 10 meters.
   - Height at the end of 2018 = Initial height + Growth = 100 + 10 = 110 meters.

3. **Growth Calculation for 2019**:
   - The tree now grows by 10% of its height at the end of 2018.
   - Growth in 2019 = 10% of 110 meters = 0.10 × 110 = 11 meters.
   - Height at the end of 2019 = Height at the end of 2018 + Growth = 110 + 11 = 121 meters.

4. **Total Growth from 2017 to 2019**:
   - The tree has grown from 100 meters to 121 meters.
   - Total growth = Height at the end of 2019 - Height at the end of 2017 = 121 - 100 = 21 meters.

5. **Duration of Growth**:
   - The tree has grown from the end of 2017 until the end of 2019, which is a span of 2 years (2018 and 2019).

**Final Answer**: The tree has grown for 2 years from the end of 2017 until the end of 2019.
