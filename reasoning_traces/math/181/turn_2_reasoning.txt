Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the height of the tree at the end of each year from 2017 to 2019, given that it grows by 10% of its previous height each year. We will then determine how much it has grown over this period.

### Step-by-Step Calculation:

1. **Initial Height at the End of 2017:**
   - The tree's height at the end of 2017 is given as 100 meters.

2. **Height at the End of 2018:**
   - The tree grows by 10% of its height at the end of 2017.
   - Growth in 2018 = 10% of 100 meters = \(0.10 \times 100 = 10\) meters.
   - Height at the end of 2018 = Initial height + Growth in 2018 = \(100 + 10 = 110\) meters.

3. **Height at the End of 2019:**
   - The tree grows by 10% of its height at the end of 2018.
   - Growth in 2019 = 10% of 110 meters = \(0.10 \times 110 = 11\) meters.
   - Height at the end of 2019 = Height at the end of 2018 + Growth in 2019 = \(110 + 11 = 121\) meters.

4. **Total Growth from the End of 2017 to the End of 2019:**
   - Total growth = Height at the end of 2019 - Initial height at the end of 2017
   - Total growth = \(121 - 100 = 21\) meters.

### Final Answer:
The tree has grown 21 meters from the end of 2017 until the end of 2019.
