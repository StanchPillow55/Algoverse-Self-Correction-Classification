==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of money Jim will owe from loans and the total income he will lose while attending college. Then, we will determine how long it will take him to earn back that amount after he graduates.

### Step 1: Calculate the total loans taken during college

Jim takes out $50,000 in loans per year for 4 years. Therefore, the total loans he will accumulate is:

\[
\text{Total Loans} = \text{Loan per year} \times \text{Number of years}
\]
\[
\text{Total Loans} = 50,000 \times 4 = 200,000
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the income lost while in college

Before college, Jim was earning $25,000 per year. Since he is in college for 4 years, the total income he would have earned if he had worked instead of going to college is:

\[
\text{Total Lost Income} = \text{Income per year} \times \text{Number of years}
\]
\[
\text{Total Lost Income} = 25,000 \times 4 = 100,000
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the total cost of college

The total cost of college includes both the loans and the lost income:

\[
\text{Total Cost} = \text{Total Loans} + \text{Total Lost Income}
\]
\[
\text{Total Cost} = 200,000 + 100,000 = 300,000
\]

### Step 4: Calculate Jim's income after graduating

After graduating, Jim's income triples due to his college degree. Therefore, his new income will be:

\[
\text{New Income} = 3 \times \text{Old Income}
\]
\[
\text{New Income} = 3 \times 25,000 = 75,000
\]

### Step 5: Determine how long it will take to earn back the total cost

To find out how long it will take Jim to earn back the total cost of college, we need to divide the total cost by his new income:

\[
\text{Time to Earn Back} = \frac{\text{Total Cost}}{\text{New Income}}
\]
\[
\text{Time to Earn Back} = \frac{300,000}{75,000} = 4
\]

### Final Answer

It will take Jim **4 years** to earn back the money equivalent to the loans and the money lost from not working while in school.
