To find out how many minutes it will take Max to watch both movies, we first need to convert the lengths of each movie from hours and minutes into just minutes. 

1. **Convert the first movie's length:**
   - The first movie is 1 hour and 30 minutes long.
   - We know that 1 hour is equal to 60 minutes.
   - Therefore, we convert the first movie's length into minutes:
     \[
     1 \text{ hour} = 60 \text{ minutes}
     \]
     \[
     30 \text{ minutes} = 30 \text{ minutes}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total for the first movie} = 60 \text{ minutes} + 30 \text{ minutes} = 90 \text{ minutes}
     \]

2. **Convert the second movie's length:**
   - The second movie is 2 hours and 5 minutes long.
   - Again, we convert the hours into minutes:
     \[
     2 \text{ hours} = 2 \times 60 \text{ minutes} = 120 \text{ minutes}
     \]
     \[
     5 \text{ minutes} = 5 \text{ minutes}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total for the second movie} = 120 \text{ minutes} + 5 \text{ minutes} = 125 \text{ minutes}
     \]

3. **Add the lengths of both movies together:**
   - Now we add the total minutes of both movies:
     \[
     \text{Total time for both movies} = 90 \text{ minutes} + 125 \text{ minutes}
     \]
     \[
     = 215 \text{ minutes}
     \]

Thus, the total time it will take Max to watch both movies is **215 minutes**.

Final answer: **215 minutes**.
