==================================================

To determine how much Winwin was able to take home after winning the lottery, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the tax amount**: 
   Winwin won $50 and has to pay 20% of that amount as tax. 

   \[
   \text{Tax amount} = 20\% \text{ of } 50 = \frac{20}{100} \times 50
   \]

   Calculating this:

   \[
   \text{Tax amount} = 0.20 \times 50 = 10
   \]

   So, Winwin pays $10 in taxes.

2. **Calculate the amount after tax**: 
   We subtract the tax amount from the total winnings.

   \[
   \text{Amount after tax} = \text{Total winnings} - \text{Tax amount}
   \]

   Substituting the values we have:

   \[
   \text{Amount after tax} = 50 - 10 = 40
   \]

   So, after paying the tax, Winwin has $40 left.

3. **Subtract the processing fee**: 
   Winwin also has to pay a processing fee of $5. We need to subtract this fee from the amount after tax.

   \[
   \text{Final amount} = \text{Amount after tax} - \text{Processing fee}
   \]

   Substituting the values:

   \[
   \text{Final amount} = 40 - 5 = 35
   \]

Thus, after paying the tax and the processing fee, Winwin is able to take home **$35**.

**Final Answer**: Winwin was able to take home $35.
