To determine how much Winwin was able to take home from her lottery winnings, we need to account for both the tax and the processing fee. Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Winnings:**
   - Winwin won $50 in the lottery.

2. **Calculate the Tax:**
   - The tax rate is 20%.
   - To find the amount of tax she needs to pay, we calculate 20% of $50.
   - The formula to calculate the percentage of a number is:
     \[
     \text{Tax} = \text{Winnings} \times \left(\frac{\text{Tax Rate}}{100}\right)
     \]
   - Substituting the given values:
     \[
     \text{Tax} = 50 \times \left(\frac{20}{100}\right) = 50 \times 0.20 = 10
     \]
   - So, the tax amount is $10.

3. **Subtract the Tax from the Winnings:**
   - After paying the tax, the remaining amount is:
     \[
     \text{Remaining After Tax} = \text{Winnings} - \text{Tax} = 50 - 10 = 40
     \]

4. **Subtract the Processing Fee:**
   - The processing fee is $5.
   - Subtract the processing fee from the remaining amount after tax:
     \[
     \text{Take Home Amount} = \text{Remaining After Tax} - \text{Processing Fee} = 40 - 5 = 35
     \]

5. **Final Answer:**
   - After accounting for both the tax and the processing fee, Winwin is able to take home $35.

Therefore, the final amount Winwin takes home is \(\boxed{35}\).
