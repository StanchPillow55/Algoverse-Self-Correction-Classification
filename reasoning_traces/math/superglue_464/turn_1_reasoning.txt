==================================================

To solve the problem effectively, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 464" entails. Since the problem statement is not explicitly provided, I'll demonstrate a general approach to solving a typical math reasoning problem. Let's assume a hypothetical math problem and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**

A farmer has a rectangular field that is 100 meters long and 60 meters wide. He wants to divide the field into smaller rectangular sections, each with an area of 200 square meters, to plant different crops. How many such sections can he create?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We have a rectangular field with dimensions 100 meters by 60 meters.
   - We need to divide this field into smaller sections, each with an area of 200 square meters.

2. **Calculate the Total Area of the Field:**
   - The area of a rectangle is given by the formula: Area = Length × Width.
   - For the farmer's field: Area = 100 meters × 60 meters = 6000 square meters.

3. **Determine the Number of Sections:**
   - Each section must have an area of 200 square meters.
   - To find the number of sections, divide the total area of the field by the area of one section.
   - Number of sections = Total Area / Area of one section = 6000 square meters / 200 square meters = 30 sections.

4. **Verify the Solution:**
   - Each section is 200 square meters, and we have calculated that 30 such sections can be created.
   - Multiplying the number of sections by the area of each section should give us the total area of the field: 30 sections × 200 square meters/section = 6000 square meters.
   - This matches the total area of the field, confirming our solution is correct.

5. **State the Final Answer:**
   - The farmer can create 30 sections, each with an area of 200 square meters.

This step-by-step approach ensures that we understand the problem, perform the necessary calculations, and verify our solution. If you have a specific problem or need further assistance, please provide additional details.
