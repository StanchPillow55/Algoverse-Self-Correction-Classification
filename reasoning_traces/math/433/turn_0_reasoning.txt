==================================================

To find out how much Michael earned from selling his paintings, we will calculate the total earnings from both large and small paintings separately and then sum them up.

1. **Identify the prices and quantities:**
   - Price of a large painting = $100
   - Price of a small painting = $80
   - Number of large paintings sold = 5
   - Number of small paintings sold = 8

2. **Calculate the earnings from large paintings:**
   \[
   \text{Earnings from large paintings} = \text{Price of large painting} \times \text{Number of large paintings sold}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Earnings from large paintings} = 100 \times 5 = 500
   \]

3. **Calculate the earnings from small paintings:**
   \[
   \text{Earnings from small paintings} = \text{Price of small painting} \times \text{Number of small paintings sold}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Earnings from small paintings} = 80 \times 8 = 640
   \]

4. **Calculate the total earnings:**
   \[
   \text{Total earnings} = \text{Earnings from large paintings} + \text{Earnings from small paintings}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total earnings} = 500 + 640 = 1140
   \]

5. **State the final answer:**
   Michael earned a total of **$1140** from selling his paintings at the art show.
