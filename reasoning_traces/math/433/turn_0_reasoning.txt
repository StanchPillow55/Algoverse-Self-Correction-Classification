==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the amount of gasoline in each container**: 
   We start with 15 gallons of gasoline divided equally into 5 containers. To find out how much gasoline is in each container, we divide the total amount of gasoline by the number of containers:

   \[
   \text{Gasoline per container} = \frac{15 \text{ gallons}}{5 \text{ containers}} = 3 \text{ gallons per container}
   \]

2. **Calculate how much gasoline Josey needs**:
   Josey needs \( \frac{1}{4} \) of a container to run her lawnmower. Since we already calculated that each container holds 3 gallons, we can find out how much gasoline \( \frac{1}{4} \) of a container is:

   \[
   \text{Gasoline needed} = \frac{1}{4} \times 3 \text{ gallons} = \frac{3}{4} \text{ gallons}
   \]

3. **Convert gallons to pints**:
   We need to convert the amount of gasoline Josey needs from gallons to pints. We know that 1 gallon is equal to 8 pints. Therefore, we can convert \( \frac{3}{4} \) gallons to pints:

   \[
   \text{Pints needed} = \frac{3}{4} \text{ gallons} \times 8 \text{ pints/gallon}
   \]

   Performing the multiplication:

   \[
   \text{Pints needed} = \frac{3 \times 8}{4} = \frac{24}{4} = 6 \text{ pints}
   \]

4. **Final answer**:
   Josey needs 6 pints of gasoline to run her lawnmower.

Thus, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{6} \text{ pints}
\]
