To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total earnings from the paintings Michael sold at his last art show. We will do this by calculating the earnings from the large paintings and the earnings from the small paintings separately, and then adding these amounts together.

**Step 1: Calculate earnings from large paintings**

Michael charges $100 for each large painting. He sold 5 large paintings. To find the total earnings from the large paintings, we multiply the number of large paintings sold by the price per large painting:

\[
\text{Earnings from large paintings} = \text{Number of large paintings} \times \text{Price per large painting}
\]

\[
\text{Earnings from large paintings} = 5 \times 100 = 500
\]

So, Michael earned $500 from the large paintings.

**Step 2: Calculate earnings from small paintings**

Michael charges $80 for each small painting. He sold 8 small paintings. To find the total earnings from the small paintings, we multiply the number of small paintings sold by the price per small painting:

\[
\text{Earnings from small paintings} = \text{Number of small paintings} \times \text{Price per small painting}
\]

\[
\text{Earnings from small paintings} = 8 \times 80 = 640
\]

So, Michael earned $640 from the small paintings.

**Step 3: Calculate total earnings**

To find the total earnings from all the paintings sold, we add the earnings from the large paintings to the earnings from the small paintings:

\[
\text{Total earnings} = \text{Earnings from large paintings} + \text{Earnings from small paintings}
\]

\[
\text{Total earnings} = 500 + 640 = 1140
\]

Therefore, Michael earned a total of $1140 from his last art show.

**Final Answer:**

Michael earned $1140 in total from selling his paintings at the art show.
