==================================================

To solve "Sample math problem 477," we need to first understand what the problem entails. Since the problem statement is not provided, I'll demonstrate how to approach a generic math problem by creating a sample problem and solving it step by step.

Let's assume "Sample math problem 477" involves solving a quadratic equation. Here is a sample problem:

**Problem:**
Solve the quadratic equation \(2x^2 - 4x - 6 = 0\).

**Step 1: Identify the quadratic equation.**
The given equation is \(2x^2 - 4x - 6 = 0\).

**Step 2: Simplify the equation, if possible.**
Check if the equation can be simplified by dividing all terms by a common factor. Here, all terms are divisible by 2:

\[
x^2 - 2x - 3 = 0
\]

**Step 3: Factor the quadratic equation.**
We need to factor the quadratic equation \(x^2 - 2x - 3 = 0\). We look for two numbers whose product is -3 (the constant term) and whose sum is -2 (the coefficient of the linear term).

The numbers -3 and 1 satisfy these conditions because:
- \((-3) \times 1 = -3\)
- \((-3) + 1 = -2\)

Thus, the equation factors as:

\[
(x - 3)(x + 1) = 0
\]

**Step 4: Solve for the roots.**
Set each factor equal to zero and solve for \(x\):

1. \(x - 3 = 0\) gives \(x = 3\)
2. \(x + 1 = 0\) gives \(x = -1\)

**Step 5: Verify the solutions.**
Substitute \(x = 3\) and \(x = -1\) back into the original equation to verify:

- For \(x = 3\):
  \[
  2(3)^2 - 4(3) - 6 = 18 - 12 - 6 = 0
  \]
  This is correct.

- For \(x = -1\):
  \[
  2(-1)^2 - 4(-1) - 6 = 2 + 4 - 6 = 0
  \]
  This is also correct.

**Final Answer:**
The solutions to the quadratic equation \(2x^2 - 4x - 6 = 0\) are \(x = 3\) and \(x = -1\).
