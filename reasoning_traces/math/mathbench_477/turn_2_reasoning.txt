==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 477," we need to first understand what the problem is asking. However, the problem statement "Sample math problem 477" is not specific enough for us to determine the exact question or the mathematical operations involved. Therefore, I will assume this is a placeholder for a specific math problem.

Let's create a hypothetical math problem using the number 477 and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**
Calculate the sum of the digits of the number 477, and then determine if this sum is a prime number.

**Step-by-step Solution:**

1. **Identify the digits of the number 477:**
   - The number 477 consists of the digits 4, 7, and 7.

2. **Calculate the sum of the digits:**
   - Sum = 4 + 7 + 7

3. **Perform the addition:**
   - First, add 4 and 7:
     \[
     4 + 7 = 11
     \]
   - Then, add the result to the remaining 7:
     \[
     11 + 7 = 18
     \]

4. **Determine if the sum (18) is a prime number:**
   - A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.
   - Check the divisibility of 18:
     - 18 is divisible by 2 (since it is even).
     - 18 is also divisible by 3 (since the sum of its digits, 1 + 8 = 9, is divisible by 3).
   - Since 18 has divisors other than 1 and itself, it is not a prime number.

**Final Answer:**
The sum of the digits of the number 477 is 18, and 18 is not a prime number.
