Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to determine the current number of people on the dance team after accounting for the changes in membership.

1. **Initial Number of People**: 
   The problem states that Leticia, Nina, and Rosalie have a total of 25 people on their dance team. 
   \[
   \text{Initial number of people} = 25
   \]

2. **People Who Quit**: 
   We are told that 8 people quit the team. To find the number of people remaining after these 8 people quit, we subtract 8 from the initial number of people.
   \[
   \text{Remaining after quitting} = 25 - 8 = 17
   \]

3. **New People Joining**: 
   Next, we learn that 13 new people joined the team. To find the total number of people now on the team, we add the number of new people to the number of people remaining after the quitters.
   \[
   \text{Total after new members} = 17 + 13 = 30
   \]

4. **Final Calculation**: 
   After performing the calculations, we find that the total number of people on the dance team now is 30.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{30}
\]
