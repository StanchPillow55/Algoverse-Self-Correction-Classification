To solve the problem, we need to determine how many oranges Stetson ate and then calculate the total amount of money he gave up based on the bet.

**Step 1: Calculate the number of oranges Stetson ate.**

We know that Stetson ate \( \frac{2}{5} \) of the oranges they picked. The total number of oranges picked is 60. 

To find out how many oranges Stetson ate, we can multiply the total number of oranges by the fraction he ate:

\[
\text{Number of oranges eaten} = \frac{2}{5} \times 60
\]

**Step 2: Perform the multiplication.**

Calculating \( \frac{2}{5} \times 60 \):

\[
\frac{2 \times 60}{5} = \frac{120}{5} = 24
\]

So, Stetson ate 24 oranges.

**Step 3: Calculate the total amount of money Stetson gave up.**

According to the bet, Stetson gives up $10 for each orange he eats. Therefore, we need to multiply the number of oranges he ate by the amount he gives up per orange:

\[
\text{Total amount given up} = 24 \times 10
\]

**Step 4: Perform the multiplication.**

Calculating \( 24 \times 10 \):

\[
24 \times 10 = 240
\]

**Final Answer:**

Stetson gave up a total of $240.
