Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine the current number of people on the dance team after accounting for the people who quit and the new people who joined.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Number of People on the Team:**
   - The problem states that Leticia, Nina, and Rosalie have a total of 25 people on their dance team initially.

2. **People Who Quit:**
   - According to the problem, 8 people quit the team.

3. **Calculate the Number of People After Some Quit:**
   - To find out how many people are left after 8 people quit, we subtract the number of people who quit from the initial number of people on the team.
   \[
   \text{People remaining after some quit} = 25 - 8 = 17
   \]

4. **New People Who Joined:**
   - The problem states that 13 new people joined the team.

5. **Calculate the Current Number of People on the Team:**
   - To find the current total number of people on the team, we add the number of new people who joined to the number of people remaining after some quit.
   \[
   \text{Current number of people on the team} = 17 + 13 = 30
   \]

Therefore, after accounting for the people who quit and the new people who joined, the current number of people on the dance team is 30.

**Final Answer:**
There are 30 people on the dance team now.
