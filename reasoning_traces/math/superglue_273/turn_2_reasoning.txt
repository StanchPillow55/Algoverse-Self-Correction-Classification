==================================================

To solve the problem, we first need to understand what is being asked. However, the question "Sample reasoning question 273" does not provide any specific mathematical problem or context to work with. Therefore, I will demonstrate how to approach a generic math problem by creating an example problem and solving it step by step.

Let's assume the problem is as follows:

**Problem:**  
A store sells apples at $2 each and oranges at $3 each. If a customer buys a total of 10 fruits consisting of apples and oranges and spends a total of $25, how many apples and how many oranges did the customer buy?

**Solution:**

To solve this problem, we can set up a system of equations based on the information given.

1. **Define the variables:**
   - Let \( a \) be the number of apples.
   - Let \( o \) be the number of oranges.

2. **Set up the equations:**
   - The total number of fruits is 10:  
     \[
     a + o = 10
     \]
   - The total cost of the fruits is $25:  
     \[
     2a + 3o = 25
     \]

3. **Solve the system of equations:**

   We can use the substitution or elimination method. Here, I'll use substitution.

   From the first equation, solve for \( a \):
   \[
   a = 10 - o
   \]

   Substitute \( a = 10 - o \) into the second equation:
   \[
   2(10 - o) + 3o = 25
   \]

   Simplify and solve for \( o \):
   \[
   20 - 2o + 3o = 25
   \]
   \[
   20 + o = 25
   \]
   \[
   o = 25 - 20
   \]
   \[
   o = 5
   \]

   Substitute \( o = 5 \) back into the equation for \( a \):
   \[
   a = 10 - o = 10 - 5 = 5
   \]

4. **Verify the solution:**

   Check the total number of fruits:
   \[
   a + o = 5 + 5 = 10
   \]

   Check the total cost:
   \[
   2a + 3o = 2(5) + 3(5) = 10 + 15 = 25
   \]

Both conditions are satisfied, so the solution is correct.

**Final Answer:**
The customer bought 5 apples and 5 oranges.
