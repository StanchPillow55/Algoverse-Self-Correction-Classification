==================================================

To solve the problem effectively, let's first clarify what "Sample reasoning question 4" might entail. Since the problem is not explicitly stated, I'll assume it's a generic math problem-solving task. I'll create a hypothetical problem and solve it step-by-step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**

A farmer has a rectangular field that is 100 meters long and 60 meters wide. He wants to build a fence around the field and also divide the field into two equal parts with a fence parallel to the shorter side. Calculate the total length of the fence required.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We have a rectangular field with dimensions 100 meters (length) and 60 meters (width).
   - We need to fence the perimeter of the field.
   - Additionally, we need to divide the field into two equal parts with a fence parallel to the shorter side (width).

2. **Calculate the Perimeter of the Field:**
   - The formula for the perimeter \( P \) of a rectangle is given by:
     \[
     P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width})
     \]
   - Substitute the given dimensions:
     \[
     P = 2 \times (100 + 60) = 2 \times 160 = 320 \text{ meters}
     \]

3. **Calculate the Length of the Dividing Fence:**
   - Since the dividing fence is parallel to the shorter side (width), its length will be equal to the length of the field.
   - Therefore, the length of the dividing fence is 100 meters.

4. **Calculate the Total Length of the Fence Required:**
   - The total length of the fence required is the sum of the perimeter and the dividing fence:
     \[
     \text{Total Fence Length} = \text{Perimeter} + \text{Dividing Fence}
     \]
   - Substitute the calculated values:
     \[
     \text{Total Fence Length} = 320 + 100 = 420 \text{ meters}
     \]

5. **Final Answer:**
   - The total length of the fence required is 420 meters.

This solution provides a complete breakdown of the problem-solving process, including understanding the problem, applying the relevant formulas, and calculating the necessary values to arrive at the final answer.
