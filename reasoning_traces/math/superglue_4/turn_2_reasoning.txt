==================================================

To solve the problem effectively, I need to first understand the context and details of "Sample reasoning question 4." However, since the problem statement is not provided, I'll demonstrate a general approach to solving a typical math problem by using a hypothetical example.

Let's assume the problem is as follows:

**Problem:**
A farmer has a rectangular field that is 100 meters long and 60 meters wide. He wants to divide the field into two equal parts by constructing a fence parallel to the shorter side. How long will the fence be?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We have a rectangular field with dimensions 100 meters (length) and 60 meters (width).
   - The field needs to be divided into two equal parts by a fence parallel to the shorter side (width).

2. **Visualize the Problem:**
   - Imagine the rectangle with the longer side as the base.
   - The fence will run parallel to the width (60 meters), dividing the rectangle into two equal areas.

3. **Calculate the Area of the Field:**
   - The area of the rectangle is given by the formula: 
     \[
     \text{Area} = \text{Length} \times \text{Width} = 100 \, \text{m} \times 60 \, \text{m} = 6000 \, \text{m}^2
     \]

4. **Determine the Area of Each Part:**
   - Since the field is divided into two equal parts, each part will have an area of:
     \[
     \text{Area of each part} = \frac{6000 \, \text{m}^2}{2} = 3000 \, \text{m}^2
     \]

5. **Determine the Length of the Fence:**
   - The fence is parallel to the width, so it will span the entire length of the field.
   - Therefore, the length of the fence will be equal to the length of the field, which is 100 meters.

6. **Verify the Solution:**
   - By placing the fence along the length, each resulting section will have dimensions 50 meters (half of the length) by 60 meters (width).
   - The area of each section will be:
     \[
     50 \, \text{m} \times 60 \, \text{m} = 3000 \, \text{m}^2
     \]
   - This confirms that the field is divided into two equal parts.

**Final Answer:**
The length of the fence required to divide the field into two equal parts is 100 meters.
