==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 4" entails. Since the problem statement is not specific, I'll assume it's a generic math problem that requires logical reasoning and step-by-step calculations. Let's create a sample math problem and solve it:

**Sample Problem:**

A farmer has a rectangular field that is 100 meters long and 60 meters wide. He wants to divide the field into smaller, equal-sized square plots. What is the largest possible side length of each square plot?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We have a rectangular field with dimensions 100 meters by 60 meters.
   - We need to divide this field into square plots of equal size.
   - The goal is to find the largest possible side length for these square plots.

2. **Identify the Mathematical Concept:**
   - To find the largest possible side length of the square plots, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the two dimensions of the rectangle (100 and 60).

3. **Calculate the GCD:**
   - The GCD of two numbers is the largest number that divides both of them without leaving a remainder.
   - We can use the Euclidean algorithm to find the GCD.

4. **Apply the Euclidean Algorithm:**
   - Start with the two numbers: 100 and 60.
   - Divide 100 by 60 and find the remainder:
     \[
     100 \div 60 = 1 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 40
     \]
   - Now, take 60 and divide it by the remainder (40):
     \[
     60 \div 40 = 1 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 20
     \]
   - Next, take 40 and divide it by the new remainder (20):
     \[
     40 \div 20 = 2 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 0
     \]
   - Since the remainder is now 0, the last non-zero remainder is the GCD.

5. **Determine the GCD:**
   - The GCD of 100 and 60 is 20.

6. **Conclusion:**
   - The largest possible side length of each square plot is 20 meters.

**Final Answer:**
The largest possible side length of each square plot is 20 meters.
