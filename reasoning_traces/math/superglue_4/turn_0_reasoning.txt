==================================================

It seems like you've referenced a "Sample reasoning question 4," but I don't have the specific details of that question. However, I can guide you through a generic process for solving a math problem by showing complete reasoning and work. If you provide the specific details of the problem, I can tailor the solution to that.

Let's consider a typical math problem-solving process:

### Example Problem:
**Problem:** Solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We need to find the value of \( x \) that makes the equation true.

2. **Set Up the Equation:**
   - The given equation is \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).

3. **Isolate the Variable:**
   - To solve for \( x \), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation.
   - Start by eliminating the constant term on the left side. Subtract 3 from both sides:
     \[
     2x + 3 - 3 = 11 - 3
     \]
     \[
     2x = 8
     \]

4. **Solve for the Variable:**
   - Now, divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( x \):
     \[
     \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{8}{2}
     \]
     \[
     x = 4
     \]

5. **Check the Solution:**
   - Substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation to verify:
     \[
     2(4) + 3 = 11
     \]
     \[
     8 + 3 = 11
     \]
   - Since both sides of the equation are equal, \( x = 4 \) is indeed the correct solution.

6. **State the Final Answer:**
   - The solution to the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \) is \( x = 4 \).

If you have a specific problem or a different type of question, please provide the details, and I can work through that particular problem for you.
