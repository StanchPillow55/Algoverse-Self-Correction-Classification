==================================================

To solve the problem effectively, let's first understand what "Sample reasoning question 4" might entail. Since the problem statement is not specific, I'll assume it's a generic math problem that requires logical reasoning and step-by-step calculations. I'll create a hypothetical problem and solve it.

**Hypothetical Problem:**

A farmer has a rectangular field with a length that is 10 meters longer than its width. The area of the field is 600 square meters. What are the dimensions of the field?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( w \) be the width of the field in meters.
   - Then the length of the field is \( w + 10 \) meters.

2. **Write the Equation for Area:**
   - The area of a rectangle is given by the formula: 
     \[
     \text{Area} = \text{Length} \times \text{Width}
     \]
   - Substitute the known values into the equation:
     \[
     600 = (w + 10) \times w
     \]

3. **Expand and Simplify the Equation:**
   - Distribute \( w \) in the equation:
     \[
     600 = w^2 + 10w
     \]

4. **Rearrange the Equation:**
   - Bring all terms to one side to form a quadratic equation:
     \[
     w^2 + 10w - 600 = 0
     \]

5. **Solve the Quadratic Equation:**
   - Use the quadratic formula where \( a = 1 \), \( b = 10 \), and \( c = -600 \):
     \[
     w = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
     \]
   - Calculate the discriminant:
     \[
     b^2 - 4ac = 10^2 - 4 \times 1 \times (-600) = 100 + 2400 = 2500
     \]
   - Calculate \( w \):
     \[
     w = \frac{-10 \pm \sqrt{2500}}{2}
     \]
     \[
     w = \frac{-10 \pm 50}{2}
     \]
   - This gives two potential solutions for \( w \):
     \[
     w = \frac{40}{2} = 20 \quad \text{or} \quad w = \frac{-60}{2} = -30
     \]

6. **Interpret the Solutions:**
   - Since width cannot be negative, \( w = 20 \) meters is the only valid solution.

7. **Find the Length:**
   - Substitute \( w = 20 \) back into the expression for length:
     \[
     \text{Length} = w + 10 = 20 + 10 = 30 \text{ meters}
     \]

**Final Answer:**

The dimensions of the field are 20 meters by 30 meters.
