Question ID: mathbench_351
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we first need to understand what "Sample math problem 351" refers to. Since this is not a standard problem description, I will assume it is a placeholder for a specific math problem. Without the actual problem details, I will create a hypothetical math problem labeled as "Sample math problem 351" and solve it step-by-step.

**Hypothetical Problem 351:**

Calculate the value of \( x \) in the equation:  
\[ 2x + 3 = 11 \]

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Equation:**
   The equation given is \( 2x + 3 = 11 \). This is a linear equation in one variable, \( x \).

2. **Isolate the Variable:**
   To solve for \( x \), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We can start by eliminating the constant term on the left side of the equation.

3. **Subtract 3 from Both Sides:**
   \[
   2x + 3 - 3 = 11 - 3
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   2x = 8
   \]

4. **Divide by the Coefficient of \( x \):**
   To solve for \( x \), divide both sides by 2, the coefficient of \( x \).
   \[
   \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{8}{2}
   \]
   Simplifying gives:
   \[
   x = 4
   \]

5. **Verify the Solution:**
   Substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation to verify:
   \[
   2(4) + 3 = 11
   \]
   Simplifying the left side:
   \[
   8 + 3 = 11
   \]
   Since both sides of the equation are equal, the solution \( x = 4 \) is correct.

**Final Answer:**

The value of \( x \) is 4.
