Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to consider both the dough preparation time and the oven cooking time, while also accounting for the oven's capacity limitation. Let's break down the process step by step:

1. **Determine the number of batches of dough needed:**
   - One batch of dough makes 3 pizzas.
   - Camilla needs to make 12 pizzas.
   - Number of batches required = Total pizzas needed / Pizzas per batch = 12 / 3 = 4 batches.

2. **Calculate the total dough preparation time:**
   - Each batch of dough takes 30 minutes to prepare.
   - Total dough preparation time for 4 batches = 4 batches × 30 minutes per batch = 120 minutes.

3. **Determine the oven cooking process:**
   - The oven can fit 2 pizzas at a time, and each batch makes 3 pizzas.
   - For each batch, Camilla will need to bake the pizzas in two rounds:
     - First round: 2 pizzas
     - Second round: 1 pizza (since only 1 pizza is left from the batch of 3)
   - Each round in the oven takes 30 minutes.

4. **Calculate the total oven time for all batches:**
   - For each batch, the oven time is 2 rounds × 30 minutes per round = 60 minutes.
   - Total oven time for 4 batches = 4 batches × 60 minutes per batch = 240 minutes.

5. **Combine the dough preparation and oven times:**
   - Total time = Total dough preparation time + Total oven time
   - Total time = 120 minutes (dough preparation) + 240 minutes (oven time) = 360 minutes.

6. **Convert the total time from minutes to hours:**
   - 360 minutes ÷ 60 minutes per hour = 6 hours.

Therefore, it would take Camilla a total of 6 hours to finish making 12 pizzas.

**Final Answer:** 6 hours
