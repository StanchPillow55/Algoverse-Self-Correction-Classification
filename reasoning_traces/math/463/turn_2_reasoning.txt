Question ID: 463
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to consider both the dough preparation time and the baking time, taking into account the constraints of the oven capacity. Let's break it down step by step:

### Step 1: Determine Dough Preparation Time
- **Dough Preparation:** It takes 30 minutes to prepare one batch of pizza dough.
- **Batch Capacity:** One batch of dough can make 3 pizzas.

Since Camilla needs to make 12 pizzas, we need to calculate how many batches of dough are required:
\[ \text{Number of batches} = \frac{12 \text{ pizzas}}{3 \text{ pizzas per batch}} = 4 \text{ batches} \]

Each batch takes 30 minutes to prepare, so the total dough preparation time is:
\[ 4 \text{ batches} \times 30 \text{ minutes per batch} = 120 \text{ minutes} \]

### Step 2: Determine Baking Time
- **Oven Capacity:** The oven can fit 2 pizzas at a time.
- **Baking Time:** Each batch of pizzas takes 30 minutes to bake.

Since Camilla needs to bake 12 pizzas and the oven can only fit 2 pizzas at a time, we need to calculate how many baking sessions are required:
\[ \text{Number of baking sessions} = \frac{12 \text{ pizzas}}{2 \text{ pizzas per session}} = 6 \text{ sessions} \]

Each session takes 30 minutes, so the total baking time is:
\[ 6 \text{ sessions} \times 30 \text{ minutes per session} = 180 \text{ minutes} \]

### Step 3: Calculate Total Time
Now, we add the total dough preparation time and the total baking time to find the total time required:
\[ \text{Total time} = 120 \text{ minutes (dough preparation)} + 180 \text{ minutes (baking)} = 300 \text{ minutes} \]

### Step 4: Convert Total Time to Hours
To convert the total time from minutes to hours:
\[ \text{Total time in hours} = \frac{300 \text{ minutes}}{60 \text{ minutes per hour}} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, it would take Camilla a total of 5 hours to finish making 12 pizzas.

**Final Answer:** 5 hours
