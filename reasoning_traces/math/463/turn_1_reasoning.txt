==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine the total time it takes for Camilla to make 12 pizzas, considering the constraints of dough preparation and oven capacity.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Understand the Process:**
   - **Dough Preparation:** It takes 30 minutes to prepare one batch of pizza dough.
   - **Oven Capacity:** The oven can only fit 2 pizzas at a time.
   - **Cooking Time:** Each batch of pizzas takes 30 minutes to cook in the oven.
   - **Batch Size:** One batch of dough makes 3 pizzas.

2. **Calculate the Number of Batches Needed:**
   - Camilla needs to make 12 pizzas in total.
   - Since one batch of dough makes 3 pizzas, the number of batches needed is:
     \[
     \text{Number of batches} = \frac{12 \text{ pizzas}}{3 \text{ pizzas per batch}} = 4 \text{ batches}
     \]

3. **Calculate Dough Preparation Time:**
   - Each batch takes 30 minutes to prepare.
   - For 4 batches, the total dough preparation time is:
     \[
     4 \text{ batches} \times 30 \text{ minutes per batch} = 120 \text{ minutes}
     \]

4. **Calculate Cooking Time:**
   - The oven can cook 2 pizzas at a time, and each batch takes 30 minutes to cook.
   - Since each batch makes 3 pizzas, we need to split the cooking into two parts for each batch:
     - First, cook 2 pizzas.
     - Then, cook the remaining 1 pizza.
   - For each batch, the cooking time is:
     \[
     30 \text{ minutes for the first 2 pizzas} + 30 \text{ minutes for the remaining pizza} = 60 \text{ minutes per batch}
     \]
   - For 4 batches, the total cooking time is:
     \[
     4 \text{ batches} \times 60 \text{ minutes per batch} = 240 \text{ minutes}
     \]

5. **Calculate Total Time:**
   - Total time includes both dough preparation and cooking time:
     \[
     \text{Total time} = 120 \text{ minutes (dough preparation)} + 240 \text{ minutes (cooking)} = 360 \text{ minutes}
     \]

6. **Convert Total Time to Hours:**
   - Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, convert 360 minutes to hours:
     \[
     \frac{360 \text{ minutes}}{60 \text{ minutes per hour}} = 6 \text{ hours}
     \]

### Final Answer:
Camilla would take a total of 6 hours to finish making 12 pizzas.
