==================================================

To determine how long it will take Camilla to finish making 12 pizzas, we need to break down the process into steps and consider the constraints provided.

1. **Dough Preparation**: 
   - It takes 30 minutes to make one batch of pizza dough.
   - One batch of dough can make 3 pizzas.

2. **Cooking Time**: 
   - It takes 30 minutes to cook the pizzas in the oven.
   - The oven can fit only 2 pizzas at a time.

3. **Calculating the Number of Batches Needed**:
   - To make 12 pizzas, we need to calculate how many batches of dough are required:
     \[
     \text{Number of batches} = \frac{12 \text{ pizzas}}{3 \text{ pizzas per batch}} = 4 \text{ batches}
     \]

4. **Total Dough Preparation Time**:
   - Since each batch takes 30 minutes to prepare, the total time for preparing 4 batches is:
     \[
     \text{Total dough preparation time} = 4 \text{ batches} \times 30 \text{ minutes per batch} = 120 \text{ minutes} = 2 \text{ hours}
     \]

5. **Cooking the Pizzas**:
   - Each batch of dough can make 3 pizzas, but since the oven can only fit 2 pizzas at a time, we need to consider how many cooking sessions are required.
   - For 4 batches (12 pizzas), we can cook them in the following way:
     - **First Batch**: Cook 2 pizzas (30 minutes)
     - **Second Batch**: Cook 2 pizzas (30 minutes)
     - **Third Batch**: Cook 2 pizzas (30 minutes)
     - **Fourth Batch**: Cook 2 pizzas (30 minutes)
     - **Fifth Batch**: Cook the remaining 2 pizzas from the last batch (30 minutes)

   - Since we can cook 2 pizzas at a time, we will need to cook the 12 pizzas in 6 cooking sessions (2 pizzas per session):
     \[
     \text{Total cooking time} = 6 \text{ sessions} \times 30 \text{ minutes per session} = 180 \text{ minutes} = 3 \text{ hours}
     \]

6. **Total Time Calculation**:
   - Now, we add the total dough preparation time and the total cooking time:
     \[
     \text{Total time} = \text{Total dough preparation time} + \text{Total cooking time} = 120 \text{ minutes} + 180 \text{ minutes} = 300 \text{ minutes}
     \]
   - Converting this into hours:
     \[
     300 \text{ minutes} = 5 \text{ hours}
     \]

Therefore, the total time it would take for Camilla to finish making 12 pizzas is **5 hours**. 

Final answer: **5 hours**.
