==================================================

To find the total amount that Ashley should give the delivery man, we need to calculate the tip she wants to give and then add that tip to the cost of the pizza delivery.

1. **Identify the cost of the pizza delivery**:  
   The cost of the pizza delivery is given as $15.

2. **Calculate the tip**:  
   Ashley wants to give a tip that is equal to \( \frac{1}{5} \) of the amount she ordered. Since the amount she ordered is $15, we need to calculate \( \frac{1}{5} \) of $15.

   \[
   \text{Tip} = \frac{1}{5} \times 15
   \]

   To perform the multiplication:

   \[
   \text{Tip} = \frac{15}{5} = 3
   \]

   So, the tip that Ashley wants to give is $3.

3. **Calculate the total amount to give the delivery man**:  
   Now, we need to add the tip to the cost of the pizza delivery.

   \[
   \text{Total Amount} = \text{Cost of Delivery} + \text{Tip}
   \]

   Substituting the values we have:

   \[
   \text{Total Amount} = 15 + 3 = 18
   \]

4. **Final Answer**:  
   Therefore, the total amount that Ashley should give the delivery man is **$18**.
