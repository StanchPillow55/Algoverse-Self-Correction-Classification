To solve this problem, we need to determine how long it will take Camilla to make 12 pizzas, considering the constraints of dough preparation and oven capacity.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Dough Preparation:**
   - Each batch of dough takes 30 minutes to prepare.
   - One batch of dough can make 3 pizzas.

2. **Determine the Number of Batches Needed:**
   - Camilla needs to make 12 pizzas.
   - Since each batch makes 3 pizzas, the number of batches required is:
     \[
     \frac{12 \text{ pizzas}}{3 \text{ pizzas per batch}} = 4 \text{ batches}
     \]

3. **Calculate Dough Preparation Time:**
   - Each batch takes 30 minutes to prepare.
   - For 4 batches, the total dough preparation time is:
     \[
     4 \text{ batches} \times 30 \text{ minutes per batch} = 120 \text{ minutes}
     \]

4. **Baking the Pizzas:**
   - The oven can bake 2 pizzas at a time, and each batch takes 30 minutes to bake.
   - To bake 12 pizzas, we need to determine how many baking sessions are required:
     - 12 pizzas / 2 pizzas per session = 6 sessions

5. **Calculate Baking Time:**
   - Each baking session takes 30 minutes.
   - For 6 sessions, the total baking time is:
     \[
     6 \text{ sessions} \times 30 \text{ minutes per session} = 180 \text{ minutes}
     \]

6. **Total Time Calculation:**
   - Total time is the sum of dough preparation time and baking time:
     \[
     120 \text{ minutes (dough preparation)} + 180 \text{ minutes (baking)} = 300 \text{ minutes}
     \]

7. **Convert Total Time to Hours:**
   - There are 60 minutes in an hour, so:
     \[
     \frac{300 \text{ minutes}}{60 \text{ minutes per hour}} = 5 \text{ hours}
     \]

### Final Answer:
Camilla will take 5 hours to finish making 12 pizzas.
