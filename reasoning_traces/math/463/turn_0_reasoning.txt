To solve the problem, we need to break it down into manageable steps and calculate the total time required for Camilla to make 12 pizzas.

1. **Understanding the Dough and Cooking Process**:
   - It takes **30 minutes** to make one batch of pizza dough.
   - One batch of dough can make **3 pizzas**.
   - It takes another **30 minutes** to cook the pizzas in the oven.
   - The oven can only fit **2 pizzas at a time**.

2. **Calculating the Number of Batches Needed**:
   - To make **12 pizzas**, we need to determine how many batches of dough are required.
   - Since one batch makes **3 pizzas**, we can calculate the number of batches needed:
     \[
     \text{Number of batches} = \frac{12 \text{ pizzas}}{3 \text{ pizzas/batch}} = 4 \text{ batches}
     \]

3. **Calculating the Time for Making Dough**:
   - Each batch of dough takes **30 minutes** to prepare.
   - Therefore, the total time to make 4 batches of dough is:
     \[
     \text{Total dough time} = 4 \text{ batches} \times 30 \text{ minutes/batch} = 120 \text{ minutes}
     \]

4. **Calculating the Cooking Time**:
   - Since the oven can only fit **2 pizzas at a time**, we need to determine how many batches of pizzas we can cook at once.
   - For **12 pizzas**, we will need to cook them in batches of 2 pizzas:
     \[
     \text{Number of cooking batches} = \frac{12 \text{ pizzas}}{2 \text{ pizzas/batch}} = 6 \text{ batches}
     \]
   - Each batch takes **30 minutes** to cook, so the total cooking time is:
     \[
     \text{Total cooking time} = 6 \text{ batches} \times 30 \text{ minutes/batch} = 180 \text{ minutes}
     \]

5. **Scheduling the Cooking with Dough Preparation**:
   - While Camilla is making the dough, she can start cooking the pizzas as soon as the first batch of dough is ready.
   - The first batch of dough takes **30 minutes** to prepare, and during this time, she can start cooking the first 2 pizzas as soon as the dough is ready.
   - After the first 2 pizzas are cooked (which takes another **30 minutes**), she can start cooking the next 2 pizzas.
   - This process continues until all pizzas are cooked.

6. **Calculating the Overlapping Time**:
   - The first batch of dough takes **30 minutes**.
   - After that, she can cook the first 2 pizzas for another **30 minutes** (totaling **60 minutes** from the start).
   - She can then cook the next 2 pizzas while the next batch of dough is being prepared.
   - This overlapping continues until all pizzas are cooked.

7. **Total Time Calculation**:
   - The total time for making the dough is **120 minutes**.
   - The total time for cooking is **180 minutes**.
   - However, since the cooking can overlap with the dough preparation, we need to account for that:
     - The first 30 minutes of dough preparation overlaps with the first cooking batch.
     - After the first batch of cooking (30 minutes), she will continue to cook the remaining pizzas while preparing the next batches of dough.

8. **Final Calculation**:
   - The total time taken will be the maximum of the total dough time and the total cooking time, adjusted for the overlap:
   - Since the cooking time (180 minutes) is longer than the dough preparation time (120 minutes), we will take the cooking time into account.
   - The total time taken to finish making all 12 pizzas is:
     \[
     \text{Total time} = 180 \text{ minutes}
     \]

9. **Convert Minutes to Hours**:
   - To convert the total time from minutes to hours:
     \[
     \text{Total time in hours} = \frac{180 \text{ minutes}}{60 \text{ minutes/hour}} = 3 \text{ hours}
     \]

Thus, the final answer is that it would take Camilla **3 hours** to finish making 12 pizzas.
