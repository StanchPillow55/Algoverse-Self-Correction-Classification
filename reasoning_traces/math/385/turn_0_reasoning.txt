==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to break it down step by step.

1. **Understanding the Costs**:
   - Each picker pays an entrance fee of $4.
   - The price of strawberries is $20 per pound.
   - Miguel deducts the entrance fee from the total cost of the strawberries picked.

2. **Total Amount Paid**:
   - Sally, Jenny, and Moses together paid $128 for their harvest. This amount includes the entrance fees and the cost of the strawberries.

3. **Calculating the Entrance Fees**:
   - Since there are three pickers (Sally, Jenny, and Moses), the total entrance fee they paid is:
     \[
     \text{Total Entrance Fee} = 3 \times 4 = 12 \text{ dollars}
     \]

4. **Calculating the Cost of Strawberries**:
   - The amount they paid for the strawberries (after deducting the entrance fee) is:
     \[
     \text{Cost of Strawberries} = \text{Total Amount Paid} - \text{Total Entrance Fee}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Cost of Strawberries} = 128 - 12 = 116 \text{ dollars}
     \]

5. **Calculating the Pounds of Strawberries**:
   - The price of strawberries is $20 per pound. To find out how many pounds of strawberries they picked, we divide the cost of the strawberries by the price per pound:
     \[
     \text{Pounds of Strawberries} = \frac{\text{Cost of Strawberries}}{\text{Price per Pound}}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Pounds of Strawberries} = \frac{116}{20} = 5.8 \text{ pounds}
     \]

6. **Final Answer**:
   - Therefore, Sally, Jenny, and Moses picked a total of **5.8 pounds** of strawberries.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{5.8}
\]
