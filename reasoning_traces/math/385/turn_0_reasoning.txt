==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine how many pounds of strawberries Sally, Jenny, and Moses picked, given that they paid a total of $128 for their harvest after the entrance fee deduction.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Entrance Fee Calculation:**
   - Each person pays an entrance fee of $4 to access the strawberry fields.
   - There are three people: Sally, Jenny, and Moses.
   - Total entrance fee for all three is: 
     \[
     3 \times 4 = 12 \text{ dollars}
     \]

2. **Total Cost Before Deduction:**
   - The total amount they paid after the entrance fee deduction is $128.
   - This means the cost of the strawberries alone, before deducting the entrance fee, is:
     \[
     \text{Total cost before deduction} = 128 + 12 = 140 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Cost Per Pound of Strawberries:**
   - The price per pound of strawberries is $20.

4. **Calculate the Total Pounds of Strawberries Picked:**
   - Let \( x \) be the number of pounds of strawberries picked.
   - The cost of the strawberries is given by the equation:
     \[
     20x = 140
     \]
   - Solve for \( x \):
     \[
     x = \frac{140}{20} = 7
     \]

Thus, Sally, Jenny, and Moses picked a total of 7 pounds of strawberries.

**Final Answer:**
They picked 7 pounds of strawberries.
