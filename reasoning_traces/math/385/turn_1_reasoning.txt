Question ID: 385
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to determine how many pounds of strawberries Sally, Jenny, and Moses picked based on the total amount they paid for their harvest, which was $128. 

### Step 1: Understand the Pricing Structure
1. Each person pays an entrance fee of $4 to access the strawberry fields.
2. The price of strawberries is $20 per pound.
3. Miguel deducts the entrance fee from the total cost of the strawberries picked.

### Step 2: Set Up the Equation
Let \( x \) be the total number of pounds of strawberries picked by Sally, Jenny, and Moses.

The total cost for the strawberries before deducting the entrance fee would be:
\[
20x
\]
Since there are three pickers, the total entrance fee they paid is:
\[
3 \times 4 = 12
\]
Thus, the total amount they paid after deducting the entrance fee is:
\[
20x - 12
\]
According to the problem, this total amount equals $128:
\[
20x - 12 = 128
\]

### Step 3: Solve for \( x \)
Now, we will solve the equation for \( x \):
1. Add 12 to both sides:
\[
20x - 12 + 12 = 128 + 12
\]
\[
20x = 140
\]

2. Divide both sides by 20:
\[
x = \frac{140}{20}
\]
\[
x = 7
\]

### Step 4: Conclusion
Sally, Jenny, and Moses picked a total of 7 pounds of strawberries.

### Final Answer
The total number of pounds of strawberries they picked is \( \boxed{7} \).
