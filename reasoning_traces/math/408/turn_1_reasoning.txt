==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total weight of the people already in the elevator and then determine how much additional weight can be added without exceeding the maximum weight limit of the elevator.

**Step 1: Calculate the total weight of the three adults.**

The problem states that the average weight of the three adults is 140 pounds. The average weight is calculated by dividing the total weight by the number of individuals. Therefore, we can find the total weight of the three adults by multiplying the average weight by the number of adults:

\[
\text{Total weight of adults} = \text{Average weight} \times \text{Number of adults} = 140 \, \text{pounds} \times 3 = 420 \, \text{pounds}
\]

**Step 2: Calculate the total weight of the two children.**

Similarly, the average weight of the two children is given as 64 pounds. We can find the total weight of the two children by multiplying the average weight by the number of children:

\[
\text{Total weight of children} = \text{Average weight} \times \text{Number of children} = 64 \, \text{pounds} \times 2 = 128 \, \text{pounds}
\]

**Step 3: Calculate the total weight currently in the elevator.**

Now, we add the total weight of the adults and the total weight of the children to find the total weight currently in the elevator:

\[
\text{Total weight in elevator} = \text{Total weight of adults} + \text{Total weight of children} = 420 \, \text{pounds} + 128 \, \text{pounds} = 548 \, \text{pounds}
\]

**Step 4: Determine the maximum additional weight allowed.**

The elevator has a maximum weight capacity of 600 pounds. To find the maximum weight of the next person who can enter the elevator without exceeding this limit, we subtract the current total weight from the maximum capacity:

\[
\text{Maximum additional weight} = \text{Maximum capacity} - \text{Total weight in elevator} = 600 \, \text{pounds} - 548 \, \text{pounds} = 52 \, \text{pounds}
\]

Therefore, the maximum weight of the next person to get in the elevator so that it will not be overloaded is **52 pounds**.
