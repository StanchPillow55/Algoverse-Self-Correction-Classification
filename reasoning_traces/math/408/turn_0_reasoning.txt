==================================================

To determine the maximum weight of the next person who can enter the elevator without exceeding the maximum weight limit of 600 pounds, we will first calculate the total weight of the three adults and the two children already in the elevator.

1. **Calculate the total weight of the adults:**
   - The average weight of the three adults is 140 pounds.
   - Therefore, the total weight of the three adults can be calculated as:
     \[
     \text{Total weight of adults} = \text{Average weight} \times \text{Number of adults} = 140 \text{ pounds} \times 3 = 420 \text{ pounds}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total weight of the children:**
   - The average weight of the two children is 64 pounds.
   - Therefore, the total weight of the two children can be calculated as:
     \[
     \text{Total weight of children} = \text{Average weight} \times \text{Number of children} = 64 \text{ pounds} \times 2 = 128 \text{ pounds}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total weight currently in the elevator:**
   - Now, we add the total weight of the adults and the total weight of the children:
     \[
     \text{Total weight in elevator} = \text{Total weight of adults} + \text{Total weight of children} = 420 \text{ pounds} + 128 \text{ pounds} = 548 \text{ pounds}
     \]

4. **Determine the remaining weight capacity of the elevator:**
   - The maximum weight limit of the elevator is 600 pounds. To find out how much weight can still be added, we subtract the current total weight from the maximum weight limit:
     \[
     \text{Remaining weight capacity} = \text{Maximum weight} - \text{Total weight in elevator} = 600 \text{ pounds} - 548 \text{ pounds} = 52 \text{ pounds}
     \]

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The maximum weight of the next person who can get into the elevator without exceeding the weight limit is 52 pounds.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{52 \text{ pounds}}
\]
