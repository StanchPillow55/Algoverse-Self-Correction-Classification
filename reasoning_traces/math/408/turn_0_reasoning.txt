==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine the total weight already in the elevator and then find out how much additional weight can be added without exceeding the elevator's maximum capacity of 600 pounds.

### Step-by-step Calculation:

1. **Calculate the Total Weight of the Adults:**
   - We are given that the average weight of the three adults is 140 pounds.
   - Therefore, the total weight of the three adults is:
     \[
     \text{Total weight of adults} = 3 \times 140 = 420 \text{ pounds}
     \]

2. **Calculate the Total Weight of the Children:**
   - We are given that the average weight of the two children is 64 pounds.
   - Therefore, the total weight of the two children is:
     \[
     \text{Total weight of children} = 2 \times 64 = 128 \text{ pounds}
     \]

3. **Calculate the Total Weight Currently in the Elevator:**
   - Add the total weight of the adults and the total weight of the children:
     \[
     \text{Total weight in elevator} = 420 + 128 = 548 \text{ pounds}
     \]

4. **Determine the Maximum Additional Weight Allowed:**
   - The elevator's maximum capacity is 600 pounds.
   - To find the maximum weight of the next person who can enter without exceeding this limit, subtract the current total weight from the maximum capacity:
     \[
     \text{Maximum additional weight} = 600 - 548 = 52 \text{ pounds}
     \]

### Conclusion:
The maximum weight of the next person to get in the elevator so that it will not be overloaded is **52 pounds**.
