==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to determine how many goats Mr. Smith has left on both farms after selling some goats.

1. **Initial Number of Goats:**
   - Farm X: 55 goats
   - Farm Y: 45 goats

2. **Total Initial Goats:**
   We can calculate the total number of goats before any sales:
   \[
   \text{Total goats initially} = \text{Goats in Farm X} + \text{Goats in Farm Y} = 55 + 45 = 100 \text{ goats}
   \]

3. **Goats Sold from Each Farm:**
   - Mr. Smith sold 10 goats from Farm X.
   - He sold twice as many goats from Farm Y. Therefore, the number of goats sold from Farm Y is:
   \[
   \text{Goats sold from Farm Y} = 2 \times 10 = 20 \text{ goats}
   \]

4. **Calculating Remaining Goats:**
   Now we will calculate the number of goats left in each farm after the sales.

   - **Remaining Goats in Farm X:**
   \[
   \text{Remaining goats in Farm X} = \text{Initial goats in Farm X} - \text{Goats sold from Farm X} = 55 - 10 = 45 \text{ goats}
   \]

   - **Remaining Goats in Farm Y:**
   \[
   \text{Remaining goats in Farm Y} = \text{Initial goats in Farm Y} - \text{Goats sold from Farm Y} = 45 - 20 = 25 \text{ goats}
   \]

5. **Total Remaining Goats:**
   Finally, we can find the total number of goats left on both farms:
   \[
   \text{Total remaining goats} = \text{Remaining goats in Farm X} + \text{Remaining goats in Farm Y} = 45 + 25 = 70 \text{ goats}
   \]

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{70}
\] 

This means Mr. Smith has 70 goats left in total on both farms after the sales.
