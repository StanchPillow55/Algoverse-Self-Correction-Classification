==================================================

To solve the problem, we first need to understand what "Sample math problem 319" refers to. Since there is no specific problem statement provided, I'll create a sample math problem labeled as "319" and solve it step by step.

**Sample Math Problem 319:**

Calculate the area of a triangle with vertices at points A(2, 3), B(5, 11), and C(8, 7).

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

To find the area of a triangle given its vertices, we can use the formula derived from the determinant of a matrix:

\[
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \left| x_1(y_2-y_3) + x_2(y_3-y_1) + x_3(y_1-y_2) \right|
\]

where \((x_1, y_1)\), \((x_2, y_2)\), and \((x_3, y_3)\) are the coordinates of the vertices A, B, and C, respectively.

**Given:**
- \(A(2, 3)\)
- \(B(5, 11)\)
- \(C(8, 7)\)

**Substitute the coordinates into the formula:**

\[
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \left| 2(11-7) + 5(7-3) + 8(3-11) \right|
\]

**Calculate each term:**

1. \(2(11-7) = 2 \times 4 = 8\)
2. \(5(7-3) = 5 \times 4 = 20\)
3. \(8(3-11) = 8 \times (-8) = -64\)

**Substitute back into the formula:**

\[
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \left| 8 + 20 - 64 \right|
\]

**Simplify inside the absolute value:**

\[
8 + 20 - 64 = 28 - 64 = -36
\]

**Take the absolute value:**

\[
|-36| = 36
\]

**Calculate the final area:**

\[
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times 36 = 18
\]

**Final Answer:**

The area of the triangle with vertices at points A(2, 3), B(5, 11), and C(8, 7) is \(18\) square units.
