==================================================

To solve the problem, I need more information about what "Sample math problem 319" entails. Since I don't have access to external databases or specific problem sets, I'll demonstrate how to solve a generic math problem by working through an example. If you have a specific problem in mind, please provide the details.

Let's consider a sample math problem:

**Problem:**
Solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).

**Step-by-step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Equation:**
   The equation given is a linear equation in one variable, \( x \). The goal is to isolate \( x \) on one side of the equation to find its value.

2. **Subtract 3 from Both Sides:**
   To isolate the term with \( x \), first eliminate the constant term on the left side by subtracting 3 from both sides of the equation.
   \[
   2x + 3 - 3 = 11 - 3
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   2x = 8
   \]

3. **Divide Both Sides by 2:**
   Now, divide both sides of the equation by 2 to solve for \( x \).
   \[
   \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{8}{2}
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   x = 4
   \]

4. **Verify the Solution:**
   Substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies the equation.
   \[
   2(4) + 3 = 11
   \]
   Simplifying the left side gives:
   \[
   8 + 3 = 11
   \]
   Since both sides of the equation are equal, the solution \( x = 4 \) is verified.

**Final Answer:**
The solution to the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \) is \( x = 4 \).
