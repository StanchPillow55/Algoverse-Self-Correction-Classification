==================================================

To solve the problem labeled "Sample math problem 319," we need to first understand what the problem is asking. However, since the problem statement is not provided in your request, I'll demonstrate a general approach to solving a math problem by creating a hypothetical problem and solving it step-by-step.

Let's assume the problem is as follows:

**Problem Statement:**
A rectangle has a length that is 3 times its width. If the perimeter of the rectangle is 64 units, find the dimensions of the rectangle.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We have a rectangle with a length (L) and a width (W).
   - The length is 3 times the width: \( L = 3W \).
   - The perimeter of the rectangle is 64 units.

2. **Recall the Formula for Perimeter:**
   - The perimeter (P) of a rectangle is given by the formula:
     \[
     P = 2L + 2W
     \]

3. **Substitute Known Values:**
   - Substitute the expression for L in terms of W into the perimeter formula:
     \[
     64 = 2(3W) + 2W
     \]

4. **Simplify the Equation:**
   - Simplify the equation:
     \[
     64 = 6W + 2W
     \]
     \[
     64 = 8W
     \]

5. **Solve for W:**
   - Divide both sides of the equation by 8 to solve for W:
     \[
     W = \frac{64}{8} = 8
     \]

6. **Find the Length (L):**
   - Use the relationship \( L = 3W \) to find the length:
     \[
     L = 3 \times 8 = 24
     \]

7. **Verify the Solution:**
   - Check that the dimensions satisfy the original perimeter condition:
     \[
     P = 2L + 2W = 2(24) + 2(8) = 48 + 16 = 64
     \]
   - The calculated perimeter matches the given perimeter, confirming the solution is correct.

**Final Answer:**
The dimensions of the rectangle are:
- Width (W) = 8 units
- Length (L) = 24 units

This completes the solution to the hypothetical problem. If you have a specific problem labeled "Sample math problem 319," please provide the details, and I will be happy to solve it for you.
