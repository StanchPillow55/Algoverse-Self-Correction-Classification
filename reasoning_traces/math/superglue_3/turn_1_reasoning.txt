Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem effectively, I need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 3" entails. However, since the problem is not explicitly stated, I'll demonstrate a general approach to solving a math problem using logical reasoning and step-by-step calculations. Let's assume a hypothetical math problem and work through it.

**Hypothetical Problem:**

Calculate the area of a triangle with a base of 10 units and a height of 5 units.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We need to find the area of a triangle.
   - The formula for the area of a triangle is: 
     \[
     \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height}
     \]

2. **Identify the Given Values:**
   - Base (\(b\)) = 10 units
   - Height (\(h\)) = 5 units

3. **Substitute the Values into the Formula:**
   - Plug the values into the area formula:
     \[
     \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times 10 \times 5
     \]

4. **Perform the Calculations:**
   - First, multiply the base and height:
     \[
     10 \times 5 = 50
     \]
   - Then, multiply by \(\frac{1}{2}\):
     \[
     \frac{1}{2} \times 50 = 25
     \]

5. **State the Final Answer:**
   - The area of the triangle is 25 square units.

**Conclusion:**

By following a structured approach, we calculated the area of the triangle to be 25 square units. This method can be applied to any similar problem involving the calculation of a triangle's area, provided the base and height are known. If you have a specific problem or additional details, please provide them for a more tailored solution.
