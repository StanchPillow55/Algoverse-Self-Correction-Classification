==================================================

It seems like the problem statement is incomplete or unclear. "Sample reasoning question 3" doesn't provide enough information for me to solve a specific math problem. However, I can guide you through a general approach to solving math problems by showing how to work through a sample problem step by step. 

Let's consider a sample math problem:

**Problem:**  
Solve for \( x \) in the equation:  
\[ 2x + 3 = 11 \]

**Step-by-step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We need to find the value of \( x \) that makes the equation true.

2. **Isolate the Variable:**
   - The goal is to get \( x \) by itself on one side of the equation. Currently, the equation is \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).

3. **Subtract 3 from Both Sides:**
   - To isolate the term with \( x \), subtract 3 from both sides of the equation:
   \[
   2x + 3 - 3 = 11 - 3
   \]
   - Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   2x = 8
   \]

4. **Divide Both Sides by 2:**
   - Now, divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( x \):
   \[
   \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{8}{2}
   \]
   - Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   x = 4
   \]

5. **Verify the Solution:**
   - Substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies the equation:
   \[
   2(4) + 3 = 11
   \]
   - Simplifying the left side gives:
   \[
   8 + 3 = 11
   \]
   - Since both sides of the equation are equal, \( x = 4 \) is indeed the correct solution.

**Final Answer:**
\[ x = 4 \]
