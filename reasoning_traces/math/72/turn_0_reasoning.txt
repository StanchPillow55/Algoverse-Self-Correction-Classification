==================================================

To solve the problem, we will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total volume of the aquarium.**
2. **Determine how much water Nancy initially fills the aquarium with.**
3. **Account for the water spilled by the cat.**
4. **Calculate the amount of water after Nancy triples it.**
5. **Provide the final answer.**

### Step 1: Calculate the total volume of the aquarium

The volume \( V \) of a rectangular prism (which is the shape of the aquarium) can be calculated using the formula:

\[
V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{height}
\]

Given:
- Length = 4 feet
- Width = 6 feet
- Height = 3 feet

Calculating the volume:

\[
V = 4 \, \text{ft} \times 6 \, \text{ft} \times 3 \, \text{ft} = 72 \, \text{cubic feet}
\]

### Step 2: Determine how much water Nancy initially fills the aquarium with

Nancy fills the aquarium halfway. Therefore, the amount of water she initially fills is half of the total volume:

\[
\text{Initial water} = \frac{1}{2} \times 72 \, \text{cubic feet} = 36 \, \text{cubic feet}
\]

### Step 3: Account for the water spilled by the cat

While Nancy is away, the cat knocks the aquarium over and spills half of the water that was in it. The amount of water spilled is:

\[
\text{Water spilled} = \frac{1}{2} \times 36 \, \text{cubic feet} = 18 \, \text{cubic feet}
\]

Now, we calculate the amount of water remaining in the aquarium after the spill:

\[
\text{Water remaining} = 36 \, \text{cubic feet} - 18 \, \text{cubic feet} = 18 \, \text{cubic feet}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the amount of water after Nancy triples it

After Nancy returns, she triples the amount of water that is currently in the aquarium. Therefore, the new amount of water is:

\[
\text{Final water amount} = 3 \times 18 \, \text{cubic feet} = 54 \, \text{cubic feet}
\]

### Final Answer

The final amount of water in the aquarium is:

\[
\boxed{54} \, \text{cubic feet}
\]
