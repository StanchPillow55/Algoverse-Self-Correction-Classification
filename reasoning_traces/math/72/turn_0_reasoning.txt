To determine how much money Tommy raises from selling brownies and cheesecakes, we need to calculate the total revenue from each type of dessert and then sum those amounts.

1. **Calculate the revenue from brownies:**
   - Tommy sells brownies for $3 each.
   - He sells a total of 43 brownies.
   - To find the total revenue from brownies, we multiply the number of brownies sold by the price per brownie:
     \[
     \text{Revenue from brownies} = \text{Number of brownies} \times \text{Price per brownie}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Revenue from brownies} = 43 \times 3
     \]
     \[
     \text{Revenue from brownies} = 129
     \]

2. **Calculate the revenue from cheesecakes:**
   - Tommy sells cheesecakes for $4 each.
   - He sells a total of 23 slices of cheesecake.
   - To find the total revenue from cheesecakes, we multiply the number of cheesecakes sold by the price per cheesecake:
     \[
     \text{Revenue from cheesecakes} = \text{Number of cheesecakes} \times \text{Price per cheesecake}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Revenue from cheesecakes} = 23 \times 4
     \]
     \[
     \text{Revenue from cheesecakes} = 92
     \]

3. **Calculate the total revenue:**
   - Now, we add the revenue from brownies and cheesecakes to find the total amount raised:
     \[
     \text{Total revenue} = \text{Revenue from brownies} + \text{Revenue from cheesecakes}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total revenue} = 129 + 92
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total revenue} = 221
     \]

Thus, the total amount of money that Tommy raises from selling brownies and cheesecakes is **$221**.

**Final Answer: $221**
