==================================================

First, we need to find the volume of the aquarium. The volume of a rectangular prism (which is what this aquarium is) is found by multiplying the length, width, and height. So, the volume of the aquarium is 4 feet * 6 feet * 3 feet = 72 cubic feet.

Nancy initially fills the aquarium halfway, so she fills it with 72 cubic feet / 2 = 36 cubic feet of water.

Then, her cat knocks the aquarium over and spills half the water. This means that half of the 36 cubic feet of water is left, which is 36 cubic feet / 2 = 18 cubic feet of water.

Finally, Nancy comes back and triples the amount of water in the aquarium. This means she adds 2 times the current amount of water, because tripling something means adding two more of it. So, she adds 18 cubic feet * 2 = 36 cubic feet of water.

Adding this to the 18 cubic feet of water already in the aquarium, we find that the aquarium now contains 18 cubic feet + 36 cubic feet = 54 cubic feet of water.

So, the final answer is that there are 54 cubic feet of water in the aquarium.
