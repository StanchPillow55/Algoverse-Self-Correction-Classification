==================================================

To solve the problem effectively, let's first understand what "Sample reasoning question 148" might entail. Since the problem statement is not explicitly provided, I'll assume it involves a typical math reasoning question that requires logical thinking and problem-solving skills. I'll create a hypothetical problem and solve it step by step.

### Hypothetical Problem:
**Question 148:** A farmer has a rectangular field that is 100 meters long and 60 meters wide. He wants to divide the field into smaller, equal-sized square plots. What is the largest possible side length of each square plot?

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We have a rectangular field with dimensions 100 meters by 60 meters.
   - We need to divide this field into square plots of equal size.
   - The goal is to find the largest possible side length for these square plots.

2. **Identify the Mathematical Concept:**
   - To find the largest possible side length of the square plots, we need to determine the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the two dimensions of the rectangle (100 and 60).

3. **Calculate the GCD:**
   - The GCD of two numbers is the largest number that divides both numbers without leaving a remainder.
   - We can use the Euclidean algorithm to find the GCD.

4. **Apply the Euclidean Algorithm:**
   - Start with the two numbers: 100 and 60.
   - Divide 100 by 60, which gives a quotient of 1 and a remainder of 40.
   - Now, take the divisor (60) and divide it by the remainder (40).
   - 60 divided by 40 gives a quotient of 1 and a remainder of 20.
   - Next, take the divisor (40) and divide it by the remainder (20).
   - 40 divided by 20 gives a quotient of 2 and a remainder of 0.
   - Since the remainder is now 0, the last non-zero remainder is the GCD.

5. **Determine the GCD:**
   - The GCD of 100 and 60 is 20.

6. **Interpret the Result:**
   - The largest possible side length for the square plots is 20 meters.

7. **Verify the Solution:**
   - Check if 20 meters divides both 100 meters and 60 meters without leaving a remainder:
     - 100 รท 20 = 5 (no remainder)
     - 60 รท 20 = 3 (no remainder)
   - Both divisions confirm that 20 meters is a valid side length for the square plots.

### Final Answer:
The largest possible side length of each square plot is 20 meters.
