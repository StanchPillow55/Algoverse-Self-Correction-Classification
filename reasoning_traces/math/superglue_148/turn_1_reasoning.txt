==================================================

To solve this problem, I need more specific information about "Sample reasoning question 148." Since the question itself is not provided, I'll demonstrate how to approach a typical math problem by creating a hypothetical example and solving it step by step.

Let's assume "Sample reasoning question 148" is a math problem involving algebra. Here's a hypothetical problem:

**Problem:** Solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 3x + 5 = 20 \).

**Step 1: Understand the Problem**

The equation given is \( 3x + 5 = 20 \). Our goal is to find the value of \( x \) that makes this equation true.

**Step 2: Isolate the Variable**

To solve for \( x \), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We can do this by performing inverse operations.

**Step 3: Perform Inverse Operations**

1. **Subtract 5 from both sides:**  
   \[
   3x + 5 - 5 = 20 - 5
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   3x = 15
   \]

2. **Divide both sides by 3:**  
   \[
   \frac{3x}{3} = \frac{15}{3}
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   x = 5
   \]

**Step 4: Verify the Solution**

To ensure our solution is correct, substitute \( x = 5 \) back into the original equation:

\[
3(5) + 5 = 20
\]

Calculate the left side:

\[
15 + 5 = 20
\]

Since both sides of the equation are equal, our solution \( x = 5 \) is verified.

**Final Answer:**

The solution to the equation \( 3x + 5 = 20 \) is \( x = 5 \).

This is a demonstration of how to approach a math problem step by step. If you have a specific problem or more details about "Sample reasoning question 148," please provide them, and I can offer a more tailored solution.
