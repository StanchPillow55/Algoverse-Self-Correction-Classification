==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample reasoning question 148," we need to first understand what the problem is asking. However, since the problem statement is not provided, I'll demonstrate a general approach to solving a math problem by creating a hypothetical problem and solving it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**

Let's say the problem is: "A rectangle has a length that is 3 times its width. If the perimeter of the rectangle is 48 units, what are the dimensions of the rectangle?"

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We have a rectangle with a length (L) and width (W).
   - The length is 3 times the width: \( L = 3W \).
   - The perimeter of the rectangle is 48 units.

2. **Recall the Formula for Perimeter:**
   - The perimeter (P) of a rectangle is given by the formula:
     \[
     P = 2L + 2W
     \]
   - We know \( P = 48 \).

3. **Substitute the Known Values:**
   - Substitute \( L = 3W \) into the perimeter formula:
     \[
     48 = 2(3W) + 2W
     \]

4. **Simplify and Solve for W:**
   - Simplify the equation:
     \[
     48 = 6W + 2W
     \]
     \[
     48 = 8W
     \]
   - Divide both sides by 8 to solve for W:
     \[
     W = \frac{48}{8} = 6
     \]

5. **Find the Length (L):**
   - Since \( L = 3W \), substitute \( W = 6 \):
     \[
     L = 3 \times 6 = 18
     \]

6. **Verify the Solution:**
   - Check if the dimensions satisfy the perimeter condition:
     \[
     P = 2L + 2W = 2(18) + 2(6) = 36 + 12 = 48
     \]
   - The calculated perimeter matches the given perimeter, confirming our solution is correct.

**Final Answer:**

The dimensions of the rectangle are:
- Width (W) = 6 units
- Length (L) = 18 units

This approach demonstrates how to solve a problem by understanding the requirements, using relevant formulas, substituting known values, solving for unknowns, and verifying the solution.
