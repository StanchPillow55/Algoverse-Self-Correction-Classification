Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem effectively, let's first understand what "Sample reasoning question 148" might entail. Since the problem statement is not explicitly provided, I'll assume it involves a typical reasoning or logic problem that requires a structured approach to solve. I'll outline a generic method to tackle such problems, which can be adapted to specific scenarios.

### Step-by-Step Approach:

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - Carefully read the problem statement.
   - Identify what is being asked. Are we solving for a number, a pattern, a logical conclusion, etc.?
   - Note any given data or constraints.

2. **Identify the Type of Problem:**
   - Determine if it's a mathematical problem (e.g., algebra, geometry), a logic puzzle, or a word problem.
   - This will guide the method of solution.

3. **Organize the Information:**
   - List out known values, variables, and relationships.
   - Draw diagrams or tables if necessary to visualize the problem.

4. **Develop a Strategy:**
   - Decide on a method to solve the problem. This could involve setting up equations, using logical deduction, or applying a specific formula.
   - Consider breaking the problem into smaller, more manageable parts.

5. **Execute the Plan:**
   - Carry out the calculations or logical steps needed to solve the problem.
   - Be meticulous with arithmetic and algebraic manipulations.

6. **Check the Solution:**
   - Verify that the solution satisfies all the conditions of the problem.
   - Double-check calculations and logic for accuracy.

7. **State the Final Answer:**
   - Clearly present the solution, ensuring it answers the question posed.

### Example Application:

Since we don't have a specific problem, let's consider a hypothetical example:

**Problem:** Find the sum of all even numbers between 1 and 100.

**Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We need to find the sum of even numbers from 1 to 100.

2. **Identify the Type of Problem:**
   - This is a straightforward arithmetic problem involving a sequence of numbers.

3. **Organize the Information:**
   - Even numbers between 1 and 100 are: 2, 4, 6, ..., 100.

4. **Develop a Strategy:**
   - Use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series: \( S_n = \frac{n}{2} \times (a + l) \)
   - Where \( n \) is the number of terms, \( a \) is the first term, and \( l \) is the last term.

5. **Execute the Plan:**
   - First term \( a = 2 \), last term \( l = 100 \).
   - The common difference \( d = 2 \).
   - Number of terms \( n \) can be found by: \( n = \frac{l - a}{d} + 1 = \frac{100 - 2}{2} + 1 = 50 \).
   - Sum \( S_n = \frac{50}{2} \times (2 + 100) = 25 \times 102 = 2550 \).

6. **Check the Solution:**
   - Verify the calculation: \( 25 \times 102 = 2550 \).

7. **State the Final Answer:**
   - The sum of all even numbers between 1 and 100 is 2550.

This structured approach ensures that we thoroughly understand and solve the problem, even when the specific details are not initially clear.
