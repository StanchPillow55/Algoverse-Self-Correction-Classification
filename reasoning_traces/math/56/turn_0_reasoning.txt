To determine how many times Peter can go to the movies, we need to calculate the total cost for each trip and then see how many times that cost fits into his budget.

1. **Calculate the total cost for one trip to the movies:**
   - The cost of a movie ticket is $7.
   - The cost of popcorn is also $7.
   - Therefore, the total cost for one trip is:
     \[
     \text{Total cost per trip} = \text{Cost of ticket} + \text{Cost of popcorn} = 7 + 7 = 14 \text{ dollars}
     \]

2. **Determine how many trips he can afford with his budget:**
   - Peter has a total of $42 for the week.
   - To find out how many trips he can take, we divide his total budget by the cost per trip:
     \[
     \text{Number of trips} = \frac{\text{Total budget}}{\text{Total cost per trip}} = \frac{42}{14}
     \]

3. **Perform the division:**
   \[
   \frac{42}{14} = 3
   \]

4. **Conclusion:**
   - Peter can afford to go to the movies 3 times with his budget of $42.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{3}
\]
