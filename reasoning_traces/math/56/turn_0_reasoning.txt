Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step.

1. **Identify the time taken for each part of the assignment:**
   - Leo finished the first part in 25 minutes.
   - It took him twice as long to finish the second part. Therefore, the time taken for the second part is:
     \[
     \text{Time for second part} = 2 \times 25 \text{ minutes} = 50 \text{ minutes}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total time spent on the first and second parts:**
   - The total time spent on the first and second parts is:
     \[
     \text{Total time for first and second parts} = 25 \text{ minutes} + 50 \text{ minutes} = 75 \text{ minutes}
     \]

3. **Convert the total time Leo spent on the assignment from hours to minutes:**
   - Leo finished his assignment in 2 hours. To convert hours to minutes:
     \[
     2 \text{ hours} = 2 \times 60 \text{ minutes} = 120 \text{ minutes}
     \]

4. **Calculate the time spent on the third part:**
   - To find the time spent on the third part, we subtract the total time spent on the first and second parts from the total time spent on the assignment:
     \[
     \text{Time for third part} = \text{Total time} - \text{Total time for first and second parts}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Time for third part} = 120 \text{ minutes} - 75 \text{ minutes} = 45 \text{ minutes}
     \]

5. **Final answer:**
   - Leo finished the third part of the assignment in **45 minutes**.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{45}
\]
