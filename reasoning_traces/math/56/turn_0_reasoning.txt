Question ID: 56
Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, let's convert the total time Leo took to finish his assignment from hours to minutes. Since 1 hour is equal to 60 minutes, 2 hours is equal to 2*60 = 120 minutes.

Leo finished the first part of his assignment in 25 minutes.

It took him twice as long to finish the second part, which means he took 2*25 = 50 minutes to finish the second part.

The total time he took to finish the first and the second part is 25+50 = 75 minutes.

Since the total time he took to finish the assignment is 120 minutes, the time he took to finish the third part is 120-75 = 45 minutes.

Therefore, Leo took 45 minutes to finish the third part of his assignment.
