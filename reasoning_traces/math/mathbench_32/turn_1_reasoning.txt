==================================================

Certainly! However, the problem statement "Sample math problem 32" is not clear enough for me to understand what specific math problem you are referring to. It seems like a placeholder or a reference to a specific problem that might be in a textbook or a set of problems you have.

To help you effectively, I need more information about the problem. Could you please provide the full details of the math problem you want me to solve? Once you do that, I'll be able to work through it step by step and provide a complete solution.
