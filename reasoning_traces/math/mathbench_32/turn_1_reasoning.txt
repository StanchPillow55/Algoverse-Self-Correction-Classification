==================================================

To solve the problem, we first need to understand what "Sample math problem 32" refers to. Since no specific details are provided about the problem, I'll create a hypothetical math problem labeled as "Sample math problem 32" and solve it step by step.

**Sample Math Problem 32:**

*Problem Statement:*
Solve for \( x \) in the equation: 
\[ 3x^2 - 12x + 9 = 0 \]

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Identify the Type of Equation:**
   The given equation is a quadratic equation in the standard form \( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \), where \( a = 3 \), \( b = -12 \), and \( c = 9 \).

2. **Simplify the Equation:**
   Check if the equation can be simplified by factoring out the greatest common factor (GCF) of the coefficients. Here, the GCF of 3, 12, and 9 is 3. Divide the entire equation by 3:
   \[
   x^2 - 4x + 3 = 0
   \]

3. **Factor the Quadratic:**
   We need to factor the quadratic equation \( x^2 - 4x + 3 = 0 \). We look for two numbers whose product is 3 (the constant term) and whose sum is -4 (the coefficient of the linear term).

   The numbers -1 and -3 satisfy these conditions because:
   \[
   (-1) \times (-3) = 3 \quad \text{and} \quad (-1) + (-3) = -4
   \]

   Therefore, the equation factors as:
   \[
   (x - 1)(x - 3) = 0
   \]

4. **Solve for \( x \):**
   Set each factor equal to zero and solve for \( x \):
   \[
   x - 1 = 0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad x = 1
   \]
   \[
   x - 3 = 0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad x = 3
   \]

5. **Verify the Solutions:**
   Substitute \( x = 1 \) and \( x = 3 \) back into the original equation to verify:
   
   For \( x = 1 \):
   \[
   3(1)^2 - 12(1) + 9 = 3 - 12 + 9 = 0
   \]

   For \( x = 3 \):
   \[
   3(3)^2 - 12(3) + 9 = 27 - 36 + 9 = 0
   \]

   Both solutions satisfy the original equation.

**Final Answer:**
The solutions to the equation \( 3x^2 - 12x + 9 = 0 \) are \( x = 1 \) and \( x = 3 \).
