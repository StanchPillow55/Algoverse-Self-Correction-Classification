Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, I need more information about "Sample math problem 32" as it is not specified in the prompt. However, I can guide you through a generic approach to solving math problems by breaking down the process into clear steps. Let's assume a typical math problem involves solving an equation or finding a value. Here's a step-by-step approach:

### Step 1: Understand the Problem
- **Read the problem carefully.** Identify what is being asked. Are you solving for a variable, finding a sum, or proving a theorem?
- **Identify the given information.** What values, equations, or conditions are provided?

### Step 2: Devise a Plan
- **Choose a strategy.** Depending on the problem, you might use algebraic manipulation, substitution, elimination, or graphical methods.
- **Consider similar problems.** Have you solved a similar problem before? What methods did you use?

### Step 3: Carry Out the Plan
- **Execute your chosen strategy.** Perform calculations step by step.
- **Show all work.** Write down each step clearly to avoid mistakes and make it easy to review.

### Step 4: Review/Check Your Work
- **Verify your solution.** Check if your answer makes sense in the context of the problem.
- **Recalculate if necessary.** If something seems off, go through your steps again to find errors.

### Example Problem
Let's assume a simple algebra problem: Solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).

#### Step 1: Understand the Problem
- We need to find the value of \( x \) that satisfies the equation.

#### Step 2: Devise a Plan
- We will isolate \( x \) by performing algebraic operations.

#### Step 3: Carry Out the Plan
1. Start with the equation:  
   \[
   2x + 3 = 11
   \]
2. Subtract 3 from both sides to isolate the term with \( x \):  
   \[
   2x + 3 - 3 = 11 - 3
   \]
   \[
   2x = 8
   \]
3. Divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( x \):  
   \[
   \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{8}{2}
   \]
   \[
   x = 4
   \]

#### Step 4: Review/Check Your Work
- Substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation to verify:  
  \[
  2(4) + 3 = 8 + 3 = 11
  \]
- The left-hand side equals the right-hand side, confirming our solution is correct.

### Final Answer
The solution to the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \) is \( x = 4 \).
