==================================================

To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the total number of pages in the book**: 
   The book has a total of 120 pages.

2. **Calculate the number of pages Julie read yesterday**: 
   Julie read 12 pages yesterday.

3. **Calculate the number of pages Julie read today**: 
   Today, she read twice as many pages as she did yesterday. Therefore:
   \[
   \text{Pages read today} = 2 \times \text{Pages read yesterday} = 2 \times 12 = 24 \text{ pages}
   \]

4. **Calculate the total number of pages Julie has read so far**: 
   To find the total number of pages she has read, we add the pages read yesterday and today:
   \[
   \text{Total pages read} = \text{Pages read yesterday} + \text{Pages read today} = 12 + 24 = 36 \text{ pages}
   \]

5. **Calculate the remaining pages in the book**: 
   To find the remaining pages, we subtract the total pages read from the total pages in the book:
   \[
   \text{Remaining pages} = \text{Total pages} - \text{Total pages read} = 120 - 36 = 84 \text{ pages}
   \]

6. **Determine how many pages Julie wants to read tomorrow**: 
   Julie wants to read half of the remaining pages tomorrow. Therefore:
   \[
   \text{Pages to read tomorrow} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Remaining pages} = \frac{1}{2} \times 84 = 42 \text{ pages}
   \]

Finally, we conclude that Julie should read **42 pages** tomorrow.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{42}
\]
