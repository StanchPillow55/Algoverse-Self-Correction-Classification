Question ID: 3
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine how many pages Julie should read tomorrow if she wants to read half of the remaining pages after today.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Determine pages read yesterday and today:**
   - Yesterday, Julie read 12 pages.
   - Today, she read twice as many pages as yesterday. Therefore, today she read:
     \[
     2 \times 12 = 24 \text{ pages}
     \]

2. **Calculate total pages read so far:**
   - Total pages read by the end of today is the sum of pages read yesterday and today:
     \[
     12 + 24 = 36 \text{ pages}
     \]

3. **Calculate remaining pages in the book:**
   - The book has 120 pages in total. After reading 36 pages, the remaining pages are:
     \[
     120 - 36 = 84 \text{ pages}
     \]

4. **Determine how many pages to read tomorrow:**
   - Julie wants to read half of the remaining pages tomorrow. Therefore, she should read:
     \[
     \frac{84}{2} = 42 \text{ pages}
     \]

Thus, Julie should read 42 pages tomorrow to achieve her goal of reading half of the remaining pages.

**Final Answer: 42 pages**
