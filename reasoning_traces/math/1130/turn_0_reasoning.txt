To solve the problem, we will follow these steps:

1. **Determine the number of crayons per box**: Nik wants to separate his 200 crayons into groups of 8. We can find out how many boxes he will need by dividing the total number of crayons by the number of crayons per box.

   \[
   \text{Number of boxes} = \frac{\text{Total crayons}}{\text{Crayons per box}} = \frac{200}{8} = 25
   \]

2. **Calculate the weight of the crayons**: Since each crayon weighs 1 ounce, the total weight of the crayons can be calculated as follows:

   \[
   \text{Weight of crayons} = \text{Total crayons} \times \text{Weight per crayon} = 200 \times 1 = 200 \text{ ounces}
   \]

3. **Calculate the weight of the boxes**: Each box weighs 8 ounces, and since Nik has 25 boxes, the total weight of the boxes is:

   \[
   \text{Weight of boxes} = \text{Number of boxes} \times \text{Weight per box} = 25 \times 8 = 200 \text{ ounces}
   \]

4. **Calculate the total weight**: Now, we can find the total weight by adding the weight of the crayons and the weight of the boxes:

   \[
   \text{Total weight} = \text{Weight of crayons} + \text{Weight of boxes} = 200 + 200 = 400 \text{ ounces}
   \]

5. **Convert ounces to pounds**: Since there are 16 ounces in a pound, we convert the total weight from ounces to pounds:

   \[
   \text{Total weight in pounds} = \frac{\text{Total weight in ounces}}{16} = \frac{400}{16} = 25 \text{ pounds}
   \]

Thus, the total weight of the crayons and the boxes is:

\[
\boxed{25} \text{ pounds}
\]
