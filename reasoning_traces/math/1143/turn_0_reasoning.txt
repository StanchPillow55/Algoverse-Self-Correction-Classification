==================================================

To determine how many lemons Tim collects in a decade from his trees, we can break the problem down into several steps.

1. **Identify the number of trees**: Tim has 5 trees.

2. **Determine the number of lemons collected per tree each year**: Tim collects 6 lemons from each tree every year.

3. **Calculate the total number of lemons collected from all trees in one year**:
   - Since Tim has 5 trees and collects 6 lemons from each tree, we can calculate the total lemons collected in one year as follows:
   \[
   \text{Total lemons in one year} = \text{Number of trees} \times \text{Lemons per tree}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total lemons in one year} = 5 \text{ trees} \times 6 \text{ lemons/tree} = 30 \text{ lemons}
   \]

4. **Determine the number of years in a decade**: A decade consists of 10 years.

5. **Calculate the total number of lemons collected in a decade**:
   - To find the total lemons collected over a decade, we multiply the total lemons collected in one year by the number of years in a decade:
   \[
   \text{Total lemons in a decade} = \text{Total lemons in one year} \times \text{Number of years in a decade}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total lemons in a decade} = 30 \text{ lemons/year} \times 10 \text{ years} = 300 \text{ lemons}
   \]

Thus, after performing all the calculations and reasoning through the steps, we find that Tim collects a total of **300 lemons** in a decade.

Final answer: **300 lemons**.
