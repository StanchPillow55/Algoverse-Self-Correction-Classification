==================================================

To solve the problem, I need more specific information about "Sample reasoning question 166." Since the question is not provided, I'll guide you through a general approach to solving a typical math reasoning problem. If you have a specific problem in mind, please provide the details, and I'll be happy to help with that.

### General Approach to Solving Math Reasoning Problems:

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - Carefully read the problem statement.
   - Identify what is being asked.
   - Determine what information is given and what needs to be found.

2. **Devise a Plan:**
   - Think about the strategies that could be used to solve the problem. This might include drawing a diagram, creating an equation, or breaking the problem into smaller parts.

3. **Carry Out the Plan:**
   - Execute the steps you have planned.
   - Perform calculations carefully.
   - Keep track of your work to ensure each step logically follows the previous one.

4. **Review/Check Your Work:**
   - Verify each step to ensure accuracy.
   - Check if the final answer makes sense in the context of the problem.
   - Re-evaluate the problem if necessary to ensure nothing was overlooked.

### Example Problem:

**Problem:** A rectangle has a length that is twice its width. If the perimeter of the rectangle is 36 units, what are the dimensions of the rectangle?

**Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We need to find the length and width of the rectangle.
   - The perimeter is given as 36 units.
   - The length is twice the width.

2. **Devise a Plan:**
   - Use the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle: \( P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width}) \).
   - Let the width be \( w \).
   - Then the length is \( 2w \).

3. **Carry Out the Plan:**
   - Substitute the expressions for length and width into the perimeter formula:
     \[
     36 = 2 \times (2w + w)
     \]
   - Simplify the equation:
     \[
     36 = 2 \times 3w
     \]
     \[
     36 = 6w
     \]
   - Solve for \( w \):
     \[
     w = \frac{36}{6} = 6
     \]
   - Find the length:
     \[
     \text{Length} = 2w = 2 \times 6 = 12
     \]

4. **Review/Check Your Work:**
   - Check the perimeter with the found dimensions:
     \[
     P = 2 \times (12 + 6) = 2 \times 18 = 36
     \]
   - The calculations are correct, and the dimensions satisfy the conditions given in the problem.

**Final Answer:**
- The width of the rectangle is 6 units, and the length is 12 units.

If you have a specific problem or question in mind, please provide the details, and I'll be glad to assist you further!
