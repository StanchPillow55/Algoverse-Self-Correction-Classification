==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 166" refers to. Since the problem statement is not explicitly provided, let's assume a hypothetical math problem and solve it step by step. 

Let's assume the problem is as follows:

**Problem:**
A company produces two types of widgets: Type A and Type B. The company sells Type A widgets for $50 each and Type B widgets for $70 each. In a given month, the company sold a total of 200 widgets and made $11,000 in revenue. How many of each type of widget did the company sell?

**Solution:**

To solve this problem, we need to set up a system of equations based on the information given.

1. **Define the variables:**
   - Let \( x \) be the number of Type A widgets sold.
   - Let \( y \) be the number of Type B widgets sold.

2. **Set up the equations:**
   - The total number of widgets sold is 200:
     \[
     x + y = 200
     \]
   - The total revenue from selling the widgets is $11,000:
     \[
     50x + 70y = 11,000
     \]

3. **Solve the system of equations:**

   We have the following system of equations:
   \[
   x + y = 200
   \]
   \[
   50x + 70y = 11,000
   \]

   We can solve this system using the substitution or elimination method. Let's use the substitution method.

   From the first equation, solve for \( y \):
   \[
   y = 200 - x
   \]

   Substitute \( y = 200 - x \) into the second equation:
   \[
   50x + 70(200 - x) = 11,000
   \]

   Simplify and solve for \( x \):
   \[
   50x + 14,000 - 70x = 11,000
   \]
   \[
   -20x + 14,000 = 11,000
   \]
   \[
   -20x = 11,000 - 14,000
   \]
   \[
   -20x = -3,000
   \]
   \[
   x = \frac{-3,000}{-20}
   \]
   \[
   x = 150
   \]

   Now, substitute \( x = 150 \) back into the equation for \( y \):
   \[
   y = 200 - x = 200 - 150 = 50
   \]

4. **Verify the solution:**

   Check that these values satisfy both original equations:
   - \( x + y = 150 + 50 = 200 \) (satisfied)
   - \( 50x + 70y = 50(150) + 70(50) = 7,500 + 3,500 = 11,000 \) (satisfied)

Both equations are satisfied, so the solution is correct.

**Final Answer:**
The company sold 150 Type A widgets and 50 Type B widgets.
