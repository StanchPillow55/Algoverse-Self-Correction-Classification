==================================================

To solve a math problem effectively, it's important to understand the question, identify the relevant information, and apply appropriate mathematical concepts. However, the problem statement you've provided, "Sample reasoning question 166," lacks specific details or numerical information. Therefore, I will guide you through a general approach to solving math problems, which you can apply to any specific problem you encounter.

### General Approach to Solving Math Problems

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - Read the problem carefully.
   - Identify what is being asked.
   - Determine what information is given and what needs to be found.

2. **Devise a Plan:**
   - Consider similar problems you have solved before.
   - Think about the mathematical concepts that might apply (e.g., algebra, geometry, calculus).
   - Decide on a strategy to solve the problem (e.g., drawing a diagram, creating an equation).

3. **Carry Out the Plan:**
   - Execute your chosen strategy step by step.
   - Perform calculations carefully.
   - Keep track of units and ensure consistency.

4. **Review/Check Your Work:**
   - Verify each step of your solution.
   - Check if your answer makes sense in the context of the problem.
   - Consider alternative methods to confirm your result.

### Example Problem and Solution

Since the original problem is not specified, let's consider a simple example problem:

**Example Problem:**
Solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).

**Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We need to find the value of \( x \) that satisfies the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).

2. **Devise a Plan:**
   - We can solve this linear equation by isolating \( x \).

3. **Carry Out the Plan:**
   - Start by subtracting 3 from both sides of the equation:
     \[
     2x + 3 - 3 = 11 - 3
     \]
     \[
     2x = 8
     \]
   - Next, divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( x \):
     \[
     \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{8}{2}
     \]
     \[
     x = 4
     \]

4. **Review/Check Your Work:**
   - Substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation to verify:
     \[
     2(4) + 3 = 8 + 3 = 11
     \]
   - Since both sides of the equation are equal, the solution is correct.

**Final Answer:**
\( x = 4 \)

This structured approach can be applied to a wide range of math problems. If you have a specific problem in mind, please provide the details, and I can offer a more targeted solution.
