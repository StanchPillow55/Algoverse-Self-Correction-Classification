==================================================

To solve the sample math problem 280, let's assume that the problem is asking us to perform some mathematical operation or solve an equation involving the number 280. Since the problem is not explicitly stated, I'll demonstrate a few different types of mathematical operations involving the number 280 to cover various possibilities.

### Example 1: Prime Factorization of 280

Let's find the prime factorization of 280.

1. **Divide by the smallest prime number (2):**
   \[
   280 \div 2 = 140
   \]
   So, 280 = 2 × 140.

2. **Continue dividing by 2:**
   \[
   140 \div 2 = 70
   \]
   So, 140 = 2 × 70, and thus 280 = 2 × 2 × 70.

3. **Continue dividing by 2:**
   \[
   70 \div 2 = 35
   \]
   So, 70 = 2 × 35, and thus 280 = 2 × 2 × 2 × 35.

4. **Now divide by the next smallest prime number (5):**
   \[
   35 \div 5 = 7
   \]
   So, 35 = 5 × 7, and thus 280 = 2 × 2 × 2 × 5 × 7.

Therefore, the prime factorization of 280 is:
\[
280 = 2^3 \times 5 \times 7
\]

### Example 2: Solving a Simple Equation Involving 280

Suppose we have an equation where we need to solve for \( x \):
\[
x + 280 = 500
\]

To solve for \( x \), subtract 280 from both sides:
\[
x = 500 - 280
\]
\[
x = 220
\]

### Example 3: Calculating the Square Root of 280

Let's approximate the square root of 280.

1. **Estimate the square root:**
   Since \( 16^2 = 256 \) and \( 17^2 = 289 \), the square root of 280 is between 16 and 17.

2. **Refine the estimate:**
   Try \( 16.5 \):
   \[
   16.5^2 = 272.25
   \]
   Try \( 16.7 \):
   \[
   16.7^2 = 278.89
   \]
   Try \( 16.8 \):
   \[
   16.8^2 = 282.24
   \]

The square root of 280 is approximately 16.7.

### Final Answer

Since the problem was not explicitly defined, I demonstrated different operations involving the number 280. Here are the results:

1. **Prime Factorization:** \( 280 = 2^3 \times 5 \times 7 \)
2. **Solution to the Equation \( x + 280 = 500 \):** \( x = 220 \)
3. **Approximate Square Root:** \( \sqrt{280} \approx 16.7 \)

If you have a specific operation or problem in mind involving the number 280, please provide more details for a precise solution.
