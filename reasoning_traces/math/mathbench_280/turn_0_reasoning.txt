==================================================

It seems like the problem statement is incomplete or unclear. "Sample math problem 280" doesn't provide enough information to determine what the problem is asking. However, I can guide you through a general approach to solving math problems if you provide more details or specify the type of problem you're dealing with (e.g., algebra, calculus, geometry, etc.).

If you have a specific math problem in mind, please provide the complete problem statement, and I'll be happy to help you solve it step by step.
