To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample math problem 280" refers to. Since there is no specific problem statement provided, I'll create a hypothetical math problem related to the number 280 and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**
Find the prime factorization of the number 280 and use it to determine the number of divisors of 280.

**Step 1: Prime Factorization of 280**

To find the prime factorization, we start by dividing 280 by the smallest prime number, which is 2.

1. \( 280 \div 2 = 140 \)

Since 140 is even, we divide by 2 again.

2. \( 140 \div 2 = 70 \)

70 is also even, so we divide by 2 once more.

3. \( 70 \div 2 = 35 \)

35 is not divisible by 2, so we move to the next smallest prime number, which is 3. Since 35 is not divisible by 3, we try the next prime number, which is 5.

4. \( 35 \div 5 = 7 \)

Finally, 7 is a prime number, so we stop here.

Thus, the prime factorization of 280 is:
\[ 280 = 2^3 \times 5^1 \times 7^1 \]

**Step 2: Determine the Number of Divisors**

To find the number of divisors of a number given its prime factorization, we use the formula:
\[ (e_1 + 1)(e_2 + 1)(e_3 + 1) \ldots (e_n + 1) \]
where \( e_1, e_2, e_3, \ldots, e_n \) are the exponents in the prime factorization.

For 280, the prime factorization is \( 2^3 \times 5^1 \times 7^1 \). Therefore, the exponents are 3, 1, and 1.

Applying the formula:
\[ (3 + 1)(1 + 1)(1 + 1) = 4 \times 2 \times 2 = 16 \]

**Final Answer:**

The prime factorization of 280 is \( 2^3 \times 5^1 \times 7^1 \), and the number of divisors of 280 is 16.
