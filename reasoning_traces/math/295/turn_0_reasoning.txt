==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine how many bags of apples Pam has, given the information about the number of apples in her bags and the total number of apples she possesses.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Understand the relationship between Pam's bags and Gerald's bags:**
   - We are told that each of Pam's bags has as many apples as 3 of Gerald's bags.
   - Gerald's bags contain 40 apples each.

2. **Calculate the number of apples in one of Pam's bags:**
   - Since each of Pam's bags has as many apples as 3 of Gerald's bags, we need to calculate how many apples are in 3 of Gerald's bags.
   - Number of apples in one of Gerald's bags = 40 apples.
   - Therefore, number of apples in 3 of Gerald's bags = \(3 \times 40 = 120\) apples.

3. **Determine the number of bags Pam has:**
   - Pam has a total of 1200 apples.
   - Each of Pam's bags contains 120 apples.
   - To find out how many bags Pam has, we divide the total number of apples by the number of apples per bag:
   \[
   \text{Number of bags Pam has} = \frac{\text{Total number of apples}}{\text{Number of apples per bag}} = \frac{1200}{120}
   \]

4. **Perform the division:**
   \[
   \frac{1200}{120} = 10
   \]

Therefore, Pam has 10 bags of apples.

**Final Answer:**
Pam has 10 bags of apples.
