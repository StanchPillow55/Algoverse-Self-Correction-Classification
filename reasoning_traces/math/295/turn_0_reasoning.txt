==================================================

To find the total count of the activities Darren has done over the two days, we will first calculate the number of each exercise he performed on both days and then sum them up.

**Day 1:**
- Pushups: 100
- Squats: 50
- Dumbbell presses: 20

**Day 2:**
- Pushups: On the second day, Darren does 20 more pushups than on the first day. Therefore:
  \[
  \text{Pushups on Day 2} = 100 + 20 = 120
  \]

- Squats: On the second day, he does ten fewer squats than on the first day. Therefore:
  \[
  \text{Squats on Day 2} = 50 - 10 = 40
  \]

- Dumbbell presses: On the second day, he doubles the number of dumbbell presses from the first day. Therefore:
  \[
  \text{Dumbbell presses on Day 2} = 2 \times 20 = 40
  \]

Now, we can summarize the total number of exercises performed on both days:

**Total exercises on Day 1:**
- Pushups: 100
- Squats: 50
- Dumbbell presses: 20

Total for Day 1:
\[
\text{Total Day 1} = 100 + 50 + 20 = 170
\]

**Total exercises on Day 2:**
- Pushups: 120
- Squats: 40
- Dumbbell presses: 40

Total for Day 2:
\[
\text{Total Day 2} = 120 + 40 + 40 = 200
\]

Finally, we add the totals from both days to find the overall total:
\[
\text{Overall Total} = \text{Total Day 1} + \text{Total Day 2} = 170 + 200 = 370
\]

Thus, the total count of the activities Darren has done in the two days is:
\[
\boxed{370}
\]
