==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to determine how many bags of apples Pam has, given the relationship between her bags and Gerald's bags.

1. **Identify the number of apples in Gerald's bags**:
   - Each of Gerald's bags contains 40 apples.

2. **Determine the number of apples in Pam's bags**:
   - According to the problem, each of Pam's bags has as many apples as 3 of Gerald's bags.
   - Since each of Gerald's bags has 40 apples, the number of apples in 3 of Gerald's bags is:
     \[
     3 \times 40 = 120 \text{ apples}
     \]
   - Therefore, each of Pam's bags contains 120 apples.

3. **Calculate the total number of bags Pam has**:
   - We know that Pam has a total of 1200 apples.
   - To find out how many bags of apples Pam has, we divide the total number of apples by the number of apples in each bag:
     \[
     \text{Number of bags} = \frac{\text{Total apples}}{\text{Apples per bag}} = \frac{1200}{120}
     \]
   - Performing the division:
     \[
     \frac{1200}{120} = 10
     \]

4. **Conclusion**:
   - Pam has a total of 10 bags of apples.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{10}
\]
