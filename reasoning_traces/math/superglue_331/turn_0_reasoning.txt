   - Include units if applicable.

### Example Problem

Let's apply this approach to a simple example problem:

**Example Problem:**
A rectangle has a length of 10 units and a width of 5 units. What is the area of the rectangle?

**Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We need to find the area of a rectangle.
   - Given: Length = 10 units, Width = 5 units.

2. **Devise a Plan:**
   - Use the formula for the area of a rectangle: Area = Length Ã— Width.

3. **Carry Out the Plan:**
   - Substitute the given values into the formula:
     \[
     \text{Area} = 10 \, \text{units} \times 5 \, \text{units} = 50 \, \text{square units}
     \]

4. **Review/Check the Solution:**
   - The calculation is straightforward and correct.
   - The units are consistent, and the result is in square units, which is appropriate for area.

5. **State the Final Answer:**
   - The area of the rectangle is 50 square units.
