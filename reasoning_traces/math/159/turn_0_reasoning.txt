==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to determine how much Mario would have paid for his haircut on the day before Monday, which is Sunday. We know that haircuts at Mario's barbershop are 50% more expensive during the weekends compared to weekdays.

1. **Identify the cost of a haircut on a weekday:**
   Mario paid $18 for his haircut on Monday. Since Monday is a weekday, this amount is the regular price for a haircut.

   \[
   \text{Cost on Monday (weekday)} = 18 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Determine the weekend price:**
   Since haircuts are 50% more expensive on weekends, we need to calculate the weekend price based on the weekday price.

   To find the weekend price, we first calculate 50% of the weekday price:

   \[
   50\% \text{ of } 18 = 0.50 \times 18 = 9 \text{ dollars}
   \]

   Now, we add this amount to the weekday price to find the weekend price:

   \[
   \text{Weekend price} = \text{Weekday price} + 50\% \text{ of Weekday price}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Weekend price} = 18 + 9 = 27 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Conclusion:**
   Since we are asked how much Mario would have paid the day before (Sunday), we conclude that on Sunday, the haircut would cost $27, which is the weekend price.

Thus, the final answer is:

\[
\text{Mario would have paid } 27 \text{ dollars on Sunday.}
\]
