To solve this problem, we need to determine the cost of a haircut on the weekend given that it is 50% more expensive than on a weekday. We know that Mario paid $18 for a haircut on Monday, which is a weekday.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the weekday price:**
   - Mario paid $18 for a haircut on Monday. Therefore, the weekday price of a haircut is $18.

2. **Determine the weekend price increase:**
   - The problem states that haircuts are 50% more expensive during the weekends. To find out how much more expensive the haircut is on the weekend, we need to calculate 50% of the weekday price.
   - 50% of $18 is calculated as follows:
     \[
     0.50 \times 18 = 9
     \]
   - This means the haircut is $9 more expensive on the weekend.

3. **Calculate the weekend price:**
   - To find the weekend price, we add the additional cost to the weekday price:
     \[
     18 + 9 = 27
     \]

Therefore, if Mario had gotten his haircut on the weekend, he would have paid $27.

**Final Answer:**
Mario would have paid $27 for his haircut on the weekend.
