Question ID: mathbench_421
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 421," we need to first understand what the problem is asking. However, the problem statement "Sample math problem 421" is not specific and does not provide any details about the mathematical problem to be solved. Therefore, I will assume this is a placeholder and create a sample math problem to solve.

Let's assume the problem is as follows:

**Problem:**
Calculate the sum of the first 421 positive integers.

To solve this problem, we can use the formula for the sum of the first \( n \) positive integers:

\[
S_n = \frac{n(n + 1)}{2}
\]

where \( S_n \) is the sum of the first \( n \) positive integers.

**Step-by-step Solution:**

1. **Identify \( n \):**  
   In this problem, \( n = 421 \).

2. **Apply the formula:**  
   Substitute \( n = 421 \) into the formula:

   \[
   S_{421} = \frac{421(421 + 1)}{2}
   \]

3. **Calculate \( 421 + 1 \):**  
   \[
   421 + 1 = 422
   \]

4. **Multiply 421 by 422:**  
   \[
   421 \times 422 = 177562
   \]

5. **Divide the product by 2:**  
   \[
   \frac{177562}{2} = 88781
   \]

**Final Answer:**

The sum of the first 421 positive integers is \( 88781 \).

Therefore, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{88781}
\]
