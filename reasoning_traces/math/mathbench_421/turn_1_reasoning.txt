Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the sample math problem 421, let's first clarify what the problem is asking. Since "Sample math problem 421" is not specific, I'll assume it's a placeholder for a typical math problem. Without specific details, I'll create a hypothetical problem and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**

Let's assume problem 421 is as follows:

"Calculate the sum of the first 421 positive integers."

**Step-by-step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We need to find the sum of the first 421 positive integers. This is a classic problem that can be solved using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series.

2. **Identify the Formula:**
   - The sum \( S \) of the first \( n \) positive integers is given by the formula:
     \[
     S = \frac{n(n + 1)}{2}
     \]
   - Here, \( n = 421 \).

3. **Substitute the Value:**
   - Substitute \( n = 421 \) into the formula:
     \[
     S = \frac{421 \times (421 + 1)}{2}
     \]

4. **Perform the Calculations:**
   - First, calculate \( 421 + 1 \):
     \[
     421 + 1 = 422
     \]
   - Next, calculate \( 421 \times 422 \):
     \[
     421 \times 422 = 177562
     \]
   - Finally, divide by 2 to find the sum:
     \[
     S = \frac{177562}{2} = 88781
     \]

5. **Verify the Calculation:**
   - Double-check the multiplication and division to ensure accuracy:
     - \( 421 \times 422 = 177562 \) is correct.
     - \( 177562 \div 2 = 88781 \) is correct.

6. **State the Final Answer:**
   - The sum of the first 421 positive integers is \( 88781 \).

Therefore, the final answer to the hypothetical problem is:

**Final Answer: 88781**
