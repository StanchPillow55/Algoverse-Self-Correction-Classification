Question ID: mathbench_421
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 421," we need to first understand what the problem is asking. However, the problem statement "Sample math problem 421" is not specific and does not provide any details about what needs to be solved. 

In a typical scenario, a math problem would include specific details such as equations, numbers, or a description of a situation that requires mathematical analysis. Since we don't have any of these details, let's consider a hypothetical approach to solving a generic math problem.

### Step-by-Step Approach to Solving a Generic Math Problem:

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - Identify what is being asked.
   - Determine what information is given.
   - Note any assumptions or constraints.

2. **Devise a Plan:**
   - Consider possible strategies to solve the problem, such as:
     - Drawing a diagram.
     - Writing an equation.
     - Breaking the problem into smaller parts.
     - Looking for patterns.

3. **Carry Out the Plan:**
   - Execute the chosen strategy.
   - Perform calculations carefully.
   - Keep track of units and signs.

4. **Review/Check the Solution:**
   - Verify that the solution makes sense in the context of the problem.
   - Check calculations for accuracy.
   - Ensure that the solution answers the question posed.

### Example Problem:

Since we don't have a specific problem, let's create a simple example:

**Problem:** Solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).

**Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We need to find the value of \( x \) that satisfies the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).

2. **Devise a Plan:**
   - Isolate \( x \) on one side of the equation.

3. **Carry Out the Plan:**
   - Subtract 3 from both sides of the equation:
     \[
     2x + 3 - 3 = 11 - 3
     \]
     \[
     2x = 8
     \]
   - Divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( x \):
     \[
     x = \frac{8}{2}
     \]
     \[
     x = 4
     \]

4. **Review/Check the Solution:**
   - Substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation to verify:
     \[
     2(4) + 3 = 8 + 3 = 11
     \]
   - The left side equals the right side, confirming that \( x = 4 \) is correct.

**Final Answer:** \( x = 4 \)

In conclusion, without a specific problem statement for "Sample math problem 421," I provided a general approach to solving math problems and demonstrated it with a simple example. If you have a specific problem in mind, please provide more details so I can assist you further.
