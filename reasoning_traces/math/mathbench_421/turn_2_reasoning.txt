Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem labeled "Sample math problem 421," we first need to understand what the problem is asking. However, since "Sample math problem 421" is not a specific problem statement, I'll create a hypothetical math problem and solve it step-by-step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**

"Calculate the sum of the first 50 positive even integers."

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Identify the Sequence:**
   - The first positive even integer is 2.
   - The sequence of the first 50 positive even integers is: 2, 4, 6, ..., 100.

2. **Recognize the Pattern:**
   - This sequence is an arithmetic sequence where the first term \( a_1 = 2 \) and the common difference \( d = 2 \).

3. **Find the Last Term:**
   - The \( n \)-th term of an arithmetic sequence is given by:
     \[
     a_n = a_1 + (n-1) \cdot d
     \]
   - For the 50th term:
     \[
     a_{50} = 2 + (50-1) \cdot 2 = 2 + 98 = 100
     \]

4. **Use the Formula for the Sum of an Arithmetic Sequence:**
   - The sum \( S_n \) of the first \( n \) terms of an arithmetic sequence is given by:
     \[
     S_n = \frac{n}{2} \cdot (a_1 + a_n)
     \]
   - Here, \( n = 50 \), \( a_1 = 2 \), and \( a_{50} = 100 \).
   - Substitute these values into the formula:
     \[
     S_{50} = \frac{50}{2} \cdot (2 + 100) = 25 \cdot 102 = 2550
     \]

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The sum of the first 50 positive even integers is 2550.

**Final Answer:**

The sum of the first 50 positive even integers is 2550.
