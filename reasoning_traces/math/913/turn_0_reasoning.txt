To solve the problem, we need to determine how many yellow balloons Benny has based on the information given about the pieces of bologna he threw at the red and yellow balloons.

1. **Identify the variables**:
   - Let \( r \) be the number of red balloons.
   - Let \( y \) be the number of yellow balloons.

2. **Given information**:
   - Benny threw 2 pieces of bologna at each red balloon.
   - Benny threw 3 pieces of bologna at each yellow balloon.
   - The total number of red balloons \( r = 20 \).
   - The total number of pieces of bologna thrown is 58.

3. **Set up the equation**:
   We can express the total number of pieces of bologna thrown as:
   \[
   \text{Total bologna} = (\text{pieces per red balloon} \times \text{number of red balloons}) + (\text{pieces per yellow balloon} \times \text{number of yellow balloons})
   \]
   Substituting the known values:
   \[
   58 = (2 \times r) + (3 \times y)
   \]
   Since \( r = 20 \):
   \[
   58 = (2 \times 20) + (3 \times y)
   \]

4. **Calculate the contribution from red balloons**:
   \[
   2 \times 20 = 40
   \]
   So we can rewrite the equation:
   \[
   58 = 40 + (3 \times y)
   \]

5. **Isolate the term with \( y \)**:
   Subtract 40 from both sides:
   \[
   58 - 40 = 3y
   \]
   \[
   18 = 3y
   \]

6. **Solve for \( y \)**:
   Divide both sides by 3:
   \[
   y = \frac{18}{3} = 6
   \]

7. **Conclusion**:
   Benny has 6 yellow balloons.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{6}
\]
