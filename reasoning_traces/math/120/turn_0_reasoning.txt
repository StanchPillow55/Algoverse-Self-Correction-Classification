To solve this problem, we need to determine how much money Carrie has earned in a month and then subtract the cost of the bike to find out how much money she will have left over.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Calculate Weekly Earnings:**
   - Carrie earns $8 per hour.
   - She works 35 hours per week.
   - To find her weekly earnings, multiply her hourly wage by the number of hours she works per week:
     \[
     \text{Weekly Earnings} = 8 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 35 \, \text{hours/week} = 280 \, \text{dollars/week}
     \]

2. **Calculate Monthly Earnings:**
   - There are typically 4 weeks in a month.
   - To find her monthly earnings, multiply her weekly earnings by the number of weeks in a month:
     \[
     \text{Monthly Earnings} = 280 \, \text{dollars/week} \times 4 \, \text{weeks/month} = 1120 \, \text{dollars/month}
     \]

3. **Calculate Remaining Money After Buying the Bike:**
   - The cost of the bike is $400.
   - Subtract the cost of the bike from her total monthly earnings to find out how much money she will have left:
     \[
     \text{Remaining Money} = 1120 \, \text{dollars} - 400 \, \text{dollars} = 720 \, \text{dollars}
     \]

### Final Answer:
After buying the bike, Carrie will have $720 left over.
