==================================================

To determine how much money Carrie will have left over after buying the bike, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate Carrie's weekly earnings**:
   - Carrie earns $8 per hour and works 35 hours a week.
   - Weekly earnings = hourly wage × hours worked per week
   \[
   \text{Weekly earnings} = 8 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 35 \, \text{hours/week} = 280 \, \text{dollars/week}
   \]

2. **Calculate Carrie's total earnings for a month**:
   - There are typically 4 weeks in a month.
   - Total earnings for a month = weekly earnings × number of weeks in a month
   \[
   \text{Total earnings for a month} = 280 \, \text{dollars/week} \times 4 \, \text{weeks} = 1120 \, \text{dollars}
   \]

3. **Determine the cost of the bike**:
   - The bike costs $400.

4. **Calculate how much money Carrie will have left after buying the bike**:
   - Money left after buying the bike = total earnings for the month - cost of the bike
   \[
   \text{Money left} = 1120 \, \text{dollars} - 400 \, \text{dollars} = 720 \, \text{dollars}
   \]

5. **Final answer**:
   - Carrie will have **$720** left over after she buys the bike.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{720}
\]
