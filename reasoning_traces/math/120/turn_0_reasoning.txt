==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to determine how many sheets of paper Miguel uses in a month based on the information provided.

1. **Determine the number of pads used in a month:**
   Miguel uses 2 pads of paper per week. Since there are approximately 4 weeks in a month, we can calculate the number of pads he uses in a month as follows:

   \[
   \text{Pads per month} = \text{Pads per week} \times \text{Weeks per month} = 2 \text{ pads/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks/month} = 8 \text{ pads/month}
   \]

2. **Calculate the total number of sheets used in a month:**
   Each pad contains 30 sheets of paper. To find out how many sheets he uses in a month, we multiply the number of pads he uses in a month by the number of sheets per pad:

   \[
   \text{Sheets per month} = \text{Pads per month} \times \text{Sheets per pad} = 8 \text{ pads/month} \times 30 \text{ sheets/pad}
   \]

   Now, we perform the multiplication:

   \[
   8 \times 30 = 240
   \]

3. **Final answer:**
   Therefore, the total number of sheets of paper Miguel uses every month is:

   \[
   \boxed{240}
   \]
