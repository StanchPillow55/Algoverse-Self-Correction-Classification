==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine how much money Carrie has earned in a month and then calculate how much she will have left after purchasing the bike.

**Step 1: Calculate Carrie's weekly earnings.**

Carrie earns $8 per hour and works 35 hours a week. To find her weekly earnings, we multiply her hourly wage by the number of hours she works each week:

\[
\text{Weekly Earnings} = \text{Hourly Wage} \times \text{Hours per Week} = 8 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 35 \, \text{hours/week} = 280 \, \text{dollars/week}
\]

**Step 2: Calculate Carrie's monthly earnings.**

Since it has been a month since Carrie started working, we need to calculate her earnings for the entire month. Assuming a month consists of 4 weeks, we multiply her weekly earnings by 4:

\[
\text{Monthly Earnings} = \text{Weekly Earnings} \times 4 = 280 \, \text{dollars/week} \times 4 \, \text{weeks} = 1120 \, \text{dollars}
\]

**Step 3: Calculate the amount of money left after buying the bike.**

Carrie wants to buy a bike that costs $400. To find out how much money she will have left after purchasing the bike, we subtract the cost of the bike from her total monthly earnings:

\[
\text{Money Left Over} = \text{Monthly Earnings} - \text{Cost of Bike} = 1120 \, \text{dollars} - 400 \, \text{dollars} = 720 \, \text{dollars}
\]

**Final Answer:**

After buying the bike, Carrie will have $720 left over.
