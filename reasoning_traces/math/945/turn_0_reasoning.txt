To solve the problem, we will break it down into parts based on the information provided about James's swimming and resting.

1. **Calculate the distance James swims initially:**
   - The total distance of the lake is 20 miles.
   - James swims 60% of this distance.
   \[
   \text{Distance swum} = 0.6 \times 20 \text{ miles} = 12 \text{ miles}
   \]

2. **Calculate the time taken to swim the initial distance:**
   - James swims at a pace of 2 miles per hour.
   - To find the time taken to swim 12 miles, we use the formula:
   \[
   \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{12 \text{ miles}}{2 \text{ miles per hour}} = 6 \text{ hours}
   \]

3. **Calculate the resting time:**
   - James rests for half as long as the swimming time.
   \[
   \text{Resting time} = \frac{6 \text{ hours}}{2} = 3 \text{ hours}
   \]

4. **Calculate the remaining distance to swim:**
   - After swimming 12 miles, the remaining distance to swim is:
   \[
   \text{Remaining distance} = 20 \text{ miles} - 12 \text{ miles} = 8 \text{ miles}
   \]

5. **Calculate the speed for the remaining distance:**
   - James swims the remaining distance at half his original speed.
   \[
   \text{New speed} = \frac{2 \text{ miles per hour}}{2} = 1 \text{ mile per hour}
   \]

6. **Calculate the time taken to swim the remaining distance:**
   - To find the time taken to swim the remaining 8 miles, we use the formula:
   \[
   \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{8 \text{ miles}}{1 \text{ mile per hour}} = 8 \text{ hours}
   \]

7. **Calculate the total time taken to cross the lake:**
   - The total time is the sum of the swimming time for the first part, the resting time, and the swimming time for the second part.
   \[
   \text{Total time} = \text{Time for first part} + \text{Resting time} + \text{Time for second part}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total time} = 6 \text{ hours} + 3 \text{ hours} + 8 \text{ hours} = 17 \text{ hours}
   \]

Thus, the total time it took James to get across the lake is \(\boxed{17}\) hours.
