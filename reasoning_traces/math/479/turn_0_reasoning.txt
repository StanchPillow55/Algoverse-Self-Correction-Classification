==================================================

To find out how many hours Kat trains each week, we need to calculate the total hours she spends on strength training and boxing training separately, and then add those two amounts together.

**Step 1: Calculate hours spent on strength training.**

Kat spends 1 hour in the gym doing strength training 3 times a week. 

To find the total hours spent on strength training in a week, we can use the formula:

\[
\text{Total hours for strength training} = \text{hours per session} \times \text{number of sessions per week}
\]

Substituting in the values:

\[
\text{Total hours for strength training} = 1 \text{ hour/session} \times 3 \text{ sessions/week} = 3 \text{ hours/week}
\]

**Step 2: Calculate hours spent on boxing training.**

Kat trains at the boxing gym 4 times a week for 1.5 hours each session.

Using the same formula:

\[
\text{Total hours for boxing training} = \text{hours per session} \times \text{number of sessions per week}
\]

Substituting in the values:

\[
\text{Total hours for boxing training} = 1.5 \text{ hours/session} \times 4 \text{ sessions/week} = 6 \text{ hours/week}
\]

**Step 3: Calculate total training hours per week.**

Now, we add the total hours for strength training and boxing training:

\[
\text{Total training hours} = \text{Total hours for strength training} + \text{Total hours for boxing training}
\]

Substituting in the values:

\[
\text{Total training hours} = 3 \text{ hours/week} + 6 \text{ hours/week} = 9 \text{ hours/week}
\]

**Final Answer:**

Kat trains a total of **9 hours per week**.
