==================================================

To find the total cost of Tom's anniversary getaway, we need to calculate the costs of the plane tickets and the hotel stay separately, and then sum them up.

### Step 1: Calculate the cost of plane tickets
Tom is buying two plane tickets, and each ticket costs $5000.

\[
\text{Cost of plane tickets} = 2 \times 5000 = 10000
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the cost of the hotel
The normal price of the hotel is $1500 per day. However, since it is a busy weekend, the hotel is 20% more expensive than normal.

First, we need to calculate the increased price of the hotel:

\[
\text{Increase} = 20\% \text{ of } 1500 = 0.20 \times 1500 = 300
\]

Now, we add this increase to the normal price to find the new hotel price:

\[
\text{New hotel price per day} = 1500 + 300 = 1800
\]

Next, we calculate the total cost for 3 days:

\[
\text{Total hotel cost} = 3 \times 1800 = 5400
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the total trip cost
Now we can add the cost of the plane tickets and the total hotel cost:

\[
\text{Total trip cost} = \text{Cost of plane tickets} + \text{Total hotel cost}
\]

Substituting the values we calculated:

\[
\text{Total trip cost} = 10000 + 5400 = 15400
\]

### Final Answer
The total cost of the trip is:

\[
\boxed{15400}
\]
