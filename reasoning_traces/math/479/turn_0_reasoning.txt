==================================================

To determine the total number of hours Kat trains each week, we need to consider both her strength training sessions and her boxing gym sessions.

1. **Strength Training:**
   - Kat spends 1 hour in the gym for strength training.
   - She does this 3 times a week.
   - To find the total hours spent on strength training per week, multiply the number of hours per session by the number of sessions per week:
     \[
     1 \, \text{hour/session} \times 3 \, \text{sessions/week} = 3 \, \text{hours/week}
     \]

2. **Boxing Gym Training:**
   - Kat trains at the boxing gym for 1.5 hours per session.
   - She does this 4 times a week.
   - To find the total hours spent on boxing training per week, multiply the number of hours per session by the number of sessions per week:
     \[
     1.5 \, \text{hours/session} \times 4 \, \text{sessions/week} = 6 \, \text{hours/week}
     \]

3. **Total Training Hours:**
   - To find the total number of hours Kat trains each week, add the hours spent on strength training and the hours spent on boxing training:
     \[
     3 \, \text{hours/week (strength training)} + 6 \, \text{hours/week (boxing training)} = 9 \, \text{hours/week}
     \]

Therefore, Kat trains a total of 9 hours each week.

**Final Answer:**
Kat trains 9 hours a week.
