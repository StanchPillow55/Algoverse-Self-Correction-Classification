To find out how much Mark paid in total for the new radiator and the installation, we will break the problem down into steps.

### Step 1: Calculate the cost of the radiator after the discount

The original cost of the radiator is $400. Mark gets it for 80% off. To find the amount he pays after the discount, we first need to calculate the discount amount.

1. **Calculate the discount amount:**
   \[
   \text{Discount} = \text{Original Price} \times \text{Discount Rate}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Discount} = 400 \times 0.80 = 320
   \]

2. **Calculate the price after the discount:**
   \[
   \text{Price After Discount} = \text{Original Price} - \text{Discount}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Price After Discount} = 400 - 320 = 80
   \]

So, Mark pays **$80** for the radiator.

### Step 2: Calculate the cost of the mechanic's labor

Mark hires a mechanic who charges $50 per hour, and the installation takes 3 hours. We can calculate the total labor cost as follows:

1. **Calculate the total labor cost:**
   \[
   \text{Labor Cost} = \text{Hourly Rate} \times \text{Number of Hours}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Labor Cost} = 50 \times 3 = 150
   \]

So, the mechanic's labor costs **$150**.

### Step 3: Calculate the total cost

Now, we need to add the cost of the radiator and the cost of the mechanic's labor to find the total amount Mark paid.

1. **Calculate the total cost:**
   \[
   \text{Total Cost} = \text{Cost of Radiator} + \text{Labor Cost}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total Cost} = 80 + 150 = 230
   \]

### Final Answer

Mark paid a total of **$230** for the radiator and its installation.
