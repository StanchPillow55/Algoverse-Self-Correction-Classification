Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To determine how many cups of water Crista needs for her plants each day, we will calculate the total amount of water required for each group of plants based on their watering needs.

1. **Identify the number of plants in each category:**
   - 4 plants need half a cup of water each.
   - 8 plants need 1 cup of water each.
   - The remaining plants need a quarter of a cup of water each.

2. **Calculate the number of remaining plants:**
   - Total plants = 20
   - Plants accounted for = 4 (half cup) + 8 (1 cup) = 12 plants
   - Remaining plants = 20 - 12 = 8 plants (these need a quarter of a cup each).

3. **Calculate the total water needed for each group:**
   - For the 4 plants needing half a cup:
     \[
     4 \text{ plants} \times 0.5 \text{ cups/plant} = 2 \text{ cups}
     \]
   
   - For the 8 plants needing 1 cup:
     \[
     8 \text{ plants} \times 1 \text{ cup/plant} = 8 \text{ cups}
     \]
   
   - For the 8 plants needing a quarter of a cup:
     \[
     8 \text{ plants} \times 0.25 \text{ cups/plant} = 2 \text{ cups}
     \]

4. **Add the total water needed for all groups:**
   \[
   \text{Total water} = 2 \text{ cups} + 8 \text{ cups} + 2 \text{ cups} = 12 \text{ cups}
   \]

Thus, Crista needs a total of **12 cups of water** every day for her plants.

**Final Answer:** 12 cups of water.
