To determine how many cups of water Crista needs every day for her plants, we will break down the problem step by step.

1. **Identify the number of plants and their watering needs**:
   - Crista has a total of 20 plants.
   - Out of these, 4 plants need half a cup of water each.
   - 8 plants need 1 cup of water each.
   - The remaining plants need a quarter of a cup of water each.

2. **Calculate the number of remaining plants**:
   - Total plants = 20
   - Plants needing half a cup = 4
   - Plants needing 1 cup = 8
   - Remaining plants = Total plants - (Plants needing half a cup + Plants needing 1 cup)
   \[
   \text{Remaining plants} = 20 - (4 + 8) = 20 - 12 = 8
   \]
   So, there are 8 plants that need a quarter of a cup of water each.

3. **Calculate the total amount of water needed for each group of plants**:
   - For the 4 plants needing half a cup:
   \[
   \text{Water for 4 plants} = 4 \times \frac{1}{2} = 2 \text{ cups}
   \]
   
   - For the 8 plants needing 1 cup:
   \[
   \text{Water for 8 plants} = 8 \times 1 = 8 \text{ cups}
   \]
   
   - For the 8 plants needing a quarter of a cup:
   \[
   \text{Water for 8 plants} = 8 \times \frac{1}{4} = 2 \text{ cups}
   \]

4. **Sum the total amount of water needed**:
   - Total water needed = Water for 4 plants + Water for 8 plants + Water for 8 plants
   \[
   \text{Total water needed} = 2 + 8 + 2 = 12 \text{ cups}
   \]

5. **Final answer**:
Crista needs a total of **12 cups of water** every day for her plants.
