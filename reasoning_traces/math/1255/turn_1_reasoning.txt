==================================================

To determine how many cups of water Crista needs every day for her plants, we will calculate the total amount of water required for each group of plants and then sum these amounts.

1. **Identify the number of plants in each category**:
   - 4 plants need half a cup of water each.
   - 8 plants need 1 cup of water each.
   - The remaining plants need a quarter of a cup of water each.

2. **Calculate the number of remaining plants**:
   - Total plants = 20
   - Plants needing half a cup = 4
   - Plants needing 1 cup = 8
   - Remaining plants = Total plants - (Plants needing half a cup + Plants needing 1 cup)
   \[
   \text{Remaining plants} = 20 - (4 + 8) = 20 - 12 = 8
   \]
   So, there are 8 plants that need a quarter of a cup of water each.

3. **Calculate the total water needed for each group**:
   - For the 4 plants needing half a cup:
   \[
   \text{Water for 4 plants} = 4 \times \frac{1}{2} = 2 \text{ cups}
   \]
   - For the 8 plants needing 1 cup:
   \[
   \text{Water for 8 plants} = 8 \times 1 = 8 \text{ cups}
   \]
   - For the 8 plants needing a quarter of a cup:
   \[
   \text{Water for 8 plants} = 8 \times \frac{1}{4} = 2 \text{ cups}
   \]

4. **Sum the total water needed**:
   \[
   \text{Total water} = \text{Water for 4 plants} + \text{Water for 8 plants} + \text{Water for 8 plants}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total water} = 2 + 8 + 2 = 12 \text{ cups}
   \]

Thus, Crista needs a total of **12 cups of water** every day for her plants. 

Final answer: **12 cups**.
