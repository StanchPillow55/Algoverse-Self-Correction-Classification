==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to determine Emma's age based on the information given about Mia's age and the age difference between them.

1. **Identify Mia's Age**: 
   - Mia is currently 40 years old.

2. **Determine the Age Difference**: 
   - It is stated that Mia and Emma are 16 years apart in age.

3. **Calculate Emma's Age**: 
   - Since Mia is younger than Emma, we can find Emma's age by adding the age difference to Mia's age:
   \[
   \text{Emma's Age} = \text{Mia's Age} + \text{Age Difference}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Emma's Age} = 40 + 16 = 56
   \]

4. **Calculate the Average of Their Ages**: 
   - The average age can be calculated using the formula for the average:
   \[
   \text{Average Age} = \frac{\text{Mia's Age} + \text{Emma's Age}}{2}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Average Age} = \frac{40 + 56}{2}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Average Age} = \frac{96}{2} = 48
   \]

5. **Final Answer**: 
   - The average of Mia's and Emma's ages is \( \boxed{48} \).
