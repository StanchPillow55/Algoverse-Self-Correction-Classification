==================================================

To solve the problem, we will calculate the total amount of crawfish Joe caught over the three days and then determine how many servings that amount represents.

1. **Amount caught on Thursday**: 
   Joe caught 3 pounds of crawfish on Thursday.

   \[
   \text{Crawfish on Thursday} = 3 \text{ pounds}
   \]

2. **Amount caught on Friday**: 
   Joe caught 4 times the amount he caught on Thursday on Friday. Therefore, we calculate:

   \[
   \text{Crawfish on Friday} = 4 \times \text{Crawfish on Thursday} = 4 \times 3 = 12 \text{ pounds}
   \]

3. **Amount caught on Saturday**: 
   Joe caught half the amount of his Friday's catch on Saturday. Thus, we calculate:

   \[
   \text{Crawfish on Saturday} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Crawfish on Friday} = \frac{1}{2} \times 12 = 6 \text{ pounds}
   \]

4. **Total amount of crawfish caught**: 
   Now, we sum the amounts caught over the three days:

   \[
   \text{Total crawfish} = \text{Crawfish on Thursday} + \text{Crawfish on Friday} + \text{Crawfish on Saturday}
   \]

   Substituting the values we calculated:

   \[
   \text{Total crawfish} = 3 + 12 + 6 = 21 \text{ pounds}
   \]

5. **Calculating servings**: 
   Each serving of crawfish is 3 pounds. To find out how many servings Joe has, we divide the total amount of crawfish by the amount per serving:

   \[
   \text{Number of servings} = \frac{\text{Total crawfish}}{\text{Pounds per serving}} = \frac{21}{3} = 7
   \]

Thus, Joe has a total of **7 servings** of crawfish.

Final answer: **7 servings**.
