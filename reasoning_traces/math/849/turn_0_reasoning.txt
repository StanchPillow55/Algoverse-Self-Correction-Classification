==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to determine how many trays of eggs the farmer can fill with the 900 eggs he has, and then calculate how much he will earn by selling those trays at $2.5 each.

### Step 1: Calculate the number of trays

The farmer has 900 eggs, and each tray holds 30 eggs. To find out how many trays he can fill, we divide the total number of eggs by the number of eggs per tray:

\[
\text{Number of trays} = \frac{\text{Total eggs}}{\text{Eggs per tray}} = \frac{900}{30}
\]

Calculating this gives:

\[
\text{Number of trays} = 30
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the total earnings

Now that we know the farmer can fill 30 trays, we need to calculate how much he will earn by selling each tray for $2.5. We multiply the number of trays by the price per tray:

\[
\text{Total earnings} = \text{Number of trays} \times \text{Price per tray} = 30 \times 2.5
\]

Calculating this gives:

\[
\text{Total earnings} = 75
\]

### Final Answer

The farmer will earn **$75** by selling the trays of eggs.
