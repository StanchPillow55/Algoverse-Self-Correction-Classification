==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to determine how many toys Hash has based on the information given about Bill's toys. Then, we will calculate the total number of toys both boys have.

1. **Identify the number of toys Bill has**:
   - According to the problem, Bill has 60 toys.

2. **Determine how many toys Hash has**:
   - The problem states that Hash has "nine more than half as many toys as Bill has."
   - First, we need to calculate half of the number of toys Bill has:
     \[
     \text{Half of Bill's toys} = \frac{60}{2} = 30
     \]
   - Next, we add 9 to this amount to find out how many toys Hash has:
     \[
     \text{Hash's toys} = 30 + 9 = 39
     \]

3. **Calculate the total number of toys both boys have**:
   - Now we add the number of toys that Bill has to the number of toys that Hash has:
     \[
     \text{Total toys} = \text{Bill's toys} + \text{Hash's toys} = 60 + 39 = 99
     \]

4. **Final answer**:
   - The total number of toys that both boys have is \( \boxed{99} \).
