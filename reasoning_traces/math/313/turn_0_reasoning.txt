To solve this problem, we need to determine how many toys Hash has and then find the total number of toys both Hash and Bill have together.

1. **Determine how many toys Bill has:**
   - According to the problem, Bill has 60 toys.

2. **Calculate how many toys Hash has:**
   - The problem states that Hash has nine more than half as many toys as Bill.
   - First, calculate half of the number of toys Bill has:
     \[
     \text{Half of Bill's toys} = \frac{60}{2} = 30
     \]
   - Next, add nine to this number to find out how many toys Hash has:
     \[
     \text{Hash's toys} = 30 + 9 = 39
     \]

3. **Calculate the total number of toys:**
   - Add the number of toys Bill has to the number of toys Hash has:
     \[
     \text{Total toys} = \text{Bill's toys} + \text{Hash's toys} = 60 + 39 = 99
     \]

Therefore, the total number of toys that Hash and Bill have together is \(\boxed{99}\).
