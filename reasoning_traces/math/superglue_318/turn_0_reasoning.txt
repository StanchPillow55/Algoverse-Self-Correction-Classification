==================================================

To solve the problem, I need more information about "Sample reasoning question 318." Since the question is not provided, I'll demonstrate how to approach a typical math problem by solving an example problem. Let's consider the following problem:

**Example Problem:**

A train travels from City A to City B, a distance of 300 miles, at a constant speed. On the return trip, the train travels at a speed that is 20 miles per hour faster and takes 1 hour less. What is the speed of the train from City A to City B?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( x \) be the speed of the train from City A to City B in miles per hour.

2. **Write Equations for Each Trip:**
   - The time taken to travel from City A to City B is given by the formula: 
     \[
     \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{300}{x}
     \]
   - On the return trip, the speed is \( x + 20 \) miles per hour, and the time taken is:
     \[
     \frac{300}{x + 20}
     \]

3. **Set Up the Equation Based on Given Information:**
   - We know that the return trip takes 1 hour less than the trip from City A to City B. Therefore, we can write:
     \[
     \frac{300}{x} - \frac{300}{x + 20} = 1
     \]

4. **Solve the Equation:**
   - To eliminate the fractions, find a common denominator, which is \( x(x + 20) \):
     \[
     \frac{300(x + 20) - 300x}{x(x + 20)} = 1
     \]
   - Simplify the numerator:
     \[
     300x + 6000 - 300x = 6000
     \]
   - The equation becomes:
     \[
     \frac{6000}{x(x + 20)} = 1
     \]
   - Cross-multiply to solve for \( x \):
     \[
     6000 = x(x + 20)
     \]
   - Expand and rearrange the equation:
     \[
     x^2 + 20x - 6000 = 0
     \]

5. **Solve the Quadratic Equation:**
   - Use the quadratic formula \( x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \), where \( a = 1 \), \( b = 20 \), and \( c = -6000 \):
     \[
     x = \frac{-20 \pm \sqrt{20^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot (-6000)}}{2 \cdot 1}
     \]
     \[
     x = \frac{-20 \pm \sqrt{400 + 24000}}{2}
     \]
     \[
     x = \frac{-20 \pm \sqrt{24400}}{2}
     \]
     \[
     x = \frac{-20 \pm 156.2}{2}
     \]
   - Calculate the two possible values for \( x \):
     \[
     x = \frac{-20 + 156.2}{2} = \frac{136.2}{2} = 68.1
     \]
     \[
     x = \frac{-20 - 156.2}{2} = \frac{-176.2}{2} = -88.1
     \]

6. **Select the Valid Solution:**
   - Since speed cannot be negative, the valid solution is \( x = 68.1 \).

**Final Answer:**

The speed of the train from City A to City B is 68.1 miles per hour.
