To solve the problem, I need more specific information about "Sample reasoning question 318." Since the question is not provided, I'll guide you through a general approach to solving math problems step by step. If you have a specific problem in mind, please provide the details, and I'll be happy to help.

### General Approach to Solving Math Problems

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - Read the problem carefully.
   - Identify what is being asked.
   - Determine what information is given and what needs to be found.

2. **Devise a Plan:**
   - Consider possible strategies to solve the problem, such as drawing a diagram, creating an equation, or breaking the problem into smaller parts.
   - Choose the strategy that seems most appropriate for the problem.

3. **Carry Out the Plan:**
   - Execute the chosen strategy step by step.
   - Perform calculations carefully and check each step for accuracy.
   - Keep track of units and ensure consistency throughout the problem.

4. **Review/Check the Solution:**
   - Verify that the solution makes sense in the context of the problem.
   - Check calculations for errors.
   - Ensure that the final answer addresses the question asked.

5. **State the Final Answer:**
   - Clearly write the final answer, including units if applicable.
   - Ensure the answer is presented in a complete sentence if the problem requires it.

### Example Problem

Let's apply this approach to a simple example problem:

**Example Problem:**
A car travels at a constant speed of 60 miles per hour. How far does the car travel in 3 hours?

**Step 1: Understand the Problem**
- We are asked to find the distance traveled by the car.
- Given: Speed = 60 miles per hour, Time = 3 hours.

**Step 2: Devise a Plan**
- Use the formula for distance: Distance = Speed × Time.

**Step 3: Carry Out the Plan**
- Substitute the given values into the formula:
  \[
  \text{Distance} = 60 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 180 \, \text{miles}
  \]

**Step 4: Review/Check the Solution**
- Check the units: miles/hour × hours = miles, which is correct.
- The calculation is straightforward and correct.

**Step 5: State the Final Answer**
- The car travels 180 miles in 3 hours.
