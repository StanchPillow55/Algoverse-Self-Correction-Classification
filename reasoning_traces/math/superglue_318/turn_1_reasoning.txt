==================================================

To solve this problem, I need more specific details about "Sample reasoning question 318." Since the problem statement is not provided, I'll demonstrate how to approach a typical math problem by creating an example and solving it step by step.

**Example Problem:**

A car travels from City A to City B, a distance of 150 miles, at an average speed of 50 miles per hour. On the return trip, the car travels at an average speed of 60 miles per hour. What is the total time spent traveling?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We need to find the total time spent traveling from City A to City B and back to City A.
   - The distance between the cities is 150 miles one way.
   - The speed going to City B is 50 miles per hour.
   - The speed returning to City A is 60 miles per hour.

2. **Calculate the Time for Each Leg of the Trip:**

   - **Time to City B:**
     \[
     \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{150 \text{ miles}}{50 \text{ miles per hour}} = 3 \text{ hours}
     \]

   - **Time to Return to City A:**
     \[
     \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{150 \text{ miles}}{60 \text{ miles per hour}} = 2.5 \text{ hours}
     \]

3. **Calculate the Total Time:**
   - Add the time for both legs of the trip:
     \[
     \text{Total Time} = 3 \text{ hours} + 2.5 \text{ hours} = 5.5 \text{ hours}
     \]

4. **Verify the Solution:**
   - Check calculations for any errors.
   - Ensure all units are consistent and calculations make sense.

5. **State the Final Answer:**
   - The total time spent traveling is 5.5 hours.

This example demonstrates a structured approach to solving a math problem by breaking it down into smaller, manageable steps, performing calculations, and verifying the results. If you have a specific problem or need further assistance, please provide more details or clarify the question.
