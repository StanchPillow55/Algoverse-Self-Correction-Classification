==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 318" entails. However, since the problem statement is not provided, I will demonstrate a general approach to solving a typical math problem by using a hypothetical example.

Let's assume the problem is as follows:

**Problem:**  
A rectangle has a length that is 3 times its width. If the perimeter of the rectangle is 48 units, find the dimensions of the rectangle.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We have a rectangle with a length (L) and a width (W).
   - The length is 3 times the width: \( L = 3W \).
   - The perimeter of the rectangle is 48 units.

2. **Recall the Formula for Perimeter:**
   - The perimeter (P) of a rectangle is given by the formula:  
     \[ P = 2L + 2W \]

3. **Substitute the Known Values:**
   - Substitute \( L = 3W \) into the perimeter formula:  
     \[ 48 = 2(3W) + 2W \]

4. **Simplify the Equation:**
   - Simplify the expression:  
     \[ 48 = 6W + 2W \]
     \[ 48 = 8W \]

5. **Solve for W (Width):**
   - Divide both sides by 8 to solve for W:  
     \[ W = \frac{48}{8} \]
     \[ W = 6 \]

6. **Find the Length (L):**
   - Use the relationship \( L = 3W \) to find L:  
     \[ L = 3 \times 6 \]
     \[ L = 18 \]

7. **Verify the Solution:**
   - Check if the dimensions satisfy the perimeter condition:  
     \[ P = 2L + 2W = 2(18) + 2(6) = 36 + 12 = 48 \]
   - The calculated perimeter matches the given perimeter, confirming our solution is correct.

**Final Answer:**
The dimensions of the rectangle are:
- Width (W) = 6 units
- Length (L) = 18 units

This step-by-step approach demonstrates how to solve a typical math problem involving relationships and equations. If you have a specific problem (e.g., "Sample reasoning question 318"), please provide the details for a tailored solution.
