Question ID: 324
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to determine how many old records the 5 people brought in, given that they traded 2 old records for 1 new record and left with a total of 7 new records.

1. **Understanding the Trade**: The trade ratio is 2 old records for 1 new record. This means that for every new record received, 2 old records must be given.

2. **Calculating Old Records for New Records**: Since the 5 people left with 7 new records, we can calculate how many old records they must have traded in to receive these new records.

   - For each new record, they need to trade in 2 old records.
   - Therefore, for 7 new records, the total number of old records traded in is:
     \[
     \text{Total old records} = 7 \text{ new records} \times 2 \text{ old records/new record} = 14 \text{ old records}
     \]

3. **Conclusion**: The total number of old records that the 5 people brought in is 14.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{14}
\]
