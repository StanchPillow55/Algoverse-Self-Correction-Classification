To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of money Legacy earns from cleaning all the rooms in the building. We'll break down the problem step by step:

1. **Determine the total number of rooms in the building:**

   The building has four floors, and each floor has ten rooms. Therefore, the total number of rooms is calculated as follows:

   \[
   \text{Total number of rooms} = \text{Number of floors} \times \text{Number of rooms per floor} = 4 \times 10 = 40
   \]

2. **Calculate the total time required to clean all the rooms:**

   Legacy takes 6 hours to clean one room. Therefore, the total time required to clean all 40 rooms is:

   \[
   \text{Total cleaning time} = \text{Time per room} \times \text{Total number of rooms} = 6 \times 40 = 240 \text{ hours}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total earnings:**

   Legacy earns $15 per hour. Therefore, her total earnings for cleaning all the rooms is:

   \[
   \text{Total earnings} = \text{Hourly rate} \times \text{Total cleaning time} = 15 \times 240 = 3600
   \]

Thus, the total amount of money Legacy makes from cleaning all the floors in the building is \(\boxed{3600}\) dollars.
