To solve the problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of rooms in the building.**
   - The building has 4 floors, and each floor has 10 rooms.
   - Total number of rooms = Number of floors × Number of rooms per floor
   \[
   \text{Total rooms} = 4 \text{ floors} \times 10 \text{ rooms/floor} = 40 \text{ rooms}
   \]

2. **Calculate the total time it takes to clean all the rooms.**
   - It takes Legacy 6 hours to clean one room.
   - Total time to clean all rooms = Time per room × Total number of rooms
   \[
   \text{Total time} = 6 \text{ hours/room} \times 40 \text{ rooms} = 240 \text{ hours}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total earnings from cleaning all the rooms.**
   - Legacy earns $15 per hour.
   - Total earnings = Earnings per hour × Total time
   \[
   \text{Total earnings} = 15 \text{ dollars/hour} \times 240 \text{ hours} = 3600 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Now, we can summarize the calculations:

- Total number of rooms: 40
- Total time to clean all rooms: 240 hours
- Total earnings: $3600

Thus, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{3600}
\] 

Legacy makes a total of $3600 from cleaning all the floors in the building.
