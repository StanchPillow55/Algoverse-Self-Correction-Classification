To solve the problem, we need to understand the trading system at Ralph's record store. According to the problem, people can trade 2 old records for 1 new record. 

Let's denote the number of old records brought in by the 5 people as \( x \).

Since the trading rule states that 2 old records can be exchanged for 1 new record, we can express the number of new records obtained from the old records as follows:

\[
\text{Number of new records} = \frac{x}{2}
\]

According to the problem, the 5 people leave with a total of 7 new records. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

\[
\frac{x}{2} = 7
\]

To solve for \( x \), we first multiply both sides of the equation by 2 to eliminate the fraction:

\[
x = 7 \times 2
\]

Calculating the right side gives:

\[
x = 14
\]

Thus, the total number of old records that the 5 people brought in is 14.

To verify, we can check how many new records they would receive if they brought in 14 old records:

\[
\text{Number of new records} = \frac{14}{2} = 7
\]

This matches the information given in the problem, confirming our solution is correct.

Therefore, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{14}
\]
