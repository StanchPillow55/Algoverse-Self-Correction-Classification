==================================================

To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step.

1. **Determine Anna's remaining budget after her initial spending**:
   - Anna's initial budget is $16.
   - She has already spent $4.
   - Therefore, her remaining budget after spending $4 is:
     \[
     16 - 4 = 12 \text{ dollars}
     \]

2. **Account for the remaining budget after buying the books**:
   - After buying the books, Anna has $2 left.
   - This means that the amount she spent on the books is:
     \[
     12 - 2 = 10 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Determine the cost of each book**:
   - Anna bought 2 books, and both books cost the same amount.
   - Let the cost of each book be \( x \).
   - Since she bought 2 books, the total cost for the books can be expressed as:
     \[
     2x = 10
     \]

4. **Solve for \( x \)**:
   - To find the cost of each book, we divide both sides of the equation by 2:
     \[
     x = \frac{10}{2} = 5
     \]

Thus, the cost of each book is \( 5 \) dollars.

5. **Final answer**:
   - Each book cost \( \boxed{5} \) dollars.
