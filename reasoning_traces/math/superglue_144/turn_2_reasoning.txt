==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 144" refers to. Since the problem statement is not specific, I will assume it involves a mathematical reasoning problem that requires a step-by-step approach to solve.

Let's assume "Sample reasoning question 144" involves a common type of reasoning question, such as a logic puzzle or a mathematical problem involving numbers. Without specific details, I'll create a hypothetical problem and solve it.

**Hypothetical Problem:**
Let's assume the problem is as follows:

"Find the smallest positive integer \( x \) such that when \( x \) is divided by 5, the remainder is 3, and when \( x \) is divided by 7, the remainder is 4."

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We need to find an integer \( x \) that satisfies two conditions:
     - \( x \equiv 3 \pmod{5} \)
     - \( x \equiv 4 \pmod{7} \)

2. **Use the Chinese Remainder Theorem:**
   - The Chinese Remainder Theorem can be used to solve systems of congruences when the moduli are coprime. Here, 5 and 7 are coprime.

3. **Set Up the Congruences:**
   - We have:
     - \( x = 5k + 3 \) for some integer \( k \)
     - \( x = 7m + 4 \) for some integer \( m \)

4. **Equate and Solve:**
   - Set the two expressions for \( x \) equal to each other:
     \[
     5k + 3 = 7m + 4
     \]
   - Rearrange to find:
     \[
     5k = 7m + 1
     \]
   - Solve for \( k \) and \( m \) by testing small values:
     - Start with \( m = 0 \):
       \[
       5k = 1 \quad \text{(not possible since 5k is always a multiple of 5)}
       \]
     - Try \( m = 1 \):
       \[
       5k = 7 \times 1 + 1 = 8 \quad \text{(not possible)}
       \]
     - Try \( m = 2 \):
       \[
       5k = 7 \times 2 + 1 = 15 \quad \Rightarrow \quad k = 3
       \]
     - Check if \( k = 3 \) works:
       \[
       x = 5 \times 3 + 3 = 18
       \]
     - Verify:
       - \( 18 \div 5 = 3 \) remainder \( 3 \) (satisfies \( x \equiv 3 \pmod{5} \))
       - \( 18 \div 7 = 2 \) remainder \( 4 \) (satisfies \( x \equiv 4 \pmod{7} \))

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The smallest positive integer \( x \) that satisfies both conditions is \( \boxed{18} \).

This completes the reasoning and solution for the hypothetical problem based on the given instruction.
