Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 144" refers to. Since the problem statement doesn't provide specific details about the question, I'll demonstrate a general approach to solving a math problem by considering a hypothetical example. Let's assume "Sample reasoning question 144" is a typical math problem involving algebra. Here's how we might approach it:

### Hypothetical Problem:
Solve for \( x \) in the equation:
\[ 2x + 3 = 11 \]

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Understand the Equation:**
   The equation given is \( 2x + 3 = 11 \). This is a linear equation in one variable, \( x \).

2. **Isolate the Variable:**
   To solve for \( x \), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We can do this by performing operations that will simplify the equation.

3. **Subtract 3 from Both Sides:**
   To eliminate the constant term on the left side, subtract 3 from both sides of the equation:
   \[
   2x + 3 - 3 = 11 - 3
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   2x = 8
   \]

4. **Divide by 2:**
   Now, divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( x \):
   \[
   \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{8}{2}
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   x = 4
   \]

5. **Verify the Solution:**
   Substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies the equation:
   \[
   2(4) + 3 = 11
   \]
   Simplifying the left side gives:
   \[
   8 + 3 = 11
   \]
   Since both sides of the equation are equal, \( x = 4 \) is indeed the correct solution.

### Final Answer:
The solution to the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \) is \( x = 4 \).

This approach demonstrates a systematic method to solve a linear equation. If "Sample reasoning question 144" refers to a different type of problem, please provide additional details or context so I can assist you more accurately.
