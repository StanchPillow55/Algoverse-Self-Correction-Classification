==================================================

To solve the problem, we first need to understand what "Sample reasoning question 144" refers to. Since the problem statement is not clear, I'll assume it involves a mathematical problem related to the number 144. One common mathematical problem involving 144 is finding its square root, factors, or solving an equation where 144 is a part of it. Let's explore these possibilities:

### 1. Finding the Square Root of 144

The square root of a number \( n \) is a value \( x \) such that \( x^2 = n \). For 144, we want to find \( x \) such that:

\[ x^2 = 144 \]

To find \( x \), we can take the square root of both sides:

\[ x = \sqrt{144} \]

We know that:

\[ \sqrt{144} = 12 \]

because \( 12 \times 12 = 144 \).

### 2. Finding the Factors of 144

To find the factors of 144, we need to find all integers \( x \) such that \( 144 \mod x = 0 \). We can start by performing a prime factorization of 144:

1. 144 is even, so divide by 2:
   \[ 144 \div 2 = 72 \]
2. 72 is even, so divide by 2:
   \[ 72 \div 2 = 36 \]
3. 36 is even, so divide by 2:
   \[ 36 \div 2 = 18 \]
4. 18 is even, so divide by 2:
   \[ 18 \div 2 = 9 \]
5. 9 is divisible by 3:
   \[ 9 \div 3 = 3 \]
6. 3 is divisible by 3:
   \[ 3 \div 3 = 1 \]

The prime factorization of 144 is \( 2^4 \times 3^2 \).

Using the prime factorization, we can find all factors by considering all combinations of these prime factors:

- \( 2^0 \times 3^0 = 1 \)
- \( 2^1 \times 3^0 = 2 \)
- \( 2^2 \times 3^0 = 4 \)
- \( 2^3 \times 3^0 = 8 \)
- \( 2^4 \times 3^0 = 16 \)
- \( 2^0 \times 3^1 = 3 \)
- \( 2^1 \times 3^1 = 6 \)
- \( 2^2 \times 3^1 = 12 \)
- \( 2^3 \times 3^1 = 24 \)
- \( 2^4 \times 3^1 = 48 \)
- \( 2^0 \times 3^2 = 9 \)
- \( 2^1 \times 3^2 = 18 \)
- \( 2^2 \times 3^2 = 36 \)
- \( 2^3 \times 3^2 = 72 \)
- \( 2^4 \times 3^2 = 144 \)

Thus, the factors of 144 are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 12, 16, 18, 24, 36, 48, 72, and 144.

### 3. Solving an Equation Involving 144

If the problem involves solving an equation like \( x^2 = 144 \), we have already solved it above by finding the square root.

### Conclusion

Since the problem statement was not specific, I explored common mathematical problems involving 144. The square root of 144 is 12, and the factors of 144 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 12, 16, 18, 24, 36, 48, 72, and 144. If you have a specific problem involving 144, please provide more details for a precise solution.

**Final Answer:**
- Square root of 144: 12
- Factors of 144: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 12, 16, 18, 24, 36, 48, 72, 144
