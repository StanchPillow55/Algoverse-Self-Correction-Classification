==================================================

To solve the problem, we first need to understand what "Sample reasoning question 144" refers to. Since the problem statement doesn't provide specific details about the question, I'll assume it's a placeholder for a math problem. Let's create a hypothetical math problem and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**
Calculate the sum of the first 12 positive even numbers.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Identify the Sequence:**
   - The sequence of the first 12 positive even numbers is: 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, 24.

2. **Recognize the Pattern:**
   - This sequence is an arithmetic sequence where the first term \( a_1 = 2 \) and the common difference \( d = 2 \).

3. **Use the Formula for the Sum of an Arithmetic Sequence:**
   - The formula for the sum \( S_n \) of the first \( n \) terms of an arithmetic sequence is:
     \[
     S_n = \frac{n}{2} \times (a_1 + a_n)
     \]
   - Here, \( n = 12 \), \( a_1 = 2 \), and \( a_{12} = 24 \).

4. **Calculate the Sum:**
   - Substitute the values into the formula:
     \[
     S_{12} = \frac{12}{2} \times (2 + 24)
     \]
   - Simplify the expression:
     \[
     S_{12} = 6 \times 26
     \]
   - Calculate the product:
     \[
     S_{12} = 156
     \]

5. **Verify the Calculation:**
   - To ensure accuracy, let's add the numbers directly:
     \[
     2 + 4 + 6 + 8 + 10 + 12 + 14 + 16 + 18 + 20 + 22 + 24
     \]
   - Group the numbers for easier addition:
     \[
     (2 + 24) + (4 + 22) + (6 + 20) + (8 + 18) + (10 + 16) + (12 + 14)
     \]
   - Each pair sums to 26, and there are 6 pairs:
     \[
     6 \times 26 = 156
     \]

**Final Answer:**
The sum of the first 12 positive even numbers is 156.
