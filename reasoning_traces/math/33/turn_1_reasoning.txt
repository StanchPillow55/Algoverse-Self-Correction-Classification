Question ID: 33
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to determine the number of teaspoons of salt Kimber needs. According to the problem, she needs 1/2 times as many teaspoons of salt as the number of cups of flour. She uses 16 cups of flour, so we calculate:

16 cups of flour * 1/2 = 8 teaspoons of salt

Next, we add up the total number of cups of water, flour, and teaspoons of salt. We treat the teaspoons of salt as equivalent to cups for the purpose of this problem, even though they are different units of measurement. 

10 cups of water + 16 cups of flour + 8 teaspoons of salt = 34 units

So, Kimber needs a combined total of 34 units (cups and teaspoons) of water, flour, and salt to make the pizza.
