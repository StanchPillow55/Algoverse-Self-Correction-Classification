==================================================

To find the total number of cups of water, flour, and teaspoons of salt that Kimber needs to make pizza, we will follow these steps:

1. **Identify the quantities needed**:
   - Water: 10 cups
   - Flour: 16 cups
   - Salt: 1/2 times as many teaspoons as the number of cups of flour.

2. **Calculate the amount of salt**:
   - Since Kimber needs 1/2 times as many teaspoons of salt as the number of cups of flour, we calculate:
     \[
     \text{Teaspoons of salt} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{cups of flour} = \frac{1}{2} \times 16 = 8 \text{ teaspoons}
     \]

3. **Convert teaspoons of salt to cups**:
   - There are 48 teaspoons in a cup (since 1 cup = 16 tablespoons and 1 tablespoon = 3 teaspoons, thus 16 Ã— 3 = 48).
   - To convert teaspoons to cups, we divide the number of teaspoons by 48:
     \[
     \text{Cups of salt} = \frac{8 \text{ teaspoons}}{48} = \frac{1}{6} \text{ cups}
     \]

4. **Calculate the total amount**:
   - Now we add the cups of water, flour, and salt together:
     \[
     \text{Total} = \text{Cups of water} + \text{Cups of flour} + \text{Cups of salt}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total} = 10 + 16 + \frac{1}{6}
     \]

5. **Combine the whole numbers and the fraction**:
   - First, add the whole numbers:
     \[
     10 + 16 = 26
     \]
   - Now, add the fraction:
     \[
     \text{Total} = 26 + \frac{1}{6} = \frac{156}{6} + \frac{1}{6} = \frac{157}{6}
     \]

6. **Convert the improper fraction to a mixed number**:
   - Dividing 157 by 6 gives:
     \[
     157 \div 6 = 26 \text{ remainder } 1
     \]
   - Thus, we can express this as:
     \[
     26 \frac{1}{6} \text{ cups}
     \]

Finally, the combined total number of cups of water, flour, and teaspoons of salt that Kimber needs to make the pizza is:

\[
\boxed{26 \frac{1}{6}}
\]
