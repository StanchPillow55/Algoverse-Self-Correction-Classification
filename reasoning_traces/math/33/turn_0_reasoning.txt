==================================================

First, we need to calculate the number of teaspoons of salt Kimber needs. According to the problem, she needs 1/2 times as many teaspoons of salt as the number of cups of flour. Since she uses 16 cups of flour, the number of teaspoons of salt she needs is 1/2 * 16 = 8 teaspoons of salt.

Now, we need to calculate the total number of cups of water, flour, and teaspoons of salt. To do this, we simply add the number of cups of each ingredient together:

10 cups of water + 16 cups of flour + 8 teaspoons of salt = 34 cups in total.

However, it's important to note that teaspoons and cups are different units of measurement. If we want to convert the teaspoons to cups (since there are 48 teaspoons in a cup), we would have:

8 teaspoons of salt / 48 = 0.167 cups of salt.

So, if we want to express everything in cups, we would have:

10 cups of water + 16 cups of flour + 0.167 cups of salt = 26.167 cups in total.

So, Kimber needs 34 units in total (with different units of measurement) or 26.167 cups in total (if we convert everything to cups).
