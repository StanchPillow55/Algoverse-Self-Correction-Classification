To solve the problem, we need to calculate the total amount of cups of water, flour, and teaspoons of salt that Kimber needs for making pizza.

1. **Identify the quantities given:**
   - Cups of water: 10 cups
   - Cups of flour: 16 cups
   - Teaspoons of salt: \( \frac{1}{2} \) times the number of cups of flour

2. **Calculate the amount of salt:**
   - Since the number of teaspoons of salt is \( \frac{1}{2} \) times the number of cups of flour, we can calculate it as follows:
   \[
   \text{Teaspoons of salt} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Cups of flour} = \frac{1}{2} \times 16 = 8 \text{ teaspoons}
   \]

3. **Convert teaspoons of salt to cups:**
   - We need to convert teaspoons of salt to cups to combine it with the other ingredients. There are 48 teaspoons in 1 cup. Therefore, to convert teaspoons to cups, we use the following formula:
   \[
   \text{Cups of salt} = \frac{\text{Teaspoons of salt}}{48} = \frac{8}{48} = \frac{1}{6} \text{ cups}
   \]

4. **Calculate the total amount of ingredients in cups:**
   - Now, we can add the cups of water, cups of flour, and cups of salt together:
   \[
   \text{Total cups} = \text{Cups of water} + \text{Cups of flour} + \text{Cups of salt}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total cups} = 10 + 16 + \frac{1}{6}
   \]

5. **Combine the whole numbers and the fraction:**
   - First, add the whole numbers:
   \[
   10 + 16 = 26
   \]
   - Now, add \( \frac{1}{6} \) to 26:
   \[
   \text{Total cups} = 26 + \frac{1}{6} = \frac{156}{6} + \frac{1}{6} = \frac{157}{6}
   \]

6. **Convert the improper fraction to a mixed number (if needed):**
   - To convert \( \frac{157}{6} \) to a mixed number:
   - Divide 157 by 6:
   \[
   157 \div 6 = 26 \quad \text{(whole number)}
   \]
   - The remainder is:
   \[
   157 - (6 \times 26) = 157 - 156 = 1
   \]
   - Therefore, \( \frac{157}{6} \) can be expressed as:
   \[
   26 \frac{1}{6}
   \]

7. **Final answer:**
   - The combined total number of cups of water, flour, and teaspoons of salt that Kimber needs to make the pizza is:
   \[
   \frac{157}{6} \text{ cups} \quad \text{or} \quad 26 \frac{1}{6} \text{ cups}
   \]

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{26 \frac{1}{6}} \text{ cups}
\]
