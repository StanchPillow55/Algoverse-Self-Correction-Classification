Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To find the combined total number of cups of water, flour, and teaspoons of salt that Kimber needs to make the pizza, we will follow these steps:

1. **Identify the quantities of each ingredient**:
   - Water: 10 cups
   - Flour: 16 cups
   - Salt: 1/2 times the number of cups of flour

2. **Calculate the amount of salt**:
   - Since the amount of salt is 1/2 times the number of cups of flour, we calculate:
     \[
     \text{Salt} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Flour} = \frac{1}{2} \times 16 \text{ cups} = 8 \text{ teaspoons}
     \]

3. **Convert teaspoons of salt to cups**:
   - There are 48 teaspoons in a cup (since 1 cup = 16 tablespoons and 1 tablespoon = 3 teaspoons, thus 1 cup = 16 Ã— 3 = 48 teaspoons).
   - To convert teaspoons of salt to cups, we calculate:
     \[
     \text{Salt in cups} = \frac{8 \text{ teaspoons}}{48 \text{ teaspoons per cup}} = \frac{1}{6} \text{ cups}
     \]

4. **Calculate the total amount of ingredients in cups**:
   - Now we add the cups of water, flour, and the converted cups of salt:
     \[
     \text{Total} = \text{Water} + \text{Flour} + \text{Salt in cups}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total} = 10 \text{ cups} + 16 \text{ cups} + \frac{1}{6} \text{ cups}
     \]

5. **Combine the quantities**:
   - First, add the whole numbers:
     \[
     10 + 16 = 26 \text{ cups}
     \]
   - Now, add the salt:
     \[
     26 + \frac{1}{6} = 26 \frac{1}{6} \text{ cups}
     \]

6. **Final answer**:
   - The combined total number of cups of water, flour, and teaspoons of salt that Kimber needs to make the pizza is:
     \[
     \boxed{26 \frac{1}{6}} \text{ cups}
     \]
