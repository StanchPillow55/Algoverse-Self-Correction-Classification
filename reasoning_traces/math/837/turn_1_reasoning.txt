Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to determine how much money Erika has in her purse based on the information provided.

1. **Determine the cost of the new laptop after the trade-in:**
   - The original cost of the laptop is $600.
   - The trade-in value of her old laptop is $200.
   - Therefore, the reduced price of the new laptop is:
     \[
     600 - 200 = 400 \text{ dollars}
     \]

2. **Calculate how much money Erika has in total:**
   - Erika has received $150 from her part-time job.
   - Her mom is giving her $80.
   - Therefore, the total amount of money Erika has from her job and her mom is:
     \[
     150 + 80 = 230 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Determine how much more money Erika needs:**
   - We know that Erika needs an extra $50 to buy the laptop.
   - This means that the total amount of money she needs to have in order to buy the laptop is:
     \[
     400 \text{ (cost of the laptop)} - 50 \text{ (extra needed)} = 350 \text{ dollars}
     \]

4. **Calculate how much money Erika currently has in her purse:**
   - We already calculated that Erika has $230 from her job and her mom.
   - Let \( x \) be the amount of money Erika has in her purse.
   - Therefore, the total amount of money Erika has is:
     \[
     x + 230 = 350
     \]

5. **Solve for \( x \):**
   - Rearranging the equation gives us:
     \[
     x = 350 - 230
     \]
   - Performing the subtraction:
     \[
     x = 120
     \]

Thus, the amount of money Erika has in her purse is **$120**.

**Final Answer: $120**
