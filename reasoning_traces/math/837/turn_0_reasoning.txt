==================================================

To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the cost of the new laptop after the trade-in:**
   - The original cost of the laptop is $600.
   - The trade-in value of the old laptop is $200.
   - Therefore, the new price of the laptop after the trade-in is:
     \[
     600 - 200 = 400 \text{ dollars}
     \]

2. **Calculate how much money Erika has after receiving her payments:**
   - Erika has been paid $150 from her part-time job.
   - Her mom is giving her $80.
   - The total amount Erika has from these two sources is:
     \[
     150 + 80 = 230 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Determine how much more money Erika needs to buy the laptop:**
   - We know that after the trade-in, the laptop costs $400.
   - Erika currently has $230.
   - The amount she still needs to buy the laptop is:
     \[
     400 - 230 = 170 \text{ dollars}
     \]

4. **Identify the discrepancy in the problem statement:**
   - The problem states that Erika only needs an extra $50 to buy the laptop. However, based on our calculations, she actually needs $170 more.
   - This suggests that there might be an error in the problem statement regarding how much she needs.

5. **Calculate how much money Erika has in her purse:**
   - Since we know she needs $50 more, we can set up the equation:
     \[
     \text{Total money Erika has} = \text{Amount needed} + \text{Amount she has from job and mom}
     \]
   - Let \( x \) be the amount of money Erika has in her purse. According to the problem:
     \[
     x + 230 = 400
     \]
   - Rearranging gives:
     \[
     x = 400 - 230 = 170 \text{ dollars}
     \]

Thus, Erika has **$170** in her purse. 

**Final Answer:**
Erika has $170 in her purse.
