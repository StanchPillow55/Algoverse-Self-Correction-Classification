==================================================

To solve "Sample math problem 296," we first need to understand the problem. However, since "Sample math problem 296" is not a specific problem statement, I'll create a sample math problem to demonstrate the process of solving it step by step.

**Sample Math Problem:**

A rectangle has a length that is 3 times its width. If the perimeter of the rectangle is 48 units, find the dimensions of the rectangle.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We have a rectangle with a length (L) and a width (W).
   - The length is 3 times the width: \( L = 3W \).
   - The perimeter of the rectangle is 48 units.

2. **Recall the Formula for Perimeter:**
   - The perimeter (P) of a rectangle is given by the formula:
     \[
     P = 2L + 2W
     \]

3. **Substitute the Known Values:**
   - We know the perimeter is 48 units, so:
     \[
     2L + 2W = 48
     \]

4. **Substitute the Expression for L:**
   - Since \( L = 3W \), substitute \( L \) in the perimeter equation:
     \[
     2(3W) + 2W = 48
     \]

5. **Simplify the Equation:**
   - Simplify the equation:
     \[
     6W + 2W = 48
     \]
   - Combine like terms:
     \[
     8W = 48
     \]

6. **Solve for W:**
   - Divide both sides by 8 to solve for W:
     \[
     W = \frac{48}{8} = 6
     \]

7. **Find the Length L:**
   - Use the relationship \( L = 3W \) to find L:
     \[
     L = 3 \times 6 = 18
     \]

8. **Verify the Solution:**
   - Check that the dimensions satisfy the perimeter condition:
     \[
     2L + 2W = 2(18) + 2(6) = 36 + 12 = 48
     \]
   - The perimeter is indeed 48, confirming our solution is correct.

**Final Answer:**
The dimensions of the rectangle are a width of 6 units and a length of 18 units.
