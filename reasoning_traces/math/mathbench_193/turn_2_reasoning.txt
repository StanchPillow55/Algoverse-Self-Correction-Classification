Question ID: mathbench_193
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample math problem 193" refers to. Since the problem itself is not provided, I'll assume a generic math problem and solve it step by step. Let's consider a typical algebra problem:

**Problem:** Solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).

**Step 1: Understand the Equation**

The equation given is \( 2x + 3 = 11 \). This is a linear equation in one variable, \( x \).

**Step 2: Isolate the Variable**

To solve for \( x \), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We can do this by performing inverse operations.

**Step 3: Subtract 3 from Both Sides**

First, subtract 3 from both sides of the equation to eliminate the constant term on the left side:

\[
2x + 3 - 3 = 11 - 3
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
2x = 8
\]

**Step 4: Divide by 2**

Next, divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( x \):

\[
\frac{2x}{2} = \frac{8}{2}
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
x = 4
\]

**Step 5: Verify the Solution**

To ensure the solution is correct, substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation:

\[
2(4) + 3 = 11
\]

Calculate the left side:

\[
8 + 3 = 11
\]

Since both sides of the equation are equal, our solution is verified.

**Final Answer:**

The solution to the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \) is \( x = 4 \).
