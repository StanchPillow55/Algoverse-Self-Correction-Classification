Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we first need to understand what "Sample math problem 193" refers to. Since the problem itself is not provided, let's assume it involves a common type of math problem, such as solving an equation, finding the area of a shape, or working with a sequence. Without specific details, I'll create a hypothetical problem and solve it step-by-step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**
Solve for \( x \) in the equation: \( 2x + 5 = 13 \).

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Equation:**
   The equation given is \( 2x + 5 = 13 \). This is a linear equation in one variable, \( x \).

2. **Isolate the Variable:**
   To solve for \( x \), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We can do this by performing operations that will leave \( x \) alone on one side.

3. **Subtract 5 from Both Sides:**
   Start by eliminating the constant term on the left side of the equation. Subtract 5 from both sides:
   \[
   2x + 5 - 5 = 13 - 5
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   2x = 8
   \]

4. **Divide by 2:**
   Next, divide both sides of the equation by 2 to solve for \( x \):
   \[
   \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{8}{2}
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   x = 4
   \]

5. **Verify the Solution:**
   Substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies the equation:
   \[
   2(4) + 5 = 13
   \]
   Simplifying the left side gives:
   \[
   8 + 5 = 13
   \]
   \[
   13 = 13
   \]
   Since both sides are equal, our solution \( x = 4 \) is correct.

**Final Answer:**
The solution to the equation \( 2x + 5 = 13 \) is \( x = 4 \).

This hypothetical problem demonstrates a typical approach to solving a linear equation. If "Sample math problem 193" refers to a different type of problem, please provide additional details for a more accurate solution.
