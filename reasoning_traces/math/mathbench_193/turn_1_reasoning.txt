==================================================

To solve "Sample math problem 193," we first need to understand what the problem entails. Since the problem is not explicitly stated, I'll create a hypothetical math problem labeled as "Sample math problem 193" and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**

"Sample math problem 193: A rectangle has a length that is twice its width. If the perimeter of the rectangle is 48 units, find the dimensions of the rectangle."

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We have a rectangle with a length (L) and a width (W).
   - The length is twice the width: \( L = 2W \).
   - The perimeter of the rectangle is 48 units.

2. **Recall the Formula for Perimeter:**
   - The perimeter (P) of a rectangle is given by the formula:
     \[
     P = 2L + 2W
     \]
   - We know \( P = 48 \).

3. **Substitute the Known Values:**
   - Substitute \( L = 2W \) into the perimeter formula:
     \[
     48 = 2(2W) + 2W
     \]

4. **Simplify the Equation:**
   - Simplify the expression:
     \[
     48 = 4W + 2W
     \]
   - Combine like terms:
     \[
     48 = 6W
     \]

5. **Solve for W (Width):**
   - Divide both sides by 6 to solve for W:
     \[
     W = \frac{48}{6} = 8
     \]

6. **Find L (Length):**
   - Since \( L = 2W \), substitute W = 8:
     \[
     L = 2 \times 8 = 16
     \]

7. **Verify the Solution:**
   - Check if the dimensions satisfy the perimeter condition:
     \[
     P = 2L + 2W = 2(16) + 2(8) = 32 + 16 = 48
     \]
   - The calculated perimeter matches the given perimeter, confirming our solution is correct.

**Final Answer:**

The dimensions of the rectangle are:
- Width (W) = 8 units
- Length (L) = 16 units
