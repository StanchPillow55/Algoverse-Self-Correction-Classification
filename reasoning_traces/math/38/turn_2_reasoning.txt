Question ID: 38
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine how many ounces of tea Artemis needs to make for the party, based on the given ratio of tea to water.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Understand the Ratio:**
   - Artemis's mom uses 1 ounce of tea for an 8-ounce cup of tea. This establishes the ratio of tea to water as 1:8.

2. **Determine the Total Amount of Tea Needed:**
   - There are 12 people at the party, and each person wants a 6-ounce cup of tea.
   - Calculate the total amount of tea (in ounces) needed for all 12 people:
     \[
     \text{Total tea (in ounces)} = 12 \text{ people} \times 6 \text{ ounces/person} = 72 \text{ ounces}
     \]

3. **Apply the Ratio to Find the Amount of Tea:**
   - We know the ratio of tea to water is 1:8. This means for every 8 ounces of tea made, 1 ounce is tea, and the remaining 7 ounces are water.
   - To find out how much tea (in ounces) is needed for 72 ounces of tea:
     - Set up a proportion based on the ratio:
       \[
       \frac{\text{Tea (in ounces)}}{\text{Total tea (in ounces)}} = \frac{1}{8}
       \]
     - Let \( x \) be the amount of tea in ounces needed. Then:
       \[
       \frac{x}{72} = \frac{1}{8}
       \]
     - Solve for \( x \):
       \[
       x = \frac{72}{8} = 9
       \]

### Conclusion:

Artemis needs 9 ounces of tea to make 72 ounces of tea for the party, maintaining the same ratio her mom uses.

**Final Answer: 9 ounces of tea**
