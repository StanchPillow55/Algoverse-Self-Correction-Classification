Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine how many ounces of tea Artemis needs to make for the party, based on the given ratio of tea to water.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Understand the Ratio:**
   - We are given that Artemis's mom uses 1 ounce of tea for an 8-ounce cup of tea. This establishes a ratio of tea to water as 1:8.

2. **Determine the Ratio for the Party:**
   - The party guests each want a 6-ounce cup of tea. We need to maintain the same ratio of tea to water as 1:8.

3. **Calculate the Amount of Tea per Cup:**
   - Since the ratio is 1:8, for every 8 ounces of tea, 1 ounce of tea is used. Therefore, for a 6-ounce cup, we need to find out how much tea is required.
   - Set up a proportion to find the amount of tea needed for a 6-ounce cup:
     \[
     \frac{1 \text{ ounce of tea}}{8 \text{ ounces of water}} = \frac{x \text{ ounces of tea}}{6 \text{ ounces of water}}
     \]
   - Solve for \(x\):
     \[
     8x = 6 \times 1
     \]
     \[
     8x = 6
     \]
     \[
     x = \frac{6}{8} = \frac{3}{4}
     \]
   - So, for each 6-ounce cup of tea, Artemis needs \(\frac{3}{4}\) ounces of tea.

4. **Calculate the Total Amount of Tea for 12 People:**
   - Each person at the party wants a 6-ounce cup of tea, and there are 12 people.
   - Therefore, the total amount of tea needed is:
     \[
     12 \times \frac{3}{4} = 12 \times 0.75 = 9
     \]
   - Artemis needs 9 ounces of tea for the party.

### Final Answer:
Artemis needs 9 ounces of tea to make tea for the party.
