Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To determine how many ounces of tea Artemis needs for the party, we can follow these steps:

1. **Understand the ratio of tea to cup size**: 
   - Artemis's mom drinks an 8-ounce cup of tea and uses 1 ounce of tea. 
   - This gives us a ratio of tea to cup size: 
     \[
     \text{Ratio} = \frac{1 \text{ ounce of tea}}{8 \text{ ounces of tea}} = \frac{1}{8}
     \]

2. **Determine the amount of tea needed per cup for the party**:
   - Each of the 12 guests wants a 6-ounce cup of tea. 
   - Using the same ratio (1 ounce of tea for every 8 ounces of tea), we can calculate the amount of tea needed for a 6-ounce cup:
     \[
     \text{Tea needed for 6 ounces} = \frac{1 \text{ ounce}}{8 \text{ ounces}} \times 6 \text{ ounces} = \frac{6}{8} \text{ ounces} = \frac{3}{4} \text{ ounces}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total amount of tea needed for all guests**:
   - There are 12 guests, and each requires \(\frac{3}{4}\) ounces of tea:
     \[
     \text{Total tea needed} = 12 \text{ guests} \times \frac{3}{4} \text{ ounces per guest} = 12 \times 0.75 = 9 \text{ ounces}
     \]

Thus, the total amount of tea Artemis needs for the party is:

\[
\boxed{9} \text{ ounces}
\]
