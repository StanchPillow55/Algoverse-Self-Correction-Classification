To determine how many ounces of tea Artemis needs for the party, we can follow these steps:

1. **Understand the ratio of tea to cup size**: 
   - Artemis's mom drinks an 8-ounce cup of tea and uses 1 ounce of tea. 
   - This gives us a ratio of tea to cup size: 
     \[
     \text{Ratio} = \frac{1 \text{ ounce of tea}}{8 \text{ ounces of tea}} = \frac{1}{8}
     \]

2. **Determine the amount of tea needed per cup**:
   - For each cup of tea, we can use the same ratio. If each person at the party wants a 6-ounce cup of tea, we need to find out how much tea is required for a 6-ounce cup.
   - Using the ratio of \(\frac{1}{8}\), we can calculate the amount of tea needed for a 6-ounce cup:
     \[
     \text{Tea needed for 6-ounce cup} = 6 \text{ ounces} \times \frac{1 \text{ ounce of tea}}{8 \text{ ounces}} = \frac{6}{8} \text{ ounces of tea} = \frac{3}{4} \text{ ounces of tea}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total number of cups needed**:
   - There are 12 people at the party, and each person wants one cup of tea. Therefore, the total number of cups needed is:
     \[
     \text{Total cups} = 12
     \]

4. **Calculate the total amount of tea needed**:
   - Now, we can find the total amount of tea needed by multiplying the amount of tea needed for one cup by the total number of cups:
     \[
     \text{Total tea needed} = \text{Tea per cup} \times \text{Total cups} = \frac{3}{4} \text{ ounces} \times 12 = \frac{3 \times 12}{4} = \frac{36}{4} = 9 \text{ ounces of tea}
     \]

5. **Final answer**:
   - Therefore, the total amount of tea Artemis needs for the party is:
     \[
     \boxed{9} \text{ ounces of tea}
     \]
