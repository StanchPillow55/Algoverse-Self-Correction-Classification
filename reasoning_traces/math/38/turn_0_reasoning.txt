==================================================

To find out how fast John runs, we need to determine the total time he spends running each week and then use that to calculate his speed.

1. **Determine the total running time per week:**
   - John runs 3 hours on the first day.
   - He runs half as much on the other two days. Half of 3 hours is:
     \[
     \frac{3 \text{ hours}}{2} = 1.5 \text{ hours}
     \]
   - Therefore, on the second day, he runs 1.5 hours, and on the third day, he also runs 1.5 hours.

2. **Calculate the total running time for the week:**
   - Total time running in a week is:
     \[
     3 \text{ hours} + 1.5 \text{ hours} + 1.5 \text{ hours} = 6 \text{ hours}
     \]

3. **Determine the total distance run in a week:**
   - John runs a total of 60 miles in a week.

4. **Calculate John's running speed:**
   - Speed is calculated using the formula:
     \[
     \text{Speed} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Time}}
     \]
   - Plugging in the values we have:
     \[
     \text{Speed} = \frac{60 \text{ miles}}{6 \text{ hours}} = 10 \text{ miles per hour}
     \]

Thus, John runs at a speed of **10 miles per hour**.

Final answer: **10 miles per hour**.
