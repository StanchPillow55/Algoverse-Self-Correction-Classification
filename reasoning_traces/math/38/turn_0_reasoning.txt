==================================================

Artemis's mom drinks an 8-ounce cup of tea and uses one ounce of tea. This means the ratio of tea to water is 1:8.

For the party, each person wants a 6-ounce cup of tea. With 12 people, this means Artemis needs to make 12 * 6 = 72 ounces of tea.

Since the ratio of tea to water is 1:8, we can set up a proportion to find out how many ounces of tea Artemis needs to make 72 ounces of tea.

1/8 = x/72

To solve for x, we can cross-multiply:

8 * x = 1 * 72

8x = 72

To isolate x, we divide both sides by 8:

x = 72 / 8

x = 9

So, Artemis needs 9 ounces of tea to make 72 ounces of tea for the party.
