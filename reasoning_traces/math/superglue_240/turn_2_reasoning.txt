==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample reasoning question 240," we need to first understand what the problem is asking. However, the problem statement is incomplete or unclear as it stands. Since there is no specific mathematical question or context provided, I'll demonstrate a general approach to solving a typical math problem by using a hypothetical example.

Let's assume the problem involves solving a basic algebraic equation. Here's a step-by-step approach:

### Hypothetical Problem:
Solve for \( x \) in the equation: \( 2x + 5 = 13 \).

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Understand the Equation**: 
   The equation given is \( 2x + 5 = 13 \). This is a linear equation in one variable, \( x \).

2. **Isolate the Variable**:
   To solve for \( x \), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We start by eliminating the constant term on the left side.

   \[
   2x + 5 = 13
   \]

   Subtract 5 from both sides to remove the constant term from the left side:

   \[
   2x + 5 - 5 = 13 - 5
   \]

   Simplifying both sides gives:

   \[
   2x = 8
   \]

3. **Solve for \( x \)**:
   Now, divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( x \):

   \[
   \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{8}{2}
   \]

   Simplifying both sides gives:

   \[
   x = 4
   \]

4. **Verify the Solution**:
   Substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies the equation:

   \[
   2(4) + 5 = 13
   \]

   Simplifying the left side:

   \[
   8 + 5 = 13
   \]

   Since both sides of the equation are equal, \( x = 4 \) is indeed the correct solution.

### Final Answer:
The solution to the equation \( 2x + 5 = 13 \) is \( x = 4 \).

This example demonstrates a structured approach to solving a basic algebraic equation. If you have a specific problem or context in mind, please provide more details so I can assist you accordingly.
