==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 240" refers to. Since the problem statement is not clear or complete, let's assume that "Sample reasoning question 240" is a placeholder for a specific math problem. Without the actual content of the problem, I will demonstrate how to approach a generic math problem step by step.

Let's assume "Sample reasoning question 240" is a problem involving solving a quadratic equation. Here's how we would approach it:

### Problem: Solve the quadratic equation \( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \).

#### Step 1: Identify the coefficients
First, identify the coefficients \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \) in the quadratic equation. For example, if the equation is \( 2x^2 + 3x - 5 = 0 \), then:
- \( a = 2 \)
- \( b = 3 \)
- \( c = -5 \)

#### Step 2: Calculate the discriminant
The discriminant \( D \) of a quadratic equation is given by the formula:
\[ D = b^2 - 4ac \]

For our example:
\[ D = 3^2 - 4 \times 2 \times (-5) = 9 + 40 = 49 \]

#### Step 3: Determine the nature of the roots
- If \( D > 0 \), the equation has two distinct real roots.
- If \( D = 0 \), the equation has exactly one real root (a repeated root).
- If \( D < 0 \), the equation has two complex roots.

In our example, since \( D = 49 > 0 \), the equation has two distinct real roots.

#### Step 4: Calculate the roots
The roots of the quadratic equation can be found using the quadratic formula:
\[ x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{D}}{2a} \]

Substitute the values from our example:
\[ x = \frac{-3 \pm \sqrt{49}}{2 \times 2} \]
\[ x = \frac{-3 \pm 7}{4} \]

This gives us two solutions:
1. \( x_1 = \frac{-3 + 7}{4} = \frac{4}{4} = 1 \)
2. \( x_2 = \frac{-3 - 7}{4} = \frac{-10}{4} = -2.5 \)

#### Final Answer
The solutions to the quadratic equation \( 2x^2 + 3x - 5 = 0 \) are \( x = 1 \) and \( x = -2.5 \).

This is a demonstration of how to solve a quadratic equation step by step. If "Sample reasoning question 240" refers to a different type of problem, please provide the specific details or context of the problem for a more accurate solution.
