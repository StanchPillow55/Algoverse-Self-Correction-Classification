To solve the problem, we need to determine the weights of Elijah's dogs based on the weight of Kory's dog, and then sum all the weights together.

1. **Identify the weight of Kory's dog**:
   Kory's dog weighs 60 pounds.

2. **Calculate the weight of Elijah's first dog**:
   Elijah's first dog weighs one-fourth the weight of Kory's dog. We can calculate this as follows:
   \[
   \text{Weight of Elijah's first dog} = \frac{1}{4} \times \text{Weight of Kory's dog} = \frac{1}{4} \times 60 \text{ pounds}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Weight of Elijah's first dog} = \frac{60}{4} = 15 \text{ pounds}
   \]

3. **Calculate the weight of Elijah's second dog**:
   Elijah's second dog weighs half the weight of Kory's dog. We can calculate this as follows:
   \[
   \text{Weight of Elijah's second dog} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Weight of Kory's dog} = \frac{1}{2} \times 60 \text{ pounds}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Weight of Elijah's second dog} = \frac{60}{2} = 30 \text{ pounds}
   \]

4. **Calculate the total weight of Elijah's dogs**:
   Now we can find the total weight of both of Elijah's dogs:
   \[
   \text{Total weight of Elijah's dogs} = \text{Weight of first dog} + \text{Weight of second dog} = 15 \text{ pounds} + 30 \text{ pounds}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total weight of Elijah's dogs} = 45 \text{ pounds}
   \]

5. **Calculate the total weight of all dogs**:
   Finally, we need to find the total weight of all the dogs (both Kory's and Elijah's):
   \[
   \text{Total weight of all dogs} = \text{Weight of Kory's dog} + \text{Total weight of Elijah's dogs} = 60 \text{ pounds} + 45 \text{ pounds}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total weight of all dogs} = 105 \text{ pounds}
   \]

Thus, the total weight of Elijah and Kory's dogs altogether is \(\boxed{105}\) pounds.
