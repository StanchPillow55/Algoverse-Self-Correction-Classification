==================================================

To solve the problem, we first need to understand what "Sample math problem 354" refers to. Since no specific details are provided about this problem, I will assume it is a placeholder for a generic math problem. Let's create a sample math problem and solve it step by step.

**Sample Math Problem:**

Calculate the sum of the first 354 positive integers.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

To find the sum of the first \( n \) positive integers, we can use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series:

\[
S_n = \frac{n(n + 1)}{2}
\]

where \( S_n \) is the sum of the first \( n \) positive integers.

In this case, \( n = 354 \).

**Step 1: Plug \( n = 354 \) into the formula.**

\[
S_{354} = \frac{354(354 + 1)}{2}
\]

**Step 2: Calculate \( 354 + 1 \).**

\[
354 + 1 = 355
\]

**Step 3: Multiply 354 by 355.**

\[
354 \times 355 = 125370
\]

**Step 4: Divide the result by 2 to find the sum.**

\[
S_{354} = \frac{125370}{2} = 62685
\]

**Final Answer:**

The sum of the first 354 positive integers is \( 62,685 \).

This completes the problem-solving process, showing all calculations and reasoning.
