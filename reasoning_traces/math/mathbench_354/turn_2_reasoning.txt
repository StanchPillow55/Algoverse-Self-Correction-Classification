==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 354," we need to first understand what the problem is asking. However, the problem statement "Sample math problem 354" is not specific enough for us to determine the exact nature of the problem. It seems like a placeholder or a reference to a specific problem that isn't provided here.

To proceed, I'll assume this is a generic request for solving a math problem labeled as "354." Without specific details, I'll create a hypothetical math problem and solve it step-by-step. Let's assume the problem is a basic algebra problem:

**Hypothetical Problem 354:**
Solve for \( x \) in the equation: \( 2x + 5 = 13 \).

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Equation:**
   The equation given is \( 2x + 5 = 13 \). Our goal is to solve for \( x \).

2. **Isolate the Variable:**
   To solve for \( x \), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We start by eliminating the constant term on the left side.

   \[
   2x + 5 = 13
   \]

   Subtract 5 from both sides to remove the constant:

   \[
   2x + 5 - 5 = 13 - 5
   \]

   Simplifying both sides gives:

   \[
   2x = 8
   \]

3. **Solve for \( x \):**
   Now, we need to isolate \( x \) by dividing both sides by the coefficient of \( x \), which is 2.

   \[
   \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{8}{2}
   \]

   Simplifying both sides gives:

   \[
   x = 4
   \]

4. **Verify the Solution:**
   To ensure our solution is correct, we substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation:

   \[
   2(4) + 5 = 13
   \]

   Simplifying the left side:

   \[
   8 + 5 = 13
   \]

   \[
   13 = 13
   \]

   Since both sides of the equation are equal, our solution \( x = 4 \) is verified.

**Final Answer:**
The solution to the hypothetical problem is \( x = 4 \).

If you have a specific problem labeled as "Sample math problem 354," please provide the details, and I will be happy to solve it for you.
