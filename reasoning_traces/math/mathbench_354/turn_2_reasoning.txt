Question ID: mathbench_354
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 354," we need to first understand what the problem is asking. However, the problem statement "Sample math problem 354" is not specific and does not provide any details about what needs to be solved. Therefore, I will assume this is a placeholder and create a hypothetical math problem based on the number 354.

Let's assume the problem is as follows:

**Problem:** Find the sum of the digits of the number 354 and determine if the sum is a prime number.

**Step 1: Identify the digits of the number 354.**

The number 354 consists of the digits 3, 5, and 4.

**Step 2: Calculate the sum of the digits.**

To find the sum of the digits, we add them together:

\[ 3 + 5 + 4 = 12 \]

**Step 3: Determine if the sum is a prime number.**

A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. Let's check if 12 is a prime number.

- The number 12 is greater than 1.
- Check divisibility:
  - 12 is divisible by 2 (since it is even).
  - 12 is also divisible by 3 (since \(1 + 2 = 3\), and 3 is divisible by 3).

Since 12 has divisors other than 1 and itself, it is not a prime number.

**Final Answer:**

The sum of the digits of the number 354 is 12, and 12 is not a prime number.
