==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 354," we first need to understand what the problem is asking. However, the problem statement "Sample math problem 354" is not specific enough for us to determine the exact mathematical question or context. It seems like a placeholder or a reference to a specific problem that is not fully described here.

To proceed, let's assume that "Sample math problem 354" refers to a typical math problem that might involve basic arithmetic, algebra, geometry, or another area of mathematics. Since we don't have the specific details, I'll create a hypothetical problem and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**
Let's assume "Sample math problem 354" is a basic algebra problem:
"Find the value of \( x \) in the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \)."

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Equation:**
   The equation given is \( 2x + 3 = 11 \). This is a linear equation in one variable, \( x \).

2. **Isolate the Variable:**
   To solve for \( x \), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We can do this by performing operations that will leave \( x \) alone on one side.

3. **Subtract 3 from Both Sides:**
   To eliminate the constant term on the left side, subtract 3 from both sides of the equation:
   \[
   2x + 3 - 3 = 11 - 3
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   2x = 8
   \]

4. **Divide Both Sides by 2:**
   To solve for \( x \), divide both sides by 2:
   \[
   \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{8}{2}
   \]
   Simplifying gives:
   \[
   x = 4
   \]

5. **Verify the Solution:**
   Substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation to verify:
   \[
   2(4) + 3 = 11
   \]
   Simplifying the left side:
   \[
   8 + 3 = 11
   \]
   Since both sides of the equation are equal, the solution \( x = 4 \) is correct.

**Final Answer:**
The value of \( x \) is 4.
