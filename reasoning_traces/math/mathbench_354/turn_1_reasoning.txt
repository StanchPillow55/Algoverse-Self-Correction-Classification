==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 354," we first need to understand what the problem is asking. However, the phrase "Sample math problem 354" does not provide specific details about the problem itself. It seems to be a placeholder or reference to a specific problem that is not fully described here.

To proceed, let's assume that "Sample math problem 354" is a placeholder for a typical math problem. Since we don't have the actual problem, I'll create a hypothetical math problem and solve it step-by-step. Let's assume the problem is as follows:

**Hypothetical Problem:**
Solve for \( x \) in the equation: 
\[ 3x + 5 = 20 \]

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Equation:**
   The equation given is a linear equation in one variable, \( x \). Our goal is to isolate \( x \) on one side of the equation to find its value.

2. **Isolate the Variable:**
   To isolate \( x \), we need to perform operations that will get \( x \) by itself on one side of the equation.

3. **Subtract 5 from Both Sides:**
   Start by eliminating the constant term on the left side of the equation. Subtract 5 from both sides:
   \[
   3x + 5 - 5 = 20 - 5
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   3x = 15
   \]

4. **Divide by 3:**
   Now, divide both sides of the equation by 3 to solve for \( x \):
   \[
   \frac{3x}{3} = \frac{15}{3}
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   x = 5
   \]

5. **Verify the Solution:**
   Substitute \( x = 5 \) back into the original equation to verify the solution:
   \[
   3(5) + 5 = 20
   \]
   Simplifying the left side gives:
   \[
   15 + 5 = 20
   \]
   \[
   20 = 20
   \]
   Since both sides of the equation are equal, the solution \( x = 5 \) is verified.

**Final Answer:**
The solution to the equation \( 3x + 5 = 20 \) is \( x = 5 \).
