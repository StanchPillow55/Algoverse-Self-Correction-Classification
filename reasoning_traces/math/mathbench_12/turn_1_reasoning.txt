==================================================

Certainly! Let's tackle the problem step by step. However, it seems like the problem statement "Sample math problem 12" is not clear or complete. I'll assume you want me to solve a generic math problem involving the number 12. Let's create a problem involving basic arithmetic operations with the number 12.

**Problem:**
Calculate the result of the following expression: \( 3 \times 12 + 48 \div 6 - 5 \).

**Step-by-step Solution:**

1. **Identify the operations and their order:**
   According to the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS), we should perform calculations in the following order:
   - Parentheses/Brackets
   - Exponents/Orders (i.e., powers and roots, etc.)
   - Multiplication and Division (from left to right)
   - Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)

2. **Perform multiplication and division first:**
   - Calculate \( 3 \times 12 \):
     \[
     3 \times 12 = 36
     \]
   - Calculate \( 48 \div 6 \):
     \[
     48 \div 6 = 8
     \]

3. **Substitute back into the expression:**
   Now the expression becomes:
   \[
   36 + 8 - 5
   \]

4. **Perform addition and subtraction from left to right:**
   - First, perform the addition:
     \[
     36 + 8 = 44
     \]
   - Then, perform the subtraction:
     \[
     44 - 5 = 39
     \]

**Final Answer:**
The result of the expression \( 3 \times 12 + 48 \div 6 - 5 \) is \( 39 \).
