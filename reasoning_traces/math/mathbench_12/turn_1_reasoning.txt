Certainly! Let's work through the sample math problem step by step. However, it seems like the problem statement is incomplete with just "Sample math problem 12." I'll assume you meant a basic arithmetic problem involving the number 12. Let's create a simple problem involving 12 and solve it.

**Problem:**
Calculate the sum of 12 and 15, then multiply the result by 3. Finally, subtract 9 from the product.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Addition:**
   - First, we need to find the sum of 12 and 15.
   - Calculation: \( 12 + 15 = 27 \)

2. **Multiplication:**
   - Next, we multiply the result from the addition by 3.
   - Calculation: \( 27 \times 3 = 81 \)

3. **Subtraction:**
   - Finally, we subtract 9 from the product obtained in the previous step.
   - Calculation: \( 81 - 9 = 72 \)
