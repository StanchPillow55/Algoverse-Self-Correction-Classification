It seems like the problem statement is incomplete. However, I will assume that "Sample math problem 12" refers to a generic math problem involving the number 12. Let's create a problem involving the number 12 and solve it step by step.

**Problem:**
Calculate the sum of all even numbers from 1 to 12, inclusive.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Identify the even numbers between 1 and 12:**
   - Even numbers are those divisible by 2.
   - The even numbers between 1 and 12 are: 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12.

2. **List the even numbers:**
   - 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12

3. **Calculate the sum of these even numbers:**
   - Sum = 2 + 4 + 6 + 8 + 10 + 12

4. **Perform the addition:**
   - Start by adding the first two numbers: 2 + 4 = 6
   - Add the next number: 6 + 6 = 12
   - Add the next number: 12 + 8 = 20
   - Add the next number: 20 + 10 = 30
   - Add the final number: 30 + 12 = 42

5. **Verify the calculation:**
   - To ensure accuracy, let's add the numbers in pairs:
     - (2 + 12) + (4 + 10) + (6 + 8) = 14 + 14 + 14 = 42

**Final Answer:**
The sum of all even numbers from 1 to 12 is 42.
