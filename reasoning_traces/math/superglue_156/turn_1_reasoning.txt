==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample reasoning question 156," we need to first understand what the question is asking. However, the problem statement is incomplete and lacks specific details or numerical data to work with. Therefore, I will demonstrate a general approach to solving a typical math problem by outlining the steps one might take if given a complete problem.

### General Approach to Solving a Math Problem

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - Carefully read the problem statement.
   - Identify what is being asked.
   - Determine what information is given and what needs to be found.

2. **Devise a Plan:**
   - Consider possible strategies to solve the problem, such as:
     - Drawing a diagram.
     - Writing an equation.
     - Breaking the problem into smaller parts.
     - Looking for patterns.

3. **Carry Out the Plan:**
   - Execute the chosen strategy step by step.
   - Perform calculations carefully.
   - Keep track of units and ensure consistency.

4. **Check Your Work:**
   - Review each step to ensure accuracy.
   - Verify that the solution makes sense in the context of the problem.
   - Consider alternative methods to confirm the result.

5. **State the Final Answer:**
   - Clearly present the solution.
   - Include units if applicable.

### Example Problem and Solution

Let's apply this approach to a hypothetical math problem:

**Example Problem:**
A rectangle has a length that is twice its width. If the perimeter of the rectangle is 36 units, find the dimensions of the rectangle.

**Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We need to find the length and width of the rectangle.
   - Given: Length \( L = 2W \) (where \( W \) is the width) and the perimeter \( P = 36 \).

2. **Devise a Plan:**
   - Use the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle: \( P = 2L + 2W \).

3. **Carry Out the Plan:**
   - Substitute \( L = 2W \) into the perimeter formula:
     \[
     36 = 2(2W) + 2W
     \]
   - Simplify and solve for \( W \):
     \[
     36 = 4W + 2W
     \]
     \[
     36 = 6W
     \]
     \[
     W = \frac{36}{6} = 6
     \]
   - Find \( L \) using \( L = 2W \):
     \[
     L = 2 \times 6 = 12
     \]

4. **Check Your Work:**
   - Verify the perimeter with the found dimensions:
     \[
     P = 2L + 2W = 2(12) + 2(6) = 24 + 12 = 36
     \]
   - The calculations are consistent with the given perimeter.

5. **State the Final Answer:**
   - The dimensions of the rectangle are: Length = 12 units, Width = 6 units.

This structured approach ensures that we thoroughly understand and solve the problem step by step. If you have a specific problem or more details about "Sample reasoning question 156," please provide them, and I will be happy to assist further!
