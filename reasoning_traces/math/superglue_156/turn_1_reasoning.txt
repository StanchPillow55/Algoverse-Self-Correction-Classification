==================================================

To solve the problem, I need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 156" refers to. However, since there is no specific math problem provided in your request, I will create a hypothetical math problem and solve it step by step, showing all calculations and reasoning.

**Hypothetical Problem:**

A farmer has a rectangular field that is 150 meters long and 100 meters wide. He wants to divide the field into smaller rectangular plots, each with an area of 500 square meters. How many such plots can he create?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - The field is a rectangle with dimensions 150 meters by 100 meters.
   - Each smaller plot should have an area of 500 square meters.
   - We need to find out how many such plots can be created.

2. **Calculate the Total Area of the Field:**
   - The area of a rectangle is given by the formula: 
     \[
     \text{Area} = \text{Length} \times \text{Width}
     \]
   - For the field:
     \[
     \text{Area of the field} = 150 \, \text{meters} \times 100 \, \text{meters} = 15,000 \, \text{square meters}
     \]

3. **Determine the Number of Plots:**
   - Each plot has an area of 500 square meters.
   - To find the number of plots, divide the total area of the field by the area of one plot:
     \[
     \text{Number of plots} = \frac{\text{Total area of the field}}{\text{Area of one plot}} = \frac{15,000 \, \text{square meters}}{500 \, \text{square meters}}
     \]
   - Perform the division:
     \[
     \text{Number of plots} = \frac{15,000}{500} = 30
     \]

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The farmer can create 30 smaller plots, each with an area of 500 square meters.

**Final Answer:**
The farmer can create 30 plots, each with an area of 500 square meters.
