==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 156" refers to. Since the question is not explicitly stated, I'll assume it's a placeholder for a typical math problem. Let's create a sample math problem and solve it step by step.

**Sample Problem:**

A car travels from City A to City B at a constant speed of 60 miles per hour. The distance between City A and City B is 180 miles. After reaching City B, the car immediately returns to City A at a constant speed of 40 miles per hour. What is the average speed of the car for the entire journey?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Calculate the time taken to travel from City A to City B:**

   \[
   \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{180 \text{ miles}}{60 \text{ miles per hour}} = 3 \text{ hours}
   \]

2. **Calculate the time taken to travel from City B back to City A:**

   \[
   \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{180 \text{ miles}}{40 \text{ miles per hour}} = 4.5 \text{ hours}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total time for the entire journey:**

   \[
   \text{Total Time} = 3 \text{ hours} + 4.5 \text{ hours} = 7.5 \text{ hours}
   \]

4. **Calculate the total distance for the entire journey:**

   \[
   \text{Total Distance} = 180 \text{ miles} + 180 \text{ miles} = 360 \text{ miles}
   \]

5. **Calculate the average speed for the entire journey:**

   The average speed is given by the total distance divided by the total time.

   \[
   \text{Average Speed} = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Total Time}} = \frac{360 \text{ miles}}{7.5 \text{ hours}} = 48 \text{ miles per hour}
   \]

**Final Answer:**

The average speed of the car for the entire journey is 48 miles per hour.
