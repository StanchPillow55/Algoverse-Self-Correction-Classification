==================================================

To determine how long Jack is gone from home, we need to calculate the total time he spends driving to the museum and back, and then add the time he spends at the museum.

### Step 1: Calculate the time taken to drive to the museum

Jack drives 150 miles to the museum at a speed of 75 mph. We can use the formula for time, which is:

\[
\text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}}
\]

For the trip to the museum:

\[
\text{Time to museum} = \frac{150 \text{ miles}}{75 \text{ mph}} = 2 \text{ hours}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the time taken to drive back home

The return trip is the same distance and speed, so the time taken to drive back home is also:

\[
\text{Time back home} = \frac{150 \text{ miles}}{75 \text{ mph}} = 2 \text{ hours}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the total driving time

Now, we add the time taken to drive to the museum and the time taken to drive back home:

\[
\text{Total driving time} = \text{Time to museum} + \text{Time back home} = 2 \text{ hours} + 2 \text{ hours} = 4 \text{ hours}
\]

### Step 4: Add the time spent at the museum

Jack spends 6 hours at the museum. Therefore, the total time he is gone from home is:

\[
\text{Total time gone} = \text{Total driving time} + \text{Time at museum} = 4 \text{ hours} + 6 \text{ hours} = 10 \text{ hours}
\]

### Final Answer

Jack is gone from home for a total of **10 hours**.
