==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 421" entails. Since the problem statement is not specific, I'll assume it's a placeholder for a typical math problem. Let's create a hypothetical math problem and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**

A store sells apples at $2 each and oranges at $3 each. If a customer buys a total of 10 fruits and spends $25, how many apples and how many oranges did the customer buy?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( a \) be the number of apples.
   - Let \( o \) be the number of oranges.

2. **Set Up Equations:**
   - Since the total number of fruits is 10, we have:
     \[
     a + o = 10
     \]
   - Since the total cost is $25, we have:
     \[
     2a + 3o = 25
     \]

3. **Solve the System of Equations:**

   We have the system:
   \[
   \begin{align*}
   a + o &= 10 \quad \text{(Equation 1)} \\
   2a + 3o &= 25 \quad \text{(Equation 2)}
   \end{align*}
   \]

   - From Equation 1, express \( a \) in terms of \( o \):
     \[
     a = 10 - o
     \]

   - Substitute \( a = 10 - o \) into Equation 2:
     \[
     2(10 - o) + 3o = 25
     \]

   - Simplify and solve for \( o \):
     \[
     20 - 2o + 3o = 25
     \]
     \[
     20 + o = 25
     \]
     \[
     o = 25 - 20
     \]
     \[
     o = 5
     \]

   - Substitute \( o = 5 \) back into Equation 1 to find \( a \):
     \[
     a + 5 = 10
     \]
     \[
     a = 10 - 5
     \]
     \[
     a = 5
     \]

4. **Verify the Solution:**

   - Check the total number of fruits:
     \[
     a + o = 5 + 5 = 10
     \]
     This matches the given total of 10 fruits.

   - Check the total cost:
     \[
     2a + 3o = 2(5) + 3(5) = 10 + 15 = 25
     \]
     This matches the given total cost of $25.

**Final Answer:**

The customer bought 5 apples and 5 oranges.
