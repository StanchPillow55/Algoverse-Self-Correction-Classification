==================================================

To solve the problem effectively, I need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 421" refers to. Since this is not a standard math problem and lacks specific details, I'll assume it's a placeholder for a typical math problem-solving scenario. Without specific details, I'll demonstrate a general approach to solving a math problem using logical reasoning and calculations.

### Step-by-Step Problem Solving Approach:

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - Identify what is being asked.
   - Determine what information is given.
   - Clarify any terms or concepts that are not immediately clear.

2. **Devise a Plan:**
   - Consider possible strategies to solve the problem, such as:
     - Drawing a diagram.
     - Creating an equation.
     - Breaking the problem into smaller parts.
     - Looking for patterns.

3. **Carry Out the Plan:**
   - Execute the chosen strategy step by step.
   - Perform calculations carefully.
   - Keep track of units and ensure consistency.

4. **Review/Check the Solution:**
   - Verify each step of the calculation.
   - Check if the solution makes sense in the context of the problem.
   - Consider alternative methods to confirm the result.

### Example Problem and Solution:

Let's create a hypothetical math problem to illustrate the process:

**Problem:** A rectangle has a length that is twice its width. If the perimeter of the rectangle is 36 units, find the dimensions of the rectangle.

**Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We need to find the length and width of the rectangle.
   - The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula: \( P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width}) \).
   - We know the perimeter is 36 units.

2. **Devise a Plan:**
   - Let the width be \( w \).
   - Then the length is \( 2w \).
   - Substitute these into the perimeter formula: \( 2 \times (2w + w) = 36 \).

3. **Carry Out the Plan:**
   - Simplify the equation: \( 2 \times (3w) = 36 \).
   - This simplifies to \( 6w = 36 \).
   - Solve for \( w \): \( w = \frac{36}{6} = 6 \).
   - The width is 6 units.
   - The length is \( 2w = 2 \times 6 = 12 \) units.

4. **Review/Check the Solution:**
   - Check the perimeter with the found dimensions: \( 2 \times (12 + 6) = 2 \times 18 = 36 \).
   - The calculations are correct, and the solution makes sense.

**Final Answer:**
The dimensions of the rectangle are 12 units by 6 units.

This approach can be applied to a wide range of math problems by adapting the specific details and calculations to fit the given problem. If "Sample reasoning question 421" refers to a specific problem, please provide additional details for a tailored solution.
