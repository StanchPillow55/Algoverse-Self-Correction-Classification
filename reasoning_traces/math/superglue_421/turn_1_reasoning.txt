==================================================

To solve the problem effectively, I need to understand the context and details of "Sample reasoning question 421." However, since the problem statement is not provided, I'll demonstrate a general approach to solving a typical math reasoning problem. If you have a specific problem in mind, please provide the details, and I'll be happy to assist you with that.

Let's assume a sample reasoning problem:

**Problem:** A farmer has a rectangular field with a length that is twice its width. If the perimeter of the field is 300 meters, what are the dimensions of the field?

**Step-by-step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We have a rectangular field.
   - Let the width of the field be \( w \) meters.
   - The length of the field is twice the width, so the length is \( 2w \) meters.
   - The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula: \( P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width}) \).
   - We know the perimeter is 300 meters.

2. **Set Up the Equation:**
   - Substitute the known values into the perimeter formula:
     \[
     300 = 2 \times (2w + w)
     \]

3. **Simplify and Solve for \( w \):**
   - Simplify the expression inside the parentheses:
     \[
     300 = 2 \times (3w)
     \]
   - Simplify further:
     \[
     300 = 6w
     \]
   - Solve for \( w \) by dividing both sides by 6:
     \[
     w = \frac{300}{6} = 50
     \]

4. **Find the Length:**
   - Since the length is twice the width:
     \[
     \text{Length} = 2w = 2 \times 50 = 100
     \]

5. **Verify the Solution:**
   - Check the perimeter with the found dimensions:
     \[
     P = 2 \times (100 + 50) = 2 \times 150 = 300
     \]
   - The calculated perimeter matches the given perimeter, confirming the solution is correct.

6. **State the Final Answer:**
   - The dimensions of the field are: Width = 50 meters, Length = 100 meters.

This step-by-step approach ensures that we understand the problem, set up the correct equations, solve for the unknowns, and verify our solution. If you have a specific problem or need further assistance, please provide more details.
