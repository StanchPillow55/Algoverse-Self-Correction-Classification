==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 426" entails. Since the question is not explicitly stated, I'll assume it's a hypothetical problem that requires logical reasoning and mathematical calculations. Let's create a sample problem and solve it step by step.

**Sample Problem:**

A company produces two types of widgets: Type A and Type B. The production cost for Type A is $5 per unit, and for Type B, it is $8 per unit. The company sells Type A widgets for $10 each and Type B widgets for $15 each. In a given month, the company produced a total of 1,000 widgets and made a total revenue of $12,000. How many of each type of widget did the company produce?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( x \) be the number of Type A widgets produced.
   - Let \( y \) be the number of Type B widgets produced.

2. **Set Up Equations:**
   - Total widgets produced: 
     \[
     x + y = 1000
     \]
   - Total revenue from sales:
     \[
     10x + 15y = 12000
     \]

3. **Solve the System of Equations:**

   We have the system:
   \[
   \begin{align*}
   x + y &= 1000 \quad \text{(Equation 1)} \\
   10x + 15y &= 12000 \quad \text{(Equation 2)}
   \end{align*}
   \]

   **Substitute Equation 1 into Equation 2:**

   From Equation 1, express \( y \) in terms of \( x \):
   \[
   y = 1000 - x
   \]

   Substitute this into Equation 2:
   \[
   10x + 15(1000 - x) = 12000
   \]

   Simplify and solve for \( x \):
   \[
   10x + 15000 - 15x = 12000
   \]
   \[
   -5x + 15000 = 12000
   \]
   \[
   -5x = 12000 - 15000
   \]
   \[
   -5x = -3000
   \]
   \[
   x = 600
   \]

   **Find \( y \):**

   Substitute \( x = 600 \) back into Equation 1:
   \[
   600 + y = 1000
   \]
   \[
   y = 1000 - 600
   \]
   \[
   y = 400
   \]

4. **Verify the Solution:**

   Check the revenue equation with \( x = 600 \) and \( y = 400 \):
   \[
   10(600) + 15(400) = 6000 + 6000 = 12000
   \]

   The calculations are correct.

**Final Answer:**

The company produced 600 Type A widgets and 400 Type B widgets.
