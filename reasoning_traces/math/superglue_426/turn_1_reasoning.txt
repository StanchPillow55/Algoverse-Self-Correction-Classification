==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 426" refers to. Since the problem statement doesn't provide specific details about the question, I'll assume it's a placeholder for a typical math problem. Let's create a hypothetical math problem and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**

Calculate the sum of the first 20 positive integers.

**Step-by-step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   We need to find the sum of the first 20 positive integers. The sequence of the first 20 positive integers is: 1, 2, 3, ..., 20.

2. **Identify the Formula:**
   The sum of the first \( n \) positive integers can be calculated using the formula:
   \[
   S = \frac{n(n + 1)}{2}
   \]
   where \( S \) is the sum and \( n \) is the number of terms.

3. **Substitute the Values:**
   In this problem, \( n = 20 \). Substitute 20 into the formula:
   \[
   S = \frac{20(20 + 1)}{2}
   \]

4. **Calculate the Sum:**
   \[
   S = \frac{20 \times 21}{2}
   \]
   \[
   S = \frac{420}{2}
   \]
   \[
   S = 210
   \]

5. **Verify the Calculation:**
   To ensure the calculation is correct, let's verify by adding the numbers manually:
   \[
   1 + 2 + 3 + \ldots + 20
   \]
   Pair the numbers from the start and end:
   \[
   (1 + 20), (2 + 19), (3 + 18), \ldots, (10 + 11)
   \]
   Each pair sums to 21, and there are 10 such pairs:
   \[
   10 \times 21 = 210
   \]

6. **Conclusion:**
   Both the formula and manual addition confirm that the sum of the first 20 positive integers is 210.

**Final Answer:**
The sum of the first 20 positive integers is 210.
