Let's denote the number of strawberry cubes that Mary makes as \( S \). According to the problem, the number of blueberry cubes \( B \) is given by the equation:

\[
B = 5S - 4
\]

We also know that the total number of ice cubes (strawberry and blueberry) is 116. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[
S + B = 116
\]

Now, we can substitute the expression for \( B \) from the first equation into the second equation:

\[
S + (5S - 4) = 116
\]

Next, we simplify the equation:

\[
S + 5S - 4 = 116
\]

Combining like terms gives:

\[
6S - 4 = 116
\]

Now, we add 4 to both sides to isolate the term with \( S \):

\[
6S = 116 + 4
\]
\[
6S = 120
\]

Next, we divide both sides by 6 to solve for \( S \):

\[
S = \frac{120}{6} = 20
\]

Now that we have the number of strawberry cubes, we can find the number of blueberry cubes using the equation for \( B \):

\[
B = 5S - 4
\]
\[
B = 5(20) - 4
\]
\[
B = 100 - 4
\]
\[
B = 96
\]

Thus, the number of blueberry cubes that Mary makes is:

\[
\boxed{96}
\]
