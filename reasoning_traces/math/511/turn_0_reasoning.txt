To solve the problem, we need to determine how much money Gerald has left after working for a week and spending a total of $100.

1. **Calculate Gerald's earnings for the week:**
   - Gerald earns $30 per day.
   - There are 7 days in a week.
   - Therefore, his total earnings for the week can be calculated as follows:

   \[
   \text{Total earnings} = \text{Daily earnings} \times \text{Number of days}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total earnings} = 30 \, \text{dollars/day} \times 7 \, \text{days} = 210 \, \text{dollars}
   \]

2. **Determine how much he has left after spending:**
   - Gerald spent a total of $100 during the week.
   - To find out how much he has left, we subtract his total spending from his total earnings:

   \[
   \text{Amount left} = \text{Total earnings} - \text{Total spending}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Amount left} = 210 \, \text{dollars} - 100 \, \text{dollars} = 110 \, \text{dollars}
   \]

3. **Final answer:**
   - After working for a week and spending $100, Gerald has $110 left.

Thus, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{110}
\]
