Question ID: 323
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of flags Jay and Gloria need to buy and then calculate the cost based on the sale price.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of guests.**

Jay invited 22 people, and Gloria invited 36 people. To find the total number of guests, we add these two numbers together:

\[ 22 + 36 = 58 \]

**Step 2: Include Jay and Gloria in the count.**

Since Jay and Gloria also want a flag each, we need to add 2 more to the total:

\[ 58 + 2 = 60 \]

So, they need a total of 60 flags.

**Step 3: Determine how many sets of flags they need to buy.**

The craft store sells flags in sets of 5 for $1.00. To find out how many sets they need to buy, we divide the total number of flags by the number of flags per set:

\[ \frac{60}{5} = 12 \]

They need to buy 12 sets of flags.

**Step 4: Calculate the total cost.**

Since each set of 5 flags costs $1.00, and they need 12 sets, the total cost is:

\[ 12 \times 1.00 = 12.00 \]

**Final Answer:**

Jay and Gloria will spend $12.00 at the craft store to buy enough flags for all their guests and themselves.
