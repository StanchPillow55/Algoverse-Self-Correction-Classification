==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to determine how much weaker Shannon's iced coffee becomes after cooling it by 65 degrees and adding 15 milliliters of cream. 

### Step 1: Calculate the number of ice cubes needed to cool the coffee by 65 degrees.

Each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees. To find out how many ice cubes are needed to achieve a cooling of 65 degrees, we can use the following formula:

\[
\text{Number of ice cubes} = \frac{\text{Total cooling needed}}{\text{Cooling per ice cube}} = \frac{65 \text{ degrees}}{13 \text{ degrees/ice cube}} = 5 \text{ ice cubes}
\]

### Step 2: Determine how much weaker the coffee becomes from the ice cubes.

Each ice cube makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker. Therefore, the total weakening from the 5 ice cubes is calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Weakening from ice cubes} = \text{Number of ice cubes} \times \text{Weakening per ice cube} = 5 \text{ ice cubes} \times 12 \text{ milliliters/ice cube} = 60 \text{ milliliters}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the weakening from the cream.

Shannon adds 15 milliliters of cream to her iced coffee. Since any added liquid also weakens the coffee, we need to account for the cream as well. The weakening from the cream is:

\[
\text{Weakening from cream} = 15 \text{ milliliters}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the total weakening of the iced coffee.

Now, we can find the total weakening of the iced coffee by adding the weakening from the ice cubes and the cream:

\[
\text{Total weakening} = \text{Weakening from ice cubes} + \text{Weakening from cream} = 60 \text{ milliliters} + 15 \text{ milliliters} = 75 \text{ milliliters}
\]

### Final Answer

Thus, Shannon's iced coffee is **75 milliliters weaker** after cooling it by 65 degrees and adding 15 milliliters of cream. 

\[
\boxed{75}
\]
