==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to determine the total number of flags Jay and Gloria need to buy for their party, and then calculate the cost based on the price of the flags at the craft store.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of guests.**

Jay invited 22 people, and Gloria invited 36 people. To find the total number of guests, we add these two numbers together:

\[
\text{Total guests} = \text{Guests invited by Jay} + \text{Guests invited by Gloria} = 22 + 36 = 58
\]

**Step 2: Include Jay and Gloria in the total count.**

Since Jay and Gloria also want a flag each, we need to add 2 more to the total number of guests:

\[
\text{Total flags needed} = \text{Total guests} + \text{Jay} + \text{Gloria} = 58 + 2 = 60
\]

**Step 3: Determine how many sets of flags to buy.**

The craft store sells flags in sets of 5 for $1.00. To find out how many sets of flags we need to buy, we divide the total number of flags needed by the number of flags per set:

\[
\text{Number of sets needed} = \frac{\text{Total flags needed}}{\text{Flags per set}} = \frac{60}{5} = 12
\]

**Step 4: Calculate the total cost.**

Since each set of flags costs $1.00, we can calculate the total cost by multiplying the number of sets by the cost per set:

\[
\text{Total cost} = \text{Number of sets needed} \times \text{Cost per set} = 12 \times 1.00 = 12.00
\]

**Final Answer:**

Jay and Gloria would spend a total of **$12.00** at the craft store for the flags.
