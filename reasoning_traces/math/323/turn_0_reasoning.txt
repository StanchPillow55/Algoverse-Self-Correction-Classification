==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of flags Jay and Gloria need to buy and then calculate the cost based on the sale price.

### Step-by-step Solution:

1. **Calculate the Total Number of Guests:**
   - Jay invited 22 people.
   - Gloria invited 36 people.
   - Total number of guests = Number of people Jay invited + Number of people Gloria invited
   \[
   22 + 36 = 58
   \]

2. **Include Jay and Gloria in the Count:**
   - Jay and Gloria also want a flag each.
   - Total number of people needing a flag = Total number of guests + Jay + Gloria
   \[
   58 + 1 + 1 = 60
   \]

3. **Determine the Number of Flags Needed:**
   - Each person needs 1 flag, so they need 60 flags in total.

4. **Calculate the Cost of the Flags:**
   - The craft store sells flags at a rate of 5 flags for $1.00.
   - First, determine how many sets of 5 flags are needed to reach or exceed 60 flags.
   - Divide the total number of flags needed by the number of flags per set:
   \[
   \frac{60}{5} = 12
   \]
   - This means they need 12 sets of 5 flags.

5. **Calculate the Total Cost:**
   - Since each set of 5 flags costs $1.00, the total cost for 12 sets is:
   \[
   12 \times 1.00 = 12.00
   \]

### Final Answer:
Jay and Gloria will spend $12.00 at the craft store to buy enough flags for all their guests and themselves.
