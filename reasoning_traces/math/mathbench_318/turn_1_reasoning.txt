Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample math problem 318" refers to. Since the problem itself isn't explicitly provided, I'll assume a generic math problem with the number 318 involved. Let's create a problem involving the number 318 and solve it step by step.

**Problem:**
Find the sum of the digits of the number 318, and then determine if this sum is a prime number.

**Step 1: Find the sum of the digits of 318.**

The number 318 consists of three digits: 3, 1, and 8. To find the sum of these digits, we simply add them together:

\[ 3 + 1 + 8 = 12 \]

**Step 2: Determine if the sum (12) is a prime number.**

A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. Let's check if 12 is a prime number by identifying its divisors.

The divisors of 12 are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 12.

Since 12 has divisors other than 1 and itself, it is not a prime number.

**Conclusion:**

The sum of the digits of 318 is 12, and 12 is not a prime number.

**Final Answer:**

The sum of the digits of 318 is 12, and it is not a prime number.
