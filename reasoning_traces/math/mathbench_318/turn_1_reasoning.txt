==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 318," we need to first understand what the problem is asking. However, the problem statement provided is not clear or complete. It simply states "Sample math problem 318," which does not give us any specific mathematical question to solve.

To proceed, let's assume that "Sample math problem 318" refers to a typical math problem that might be labeled as such in a textbook or worksheet. Since we don't have the actual problem, I'll create a hypothetical math problem that could be labeled as "318" and solve it step by step.

Hypothetical Problem 318:
"Find the value of \( x \) in the equation \( 2x + 5 = 13 \)."

Let's solve this problem step by step:

1. **Understand the Equation**: 
   The equation given is \( 2x + 5 = 13 \). This is a linear equation in one variable, \( x \).

2. **Isolate the Variable**:
   To find the value of \( x \), we need to isolate \( x \) on one side of the equation. We can do this by performing operations that will simplify the equation.

3. **Subtract 5 from Both Sides**:
   To eliminate the constant term on the left side, subtract 5 from both sides of the equation:
   \[
   2x + 5 - 5 = 13 - 5
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   2x = 8
   \]

4. **Divide by 2**:
   Now, divide both sides of the equation by 2 to solve for \( x \):
   \[
   \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{8}{2}
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   x = 4
   \]

5. **Verify the Solution**:
   Substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies the equation:
   \[
   2(4) + 5 = 13
   \]
   Simplifying the left side gives:
   \[
   8 + 5 = 13
   \]
   \[
   13 = 13
   \]
   Since both sides of the equation are equal, our solution is verified.

**Final Answer**:
The value of \( x \) is \( 4 \).

This completes the solution to the hypothetical problem. If you have a specific problem labeled as "Sample math problem 318," please provide the details, and I will be happy to solve it for you.
