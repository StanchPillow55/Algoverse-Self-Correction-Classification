==================================================

It seems like you've mentioned "Sample math problem 318," but without specific details or context about what the problem entails, I can't provide a solution. However, I can guide you through a general approach to solving math problems. If you provide more details, I can give a more specific solution. Here's a general framework for solving math problems:

### Step-by-Step Approach to Solving Math Problems

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - Read the problem carefully.
   - Identify what is being asked.
   - Determine what information is given and what needs to be found.

2. **Devise a Plan:**
   - Consider possible strategies to solve the problem (e.g., algebraic manipulation, drawing a diagram, logical reasoning).
   - Choose the most appropriate method based on the problem type.

3. **Carry Out the Plan:**
   - Execute the chosen strategy step by step.
   - Perform calculations carefully.
   - Keep track of units and ensure consistency.

4. **Check Your Work:**
   - Review each step to ensure accuracy.
   - Verify that the solution makes sense in the context of the problem.
   - Check calculations for errors.

5. **State the Final Answer:**
   - Clearly write down the final answer.
   - Include units if applicable.

### Example Problem and Solution

**Example Problem:**
Solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).

**Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We need to find the value of \( x \) that satisfies the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).

2. **Devise a Plan:**
   - We can solve for \( x \) by isolating it on one side of the equation.

3. **Carry Out the Plan:**
   - Start with the equation: \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).
   - Subtract 3 from both sides to isolate the term with \( x \):
     \[
     2x + 3 - 3 = 11 - 3
     \]
     \[
     2x = 8
     \]
   - Divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( x \):
     \[
     \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{8}{2}
     \]
     \[
     x = 4
     \]

4. **Check Your Work:**
   - Substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation to verify:
     \[
     2(4) + 3 = 11
     \]
     \[
     8 + 3 = 11
     \]
   - The left side equals the right side, confirming our solution is correct.

5. **State the Final Answer:**
   - The solution to the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \) is \( x = 4 \).
