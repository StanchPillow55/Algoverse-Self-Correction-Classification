==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 64" refers to. Unfortunately, without additional context or specific details about the content of "Sample reasoning question 64," it's impossible to provide a precise solution. However, I can guide you through a general approach to solving reasoning problems.

### General Approach to Solving Reasoning Problems:

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - Carefully read the problem statement.
   - Identify what is being asked.
   - Note any given information or constraints.

2. **Break Down the Problem:**
   - Divide the problem into smaller, manageable parts.
   - Determine the relationships between different pieces of information.

3. **Develop a Strategy:**
   - Decide on a method to solve the problem (e.g., algebraic manipulation, logical deduction, drawing diagrams).
   - Consider multiple approaches if the first one seems complex.

4. **Execute the Plan:**
   - Carry out calculations or logical steps as per your chosen strategy.
   - Keep track of your work to avoid errors.

5. **Verify Your Solution:**
   - Check your work for accuracy.
   - Ensure that your solution satisfies all given conditions.

6. **State the Final Answer:**
   - Clearly present your final answer.
   - Include units or labels if applicable.

### Example of a Reasoning Problem:

Let's create a hypothetical reasoning problem to illustrate the process:

**Problem:** A farmer has chickens and cows. Together, they have a total of 30 heads and 100 legs. How many chickens and how many cows does the farmer have?

**Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - Chickens have 1 head and 2 legs.
   - Cows have 1 head and 4 legs.
   - Total heads = 30
   - Total legs = 100

2. **Set Up Equations:**
   - Let \( c \) be the number of chickens and \( w \) be the number of cows.
   - Equation for heads: \( c + w = 30 \)
   - Equation for legs: \( 2c + 4w = 100 \)

3. **Solve the System of Equations:**
   - From the first equation: \( c = 30 - w \)
   - Substitute into the second equation: \( 2(30 - w) + 4w = 100 \)
   - Simplify: \( 60 - 2w + 4w = 100 \)
   - Combine like terms: \( 2w = 40 \)
   - Solve for \( w \): \( w = 20 \)

4. **Find \( c \):**
   - Substitute \( w = 20 \) back into \( c = 30 - w \)
   - \( c = 30 - 20 = 10 \)

5. **Verify:**
   - Check heads: \( 10 + 20 = 30 \) (correct)
   - Check legs: \( 2(10) + 4(20) = 20 + 80 = 100 \) (correct)

6. **State the Final Answer:**
   - The farmer has 10 chickens and 20 cows.

This structured approach can be applied to a wide range of reasoning problems. If you have specific details or context for "Sample reasoning question 64," please provide them, and I can offer a more tailored solution.
