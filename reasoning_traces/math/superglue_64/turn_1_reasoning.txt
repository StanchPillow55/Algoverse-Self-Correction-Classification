==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 64" refers to. Since there is no specific mathematical problem provided, I'll assume this is a placeholder for a typical math problem. Let's create a sample problem and solve it step by step.

**Sample Problem:**

A farmer has a rectangular field that is 50 meters long and 30 meters wide. He wants to build a fence around the field and also divide the field into two equal parts with a fence parallel to the shorter side. Calculate the total length of the fence required.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We have a rectangular field with dimensions: length = 50 meters, width = 30 meters.
   - We need to fence the perimeter of the field and also add a fence parallel to the shorter side (width) to divide the field into two equal parts.

2. **Calculate the Perimeter of the Field:**
   - The formula for the perimeter \( P \) of a rectangle is:
     \[
     P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width})
     \]
   - Substitute the given values:
     \[
     P = 2 \times (50 + 30) = 2 \times 80 = 160 \text{ meters}
     \]

3. **Calculate the Additional Fence Required:**
   - Since the field is divided into two equal parts with a fence parallel to the width, the additional fence will be equal to the length of the field.
   - Additional fence = 50 meters.

4. **Calculate the Total Length of the Fence:**
   - Total fence length = Perimeter + Additional fence
   - Total fence length = 160 + 50 = 210 meters

5. **Final Answer:**
   - The total length of the fence required is 210 meters.

By breaking down the problem into smaller parts and solving each part step by step, we ensure that we cover all aspects of the problem and arrive at the correct solution. The final answer is that the farmer needs 210 meters of fencing.
