==================================================

To solve "Sample math problem 382," we need to first understand what the problem is asking. Since the problem is not explicitly stated, I'll create a hypothetical math problem with the number 382 and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**
Calculate the sum of the digits of the number 382 and then multiply the result by 3.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Identify the digits of the number 382:**
   - The number 382 consists of the digits 3, 8, and 2.

2. **Calculate the sum of the digits:**
   - Add the digits together: \(3 + 8 + 2\).
   - Perform the addition:
     \[
     3 + 8 = 11
     \]
     \[
     11 + 2 = 13
     \]
   - The sum of the digits is 13.

3. **Multiply the sum by 3:**
   - Take the sum of the digits (13) and multiply it by 3:
     \[
     13 \times 3 = 39
     \]

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The final result after multiplying the sum of the digits of 382 by 3 is 39.

Therefore, the solution to the hypothetical problem is 39.
