==================================================

To solve the problem, we first need to understand what "Sample math problem 382" refers to. Since this is not a standard problem description, I will assume it is a placeholder for a specific math problem. Without the actual problem statement, I cannot provide a solution. However, I can guide you on how to approach solving a math problem step by step.

### General Steps to Solve a Math Problem:

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - Read the problem carefully.
   - Identify what is being asked.
   - Determine what information is given and what is missing.

2. **Devise a Plan:**
   - Think about the strategies that can be used to solve the problem. This could involve algebraic manipulation, drawing a diagram, or breaking the problem into smaller parts.
   - Consider similar problems you have solved before.

3. **Carry Out the Plan:**
   - Execute the steps you have planned.
   - Perform calculations carefully.
   - Keep track of units and make sure your work is organized.

4. **Check Your Work:**
   - Verify each step of your solution.
   - Check if the answer makes sense in the context of the problem.
   - Review calculations for errors.

5. **State the Final Answer:**
   - Clearly write down the final answer.
   - Ensure it answers the question posed in the problem.

### Example Problem:

Let's solve an example problem using these steps:

**Problem:** Solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).

**Step 1: Understand the Problem**
- We need to find the value of \( x \) that makes the equation true.

**Step 2: Devise a Plan**
- We can isolate \( x \) by performing algebraic operations.

**Step 3: Carry Out the Plan**
- Start with the equation: \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).
- Subtract 3 from both sides to isolate the term with \( x \):
  \[
  2x + 3 - 3 = 11 - 3
  \]
  \[
  2x = 8
  \]
- Divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( x \):
  \[
  \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{8}{2}
  \]
  \[
  x = 4
  \]

**Step 4: Check Your Work**
- Substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation to verify:
  \[
  2(4) + 3 = 11
  \]
  \[
  8 + 3 = 11
  \]
  - The left side equals the right side, so our solution is correct.

**Step 5: State the Final Answer**
- The solution to the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \) is \( x = 4 \).
