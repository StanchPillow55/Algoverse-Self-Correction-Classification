Question ID: mathbench_430
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 430," we first need to understand what the problem is asking. However, the problem statement "Sample math problem 430" is not specific enough for us to determine what the actual mathematical question is. It seems like a placeholder or a reference to a specific problem that hasn't been provided.

To proceed, let's assume that "Sample math problem 430" refers to a generic math problem that we can solve. Since we don't have the actual problem, I'll create a sample math problem and solve it step by step.

### Sample Math Problem:
Let's assume the problem is:
"Find the value of \( x \) in the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \)."

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Understand the Equation:**
   The equation given is \( 2x + 3 = 11 \). This is a linear equation in one variable, \( x \).

2. **Isolate the Variable:**
   To find the value of \( x \), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We can do this by performing operations that will simplify the equation.

3. **Subtract 3 from Both Sides:**
   \[
   2x + 3 - 3 = 11 - 3
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   2x = 8
   \]

4. **Divide Both Sides by 2:**
   \[
   \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{8}{2}
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   x = 4
   \]

5. **Verify the Solution:**
   Substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies the equation:
   \[
   2(4) + 3 = 11
   \]
   Simplifying the left side gives:
   \[
   8 + 3 = 11
   \]
   Since both sides of the equation are equal, our solution is verified.

### Final Answer:
The value of \( x \) is \( 4 \).

If you have a specific problem labeled as "Sample math problem 430," please provide the details of the problem so I can solve it accurately.
