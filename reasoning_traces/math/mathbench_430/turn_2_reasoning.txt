Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample math problem 430" refers to. Since there is no specific problem statement given, I'll assume that "Sample math problem 430" is a placeholder for a typical math problem. For demonstration purposes, let's create a sample math problem and solve it step by step.

**Sample Math Problem:**

"Calculate the sum of the first 430 positive integers."

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   We need to find the sum of the first 430 positive integers. The sequence of these integers is 1, 2, 3, ..., 430.

2. **Identify the Formula:**
   The sum of the first \( n \) positive integers can be calculated using the formula:
   \[
   S = \frac{n(n + 1)}{2}
   \]
   where \( S \) is the sum and \( n \) is the number of terms.

3. **Substitute the Values:**
   In this problem, \( n = 430 \). Substitute 430 into the formula:
   \[
   S = \frac{430(430 + 1)}{2}
   \]

4. **Calculate Inside the Parentheses:**
   First, calculate \( 430 + 1 \):
   \[
   430 + 1 = 431
   \]

5. **Multiply the Terms:**
   Next, multiply 430 by 431:
   \[
   430 \times 431 = 185,330
   \]

6. **Divide by 2:**
   Finally, divide the product by 2 to find the sum:
   \[
   S = \frac{185,330}{2} = 92,665
   \]

7. **State the Final Answer:**
   The sum of the first 430 positive integers is 92,665.

**Final Answer:**
The sum of the first 430 positive integers is 92,665.
