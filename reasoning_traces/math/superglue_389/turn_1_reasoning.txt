Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 389" entails. Since the problem statement is not specific, I'll assume this is a hypothetical math problem that requires logical reasoning and problem-solving skills. Let's create a sample problem and solve it step by step.

**Sample Problem:**

Let's assume "Sample reasoning question 389" is as follows:

"A train travels from City A to City B, a distance of 240 miles. The train travels at a constant speed of 60 miles per hour. How long does it take for the train to reach City B from City A?"

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Identify the Given Information:**
   - Distance from City A to City B = 240 miles
   - Speed of the train = 60 miles per hour

2. **Determine What is Being Asked:**
   - We need to find the time it takes for the train to travel from City A to City B.

3. **Use the Formula for Time:**
   - The formula to calculate time when distance and speed are known is:
     \[
     \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}}
     \]

4. **Substitute the Known Values into the Formula:**
   - Substitute the distance (240 miles) and speed (60 miles per hour) into the formula:
     \[
     \text{Time} = \frac{240 \text{ miles}}{60 \text{ miles per hour}}
     \]

5. **Perform the Calculation:**
   - Divide 240 by 60:
     \[
     \text{Time} = 4 \text{ hours}
     \]

6. **Verify the Calculation:**
   - To ensure the calculation is correct, consider the units:
     - Miles cancel out, leaving hours as the unit for time, which is appropriate.
   - Recalculate to double-check:
     \[
     \frac{240}{60} = 4
     \]

7. **State the Final Answer:**
   - The train takes 4 hours to travel from City A to City B.

By following these steps, we've logically solved the problem and verified the solution. The final answer is:

**Final Answer:**
The train takes 4 hours to reach City B from City A.
