==================================================

To solve the problem effectively, I need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 389" entails. However, since the problem statement is not provided, I'll demonstrate a general approach to solving a typical math problem by breaking it down into steps. Let's assume a hypothetical math problem and solve it step-by-step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**

"Calculate the value of \( x \) in the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \)."

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We are given a linear equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).
   - Our goal is to solve for \( x \).

2. **Isolate the Variable:**
   - To find the value of \( x \), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation.
   - Start by eliminating the constant term on the left side of the equation.

3. **Subtract 3 from Both Sides:**
   \[
   2x + 3 - 3 = 11 - 3
   \]
   - This simplifies to:
   \[
   2x = 8
   \]

4. **Divide Both Sides by 2:**
   \[
   \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{8}{2}
   \]
   - Simplifying gives:
   \[
   x = 4
   \]

5. **Verify the Solution:**
   - Substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies the equation:
   \[
   2(4) + 3 = 11
   \]
   - Simplifying the left side:
   \[
   8 + 3 = 11
   \]
   - Since both sides of the equation are equal, \( x = 4 \) is the correct solution.

6. **State the Final Answer:**
   - The value of \( x \) is \( 4 \).

This structured approach ensures that each step is clear and logical, leading to the correct solution. If you have a specific problem or need further assistance, please provide additional details or context.
