==================================================

To solve the problem, let's first understand what "Sample reasoning question 389" might entail. Since the problem statement is not specific, I'll assume it's a generic math problem that requires logical reasoning and calculations. I'll create a hypothetical problem and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**

A company produces two types of products, A and B. The profit from each unit of product A is $5, and the profit from each unit of product B is $8. The company can produce a maximum of 100 units of product A and 80 units of product B per day. However, due to resource constraints, the combined production of products A and B cannot exceed 150 units per day. Determine the optimal production mix of products A and B to maximize profit.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( x \) be the number of units of product A produced per day.
   - Let \( y \) be the number of units of product B produced per day.

2. **Objective Function:**
   - The profit function \( P \) to be maximized is given by:
     \[
     P = 5x + 8y
     \]

3. **Constraints:**
   - The production constraints are:
     \[
     x \leq 100 \quad \text{(cannot produce more than 100 units of A)}
     \]
     \[
     y \leq 80 \quad \text{(cannot produce more than 80 units of B)}
     \]
     \[
     x + y \leq 150 \quad \text{(combined production cannot exceed 150 units)}
     \]
   - Additionally, \( x \geq 0 \) and \( y \geq 0 \) since negative production is not possible.

4. **Graphical Solution:**
   - Plot the constraints on a graph with \( x \) on the horizontal axis and \( y \) on the vertical axis.
   - The feasible region is bounded by the lines \( x = 100 \), \( y = 80 \), and \( x + y = 150 \).

5. **Identify Corner Points:**
   - The corner points of the feasible region are where the lines intersect:
     - \( (0, 0) \)
     - \( (100, 0) \)
     - \( (70, 80) \) from solving \( x + y = 150 \) with \( y = 80 \)
     - \( (100, 50) \) from solving \( x + y = 150 \) with \( x = 100 \)

6. **Evaluate the Objective Function at Each Corner Point:**
   - \( P(0, 0) = 5(0) + 8(0) = 0 \)
   - \( P(100, 0) = 5(100) + 8(0) = 500 \)
   - \( P(70, 80) = 5(70) + 8(80) = 350 + 640 = 990 \)
   - \( P(100, 50) = 5(100) + 8(50) = 500 + 400 = 900 \)

7. **Determine the Maximum Profit:**
   - The maximum profit is \( 990 \), which occurs at the point \( (70, 80) \).

**Final Answer:**
The optimal production mix to maximize profit is 70 units of product A and 80 units of product B, yielding a maximum profit of $990 per day.
