==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 389" entails. Since the problem statement is not explicitly provided, I'll assume that "Sample reasoning question 389" refers to a typical math problem that involves logical reasoning and calculations. Let's create a hypothetical problem and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**

A company produces two types of widgets: Type A and Type B. The company sells Type A widgets for $50 each and Type B widgets for $70 each. Last month, the company sold a total of 500 widgets and earned $30,000 in revenue. How many of each type of widget did the company sell?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( x \) be the number of Type A widgets sold.
   - Let \( y \) be the number of Type B widgets sold.

2. **Set Up Equations:**
   - The total number of widgets sold is 500:
     \[
     x + y = 500
     \]
   - The total revenue from selling the widgets is $30,000:
     \[
     50x + 70y = 30,000
     \]

3. **Solve the System of Equations:**

   We have the following system of equations:
   \[
   \begin{align*}
   x + y &= 500 \quad \text{(Equation 1)} \\
   50x + 70y &= 30,000 \quad \text{(Equation 2)}
   \end{align*}
   \]

   **Substitution Method:**
   - From Equation 1, express \( y \) in terms of \( x \):
     \[
     y = 500 - x
     \]

   - Substitute \( y = 500 - x \) into Equation 2:
     \[
     50x + 70(500 - x) = 30,000
     \]

   - Simplify and solve for \( x \):
     \[
     50x + 35,000 - 70x = 30,000
     \]
     \[
     -20x + 35,000 = 30,000
     \]
     \[
     -20x = 30,000 - 35,000
     \]
     \[
     -20x = -5,000
     \]
     \[
     x = \frac{-5,000}{-20} = 250
     \]

   - Substitute \( x = 250 \) back into the expression for \( y \):
     \[
     y = 500 - 250 = 250
     \]

4. **Verify the Solution:**
   - Check if the total number of widgets is correct:
     \[
     x + y = 250 + 250 = 500
     \]
   - Check if the total revenue is correct:
     \[
     50(250) + 70(250) = 12,500 + 17,500 = 30,000
     \]

Both conditions are satisfied, confirming that the solution is correct.

**Final Answer:**
The company sold 250 Type A widgets and 250 Type B widgets.
