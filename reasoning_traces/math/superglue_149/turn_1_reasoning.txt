==================================================

To solve the problem effectively, let's first clarify what "Sample reasoning question 149" might entail. Since the problem statement is not specific, I'll create a hypothetical reasoning problem and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**

A farmer has a rectangular field with a length that is 20 meters longer than its width. The area of the field is 1120 square meters. What are the dimensions of the field?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( w \) be the width of the field in meters.
   - Then the length of the field will be \( w + 20 \) meters.

2. **Set Up the Equation:**
   - The area of a rectangle is given by the formula: 
     \[
     \text{Area} = \text{Length} \times \text{Width}
     \]
   - Substitute the known values into the equation:
     \[
     1120 = (w + 20) \times w
     \]

3. **Expand the Equation:**
   - Distribute \( w \) in the equation:
     \[
     1120 = w^2 + 20w
     \]

4. **Rearrange the Equation:**
   - Bring all terms to one side to form a quadratic equation:
     \[
     w^2 + 20w - 1120 = 0
     \]

5. **Solve the Quadratic Equation:**
   - We can solve this using the quadratic formula:
     \[
     w = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
     \]
   - Here, \( a = 1 \), \( b = 20 \), and \( c = -1120 \).

6. **Calculate the Discriminant:**
   - The discriminant (\( b^2 - 4ac \)) is:
     \[
     20^2 - 4 \times 1 \times (-1120) = 400 + 4480 = 4880
     \]

7. **Find the Roots:**
   - Calculate the square root of the discriminant:
     \[
     \sqrt{4880} \approx 69.86
     \]
   - Substitute back into the quadratic formula:
     \[
     w = \frac{-20 \pm 69.86}{2}
     \]

8. **Calculate Possible Values for \( w \):**
   - First root:
     \[
     w = \frac{-20 + 69.86}{2} \approx \frac{49.86}{2} \approx 24.93
     \]
   - Second root (not physically meaningful as width cannot be negative):
     \[
     w = \frac{-20 - 69.86}{2} \approx \frac{-89.86}{2} \approx -44.93
     \]

9. **Determine the Dimensions:**
   - Since width cannot be negative, we take \( w \approx 24.93 \).
   - The length is \( w + 20 \approx 24.93 + 20 = 44.93 \).

10. **Verify the Solution:**
    - Check the area with these dimensions:
      \[
      \text{Area} = 24.93 \times 44.93 \approx 1120 \text{ square meters}
      \]

**Final Answer:**

The dimensions of the field are approximately 24.93 meters in width and 44.93 meters in length.
