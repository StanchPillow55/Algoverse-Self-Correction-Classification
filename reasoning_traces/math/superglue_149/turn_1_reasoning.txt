Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample reasoning question 149," we need to first understand what the problem is asking. However, the problem statement is incomplete and lacks specific details or numerical data to work with. Therefore, I will demonstrate a general approach to solving a typical math problem by outlining the steps one might take if the problem were fully specified.

### Step-by-Step Approach:

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - Carefully read the problem statement to identify what is being asked.
   - Determine what information is given and what needs to be found.

2. **Identify the Type of Problem:**
   - Determine if the problem is related to algebra, geometry, calculus, statistics, etc.
   - This helps in deciding which mathematical principles and formulas to apply.

3. **Gather Information:**
   - List all known values and variables.
   - Note any relationships or equations that are provided or can be inferred.

4. **Develop a Plan:**
   - Decide on a strategy to solve the problem. This could involve setting up equations, drawing diagrams, or using specific formulas.
   - Consider if there are multiple ways to approach the problem and choose the most efficient method.

5. **Execute the Plan:**
   - Carry out the calculations or logical steps as per the chosen strategy.
   - Be meticulous with arithmetic operations and algebraic manipulations.

6. **Check Your Work:**
   - Verify each step to ensure there are no errors.
   - Check if the solution makes sense in the context of the problem.

7. **State the Final Answer:**
   - Clearly present the solution, ensuring it answers the question posed.
   - Include units if applicable.

### Example Problem (Hypothetical):

Let's assume the problem is: "Solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \)."

#### Solution:

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We need to find the value of \( x \) that satisfies the equation.

2. **Identify the Type of Problem:**
   - This is a basic algebraic equation.

3. **Gather Information:**
   - The equation given is \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).

4. **Develop a Plan:**
   - Isolate \( x \) by performing algebraic operations.

5. **Execute the Plan:**
   - Subtract 3 from both sides: 
     \[
     2x + 3 - 3 = 11 - 3 \implies 2x = 8
     \]
   - Divide both sides by 2:
     \[
     \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{8}{2} \implies x = 4
     \]

6. **Check Your Work:**
   - Substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation:
     \[
     2(4) + 3 = 8 + 3 = 11
     \]
   - The left side equals the right side, confirming the solution is correct.

7. **State the Final Answer:**
   - The solution to the equation is \( x = 4 \).

Since the original problem "Sample reasoning question 149" lacks specifics, the above example illustrates a complete approach to solving a typical math problem. If you have a specific problem or additional details, please provide them for a more targeted solution.
