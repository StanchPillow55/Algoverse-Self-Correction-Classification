==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to first understand the context and details of the question. However, the question provided is "Sample reasoning question 149," which does not give specific details or numbers to work with. Therefore, I will create a hypothetical math problem to demonstrate how to solve it step by step.

Let's assume the problem is as follows:

**Problem:**
A company produces two types of products: A and B. The company sells product A for $50 each and product B for $70 each. The cost to produce product A is $30, and the cost to produce product B is $40. Last month, the company sold a total of 500 products, consisting of both A and B, and made a total revenue of $28,000. How many of each product did the company sell?

**Solution:**

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( x \) be the number of product A sold.
   - Let \( y \) be the number of product B sold.

2. **Set Up Equations:**
   - We know the total number of products sold is 500:
     \[
     x + y = 500
     \]
   - We also know the total revenue is $28,000. The revenue from product A is \( 50x \) and from product B is \( 70y \):
     \[
     50x + 70y = 28,000
     \]

3. **Solve the System of Equations:**
   - We have the system:
     \[
     \begin{align*}
     x + y &= 500 \\
     50x + 70y &= 28,000
     \end{align*}
     \]

   - Solve the first equation for \( y \):
     \[
     y = 500 - x
     \]

   - Substitute \( y = 500 - x \) into the second equation:
     \[
     50x + 70(500 - x) = 28,000
     \]

   - Simplify and solve for \( x \):
     \[
     50x + 35,000 - 70x = 28,000
     \]
     \[
     -20x + 35,000 = 28,000
     \]
     \[
     -20x = 28,000 - 35,000
     \]
     \[
     -20x = -7,000
     \]
     \[
     x = \frac{-7,000}{-20}
     \]
     \[
     x = 350
     \]

   - Substitute \( x = 350 \) back into the equation for \( y \):
     \[
     y = 500 - 350
     \]
     \[
     y = 150
     \]

4. **Verify the Solution:**
   - Check the total number of products:
     \[
     350 + 150 = 500
     \]
   - Check the total revenue:
     \[
     50(350) + 70(150) = 17,500 + 10,500 = 28,000
     \]

Both checks confirm that the solution is correct.

**Final Answer:**
The company sold 350 units of product A and 150 units of product B.
