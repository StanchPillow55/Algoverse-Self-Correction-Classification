==================================================

To solve this problem, I need more information about the specific question or problem statement for "Sample reasoning question 244." Since the problem statement is not provided, I'll guide you through a general approach to solving a math reasoning problem.

### General Approach to Solving a Math Reasoning Problem:

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - Carefully read the problem statement.
   - Identify what is being asked.
   - Note any given information or constraints.

2. **Devise a Plan:**
   - Consider different strategies to solve the problem, such as drawing a diagram, creating an equation, or breaking the problem into smaller parts.
   - Choose the most appropriate strategy based on the problem type.

3. **Carry Out the Plan:**
   - Execute the chosen strategy step by step.
   - Perform calculations carefully, and keep track of your work.
   - If applicable, use algebraic manipulation, logical reasoning, or geometric properties.

4. **Check Your Work:**
   - Verify each step to ensure accuracy.
   - Check if the solution makes sense in the context of the problem.
   - Re-calculate or re-evaluate if necessary.

5. **State the Final Answer:**
   - Clearly present the final answer.
   - Ensure the answer is in the correct form and units, if applicable.

### Example Problem and Solution:

**Example Problem:**
A rectangle has a length that is twice its width. If the perimeter of the rectangle is 36 units, what are the dimensions of the rectangle?

**Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We need to find the length and width of the rectangle.
   - Given: Length = 2 Ã— Width, Perimeter = 36 units.

2. **Devise a Plan:**
   - Use the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle: \( P = 2 \times (\text{Length} + \text{Width}) \).

3. **Carry Out the Plan:**
   - Let the width be \( w \).
   - Then the length is \( 2w \).
   - Substitute into the perimeter formula: 
     \[
     36 = 2 \times (2w + w)
     \]
   - Simplify the equation:
     \[
     36 = 2 \times 3w
     \]
     \[
     36 = 6w
     \]
   - Solve for \( w \):
     \[
     w = \frac{36}{6} = 6
     \]
   - Find the length:
     \[
     \text{Length} = 2w = 2 \times 6 = 12
     \]

4. **Check Your Work:**
   - Calculate the perimeter with these dimensions:
     \[
     P = 2 \times (12 + 6) = 2 \times 18 = 36
     \]
   - The calculated perimeter matches the given perimeter.

5. **State the Final Answer:**
   - The width of the rectangle is 6 units, and the length is 12 units.

If you provide the specific details of "Sample reasoning question 244," I can work through that problem using a similar approach.
