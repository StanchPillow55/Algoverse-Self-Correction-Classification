==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 244" refers to. Since the question itself is not provided, I will create a hypothetical math problem and solve it step by step.

Let's assume the problem is as follows:

**Problem:**
A rectangle has a length that is 4 units more than its width. If the perimeter of the rectangle is 24 units, find the dimensions of the rectangle.

**Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We have a rectangle with a length (L) and a width (W).
   - The length is 4 units more than the width: \( L = W + 4 \).
   - The perimeter of the rectangle is 24 units.

2. **Recall the Formula for Perimeter:**
   - The perimeter (P) of a rectangle is given by the formula:
     \[
     P = 2L + 2W
     \]

3. **Substitute the Known Values:**
   - We know the perimeter is 24 units, so:
     \[
     2L + 2W = 24
     \]

4. **Substitute the Expression for L:**
   - Since \( L = W + 4 \), substitute this into the perimeter equation:
     \[
     2(W + 4) + 2W = 24
     \]

5. **Simplify the Equation:**
   - Distribute the 2:
     \[
     2W + 8 + 2W = 24
     \]
   - Combine like terms:
     \[
     4W + 8 = 24
     \]

6. **Solve for W:**
   - Subtract 8 from both sides:
     \[
     4W = 16
     \]
   - Divide by 4:
     \[
     W = 4
     \]

7. **Find the Length L:**
   - Substitute \( W = 4 \) back into the expression for L:
     \[
     L = W + 4 = 4 + 4 = 8
     \]

8. **Verify the Solution:**
   - Check the perimeter with these dimensions:
     \[
     P = 2L + 2W = 2(8) + 2(4) = 16 + 8 = 24
     \]
   - The calculated perimeter matches the given perimeter, confirming our solution is correct.

**Final Answer:**
The dimensions of the rectangle are a width of 4 units and a length of 8 units.
