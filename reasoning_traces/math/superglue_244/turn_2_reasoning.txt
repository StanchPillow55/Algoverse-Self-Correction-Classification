Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem effectively, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 244" entails. Since the problem statement is not explicitly provided, I'll demonstrate a general approach to solving a reasoning-based math problem by creating a hypothetical problem and solving it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**

Let's assume "Sample reasoning question 244" is a problem involving basic algebra and logical reasoning. The problem is as follows:

"John has twice as many apples as Mary. Together, they have 18 apples. How many apples does each person have?"

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( M \) represent the number of apples Mary has.
   - Since John has twice as many apples as Mary, John has \( 2M \) apples.

2. **Set Up the Equation:**
   - According to the problem, the total number of apples they have together is 18.
   - Therefore, the equation is: 
     \[
     M + 2M = 18
     \]

3. **Simplify the Equation:**
   - Combine like terms:
     \[
     3M = 18
     \]

4. **Solve for \( M \):**
   - Divide both sides of the equation by 3 to isolate \( M \):
     \[
     M = \frac{18}{3} = 6
     \]

5. **Find the Number of Apples John Has:**
   - Since John has twice as many apples as Mary, calculate John's apples:
     \[
     2M = 2 \times 6 = 12
     \]

6. **Verify the Solution:**
   - Check if the total number of apples is correct:
     \[
     M + 2M = 6 + 12 = 18
     \]
   - The total is indeed 18, which matches the problem statement.

**Final Answer:**
- Mary has 6 apples.
- John has 12 apples.

This solution demonstrates a clear, logical approach to solving a reasoning-based math problem by defining variables, setting up equations, solving them, and verifying the results.
