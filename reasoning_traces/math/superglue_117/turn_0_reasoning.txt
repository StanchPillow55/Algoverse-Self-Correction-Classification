==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 117" refers to. Unfortunately, without additional context or details about the specific content of "Sample reasoning question 117," it's impossible to provide a direct solution. However, I can guide you through a general approach to solving reasoning questions, which often involve logical thinking, pattern recognition, or mathematical calculations.

### General Approach to Solving Reasoning Questions:

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - Carefully read the question to understand what is being asked.
   - Identify any given data, patterns, or relationships.

2. **Identify the Type of Reasoning:**
   - Determine if the question involves numerical reasoning, logical reasoning, pattern recognition, or another type of reasoning.

3. **Break Down the Problem:**
   - Divide the problem into smaller, manageable parts.
   - Solve each part step by step.

4. **Look for Patterns or Relationships:**
   - If the problem involves sequences or patterns, identify the rule governing the pattern.
   - For logical reasoning, identify premises and conclusions.

5. **Perform Calculations if Necessary:**
   - If the problem involves mathematical calculations, perform them carefully.
   - Double-check your calculations to avoid errors.

6. **Check Your Work:**
   - Review each step to ensure it follows logically from the previous step.
   - Ensure that your final answer addresses the question asked.

7. **State Your Final Answer:**
   - Clearly state the final answer, ensuring it is in the correct format or units if applicable.

### Example Problem and Solution:

Let's consider a hypothetical reasoning problem:

**Problem:** Find the next number in the sequence: 2, 4, 8, 16, ...

**Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We need to find the next number in the sequence.

2. **Identify the Type of Reasoning:**
   - This is a pattern recognition problem involving a numerical sequence.

3. **Break Down the Problem:**
   - Look at the sequence: 2, 4, 8, 16.

4. **Look for Patterns or Relationships:**
   - Notice that each number is double the previous number:
     - \(4 = 2 \times 2\)
     - \(8 = 4 \times 2\)
     - \(16 = 8 \times 2\)

5. **Perform Calculations if Necessary:**
   - To find the next number, multiply the last number by 2:
     - Next number = \(16 \times 2 = 32\)

6. **Check Your Work:**
   - Verify the pattern holds for all given numbers and the calculated next number.

7. **State Your Final Answer:**
   - The next number in the sequence is 32.
