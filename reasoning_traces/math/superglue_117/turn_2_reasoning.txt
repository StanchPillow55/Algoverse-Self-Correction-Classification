==================================================

To solve the problem, we first need to understand what "Sample reasoning question 117" entails. Since the problem statement is not explicitly provided, I'll demonstrate a general approach to solving a typical math problem by outlining the steps and reasoning involved.

### Step-by-Step Approach:

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - Identify what is being asked. This involves reading the problem carefully and determining the goal.
   - Determine what information is given and what needs to be found.

2. **Devise a Plan:**
   - Consider possible strategies to solve the problem. This could involve algebraic manipulation, drawing diagrams, or breaking the problem into smaller parts.

3. **Carry Out the Plan:**
   - Execute the chosen strategy step by step.
   - Perform calculations carefully, showing all work to avoid mistakes.

4. **Review/Check the Solution:**
   - Verify that the solution makes sense in the context of the problem.
   - Check calculations for accuracy and ensure that all parts of the problem are addressed.

### Example Problem:

Let's assume "Sample reasoning question 117" is a typical algebra problem:

**Problem:** Solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).

**Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We need to find the value of \( x \) that satisfies the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).

2. **Devise a Plan:**
   - Isolate \( x \) on one side of the equation.

3. **Carry Out the Plan:**
   - Start with the equation: \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).
   - Subtract 3 from both sides to isolate the term with \( x \):
     \[
     2x + 3 - 3 = 11 - 3
     \]
     \[
     2x = 8
     \]
   - Divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( x \):
     \[
     \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{8}{2}
     \]
     \[
     x = 4
     \]

4. **Review/Check the Solution:**
   - Substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation to verify:
     \[
     2(4) + 3 = 11
     \]
     \[
     8 + 3 = 11
     \]
   - The left side equals the right side, confirming that \( x = 4 \) is correct.

**Final Answer:**
\( x = 4 \)

This example demonstrates a structured approach to solving a math problem, ensuring clarity and accuracy in the solution process. If "Sample reasoning question 117" refers to a specific problem, please provide the details, and I can solve it accordingly.
