==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample reasoning question 117," we need to first understand what the problem is asking. However, since the problem statement is not provided, I'll demonstrate a general approach to solving a math problem by creating a hypothetical problem and working through it step-by-step.

Let's assume the problem is as follows:

**Problem:**
A farmer has a rectangular field that is 50 meters long and 30 meters wide. He wants to build a fence around the field and also divide the field into two equal rectangular sections with a fence parallel to the shorter side. Calculate the total length of the fence required.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - The field is rectangular with a length of 50 meters and a width of 30 meters.
   - We need to calculate the total length of the fence required to enclose the field and divide it into two equal sections.

2. **Calculate the Perimeter of the Field:**
   - The perimeter \( P \) of a rectangle is given by the formula:
     \[
     P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width})
     \]
   - Substitute the given values:
     \[
     P = 2 \times (50 + 30) = 2 \times 80 = 160 \text{ meters}
     \]
   - This is the length of the fence needed to enclose the entire field.

3. **Divide the Field into Two Equal Sections:**
   - The field is divided into two equal sections with a fence parallel to the shorter side (width).
   - Since the field is 50 meters long, dividing it into two equal sections means each section will have a length of 25 meters.
   - The additional fence required to divide the field is equal to the length of the field, which is 50 meters.

4. **Calculate the Total Length of the Fence:**
   - Total length of the fence is the perimeter of the field plus the additional fence to divide the field:
     \[
     \text{Total Fence Length} = 160 + 50 = 210 \text{ meters}
     \]

5. **Final Answer:**
   - The total length of the fence required is 210 meters.

By following these steps, we have calculated the total length of the fence needed for the given problem. If you have a specific problem statement or need further assistance, please provide more details.
