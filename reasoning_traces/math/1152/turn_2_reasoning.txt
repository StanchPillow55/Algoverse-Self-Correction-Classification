==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to determine the probability that both lottery tickets purchased by Mark are winners.

1. **Identify the probabilities of winning for each ticket**:
   - The first ticket has a 20% chance of winning. In decimal form, this is:
     \[
     P(\text{Ticket 1 wins}) = 0.20
     \]

   - The second ticket is described as being three times more likely to win than the first ticket. Therefore, we calculate the probability of winning for the second ticket:
     \[
     P(\text{Ticket 2 wins}) = 3 \times P(\text{Ticket 1 wins}) = 3 \times 0.20 = 0.60
     \]

2. **Calculate the probability that both tickets are winners**:
   - To find the probability that both tickets are winners, we multiply the probabilities of each ticket winning, assuming the outcomes are independent:
     \[
     P(\text{Both tickets win}) = P(\text{Ticket 1 wins}) \times P(\text{Ticket 2 wins}) = 0.20 \times 0.60
     \]

   - Performing the multiplication:
     \[
     P(\text{Both tickets win}) = 0.20 \times 0.60 = 0.12
     \]

3. **Convert the probability to a percentage**:
   - To express the probability as a percentage, we multiply by 100:
     \[
     P(\text{Both tickets win}) \text{ (as a percentage)} = 0.12 \times 100 = 12\%
     \]

4. **Final answer**:
   - The probability that both tickets are winners is:
     \[
     \boxed{12\%}
     \]
