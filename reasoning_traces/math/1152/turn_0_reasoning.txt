To solve the problem, we need to determine the probability that both lottery tickets purchased by Mark are winners.

1. **Identify the probabilities of winning for each ticket:**
   - The first lottery ticket has a probability of winning of 20%. In decimal form, this is:
     \[
     P(\text{Ticket 1 wins}) = 0.20
     \]

   - The second lottery ticket is described as being three times more likely to win than the first ticket. To find the probability of winning for the second ticket, we multiply the probability of the first ticket by 3:
     \[
     P(\text{Ticket 2 wins}) = 3 \times P(\text{Ticket 1 wins}) = 3 \times 0.20 = 0.60
     \]

2. **Calculate the probability that both tickets are winners:**
   - Since the outcomes of the two tickets are independent events, we can find the probability that both tickets win by multiplying their individual probabilities:
     \[
     P(\text{Both tickets win}) = P(\text{Ticket 1 wins}) \times P(\text{Ticket 2 wins}) = 0.20 \times 0.60
     \]

   - Performing the multiplication:
     \[
     P(\text{Both tickets win}) = 0.20 \times 0.60 = 0.12
     \]

3. **Convert the probability to a percentage:**
   - To express the probability as a percentage, we multiply by 100:
     \[
     P(\text{Both tickets win}) \text{ (as a percentage)} = 0.12 \times 100 = 12\%
     \]

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The probability that both tickets are winners is:
     \[
     \boxed{12\%}
     \]
