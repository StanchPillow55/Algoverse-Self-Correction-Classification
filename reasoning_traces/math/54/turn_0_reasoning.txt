==================================================

Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Total Earnings**: Leah earned a total of $28.

2. **Spending on Milkshake**: Leah spent a seventh of her earnings on a milkshake. We calculate this amount as follows:
   \[
   \text{Amount spent on milkshake} = \frac{1}{7} \times 28 = 4
   \]

3. **Remaining Money After Milkshake**: After spending on the milkshake, we find out how much money Leah has left:
   \[
   \text{Remaining money} = 28 - 4 = 24
   \]

4. **Savings Account Contribution**: Leah put half of the remaining money into her savings account. We calculate this amount:
   \[
   \text{Amount put in savings} = \frac{1}{2} \times 24 = 12
   \]

5. **Remaining Money After Savings**: Now, we find out how much money Leah has left after putting some into savings:
   \[
   \text{Remaining money} = 24 - 12 = 12
   \]

6. **Money Left in Wallet**: Leah left the remaining $12 in her wallet.

7. **Dog's Action**: The dog shredded all the money in her wallet except for $1. This means Leah lost the amount that was in her wallet minus the $1 that remained:
   \[
   \text{Amount lost} = 12 - 1 = 11
   \]

8. **Final Answer**: Leah lost $11.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{11}
\]
