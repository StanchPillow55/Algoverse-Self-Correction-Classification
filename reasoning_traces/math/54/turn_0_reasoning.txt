==================================================

To find out how many kittens the Doubtfire family now has, we need to break down the problem step by step.

1. **Identify the number of adopted kittens**: The Doubtfire sisters have adopted 7 kittens from the local animal shelter.

2. **Determine the number of kittens from Patchy**: According to the problem, Patchy, the first house cat, has had thrice the number of adopted kittens. Since they adopted 7 kittens, we calculate the number of kittens Patchy has had as follows:
   \[
   \text{Kittens from Patchy} = 3 \times \text{Number of adopted kittens} = 3 \times 7 = 21
   \]

3. **Determine the number of kittens from Trixie**: The problem states that Trixie, the other house cat, has had 12 kittens. Therefore:
   \[
   \text{Kittens from Trixie} = 12
   \]

4. **Calculate the total number of kittens**: Now we need to find the total number of kittens the Doubtfire family has by adding the number of adopted kittens, the kittens from Patchy, and the kittens from Trixie:
   \[
   \text{Total kittens} = \text{Adopted kittens} + \text{Kittens from Patchy} + \text{Kittens from Trixie}
   \]
   Substituting the values we have:
   \[
   \text{Total kittens} = 7 + 21 + 12
   \]

5. **Perform the addition**:
   \[
   7 + 21 = 28
   \]
   \[
   28 + 12 = 40
   \]

6. **Final answer**: The total number of kittens the Doubtfire family now has is:
   \[
   \boxed{40}
   \]
