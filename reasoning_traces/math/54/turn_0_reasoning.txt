==================================================

First, let's find out how much Leah spent on a milkshake. She spent a seventh of her total earnings, which were $28. 

To find out how much she spent, we divide her total earnings by 7:

$28 รท 7 = $4

So, Leah spent $4 on a milkshake.

Next, let's find out how much money Leah had left after buying the milkshake. We subtract the cost of the milkshake from her total earnings:

$28 - $4 = $24

So, Leah had $24 left after buying the milkshake.

Then, Leah put half of this money into her savings account. To find out how much she saved, we divide the remaining money by 2:

$24 รท 2 = $12

So, Leah put $12 into her savings account.

This means that Leah had $12 left in her wallet. However, her dog shredded all but $1 of this money. 

To find out how much money Leah lost, we subtract the money that was left from the money that was in her wallet before:

$12 - $1 = $11

So, Leah lost $11.
