==================================================

To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step, calculating the ages of each person mentioned in the problem.

1. **Determine Steve's age**:
   - Steve is given to be 60 years old.

2. **Determine Steve's wife's age**:
   - Steve's wife is 4 years older than him.
   - Therefore, Steve's wife's age = Steve's age + 4 years = 60 + 4 = 64 years old.

3. **Determine their son's age**:
   - The son is currently half as old as his mom (Steve's wife).
   - Therefore, the son's age = (1/2) × (Steve's wife's age) = (1/2) × 64 = 32 years old.

4. **Determine the son's wife's age**:
   - The son's wife is 3 years younger than her husband (the son).
   - Therefore, the son's wife's age = Son's age - 3 years = 32 - 3 = 29 years old.

Now, we have calculated the ages as follows:
- Steve: 60 years old
- Steve's wife: 64 years old
- Their son: 32 years old
- Son's wife: 29 years old

Finally, we need to answer the question: How old is Steve's son's wife?

The answer is:
**29 years old**.
