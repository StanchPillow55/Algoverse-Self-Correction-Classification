==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to determine how many days Billy works and how many people he helps during that time.

### Step 1: Calculate the total number of days from March 1st to April 19th.

- March has 31 days, so from March 1st to March 31st, there are 31 days.
- From April 1st to April 19th, there are 19 days.

Now, we add these two periods together:

\[
31 \text{ days (March)} + 19 \text{ days (April)} = 50 \text{ days}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the number of days Billy takes off.

Billy takes 20% of the total days off. We first calculate 20% of 50 days:

\[
20\% \text{ of } 50 = 0.20 \times 50 = 10 \text{ days}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the number of days Billy works.

Now, we subtract the days he takes off from the total days:

\[
50 \text{ days} - 10 \text{ days} = 40 \text{ days}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the number of people Billy helps each day.

Billy helps 2 people per hour and works for 3 hours a day. Therefore, the number of people he helps in one day is:

\[
2 \text{ people/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours/day} = 6 \text{ people/day}
\]

### Step 5: Calculate the total number of people Billy helps over the working days.

Now, we multiply the number of people he helps per day by the number of days he works:

\[
6 \text{ people/day} \times 40 \text{ days} = 240 \text{ people}
\]

### Final Answer

Billy helps a total of **240 people**.
