Question ID: superglue_267
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we first need to understand what "Sample reasoning question 267" entails. Since the question itself is not provided, I'll demonstrate a general approach to solving a typical math problem by creating a hypothetical problem and solving it step-by-step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**

Calculate the area of a triangle with a base of 10 units and a height of 5 units.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We need to find the area of a triangle.
   - We are given the base (b) of the triangle as 10 units.
   - We are given the height (h) of the triangle as 5 units.

2. **Recall the Formula for the Area of a Triangle:**
   - The formula for the area \( A \) of a triangle is:
     \[
     A = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height}
     \]

3. **Substitute the Given Values into the Formula:**
   - Substitute \( b = 10 \) and \( h = 5 \) into the formula:
     \[
     A = \frac{1}{2} \times 10 \times 5
     \]

4. **Perform the Calculations:**
   - First, multiply the base and the height:
     \[
     10 \times 5 = 50
     \]
   - Then, multiply the result by \(\frac{1}{2}\):
     \[
     A = \frac{1}{2} \times 50 = 25
     \]

5. **State the Final Answer:**
   - The area of the triangle is 25 square units.

This step-by-step approach demonstrates how to solve a problem by understanding the question, recalling relevant formulas, substituting known values, performing calculations, and stating the final answer. If you have a specific problem or need further assistance, please provide more details!
