==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 267" refers to. Since the problem statement is not specific, I'll assume this is a placeholder for a typical math problem. Let's create a hypothetical problem and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**

A company produces two types of widgets: Type A and Type B. The company sells Type A widgets for $50 each and Type B widgets for $70 each. Last month, the company sold a total of 500 widgets and made $28,000 in revenue. How many of each type of widget did the company sell?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Define the Variables:**
   - Let \( x \) be the number of Type A widgets sold.
   - Let \( y \) be the number of Type B widgets sold.

2. **Set Up the Equations:**
   - From the problem, we know the total number of widgets sold is 500. Therefore, we have the equation:
     \[
     x + y = 500
     \]
   - We also know the total revenue is $28,000. The revenue from Type A widgets is \( 50x \) and from Type B widgets is \( 70y \). Therefore, we have the equation:
     \[
     50x + 70y = 28000
     \]

3. **Solve the System of Equations:**
   - We have the system of equations:
     \[
     \begin{align*}
     x + y &= 500 \quad \text{(Equation 1)} \\
     50x + 70y &= 28000 \quad \text{(Equation 2)}
     \end{align*}
     \]

   - Solve Equation 1 for \( y \):
     \[
     y = 500 - x
     \]

   - Substitute \( y = 500 - x \) into Equation 2:
     \[
     50x + 70(500 - x) = 28000
     \]

   - Simplify and solve for \( x \):
     \[
     50x + 35000 - 70x = 28000
     \]
     \[
     -20x + 35000 = 28000
     \]
     \[
     -20x = 28000 - 35000
     \]
     \[
     -20x = -7000
     \]
     \[
     x = \frac{-7000}{-20}
     \]
     \[
     x = 350
     \]

   - Substitute \( x = 350 \) back into Equation 1 to find \( y \):
     \[
     350 + y = 500
     \]
     \[
     y = 500 - 350
     \]
     \[
     y = 150
     \]

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The company sold 350 Type A widgets and 150 Type B widgets.

**Final Answer:**
The company sold 350 Type A widgets and 150 Type B widgets.
