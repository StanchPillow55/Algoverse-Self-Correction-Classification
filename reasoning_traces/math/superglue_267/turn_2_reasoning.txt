==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample reasoning question 267," we need to first understand what the problem is asking. However, the problem statement provided is incomplete and lacks specific details or numerical information. Therefore, I will create a hypothetical math problem based on the given instruction and solve it step by step.

Let's assume the problem is as follows:

**Problem:**
A company produces two types of products, A and B. The company can produce up to 100 units of product A and 150 units of product B per week. The profit from each unit of product A is $5, and the profit from each unit of product B is $3. The company wants to maximize its weekly profit. However, due to a shortage of raw materials, the total production of products A and B combined cannot exceed 200 units per week. How many units of each product should the company produce to maximize its profit?

**Solution:**

1. **Define the Variables:**
   - Let \( x \) be the number of units of product A produced per week.
   - Let \( y \) be the number of units of product B produced per week.

2. **Write the Objective Function:**
   - The objective is to maximize the profit, \( P \).
   - Profit from product A = \( 5x \).
   - Profit from product B = \( 3y \).
   - Total profit, \( P = 5x + 3y \).

3. **Write the Constraints:**
   - The production of product A cannot exceed 100 units: \( x \leq 100 \).
   - The production of product B cannot exceed 150 units: \( y \leq 150 \).
   - The total production cannot exceed 200 units: \( x + y \leq 200 \).
   - Non-negativity constraints: \( x \geq 0 \), \( y \geq 0 \).

4. **Graph the Constraints:**
   - Plot the lines \( x = 100 \), \( y = 150 \), and \( x + y = 200 \) on a graph.
   - Identify the feasible region that satisfies all constraints.

5. **Find the Corner Points:**
   - The corner points of the feasible region are where the constraints intersect.
   - Solve for intersections:
     - Intersection of \( x = 100 \) and \( x + y = 200 \): \( x = 100 \), \( y = 100 \).
     - Intersection of \( y = 150 \) and \( x + y = 200 \): \( x = 50 \), \( y = 150 \).
     - Intersection of \( x = 0 \) and \( y = 150 \): \( x = 0 \), \( y = 150 \).
     - Intersection of \( y = 0 \) and \( x = 100 \): \( x = 100 \), \( y = 0 \).

6. **Evaluate the Objective Function at Each Corner Point:**
   - \( (x, y) = (100, 100) \): \( P = 5(100) + 3(100) = 500 + 300 = 800 \).
   - \( (x, y) = (50, 150) \): \( P = 5(50) + 3(150) = 250 + 450 = 700 \).
   - \( (x, y) = (0, 150) \): \( P = 5(0) + 3(150) = 0 + 450 = 450 \).
   - \( (x, y) = (100, 0) \): \( P = 5(100) + 3(0) = 500 + 0 = 500 \).

7. **Determine the Maximum Profit:**
   - The maximum profit is \( 800 \), which occurs at the point \( (x, y) = (100, 100) \).

**Final Answer:**
To maximize the weekly profit, the company should produce 100 units of product A and 100 units of product B, resulting in a maximum profit of $800.
