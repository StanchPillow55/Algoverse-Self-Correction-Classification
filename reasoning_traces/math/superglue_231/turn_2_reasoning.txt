==================================================

To solve a math problem effectively, it's important to understand the problem, identify what is being asked, and then work through it step by step. However, the question you've provided, "Sample reasoning question 231," lacks specific details or numerical information to work with. Therefore, I will illustrate a general approach to solving a math problem by creating a sample problem and solving it.

### Sample Problem:
Let's assume the problem is as follows:

**Problem:** A farmer has a rectangular field that is 150 meters long and 100 meters wide. He wants to build a fence around the entire field. Calculate the total length of the fence needed.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We need to find the total length of the fence required to enclose a rectangular field.
   - The dimensions of the field are given: length = 150 meters, width = 100 meters.

2. **Identify What is Being Asked:**
   - We are asked to calculate the perimeter of the rectangle, which will give us the total length of the fence.

3. **Recall the Formula for Perimeter of a Rectangle:**
   - The perimeter \( P \) of a rectangle is given by the formula:
     \[
     P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width})
     \]

4. **Substitute the Given Values into the Formula:**
   - Length = 150 meters
   - Width = 100 meters
   - Substitute these values into the formula:
     \[
     P = 2 \times (150 + 100)
     \]

5. **Perform the Calculations:**
   - First, calculate the sum inside the parentheses:
     \[
     150 + 100 = 250
     \]
   - Then, multiply by 2 to find the perimeter:
     \[
     P = 2 \times 250 = 500
     \]

6. **State the Final Answer:**
   - The total length of the fence needed is 500 meters.

### Conclusion:
By following these steps, we calculated that the farmer needs 500 meters of fencing to enclose the rectangular field. This approach can be applied to a variety of similar problems by identifying the relevant formulas and substituting the given values.
