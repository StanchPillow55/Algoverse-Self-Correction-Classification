==================================================

To solve the problem effectively, I need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 231" entails. However, since the problem statement is not provided, I will demonstrate a general approach to solving a math problem by using a hypothetical example. Let's assume the problem is as follows:

**Problem:**
A company produces two types of widgets: Type A and Type B. The company can produce a maximum of 100 widgets per day. The profit from selling one Type A widget is $3, and the profit from selling one Type B widget is $5. The company wants to maximize its profit. If the company must produce at least 20 Type A widgets and at least 10 Type B widgets per day, how many of each type should the company produce to maximize profit?

**Solution:**

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( x \) be the number of Type A widgets produced per day.
   - Let \( y \) be the number of Type B widgets produced per day.

2. **Set Up the Objective Function:**
   - The profit function \( P \) is given by:
     \[
     P = 3x + 5y
     \]
   - We want to maximize \( P \).

3. **Set Up the Constraints:**
   - The total production constraint is:
     \[
     x + y \leq 100
     \]
   - The minimum production constraints are:
     \[
     x \geq 20
     \]
     \[
     y \geq 10
     \]

4. **Graph the Constraints:**
   - Plot the line \( x + y = 100 \).
   - Shade the region below this line to represent \( x + y \leq 100 \).
   - Plot the vertical line \( x = 20 \) and shade to the right.
   - Plot the horizontal line \( y = 10 \) and shade above it.
   - The feasible region is the intersection of these shaded areas.

5. **Identify the Vertices of the Feasible Region:**
   - The vertices of the feasible region are the points where the constraint lines intersect:
     - Intersection of \( x = 20 \) and \( y = 10 \): \( (20, 10) \)
     - Intersection of \( x = 20 \) and \( x + y = 100 \): \( (20, 80) \)
     - Intersection of \( y = 10 \) and \( x + y = 100 \): \( (90, 10) \)

6. **Evaluate the Objective Function at Each Vertex:**
   - \( P(20, 10) = 3(20) + 5(10) = 60 + 50 = 110 \)
   - \( P(20, 80) = 3(20) + 5(80) = 60 + 400 = 460 \)
   - \( P(90, 10) = 3(90) + 5(10) = 270 + 50 = 320 \)

7. **Determine the Maximum Profit:**
   - The maximum profit is \( 460 \), which occurs at the point \( (20, 80) \).

**Final Answer:**
To maximize profit, the company should produce 20 Type A widgets and 80 Type B widgets per day, resulting in a maximum profit of $460.
