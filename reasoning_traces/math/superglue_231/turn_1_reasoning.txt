==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 231" entails. Since the problem statement is not explicitly provided, I'll demonstrate a general approach to solving a typical math problem by breaking down the steps involved in reasoning through a problem.

Let's assume "Sample reasoning question 231" is a typical math problem involving algebra. Here's how we might approach it:

### Step 1: Understand the Problem
First, we need to identify what the problem is asking. Since we don't have a specific problem, let's assume it's a basic algebra problem, such as solving for \( x \) in the equation:

\[ 2x + 3 = 11 \]

### Step 2: Identify What is Given
In the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \), we are given:
- A linear equation with one variable, \( x \).

### Step 3: Determine What Needs to be Found
We need to solve for the variable \( x \).

### Step 4: Develop a Plan
To solve for \( x \), we need to isolate \( x \) on one side of the equation. This involves:
1. Subtracting 3 from both sides of the equation to eliminate the constant term on the left side.
2. Dividing both sides by 2 to solve for \( x \).

### Step 5: Execute the Plan
Let's perform the calculations step by step:

1. **Subtract 3 from both sides:**

   \[
   2x + 3 - 3 = 11 - 3
   \]

   Simplifying both sides gives:

   \[
   2x = 8
   \]

2. **Divide both sides by 2:**

   \[
   \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{8}{2}
   \]

   Simplifying both sides gives:

   \[
   x = 4
   \]

### Step 6: Verify the Solution
To ensure our solution is correct, substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation:

\[ 
2(4) + 3 = 11 
\]

Simplifying the left side:

\[ 
8 + 3 = 11 
\]

Since both sides of the equation are equal, our solution \( x = 4 \) is verified.

### Step 7: State the Final Answer
The solution to the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \) is:

\[ 
x = 4 
\]

This is a demonstration of how to approach a math problem systematically, even when the specific problem is not provided. If "Sample reasoning question 231" refers to a different type of problem, the same structured approach can be adapted accordingly.
