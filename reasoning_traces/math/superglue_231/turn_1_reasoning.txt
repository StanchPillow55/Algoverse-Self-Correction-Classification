==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 231" entails. Since the question is not explicitly provided, I'll assume it's a typical math problem that requires logical reasoning and step-by-step calculations. Let's create a hypothetical problem and solve it.

**Hypothetical Problem:**

A store sells apples and oranges. An apple costs $0.50, and an orange costs $0.75. If a customer buys a total of 20 fruits and spends $12.00, how many apples and how many oranges did the customer buy?

**Step-by-step Solution:**

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( x \) be the number of apples.
   - Let \( y \) be the number of oranges.

2. **Set Up Equations:**
   - The total number of fruits is 20: 
     \[
     x + y = 20
     \]
   - The total cost is $12.00:
     \[
     0.50x + 0.75y = 12.00
     \]

3. **Solve the System of Equations:**

   From the first equation, express \( y \) in terms of \( x \):
   \[
   y = 20 - x
   \]

   Substitute \( y = 20 - x \) into the second equation:
   \[
   0.50x + 0.75(20 - x) = 12.00
   \]

   Simplify and solve for \( x \):
   \[
   0.50x + 15 - 0.75x = 12.00
   \]
   \[
   -0.25x + 15 = 12.00
   \]
   \[
   -0.25x = 12.00 - 15
   \]
   \[
   -0.25x = -3.00
   \]
   \[
   x = \frac{-3.00}{-0.25}
   \]
   \[
   x = 12
   \]

   Substitute \( x = 12 \) back into the equation for \( y \):
   \[
   y = 20 - 12
   \]
   \[
   y = 8
   \]

4. **Verify the Solution:**

   Check the total number of fruits:
   \[
   x + y = 12 + 8 = 20
   \]

   Check the total cost:
   \[
   0.50(12) + 0.75(8) = 6.00 + 6.00 = 12.00
   \]

   Both conditions are satisfied.

**Final Answer:**

The customer bought 12 apples and 8 oranges.
