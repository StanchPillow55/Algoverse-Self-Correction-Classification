Question ID: 229
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem step by step, we will break it down into manageable parts.

1. **Total Cable Length**: Jan starts with 1000 feet of cable.

2. **Splitting into Sections**: She splits the cable into 25-foot sections. To find out how many sections she has, we divide the total length of the cable by the length of each section:
   \[
   \text{Number of sections} = \frac{1000 \text{ feet}}{25 \text{ feet/section}} = 40 \text{ sections}
   \]

3. **Giving Cable to a Friend**: Jan gives away \( \frac{1}{4} \) of the total cable to a friend. To find out how much cable that is, we calculate:
   \[
   \text{Cable given to friend} = \frac{1}{4} \times 1000 \text{ feet} = 250 \text{ feet}
   \]

4. **Cable Remaining After Giving to Friend**: We now subtract the amount given to her friend from the total amount she started with:
   \[
   \text{Cable remaining} = 1000 \text{ feet} - 250 \text{ feet} = 750 \text{ feet}
   \]

5. **Storing Half of the Remaining Cable**: Jan puts half of the remaining cable into storage. To find out how much she stores, we calculate:
   \[
   \text{Cable in storage} = \frac{1}{2} \times 750 \text{ feet} = 375 \text{ feet}
   \]

6. **Cable Kept on Hand**: Finally, to find out how much cable Jan keeps on hand, we subtract the amount she put in storage from the remaining cable:
   \[
   \text{Cable kept on hand} = 750 \text{ feet} - 375 \text{ feet} = 375 \text{ feet}
   \]

Thus, the amount of cable Jan keeps on hand is:
\[
\boxed{375 \text{ feet}}
\]
