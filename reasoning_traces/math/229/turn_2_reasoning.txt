==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to follow the steps outlined in the question and perform the calculations accordingly. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the Number of 25-foot Sections:**
   Jan buys 1000 feet of cable and splits it into 25-foot sections. To find out how many sections she has, we divide the total length of the cable by the length of each section:
   \[
   \text{Number of sections} = \frac{1000 \text{ feet}}{25 \text{ feet/section}} = 40 \text{ sections}
   \]

2. **Calculate the Number of Sections Given to a Friend:**
   Jan gives 1/4 of these sections to a friend. To find out how many sections she gives away, we multiply the total number of sections by 1/4:
   \[
   \text{Sections given to a friend} = \frac{1}{4} \times 40 = 10 \text{ sections}
   \]

3. **Determine the Remaining Sections:**
   After giving away some sections to her friend, we need to calculate how many sections are left:
   \[
   \text{Remaining sections} = 40 - 10 = 30 \text{ sections}
   \]

4. **Calculate the Number of Sections Put in Storage:**
   Jan puts half of the remaining sections in storage. To find out how many sections she puts in storage, we take half of the remaining sections:
   \[
   \text{Sections in storage} = \frac{1}{2} \times 30 = 15 \text{ sections}
   \]

5. **Determine the Number of Sections Kept on Hand:**
   Finally, we calculate how many sections Jan keeps on hand by subtracting the sections put in storage from the remaining sections:
   \[
   \text{Sections kept on hand} = 30 - 15 = 15 \text{ sections}
   \]

6. **Convert Sections Back to Feet:**
   Since each section is 25 feet long, we convert the sections Jan keeps on hand back to feet:
   \[
   \text{Feet kept on hand} = 15 \text{ sections} \times 25 \text{ feet/section} = 375 \text{ feet}
   \]

Thus, the final answer is that Jan keeps **375 feet** of cable on hand.
