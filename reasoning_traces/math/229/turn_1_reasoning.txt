Question ID: 229
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem step by step, we will break down each part of the process that Jan goes through with the cable.

1. **Total Cable Length**: Jan starts with 1000 feet of cable.

2. **Splitting into Sections**: She splits the cable into 25-foot sections. To find out how many sections she has, we divide the total length of the cable by the length of each section:
   \[
   \text{Number of sections} = \frac{1000 \text{ feet}}{25 \text{ feet/section}} = 40 \text{ sections}
   \]

3. **Giving to a Friend**: Jan gives away \( \frac{1}{4} \) of the total cable to a friend. To find out how much cable she gives away, we calculate:
   \[
   \text{Cable given to friend} = \frac{1}{4} \times 1000 \text{ feet} = 250 \text{ feet}
   \]

4. **Cable Remaining**: After giving away 250 feet, we need to find out how much cable Jan has left:
   \[
   \text{Cable remaining} = 1000 \text{ feet} - 250 \text{ feet} = 750 \text{ feet}
   \]

5. **Storing Half of the Remaining Cable**: Jan puts half of the remaining cable in storage. To find out how much she puts in storage, we calculate:
   \[
   \text{Cable in storage} = \frac{1}{2} \times 750 \text{ feet} = 375 \text{ feet}
   \]

6. **Cable Kept on Hand**: To find out how much cable Jan keeps on hand, we subtract the amount she put in storage from the remaining cable:
   \[
   \text{Cable kept on hand} = 750 \text{ feet} - 375 \text{ feet} = 375 \text{ feet}
   \]

Thus, after going through all the steps, we find that Jan keeps **375 feet** of cable on hand.

**Final Answer**: Jan keeps 375 feet of cable on hand.
