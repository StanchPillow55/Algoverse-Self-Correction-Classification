==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to follow the steps outlined in the question and perform calculations at each stage. Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the Number of 25-foot Sections:**
   Jan has 1000 feet of cable and she splits it into 25-foot sections. To find out how many sections she has, we divide the total length of the cable by the length of each section:

   \[
   \text{Number of sections} = \frac{1000 \text{ feet}}{25 \text{ feet/section}} = 40 \text{ sections}
   \]

2. **Calculate the Number of Sections Given to a Friend:**
   Jan gives 1/4 of the sections to a friend. To find out how many sections this is, we multiply the total number of sections by 1/4:

   \[
   \text{Sections given to friend} = \frac{1}{4} \times 40 = 10 \text{ sections}
   \]

3. **Calculate the Remaining Sections After Giving to a Friend:**
   After giving 10 sections to a friend, we subtract this from the total number of sections to find out how many sections are left:

   \[
   \text{Remaining sections} = 40 - 10 = 30 \text{ sections}
   \]

4. **Determine the Number of Sections Put in Storage:**
   Jan puts half of the remaining sections in storage. To find out how many sections this is, we divide the remaining sections by 2:

   \[
   \text{Sections in storage} = \frac{30}{2} = 15 \text{ sections}
   \]

5. **Calculate the Number of Sections Jan Keeps on Hand:**
   Finally, we subtract the number of sections put in storage from the remaining sections to find out how many sections Jan keeps on hand:

   \[
   \text{Sections kept on hand} = 30 - 15 = 15 \text{ sections}
   \]

6. **Convert Sections Back to Feet:**
   Each section is 25 feet long, so we multiply the number of sections Jan keeps on hand by the length of each section to find out how many feet of cable she keeps:

   \[
   \text{Feet kept on hand} = 15 \text{ sections} \times 25 \text{ feet/section} = 375 \text{ feet}
   \]

Therefore, Jan keeps 375 feet of cable on hand.

**Final Answer: 375 feet**
