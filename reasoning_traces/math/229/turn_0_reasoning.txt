To solve this problem, we need to follow the steps outlined in the question and perform calculations accordingly. Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the number of 25-foot sections:**
   Jan starts with 1000 feet of cable and splits it into 25-foot sections. To find out how many sections she has, we divide the total length of the cable by the length of each section:

   \[
   \text{Number of sections} = \frac{1000 \text{ feet}}{25 \text{ feet/section}} = 40 \text{ sections}
   \]

2. **Calculate the number of sections given to a friend:**
   Jan gives 1/4 of the sections to a friend. To find out how many sections she gives away, we calculate 1/4 of 40:

   \[
   \text{Sections given to a friend} = \frac{1}{4} \times 40 = 10 \text{ sections}
   \]

3. **Determine the number of sections remaining after giving to a friend:**
   After giving away 10 sections, we subtract this from the original 40 sections to find out how many sections are left:

   \[
   \text{Sections remaining} = 40 - 10 = 30 \text{ sections}
   \]

4. **Calculate the number of sections put in storage:**
   Jan puts half of the remaining sections in storage. To find out how many sections she puts in storage, we calculate half of 30:

   \[
   \text{Sections in storage} = \frac{1}{2} \times 30 = 15 \text{ sections}
   \]

5. **Determine the number of sections Jan keeps on hand:**
   Finally, to find out how many sections Jan keeps on hand, we subtract the number of sections put in storage from the remaining sections:

   \[
   \text{Sections kept on hand} = 30 - 15 = 15 \text{ sections}
   \]

6. **Convert sections back to feet:**
   Since each section is 25 feet long, we convert the number of sections Jan keeps on hand back to feet:

   \[
   \text{Feet kept on hand} = 15 \text{ sections} \times 25 \text{ feet/section} = 375 \text{ feet}
   \]

Therefore, the final answer is that Jan keeps 375 feet of cable on hand.
