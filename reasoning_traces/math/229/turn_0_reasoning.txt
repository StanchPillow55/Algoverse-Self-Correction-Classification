==================================================

To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the number of 25-foot sections Jan can create from 1000 feet of cable.**
   \[
   \text{Number of sections} = \frac{1000 \text{ feet}}{25 \text{ feet/section}} = 40 \text{ sections}
   \]

2. **Calculate how much cable Jan gives to her friend.**
   Jan gives away \( \frac{1}{4} \) of the total cable she has:
   \[
   \text{Cable given to friend} = \frac{1}{4} \times 1000 \text{ feet} = 250 \text{ feet}
   \]

3. **Determine how much cable Jan has left after giving some to her friend.**
   \[
   \text{Cable left} = 1000 \text{ feet} - 250 \text{ feet} = 750 \text{ feet}
   \]

4. **Calculate how much cable Jan puts in storage.**
   Jan puts half of the remaining cable in storage:
   \[
   \text{Cable in storage} = \frac{1}{2} \times 750 \text{ feet} = 375 \text{ feet}
   \]

5. **Determine how much cable Jan keeps on hand.**
   To find out how much cable Jan keeps on hand, we subtract the amount she put in storage from the amount she has left after giving some to her friend:
   \[
   \text{Cable kept on hand} = 750 \text{ feet} - 375 \text{ feet} = 375 \text{ feet}
   \]

Finally, the amount of cable Jan keeps on hand is:
\[
\boxed{375 \text{ feet}}
\]
