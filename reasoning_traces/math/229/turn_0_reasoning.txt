==================================================

To solve the problem step by step, we will start by determining how many watermelons were ready for harvest after the first two months, and then how many were ready after the subsequent two weeks.

1. **Initial Watermelons**: The farm produced a total of 120 baby watermelons.

2. **Watermelons Ready After Two Months**:
   - Ashlyn found that 30% of the watermelons were ready for harvest.
   - To find out how many watermelons that is, we calculate:
     \[
     \text{Watermelons ready} = 30\% \times 120 = 0.30 \times 120 = 36
     \]
   - Therefore, Ashlyn took home 36 watermelons.

3. **Remaining Watermelons**:
   - After Ashlyn took 36 watermelons, the number of remaining watermelons is:
     \[
     \text{Remaining watermelons} = 120 - 36 = 84
     \]

4. **Watermelons Ready After Two More Weeks**:
   - Two weeks later, Ashlyn found that \( \frac{3}{4} \) of the remaining watermelons were ready for harvest.
   - To find out how many watermelons that is, we calculate:
     \[
     \text{Watermelons ready} = \frac{3}{4} \times 84 = 63
     \]

5. **Watermelons Not Ready After Two Weeks**:
   - To find out how many watermelons were not ready for harvest after the two weeks, we subtract the number of watermelons that were ready from the remaining watermelons:
     \[
     \text{Watermelons not ready} = 84 - 63 = 21
     \]

Thus, the number of watermelons that were not ready to be harvested after the two weeks is \( \boxed{21} \).
