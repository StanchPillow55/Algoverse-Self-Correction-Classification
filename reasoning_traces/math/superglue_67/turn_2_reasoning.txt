==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 67" refers to. Since the problem statement is not explicitly given, I'll assume that this is a placeholder for a typical math problem. Let's create a hypothetical math problem and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**

A train travels from City A to City B, a distance of 300 miles. The train travels at a constant speed of 60 miles per hour. How long does it take for the train to reach City B from City A?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We need to find the time it takes for the train to travel from City A to City B.
   - We are given the distance (300 miles) and the speed of the train (60 miles per hour).

2. **Identify the Formula:**
   - The formula to calculate time when distance and speed are known is:
     \[
     \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}}
     \]

3. **Substitute the Known Values:**
   - Distance = 300 miles
   - Speed = 60 miles per hour
   - Substitute these values into the formula:
     \[
     \text{Time} = \frac{300 \text{ miles}}{60 \text{ miles per hour}}
     \]

4. **Perform the Calculation:**
   - Divide 300 by 60:
     \[
     \text{Time} = \frac{300}{60} = 5 \text{ hours}
     \]

5. **Verify the Solution:**
   - To ensure the calculation is correct, consider the units:
     - The units for distance (miles) divided by the units for speed (miles per hour) result in hours, which is the correct unit for time.
   - Recalculate to double-check:
     \[
     \frac{300}{60} = 5
     \]
   - The calculation is consistent and correct.

6. **State the Final Answer:**
   - The train takes 5 hours to travel from City A to City B.

**Final Answer:**
The train takes 5 hours to reach City B from City A.
