Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, I need more specific information about "Sample reasoning question 67." Since the question is not provided, I'll demonstrate how to approach a generic math problem step by step. If you have a specific problem in mind, please provide the details.

Let's consider a sample math problem:

**Problem:** Solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).

**Step 1: Understand the Problem**
The goal is to find the value of \( x \) that makes the equation true.

**Step 2: Isolate the Variable**
To solve for \( x \), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We start with the equation:
\[ 2x + 3 = 11 \]

**Step 3: Eliminate the Constant Term**
Subtract 3 from both sides to eliminate the constant term on the left side:
\[ 2x + 3 - 3 = 11 - 3 \]
\[ 2x = 8 \]

**Step 4: Solve for the Variable**
Now, divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( x \):
\[ \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{8}{2} \]
\[ x = 4 \]

**Step 5: Verify the Solution**
Substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation to verify:
\[ 2(4) + 3 = 11 \]
\[ 8 + 3 = 11 \]
\[ 11 = 11 \]

The left side equals the right side, confirming that our solution is correct.

**Final Answer:**
The solution to the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \) is \( x = 4 \).

If you have a specific problem or question number in mind, please provide the details, and I can work through that problem specifically.
