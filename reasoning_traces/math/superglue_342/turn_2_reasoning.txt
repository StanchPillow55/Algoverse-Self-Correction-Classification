==================================================

To solve the problem, we first need to understand what "Sample reasoning question 342" refers to. Since the problem statement doesn't provide specific details about the question, I'll demonstrate a general approach to solving a reasoning-based math problem. 

Let's assume "Sample reasoning question 342" involves a typical math reasoning problem, such as a number pattern or a logical deduction problem. I'll create a hypothetical problem and solve it step-by-step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**
Consider the sequence: 2, 4, 8, 16, ... What is the 10th term in this sequence?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Identify the Pattern:**
   - Look at the sequence: 2, 4, 8, 16, ...
   - Notice that each term is obtained by multiplying the previous term by 2.
   - This is a geometric sequence where each term is twice the previous term.

2. **Determine the Formula:**
   - The first term \( a_1 = 2 \).
   - The common ratio \( r = 2 \).
   - The formula for the nth term of a geometric sequence is given by:
     \[
     a_n = a_1 \times r^{(n-1)}
     \]

3. **Calculate the 10th Term:**
   - Substitute the known values into the formula to find the 10th term (\( a_{10} \)):
     \[
     a_{10} = 2 \times 2^{(10-1)}
     \]
     \[
     a_{10} = 2 \times 2^9
     \]
     \[
     a_{10} = 2 \times 512
     \]
     \[
     a_{10} = 1024
     \]

4. **Verify the Calculation:**
   - Double-check the calculation of \( 2^9 \):
     \[
     2^9 = 512
     \]
   - Multiply by 2:
     \[
     2 \times 512 = 1024
     \]

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The 10th term in the sequence is 1024.

**Final Answer:**
The 10th term in the sequence is 1024.

This approach demonstrates a structured method to solve a reasoning-based math problem by identifying patterns, deriving formulas, and performing calculations. If you have a specific problem in mind, please provide more details, and I can tailor the solution to that problem.
