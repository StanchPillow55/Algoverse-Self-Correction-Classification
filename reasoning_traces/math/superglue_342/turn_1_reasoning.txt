==================================================

To solve the problem effectively, let's first understand what is being asked. The problem statement is "Sample reasoning question 342." However, this does not provide any specific mathematical problem or context to work with. It seems like a placeholder or an incomplete question. 

To proceed, let's assume that "Sample reasoning question 342" refers to a generic math problem that involves reasoning skills. Since no specific details are given, I'll create a hypothetical problem and solve it step-by-step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**
Let's assume "Sample reasoning question 342" is a problem about finding the sum of the first 342 natural numbers.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   We need to find the sum of the first 342 natural numbers. Natural numbers are positive integers starting from 1.

2. **Formula for the Sum of Natural Numbers:**
   The sum \( S \) of the first \( n \) natural numbers is given by the formula:
   \[
   S = \frac{n(n + 1)}{2}
   \]
   where \( n \) is the number of terms.

3. **Substitute the Given Value:**
   Here, \( n = 342 \). Substitute this into the formula:
   \[
   S = \frac{342 \times (342 + 1)}{2}
   \]

4. **Calculate the Expression:**
   First, calculate \( 342 + 1 \):
   \[
   342 + 1 = 343
   \]

   Next, calculate \( 342 \times 343 \):
   \[
   342 \times 343 = 117306
   \]

   Finally, divide by 2 to find the sum:
   \[
   S = \frac{117306}{2} = 58653
   \]

5. **Conclusion:**
   The sum of the first 342 natural numbers is 58,653.

**Final Answer:**
The sum of the first 342 natural numbers is 58,653.
