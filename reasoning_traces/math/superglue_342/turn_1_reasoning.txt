Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 342" refers to. However, since the question is not explicitly stated, I'll demonstrate a general approach to solving a reasoning-based math problem by creating a hypothetical problem and solving it step-by-step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**
A train travels from City A to City B, a distance of 300 miles. The train travels at a constant speed of 60 miles per hour. After reaching City B, it immediately returns to City A at a speed of 40 miles per hour. What is the total time taken for the round trip?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - The train travels from City A to City B and back to City A.
   - The distance between City A and City B is 300 miles.
   - The speed from City A to City B is 60 miles per hour.
   - The speed from City B back to City A is 40 miles per hour.
   - We need to find the total time taken for the entire journey.

2. **Calculate the Time for Each Leg of the Journey:**
   - **City A to City B:**
     - Distance = 300 miles
     - Speed = 60 miles per hour
     - Time = Distance / Speed = 300 miles / 60 miles per hour = 5 hours

   - **City B to City A:**
     - Distance = 300 miles
     - Speed = 40 miles per hour
     - Time = Distance / Speed = 300 miles / 40 miles per hour = 7.5 hours

3. **Calculate the Total Time for the Round Trip:**
   - Total Time = Time from City A to City B + Time from City B to City A
   - Total Time = 5 hours + 7.5 hours = 12.5 hours

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The total time taken for the round trip is 12.5 hours.

By following these steps, we have carefully reasoned through the problem, performed the necessary calculations, and arrived at the final answer. If you have a specific problem or need further assistance, please provide more details, and I'll be happy to help!
