Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we first need to understand what "Sample math problem 53" refers to. Since the problem itself is not provided, I will assume a generic math problem that involves multiple steps of reasoning and calculation. Let's consider a hypothetical problem involving algebra and arithmetic:

**Problem:**
Solve for \( x \) in the equation: 
\[ 3x + 5 = 2x + 15 \]

**Step-by-step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Equation:**
   The equation given is a linear equation in one variable, \( x \). Our goal is to isolate \( x \) on one side of the equation to find its value.

2. **Simplify the Equation:**
   Start by getting all terms involving \( x \) on one side of the equation and constant terms on the other side. We can do this by subtracting \( 2x \) from both sides:
   \[
   3x + 5 - 2x = 2x + 15 - 2x
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   x + 5 = 15
   \]

3. **Isolate \( x \):**
   Next, we need to isolate \( x \) by removing the constant term on the left side. Subtract 5 from both sides:
   \[
   x + 5 - 5 = 15 - 5
   \]
   Simplifying gives:
   \[
   x = 10
   \]

4. **Verify the Solution:**
   Substitute \( x = 10 \) back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies the equation:
   \[
   3(10) + 5 = 2(10) + 15
   \]
   Calculate both sides:
   \[
   30 + 5 = 20 + 15
   \]
   \[
   35 = 35
   \]
   Since both sides are equal, our solution \( x = 10 \) is correct.

**Final Answer:**
The solution to the equation \( 3x + 5 = 2x + 15 \) is \( x = 10 \).
