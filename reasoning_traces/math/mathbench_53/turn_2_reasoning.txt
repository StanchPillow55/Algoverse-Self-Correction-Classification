==================================================

To solve "Sample math problem 53," we first need to understand what the problem is asking. Since the problem is not explicitly stated, let's assume it involves a typical math problem scenario. For this example, let's consider a problem involving basic algebra:

**Problem Statement:**
Solve for \( x \) in the equation: \( 2x + 5 = 13 \).

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Equation:**
   The equation given is \( 2x + 5 = 13 \). This is a linear equation in one variable, \( x \).

2. **Isolate the Variable:**
   To solve for \( x \), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We start by eliminating the constant term on the left side.

   \[
   2x + 5 = 13
   \]

   Subtract 5 from both sides to get rid of the constant term on the left:

   \[
   2x + 5 - 5 = 13 - 5
   \]

   Simplifying both sides gives:

   \[
   2x = 8
   \]

3. **Solve for \( x \):**
   Now, divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( x \):

   \[
   \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{8}{2}
   \]

   Simplifying both sides gives:

   \[
   x = 4
   \]

4. **Verify the Solution:**
   Substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies the equation:

   \[
   2(4) + 5 = 13
   \]

   Calculate the left side:

   \[
   8 + 5 = 13
   \]

   Since both sides of the equation are equal, our solution \( x = 4 \) is correct.

**Final Answer:**
The solution to the equation \( 2x + 5 = 13 \) is \( x = 4 \).
