==================================================

To determine how many kids got into the movie, we need to calculate how many kids were denied entry from each high school and then subtract those numbers from the total number of kids from each school.

1. **Riverside High**:
   - Total kids: 120
   - Percentage denied: 20%
   - Number denied: 
     \[
     20\% \text{ of } 120 = 0.20 \times 120 = 24
     \]
   - Number allowed in:
     \[
     120 - 24 = 96
     \]

2. **West Side High**:
   - Total kids: 90
   - Percentage denied: 70%
   - Number denied:
     \[
     70\% \text{ of } 90 = 0.70 \times 90 = 63
     \]
   - Number allowed in:
     \[
     90 - 63 = 27
     \]

3. **Mountaintop High**:
   - Total kids: 50
   - Percentage denied: 50% (which is half)
   - Number denied:
     \[
     50\% \text{ of } 50 = 0.50 \times 50 = 25
     \]
   - Number allowed in:
     \[
     50 - 25 = 25
     \]

Now, we will sum the number of kids allowed in from all three schools:

- Kids allowed from Riverside High: 96
- Kids allowed from West Side High: 27
- Kids allowed from Mountaintop High: 25

Total number of kids allowed in:
\[
96 + 27 + 25 = 148
\]

Thus, the final answer is that **148 kids got into the movie**.
