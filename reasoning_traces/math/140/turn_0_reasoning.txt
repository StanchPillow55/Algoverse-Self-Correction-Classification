To solve this problem, we need to determine how many kids from each high school were allowed into the movie and then sum those numbers to find the total number of kids who got in.

### Step 1: Calculate the number of kids from Riverside High who got in.

- Total kids from Riverside High: 120
- Percentage denied: 20%

First, calculate the number of kids denied entry from Riverside High:
\[ \text{Number denied} = 0.20 \times 120 = 24 \]

Now, calculate the number of kids who got in:
\[ \text{Number who got in} = 120 - 24 = 96 \]

### Step 2: Calculate the number of kids from West Side High who got in.

- Total kids from West Side High: 90
- Percentage denied: 70%

First, calculate the number of kids denied entry from West Side High:
\[ \text{Number denied} = 0.70 \times 90 = 63 \]

Now, calculate the number of kids who got in:
\[ \text{Number who got in} = 90 - 63 = 27 \]

### Step 3: Calculate the number of kids from Mountaintop High who got in.

- Total kids from Mountaintop High: 50
- Percentage denied: 50% (or half)

First, calculate the number of kids denied entry from Mountaintop High:
\[ \text{Number denied} = 0.50 \times 50 = 25 \]

Now, calculate the number of kids who got in:
\[ \text{Number who got in} = 50 - 25 = 25 \]

### Step 4: Calculate the total number of kids who got into the movie.

Now, sum the number of kids who got in from each school:
\[ \text{Total who got in} = 96 + 27 + 25 = 148 \]

### Final Answer:
The total number of kids who got into the movie is 148.
