To find out how many square feet the quilt will be, we need to calculate the total area of fabric that Octavia will use from the small, medium, and large t-shirts.

1. **Calculate the area from small t-shirts:**
   - Each small t-shirt has an area of 3 square feet.
   - Octavia uses 11 small t-shirts.
   - The total area from small t-shirts is calculated as follows:
     \[
     \text{Area from small t-shirts} = \text{Number of small t-shirts} \times \text{Area of each small t-shirt}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Area from small t-shirts} = 11 \times 3 = 33 \text{ square feet}
     \]

2. **Calculate the area from medium t-shirts:**
   - Each medium t-shirt has an area of 4 square feet.
   - Octavia uses 8 medium t-shirts.
   - The total area from medium t-shirts is calculated as follows:
     \[
     \text{Area from medium t-shirts} = \text{Number of medium t-shirts} \times \text{Area of each medium t-shirt}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Area from medium t-shirts} = 8 \times 4 = 32 \text{ square feet}
     \]

3. **Calculate the area from large t-shirts:**
   - Each large t-shirt has an area of 6 square feet.
   - Octavia uses 6 large t-shirts.
   - The total area from large t-shirts is calculated as follows:
     \[
     \text{Area from large t-shirts} = \text{Number of large t-shirts} \times \text{Area of each large t-shirt}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Area from large t-shirts} = 6 \times 6 = 36 \text{ square feet}
     \]

4. **Calculate the total area of the quilt:**
   - Now, we add the areas from all three types of t-shirts to find the total area of the quilt.
   \[
   \text{Total area} = \text{Area from small t-shirts} + \text{Area from medium t-shirts} + \text{Area from large t-shirts}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total area} = 33 + 32 + 36
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total area} = 101 \text{ square feet}
   \]

Thus, the total area of the quilt that Octavia will make is **101 square feet**. 

Final answer: **101 square feet**.
