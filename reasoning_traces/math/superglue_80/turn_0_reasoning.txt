==================================================

It seems like there might be some confusion or missing information in your request. The phrase "Sample reasoning question 80" doesn't provide enough context or detail for me to solve a specific math problem. However, I can guide you through a general approach to solving math problems and reasoning questions. If you have a specific problem in mind, please provide the details, and I'll be happy to help.

Here's a general approach to solving math problems:

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - Read the problem carefully to understand what is being asked.
   - Identify the key information given in the problem.
   - Determine what you need to find or solve.

2. **Devise a Plan:**
   - Consider different strategies to solve the problem, such as drawing a diagram, creating an equation, or breaking the problem into smaller parts.
   - Choose the strategy that seems most appropriate for the problem.

3. **Carry Out the Plan:**
   - Execute the chosen strategy step by step.
   - Perform calculations carefully, showing all work.
   - Keep track of units and ensure consistency throughout the problem.

4. **Check Your Work:**
   - Review each step to ensure there are no errors in calculations or logic.
   - Verify that the solution makes sense in the context of the problem.
   - If possible, use a different method to check the solution.

5. **State the Final Answer:**
   - Clearly state the final answer, including any units or labels as necessary.

If you provide a specific problem or more details, I can apply this approach to solve it for you.
