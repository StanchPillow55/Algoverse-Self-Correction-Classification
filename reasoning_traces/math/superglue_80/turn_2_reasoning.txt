==================================================

To solve the problem, we first need to understand what "Sample reasoning question 80" refers to. Since there is no specific math problem provided, I will assume this is a placeholder for a typical math problem. Let's create a hypothetical math problem and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**

A rectangle has a length that is 3 times its width. If the perimeter of the rectangle is 80 units, find the dimensions of the rectangle.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We have a rectangle with a length (L) and a width (W).
   - The length is 3 times the width: \( L = 3W \).
   - The perimeter of the rectangle is 80 units.

2. **Recall the Formula for Perimeter:**
   - The perimeter (P) of a rectangle is given by the formula: 
     \[
     P = 2L + 2W
     \]

3. **Substitute the Known Values:**
   - We know the perimeter is 80, so:
     \[
     2L + 2W = 80
     \]

4. **Substitute the Expression for L:**
   - Since \( L = 3W \), substitute this into the perimeter equation:
     \[
     2(3W) + 2W = 80
     \]

5. **Simplify the Equation:**
   - Simplify the terms:
     \[
     6W + 2W = 80
     \]
   - Combine like terms:
     \[
     8W = 80
     \]

6. **Solve for W:**
   - Divide both sides by 8 to solve for W:
     \[
     W = \frac{80}{8} = 10
     \]

7. **Find the Length L:**
   - Use the relationship \( L = 3W \) to find L:
     \[
     L = 3 \times 10 = 30
     \]

8. **Verify the Solution:**
   - Check the perimeter with the found dimensions:
     \[
     2L + 2W = 2(30) + 2(10) = 60 + 20 = 80
     \]
   - The calculated perimeter matches the given perimeter, confirming the solution is correct.

**Final Answer:**

The dimensions of the rectangle are:
- Width (W) = 10 units
- Length (L) = 30 units
