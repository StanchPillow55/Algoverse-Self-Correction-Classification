==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 141," we need to first understand what the problem is asking. However, the problem statement "Sample math problem 141" is not specific enough for us to determine the exact mathematical question or context. It seems like a placeholder or reference to a specific problem that might be found in a textbook or a set of problems.

Since the problem is not explicitly stated, let's consider a hypothetical math problem that might be labeled as "Sample math problem 141" in a typical math context. Let's assume it involves basic algebra, as this is a common topic in math problem sets.

**Hypothetical Problem:**
Solve for \( x \) in the equation:
\[ 2x + 3 = 11 \]

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Equation:**
   The given equation is \( 2x + 3 = 11 \). Our goal is to solve for \( x \).

2. **Isolate the Variable:**
   To isolate \( x \), we need to get rid of the constant term on the left side of the equation. We do this by subtracting 3 from both sides:
   \[
   2x + 3 - 3 = 11 - 3
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   2x = 8
   \]

3. **Solve for \( x \):**
   Now, we need to isolate \( x \) by dividing both sides of the equation by 2:
   \[
   \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{8}{2}
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   x = 4
   \]

4. **Verify the Solution:**
   To ensure our solution is correct, we substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation:
   \[
   2(4) + 3 = 11
   \]
   Simplifying the left side gives:
   \[
   8 + 3 = 11
   \]
   Since both sides of the equation are equal, our solution \( x = 4 \) is verified.

**Final Answer:**
The solution to the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \) is \( x = 4 \).
