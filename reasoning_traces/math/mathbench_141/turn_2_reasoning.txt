==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 141," we need to first understand what the problem is asking. However, the problem statement "Sample math problem 141" is not specific enough for us to determine what the problem actually is. It seems like a placeholder or a reference to a specific problem that isn't provided here.

In order to solve a math problem, we typically need a clear question or set of instructions. For example, a math problem might ask us to solve an equation, find the value of a variable, calculate a probability, or determine a geometric property.

Since we don't have the actual problem details, let's consider a hypothetical math problem that could be labeled as "Sample math problem 141." I'll create a problem and solve it step by step.

### Hypothetical Problem:
**Problem 141:** Solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Understand the Equation:**
   The equation given is \( 2x + 3 = 11 \). Our goal is to solve for \( x \).

2. **Isolate the Variable:**
   To solve for \( x \), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We can do this by performing operations that will leave \( x \) alone on one side.

3. **Subtract 3 from Both Sides:**
   To begin isolating \( x \), subtract 3 from both sides of the equation:
   \[
   2x + 3 - 3 = 11 - 3
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   2x = 8
   \]

4. **Divide Both Sides by 2:**
   Now, divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( x \):
   \[
   \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{8}{2}
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   x = 4
   \]

5. **Verify the Solution:**
   To ensure our solution is correct, substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation:
   \[
   2(4) + 3 = 11
   \]
   Simplifying the left side gives:
   \[
   8 + 3 = 11
   \]
   Since both sides of the equation are equal, our solution is verified.

### Final Answer:
The solution to the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \) is \( x = 4 \).

If you have a specific math problem labeled as "Sample math problem 141," please provide the details, and I can help solve it accordingly.
