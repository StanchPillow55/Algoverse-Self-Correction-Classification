==================================================

To solve the problem, we first need to understand what "Sample math problem 141" entails. Since the problem is not explicitly stated, I will assume a generic math problem and solve it step by step. Let's assume the problem involves solving a quadratic equation, which is a common type of math problem.

**Problem: Solve the quadratic equation \(2x^2 - 4x - 6 = 0\).**

### Step 1: Identify the coefficients
The given quadratic equation is in the standard form \(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\), where:
- \(a = 2\)
- \(b = -4\)
- \(c = -6\)

### Step 2: Calculate the discriminant
The discriminant (\(\Delta\)) of a quadratic equation \(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\) is given by:
\[
\Delta = b^2 - 4ac
\]
Substituting the values of \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\):
\[
\Delta = (-4)^2 - 4 \times 2 \times (-6) = 16 + 48 = 64
\]

### Step 3: Determine the nature of the roots
Since the discriminant \(\Delta = 64\) is greater than zero, the quadratic equation has two distinct real roots.

### Step 4: Use the quadratic formula to find the roots
The quadratic formula is given by:
\[
x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{\Delta}}{2a}
\]
Substituting the values of \(b\), \(\Delta\), and \(a\):
\[
x = \frac{-(-4) \pm \sqrt{64}}{2 \times 2} = \frac{4 \pm 8}{4}
\]

### Step 5: Calculate the two roots
1. **First root:**
   \[
   x_1 = \frac{4 + 8}{4} = \frac{12}{4} = 3
   \]

2. **Second root:**
   \[
   x_2 = \frac{4 - 8}{4} = \frac{-4}{4} = -1
   \]

### Conclusion
The solutions to the quadratic equation \(2x^2 - 4x - 6 = 0\) are \(x = 3\) and \(x = -1\).

**Final Answer:**
The roots of the equation are \(x = 3\) and \(x = -1\).
