==================================================

To determine how many days it will take Prince to sell the meat from Bill's bull, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total amount of meat Prince can sell in one day.**
   - Prince sells 15 kg of meat every hour.
   - He works for 10 hours a day.
   - Therefore, the total amount of meat he sells in one day is calculated as follows:
     \[
     \text{Total meat sold per day} = \text{meat sold per hour} \times \text{hours worked per day}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total meat sold per day} = 15 \, \text{kg/hour} \times 10 \, \text{hours/day} = 150 \, \text{kg/day}
     \]

2. **Determine the total weight of the bull.**
   - The bull weighs 750 kg.

3. **Calculate how many days it will take to sell the entire bull.**
   - To find out how many days it will take to sell 750 kg of meat at a rate of 150 kg per day, we use the following formula:
     \[
     \text{Number of days} = \frac{\text{Total weight of the bull}}{\text{Total meat sold per day}}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Number of days} = \frac{750 \, \text{kg}}{150 \, \text{kg/day}} = 5 \, \text{days}
     \]

Thus, it will take Prince **5 days** to sell the meat from Bill's bull.

Final answer: **5 days**.
