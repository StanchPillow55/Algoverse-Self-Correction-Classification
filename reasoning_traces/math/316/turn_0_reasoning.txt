To find the new selling price of the bicycle after a 15% increase, we can follow these steps:

1. **Identify the original price**: The original selling price of the bicycle is $220.

2. **Calculate the amount of the increase**: To find out how much the price increases by, we need to calculate 15% of the original price. 

   The formula to calculate a percentage is:
   \[
   \text{Percentage Increase} = \left( \text{Original Price} \times \frac{\text{Percentage}}{100} \right)
   \]

   Plugging in the values:
   \[
   \text{Increase} = 220 \times \frac{15}{100}
   \]

   Now, calculate \( \frac{15}{100} \):
   \[
   \frac{15}{100} = 0.15
   \]

   Now, multiply:
   \[
   \text{Increase} = 220 \times 0.15 = 33
   \]

3. **Calculate the new price**: To find the new selling price, we add the increase to the original price:
   \[
   \text{New Price} = \text{Original Price} + \text{Increase}
   \]
   \[
   \text{New Price} = 220 + 33 = 253
   \]

4. **Final answer**: The new selling price of the bicycle after the 15% increase is **$253**.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{253}
\]
