To solve the problem of finding the new selling price of the bicycle after a 15% increase, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Identify the original price of the bicycle.**
   - The original price of the bicycle is given as $220.

2. **Determine the percentage increase.**
   - The price is increased by 15%.

3. **Calculate the amount of the increase.**
   - To find the amount of the increase, we calculate 15% of the original price.
   - The formula to calculate the percentage increase is:
     \[
     \text{Increase} = \left(\frac{\text{Percentage Increase}}{100}\right) \times \text{Original Price}
     \]
   - Substituting the given values:
     \[
     \text{Increase} = \left(\frac{15}{100}\right) \times 220
     \]

4. **Perform the multiplication to find the increase.**
   - First, convert 15% to a decimal by dividing by 100: \(0.15\).
   - Multiply this decimal by the original price:
     \[
     \text{Increase} = 0.15 \times 220 = 33
     \]
   - So, the increase in price is $33.

5. **Calculate the new price.**
   - Add the increase to the original price to find the new price:
     \[
     \text{New Price} = \text{Original Price} + \text{Increase}
     \]
   - Substituting the known values:
     \[
     \text{New Price} = 220 + 33 = 253
     \]

6. **State the final answer.**
   - The new selling price of the bicycle, after a 15% increase, is $253.

Therefore, the final answer is \(\boxed{253}\).
