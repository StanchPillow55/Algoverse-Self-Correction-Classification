==================================================

To solve the problem, we will break it down into steps:

1. **Determine the number of marbles Solomon bought from Johanna.**
   Solomon bought 20 marbles from Johanna.

2. **Calculate the total number of marbles in the store before his father's contribution.**
   The store initially had 50 marbles. After Solomon added the 20 marbles he bought, the total number of marbles in the store becomes:
   \[
   \text{Total marbles after buying} = \text{Initial marbles} + \text{Marbles bought from Johanna}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total marbles after buying} = 50 + 20 = 70
   \]

3. **Calculate how many marbles Solomon's father gave him.**
   Solomon's father gave him \( \frac{2}{5} \) times as many marbles as he bought from Johanna. Since Solomon bought 20 marbles, we calculate:
   \[
   \text{Marbles from father} = \frac{2}{5} \times 20
   \]
   \[
   \text{Marbles from father} = \frac{40}{5} = 8
   \]

4. **Add the marbles from his father to the total in the store.**
   Now we add the 8 marbles from his father to the 70 marbles already in the store:
   \[
   \text{Total marbles after father's contribution} = 70 + 8 = 78
   \]

5. **Calculate the total weight of the marbles.**
   Each marble weighs 2 kg. Therefore, the total weight of the marbles can be calculated as follows:
   \[
   \text{Total weight} = \text{Total number of marbles} \times \text{Weight per marble}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total weight} = 78 \times 2 = 156 \text{ kg}
   \]

Thus, the total weight of the marbles Solomon has in the store is \( \boxed{156} \) kg.
