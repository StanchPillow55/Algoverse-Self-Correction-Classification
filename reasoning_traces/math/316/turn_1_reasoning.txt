Question ID: 316
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we will break it down into several steps:

1. **Determine the number of marbles Solomon bought from Johanna.**
   Solomon bought 20 marbles from Johanna.

2. **Calculate the total number of marbles in the store after Solomon adds the marbles he bought.**
   Initially, the store had 50 marbles. After adding the 20 marbles from Johanna, the total number of marbles in the store becomes:
   \[
   \text{Total marbles in store} = \text{Initial marbles} + \text{Marbles bought from Johanna} = 50 + 20 = 70
   \]

3. **Calculate how many marbles Solomon's father gave him.**
   Solomon's father gave him \( \frac{2}{5} \) times as many marbles as he bought from Johanna. Since Solomon bought 20 marbles, we calculate:
   \[
   \text{Marbles from father} = \frac{2}{5} \times 20 = \frac{40}{5} = 8
   \]

4. **Add the marbles from his father to the total in the store.**
   Now, we add the 8 marbles from his father to the 70 marbles already in the store:
   \[
   \text{Total marbles in store after father's contribution} = 70 + 8 = 78
   \]

5. **Calculate the total weight of the marbles.**
   Each marble weighs 2 kg. Therefore, the total weight of the marbles is:
   \[
   \text{Total weight} = \text{Total number of marbles} \times \text{Weight per marble} = 78 \times 2 = 156 \text{ kg}
   \]

Finally, we conclude that the total weight of the marbles Solomon has in the store is:
\[
\boxed{156 \text{ kg}}
\]
