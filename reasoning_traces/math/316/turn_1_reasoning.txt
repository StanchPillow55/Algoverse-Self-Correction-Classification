==================================================

To solve the problem of finding the new selling price of a bicycle after a 15% increase, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - The original selling price of the bicycle last year was $220.
   - The price is increased by 15%.

2. **Calculate the Increase:**
   - To find the amount of the increase, we calculate 15% of the original price.
   - The formula to calculate a percentage of a number is:
     \[
     \text{Percentage of a number} = \left(\frac{\text{Percentage}}{100}\right) \times \text{Original Number}
     \]
   - Applying this to our problem:
     \[
     \text{Increase} = \left(\frac{15}{100}\right) \times 220
     \]

3. **Perform the Calculation:**
   - First, convert 15% to a decimal: \( \frac{15}{100} = 0.15 \).
   - Multiply this by the original price:
     \[
     \text{Increase} = 0.15 \times 220 = 33
     \]
   - So, the price increase is $33.

4. **Calculate the New Price:**
   - Add the increase to the original price to find the new price:
     \[
     \text{New Price} = \text{Original Price} + \text{Increase}
     \]
   - Substitute the known values:
     \[
     \text{New Price} = 220 + 33 = 253
     \]

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The new selling price of the bicycle, after a 15% increase, is $253.

Therefore, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{253}
\]
