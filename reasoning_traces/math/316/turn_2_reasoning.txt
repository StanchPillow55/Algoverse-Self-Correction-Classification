Question ID: 316
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we will break it down into several steps:

1. **Determine the number of marbles Solomon has after buying from Johanna.**
   - Solomon bought 20 marbles from Johanna.
   - Initially, the store had 50 marbles.
   - Therefore, the total number of marbles Solomon has after the purchase is:
     \[
     20 + 50 = 70 \text{ marbles}
     \]

2. **Calculate how many marbles Solomon's father gave him.**
   - Solomon's father gave him \( \frac{2}{5} \) times as many marbles as he bought from Johanna.
   - Solomon bought 20 marbles, so the number of marbles his father gave him is:
     \[
     \frac{2}{5} \times 20 = \frac{40}{5} = 8 \text{ marbles}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total number of marbles Solomon has in the store after receiving marbles from his father.**
   - After receiving the 8 marbles from his father, the total number of marbles Solomon has is:
     \[
     70 + 8 = 78 \text{ marbles}
     \]

4. **Calculate the total weight of the marbles.**
   - Each marble weighs 2 kg.
   - Therefore, the total weight of the marbles is:
     \[
     78 \text{ marbles} \times 2 \text{ kg/marble} = 156 \text{ kg}
     \]

5. **State the final answer.**
   - The total weight of the marbles Solomon has in the store is:
     \[
     \boxed{156 \text{ kg}}
     \]
