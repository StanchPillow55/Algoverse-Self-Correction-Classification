To solve the problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate Frank's total amount of money.**
   - Frank has:
     - 7 one-dollar bills: \( 7 \times 1 = 7 \) dollars
     - 4 five-dollar bills: \( 4 \times 5 = 20 \) dollars
     - 2 ten-dollar bills: \( 2 \times 10 = 20 \) dollars
     - 1 twenty-dollar bill: \( 1 \times 20 = 20 \) dollars

   Now, we add these amounts together:
   \[
   \text{Total money} = 7 + 20 + 20 + 20 = 67 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Determine how much Frank spent on peanuts.**
   - Frank has $4 in change after buying peanuts, which means he spent:
   \[
   \text{Amount spent} = \text{Total money} - \text{Change} = 67 - 4 = 63 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Calculate how many pounds of peanuts Frank bought.**
   - The cost of peanuts is $3 per pound. To find out how many pounds he bought, we divide the amount spent by the cost per pound:
   \[
   \text{Pounds of peanuts} = \frac{\text{Amount spent}}{\text{Cost per pound}} = \frac{63}{3} = 21 \text{ pounds}
   \]

4. **Calculate the average amount of peanuts Frank eats per day.**
   - Frank plans to eat the peanuts over one week, which is 7 days. To find the average amount he eats per day, we divide the total pounds of peanuts by the number of days:
   \[
   \text{Average per day} = \frac{\text{Total pounds}}{\text{Number of days}} = \frac{21}{7} = 3 \text{ pounds per day}
   \]

Thus, the final answer is that Frank eats an average of **3 pounds of peanuts per day**.
