To solve the problem, we will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of students who exited through exit A.**
2. **Determine the number of students remaining after some exited through A.**
3. **Calculate the number of students who exited through exit B.**
4. **Determine the number of students remaining after some exited through B.**
5. **Calculate the number of students who exited through exit C.**

Let's go through each step in detail.

### Step 1: Calculate the number of students who exited through exit A.

The total number of students is 1000. According to the problem, 30% of the students exited through exit A.

\[
\text{Number of students who exited through A} = 30\% \text{ of } 1000 = 0.30 \times 1000 = 300
\]

### Step 2: Determine the number of students remaining after some exited through A.

After 300 students exited through A, the number of students remaining in the hall is:

\[
\text{Remaining students} = 1000 - 300 = 700
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the number of students who exited through exit B.

Next, we need to find out how many students exited through exit B. The problem states that 3/5 of the remaining students exited through B.

\[
\text{Number of students who exited through B} = \frac{3}{5} \text{ of } 700 = \frac{3}{5} \times 700 = 420
\]

### Step 4: Determine the number of students remaining after some exited through B.

After 420 students exited through B, the number of students remaining in the hall is:

\[
\text{Remaining students} = 700 - 420 = 280
\]

### Step 5: Calculate the number of students who exited through exit C.

The remaining students, who did not exit through A or B, exited through C. Therefore, the number of students who exited through C is:

\[
\text{Number of students who exited through C} = 280
\]

### Final Answer

Thus, the number of students who went out through exit C is:

\[
\boxed{280}
\]
