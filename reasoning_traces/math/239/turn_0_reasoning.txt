==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine how many pounds of peanuts Frank buys and then calculate how many pounds he eats on average per day.

**Step 1: Calculate Frank's total initial amount of money.**

Frank has:
- 7 one-dollar bills: \(7 \times 1 = 7\) dollars
- 4 five-dollar bills: \(4 \times 5 = 20\) dollars
- 2 ten-dollar bills: \(2 \times 10 = 20\) dollars
- 1 twenty-dollar bill: \(1 \times 20 = 20\) dollars

Adding these amounts together gives Frank's total initial money:
\[ 7 + 20 + 20 + 20 = 67 \text{ dollars} \]

**Step 2: Determine how much money Frank spends on peanuts.**

Frank ends up with $4 in change after buying peanuts. Therefore, the amount he spends on peanuts is:
\[ 67 - 4 = 63 \text{ dollars} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the number of pounds of peanuts Frank buys.**

The cost of peanuts is $3 per pound. To find out how many pounds Frank buys, we divide the total amount he spends by the cost per pound:
\[ \frac{63}{3} = 21 \text{ pounds} \]

**Step 4: Calculate the average number of pounds Frank eats per day.**

Frank plans to eat the peanuts over one week, which is 7 days. To find the average number of pounds he eats per day, we divide the total pounds by the number of days:
\[ \frac{21}{7} = 3 \text{ pounds per day} \]

**Final Answer:**

Frank eats on average 3 pounds of peanuts per day.
