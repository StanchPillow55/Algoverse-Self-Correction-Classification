==================================================

It seems like there might be some confusion with the problem statement, as "Sample math problem 71" does not provide specific details about the problem to be solved. To help you effectively, I need more information or context about the math problem you're referring to. 

However, I can guide you through a generic math problem-solving process. Let's consider a sample math problem and work through it step by step:

**Sample Problem:**
Solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We are given a linear equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).
   - Our goal is to solve for the variable \( x \).

2. **Isolate the Variable:**
   - To solve for \( x \), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation.
   - Start by eliminating the constant term on the left side of the equation.

3. **Subtract 3 from Both Sides:**
   \[
   2x + 3 - 3 = 11 - 3
   \]
   - This simplifies to:
   \[
   2x = 8
   \]

4. **Divide Both Sides by 2:**
   \[
   \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{8}{2}
   \]
   - This simplifies to:
   \[
   x = 4
   \]

5. **Verify the Solution:**
   - Substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies the equation.
   \[
   2(4) + 3 = 11
   \]
   - Simplifying the left side:
   \[
   8 + 3 = 11
   \]
   - Since both sides of the equation are equal, our solution is verified.

6. **State the Final Answer:**
   - The solution to the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \) is \( x = 4 \).

If you have a specific problem or need further assistance, please provide more details, and I'll be happy to help!
