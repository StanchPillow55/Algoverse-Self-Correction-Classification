==================================================

To solve the problem, we first need to understand what "Sample reasoning question 242" entails. However, since the problem statement is not provided, I'll demonstrate a general approach to solving a reasoning problem by creating a hypothetical scenario.

Let's assume "Sample reasoning question 242" involves a mathematical reasoning problem. Here's a step-by-step approach to solving a typical math reasoning problem:

### Hypothetical Problem:
**Problem Statement:**  
A farmer has a total of 242 animals consisting of chickens and cows. If the total number of legs is 642, how many chickens and how many cows does the farmer have?

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( c \) be the number of chickens.
   - Let \( w \) be the number of cows.

2. **Set Up Equations:**
   - Each chicken has 2 legs, and each cow has 4 legs.
   - We have two equations based on the problem:
     1. Total number of animals:  
        \[
        c + w = 242
        \]
     2. Total number of legs:  
        \[
        2c + 4w = 642
        \]

3. **Solve the System of Equations:**
   - From the first equation, express \( c \) in terms of \( w \):  
     \[
     c = 242 - w
     \]
   - Substitute \( c = 242 - w \) into the second equation:  
     \[
     2(242 - w) + 4w = 642
     \]
   - Simplify and solve for \( w \):  
     \[
     484 - 2w + 4w = 642
     \]
     \[
     2w + 484 = 642
     \]
     \[
     2w = 642 - 484
     \]
     \[
     2w = 158
     \]
     \[
     w = 79
     \]

4. **Find the Number of Chickens:**
   - Substitute \( w = 79 \) back into the equation for \( c \):  
     \[
     c = 242 - 79
     \]
     \[
     c = 163
     \]

5. **Verify the Solution:**
   - Check the total number of legs:  
     \[
     2c + 4w = 2(163) + 4(79) = 326 + 316 = 642
     \]
   - The calculations are consistent with the problem statement.

### Final Answer:
The farmer has 163 chickens and 79 cows.

This approach demonstrates how to systematically solve a reasoning problem by defining variables, setting up equations, solving the system, and verifying the solution. If you have a specific problem statement for "Sample reasoning question 242," please provide it, and I can tailor the solution accordingly.
