==================================================

To solve this problem, we first need to understand what "Sample reasoning question 269" refers to. Since the problem statement doesn't provide specific details about the question, I'll assume that "Sample reasoning question 269" is a placeholder for a typical math problem. 

Let's create a hypothetical math problem to solve:

**Problem:**
A company produces two types of widgets: Type A and Type B. The company sells Type A widgets for $50 each and Type B widgets for $70 each. Last month, the company sold a total of 500 widgets and made $28,000 in revenue. How many of each type of widget did the company sell?

**Solution:**

To solve this problem, we need to set up a system of equations based on the information given.

1. **Define the variables:**
   - Let \( x \) be the number of Type A widgets sold.
   - Let \( y \) be the number of Type B widgets sold.

2. **Set up the equations:**
   - The total number of widgets sold is 500:
     \[
     x + y = 500
     \]
   - The total revenue from selling the widgets is $28,000:
     \[
     50x + 70y = 28000
     \]

3. **Solve the system of equations:**

   We have the following system of equations:
   \[
   \begin{align*}
   x + y &= 500 \quad \text{(Equation 1)} \\
   50x + 70y &= 28000 \quad \text{(Equation 2)}
   \end{align*}
   \]

   From Equation 1, solve for \( y \):
   \[
   y = 500 - x
   \]

   Substitute \( y = 500 - x \) into Equation 2:
   \[
   50x + 70(500 - x) = 28000
   \]

   Simplify and solve for \( x \):
   \[
   50x + 35000 - 70x = 28000
   \]

   Combine like terms:
   \[
   -20x + 35000 = 28000
   \]

   Subtract 35000 from both sides:
   \[
   -20x = 28000 - 35000
   \]
   \[
   -20x = -7000
   \]

   Divide both sides by -20:
   \[
   x = \frac{-7000}{-20} = 350
   \]

   Now that we have \( x = 350 \), substitute back into the equation for \( y \):
   \[
   y = 500 - x = 500 - 350 = 150
   \]

4. **Verify the solution:**

   Check the total revenue:
   \[
   50(350) + 70(150) = 17500 + 10500 = 28000
   \]

   The calculations are correct, and the total revenue matches the given amount.

**Final Answer:**
The company sold 350 Type A widgets and 150 Type B widgets.
