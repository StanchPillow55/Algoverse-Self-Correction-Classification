==================================================

To solve the problem, let's first understand what "Sample reasoning question 269" might entail. Since the problem statement is not specific, I'll assume this is a placeholder for a typical math problem. Let's create a hypothetical math problem and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**

A rectangle has a length that is twice its width. If the perimeter of the rectangle is 48 units, find the dimensions of the rectangle.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( w \) be the width of the rectangle.
   - Since the length is twice the width, the length \( l \) can be expressed as \( l = 2w \).

2. **Use the Perimeter Formula:**
   - The formula for the perimeter \( P \) of a rectangle is given by:
     \[
     P = 2l + 2w
     \]
   - We know the perimeter is 48 units, so we can set up the equation:
     \[
     2l + 2w = 48
     \]

3. **Substitute the Expression for Length:**
   - Substitute \( l = 2w \) into the perimeter equation:
     \[
     2(2w) + 2w = 48
     \]

4. **Simplify the Equation:**
   - Simplify the left side of the equation:
     \[
     4w + 2w = 48
     \]
   - Combine like terms:
     \[
     6w = 48
     \]

5. **Solve for Width:**
   - Divide both sides by 6 to solve for \( w \):
     \[
     w = \frac{48}{6} = 8
     \]

6. **Find the Length:**
   - Since \( l = 2w \), substitute \( w = 8 \) into the expression for length:
     \[
     l = 2 \times 8 = 16
     \]

7. **Verify the Solution:**
   - Check the perimeter with the found dimensions:
     \[
     P = 2l + 2w = 2(16) + 2(8) = 32 + 16 = 48
     \]
   - The calculated perimeter matches the given perimeter, confirming our solution is correct.

**Final Answer:**

The dimensions of the rectangle are:
- Width = 8 units
- Length = 16 units
