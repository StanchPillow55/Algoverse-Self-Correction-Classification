Question ID: 702
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we will first determine the hauling capacities of Gissela's and Gordy's trucks, and then use that information to find out how much Gary's truck can carry.

1. **Determine Gissela's truck capacity**:
   - Gissela's truck can haul **4,000 pounds** of gravel.

2. **Determine Gordy's truck capacity**:
   - Gordy's truck can haul **800 pounds more** than Gissela's truck. 
   - Therefore, Gordy's truck capacity is:
     \[
     4000 + 800 = 4800 \text{ pounds}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total capacity of Gissela's and Gordy's trucks**:
   - The combined capacity of Gissela's and Gordy's trucks is:
     \[
     4000 + 4800 = 8800 \text{ pounds}
     \]

4. **Determine the total capacity of all three trucks**:
   - We know that when Gary joins, the total capacity of all three trucks is **11,600 pounds**.

5. **Find Gary's truck capacity**:
   - Let \( G \) represent the capacity of Gary's truck. According to the information given, we can set up the following equation:
     \[
     8800 + G = 11600
     \]

6. **Solve for \( G \)**:
   - To find \( G \), we subtract the combined capacity of Gissela's and Gordy's trucks from the total capacity:
     \[
     G = 11600 - 8800
     \]
     \[
     G = 2800 \text{ pounds}
     \]

Thus, Gary's truck can carry **2,800 pounds** of gravel.

**Final Answer**: Gary's truck can carry **2,800 pounds** of gravel.
