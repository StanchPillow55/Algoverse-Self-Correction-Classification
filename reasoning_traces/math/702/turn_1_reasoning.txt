==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to determine how much gravel Gary's truck can carry based on the information provided about Gissela's and Gordy's trucks.

1. **Identify Gissela's truck capacity**:
   Gissela's truck can haul 4,000 pounds of gravel.

2. **Determine Gordy's truck capacity**:
   Gordy's truck can haul 800 pounds more than Gissela's truck. Therefore, we can calculate Gordy's truck capacity as follows:
   \[
   \text{Gordy's truck capacity} = \text{Gissela's truck capacity} + 800
   \]
   Substituting Gissela's truck capacity:
   \[
   \text{Gordy's truck capacity} = 4000 + 800 = 4800 \text{ pounds}
   \]

3. **Combine the capacities of Gissela's and Gordy's trucks**:
   Now we can find the total capacity of Gissela's and Gordy's trucks combined:
   \[
   \text{Total capacity of Gissela and Gordy} = \text{Gissela's truck capacity} + \text{Gordy's truck capacity}
   \]
   Substituting the values we have:
   \[
   \text{Total capacity of Gissela and Gordy} = 4000 + 4800 = 8800 \text{ pounds}
   \]

4. **Determine the total capacity of all three trucks**:
   We know that the combined capacity of Gissela's, Gordy's, and Gary's trucks is 11,600 pounds. We can express this as:
   \[
   \text{Total capacity of all three trucks} = \text{Total capacity of Gissela and Gordy} + \text{Gary's truck capacity}
   \]
   Let \( G \) represent Gary's truck capacity. Therefore, we can write:
   \[
   11600 = 8800 + G
   \]

5. **Solve for Gary's truck capacity**:
   To find \( G \), we can rearrange the equation:
   \[
   G = 11600 - 8800
   \]
   Performing the subtraction:
   \[
   G = 2800 \text{ pounds}
   \]

Thus, Gary's truck can carry **2,800 pounds** of gravel.

**Final Answer**: Gary's truck can carry 2,800 pounds of gravel.
