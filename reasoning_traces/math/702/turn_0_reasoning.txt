==================================================

To solve the problem, we will first determine the hauling capacities of Gissela's and Gordy's trucks, and then use that information to find out how much Gary's truck can carry.

1. **Determine Gissela's truck capacity**:
   Gissela's truck can haul 4,000 pounds of gravel.

   \[
   \text{Gissela's truck capacity} = 4000 \text{ pounds}
   \]

2. **Determine Gordy's truck capacity**:
   Gordy's truck can haul 800 pounds more than Gissela's truck. Therefore, we calculate Gordy's truck capacity as follows:

   \[
   \text{Gordy's truck capacity} = \text{Gissela's truck capacity} + 800
   \]
   \[
   \text{Gordy's truck capacity} = 4000 + 800 = 4800 \text{ pounds}
   \]

3. **Combine the capacities of Gissela's and Gordy's trucks**:
   Now we add the capacities of Gissela's and Gordy's trucks to find the total capacity of both trucks:

   \[
   \text{Total capacity of Gissela's and Gordy's trucks} = 4000 + 4800
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total capacity of Gissela's and Gordy's trucks} = 8800 \text{ pounds}
   \]

4. **Determine the total capacity of all three trucks**:
   We know that the combined capacity of Gissela's, Gordy's, and Gary's trucks is 11,600 pounds. We can express this as:

   \[
   \text{Total capacity of all three trucks} = \text{Gissela's truck capacity} + \text{Gordy's truck capacity} + \text{Gary's truck capacity}
   \]
   \[
   11600 = 4000 + 4800 + \text{Gary's truck capacity}
   \]

5. **Solve for Gary's truck capacity**:
   We can rearrange the equation to find Gary's truck capacity:

   \[
   \text{Gary's truck capacity} = 11600 - (4000 + 4800)
   \]
   \[
   \text{Gary's truck capacity} = 11600 - 8800
   \]
   \[
   \text{Gary's truck capacity} = 2800 \text{ pounds}
   \]

Thus, the final answer is that Gary's truck can carry **2,800 pounds** of gravel.
