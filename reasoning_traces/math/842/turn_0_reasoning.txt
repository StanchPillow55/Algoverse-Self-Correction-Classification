==================================================

To determine how much change Thea received after purchasing the hat, we can follow these steps:

1. **Identify the cost of the hat**: The hat costs $70.

2. **Determine the amount Thea paid**: Thea gave the craftsman four $20 bills. We need to calculate the total amount she paid:
   \[
   \text{Total amount paid} = 4 \times 20 = 80 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Calculate the change**: To find out how much change Thea should receive, we subtract the cost of the hat from the total amount she paid:
   \[
   \text{Change} = \text{Total amount paid} - \text{Cost of the hat}
   \]
   Substituting the values we have:
   \[
   \text{Change} = 80 - 70 = 10 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Final answer**: Thea received $10 in change.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{10}
\]
