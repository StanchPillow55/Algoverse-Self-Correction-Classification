==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to determine how many songs Jeremy listened to today based on the information given about yesterday.

1. **Identify the number of songs listened to yesterday**: 
   - The problem states that Jeremy listened to 9 songs yesterday.

2. **Determine the relationship between songs listened to yesterday and today**: 
   - The problem states that Jeremy listened to five fewer songs yesterday than today. This means that if we let \( x \) represent the number of songs Jeremy listened to today, we can express this relationship mathematically:
   \[
   \text{Songs listened to yesterday} = \text{Songs listened to today} - 5
   \]
   Substituting the known value for yesterday:
   \[
   9 = x - 5
   \]

3. **Solve for \( x \)**:
   - To find \( x \), we can rearrange the equation:
   \[
   x = 9 + 5
   \]
   \[
   x = 14
   \]
   So, Jeremy listened to 14 songs today.

4. **Calculate the total number of songs listened to over the two days**:
   - Now that we know how many songs Jeremy listened to yesterday and today, we can find the total:
   \[
   \text{Total songs} = \text{Songs yesterday} + \text{Songs today}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total songs} = 9 + 14
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total songs} = 23
   \]

5. **Final answer**:
   - Therefore, the total number of songs Jeremy listened to in two days is \( \boxed{23} \).
