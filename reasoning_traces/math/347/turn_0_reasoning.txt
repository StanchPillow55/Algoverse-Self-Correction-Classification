To solve the problem, we need to determine how many songs Jeremy listened to today and then find the total number of songs he listened to over the two days.

**Step 1: Determine how many songs Jeremy listened to today.**

We know from the problem that Jeremy listened to five fewer songs yesterday than today. We also know that yesterday, he listened to nine songs.

Let's denote the number of songs Jeremy listened to today as \( x \).

According to the problem, yesterday he listened to five fewer songs than today, so we can set up the equation:

\[ x - 5 = 9 \]

**Step 2: Solve the equation for \( x \).**

To find \( x \), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We do this by adding 5 to both sides of the equation:

\[ x - 5 + 5 = 9 + 5 \]

This simplifies to:

\[ x = 14 \]

So, Jeremy listened to 14 songs today.

**Step 3: Calculate the total number of songs Jeremy listened to over the two days.**

Now that we know Jeremy listened to 14 songs today and 9 songs yesterday, we can find the total number of songs he listened to over the two days by adding these two numbers together:

\[ 14 + 9 = 23 \]

**Final Answer:**

Jeremy listened to a total of 23 songs over the two days.
