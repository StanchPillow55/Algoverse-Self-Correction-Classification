==================================================

To determine how much Davos paid for the 2 shirts after applying the 40% discount, we will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the original total cost of the shirts**: 
   Each shirt costs $30, and Davos bought 2 shirts. Therefore, the original total cost can be calculated as follows:

   \[
   \text{Original Total Cost} = \text{Cost per Shirt} \times \text{Number of Shirts}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Original Total Cost} = 30 \times 2 = 60
   \]

2. **Calculate the discount amount**: 
   The discount is 40% of the original total cost. To find the discount amount, we first convert the percentage to a decimal and then multiply by the original total cost:

   \[
   \text{Discount Percentage} = 40\% = 0.40
   \]
   \[
   \text{Discount Amount} = \text{Original Total Cost} \times \text{Discount Percentage}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Discount Amount} = 60 \times 0.40 = 24
   \]

3. **Calculate the final price after the discount**: 
   To find out how much Davos actually paid, we subtract the discount amount from the original total cost:

   \[
   \text{Final Price} = \text{Original Total Cost} - \text{Discount Amount}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Final Price} = 60 - 24 = 36
   \]

Thus, after applying the 40% discount, Davos paid **$36** for the 2 shirts.

Final answer: **$36**.
