==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine how many people are expected to actually attend Laura's wedding, given that approximately 5% of the invited guests typically do not show up.

Here are the steps to solve the problem:

1. **Determine the number of people who are expected not to show up:**

   Laura expects 220 people to attend her wedding. However, she has been informed that about 5% of the invited guests typically do not show up. To find out how many people this 5% represents, we calculate 5% of 220.

   \[
   \text{Number of no-shows} = 220 \times \frac{5}{100}
   \]

   \[
   \text{Number of no-shows} = 220 \times 0.05
   \]

   \[
   \text{Number of no-shows} = 11
   \]

   So, approximately 11 people are expected not to attend.

2. **Calculate the number of people who are expected to attend:**

   To find out how many people will actually attend the wedding, we subtract the number of no-shows from the total number of expected guests.

   \[
   \text{Number of attendees} = 220 - 11
   \]

   \[
   \text{Number of attendees} = 209
   \]

Therefore, based on the given information and calculations, approximately 209 people are expected to attend Laura's wedding.

**Final Answer: 209 people are expected to attend Laura's wedding.**
