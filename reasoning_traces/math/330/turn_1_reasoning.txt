==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine how many people are expected to actually attend Laura's wedding, given that approximately 5% of the invited guests typically do not show up.

Here are the steps to solve the problem:

1. **Determine the Total Number of Expected Guests:**
   Laura expects 220 people to attend her wedding.

2. **Calculate the Percentage of No-Shows:**
   We are told that approximately 5% of the invited guests typically do not show up. To find out how many people this percentage represents, we need to calculate 5% of 220.

   \[
   \text{Number of no-shows} = 220 \times \frac{5}{100}
   \]

   \[
   \text{Number of no-shows} = 220 \times 0.05
   \]

   \[
   \text{Number of no-shows} = 11
   \]

   So, approximately 11 people are expected not to show up.

3. **Calculate the Number of Attendees:**
   To find out how many people will actually attend the wedding, we subtract the number of no-shows from the total number of expected guests.

   \[
   \text{Number of attendees} = 220 - 11
   \]

   \[
   \text{Number of attendees} = 209
   \]

Therefore, based on the information provided and the typical no-show rate, Laura can expect approximately 209 people to attend her wedding.

**Final Answer:**
209 people are expected to attend Laura's wedding.
