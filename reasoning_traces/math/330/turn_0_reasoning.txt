To solve the problem, we will break it down into steps and calculate each part carefully.

### Step 1: Calculate the rewards earned from the last shopping trip.

The customer spent $80 on their last shopping trip. According to the loyalty card rules, they earn $1 off for every $20 spent. 

To find out how many rewards they earned, we can use the following calculation:

\[
\text{Rewards} = \frac{\text{Amount spent}}{20} = \frac{80}{20} = 4
\]

So, the customer earned **4 rewards**, which translates to **$4 off** their next purchase.

### Step 2: Determine the amount spent on the current shopping trip.

On this shopping trip, the customer spent $43.

### Step 3: Apply the rewards to the current shopping trip.

The customer has $4 in rewards. They can apply this to their current purchase of $43.

\[
\text{Price after applying rewards} = \text{Current purchase} - \text{Rewards} = 43 - 4 = 39
\]

So, after applying the rewards, the price is **$39**.

### Step 4: Apply the coupon.

The problem states that the customer applied a coupon that took **twice the amount of rewards off the price**. Since the rewards amount to $4, the coupon will take off:

\[
\text{Coupon discount} = 2 \times \text{Rewards} = 2 \times 4 = 8
\]

### Step 5: Calculate the final price after applying the coupon.

Now we subtract the coupon discount from the price after applying the rewards:

\[
\text{Final price} = \text{Price after rewards} - \text{Coupon discount} = 39 - 8 = 31
\]

### Final Answer

Thus, the customer paid **$31** on this shopping trip. 

\[
\boxed{31}
\]
