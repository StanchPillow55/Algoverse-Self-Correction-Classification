To determine how many people will actually attend Laura's wedding, we need to account for the expected no-shows based on the information provided.

1. **Determine the expected no-shows**: 
   Laura expects 220 people to attend, but approximately 5% of them typically do not show up. We can calculate the number of expected no-shows by finding 5% of 220.

   \[
   \text{No-shows} = 5\% \text{ of } 220
   \]

   To calculate 5% of 220, we convert the percentage to a decimal:

   \[
   5\% = \frac{5}{100} = 0.05
   \]

   Now, we multiply this decimal by the total number of expected attendees:

   \[
   \text{No-shows} = 0.05 \times 220
   \]

   Performing the multiplication:

   \[
   \text{No-shows} = 11
   \]

2. **Calculate the expected attendees**: 
   Now that we know there are expected to be 11 no-shows, we can find the number of people who will actually attend the wedding by subtracting the number of no-shows from the total expected attendees.

   \[
   \text{Expected attendees} = \text{Total expected} - \text{No-shows}
   \]

   Substituting the values we have:

   \[
   \text{Expected attendees} = 220 - 11
   \]

   Performing the subtraction:

   \[
   \text{Expected attendees} = 209
   \]

3. **Final answer**: 
   Therefore, the number of people who will go to Laura's wedding is 

   \[
   \boxed{209}
   \]
