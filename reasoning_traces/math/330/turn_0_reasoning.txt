==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine how many people are expected to actually attend Laura's wedding, given that approximately 5% of the invited guests typically do not show up.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Determine the Total Number of Invited Guests:**
   Laura expects 220 people to attend her wedding.

2. **Calculate the Percentage of No-Shows:**
   We are told that approximately 5% of the invited guests typically do not show up. To find out how many people this percentage represents, we calculate 5% of 220.

   \[
   \text{Number of no-shows} = 220 \times \frac{5}{100}
   \]

3. **Perform the Calculation:**
   \[
   \text{Number of no-shows} = 220 \times 0.05 = 11
   \]

   So, approximately 11 people are expected not to show up.

4. **Calculate the Expected Number of Attendees:**
   To find out how many people will actually attend the wedding, we subtract the number of no-shows from the total number of invited guests.

   \[
   \text{Expected number of attendees} = 220 - 11 = 209
   \]

### Final Answer:
Laura can expect approximately 209 people to attend her wedding.
