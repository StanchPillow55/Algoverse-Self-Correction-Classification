Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total time spent on cooking and watching the movies. Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Time Spent on Cooking:**
   - Making popcorn takes 10 minutes.
   - Making fries takes twice as long as making popcorn, which is \(2 \times 10 = 20\) minutes.
   - Total cooking time = 10 minutes (popcorn) + 20 minutes (fries) = 30 minutes.

2. **Time Spent Watching Movies:**
   - The first movie is 1 hour and 30 minutes long.
   - The second movie is 30 minutes longer than the first movie. Therefore, the second movie is \(1 \text{ hour and } 30 \text{ minutes} + 30 \text{ minutes} = 2 \text{ hours}\).
   - Total movie time = 1 hour 30 minutes (first movie) + 2 hours (second movie).

3. **Convert All Times to Minutes:**
   - 1 hour = 60 minutes.
   - First movie: \(1 \text{ hour and } 30 \text{ minutes} = 60 + 30 = 90\) minutes.
   - Second movie: 2 hours = \(2 \times 60 = 120\) minutes.
   - Total movie time in minutes = 90 minutes (first movie) + 120 minutes (second movie) = 210 minutes.

4. **Total Time for Cooking and Watching Movies:**
   - Total time = Total cooking time + Total movie time = 30 minutes (cooking) + 210 minutes (movies) = 240 minutes.

5. **Convert Total Time to Hours:**
   - 240 minutes = \( \frac{240}{60} = 4 \) hours.

Therefore, it took Joseph and his friends a total of 4 hours to cook and watch the movies.

**Final Answer: 4 hours**
