Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we will break it down into parts and calculate the total time spent on each activity step by step.

1. **Duration of the First Movie**:
   The first movie is 1 hour and 30 minutes long. We can convert this into minutes for easier calculations:
   \[
   1 \text{ hour} = 60 \text{ minutes}
   \]
   Therefore, 
   \[
   1 \text{ hour and } 30 \text{ minutes} = 60 + 30 = 90 \text{ minutes}
   \]

2. **Duration of the Second Movie**:
   The second movie is 30 minutes longer than the first movie. Thus, we add 30 minutes to the duration of the first movie:
   \[
   \text{Duration of the second movie} = 90 \text{ minutes} + 30 \text{ minutes} = 120 \text{ minutes}
   \]

3. **Time Spent Making Popcorn**:
   They spent 10 minutes making popcorn.

4. **Time Spent Making Fries**:
   The time spent making fries is twice the time spent making popcorn. Therefore:
   \[
   \text{Time spent making fries} = 2 \times 10 \text{ minutes} = 20 \text{ minutes}
   \]

5. **Total Time Calculation**:
   Now, we will sum up all the time spent on each activity:
   - Time spent making popcorn: 10 minutes
   - Time spent making fries: 20 minutes
   - Time spent watching the first movie: 90 minutes
   - Time spent watching the second movie: 120 minutes

   Adding these times together:
   \[
   \text{Total time} = 10 + 20 + 90 + 120
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total time} = 240 \text{ minutes}
   \]

6. **Convert Total Time to Hours**:
   To convert the total time from minutes to hours, we divide by 60:
   \[
   \text{Total time in hours} = \frac{240 \text{ minutes}}{60} = 4 \text{ hours}
   \]

Finally, the total time it took Joseph and his friends to cook and watch the movies is:
\[
\boxed{4} \text{ hours}
\]
