To solve the problem, we will break it down into parts and calculate the total time spent on each activity.

1. **Duration of the First Movie**:
   The first movie is 1 hour and 30 minutes long. We can convert this into minutes for easier calculations:
   \[
   1 \text{ hour} = 60 \text{ minutes}
   \]
   Therefore,
   \[
   1 \text{ hour and } 30 \text{ minutes} = 60 \text{ minutes} + 30 \text{ minutes} = 90 \text{ minutes}
   \]

2. **Duration of the Second Movie**:
   The second movie is 30 minutes longer than the first movie. So, we add 30 minutes to the duration of the first movie:
   \[
   \text{Duration of the second movie} = 90 \text{ minutes} + 30 \text{ minutes} = 120 \text{ minutes}
   \]

3. **Time Spent Making Popcorn**:
   They spent 10 minutes making popcorn.

4. **Time Spent Making Fries**:
   They spent twice as long making fries as they did making popcorn. Therefore, the time spent making fries is:
   \[
   \text{Time for fries} = 2 \times 10 \text{ minutes} = 20 \text{ minutes}
   \]

5. **Total Time Calculation**:
   Now, we will sum up all the time spent on each activity:
   - Time for the first movie: 90 minutes
   - Time for the second movie: 120 minutes
   - Time for making popcorn: 10 minutes
   - Time for making fries: 20 minutes

   Adding these together:
   \[
   \text{Total time} = 90 \text{ minutes} + 120 \text{ minutes} + 10 \text{ minutes} + 20 \text{ minutes}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total time} = 90 + 120 + 10 + 20 = 340 \text{ minutes}
   \]

6. **Convert Total Time to Hours**:
   To convert the total time from minutes to hours, we divide by 60:
   \[
   \text{Total time in hours} = \frac{340 \text{ minutes}}{60} \approx 5.67 \text{ hours}
   \]

   To express this in hours and minutes:
   - The integer part is 5 hours.
   - To find the remaining minutes, we calculate:
   \[
   340 \text{ minutes} - (5 \times 60) = 340 - 300 = 40 \text{ minutes}
   \]

Thus, the total time spent cooking and watching the movies is **5 hours and 40 minutes**.

**Final Answer**: 5 hours and 40 minutes.
