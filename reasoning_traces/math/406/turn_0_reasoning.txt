==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total time Joseph and his friends spent cooking and watching the movies. We'll break down the problem into smaller steps and calculate each part separately.

### Step 1: Calculate the duration of the first movie
The first movie is 1 hour and 30 minutes long. To work with consistent units, let's convert this time into minutes:
- 1 hour = 60 minutes
- Therefore, 1 hour and 30 minutes = 60 minutes + 30 minutes = 90 minutes

### Step 2: Calculate the duration of the second movie
The second movie is 30 minutes longer than the first movie. Since the first movie is 90 minutes long, the second movie will be:
- 90 minutes + 30 minutes = 120 minutes

### Step 3: Calculate the total time spent watching movies
Now, we add the durations of both movies to find the total time spent watching:
- Total movie time = 90 minutes (first movie) + 120 minutes (second movie) = 210 minutes

### Step 4: Calculate the time spent making popcorn and fries
Joseph and his friends spent 10 minutes making popcorn. They spent twice as long making fries. Therefore, the time spent making fries is:
- 2 ร 10 minutes = 20 minutes

Now, we add the time spent making popcorn and fries:
- Total cooking time = 10 minutes (popcorn) + 20 minutes (fries) = 30 minutes

### Step 5: Calculate the total time spent cooking and watching movies
To find the total time spent on both activities, we add the total movie time and the total cooking time:
- Total time = 210 minutes (movies) + 30 minutes (cooking) = 240 minutes

### Step 6: Convert the total time from minutes to hours
Since the question asks for the total time in hours, we convert 240 minutes to hours:
- 1 hour = 60 minutes
- 240 minutes รท 60 minutes/hour = 4 hours

Thus, the total time Joseph and his friends spent cooking and watching the movies is **4 hours**.

### Final Answer
The total time it took Joseph and his friends to cook and watch the movies is 4 hours.
