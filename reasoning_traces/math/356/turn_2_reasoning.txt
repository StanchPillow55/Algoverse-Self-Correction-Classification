Question ID: 356
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total points James earned based on the scoring system described.

### Step-by-Step Calculation:

1. **Understanding the Scoring System:**
   - Each correct answer earns 2 points.
   - If a student answers all questions correctly in a round, they receive an additional 4-point bonus for that round.
   - Each round consists of 5 questions.

2. **Total Questions and Missed Questions:**
   - There are 5 rounds, each with 5 questions, so the total number of questions is:
     \[
     5 \text{ rounds} \times 5 \text{ questions per round} = 25 \text{ questions}
     \]
   - James missed 1 question, so he answered:
     \[
     25 - 1 = 24 \text{ questions correctly}
     \]

3. **Calculating Points for Correct Answers:**
   - Each correct answer earns 2 points, so for 24 correct answers, James earns:
     \[
     24 \times 2 = 48 \text{ points}
     \]

4. **Determining Bonus Points:**
   - To earn the 4-point bonus in a round, James must answer all 5 questions correctly in that round.
   - Since James missed only 1 question, he must have answered all questions correctly in 4 out of the 5 rounds.
   - Therefore, he earns the 4-point bonus for 4 rounds:
     \[
     4 \text{ rounds} \times 4 \text{ bonus points per round} = 16 \text{ bonus points}
     \]

5. **Calculating Total Points:**
   - Add the points from correct answers and the bonus points:
     \[
     48 \text{ points from correct answers} + 16 \text{ bonus points} = 64 \text{ total points}
     \]

### Conclusion:
James earned a total of 64 points. 

**Final Answer: 64 points**
