Question ID: 356
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To determine how many points James earned during the quiz bowl, we will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of questions James answered correctly.**
   - Each round consists of 5 questions.
   - There are 5 rounds in total.
   - Therefore, the total number of questions is:
     \[
     5 \text{ rounds} \times 5 \text{ questions per round} = 25 \text{ questions}
     \]
   - James missed 1 question, so the number of questions he answered correctly is:
     \[
     25 \text{ questions} - 1 \text{ missed question} = 24 \text{ correct answers}
     \]

2. **Calculate the points earned from correct answers.**
   - Each correct answer earns 2 points.
   - Therefore, the points from correct answers are:
     \[
     24 \text{ correct answers} \times 2 \text{ points per answer} = 48 \text{ points}
     \]

3. **Determine if James received any bonus points.**
   - A bonus of 4 points is awarded if a student answers all questions correctly in a round.
   - Since James missed 1 question, he did not answer all questions correctly in any round. Therefore, he does not receive the bonus points.

4. **Calculate the total points.**
   - Since James did not receive any bonus points, his total points are simply the points from correct answers:
     \[
     \text{Total points} = 48 \text{ points} + 0 \text{ bonus points} = 48 \text{ points}
     \]

Thus, the total number of points James earned is:
\[
\boxed{48}
\]
