Question ID: 356
Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To find out how many points James earned, we need to break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the total number of questions**: 
   Each round consists of 5 questions, and there are 5 rounds. Therefore, the total number of questions is:
   \[
   5 \text{ rounds} \times 5 \text{ questions per round} = 25 \text{ questions}
   \]

2. **Calculate the number of correct answers**:
   James missed one question out of the total 25 questions. Therefore, the number of questions he answered correctly is:
   \[
   25 \text{ total questions} - 1 \text{ missed question} = 24 \text{ correct answers}
   \]

3. **Calculate the points from correct answers**:
   Each correct answer earns 2 points. Thus, the points from the correct answers are:
   \[
   24 \text{ correct answers} \times 2 \text{ points per correct answer} = 48 \text{ points}
   \]

4. **Determine if he earned the bonus**:
   The problem states that if a student correctly answers all the questions in a round, they receive an additional 4 point bonus. Since James missed one question, he did not answer all questions correctly in any round. Therefore, he does not receive the bonus points.

5. **Calculate the total points**:
   Since James did not receive any bonus points, his total points are simply the points from the correct answers:
   \[
   \text{Total points} = 48 \text{ points} + 0 \text{ bonus points} = 48 \text{ points}
   \]

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{48}
\]
