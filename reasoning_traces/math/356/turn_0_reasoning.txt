To solve the problem, we will break it down into several steps:

1. **Calculate the total cost of the toy cars**:
   - Dean bought 6 toy cars.
   - Each toy car costs $2.
   - Therefore, the total cost for the toy cars is:
     \[
     \text{Total cost of toy cars} = 6 \text{ cars} \times 2 \text{ dollars/car} = 12 \text{ dollars}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total cost of the teddy bears**:
   - Dean bought 5 teddy bears.
   - Each teddy bear costs $1.
   - Therefore, the total cost for the teddy bears is:
     \[
     \text{Total cost of teddy bears} = 5 \text{ bears} \times 1 \text{ dollar/bear} = 5 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total cost of all toys**:
   - Now we add the total costs of the toy cars and teddy bears:
     \[
     \text{Total cost of toys} = \text{Total cost of toy cars} + \text{Total cost of teddy bears} = 12 \text{ dollars} + 5 \text{ dollars} = 17 \text{ dollars}
     \]

4. **Calculate how much money Dean has after buying the toys**:
   - Dean's mother initially gave him $28.
   - After spending $17 on toys, the amount of money Dean has left is:
     \[
     \text{Money left} = \text{Initial amount} - \text{Total cost of toys} = 28 \text{ dollars} - 17 \text{ dollars} = 11 \text{ dollars}
     \]

5. **Add the extra money given by his mother**:
   - Dean's mother then gives him an extra $10.
   - Therefore, the total amount of money Dean has now is:
     \[
     \text{Total money now} = \text{Money left} + \text{Extra money} = 11 \text{ dollars} + 10 \text{ dollars} = 21 \text{ dollars}
     \]

6. **Final answer**:
   - The amount of money Dean has left after buying the toys and receiving the extra money is:
     \[
     \boxed{21 \text{ dollars}}
     \]
