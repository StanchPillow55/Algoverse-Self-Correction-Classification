Question ID: 356
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total points James earned during the quiz bowl, considering the scoring system and the fact that he missed one question.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Understand the Scoring System:**
   - Each correct answer earns 2 points.
   - If a student answers all questions correctly in a round, they receive an additional 4-point bonus.

2. **Determine the Total Number of Questions:**
   - There are 5 rounds, each consisting of 5 questions.
   - Total questions = 5 rounds × 5 questions/round = 25 questions.

3. **Calculate the Number of Correct Answers:**
   - James missed 1 question, so he answered 25 - 1 = 24 questions correctly.

4. **Calculate Points from Correct Answers:**
   - Each correct answer earns 2 points.
   - Points from correct answers = 24 correct answers × 2 points/correct answer = 48 points.

5. **Determine the Number of Rounds with All Correct Answers:**
   - Since James missed only 1 question, he must have answered all questions correctly in some rounds.
   - If he missed 1 question, it could have been in any one of the 5 rounds. Therefore, he answered all questions correctly in 4 rounds.

6. **Calculate Bonus Points:**
   - For each round with all correct answers, James earns a 4-point bonus.
   - Bonus points = 4 rounds × 4 points/round = 16 points.

7. **Calculate Total Points:**
   - Total points = Points from correct answers + Bonus points
   - Total points = 48 points + 16 points = 64 points.

### Final Answer:
James earned a total of 64 points.
