Question ID: 356
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To determine how many points James earned during the quiz bowl, we need to break down the problem step by step.

1. **Understanding the scoring system**:
   - Each correct answer earns 2 points.
   - If a student answers all questions correctly in a round, they receive an additional 4-point bonus.

2. **Total number of questions**:
   - There are 5 rounds, and each round consists of 5 questions.
   - Therefore, the total number of questions is:
     \[
     5 \text{ rounds} \times 5 \text{ questions/round} = 25 \text{ questions}
     \]

3. **James's performance**:
   - James missed 1 question out of the 25.
   - This means he answered:
     \[
     25 \text{ questions} - 1 \text{ missed question} = 24 \text{ correct answers}
     \]

4. **Calculating points from correct answers**:
   - For each correct answer, James earns 2 points. Thus, the points from his correct answers are:
     \[
     24 \text{ correct answers} \times 2 \text{ points/correct answer} = 48 \text{ points}
     \]

5. **Determining bonus points**:
   - James answered all questions correctly in 4 out of the 5 rounds (since he missed 1 question in one of the rounds).
   - Therefore, he receives a 4-point bonus for each of those 4 rounds:
     \[
     4 \text{ rounds} \times 4 \text{ points/round} = 16 \text{ bonus points}
     \]

6. **Calculating total points**:
   - Now, we add the points from correct answers and the bonus points:
     \[
     48 \text{ points from correct answers} + 16 \text{ bonus points} = 64 \text{ total points}
     \]

Thus, the total number of points James earned during the quiz bowl is:

\[
\boxed{64}
\]
