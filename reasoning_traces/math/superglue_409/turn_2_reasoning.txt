Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem effectively, let's first understand what "Sample reasoning question 409" might entail. Since the problem statement is not explicitly provided, I'll assume a generic math problem-solving approach and demonstrate how to tackle a typical reasoning question step by step.

### Step 1: Understand the Problem
Without a specific problem statement, let's assume a typical math reasoning question involves logical deduction or numerical calculation. For example, let's consider a problem involving arithmetic sequences:

**Problem Example**: Find the 10th term of an arithmetic sequence where the first term is 5 and the common difference is 3.

### Step 2: Identify Known Information
From the example problem:
- First term (\(a_1\)) = 5
- Common difference (\(d\)) = 3
- We need to find the 10th term (\(a_{10}\)).

### Step 3: Use the Formula for the nth Term of an Arithmetic Sequence
The formula for the nth term (\(a_n\)) of an arithmetic sequence is:
\[ a_n = a_1 + (n-1) \times d \]

### Step 4: Substitute Known Values into the Formula
Substitute the known values into the formula to find the 10th term:
\[ a_{10} = 5 + (10-1) \times 3 \]

### Step 5: Perform the Calculation
Calculate the expression step by step:
1. Calculate \(10 - 1\):
   \[ 10 - 1 = 9 \]
2. Multiply the result by the common difference:
   \[ 9 \times 3 = 27 \]
3. Add the result to the first term:
   \[ 5 + 27 = 32 \]

### Step 6: State the Final Answer
The 10th term of the arithmetic sequence is 32.

### Conclusion
By following these steps, we have determined that the 10th term of the given arithmetic sequence is 32. This methodical approach ensures that all calculations are transparent and logical reasoning is applied throughout the problem-solving process.
