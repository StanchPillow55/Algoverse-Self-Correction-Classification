==================================================

To solve the problem, I'll need more specific information about "Sample reasoning question 409" as it seems to be a placeholder or reference to a specific question that isn't provided here. However, I can guide you through a general approach to solving reasoning questions, especially if they are mathematical in nature.

### General Approach to Solving a Mathematical Reasoning Problem:

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - Carefully read the problem statement.
   - Identify what is being asked.
   - Note any given data or conditions.

2. **Devise a Plan:**
   - Determine the type of problem (e.g., algebra, geometry, probability).
   - Consider possible strategies (e.g., drawing a diagram, creating an equation).

3. **Carry Out the Plan:**
   - Execute the chosen strategy step by step.
   - Perform calculations carefully.
   - Keep track of units and ensure consistency.

4. **Review/Check Your Work:**
   - Verify each step for accuracy.
   - Ensure the solution meets all conditions of the problem.
   - Check if the answer makes sense in the context of the problem.

5. **State the Final Answer:**
   - Clearly present the solution.
   - Include units if applicable.

### Example Problem and Solution:

Since I don't have the specifics of "Sample reasoning question 409," I'll create a simple example problem to demonstrate the process.

**Example Problem:**
A rectangle has a length that is twice its width. If the perimeter of the rectangle is 36 units, what are the dimensions of the rectangle?

**Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We need to find the length and width of the rectangle.
   - Given: Length = 2 Ã— Width, Perimeter = 36 units.

2. **Devise a Plan:**
   - Use the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle: \( P = 2 \times (\text{Length} + \text{Width}) \).

3. **Carry Out the Plan:**
   - Let \( W \) be the width. Then the length \( L = 2W \).
   - Substitute into the perimeter formula: 
     \[
     36 = 2 \times (2W + W)
     \]
   - Simplify and solve for \( W \):
     \[
     36 = 2 \times 3W
     \]
     \[
     36 = 6W
     \]
     \[
     W = \frac{36}{6} = 6
     \]
   - Find the length using \( L = 2W \):
     \[
     L = 2 \times 6 = 12
     \]

4. **Review/Check Your Work:**
   - Check the perimeter with these dimensions:
     \[
     P = 2 \times (12 + 6) = 2 \times 18 = 36
     \]
   - The calculations are correct.

5. **State the Final Answer:**
   - The width of the rectangle is 6 units, and the length is 12 units.

If you can provide the specific details of "Sample reasoning question 409," I can offer a more tailored solution.
