==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 409" entails. Since the problem statement is not specific, I'll assume it's a generic math problem that involves logical reasoning or numerical calculations. Let's create a hypothetical problem and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**

Let's say "Sample reasoning question 409" involves the following scenario:

You have a sequence of numbers where each number is the sum of the previous two numbers. The sequence starts with 2 and 3. What is the 10th number in this sequence?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Identify the Sequence Pattern:**
   - The sequence is defined such that each number is the sum of the two preceding numbers. This is similar to the Fibonacci sequence but starts with different initial numbers.

2. **Write Down the Initial Numbers:**
   - First number: 2
   - Second number: 3

3. **Calculate the Next Numbers in the Sequence:**
   - Third number: 2 + 3 = 5
   - Fourth number: 3 + 5 = 8
   - Fifth number: 5 + 8 = 13
   - Sixth number: 8 + 13 = 21
   - Seventh number: 13 + 21 = 34
   - Eighth number: 21 + 34 = 55
   - Ninth number: 34 + 55 = 89
   - Tenth number: 55 + 89 = 144

4. **Verify the Calculations:**
   - Go through each step to ensure the additions are correct.

5. **State the Final Answer:**
   - The 10th number in the sequence is 144.

**Final Answer:**

The 10th number in the sequence is 144.
