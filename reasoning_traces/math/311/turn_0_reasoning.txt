To solve the problem, we will follow the steps outlined in the question and keep track of the number of people on the bus and the number of empty seats at each stage.

### Step 1: Calculate the total number of seats on the bus.
The bus has 23 rows of 4 seats each. Therefore, the total number of seats can be calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Total seats} = \text{Number of rows} \times \text{Number of seats per row} = 23 \times 4 = 92
\]

### Step 2: Determine the number of people on the bus after the initial boarding.
Initially, 16 people climb onto the bus. Thus, the number of people on the bus after the initial boarding is:

\[
\text{People after initial boarding} = 16
\]

### Step 3: Account for the first stop.
At the first stop, 15 people board the bus and 3 people get off. We can calculate the number of people on the bus after this stop:

1. **People boarding**: 15
2. **People getting off**: 3

The change in the number of people can be calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Change in people} = \text{People boarding} - \text{People getting off} = 15 - 3 = 12
\]

Now, we add this change to the number of people already on the bus:

\[
\text{People after first stop} = \text{People after initial boarding} + \text{Change in people} = 16 + 12 = 28
\]

### Step 4: Account for the second stop.
At the second stop, 17 people board the bus and 10 people get off. We will again calculate the change in the number of people:

1. **People boarding**: 17
2. **People getting off**: 10

The change in the number of people can be calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Change in people} = \text{People boarding} - \text{People getting off} = 17 - 10 = 7
\]

Now, we add this change to the number of people already on the bus after the first stop:

\[
\text{People after second stop} = \text{People after first stop} + \text{Change in people} = 28 + 7 = 35
\]

### Step 5: Calculate the number of empty seats.
Now that we know there are 35 people on the bus, we can find the number of empty seats by subtracting the number of people from the total number of seats:

\[
\text{Empty seats} = \text{Total seats} - \text{People after second stop} = 92 - 35 = 57
\]

### Final Answer:
The number of empty seats after the second stop is:

\[
\boxed{57}
\]
