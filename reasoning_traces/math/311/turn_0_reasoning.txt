==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to determine how many eggs the family consumes in a week based on the daily consumption of eggs by its members.

1. **Identify the family members and their egg consumption:**
   - There are 5 family members in total.
   - Three of them eat 3 eggs each day.
   - The remaining two family members eat 2 eggs each day.

2. **Calculate the daily egg consumption for each group:**
   - For the three family members who eat 3 eggs each:
     \[
     \text{Eggs consumed by 3 members} = 3 \text{ members} \times 3 \text{ eggs/member} = 9 \text{ eggs}
     \]
   - For the two family members who eat 2 eggs each:
     \[
     \text{Eggs consumed by 2 members} = 2 \text{ members} \times 2 \text{ eggs/member} = 4 \text{ eggs}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total daily egg consumption for the family:**
   - Now, we add the eggs consumed by both groups:
     \[
     \text{Total eggs consumed daily} = 9 \text{ eggs} + 4 \text{ eggs} = 13 \text{ eggs}
     \]

4. **Calculate the weekly egg consumption:**
   - Since the family eats eggs every day, we need to find out how many eggs they consume in a week (7 days):
     \[
     \text{Total eggs consumed in a week} = 13 \text{ eggs/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 91 \text{ eggs}
     \]

5. **Final answer:**
   - The total number of eggs the family will consume in a week is:
     \[
     \boxed{91}
     \]
