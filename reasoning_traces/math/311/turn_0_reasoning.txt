To solve this problem, we need to determine how many people are on the bus after the second stop and then calculate how many seats are empty.

### Step 1: Calculate the total number of seats on the bus.

The bus has 23 rows of 4 seats each. To find the total number of seats, we multiply the number of rows by the number of seats per row:

\[
23 \text{ rows} \times 4 \text{ seats per row} = 92 \text{ seats}
\]

### Step 2: Determine the number of people on the bus at the start.

Initially, 16 people climb onto the bus. Therefore, at the start, there are:

\[
16 \text{ people}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the number of people on the bus after the first stop.

At the first stop, 15 people board the bus and 3 people get off. We need to adjust the number of people on the bus accordingly:

- People boarding: 15
- People getting off: 3

The change in the number of people is:

\[
15 - 3 = 12 \text{ additional people}
\]

Adding this to the initial number of people:

\[
16 + 12 = 28 \text{ people after the first stop}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the number of people on the bus after the second stop.

At the second stop, 17 people get on the bus and 10 people get off. Again, we adjust the number of people on the bus:

- People boarding: 17
- People getting off: 10

The change in the number of people is:

\[
17 - 10 = 7 \text{ additional people}
\]

Adding this to the number of people after the first stop:

\[
28 + 7 = 35 \text{ people after the second stop}
\]

### Step 5: Calculate the number of empty seats.

Now, we know there are 35 people on the bus and a total of 92 seats. The number of empty seats is the total number of seats minus the number of people:

\[
92 - 35 = 57 \text{ empty seats}
\]

### Final Answer:

After the second stop, there are \(\boxed{57}\) empty seats on the bus.
