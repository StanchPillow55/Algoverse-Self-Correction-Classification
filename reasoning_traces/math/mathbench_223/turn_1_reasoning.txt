==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 223," we first need to understand what the problem is asking. Since the problem statement is not provided, I'll assume a generic math problem and demonstrate how to solve it step by step. Let's assume the problem is as follows:

**Problem:** Solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).

**Step 1: Understand the Equation**

The equation given is a simple linear equation in one variable, \( x \). Our goal is to isolate \( x \) on one side of the equation to find its value.

**Step 2: Isolate the Variable**

To isolate \( x \), we need to perform operations that will leave \( x \) by itself on one side of the equation. We start by eliminating the constant term on the left side of the equation.

- Subtract 3 from both sides of the equation to remove the constant term from the left side:

  \[
  2x + 3 - 3 = 11 - 3
  \]

  Simplifying both sides gives:

  \[
  2x = 8
  \]

**Step 3: Solve for \( x \)**

Now, we need to solve for \( x \) by getting rid of the coefficient of \( x \), which is 2. We do this by dividing both sides of the equation by 2:

- Divide both sides by 2:

  \[
  \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{8}{2}
  \]

  Simplifying both sides gives:

  \[
  x = 4
  \]

**Step 4: Verify the Solution**

To ensure our solution is correct, we substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation and check if both sides are equal:

- Substitute \( x = 4 \) into the original equation:

  \[
  2(4) + 3 = 11
  \]

  Simplifying the left side gives:

  \[
  8 + 3 = 11
  \]

  Since both sides of the equation are equal, our solution is verified.

**Final Answer:**

The solution to the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \) is \( x = 4 \).
