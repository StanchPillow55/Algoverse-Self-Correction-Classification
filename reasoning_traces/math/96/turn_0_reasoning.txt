==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to determine how many hours James slept and then find the difference between the hours Harry and James slept.

1. **Determine how many hours James slept**:
   - We know that Harry slept for 9 hours.
   - James slept only \( \frac{2}{3} \) of what Harry slept.
   - To find out how many hours James slept, we calculate:
     \[
     \text{James's sleep} = \frac{2}{3} \times \text{Harry's sleep}
     \]
     Substituting Harry's sleep:
     \[
     \text{James's sleep} = \frac{2}{3} \times 9
     \]

2. **Perform the multiplication**:
   - To calculate \( \frac{2}{3} \times 9 \), we can rewrite 9 as a fraction:
     \[
     9 = \frac{9}{1}
     \]
   - Now we multiply:
     \[
     \frac{2}{3} \times \frac{9}{1} = \frac{2 \times 9}{3 \times 1} = \frac{18}{3}
     \]
   - Now we simplify \( \frac{18}{3} \):
     \[
     \frac{18}{3} = 6
     \]
   - Therefore, James slept for 6 hours.

3. **Find the difference in sleep hours**:
   - Now we need to find out how many more hours Harry slept than James:
     \[
     \text{Difference} = \text{Harry's sleep} - \text{James's sleep}
     \]
   - Substituting the values we have:
     \[
     \text{Difference} = 9 - 6
     \]

4. **Calculate the difference**:
   \[
   9 - 6 = 3
   \]

Thus, Harry slept 3 more hours than James.

**Final Answer**: Harry slept 3 more hours than James.
