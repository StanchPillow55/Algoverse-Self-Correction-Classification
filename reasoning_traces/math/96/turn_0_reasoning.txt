==================================================

First, we need to determine how much water James collected in total. We know that for each inch of rain, he collects 15 gallons. So, for 4 inches of rain on Monday, he collected 4 * 15 = 60 gallons. On Tuesday, it rained 3 inches, so he collected 3 * 15 = 45 gallons.

Adding these two amounts together, we find that James collected a total of 60 + 45 = 105 gallons of water.

We know that James can sell water for $1.2 per gallon. So, to find out how much money he made from selling all the water, we multiply the total amount of water by the price per gallon: 105 * $1.2 = $126.

So, James made $126 from selling all the water.
