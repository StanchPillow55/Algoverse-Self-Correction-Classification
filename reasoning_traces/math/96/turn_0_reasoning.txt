==================================================

To solve the problem, we will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total amount of rain collected in inches.**
2. **Convert the total inches of rain into gallons.**
3. **Calculate the total revenue from selling the water.**

### Step 1: Calculate the total amount of rain collected

On Monday, it rained 4 inches, and on Tuesday, it rained 3 inches. We can find the total inches of rain by adding these two amounts together:

\[
\text{Total rain (inches)} = \text{Rain on Monday} + \text{Rain on Tuesday} = 4 \text{ inches} + 3 \text{ inches} = 7 \text{ inches}
\]

### Step 2: Convert the total inches of rain into gallons

We know that for each inch of rain, James collects 15 gallons of water. Therefore, we can calculate the total gallons collected from the 7 inches of rain:

\[
\text{Total gallons} = \text{Total rain (inches)} \times \text{Gallons per inch} = 7 \text{ inches} \times 15 \text{ gallons/inch}
\]

Calculating this gives:

\[
\text{Total gallons} = 7 \times 15 = 105 \text{ gallons}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the total revenue from selling the water

James sells the water for $1.2 per gallon. To find the total revenue, we multiply the total gallons collected by the price per gallon:

\[
\text{Total revenue} = \text{Total gallons} \times \text{Price per gallon} = 105 \text{ gallons} \times 1.2 \text{ dollars/gallon}
\]

Calculating this gives:

\[
\text{Total revenue} = 105 \times 1.2 = 126 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Final Answer

Thus, the total amount of money James made from selling all the water is:

\[
\boxed{126 \text{ dollars}}
\]
