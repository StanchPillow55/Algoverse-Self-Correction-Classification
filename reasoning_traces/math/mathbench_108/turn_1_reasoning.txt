Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem labeled "Sample math problem 108," we need to first understand what the problem is asking. However, since the problem statement is not provided, I'll demonstrate how to approach a generic math problem by solving a sample problem.

Let's assume the problem is as follows:

**Sample Math Problem 108:**
Find the value of \( x \) in the equation \( 3x + 5 = 20 \).

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Understand the Equation:**
   The equation given is \( 3x + 5 = 20 \). This is a linear equation in one variable, \( x \).

2. **Isolate the Variable:**
   To solve for \( x \), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We can do this by performing inverse operations.

3. **Subtract 5 from Both Sides:**
   \[
   3x + 5 - 5 = 20 - 5
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   3x = 15
   \]

4. **Divide Both Sides by 3:**
   \[
   \frac{3x}{3} = \frac{15}{3}
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   x = 5
   \]

5. **Verify the Solution:**
   Substitute \( x = 5 \) back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies the equation:
   \[
   3(5) + 5 = 20
   \]
   \[
   15 + 5 = 20
   \]
   \[
   20 = 20
   \]
   Since both sides of the equation are equal, our solution is verified.

### Final Answer:
The value of \( x \) is \( 5 \).

This step-by-step approach can be applied to solve other linear equations or different types of math problems by adjusting the operations according to the given problem. If you have a specific problem labeled "Sample math problem 108," please provide the details, and I will solve it accordingly.
