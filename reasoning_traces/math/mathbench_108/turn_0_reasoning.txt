To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample math problem 108" refers to. Since the problem statement is not provided, I'll assume a common type of math problem that involves the number 108. Let's consider a problem involving the factors of 108, which is a typical math problem.

**Problem:**
Find all the factors of 108 and determine if 108 is a perfect square.

**Step 1: Prime Factorization of 108**

To find the factors of 108, we first perform its prime factorization.

1. Start by dividing 108 by the smallest prime number, which is 2:
   \[
   108 \div 2 = 54
   \]
   So, 2 is a factor.

2. Divide 54 by 2 again:
   \[
   54 \div 2 = 27
   \]
   So, 2 is a factor again.

3. Now, divide 27 by the next smallest prime number, which is 3:
   \[
   27 \div 3 = 9
   \]
   So, 3 is a factor.

4. Divide 9 by 3:
   \[
   9 \div 3 = 3
   \]
   So, 3 is a factor again.

5. Finally, divide 3 by 3:
   \[
   3 \div 3 = 1
   \]
   So, 3 is a factor again.

The prime factorization of 108 is \(2^2 \times 3^3\).

**Step 2: Finding All Factors**

To find all factors of 108, we consider all combinations of its prime factors:

- \(2^0 \times 3^0 = 1\)
- \(2^1 \times 3^0 = 2\)
- \(2^2 \times 3^0 = 4\)
- \(2^0 \times 3^1 = 3\)
- \(2^1 \times 3^1 = 6\)
- \(2^2 \times 3^1 = 12\)
- \(2^0 \times 3^2 = 9\)
- \(2^1 \times 3^2 = 18\)
- \(2^2 \times 3^2 = 36\)
- \(2^0 \times 3^3 = 27\)
- \(2^1 \times 3^3 = 54\)
- \(2^2 \times 3^3 = 108\)

Thus, the factors of 108 are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, 18, 27, 36, 54, and 108.

**Step 3: Determine if 108 is a Perfect Square**

A number is a perfect square if all the exponents in its prime factorization are even. The prime factorization of 108 is \(2^2 \times 3^3\). The exponent of 3 is odd, so 108 is not a perfect square.

**Final Answer:**

The factors of 108 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, 18, 27, 36, 54, and 108. 108 is not a perfect square.
