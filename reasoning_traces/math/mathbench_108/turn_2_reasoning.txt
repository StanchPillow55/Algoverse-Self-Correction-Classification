==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample math problem 108" refers to. Since the problem itself isn't specified, I'll create a hypothetical math problem involving the number 108 and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**
Find the prime factorization of 108 and determine the number of divisors it has.

**Step 1: Prime Factorization of 108**

To find the prime factorization of 108, we start by dividing it by the smallest prime number, which is 2.

1. \( 108 \div 2 = 54 \)

Since 54 is even, we divide by 2 again:

2. \( 54 \div 2 = 27 \)

27 is not divisible by 2, so we move to the next smallest prime number, which is 3.

3. \( 27 \div 3 = 9 \)

9 is divisible by 3:

4. \( 9 \div 3 = 3 \)

Finally, 3 is divisible by 3:

5. \( 3 \div 3 = 1 \)

Thus, the prime factorization of 108 is:

\[ 108 = 2^2 \times 3^3 \]

**Step 2: Determine the Number of Divisors**

To find the number of divisors of a number given its prime factorization, we use the formula:

If \( n = p_1^{a_1} \times p_2^{a_2} \times \ldots \times p_k^{a_k} \), then the number of divisors \( D(n) \) is:

\[ D(n) = (a_1 + 1)(a_2 + 1) \ldots (a_k + 1) \]

For 108, the prime factorization is \( 2^2 \times 3^3 \). Therefore, the exponents are 2 and 3.

Using the formula:

\[ D(108) = (2 + 1)(3 + 1) = 3 \times 4 = 12 \]

**Conclusion:**

The prime factorization of 108 is \( 2^2 \times 3^3 \), and it has 12 divisors.

**Final Answer:**

The prime factorization of 108 is \( 2^2 \times 3^3 \), and the number of divisors is 12.
