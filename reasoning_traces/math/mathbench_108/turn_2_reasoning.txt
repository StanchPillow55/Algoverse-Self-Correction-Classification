Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we first need to understand what "Sample math problem 108" refers to. Since the problem is not explicitly stated, I'll assume it's a placeholder for a specific math problem. Let's create a hypothetical math problem and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem 108:**

"Calculate the sum of the first 108 positive integers."

To solve this problem, we can use the formula for the sum of the first \( n \) positive integers:

\[
S_n = \frac{n(n + 1)}{2}
\]

where \( S_n \) is the sum of the first \( n \) integers.

**Step-by-step Solution:**

1. **Identify \( n \):**  
   In this problem, \( n = 108 \).

2. **Apply the formula:**  
   Substitute \( n = 108 \) into the formula:

   \[
   S_{108} = \frac{108(108 + 1)}{2}
   \]

3. **Calculate \( 108 + 1 \):**  
   \[
   108 + 1 = 109
   \]

4. **Multiply 108 by 109:**  
   \[
   108 \times 109 = 11772
   \]

5. **Divide by 2:**  
   \[
   \frac{11772}{2} = 5886
   \]

Thus, the sum of the first 108 positive integers is 5886.

**Final Answer:**

The sum of the first 108 positive integers is 5886.
