==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample math problem 484" refers to. Since the problem itself is not provided, I will assume a hypothetical math problem labeled as "Sample math problem 484" and solve it step by step.

Let's assume "Sample math problem 484" is as follows:

**Problem:**  
Calculate the sum of all even numbers between 1 and 100.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Identify the Even Numbers:**
   Even numbers between 1 and 100 are numbers that are divisible by 2. These numbers start from 2 and go up to 100.

2. **List the Even Numbers:**
   The even numbers between 1 and 100 are: 2, 4, 6, 8, ..., 100.

3. **Determine the Sequence:**
   This is an arithmetic sequence where the first term \( a_1 = 2 \) and the last term \( a_n = 100 \). The common difference \( d = 2 \).

4. **Find the Number of Terms:**
   The formula for the \( n \)-th term of an arithmetic sequence is:
   \[
   a_n = a_1 + (n-1) \cdot d
   \]
   Plugging in the known values:
   \[
   100 = 2 + (n-1) \cdot 2
   \]
   \[
   100 = 2 + 2n - 2
   \]
   \[
   100 = 2n
   \]
   \[
   n = 50
   \]
   So, there are 50 even numbers between 1 and 100.

5. **Calculate the Sum of the Sequence:**
   The sum \( S_n \) of an arithmetic sequence can be calculated using the formula:
   \[
   S_n = \frac{n}{2} \cdot (a_1 + a_n)
   \]
   Plugging in the values:
   \[
   S_{50} = \frac{50}{2} \cdot (2 + 100)
   \]
   \[
   S_{50} = 25 \cdot 102
   \]
   \[
   S_{50} = 2550
   \]

**Final Answer:**
The sum of all even numbers between 1 and 100 is 2550.
