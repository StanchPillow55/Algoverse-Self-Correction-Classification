Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we first need to understand what "Sample math problem 484" refers to. Since the problem itself is not directly provided, I'll create a hypothetical math problem based on the number 484 and solve it step by step.

Let's assume the problem is as follows:

**Problem:** Determine if the number 484 is a perfect square. If it is, find the square root.

**Step 1: Understanding Perfect Squares**

A perfect square is an integer that is the square of an integer. In other words, if \( n^2 = m \), then \( m \) is a perfect square, and \( n \) is the square root of \( m \).

**Step 2: Estimating the Square Root**

To determine if 484 is a perfect square, we can start by estimating its square root. We know that:

- \( 20^2 = 400 \)
- \( 25^2 = 625 \)

Since 484 is between 400 and 625, its square root should be between 20 and 25.

**Step 3: Finding the Exact Square Root**

Let's try squaring numbers between 20 and 25 to find the exact square root of 484.

- \( 21^2 = 441 \)
- \( 22^2 = 484 \)
- \( 23^2 = 529 \)

We find that \( 22^2 = 484 \). Therefore, 484 is a perfect square, and its square root is 22.

**Step 4: Verification**

To ensure our solution is correct, let's verify by squaring 22:

\[ 22 \times 22 = 22 \times (20 + 2) = 22 \times 20 + 22 \times 2 \]

Calculating each part:

\[ 22 \times 20 = 440 \]
\[ 22 \times 2 = 44 \]

Adding these results:

\[ 440 + 44 = 484 \]

The calculations confirm that \( 22^2 = 484 \).

**Final Answer:**

The number 484 is a perfect square, and its square root is 22.
