==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 484," we need to first understand what the problem is asking. Since "Sample math problem 484" is not a standard math problem description, I will assume it refers to a specific problem that needs to be solved. However, without additional context or details about what "Sample math problem 484" entails, I will create a hypothetical math problem involving the number 484 and solve it.

Let's assume the problem is as follows:

**Problem:** Determine whether the number 484 is a perfect square. If it is, find the square root of 484.

**Step-by-step Solution:**

1. **Understanding Perfect Squares:**
   A perfect square is an integer that is the square of another integer. In other words, if \( n^2 = m \), then \( m \) is a perfect square, and \( n \) is the square root of \( m \).

2. **Checking if 484 is a Perfect Square:**
   To determine if 484 is a perfect square, we need to find an integer \( n \) such that \( n^2 = 484 \).

3. **Estimating the Square Root:**
   We know that \( 20^2 = 400 \) and \( 25^2 = 625 \). Since 484 is between 400 and 625, the square root of 484 should be between 20 and 25.

4. **Finding the Exact Square Root:**
   Let's test integers between 20 and 25 to find the exact square root of 484.

   - \( 21^2 = 21 \times 21 = 441 \)
   - \( 22^2 = 22 \times 22 = 484 \)
   - \( 23^2 = 23 \times 23 = 529 \)

   We find that \( 22^2 = 484 \).

5. **Conclusion:**
   Since \( 22^2 = 484 \), 484 is indeed a perfect square, and its square root is 22.

**Final Answer:**
The number 484 is a perfect square, and its square root is 22.
