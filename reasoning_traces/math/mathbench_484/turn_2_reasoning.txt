Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we first need to understand what "Sample math problem 484" refers to. Since the problem is not explicitly stated, I'll assume it involves a mathematical operation or concept related to the number 484. Let's explore a few possibilities:

### Possibility 1: Check if 484 is a Perfect Square
One common type of problem involving numbers is determining if a number is a perfect square. A perfect square is an integer that is the square of another integer.

1. **Calculate the square root of 484:**
   \[
   \sqrt{484} = 22
   \]

2. **Verify:**
   \[
   22 \times 22 = 484
   \]

Since 22 is an integer and \(22 \times 22 = 484\), 484 is indeed a perfect square.

### Possibility 2: Factorization of 484
Another common problem is to find the prime factorization of a number.

1. **Divide by the smallest prime number, 2:**
   \[
   484 \div 2 = 242
   \]

2. **Divide 242 by 2:**
   \[
   242 \div 2 = 121
   \]

3. **Check if 121 is divisible by 2:**
   121 is not divisible by 2 (since it's odd), so we try the next smallest prime, 3. It is not divisible by 3 either (sum of digits is 4, not divisible by 3).

4. **Check divisibility by 5:**
   121 does not end in 0 or 5, so it's not divisible by 5.

5. **Check divisibility by 7:**
   \[
   121 \div 7 \approx 17.2857 \quad (\text{not an integer})
   \]

6. **Check divisibility by 11:**
   121 is divisible by 11 because:
   \[
   121 \div 11 = 11
   \]

7. **Complete factorization:**
   \[
   484 = 2 \times 2 \times 11 \times 11 = 2^2 \times 11^2
   \]

### Possibility 3: Sum of Digits
Another simple problem could involve finding the sum of the digits of 484.

1. **Identify the digits:**
   The digits of 484 are 4, 8, and 4.

2. **Calculate the sum:**
   \[
   4 + 8 + 4 = 16
   \]

### Conclusion
Without a specific problem statement, we explored several mathematical properties and operations involving the number 484. Here are the findings:

- 484 is a perfect square (\(22^2\)).
- The prime factorization of 484 is \(2^2 \times 11^2\).
- The sum of the digits of 484 is 16.

If you have a specific problem or context in mind, please provide more details for a targeted solution.
