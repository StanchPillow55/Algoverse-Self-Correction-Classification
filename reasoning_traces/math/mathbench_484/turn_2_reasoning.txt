==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 484," we need to first understand what the problem is asking. Since the problem statement is not clear, I'll assume it's a generic math problem involving the number 484. Let's explore a few possibilities:

### Possibility 1: Checking if 484 is a Perfect Square

First, let's determine if 484 is a perfect square. A perfect square is a number that can be expressed as the square of an integer.

1. **Estimate the square root of 484:**
   - We know that \(20^2 = 400\) and \(25^2 = 625\).
   - Therefore, the square root of 484 should be between 20 and 25.

2. **Calculate the square root:**
   - Try \(22^2\):
     \[
     22^2 = 22 \times 22 = 484
     \]

Since \(22^2 = 484\), 484 is indeed a perfect square, and its square root is 22.

### Possibility 2: Prime Factorization of 484

Let's find the prime factorization of 484.

1. **Divide by the smallest prime number, 2:**
   \[
   484 \div 2 = 242
   \]
   \[
   242 \div 2 = 121
   \]

2. **Check if 121 is a prime number:**
   - 121 is not divisible by 2, 3, or 5.
   - Check divisibility by 11:
     - The sum of the digits of 121 is \(1 + 2 + 1 = 4\), which is not divisible by 11.
     - However, \(11 \times 11 = 121\).

Thus, 121 is \(11^2\).

3. **Combine the factors:**
   - The prime factorization of 484 is \(2^2 \times 11^2\).

### Possibility 3: Divisors of 484

Let's find all divisors of 484 using its prime factorization \(2^2 \times 11^2\).

1. **Use the formula for divisors:**
   - If \(n = p^a \times q^b\), the number of divisors is \((a+1)(b+1)\).

2. **Calculate the number of divisors:**
   - For 484, \((2+1)(2+1) = 3 \times 3 = 9\).

3. **List the divisors:**
   - The divisors are \(1, 2, 4, 11, 22, 44, 121, 242, 484\).

### Conclusion

Based on the possibilities explored, here are the key findings:

- 484 is a perfect square, and its square root is 22.
- The prime factorization of 484 is \(2^2 \times 11^2\).
- 484 has 9 divisors: \(1, 2, 4, 11, 22, 44, 121, 242, 484\).

If the original problem was different, please provide more details for a specific solution. Otherwise, these are the mathematical properties and insights related to the number 484.
