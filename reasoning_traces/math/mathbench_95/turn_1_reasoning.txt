==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 95," we need to first understand what the problem is asking. Since "Sample math problem 95" is not a standard math problem, I'll assume this is a placeholder for a specific problem that needs to be solved. Let's create a hypothetical math problem involving the number 95 and solve it step by step.

### Hypothetical Problem:
**Problem:** If 95 is divided by a number \( x \), the result is 19. What is the value of \( x \)?

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We are given that dividing 95 by some number \( x \) results in 19.
   - Mathematically, this can be expressed as:
     \[
     \frac{95}{x} = 19
     \]

2. **Set Up the Equation:**
   - To find \( x \), we need to solve the equation:
     \[
     \frac{95}{x} = 19
     \]

3. **Solve for \( x \):**
   - To isolate \( x \), multiply both sides of the equation by \( x \) to get rid of the fraction:
     \[
     95 = 19x
     \]
   - Next, divide both sides by 19 to solve for \( x \):
     \[
     x = \frac{95}{19}
     \]

4. **Perform the Division:**
   - Calculate \( \frac{95}{19} \):
     \[
     95 \div 19 = 5
     \]
   - Therefore, \( x = 5 \).

5. **Verify the Solution:**
   - To ensure our solution is correct, substitute \( x = 5 \) back into the original equation:
     \[
     \frac{95}{5} = 19
     \]
   - Calculate the left side:
     \[
     95 \div 5 = 19
     \]
   - Since both sides of the equation are equal, our solution is verified.

### Final Answer:
The value of \( x \) is 5.
