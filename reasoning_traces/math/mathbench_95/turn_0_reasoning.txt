==================================================

It seems like there might be a misunderstanding with the phrase "Sample math problem 95." This doesn't appear to be a specific math problem, but rather a reference or placeholder. To help you effectively, I need a clear math problem or question to solve. 

If you have a specific math problem in mind, please provide the details, and I'll be happy to work through it step by step.
