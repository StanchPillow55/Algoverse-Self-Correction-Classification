==================================================

To solve the problem, we will follow these steps:

1. **Determine the number of cookies Lani has after eating some.**
   - Lani baked a total of 55 cookies.
   - She ate 5 cookies.
   - To find out how many cookies are left after she ate some, we subtract the number of cookies she ate from the total number of cookies she baked.

   \[
   \text{Cookies left} = \text{Total cookies} - \text{Cookies eaten}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Cookies left} = 55 - 5 = 50
   \]

2. **Distribute the remaining cookies into jars.**
   - Lani placed the remaining cookies equally into 5 jars.
   - To find out how many cookies go into each jar, we divide the number of cookies left by the number of jars.

   \[
   \text{Cookies per jar} = \frac{\text{Cookies left}}{\text{Number of jars}}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Cookies per jar} = \frac{50}{5} = 10
   \]

3. **State the final answer.**
   - Each jar contains 10 cookies.

Thus, the final answer is that there are **10 cookies in each jar**.
