==================================================

To solve this problem, let's first clarify what "Sample reasoning question 157" might entail. Since no specific details are provided about the content of the question, I'll assume it's a typical math problem that requires logical reasoning and step-by-step calculations. I'll create a hypothetical math problem and solve it to demonstrate the process.

**Hypothetical Problem:**

A farmer has a rectangular field that is 100 meters long and 60 meters wide. He wants to divide the field into smaller, equal-sized square plots. What is the largest possible side length of each square plot?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We have a rectangular field with dimensions 100 meters by 60 meters.
   - We need to divide this field into square plots of equal size.
   - The goal is to find the largest possible side length for these square plots.

2. **Identify the Mathematical Approach:**
   - To find the largest possible side length of the square plots, we need to determine the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the two dimensions of the rectangle (100 meters and 60 meters).
   - The GCD will give us the largest integer that divides both dimensions without leaving a remainder, which corresponds to the largest possible side length of the square plots.

3. **Calculate the GCD:**
   - Use the Euclidean algorithm to find the GCD of 100 and 60.
   - Start with the larger number (100) and divide it by the smaller number (60):
     \[
     100 \div 60 = 1 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 40
     \]
   - Replace 100 with 60 and 60 with the remainder (40), then repeat the division:
     \[
     60 \div 40 = 1 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 20
     \]
   - Replace 60 with 40 and 40 with the remainder (20), then repeat the division:
     \[
     40 \div 20 = 2 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 0
     \]
   - Since the remainder is now 0, the last non-zero remainder (20) is the GCD.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The largest possible side length of each square plot is 20 meters.

**Final Answer:**
The largest possible side length of each square plot is 20 meters.
