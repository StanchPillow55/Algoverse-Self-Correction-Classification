==================================================

To solve the problem, I need more specific information about "Sample reasoning question 157." Since the question is not provided, I will outline a general approach to solving a typical math reasoning problem. If you have a specific problem in mind, please provide the details, and I can work through that specific problem.

### General Approach to Solving a Math Reasoning Problem

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - Carefully read the problem statement.
   - Identify what is being asked.
   - Determine what information is given and what needs to be found.

2. **Devise a Plan:**
   - Consider possible strategies to solve the problem, such as drawing a diagram, creating an equation, or breaking the problem into smaller parts.
   - Choose the most efficient strategy based on the given information.

3. **Carry Out the Plan:**
   - Execute the chosen strategy step by step.
   - Perform calculations carefully and check each step for accuracy.
   - Keep track of units and ensure consistency throughout the calculations.

4. **Review/Check the Solution:**
   - Verify that the solution answers the question posed in the problem.
   - Check calculations for errors.
   - Consider whether the answer is reasonable and makes sense in the context of the problem.

5. **State the Final Answer:**
   - Clearly state the final answer, including units if applicable.
   - Ensure that the answer is presented in the correct format as required by the problem.

### Example Problem

Let's consider an example problem to illustrate the process:

**Problem:** A rectangle has a length that is twice its width. If the perimeter of the rectangle is 36 units, what are the dimensions of the rectangle?

**Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We need to find the length and width of the rectangle.
   - We know that the length is twice the width and the perimeter is 36 units.

2. **Devise a Plan:**
   - Use the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle: \( P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width}) \).
   - Let the width be \( w \) and the length be \( 2w \).

3. **Carry Out the Plan:**
   - Substitute the expressions for length and width into the perimeter formula:
     \[
     36 = 2 \times (2w + w)
     \]
   - Simplify and solve for \( w \):
     \[
     36 = 2 \times 3w
     \]
     \[
     36 = 6w
     \]
     \[
     w = \frac{36}{6} = 6
     \]
   - Find the length using \( \text{length} = 2w \):
     \[
     \text{length} = 2 \times 6 = 12
     \]

4. **Review/Check the Solution:**
   - Check the perimeter with the found dimensions:
     \[
     P = 2 \times (12 + 6) = 2 \times 18 = 36
     \]
   - The calculations are correct, and the solution is consistent with the given information.

5. **State the Final Answer:**
   - The width of the rectangle is 6 units, and the length is 12 units.
