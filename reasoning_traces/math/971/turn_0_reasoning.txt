==================================================

To determine how many wooden slats Robert will need for his fence, we first need to calculate the total perimeter of the rectangular garden that he is enclosing with the fence.

1. **Calculate the perimeter of the rectangular garden**:
   The formula for the perimeter \( P \) of a rectangle is given by:
   \[
   P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width})
   \]

   In this case, the length of the garden is 15 feet and the width is 10 feet. Plugging in these values:
   \[
   P = 2 \times (15 \text{ ft} + 10 \text{ ft}) 
   \]
   \[
   P = 2 \times 25 \text{ ft} 
   \]
   \[
   P = 50 \text{ ft}
   \]

2. **Determine the number of wooden slats needed**:
   According to the problem, Robert needs 2 wood slats for every foot of fencing. Therefore, to find the total number of slats needed, we multiply the total perimeter by the number of slats per foot:
   \[
   \text{Total slats} = \text{Perimeter} \times \text{Slats per foot}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total slats} = 50 \text{ ft} \times 2 \text{ slats/ft}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total slats} = 100 \text{ slats}
   \]

3. **Final answer**:
   Robert will need a total of **100 wooden slats** to build the fence around his garden.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{100}
\]
