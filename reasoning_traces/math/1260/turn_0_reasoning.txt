==================================================

To determine how many days Jade will need to upload all of her photos, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of photos Jade can upload in one day.**
   - Jade uploads 7 photos in one batch.
   - She uploads 6 batches each day.
   - Therefore, the total number of photos uploaded in one day is calculated as follows:
     \[
     \text{Total photos per day} = \text{photos per batch} \times \text{number of batches per day} = 7 \times 6
     \]
   - Performing the multiplication:
     \[
     7 \times 6 = 42
     \]
   - So, Jade can upload 42 photos in one day.

2. **Determine how many days it will take to upload all 210 photos.**
   - We need to find out how many days are required to upload a total of 210 photos, given that she uploads 42 photos per day.
   - We can calculate the number of days by dividing the total number of photos by the number of photos uploaded per day:
     \[
     \text{Number of days} = \frac{\text{Total photos}}{\text{Total photos per day}} = \frac{210}{42}
     \]
   - Performing the division:
     \[
     \frac{210}{42} = 5
     \]

3. **Conclusion:**
   - Jade will need 5 days to upload all of her photos.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{5}
\]
