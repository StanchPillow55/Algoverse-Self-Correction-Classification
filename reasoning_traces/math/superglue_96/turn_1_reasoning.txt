==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 96" entails. However, since the problem statement is not provided, I will demonstrate a general approach to solving a typical math problem by breaking it down into steps. Let's assume a hypothetical math problem and solve it step-by-step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**

Calculate the area of a triangle with a base of 10 units and a height of 5 units.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We need to find the area of a triangle.
   - The formula for the area of a triangle is: 
     \[
     \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height}
     \]
   - We are given:
     - Base (\(b\)) = 10 units
     - Height (\(h\)) = 5 units

2. **Substitute the Given Values into the Formula:**
   - Substitute \(b = 10\) and \(h = 5\) into the area formula:
     \[
     \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times 10 \times 5
     \]

3. **Perform the Calculations:**
   - First, multiply the base and the height:
     \[
     10 \times 5 = 50
     \]
   - Then, multiply the result by \(\frac{1}{2}\):
     \[
     \frac{1}{2} \times 50 = 25
     \]

4. **State the Final Answer:**
   - The area of the triangle is 25 square units.

By following these steps, we have calculated the area of the triangle. This methodical approach ensures that we understand each part of the problem and apply the appropriate mathematical operations to arrive at the correct solution.

**Final Answer:**
The area of the triangle is 25 square units.
