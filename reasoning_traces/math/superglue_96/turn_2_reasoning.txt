Question ID: superglue_96
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we first need to understand what "Sample reasoning question 96" refers to. Since the problem statement doesn't provide specific details about the question, I'll demonstrate a general approach to solving a typical math problem by outlining the steps involved in reasoning through a mathematical problem.

Let's assume "Sample reasoning question 96" is a typical math problem involving algebra. Here's how we might approach it:

### Step 1: Understand the Problem
First, we need to identify what the problem is asking. Since we don't have the actual problem, let's assume it's a common algebra problem, such as solving for \( x \) in an equation.

### Step 2: Set Up the Equation
Assume the problem is: Solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).

### Step 3: Isolate the Variable
To solve for \( x \), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We can do this by performing inverse operations.

1. **Subtract 3 from both sides** to get rid of the constant term on the left side:
   \[
   2x + 3 - 3 = 11 - 3
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   2x = 8
   \]

2. **Divide both sides by 2** to solve for \( x \):
   \[
   \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{8}{2}
   \]
   Simplifying gives:
   \[
   x = 4
   \]

### Step 4: Verify the Solution
To ensure our solution is correct, we substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation:
\[
2(4) + 3 = 11
\]
Simplifying the left side:
\[
8 + 3 = 11
\]
Since both sides of the equation are equal, our solution \( x = 4 \) is verified.

### Final Answer
The solution to the assumed problem \( 2x + 3 = 11 \) is \( x = 4 \).
