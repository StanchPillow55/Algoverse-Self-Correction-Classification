==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 96" refers to. Since the question is not explicitly stated, I'll assume it involves a typical math problem-solving scenario. Let's create a hypothetical math problem and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**

A rectangle has a length that is 4 times its width. If the perimeter of the rectangle is 96 units, find the dimensions of the rectangle.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We have a rectangle with a length (L) and a width (W).
   - The length is 4 times the width: \( L = 4W \).
   - The perimeter of the rectangle is 96 units.

2. **Recall the Formula for Perimeter:**
   - The perimeter (P) of a rectangle is given by the formula: 
     \[
     P = 2L + 2W
     \]

3. **Substitute the Given Values:**
   - We know the perimeter is 96 units, so:
     \[
     2L + 2W = 96
     \]

4. **Substitute the Expression for L:**
   - Since \( L = 4W \), substitute \( L \) in the perimeter equation:
     \[
     2(4W) + 2W = 96
     \]

5. **Simplify the Equation:**
   - Simplify the left side:
     \[
     8W + 2W = 96
     \]
   - Combine like terms:
     \[
     10W = 96
     \]

6. **Solve for W:**
   - Divide both sides by 10 to solve for W:
     \[
     W = \frac{96}{10} = 9.6
     \]

7. **Find the Length L:**
   - Use the relationship \( L = 4W \):
     \[
     L = 4 \times 9.6 = 38.4
     \]

8. **Verify the Solution:**
   - Check if these dimensions satisfy the perimeter condition:
     \[
     2L + 2W = 2(38.4) + 2(9.6) = 76.8 + 19.2 = 96
     \]
   - The calculated perimeter matches the given perimeter, confirming our solution is correct.

**Final Answer:**

The dimensions of the rectangle are:
- Width (W) = 9.6 units
- Length (L) = 38.4 units
