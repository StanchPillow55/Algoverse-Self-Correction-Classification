To find out how much Ted spent in total, we need to calculate the cost of the books and the cost of the pencils separately, and then add those two amounts together.

**Step 1: Calculate the cost of the books.**

Ted buys 3 books, and each book costs $16. We can calculate the total cost of the books using the formula:

\[
\text{Total cost of books} = \text{Number of books} \times \text{Cost per book}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\text{Total cost of books} = 3 \times 16
\]

Now, we perform the multiplication:

\[
3 \times 16 = 48
\]

So, Ted spends $48 on books.

**Step 2: Calculate the cost of the pencils.**

Next, Ted buys 3 pencils, and each pencil costs $6. We can calculate the total cost of the pencils using a similar formula:

\[
\text{Total cost of pencils} = \text{Number of pencils} \times \text{Cost per pencil}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\text{Total cost of pencils} = 3 \times 6
\]

Now, we perform the multiplication:

\[
3 \times 6 = 18
\]

So, Ted spends $18 on pencils.

**Step 3: Calculate the total amount spent.**

Now, we add the total cost of the books and the total cost of the pencils to find the total amount Ted spent:

\[
\text{Total amount spent} = \text{Total cost of books} + \text{Total cost of pencils}
\]

Substituting the values we calculated:

\[
\text{Total amount spent} = 48 + 18
\]

Now, we perform the addition:

\[
48 + 18 = 66
\]

**Final Answer:**

Ted spent a total of **$66**.
