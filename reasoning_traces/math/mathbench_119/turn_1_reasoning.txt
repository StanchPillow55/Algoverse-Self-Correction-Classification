==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 119," we first need to understand what the problem is asking. However, since the problem statement is not provided, I'll demonstrate how to approach a generic math problem by creating a sample problem and solving it step by step.

**Sample Math Problem:**

Solve for \( x \) in the equation: 

\[ 3x + 5 = 20 \]

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Equation:**
   The equation given is a linear equation in one variable, \( x \). Our goal is to isolate \( x \) on one side of the equation to find its value.

2. **Isolate the Variable:**
   To isolate \( x \), we need to perform operations that will leave \( x \) alone on one side of the equation.

   - Start by eliminating the constant term on the left side of the equation. The constant term here is \( 5 \). We can do this by subtracting \( 5 \) from both sides of the equation:

     \[
     3x + 5 - 5 = 20 - 5
     \]

     Simplifying both sides gives:

     \[
     3x = 15
     \]

3. **Solve for \( x \):**
   Now, we need to solve for \( x \) by getting rid of the coefficient of \( x \), which is \( 3 \). We can do this by dividing both sides of the equation by \( 3 \):

   \[
   \frac{3x}{3} = \frac{15}{3}
   \]

   Simplifying both sides gives:

   \[
   x = 5
   \]

4. **Verify the Solution:**
   It's always a good practice to verify the solution by substituting the value of \( x \) back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies the equation.

   Substitute \( x = 5 \) back into the original equation:

   \[
   3(5) + 5 = 20
   \]

   Simplifying the left side gives:

   \[
   15 + 5 = 20
   \]

   \[
   20 = 20
   \]

   Since both sides of the equation are equal, our solution \( x = 5 \) is correct.

**Final Answer:**

The solution to the equation \( 3x + 5 = 20 \) is \( x = 5 \).
