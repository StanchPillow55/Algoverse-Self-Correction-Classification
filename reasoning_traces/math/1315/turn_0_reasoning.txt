To solve the problem, we need to determine how many oranges Ana and Jane can peel in one hour, and then find the difference between the number of oranges peeled by Ana and Jane.

1. **Determine the time each person takes to peel one orange:**
   - Ana takes 3 minutes to peel one orange.
   - Jane takes 4 minutes to peel one orange.

2. **Calculate how many oranges each person can peel in one hour:**
   - One hour is equal to 60 minutes.

   **For Ana:**
   - The number of oranges Ana can peel in one hour is calculated by dividing the total time available (60 minutes) by the time it takes her to peel one orange (3 minutes):
   \[
   \text{Number of oranges peeled by Ana} = \frac{60 \text{ minutes}}{3 \text{ minutes/orange}} = 20 \text{ oranges}
   \]

   **For Jane:**
   - The number of oranges Jane can peel in one hour is calculated similarly:
   \[
   \text{Number of oranges peeled by Jane} = \frac{60 \text{ minutes}}{4 \text{ minutes/orange}} = 15 \text{ oranges}
   \]

3. **Calculate the difference in the number of oranges peeled:**
   - To find out how many more oranges Ana has peeled than Jane, we subtract the number of oranges peeled by Jane from the number of oranges peeled by Ana:
   \[
   \text{Difference} = \text{Number of oranges peeled by Ana} - \text{Number of oranges peeled by Jane}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Difference} = 20 \text{ oranges} - 15 \text{ oranges} = 5 \text{ oranges}
   \]

4. **Final answer:**
   - After one hour, Ana will have peeled 5 more oranges than Jane.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{5}
\]
