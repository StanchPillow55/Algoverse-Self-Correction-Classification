==================================================

To solve "Sample math problem 247," I'll need to make some assumptions about the nature of the problem since the problem itself isn't specified. Let's assume it's a typical algebra problem involving solving an equation. I'll create a sample problem and solve it step by step.

**Sample Problem:**
Solve for \( x \) in the equation: 
\[ 3x + 5 = 2x + 9 \]

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   We need to find the value of \( x \) that makes the equation true.

2. **Simplify the Equation:**
   Start by getting all terms involving \( x \) on one side of the equation and constant terms on the other side. We can do this by subtracting \( 2x \) from both sides:
   \[
   3x + 5 - 2x = 2x + 9 - 2x
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   x + 5 = 9
   \]

3. **Isolate \( x \):**
   Next, subtract 5 from both sides to solve for \( x \):
   \[
   x + 5 - 5 = 9 - 5
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   x = 4
   \]

4. **Verify the Solution:**
   Substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies the equation:
   \[
   3(4) + 5 = 2(4) + 9
   \]
   Calculate each side:
   \[
   12 + 5 = 8 + 9
   \]
   \[
   17 = 17
   \]
   Since both sides are equal, \( x = 4 \) is indeed the correct solution.

**Final Answer:**
The solution to the equation \( 3x + 5 = 2x + 9 \) is \( x = 4 \).
