Question ID: mathbench_247
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 247," we first need to understand what the problem is asking. Since the problem is not explicitly stated, let's assume it involves basic arithmetic or algebra, as these are common types of math problems.

Let's create a hypothetical problem based on the number 247 and solve it step by step. Suppose the problem is:

**Problem:** If you multiply 247 by 3 and then subtract 150, what is the result?

**Step 1: Multiply 247 by 3.**

To multiply 247 by 3, we perform the following calculation:

\[
247 \times 3 = 741
\]

**Step 2: Subtract 150 from the result.**

Now, subtract 150 from 741:

\[
741 - 150 = 591
\]

**Final Answer:**

The result of multiplying 247 by 3 and then subtracting 150 is 591.

Therefore, the final answer to our hypothetical problem is 591.
