Question ID: mathbench_247
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we first need to understand what "Sample math problem 247" refers to. Since the problem itself is not provided, I'll assume this is a placeholder for a specific math problem. Without the actual problem, I can't provide a specific solution, but I can guide you through a general approach to solving math problems.

Here's a step-by-step guide on how to approach solving a typical math problem:

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - Read the problem carefully.
   - Identify what is being asked.
   - Determine what information is given and what needs to be found.

2. **Devise a Plan:**
   - Consider possible strategies to solve the problem. This could include algebraic manipulation, drawing a diagram, or breaking the problem into smaller parts.
   - Choose the most appropriate method based on the type of problem.

3. **Carry Out the Plan:**
   - Execute the steps you have planned.
   - Perform calculations carefully and systematically.
   - Keep track of your work to ensure accuracy.

4. **Review/Check Your Work:**
   - Verify each step to ensure there are no errors.
   - Check if the solution makes sense in the context of the problem.
   - If possible, use a different method to confirm the result.

5. **State the Final Answer:**
   - Clearly write down the final answer.
   - Ensure that the answer is in the correct units or format as required by the problem.

Since I don't have the specific details of "Sample math problem 247," I can't provide a detailed solution. However, if you provide the actual problem, I would be happy to work through it step by step and provide a complete solution.
