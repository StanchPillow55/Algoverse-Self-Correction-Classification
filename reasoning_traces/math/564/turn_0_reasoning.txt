To solve the problem, we need to calculate the total number of pages Judy read over the two weeks.

### Step 1: Calculate the total reading time in the first week

Judy read for 15 minutes each night for 7 nights in the first week. We can calculate the total reading time as follows:

\[
\text{Total reading time in the first week} = 15 \text{ minutes/night} \times 7 \text{ nights} = 105 \text{ minutes}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the number of pages read in the first week

We know that Judy reads 2 pages in 1.5 minutes. To find out how many pages she can read in 105 minutes, we first need to determine how many 1.5-minute intervals fit into 105 minutes.

\[
\text{Number of 1.5-minute intervals} = \frac{105 \text{ minutes}}{1.5 \text{ minutes/interval}} = 70 \text{ intervals}
\]

Now, since she reads 2 pages in each interval, we can calculate the total number of pages read in the first week:

\[
\text{Pages read in the first week} = 70 \text{ intervals} \times 2 \text{ pages/interval} = 140 \text{ pages}
\]

### Step 3: Add the pages read in the second week

In the second week, we are given that Judy read a total of 100 pages. 

### Step 4: Calculate the total pages read over the two weeks

Now, we can find the total number of pages read over both weeks by adding the pages from the first week and the second week:

\[
\text{Total pages read in two weeks} = \text{Pages read in the first week} + \text{Pages read in the second week}
\]

Substituting the values we calculated:

\[
\text{Total pages read in two weeks} = 140 \text{ pages} + 100 \text{ pages} = 240 \text{ pages}
\]

### Final Answer

Judy read a total of **240 pages** in two weeks.
