To determine how many pieces of pizza Tobias has eaten, we will break down the problem step by step.

1. **Total Pieces of Pizza**: 
   Tobias starts with a total of 60 pieces of pizza.

2. **Pieces Eaten on the First Day**: 
   Tobias eats \( \frac{2}{5} \) of the total pieces on the first day.
   \[
   \text{Pieces eaten on the first day} = \frac{2}{5} \times 60 = \frac{120}{5} = 24 \text{ pieces}
   \]

3. **Remaining Pieces After the First Day**: 
   After eating 24 pieces, the remaining pieces are:
   \[
   \text{Remaining pieces} = 60 - 24 = 36 \text{ pieces}
   \]

4. **Pieces Eaten on the Second Day**: 
   On the second day, Tobias eats 10 pieces.
   \[
   \text{Remaining pieces after second day} = 36 - 10 = 26 \text{ pieces}
   \]

5. **Pieces Eaten on the Third Day**: 
   On the third day, Tobias eats \( \frac{7}{13} \) of the remaining pieces. The remaining pieces after the second day are 26.
   \[
   \text{Pieces eaten on the third day} = \frac{7}{13} \times 26 = \frac{182}{13} = 14 \text{ pieces}
   \]

6. **Total Pieces Eaten**: 
   Now we can calculate the total number of pieces Tobias has eaten over the three days:
   \[
   \text{Total pieces eaten} = \text{Pieces eaten on the first day} + \text{Pieces eaten on the second day} + \text{Pieces eaten on the third day}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total pieces eaten} = 24 + 10 + 14 = 48 \text{ pieces}
   \]

Thus, the total number of pizza pieces Tobias has eaten so far is \( \boxed{48} \).
