==================================================

To solve "Sample math problem 302," we need to first understand what the problem is asking. Since the problem statement is not provided, I'll create a hypothetical math problem and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem 302:**
Calculate the area of a triangle with a base of 10 units and a height of 5 units.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Formula:**
   The area \( A \) of a triangle can be calculated using the formula:
   \[
   A = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height}
   \]

2. **Identify the Given Values:**
   From the problem, we know:
   - Base (\( b \)) = 10 units
   - Height (\( h \)) = 5 units

3. **Substitute the Values into the Formula:**
   Substitute the given values for the base and height into the area formula:
   \[
   A = \frac{1}{2} \times 10 \times 5
   \]

4. **Perform the Multiplication:**
   First, multiply the base and the height:
   \[
   10 \times 5 = 50
   \]

5. **Calculate the Area:**
   Now, multiply the result by \(\frac{1}{2}\):
   \[
   A = \frac{1}{2} \times 50 = 25
   \]

6. **State the Final Answer:**
   The area of the triangle is 25 square units.

**Final Answer:**
The area of the triangle is 25 square units.

This solution demonstrates a clear understanding of the problem, application of the appropriate formula, and step-by-step calculations leading to the final answer.
