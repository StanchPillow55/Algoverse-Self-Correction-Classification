==================================================

To solve "Sample math problem 302," we need to first understand what the problem is asking. Since the problem statement is not provided, I'll demonstrate how to approach a generic math problem by creating a sample problem and solving it step-by-step.

### Sample Problem:
**Problem Statement:**  
Solve for \( x \) in the equation:  
\[ 3x + 5 = 20 \]

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Understand the Equation:**
   The equation given is a linear equation in one variable, \( x \). Our goal is to isolate \( x \) on one side of the equation to find its value.

2. **Isolate the Variable:**
   To isolate \( x \), we need to perform operations that will get \( x \) by itself on one side of the equation.

3. **Subtract 5 from Both Sides:**
   Start by eliminating the constant term on the left side of the equation. Subtract 5 from both sides:
   \[
   3x + 5 - 5 = 20 - 5
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   3x = 15
   \]

4. **Divide by 3:**
   Now, divide both sides of the equation by 3 to solve for \( x \):
   \[
   \frac{3x}{3} = \frac{15}{3}
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   x = 5
   \]

5. **Verify the Solution:**
   Substitute \( x = 5 \) back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies the equation:
   \[
   3(5) + 5 = 20
   \]
   Simplifying the left side:
   \[
   15 + 5 = 20
   \]
   \[
   20 = 20
   \]
   The left side equals the right side, confirming that our solution is correct.

### Final Answer:
The solution to the equation \( 3x + 5 = 20 \) is \( x = 5 \).

This step-by-step approach can be applied to various types of math problems, ensuring that each step logically follows from the previous one and that the solution is verified for accuracy.
