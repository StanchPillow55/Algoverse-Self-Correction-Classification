==================================================

To solve the problem, we will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of doughnuts bought by Samuel and Cathy.**
2. **Determine the total number of people sharing the doughnuts.**
3. **Calculate the number of doughnuts each person will receive.**

### Step 1: Calculate the total number of doughnuts

- Samuel bought 2 dozen doughnuts. Since 1 dozen equals 12, we calculate:
  \[
  2 \text{ dozen} = 2 \times 12 = 24 \text{ doughnuts}
  \]

- Cathy bought 3 dozen doughnuts. We calculate:
  \[
  3 \text{ dozen} = 3 \times 12 = 36 \text{ doughnuts}
  \]

- Now, we add the doughnuts Samuel and Cathy bought together:
  \[
  \text{Total doughnuts} = 24 + 36 = 60 \text{ doughnuts}
  \]

### Step 2: Determine the total number of people sharing the doughnuts

- Samuel and Cathy are sharing the doughnuts with their 8 other friends. Therefore, the total number of people is:
  \[
  \text{Total people} = 2 \text{ (Samuel and Cathy)} + 8 \text{ (friends)} = 10 \text{ people}
  \]

### Step 3: Calculate the number of doughnuts each person will receive

- To find out how many doughnuts each person will receive, we divide the total number of doughnuts by the total number of people:
  \[
  \text{Doughnuts per person} = \frac{\text{Total doughnuts}}{\text{Total people}} = \frac{60}{10} = 6
  \]

### Final Answer

Each person will receive **6 doughnuts**.
