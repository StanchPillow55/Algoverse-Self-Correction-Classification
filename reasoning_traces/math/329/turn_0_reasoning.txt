==================================================

To solve the problem, we will break it down into steps and perform the calculations one by one.

1. **Initial Amount of Lollipops**: 
   Erin starts with 7 lollipops.

   \[
   \text{Initial Lollipops} = 7
   \]

2. **Lollipops Given by Mother**: 
   Erin's mother gives her an additional 10 lollipops.

   \[
   \text{Lollipops Given by Mother} = 10
   \]

3. **Total Lollipops After Receiving from Mother**: 
   To find out how many lollipops Erin has after her mother gives her more, we add the initial amount to the amount given by her mother.

   \[
   \text{Total Lollipops} = \text{Initial Lollipops} + \text{Lollipops Given by Mother}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total Lollipops} = 7 + 10 = 17
   \]

4. **Lollipops Given to Ella**: 
   Erin gives 3 of her lollipops to Ella.

   \[
   \text{Lollipops Given to Ella} = 3
   \]

5. **Total Lollipops After Giving to Ella**: 
   To find out how many lollipops Erin has left after giving some to Ella, we subtract the number of lollipops given to Ella from the total lollipops she had after receiving from her mother.

   \[
   \text{Lollipops Left} = \text{Total Lollipops} - \text{Lollipops Given to Ella}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Lollipops Left} = 17 - 3 = 14
   \]

Thus, after performing all the calculations, we find that Erin has **14 lollipops left**.

Final Answer:
\[
\text{Erin has } 14 \text{ lollipops left.}
\]
