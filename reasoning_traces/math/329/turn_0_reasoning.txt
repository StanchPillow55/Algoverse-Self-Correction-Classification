==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of doughnuts and then divide them evenly among all the people involved.

### Step 1: Calculate the Total Number of Doughnuts

1. **Samuel's Doughnuts:**
   - Samuel bought 2 dozen doughnuts.
   - Since 1 dozen equals 12 doughnuts, 2 dozen equals:
     \[
     2 \times 12 = 24 \text{ doughnuts}
     \]

2. **Cathy's Doughnuts:**
   - Cathy bought 3 dozen doughnuts.
   - Similarly, 3 dozen equals:
     \[
     3 \times 12 = 36 \text{ doughnuts}
     \]

3. **Total Doughnuts:**
   - Add Samuel's and Cathy's doughnuts together to find the total:
     \[
     24 + 36 = 60 \text{ doughnuts}
     \]

### Step 2: Determine the Total Number of People Sharing the Doughnuts

- Samuel and Cathy plan to share the doughnuts with their 8 other friends.
- Therefore, the total number of people sharing the doughnuts is:
  \[
  2 \text{ (Samuel and Cathy)} + 8 \text{ (friends)} = 10 \text{ people}
  \]

### Step 3: Divide the Doughnuts Evenly Among the People

- To find out how many doughnuts each person will receive, divide the total number of doughnuts by the total number of people:
  \[
  \frac{60 \text{ doughnuts}}{10 \text{ people}} = 6 \text{ doughnuts per person}
  \]

### Final Answer

Each person will receive 6 doughnuts.
