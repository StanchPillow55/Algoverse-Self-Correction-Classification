==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 49," we first need to understand what the problem is asking. However, the problem statement "Sample math problem 49" is not specific and does not provide any details about what needs to be solved. Therefore, I'll assume that "Sample math problem 49" refers to a generic math problem involving the number 49. Let's consider a few possibilities and solve them step by step.

### Possibility 1: Find the Square Root of 49

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We are asked to find the square root of 49.

2. **Calculation:**
   - The square root of a number \( x \) is a number \( y \) such that \( y^2 = x \).
   - We need to find \( y \) such that \( y^2 = 49 \).

3. **Solution:**
   - \( 7^2 = 49 \), so the square root of 49 is 7.
   - Since square roots can be positive or negative, the complete solution is \( y = \pm 7 \).

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The square root of 49 is \( \pm 7 \).

### Possibility 2: Determine if 49 is a Prime Number

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to determine if 49 is a prime number.

2. **Definition of a Prime Number:**
   - A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.

3. **Checking Divisibility:**
   - 49 is greater than 1.
   - Check divisibility by numbers less than or equal to the square root of 49 (which is 7).
   - 49 is divisible by 7 (since \( 49 \div 7 = 7 \)).

4. **Conclusion:**
   - Since 49 has a divisor other than 1 and itself, it is not a prime number.

5. **Final Answer:**
   - 49 is not a prime number.

### Possibility 3: Solve the Equation \( x^2 = 49 \)

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to solve the equation \( x^2 = 49 \).

2. **Solution:**
   - To solve for \( x \), take the square root of both sides of the equation.
   - \( x = \pm \sqrt{49} \).

3. **Calculation:**
   - \( \sqrt{49} = 7 \).

4. **Conclusion:**
   - \( x = \pm 7 \).

5. **Final Answer:**
   - The solutions to the equation \( x^2 = 49 \) are \( x = 7 \) and \( x = -7 \).

### Conclusion

Without a specific problem statement, I have assumed a few possible interpretations involving the number 49. If you have a specific problem in mind, please provide more details so I can address it accurately.
