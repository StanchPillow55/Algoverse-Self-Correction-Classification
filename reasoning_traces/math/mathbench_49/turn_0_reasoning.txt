==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample math problem 49" refers to. Since the problem is not explicitly stated, I'll assume it's a placeholder for a specific math problem. Let's create a hypothetical math problem and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**
Calculate the sum of all even numbers from 1 to 49.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Identify the even numbers between 1 and 49:**
   Even numbers are integers divisible by 2. The even numbers between 1 and 49 are:
   2, 4, 6, 8, ..., 48.

2. **Determine the sequence of even numbers:**
   This sequence is an arithmetic sequence where the first term \( a_1 = 2 \) and the common difference \( d = 2 \).

3. **Find the number of terms in the sequence:**
   The last term of the sequence is 48. To find the number of terms \( n \), we use the formula for the \( n \)-th term of an arithmetic sequence:
   \[
   a_n = a_1 + (n-1) \cdot d
   \]
   Setting \( a_n = 48 \), we have:
   \[
   48 = 2 + (n-1) \cdot 2
   \]
   \[
   48 = 2 + 2n - 2
   \]
   \[
   48 = 2n
   \]
   \[
   n = \frac{48}{2} = 24
   \]
   So, there are 24 even numbers between 1 and 49.

4. **Calculate the sum of the sequence:**
   The sum \( S_n \) of an arithmetic sequence can be calculated using the formula:
   \[
   S_n = \frac{n}{2} \cdot (a_1 + a_n)
   \]
   Substituting the known values:
   \[
   S_{24} = \frac{24}{2} \cdot (2 + 48)
   \]
   \[
   S_{24} = 12 \cdot 50
   \]
   \[
   S_{24} = 600
   \]

**Final Answer:**
The sum of all even numbers from 1 to 49 is 600.
