To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step.

1. **Total Cups of Tea**: Lana has a total of 27 cups of tea.

2. **Rows of Tea**: She divides these cups into 3 rows. This means we need to determine how many cups are allocated to each row.

   \[
   \text{Cups per row} = \frac{\text{Total cups}}{\text{Number of rows}} = \frac{27}{3} = 9 \text{ cups per row}
   \]

3. **Types of Tea in Each Row**: In each row, Lana creates equal amounts of chamomile and mint tea cups. Letâ€™s denote the number of chamomile cups in each row as \( C \) and the number of mint cups in each row as \( M \). Since they are equal in each row, we have:

   \[
   C = M
   \]

   Therefore, the total cups in each row can be expressed as:

   \[
   C + M = 9
   \]

   Since \( C = M \), we can substitute \( M \) for \( C \):

   \[
   M + M = 9 \implies 2M = 9 \implies M = \frac{9}{2} = 4.5
   \]

   However, since the number of cups must be a whole number, we need to reconsider our approach.

4. **Cups for Cinnamon Tea**: We know that Lana uses some of the cups for cinnamon tea. She brews a total of 15 cups of cinnamon tea. 

   To find out how many cups are left for chamomile and mint tea, we subtract the cups used for cinnamon tea from the total cups:

   \[
   \text{Cups for chamomile and mint tea} = \text{Total cups} - \text{Cups for cinnamon tea} = 27 - 15 = 12 \text{ cups}
   \]

5. **Cups in Each Row for Chamomile and Mint Tea**: Since there are 12 cups left for chamomile and mint tea, and these are divided into 3 rows, we can find the total cups for chamomile and mint tea in each row:

   \[
   \text{Cups per row for chamomile and mint tea} = \frac{12}{3} = 4 \text{ cups per row}
   \]

6. **Equal Distribution of Chamomile and Mint Tea**: Since the cups of chamomile and mint tea are equal in each row, we can denote the number of chamomile cups as \( C \) and the number of mint cups as \( M \) again. We have:

   \[
   C + M = 4
   \]
   \[
   C = M
   \]

   Substituting \( M \) for \( C \):

   \[
   M + M = 4 \implies 2M = 4 \implies M = \frac{4}{2} = 2
   \]

7. **Final Answer**: Therefore, the number of cups of mint tea in each row is:

   \[
   \boxed{2}
   \] 

This means that in each of the 3 rows, there are 2 cups of mint tea.
