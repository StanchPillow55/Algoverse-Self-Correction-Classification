Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 386" entails. Since the problem statement is not explicitly provided, I will assume a generic approach to solving a math problem by demonstrating a structured method to tackle typical math questions.

### Step-by-Step Problem Solving Approach

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - Identify what is being asked.
   - Determine what information is given.
   - Note any assumptions or constraints.

2. **Devise a Plan:**
   - Choose an appropriate strategy to solve the problem. This could involve algebraic manipulation, drawing diagrams, considering special cases, etc.

3. **Carry Out the Plan:**
   - Execute the chosen strategy step by step.
   - Perform calculations carefully.
   - Keep track of units and ensure consistency.

4. **Review/Check the Solution:**
   - Verify the solution by plugging it back into the original problem.
   - Check for any errors in calculation or logic.
   - Ensure the solution makes sense in the context of the problem.

### Example Problem

Let's consider a hypothetical problem: "Solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \)."

#### Step 1: Understand the Problem
- We need to find the value of \( x \) that satisfies the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).

#### Step 2: Devise a Plan
- We can solve for \( x \) using basic algebraic manipulation.

#### Step 3: Carry Out the Plan
1. Start with the equation: 
   \[
   2x + 3 = 11
   \]
2. Subtract 3 from both sides to isolate the term with \( x \):
   \[
   2x = 11 - 3
   \]
   \[
   2x = 8
   \]
3. Divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( x \):
   \[
   x = \frac{8}{2}
   \]
   \[
   x = 4
   \]

#### Step 4: Review/Check the Solution
- Substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation to verify:
  \[
  2(4) + 3 = 8 + 3 = 11
  \]
- The left-hand side equals the right-hand side, confirming that \( x = 4 \) is correct.

### Final Answer
The solution to the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \) is \( x = 4 \).

This structured approach can be applied to a wide range of mathematical problems, ensuring a thorough and logical solution process. If you have a specific problem labeled "Sample reasoning question 386," please provide the details, and I will apply this method to solve it.
