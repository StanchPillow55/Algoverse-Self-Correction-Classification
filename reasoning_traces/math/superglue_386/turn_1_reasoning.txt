==================================================

To solve the problem, we first need to understand what "Sample reasoning question 386" refers to. Since the problem statement is not specific, I'll assume it's a generic math problem that requires logical reasoning and problem-solving skills. Let's create a hypothetical math problem and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**

A company produces two types of widgets: Type A and Type B. The production cost for Type A is $5 per widget, and for Type B, it is $8 per widget. The company sells Type A widgets for $10 each and Type B widgets for $15 each. Last month, the company produced a total of 1,000 widgets and made a profit of $6,000. How many of each type of widget did the company produce?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( x \) be the number of Type A widgets produced.
   - Let \( y \) be the number of Type B widgets produced.

2. **Set Up Equations:**
   - The total number of widgets produced is 1,000:
     \[
     x + y = 1000
     \]

   - The profit from selling the widgets is $6,000. Profit is calculated as the difference between revenue and production cost:
     - Revenue from Type A widgets: \( 10x \)
     - Revenue from Type B widgets: \( 15y \)
     - Production cost for Type A widgets: \( 5x \)
     - Production cost for Type B widgets: \( 8y \)

   - The profit equation is:
     \[
     (10x + 15y) - (5x + 8y) = 6000
     \]

3. **Simplify the Profit Equation:**
   \[
   10x + 15y - 5x - 8y = 6000
   \]
   \[
   5x + 7y = 6000
   \]

4. **Solve the System of Equations:**
   We have the following system of equations:
   \[
   x + y = 1000
   \]
   \[
   5x + 7y = 6000
   \]

   - Solve the first equation for \( x \):
     \[
     x = 1000 - y
     \]

   - Substitute \( x = 1000 - y \) into the second equation:
     \[
     5(1000 - y) + 7y = 6000
     \]
     \[
     5000 - 5y + 7y = 6000
     \]
     \[
     2y = 1000
     \]
     \[
     y = 500
     \]

   - Substitute \( y = 500 \) back into the equation for \( x \):
     \[
     x = 1000 - 500 = 500
     \]

5. **Conclusion:**
   The company produced 500 Type A widgets and 500 Type B widgets.

**Final Answer:**
The company produced 500 Type A widgets and 500 Type B widgets.
