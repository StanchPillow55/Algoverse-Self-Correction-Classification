==================================================

To solve the problem effectively, I need more specific information about "Sample reasoning question 386." Since the question is not provided, I'll demonstrate how to approach a generic math problem step by step. If you have a specific problem in mind, please provide the details.

Let's consider a sample math problem:

**Problem:**
A farmer has a rectangular field that is 100 meters long and 60 meters wide. He wants to build a fence around the field and also divide it into two equal parts with a fence parallel to the shorter side. Calculate the total length of the fence required.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - The field is rectangular with dimensions 100 meters (length) and 60 meters (width).
   - A fence is needed around the perimeter and an additional fence to divide the field into two equal parts parallel to the shorter side.

2. **Calculate the Perimeter of the Field:**
   - The perimeter \( P \) of a rectangle is given by the formula:
     \[
     P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width})
     \]
   - Substitute the given values:
     \[
     P = 2 \times (100 + 60) = 2 \times 160 = 320 \text{ meters}
     \]

3. **Calculate the Length of the Dividing Fence:**
   - Since the field is divided into two equal parts with a fence parallel to the shorter side (width), the dividing fence will be equal to the length of the field.
   - Therefore, the length of the dividing fence is 100 meters.

4. **Calculate the Total Length of Fence Required:**
   - The total length of the fence is the sum of the perimeter and the dividing fence:
     \[
     \text{Total length} = \text{Perimeter} + \text{Dividing fence}
     \]
   - Substitute the calculated values:
     \[
     \text{Total length} = 320 + 100 = 420 \text{ meters}
     \]

5. **Final Answer:**
   - The total length of the fence required is 420 meters.

This step-by-step approach ensures that each part of the problem is addressed methodically, leading to the correct solution. If you have a specific problem or need further assistance, please provide additional details.
