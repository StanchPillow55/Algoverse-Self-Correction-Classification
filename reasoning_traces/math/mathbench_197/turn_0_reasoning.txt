==================================================

It seems like the problem statement is incomplete or unclear. "Sample math problem 197" doesn't provide specific details or numbers to work with. However, I can guide you through a generic approach to solving math problems. If you have a specific problem in mind, please provide the details, and I'll be happy to help.

Here's a general approach to solving math problems:

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - Read the problem carefully.
   - Identify what is being asked.
   - Note down the given information and any constraints.

2. **Devise a Plan:**
   - Think about the mathematical concepts that might apply (e.g., algebra, geometry, calculus).
   - Consider similar problems you've solved before.
   - Choose a strategy (e.g., drawing a diagram, creating an equation).

3. **Carry Out the Plan:**
   - Execute your chosen strategy step by step.
   - Perform calculations carefully.
   - Keep track of units and signs.

4. **Review/Check Your Work:**
   - Verify each step of your calculations.
   - Check if your solution makes sense in the context of the problem.
   - Consider alternative methods to confirm your answer.

5. **State the Final Answer:**
   - Clearly write down the final answer.
   - Include units if applicable.

If you provide a specific math problem, I can apply this approach and work through it with you.
