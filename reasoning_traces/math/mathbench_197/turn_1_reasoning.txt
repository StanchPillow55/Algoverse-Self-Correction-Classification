==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 197," we first need to understand what the problem is asking. However, the problem statement is incomplete as it only says "Sample math problem 197" without providing any specific details or context. Therefore, I will assume this is a placeholder and create a sample math problem to solve.

Let's assume the problem is as follows:

**Problem:**
Calculate the sum of the first 197 positive integers.

**Solution:**

To find the sum of the first \( n \) positive integers, we can use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series:

\[
S_n = \frac{n(n + 1)}{2}
\]

Where:
- \( S_n \) is the sum of the first \( n \) positive integers.
- \( n \) is the number of terms.

In this problem, \( n = 197 \). Plugging this value into the formula gives:

\[
S_{197} = \frac{197(197 + 1)}{2}
\]

First, calculate \( 197 + 1 \):

\[
197 + 1 = 198
\]

Now, substitute back into the formula:

\[
S_{197} = \frac{197 \times 198}{2}
\]

Next, calculate \( 197 \times 198 \):

\[
197 \times 198 = 197 \times (200 - 2) = 197 \times 200 - 197 \times 2
\]

Calculate each part separately:

\[
197 \times 200 = 39400
\]
\[
197 \times 2 = 394
\]

Subtract the second product from the first:

\[
197 \times 198 = 39400 - 394 = 39006
\]

Now, divide by 2 to find the sum:

\[
S_{197} = \frac{39006}{2} = 19503
\]

Thus, the sum of the first 197 positive integers is:

\[
\boxed{19503}
\]

This concludes the solution to the assumed problem. If the original problem statement was different, please provide the complete details for accurate assistance.
