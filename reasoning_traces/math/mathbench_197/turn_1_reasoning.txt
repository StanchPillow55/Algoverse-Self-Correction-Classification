==================================================

To solve the problem, we first need to understand what "Sample math problem 197" refers to. Since no specific details about the problem are provided, I'll assume that "Sample math problem 197" is a placeholder for a specific math problem. Without the actual problem statement, I can't solve it directly. However, I can guide you through a general approach to solving math problems.

Here's a general step-by-step approach to solving math problems:

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - Carefully read the problem statement.
   - Identify what is being asked.
   - Determine what information is given and what needs to be found.

2. **Devise a Plan:**
   - Think about the mathematical concepts that might be applicable (e.g., algebra, geometry, calculus).
   - Consider similar problems you have solved before.
   - Decide on a strategy to solve the problem (e.g., drawing a diagram, creating an equation).

3. **Carry Out the Plan:**
   - Execute the steps you have planned.
   - Perform calculations carefully.
   - Keep track of units and ensure consistency.

4. **Check Your Work:**
   - Review each step to ensure there are no errors.
   - Verify that your solution makes sense in the context of the problem.
   - Check if there is another method to solve the problem and compare results.

5. **State the Final Answer:**
   - Clearly write down the final answer.
   - Include units if applicable.

Since I don't have the specific details of "Sample math problem 197," I can't provide a detailed solution. If you provide the actual problem statement, I would be able to assist you further by applying the above steps to solve it.
