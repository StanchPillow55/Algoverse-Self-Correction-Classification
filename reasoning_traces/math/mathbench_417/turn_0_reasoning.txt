==================================================

It seems like you've mentioned "Sample math problem 417," but without specific details or context, I can't directly address the problem. However, I can guide you through a generic approach to solving a math problem. If you have specific details or numbers, please provide them. Here's a general framework for solving a math problem:

### Step-by-Step Approach:

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - Read the problem carefully.
   - Identify what is being asked.
   - Determine what information is given.

2. **Devise a Plan:**
   - Consider possible strategies to solve the problem. This could include:
     - Drawing a diagram.
     - Writing an equation.
     - Breaking the problem into smaller parts.
     - Looking for patterns.

3. **Carry Out the Plan:**
   - Execute the strategy you have chosen.
   - Perform calculations carefully.
   - Keep track of units and ensure consistency.

4. **Check Your Work:**
   - Review each step to ensure accuracy.
   - Verify that your solution makes sense in the context of the problem.
   - Check calculations for errors.

5. **State the Final Answer:**
   - Clearly write down the answer.
   - Include units if applicable.

### Example Problem:

Let's create a sample problem to illustrate the process:

**Problem:** A rectangle has a length that is twice its width. If the perimeter of the rectangle is 36 units, find the dimensions of the rectangle.

**Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We need to find the length and width of the rectangle.
   - We know the perimeter is 36 units.
   - The length is twice the width.

2. **Devise a Plan:**
   - Use the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle: \( P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width}) \).
   - Let the width be \( w \).
   - Then the length is \( 2w \).

3. **Carry Out the Plan:**
   - Substitute the expressions for length and width into the perimeter formula:
     \[
     36 = 2 \times (2w + w)
     \]
   - Simplify the equation:
     \[
     36 = 2 \times 3w
     \]
     \[
     36 = 6w
     \]
   - Solve for \( w \):
     \[
     w = \frac{36}{6} = 6
     \]
   - Find the length:
     \[
     \text{length} = 2w = 2 \times 6 = 12
     \]

4. **Check Your Work:**
   - Calculate the perimeter with the found dimensions:
     \[
     P = 2 \times (12 + 6) = 2 \times 18 = 36
     \]
   - The calculated perimeter matches the given perimeter, confirming the solution is correct.

5. **State the Final Answer:**
   - The width of the rectangle is 6 units, and the length is 12 units.

If you have a specific problem or additional details, please provide them, and I can tailor the solution to that particular problem.
