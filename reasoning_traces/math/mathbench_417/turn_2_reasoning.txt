Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 417," we first need to understand what the problem is asking. Since the problem is not explicitly stated, I'll assume it's a generic math problem and demonstrate a step-by-step approach to solving a typical math problem.

Let's assume "Sample math problem 417" involves solving a quadratic equation, as this is a common type of problem. We'll use the example quadratic equation:

\[ x^2 - 5x + 6 = 0 \]

**Step 1: Identify the type of equation**

This is a quadratic equation in the standard form \( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \), where \( a = 1 \), \( b = -5 \), and \( c = 6 \).

**Step 2: Determine the method of solution**

Quadratic equations can be solved using several methods: factoring, completing the square, or using the quadratic formula. Here, we'll use factoring.

**Step 3: Factor the quadratic equation**

We need to find two numbers that multiply to \( ac = 1 \times 6 = 6 \) and add to \( b = -5 \). The numbers -2 and -3 satisfy these conditions because:

\[ (-2) \times (-3) = 6 \]
\[ (-2) + (-3) = -5 \]

Thus, we can factor the quadratic equation as:

\[ x^2 - 5x + 6 = (x - 2)(x - 3) = 0 \]

**Step 4: Solve for the variable**

Set each factor equal to zero and solve for \( x \):

1. \( x - 2 = 0 \)  
   \[ x = 2 \]

2. \( x - 3 = 0 \)  
   \[ x = 3 \]

**Step 5: Verify the solutions**

Substitute \( x = 2 \) and \( x = 3 \) back into the original equation to verify:

- For \( x = 2 \):
  \[ (2)^2 - 5(2) + 6 = 4 - 10 + 6 = 0 \]

- For \( x = 3 \):
  \[ (3)^2 - 5(3) + 6 = 9 - 15 + 6 = 0 \]

Both solutions satisfy the original equation.

**Final Answer:**

The solutions to the quadratic equation \( x^2 - 5x + 6 = 0 \) are \( x = 2 \) and \( x = 3 \).
