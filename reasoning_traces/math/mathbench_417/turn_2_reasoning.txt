Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve "Sample math problem 417," we need to first understand what the problem entails. Since the problem is not explicitly stated, I'll assume it's a placeholder for a specific math problem. Let's create a sample problem and solve it step by step.

**Sample Math Problem 417:**
Calculate the value of \( x \) in the equation \( 3x + 7 = 22 \).

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Equation:**
   The given equation is \( 3x + 7 = 22 \). This is a linear equation in one variable, \( x \).

2. **Isolate the Variable:**
   To solve for \( x \), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We can do this by performing inverse operations.

3. **Subtract 7 from Both Sides:**
   \[
   3x + 7 - 7 = 22 - 7
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   3x = 15
   \]

4. **Divide Both Sides by 3:**
   \[
   \frac{3x}{3} = \frac{15}{3}
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   x = 5
   \]

5. **Verify the Solution:**
   Substitute \( x = 5 \) back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies the equation:
   \[
   3(5) + 7 = 22
   \]
   Simplifying the left side gives:
   \[
   15 + 7 = 22
   \]
   \[
   22 = 22
   \]
   Since both sides of the equation are equal, our solution is verified.

**Final Answer:**
The value of \( x \) is 5.
