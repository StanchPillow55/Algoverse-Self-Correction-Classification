To find the total amount of money Jake spends at the store, we need to calculate the cost of the T-shirts and the shoes separately, then sum them up.

### Step 1: Calculate the cost of the T-shirts

1. **Original Price of Each T-shirt**: $8
2. **Buy One Get One 50% Off Deal**: This means that when Jake buys the first T-shirt at full price, he gets the second T-shirt at half price.

   - **Cost of the first T-shirt**: $8
   - **Cost of the second T-shirt**: 50% of $8 = \( 0.5 \times 8 = 4 \)

3. **Total Cost for T-shirts**:
   \[
   \text{Total Cost for T-shirts} = \text{Cost of first T-shirt} + \text{Cost of second T-shirt} = 8 + 4 = 12
   \]

### Step 2: Calculate the cost of the shoes

1. **Original Price of the Shoes**: $40
2. **Discount on the Shoes**: 40% off means Jake pays 60% of the original price.

   - **Calculating the discount**:
     \[
     \text{Discount Amount} = 0.4 \times 40 = 16
     \]
   - **Cost after discount**:
     \[
     \text{Cost of Shoes} = \text{Original Price} - \text{Discount Amount} = 40 - 16 = 24
     \]

### Step 3: Calculate the total amount spent

Now, we add the total cost of the T-shirts and the cost of the shoes:

\[
\text{Total Amount Spent} = \text{Total Cost for T-shirts} + \text{Cost of Shoes} = 12 + 24 = 36
\]

### Final Answer

Jake spends a total of **$36** at the store.
