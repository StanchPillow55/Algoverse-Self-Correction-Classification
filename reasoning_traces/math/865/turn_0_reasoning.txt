==================================================

To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step.

1. **Identify the number of red cars**: 
   The problem states that there are 12 red cars.
   \[
   \text{Red cars} = 12
   \]

2. **Calculate the number of green cars**: 
   The problem states that there are 2 fewer green cars than red cars. Therefore, we can calculate the number of green cars as follows:
   \[
   \text{Green cars} = \text{Red cars} - 2 = 12 - 2 = 10
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of blue cars**: 
   The problem states that there are 3 times the number of blue cars as there are green cars. Thus, we can calculate the number of blue cars:
   \[
   \text{Blue cars} = 3 \times \text{Green cars} = 3 \times 10 = 30
   \]

4. **Calculate the total number of cars without yellow cars**: 
   Now we can find the total number of cars that are red, green, and blue:
   \[
   \text{Total cars (red, green, blue)} = \text{Red cars} + \text{Green cars} + \text{Blue cars}
   \]
   Substituting the values we found:
   \[
   \text{Total cars (red, green, blue)} = 12 + 10 + 30 = 52
   \]

5. **Calculate the number of yellow cars**: 
   The problem states that the total number of cars in the rink is 75. To find the number of yellow cars, we subtract the total number of red, green, and blue cars from the total number of cars:
   \[
   \text{Yellow cars} = \text{Total cars} - \text{Total cars (red, green, blue)} = 75 - 52 = 23
   \]

6. **Final answer**: 
   Therefore, the number of yellow cars in the bumper car rink is:
   \[
   \boxed{23}
   \]
