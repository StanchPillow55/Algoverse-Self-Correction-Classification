To solve the problem, we need to break down the costs associated with John's research into manageable parts.

1. **Initial Funding**: John receives $100,000 for the first 5 months. This is a fixed amount for this period.

2. **Duration of Research**: The research ends up taking 10 times longer than the initial 5 months. Therefore, the total duration of the research is:
   \[
   10 \times 5 = 50 \text{ months}
   \]

3. **Months Beyond Initial Funding**: Since the initial funding covers the first 5 months, we need to calculate the funding for the remaining months:
   \[
   50 - 5 = 45 \text{ months}
   \]

4. **Funding Increase**: The problem states that every month after the first 5 months requires 50% more funding than the previous month. We need to determine the funding for these additional 45 months.

   Let's denote the funding for the first month after the initial 5 months as \( F \). Since the initial funding was $100,000 for 5 months, we can assume that the funding per month during those 5 months was:
   \[
   \text{Monthly funding} = \frac{100,000}{5} = 20,000
   \]

   For the 6th month (the first month after the initial funding), the funding will be:
   \[
   F = 20,000 \times 1.5 = 30,000
   \]

5. **Funding for Subsequent Months**: The funding for each subsequent month increases by 50% from the previous month. Therefore, we can express the funding for each month as follows:
   - Month 6: \( 30,000 \)
   - Month 7: \( 30,000 \times 1.5 = 45,000 \)
   - Month 8: \( 45,000 \times 1.5 = 67,500 \)
   - Month 9: \( 67,500 \times 1.5 = 101,250 \)
   - Month 10: \( 101,250 \times 1.5 = 151,875 \)
   - And so on...

   This forms a geometric series where the first term \( a = 30,000 \) and the common ratio \( r = 1.5 \).

6. **Sum of the Series**: The total funding for the 45 months can be calculated using the formula for the sum of a geometric series:
   \[
   S_n = a \frac{(r^n - 1)}{(r - 1)}
   \]
   where \( n \) is the number of terms. Here, \( n = 45 \), \( a = 30,000 \), and \( r = 1.5 \).

   Plugging in the values:
   \[
   S_{45} = 30,000 \frac{(1.5^{45} - 1)}{(1.5 - 1)}
   \]

   First, we need to calculate \( 1.5^{45} \). This is a large number, so we can use a calculator:
   \[
   1.5^{45} \approx 11222.741
   \]

   Now substituting back into the sum formula:
   \[
   S_{45} = 30,000 \frac{(11222.741 - 1)}{0.5} \approx 30,000 \times \frac{11221.741}{0.5} \approx 30,000 \times 22443.482 \approx 673,304,460
   \]

7. **Total Cost of Research**: Finally, we add the initial funding to the total funding for the additional months:
   \[
   \text{Total Cost} = 100,000 + S_{45} \approx 100,000 + 673,304,460 \approx 673,404,460
   \]

Thus, the total cost of John's research is approximately:
\[
\boxed{673404460}
\]
