To determine the total cost of John's research, we need to break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial Funding**: John receives $100,000 for the first 5 months. This means that for the first 5 months, his research costs $100,000.

2. **Total Duration of Research**: The problem states that the research takes 10 times longer than the initial 5 months. Therefore, the total duration of the research is:
   \[
   \text{Total Duration} = 10 \times 5 = 50 \text{ months}
   \]

3. **Months Beyond Initial Funding**: Since the initial funding covers the first 5 months, we need to calculate the funding for the remaining months:
   \[
   \text{Remaining Months} = 50 - 5 = 45 \text{ months}
   \]

4. **Funding Increase**: The problem states that every month after the first 5 months, the funding requirement increases by 50% compared to the previous month. 

   - Let's denote the funding for the 6th month as \( x \). 
   - The funding for the 7th month would then be \( 1.5x \), for the 8th month \( 1.5^2 x \), and so on.

   The funding for the \( n \)-th month after the first 5 months can be expressed as:
   \[
   \text{Funding for month } n = 1.5^{(n-6)} \times x
   \]
   where \( n \) ranges from 6 to 50.

5. **Total Funding for Remaining Months**: We need to find the total funding for the 45 months after the initial 5 months. This is a geometric series where:
   - The first term \( a = x \)
   - The common ratio \( r = 1.5 \)
   - The number of terms \( n = 45 \)

   The sum \( S_n \) of a geometric series can be calculated using the formula:
   \[
   S_n = a \frac{1 - r^n}{1 - r}
   \]
   Substituting in our values:
   \[
   S_{45} = x \frac{1 - (1.5)^{45}}{1 - 1.5}
   \]
   Simplifying the denominator:
   \[
   S_{45} = x \frac{1 - (1.5)^{45}}{-0.5} = -2x (1 - (1.5)^{45})
   \]

6. **Finding \( x \)**: We need to determine \( x \). The problem does not specify how much funding is allocated for the 6th month, but we can assume that it is a continuation of the funding pattern. Since we know the initial funding is $100,000 for the first 5 months, we can divide this by 5 to find the average monthly funding:
   \[
   \text{Average Monthly Funding} = \frac{100,000}{5} = 20,000
   \]
   We can assume \( x = 20,000 \) for the 6th month.

7. **Calculating Total Cost**: Now we can calculate the total cost of the research:
   - Initial funding for the first 5 months: $100,000
   - Funding for the remaining 45 months:
   \[
   S_{45} = -2(20,000)(1 - (1.5)^{45})
   \]

   First, we need to calculate \( (1.5)^{45} \). Using a calculator, we find:
   \[
   (1.5)^{45} \approx 11222.741
   \]
   Now substituting this back into our equation:
   \[
   S_{45} = -2(20,000)(1 - 11222.741) = -40,000(-11221.741) = 448,909,640
   \]

8. **Total Cost**: Finally, we add the initial funding to the total funding for the remaining months:
   \[
   \text{Total Cost} = 100,000 + 448,909,640 = 449,009,640
   \]

Thus, the total cost of John's research is approximately **$449,009,640**. 

Final Answer:
\[
\boxed{449009640}
\]
