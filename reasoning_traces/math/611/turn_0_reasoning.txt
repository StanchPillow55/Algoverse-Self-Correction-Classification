To determine the total cost of John's research, we need to break down the funding he received and how it changed over time.

1. **Initial Funding**: John received $100,000 for the first 5 months. This means that for these 5 months, he had a fixed monthly funding of:
   \[
   \text{Monthly Funding for first 5 months} = \frac{100,000}{5} = 20,000 \text{ per month}
   \]

2. **Total Duration of Research**: The research took 10 times longer than initially planned. Since the initial plan was for 5 months, the total duration of the research is:
   \[
   \text{Total Duration} = 10 \times 5 = 50 \text{ months}
   \]

3. **Months Beyond Initial Funding**: After the first 5 months, John continues his research for an additional:
   \[
   \text{Additional Months} = 50 - 5 = 45 \text{ months}
   \]

4. **Funding for Additional Months**: The funding for each of the additional months increases by 50% compared to the previous month. The funding for the 6th month (the first month after the initial funding) will be:
   \[
   \text{Funding for 6th month} = 20,000 \times 1.5 = 30,000
   \]

   For the 7th month, the funding will be:
   \[
   \text{Funding for 7th month} = 30,000 \times 1.5 = 45,000
   \]

   This pattern continues, where each month’s funding is 1.5 times the previous month’s funding. 

5. **General Formula for Funding**: The funding for the \(n\)-th month after the first 5 months can be expressed as:
   \[
   \text{Funding for month } n = 20,000 \times (1.5)^{n-5}
   \]
   where \(n\) ranges from 6 to 50.

6. **Total Cost Calculation**: We need to calculate the total funding for the months from 6 to 50. This can be expressed as a geometric series:
   \[
   \text{Total Cost for months 6 to 50} = \sum_{k=0}^{44} 20,000 \times (1.5)^k
   \]
   This is a geometric series with:
   - First term \(a = 20,000\)
   - Common ratio \(r = 1.5\)
   - Number of terms \(n = 45\)

   The sum \(S_n\) of a geometric series can be calculated using the formula:
   \[
   S_n = a \frac{1 - r^n}{1 - r}
   \]
   Plugging in our values:
   \[
   S_{45} = 20,000 \frac{1 - (1.5)^{45}}{1 - 1.5}
   \]
   Simplifying the denominator:
   \[
   S_{45} = 20,000 \frac{1 - (1.5)^{45}}{-0.5} = -40,000 (1 - (1.5)^{45})
   \]

   Now, we need to calculate \((1.5)^{45}\):
   \[
   (1.5)^{45} \approx 1.5^{45} \approx 7.62939453125 \times 10^6 \text{ (using a calculator)}
   \]
   Therefore,
   \[
   S_{45} = -40,000 (1 - 7,62939453125 \times 10^6) \approx -40,000 (-7,62939453125 \times 10^6 + 1)
   \]
   This simplifies to:
   \[
   S_{45} \approx 40,000 \times 7,62939453125 \times 10^6 \approx 305,175,781.25
   \]

7. **Total Cost of Research**: Now we add the initial funding to the total cost of the additional months:
   \[
   \text{Total Cost} = 100,000 + 305,175,781.25 \approx 305,275,781.25
   \]

Thus, the total cost of John's research is approximately:
\[
\boxed{305,275,781.25}
\]
