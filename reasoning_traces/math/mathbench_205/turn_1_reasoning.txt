==================================================

To solve the problem, we first need to understand what "Sample math problem 205" refers to. Since the problem itself is not provided, I'll assume a generic math problem and walk through a typical problem-solving process. Let's consider a common type of problem, such as solving a quadratic equation, which is a typical problem that might be labeled in a series of sample math problems.

**Problem: Solve the quadratic equation \(2x^2 - 4x - 6 = 0\).**

**Step 1: Identify the type of equation.**

This is a quadratic equation in the standard form \(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\), where \(a = 2\), \(b = -4\), and \(c = -6\).

**Step 2: Check if the equation can be factored easily.**

To factor the quadratic equation, we look for two numbers that multiply to \(a \cdot c = 2 \cdot (-6) = -12\) and add to \(b = -4\). The numbers that satisfy these conditions are 2 and -6. However, these numbers do not directly help in factoring the equation in a simple manner, so we will use the quadratic formula instead.

**Step 3: Use the quadratic formula.**

The quadratic formula is given by:

\[
x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
\]

Substitute the values of \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) into the formula:

\[
x = \frac{-(-4) \pm \sqrt{(-4)^2 - 4 \cdot 2 \cdot (-6)}}{2 \cdot 2}
\]

Simplify the expression:

\[
x = \frac{4 \pm \sqrt{16 + 48}}{4}
\]

\[
x = \frac{4 \pm \sqrt{64}}{4}
\]

\[
x = \frac{4 \pm 8}{4}
\]

**Step 4: Solve for the two possible values of \(x\).**

1. \(x = \frac{4 + 8}{4} = \frac{12}{4} = 3\)

2. \(x = \frac{4 - 8}{4} = \frac{-4}{4} = -1\)

**Step 5: State the final answer.**

The solutions to the quadratic equation \(2x^2 - 4x - 6 = 0\) are \(x = 3\) and \(x = -1\).

**Final Answer:**

\(x = 3\) and \(x = -1\)
