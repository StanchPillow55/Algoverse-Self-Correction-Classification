==================================================

To solve "Sample math problem 205," we first need to understand what the problem is asking. However, since "Sample math problem 205" is not a specific problem statement, let's assume a hypothetical math problem related to the number 205. 

Let's consider a problem involving the number 205:

**Problem:** Find the prime factorization of 205.

**Step-by-step Solution:**

1. **Identify if 205 is divisible by the smallest prime number, 2.**
   - A number is divisible by 2 if it is even. Since 205 is odd, it is not divisible by 2.

2. **Check divisibility by the next smallest prime number, 3.**
   - A number is divisible by 3 if the sum of its digits is divisible by 3.
   - Sum of the digits of 205: \(2 + 0 + 5 = 7\).
   - Since 7 is not divisible by 3, 205 is not divisible by 3.

3. **Check divisibility by the next prime number, 5.**
   - A number is divisible by 5 if it ends in 0 or 5.
   - Since 205 ends in 5, it is divisible by 5.
   - Divide 205 by 5: 
     \[
     205 \div 5 = 41
     \]

4. **Determine if 41 is a prime number.**
   - Check divisibility of 41 by prime numbers less than its square root (approximately 6.4).
   - Check divisibility by 2: 41 is odd, not divisible.
   - Check divisibility by 3: Sum of digits \(4 + 1 = 5\), not divisible by 3.
   - Check divisibility by 5: 41 does not end in 0 or 5, not divisible.

   Since 41 is not divisible by any prime numbers less than its square root, 41 is a prime number.

5. **Conclude the prime factorization.**
   - The prime factorization of 205 is \(5 \times 41\).

**Final Answer:**
The prime factorization of 205 is \(5 \times 41\).
