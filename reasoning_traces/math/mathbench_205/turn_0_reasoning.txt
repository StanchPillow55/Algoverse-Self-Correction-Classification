==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to understand what "Sample math problem 205" refers to. Since the problem itself is not explicitly stated, I'll assume it's a placeholder for a specific math problem. Without the actual problem, I can't provide a solution. However, I can guide you through a generic approach to solving math problems.

Let's assume "Sample math problem 205" is a typical math problem. Here's a step-by-step approach to solving a generic math problem:

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - Read the problem carefully.
   - Identify what is being asked.
   - Determine what information is given and what needs to be found.

2. **Devise a Plan:**
   - Consider possible strategies to solve the problem, such as:
     - Drawing a diagram.
     - Writing an equation.
     - Looking for patterns.
     - Breaking the problem into smaller parts.

3. **Carry Out the Plan:**
   - Execute the chosen strategy.
   - Perform calculations carefully.
   - Keep track of units and ensure consistency.

4. **Check Your Work:**
   - Verify each step of your solution.
   - Check if the answer makes sense in the context of the problem.
   - Re-calculate if necessary to ensure accuracy.

5. **State the Final Answer:**
   - Clearly write down the final answer.
   - Include units if applicable.

Since I don't have the specific details of "Sample math problem 205," I can't provide a detailed solution. If you can provide the actual math problem, I'd be happy to help solve it step by step.
