==================================================

Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial Count of Lollipops**:
   Oscar starts with 24 lollipops.

2. **Lollipops Eaten on the Way to School**:
   He eats 2 lollipops on his way to school.
   \[
   24 - 2 = 22 \text{ lollipops remaining}
   \]

3. **Lollipops Given to Friends**:
   He gives out 14 lollipops to his friends.
   \[
   22 - 14 = 8 \text{ lollipops remaining}
   \]

4. **Lollipops Bought on the Way Home**:
   He buys twice as many lollipops as he gave to his friends. Since he gave away 14 lollipops, he buys:
   \[
   2 \times 14 = 28 \text{ lollipops}
   \]
   Now, we add these to the remaining lollipops:
   \[
   8 + 28 = 36 \text{ lollipops}
   \]

5. **Lollipops Eaten at Night**:
   He eats 3 more lollipops that night.
   \[
   36 - 3 = 33 \text{ lollipops remaining}
   \]

6. **Lollipops Eaten in the Morning**:
   He eats 2 more lollipops in the morning.
   \[
   33 - 2 = 31 \text{ lollipops remaining}
   \]

Now, we have calculated all the steps. The final count of lollipops that Oscar has is:
\[
\boxed{31}
\]
