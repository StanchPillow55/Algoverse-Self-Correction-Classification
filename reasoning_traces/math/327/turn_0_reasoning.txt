To solve this problem, we need to determine how many mink skins Andy has available to make coats after accounting for the minks that are set free. Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Purchase:**
   - Andy buys 30 minks.

2. **Mink Babies:**
   - Each of these 30 minks has 6 babies.
   - Therefore, the total number of baby minks is:
     \[
     30 \text{ minks} \times 6 \text{ babies per mink} = 180 \text{ baby minks}
     \]

3. **Total Minks Before Activists:**
   - The total number of minks before any are set free is the sum of the original minks and the baby minks:
     \[
     30 \text{ original minks} + 180 \text{ baby minks} = 210 \text{ total minks}
     \]

4. **Minks Set Free:**
   - Half of the total minks are set free by activists.
   - Therefore, the number of minks set free is:
     \[
     \frac{210}{2} = 105 \text{ minks set free}
     \]

5. **Minks Remaining:**
   - The number of minks remaining after the activists set half free is:
     \[
     210 \text{ total minks} - 105 \text{ minks set free} = 105 \text{ minks remaining}
     \]

6. **Coats Calculation:**
   - It takes 15 mink skins to make one coat.
   - To find out how many coats can be made, we divide the number of remaining minks by the number of minks needed per coat:
     \[
     \frac{105 \text{ minks}}{15 \text{ minks per coat}} = 7 \text{ coats}
     \]

Therefore, Andy can make 7 coats with the remaining minks.

**Final Answer:**
Andy can make 7 coats.
