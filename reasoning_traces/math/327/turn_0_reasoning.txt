To solve the problem, we need to determine how many coats Andy can make based on the number of mink skins he has after accounting for the minks he buys, their babies, and the minks that are set free.

1. **Calculate the total number of minks Andy starts with:**
   - Andy buys 30 minks.

   \[
   \text{Total minks bought} = 30
   \]

2. **Calculate the number of babies each mink has:**
   - Each mink has 6 babies.

   \[
   \text{Babies per mink} = 6
   \]

3. **Calculate the total number of babies:**
   - Since Andy has 30 minks, the total number of babies is:

   \[
   \text{Total babies} = 30 \text{ minks} \times 6 \text{ babies/mink} = 180 \text{ babies}
   \]

4. **Calculate the total number of minks (including babies):**
   - The total number of minks, including the original minks and their babies, is:

   \[
   \text{Total minks} = 30 \text{ minks} + 180 \text{ babies} = 210 \text{ minks}
   \]

5. **Account for the minks set free:**
   - Half of the total minks are set free by activists. Therefore, the number of minks set free is:

   \[
   \text{Minks set free} = \frac{210}{2} = 105 \text{ minks}
   \]

6. **Calculate the remaining minks:**
   - After setting free half of the minks, the number of minks left is:

   \[
   \text{Remaining minks} = 210 \text{ minks} - 105 \text{ minks set free} = 105 \text{ minks}
   \]

7. **Determine how many coats can be made:**
   - It takes 15 mink skins to make one coat. Therefore, the number of coats Andy can make is:

   \[
   \text{Number of coats} = \frac{\text{Remaining minks}}{\text{Minks per coat}} = \frac{105 \text{ minks}}{15 \text{ minks/coat}} = 7 \text{ coats}
   \]

Thus, after performing all calculations and reasoning through the problem, we find that Andy can make a total of **7 coats**.

**Final Answer: 7 coats**
