==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 246," we need to first understand what the problem is asking. However, since "Sample math problem 246" is not a specific problem statement, I'll create a hypothetical math problem and solve it step by step.

Let's assume the problem is as follows:

**Problem:**
Calculate the sum of all even numbers between 1 and 246.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Identify the Even Numbers:**
   - Even numbers are integers divisible by 2.
   - The even numbers between 1 and 246 start from 2 and go up to 246.

2. **Determine the Sequence of Even Numbers:**
   - The sequence of even numbers between 1 and 246 is: 2, 4, 6, ..., 246.
   - This sequence is an arithmetic sequence where the first term \( a_1 = 2 \) and the common difference \( d = 2 \).

3. **Find the Number of Terms in the Sequence:**
   - The general formula for the \( n \)-th term of an arithmetic sequence is given by:
     \[
     a_n = a_1 + (n-1) \cdot d
     \]
   - We need to find \( n \) such that \( a_n = 246 \).
     \[
     246 = 2 + (n-1) \cdot 2
     \]
     \[
     246 = 2 + 2n - 2
     \]
     \[
     246 = 2n
     \]
     \[
     n = \frac{246}{2} = 123
     \]
   - There are 123 even numbers between 1 and 246.

4. **Calculate the Sum of the Sequence:**
   - The sum \( S_n \) of the first \( n \) terms of an arithmetic sequence is given by:
     \[
     S_n = \frac{n}{2} \cdot (a_1 + a_n)
     \]
   - Substitute the known values:
     \[
     S_{123} = \frac{123}{2} \cdot (2 + 246)
     \]
     \[
     S_{123} = \frac{123}{2} \cdot 248
     \]
     \[
     S_{123} = 123 \cdot 124
     \]

5. **Perform the Multiplication:**
   - Calculate \( 123 \times 124 \):
     \[
     123 \times 124 = 123 \times (120 + 4)
     \]
     \[
     = 123 \times 120 + 123 \times 4
     \]
     \[
     = (123 \times 12 \times 10) + (123 \times 4)
     \]
     \[
     = (1476 \times 10) + 492
     \]
     \[
     = 14760 + 492
     \]
     \[
     = 15252
     \]

**Final Answer:**
The sum of all even numbers between 1 and 246 is 15,252.
