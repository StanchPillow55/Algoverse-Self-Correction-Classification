==================================================

To solve the problem effectively, I need more specific information about "Sample reasoning question 14." Since the question is not provided, I'll demonstrate how to approach a typical math reasoning problem by creating an example and solving it step-by-step.

**Example Problem:**

A train travels from City A to City B, a distance of 300 miles. The train travels the first 100 miles at a speed of 50 miles per hour and the remaining 200 miles at a speed of 75 miles per hour. What is the total time taken for the journey?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We need to find the total time taken for the train to travel from City A to City B.
   - The journey is divided into two segments with different speeds.

2. **Identify the Given Information:**
   - Distance for the first segment: 100 miles
   - Speed for the first segment: 50 miles per hour
   - Distance for the second segment: 200 miles
   - Speed for the second segment: 75 miles per hour

3. **Calculate the Time for Each Segment:**
   - **First Segment:**
     - Time = Distance / Speed
     - Time for the first segment = 100 miles / 50 miles per hour = 2 hours

   - **Second Segment:**
     - Time = Distance / Speed
     - Time for the second segment = 200 miles / 75 miles per hour
     - Simplify the division: 200 ÷ 75 = 8/3 hours or approximately 2.67 hours

4. **Calculate the Total Time:**
   - Total time = Time for the first segment + Time for the second segment
   - Total time = 2 hours + 8/3 hours
   - Convert 8/3 hours to a decimal for easier addition: 8/3 ≈ 2.67 hours
   - Total time ≈ 2 + 2.67 = 4.67 hours

5. **State the Final Answer:**
   - The total time taken for the journey from City A to City B is approximately 4.67 hours.

This example illustrates how to break down a problem, perform calculations, and arrive at a solution. If you have a specific problem or question, please provide the details, and I'll be happy to help solve it!
