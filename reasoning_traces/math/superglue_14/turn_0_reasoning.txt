==================================================

To solve the problem effectively, I need more specific information about "Sample reasoning question 14." Since the question is not provided, I'll demonstrate how to approach a typical math reasoning problem step by step. If you have a specific question, please provide it, and I'll be happy to assist.

Let's consider a sample math reasoning problem:

**Problem:**
A train travels from City A to City B, a distance of 300 miles, at a constant speed. On its return trip, the train travels at a speed that is 20 miles per hour faster and takes 1 hour less than the initial trip. What is the speed of the train from City A to City B?

**Solution:**

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( x \) be the speed of the train from City A to City B in miles per hour.
   - The speed on the return trip is \( x + 20 \) miles per hour.

2. **Set Up Equations:**
   - The time taken to travel from City A to City B is \( \frac{300}{x} \) hours.
   - The time taken to return from City B to City A is \( \frac{300}{x + 20} \) hours.

3. **Use the Information Given:**
   - The return trip takes 1 hour less than the initial trip:
     \[
     \frac{300}{x} - \frac{300}{x + 20} = 1
     \]

4. **Solve the Equation:**
   - To eliminate the fractions, find a common denominator and solve for \( x \):
     \[
     300(x + 20) - 300x = x(x + 20)
     \]
     \[
     300x + 6000 - 300x = x^2 + 20x
     \]
     \[
     6000 = x^2 + 20x
     \]
   - Rearrange the equation:
     \[
     x^2 + 20x - 6000 = 0
     \]

5. **Solve the Quadratic Equation:**
   - Use the quadratic formula \( x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \), where \( a = 1 \), \( b = 20 \), and \( c = -6000 \):
     \[
     x = \frac{-20 \pm \sqrt{20^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot (-6000)}}{2 \cdot 1}
     \]
     \[
     x = \frac{-20 \pm \sqrt{400 + 24000}}{2}
     \]
     \[
     x = \frac{-20 \pm \sqrt{24400}}{2}
     \]
     \[
     x = \frac{-20 \pm 156.2}{2}
     \]
   - Calculate the two possible solutions:
     \[
     x = \frac{136.2}{2} = 68.1
     \]
     \[
     x = \frac{-176.2}{2} = -88.1
     \]

6. **Select the Valid Solution:**
   - Since speed cannot be negative, the valid solution is \( x = 68.1 \).

**Final Answer:**
The speed of the train from City A to City B is 68.1 miles per hour.
