==================================================

To solve this problem, I need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 14" refers to. Since I don't have access to external documents or specific problem sets, I'll assume this is a hypothetical or generic math problem. Without specific details, I'll create a sample problem and solve it step-by-step.

**Sample Problem:**

Let's assume "Sample reasoning question 14" is a problem about finding the solution to a quadratic equation. Here's a hypothetical problem:

"Find the roots of the quadratic equation \(2x^2 - 4x - 6 = 0\)."

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Identify the coefficients:**
   The given quadratic equation is in the form \(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\), where:
   - \(a = 2\)
   - \(b = -4\)
   - \(c = -6\)

2. **Use the quadratic formula:**
   The quadratic formula to find the roots of \(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\) is:
   \[
   x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
   \]

3. **Calculate the discriminant:**
   The discriminant (\(\Delta\)) is given by \(b^2 - 4ac\).
   \[
   \Delta = (-4)^2 - 4 \times 2 \times (-6) = 16 + 48 = 64
   \]

4. **Evaluate the roots using the quadratic formula:**
   Since the discriminant is positive (\(\Delta = 64\)), there are two distinct real roots.
   \[
   x = \frac{-(-4) \pm \sqrt{64}}{2 \times 2}
   \]
   \[
   x = \frac{4 \pm 8}{4}
   \]

5. **Calculate the two roots:**
   - First root:
     \[
     x_1 = \frac{4 + 8}{4} = \frac{12}{4} = 3
     \]
   - Second root:
     \[
     x_2 = \frac{4 - 8}{4} = \frac{-4}{4} = -1
     \]

6. **Conclusion:**
   The roots of the quadratic equation \(2x^2 - 4x - 6 = 0\) are \(x = 3\) and \(x = -1\).

**Final Answer:**
The roots of the equation \(2x^2 - 4x - 6 = 0\) are \(x = 3\) and \(x = -1\).
