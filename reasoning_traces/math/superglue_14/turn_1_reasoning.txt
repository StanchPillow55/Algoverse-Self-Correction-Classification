==================================================

To solve the problem effectively, I need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 14" refers to. Since I don't have access to external databases or specific documents, I'll assume this is a hypothetical math problem. Without specific details, I'll create a sample math problem and solve it step-by-step.

**Sample Problem:**

A company produces two types of widgets: Type A and Type B. The production cost for Type A is $5 per unit, and for Type B, it is $8 per unit. The company sells Type A widgets for $10 each and Type B widgets for $15 each. If the company produces 100 Type A widgets and 150 Type B widgets, what is the total profit?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Identify the Costs:**
   - Cost of producing Type A widgets = Number of Type A widgets × Cost per Type A widget
   - Cost of producing Type A widgets = 100 × $5 = $500

   - Cost of producing Type B widgets = Number of Type B widgets × Cost per Type B widget
   - Cost of producing Type B widgets = 150 × $8 = $1200

2. **Calculate Total Production Cost:**
   - Total production cost = Cost of Type A widgets + Cost of Type B widgets
   - Total production cost = $500 + $1200 = $1700

3. **Identify the Revenue:**
   - Revenue from Type A widgets = Number of Type A widgets × Selling price per Type A widget
   - Revenue from Type A widgets = 100 × $10 = $1000

   - Revenue from Type B widgets = Number of Type B widgets × Selling price per Type B widget
   - Revenue from Type B widgets = 150 × $15 = $2250

4. **Calculate Total Revenue:**
   - Total revenue = Revenue from Type A widgets + Revenue from Type B widgets
   - Total revenue = $1000 + $2250 = $3250

5. **Calculate Profit:**
   - Profit = Total revenue - Total production cost
   - Profit = $3250 - $1700 = $1550

**Final Answer:**

The total profit from producing and selling 100 Type A widgets and 150 Type B widgets is $1550.
