Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, I need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 14" entails. Since the problem statement is not explicitly provided, I'll demonstrate how to approach a generic reasoning problem in mathematics. Let's assume this is a typical problem involving logical reasoning or mathematical deduction.

### Step-by-Step Approach:

1. **Identify the Problem Type:**
   - Since the problem is labeled as a "reasoning question," it likely involves logical deduction, pattern recognition, or applying mathematical principles to reach a conclusion.

2. **Gather Information:**
   - In a typical reasoning question, you would start by identifying all given information, assumptions, and any constraints or rules that apply.

3. **Analyze the Information:**
   - Break down the information into manageable parts. Look for patterns, relationships, or sequences that can help in understanding the problem better.

4. **Formulate a Plan:**
   - Decide on a strategy to solve the problem. This could involve setting up equations, drawing diagrams, or using logical deduction.

5. **Execute the Plan:**
   - Carry out the steps you've planned. This might involve calculations, logical reasoning, or constructing a proof.

6. **Check Your Work:**
   - Verify each step to ensure there are no errors. Check if the solution satisfies all the conditions of the problem.

7. **State the Final Answer:**
   - Clearly present the solution, ensuring it answers the question posed.

### Example Problem:
Let's create a hypothetical reasoning problem:

**Problem:** If a sequence is defined such that each term is the sum of the two preceding terms, with the first two terms being 1 and 1, what is the 10th term in the sequence?

**Solution:**

1. **Identify the Sequence:**
   - This is a Fibonacci sequence where each term \( F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2) \).

2. **Calculate the Terms:**
   - \( F(1) = 1 \)
   - \( F(2) = 1 \)
   - \( F(3) = F(2) + F(1) = 1 + 1 = 2 \)
   - \( F(4) = F(3) + F(2) = 2 + 1 = 3 \)
   - \( F(5) = F(4) + F(3) = 3 + 2 = 5 \)
   - \( F(6) = F(5) + F(4) = 5 + 3 = 8 \)
   - \( F(7) = F(6) + F(5) = 8 + 5 = 13 \)
   - \( F(8) = F(7) + F(6) = 13 + 8 = 21 \)
   - \( F(9) = F(8) + F(7) = 21 + 13 = 34 \)
   - \( F(10) = F(9) + F(8) = 34 + 21 = 55 \)

3. **Final Answer:**
   - The 10th term in the sequence is 55.

This example illustrates how to approach a reasoning problem by breaking it down into steps, performing calculations, and verifying the solution. If you have a specific problem or more details about "Sample reasoning question 14," please provide them, and I can tailor the solution accordingly.
