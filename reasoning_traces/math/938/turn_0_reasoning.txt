To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step.

1. **Calculate John's total earnings for the week:**
   - John earns $50 per hour and works for 6 hours.
   - Total earnings = Hourly rate × Hours worked
   \[
   \text{Total earnings} = 50 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 6 \, \text{hours} = 300 \, \text{dollars}
   \]

2. **Calculate John's expenses:**
   - He spends $50 on gas.
   - He wants to deposit $100 in the bank.
   - Total expenses = Gas + Deposit
   \[
   \text{Total expenses} = 50 \, \text{dollars} + 100 \, \text{dollars} = 150 \, \text{dollars}
   \]

3. **Calculate John's remaining money after expenses:**
   - Remaining money = Total earnings - Total expenses
   \[
   \text{Remaining money} = 300 \, \text{dollars} - 150 \, \text{dollars} = 150 \, \text{dollars}
   \]

4. **Calculate the cost of the pencils:**
   - John buys 5 pencils, each costing $10.
   - Total cost of pencils = Number of pencils × Cost per pencil
   \[
   \text{Total cost of pencils} = 5 \times 10 \, \text{dollars} = 50 \, \text{dollars}
   \]

5. **Calculate John's remaining money after buying pencils:**
   - Remaining money after buying pencils = Remaining money - Total cost of pencils
   \[
   \text{Remaining money after pencils} = 150 \, \text{dollars} - 50 \, \text{dollars} = 100 \, \text{dollars}
   \]

6. **Calculate how many pens John can buy:**
   - Each pen costs $25.
   - Number of pens he can buy = Remaining money after pencils / Cost per pen
   \[
   \text{Number of pens} = \frac{100 \, \text{dollars}}{25 \, \text{dollars/pen}} = 4
   \]

Thus, after completing all calculations and reasoning through the problem, we find that John can buy **4 pens**.

**Final Answer: 4 pens**
