==================================================

To solve the problem, we first need to understand what "Sample math problem 216" refers to. Since the problem isn't explicitly stated, I'll assume it involves the number 216 in some mathematical context. Let's explore a few possibilities involving the number 216:

### Possibility 1: Prime Factorization
One common problem involving numbers is finding their prime factorization.

**Step 1: Prime Factorization of 216**

1. Start by dividing 216 by the smallest prime number, which is 2:
   \[
   216 \div 2 = 108
   \]
2. Divide 108 by 2:
   \[
   108 \div 2 = 54
   \]
3. Divide 54 by 2:
   \[
   54 \div 2 = 27
   \]
4. 27 is not divisible by 2, so move to the next prime number, which is 3:
   \[
   27 \div 3 = 9
   \]
5. Divide 9 by 3:
   \[
   9 \div 3 = 3
   \]
6. Finally, divide 3 by 3:
   \[
   3 \div 3 = 1
   \]

The prime factorization of 216 is \(2^3 \times 3^3\).

### Possibility 2: Cube Root
Another common problem might involve finding the cube root of 216.

**Step 2: Cube Root of 216**

Since \(216 = 2^3 \times 3^3\), we can find the cube root by taking the cube root of each factor:
\[
\sqrt[3]{216} = \sqrt[3]{2^3 \times 3^3} = \sqrt[3]{2^3} \times \sqrt[3]{3^3} = 2 \times 3 = 6
\]

### Possibility 3: Volume of a Cube
If the problem involves geometry, 216 could represent the volume of a cube, and we might be asked to find the side length.

**Step 3: Side Length of a Cube with Volume 216**

The formula for the volume of a cube is \(V = s^3\), where \(s\) is the side length. Given \(V = 216\), we solve for \(s\):
\[
s^3 = 216
\]
Taking the cube root of both sides:
\[
s = \sqrt[3]{216} = 6
\]

### Conclusion
Without a specific problem statement, we explored several mathematical contexts involving the number 216. The prime factorization of 216 is \(2^3 \times 3^3\), its cube root is 6, and if it represents the volume of a cube, the side length is also 6.

Final Answer: 
- Prime Factorization: \(2^3 \times 3^3\)
- Cube Root: 6
- Side Length of Cube with Volume 216: 6
