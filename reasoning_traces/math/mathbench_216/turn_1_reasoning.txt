==================================================

To solve the problem, we first need to understand what "Sample math problem 216" refers to. Since no specific details are provided about the problem, I'll assume it involves the number 216 and explore some common mathematical problems or concepts related to this number.

### Step 1: Identify Properties of 216
1. **Prime Factorization:**
   - 216 is an even number, so it is divisible by 2.
   - Divide 216 by 2: \( 216 \div 2 = 108 \)
   - 108 is also even, divide by 2: \( 108 \div 2 = 54 \)
   - 54 is even, divide by 2: \( 54 \div 2 = 27 \)
   - 27 is divisible by 3 (since the sum of its digits, 2 + 7 = 9, is divisible by 3).
   - Divide 27 by 3: \( 27 \div 3 = 9 \)
   - 9 is divisible by 3: \( 9 \div 3 = 3 \)
   - 3 is a prime number.
   - Therefore, the prime factorization of 216 is \( 2^3 \times 3^3 \).

2. **Cube Number:**
   - Since \( 216 = 6^3 \), 216 is a perfect cube.

3. **Divisors:**
   - To find the number of divisors, use the formula for the number of divisors from the prime factorization: If \( n = p_1^{a_1} \times p_2^{a_2} \times \ldots \times p_k^{a_k} \), then the number of divisors is \( (a_1 + 1)(a_2 + 1) \ldots (a_k + 1) \).
   - For 216, \( (3 + 1)(3 + 1) = 4 \times 4 = 16 \).
   - Therefore, 216 has 16 divisors.

### Step 2: Solve a Sample Problem Involving 216
Let's solve a problem involving the cube root of 216, since it is a perfect cube.

**Problem:** Find the cube root of 216.

**Solution:**
- Since \( 216 = 6^3 \), the cube root of 216 is 6.

### Step 3: Conclusion
The number 216 has several interesting properties: it is a perfect cube, its prime factorization is \( 2^3 \times 3^3 \), and it has 16 divisors. The cube root of 216 is 6.

**Final Answer:**
The cube root of 216 is 6.
