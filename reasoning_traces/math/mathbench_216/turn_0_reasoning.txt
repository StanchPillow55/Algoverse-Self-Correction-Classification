==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample math problem 216" refers to. Since no specific details are given about the problem, I'll assume it's a generic math problem involving the number 216. One common type of problem involving numbers is to find their prime factorization, check if they are perfect squares or cubes, or solve equations involving them. Let's explore these possibilities:

### Prime Factorization of 216

1. **Divide by the smallest prime number**: Start with the smallest prime number, which is 2. Check if 216 is divisible by 2.
   \[
   216 \div 2 = 108
   \]
   Since 216 is even, it is divisible by 2.

2. **Continue dividing by 2**: 
   \[
   108 \div 2 = 54
   \]
   \[
   54 \div 2 = 27
   \]
   27 is not divisible by 2, so we move to the next smallest prime number, which is 3.

3. **Divide by 3**:
   \[
   27 \div 3 = 9
   \]
   \[
   9 \div 3 = 3
   \]
   \[
   3 \div 3 = 1
   \]
   Now we have reached 1, so the division process stops here.

4. **Compile the prime factors**: The prime factorization of 216 is:
   \[
   216 = 2^3 \times 3^3
   \]

### Check if 216 is a Perfect Cube

A number is a perfect cube if it can be expressed as \( n^3 \) for some integer \( n \).

1. **Use the prime factorization**: From the prime factorization \( 216 = 2^3 \times 3^3 \), we see that both exponents are 3, which means:
   \[
   216 = (2 \times 3)^3 = 6^3
   \]

2. **Conclusion**: Since \( 216 = 6^3 \), 216 is indeed a perfect cube.

### Final Answer

Based on the exploration above, the number 216 has the prime factorization \( 2^3 \times 3^3 \) and is a perfect cube, specifically \( 6^3 \).

Therefore, the final answer is:
- **Prime Factorization**: \( 2^3 \times 3^3 \)
- **Perfect Cube**: \( 6^3 \)
