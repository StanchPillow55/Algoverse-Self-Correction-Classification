==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what the problem is asking. However, the given statement "Sample math problem 216" does not provide specific details about the problem itself. Without additional context or details, it's difficult to determine what calculations or reasoning are required.

To proceed, I'll assume that "Sample math problem 216" refers to a common type of math problem involving the number 216. One possible interpretation is that it involves finding the prime factorization of 216, as this is a typical math exercise.

Let's work through the prime factorization of 216:

1. **Identify if 216 is divisible by the smallest prime number, 2:**
   - 216 is an even number, so it is divisible by 2.
   - Divide 216 by 2: 
     \[
     216 \div 2 = 108
     \]

2. **Continue dividing by 2:**
   - 108 is also even, so divide by 2 again:
     \[
     108 \div 2 = 54
     \]

3. **Continue dividing by 2:**
   - 54 is even, so divide by 2 again:
     \[
     54 \div 2 = 27
     \]

4. **Check divisibility by the next smallest prime number, 3:**
   - 27 is not even, so check divisibility by 3. The sum of the digits of 27 is \(2 + 7 = 9\), which is divisible by 3.
   - Divide 27 by 3:
     \[
     27 \div 3 = 9
     \]

5. **Continue dividing by 3:**
   - 9 is divisible by 3, so divide by 3 again:
     \[
     9 \div 3 = 3
     \]

6. **Continue dividing by 3:**
   - 3 is divisible by 3, so divide by 3:
     \[
     3 \div 3 = 1
     \]

Now, we have completely factored 216 into prime factors. The prime factorization of 216 is:
\[
216 = 2^3 \times 3^3
\]

**Final Answer:**
The prime factorization of 216 is \(2^3 \times 3^3\).
