==================================================

To solve the problem, we first need to understand what "Sample math problem 216" refers to. Since no specific problem statement is provided, let's assume it involves the number 216 and explore some common mathematical problems related to it. 

### Step 1: Understanding the Number 216

The number 216 is a perfect cube. Specifically, it is the cube of 6:

\[
6^3 = 6 \times 6 \times 6 = 216
\]

### Step 2: Prime Factorization

Let's find the prime factorization of 216:

1. 216 is even, so divide by 2:
   \[
   216 \div 2 = 108
   \]
2. 108 is even, so divide by 2 again:
   \[
   108 \div 2 = 54
   \]
3. 54 is even, so divide by 2 again:
   \[
   54 \div 2 = 27
   \]
4. 27 is divisible by 3 (since the sum of its digits, 2 + 7 = 9, is divisible by 3):
   \[
   27 \div 3 = 9
   \]
5. 9 is divisible by 3:
   \[
   9 \div 3 = 3
   \]
6. Finally, 3 is divisible by 3:
   \[
   3 \div 3 = 1
   \]

Thus, the prime factorization of 216 is:

\[
216 = 2^3 \times 3^3
\]

### Step 3: Divisors of 216

To find the number of divisors, use the formula for the number of divisors based on prime factorization. If a number \( n \) has the prime factorization \( p_1^{a_1} \times p_2^{a_2} \times \ldots \times p_k^{a_k} \), then the number of divisors is:

\[
(a_1 + 1)(a_2 + 1) \ldots (a_k + 1)
\]

For 216, with the prime factorization \( 2^3 \times 3^3 \):

\[
(3 + 1)(3 + 1) = 4 \times 4 = 16
\]

So, 216 has 16 divisors.

### Step 4: Sum of Divisors

To find the sum of the divisors, use the formula for the sum of divisors based on prime factorization:

\[
\sigma(n) = (1 + p_1 + p_1^2 + \ldots + p_1^{a_1})(1 + p_2 + p_2^2 + \ldots + p_2^{a_2}) \ldots (1 + p_k + p_k^2 + \ldots + p_k^{a_k})
\]

For 216:

\[
\sigma(216) = (1 + 2 + 4 + 8)(1 + 3 + 9 + 27)
\]

Calculate each part:

- \(1 + 2 + 4 + 8 = 15\)
- \(1 + 3 + 9 + 27 = 40\)

Thus, the sum of the divisors is:

\[
15 \times 40 = 600
\]

### Final Answer

The number 216 is a perfect cube (\(6^3\)), its prime factorization is \(2^3 \times 3^3\), it has 16 divisors, and the sum of its divisors is 600. 

If the problem was specifically asking for something else related to 216, please provide more details. Otherwise, these are some key mathematical properties of the number 216.
