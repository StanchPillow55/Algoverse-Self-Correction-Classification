Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to determine the original prices of the tattered jeans and the jogger jeans, and then find out how much more the jogger jeans originally cost than the tattered jeans.

1. **Identify the cost of the tattered jeans:**
   - The tattered jeans cost $28.

2. **Determine the cost of the jogger jeans:**
   - The jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans.
   - Therefore, the cost of the jogger jeans is:
     \[
     28 - 6 = 22 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total cost of both jeans:**
   - Total cost = Cost of tattered jeans + Cost of jogger jeans
   \[
   28 + 22 = 50 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Understand the savings:**
   - Cole saved a total of $6.
   - He saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans, which means:
     \[
     \text{Savings from jogger jeans} = \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \text{ dollars}
     \]
   - The remaining savings from the tattered jeans would then be:
     \[
     6 - 2 = 4 \text{ dollars}
     \]

5. **Determine the original prices based on the savings:**
   - Let \( x \) be the original price of the jogger jeans. The sale price of the jogger jeans is:
     \[
     x - 2
     \]
   - The original price of the tattered jeans is $28, and the sale price is:
     \[
     28 - 4 = 24
     \]

6. **Set up the equation for the jogger jeans:**
   - Since the sale price of the jogger jeans is $22, we can set up the equation:
     \[
     x - 2 = 22
     \]
   - Solving for \( x \):
     \[
     x = 22 + 2 = 24 \text{ dollars}
     \]

7. **Compare the original prices:**
   - Original price of tattered jeans = $28
   - Original price of jogger jeans = $24

8. **Calculate how much more the jogger jeans originally cost than the tattered jeans:**
   - The difference in original prices is:
     \[
     24 - 28 = -4
     \]
   - This means the jogger jeans do not cost more; they actually cost $4 less than the tattered jeans.

**Final Answer:**
The jogger jeans originally cost $4 less than the tattered jeans.
