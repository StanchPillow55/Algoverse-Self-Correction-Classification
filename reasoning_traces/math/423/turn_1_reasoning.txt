==================================================

To determine how much money Mom has left after her shopping trip, we need to calculate the total amount she spent and subtract it from the amount she initially had.

1. **Initial Amount:**
   - Mom started with €55.

2. **Expenses:**
   - **Bananas:** She bought 2 packs of bananas, each costing €4.
     \[
     \text{Cost of bananas} = 2 \times 4 = €8
     \]
   - **Pears:** She bought pears for €2.
     \[
     \text{Cost of pears} = €2
     \]
   - **Asparagus:** She bought asparagus for €6.
     \[
     \text{Cost of asparagus} = €6
     \]
   - **Chicken:** She bought a chicken for €11.
     \[
     \text{Cost of chicken} = €11
     \]

3. **Total Expenses:**
   - Add up all the expenses to find the total amount spent.
     \[
     \text{Total expenses} = €8 + €2 + €6 + €11 = €27
     \]

4. **Remaining Amount:**
   - Subtract the total expenses from the initial amount to find out how much money Mom has left.
     \[
     \text{Money left} = €55 - €27 = €28
     \]

Therefore, after her shopping trip, Mom has €28 left.

**Final Answer: €28**
