Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To determine how much money Mom has left after her shopping trip, we need to calculate the total amount she spent and then subtract that from the amount she initially had.

1. **Initial Amount**: Mom started with €55.

2. **Calculating the Cost of Bananas**:
   - She bought 2 packs of bananas, and each pack costs €4.
   - Total cost for bananas = Number of packs × Cost per pack
   \[
   \text{Total cost for bananas} = 2 \times 4 = 8 \text{ euros}
   \]

3. **Calculating the Cost of Pears**:
   - The problem does not specify how many pears she bought, so we will assume she bought 1 unit for €2.
   - Total cost for pears = €2

4. **Calculating the Cost of Asparagus**:
   - She bought asparagus for €6.
   - Total cost for asparagus = €6

5. **Calculating the Cost of Chicken**:
   - She bought a chicken for €11.
   - Total cost for chicken = €11

6. **Calculating Total Spending**:
   - Now we sum up all the costs:
   \[
   \text{Total spending} = \text{Cost of bananas} + \text{Cost of pears} + \text{Cost of asparagus} + \text{Cost of chicken}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total spending} = 8 + 2 + 6 + 11
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total spending} = 27 \text{ euros}
   \]

7. **Calculating Remaining Amount**:
   - To find out how much money Mom has left, we subtract the total spending from the initial amount:
   \[
   \text{Remaining amount} = \text{Initial amount} - \text{Total spending}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Remaining amount} = 55 - 27
   \]
   \[
   \text{Remaining amount} = 28 \text{ euros}
   \]

Thus, after her shopping trip, Mom has **€28** left.

**Final Answer**: €28
