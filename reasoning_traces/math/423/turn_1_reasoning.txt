Question ID: 423
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Identify the cost of the tattered jeans**:
   - The tattered jeans cost $28.

2. **Determine the cost of the jogger jeans**:
   - The jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans.
   - Therefore, the cost of the jogger jeans is:
     \[
     28 - 6 = 22 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total cost of both jeans**:
   - Total cost = Cost of tattered jeans + Cost of jogger jeans
   \[
   28 + 22 = 50 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Understand the savings**:
   - Cole saved a total of $6 on the jeans.

5. **Determine how much he saved on each pair of jeans**:
   - Let \( x \) be the amount saved on the jogger jeans. According to the problem, he saved \( \frac{1}{3} \) of the total savings from the jogger jeans:
   \[
   x = \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \text{ dollars}
   \]
   - This means he saved $2 on the jogger jeans.

6. **Calculate the savings on the tattered jeans**:
   - Since the total savings is $6, the savings on the tattered jeans is:
   \[
   6 - 2 = 4 \text{ dollars}
   \]

7. **Determine the original prices of the jeans**:
   - Let \( P_j \) be the original price of the jogger jeans and \( P_t \) be the original price of the tattered jeans.
   - The savings on the jogger jeans means:
   \[
   P_j - 22 = 2 \implies P_j = 22 + 2 = 24 \text{ dollars}
   \]
   - The savings on the tattered jeans means:
   \[
   P_t - 28 = 4 \implies P_t = 28 + 4 = 32 \text{ dollars}
   \]

8. **Calculate how much more the jogger jeans originally cost than the tattered jeans**:
   - The difference in original prices is:
   \[
   P_j - P_t = 24 - 32 = -8 \text{ dollars}
   \]
   - This means the jogger jeans originally cost $8 less than the tattered jeans.

9. **Final answer**:
   - The jogger jeans do not cost more than the tattered jeans; they actually cost $8 less.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\text{The jogger jeans originally cost } 8 \text{ dollars less than the tattered jeans.}
\]
