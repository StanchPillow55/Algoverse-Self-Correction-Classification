To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of money Mom spent and then subtract that from the amount of money she initially had. Let's go through the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Amount:**
   - Mom started with €55.

2. **Expenses:**
   - She bought 2 packs of bananas, each costing €4. Therefore, the cost for bananas is:
     \[
     2 \times 4 = 8 \text{ euros}
     \]
   - She bought pears for €2.
   - She bought asparagus for €6.
   - She bought a chicken for €11.

3. **Total Spending:**
   - To find the total amount spent, we add up all the individual expenses:
     \[
     8 \text{ (bananas)} + 2 \text{ (pears)} + 6 \text{ (asparagus)} + 11 \text{ (chicken)} = 27 \text{ euros}
     \]

4. **Remaining Money:**
   - To find out how much money Mom has left, we subtract the total spending from the initial amount:
     \[
     55 - 27 = 28 \text{ euros}
     \]

Therefore, after all her purchases, Mom has €28 left.

**Final Answer:**
Mom has €28 left.
