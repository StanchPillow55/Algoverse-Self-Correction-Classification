To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Identify the cost of the tattered jeans**:
   The tattered jeans cost $28.

2. **Determine the cost of the jogger jeans**:
   The jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans. Therefore, the cost of the jogger jeans is:
   \[
   \text{Cost of jogger jeans} = 28 - 6 = 22 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Calculate the original prices of both jeans**:
   - Tattered jeans: $28
   - Jogger jeans: $22

4. **Calculate the total cost of both jeans**:
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = 28 + 22 = 50 \text{ dollars}
   \]

5. **Determine the total savings**:
   Cole saved a total of $6.

6. **Determine how much he saved from each type of jeans**:
   According to the problem, he saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans and the rest from the tattered jeans.
   - Savings from jogger jeans:
   \[
   \text{Savings from jogger jeans} = \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \text{ dollars}
   \]
   - Savings from tattered jeans:
   \[
   \text{Savings from tattered jeans} = 6 - 2 = 4 \text{ dollars}
   \]

7. **Calculate the original prices before the savings**:
   - Let \( x \) be the original price of the jogger jeans.
   - Since he saved $2 on the jogger jeans, the original price can be calculated as:
   \[
   x - 2 = 22 \implies x = 22 + 2 = 24 \text{ dollars}
   \]
   - The original price of the jogger jeans is $24.

   - For the tattered jeans, since he saved $4:
   \[
   28 - 4 = 24 \text{ dollars}
   \]
   - The original price of the tattered jeans remains $28.

8. **Determine how much more the jogger jeans originally cost than the tattered jeans**:
   Now we need to find the difference in the original prices:
   \[
   \text{Difference} = \text{Original price of jogger jeans} - \text{Original price of tattered jeans}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Difference} = 24 - 28 = -4 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Since the jogger jeans originally cost $24 and the tattered jeans cost $28, the jogger jeans do not cost more; they actually cost $4 less than the tattered jeans.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\text{The jogger jeans cost } 4 \text{ dollars less than the tattered jeans.}
\]
