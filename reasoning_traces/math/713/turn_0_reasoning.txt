==================================================

To determine how many mosaic tiles Mr. Boarden needs to cover two-thirds of his 36 square foot bathroom, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the area to be covered**: 
   We first need to find out how much area Mr. Boarden wants to cover. Since he wants to cover two-thirds of his bathroom, we calculate two-thirds of 36 square feet.

   \[
   \text{Area to cover} = \frac{2}{3} \times 36 \text{ sq ft}
   \]

   To perform the multiplication:

   \[
   \frac{2 \times 36}{3} = \frac{72}{3} = 24 \text{ sq ft}
   \]

   So, Mr. Boarden needs to cover 24 square feet.

2. **Calculate the number of tiles needed**:
   We know that Mr. Boarden needs 24 mosaic tiles for every square foot. Therefore, to find the total number of tiles needed for 24 square feet, we multiply the area to be covered by the number of tiles per square foot.

   \[
   \text{Total tiles needed} = 24 \text{ sq ft} \times 24 \text{ tiles/sq ft}
   \]

   Performing the multiplication:

   \[
   24 \times 24 = 576
   \]

3. **Final answer**:
   Thus, Mr. Boarden would need a total of 576 mosaic tiles to cover two-thirds of his 36 square foot bathroom.

\[
\text{Final answer: } 576 \text{ mosaic tiles}
\]
