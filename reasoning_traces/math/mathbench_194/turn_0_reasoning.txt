==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample math problem 194" refers to. Since this is not a standard reference and I don't have access to external databases or specific problem sets, I'll create a hypothetical math problem and solve it step by step. Let's assume "Sample math problem 194" is a typical algebra problem.

**Problem:**

Solve for \( x \) in the equation:

\[ 3x + 5 = 2x + 9 \]

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Identify the Equation:**
   We have the equation \( 3x + 5 = 2x + 9 \).

2. **Isolate the Variable:**
   To solve for \( x \), we need to get all terms involving \( x \) on one side of the equation and constant terms on the other side.

3. **Subtract \( 2x \) from Both Sides:**
   \[
   3x + 5 - 2x = 2x + 9 - 2x
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   x + 5 = 9
   \]

4. **Subtract 5 from Both Sides:**
   \[
   x + 5 - 5 = 9 - 5
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   x = 4
   \]

5. **Verify the Solution:**
   Substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies the equation:
   \[
   3(4) + 5 = 2(4) + 9
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   12 + 5 = 8 + 9
   \]
   \[
   17 = 17
   \]
   Since both sides of the equation are equal, our solution \( x = 4 \) is verified.

**Final Answer:**

The solution to the equation \( 3x + 5 = 2x + 9 \) is \( x = 4 \).
