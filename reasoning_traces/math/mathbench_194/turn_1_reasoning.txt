==================================================

To solve "Sample math problem 194," we first need to understand what the problem entails. Since the problem is not explicitly stated, I'll assume a generic math problem and demonstrate how to solve it step by step. Let's assume the problem is as follows:

**Problem:** Solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Understand the Equation:**
   The equation given is a linear equation in one variable, \( x \). Our goal is to isolate \( x \) on one side of the equation to find its value.

2. **Isolate the Variable:**
   To isolate \( x \), we need to perform operations that will leave \( x \) alone on one side of the equation.

   \[
   2x + 3 = 11
   \]

   Start by eliminating the constant term on the left side, which is \( +3 \). We do this by subtracting 3 from both sides of the equation:

   \[
   2x + 3 - 3 = 11 - 3
   \]

   Simplifying both sides gives:

   \[
   2x = 8
   \]

3. **Solve for \( x \):**
   Now, we need to solve for \( x \) by getting rid of the coefficient of \( x \), which is 2. We do this by dividing both sides of the equation by 2:

   \[
   \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{8}{2}
   \]

   Simplifying both sides gives:

   \[
   x = 4
   \]

4. **Verify the Solution:**
   To ensure our solution is correct, we substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation to check if it satisfies the equation:

   \[
   2(4) + 3 = 11
   \]

   Simplifying the left side:

   \[
   8 + 3 = 11
   \]

   Since both sides of the equation are equal, our solution \( x = 4 \) is verified.

### Final Answer:
The solution to the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \) is \( x = 4 \).
