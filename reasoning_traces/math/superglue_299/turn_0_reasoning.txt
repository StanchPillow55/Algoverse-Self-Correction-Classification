To solve the problem, we first need to understand what "Sample reasoning question 299" entails. Since the problem statement is not specific, I'll assume it involves a typical math problem-solving scenario. Let's create a hypothetical math problem and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**

A company produces two types of widgets: Type A and Type B. The production cost for Type A is $5 per unit, and for Type B, it is $8 per unit. The company sells Type A for $10 per unit and Type B for $15 per unit. If the company produces 100 units of Type A and 150 units of Type B, what is the total profit?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Determine the Cost of Production:**

   - For Type A: 
     \[
     \text{Cost for Type A} = \text{Number of units} \times \text{Cost per unit} = 100 \times 5 = 500
     \]

   - For Type B:
     \[
     \text{Cost for Type B} = \text{Number of units} \times \text{Cost per unit} = 150 \times 8 = 1200
     \]

   - Total production cost:
     \[
     \text{Total Production Cost} = 500 + 1200 = 1700
     \]

2. **Calculate the Revenue:**

   - For Type A:
     \[
     \text{Revenue for Type A} = \text{Number of units} \times \text{Selling price per unit} = 100 \times 10 = 1000
     \]

   - For Type B:
     \[
     \text{Revenue for Type B} = \text{Number of units} \times \text{Selling price per unit} = 150 \times 15 = 2250
     \]

   - Total revenue:
     \[
     \text{Total Revenue} = 1000 + 2250 = 3250
     \]

3. **Calculate the Profit:**

   Profit is calculated as the difference between total revenue and total production cost.

   \[
   \text{Profit} = \text{Total Revenue} - \text{Total Production Cost} = 3250 - 1700 = 1550
   \]

**Final Answer:**

The total profit from producing and selling 100 units of Type A and 150 units of Type B is $1550.
