==================================================

To solve the problem, I'll need more specific information about "Sample reasoning question 299," as it seems to refer to a specific problem from a source I don't have access to. However, I can guide you through a general approach to solving math problems by breaking down the process into clear steps. If you provide more details about the problem, I can tailor the solution more specifically.

### General Approach to Solving Math Problems

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - Read the problem carefully.
   - Identify what is being asked.
   - Determine what information is given and what is unknown.

2. **Devise a Plan:**
   - Consider possible strategies to solve the problem. This could include:
     - Drawing a diagram.
     - Writing an equation.
     - Breaking the problem into smaller parts.
     - Looking for patterns.

3. **Carry Out the Plan:**
   - Execute the chosen strategy step by step.
   - Perform calculations carefully.
   - Keep track of units and signs.

4. **Check Your Work:**
   - Review each step to ensure accuracy.
   - Verify that the solution makes sense in the context of the problem.
   - Check calculations and consider alternative methods to confirm the result.

5. **State the Final Answer:**
   - Clearly present the solution.
   - Include units if applicable.

### Example Problem and Solution

Let's consider a simple example problem:

**Problem:**
A rectangle has a length that is 3 times its width. If the perimeter of the rectangle is 48 units, what are the dimensions of the rectangle?

**Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We need to find the length and width of the rectangle.
   - The perimeter is given as 48 units.
   - The length is 3 times the width.

2. **Devise a Plan:**
   - Use the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle: \( P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width}) \).
   - Let the width be \( w \).
   - Then the length is \( 3w \).

3. **Carry Out the Plan:**
   - Substitute into the perimeter formula: 
     \[
     48 = 2 \times (3w + w)
     \]
   - Simplify the equation:
     \[
     48 = 2 \times 4w
     \]
     \[
     48 = 8w
     \]
   - Solve for \( w \):
     \[
     w = \frac{48}{8} = 6
     \]
   - Find the length:
     \[
     \text{Length} = 3w = 3 \times 6 = 18
     \]

4. **Check Your Work:**
   - Calculate the perimeter with the found dimensions:
     \[
     P = 2 \times (18 + 6) = 2 \times 24 = 48
     \]
   - The calculations are consistent with the given perimeter.

5. **State the Final Answer:**
   - The width of the rectangle is 6 units, and the length is 18 units.
