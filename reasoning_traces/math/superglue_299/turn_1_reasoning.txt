Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 299" entails. Since the question is not explicitly provided, let's assume it involves a typical math problem-solving scenario. I'll create a hypothetical problem and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**
Calculate the sum of the first 299 positive integers.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   We need to find the sum of the first 299 positive integers. This is a classic problem that can be solved using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series.

2. **Identify the Formula:**
   The sum \( S \) of the first \( n \) positive integers is given by the formula:
   \[
   S = \frac{n(n + 1)}{2}
   \]
   where \( n \) is the last integer in the series.

3. **Substitute the Values:**
   In this problem, \( n = 299 \). Substitute 299 into the formula:
   \[
   S = \frac{299(299 + 1)}{2}
   \]

4. **Calculate Inside the Parentheses:**
   First, calculate \( 299 + 1 \):
   \[
   299 + 1 = 300
   \]

5. **Multiply the Terms:**
   Next, multiply 299 by 300:
   \[
   299 \times 300 = 89700
   \]

6. **Divide by 2:**
   Finally, divide the product by 2 to find the sum:
   \[
   S = \frac{89700}{2} = 44850
   \]

7. **Conclusion:**
   The sum of the first 299 positive integers is 44,850.

**Final Answer:**
The sum of the first 299 positive integers is 44,850.
