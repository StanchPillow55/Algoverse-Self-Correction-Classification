==================================================

To solve the problem, I need more information about "Sample reasoning question 299." Since the question is not provided, I'll demonstrate how to approach a typical math problem by creating a sample problem and solving it step by step.

**Sample Problem:**

A company produces two types of products, A and B. The profit from each unit of product A is $3, and the profit from each unit of product B is $5. The company can produce a maximum of 100 units of product A and 80 units of product B per day. The company wants to maximize its profit, but it cannot produce more than 150 units in total per day due to labor constraints. How many units of each product should the company produce to maximize profit?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Define the Variables:**
   - Let \( x \) be the number of units of product A produced per day.
   - Let \( y \) be the number of units of product B produced per day.

2. **Write the Objective Function:**
   - The objective is to maximize the profit, \( P \).
   - Profit from product A = \( 3x \).
   - Profit from product B = \( 5y \).
   - Total profit, \( P = 3x + 5y \).

3. **Write the Constraints:**
   - The production constraints are:
     1. \( x \leq 100 \) (cannot produce more than 100 units of A).
     2. \( y \leq 80 \) (cannot produce more than 80 units of B).
     3. \( x + y \leq 150 \) (cannot produce more than 150 units in total).
   - Additionally, \( x \geq 0 \) and \( y \geq 0 \) because negative production is not possible.

4. **Graph the Constraints:**
   - Plot the lines \( x = 100 \), \( y = 80 \), and \( x + y = 150 \) on a graph.
   - Identify the feasible region that satisfies all constraints.

5. **Identify the Vertices of the Feasible Region:**
   - The vertices are points where the constraint lines intersect:
     - Intersection of \( x = 100 \) and \( x + y = 150 \): \( (100, 50) \).
     - Intersection of \( y = 80 \) and \( x + y = 150 \): \( (70, 80) \).
     - Intersection of \( x = 0 \) and \( y = 80 \): \( (0, 80) \).
     - Intersection of \( x = 100 \) and \( y = 0 \): \( (100, 0) \).

6. **Evaluate the Objective Function at Each Vertex:**
   - \( P(100, 50) = 3(100) + 5(50) = 300 + 250 = 550 \).
   - \( P(70, 80) = 3(70) + 5(80) = 210 + 400 = 610 \).
   - \( P(0, 80) = 3(0) + 5(80) = 0 + 400 = 400 \).
   - \( P(100, 0) = 3(100) + 5(0) = 300 + 0 = 300 \).

7. **Determine the Maximum Profit:**
   - The maximum profit is \( 610 \), which occurs at the point \( (70, 80) \).

**Final Answer:**
To maximize profit, the company should produce 70 units of product A and 80 units of product B per day, resulting in a maximum profit of $610.
