==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 299" refers to. Since the problem statement doesn't provide specific details about the question, I'll demonstrate a general approach to solving a typical math problem by using a hypothetical example. Let's assume "Sample reasoning question 299" is a math problem involving algebra, such as solving a linear equation.

**Hypothetical Problem:**
Solve the equation \(3x + 5 = 20\).

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Equation:**
   The equation \(3x + 5 = 20\) is a linear equation in one variable, \(x\). Our goal is to find the value of \(x\) that makes this equation true.

2. **Isolate the Variable:**
   To solve for \(x\), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We start by eliminating the constant term on the left side of the equation.

   \[
   3x + 5 = 20
   \]

   Subtract 5 from both sides to get:

   \[
   3x + 5 - 5 = 20 - 5
   \]

   Simplifying both sides gives:

   \[
   3x = 15
   \]

3. **Solve for \(x\):**
   Now, we need to solve for \(x\) by dividing both sides of the equation by the coefficient of \(x\), which is 3.

   \[
   \frac{3x}{3} = \frac{15}{3}
   \]

   Simplifying both sides gives:

   \[
   x = 5
   \]

4. **Verify the Solution:**
   To ensure our solution is correct, we substitute \(x = 5\) back into the original equation to verify:

   \[
   3(5) + 5 = 20
   \]

   Simplifying the left side gives:

   \[
   15 + 5 = 20
   \]

   \[
   20 = 20
   \]

   Since both sides of the equation are equal, our solution \(x = 5\) is correct.

**Final Answer:**
The solution to the equation \(3x + 5 = 20\) is \(x = 5\).

This example demonstrates a structured approach to solving a linear equation by isolating the variable, solving for it, and verifying the solution. If "Sample reasoning question 299" refers to a different type of problem, please provide additional details for a more specific solution.
