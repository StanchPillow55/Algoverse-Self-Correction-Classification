Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve "Sample math problem 181," we first need to understand what the problem is asking. Since the problem statement is not provided, let's assume a hypothetical math problem and solve it step by step.

Let's assume the problem is as follows:

**Problem:**  
Solve for \( x \) in the equation:  
\[ 3x + 5 = 20 \]

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Equation:**
   The equation given is a linear equation in one variable, \( x \). Our goal is to isolate \( x \) on one side of the equation to find its value.

2. **Isolate the Variable:**
   To isolate \( x \), we need to perform operations that will leave \( x \) alone on one side of the equation.

   Start with the equation:
   \[ 3x + 5 = 20 \]

   Subtract 5 from both sides to eliminate the constant term on the left side:
   \[ 3x + 5 - 5 = 20 - 5 \]
   \[ 3x = 15 \]

3. **Solve for \( x \):**
   Now, divide both sides by 3 to solve for \( x \):
   \[ \frac{3x}{3} = \frac{15}{3} \]
   \[ x = 5 \]

4. **Verify the Solution:**
   Substitute \( x = 5 \) back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies the equation:
   \[ 3(5) + 5 = 20 \]
   \[ 15 + 5 = 20 \]
   \[ 20 = 20 \]

   The left side equals the right side, confirming that our solution is correct.

**Final Answer:**
The solution to the equation \( 3x + 5 = 20 \) is \( x = 5 \).

This completes the solution to our assumed problem. If "Sample math problem 181" refers to a different problem, please provide the specific details so I can solve it accordingly.
