==================================================

To solve the problem, I need more details about "Sample math problem 181" as it is not specified in your request. However, I can guide you through a generic approach to solving a math problem by outlining the steps typically involved. If you provide specific details about the problem, I can tailor the solution accordingly.

### Generic Steps to Solve a Math Problem:

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - Carefully read the problem statement.
   - Identify what is being asked.
   - Note down any given information and data.

2. **Devise a Plan:**
   - Determine the type of problem (e.g., algebra, geometry, calculus).
   - Decide on the method or formula needed to solve the problem.
   - Consider drawing diagrams or making tables if applicable.

3. **Carry Out the Plan:**
   - Execute the calculations or logical steps needed.
   - Show all work, including intermediate steps.
   - Keep track of units and ensure consistency.

4. **Check Your Work:**
   - Verify each step for accuracy.
   - Ensure the final answer makes sense in the context of the problem.
   - Re-calculate if necessary to confirm the result.

5. **State the Final Answer:**
   - Clearly write down the final answer.
   - Include units if applicable.

### Example Problem and Solution:

**Problem:**
Solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).

**Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We need to find the value of \( x \) that satisfies the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).

2. **Devise a Plan:**
   - This is a simple linear equation. We can solve it by isolating \( x \).

3. **Carry Out the Plan:**
   - Start with the equation: \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).
   - Subtract 3 from both sides to isolate the term with \( x \):
     \[
     2x + 3 - 3 = 11 - 3 \implies 2x = 8
     \]
   - Divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( x \):
     \[
     \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{8}{2} \implies x = 4
     \]

4. **Check Your Work:**
   - Substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation to verify:
     \[
     2(4) + 3 = 8 + 3 = 11
     \]
   - The left-hand side equals the right-hand side, confirming our solution is correct.

5. **State the Final Answer:**
   - The solution to the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \) is \( x = 4 \).
