It seems like there might be a misunderstanding or a missing part of the question, as "Sample reasoning question 320" doesn't provide specific details or numbers to work with. However, I can guide you through a general approach to solving a math problem by using a hypothetical example. Let's assume we have a math problem to solve, and I'll demonstrate the step-by-step reasoning and calculations.

### Hypothetical Problem:
Let's say we have the following problem: 

**Problem:** A rectangle has a length that is 3 times its width. If the perimeter of the rectangle is 64 units, what are the dimensions of the rectangle?

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We need to find the dimensions (length and width) of a rectangle.
   - We know the relationship between the length and width: Length = 3 Ã— Width.
   - The perimeter of the rectangle is given as 64 units.

2. **Set Up the Equations:**
   - The formula for the perimeter \( P \) of a rectangle is:
     \[
     P = 2 \times (\text{Length} + \text{Width})
     \]
   - Substitute the given perimeter:
     \[
     64 = 2 \times (\text{Length} + \text{Width})
     \]
   - Substitute the relationship between length and width:
     \[
     \text{Length} = 3 \times \text{Width}
     \]
   - Substitute this into the perimeter equation:
     \[
     64 = 2 \times (3 \times \text{Width} + \text{Width})
     \]

3. **Simplify and Solve the Equation:**
   - Simplify inside the parentheses:
     \[
     64 = 2 \times (4 \times \text{Width})
     \]
   - Simplify further:
     \[
     64 = 8 \times \text{Width}
     \]
   - Solve for Width:
     \[
     \text{Width} = \frac{64}{8} = 8
     \]

4. **Find the Length:**
   - Use the relationship between length and width:
     \[
     \text{Length} = 3 \times \text{Width} = 3 \times 8 = 24
     \]

5. **Verify the Solution:**
   - Check the perimeter with the found dimensions:
     \[
     P = 2 \times (24 + 8) = 2 \times 32 = 64
     \]
   - The calculated perimeter matches the given perimeter, confirming our solution is correct.

### Final Answer:
The dimensions of the rectangle are:
- Width = 8 units
- Length = 24 units

This approach can be applied to various math problems by understanding the problem, setting up equations, solving them, and verifying the solution. If you have a specific problem in mind, please provide more details, and I can assist you further.
