==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample reasoning question 320," we need to first understand what the problem is asking. However, the problem statement provided is incomplete and lacks specific details or numerical information. Therefore, I will demonstrate a general approach to solving a typical math problem by creating a hypothetical example based on the number "320" mentioned in the question.

Let's assume the problem is as follows:

**Problem:** 
Find the sum of all positive divisors of the number 320.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Prime Factorization:**
   First, we need to find the prime factorization of 320. We start by dividing 320 by the smallest prime number, which is 2.

   \[
   320 \div 2 = 160
   \]
   \[
   160 \div 2 = 80
   \]
   \[
   80 \div 2 = 40
   \]
   \[
   40 \div 2 = 20
   \]
   \[
   20 \div 2 = 10
   \]
   \[
   10 \div 2 = 5
   \]

   Now, 5 is a prime number, so we stop here. The prime factorization of 320 is:
   \[
   320 = 2^6 \times 5^1
   \]

2. **Finding the Sum of Divisors:**
   To find the sum of all positive divisors of a number given its prime factorization, we use the formula:
   \[
   \sigma(n) = (1 + p_1 + p_1^2 + \ldots + p_1^{k_1})(1 + p_2 + p_2^2 + \ldots + p_2^{k_2}) \ldots (1 + p_m + p_m^2 + \ldots + p_m^{k_m})
   \]
   where \( n = p_1^{k_1} \times p_2^{k_2} \times \ldots \times p_m^{k_m} \).

   For 320, which is \( 2^6 \times 5^1 \), the sum of divisors is:
   \[
   (1 + 2 + 2^2 + 2^3 + 2^4 + 2^5 + 2^6)(1 + 5)
   \]

   Calculate each part separately:
   \[
   1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + 16 + 32 + 64 = 127
   \]
   \[
   1 + 5 = 6
   \]

   Multiply these results:
   \[
   127 \times 6 = 762
   \]

3. **Conclusion:**
   The sum of all positive divisors of 320 is 762.

**Final Answer:**
The sum of all positive divisors of 320 is 762.
