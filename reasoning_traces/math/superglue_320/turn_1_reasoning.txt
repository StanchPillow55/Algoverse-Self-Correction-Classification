==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample reasoning question 320," we need to first understand what the problem is asking. However, the question as presented is incomplete and lacks specific details or context. Therefore, I will assume that "Sample reasoning question 320" is a placeholder for a typical math problem. Let's create a hypothetical math problem and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**

Calculate the sum of all even numbers between 1 and 320.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Identify the Even Numbers:**
   - Even numbers are integers divisible by 2.
   - The smallest even number greater than 1 is 2.
   - The largest even number less than or equal to 320 is 320.

2. **List the Sequence of Even Numbers:**
   - The sequence of even numbers between 1 and 320 is: 2, 4, 6, ..., 320.

3. **Determine the Number of Terms in the Sequence:**
   - This sequence is an arithmetic sequence where the first term \( a_1 = 2 \) and the last term \( a_n = 320 \).
   - The common difference \( d = 2 \).
   - The formula for the \( n \)-th term of an arithmetic sequence is:
     \[
     a_n = a_1 + (n-1) \cdot d
     \]
   - Plugging in the known values:
     \[
     320 = 2 + (n-1) \cdot 2
     \]
   - Simplifying:
     \[
     320 = 2 + 2n - 2
     \]
     \[
     320 = 2n
     \]
     \[
     n = \frac{320}{2} = 160
     \]
   - There are 160 even numbers between 1 and 320.

4. **Calculate the Sum of the Sequence:**
   - The sum \( S_n \) of an arithmetic sequence is given by:
     \[
     S_n = \frac{n}{2} \cdot (a_1 + a_n)
     \]
   - Substituting the known values:
     \[
     S_{160} = \frac{160}{2} \cdot (2 + 320)
     \]
     \[
     S_{160} = 80 \cdot 322
     \]
   - Calculating the product:
     \[
     S_{160} = 80 \cdot 322 = 25760
     \]

**Final Answer:**

The sum of all even numbers between 1 and 320 is 25,760.
