==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample reasoning question 320," we need to first understand what the problem is asking. However, the question provided is not clear or specific, so I will assume that "Sample reasoning question 320" is a placeholder for a typical math problem. Since no specific math problem is given, I'll create a sample problem and solve it step by step.

Let's assume the problem is as follows:

**Problem:**  
A store sells apples for $2 each and bananas for $1.50 each. If a customer buys a total of 10 fruits consisting of apples and bananas and spends a total of $17, how many apples and how many bananas did the customer buy?

**Solution:**

To solve this problem, we need to set up a system of equations based on the information given.

1. **Define the variables:**
   - Let \( a \) be the number of apples.
   - Let \( b \) be the number of bananas.

2. **Set up the equations:**
   - The total number of fruits is 10:
     \[
     a + b = 10
     \]
   - The total cost of the fruits is $17:
     \[
     2a + 1.5b = 17
     \]

3. **Solve the system of equations:**

   We have the following system of equations:
   \[
   \begin{align*}
   a + b &= 10 \quad \text{(Equation 1)} \\
   2a + 1.5b &= 17 \quad \text{(Equation 2)}
   \end{align*}
   \]

   First, solve Equation 1 for \( b \):
   \[
   b = 10 - a
   \]

   Substitute \( b = 10 - a \) into Equation 2:
   \[
   2a + 1.5(10 - a) = 17
   \]

   Simplify and solve for \( a \):
   \[
   2a + 15 - 1.5a = 17
   \]
   \[
   0.5a + 15 = 17
   \]
   \[
   0.5a = 2
   \]
   \[
   a = \frac{2}{0.5} = 4
   \]

   Now that we have \( a = 4 \), substitute back into Equation 1 to find \( b \):
   \[
   4 + b = 10
   \]
   \[
   b = 10 - 4 = 6
   \]

4. **Conclusion:**

   The customer bought 4 apples and 6 bananas.

**Final Answer:**
The customer bought 4 apples and 6 bananas.
