==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 320" refers to. Since the question is not explicitly stated, I will assume that it is a placeholder for a specific math problem. Without the actual content of the problem, I will create a hypothetical math problem and solve it step by step.

Let's assume "Sample reasoning question 320" is the following math problem:

**Problem:**  
A rectangle has a length that is 3 times its width. If the perimeter of the rectangle is 64 units, what are the dimensions of the rectangle?

**Step-by-step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We have a rectangle with a length (L) and a width (W).
   - The length is 3 times the width: \( L = 3W \).
   - The perimeter of the rectangle is 64 units.

2. **Recall the Formula for Perimeter:**
   - The perimeter (P) of a rectangle is given by the formula:
     \[
     P = 2L + 2W
     \]

3. **Substitute the Known Values:**
   - We know the perimeter is 64 units, so:
     \[
     2L + 2W = 64
     \]

4. **Substitute the Expression for Length:**
   - Since \( L = 3W \), substitute \( L \) in the perimeter equation:
     \[
     2(3W) + 2W = 64
     \]

5. **Simplify the Equation:**
   - Simplify the terms:
     \[
     6W + 2W = 64
     \]
   - Combine like terms:
     \[
     8W = 64
     \]

6. **Solve for Width (W):**
   - Divide both sides by 8 to solve for \( W \):
     \[
     W = \frac{64}{8} = 8
     \]

7. **Find the Length (L):**
   - Use the relationship \( L = 3W \) to find \( L \):
     \[
     L = 3 \times 8 = 24
     \]

8. **Verify the Solution:**
   - Check if the dimensions satisfy the perimeter equation:
     \[
     2L + 2W = 2(24) + 2(8) = 48 + 16 = 64
     \]
   - The calculated perimeter matches the given perimeter, confirming the solution is correct.

**Final Answer:**
The dimensions of the rectangle are:
- Width (W) = 8 units
- Length (L) = 24 units
