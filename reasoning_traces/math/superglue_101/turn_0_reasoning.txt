==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to understand what "Sample reasoning question 101" entails. However, since the question is not explicitly defined, I'll guide you through a generic approach to solving a reasoning problem, which can be applied to various types of questions.

### Step-by-Step Approach:

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - Carefully read the problem statement.
   - Identify what is being asked.
   - Determine what information is given and what needs to be found.

2. **Identify the Type of Problem:**
   - Is it a logical reasoning problem, a mathematical calculation, or a combination of both?
   - Determine if there are any patterns, sequences, or relationships involved.

3. **Plan a Strategy:**
   - Decide on a method to solve the problem. This could involve:
     - Drawing diagrams or charts.
     - Writing equations or inequalities.
     - Using logical deduction or elimination.

4. **Execute the Plan:**
   - Carry out the calculations or logical steps as per the chosen strategy.
   - Ensure each step is justified and follows logically from the previous one.

5. **Check Your Work:**
   - Verify each step to ensure there are no errors.
   - Re-evaluate the final answer to ensure it makes sense in the context of the problem.

6. **State the Final Answer:**
   - Clearly present the solution, ensuring it answers the question posed.

### Example Application:

Since "Sample reasoning question 101" is not specific, let's assume a simple logical reasoning problem:

**Problem:** If all cats are mammals and some mammals are dogs, can we conclude that some cats are dogs?

**Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We have two premises:
     1. All cats are mammals.
     2. Some mammals are dogs.
   - We need to determine if we can conclude that some cats are dogs.

2. **Identify the Type of Problem:**
   - This is a logical reasoning problem involving categorical syllogism.

3. **Plan a Strategy:**
   - Use Venn diagrams or logical deduction to analyze the relationships.

4. **Execute the Plan:**
   - Draw a Venn diagram:
     - Circle A represents all mammals.
     - Circle B (inside A) represents all cats.
     - Circle C (partially overlapping A) represents some dogs.
   - From the diagram, it's clear that while all cats are within the mammal circle, the dog circle only partially overlaps with the mammal circle and does not necessarily overlap with the cat circle.

5. **Check Your Work:**
   - Review the Venn diagram and logical deductions.
   - Ensure that the conclusion logically follows from the premises.

6. **State the Final Answer:**
   - Based on the premises, we cannot conclude that some cats are dogs. The overlap between cats and dogs is not guaranteed by the given information.

**Final Answer:** No, we cannot conclude that some cats are dogs based on the given premises.

This structured approach can be adapted to various reasoning problems, ensuring a thorough and logical solution process.
