Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem effectively, let's first clarify the task at hand. The problem is labeled as "Sample reasoning question 101," but it doesn't provide specific details or numbers to work with. This suggests that the task might be more about demonstrating a structured approach to problem-solving rather than solving a specific mathematical problem.

Let's outline a general approach to solving a math problem, which can be applied to a variety of scenarios:

### Step 1: Understand the Problem
- **Identify what is being asked.** Determine the goal of the problem. Are we solving for a variable, proving a theorem, or calculating a specific value?
- **Identify the given information.** What data or conditions are provided? Are there any constraints or assumptions?

### Step 2: Devise a Plan
- **Choose a strategy.** Depending on the problem, different strategies might be applicable, such as:
  - Algebraic manipulation
  - Drawing a diagram
  - Logical reasoning
  - Using formulas or theorems
  - Breaking the problem into smaller parts

### Step 3: Carry Out the Plan
- **Execute the chosen strategy.** Carefully perform calculations or logical steps. Ensure each step follows logically from the previous one.
- **Keep track of units and signs.** This is crucial in problems involving measurements or directions.

### Step 4: Review/Check Your Work
- **Verify each step.** Ensure that each part of the solution is correct and that the logic is sound.
- **Check the final answer.** Does it make sense in the context of the problem? Is it reasonable given the initial conditions?

### Step 5: State the Final Answer
- **Clearly present the solution.** Make sure the answer is clearly stated and highlighted, so it is easy to identify.

Since the problem doesn't provide specific details, let's apply this framework to a hypothetical math problem for demonstration:

### Hypothetical Problem: Solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).

#### Step 1: Understand the Problem
- We need to solve for \( x \).
- The given equation is \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).

#### Step 2: Devise a Plan
- We can use algebraic manipulation to isolate \( x \).

#### Step 3: Carry Out the Plan
1. Subtract 3 from both sides of the equation:
   \[
   2x + 3 - 3 = 11 - 3
   \]
   \[
   2x = 8
   \]
2. Divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( x \):
   \[
   \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{8}{2}
   \]
   \[
   x = 4
   \]

#### Step 4: Review/Check Your Work
- Substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation to verify:
  \[
  2(4) + 3 = 8 + 3 = 11
  \]
- The left side equals the right side, confirming our solution is correct.

#### Step 5: State the Final Answer
- The solution to the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \) is \( x = 4 \).

This structured approach ensures clarity and accuracy in solving mathematical problems. If you have a specific problem or additional details, feel free to provide them for a more tailored solution.
