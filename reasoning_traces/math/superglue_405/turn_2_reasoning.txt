==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 405" entails. Since the problem statement is not specific, I'll assume it's a placeholder for a typical math problem. Let's create a hypothetical problem and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**

A company produces two types of widgets: Type A and Type B. The company sells Type A widgets for $50 each and Type B widgets for $70 each. Last month, the company sold a total of 500 widgets and made $28,000 in revenue. How many of each type of widget did the company sell?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( x \) be the number of Type A widgets sold.
   - Let \( y \) be the number of Type B widgets sold.

2. **Set Up Equations:**
   - From the problem, we know the total number of widgets sold is 500. Therefore, the first equation is:
     \[
     x + y = 500
     \]
   - We also know the total revenue is $28,000. The revenue from Type A widgets is \( 50x \) and from Type B widgets is \( 70y \). Therefore, the second equation is:
     \[
     50x + 70y = 28000
     \]

3. **Solve the System of Equations:**
   - We have the system of equations:
     \[
     \begin{align*}
     x + y &= 500 \\
     50x + 70y &= 28000
     \end{align*}
     \]
   - Solve the first equation for \( y \):
     \[
     y = 500 - x
     \]
   - Substitute \( y = 500 - x \) into the second equation:
     \[
     50x + 70(500 - x) = 28000
     \]
   - Simplify and solve for \( x \):
     \[
     50x + 35000 - 70x = 28000
     \]
     \[
     -20x + 35000 = 28000
     \]
     \[
     -20x = 28000 - 35000
     \]
     \[
     -20x = -7000
     \]
     \[
     x = \frac{-7000}{-20}
     \]
     \[
     x = 350
     \]

4. **Find \( y \):**
   - Substitute \( x = 350 \) back into the equation \( y = 500 - x \):
     \[
     y = 500 - 350
     \]
     \[
     y = 150
     \]

5. **Verify the Solution:**
   - Check the total number of widgets:
     \[
     x + y = 350 + 150 = 500
     \]
   - Check the total revenue:
     \[
     50x + 70y = 50(350) + 70(150) = 17500 + 10500 = 28000
     \]

Both conditions are satisfied, confirming our solution is correct.

**Final Answer:**
The company sold 350 Type A widgets and 150 Type B widgets.
