==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 405" entails. Since the question is not explicitly provided, I'll create a hypothetical math problem and solve it step by step. Let's assume the problem is as follows:

**Problem:**
A rectangle has a length that is 3 times its width. If the perimeter of the rectangle is 48 units, find the dimensions of the rectangle.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( w \) be the width of the rectangle.
   - Then, the length \( l \) of the rectangle is \( 3w \) because the length is 3 times the width.

2. **Perimeter Formula:**
   - The formula for the perimeter \( P \) of a rectangle is given by:
     \[
     P = 2l + 2w
     \]
   - We know the perimeter is 48 units, so:
     \[
     48 = 2(3w) + 2w
     \]

3. **Simplify the Equation:**
   - Substitute \( l = 3w \) into the perimeter equation:
     \[
     48 = 6w + 2w
     \]
   - Combine like terms:
     \[
     48 = 8w
     \]

4. **Solve for \( w \):**
   - Divide both sides of the equation by 8 to solve for \( w \):
     \[
     w = \frac{48}{8} = 6
     \]

5. **Find the Length \( l \):**
   - Since \( l = 3w \), substitute \( w = 6 \) into the equation for \( l \):
     \[
     l = 3 \times 6 = 18
     \]

6. **Verify the Solution:**
   - Check the perimeter with the found dimensions:
     \[
     P = 2l + 2w = 2(18) + 2(6) = 36 + 12 = 48
     \]
   - The calculated perimeter matches the given perimeter, confirming our solution is correct.

**Final Answer:**
The dimensions of the rectangle are:
- Width \( w = 6 \) units
- Length \( l = 18 \) units
