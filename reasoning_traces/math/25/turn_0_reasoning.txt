==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to determine how many tennis balls Ralph did not hit after practicing with the machine. We will break down the problem step by step.

1. **Total Tennis Balls Loaded**: Ralph loads the machine with a total of 175 tennis balls.

2. **First Batch of Tennis Balls**: Ralph practices with the first 100 tennis balls.
   - He hits \( \frac{2}{5} \) of these balls.
   - To find out how many he hit, we calculate:
     \[
     \text{Balls hit from first batch} = \frac{2}{5} \times 100 = 40
     \]

3. **Second Batch of Tennis Balls**: Ralph then practices with the next 75 tennis balls.
   - He hits \( \frac{1}{3} \) of these balls.
   - To find out how many he hit, we calculate:
     \[
     \text{Balls hit from second batch} = \frac{1}{3} \times 75 = 25
     \]

4. **Total Balls Hit**: Now we can find the total number of balls Ralph hit by adding the balls hit from both batches:
   \[
   \text{Total balls hit} = \text{Balls hit from first batch} + \text{Balls hit from second batch} = 40 + 25 = 65
   \]

5. **Balls Not Hit**: To find out how many balls Ralph did not hit, we subtract the total balls hit from the total balls loaded:
   \[
   \text{Balls not hit} = \text{Total tennis balls} - \text{Total balls hit} = 175 - 65 = 110
   \]

Thus, the final answer is that Ralph did not hit **110 tennis balls**.
