==================================================

To find out how many boxes of pizza Marie ordered, we will first calculate the total cost of the items she ordered other than the pizza, and then use that information to determine how many boxes of pizza she could afford with the remaining money.

1. **Calculate the cost of the chicken meal:**
   \[
   \text{Cost of chicken meal} = 12 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Calculate the cost of the milk:**
   \[
   \text{Cost of 5 packs of milk} = 5 \times 3 = 15 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Calculate the cost of the apples:**
   \[
   \text{Cost of 4 apples} = 4 \times 1.50 = 6 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Now, add up the costs of the chicken meal, milk, and apples:**
   \[
   \text{Total cost of chicken meal, milk, and apples} = 12 + 15 + 6 = 33 \text{ dollars}
   \]

5. **Determine how much money Marie has left for the pizza:**
   \[
   \text{Total amount paid} = 50 \text{ dollars}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Amount left for pizza} = 50 - 33 = 17 \text{ dollars}
   \]

6. **Calculate how many boxes of pizza Marie can buy with the remaining money:**
   Each box of pizza costs $8.50. We can find the number of boxes by dividing the remaining money by the cost per box:
   \[
   \text{Number of boxes of pizza} = \frac{17}{8.50}
   \]

   Performing the division:
   \[
   \frac{17}{8.50} \approx 2
   \]

   Since Marie cannot order a fraction of a box, we take the whole number part of the result, which is 2.

7. **Verify the total cost if Marie orders 2 boxes of pizza:**
   \[
   \text{Cost of 2 boxes of pizza} = 2 \times 8.50 = 17 \text{ dollars}
   \]

8. **Check the total amount spent:**
   \[
   \text{Total spent} = 33 + 17 = 50 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Since the total matches the amount Marie paid, our calculations are consistent.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{2}
\] 

Marie ordered 2 boxes of pizza.
