==================================================

First, let's determine how many balls Ralph hit from the first 100 balls. 

We know that he hit 2/5 of the first 100 balls. To find out how many balls that is, we multiply 100 by 2/5:

100 * 2/5 = 40 balls

Next, let's determine how many balls Ralph hit from the next 75 balls. 

We know that he hit 1/3 of the next 75 balls. To find out how many balls that is, we multiply 75 by 1/3:

75 * 1/3 = 25 balls

Now, we add the number of balls Ralph hit from the first 100 balls and the next 75 balls to find out how many balls he hit in total:

40 balls + 25 balls = 65 balls

We know that Ralph started with 175 balls. To find out how many balls Ralph did not hit, we subtract the number of balls he hit from the total number of balls:

175 balls - 65 balls = 110 balls

So, Ralph did not hit 110 tennis balls.
