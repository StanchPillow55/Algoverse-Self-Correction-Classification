==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to determine how many berries the sloth must pick up per trip in order to collect a total of 24 berries in 8 hours, given that each trip takes 4 hours.

### Step 1: Determine the number of trips the sloth can make in 8 hours.

Since each trip takes 4 hours, we can calculate the number of trips the sloth can make in 8 hours as follows:

\[
\text{Number of trips} = \frac{\text{Total time available}}{\text{Time per trip}} = \frac{8 \text{ hours}}{4 \text{ hours/trip}} = 2 \text{ trips}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the number of berries needed per trip.

The sloth wants to collect a total of 24 berries over the course of these 2 trips. To find out how many berries he needs to pick up per trip, we divide the total number of berries by the number of trips:

\[
\text{Berries per trip} = \frac{\text{Total berries}}{\text{Number of trips}} = \frac{24 \text{ berries}}{2 \text{ trips}} = 12 \text{ berries/trip}
\]

### Conclusion

The least number of berries the sloth can pick up per trip down to the ground, in order to collect a total of 24 berries in 8 hours, is:

\[
\boxed{12}
\]
