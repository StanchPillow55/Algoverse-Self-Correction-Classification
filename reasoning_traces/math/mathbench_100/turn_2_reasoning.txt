Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample math problem 100" refers to. Since the problem is not explicitly stated, let's assume it involves a basic arithmetic operation with the number 100. 

Let's consider a simple arithmetic problem involving the number 100:

**Problem:** What is 100 divided by 4?

**Step-by-step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Operation:**
   - We need to divide 100 by 4. Division is the process of determining how many times one number is contained within another.

2. **Set Up the Division:**
   - We write the division as \( 100 \div 4 \).

3. **Perform the Division:**
   - Start by seeing how many times 4 can fit into the first digit of 100, which is 1. Since 4 is greater than 1, it fits 0 times.
   - Move to the first two digits, which is 10. Determine how many times 4 fits into 10. It fits 2 times because \( 4 \times 2 = 8 \).
   - Subtract 8 from 10, which leaves a remainder of 2.
   - Bring down the next digit, which is 0, making the number 20.
   - Determine how many times 4 fits into 20. It fits 5 times because \( 4 \times 5 = 20 \).
   - Subtract 20 from 20, which leaves a remainder of 0.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The division \( 100 \div 4 \) results in 25 with no remainder.

5. **Verify the Result:**
   - To verify, multiply the quotient by the divisor: \( 25 \times 4 = 100 \).
   - Since the product is equal to the original number, the division is correct.

**Final Answer:**
The result of dividing 100 by 4 is 25.
