==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 100," we first need to clarify what the problem is asking. Since "Sample math problem 100" is not a specific mathematical question, I'll assume you want me to demonstrate how to solve a typical math problem that involves the number 100. Let's consider a problem involving basic arithmetic operations with the number 100.

**Problem:**
Calculate the result of the following expression: \( 100 + 50 \times 2 - 30 \div 5 \).

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Identify the Order of Operations:**
   According to the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS), we need to perform calculations in the following order:
   - Parentheses/Brackets
   - Exponents/Orders (such as squares and square roots, etc.)
   - Multiplication and Division (from left to right)
   - Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)

2. **Perform Multiplication and Division:**
   - First, perform the multiplication: \( 50 \times 2 = 100 \).
   - Next, perform the division: \( 30 \div 5 = 6 \).

3. **Substitute Back into the Expression:**
   After performing the multiplication and division, substitute these results back into the original expression:
   \[
   100 + 100 - 6
   \]

4. **Perform Addition and Subtraction:**
   - First, perform the addition: \( 100 + 100 = 200 \).
   - Then, perform the subtraction: \( 200 - 6 = 194 \).

5. **Final Answer:**
   The result of the expression \( 100 + 50 \times 2 - 30 \div 5 \) is \( 194 \).

Therefore, the final answer is \( 194 \).
