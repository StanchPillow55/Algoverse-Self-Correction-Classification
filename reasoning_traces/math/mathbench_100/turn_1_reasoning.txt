==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 100," we need to first understand what the problem is asking. However, the problem statement "Sample math problem 100" is not clear or specific. It seems to be a placeholder or an incomplete problem statement. 

To proceed, let's assume that "Sample math problem 100" refers to a typical math problem that involves the number 100. One common type of problem involving the number 100 is finding its factors, calculating its square root, or solving an equation where 100 is a part of the expression. 

Let's explore a few possibilities:

### 1. Finding the Factors of 100
To find the factors of 100, we need to determine all the integers that divide 100 without leaving a remainder.

- Start with 1: \( 100 \div 1 = 100 \)
- Next, try 2: \( 100 \div 2 = 50 \)
- Try 3: \( 100 \div 3 \) is not an integer.
- Try 4: \( 100 \div 4 = 25 \)
- Try 5: \( 100 \div 5 = 20 \)
- Try 6: \( 100 \div 6 \) is not an integer.
- Try 7: \( 100 \div 7 \) is not an integer.
- Try 8: \( 100 \div 8 \) is not an integer.
- Try 9: \( 100 \div 9 \) is not an integer.
- Try 10: \( 100 \div 10 = 10 \)

The factors of 100 are: 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 20, 25, 50, and 100.

### 2. Calculating the Square Root of 100
The square root of a number is a value that, when multiplied by itself, gives the original number.

\[
\sqrt{100} = 10
\]

This is because \( 10 \times 10 = 100 \).

### 3. Solving an Equation Involving 100
Suppose we have a simple equation: \( x + 50 = 100 \).

To solve for \( x \), we subtract 50 from both sides:

\[
x + 50 - 50 = 100 - 50
\]

\[
x = 50
\]

### Conclusion
Since the original problem statement was not specific, I explored several common mathematical tasks involving the number 100. If the problem intended was different, please provide more details or clarify the problem statement.

Final Answer:
- Factors of 100: 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 20, 25, 50, 100
- Square root of 100: 10
- Solution to \( x + 50 = 100 \): \( x = 50 \)
