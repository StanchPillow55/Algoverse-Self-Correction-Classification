==================================================

To solve the problem effectively, let's first clarify the question. It seems that "Sample reasoning question 170" is a placeholder or reference to a specific problem that is not explicitly provided here. Without the actual content of "Sample reasoning question 170," I cannot solve it directly. However, I can guide you on how to approach a typical math reasoning problem by outlining a general problem-solving strategy.

### General Problem-Solving Strategy:

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - Read the problem carefully.
   - Identify what is being asked.
   - Determine what information is given and what needs to be found.

2. **Devise a Plan:**
   - Consider possible strategies to solve the problem, such as:
     - Drawing a diagram.
     - Creating a table.
     - Writing an equation.
     - Looking for patterns.
     - Breaking the problem into smaller parts.

3. **Carry Out the Plan:**
   - Implement the chosen strategy step by step.
   - Perform calculations carefully.
   - Keep track of units and ensure consistency.

4. **Check Your Work:**
   - Review each step to ensure accuracy.
   - Verify that the solution makes sense in the context of the problem.
   - Check calculations and logic.

5. **State the Final Answer:**
   - Clearly write the final answer.
   - Include units if applicable.

### Example Problem and Solution:

Let's consider an example problem to illustrate this strategy:

**Example Problem:**
A rectangle has a length that is twice its width. If the perimeter of the rectangle is 36 units, find the dimensions of the rectangle.

**Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We need to find the length and width of the rectangle.
   - Given: Perimeter = 36 units, Length = 2 Ã— Width.

2. **Devise a Plan:**
   - Use the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle: \( P = 2 \times (\text{Length} + \text{Width}) \).

3. **Carry Out the Plan:**
   - Let the width be \( w \).
   - Then the length is \( 2w \).
   - Substitute into the perimeter formula: 
     \[
     36 = 2 \times (2w + w)
     \]
   - Simplify and solve for \( w \):
     \[
     36 = 2 \times 3w
     \]
     \[
     36 = 6w
     \]
     \[
     w = \frac{36}{6} = 6
     \]
   - Find the length:
     \[
     \text{Length} = 2w = 2 \times 6 = 12
     \]

4. **Check Your Work:**
   - Calculate the perimeter with the found dimensions:
     \[
     P = 2 \times (12 + 6) = 2 \times 18 = 36
     \]
   - The calculations are consistent with the given perimeter.

5. **State the Final Answer:**
   - The width of the rectangle is 6 units, and the length is 12 units.
