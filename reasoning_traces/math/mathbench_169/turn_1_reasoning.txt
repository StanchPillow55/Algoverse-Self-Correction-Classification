==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 169," we first need to understand what the problem is asking. However, the phrase "Sample math problem 169" does not provide specific details about the problem itself. It seems to be a placeholder or a reference to a specific problem that is not fully described here.

To proceed, let's assume that "Sample math problem 169" refers to a common type of math problem involving the number 169. One possibility is that it involves finding the square root of 169, as this is a common type of problem involving perfect squares.

Let's work through this assumption:

### Problem: Find the square root of 169.

#### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We need to find a number that, when multiplied by itself, gives 169.

2. **Identify Perfect Squares:**
   - Recall that perfect squares are numbers like 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, etc., which are squares of integers.
   - 169 is a perfect square.

3. **Calculate the Square Root:**
   - We need to find an integer \( x \) such that \( x^2 = 169 \).

4. **Try Possible Values:**
   - Start with smaller integers and work upwards:
     - \( 10^2 = 100 \)
     - \( 11^2 = 121 \)
     - \( 12^2 = 144 \)
     - \( 13^2 = 169 \)

5. **Verify the Solution:**
   - \( 13 \times 13 = 169 \), so \( 13^2 = 169 \).

6. **Conclusion:**
   - The square root of 169 is 13.

### Final Answer:
The square root of 169 is 13.

If "Sample math problem 169" refers to a different type of problem, please provide additional details or context so that I can assist you more accurately.
