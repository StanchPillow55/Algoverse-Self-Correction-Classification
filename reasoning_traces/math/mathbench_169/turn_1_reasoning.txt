Question ID: mathbench_169
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 169," we need to first understand what the problem is asking. However, the phrase "Sample math problem 169" is not specific enough to determine the exact nature of the problem. It could refer to a problem number in a textbook or a specific type of math problem. Without additional context, I will assume this is a placeholder for a specific math problem.

Since the problem is not specified, let's consider a common math problem involving the number 169. One such problem could be finding the square root of 169.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We need to find the square root of 169. The square root of a number \( x \) is a number \( y \) such that \( y^2 = x \).

2. **Calculate the Square Root:**
   - We are looking for a number \( y \) such that \( y^2 = 169 \).

3. **Try Perfect Squares:**
   - Start with smaller numbers and work upwards:
     - \( 10^2 = 100 \)
     - \( 11^2 = 121 \)
     - \( 12^2 = 144 \)
     - \( 13^2 = 169 \)

4. **Verify the Calculation:**
   - \( 13 \times 13 = 169 \)
   - Therefore, \( 13^2 = 169 \).

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The square root of 169 is 13.

### Final Answer:
The square root of 169 is 13.

This solution assumes that the problem was to find the square root of 169. If the original problem was different, please provide more context or details so I can assist you accurately.
