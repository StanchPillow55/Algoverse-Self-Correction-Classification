Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 169," we need to first understand what the problem is asking. However, since "Sample math problem 169" is not a specific problem statement, I'll assume it's a placeholder for a specific math problem. 

Let's create a hypothetical math problem for the purpose of this exercise:

**Problem Statement:**
Calculate the square root of 169.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We are asked to find the square root of 169. The square root of a number \( x \) is a number \( y \) such that \( y^2 = x \).

2. **Identify the Mathematical Operation:**
   - The operation required is finding the square root, denoted as \( \sqrt{169} \).

3. **Calculate the Square Root:**
   - We need to determine which number, when multiplied by itself, equals 169.
   - Let's test some numbers:
     - \( 10 \times 10 = 100 \) (too low)
     - \( 12 \times 12 = 144 \) (still too low)
     - \( 13 \times 13 = 169 \) (exact match)

4. **Verify the Calculation:**
   - To ensure accuracy, let's verify:
     - \( 13 \times 13 = 169 \)
     - This confirms that 13 is indeed the square root of 169.

5. **Consider Possible Negative Root:**
   - In mathematics, every positive number has two square roots: one positive and one negative.
   - Therefore, the square roots of 169 are \( 13 \) and \( -13 \).

6. **Final Answer:**
   - The principal (non-negative) square root of 169 is \( 13 \).
   - If considering both roots, the square roots of 169 are \( 13 \) and \( -13 \).

Thus, the final answer is:

\[ \sqrt{169} = 13 \]

And if considering both roots:

\[ \sqrt{169} = \pm 13 \]
