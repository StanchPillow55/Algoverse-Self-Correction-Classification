==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 169," we first need to understand what the problem is asking. However, the problem statement is not clear from the given text. It seems like "Sample math problem 169" is a placeholder or a reference to a specific problem that is not fully described here. 

To proceed, let's assume that "Sample math problem 169" refers to a problem involving the number 169. A common mathematical problem involving 169 could be to find its square root, determine its factors, or verify if it's a perfect square. Let's explore these possibilities:

### 1. Check if 169 is a Perfect Square

To determine if 169 is a perfect square, we need to find an integer \( n \) such that \( n^2 = 169 \).

- Start by estimating the square root of 169. Since \( 12^2 = 144 \) and \( 13^2 = 169 \), we can see that 169 is indeed a perfect square.
- Therefore, the square root of 169 is 13.

### 2. Find the Factors of 169

To find the factors of 169, we need to find all integers \( n \) such that \( 169 \div n \) is also an integer.

- Start with 1: \( 169 \div 1 = 169 \)
- Check 2: \( 169 \div 2 \) is not an integer (since 169 is odd).
- Check 3: \( 169 \div 3 \) is not an integer.
- Continue this process up to 13:
  - \( 169 \div 13 = 13 \), which is an integer.
- Therefore, the factors of 169 are 1, 13, and 169.

### 3. Verify if 169 is a Prime Number

A prime number has exactly two distinct positive divisors: 1 and itself. Since 169 has more than two factors (1, 13, and 169), it is not a prime number.

### Conclusion

Based on the assumptions made about "Sample math problem 169," we have determined the following:

- 169 is a perfect square, and its square root is 13.
- The factors of 169 are 1, 13, and 169.
- 169 is not a prime number.

If the original problem intended something else, please provide additional details or context for a more accurate solution. However, based on the assumptions and typical problems involving the number 169, these are the conclusions we can draw.

**Final Answer:**
- The square root of 169 is 13.
- The factors of 169 are 1, 13, and 169.
- 169 is not a prime number.
