==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 169," we need to first understand what the problem is asking. However, since "Sample math problem 169" is not a specific question, I will assume it is a placeholder for a math problem. Let's create a sample problem based on the number 169 and solve it.

### Sample Problem:
**What is the square root of 169?**

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   We need to find the square root of 169. The square root of a number \( x \) is a number \( y \) such that \( y^2 = x \).

2. **Identify Perfect Squares:**
   We know that 169 is a perfect square because it is a common number that appears in multiplication tables. A perfect square is a number that can be expressed as the product of an integer with itself.

3. **Calculate the Square Root:**
   To find the square root of 169, we need to determine which integer, when multiplied by itself, equals 169.

   \[
   \begin{align*}
   1^2 &= 1 \\
   2^2 &= 4 \\
   3^2 &= 9 \\
   4^2 &= 16 \\
   5^2 &= 25 \\
   6^2 &= 36 \\
   7^2 &= 49 \\
   8^2 &= 64 \\
   9^2 &= 81 \\
   10^2 &= 100 \\
   11^2 &= 121 \\
   12^2 &= 144 \\
   13^2 &= 169 \\
   \end{align*}
   \]

   From the calculations above, we see that \( 13^2 = 169 \).

4. **Verify the Calculation:**
   To ensure our calculation is correct, we can multiply 13 by itself:

   \[
   13 \times 13 = 169
   \]

   This confirms that our calculation is correct.

5. **Conclusion:**
   The square root of 169 is 13.

### Final Answer:
The square root of 169 is 13.
