Question ID: superglue_87
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 87" entails. Since the problem statement is not explicitly given, let's assume a generic approach to tackle a reasoning-based math problem. 

Typically, reasoning questions involve logical deduction, pattern recognition, or mathematical operations. Without specific details, I'll demonstrate a general approach using a hypothetical reasoning problem:

**Hypothetical Problem:**
"Find the next number in the sequence: 2, 4, 8, 16, ..."

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Identify the Pattern:**
   - Look at the sequence: 2, 4, 8, 16.
   - Notice that each number is double the previous number.

2. **Formulate the Rule:**
   - The sequence appears to follow the rule: \( a_n = 2 \times a_{n-1} \).
   - This is a geometric sequence where each term is multiplied by 2.

3. **Apply the Rule:**
   - The last number given is 16.
   - According to the rule, the next number is \( 16 \times 2 = 32 \).

4. **Verify the Pattern:**
   - Check the sequence: 
     - Start with 2: \( 2 \times 2 = 4 \)
     - Then: \( 4 \times 2 = 8 \)
     - Then: \( 8 \times 2 = 16 \)
     - Finally: \( 16 \times 2 = 32 \)
   - The pattern holds consistently.

5. **Conclude the Solution:**
   - The next number in the sequence is 32.

**Final Answer:**
The next number in the sequence is 32.

This approach demonstrates the logical steps and calculations necessary to solve a typical reasoning problem involving sequences. If "Sample reasoning question 87" refers to a different type of problem, please provide additional details for a more specific solution.
