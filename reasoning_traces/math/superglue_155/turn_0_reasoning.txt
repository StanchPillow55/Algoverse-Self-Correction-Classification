==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 155" refers to. Since this is not a standard math problem or a commonly recognized question, I'll assume it's a placeholder for a specific math problem that you want to solve. Without the actual content of "Sample reasoning question 155," I'll demonstrate how to approach a generic math problem step by step.

Let's assume a sample math problem: 

**Problem:** Solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).

**Step 1: Understand the Problem**

We need to find the value of \( x \) that satisfies the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).

**Step 2: Isolate the Variable**

To solve for \( x \), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We can do this by performing inverse operations.

1. Subtract 3 from both sides of the equation to get rid of the constant term on the left side:

   \[
   2x + 3 - 3 = 11 - 3
   \]

   Simplifying both sides gives:

   \[
   2x = 8
   \]

2. Now, divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( x \):

   \[
   \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{8}{2}
   \]

   Simplifying both sides gives:

   \[
   x = 4
   \]

**Step 3: Verify the Solution**

Substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies the equation:

\[
2(4) + 3 = 11
\]

Calculating the left side:

\[
8 + 3 = 11
\]

Since both sides of the equation are equal, our solution \( x = 4 \) is correct.

**Step 4: State the Final Answer**

The solution to the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \) is \( x = 4 \).

If you have a specific problem labeled as "Sample reasoning question 155," please provide the details, and I can work through that specific problem for you.
