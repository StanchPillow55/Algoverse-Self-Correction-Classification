==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 155" refers to. Since the problem statement is not specific, I'll assume this is a placeholder for a typical math reasoning problem. Let's create a hypothetical problem and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**

A company sells two types of products: Product A and Product B. The company sells Product A for $50 each and Product B for $30 each. Last month, the company sold a total of 200 products and made $7,000 in revenue. How many of each product did the company sell?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( x \) be the number of Product A sold.
   - Let \( y \) be the number of Product B sold.

2. **Set Up Equations:**
   - We know the total number of products sold is 200. Therefore, the first equation is:
     \[
     x + y = 200
     \]
   - We also know the total revenue is $7,000. The revenue from Product A is \( 50x \) and from Product B is \( 30y \). Therefore, the second equation is:
     \[
     50x + 30y = 7000
     \]

3. **Solve the System of Equations:**
   - We have the system of equations:
     \[
     \begin{align*}
     x + y &= 200 \quad \text{(Equation 1)} \\
     50x + 30y &= 7000 \quad \text{(Equation 2)}
     \end{align*}
     \]
   - From Equation 1, express \( y \) in terms of \( x \):
     \[
     y = 200 - x
     \]
   - Substitute \( y = 200 - x \) into Equation 2:
     \[
     50x + 30(200 - x) = 7000
     \]
   - Simplify and solve for \( x \):
     \[
     50x + 6000 - 30x = 7000
     \]
     \[
     20x + 6000 = 7000
     \]
     \[
     20x = 1000
     \]
     \[
     x = 50
     \]
   - Substitute \( x = 50 \) back into the expression for \( y \):
     \[
     y = 200 - 50 = 150
     \]

4. **Verify the Solution:**
   - Check the total number of products:
     \[
     x + y = 50 + 150 = 200
     \]
   - Check the total revenue:
     \[
     50(50) + 30(150) = 2500 + 4500 = 7000
     \]

Both conditions are satisfied, confirming our solution is correct.

**Final Answer:**

The company sold 50 units of Product A and 150 units of Product B.
