==================================================

To solve the problem effectively, let's first understand what "Sample reasoning question 155" might entail. Since the problem statement is not explicitly provided, I'll create a hypothetical math problem and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**

A company produces two types of widgets: Type A and Type B. The company sells Type A widgets for $50 each and Type B widgets for $70 each. In one month, the company sold a total of 500 widgets and made $30,000 in revenue. How many of each type of widget did the company sell?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( x \) be the number of Type A widgets sold.
   - Let \( y \) be the number of Type B widgets sold.

2. **Set Up Equations:**
   - From the problem, we have two key pieces of information:
     1. The total number of widgets sold is 500.
     2. The total revenue from selling these widgets is $30,000.

   - This gives us the following system of equations:
     \[
     x + y = 500
     \]
     \[
     50x + 70y = 30,000
     \]

3. **Solve the System of Equations:**

   - **Equation 1:** \( x + y = 500 \)
   - **Equation 2:** \( 50x + 70y = 30,000 \)

   - From Equation 1, express \( y \) in terms of \( x \):
     \[
     y = 500 - x
     \]

   - Substitute \( y = 500 - x \) into Equation 2:
     \[
     50x + 70(500 - x) = 30,000
     \]

   - Simplify and solve for \( x \):
     \[
     50x + 35,000 - 70x = 30,000
     \]
     \[
     -20x + 35,000 = 30,000
     \]
     \[
     -20x = 30,000 - 35,000
     \]
     \[
     -20x = -5,000
     \]
     \[
     x = \frac{-5,000}{-20} = 250
     \]

   - Substitute \( x = 250 \) back into the expression for \( y \):
     \[
     y = 500 - 250 = 250
     \]

4. **Verify the Solution:**

   - Check that the total number of widgets is correct:
     \[
     x + y = 250 + 250 = 500
     \]

   - Check that the total revenue is correct:
     \[
     50x + 70y = 50(250) + 70(250) = 12,500 + 17,500 = 30,000
     \]

   Both conditions are satisfied, confirming our solution is correct.

**Final Answer:**

The company sold 250 Type A widgets and 250 Type B widgets.
