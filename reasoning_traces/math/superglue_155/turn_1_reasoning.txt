==================================================

To solve a math problem effectively, it's important to follow a structured approach. However, the problem statement you've provided, "Sample reasoning question 155," does not contain any specific mathematical content or context to work through. Therefore, I will guide you through a general approach to solving a math problem, assuming a hypothetical problem for demonstration purposes.

Let's assume a sample math problem:

**Problem:** Solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We are given a linear equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).
   - Our goal is to find the value of \( x \) that makes this equation true.

2. **Isolate the Variable:**
   - To solve for \( x \), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation.
   - Start by eliminating the constant term on the left side. We do this by subtracting 3 from both sides of the equation:
     \[
     2x + 3 - 3 = 11 - 3
     \]
   - Simplifying both sides gives:
     \[
     2x = 8
     \]

3. **Solve for \( x \):**
   - Now, we need to isolate \( x \) by getting rid of the coefficient 2. We do this by dividing both sides of the equation by 2:
     \[
     \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{8}{2}
     \]
   - Simplifying both sides gives:
     \[
     x = 4
     \]

4. **Verify the Solution:**
   - Substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies the equation:
     \[
     2(4) + 3 = 11
     \]
   - Simplifying the left side gives:
     \[
     8 + 3 = 11
     \]
   - Since both sides of the equation are equal, \( x = 4 \) is indeed the correct solution.

5. **State the Final Answer:**
   - The solution to the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \) is \( x = 4 \).

This structured approach can be applied to various types of math problems, ensuring clarity and accuracy in finding the solution. If you have a specific problem or context in mind, please provide more details, and I will be happy to assist you further.
