Question ID: superglue_155
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we first need to understand what "Sample reasoning question 155" entails. Since the problem statement is not provided, I'll demonstrate a general approach to solving a reasoning-based math problem by creating a hypothetical example. Let's assume "Sample reasoning question 155" involves a typical math reasoning problem such as determining the next number in a sequence.

**Hypothetical Problem:**
Determine the next number in the sequence: 2, 4, 8, 16, ...

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Identify the Pattern:**
   - Look at the sequence: 2, 4, 8, 16, ...
   - Notice that each number is double the previous number.

2. **Verify the Pattern:**
   - Start with the first number: 2
   - Multiply by 2 to get the second number: \(2 \times 2 = 4\)
   - Multiply by 2 again to get the third number: \(4 \times 2 = 8\)
   - Multiply by 2 once more to get the fourth number: \(8 \times 2 = 16\)

3. **Apply the Pattern to Find the Next Number:**
   - Continue the pattern by multiplying the last number in the sequence by 2.
   - \(16 \times 2 = 32\)

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The pattern is consistent throughout the sequence, confirming that each number is obtained by multiplying the previous number by 2.
   - Therefore, the next number in the sequence is 32.

**Final Answer:**
The next number in the sequence is 32.

This example illustrates a systematic approach to solving a reasoning problem involving numerical sequences. If "Sample reasoning question 155" refers to a different type of problem, please provide additional details for a more specific solution.
