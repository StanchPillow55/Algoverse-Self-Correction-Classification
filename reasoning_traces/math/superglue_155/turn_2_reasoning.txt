==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 155" refers to. However, since no specific details or context are provided about this question, I'll demonstrate a general approach to solving a typical math problem by creating a hypothetical example.

Let's assume "Sample reasoning question 155" is a math problem involving algebra. Here's a hypothetical problem and its solution:

**Problem:**
Solve for \( x \) in the equation: \( 3x + 5 = 20 \).

**Solution:**

1. **Understand the Equation:**
   The equation given is \( 3x + 5 = 20 \). Our goal is to solve for \( x \).

2. **Isolate the Variable:**
   To solve for \( x \), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We start by eliminating the constant term on the left side.

   \[
   3x + 5 = 20
   \]

   Subtract 5 from both sides to remove the constant:

   \[
   3x + 5 - 5 = 20 - 5
   \]

   Simplifying both sides gives:

   \[
   3x = 15
   \]

3. **Solve for \( x \):**
   Now, we need to solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides by the coefficient of \( x \), which is 3.

   \[
   \frac{3x}{3} = \frac{15}{3}
   \]

   Simplifying both sides gives:

   \[
   x = 5
   \]

4. **Verify the Solution:**
   To ensure our solution is correct, we substitute \( x = 5 \) back into the original equation:

   \[
   3(5) + 5 = 20
   \]

   Simplifying the left side:

   \[
   15 + 5 = 20
   \]

   \[
   20 = 20
   \]

   The left side equals the right side, confirming that our solution is correct.

**Final Answer:**
The solution to the equation \( 3x + 5 = 20 \) is \( x = 5 \).

This approach demonstrates a step-by-step method to solve a basic algebraic equation. If "Sample reasoning question 155" refers to a different type of problem, please provide more details or context so I can assist you accordingly.
