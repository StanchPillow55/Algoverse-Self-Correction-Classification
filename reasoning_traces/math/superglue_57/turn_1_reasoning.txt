==================================================

To solve the problem effectively, I would need the specific details of "Sample reasoning question 57." Since the details of the question are not provided, I'll guide you through a general approach to solving a typical math reasoning problem.

### General Approach to Solving Math Reasoning Problems

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - Carefully read the problem statement.
   - Identify what is being asked.
   - Note any given information or constraints.

2. **Devise a Plan:**
   - Think about the mathematical concepts that might apply (e.g., algebra, geometry, probability).
   - Consider similar problems you have solved before.
   - Decide on a strategy to tackle the problem (e.g., drawing a diagram, creating an equation).

3. **Carry Out the Plan:**
   - Execute your strategy step by step.
   - Perform calculations carefully.
   - Keep track of units and ensure consistency.

4. **Check Your Work:**
   - Review each step to ensure accuracy.
   - Verify that your solution makes sense in the context of the problem.
   - Consider alternative methods to confirm your answer.

5. **State the Final Answer:**
   - Clearly present your solution.
   - Include units if applicable.

### Example Problem

**Problem:** A rectangle has a length that is twice its width. If the perimeter of the rectangle is 36 units, what are the dimensions of the rectangle?

#### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We have a rectangle with a length \( l \) and width \( w \).
   - The length is twice the width: \( l = 2w \).
   - The perimeter \( P \) is 36 units.

2. **Devise a Plan:**
   - Use the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle: \( P = 2l + 2w \).
   - Substitute \( l = 2w \) into the perimeter formula.

3. **Carry Out the Plan:**
   - Substitute \( l = 2w \) into the perimeter formula:
     \[
     36 = 2(2w) + 2w
     \]
   - Simplify the equation:
     \[
     36 = 4w + 2w
     \]
     \[
     36 = 6w
     \]
   - Solve for \( w \):
     \[
     w = \frac{36}{6} = 6
     \]
   - Find \( l \) using \( l = 2w \):
     \[
     l = 2 \times 6 = 12
     \]

4. **Check Your Work:**
   - Verify the perimeter with the found dimensions:
     \[
     P = 2l + 2w = 2(12) + 2(6) = 24 + 12 = 36
     \]
   - The calculations are consistent with the given perimeter.

5. **State the Final Answer:**
   - The dimensions of the rectangle are: length = 12 units, width = 6 units.
