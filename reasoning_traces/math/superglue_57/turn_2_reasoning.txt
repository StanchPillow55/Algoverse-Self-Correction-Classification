==================================================

To solve the problem effectively, I need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 57" refers to. Since I don't have access to external databases or specific problem sets, I'll assume a general approach to solving a mathematical reasoning problem. 

Let's consider a hypothetical math problem that involves reasoning and calculations. I'll create a sample problem and solve it step-by-step.

**Sample Problem:**

A company produces two types of widgets: Type A and Type B. The company sells Type A widgets for $50 each and Type B widgets for $70 each. Last month, the company sold a total of 500 widgets and made $30,000 in revenue. How many of each type of widget did the company sell?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( x \) be the number of Type A widgets sold.
   - Let \( y \) be the number of Type B widgets sold.

2. **Set Up Equations:**
   - The total number of widgets sold is 500. Therefore, we have the equation:
     \[
     x + y = 500
     \]

   - The total revenue from selling the widgets is $30,000. Therefore, we have the equation:
     \[
     50x + 70y = 30,000
     \]

3. **Solve the System of Equations:**

   We have the following system of equations:
   \[
   \begin{align*}
   x + y &= 500 \quad \text{(Equation 1)} \\
   50x + 70y &= 30,000 \quad \text{(Equation 2)}
   \end{align*}
   \]

   - From Equation 1, express \( y \) in terms of \( x \):
     \[
     y = 500 - x
     \]

   - Substitute \( y = 500 - x \) into Equation 2:
     \[
     50x + 70(500 - x) = 30,000
     \]

   - Simplify and solve for \( x \):
     \[
     50x + 35,000 - 70x = 30,000
     \]
     \[
     -20x + 35,000 = 30,000
     \]
     \[
     -20x = 30,000 - 35,000
     \]
     \[
     -20x = -5,000
     \]
     \[
     x = \frac{-5,000}{-20} = 250
     \]

   - Substitute \( x = 250 \) back into the expression for \( y \):
     \[
     y = 500 - 250 = 250
     \]

4. **Verify the Solution:**

   - Check the total number of widgets:
     \[
     x + y = 250 + 250 = 500
     \]
     This satisfies Equation 1.

   - Check the total revenue:
     \[
     50(250) + 70(250) = 12,500 + 17,500 = 30,000
     \]
     This satisfies Equation 2.

5. **Conclusion:**

   The company sold 250 Type A widgets and 250 Type B widgets.

**Final Answer:**
The company sold 250 Type A widgets and 250 Type B widgets.
