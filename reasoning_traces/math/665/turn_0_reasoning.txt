Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of history teachers.**
2. **Determine the number of math teachers.**
3. **Calculate the total sleeping time for math teachers.**

### Step 1: Calculate the number of history teachers

We know that 60% of the 150 teachers are history teachers. To find the number of history teachers, we can use the formula:

\[
\text{Number of history teachers} = \text{Total teachers} \times \text{Percentage of history teachers}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\text{Number of history teachers} = 150 \times 0.60 = 90
\]

### Step 2: Determine the number of math teachers

To find the number of math teachers, we subtract the number of history teachers from the total number of teachers:

\[
\text{Number of math teachers} = \text{Total teachers} - \text{Number of history teachers}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\text{Number of math teachers} = 150 - 90 = 60
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the total sleeping time for math teachers

Each math teacher sleeps for 6 hours a day. To find the total sleeping time for all math teachers, we multiply the number of math teachers by the number of hours each sleeps:

\[
\text{Total sleeping time} = \text{Number of math teachers} \times \text{Sleeping hours per teacher}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\text{Total sleeping time} = 60 \times 6 = 360
\]

### Final Answer

The total time the math teachers collectively spend sleeping in one day is:

\[
\boxed{360} \text{ hours}
\]
