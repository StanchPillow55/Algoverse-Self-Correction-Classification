==================================================

To solve the problem, we first need to understand what "Sample math problem 307" refers to. Since no specific details about the problem are provided, I'll create a sample math problem labeled as "307" and solve it step by step.

**Sample Math Problem 307:**

Solve for \( x \) in the equation:
\[ 3x + 5 = 2x + 9 \]

**Step-by-step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Equation:**
   The given equation is a linear equation in one variable, \( x \). Our goal is to find the value of \( x \) that satisfies this equation.

2. **Isolate the Variable:**
   To solve for \( x \), we need to get all terms involving \( x \) on one side of the equation and constant terms on the other side. We can start by subtracting \( 2x \) from both sides of the equation to move the \( x \)-terms to one side:

   \[
   3x + 5 - 2x = 2x + 9 - 2x
   \]

   Simplifying both sides gives:

   \[
   x + 5 = 9
   \]

3. **Solve for \( x \):**
   Next, we need to isolate \( x \) by getting rid of the constant term on the left side. We do this by subtracting 5 from both sides of the equation:

   \[
   x + 5 - 5 = 9 - 5
   \]

   Simplifying both sides gives:

   \[
   x = 4
   \]

4. **Verify the Solution:**
   To ensure our solution is correct, we can substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation and check if both sides are equal:

   Original equation:
   \[
   3x + 5 = 2x + 9
   \]

   Substitute \( x = 4 \):
   \[
   3(4) + 5 = 2(4) + 9
   \]

   Calculate both sides:
   \[
   12 + 5 = 8 + 9
   \]
   \[
   17 = 17
   \]

   Since both sides are equal, our solution \( x = 4 \) is verified.

**Final Answer:**

The solution to the equation \( 3x + 5 = 2x + 9 \) is \( x = 4 \).
