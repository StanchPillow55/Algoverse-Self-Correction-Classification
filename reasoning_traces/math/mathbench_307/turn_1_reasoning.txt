==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 307," we need to first understand what the problem is asking. However, the problem statement is incomplete as it only mentions "Sample math problem 307" without any specific details or context. 

To proceed, let's assume a hypothetical math problem and solve it step by step. Let's consider the following problem:

**Problem:** Solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).

**Step 1: Understand the Equation**

The equation given is a simple linear equation in one variable, \( x \). The goal is to isolate \( x \) on one side of the equation to find its value.

**Step 2: Isolate the Variable**

To isolate \( x \), we need to perform operations that will leave \( x \) alone on one side of the equation. We start by eliminating the constant term on the left side of the equation.

- Subtract 3 from both sides of the equation:

  \[
  2x + 3 - 3 = 11 - 3
  \]

  Simplifying both sides gives:

  \[
  2x = 8
  \]

**Step 3: Solve for \( x \)**

Now, we need to solve for \( x \) by getting rid of the coefficient of \( x \), which is 2.

- Divide both sides of the equation by 2:

  \[
  \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{8}{2}
  \]

  Simplifying both sides gives:

  \[
  x = 4
  \]

**Step 4: Verify the Solution**

To ensure that our solution is correct, we substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation and check if both sides are equal.

- Substitute \( x = 4 \) into the original equation:

  \[
  2(4) + 3 = 11
  \]

  Simplifying the left side gives:

  \[
  8 + 3 = 11
  \]

  Since both sides of the equation are equal, our solution is verified.

**Final Answer:**

The solution to the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \) is \( x = 4 \).
