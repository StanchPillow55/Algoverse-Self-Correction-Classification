==================================================

To solve the problem effectively, we need to first understand what "Sample math problem 406" refers to. Since the problem isn't explicitly stated, I'll assume a generic math problem with the number 406 involved. Let's create a problem involving the number 406 and solve it step by step.

**Problem:**
Calculate the sum of the digits of the number 406 and then multiply the result by 3. What is the final result?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Identify the digits of the number 406:**
   - The number 406 consists of three digits: 4, 0, and 6.

2. **Calculate the sum of the digits:**
   - Add the digits together: \(4 + 0 + 6\).

   \[
   4 + 0 + 6 = 10
   \]

3. **Multiply the sum by 3:**
   - Take the sum obtained in the previous step and multiply it by 3.

   \[
   10 \times 3 = 30
   \]

4. **Final Result:**
   - The final result after performing the operations is 30.

**Conclusion:**
The sum of the digits of the number 406 is 10, and when this sum is multiplied by 3, the final result is 30.

**Final Answer:**
30
