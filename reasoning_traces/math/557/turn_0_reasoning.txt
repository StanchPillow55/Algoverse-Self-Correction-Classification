To solve the problem, we need to determine the total number of holes in all the buttons in the bag. We know the following:

1. The total number of buttons in the bag is 21.
2. Out of these, 7 buttons have 2 holes each.
3. The remaining buttons have 4 holes each.

### Step 1: Calculate the number of buttons with 4 holes.

First, we need to find out how many buttons have 4 holes. Since there are 21 buttons in total and 7 of them have 2 holes, we can calculate the number of buttons with 4 holes as follows:

\[
\text{Number of buttons with 4 holes} = \text{Total buttons} - \text{Buttons with 2 holes}
\]
\[
\text{Number of buttons with 4 holes} = 21 - 7 = 14
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the total number of holes from buttons with 2 holes.

Next, we calculate the total number of holes contributed by the buttons that have 2 holes. Since there are 7 buttons with 2 holes, the total number of holes from these buttons is:

\[
\text{Total holes from buttons with 2 holes} = \text{Number of buttons with 2 holes} \times \text{Holes per button}
\]
\[
\text{Total holes from buttons with 2 holes} = 7 \times 2 = 14
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the total number of holes from buttons with 4 holes.

Now, we calculate the total number of holes contributed by the buttons that have 4 holes. Since there are 14 buttons with 4 holes, the total number of holes from these buttons is:

\[
\text{Total holes from buttons with 4 holes} = \text{Number of buttons with 4 holes} \times \text{Holes per button}
\]
\[
\text{Total holes from buttons with 4 holes} = 14 \times 4 = 56
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the total number of holes in all buttons.

Finally, we add the total number of holes from both types of buttons to find the total number of holes in all the buttons in the bag:

\[
\text{Total holes in all buttons} = \text{Total holes from buttons with 2 holes} + \text{Total holes from buttons with 4 holes}
\]
\[
\text{Total holes in all buttons} = 14 + 56 = 70
\]

### Final Answer

The total number of holes in all the buttons in the bag is \( \boxed{70} \).
