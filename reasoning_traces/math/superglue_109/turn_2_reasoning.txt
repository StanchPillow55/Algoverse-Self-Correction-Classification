==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 109" entails. Since the problem statement doesn't provide any specific details or numbers, I'll assume it's a hypothetical or generic math problem. Let's create a sample problem and solve it step by step.

**Sample Problem:**

A company produces two types of products, A and B. The profit from each unit of product A is $5, and the profit from each unit of product B is $8. The company can produce a maximum of 100 units of product A and 80 units of product B per day. However, due to resource constraints, the total production of products A and B combined cannot exceed 150 units per day. How many units of each product should the company produce to maximize profit?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( x \) be the number of units of product A produced per day.
   - Let \( y \) be the number of units of product B produced per day.

2. **Objective Function:**
   - The profit function \( P \) can be defined as:
     \[
     P = 5x + 8y
     \]
   - We want to maximize this profit function.

3. **Constraints:**
   - The production constraints are:
     \[
     x \leq 100 \quad \text{(Product A constraint)}
     \]
     \[
     y \leq 80 \quad \text{(Product B constraint)}
     \]
     \[
     x + y \leq 150 \quad \text{(Total production constraint)}
     \]
   - Additionally, \( x \) and \( y \) must be non-negative:
     \[
     x \geq 0, \quad y \geq 0
     \]

4. **Graphical Solution:**
   - Plot the constraints on a graph with \( x \) on the horizontal axis and \( y \) on the vertical axis.
   - The feasible region is the area where all constraints overlap.

5. **Identify Corner Points:**
   - The corner points of the feasible region are found by solving the system of equations formed by the intersection of the constraints:
     - Intersection of \( x = 100 \) and \( x + y = 150 \): \( (100, 50) \)
     - Intersection of \( y = 80 \) and \( x + y = 150 \): \( (70, 80) \)
     - Intersection of \( x = 0 \) and \( y = 80 \): \( (0, 80) \)
     - Intersection of \( y = 0 \) and \( x = 100 \): \( (100, 0) \)

6. **Evaluate the Objective Function at Each Corner Point:**
   - \( P(100, 50) = 5(100) + 8(50) = 500 + 400 = 900 \)
   - \( P(70, 80) = 5(70) + 8(80) = 350 + 640 = 990 \)
   - \( P(0, 80) = 5(0) + 8(80) = 0 + 640 = 640 \)
   - \( P(100, 0) = 5(100) + 8(0) = 500 + 0 = 500 \)

7. **Determine the Maximum Profit:**
   - The maximum profit occurs at the point \( (70, 80) \) with a profit of $990.

**Final Answer:**
To maximize profit, the company should produce 70 units of product A and 80 units of product B per day, resulting in a maximum profit of $990.
