==================================================

It seems like there might be a misunderstanding or a missing part of the question, as "Sample reasoning question 109" does not provide specific details or numbers to work with. However, I can guide you through a general approach to solving a typical math problem by outlining the steps and reasoning involved.

Let's assume we have a hypothetical math problem to solve. I'll create a sample problem and walk you through the solution process.

**Sample Problem:**

A farmer has a rectangular field that is 100 meters long and 50 meters wide. He wants to build a fence around the entire field and also divide the field into two equal smaller rectangles by adding a fence parallel to the shorter side. How much fencing material does he need in total?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We have a rectangular field with dimensions 100 meters (length) and 50 meters (width).
   - We need to fence the perimeter of the field.
   - Additionally, we need to add a fence parallel to the shorter side (width) to divide the field into two equal parts.

2. **Calculate the Perimeter of the Field:**
   - The formula for the perimeter \( P \) of a rectangle is given by:
     \[
     P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width})
     \]
   - Substituting the given values:
     \[
     P = 2 \times (100 + 50) = 2 \times 150 = 300 \text{ meters}
     \]

3. **Calculate the Additional Fence Needed:**
   - The additional fence is parallel to the width and divides the field into two equal parts.
   - This additional fence will be equal to the length of the field, which is 100 meters.

4. **Total Fencing Required:**
   - Add the perimeter of the field and the additional fence:
     \[
     \text{Total fencing} = \text{Perimeter} + \text{Additional fence}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total fencing} = 300 + 100 = 400 \text{ meters}
     \]

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The farmer needs a total of 400 meters of fencing material.

**Final Answer:**
The farmer needs 400 meters of fencing material in total.
