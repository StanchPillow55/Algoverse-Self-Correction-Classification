To determine how much money the class was able to raise from the profit of selling lollipops, we will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of lollipops sold by the class.**
   - Each student sold an average of 10 lollipops.
   - There are 30 students in the class.
   - Therefore, the total number of lollipops sold is:
     \[
     \text{Total lollipops sold} = \text{Number of students} \times \text{Average lollipops sold per student}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total lollipops sold} = 30 \times 10 = 300
     \]

2. **Calculate the total revenue from selling the lollipops.**
   - Each lollipop was sold for $0.8.
   - Thus, the total revenue from selling 300 lollipops is:
     \[
     \text{Total revenue} = \text{Total lollipops sold} \times \text{Selling price per lollipop}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total revenue} = 300 \times 0.8 = 240
     \]

3. **Calculate the total cost of purchasing the lollipops.**
   - Each lollipop was bought for $0.5.
   - Therefore, the total cost for 300 lollipops is:
     \[
     \text{Total cost} = \text{Total lollipops sold} \times \text{Cost price per lollipop}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total cost} = 300 \times 0.5 = 150
     \]

4. **Calculate the total profit made from selling the lollipops.**
   - Profit is calculated as total revenue minus total cost:
     \[
     \text{Profit} = \text{Total revenue} - \text{Total cost}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Profit} = 240 - 150 = 90
     \]

Thus, the class was able to raise **$90** from the profit of selling lollipops.

Final answer: **$90**
