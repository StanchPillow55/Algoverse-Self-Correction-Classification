Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, I need to first understand what "Sample math problem 107" refers to. Since I don't have access to external databases or specific problem sets, I'll create a hypothetical math problem that could be labeled as "Sample math problem 107" and solve it step by step. 

Let's assume "Sample math problem 107" is the following:

**Problem:**
Solve for \( x \) in the equation:
\[ 3x + 5 = 2x + 9 \]

**Solution:**

Step 1: Isolate the variable \( x \).
- To do this, we need to get all terms containing \( x \) on one side of the equation and constant terms on the other side.

Step 2: Subtract \( 2x \) from both sides of the equation to move the \( x \) terms to one side:
\[ 3x + 5 - 2x = 2x + 9 - 2x \]

This simplifies to:
\[ x + 5 = 9 \]

Step 3: Subtract 5 from both sides to isolate \( x \):
\[ x + 5 - 5 = 9 - 5 \]

This simplifies to:
\[ x = 4 \]

Step 4: Verify the solution by substituting \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation to ensure both sides are equal:
- Original equation: \( 3x + 5 = 2x + 9 \)
- Substitute \( x = 4 \):
  \[ 3(4) + 5 = 2(4) + 9 \]
  \[ 12 + 5 = 8 + 9 \]
  \[ 17 = 17 \]

Since both sides of the equation are equal, the solution \( x = 4 \) is verified.

**Final Answer:**
\[ x = 4 \]
