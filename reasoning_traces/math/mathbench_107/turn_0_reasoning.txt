==================================================

To solve the problem, I need more specific information about "Sample math problem 107" as it is not a standard or universally recognized problem. However, I can guide you through a general approach to solving math problems by providing a hypothetical example. Let's assume "Sample math problem 107" is a typical algebra problem:

**Example Problem:**
Solve for \( x \) in the equation: \( 3x + 5 = 20 \).

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We are given a linear equation: \( 3x + 5 = 20 \).
   - Our goal is to solve for \( x \).

2. **Isolate the Variable:**
   - To solve for \( x \), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation.
   - Start by eliminating the constant term on the side with the variable. Here, the constant is \( 5 \).

3. **Subtract 5 from Both Sides:**
   \[
   3x + 5 - 5 = 20 - 5
   \]
   \[
   3x = 15
   \]

4. **Solve for \( x \):**
   - Now, divide both sides by the coefficient of \( x \), which is \( 3 \).
   \[
   \frac{3x}{3} = \frac{15}{3}
   \]
   \[
   x = 5
   \]

5. **Verify the Solution:**
   - Substitute \( x = 5 \) back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies the equation.
   \[
   3(5) + 5 = 20
   \]
   \[
   15 + 5 = 20
   \]
   \[
   20 = 20
   \]
   - The left-hand side equals the right-hand side, confirming that our solution is correct.

**Final Answer:**
The solution to the equation \( 3x + 5 = 20 \) is \( x = 5 \).
