==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to determine how much money Jane has saved so far and how much more she needs to save to reach her goal of $60.

1. **Calculate Jane's total savings so far:**
   - Jane saves $4 each week.
   - She has saved for 8 weeks.
   - Total savings = Savings per week ร Number of weeks
   \[
   \text{Total savings} = 4 \, \text{dollars/week} \times 8 \, \text{weeks} = 32 \, \text{dollars}
   \]

2. **Determine how much more she needs to save to reach $60:**
   - Total amount needed = $60
   - Amount saved so far = $32
   - Amount still needed = Total amount needed - Amount saved
   \[
   \text{Amount still needed} = 60 \, \text{dollars} - 32 \, \text{dollars} = 28 \, \text{dollars}
   \]

3. **Calculate how many more weeks it will take to save the remaining amount:**
   - Jane continues to save $4 each week.
   - Number of additional weeks needed = Amount still needed รท Savings per week
   \[
   \text{Number of additional weeks} = \frac{28 \, \text{dollars}}{4 \, \text{dollars/week}} = 7 \, \text{weeks}
   \]

Thus, it will take Jane **7 more weeks** to save a total of $60.

**Final Answer: 7 weeks**
