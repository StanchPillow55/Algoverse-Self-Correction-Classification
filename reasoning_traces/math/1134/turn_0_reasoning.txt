To solve the problem, we need to determine how much money Jane has saved so far and how much more she needs to save to reach her goal of $60.

**Step 1: Calculate the total amount Jane has saved so far.**

Jane saves $4 each week. She has been saving for 8 weeks.

\[
\text{Total saved so far} = \text{Amount saved per week} \times \text{Number of weeks}
\]
\[
\text{Total saved so far} = 4 \, \text{dollars/week} \times 8 \, \text{weeks} = 32 \, \text{dollars}
\]

**Step 2: Determine how much more money Jane needs to save to reach $60.**

Next, we subtract the amount she has already saved from her goal of $60.

\[
\text{Amount needed to reach goal} = \text{Goal} - \text{Total saved so far}
\]
\[
\text{Amount needed to reach goal} = 60 \, \text{dollars} - 32 \, \text{dollars} = 28 \, \text{dollars}
\]

**Step 3: Calculate how many more weeks it will take for Jane to save the remaining amount.**

Since Jane saves $4 each week, we can find out how many more weeks she needs to save to reach the remaining amount of $28.

\[
\text{Number of additional weeks} = \frac{\text{Amount needed to reach goal}}{\text{Amount saved per week}}
\]
\[
\text{Number of additional weeks} = \frac{28 \, \text{dollars}}{4 \, \text{dollars/week}} = 7 \, \text{weeks}
\]

**Final Answer:**

It will take Jane **7 more weeks** to save enough money to reach her goal of $60.
