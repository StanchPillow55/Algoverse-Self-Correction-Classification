==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to determine how much weight the last two people lost, given the total weight lost by four people and the specific amounts lost by the first two people.

1. **Identify the weight lost by the first person**:
   - The first person lost 27 kilograms.

2. **Determine the weight lost by the second person**:
   - The second person lost 7 kilograms less than the first person. Therefore, we can calculate the weight lost by the second person as follows:
   \[
   \text{Weight lost by second person} = 27 \text{ kg} - 7 \text{ kg} = 20 \text{ kg}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total weight lost by the first two people**:
   - Now, we add the weight lost by the first and second persons:
   \[
   \text{Total weight lost by first two people} = 27 \text{ kg} + 20 \text{ kg} = 47 \text{ kg}
   \]

4. **Determine the total weight lost by the last two people**:
   - The total weight lost by all four people is 103 kilograms. Therefore, the weight lost by the last two people can be calculated by subtracting the total weight lost by the first two people from the overall total:
   \[
   \text{Total weight lost by last two people} = 103 \text{ kg} - 47 \text{ kg} = 56 \text{ kg}
   \]

5. **Calculate the weight lost by each of the last two people**:
   - Since the last two people lost the same amount of weight, we can denote the weight lost by each of them as \( x \). Therefore, we can set up the equation:
   \[
   2x = 56 \text{ kg}
   \]
   - To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 2:
   \[
   x = \frac{56 \text{ kg}}{2} = 28 \text{ kg}
   \]

6. **Final answer**:
   - Each of the last two people lost 28 kilograms.

Thus, the final answer is:
- The last two people each lost **28 kilograms**.
