Question ID: 74
Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

Let's break down the problem:

1. The first person lost 27 kilograms.
2. The second person lost 7 kilograms less than the first person, so the second person lost 27 - 7 = 20 kilograms.
3. The total weight lost by the first two people is 27 + 20 = 47 kilograms.
4. The total weight lost by all four people is 103 kilograms, so the last two people together lost 103 - 47 = 56 kilograms.
5. The problem states that the last two people lost the same amount of weight, so each of them lost 56 / 2 = 28 kilograms.

So, each of the last two people lost 28 kilograms.
