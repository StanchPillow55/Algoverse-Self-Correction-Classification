Question ID: 922
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To determine how many shells Martha has collected by her 10th birthday, we can follow these steps:

1. **Identify the age range**: Martha starts collecting shells at age 5 and continues until her 10th birthday. This means she collects shells from age 5 to age 9.

2. **Calculate the number of years**: 
   - From age 5 to age 10 is a span of 5 years (5, 6, 7, 8, 9).
   - However, since she collects shells every month until her 10th birthday, we need to consider the full years from 5 to 9.

3. **Calculate the total number of months**:
   - Each year has 12 months.
   - From age 5 to age 9, there are 5 years.
   - Therefore, the total number of months is:
     \[
     5 \text{ years} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 60 \text{ months}
     \]

4. **Total shells collected**: Since Martha collects 1 shell each month, the total number of shells collected is equal to the total number of months:
   \[
   60 \text{ shells}
   \]

Thus, by her 10th birthday, Martha will have collected a total of **60 shells**.

**Final Answer**: 60 shells.
