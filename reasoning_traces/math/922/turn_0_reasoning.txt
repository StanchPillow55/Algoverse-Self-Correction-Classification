==================================================

To determine how many shells Martha has collected by her 10th birthday, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Identify the age range**: Martha starts collecting shells at the age of 5 and continues until her 10th birthday. Therefore, we need to calculate the total number of years she collects shells.

2. **Calculate the number of years**: 
   - Martha starts at age 5 and collects shells until she turns 10. 
   - The years she collects shells are: 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10.
   - This means she collects shells for a total of 5 years (from age 5 to age 9) and on her 10th birthday, she will have just started collecting for that year.

3. **Convert years to months**: 
   - Each year has 12 months, so we need to calculate the total number of months she collects shells over these 5 years.
   - Total months = 5 years × 12 months/year = 60 months.

4. **Calculate the total number of shells**: 
   - Since Martha collects 1 shell each month, the total number of shells she collects is equal to the total number of months.
   - Total shells = 60 months × 1 shell/month = 60 shells.

5. **Final answer**: 
   - By her 10th birthday, Martha will have collected a total of 60 shells.

Thus, the final answer is:

**Martha will have collected 60 shells by her 10th birthday.**
