Question ID: 922
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To determine how many shells Martha has collected by her 10th birthday, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Identify the time frame**: Martha started collecting shells at age 5 and will continue until her 10th birthday. 

2. **Calculate the total number of years**: 
   - From age 5 to age 10 is a span of 5 years (10 - 5 = 5).

3. **Convert years into months**: 
   - Since Martha collects one shell every month, we need to convert the 5 years into months. 
   - There are 12 months in a year, so:
     \[
     5 \text{ years} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 60 \text{ months}
     \]

4. **Calculate the total number of shells collected**: 
   - Since Martha collects one shell each month, the total number of shells she collects over 60 months is:
     \[
     60 \text{ months} \times 1 \text{ shell/month} = 60 \text{ shells}
     \]

5. **Final answer**: 
   - By her 10th birthday, Martha will have collected a total of 60 shells.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{60}
\]
