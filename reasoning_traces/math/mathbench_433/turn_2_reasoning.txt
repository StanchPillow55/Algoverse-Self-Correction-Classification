Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 433," we need to first understand what the problem is asking. Since the problem is not explicitly stated, I will assume a hypothetical math problem with the number 433 involved. Let's consider a problem that involves basic arithmetic operations with the number 433.

**Hypothetical Problem:**
Calculate the sum of the digits of the number 433, then multiply the result by 2.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Identify the digits of the number 433:**
   - The number 433 consists of three digits: 4, 3, and 3.

2. **Calculate the sum of the digits:**
   - Add the digits together: \(4 + 3 + 3\).

   \[
   4 + 3 + 3 = 10
   \]

3. **Multiply the sum by 2:**
   - Take the sum obtained in the previous step and multiply it by 2.

   \[
   10 \times 2 = 20
   \]

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The final result after performing the operations is 20.

Therefore, the solution to the hypothetical problem involving the number 433 is 20.
