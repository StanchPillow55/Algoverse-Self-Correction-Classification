==================================================

To solve the problem, I need to understand what "Sample math problem 433" refers to. Since I don't have access to external databases or specific problem sets, I'll assume a general math problem with the number 433 involved. Let's create a problem involving 433 and solve it step by step.

**Problem:**
Find the sum of the digits of the number 433 and determine if the sum is a prime number.

**Step 1: Identify the digits of the number 433.**

The number 433 consists of the digits 4, 3, and 3.

**Step 2: Calculate the sum of the digits.**

To find the sum of the digits, we add them together:
\[ 4 + 3 + 3 = 10 \]

**Step 3: Determine if the sum (10) is a prime number.**

A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. Let's check if 10 is a prime number:

- The divisors of 10 are 1, 2, 5, and 10.
- Since 10 has divisors other than 1 and itself, it is not a prime number.

**Conclusion:**

The sum of the digits of the number 433 is 10, and 10 is not a prime number.

**Final Answer:**

The sum of the digits of 433 is 10, and it is not a prime number.
