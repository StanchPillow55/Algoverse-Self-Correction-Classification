==================================================

To solve the problem, we first need to understand what "Sample reasoning question 448" refers to. Since the problem statement is not provided, I'll demonstrate a general approach to solving a typical math problem by creating a hypothetical problem and solving it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**

A company sells two types of products: Product A and Product B. The company sells Product A for $50 each and Product B for $30 each. In one week, the company sold a total of 100 products and made $4,200 in revenue. How many of each product did the company sell?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( x \) be the number of Product A sold.
   - Let \( y \) be the number of Product B sold.

2. **Set Up Equations:**
   - From the problem, we know the total number of products sold is 100. Therefore, we have the equation:
     \[
     x + y = 100
     \]
   - We also know the total revenue is $4,200. The revenue from Product A is \( 50x \) and from Product B is \( 30y \). Therefore, we have the equation:
     \[
     50x + 30y = 4200
     \]

3. **Solve the System of Equations:**
   - We have the system of equations:
     \[
     \begin{align*}
     x + y &= 100 \quad \text{(Equation 1)} \\
     50x + 30y &= 4200 \quad \text{(Equation 2)}
     \end{align*}
     \]

   - Solve Equation 1 for \( y \):
     \[
     y = 100 - x
     \]

   - Substitute \( y = 100 - x \) into Equation 2:
     \[
     50x + 30(100 - x) = 4200
     \]

   - Simplify and solve for \( x \):
     \[
     50x + 3000 - 30x = 4200
     \]
     \[
     20x + 3000 = 4200
     \]
     \[
     20x = 1200
     \]
     \[
     x = 60
     \]

   - Substitute \( x = 60 \) back into Equation 1 to find \( y \):
     \[
     60 + y = 100
     \]
     \[
     y = 40
     \]

4. **Verify the Solution:**
   - Check the total number of products: \( 60 + 40 = 100 \). This matches the given total.
   - Check the total revenue: \( 50(60) + 30(40) = 3000 + 1200 = 4200 \). This matches the given revenue.

**Final Answer:**

The company sold 60 units of Product A and 40 units of Product B.
