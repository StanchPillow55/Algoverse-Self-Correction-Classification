Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, I'll need more information about "Sample math problem 317" as it is not specified in your request. However, I can guide you through a generic approach to solving a math problem by explaining the steps typically involved. 

Let's assume "Sample math problem 317" is a typical algebra problem. Here's how I would approach solving it:

### Step 1: Understand the Problem
First, read the problem carefully to understand what is being asked. Identify the known quantities and the unknowns you need to solve for.

### Step 2: Devise a Plan
Determine the best strategy to solve the problem. This could involve setting up an equation, drawing a diagram, or breaking the problem into smaller parts.

### Step 3: Carry Out the Plan
Execute the steps you have planned. This involves performing calculations, solving equations, or applying mathematical principles.

### Step 4: Review/Check Your Work
Once you have a solution, review each step to ensure there are no errors. Verify that your solution makes sense in the context of the problem.

### Example Problem
Let's assume the problem is: "Solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \)."

#### Step 1: Understand the Problem
We need to find the value of \( x \) that satisfies the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).

#### Step 2: Devise a Plan
To isolate \( x \), we will first eliminate the constant term on the left side by subtracting 3 from both sides of the equation.

#### Step 3: Carry Out the Plan
1. Subtract 3 from both sides:
   \[
   2x + 3 - 3 = 11 - 3
   \]
   \[
   2x = 8
   \]

2. Divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( x \):
   \[
   \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{8}{2}
   \]
   \[
   x = 4
   \]

#### Step 4: Review/Check Your Work
Substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation to verify:
\[
2(4) + 3 = 8 + 3 = 11
\]
The left side equals the right side, confirming that \( x = 4 \) is correct.

### Final Answer
The solution to the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \) is \( x = 4 \).
