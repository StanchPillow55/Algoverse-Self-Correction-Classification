==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 317," we first need to understand what the problem is asking. However, the problem statement "Sample math problem 317" is not specific enough for us to determine the exact question or the mathematical operations involved. Therefore, I'll demonstrate a general approach to solving a typical math problem by creating a hypothetical problem and solving it step-by-step.

Let's assume "Sample math problem 317" involves solving a quadratic equation. Here's a hypothetical problem:

**Problem:** Solve the quadratic equation \(2x^2 - 4x - 6 = 0\).

### Step 1: Identify the form of the quadratic equation
The given equation is in the standard form of a quadratic equation, \(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\), where:
- \(a = 2\)
- \(b = -4\)
- \(c = -6\)

### Step 2: Calculate the discriminant
The discriminant (\(\Delta\)) of a quadratic equation \(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\) is given by:
\[
\Delta = b^2 - 4ac
\]
Substitute the values of \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\):
\[
\Delta = (-4)^2 - 4 \cdot 2 \cdot (-6) = 16 + 48 = 64
\]

### Step 3: Determine the nature of the roots
Since the discriminant \(\Delta = 64\) is positive, the quadratic equation has two distinct real roots.

### Step 4: Use the quadratic formula to find the roots
The quadratic formula is:
\[
x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{\Delta}}{2a}
\]
Substitute the values of \(a\), \(b\), and \(\Delta\):
\[
x = \frac{-(-4) \pm \sqrt{64}}{2 \cdot 2} = \frac{4 \pm 8}{4}
\]

### Step 5: Calculate the roots
Calculate the two possible values for \(x\):
1. \(x_1 = \frac{4 + 8}{4} = \frac{12}{4} = 3\)
2. \(x_2 = \frac{4 - 8}{4} = \frac{-4}{4} = -1\)

### Final Answer
The solutions to the quadratic equation \(2x^2 - 4x - 6 = 0\) are \(x = 3\) and \(x = -1\).

This step-by-step approach demonstrates how to solve a quadratic equation using the quadratic formula. If you have a specific "Sample math problem 317" in mind, please provide the details, and I will be happy to solve it for you.
