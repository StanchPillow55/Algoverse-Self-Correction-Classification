==================================================

To solve the problem effectively, let's first understand what "Sample reasoning question 50" might entail. Since the problem statement is not explicitly given, I'll assume it involves a typical math reasoning problem that requires logical thinking and calculation. Let's construct a hypothetical problem and solve it step-by-step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**

A store sells two types of candies: chocolate and gummy bears. The price of a chocolate is $2, and the price of a gummy bear is $1.50. A customer buys a total of 50 candies and spends $85. How many chocolates and gummy bears did the customer buy?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( x \) be the number of chocolates.
   - Let \( y \) be the number of gummy bears.

2. **Set Up Equations:**
   - The total number of candies is 50: 
     \[
     x + y = 50
     \]
   - The total cost is $85:
     \[
     2x + 1.5y = 85
     \]

3. **Solve the System of Equations:**

   We have the system:
   \[
   \begin{align*}
   x + y &= 50 \quad \text{(Equation 1)} \\
   2x + 1.5y &= 85 \quad \text{(Equation 2)}
   \end{align*}
   \]

   **Substitution Method:**

   From Equation 1, express \( y \) in terms of \( x \):
   \[
   y = 50 - x
   \]

   Substitute \( y = 50 - x \) into Equation 2:
   \[
   2x + 1.5(50 - x) = 85
   \]

   Simplify and solve for \( x \):
   \[
   2x + 75 - 1.5x = 85
   \]
   \[
   0.5x + 75 = 85
   \]
   \[
   0.5x = 10
   \]
   \[
   x = 20
   \]

   Substitute \( x = 20 \) back into the expression for \( y \):
   \[
   y = 50 - 20 = 30
   \]

4. **Verify the Solution:**

   Check the total number of candies:
   \[
   x + y = 20 + 30 = 50
   \]

   Check the total cost:
   \[
   2x + 1.5y = 2(20) + 1.5(30) = 40 + 45 = 85
   \]

   Both conditions are satisfied.

**Final Answer:**

The customer bought 20 chocolates and 30 gummy bears.
