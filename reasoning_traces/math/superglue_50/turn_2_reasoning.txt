==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 50" refers to. However, since the problem statement is not clear or complete, I'll approach this as a generic reasoning problem that involves logical thinking and mathematical calculations.

Let's assume "Sample reasoning question 50" is a placeholder for a typical math problem. I'll create a hypothetical problem and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**

A company produces 50 units of a product every day. Each unit costs $20 to produce and is sold for $50. The company has fixed costs of $500 per day. Calculate the daily profit.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Identify the Variables:**
   - Number of units produced per day = 50
   - Cost to produce each unit = $20
   - Selling price per unit = $50
   - Fixed costs per day = $500

2. **Calculate Total Production Cost:**
   - Total production cost per day = Number of units produced × Cost per unit
   - Total production cost = 50 units × $20/unit = $1000

3. **Calculate Total Revenue:**
   - Total revenue per day = Number of units sold × Selling price per unit
   - Total revenue = 50 units × $50/unit = $2500

4. **Calculate Profit:**
   - Profit is calculated as Total Revenue - Total Costs (which includes both variable and fixed costs).
   - Total Costs = Total Production Cost + Fixed Costs
   - Total Costs = $1000 + $500 = $1500
   - Profit = Total Revenue - Total Costs
   - Profit = $2500 - $1500 = $1000

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The daily profit for the company is $1000.

**Final Answer:**
The daily profit is $1000.

This solution demonstrates a structured approach to solving a typical business-related math problem involving production, costs, and profit. If "Sample reasoning question 50" refers to a different type of problem, please provide more details for a specific solution.
