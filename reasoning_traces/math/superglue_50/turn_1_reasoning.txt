==================================================

To solve the problem effectively, let's first clarify the task at hand. The question provided is "Sample reasoning question 50," which is quite vague and lacks specific details. However, I'll assume this is a placeholder for a typical math problem-solving scenario. Since no specific problem is given, I'll create a sample math problem and solve it step by step, demonstrating the reasoning process.

**Sample Problem:**

Let's consider a problem involving basic algebra:

"Find the value of \( x \) in the equation \( 3x + 5 = 20 \)."

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Equation:**
   The equation given is \( 3x + 5 = 20 \). Our goal is to solve for \( x \).

2. **Isolate the Variable:**
   To find the value of \( x \), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We can start by eliminating the constant term on the left side.

   \[
   3x + 5 = 20
   \]

   Subtract 5 from both sides to remove the constant:

   \[
   3x + 5 - 5 = 20 - 5
   \]

   Simplifying both sides gives:

   \[
   3x = 15
   \]

3. **Solve for \( x \):**
   Now, we need to solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides of the equation by 3, which is the coefficient of \( x \).

   \[
   \frac{3x}{3} = \frac{15}{3}
   \]

   Simplifying both sides results in:

   \[
   x = 5
   \]

4. **Verify the Solution:**
   It's always a good practice to verify the solution by substituting the value of \( x \) back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies the equation.

   Substitute \( x = 5 \) into the original equation:

   \[
   3(5) + 5 = 20
   \]

   Calculate the left side:

   \[
   15 + 5 = 20
   \]

   Since both sides of the equation are equal, our solution \( x = 5 \) is verified.

**Final Answer:**

The value of \( x \) is 5.

This solution demonstrates a clear, step-by-step approach to solving a basic algebraic equation, ensuring that each step is logical and justified. If you have a specific problem or a different type of question in mind, please provide more details, and I can tailor the solution accordingly.
