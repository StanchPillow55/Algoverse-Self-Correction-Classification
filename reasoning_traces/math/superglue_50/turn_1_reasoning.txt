==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 50" refers to. Since the problem statement is not specific about the content of "Sample reasoning question 50," I will assume it is a placeholder for a typical math problem. 

Let's assume "Sample reasoning question 50" is a math problem involving basic arithmetic operations. For example, let's say the problem is:

"Calculate the sum of 25 and 75."

Here is how we would solve it step by step:

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We need to find the sum of two numbers: 25 and 75.

2. **Set Up the Calculation:**
   - We will add the two numbers together.

3. **Perform the Calculation:**
   - Add the numbers: 
     \[
     25 + 75
     \]

4. **Calculate Step by Step:**
   - Break down the addition if necessary:
     - Add the tens: \(20 + 70 = 90\)
     - Add the units: \(5 + 5 = 10\)
     - Combine the results: \(90 + 10 = 100\)

5. **Verify the Calculation:**
   - Double-check the addition:
     - Direct addition: \(25 + 75 = 100\)

6. **State the Final Answer:**
   - The sum of 25 and 75 is 100.

Therefore, the final answer to the assumed problem is 100.
