==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to understand what "Sample reasoning question 50" refers to. Since the problem statement is not specific, I'll assume it is a placeholder for a typical math problem. Let's consider a hypothetical problem and solve it step-by-step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**

Calculate the sum of all even numbers between 1 and 50.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Identify the even numbers between 1 and 50:**
   - Even numbers are integers divisible by 2.
   - The even numbers between 1 and 50 are: 2, 4, 6, ..., 48, 50.

2. **Determine the sequence of even numbers:**
   - This sequence is an arithmetic sequence where the first term \( a_1 = 2 \) and the common difference \( d = 2 \).

3. **Find the number of terms in the sequence:**
   - The general formula for the \( n \)-th term of an arithmetic sequence is:
     \[
     a_n = a_1 + (n-1) \cdot d
     \]
   - We need to find \( n \) such that \( a_n = 50 \):
     \[
     50 = 2 + (n-1) \cdot 2
     \]
     \[
     50 = 2 + 2n - 2
     \]
     \[
     50 = 2n
     \]
     \[
     n = 25
     \]
   - There are 25 even numbers between 1 and 50.

4. **Calculate the sum of the sequence:**
   - The sum \( S_n \) of the first \( n \) terms of an arithmetic sequence is given by:
     \[
     S_n = \frac{n}{2} \cdot (a_1 + a_n)
     \]
   - Substitute the known values:
     \[
     S_{25} = \frac{25}{2} \cdot (2 + 50)
     \]
     \[
     S_{25} = \frac{25}{2} \cdot 52
     \]
     \[
     S_{25} = 25 \cdot 26
     \]
     \[
     S_{25} = 650
     \]

**Final Answer:**

The sum of all even numbers between 1 and 50 is 650.
