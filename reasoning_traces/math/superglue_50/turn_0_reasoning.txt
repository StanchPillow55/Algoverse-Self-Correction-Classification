Dataset Type: math
==================================================

It seems like the problem statement is incomplete or unclear. "Sample reasoning question 50" does not provide enough information for me to solve a specific math problem. However, I can guide you through a general approach to solving math problems by using a step-by-step reasoning process. If you have a specific math problem in mind, please provide the details, and I'll be happy to help.

Here's a general approach to solving math problems:

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - Read the problem carefully to understand what is being asked.
   - Identify the knowns (given information) and the unknowns (what you need to find).

2. **Devise a Plan:**
   - Think about the strategies or formulas that might be applicable to solve the problem.
   - Consider drawing a diagram or making a table if it helps visualize the problem.

3. **Carry Out the Plan:**
   - Perform calculations step by step.
   - Keep track of your work and ensure each step logically follows from the previous one.

4. **Check Your Work:**
   - Review each step to ensure there are no errors.
   - Verify that your solution makes sense in the context of the problem.
   - If possible, use a different method to check your answer.

5. **State the Final Answer:**
   - Clearly write down the final answer, ensuring it addresses the question asked.

If you provide a specific math problem, I can apply this approach to solve it and show all the work and reasoning involved.
