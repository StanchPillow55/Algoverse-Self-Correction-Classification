==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to determine the cost of Jillian's handbag based on the information given about the cost of her shoes.

1. **Identify the cost of the shoes**: 
   We know from the problem that Jillian's shoes cost $80.

2. **Set up the equation for the handbag**: 
   The problem states that Jillian's handbag costs $20 less than 3 times the cost of her shoes. We can express this relationship mathematically.

   Let \( S \) represent the cost of the shoes, which we know is:
   \[
   S = 80
   \]

   The cost of the handbag \( H \) can be expressed as:
   \[
   H = 3S - 20
   \]

3. **Substitute the value of \( S \) into the equation**:
   Now we substitute \( S = 80 \) into the equation for \( H \):
   \[
   H = 3(80) - 20
   \]

4. **Calculate \( 3 \times 80 \)**:
   \[
   3 \times 80 = 240
   \]

5. **Subtract 20 from 240**:
   \[
   H = 240 - 20
   \]
   \[
   H = 220
   \]

6. **Conclusion**:
   Therefore, the cost of Jillian's handbag is \( \boxed{220} \).
