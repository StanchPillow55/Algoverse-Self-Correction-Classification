==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine how much Lance earns each workday. We are given the following information:

1. Lance works 35 hours a week.
2. He works these hours equally over 5 workdays.
3. He earns $9 per hour.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

### Step 1: Determine the number of hours Lance works each day.

Since Lance works 35 hours a week and spreads these hours equally over 5 workdays, we can find the number of hours he works each day by dividing the total weekly hours by the number of workdays.

\[
\text{Hours per day} = \frac{\text{Total weekly hours}}{\text{Number of workdays}} = \frac{35 \text{ hours}}{5 \text{ days}} = 7 \text{ hours per day}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate Lance's daily earnings.

Now that we know Lance works 7 hours each day, we can calculate his daily earnings by multiplying the number of hours he works each day by his hourly wage.

\[
\text{Daily earnings} = \text{Hours per day} \times \text{Hourly wage} = 7 \text{ hours/day} \times \$9/\text{hour} = \$63/\text{day}
\]

### Conclusion

Lance makes $63 on each workday. Therefore, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{\$63}
\]
