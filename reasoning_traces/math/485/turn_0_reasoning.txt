==================================================

To determine how much Lance makes on each workday, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate Lance's total weekly earnings**: 
   - Since Lance earns $9 per hour and works 35 hours a week, we can calculate his total weekly earnings by multiplying his hourly wage by the number of hours he works in a week.
   \[
   \text{Total weekly earnings} = \text{Hourly wage} \times \text{Hours worked per week}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total weekly earnings} = 9 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 35 \, \text{hours/week} = 315 \, \text{dollars/week}
   \]

2. **Calculate the number of workdays**: 
   - Lance works 5 days a week.

3. **Calculate Lance's earnings per workday**: 
   - To find out how much he makes each workday, we divide his total weekly earnings by the number of workdays.
   \[
   \text{Earnings per workday} = \frac{\text{Total weekly earnings}}{\text{Number of workdays}}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Earnings per workday} = \frac{315 \, \text{dollars/week}}{5 \, \text{days/week}} = 63 \, \text{dollars/day}
   \]

Thus, Lance makes **$63** on each workday.

Final answer: **$63** per workday.
