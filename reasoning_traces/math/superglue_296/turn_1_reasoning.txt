==================================================

To solve the problem effectively, I need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 296" entails. Since the problem statement is not explicitly provided, I'll assume it's a placeholder for a typical math problem. Let's create a hypothetical math problem and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**

A company produces two types of widgets: Type A and Type B. The cost to produce one Type A widget is $5, and the cost to produce one Type B widget is $8. The company has a budget of $400 for production. Additionally, the company needs to produce at least 30 widgets in total. How many of each type of widget should the company produce to maximize the number of widgets while staying within the budget?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( x \) be the number of Type A widgets produced.
   - Let \( y \) be the number of Type B widgets produced.

2. **Set Up the Constraints:**
   - The total production cost should not exceed $400:
     \[
     5x + 8y \leq 400
     \]
   - The total number of widgets should be at least 30:
     \[
     x + y \geq 30
     \]
   - Both \( x \) and \( y \) must be non-negative:
     \[
     x \geq 0, \quad y \geq 0
     \]

3. **Objective:**
   - Maximize the total number of widgets, \( x + y \).

4. **Graphical Solution Approach:**
   - First, graph the inequality \( 5x + 8y \leq 400 \).
   - Find the intercepts:
     - If \( x = 0 \), then \( 8y = 400 \) implies \( y = 50 \).
     - If \( y = 0 \), then \( 5x = 400 \) implies \( x = 80 \).
   - Plot the line \( 5x + 8y = 400 \) with intercepts (0, 50) and (80, 0).

5. **Graph the inequality \( x + y \geq 30 \):**
   - Find the intercepts:
     - If \( x = 0 \), then \( y = 30 \).
     - If \( y = 0 \), then \( x = 30 \).
   - Plot the line \( x + y = 30 \) with intercepts (0, 30) and (30, 0).

6. **Identify the Feasible Region:**
   - The feasible region is bounded by the lines \( 5x + 8y = 400 \), \( x + y = 30 \), and the axes \( x = 0 \) and \( y = 0 \).

7. **Find the Corner Points:**
   - Intersection of \( 5x + 8y = 400 \) and \( x + y = 30 \):
     \[
     5x + 8(30 - x) = 400 \\
     5x + 240 - 8x = 400 \\
     -3x = 160 \\
     x = -\frac{160}{3} \quad (\text{not feasible since } x \geq 0)
     \]
   - Intersection of \( 5x + 8y = 400 \) and \( y = 0 \):
     - \( x = 80 \), \( y = 0 \).
   - Intersection of \( x + y = 30 \) and \( y = 0 \):
     - \( x = 30 \), \( y = 0 \).
   - Intersection of \( x = 0 \) and \( x + y = 30 \):
     - \( x = 0 \), \( y = 30 \).

8. **Evaluate the Objective Function at Each Corner Point:**
   - At (80, 0): \( x + y = 80 \)
   - At (30, 0): \( x + y = 30 \)
   - At (0, 30): \( x + y = 30 \)

9. **Conclusion:**
   - The maximum number of widgets is 80, achieved by producing 80 Type A widgets and 0 Type B widgets.

**Final Answer:**
The company should produce 80 Type A widgets and 0 Type B widgets to maximize the number of widgets while staying within the budget.
