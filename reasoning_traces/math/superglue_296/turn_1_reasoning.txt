==================================================

To solve the problem, we first need to understand what "Sample reasoning question 296" refers to. Since the problem statement is not specific, I'll assume that "Sample reasoning question 296" is a placeholder for a typical math problem. Without specific details, I'll create a hypothetical math problem and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**

Let's assume "Sample reasoning question 296" is the following math problem:

**Problem:**  
A rectangle has a length that is 3 times its width. If the perimeter of the rectangle is 48 units, what are the dimensions of the rectangle?

**Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We need to find the dimensions (length and width) of a rectangle.
   - We know the relationship between length and width: Length = 3 Ã— Width.
   - The perimeter of the rectangle is given as 48 units.

2. **Set Up the Equations:**
   - Let \( w \) be the width of the rectangle.
   - Then the length \( l \) is \( 3w \).
   - The formula for the perimeter \( P \) of a rectangle is:
     \[
     P = 2 \times (\text{Length} + \text{Width})
     \]
   - Substitute the known values into the perimeter formula:
     \[
     48 = 2 \times (3w + w)
     \]

3. **Simplify and Solve for \( w \):**
   - Simplify the equation:
     \[
     48 = 2 \times 4w
     \]
     \[
     48 = 8w
     \]
   - Solve for \( w \) by dividing both sides by 8:
     \[
     w = \frac{48}{8} = 6
     \]

4. **Find the Length:**
   - Since the length \( l \) is 3 times the width:
     \[
     l = 3 \times 6 = 18
     \]

5. **Verify the Solution:**
   - Check the perimeter with the found dimensions:
     \[
     P = 2 \times (18 + 6) = 2 \times 24 = 48
     \]
   - The calculated perimeter matches the given perimeter, confirming our solution is correct.

**Final Answer:**
The dimensions of the rectangle are:
- Width = 6 units
- Length = 18 units
