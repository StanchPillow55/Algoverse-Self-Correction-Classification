==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 296" refers to. Since the question is not explicitly stated, I'll assume it's a placeholder for a typical math problem. Let's create a sample math problem and solve it step by step.

**Sample Problem:**
A company produces two types of widgets: Type A and Type B. The company can produce a maximum of 100 widgets per day. The profit from selling one Type A widget is $5, and the profit from selling one Type B widget is $7. The company wants to maximize its profit, but it must produce at least 20 Type A widgets and at least 10 Type B widgets each day. How many of each type of widget should the company produce to maximize its profit?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( x \) be the number of Type A widgets produced per day.
   - Let \( y \) be the number of Type B widgets produced per day.

2. **Set Up the Objective Function:**
   - The profit function \( P \) is given by:
     \[
     P = 5x + 7y
     \]
   - We want to maximize \( P \).

3. **Set Up the Constraints:**
   - The total production constraint is:
     \[
     x + y \leq 100
     \]
   - The minimum production constraints are:
     \[
     x \geq 20
     \]
     \[
     y \geq 10
     \]

4. **Graph the Constraints:**
   - Plot the line \( x + y = 100 \).
   - Shade the region below this line, as it represents \( x + y \leq 100 \).
   - Plot the vertical line \( x = 20 \) and shade the region to the right.
   - Plot the horizontal line \( y = 10 \) and shade the region above.

5. **Identify the Feasible Region:**
   - The feasible region is the intersection of all shaded areas, which is a polygon on the graph.

6. **Find the Corner Points:**
   - The corner points of the feasible region are found by solving the system of equations formed by the intersection of the lines:
     - Intersection of \( x = 20 \) and \( y = 10 \): \( (20, 10) \)
     - Intersection of \( x = 20 \) and \( x + y = 100 \): \( (20, 80) \)
     - Intersection of \( y = 10 \) and \( x + y = 100 \): \( (90, 10) \)

7. **Evaluate the Objective Function at Each Corner Point:**
   - \( P(20, 10) = 5(20) + 7(10) = 100 + 70 = 170 \)
   - \( P(20, 80) = 5(20) + 7(80) = 100 + 560 = 660 \)
   - \( P(90, 10) = 5(90) + 7(10) = 450 + 70 = 520 \)

8. **Determine the Maximum Profit:**
   - The maximum profit occurs at the point \( (20, 80) \) with a profit of $660.

**Final Answer:**
To maximize profit, the company should produce 20 Type A widgets and 80 Type B widgets per day, resulting in a maximum profit of $660.
