==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 296" refers to. Since the problem statement is not clear, I'll assume it's a placeholder for a typical math problem. Let's create a hypothetical math problem to solve:

**Problem:**
A rectangle has a length that is twice its width. If the perimeter of the rectangle is 48 units, find the dimensions of the rectangle.

**Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We have a rectangle with a length (L) and a width (W).
   - The length is twice the width: \( L = 2W \).
   - The perimeter of the rectangle is 48 units.

2. **Recall the Formula for Perimeter:**
   - The perimeter (P) of a rectangle is given by the formula:
     \[
     P = 2L + 2W
     \]

3. **Substitute the Known Values:**
   - We know the perimeter is 48 units, so:
     \[
     2L + 2W = 48
     \]

4. **Substitute the Expression for L:**
   - Since \( L = 2W \), substitute this into the perimeter equation:
     \[
     2(2W) + 2W = 48
     \]

5. **Simplify the Equation:**
   - Simplify the left side of the equation:
     \[
     4W + 2W = 48
     \]
   - Combine like terms:
     \[
     6W = 48
     \]

6. **Solve for W:**
   - Divide both sides by 6 to solve for W:
     \[
     W = \frac{48}{6} = 8
     \]

7. **Find the Length L:**
   - Since \( L = 2W \), substitute \( W = 8 \) into the equation for L:
     \[
     L = 2 \times 8 = 16
     \]

8. **Verify the Solution:**
   - Check that the dimensions satisfy the original perimeter condition:
     \[
     2L + 2W = 2(16) + 2(8) = 32 + 16 = 48
     \]
   - The perimeter is indeed 48, confirming our solution is correct.

**Final Answer:**
The dimensions of the rectangle are a width of 8 units and a length of 16 units.
