Question ID: 372
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To find TJ's average time per kilometer, we need to determine the total time he took to complete the 10K race and then divide that by the total distance of the race.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - TJ ran a 10K race, which means the total distance is 10 kilometers.
   - He ran the first half (5 kilometers) in 20 minutes.
   - He ran the second half (5 kilometers) in 30 minutes.

2. **Calculate the Total Time:**
   - First half time: 20 minutes
   - Second half time: 30 minutes
   - Total time = 20 minutes + 30 minutes = 50 minutes

3. **Calculate the Average Time per Kilometer:**
   - Total distance = 10 kilometers
   - Total time = 50 minutes
   - Average time per kilometer = Total time / Total distance
   - Average time per kilometer = 50 minutes / 10 kilometers

4. **Perform the Division:**
   - 50 minutes รท 10 kilometers = 5 minutes per kilometer

### Conclusion:

TJ's average time per kilometer is 5 minutes. 

Therefore, the final answer is:
**5 minutes per kilometer.**
