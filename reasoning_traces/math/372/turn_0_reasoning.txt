==================================================

To find out how many hours Hallie had dance practice in a week, we will break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate Tuesday's Practice Hours**:
   - Hallie practices for 1 hour on Tuesdays.

2. **Calculate Thursday's Practice Hours**:
   - Hallie practices for 2 hours on Thursdays.

3. **Calculate Saturday's Practice Hours**:
   - Hallie's Saturday practice lasts twice as long as her Tuesday practice.
   - Since Tuesday's practice is 1 hour, Saturday's practice is:
     \[
     2 \times 1 \text{ hour} = 2 \text{ hours}
     \]

4. **Total Weekly Practice Hours**:
   - Now, we will add up the hours from each day:
     - Tuesday: 1 hour
     - Thursday: 2 hours
     - Saturday: 2 hours
   - Therefore, the total hours of practice in a week is:
     \[
     1 \text{ hour} + 2 \text{ hours} + 2 \text{ hours} = 5 \text{ hours}
     \]

5. **Final Answer**:
   - Hallie had a total of 5 hours of dance practice in a week.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{5}
\]
