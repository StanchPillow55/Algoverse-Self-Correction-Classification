==================================================

To find TJ's average time per kilometer for the 10K race, we first need to determine the total time he took to complete the race and then divide that by the total distance of the race.

### Step 1: Calculate Total Time
TJ ran the first half of the race (5 kilometers) in 20 minutes and the second half (another 5 kilometers) in 30 minutes. 

To find the total time, we add the time for both halves:

\[
\text{Total Time} = \text{Time for first half} + \text{Time for second half}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\text{Total Time} = 20 \text{ minutes} + 30 \text{ minutes} = 50 \text{ minutes}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate Average Time per Kilometer
The total distance of the race is 10 kilometers. To find the average time per kilometer, we divide the total time by the total distance:

\[
\text{Average Time per Kilometer} = \frac{\text{Total Time}}{\text{Total Distance}}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\text{Average Time per Kilometer} = \frac{50 \text{ minutes}}{10 \text{ kilometers}} = 5 \text{ minutes per kilometer}
\]

### Final Answer
TJ's average time per kilometer for the 10K race is:

\[
\boxed{5 \text{ minutes per kilometer}}
\]
