==================================================

To find TJ's average time per kilometer, we need to determine the total time he took to complete the race and then divide that by the total distance he ran.

### Step-by-step Solution:

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - TJ ran a 10K race, which means the total distance is 10 kilometers.
   - He ran the first half (5 kilometers) in 20 minutes.
   - He ran the second half (5 kilometers) in 30 minutes.

2. **Calculate the Total Time:**
   - The total time TJ took to complete the race is the sum of the time for the first half and the time for the second half.
   \[
   \text{Total time} = 20 \text{ minutes} + 30 \text{ minutes} = 50 \text{ minutes}
   \]

3. **Calculate the Average Time per Kilometer:**
   - To find the average time per kilometer, divide the total time by the total distance.
   \[
   \text{Average time per kilometer} = \frac{\text{Total time}}{\text{Total distance}} = \frac{50 \text{ minutes}}{10 \text{ kilometers}}
   \]

4. **Perform the Division:**
   \[
   \frac{50 \text{ minutes}}{10 \text{ kilometers}} = 5 \text{ minutes per kilometer}
   \]

### Final Answer:
TJ's average time per kilometer was 5 minutes per kilometer.
