Question ID: 372
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To find TJ's average time per kilometer, we need to determine the total time he took to complete the race and then divide that by the total distance of the race.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Understand the Race Distance:**
   - A 10K race means the total distance is 10 kilometers.

2. **Determine Total Time Taken:**
   - TJ ran the first half of the race in 20 minutes.
   - He completed the second half in 30 minutes.
   - Therefore, the total time taken for the entire race is:
     \[
     20 \text{ minutes} + 30 \text{ minutes} = 50 \text{ minutes}
     \]

3. **Calculate Average Time per Kilometer:**
   - The average time per kilometer is calculated by dividing the total time by the total distance.
   - Total distance = 10 kilometers.
   - Total time = 50 minutes.
   - Therefore, the average time per kilometer is:
     \[
     \frac{50 \text{ minutes}}{10 \text{ kilometers}} = 5 \text{ minutes per kilometer}
     \]

### Final Answer:
TJ's average time per kilometer was 5 minutes per kilometer.
