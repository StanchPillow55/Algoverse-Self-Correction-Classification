==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to determine how much earlier Bernadette should leave than Wayne in order to arrive at the premiere 5 minutes before him.

1. **Determine Wayne's travel time**:
   - Wayne takes 4 minutes to be driven to the theater.

2. **Determine Bernadette's travel time**:
   - According to the problem, Bernadette's drive takes four times as long as Wayne's drive.
   - Therefore, Bernadette's travel time = 4 * Wayne's travel time = 4 * 4 minutes = 16 minutes.

3. **Determine the time difference needed**:
   - Bernadette wants to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne. 
   - Since Wayne takes 4 minutes to reach the theater, he will arrive at the theater at:
     \[
     \text{Wayne's arrival time} = \text{Departure time} + 4 \text{ minutes}
     \]
   - To arrive 5 minutes before Wayne, Bernadette needs to arrive at:
     \[
     \text{Bernadette's arrival time} = \text{Wayne's arrival time} - 5 \text{ minutes}
     \]

4. **Calculate Bernadette's departure time**:
   - Since Bernadette takes 16 minutes to reach the theater, she needs to leave:
     \[
     \text{Bernadette's departure time} = \text{Bernadette's arrival time} - 16 \text{ minutes}
     \]
   - Substituting the expression for Bernadette's arrival time:
     \[
     \text{Bernadette's departure time} = (\text{Wayne's arrival time} - 5 \text{ minutes}) - 16 \text{ minutes}
     \]
   - Simplifying this gives:
     \[
     \text{Bernadette's departure time} = \text{Wayne's arrival time} - 21 \text{ minutes}
     \]

5. **Determine how much earlier Bernadette should leave than Wayne**:
   - Since Wayne leaves at a certain time and takes 4 minutes to arrive, if he leaves at time \( T \), he arrives at \( T + 4 \).
   - Bernadette needs to leave 21 minutes before Wayne's arrival time:
     \[
     \text{Bernadette's departure time} = T + 4 - 21 = T - 17
     \]
   - Therefore, Bernadette should leave 17 minutes before Wayne.

**Final Answer**: Bernadette should leave 17 minutes earlier than Wayne.
