==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine how much money Timothy spends on t-shirts and bags first, and then calculate how much money he has left to spend on key chains. Finally, we'll determine how many key chains he can buy with the remaining money.

**Step 1: Calculate the cost of the t-shirts.**

Timothy buys 2 t-shirts, and each t-shirt costs $8. Therefore, the total cost for the t-shirts is:
\[ 
2 \text{ t-shirts} \times \$8/\text{t-shirt} = \$16 
\]

**Step 2: Calculate the cost of the bags.**

Timothy buys 2 bags, and each bag costs $10. Therefore, the total cost for the bags is:
\[ 
2 \text{ bags} \times \$10/\text{bag} = \$20 
\]

**Step 3: Calculate the total cost for t-shirts and bags.**

Add the costs of the t-shirts and bags together:
\[ 
\$16 + \$20 = \$36 
\]

**Step 4: Determine how much money Timothy has left.**

Timothy initially has $50. After spending $36 on t-shirts and bags, the remaining amount is:
\[ 
\$50 - \$36 = \$14 
\]

**Step 5: Calculate how many pieces of key chains Timothy can buy.**

Key chains are sold at 3 pieces for $2. First, determine how many sets of 3 key chains Timothy can buy with $14.

Calculate how many sets of 3 key chains he can buy:
\[ 
\frac{\$14}{\$2/\text{set}} = 7 \text{ sets} 
\]

Since each set contains 3 key chains, the total number of key chains Timothy can buy is:
\[ 
7 \text{ sets} \times 3 \text{ key chains/set} = 21 \text{ key chains} 
\]

**Final Answer:**

Timothy can buy 21 pieces of key chains with the amount of money he has left.
