Question ID: 439
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine how much money Timothy spends on t-shirts and bags, and then calculate how many key chains he can buy with the remaining money.

**Step 1: Calculate the cost of the t-shirts.**

Timothy buys 2 t-shirts, and each t-shirt costs $8.

\[
\text{Cost of t-shirts} = 2 \times 8 = 16 \text{ dollars}
\]

**Step 2: Calculate the cost of the bags.**

Timothy buys 2 bags, and each bag costs $10.

\[
\text{Cost of bags} = 2 \times 10 = 20 \text{ dollars}
\]

**Step 3: Calculate the total amount spent on t-shirts and bags.**

\[
\text{Total spent on t-shirts and bags} = 16 + 20 = 36 \text{ dollars}
\]

**Step 4: Calculate the remaining money Timothy has.**

Timothy initially has $50.

\[
\text{Remaining money} = 50 - 36 = 14 \text{ dollars}
\]

**Step 5: Determine how many key chains Timothy can buy.**

Key chains are sold at 3 pieces for $2. First, we calculate how many sets of 3 key chains Timothy can buy with $14.

\[
\text{Number of sets of key chains} = \frac{14}{2} = 7 \text{ sets}
\]

Since each set contains 3 key chains, we calculate the total number of key chains:

\[
\text{Total number of key chains} = 7 \times 3 = 21 \text{ key chains}
\]

Therefore, with the remaining $14, Timothy can buy 21 pieces of key chains.

**Final Answer:**

Timothy can buy 21 pieces of key chains.
