To solve the problem, we need to determine how much earlier Bernadette should leave than Wayne to arrive at the premiere 5 minutes before him.

1. **Determine Wayne's travel time**: 
   - We know from the problem that Wayne takes 4 minutes to get to the theater.

2. **Calculate Bernadette's travel time**: 
   - The problem states that the drive from Bernadette's apartment takes four times as long as the drive from Wayne's hotel.
   - Therefore, Bernadette's travel time is:
     \[
     \text{Bernadette's travel time} = 4 \times \text{Wayne's travel time} = 4 \times 4 \text{ minutes} = 16 \text{ minutes}
     \]

3. **Determine the time Bernadette needs to leave**: 
   - Since Bernadette wants to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne, we need to calculate the time she needs to leave to achieve this.
   - Wayne arrives at the theater in 4 minutes, so he will arrive at:
     \[
     \text{Wayne's arrival time} = 0 \text{ minutes} + 4 \text{ minutes} = 4 \text{ minutes}
     \]
   - To arrive 5 minutes before Wayne, Bernadette needs to arrive at:
     \[
     \text{Bernadette's desired arrival time} = 4 \text{ minutes} - 5 \text{ minutes} = -1 \text{ minutes}
     \]
   - This means Bernadette needs to arrive at the theater by -1 minutes, which is equivalent to 1 minute before the start of the event (or at the 0-minute mark).

4. **Calculate when Bernadette should leave**: 
   - Since Bernadette takes 16 minutes to get to the theater, she needs to leave:
     \[
     \text{Time to leave} = \text{Desired arrival time} - \text{Travel time} = 0 \text{ minutes} - 16 \text{ minutes} = -16 \text{ minutes}
     \]
   - This means she should leave 16 minutes before the event starts.

5. **Determine how much earlier Bernadette should leave than Wayne**: 
   - Wayne leaves at 0 minutes and takes 4 minutes to arrive, so he leaves at:
     \[
     \text{Wayne's departure time} = 0 \text{ minutes} - 4 \text{ minutes} = -4 \text{ minutes}
     \]
   - Bernadette leaves at -16 minutes, so the difference in their departure times is:
     \[
     \text{Difference} = -4 \text{ minutes} - (-16 \text{ minutes}) = -4 + 16 = 12 \text{ minutes}
     \]

Thus, Bernadette should leave **12 minutes earlier** than Wayne to arrive at the theater 5 minutes before him.

**Final Answer**: Bernadette should leave 12 minutes earlier than Wayne.
