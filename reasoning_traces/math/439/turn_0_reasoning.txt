To solve the problem, we will first calculate how much money Timothy spends on the t-shirts and bags, and then determine how much money he has left to spend on key chains.

1. **Calculate the cost of t-shirts:**
   - Timothy buys 2 t-shirts.
   - The cost of each t-shirt is $8.
   - Total cost for t-shirts = Number of t-shirts × Cost per t-shirt
   \[
   \text{Total cost for t-shirts} = 2 \times 8 = 16 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Calculate the cost of bags:**
   - Timothy buys 2 bags.
   - The cost of each bag is $10.
   - Total cost for bags = Number of bags × Cost per bag
   \[
   \text{Total cost for bags} = 2 \times 10 = 20 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total amount spent:**
   - Total amount spent = Total cost for t-shirts + Total cost for bags
   \[
   \text{Total amount spent} = 16 + 20 = 36 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Calculate the amount of money left:**
   - Timothy started with $50.
   - Amount left = Initial amount - Total amount spent
   \[
   \text{Amount left} = 50 - 36 = 14 \text{ dollars}
   \]

5. **Calculate how many key chains Timothy can buy:**
   - Key chains are sold at 3 pieces for $2.
   - First, we need to find the cost per key chain.
   - Cost per key chain = Total cost for 3 key chains / Number of key chains
   \[
   \text{Cost per key chain} = \frac{2}{3} \text{ dollars}
   \]

   Now, we will determine how many key chains Timothy can buy with the $14 he has left.
   - Number of key chains Timothy can buy = Amount left / Cost per key chain
   \[
   \text{Number of key chains} = \frac{14}{\frac{2}{3}} = 14 \times \frac{3}{2} = 21
   \]

Thus, Timothy can buy **21 pieces of key chains** with the amount of money he has left.

**Final Answer: 21 key chains**
