To solve this problem, we need to determine how much money Timothy spends on t-shirts and bags, and then calculate how many key chains he can buy with the remaining money.

### Step 1: Calculate the cost of t-shirts
Timothy buys 2 t-shirts, and each t-shirt costs $8.

\[
\text{Cost of t-shirts} = 2 \times 8 = 16 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the cost of bags
Timothy buys 2 bags, and each bag costs $10.

\[
\text{Cost of bags} = 2 \times 10 = 20 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the total cost of t-shirts and bags
Add the cost of the t-shirts and the bags to find the total amount spent on these items.

\[
\text{Total cost of t-shirts and bags} = 16 + 20 = 36 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the remaining money
Timothy initially has $50. Subtract the total cost of the t-shirts and bags from this amount to find out how much money he has left.

\[
\text{Remaining money} = 50 - 36 = 14 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Step 5: Determine how many key chains Timothy can buy
Key chains are sold at 3 pieces for $2. First, determine how many sets of 3 key chains Timothy can buy with his remaining $14.

\[
\text{Number of sets of key chains} = \frac{14}{2} = 7 \text{ sets}
\]

Since each set contains 3 key chains, calculate the total number of key chains Timothy can buy.

\[
\text{Total number of key chains} = 7 \times 3 = 21 \text{ pieces}
\]

### Final Answer
Timothy can buy 21 pieces of key chains with the amount of money he has left.
