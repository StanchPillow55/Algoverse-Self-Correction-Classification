To solve the problem, we need to calculate the new salaries for both Hansel and Gretel after their respective raises, and then find the difference between their new salaries.

**Step 1: Calculate Hansel's new salary after the raise.**

Hansel's current salary is $30,000. He received a 10% raise. 

To find the amount of the raise, we calculate 10% of $30,000:

\[
\text{Raise for Hansel} = 0.10 \times 30,000 = 3,000
\]

Now, we add this raise to Hansel's current salary to find his new salary:

\[
\text{New salary for Hansel} = 30,000 + 3,000 = 33,000
\]

**Step 2: Calculate Gretel's new salary after the raise.**

Gretel also has a current salary of $30,000, but she received a 15% raise. 

To find the amount of the raise, we calculate 15% of $30,000:

\[
\text{Raise for Gretel} = 0.15 \times 30,000 = 4,500
\]

Now, we add this raise to Gretel's current salary to find her new salary:

\[
\text{New salary for Gretel} = 30,000 + 4,500 = 34,500
\]

**Step 3: Calculate the difference between Gretel's and Hansel's new salaries.**

Now that we have both new salaries, we can find out how much more money Gretel makes compared to Hansel:

\[
\text{Difference} = \text{New salary for Gretel} - \text{New salary for Hansel}
\]

Substituting the values we calculated:

\[
\text{Difference} = 34,500 - 33,000 = 1,500
\]

**Final Answer:**

Gretel will make $1,500 more than Hansel after their raises.
