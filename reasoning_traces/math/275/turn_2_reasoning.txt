==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to calculate the new salaries for both Hansel and Gretel after their respective raises and then find the difference between their new salaries.

### Step 1: Calculate Hansel's new salary after the raise.

1. **Current Salary of Hansel**: $30,000
2. **Raise Percentage for Hansel**: 10%

To find the amount of the raise, we multiply Hansel's current salary by the raise percentage:

\[
\text{Raise Amount for Hansel} = \text{Current Salary} \times \text{Raise Percentage}
\]

\[
\text{Raise Amount for Hansel} = 30,000 \times 0.10 = 3,000
\]

Now, we add the raise amount to Hansel's current salary to find his new salary:

\[
\text{New Salary for Hansel} = \text{Current Salary} + \text{Raise Amount}
\]

\[
\text{New Salary for Hansel} = 30,000 + 3,000 = 33,000
\]

### Step 2: Calculate Gretel's new salary after the raise.

1. **Current Salary of Gretel**: $30,000 (same as Hansel)
2. **Raise Percentage for Gretel**: 15%

Similarly, we calculate the amount of the raise for Gretel:

\[
\text{Raise Amount for Gretel} = \text{Current Salary} \times \text{Raise Percentage}
\]

\[
\text{Raise Amount for Gretel} = 30,000 \times 0.15 = 4,500
\]

Now, we add the raise amount to Gretel's current salary to find her new salary:

\[
\text{New Salary for Gretel} = \text{Current Salary} + \text{Raise Amount}
\]

\[
\text{New Salary for Gretel} = 30,000 + 4,500 = 34,500
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the difference in salary between Gretel and Hansel.

Now that we have both new salaries, we can find out how much more money Gretel makes compared to Hansel:

\[
\text{Difference} = \text{New Salary for Gretel} - \text{New Salary for Hansel}
\]

\[
\text{Difference} = 34,500 - 33,000 = 1,500
\]

### Final Answer

Gretel will make **$1,500** more than Hansel after their raises.
