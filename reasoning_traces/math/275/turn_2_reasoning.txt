Question ID: 275
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the new salaries for both Hansel and Gretel after their respective raises and then determine the difference between their new salaries.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Calculate Hansel's New Salary:**
   - Hansel's original salary is $30,000.
   - He received a 10% raise.
   - To find the amount of the raise, we calculate 10% of $30,000:
     \[
     \text{Raise for Hansel} = 0.10 \times 30,000 = 3,000
     \]
   - Add the raise to Hansel's original salary to find his new salary:
     \[
     \text{Hansel's New Salary} = 30,000 + 3,000 = 33,000
     \]

2. **Calculate Gretel's New Salary:**
   - Gretel's original salary is also $30,000.
   - She received a 15% raise.
   - To find the amount of the raise, we calculate 15% of $30,000:
     \[
     \text{Raise for Gretel} = 0.15 \times 30,000 = 4,500
     \]
   - Add the raise to Gretel's original salary to find her new salary:
     \[
     \text{Gretel's New Salary} = 30,000 + 4,500 = 34,500
     \]

3. **Calculate the Difference in Their New Salaries:**
   - Subtract Hansel's new salary from Gretel's new salary to find how much more Gretel makes:
     \[
     \text{Difference} = 34,500 - 33,000 = 1,500
     \]

### Conclusion:
Gretel will make $1,500 more than Hansel after their respective raises.

**Final Answer:**
Gretel will make $1,500 more than Hansel.
