==================================================

To determine how much more money Gretel will make compared to Hansel after their respective raises, we will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate Hansel's new salary after the raise.**
2. **Calculate Gretel's new salary after the raise.**
3. **Find the difference between Gretel's new salary and Hansel's new salary.**

### Step 1: Calculate Hansel's new salary

Hansel's current salary is $30,000. He received a 10% raise.

To calculate the amount of the raise:
\[
\text{Raise for Hansel} = \text{Current Salary} \times \text{Raise Percentage} = 30,000 \times 0.10 = 3,000
\]

Now, we add the raise to Hansel's current salary to find his new salary:
\[
\text{New Salary for Hansel} = \text{Current Salary} + \text{Raise} = 30,000 + 3,000 = 33,000
\]

### Step 2: Calculate Gretel's new salary

Gretel also has a current salary of $30,000, but she received a 15% raise.

To calculate the amount of the raise:
\[
\text{Raise for Gretel} = \text{Current Salary} \times \text{Raise Percentage} = 30,000 \times 0.15 = 4,500
\]

Now, we add the raise to Gretel's current salary to find her new salary:
\[
\text{New Salary for Gretel} = \text{Current Salary} + \text{Raise} = 30,000 + 4,500 = 34,500
\]

### Step 3: Find the difference between Gretel's new salary and Hansel's new salary

Now we will calculate how much more money Gretel makes compared to Hansel:
\[
\text{Difference} = \text{New Salary for Gretel} - \text{New Salary for Hansel} = 34,500 - 33,000 = 1,500
\]

### Final Answer

Gretel will make **$1,500** more than Hansel after their raises.
