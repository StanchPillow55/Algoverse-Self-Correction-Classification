To solve this problem, we need to calculate the new salaries for both Hansel and Gretel after their respective raises and then find the difference between their new salaries.

### Step 1: Calculate Hansel's New Salary

Hansel's original salary is $30,000. He received a 10% raise. To find the amount of the raise, we calculate 10% of $30,000:

\[
\text{Hansel's Raise} = 0.10 \times 30,000 = 3,000
\]

Now, we add the raise to Hansel's original salary to find his new salary:

\[
\text{Hansel's New Salary} = 30,000 + 3,000 = 33,000
\]

### Step 2: Calculate Gretel's New Salary

Gretel's original salary is also $30,000. She received a 15% raise. To find the amount of the raise, we calculate 15% of $30,000:

\[
\text{Gretel's Raise} = 0.15 \times 30,000 = 4,500
\]

Now, we add the raise to Gretel's original salary to find her new salary:

\[
\text{Gretel's New Salary} = 30,000 + 4,500 = 34,500
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the Difference in Their New Salaries

Now that we have both new salaries, we can find the difference between Gretel's new salary and Hansel's new salary:

\[
\text{Difference} = \text{Gretel's New Salary} - \text{Hansel's New Salary} = 34,500 - 33,000 = 1,500
\]

### Conclusion

Gretel will make $1,500 more than Hansel after their raises.

**Final Answer:** Gretel will make $1,500 more than Hansel.
