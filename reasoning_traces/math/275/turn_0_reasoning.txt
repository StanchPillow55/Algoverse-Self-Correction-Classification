==================================================

To find out how many lines Sean has to memorize, we will break down the problem step by step.

1. **Solo Song Lines**: 
   - The solo song has **54 lines**.

2. **First Scene Lines**:
   - The first scene has **twice the number of lines** as the solo song. 
   - Therefore, the number of lines in the first scene is:
     \[
     2 \times 54 = 108 \text{ lines}
     \]
   - Only **one-third** of these lines are Sean's lines. 
   - Thus, the number of lines Sean has to memorize from the first scene is:
     \[
     \frac{1}{3} \times 108 = 36 \text{ lines}
     \]

3. **Second Scene Lines**:
   - The second scene has **six more lines** than the solo song. 
   - Therefore, the number of lines in the second scene is:
     \[
     54 + 6 = 60 \text{ lines}
     \]
   - **Four-fifths** of these lines are Sean's lines. 
   - Thus, the number of lines Sean has to memorize from the second scene is:
     \[
     \frac{4}{5} \times 60 = 48 \text{ lines}
     \]

4. **Total Lines Memorized**:
   - Now, we will add the lines from the solo song, the first scene, and the second scene to find the total number of lines Sean has to memorize:
     \[
     54 \text{ (solo song)} + 36 \text{ (first scene)} + 48 \text{ (second scene)} = 138 \text{ lines}
     \]

Thus, the total number of lines Sean has to memorize is:

\[
\boxed{138}
\]
