==================================================

To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the number of red pens:**
   - Alain's mom bought 5 packs of red pens.
   - Each pack contains 5 pens.
   - Therefore, the total number of red pens can be calculated as follows:

   \[
   \text{Total red pens} = \text{Number of packs} \times \text{Pens per pack} = 5 \times 5 = 25
   \]

   So, Alain has 25 red pens.

2. **Determine the number of black pens:**
   - According to the problem, Alain's mom bought twice the amount of black pens than the red pens.
   - Since we found that there are 25 red pens, the number of black pens can be calculated as follows:

   \[
   \text{Total black pens} = 2 \times \text{Total red pens} = 2 \times 25 = 50
   \]

   So, Alain has 50 black pens.

3. **Calculate the total number of pens:**
   - Now, we need to find the total number of pens Alain has, which is the sum of the red and black pens:

   \[
   \text{Total pens} = \text{Total red pens} + \text{Total black pens} = 25 + 50 = 75
   \]

Thus, the final answer is that Alain has a total of **75 pens**.
