==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 154," we need to first understand what the problem entails. Since the problem is not explicitly stated, I'll assume this is a placeholder for a typical math problem, and I'll create a sample problem based on the number 154. Let's consider the following problem:

**Problem:**
Find the prime factorization of 154 and determine if 154 is a perfect square.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Prime Factorization of 154:**

   To find the prime factorization, we need to divide 154 by the smallest prime numbers until we reach 1.

   - Start with the smallest prime number, 2. Check if 154 is divisible by 2:
     \[
     154 \div 2 = 77
     \]
     Since 154 is even, it is divisible by 2. So, 2 is a factor.

   - Next, take 77 and check divisibility by the next smallest prime number, 3. The sum of the digits of 77 is \(7 + 7 = 14\), which is not divisible by 3. So, 77 is not divisible by 3.

   - Check divisibility by 5. Since 77 does not end in 0 or 5, it is not divisible by 5.

   - Check divisibility by 7:
     \[
     77 \div 7 = 11
     \]
     77 is divisible by 7. So, 7 is a factor.

   - Now, take 11. Since 11 is a prime number, it is only divisible by 1 and itself.

   Therefore, the prime factorization of 154 is:
   \[
   154 = 2 \times 7 \times 11
   \]

2. **Determine if 154 is a Perfect Square:**

   A perfect square is a number that can be expressed as the square of an integer. For 154 to be a perfect square, all the prime factors must appear in pairs.

   From the prime factorization \(154 = 2 \times 7 \times 11\), none of the prime factors are repeated. Therefore, 154 is not a perfect square.

**Final Answer:**

The prime factorization of 154 is \(2 \times 7 \times 11\). The number 154 is not a perfect square.
