==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 154," we need to first understand what the problem is asking. However, the problem statement "Sample math problem 154" is not specific enough for us to determine what the actual math problem is. It seems like a placeholder or a reference to a specific problem that is not provided here.

To proceed, let's assume that "Sample math problem 154" refers to a common type of math problem. Without specific details, I'll create a sample problem and solve it step by step.

**Sample Problem:**
Let's assume "Sample math problem 154" is a basic algebra problem. For instance:

Solve for \( x \) in the equation:
\[ 2x + 3 = 11 \]

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Equation:**
   The equation given is \( 2x + 3 = 11 \). Our goal is to solve for \( x \).

2. **Isolate the Variable:**
   To isolate \( x \), we need to get rid of the constant term on the left side of the equation. We do this by subtracting 3 from both sides of the equation:
   \[
   2x + 3 - 3 = 11 - 3
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   2x = 8
   \]

3. **Solve for \( x \):**
   Now, we need to solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides of the equation by 2:
   \[
   \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{8}{2}
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   x = 4
   \]

4. **Verify the Solution:**
   To ensure our solution is correct, we substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation:
   \[
   2(4) + 3 = 11
   \]
   Simplifying the left side gives:
   \[
   8 + 3 = 11
   \]
   Since both sides of the equation are equal, our solution \( x = 4 \) is correct.

**Final Answer:**
The solution to the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \) is \( x = 4 \).
