==================================================

It seems like the problem statement "Sample math problem 275" is not clear or complete. However, I will assume that "275" is the number you want to work with, and I'll create a math problem involving this number. Let's consider a problem involving basic arithmetic operations and properties of the number 275.

### Problem:
Determine if the number 275 is a prime number. If it is not a prime number, find its prime factorization.

### Solution:

To determine if 275 is a prime number, we need to check if it has any divisors other than 1 and itself. A prime number has exactly two distinct positive divisors: 1 and the number itself.

#### Step 1: Check divisibility by smaller prime numbers

1. **Divisibility by 2**: A number is divisible by 2 if it is even. Since 275 is odd, it is not divisible by 2.

2. **Divisibility by 3**: A number is divisible by 3 if the sum of its digits is divisible by 3. The sum of the digits of 275 is \(2 + 7 + 5 = 14\). Since 14 is not divisible by 3, 275 is not divisible by 3.

3. **Divisibility by 5**: A number is divisible by 5 if it ends in 0 or 5. Since 275 ends in 5, it is divisible by 5.

   \[
   275 \div 5 = 55
   \]

   So, 275 = 5 × 55.

4. **Check if 55 is a prime number**: Since 55 is greater than 1, we need to check if it has any divisors other than 1 and itself.

   - **Divisibility by 2**: 55 is odd, so it is not divisible by 2.
   - **Divisibility by 3**: The sum of the digits of 55 is \(5 + 5 = 10\). Since 10 is not divisible by 3, 55 is not divisible by 3.
   - **Divisibility by 5**: Since 55 ends in 5, it is divisible by 5.

   \[
   55 \div 5 = 11
   \]

   So, 55 = 5 × 11.

5. **Check if 11 is a prime number**: The number 11 is a prime number because it has no divisors other than 1 and 11.

#### Step 2: Prime Factorization of 275

From the above steps, we have:

- 275 = 5 × 55
- 55 = 5 × 11

Therefore, the prime factorization of 275 is:

\[
275 = 5 \times 5 \times 11 = 5^2 \times 11
\]

### Conclusion:

275 is not a prime number. Its prime factorization is \(5^2 \times 11\).

**Final Answer:**
The prime factorization of 275 is \(5^2 \times 11\).
