==================================================

It seems like the problem statement is incomplete or unclear. "Sample math problem 275" doesn't provide enough information to determine what the problem is asking. However, I can create a sample math problem involving the number 275 and solve it step by step. Let's consider a problem involving basic arithmetic and properties of numbers.

### Problem:
Determine if the number 275 is a prime number. If it is not, find its prime factorization.

### Solution:

To determine if 275 is a prime number, we need to check if it has any divisors other than 1 and itself. A prime number has exactly two distinct positive divisors: 1 and the number itself.

#### Step 1: Check divisibility by 2
A number is divisible by 2 if it is even. Since 275 is odd (it does not end in 0, 2, 4, 6, or 8), it is not divisible by 2.

#### Step 2: Check divisibility by 3
A number is divisible by 3 if the sum of its digits is divisible by 3. The sum of the digits of 275 is:
\[ 2 + 7 + 5 = 14 \]
Since 14 is not divisible by 3, 275 is not divisible by 3.

#### Step 3: Check divisibility by 5
A number is divisible by 5 if it ends in 0 or 5. Since 275 ends in 5, it is divisible by 5.

Perform the division:
\[ 275 \div 5 = 55 \]

Since 275 is divisible by 5, it is not a prime number. We now know one factor is 5, and the quotient is 55.

#### Step 4: Factor 55
Next, we need to factor 55. We check for divisibility by smaller prime numbers.

- **Divisibility by 2**: 55 is odd, so it is not divisible by 2.
- **Divisibility by 3**: The sum of the digits of 55 is \(5 + 5 = 10\), which is not divisible by 3.
- **Divisibility by 5**: 55 ends in 5, so it is divisible by 5.

Perform the division:
\[ 55 \div 5 = 11 \]

Now we have:
\[ 275 = 5 \times 55 = 5 \times 5 \times 11 \]

#### Step 5: Check if 11 is prime
The number 11 is a prime number because it has no divisors other than 1 and itself.

### Conclusion:
The prime factorization of 275 is:
\[ 275 = 5^2 \times 11 \]

### Final Answer:
275 is not a prime number. Its prime factorization is \(5^2 \times 11\).
