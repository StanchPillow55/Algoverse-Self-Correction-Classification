Question ID: mathbench_275
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 275," we first need to understand what the problem is asking. However, the problem statement "Sample math problem 275" is not specific enough to determine the exact nature of the problem. It could refer to a variety of mathematical problems, such as an arithmetic calculation, an algebraic equation, a geometry problem, or something else entirely.

Since the problem is not clearly defined, let's assume a hypothetical problem for demonstration purposes. Let's say the problem involves basic arithmetic operations with the number 275. We will perform a series of operations to illustrate how to solve a math problem step by step.

### Hypothetical Problem:
Calculate the following expression: \( 275 + 125 - 50 \times 2 \div 5 \).

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Identify the Order of Operations:**
   According to the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS), we need to perform calculations in the following order:
   - Parentheses/Brackets
   - Exponents/Orders (such as squares and square roots, etc.)
   - Multiplication and Division (from left to right)
   - Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)

2. **Perform Multiplication and Division First:**
   In the expression \( 275 + 125 - 50 \times 2 \div 5 \), we first handle the multiplication and division:
   - Calculate \( 50 \times 2 = 100 \).
   - Then, divide the result by 5: \( 100 \div 5 = 20 \).

3. **Substitute Back into the Expression:**
   Replace the multiplication and division part of the expression with the result:
   \[
   275 + 125 - 20
   \]

4. **Perform Addition and Subtraction:**
   Now, perform the addition and subtraction from left to right:
   - First, add \( 275 + 125 = 400 \).
   - Then, subtract \( 20 \) from the result: \( 400 - 20 = 380 \).

### Final Answer:
The result of the expression \( 275 + 125 - 50 \times 2 \div 5 \) is \( 380 \).

Thus, the final answer to our hypothetical problem is \( 380 \).
