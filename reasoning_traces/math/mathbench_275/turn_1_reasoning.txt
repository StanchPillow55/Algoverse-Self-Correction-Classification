==================================================

To solve the problem labeled as "Sample math problem 275," we need to first understand what the problem entails. However, since the problem statement is not provided, I'll demonstrate how to approach a generic math problem by creating a hypothetical problem labeled as "Sample math problem 275."

Let's assume "Sample math problem 275" is the following:

**Problem Statement:**
Calculate the sum of all even numbers between 1 and 275.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Identify the Range of Even Numbers:**
   - The even numbers between 1 and 275 start from 2 and go up to 274.

2. **Determine the Sequence of Even Numbers:**
   - The sequence of even numbers is an arithmetic sequence where the first term \( a_1 = 2 \) and the common difference \( d = 2 \).

3. **Find the Last Term of the Sequence:**
   - The last term \( a_n \) of the sequence is 274.

4. **Calculate the Number of Terms in the Sequence:**
   - Use the formula for the \( n \)-th term of an arithmetic sequence:
     \[
     a_n = a_1 + (n-1) \times d
     \]
   - Plug in the known values:
     \[
     274 = 2 + (n-1) \times 2
     \]
   - Simplify and solve for \( n \):
     \[
     274 = 2 + 2n - 2
     \]
     \[
     274 = 2n
     \]
     \[
     n = \frac{274}{2} = 137
     \]
   - There are 137 even numbers between 1 and 275.

5. **Calculate the Sum of the Sequence:**
   - Use the formula for the sum \( S_n \) of an arithmetic sequence:
     \[
     S_n = \frac{n}{2} \times (a_1 + a_n)
     \]
   - Substitute the known values:
     \[
     S_{137} = \frac{137}{2} \times (2 + 274)
     \]
     \[
     S_{137} = \frac{137}{2} \times 276
     \]
     \[
     S_{137} = 137 \times 138
     \]

6. **Perform the Multiplication:**
   - Calculate \( 137 \times 138 \):
     \[
     137 \times 138 = 137 \times (140 - 2)
     \]
     \[
     = 137 \times 140 - 137 \times 2
     \]
     \[
     = 19180 - 274
     \]
     \[
     = 18906
     \]

**Final Answer:**
The sum of all even numbers between 1 and 275 is 18,906.
