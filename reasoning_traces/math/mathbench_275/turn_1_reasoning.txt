Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 275," we need to first understand what the problem is asking. However, the problem statement "Sample math problem 275" is not clear or specific enough to determine what kind of mathematical problem it is. It could refer to a variety of mathematical topics such as arithmetic, algebra, geometry, calculus, or any other area of mathematics.

Since the problem is not specified, I will assume it is a simple arithmetic problem involving the number 275. Let's explore a few possible interpretations and solve them:

### Interpretation 1: Basic Arithmetic Operations

1. **Addition**: Let's add 275 to another number, say 125.
   \[
   275 + 125 = 400
   \]

2. **Subtraction**: Let's subtract 125 from 275.
   \[
   275 - 125 = 150
   \]

3. **Multiplication**: Let's multiply 275 by 2.
   \[
   275 \times 2 = 550
   \]

4. **Division**: Let's divide 275 by 5.
   \[
   275 \div 5 = 55
   \]

### Interpretation 2: Prime Factorization

Let's find the prime factorization of 275.

1. Check divisibility by 2: 275 is odd, so it's not divisible by 2.
2. Check divisibility by 3: The sum of the digits \(2 + 7 + 5 = 14\) is not divisible by 3.
3. Check divisibility by 5: The last digit is 5, so 275 is divisible by 5.
   \[
   275 \div 5 = 55
   \]
4. Factor 55: Check divisibility by 5 again.
   \[
   55 \div 5 = 11
   \]
5. 11 is a prime number.

Thus, the prime factorization of 275 is:
\[
275 = 5^2 \times 11
\]

### Interpretation 3: Solving an Equation

Let's assume "Sample math problem 275" refers to solving an equation where 275 is the solution. Consider the equation:
\[
x + 25 = 300
\]

To solve for \(x\), subtract 25 from both sides:
\[
x = 300 - 25 = 275
\]

### Conclusion

Without a specific problem statement, we explored several interpretations involving the number 275. Here are the results:

- Basic arithmetic operations with 275 yield various results.
- The prime factorization of 275 is \(5^2 \times 11\).
- Solving the equation \(x + 25 = 300\) gives \(x = 275\).

If you have a specific problem involving the number 275, please provide more details for a targeted solution.
