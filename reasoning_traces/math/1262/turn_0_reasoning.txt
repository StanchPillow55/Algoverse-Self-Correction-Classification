To solve the problem, we need to determine how long it will take John to speak 10 pages, given his speaking speed after training.

### Step 1: Calculate John's new speaking speed after training.

John's normal speaking speed is 150 words per minute (WPM). After training, his speed increases to 2.5 times his normal speed.

\[
\text{New Speed} = 150 \, \text{WPM} \times 2.5 = 375 \, \text{WPM}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the total number of words in 10 pages.

Each page contains 450 words. Therefore, for 10 pages, the total number of words is:

\[
\text{Total Words} = 10 \, \text{pages} \times 450 \, \text{words/page} = 4500 \, \text{words}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the time it takes to speak 4500 words at the new speed.

To find the time it takes to speak 4500 words at a speed of 375 WPM, we use the formula:

\[
\text{Time (in minutes)} = \frac{\text{Total Words}}{\text{Speed (WPM)}}
\]

Substituting the values we have:

\[
\text{Time} = \frac{4500 \, \text{words}}{375 \, \text{WPM}} = 12 \, \text{minutes}
\]

### Final Answer

Thus, it would take John **12 minutes** to speak 10 pages at his new speed.
