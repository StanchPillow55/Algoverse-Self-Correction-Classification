Question ID: 1262
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we will follow these steps:

1. **Determine John's new speaking speed after training.**
2. **Calculate the total number of words in 10 pages.**
3. **Calculate the time it takes to speak that number of words at the new speed.**

### Step 1: Determine John's New Speaking Speed

John's normal speaking speed is 150 words per minute (WPM). After training, his speed is 2.5 times faster.

\[
\text{New Speed} = \text{Normal Speed} \times 2.5 = 150 \, \text{WPM} \times 2.5
\]

Calculating this:

\[
\text{New Speed} = 150 \times 2.5 = 375 \, \text{WPM}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the Total Number of Words in 10 Pages

Each page has 450 words, and we need to find the total number of words in 10 pages.

\[
\text{Total Words} = \text{Words per Page} \times \text{Number of Pages} = 450 \, \text{words/page} \times 10 \, \text{pages}
\]

Calculating this:

\[
\text{Total Words} = 4500 \, \text{words}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the Time to Speak 4500 Words at the New Speed

Now, we need to find out how long it takes to speak 4500 words at the new speed of 375 WPM.

The time in minutes can be calculated using the formula:

\[
\text{Time (minutes)} = \frac{\text{Total Words}}{\text{Speed (WPM)}}
\]

Substituting the values we have:

\[
\text{Time} = \frac{4500 \, \text{words}}{375 \, \text{WPM}}
\]

Calculating this:

\[
\text{Time} = 12 \, \text{minutes}
\]

### Final Answer

It would take John **12 minutes** to speak 10 pages at his new speed of 375 WPM.
