Question ID: 1262
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine John's new speaking speed after training.**
2. **Calculate the total number of words he needs to speak.**
3. **Calculate the time it will take him to speak that number of words at his new speed.**

### Step 1: Determine John's New Speaking Speed

John's normal speaking speed is 150 words per minute (WPM). After training, his speed increases to 2.5 times his normal speed.

\[
\text{New Speed} = \text{Normal Speed} \times 2.5
\]
\[
\text{New Speed} = 150 \, \text{WPM} \times 2.5 = 375 \, \text{WPM}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the Total Number of Words

Next, we need to find out how many words are in 10 pages if each page has 450 words.

\[
\text{Total Words} = \text{Number of Pages} \times \text{Words per Page}
\]
\[
\text{Total Words} = 10 \, \text{pages} \times 450 \, \text{words/page} = 4500 \, \text{words}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the Time to Speak the Total Words

Now, we will calculate how long it will take John to speak 4500 words at his new speed of 375 WPM.

To find the time in minutes, we use the formula:

\[
\text{Time (minutes)} = \frac{\text{Total Words}}{\text{New Speed}}
\]
\[
\text{Time (minutes)} = \frac{4500 \, \text{words}}{375 \, \text{WPM}} = 12 \, \text{minutes}
\]

### Final Answer

It would take John **12 minutes** to speak 10 pages at his new speed of 375 WPM.
