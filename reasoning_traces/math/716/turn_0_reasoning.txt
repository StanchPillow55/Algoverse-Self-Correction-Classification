To find the total number of calories in John's omelet, we need to calculate the calories contributed by each ingredient: eggs, cheese, and ham. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Calculate the calories from the eggs:**
   - John uses 6 eggs.
   - Each egg has 75 calories.
   - Total calories from eggs = Number of eggs × Calories per egg
   \[
   \text{Total calories from eggs} = 6 \, \text{eggs} \times 75 \, \text{calories/egg} = 450 \, \text{calories}
   \]

2. **Calculate the calories from the cheese:**
   - John uses 2 oz of cheese.
   - Each ounce of cheese has 120 calories.
   - Total calories from cheese = Amount of cheese (in oz) × Calories per ounce
   \[
   \text{Total calories from cheese} = 2 \, \text{oz} \times 120 \, \text{calories/oz} = 240 \, \text{calories}
   \]

3. **Calculate the calories from the ham:**
   - John uses an equal amount of ham, which is also 2 oz.
   - Each ounce of ham has 40 calories.
   - Total calories from ham = Amount of ham (in oz) × Calories per ounce
   \[
   \text{Total calories from ham} = 2 \, \text{oz} \times 40 \, \text{calories/oz} = 80 \, \text{calories}
   \]

4. **Add all the calories together:**
   - Total calories in the omelet = Total calories from eggs + Total calories from cheese + Total calories from ham
   \[
   \text{Total calories in omelet} = 450 \, \text{calories} + 240 \, \text{calories} + 80 \, \text{calories}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total calories in omelet} = 450 + 240 + 80 = 770 \, \text{calories}
   \]

Thus, the total number of calories in John's omelet is **770 calories**. 

Final Answer: **770 calories**.
