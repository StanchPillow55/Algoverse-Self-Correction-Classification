==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample math problem 361" refers to. Since there is no specific problem statement provided, I'll create a sample math problem with the number 361 and solve it step by step.

Let's assume the problem is as follows:

**Problem:**
Determine if the number 361 is a perfect square. If it is, find the square root of 361.

**Solution:**

1. **Understanding Perfect Squares:**
   A perfect square is an integer that is the square of an integer. In other words, if \( n^2 = x \), then \( x \) is a perfect square and \( n \) is the square root of \( x \).

2. **Checking if 361 is a Perfect Square:**
   To determine if 361 is a perfect square, we need to find an integer \( n \) such that \( n^2 = 361 \).

3. **Estimating the Square Root:**
   We start by estimating the square root of 361. Since \( 19^2 = 361 \), we can check if 19 is the correct square root.

4. **Calculating \( 19^2 \):**
   \[
   19^2 = 19 \times 19
   \]
   \[
   = 19 \times (10 + 9)
   \]
   \[
   = 19 \times 10 + 19 \times 9
   \]
   \[
   = 190 + 171
   \]
   \[
   = 361
   \]

5. **Verification:**
   Since \( 19^2 = 361 \), 361 is indeed a perfect square, and the square root of 361 is 19.

6. **Conclusion:**
   The number 361 is a perfect square, and its square root is 19.

**Final Answer:**
The square root of 361 is 19.
