It seems like you haven't provided a specific math problem to solve. However, I can demonstrate how to approach a generic math problem step by step. Let's consider a sample problem:

**Problem: Solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 2x + 5 = 15 \).**

### Step 1: Understand the Equation
The equation \( 2x + 5 = 15 \) is a linear equation in one variable. Our goal is to isolate \( x \).

### Step 2: Isolate the Variable
To isolate \( x \), we need to eliminate the constant term on the left side of the equation. We can do this by subtracting 5 from both sides.

\[
2x + 5 - 5 = 15 - 5
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
2x = 10
\]

### Step 3: Solve for \( x \)
Now, we need to solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides of the equation by 2.

\[
\frac{2x}{2} = \frac{10}{2}
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
x = 5
\]

### Step 4: Verify the Solution
To ensure our solution is correct, we can substitute \( x = 5 \) back into the original equation:

\[
2(5) + 5 = 15
\]

Calculating the left side:

\[
10 + 5 = 15
\]

Since both sides of the equation are equal, our solution is verified.

### Final Answer
The solution to the equation \( 2x + 5 = 15 \) is:

\[
\boxed{5}
\]

If you have a specific math problem you'd like me to solve, please provide it, and I'll be happy to help!
