It seems that the specific math problem you want me to solve is not provided. However, I can guide you through a generic example of a math problem step by step. If you have a specific problem in mind, please share it, and I will solve it accordingly.

### Example Problem:
**Problem:** Solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).

### Step 1: Understand the equation
We have a linear equation where we need to isolate \( x \). The equation is structured as follows:
- The left side consists of \( 2x + 3 \).
- The right side is the constant \( 11 \).

### Step 2: Isolate the term with \( x \)
To isolate \( 2x \), we need to eliminate the constant term on the left side. We can do this by subtracting \( 3 \) from both sides of the equation.

\[
2x + 3 - 3 = 11 - 3
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
2x = 8
\]

### Step 3: Solve for \( x \)
Now, we need to solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides of the equation by \( 2 \).

\[
\frac{2x}{2} = \frac{8}{2}
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
x = 4
\]

### Step 4: Verify the solution
To ensure that our solution is correct, we can substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation:

\[
2(4) + 3 = 11
\]

Calculating the left side:

\[
8 + 3 = 11
\]

Since both sides of the equation are equal, our solution is verified.

### Final Answer:
The value of \( x \) is \( 4 \).
