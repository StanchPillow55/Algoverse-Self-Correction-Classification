==================================================

Certainly! However, it seems like the problem statement "Sample math problem 2" is not specific enough for me to provide a detailed solution. To proceed effectively, I need a clear and specific math problem to solve. 

If you have a particular math problem in mind, please provide the details, and I'll be happy to work through it step by step, showing all calculations and reasoning.
