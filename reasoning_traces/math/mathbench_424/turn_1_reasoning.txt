==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 424," we first need to understand what the problem entails. However, since "Sample math problem 424" is not a specific math problem, I will create a hypothetical math problem with the number 424 and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**
Calculate the sum of the digits of the number 424 and determine if the sum is a prime number.

**Step 1: Identify the digits of the number 424.**

The number 424 consists of the digits 4, 2, and 4.

**Step 2: Calculate the sum of the digits.**

To find the sum of the digits, we add them together:

\[ 4 + 2 + 4 = 10 \]

**Step 3: Determine if the sum is a prime number.**

A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. Let's check if 10 is a prime number:

- The divisors of 10 are 1, 2, 5, and 10.
- Since 10 has divisors other than 1 and itself, it is not a prime number.

**Conclusion:**

The sum of the digits of the number 424 is 10, and 10 is not a prime number.

**Final Answer:**

The sum of the digits of 424 is 10, and it is not a prime number.
