==================================================

It seems like you've referenced "Sample math problem 424," but without specific details about the problem, I can't provide a direct solution. However, I can guide you through a generic approach to solving a math problem. If you have specific details about the problem, please share them, and I'll be happy to help further.

### General Approach to Solving Math Problems

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - Carefully read the problem statement.
   - Identify what is being asked.
   - Note down any given information or data.

2. **Devise a Plan:**
   - Consider what mathematical concepts or formulas might be applicable.
   - Think about similar problems you've solved before.
   - Decide on a strategy to tackle the problem (e.g., algebraic manipulation, drawing a diagram, etc.).

3. **Carry Out the Plan:**
   - Execute your chosen strategy step by step.
   - Perform calculations carefully.
   - Keep track of units and ensure consistency.

4. **Check Your Work:**
   - Review each step to ensure there are no errors.
   - Verify that your solution makes sense in the context of the problem.
   - Consider alternative methods to see if they yield the same result.

5. **State the Final Answer:**
   - Clearly write down the final answer.
   - Include units if applicable.

### Example Problem

Let's consider a simple example problem:

**Problem:** Solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).

**Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We need to find the value of \( x \) that satisfies the equation.

2. **Devise a Plan:**
   - We can isolate \( x \) by performing algebraic operations.

3. **Carry Out the Plan:**
   - Start with the equation: \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).
   - Subtract 3 from both sides to isolate the term with \( x \):
     \[
     2x + 3 - 3 = 11 - 3 \implies 2x = 8
     \]
   - Divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( x \):
     \[
     \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{8}{2} \implies x = 4
     \]

4. **Check Your Work:**
   - Substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation to verify:
     \[
     2(4) + 3 = 8 + 3 = 11
     \]
   - The left side equals the right side, confirming our solution is correct.

5. **State the Final Answer:**
   - The solution to the equation is \( x = 4 \).
