==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample math problem 424" entails. Since no specific details are provided about this problem, let's assume it involves a typical math problem-solving scenario. I'll create a hypothetical problem and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem 424:**
Calculate the area of a triangle with vertices at points A(1, 2), B(4, 6), and C(6, 2).

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Identify the Coordinates:**
   - Point A: (1, 2)
   - Point B: (4, 6)
   - Point C: (6, 2)

2. **Use the Formula for the Area of a Triangle Given Vertices:**
   The area \( A \) of a triangle with vertices at \((x_1, y_1)\), \((x_2, y_2)\), and \((x_3, y_3)\) is given by:
   \[
   A = \frac{1}{2} \left| x_1(y_2-y_3) + x_2(y_3-y_1) + x_3(y_1-y_2) \right|
   \]

3. **Substitute the Coordinates into the Formula:**
   \[
   A = \frac{1}{2} \left| 1(6-2) + 4(2-2) + 6(2-6) \right|
   \]

4. **Calculate Each Term:**
   - First term: \( 1 \times (6 - 2) = 1 \times 4 = 4 \)
   - Second term: \( 4 \times (2 - 2) = 4 \times 0 = 0 \)
   - Third term: \( 6 \times (2 - 6) = 6 \times (-4) = -24 \)

5. **Sum the Terms:**
   \[
   4 + 0 - 24 = -20
   \]

6. **Calculate the Absolute Value:**
   \[
   \left| -20 \right| = 20
   \]

7. **Calculate the Area:**
   \[
   A = \frac{1}{2} \times 20 = 10
   \]

**Final Answer:**
The area of the triangle with vertices at points A(1, 2), B(4, 6), and C(6, 2) is 10 square units.
