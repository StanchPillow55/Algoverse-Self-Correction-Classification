==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to determine Vince's current age based on the information given about Liam's age.

1. **Identify Liam's current age**: 
   - Liam is currently 16 years old.

2. **Determine Liam's age two years ago**: 
   - Two years ago, Liam's age would have been:
     \[
     16 - 2 = 14 \text{ years old}
     \]

3. **Set up the relationship between Liam's age and Vince's age two years ago**: 
   - According to the problem, two years ago, Liam's age was twice the age of Vince. Let's denote Vince's age two years ago as \( V \).
   - The relationship can be expressed as:
     \[
     14 = 2V
     \]

4. **Solve for Vince's age two years ago**: 
   - To find \( V \), we can rearrange the equation:
     \[
     V = \frac{14}{2} = 7 \text{ years old}
     \]

5. **Determine Vince's current age**: 
   - Since we are looking for Vince's current age, we need to add 2 years to his age two years ago:
     \[
     \text{Vince's current age} = 7 + 2 = 9 \text{ years old}
     \]

6. **Final answer**: 
   - Therefore, Vince is currently \( \boxed{9} \) years old.
