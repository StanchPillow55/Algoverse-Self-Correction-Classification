To find out how many baby outfits Laurel has in total, we will break the problem down step by step.

1. **Calculate the number of outfits from her friend:**
   Laurel's friend gave her 24 baby outfits.

   \[
   \text{Outfits from friend} = 24
   \]

2. **Calculate the number of outfits received at the baby shower:**
   Laurel received twice the amount of outfits from her friend at her baby shower. Since her friend gave her 24 outfits, we calculate:

   \[
   \text{Outfits from baby shower} = 2 \times \text{Outfits from friend} = 2 \times 24 = 48
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of outfits gifted by her mom:**
   Laurel's mom gifted her another 15 baby outfits.

   \[
   \text{Outfits from mom} = 15
   \]

4. **Calculate the total number of outfits:**
   Now we will add all the outfits together to find the total number of outfits Laurel has.

   \[
   \text{Total outfits} = \text{Outfits from friend} + \text{Outfits from baby shower} + \text{Outfits from mom}
   \]

   Substituting the values we calculated:

   \[
   \text{Total outfits} = 24 + 48 + 15
   \]

   Now, we perform the addition step by step:

   - First, add the outfits from her friend and the baby shower:

   \[
   24 + 48 = 72
   \]

   - Next, add the outfits from her mom:

   \[
   72 + 15 = 87
   \]

5. **Final answer:**
   Therefore, the total number of baby outfits Laurel has is 

   \[
   \boxed{87}
   \]
