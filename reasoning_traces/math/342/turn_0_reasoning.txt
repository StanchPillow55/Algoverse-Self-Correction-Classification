To determine how long Mark was on the sideline during the 90-minute soccer game, we need to analyze the time he spent playing and the total duration of the game.

1. **Total Duration of the Game**: The soccer game lasts for 90 minutes.

2. **Time Played by Mark**:
   - First, Mark played for 20 minutes.
   - After resting, he played for another 35 minutes.

3. **Calculating Total Playing Time**:
   - We add the two periods of time Mark played:
     \[
     \text{Total Playing Time} = 20 \text{ minutes} + 35 \text{ minutes} = 55 \text{ minutes}
     \]

4. **Calculating Time on the Sideline**:
   - To find out how long Mark was on the sideline, we subtract the total playing time from the total duration of the game:
     \[
     \text{Time on Sideline} = \text{Total Duration} - \text{Total Playing Time}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Time on Sideline} = 90 \text{ minutes} - 55 \text{ minutes} = 35 \text{ minutes}
     \]

5. **Final Answer**:
   - Therefore, Mark was on the sideline for **35 minutes**.

In conclusion, after calculating the total time he played and subtracting it from the total game duration, we find that Mark was on the sideline for **35 minutes**.
