==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine how long Mark was on the sideline during the 90-minute soccer game.

1. **Understand the total duration of the game:**
   - The soccer game lasts for 90 minutes.

2. **Determine the total time Mark played:**
   - Mark played for 20 minutes initially.
   - After resting, he played for another 35 minutes.
   - Total time played by Mark = 20 minutes + 35 minutes = 55 minutes.

3. **Calculate the time Mark was not playing (on the sideline):**
   - Since the total game duration is 90 minutes and Mark played for 55 minutes, the time he was on the sideline is the difference between the total game time and the time he played.
   - Time on the sideline = Total game time - Total time played
   - Time on the sideline = 90 minutes - 55 minutes = 35 minutes.

Therefore, Mark was on the sideline for 35 minutes.

**Final Answer:**
Mark was on the sideline for 35 minutes.
