==================================================

To find the number of students enrolled this year in the calligraphy class, we need to calculate the increase in enrollment based on the previous year's enrollment.

1. **Identify the previous year's enrollment**:
   Last year, there were 50 students enrolled in the calligraphy class.

2. **Calculate the increase in enrollment**:
   We know that this year there was a 20% increase in enrollment. To find out how many students this increase represents, we need to calculate 20% of the previous year's enrollment.

   \[
   \text{Increase} = 20\% \text{ of } 50
   \]

   To convert the percentage to a decimal, we divide by 100:

   \[
   20\% = \frac{20}{100} = 0.20
   \]

   Now, we can calculate the increase:

   \[
   \text{Increase} = 0.20 \times 50
   \]

   Performing the multiplication:

   \[
   \text{Increase} = 10
   \]

3. **Calculate this year's total enrollment**:
   To find the total number of students enrolled this year, we add the increase to last year's enrollment:

   \[
   \text{Total enrollment this year} = \text{Last year's enrollment} + \text{Increase}
   \]

   Substituting the values we have:

   \[
   \text{Total enrollment this year} = 50 + 10
   \]

   Performing the addition:

   \[
   \text{Total enrollment this year} = 60
   \]

4. **Final answer**:
   Therefore, the number of students enrolled this year in the calligraphy class is 

   \[
   \boxed{60}
   \]
