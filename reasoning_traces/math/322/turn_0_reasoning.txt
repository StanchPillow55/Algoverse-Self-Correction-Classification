==================================================

To determine how much the restaurant charged for gratuities, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total cost before tax**: 
   The total bill is $140, which includes the cost of the food, drinks, sales tax, and gratuities. We need to first find out how much the food and drinks cost before tax.

   The cost of the NY Striploin is $80 and the cost of the glass of wine is $10. Therefore, the total cost before tax is:
   \[
   \text{Cost before tax} = \text{Cost of NY Striploin} + \text{Cost of wine} = 80 + 10 = 90
   \]

2. **Calculate the sales tax**:
   The sales tax rate is 10%. To find the sales tax on the cost before tax, we calculate:
   \[
   \text{Sales tax} = \text{Cost before tax} \times \text{Sales tax rate} = 90 \times 0.10 = 9
   \]

3. **Calculate the total cost including tax**:
   Now we can find the total cost including the sales tax:
   \[
   \text{Total cost including tax} = \text{Cost before tax} + \text{Sales tax} = 90 + 9 = 99
   \]

4. **Determine the amount charged for gratuities**:
   We know the total bill was $140. To find out how much was charged for gratuities, we subtract the total cost including tax from the total bill:
   \[
   \text{Gratuities} = \text{Total bill} - \text{Total cost including tax} = 140 - 99 = 41
   \]

Thus, the restaurant charged $41 for gratuities.

**Final Answer**: The amount charged for gratuities is **$41**.
