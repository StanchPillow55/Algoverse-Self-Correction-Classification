==================================================

To determine how much the restaurant charged for gratuities, we need to break down the total bill and identify each component: the cost of the items ordered, the sales tax, and the gratuities.

### Step-by-Step Breakdown:

1. **Identify the Cost of Items Ordered:**
   - NY Striploin: $80
   - Glass of Wine: $10
   - Total cost of items ordered = $80 + $10 = $90

2. **Calculate the Sales Tax:**
   - The sales tax rate is 10%.
   - Sales tax = 10% of the total cost of items ordered.
   - Sales tax = 0.10 Ã— $90 = $9

3. **Calculate the Total Cost Including Tax:**
   - Total cost including tax = Cost of items + Sales tax
   - Total cost including tax = $90 + $9 = $99

4. **Determine the Total Bill and Calculate Gratuities:**
   - The total bill charged was $140.
   - We know the total cost including tax is $99.
   - Therefore, the difference between the total bill and the total cost including tax is the gratuities charged.
   - Gratuities = Total bill - Total cost including tax
   - Gratuities = $140 - $99 = $41

### Conclusion:

The restaurant charged $41 for gratuities. 

**Final Answer: The gratuities charged were $41.**
