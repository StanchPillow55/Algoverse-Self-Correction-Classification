==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 271" refers to. Since the question itself is not provided, I'll assume this is a placeholder for a specific math problem. Without the actual problem statement, I will create a hypothetical math problem and solve it step-by-step.

Let's assume "Sample reasoning question 271" is a problem involving solving a quadratic equation. Here's a hypothetical problem:

**Problem:**
Solve the quadratic equation \(2x^2 - 4x - 6 = 0\).

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Identify the quadratic equation:**
   The given quadratic equation is \(2x^2 - 4x - 6 = 0\).

2. **Simplify the equation if possible:**
   We can simplify the equation by dividing all terms by 2:
   \[
   x^2 - 2x - 3 = 0
   \]

3. **Factor the quadratic equation:**
   We need to find two numbers that multiply to -3 (the constant term) and add to -2 (the coefficient of the linear term). These numbers are -3 and 1.
   \[
   (x - 3)(x + 1) = 0
   \]

4. **Solve for the roots:**
   Set each factor equal to zero and solve for \(x\):
   \[
   x - 3 = 0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad x = 3
   \]
   \[
   x + 1 = 0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad x = -1
   \]

5. **Verify the solutions:**
   Substitute \(x = 3\) and \(x = -1\) back into the original equation to verify:
   - For \(x = 3\):
     \[
     2(3)^2 - 4(3) - 6 = 18 - 12 - 6 = 0
     \]
   - For \(x = -1\):
     \[
     2(-1)^2 - 4(-1) - 6 = 2 + 4 - 6 = 0
     \]

   Both solutions satisfy the original equation.

**Final Answer:**
The solutions to the quadratic equation \(2x^2 - 4x - 6 = 0\) are \(x = 3\) and \(x = -1\).
