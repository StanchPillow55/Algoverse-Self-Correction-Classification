==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 485" entails. Since the problem statement is not specific, let's assume it's a hypothetical math problem that requires logical reasoning and step-by-step calculations. I'll create a sample problem and solve it.

**Sample Problem:**

Let's say we have a sequence of numbers where each number is the sum of the previous two numbers, starting with 1 and 1. This sequence is known as the Fibonacci sequence. We want to find the 10th number in this sequence.

**Step-by-step Solution:**

1. **Identify the Sequence:**
   The Fibonacci sequence starts with:
   - \( F_1 = 1 \)
   - \( F_2 = 1 \)

   Each subsequent number is the sum of the two preceding numbers:
   - \( F_3 = F_1 + F_2 = 1 + 1 = 2 \)
   - \( F_4 = F_2 + F_3 = 1 + 2 = 3 \)
   - \( F_5 = F_3 + F_4 = 2 + 3 = 5 \)
   - \( F_6 = F_4 + F_5 = 3 + 5 = 8 \)
   - \( F_7 = F_5 + F_6 = 5 + 8 = 13 \)
   - \( F_8 = F_6 + F_7 = 8 + 13 = 21 \)
   - \( F_9 = F_7 + F_8 = 13 + 21 = 34 \)
   - \( F_{10} = F_8 + F_9 = 21 + 34 = 55 \)

2. **Calculate the 10th Number:**
   From the calculations above, the 10th number in the Fibonacci sequence is 55.

3. **Verify the Calculation:**
   Let's quickly verify by listing the sequence:
   - \( F_1 = 1 \)
   - \( F_2 = 1 \)
   - \( F_3 = 2 \)
   - \( F_4 = 3 \)
   - \( F_5 = 5 \)
   - \( F_6 = 8 \)
   - \( F_7 = 13 \)
   - \( F_8 = 21 \)
   - \( F_9 = 34 \)
   - \( F_{10} = 55 \)

   The sequence is consistent with our calculations.

**Final Answer:**

The 10th number in the Fibonacci sequence is 55.
