==================================================

To solve this problem, I need more information about what "Sample reasoning question 485" entails. Since the question is not specified, I'll provide a general approach to solving a typical math problem and demonstrate the reasoning process.

Let's assume "Sample reasoning question 485" is a math problem involving algebra, such as solving an equation. Here's a step-by-step approach to solving a sample algebra problem:

**Sample Problem:**
Solve the equation \(2x + 3 = 11\).

**Step 1: Understand the Problem**
The goal is to find the value of \(x\) that makes the equation true.

**Step 2: Isolate the Variable**
To solve for \(x\), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We start by eliminating the constant term on the left side.

- Subtract 3 from both sides of the equation:
  \[
  2x + 3 - 3 = 11 - 3
  \]
  Simplifying both sides gives:
  \[
  2x = 8
  \]

**Step 3: Solve for the Variable**
Now, divide both sides by 2 to solve for \(x\).

- Divide both sides by 2:
  \[
  \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{8}{2}
  \]
  Simplifying gives:
  \[
  x = 4
  \]

**Step 4: Verify the Solution**
Substitute \(x = 4\) back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies the equation.

- Substitute \(x = 4\) into \(2x + 3 = 11\):
  \[
  2(4) + 3 = 11
  \]
  Simplifying the left side gives:
  \[
  8 + 3 = 11
  \]
  Since both sides are equal, \(x = 4\) is indeed the correct solution.

**Final Answer:**
The solution to the equation \(2x + 3 = 11\) is \(x = 4\).

This process demonstrates a structured approach to solving algebraic equations by isolating the variable, solving, and verifying the solution. If you have a specific problem or topic in mind, please provide more details so I can tailor the solution to that particular question.
