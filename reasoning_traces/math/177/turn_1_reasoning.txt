==================================================

To solve the problem, we will break down Zaid's expenses step by step, starting from his total salary and calculating each expense sequentially.

1. **Calculate Zaid's total salary**:
   \[
   \text{Total Salary} = 6000 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Calculate the amount spent on rent**:
   Zaid spends \( \frac{1}{4} \) of his salary on rent:
   \[
   \text{Rent} = \frac{1}{4} \times 6000 = 1500 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Calculate the amount spent on car fuel**:
   Zaid spends \( \frac{1}{3} \) of his salary on car fuel:
   \[
   \text{Car Fuel} = \frac{1}{3} \times 6000 = 2000 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Calculate the total amount spent on rent and car fuel**:
   \[
   \text{Total Spent on Rent and Fuel} = 1500 + 2000 = 3500 \text{ dollars}
   \]

5. **Calculate the remaining amount after rent and car fuel**:
   \[
   \text{Remaining Amount} = 6000 - 3500 = 2500 \text{ dollars}
   \]

6. **Calculate the amount donated to charity**:
   Zaid donates half of the remaining amount to charity:
   \[
   \text{Donation to Charity} = \frac{1}{2} \times 2500 = 1250 \text{ dollars}
   \]

7. **Calculate the remaining amount after the donation**:
   \[
   \text{Remaining Amount after Donation} = 2500 - 1250 = 1250 \text{ dollars}
   \]

8. **Calculate the amount given to his daughter**:
   Zaid gives his daughter 200 dollars:
   \[
   \text{Amount after Daughter's Expenses} = 1250 - 200 = 1050 \text{ dollars}
   \]

9. **Calculate the amount given to his wife**:
   Zaid gives his wife 700 dollars:
   \[
   \text{Final Amount after Wife's Expenses} = 1050 - 700 = 350 \text{ dollars}
   \]

10. **Final Calculation**:
   After all expenses and donations, Zaid has:
   \[
   \text{Final Amount} = 350 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{350}
\]
