==================================================

To solve the problem, we will break it down into steps to determine how much James was out of pocket after selling his old car and purchasing a new one.

### Step 1: Calculate the selling price of the old car

James sold his car, which had a sticker price of $20,000, for 80% of its value. We can calculate the selling price as follows:

\[
\text{Selling Price} = \text{Original Value} \times \text{Percentage Sold}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\text{Selling Price} = 20,000 \times 0.80 = 16,000
\]

So, James sold his old car for **$16,000**.

### Step 2: Calculate the purchase price of the new car

James wants to buy a new car that has a sticker price of $30,000. He was able to haggle and buy it for 90% of its value. We can calculate the purchase price as follows:

\[
\text{Purchase Price} = \text{Sticker Price} \times \text{Percentage Paid}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\text{Purchase Price} = 30,000 \times 0.90 = 27,000
\]

So, James bought the new car for **$27,000**.

### Step 3: Calculate how much James was out of pocket

To find out how much James was out of pocket, we need to subtract the amount he received from selling his old car from the amount he spent on the new car:

\[
\text{Out of Pocket} = \text{Purchase Price} - \text{Selling Price}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\text{Out of Pocket} = 27,000 - 16,000 = 11,000
\]

### Final Answer

James was out of pocket **$11,000** after selling his old car and purchasing the new one.
