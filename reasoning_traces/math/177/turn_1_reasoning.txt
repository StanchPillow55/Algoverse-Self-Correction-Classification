==================================================

To determine how much James was out of pocket, we need to calculate the amount he received from selling his old car and the amount he paid for the new car. Then, we find the difference between these two amounts.

**Step 1: Calculate the selling price of James's old car.**

James sold his old car, which was valued at $20,000, for 80% of its value. To find the selling price, we calculate 80% of $20,000:

\[
\text{Selling Price of Old Car} = 0.80 \times 20,000 = 16,000
\]

So, James sold his old car for $16,000.

**Step 2: Calculate the purchase price of the new car.**

The new car had a sticker price of $30,000, but James was able to negotiate and buy it for 90% of its value. To find the purchase price, we calculate 90% of $30,000:

\[
\text{Purchase Price of New Car} = 0.90 \times 30,000 = 27,000
\]

So, James bought the new car for $27,000.

**Step 3: Determine how much James was out of pocket.**

To find out how much James was out of pocket, we subtract the amount he received from selling his old car from the amount he paid for the new car:

\[
\text{Out of Pocket} = \text{Purchase Price of New Car} - \text{Selling Price of Old Car}
\]

\[
\text{Out of Pocket} = 27,000 - 16,000 = 11,000
\]

**Final Answer:**

James was out of pocket by $11,000.
