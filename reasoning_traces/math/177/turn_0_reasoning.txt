To solve this problem, we need to calculate how much James received from selling his old car and how much he paid for the new car. Then, we will determine the difference to find out how much he was out of pocket.

### Step 1: Calculate the selling price of James's old car

James sold his car for 80% of its value. The original value of the car was $20,000.

\[
\text{Selling Price of Old Car} = 80\% \times 20,000
\]

Convert the percentage to a decimal:

\[
80\% = 0.80
\]

Now, calculate the selling price:

\[
\text{Selling Price of Old Car} = 0.80 \times 20,000 = 16,000
\]

James sold his old car for $16,000.

### Step 2: Calculate the purchase price of the new car

James bought a new car with a sticker price of $30,000 for 90% of its value.

\[
\text{Purchase Price of New Car} = 90\% \times 30,000
\]

Convert the percentage to a decimal:

\[
90\% = 0.90
\]

Now, calculate the purchase price:

\[
\text{Purchase Price of New Car} = 0.90 \times 30,000 = 27,000
\]

James bought the new car for $27,000.

### Step 3: Calculate how much James was out of pocket

To find out how much James was out of pocket, we subtract the amount he received from selling his old car from the amount he paid for the new car.

\[
\text{Out of Pocket} = \text{Purchase Price of New Car} - \text{Selling Price of Old Car}
\]

Substitute the values we calculated:

\[
\text{Out of Pocket} = 27,000 - 16,000 = 11,000
\]

### Final Answer

James was out of pocket by $11,000.
