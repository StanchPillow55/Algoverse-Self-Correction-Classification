To solve the problem, we need to calculate how much money James received from selling his car and how much he spent on the new car. Then, we will determine how much he was out of pocket.

### Step 1: Calculate the selling price of James's car.

James sold his car for 80% of its value. The value of his car is $20,000.

\[
\text{Selling Price} = 80\% \text{ of } 20,000 = 0.80 \times 20,000
\]

Calculating this:

\[
0.80 \times 20,000 = 16,000
\]

So, James received **$16,000** from selling his car.

### Step 2: Calculate the purchase price of the new car.

James bought a new car with a sticker price of $30,000 for 90% of its value.

\[
\text{Purchase Price} = 90\% \text{ of } 30,000 = 0.90 \times 30,000
\]

Calculating this:

\[
0.90 \times 30,000 = 27,000
\]

So, the purchase price of the new car is **$27,000**.

### Step 3: Calculate how much James was out of pocket.

To find out how much James was out of pocket, we subtract the amount he received from selling his old car from the amount he spent on the new car.

\[
\text{Out of Pocket} = \text{Purchase Price} - \text{Selling Price}
\]

Substituting the values we calculated:

\[
\text{Out of Pocket} = 27,000 - 16,000
\]

Calculating this:

\[
27,000 - 16,000 = 11,000
\]

### Final Answer

James was out of pocket **$11,000**.
