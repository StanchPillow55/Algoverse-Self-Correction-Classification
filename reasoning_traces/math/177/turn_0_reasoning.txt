Question ID: 177
Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To find out how much money Zaid will have left after all his expenses and donations, we will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate Zaid's expenses on rent and car fuel.**
2. **Determine the remaining amount after these expenses.**
3. **Calculate the donation to charity.**
4. **Subtract the amounts given to his daughter and wife.**
5. **Find the final amount left.**

### Step 1: Calculate Rent and Car Fuel Expenses

Zaid's monthly salary is \(6000\) dollars.

- **Rent Expense:**
  \[
  \text{Rent} = \frac{1}{4} \times 6000 = 1500 \text{ dollars}
  \]

- **Car Fuel Expense:**
  \[
  \text{Car Fuel} = \frac{1}{3} \times 6000 = 2000 \text{ dollars}
  \]

### Step 2: Calculate Remaining Amount After Rent and Car Fuel

Now, we will subtract the rent and car fuel expenses from Zaid's salary to find the remaining amount.

\[
\text{Remaining Amount} = 6000 - 1500 - 2000
\]
\[
\text{Remaining Amount} = 6000 - 3500 = 2500 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate Donation to Charity

Zaid donates half of the remaining amount to charity.

\[
\text{Donation to Charity} = \frac{1}{2} \times 2500 = 1250 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Step 4: Subtract Amounts Given to Daughter and Wife

Next, we will subtract the amounts given to his daughter and wife from the remaining amount after the charity donation.

- Amount given to daughter: \(200\) dollars
- Amount given to wife: \(700\) dollars

Total amount given away:
\[
\text{Total Given} = 200 + 700 = 900 \text{ dollars}
\]

Now, we will subtract this total from the remaining amount after the charity donation:

\[
\text{Final Amount} = 2500 - 1250 - 900
\]
\[
\text{Final Amount} = 2500 - 2150 = 350 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Final Answer

After all expenses and donations, Zaid will have **350 dollars** left.
