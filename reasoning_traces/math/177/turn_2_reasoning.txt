Question ID: 177
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to calculate how much money James received from selling his car and how much he spent on the new car. Then, we will determine how much he was out of pocket.

### Step 1: Calculate the selling price of James's old car

James sold his car for 80% of its value. The value of his car is $20,000.

\[
\text{Selling Price} = \text{Value of Car} \times \text{Percentage Sold}
\]
\[
\text{Selling Price} = 20,000 \times 0.80
\]
\[
\text{Selling Price} = 16,000
\]

So, James received **$16,000** from selling his old car.

### Step 2: Calculate the purchase price of the new car

James bought a new car with a sticker price of $30,000 for 90% of its value.

\[
\text{Purchase Price} = \text{Sticker Price} \times \text{Percentage Paid}
\]
\[
\text{Purchase Price} = 30,000 \times 0.90
\]
\[
\text{Purchase Price} = 27,000
\]

So, James spent **$27,000** on the new car.

### Step 3: Calculate how much James was out of pocket

To find out how much James was out of pocket, we need to subtract the amount he received from selling his old car from the amount he spent on the new car.

\[
\text{Out of Pocket} = \text{Purchase Price} - \text{Selling Price}
\]
\[
\text{Out of Pocket} = 27,000 - 16,000
\]
\[
\text{Out of Pocket} = 11,000
\]

### Final Answer

James was out of pocket **$11,000**.
