==================================================

To determine how much James was out of pocket when replacing his car, we need to calculate the amount he received from selling his old car and the amount he paid for the new car. Then, we find the difference between these two amounts.

**Step 1: Calculate the selling price of James's old car.**

James sold his old car, which was valued at $20,000, for 80% of its value. To find the selling price, we calculate 80% of $20,000:

\[
\text{Selling Price} = 0.80 \times 20,000 = 16,000
\]

James received $16,000 from selling his old car.

**Step 2: Calculate the purchase price of the new car.**

The sticker price of the new car was $30,000, but James was able to negotiate and buy it for 90% of its sticker price. To find the purchase price, we calculate 90% of $30,000:

\[
\text{Purchase Price} = 0.90 \times 30,000 = 27,000
\]

James paid $27,000 for the new car.

**Step 3: Calculate the out-of-pocket expense.**

To find out how much James was out of pocket, we subtract the amount he received from selling his old car from the amount he paid for the new car:

\[
\text{Out of Pocket} = \text{Purchase Price} - \text{Selling Price} = 27,000 - 16,000 = 11,000
\]

James was out of pocket $11,000.

**Final Answer:**

James was out of pocket $11,000 when he replaced his car.
