To find Conner's average speed while riding his dune buggy, we first need to determine the speeds for each type of terrain based on the information provided.

1. **Flat Sand Speed**: 
   - Speed on flat sand = 60 miles per hour.

2. **Downhill Speed**: 
   - Speed on downhill slopes = Speed on flat sand + 12 miles per hour.
   - Therefore, Speed on downhill slopes = 60 + 12 = 72 miles per hour.

3. **Uphill Speed**: 
   - Speed on uphill slopes = Speed on flat sand - 18 miles per hour.
   - Therefore, Speed on uphill slopes = 60 - 18 = 42 miles per hour.

Now we have the speeds for each type of terrain:
- Flat Sand: 60 mph
- Downhill: 72 mph
- Uphill: 42 mph

Next, we need to calculate the average speed based on the time spent on each type of terrain. Since Conner rides one-third of the time on each type, we can assume he rides for a total time of \( T \) hours. 

- Time spent on flat sand = \( \frac{T}{3} \)
- Time spent on downhill slopes = \( \frac{T}{3} \)
- Time spent on uphill slopes = \( \frac{T}{3} \)

Now we can calculate the distance traveled on each type of terrain using the formula:
\[
\text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time}
\]

4. **Distance on Flat Sand**:
\[
\text{Distance on flat sand} = 60 \times \frac{T}{3} = 20T \text{ miles}
\]

5. **Distance on Downhill Slopes**:
\[
\text{Distance on downhill} = 72 \times \frac{T}{3} = 24T \text{ miles}
\]

6. **Distance on Uphill Slopes**:
\[
\text{Distance on uphill} = 42 \times \frac{T}{3} = 14T \text{ miles}
\]

Now, we can find the total distance traveled:
\[
\text{Total Distance} = \text{Distance on flat sand} + \text{Distance on downhill} + \text{Distance on uphill}
\]
\[
\text{Total Distance} = 20T + 24T + 14T = 58T \text{ miles}
\]

Next, we need to find the total time, which is simply \( T \) since we assumed he rides for \( T \) hours.

Finally, we can calculate the average speed using the formula:
\[
\text{Average Speed} = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Total Time}}
\]
\[
\text{Average Speed} = \frac{58T}{T} = 58 \text{ miles per hour}
\]

Thus, Conner's average speed while riding his dune buggy is:

\[
\boxed{58} \text{ miles per hour}
\]
