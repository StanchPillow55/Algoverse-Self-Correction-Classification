==================================================

To solve a problem effectively, it's important to first understand what the problem is asking. However, the problem statement "Sample reasoning question 20" is quite vague and doesn't provide specific details or context. Without additional information, it's challenging to provide a precise solution. However, I can guide you through a general approach to solving math problems, which you can apply to a specific problem once you have more details.

### General Approach to Solving Math Problems

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - Read the problem carefully.
   - Identify what is being asked.
   - Determine what information is given and what needs to be found.

2. **Devise a Plan:**
   - Consider possible strategies to solve the problem. This could include drawing a diagram, creating an equation, or breaking the problem into smaller parts.
   - Choose the most appropriate method based on the problem type (e.g., algebraic, geometric, statistical).

3. **Carry Out the Plan:**
   - Execute the chosen strategy step by step.
   - Perform calculations carefully, showing all work to avoid mistakes.
   - Keep track of units and ensure consistency throughout the calculations.

4. **Review/Check the Solution:**
   - Verify that the solution answers the question posed by the problem.
   - Check calculations for accuracy.
   - Consider whether the solution is reasonable and makes sense in the context of the problem.

5. **State the Final Answer:**
   - Clearly present the final answer, ensuring it is in the correct form and includes appropriate units if necessary.

### Example Problem and Solution

Since the original problem is unspecified, let's consider a simple example problem:

**Example Problem:**
Solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).

**Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We need to find the value of \( x \) that satisfies the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).

2. **Devise a Plan:**
   - We can solve this linear equation by isolating \( x \).

3. **Carry Out the Plan:**
   - Start by subtracting 3 from both sides of the equation:
     \[
     2x + 3 - 3 = 11 - 3
     \]
     \[
     2x = 8
     \]
   - Next, divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( x \):
     \[
     \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{8}{2}
     \]
     \[
     x = 4
     \]

4. **Review/Check the Solution:**
   - Substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation to verify:
     \[
     2(4) + 3 = 8 + 3 = 11
     \]
   - The left side equals the right side, confirming our solution is correct.

5. **State the Final Answer:**
   - The solution to the equation is \( x = 4 \).
