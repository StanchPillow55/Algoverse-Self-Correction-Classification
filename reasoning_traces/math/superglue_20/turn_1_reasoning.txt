==================================================

To solve the problem, let's first clarify what "Sample reasoning question 20" might entail. Since the problem is not explicitly stated, I'll create a hypothetical reasoning problem and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**

A company produces two types of widgets: Type A and Type B. The company can produce a maximum of 100 widgets per day. The profit from selling one Type A widget is $5, and the profit from selling one Type B widget is $8. The company wants to maximize its profit, but it must produce at least 20 Type A widgets and at least 10 Type B widgets each day. How many of each type of widget should the company produce to maximize its profit?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( x \) be the number of Type A widgets produced.
   - Let \( y \) be the number of Type B widgets produced.

2. **Set Up Constraints:**
   - The total production constraint: \( x + y \leq 100 \).
   - The minimum production constraints: \( x \geq 20 \) and \( y \geq 10 \).

3. **Objective Function:**
   - The profit function to maximize is \( P = 5x + 8y \).

4. **Graph the Constraints:**
   - Plot the line \( x + y = 100 \).
   - The region below this line represents \( x + y \leq 100 \).
   - Plot the vertical line \( x = 20 \).
   - The region to the right of this line represents \( x \geq 20 \).
   - Plot the horizontal line \( y = 10 \).
   - The region above this line represents \( y \geq 10 \).

5. **Identify the Feasible Region:**
   - The feasible region is the area where all constraints overlap. It is bounded by the lines \( x + y = 100 \), \( x = 20 \), and \( y = 10 \).

6. **Find the Corner Points:**
   - The corner points of the feasible region are found by solving the system of equations formed by the intersection of the constraint lines:
     - Intersection of \( x + y = 100 \) and \( x = 20 \): \( (20, 80) \).
     - Intersection of \( x + y = 100 \) and \( y = 10 \): \( (90, 10) \).
     - Intersection of \( x = 20 \) and \( y = 10 \): \( (20, 10) \).

7. **Evaluate the Objective Function at Each Corner Point:**
   - At \( (20, 80) \): \( P = 5(20) + 8(80) = 100 + 640 = 740 \).
   - At \( (90, 10) \): \( P = 5(90) + 8(10) = 450 + 80 = 530 \).
   - At \( (20, 10) \): \( P = 5(20) + 8(10) = 100 + 80 = 180 \).

8. **Determine the Maximum Profit:**
   - The maximum profit is \( 740 \), which occurs at the point \( (20, 80) \).

**Final Answer:**
To maximize profit, the company should produce 20 Type A widgets and 80 Type B widgets per day. The maximum profit is $740.
