Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample math problem 227" refers to. Since the problem itself is not explicitly stated, I'll assume it's a placeholder for a typical math problem. For demonstration purposes, let's consider a common type of math problem: solving a quadratic equation.

Let's assume "Sample math problem 227" is the quadratic equation:

\[ x^2 - 5x + 6 = 0 \]

We need to solve for \( x \).

### Step 1: Identify the coefficients

The standard form of a quadratic equation is:

\[ ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \]

For our equation, \( a = 1 \), \( b = -5 \), and \( c = 6 \).

### Step 2: Use the quadratic formula

The quadratic formula is:

\[ x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \]

Substitute the values of \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \) into the formula:

\[ x = \frac{-(-5) \pm \sqrt{(-5)^2 - 4 \cdot 1 \cdot 6}}{2 \cdot 1} \]

### Step 3: Simplify the expression

First, calculate the discriminant (\( b^2 - 4ac \)):

\[ (-5)^2 = 25 \]
\[ 4 \cdot 1 \cdot 6 = 24 \]
\[ b^2 - 4ac = 25 - 24 = 1 \]

Now substitute back into the quadratic formula:

\[ x = \frac{5 \pm \sqrt{1}}{2} \]

### Step 4: Solve for \( x \)

Since \(\sqrt{1} = 1\), the equation becomes:

\[ x = \frac{5 \pm 1}{2} \]

This gives us two possible solutions:

1. \( x = \frac{5 + 1}{2} = \frac{6}{2} = 3 \)
2. \( x = \frac{5 - 1}{2} = \frac{4}{2} = 2 \)

### Conclusion

The solutions to the quadratic equation \( x^2 - 5x + 6 = 0 \) are \( x = 3 \) and \( x = 2 \).

**Final Answer:**

\( x = 3 \) and \( x = 2 \)
