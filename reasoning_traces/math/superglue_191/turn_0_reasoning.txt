==================================================

To solve the problem, I need more specific information about "Sample reasoning question 191." Since the question itself is not provided, I'll demonstrate how to approach a typical math problem step-by-step. Let's assume a sample math problem and solve it.

**Sample Problem:**

Calculate the area of a triangle with a base of 10 units and a height of 5 units.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We need to find the area of a triangle.
   - We are given the base \( b = 10 \) units and the height \( h = 5 \) units.

2. **Recall the Formula for the Area of a Triangle:**
   \[
   \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height}
   \]

3. **Substitute the Given Values into the Formula:**
   \[
   \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times 10 \times 5
   \]

4. **Perform the Multiplication:**
   - First, multiply the base and the height:
     \[
     10 \times 5 = 50
     \]
   - Then, multiply by \(\frac{1}{2}\):
     \[
     \frac{1}{2} \times 50 = 25
     \]

5. **State the Final Answer:**
   - The area of the triangle is 25 square units.

This is a complete solution to the sample problem. If you have a specific question or problem number 191, please provide the details, and I will work through that problem specifically.
