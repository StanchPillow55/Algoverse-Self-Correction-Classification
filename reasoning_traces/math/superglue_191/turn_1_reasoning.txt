==================================================

To solve the problem, we first need to understand what "Sample reasoning question 191" entails. Since the problem statement does not provide specific details about the question, I'll demonstrate a general approach to solving a typical math reasoning problem. Let's assume a hypothetical problem and work through it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**
A train travels from City A to City B, a distance of 300 miles, at a constant speed. If the train increases its speed by 10 miles per hour, it would take 1 hour less to complete the journey. What is the original speed of the train?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( v \) be the original speed of the train in miles per hour.
   - The time taken to travel from City A to City B at speed \( v \) is \( \frac{300}{v} \) hours.

2. **Increased Speed Scenario:**
   - If the speed is increased by 10 mph, the new speed is \( v + 10 \).
   - The time taken at the increased speed is \( \frac{300}{v + 10} \) hours.

3. **Set Up the Equation:**
   - According to the problem, the journey takes 1 hour less at the increased speed:
   \[
   \frac{300}{v} = \frac{300}{v + 10} + 1
   \]

4. **Solve the Equation:**
   - Clear the fractions by multiplying through by \( v(v + 10) \):
   \[
   300(v + 10) = 300v + v(v + 10)
   \]
   - Simplify and expand:
   \[
   300v + 3000 = 300v + v^2 + 10v
   \]
   - Rearrange the terms:
   \[
   v^2 + 10v - 3000 = 0
   \]

5. **Solve the Quadratic Equation:**
   - Use the quadratic formula \( v = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \), where \( a = 1 \), \( b = 10 \), and \( c = -3000 \):
   \[
   v = \frac{-10 \pm \sqrt{10^2 - 4 \times 1 \times (-3000)}}{2 \times 1}
   \]
   \[
   v = \frac{-10 \pm \sqrt{100 + 12000}}{2}
   \]
   \[
   v = \frac{-10 \pm \sqrt{12100}}{2}
   \]
   \[
   v = \frac{-10 \pm 110}{2}
   \]

6. **Calculate the Possible Values for \( v \):**
   - \( v = \frac{-10 + 110}{2} = \frac{100}{2} = 50 \)
   - \( v = \frac{-10 - 110}{2} = \frac{-120}{2} = -60 \) (not feasible as speed cannot be negative)

7. **Conclusion:**
   - The original speed of the train is \( 50 \) miles per hour.

**Final Answer:**
The original speed of the train is 50 miles per hour.
