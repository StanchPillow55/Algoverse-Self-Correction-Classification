==================================================

To solve the problem effectively, let's first clarify the task. The question presented is "Sample reasoning question 191," which is not a typical math problem statement. It seems to be a placeholder or reference to a specific problem that is not fully described here. 

Since the problem is not explicitly stated, I'll demonstrate how to approach a generic math problem by creating a sample problem and solving it step by step. Let's assume a problem involving algebra:

**Sample Problem:**
Solve for \( x \) in the equation: 
\[ 3x + 5 = 20 \]

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Equation:**
   The equation \( 3x + 5 = 20 \) is a linear equation in one variable, \( x \). The goal is to isolate \( x \) on one side of the equation to find its value.

2. **Isolate the Variable:**
   To isolate \( x \), we need to perform operations that will leave \( x \) alone on one side of the equation.

3. **Subtract 5 from Both Sides:**
   Start by eliminating the constant term on the left side of the equation.
   \[
   3x + 5 - 5 = 20 - 5
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   3x = 15
   \]

4. **Divide Both Sides by 3:**
   To solve for \( x \), divide both sides of the equation by 3.
   \[
   \frac{3x}{3} = \frac{15}{3}
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   x = 5
   \]

5. **Verify the Solution:**
   Substitute \( x = 5 \) back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies the equation.
   \[
   3(5) + 5 = 20
   \]
   Simplifying the left side:
   \[
   15 + 5 = 20
   \]
   \[
   20 = 20
   \]
   The left side equals the right side, confirming that \( x = 5 \) is the correct solution.

**Final Answer:**
The solution to the equation \( 3x + 5 = 20 \) is \( x = 5 \).

This step-by-step approach can be applied to a wide range of algebraic problems, ensuring clarity and accuracy in solving equations. If you have a specific problem or additional details, please provide them for a more tailored solution.
