==================================================

To solve the problem effectively, I need to first understand the context and details of "Sample reasoning question 191." However, since the problem statement is not provided, I'll demonstrate a general approach to solving a typical math reasoning problem. Let's assume a sample problem for illustration:

**Sample Problem:**
A train travels from City A to City B at a speed of 60 km/h. On the return trip from City B to City A, the train travels at a speed of 90 km/h. If the total travel time for the round trip is 5 hours, what is the distance between City A and City B?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( d \) be the distance between City A and City B in kilometers.

2. **Determine Time for Each Leg of the Trip:**
   - The time taken to travel from City A to City B is given by the formula:
     \[
     \text{Time from A to B} = \frac{d}{60} \text{ hours}
     \]
   - The time taken to travel from City B to City A is given by the formula:
     \[
     \text{Time from B to A} = \frac{d}{90} \text{ hours}
     \]

3. **Set Up the Equation for Total Travel Time:**
   - The total travel time for the round trip is 5 hours. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
     \[
     \frac{d}{60} + \frac{d}{90} = 5
     \]

4. **Solve the Equation:**
   - To solve the equation, find a common denominator for the fractions. The least common multiple of 60 and 90 is 180. Rewrite the equation with this common denominator:
     \[
     \frac{3d}{180} + \frac{2d}{180} = 5
     \]
   - Combine the fractions:
     \[
     \frac{5d}{180} = 5
     \]
   - Multiply both sides by 180 to clear the fraction:
     \[
     5d = 900
     \]
   - Divide both sides by 5 to solve for \( d \):
     \[
     d = 180
     \]

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The distance between City A and City B is 180 kilometers.

**Final Answer:**
The distance between City A and City B is 180 kilometers.
