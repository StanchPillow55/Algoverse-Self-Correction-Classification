Question ID: superglue_191
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 191" refers to. Unfortunately, without additional context or specific details about the problem, it is impossible to directly address it. However, I can guide you through a general approach to solving a reasoning problem, which you can apply once you have the specific details of the question.

### General Approach to Solving a Reasoning Problem

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - Carefully read the problem statement.
   - Identify what is being asked.
   - Note any specific conditions or constraints.

2. **Break Down the Problem:**
   - Divide the problem into smaller, manageable parts.
   - Identify any patterns or relationships between different parts of the problem.

3. **Develop a Strategy:**
   - Consider different approaches to solving the problem.
   - Choose the most efficient method based on the given information.

4. **Execute the Plan:**
   - Carry out the calculations or logical reasoning step by step.
   - Keep track of your work to ensure accuracy.

5. **Review and Verify:**
   - Double-check your calculations and reasoning.
   - Ensure that your solution satisfies all conditions of the problem.

6. **State the Final Answer:**
   - Clearly present your final answer.
   - Include any necessary units or labels.

### Example Problem and Solution

Since we don't have the specifics of "Sample reasoning question 191," let's consider a generic example:

**Example Problem:**
A train travels from City A to City B, a distance of 300 miles, at a speed of 60 miles per hour. How long does the journey take?

**Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We need to find the time it takes for the train to travel 300 miles at 60 miles per hour.

2. **Break Down the Problem:**
   - Use the formula for time: \( \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \).

3. **Develop a Strategy:**
   - Plug the given values into the formula.

4. **Execute the Plan:**
   \[
   \text{Time} = \frac{300 \text{ miles}}{60 \text{ miles per hour}} = 5 \text{ hours}
   \]

5. **Review and Verify:**
   - Check the calculation: \( 60 \times 5 = 300 \), which matches the distance.

6. **State the Final Answer:**
   - The journey takes 5 hours.

### Conclusion

Once you have the specific details of "Sample reasoning question 191," you can apply this structured approach to solve it. If you provide more details or context, I can offer a more tailored solution.
