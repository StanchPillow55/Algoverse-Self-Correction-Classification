Question ID: 307
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine how many calories are remaining in the block of cheese after Rick has eaten 5 servings. Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Determine the total number of calories in the entire block of cheese:**

   - We know that there are 110 calories in one serving of cheese.
   - The block contains 16 servings.
   - To find the total calories in the block, multiply the number of servings by the calories per serving:
     \[
     \text{Total calories in the block} = 16 \text{ servings} \times 110 \text{ calories/serving} = 1760 \text{ calories}
     \]

2. **Calculate the number of calories Rick has consumed:**

   - Rick has eaten 5 servings of cheese.
   - To find the total calories he has consumed, multiply the number of servings he ate by the calories per serving:
     \[
     \text{Calories consumed by Rick} = 5 \text{ servings} \times 110 \text{ calories/serving} = 550 \text{ calories}
     \]

3. **Determine the number of calories remaining in the block:**

   - Subtract the calories Rick has consumed from the total calories in the block:
     \[
     \text{Calories remaining} = 1760 \text{ calories} - 550 \text{ calories} = 1210 \text{ calories}
     \]

Therefore, the number of calories remaining in the block of cheese is \( \boxed{1210} \).
