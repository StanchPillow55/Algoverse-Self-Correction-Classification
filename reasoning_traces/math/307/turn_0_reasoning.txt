To solve this problem, we need to determine how many calories are remaining in the block of cheese after Rick has eaten 5 servings.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Determine the Total Calories in the Block:**
   - Each serving of cheese contains 110 calories.
   - There are 16 servings in a block.
   - To find the total calories in the entire block, multiply the number of servings by the calories per serving:
     \[
     \text{Total Calories in Block} = 16 \text{ servings} \times 110 \text{ calories/serving} = 1760 \text{ calories}
     \]

2. **Calculate the Calories Consumed by Rick:**
   - Rick has eaten 5 servings.
   - Each serving contains 110 calories.
   - To find the total calories Rick has consumed, multiply the number of servings he ate by the calories per serving:
     \[
     \text{Calories Consumed by Rick} = 5 \text{ servings} \times 110 \text{ calories/serving} = 550 \text{ calories}
     \]

3. **Calculate the Remaining Calories in the Block:**
   - Subtract the calories consumed by Rick from the total calories in the block to find the remaining calories:
     \[
     \text{Remaining Calories} = 1760 \text{ calories} - 550 \text{ calories} = 1210 \text{ calories}
     \]

### Final Answer:
The number of calories remaining in the block of cheese is 1210 calories.
