To solve the problem, we need to determine how much weight Joey loses in one week and then find out how long it will take Sandy to lose the same amount of weight.

1. **Determine Joey's weekly weight loss:**
   Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks. To find out how much he loses in one week, we can divide the total weight loss by the number of weeks:

   \[
   \text{Joey's weekly weight loss} = \frac{8 \text{ pounds}}{4 \text{ weeks}} = 2 \text{ pounds/week}
   \]

2. **Determine how much weight Sandy wants to lose:**
   Sandy wants to lose the same amount of weight as Joey does in 4 weeks. Since Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks, Sandy also wants to lose 8 pounds.

3. **Determine Sandy's weight loss rate:**
   The problem states that Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in a single week. Since Joey loses 2 pounds in one week, Sandy will take 4 weeks to lose 2 pounds.

4. **Calculate Sandy's weight loss rate:**
   If Sandy loses 2 pounds in 4 weeks, we can find her weekly weight loss rate:

   \[
   \text{Sandy's weekly weight loss} = \frac{2 \text{ pounds}}{4 \text{ weeks}} = 0.5 \text{ pounds/week}
   \]

5. **Determine how many weeks it will take Sandy to lose 8 pounds:**
   Now we need to find out how many weeks it will take Sandy to lose 8 pounds at her rate of 0.5 pounds per week. We can use the formula:

   \[
   \text{Weeks required} = \frac{\text{Total weight to lose}}{\text{Weekly weight loss rate}} = \frac{8 \text{ pounds}}{0.5 \text{ pounds/week}} = 16 \text{ weeks}
   \]

Thus, it will take Sandy **16 weeks** to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in 4 weeks.

**Final Answer: 16 weeks**
