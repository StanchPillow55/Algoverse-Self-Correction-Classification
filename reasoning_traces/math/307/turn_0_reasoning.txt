==================================================

To solve the problem, we will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total calories in one block of cheese.**
2. **Determine how many calories Rick has consumed from the servings he has eaten.**
3. **Subtract the calories consumed from the total calories in the block to find the remaining calories.**

### Step 1: Calculate the total calories in one block of cheese

We know that:
- Each serving of cheese contains 110 calories.
- There are 16 servings in one block.

To find the total calories in one block, we multiply the number of servings by the calories per serving:

\[
\text{Total calories in one block} = \text{Number of servings} \times \text{Calories per serving}
\]

\[
\text{Total calories in one block} = 16 \times 110 = 1760 \text{ calories}
\]

### Step 2: Determine how many calories Rick has consumed

Rick has eaten 5 servings of cheese. We need to calculate the total calories he has consumed:

\[
\text{Calories consumed} = \text{Number of servings eaten} \times \text{Calories per serving}
\]

\[
\text{Calories consumed} = 5 \times 110 = 550 \text{ calories}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the remaining calories in the block

Now, we will subtract the calories consumed from the total calories in the block to find out how many calories are remaining:

\[
\text{Remaining calories} = \text{Total calories in one block} - \text{Calories consumed}
\]

\[
\text{Remaining calories} = 1760 - 550 = 1210 \text{ calories}
\]

### Final Answer

The number of calories remaining in the block is:

\[
\boxed{1210}
\]
