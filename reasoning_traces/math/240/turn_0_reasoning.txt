To determine how many more red bouncy balls than yellow bouncy balls Kate bought, we will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of red bouncy balls**:
   - Kate bought 7 packs of red bouncy balls.
   - Each pack contains 18 bouncy balls.
   - Therefore, the total number of red bouncy balls can be calculated as follows:
     \[
     \text{Total red bouncy balls} = \text{Number of packs} \times \text{Balls per pack} = 7 \times 18
     \]
   - Now, performing the multiplication:
     \[
     7 \times 18 = 126
     \]
   - So, Kate bought **126 red bouncy balls**.

2. **Calculate the total number of yellow bouncy balls**:
   - Kate bought 6 packs of yellow bouncy balls.
   - Each pack also contains 18 bouncy balls.
   - Therefore, the total number of yellow bouncy balls can be calculated as follows:
     \[
     \text{Total yellow bouncy balls} = \text{Number of packs} \times \text{Balls per pack} = 6 \times 18
     \]
   - Now, performing the multiplication:
     \[
     6 \times 18 = 108
     \]
   - So, Kate bought **108 yellow bouncy balls**.

3. **Determine how many more red bouncy balls than yellow bouncy balls Kate bought**:
   - We need to find the difference between the number of red bouncy balls and yellow bouncy balls:
     \[
     \text{Difference} = \text{Total red bouncy balls} - \text{Total yellow bouncy balls} = 126 - 108
     \]
   - Now, performing the subtraction:
     \[
     126 - 108 = 18
     \]

Finally, the answer to the question is that Kate bought **18 more red bouncy balls than yellow bouncy balls**.
