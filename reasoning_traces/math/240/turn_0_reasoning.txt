To solve this problem, we need to determine how many more red bouncy balls Kate bought compared to yellow bouncy balls. We will do this by calculating the total number of red bouncy balls and the total number of yellow bouncy balls separately, and then finding the difference between the two totals.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Determine the number of red bouncy balls:**
   - Kate bought 7 packs of red bouncy balls.
   - Each pack contains 18 bouncy balls.
   - To find the total number of red bouncy balls, multiply the number of packs by the number of bouncy balls per pack:
     \[
     \text{Total red bouncy balls} = 7 \times 18
     \]

2. **Calculate the total for red bouncy balls:**
   \[
   7 \times 18 = 126
   \]
   So, Kate bought 126 red bouncy balls.

3. **Determine the number of yellow bouncy balls:**
   - Kate bought 6 packs of yellow bouncy balls.
   - Each pack contains 18 bouncy balls.
   - To find the total number of yellow bouncy balls, multiply the number of packs by the number of bouncy balls per pack:
     \[
     \text{Total yellow bouncy balls} = 6 \times 18
     \]

4. **Calculate the total for yellow bouncy balls:**
   \[
   6 \times 18 = 108
   \]
   So, Kate bought 108 yellow bouncy balls.

5. **Find the difference between the number of red and yellow bouncy balls:**
   - Subtract the total number of yellow bouncy balls from the total number of red bouncy balls:
     \[
     \text{Difference} = 126 - 108
     \]

6. **Calculate the difference:**
   \[
   126 - 108 = 18
   \]

### Final Answer:
Kate bought 18 more red bouncy balls than yellow bouncy balls.
