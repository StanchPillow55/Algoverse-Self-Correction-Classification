==================================================

To solve the problem, we will define the number of candies each person has in terms of Robert's candies and then calculate the differences.

1. **Define Variables**:
   - Let \( R \) be the number of candies Robert has.
   - According to the problem, James has 6 more candies than Robert, so we can express the number of candies James has as:
     \[
     J = R + 6
     \]
   - John has twice as many candies as Robert, so we can express the number of candies John has as:
     \[
     Jn = 2R
     \]

2. **Given Information**:
   - We know from the problem that John has 54 candies:
     \[
     Jn = 54
     \]

3. **Set Up the Equation**:
   - Since we have \( Jn = 2R \), we can set up the equation:
     \[
     2R = 54
     \]

4. **Solve for Robert's Candies**:
   - To find \( R \), we divide both sides of the equation by 2:
     \[
     R = \frac{54}{2} = 27
     \]

5. **Calculate James's Candies**:
   - Now that we know \( R \), we can find the number of candies James has:
     \[
     J = R + 6 = 27 + 6 = 33
     \]

6. **Calculate the Difference Between John and James**:
   - We need to find out how many more candies John has than James:
     \[
     \text{Difference} = Jn - J = 54 - 33
     \]
   - Performing the subtraction:
     \[
     \text{Difference} = 21
     \]

7. **Final Answer**:
   - Therefore, John has 21 more candies than James.

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{21}
\]
