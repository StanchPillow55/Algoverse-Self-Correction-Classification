==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 471," we need to first understand what the problem is asking. However, the problem statement is incomplete as it only says "Sample math problem 471" without providing any specific details or context. Therefore, I will assume this is a placeholder for a typical math problem and create a hypothetical problem to solve.

Let's assume "Sample math problem 471" is a problem involving solving a quadratic equation. Here's a hypothetical problem:

**Problem:** Solve the quadratic equation \(2x^2 - 4x - 6 = 0\).

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Identify the quadratic equation:**
   The given equation is \(2x^2 - 4x - 6 = 0\).

2. **Simplify the equation (if possible):**
   First, check if the equation can be simplified by dividing all terms by a common factor. In this case, all terms are divisible by 2:
   \[
   \frac{2x^2}{2} - \frac{4x}{2} - \frac{6}{2} = 0 \implies x^2 - 2x - 3 = 0
   \]

3. **Factor the quadratic equation:**
   We need to factor the quadratic expression \(x^2 - 2x - 3\). We are looking for two numbers that multiply to \(-3\) (the constant term) and add to \(-2\) (the coefficient of the linear term).

   The numbers \(-3\) and \(1\) satisfy these conditions because:
   \[
   (-3) \times 1 = -3 \quad \text{and} \quad (-3) + 1 = -2
   \]

   Therefore, the factored form of the quadratic is:
   \[
   (x - 3)(x + 1) = 0
   \]

4. **Solve for the roots:**
   Set each factor equal to zero and solve for \(x\):
   \[
   x - 3 = 0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad x = 3
   \]
   \[
   x + 1 = 0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad x = -1
   \]

5. **State the final answer:**
   The solutions to the quadratic equation \(2x^2 - 4x - 6 = 0\) are \(x = 3\) and \(x = -1\).

Therefore, the final answer is:
\[ x = 3 \quad \text{and} \quad x = -1 \]
