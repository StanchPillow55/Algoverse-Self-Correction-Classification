==================================================

To solve the problem labeled "Sample math problem 471," we need to first understand what the problem is asking. However, since the problem statement is not provided, I'll demonstrate a general approach to solving a typical math problem by creating a sample problem and solving it step by step.

Let's assume the problem is as follows:

**Sample Math Problem 471:**
Solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 3x + 5 = 20 \).

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   The equation given is \( 3x + 5 = 20 \). We need to solve for \( x \), which means finding the value of \( x \) that makes this equation true.

2. **Isolate the Variable:**
   To solve for \( x \), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We can start by getting rid of the constant term on the left side, which is 5.

   \[
   3x + 5 = 20
   \]

   Subtract 5 from both sides to eliminate the constant:

   \[
   3x + 5 - 5 = 20 - 5
   \]

   Simplifying both sides gives:

   \[
   3x = 15
   \]

3. **Solve for \( x \):**
   Now, we need to solve for \( x \) by getting rid of the coefficient of \( x \), which is 3. We do this by dividing both sides of the equation by 3.

   \[
   \frac{3x}{3} = \frac{15}{3}
   \]

   Simplifying both sides gives:

   \[
   x = 5
   \]

4. **Verify the Solution:**
   It's always a good idea to verify the solution by substituting it back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies the equation.

   Substitute \( x = 5 \) back into the original equation:

   \[
   3(5) + 5 = 20
   \]

   Simplifying the left side:

   \[
   15 + 5 = 20
   \]

   \[
   20 = 20
   \]

   Since both sides of the equation are equal, our solution is verified.

### Final Answer:
The solution to the equation \( 3x + 5 = 20 \) is \( x = 5 \).
