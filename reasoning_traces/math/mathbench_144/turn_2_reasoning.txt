==================================================

Certainly! Let's tackle the problem step by step. The problem statement is "Sample math problem 144." Since the problem is not explicitly stated, I'll assume it involves the number 144 and explore a few common mathematical problems related to it. 

### Problem 1: Find the Square Root of 144

**Step 1: Understanding the Problem**

The problem could be asking for the square root of 144. The square root of a number \( x \) is a number \( y \) such that \( y^2 = x \).

**Step 2: Calculation**

We need to find a number \( y \) such that \( y^2 = 144 \).

- Start with some guesses:
  - \( 10^2 = 100 \) (too low)
  - \( 12^2 = 144 \) (exactly right)

Thus, the square root of 144 is 12.

**Step 3: Verification**

Verify by squaring 12:
\[ 12 \times 12 = 144 \]

The calculation confirms that the square root of 144 is indeed 12.

### Problem 2: Factorize 144

**Step 1: Understanding the Problem**

Another common problem could be to factorize 144 into its prime factors.

**Step 2: Calculation**

Start by dividing 144 by the smallest prime number, 2:

\[ 144 \div 2 = 72 \]

Continue factoring 72:

\[ 72 \div 2 = 36 \]

Continue factoring 36:

\[ 36 \div 2 = 18 \]

Continue factoring 18:

\[ 18 \div 2 = 9 \]

Now, 9 is not divisible by 2, so move to the next prime number, 3:

\[ 9 \div 3 = 3 \]

Finally, divide 3 by itself:

\[ 3 \div 3 = 1 \]

So, the prime factorization of 144 is:
\[ 144 = 2^4 \times 3^2 \]

**Step 3: Verification**

Verify by multiplying the factors back together:
\[ 2^4 = 16 \]
\[ 3^2 = 9 \]
\[ 16 \times 9 = 144 \]

The factorization is correct.

### Final Answer

The square root of 144 is 12, and its prime factorization is \( 2^4 \times 3^2 \).

If you have a specific problem involving the number 144, please provide more details, and I can address that particular problem.
