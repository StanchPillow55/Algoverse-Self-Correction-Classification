==================================================

It seems like you have provided a phrase "Sample math problem 144" without specifying the actual math problem you want to solve. The number 144 could refer to a specific problem number in a textbook or a set of problems, or it could be a part of a mathematical expression or question. 

However, if you are referring to the number 144 itself and want to explore mathematical properties or solve a problem related to it, I can provide some insights. Let's explore some mathematical aspects of the number 144:

### Properties of 144

1. **Square Number**: 
   - 144 is a perfect square. It can be expressed as \( 12^2 \).
   - Calculation: \( 12 \times 12 = 144 \).

2. **Prime Factorization**:
   - To find the prime factorization of 144, we can divide it by the smallest prime number, 2, and continue the process:
     \[
     144 \div 2 = 72 \\
     72 \div 2 = 36 \\
     36 \div 2 = 18 \\
     18 \div 2 = 9 \\
     9 \div 3 = 3 \\
     3 \div 3 = 1
     \]
   - Therefore, the prime factorization of 144 is \( 2^4 \times 3^2 \).

3. **Divisors**:
   - Using the prime factorization \( 2^4 \times 3^2 \), we can find the number of divisors by adding 1 to each of the exponents and multiplying:
     \[
     (4+1)(2+1) = 5 \times 3 = 15
     \]
   - The divisors of 144 are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 12, 16, 18, 24, 36, 48, 72, 144.

4. **Sum of Divisors**:
   - The sum of the divisors can be calculated using the formula for the sum of divisors based on its prime factorization:
     \[
     (1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + 16) \times (1 + 3 + 9) = 31 \times 13 = 403
     \]

5. **Other Properties**:
   - 144 is an even number.
   - It is part of the Fibonacci sequence, where it is the 12th Fibonacci number.
