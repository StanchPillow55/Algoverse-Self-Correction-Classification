==================================================

To solve the sample math problem "144," we need to first understand what is being asked. Since the problem simply states "144," it is likely that we are being asked to perform some mathematical operation or analysis on the number 144. Common operations or analyses that could be performed on a number include finding its square root, determining its factors, or expressing it in a different form (such as a power or a product of prime numbers).

Let's explore a few possibilities:

1. **Square Root of 144:**
   The square root of a number \( n \) is a value that, when multiplied by itself, gives \( n \). For 144, we are looking for a number \( x \) such that \( x \times x = 144 \).

   \[
   \sqrt{144} = 12
   \]

   This is because \( 12 \times 12 = 144 \).

2. **Prime Factorization of 144:**
   Prime factorization involves expressing a number as a product of its prime factors. Let's find the prime factors of 144.

   - Start with the smallest prime number, 2. Since 144 is even, it is divisible by 2.
     \[
     144 \div 2 = 72
     \]
   - 72 is also even, so divide by 2 again.
     \[
     72 \div 2 = 36
     \]
   - 36 is even, divide by 2 once more.
     \[
     36 \div 2 = 18
     \]
   - 18 is even, divide by 2 again.
     \[
     18 \div 2 = 9
     \]
   - 9 is not even, so we try the next smallest prime number, which is 3.
     \[
     9 \div 3 = 3
     \]
   - Finally, 3 is a prime number, and dividing by 3 gives:
     \[
     3 \div 3 = 1
     \]

   Therefore, the prime factorization of 144 is:
   \[
   144 = 2^4 \times 3^2
   \]

3. **Expressing 144 as a Power:**
   We can express 144 as a power of another number. Since we found that \( 144 = 12^2 \), we can express it as:
   \[
   144 = 12^2
   \]

4. **Factors of 144:**
   The factors of a number are all the integers that can divide the number without leaving a remainder. The factors of 144 can be found by considering its prime factorization \( 2^4 \times 3^2 \).

   The factors are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 12, 16, 18, 24, 36, 48, 72, and 144.

In summary, the number 144 can be analyzed in several ways. Here are the key results:

- The square root of 144 is 12.
- The prime factorization of 144 is \( 2^4 \times 3^2 \).
- 144 can be expressed as \( 12^2 \).
- The factors of 144 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 12, 16, 18, 24, 36, 48, 72, and 144.

If you intended a specific operation or analysis on the number 144, please provide more context or details.
