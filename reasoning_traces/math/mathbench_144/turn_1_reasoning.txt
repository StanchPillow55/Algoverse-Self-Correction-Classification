==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what is being asked. The problem statement is "Sample math problem 144." This is quite vague, but it seems to suggest that we need to work with the number 144 in some mathematical context. 

Let's explore a few possibilities:

1. **Square Root**: One of the most common mathematical operations associated with the number 144 is finding its square root. This is because 144 is a perfect square.

   \[
   \sqrt{144} = 12
   \]

   This is because \(12 \times 12 = 144\).

2. **Prime Factorization**: Another way to work with 144 is to find its prime factorization.

   - Start by dividing by the smallest prime number, which is 2.
     \[
     144 \div 2 = 72
     \]
   - Divide 72 by 2.
     \[
     72 \div 2 = 36
     \]
   - Divide 36 by 2.
     \[
     36 \div 2 = 18
     \]
   - Divide 18 by 2.
     \[
     18 \div 2 = 9
     \]
   - Now, divide 9 by the next smallest prime number, which is 3.
     \[
     9 \div 3 = 3
     \]
   - Finally, divide 3 by 3.
     \[
     3 \div 3 = 1
     \]

   So, the prime factorization of 144 is \(2^4 \times 3^2\).

3. **Properties of 144**: We can also explore some properties of the number 144.
   - It is an even number.
   - It is a composite number.
   - It is the 12th square number.

4. **Arithmetic Operations**: We could perform some basic arithmetic operations involving 144, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division, but without additional context, these operations would be arbitrary.

Given the lack of specific instructions, the most meaningful mathematical exploration of 144 is its square root and prime factorization.

**Final Answer**:
- The square root of 144 is 12.
- The prime factorization of 144 is \(2^4 \times 3^2\).
