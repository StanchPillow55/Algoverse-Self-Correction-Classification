Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 144," we need to first understand what the problem is asking. Since the problem is not explicitly stated, I'll assume that the task is to find the square root of 144, as this is a common mathematical operation associated with the number 144.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We are tasked with finding the square root of 144. The square root of a number \( x \) is a number \( y \) such that \( y^2 = x \).

2. **Identify the Operation:**
   - We need to find \( \sqrt{144} \).

3. **Calculate the Square Root:**
   - We know that \( 12 \times 12 = 144 \).
   - Therefore, \( \sqrt{144} = 12 \).

4. **Verify the Calculation:**
   - To ensure our calculation is correct, we can square 12 to see if we get back to 144:
     \[
     12^2 = 12 \times 12 = 144
     \]
   - Since \( 12^2 = 144 \), our calculation is verified.

5. **Consider the Negative Root:**
   - In mathematics, every positive number has two square roots: one positive and one negative. Therefore, \( \sqrt{144} \) could also be \(-12\) because:
     \[
     (-12) \times (-12) = 144
     \]
   - However, by convention, when we refer to the square root symbol \( \sqrt{} \), we typically mean the principal (non-negative) square root.

6. **Final Answer:**
   - The principal square root of 144 is 12.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{12}
\]
