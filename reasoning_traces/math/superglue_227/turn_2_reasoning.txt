Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, I need more specific information about "Sample reasoning question 227." Since the problem statement is not provided, I'll demonstrate how to approach a generic math problem by solving an example problem. Let's consider a typical algebra problem:

**Example Problem:**
Solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   We need to find the value of \( x \) that makes the equation true.

2. **Isolate the Variable:**
   To solve for \( x \), we need to get \( x \) by itself on one side of the equation. The equation is currently \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).

3. **Subtract 3 from Both Sides:**
   To begin isolating \( x \), we first eliminate the constant term on the left side by subtracting 3 from both sides of the equation:
   \[
   2x + 3 - 3 = 11 - 3
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   2x = 8
   \]

4. **Divide by 2:**
   Next, we divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( x \):
   \[
   \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{8}{2}
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   x = 4
   \]

5. **Verify the Solution:**
   Substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies the equation:
   \[
   2(4) + 3 = 11
   \]
   Simplifying the left side gives:
   \[
   8 + 3 = 11
   \]
   Since both sides of the equation are equal, our solution is verified.

**Final Answer:**
The solution to the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \) is \( x = 4 \).
