Question ID: superglue_227
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 227" entails. Since the problem statement is not explicitly provided, let's assume a generic math problem-solving approach and demonstrate the process step-by-step.

### Step 1: Understand the Problem
Since the problem is not specified, let's assume a typical math problem involving algebra, such as solving an equation. For example, let's solve the equation:

\[ 3x + 5 = 20 \]

### Step 2: Identify What is Being Asked
We need to find the value of \( x \) that satisfies the equation.

### Step 3: Plan a Solution
To solve for \( x \), we need to isolate \( x \) on one side of the equation. This involves performing inverse operations to simplify the equation.

### Step 4: Execute the Plan
1. **Subtract 5 from both sides**: This will help to eliminate the constant term on the left side of the equation.

   \[
   3x + 5 - 5 = 20 - 5
   \]

   Simplifying both sides gives:

   \[
   3x = 15
   \]

2. **Divide both sides by 3**: This will isolate \( x \) by removing the coefficient of \( x \).

   \[
   \frac{3x}{3} = \frac{15}{3}
   \]

   Simplifying both sides gives:

   \[
   x = 5
   \]

### Step 5: Verify the Solution
Substitute \( x = 5 \) back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies the equation:

\[ 
3(5) + 5 = 20 
\]

Calculating the left side:

\[ 
15 + 5 = 20 
\]

Since both sides of the equation are equal, our solution \( x = 5 \) is correct.

### Step 6: State the Final Answer
The solution to the equation \( 3x + 5 = 20 \) is \( x = 5 \).

This process demonstrates a typical approach to solving a basic algebraic equation. If "Sample reasoning question 227" refers to a different type of problem, please provide more details for a specific solution.
