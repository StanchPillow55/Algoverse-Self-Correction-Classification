==================================================

To solve the problem, we first need to understand what "Sample reasoning question 227" entails. Since the problem statement does not provide specific details about the question, I'll demonstrate a general approach to solving a typical math problem by breaking it down into steps. Let's assume a hypothetical math problem for demonstration purposes:

**Hypothetical Problem:**
Solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).

**Step 1: Understand the Problem**
The equation given is a simple linear equation in one variable, \( x \). Our goal is to find the value of \( x \) that makes the equation true.

**Step 2: Isolate the Variable**
To solve for \( x \), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We start by eliminating the constant term on the left side of the equation.

Given equation:
\[ 2x + 3 = 11 \]

Subtract 3 from both sides to remove the constant term:
\[ 2x + 3 - 3 = 11 - 3 \]

Simplify:
\[ 2x = 8 \]

**Step 3: Solve for the Variable**
Now that we have \( 2x = 8 \), we need to solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides by the coefficient of \( x \), which is 2.

Divide both sides by 2:
\[ \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{8}{2} \]

Simplify:
\[ x = 4 \]

**Step 4: Verify the Solution**
To ensure our solution is correct, we substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation and check if both sides are equal.

Substitute \( x = 4 \) into the original equation:
\[ 2(4) + 3 = 11 \]

Calculate:
\[ 8 + 3 = 11 \]

Since both sides of the equation are equal, our solution \( x = 4 \) is verified.

**Final Answer:**
The solution to the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \) is \( x = 4 \).

This step-by-step approach can be applied to various types of math problems by adjusting the steps according to the specific requirements of the problem. If you have a specific problem or question in mind, please provide more details so I can assist you accordingly.
