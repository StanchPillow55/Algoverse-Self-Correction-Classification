To determine how many windows Hannah smashes, we need to calculate the total number of windows for both the students' cars and the teachers' cars, and then apply the fractions given in the problem.

### Step 1: Calculate the total number of windows for students' cars.

- There are 64 students' cars.
- Each student’s car has 4 windows.

To find the total number of windows for students' cars, we multiply the number of cars by the number of windows per car:

\[
\text{Total windows for students' cars} = 64 \text{ cars} \times 4 \text{ windows/car} = 256 \text{ windows}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the total number of windows for teachers' cars.

- There are 32 teachers' cars.
- Each teacher’s car has 2 windows.

To find the total number of windows for teachers' cars, we multiply the number of cars by the number of windows per car:

\[
\text{Total windows for teachers' cars} = 32 \text{ cars} \times 2 \text{ windows/car} = 64 \text{ windows}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the total number of windows smashed by Hannah.

#### For students' cars:
Hannah smashes a quarter of the students' cars' windows. 

To find out how many windows she smashes from the students' cars, we calculate:

\[
\text{Windows smashed from students' cars} = \frac{1}{4} \times 256 \text{ windows} = 64 \text{ windows}
\]

#### For teachers' cars:
Hannah smashes three-quarters of the teachers' cars' windows.

To find out how many windows she smashes from the teachers' cars, we calculate:

\[
\text{Windows smashed from teachers' cars} = \frac{3}{4} \times 64 \text{ windows} = 48 \text{ windows}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the total number of windows smashed.

Now, we add the number of windows smashed from both students' and teachers' cars:

\[
\text{Total windows smashed} = 64 \text{ windows (students)} + 48 \text{ windows (teachers)} = 112 \text{ windows}
\]

### Final Answer:
Hannah smashes a total of **112 windows**.
