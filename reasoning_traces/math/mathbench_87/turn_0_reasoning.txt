==================================================

It seems like there might be some confusion with the phrase "Sample math problem 87." Without a specific math problem to solve, I can't provide a detailed solution. However, I can guide you through a generic approach to solving math problems. If you have a specific problem in mind, please provide the details, and I'll be happy to help.

Here's a general approach to solving math problems:

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - Read the problem carefully.
   - Identify what is being asked.
   - Determine what information is given and what needs to be found.

2. **Devise a Plan:**
   - Consider possible strategies to solve the problem, such as drawing a diagram, creating an equation, or breaking the problem into smaller parts.

3. **Carry Out the Plan:**
   - Execute the chosen strategy step by step.
   - Perform calculations carefully.
   - Keep track of units and ensure consistency.

4. **Check Your Work:**
   - Review each step to ensure accuracy.
   - Verify that the solution makes sense in the context of the problem.
   - Check calculations for errors.

5. **State the Final Answer:**
   - Clearly write the final answer, including units if applicable.

If you provide a specific math problem, I can apply this approach to solve it and show all the work and reasoning involved.
