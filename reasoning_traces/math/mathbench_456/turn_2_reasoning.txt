==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 456," let's first clarify what the problem entails. Since the problem statement is not specific, I'll assume it's a generic math problem involving the number 456. Let's explore a few potential problems that could involve this number and solve them step by step.

### Problem 1: Find the Sum of the Digits of 456

**Step 1: Identify the digits of the number 456.**

The number 456 consists of the digits 4, 5, and 6.

**Step 2: Add the digits together.**

\[
4 + 5 + 6 = 15
\]

**Reasoning:** Each digit represents a place value in the number, and adding them gives us the sum of the individual digits.

**Final Answer:** The sum of the digits of 456 is 15.

### Problem 2: Convert 456 to Binary

**Step 1: Divide the number by 2 and record the remainder.**

\[
456 \div 2 = 228 \quad \text{remainder} = 0
\]

**Step 2: Continue dividing the quotient by 2 until the quotient is 0, recording remainders.**

\[
228 \div 2 = 114 \quad \text{remainder} = 0
\]
\[
114 \div 2 = 57 \quad \text{remainder} = 0
\]
\[
57 \div 2 = 28 \quad \text{remainder} = 1
\]
\[
28 \div 2 = 14 \quad \text{remainder} = 0
\]
\[
14 \div 2 = 7 \quad \text{remainder} = 0
\]
\[
7 \div 2 = 3 \quad \text{remainder} = 1
\]
\[
3 \div 2 = 1 \quad \text{remainder} = 1
\]
\[
1 \div 2 = 0 \quad \text{remainder} = 1
\]

**Step 3: Write the binary number from the remainders, starting from the last remainder.**

The binary representation of 456 is \(111001000\).

**Reasoning:** Converting a decimal number to binary involves repeated division by 2 and recording the remainders, which represent the binary digits from least significant to most significant.

**Final Answer:** The binary representation of 456 is \(111001000\).

### Problem 3: Calculate 456 Squared

**Step 1: Multiply 456 by itself.**

\[
456 \times 456
\]

**Step 2: Break it down using the distributive property.**

\[
(400 + 50 + 6) \times (400 + 50 + 6)
\]

**Step 3: Calculate each component.**

\[
400 \times 400 = 160000
\]
\[
400 \times 50 = 20000
\]
\[
400 \times 6 = 2400
\]
\[
50 \times 50 = 2500
\]
\[
50 \times 6 = 300
\]
\[
6 \times 6 = 36
\]

**Step 4: Add all the components together.**

\[
160000 + 20000 + 2400 + 2500 + 300 + 36 = 207936
\]

**Reasoning:** Squaring a number involves multiplying it by itself, and using the distributive property helps break down the multiplication into manageable parts.

**Final Answer:** \(456^2 = 207936\).

These are a few examples of math problems involving the number 456. If you have a specific problem in mind, please provide more details, and I can solve that particular problem for you.
