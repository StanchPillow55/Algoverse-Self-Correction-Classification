To solve the problem labeled "Sample math problem 456," we need to first understand what the problem is asking. However, since the problem statement is not provided, I'll create a hypothetical math problem based on the number 456 and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**

"Find the sum of the digits of the number 456, and then multiply the result by 3. What is the final result?"

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Identify the digits of the number 456:**
   - The number 456 consists of the digits 4, 5, and 6.

2. **Calculate the sum of these digits:**
   - Sum = 4 + 5 + 6

3. **Perform the addition:**
   - 4 + 5 = 9
   - 9 + 6 = 15

   So, the sum of the digits is 15.

4. **Multiply the sum by 3:**
   - Result = 15 * 3

5. **Perform the multiplication:**
   - 15 * 3 = 45
