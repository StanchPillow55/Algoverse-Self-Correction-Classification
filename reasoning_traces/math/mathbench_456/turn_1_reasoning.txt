Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 456," let's first clarify what the problem entails. Since "Sample math problem 456" is not a standard or specific math problem, I'll assume it refers to a generic math problem labeled as "456." Without specific details, I'll create a hypothetical math problem using the number 456 and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**
Calculate the sum of the digits of the number 456, then multiply the result by 3.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Identify the digits of the number 456:**
   - The number 456 consists of three digits: 4, 5, and 6.

2. **Calculate the sum of the digits:**
   - Add the digits together: \(4 + 5 + 6\).
   - Perform the addition: 
     \[
     4 + 5 = 9
     \]
     \[
     9 + 6 = 15
     \]
   - The sum of the digits is 15.

3. **Multiply the sum by 3:**
   - Take the sum of the digits (15) and multiply it by 3:
     \[
     15 \times 3 = 45
     \]

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The final result after performing the calculations is 45.

Therefore, the answer to the hypothetical problem is 45.
