Question ID: mathbench_456
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 456," we need to first understand what the problem is asking. However, the problem statement "Sample math problem 456" is not specific and does not provide any details or context. Therefore, I will assume this is a placeholder for a specific math problem that you intended to provide.

Since there is no specific problem to solve, I will demonstrate how to solve a generic math problem involving basic arithmetic operations. Let's assume the problem is as follows:

**Problem:** Calculate the result of the expression: \( 456 + 123 - 78 \times 2 \).

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Order of Operations:**
   According to the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS), we need to perform multiplication and division before addition and subtraction. The acronym stands for:
   - Parentheses/Brackets
   - Exponents/Orders (such as squares and square roots, etc.)
   - Multiplication and Division (from left to right)
   - Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)

2. **Identify Operations:**
   In the expression \( 456 + 123 - 78 \times 2 \), we have addition, subtraction, and multiplication. We need to perform the multiplication first.

3. **Perform Multiplication:**
   Calculate \( 78 \times 2 \):
   \[
   78 \times 2 = 156
   \]

4. **Substitute Back into the Expression:**
   Replace \( 78 \times 2 \) with 156 in the original expression:
   \[
   456 + 123 - 156
   \]

5. **Perform Addition and Subtraction from Left to Right:**
   - First, perform the addition:
     \[
     456 + 123 = 579
     \]
   - Next, perform the subtraction:
     \[
     579 - 156 = 423
     \]

6. **Final Answer:**
   The result of the expression \( 456 + 123 - 78 \times 2 \) is \( 423 \).

Therefore, the final answer is \( 423 \).
