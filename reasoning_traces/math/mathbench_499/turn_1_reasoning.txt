==================================================

To solve "Sample math problem 499," we first need to understand what the problem entails. Since the problem statement is not explicitly given, I'll assume a hypothetical math problem and solve it step by step. Let's assume the problem is as follows:

**Problem:**  
Calculate the sum of all integers from 1 to 499.

**Solution:**

To find the sum of all integers from 1 to 499, we can use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series. The formula for the sum \( S \) of the first \( n \) integers is given by:

\[
S = \frac{n}{2} \times (a + l)
\]

where:
- \( n \) is the number of terms,
- \( a \) is the first term,
- \( l \) is the last term.

In this problem:
- The first term \( a = 1 \),
- The last term \( l = 499 \),
- The number of terms \( n = 499 \).

Substituting these values into the formula gives:

\[
S = \frac{499}{2} \times (1 + 499)
\]

Simplify the expression inside the parentheses:

\[
1 + 499 = 500
\]

Now substitute back into the formula:

\[
S = \frac{499}{2} \times 500
\]

Calculate \( \frac{499}{2} \):

\[
\frac{499}{2} = 249.5
\]

Now multiply by 500:

\[
S = 249.5 \times 500
\]

Perform the multiplication:

\[
S = 124750
\]

Thus, the sum of all integers from 1 to 499 is \( 124750 \).

**Final Answer:**

The sum of all integers from 1 to 499 is 124750.
