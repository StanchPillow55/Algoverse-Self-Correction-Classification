Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to first understand what "Sample math problem 499" entails. Since the problem statement is not explicitly given, let's assume it involves a typical math problem that could be labeled as such. For the sake of this exercise, let's consider a hypothetical problem:

**Problem 499:**
Solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).

Let's solve this step by step:

### Step 1: Understand the Equation
The equation given is \( 2x + 3 = 11 \). This is a linear equation in one variable, \( x \).

### Step 2: Isolate the Variable
To solve for \( x \), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We can do this by performing operations that will leave \( x \) alone on one side.

#### Subtract 3 from both sides:
\[ 2x + 3 - 3 = 11 - 3 \]

This simplifies to:
\[ 2x = 8 \]

### Step 3: Solve for \( x \)
Now that we have \( 2x = 8 \), we need to solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides by 2.

#### Divide both sides by 2:
\[ \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{8}{2} \]

This simplifies to:
\[ x = 4 \]

### Step 4: Verify the Solution
To ensure our solution is correct, we can substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation and check if both sides are equal.

Substitute \( x = 4 \) into \( 2x + 3 = 11 \):
\[ 2(4) + 3 = 11 \]

Calculate the left side:
\[ 8 + 3 = 11 \]

Since both sides of the equation are equal, our solution is verified.

### Final Answer
The solution to the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \) is \( x = 4 \).
