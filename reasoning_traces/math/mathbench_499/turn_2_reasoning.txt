Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem labeled "Sample math problem 499," we need to first understand what the problem is asking. However, since the problem statement is not provided, I'll create a hypothetical math problem and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem 499:**

"Find the value of \( x \) that satisfies the equation \( 3x + 7 = 22 \)."

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Equation:**
   The equation given is \( 3x + 7 = 22 \). This is a linear equation in one variable, \( x \).

2. **Isolate the Variable:**
   To solve for \( x \), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We can do this by performing inverse operations.

3. **Subtract 7 from Both Sides:**
   First, we subtract 7 from both sides of the equation to remove the constant term from the left side:
   \[
   3x + 7 - 7 = 22 - 7
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   3x = 15
   \]

4. **Divide by 3:**
   Next, we divide both sides by 3 to solve for \( x \):
   \[
   \frac{3x}{3} = \frac{15}{3}
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   x = 5
   \]

5. **Verify the Solution:**
   To ensure our solution is correct, we substitute \( x = 5 \) back into the original equation:
   \[
   3(5) + 7 = 22
   \]
   Simplifying the left side:
   \[
   15 + 7 = 22
   \]
   \[
   22 = 22
   \]
   The left side equals the right side, confirming that our solution is correct.

**Final Answer:**

The value of \( x \) that satisfies the equation \( 3x + 7 = 22 \) is \( x = 5 \).
