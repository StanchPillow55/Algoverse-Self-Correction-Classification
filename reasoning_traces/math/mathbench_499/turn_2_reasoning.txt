==================================================

To solve "Sample math problem 499," we need to first understand what the problem is asking. However, the problem statement is not provided here, so I will create a hypothetical math problem labeled as "Sample math problem 499" and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**
"Sample math problem 499: Solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 3x + 7 = 22 \)."

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Equation:**
   The equation given is \( 3x + 7 = 22 \). This is a linear equation in one variable, \( x \).

2. **Isolate the Variable:**
   To solve for \( x \), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We start by eliminating the constant term on the left side of the equation.

   \[
   3x + 7 = 22
   \]

   Subtract 7 from both sides to remove the constant term from the left side:

   \[
   3x + 7 - 7 = 22 - 7
   \]

   Simplifying both sides gives:

   \[
   3x = 15
   \]

3. **Solve for \( x \):**
   Now, we need to solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides of the equation by the coefficient of \( x \), which is 3.

   \[
   \frac{3x}{3} = \frac{15}{3}
   \]

   Simplifying both sides gives:

   \[
   x = 5
   \]

4. **Verify the Solution:**
   To ensure our solution is correct, we substitute \( x = 5 \) back into the original equation to check if both sides are equal.

   Original equation: \( 3x + 7 = 22 \)

   Substitute \( x = 5 \):

   \[
   3(5) + 7 = 22
   \]

   Simplify the left side:

   \[
   15 + 7 = 22
   \]

   \[
   22 = 22
   \]

   Since both sides of the equation are equal, our solution \( x = 5 \) is correct.

**Final Answer:**
The solution to the equation \( 3x + 7 = 22 \) is \( x = 5 \).
