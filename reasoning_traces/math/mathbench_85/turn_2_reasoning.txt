Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, I need more information about "Sample math problem 85." Since the problem statement is not provided, I'll demonstrate how to approach a generic math problem step by step. If you have a specific problem in mind, please provide the details.

Let's consider a sample math problem:

**Problem:** Solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).

**Step 1: Understand the Problem**
The equation given is a simple linear equation in one variable, \( x \). Our goal is to find the value of \( x \) that makes the equation true.

**Step 2: Isolate the Variable**
To solve for \( x \), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We start by eliminating the constant term on the left side.

- Subtract 3 from both sides of the equation:
  \[
  2x + 3 - 3 = 11 - 3
  \]
  Simplifying both sides gives:
  \[
  2x = 8
  \]

**Step 3: Solve for the Variable**
Now, we need to solve for \( x \) by getting rid of the coefficient of \( x \).

- Divide both sides by 2:
  \[
  \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{8}{2}
  \]
  Simplifying both sides gives:
  \[
  x = 4
  \]

**Step 4: Verify the Solution**
To ensure our solution is correct, we substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation:

- Original equation: \( 2x + 3 = 11 \)
- Substitute \( x = 4 \):
  \[
  2(4) + 3 = 11
  \]
  Simplifying the left side gives:
  \[
  8 + 3 = 11
  \]
  Since both sides of the equation are equal, our solution is verified.

**Final Answer**
The solution to the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \) is \( x = 4 \).
