==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 85," we need to first understand what the problem is asking. However, since "Sample math problem 85" is not a specific problem statement, I'll create a hypothetical math problem involving the number 85 and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**
Find the prime factors of 85 and determine if 85 is a prime number.

**Step 1: Determine if 85 is a prime number.**

A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. To determine if 85 is a prime number, we need to check if it has any divisors other than 1 and 85.

**Step 2: Check divisibility by smaller prime numbers.**

We will check divisibility by the smallest prime numbers: 2, 3, 5, and 7. If 85 is divisible by any of these, it is not a prime number.

- **Divisibility by 2:** A number is divisible by 2 if it is even. Since 85 is odd, it is not divisible by 2.
  
- **Divisibility by 3:** A number is divisible by 3 if the sum of its digits is divisible by 3. The sum of the digits of 85 is 8 + 5 = 13, which is not divisible by 3. Therefore, 85 is not divisible by 3.

- **Divisibility by 5:** A number is divisible by 5 if it ends in 0 or 5. Since 85 ends in 5, it is divisible by 5.

Since 85 is divisible by 5, it is not a prime number.

**Step 3: Find the prime factors of 85.**

Since 85 is divisible by 5, we can divide 85 by 5 to find the other factor:

\[ 85 \div 5 = 17 \]

Now, we have the factors 5 and 17. We need to check if 17 is a prime number.

- **Checking if 17 is a prime number:** 
  - 17 is not divisible by 2 (since it is odd).
  - The sum of the digits of 17 is 1 + 7 = 8, which is not divisible by 3.
  - 17 does not end in 0 or 5, so it is not divisible by 5.

Since 17 is not divisible by any prime numbers less than or equal to its square root (approximately 4.12), 17 is a prime number.

**Step 4: Conclusion**

The prime factors of 85 are 5 and 17. Therefore, 85 is not a prime number.

**Final Answer:**
The prime factors of 85 are 5 and 17.
