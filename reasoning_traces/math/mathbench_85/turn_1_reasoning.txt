==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 85," we need to first understand what the problem is asking. However, since "Sample math problem 85" is not a specific problem statement, I'll create a hypothetical math problem labeled as "Sample math problem 85" and solve it step by step.

### Hypothetical Problem Statement:
**Sample Math Problem 85:**
If \( x + y = 10 \) and \( x - y = 4 \), find the values of \( x \) and \( y \).

### Step-by-Step Solution:

We are given two equations:
1. \( x + y = 10 \)
2. \( x - y = 4 \)

These are linear equations with two variables. We can solve them using the method of elimination or substitution. Here, I'll use the elimination method.

**Step 1: Add the two equations.**

\[
(x + y) + (x - y) = 10 + 4
\]

Simplifying the left side, we get:
\[
x + y + x - y = 2x
\]

So the equation becomes:
\[
2x = 14
\]

**Step 2: Solve for \( x \).**

Divide both sides by 2:
\[
x = \frac{14}{2} = 7
\]

**Step 3: Substitute \( x = 7 \) back into one of the original equations to find \( y \).**

Let's use the first equation:
\[
x + y = 10
\]

Substitute \( x = 7 \):
\[
7 + y = 10
\]

Solve for \( y \):
\[
y = 10 - 7 = 3
\]

### Final Answer:
The values of \( x \) and \( y \) are \( x = 7 \) and \( y = 3 \).

### Verification:
To ensure our solution is correct, we can substitute \( x = 7 \) and \( y = 3 \) back into the second original equation:

\[
x - y = 4
\]

Substitute the values:
\[
7 - 3 = 4
\]

This holds true, confirming our solution is correct.

Thus, the final answer is:
\( x = 7 \) and \( y = 3 \).
