==================================================

To solve the problem, we first need to understand what "Sample math problem 85" refers to. Since the problem is not explicitly stated, I'll assume a generic math problem involving the number 85. Let's create a problem and solve it step by step.

**Problem:**  
Find the prime factorization of 85 and determine if 85 is a prime number.

**Step 1: Understand the Problem**  
Prime factorization involves breaking down a number into its prime number components. A prime number is a number greater than 1 that has no divisors other than 1 and itself.

**Step 2: Check if 85 is a Prime Number**  
To determine if 85 is a prime number, we need to check if it has any divisors other than 1 and itself. We do this by testing divisibility by prime numbers less than the square root of 85.

The square root of 85 is approximately 9.22. Therefore, we need to check divisibility by the prime numbers 2, 3, 5, and 7.

- **Divisibility by 2:**  
  85 is an odd number, so it is not divisible by 2.

- **Divisibility by 3:**  
  To check divisibility by 3, sum the digits of 85:  
  \(8 + 5 = 13\).  
  Since 13 is not divisible by 3, 85 is not divisible by 3.

- **Divisibility by 5:**  
  A number is divisible by 5 if it ends in 0 or 5.  
  85 ends in 5, so it is divisible by 5.

**Step 3: Perform the Division**  
Since 85 is divisible by 5, we divide 85 by 5:  
\[ 85 \div 5 = 17 \]

**Step 4: Check if 17 is a Prime Number**  
Now we need to check if 17 is a prime number. The square root of 17 is approximately 4.12, so we check divisibility by the prime numbers 2 and 3.

- **Divisibility by 2:**  
  17 is an odd number, so it is not divisible by 2.

- **Divisibility by 3:**  
  Sum the digits of 17:  
  \(1 + 7 = 8\).  
  Since 8 is not divisible by 3, 17 is not divisible by 3.

Since 17 is not divisible by any prime numbers less than its square root, 17 is a prime number.

**Step 5: Write the Prime Factorization**  
Since 85 can be expressed as the product of the prime numbers 5 and 17, the prime factorization of 85 is:  
\[ 85 = 5 \times 17 \]

**Conclusion**  
85 is not a prime number because it has divisors other than 1 and itself. The prime factorization of 85 is \(5 \times 17\).

**Final Answer:**  
The prime factorization of 85 is \(5 \times 17\).
