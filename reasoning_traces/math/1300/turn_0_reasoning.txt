==================================================

To determine how much Josh makes in 2 weeks, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the number of days Josh works in a week:**
   - Josh is open every day except Sunday and Wednesday.
   - There are 7 days in a week.
   - He is closed on 2 days (Sunday and Wednesday).
   - Therefore, the number of days he works in a week is:
     \[
     7 - 2 = 5 \text{ days}
     \]

2. **Calculate the number of cars serviced in a week:**
   - Josh services 3 cars each day he is open.
   - In one week, the total number of cars serviced is:
     \[
     3 \text{ cars/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 15 \text{ cars}
     \]

3. **Calculate Josh's earnings in one week:**
   - Josh earns $4 for each car serviced.
   - Therefore, his earnings for servicing 15 cars in a week is:
     \[
     15 \text{ cars} \times 4 \text{ dollars/car} = 60 \text{ dollars}
     \]

4. **Calculate Josh's earnings in 2 weeks:**
   - Since he earns $60 in one week, in 2 weeks he will earn:
     \[
     60 \text{ dollars/week} \times 2 \text{ weeks} = 120 \text{ dollars}
     \]

5. **Final answer:**
   - Therefore, Josh makes a total of **$120** in 2 weeks.

So, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{120}
\]
