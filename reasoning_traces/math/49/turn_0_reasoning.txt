==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to determine how many shells Alan collected based on the information provided about Ben and Laurie.

1. **Identify the number of shells Laurie collected**: 
   - According to the problem, Laurie collected 36 shells.

2. **Determine how many shells Ben collected**: 
   - The problem states that Ben collected a third of what Laurie collected. 
   - We can calculate this as follows:
     \[
     \text{Ben's shells} = \frac{1}{3} \times \text{Laurie's shells} = \frac{1}{3} \times 36 = 12
     \]
   - So, Ben collected 12 shells.

3. **Calculate how many shells Alan collected**: 
   - The problem states that Alan collected four times as many shells as Ben did. 
   - We can calculate this as follows:
     \[
     \text{Alan's shells} = 4 \times \text{Ben's shells} = 4 \times 12 = 48
     \]
   - Therefore, Alan collected 48 shells.

4. **Final answer**: 
   - Alan collected **48 shells**.

Thus, the final answer is that Alan collected **48 shells**.
