Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to work backwards from the information given. 

First, we know that Laurie collected 36 shells. 

Second, we know that Ben collected a third of what Laurie did. To find out how many shells Ben collected, we divide Laurie's total by 3:

36 shells / 3 = 12 shells

So, Ben collected 12 shells.

Finally, we know that Alan collected four times as many shells as Ben did. To find out how many shells Alan collected, we multiply Ben's total by 4:

12 shells * 4 = 48 shells

So, Alan collected 48 shells.

Therefore, the final answer is that Alan collected 48 shells.
