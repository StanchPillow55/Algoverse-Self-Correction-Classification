==================================================

To find the total number of unoccupied units in Richard's apartment building, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of units in the building**:
   - The building has 15 floors.
   - Each floor contains 8 units.
   - Therefore, the total number of units can be calculated by multiplying the number of floors by the number of units per floor:

   \[
   \text{Total units} = \text{Number of floors} \times \text{Units per floor} = 15 \times 8
   \]

   \[
   \text{Total units} = 120
   \]

2. **Determine the number of occupied units**:
   - We know that 3/4 of the building is occupied. To find the number of occupied units, we multiply the total number of units by 3/4:

   \[
   \text{Occupied units} = \frac{3}{4} \times \text{Total units} = \frac{3}{4} \times 120
   \]

   \[
   \text{Occupied units} = 90
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of unoccupied units**:
   - To find the number of unoccupied units, we subtract the number of occupied units from the total number of units:

   \[
   \text{Unoccupied units} = \text{Total units} - \text{Occupied units} = 120 - 90
   \]

   \[
   \text{Unoccupied units} = 30
   \]

Thus, the total number of unoccupied units in the building is \( \boxed{30} \).
