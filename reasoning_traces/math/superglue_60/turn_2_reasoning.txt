==================================================

To solve the problem, we first need to understand what "Sample reasoning question 60" refers to. However, since the problem statement is not clear and doesn't provide any specific details or numbers to work with, we need to make some assumptions or create a hypothetical problem to demonstrate the process of reasoning and solving a math problem.

Let's assume "Sample reasoning question 60" is a typical math problem involving basic arithmetic or algebra. For the sake of this exercise, I'll create a hypothetical problem and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**

Calculate the value of \( x \) in the equation:  
\[ 2x + 3 = 15 \]

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Equation:**
   The equation given is \( 2x + 3 = 15 \). This is a linear equation in one variable, \( x \).

2. **Isolate the Variable:**
   To solve for \( x \), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We start by eliminating the constant term on the left side.

   Subtract 3 from both sides of the equation:
   \[
   2x + 3 - 3 = 15 - 3
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   2x = 12
   \]

3. **Solve for \( x \):**
   Now, divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( x \):
   \[
   \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{12}{2}
   \]
   Simplifying gives:
   \[
   x = 6
   \]

4. **Verify the Solution:**
   Substitute \( x = 6 \) back into the original equation to verify:
   \[
   2(6) + 3 = 15
   \]
   Simplifying the left side:
   \[
   12 + 3 = 15
   \]
   Since both sides of the equation are equal, our solution \( x = 6 \) is correct.

**Final Answer:**

The value of \( x \) is 6.

This is a demonstration of how to approach a math problem step by step, showing all calculations and reasoning. If "Sample reasoning question 60" refers to a different problem, please provide more details so I can assist you accurately.
