==================================================

To solve the problem, we will first determine how many marbles each person has based on the information provided.

1. **Identify the number of marbles Sean has:**
   - We are given that Sean has 56 marbles.

2. **Determine how many marbles Cal has:**
   - The problem states that Sean has half as many marbles as Cal. This can be expressed mathematically as:
     \[
     \text{Sean's marbles} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Cal's marbles}
     \]
   - Since Sean has 56 marbles, we can set up the equation:
     \[
     56 = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Cal's marbles}
     \]
   - To find Cal's marbles, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 2:
     \[
     \text{Cal's marbles} = 56 \times 2 = 112
     \]

3. **Determine how many marbles Carl has:**
   - The problem states that Carl has four times as many marbles as Sean. This can be expressed mathematically as:
     \[
     \text{Carl's marbles} = 4 \times \text{Sean's marbles}
     \]
   - Since Sean has 56 marbles, we can set up the equation:
     \[
     \text{Carl's marbles} = 4 \times 56
     \]
   - Now we calculate:
     \[
     \text{Carl's marbles} = 224
     \]

4. **Calculate the combined number of marbles Carl and Cal have:**
   - Now we need to find the total number of marbles that Carl and Cal have combined:
     \[
     \text{Total marbles} = \text{Carl's marbles} + \text{Cal's marbles}
     \]
   - Substituting the values we found:
     \[
     \text{Total marbles} = 224 + 112
     \]
   - Now we perform the addition:
     \[
     \text{Total marbles} = 336
     \]

5. **Final answer:**
   - The combined number of marbles that Carl and Cal have is \( \boxed{336} \).
