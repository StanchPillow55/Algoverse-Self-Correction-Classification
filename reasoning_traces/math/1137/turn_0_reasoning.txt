To solve the problem, we need to determine the minimum temperature of the water in the second mug, given that Donny can only drink water if it is at least 40 degrees. 

Let's denote:
- The temperature of the first mug (33 degrees) as \( T_1 = 33 \) degrees.
- The temperature of the second mug as \( T_2 \) (unknown).
- The amount of water poured from the first mug as \( V_1 = 4 \) ounces.
- The amount of water poured from the second mug as \( V_2 = 1 \) ounce.

When Donny pours water from both mugs into his water bottle, the total volume of water in the bottle becomes:
\[
V_{total} = V_1 + V_2 = 4 \text{ ounces} + 1 \text{ ounce} = 5 \text{ ounces}
\]

Next, we need to calculate the average temperature of the water in the bottle after pouring. The average temperature \( T_{avg} \) can be calculated using the formula for the weighted average based on the volumes and temperatures of the two sources:
\[
T_{avg} = \frac{V_1 \cdot T_1 + V_2 \cdot T_2}{V_{total}}
\]

Substituting the known values into the formula:
\[
T_{avg} = \frac{4 \cdot 33 + 1 \cdot T_2}{5}
\]

We know that Donny can only drink the water if \( T_{avg} \geq 40 \) degrees. Therefore, we set up the inequality:
\[
\frac{4 \cdot 33 + 1 \cdot T_2}{5} \geq 40
\]

Now, we can multiply both sides of the inequality by 5 to eliminate the fraction:
\[
4 \cdot 33 + T_2 \geq 200
\]

Calculating \( 4 \cdot 33 \):
\[
4 \cdot 33 = 132
\]

Substituting this back into the inequality gives:
\[
132 + T_2 \geq 200
\]

Now, we can isolate \( T_2 \) by subtracting 132 from both sides:
\[
T_2 \geq 200 - 132
\]
\[
T_2 \geq 68
\]

Thus, the minimum temperature of the water in the second mug must be at least 68 degrees for Donny to be able to drink the water.

Finally, we state the answer:
\[
\text{The minimum temperature of the second mug is } 68 \text{ degrees.}
\]
