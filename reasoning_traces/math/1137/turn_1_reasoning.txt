==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to determine the minimum temperature of the second mug of water, given that Donny can only drink water if it's at least 40 degrees. 

### Step 1: Understand the Problem
- Donny has two mugs of water:
  - Mug A: 33 degrees
  - Mug B: Unknown temperature (let's denote it as \( T \))
- He pours 4 ounces from Mug A and 1 ounce from Mug B into his water bottle.
- After pouring, the resulting mixture must be at least 40 degrees for Donny to drink it.

### Step 2: Calculate the Total Volume of Water
- Total volume of water poured into the bottle:
  \[
  \text{Total Volume} = 4 \text{ ounces (from Mug A)} + 1 \text{ ounce (from Mug B)} = 5 \text{ ounces}
  \]

### Step 3: Calculate the Total Heat Content
- The heat content (thermal energy) of a volume of water can be calculated using the formula:
  \[
  \text{Heat Content} = \text{Volume} \times \text{Temperature}
  \]
- For Mug A (33 degrees):
  \[
  \text{Heat Content from Mug A} = 4 \text{ ounces} \times 33 \text{ degrees} = 132 \text{ degree-ounces}
  \]
- For Mug B (unknown temperature \( T \)):
  \[
  \text{Heat Content from Mug B} = 1 \text{ ounce} \times T \text{ degrees} = T \text{ degree-ounces}
  \]

### Step 4: Set Up the Equation for the Mixture
- The total heat content of the mixture must equal the average temperature of the mixture multiplied by the total volume:
  \[
  \text{Total Heat Content} = \text{Average Temperature} \times \text{Total Volume}
  \]
- The average temperature of the mixture must be at least 40 degrees:
  \[
  \text{Total Heat Content} = 40 \text{ degrees} \times 5 \text{ ounces} = 200 \text{ degree-ounces}
  \]

### Step 5: Combine the Heat Contents
- The total heat content from both mugs is:
  \[
  132 + T = 200
  \]

### Step 6: Solve for \( T \)
- Rearranging the equation gives:
  \[
  T = 200 - 132
  \]
  \[
  T = 68
  \]

### Conclusion
The minimum temperature of the second mug of water must be at least **68 degrees** for Donny to be able to drink the water after mixing. 

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{68}
\]
