==================================================

To solve the problem, we will break it down into several steps: calculating the driving time to the destination, the driving time for the return trip, and then adding the time spent at the destination.

### Step 1: Calculate the distance of the return trip
The distance to the destination is 55 miles. The return trip is 10 miles farther, so we can calculate the distance for the return trip as follows:

\[
\text{Distance for return trip} = 55 \text{ miles} + 10 \text{ miles} = 65 \text{ miles}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the total distance
Now we can calculate the total distance for the entire tour:

\[
\text{Total distance} = \text{Distance to destination} + \text{Distance for return trip} = 55 \text{ miles} + 65 \text{ miles} = 120 \text{ miles}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the driving time
Manex drives at a speed of 1 mile per 2 minutes. To find out how long it takes him to drive 1 mile, we can convert this speed into hours:

\[
\text{Time to drive 1 mile} = 2 \text{ minutes} = \frac{2}{60} \text{ hours} = \frac{1}{30} \text{ hours}
\]

Now, we can calculate the total driving time for the entire tour (120 miles):

\[
\text{Total driving time} = \text{Total distance} \times \text{Time per mile}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\text{Total driving time} = 120 \text{ miles} \times \frac{1}{30} \text{ hours/mile} = 4 \text{ hours}
\]

### Step 4: Add the time spent at the destination
Manex stays at the destination for 2 hours. We need to add this time to the total driving time:

\[
\text{Total time for the tour} = \text{Total driving time} + \text{Time at destination}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\text{Total time for the tour} = 4 \text{ hours} + 2 \text{ hours} = 6 \text{ hours}
\]

### Final Answer
The total time it will take Manex to complete the entire tour is:

\[
\boxed{6} \text{ hours}
\]
