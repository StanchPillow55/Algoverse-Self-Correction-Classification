To determine how much money Elvira will have left for her clothing after purchasing her computer and accessories, we will follow these steps:

1. **Identify the total budget**: Elvira has a total budget of €1500.

2. **List the costs of the items she wants to purchase**:
   - Computer: €1090
   - Scanner: €157
   - CD burner: €74
   - Printer: €102

3. **Calculate the total cost of the items**:
   We will add the costs of all the items together:

   \[
   \text{Total cost} = \text{Cost of computer} + \text{Cost of scanner} + \text{Cost of CD burner} + \text{Cost of printer}
   \]

   Plugging in the values:

   \[
   \text{Total cost} = 1090 + 157 + 74 + 102
   \]

   Now, we will perform the addition step by step:

   - First, add the cost of the computer and the scanner:
     \[
     1090 + 157 = 1247
     \]

   - Next, add the cost of the CD burner:
     \[
     1247 + 74 = 1321
     \]

   - Finally, add the cost of the printer:
     \[
     1321 + 102 = 1423
     \]

   Therefore, the total cost of all the items is €1423.

4. **Calculate the remaining budget for clothing**:
   To find out how much money Elvira has left for clothing, we subtract the total cost of the items from her total budget:

   \[
   \text{Remaining money} = \text{Total budget} - \text{Total cost}
   \]

   Plugging in the values:

   \[
   \text{Remaining money} = 1500 - 1423
   \]

   Performing the subtraction:

   \[
   1500 - 1423 = 77
   \]

5. **Final answer**:
   Elvira will have €77 left for her clothing.

Thus, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{77}
\]
