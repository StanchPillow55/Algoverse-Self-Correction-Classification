To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total time Manex spends on the entire tour, including driving to the destination, staying there, and driving back.

### Step 1: Calculate the time to drive to the destination

- **Distance to the destination:** 55 miles
- **Driving speed:** 1 mile per 2 minutes

First, calculate the time it takes to drive to the destination:

\[
\text{Time to destination} = 55 \text{ miles} \times 2 \text{ minutes per mile} = 110 \text{ minutes}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the time spent at the destination

- **Time spent at the destination:** 2 hours

Convert this time into minutes to keep the units consistent:

\[
2 \text{ hours} = 2 \times 60 = 120 \text{ minutes}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the time to drive back

- **Distance back:** 55 miles + 10 miles = 65 miles
- **Driving speed:** 1 mile per 2 minutes

Calculate the time it takes to drive back:

\[
\text{Time to return} = 65 \text{ miles} \times 2 \text{ minutes per mile} = 130 \text{ minutes}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the total time for the entire tour

Add up all the times calculated:

- Time to destination: 110 minutes
- Time spent at the destination: 120 minutes
- Time to return: 130 minutes

\[
\text{Total time in minutes} = 110 + 120 + 130 = 360 \text{ minutes}
\]

### Step 5: Convert the total time into hours

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, convert the total time from minutes to hours:

\[
\text{Total time in hours} = \frac{360 \text{ minutes}}{60 \text{ minutes per hour}} = 6 \text{ hours}
\]

### Final Answer

The total time it will take the bus driver to do the entire tour is \(\boxed{6}\) hours.
