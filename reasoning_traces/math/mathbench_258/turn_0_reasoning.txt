==================================================

To solve "Sample math problem 258," I need more specific information about the problem itself. Since the problem isn't provided, I'll create a sample math problem and solve it step by step. Let's assume the problem is as follows:

**Problem:**
A rectangle has a length that is 3 times its width. If the perimeter of the rectangle is 48 units, find the dimensions of the rectangle.

**Solution:**

To solve this problem, we'll use the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle and the relationship between the length and the width given in the problem.

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( w \) be the width of the rectangle.
   - Since the length is 3 times the width, the length \( l \) can be expressed as \( l = 3w \).

2. **Perimeter Formula:**
   The formula for the perimeter \( P \) of a rectangle is:
   \[
   P = 2l + 2w
   \]

3. **Substitute Known Values:**
   We know the perimeter is 48 units, so:
   \[
   48 = 2(3w) + 2w
   \]

4. **Simplify the Equation:**
   \[
   48 = 6w + 2w
   \]
   \[
   48 = 8w
   \]

5. **Solve for \( w \):**
   Divide both sides of the equation by 8 to solve for \( w \):
   \[
   w = \frac{48}{8} = 6
   \]

6. **Find the Length:**
   Since \( l = 3w \), substitute \( w = 6 \) into the equation for the length:
   \[
   l = 3 \times 6 = 18
   \]

7. **Verify the Solution:**
   Check that the dimensions satisfy the original perimeter condition:
   \[
   P = 2l + 2w = 2(18) + 2(6) = 36 + 12 = 48
   \]
   The calculated perimeter matches the given perimeter, confirming that our solution is correct.

**Final Answer:**
The dimensions of the rectangle are a width of 6 units and a length of 18 units.
