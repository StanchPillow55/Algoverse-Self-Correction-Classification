Question ID: mathbench_258
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we first need to understand what "Sample math problem 258" refers to. Since there is no specific problem statement provided, I'll create a hypothetical math problem labeled as "Sample math problem 258" and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem Statement:**
"Sample math problem 258: Solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 2x + 5 = 17 \)."

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Equation:**
   The given equation is \( 2x + 5 = 17 \). This is a linear equation in one variable, \( x \).

2. **Isolate the Variable:**
   To solve for \( x \), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We can do this by performing operations that will simplify the equation.

3. **Subtract 5 from Both Sides:**
   To eliminate the constant term on the left side, subtract 5 from both sides of the equation:
   \[
   2x + 5 - 5 = 17 - 5
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   2x = 12
   \]

4. **Divide by 2:**
   Now, divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( x \):
   \[
   \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{12}{2}
   \]
   Simplifying gives:
   \[
   x = 6
   \]

5. **Verify the Solution:**
   Substitute \( x = 6 \) back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies the equation:
   \[
   2(6) + 5 = 17
   \]
   Simplifying the left side:
   \[
   12 + 5 = 17
   \]
   Since both sides of the equation are equal, the solution \( x = 6 \) is verified.

**Final Answer:**
The solution to the equation \( 2x + 5 = 17 \) is \( x = 6 \).
