Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 258," we first need to understand what the problem is asking. However, since "Sample math problem 258" is not a specific question, I'll demonstrate how to approach a typical math problem by creating a sample problem and solving it step by step.

Let's assume the problem is:

**Problem:** Solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).

**Step 1: Understand the Problem**

We need to find the value of \( x \) that makes the equation true.

**Step 2: Isolate the Variable**

To solve for \( x \), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We start with:

\[ 2x + 3 = 11 \]

Subtract 3 from both sides to get rid of the constant term on the left side:

\[ 2x + 3 - 3 = 11 - 3 \]

This simplifies to:

\[ 2x = 8 \]

**Step 3: Solve for \( x \)**

Now, divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( x \):

\[ \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{8}{2} \]

This simplifies to:

\[ x = 4 \]

**Step 4: Verify the Solution**

Substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation to verify:

\[ 2(4) + 3 = 11 \]

\[ 8 + 3 = 11 \]

\[ 11 = 11 \]

The left side equals the right side, confirming our solution is correct.

**Final Answer:**

The solution to the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \) is \( x = 4 \).

This process demonstrates how to solve a simple linear equation by isolating the variable and verifying the solution. If you have a specific problem labeled "Sample math problem 258," please provide the details, and I can help solve that particular problem.
