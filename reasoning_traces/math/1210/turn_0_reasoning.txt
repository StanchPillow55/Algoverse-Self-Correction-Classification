To solve the problem, we need to determine how many water balloons Jolene and her friends threw during the water balloon fight. We will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of balloons filled.**
   - Jolene filled up 10 packs of balloons, with each pack containing 30 balloons.
   - To find the total number of balloons, we multiply the number of packs by the number of balloons per pack:
     \[
     \text{Total balloons} = \text{Number of packs} \times \text{Balloons per pack} = 10 \times 30
     \]
   - Performing the multiplication:
     \[
     10 \times 30 = 300
     \]
   - So, there are 300 balloons in total.

2. **Determine how many balloons were used.**
   - By the end of the afternoon, there are 12 balloons left.
   - To find out how many balloons were thrown, we subtract the number of balloons left from the total number of balloons:
     \[
     \text{Balloons thrown} = \text{Total balloons} - \text{Balloons left} = 300 - 12
     \]
   - Performing the subtraction:
     \[
     300 - 12 = 288
     \]

3. **Final answer:**
   - Therefore, the total number of balloons that Jolene and her friends threw is:
     \[
     \boxed{288}
     \]
