==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 315" entails. Since the problem statement is not specific, I'll assume it's a generic math problem that involves logical reasoning or numerical calculations. 

Let's create a hypothetical problem that involves reasoning and calculations:

**Problem:**
A company produces two types of widgets: Type A and Type B. The company can produce a maximum of 100 widgets per day. The profit from selling Type A widgets is $5 per widget, and the profit from selling Type B widgets is $8 per widget. The company must produce at least 20 Type A widgets and 10 Type B widgets each day. How many of each type of widget should the company produce to maximize its profit?

**Solution:**

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( x \) be the number of Type A widgets produced.
   - Let \( y \) be the number of Type B widgets produced.

2. **Constraints:**
   - The total production cannot exceed 100 widgets: 
     \[
     x + y \leq 100
     \]
   - At least 20 Type A widgets must be produced:
     \[
     x \geq 20
     \]
   - At least 10 Type B widgets must be produced:
     \[
     y \geq 10
     \]

3. **Objective Function:**
   - The profit function \( P \) is given by:
     \[
     P = 5x + 8y
     \]
   - We want to maximize \( P \).

4. **Graphical Solution:**
   - Plot the constraints on a graph with \( x \) on the horizontal axis and \( y \) on the vertical axis.
   - The feasible region is bounded by the lines \( x + y = 100 \), \( x = 20 \), and \( y = 10 \).

5. **Find the Vertices of the Feasible Region:**
   - Intersection of \( x + y = 100 \) and \( x = 20 \):
     \[
     20 + y = 100 \implies y = 80
     \]
     Vertex: \( (20, 80) \)
   - Intersection of \( x + y = 100 \) and \( y = 10 \):
     \[
     x + 10 = 100 \implies x = 90
     \]
     Vertex: \( (90, 10) \)
   - Intersection of \( x = 20 \) and \( y = 10 \):
     Vertex: \( (20, 10) \)

6. **Evaluate the Objective Function at Each Vertex:**
   - At \( (20, 80) \):
     \[
     P = 5(20) + 8(80) = 100 + 640 = 740
     \]
   - At \( (90, 10) \):
     \[
     P = 5(90) + 8(10) = 450 + 80 = 530
     \]
   - At \( (20, 10) \):
     \[
     P = 5(20) + 8(10) = 100 + 80 = 180
     \]

7. **Conclusion:**
   - The maximum profit is \( 740 \), which occurs when the company produces 20 Type A widgets and 80 Type B widgets.

**Final Answer:**
To maximize profit, the company should produce 20 Type A widgets and 80 Type B widgets per day. The maximum profit is $740.
