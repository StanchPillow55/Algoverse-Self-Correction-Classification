==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 315" entails. Since the problem statement is not clear or specific, let's assume that "Sample reasoning question 315" is a placeholder for a typical math problem. Without specific details, I'll create a hypothetical problem and solve it step by step.

### Hypothetical Problem:
Let's assume "Sample reasoning question 315" refers to the following problem:

**Problem:**  
A farmer has a rectangular field with a length that is 3 times its width. The perimeter of the field is 96 meters. What are the dimensions of the field?

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We have a rectangular field.
   - Let the width of the field be \( w \) meters.
   - The length of the field is 3 times the width, so the length is \( 3w \) meters.
   - The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula:  
     \[
     P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width})
     \]
   - We are given that the perimeter is 96 meters.

2. **Set Up the Equation:**
   - Substitute the expressions for length and width into the perimeter formula:
     \[
     96 = 2 \times (3w + w)
     \]

3. **Simplify the Equation:**
   - Combine like terms inside the parentheses:
     \[
     96 = 2 \times (4w)
     \]
   - Simplify further:
     \[
     96 = 8w
     \]

4. **Solve for \( w \):**
   - Divide both sides of the equation by 8 to solve for \( w \):
     \[
     w = \frac{96}{8} = 12
     \]

5. **Find the Length:**
   - Since the length is 3 times the width:
     \[
     \text{Length} = 3w = 3 \times 12 = 36
     \]

6. **Verify the Solution:**
   - Check if the calculated dimensions satisfy the perimeter condition:
     \[
     P = 2 \times (36 + 12) = 2 \times 48 = 96
     \]
   - The perimeter is indeed 96 meters, confirming our solution is correct.

### Final Answer:
The dimensions of the field are:
- Width: 12 meters
- Length: 36 meters

This completes the solution to the hypothetical problem based on the given instructions. If "Sample reasoning question 315" refers to a different problem, please provide additional details for a more accurate solution.
