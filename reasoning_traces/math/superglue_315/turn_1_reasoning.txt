==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 315" entails. Since the problem statement is not specific, I'll assume it's a placeholder for a typical math problem. Let's create a hypothetical math problem and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**
A store sells two types of products: A and B. Product A costs $5 each, and product B costs $7 each. A customer buys a total of 10 products and spends $62. How many of each product did the customer buy?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( x \) be the number of product A purchased.
   - Let \( y \) be the number of product B purchased.

2. **Set Up Equations:**
   - We know the total number of products is 10:
     \[
     x + y = 10
     \]
   - We also know the total cost is $62:
     \[
     5x + 7y = 62
     \]

3. **Solve the System of Equations:**

   We have the system:
   \[
   \begin{align*}
   x + y &= 10 \quad \text{(Equation 1)} \\
   5x + 7y &= 62 \quad \text{(Equation 2)}
   \end{align*}
   \]

   - From Equation 1, express \( y \) in terms of \( x \):
     \[
     y = 10 - x
     \]

   - Substitute \( y = 10 - x \) into Equation 2:
     \[
     5x + 7(10 - x) = 62
     \]

   - Simplify and solve for \( x \):
     \[
     5x + 70 - 7x = 62
     \]
     \[
     -2x + 70 = 62
     \]
     \[
     -2x = 62 - 70
     \]
     \[
     -2x = -8
     \]
     \[
     x = 4
     \]

   - Substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the equation for \( y \):
     \[
     y = 10 - 4 = 6
     \]

4. **Verify the Solution:**
   - Check the total number of products:
     \[
     x + y = 4 + 6 = 10
     \]
   - Check the total cost:
     \[
     5x + 7y = 5(4) + 7(6) = 20 + 42 = 62
     \]

Both conditions are satisfied, confirming our solution is correct.

**Final Answer:**
The customer bought 4 units of product A and 6 units of product B.
