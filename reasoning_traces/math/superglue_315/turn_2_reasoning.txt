==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 315" entails. Since the problem statement is not explicitly given, I'll assume a hypothetical math problem and solve it step by step. Let's assume the problem is as follows:

**Problem:**  
A company produces 315 units of a product each day. Each unit requires 2 hours of labor to produce. If the company has 10 workers, each working 8 hours a day, how many additional workers are needed to meet the daily production target?

**Step-by-step Solution:**

1. **Calculate Total Labor Hours Required:**
   - Each unit requires 2 hours of labor.
   - Total units produced per day = 315.
   - Total labor hours required per day = 315 units × 2 hours/unit = 630 hours.

2. **Calculate Total Labor Hours Available:**
   - The company has 10 workers.
   - Each worker works 8 hours a day.
   - Total labor hours available per day = 10 workers × 8 hours/worker = 80 hours.

3. **Determine Labor Hour Deficit:**
   - Labor hour deficit = Total labor hours required - Total labor hours available
   - Labor hour deficit = 630 hours - 80 hours = 550 hours.

4. **Calculate Additional Workers Needed:**
   - Each additional worker provides 8 hours of labor per day.
   - Additional workers needed = Labor hour deficit / Hours per worker
   - Additional workers needed = 550 hours / 8 hours/worker = 68.75 workers.

5. **Round Up to Whole Workers:**
   - Since we cannot have a fraction of a worker, we round up to the nearest whole number.
   - Additional workers needed = 69 workers.

**Final Answer:**
The company needs 69 additional workers to meet the daily production target of 315 units.
