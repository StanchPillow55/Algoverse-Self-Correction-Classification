Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 315" refers to. Since the problem statement is not clear and lacks specific details, I'll demonstrate a general approach to solving a typical math problem by using a hypothetical example. Let's assume "Sample reasoning question 315" is a math problem involving algebra.

**Hypothetical Problem:**
Solve for \( x \) in the equation: \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Equation:**
   The equation given is \( 2x + 3 = 11 \). Our goal is to solve for \( x \).

2. **Isolate the Variable:**
   To isolate \( x \), we need to get rid of the constant term on the left side of the equation. We do this by subtracting 3 from both sides of the equation:
   \[
   2x + 3 - 3 = 11 - 3
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   2x = 8
   \]

3. **Solve for \( x \):**
   Now that we have \( 2x = 8 \), we need to solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides by 2:
   \[
   \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{8}{2}
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   x = 4
   \]

4. **Verify the Solution:**
   To ensure our solution is correct, we substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation:
   \[
   2(4) + 3 = 11
   \]
   Simplifying the left side gives:
   \[
   8 + 3 = 11
   \]
   Since both sides of the equation are equal, our solution \( x = 4 \) is verified.

**Final Answer:**
The solution to the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \) is \( x = 4 \).

This example demonstrates a typical approach to solving a linear equation. If "Sample reasoning question 315" refers to a different type of problem, please provide additional details or context so I can assist you more accurately.
