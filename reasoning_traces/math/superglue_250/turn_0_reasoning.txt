==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 250" entails. However, since the problem statement is not clear or specific, I'll assume it's a placeholder for a typical math problem. Let's create a hypothetical problem to solve.

**Hypothetical Problem:**

A company produces two types of widgets: Type A and Type B. The company can produce up to 100 widgets per day. Each Type A widget requires 2 hours of labor, and each Type B widget requires 3 hours of labor. The company has a maximum of 240 labor hours available per day. The profit from each Type A widget is $5, and the profit from each Type B widget is $7. How many of each type of widget should the company produce to maximize profit?

**Solution:**

To solve this problem, we will use linear programming. We need to define our variables, constraints, and objective function.

1. **Define the Variables:**
   - Let \( x \) be the number of Type A widgets produced.
   - Let \( y \) be the number of Type B widgets produced.

2. **Objective Function:**
   - We want to maximize the profit, \( P \).
   - Profit from Type A widgets = \( 5x \).
   - Profit from Type B widgets = \( 7y \).
   - Objective function: \( P = 5x + 7y \).

3. **Constraints:**
   - Production constraint: \( x + y \leq 100 \) (cannot produce more than 100 widgets).
   - Labor constraint: \( 2x + 3y \leq 240 \) (cannot exceed 240 labor hours).
   - Non-negativity constraints: \( x \geq 0 \), \( y \geq 0 \).

4. **Graphical Solution:**
   - Plot the constraints on a graph with \( x \) on the horizontal axis and \( y \) on the vertical axis.
   - The line \( x + y = 100 \) intersects the axes at (100, 0) and (0, 100).
   - The line \( 2x + 3y = 240 \) intersects the axes at (120, 0) and (0, 80).

5. **Feasible Region:**
   - The feasible region is bounded by the lines \( x + y = 100 \), \( 2x + 3y = 240 \), and the axes.
   - The vertices of the feasible region are found by solving the system of equations at the intersections:
     - Intersection of \( x + y = 100 \) and \( 2x + 3y = 240 \):
       \[
       x + y = 100 \\
       2x + 3y = 240
       \]
       Solving these simultaneously:
       \[
       y = 100 - x \\
       2x + 3(100 - x) = 240 \\
       2x + 300 - 3x = 240 \\
       -x + 300 = 240 \\
       x = 60, \quad y = 40
       \]
     - Other vertices are (0, 80) and (100, 0).

6. **Evaluate the Objective Function at Each Vertex:**
   - At (60, 40): \( P = 5(60) + 7(40) = 300 + 280 = 580 \).
   - At (0, 80): \( P = 5(0) + 7(80) = 0 + 560 = 560 \).
   - At (100, 0): \( P = 5(100) + 7(0) = 500 + 0 = 500 \).

7. **Conclusion:**
   - The maximum profit is \( P = 580 \) at the point (60, 40).

**Final Answer:**
The company should produce 60 Type A widgets and 40 Type B widgets to maximize profit, resulting in a maximum profit of $580.
