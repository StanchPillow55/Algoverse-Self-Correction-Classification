==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample reasoning question 250," we need to first understand what the problem is asking. However, the problem statement is incomplete as it stands. It appears to be a placeholder or a reference to a specific problem that isn't fully described here. 

In order to provide a complete solution, I would need more information about the problem itself. For instance, is it a mathematical equation to solve, a word problem, a logic puzzle, or something else entirely? Each type of problem requires a different approach.

Since the problem is not fully specified, I can demonstrate how to approach a typical math problem by creating an example problem and solving it step by step. Let's consider a sample math problem:

**Example Problem:**
Solve for \( x \) in the equation: \( 3x + 5 = 20 \).

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   We need to find the value of \( x \) that makes the equation true.

2. **Isolate the Variable:**
   To solve for \( x \), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We can start by eliminating the constant term on the left side of the equation.

   \[
   3x + 5 = 20
   \]

   Subtract 5 from both sides to get:

   \[
   3x = 15
   \]

3. **Solve for \( x \):**
   Now, divide both sides by 3 to solve for \( x \).

   \[
   x = \frac{15}{3}
   \]

   Simplifying the right side gives:

   \[
   x = 5
   \]

4. **Verify the Solution:**
   Substitute \( x = 5 \) back into the original equation to verify:

   \[
   3(5) + 5 = 20
   \]

   Simplifying the left side:

   \[
   15 + 5 = 20
   \]

   \[
   20 = 20
   \]

   The left side equals the right side, confirming that our solution is correct.

**Final Answer:**
The solution to the equation \( 3x + 5 = 20 \) is \( x = 5 \).
