==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 250" refers to. Since the problem does not provide specific details or context, we will assume it is a placeholder for a mathematical reasoning problem. Let's create a hypothetical math problem and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**

"Calculate the sum of all even numbers between 1 and 250."

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Identify the Even Numbers:**
   - Even numbers are integers divisible by 2.
   - The even numbers between 1 and 250 start from 2 and end at 250.

2. **List the Sequence of Even Numbers:**
   - The sequence of even numbers between 1 and 250 is: 2, 4, 6, ..., 250.

3. **Determine the Number of Terms in the Sequence:**
   - This sequence is an arithmetic sequence where the first term \( a_1 = 2 \) and the last term \( a_n = 250 \), with a common difference \( d = 2 \).
   - The formula for the \( n \)-th term of an arithmetic sequence is:
     \[
     a_n = a_1 + (n-1) \cdot d
     \]
   - Plugging in the known values:
     \[
     250 = 2 + (n-1) \cdot 2
     \]
     \[
     250 = 2 + 2n - 2
     \]
     \[
     250 = 2n
     \]
     \[
     n = \frac{250}{2} = 125
     \]
   - There are 125 even numbers between 1 and 250.

4. **Calculate the Sum of the Sequence:**
   - The sum \( S_n \) of an arithmetic sequence can be calculated using the formula:
     \[
     S_n = \frac{n}{2} \cdot (a_1 + a_n)
     \]
   - Substituting the known values:
     \[
     S_{125} = \frac{125}{2} \cdot (2 + 250)
     \]
     \[
     S_{125} = \frac{125}{2} \cdot 252
     \]
     \[
     S_{125} = 125 \cdot 126
     \]
     \[
     S_{125} = 15750
     \]

**Final Answer:**

The sum of all even numbers between 1 and 250 is 15,750.
