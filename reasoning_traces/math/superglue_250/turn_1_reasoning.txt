==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 250" refers to. Since the question is not explicitly provided, I'll assume that "Sample reasoning question 250" is a placeholder for a specific math problem. Without the actual content of the problem, I will demonstrate a general approach to solving a typical math problem.

Let's assume "Sample reasoning question 250" is a math problem involving solving a quadratic equation. Here's how we would approach it:

**Problem:** Solve the quadratic equation \( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \).

**Step 1: Identify the coefficients.**
- Let's assume the quadratic equation is \( 2x^2 + 3x - 5 = 0 \).
- Here, \( a = 2 \), \( b = 3 \), and \( c = -5 \).

**Step 2: Use the quadratic formula.**
The quadratic formula is given by:
\[
x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
\]

**Step 3: Calculate the discriminant.**
The discriminant (\( \Delta \)) is:
\[
\Delta = b^2 - 4ac = 3^2 - 4 \times 2 \times (-5) = 9 + 40 = 49
\]

**Step 4: Determine the nature of the roots.**
Since the discriminant is positive (\( \Delta = 49 \)), the equation has two distinct real roots.

**Step 5: Calculate the roots using the quadratic formula.**
\[
x = \frac{-3 \pm \sqrt{49}}{4}
\]

Calculate each root:
- First root (\( x_1 \)):
\[
x_1 = \frac{-3 + 7}{4} = \frac{4}{4} = 1
\]

- Second root (\( x_2 \)):
\[
x_2 = \frac{-3 - 7}{4} = \frac{-10}{4} = -2.5
\]

**Final Answer:**
The solutions to the quadratic equation \( 2x^2 + 3x - 5 = 0 \) are \( x = 1 \) and \( x = -2.5 \).

This is a general approach to solving a quadratic equation. If "Sample reasoning question 250" refers to a different type of problem, please provide more details or specify the problem so I can offer a tailored solution.
