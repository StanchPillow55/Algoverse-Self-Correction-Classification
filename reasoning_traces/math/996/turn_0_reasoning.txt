==================================================

To solve the problem, we will first define the ages of the children and then use the information given to set up equations.

1. **Define the ages**:
   - Let \( A \) be Akbar's age: \( A = 3 \) years.
   - Let \( B \) be Alessandro's age: \( B = 4 \) years.
   - Let \( C \) be Helene's age.
   - Let \( D \) be Wilfred's age.

2. **Total age of the children**:
   The total age of the children is given as 20 years. Therefore, we can write the equation:
   \[
   A + B + C + D = 20
   \]
   Substituting the known values of \( A \) and \( B \):
   \[
   3 + 4 + C + D = 20
   \]
   Simplifying this gives:
   \[
   C + D = 20 - 7 = 13
   \]
   So, we have our first equation:
   \[
   C + D = 13 \quad \text{(1)}
   \]

3. **Helene's age**:
   We know that Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group. The average age of the four children can be calculated as:
   \[
   \text{Average age} = \frac{A + B + C + D}{4} = \frac{20}{4} = 5
   \]
   Therefore, Helene's age \( C \) is:
   \[
   C = 2 \times \text{Average age} = 2 \times 5 = 10
   \]

4. **Substituting Helene's age into equation (1)**:
   Now that we know \( C = 10 \), we can substitute this value into equation (1):
   \[
   10 + D = 13
   \]
   Solving for \( D \):
   \[
   D = 13 - 10 = 3
   \]

5. **Final answer**:
   Thus, Wilfred's age \( D \) is \( 3 \) years old.

In conclusion, the age of Wilfred is:
\[
\boxed{3}
\]
