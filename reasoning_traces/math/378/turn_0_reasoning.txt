To find Uki's total earnings for five days, we need to calculate her daily earnings from selling cupcakes, cookies, and biscuits, and then multiply that by five.

### Step 1: Calculate Daily Earnings

1. **Earnings from Cupcakes**:
   - Price per cupcake = $1.50
   - Number of cupcakes baked per day = 20
   - Daily earnings from cupcakes = Price per cupcake × Number of cupcakes
   \[
   \text{Daily earnings from cupcakes} = 1.50 \times 20 = 30 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Earnings from Cookies**:
   - Price per packet of cookies = $2
   - Number of packets of cookies baked per day = 10
   - Daily earnings from cookies = Price per packet × Number of packets
   \[
   \text{Daily earnings from cookies} = 2 \times 10 = 20 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Earnings from Biscuits**:
   - Price per packet of biscuits = $1
   - Number of packets of biscuits baked per day = 20
   - Daily earnings from biscuits = Price per packet × Number of packets
   \[
   \text{Daily earnings from biscuits} = 1 \times 20 = 20 \text{ dollars}
   \]

### Step 2: Calculate Total Daily Earnings

Now, we add the daily earnings from cupcakes, cookies, and biscuits:
\[
\text{Total daily earnings} = \text{Daily earnings from cupcakes} + \text{Daily earnings from cookies} + \text{Daily earnings from biscuits}
\]
\[
\text{Total daily earnings} = 30 + 20 + 20 = 70 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate Total Earnings for Five Days

To find the total earnings for five days, we multiply the total daily earnings by 5:
\[
\text{Total earnings for five days} = \text{Total daily earnings} \times 5
\]
\[
\text{Total earnings for five days} = 70 \times 5 = 350 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Final Answer

Uki's total earnings for five days will be **$350**.
