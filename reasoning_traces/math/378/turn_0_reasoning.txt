==================================================

To determine how many socks Lindsay has missed, we need to analyze the information given in the problem step by step.

1. **Total Socks**: Lindsay has a total of 50 socks that need washing.

2. **Pairs of Socks**: Lindsay washes 10 pairs of socks. Since each pair consists of 2 socks, we can calculate the total number of socks in the pairs:
   \[
   \text{Socks from pairs} = 10 \text{ pairs} \times 2 \text{ socks/pair} = 20 \text{ socks}
   \]

3. **Loose Socks**: In addition to the pairs, Lindsay washes 15 loose socks. 

4. **Total Socks Washed**: Now, we can find the total number of socks that Lindsay has washed by adding the socks from pairs and the loose socks:
   \[
   \text{Total socks washed} = \text{Socks from pairs} + \text{Loose socks} = 20 \text{ socks} + 15 \text{ socks} = 35 \text{ socks}
   \]

5. **Socks Missed**: To find out how many socks Lindsay has missed, we subtract the total number of socks washed from the total number of socks that needed washing:
   \[
   \text{Socks missed} = \text{Total socks} - \text{Total socks washed} = 50 \text{ socks} - 35 \text{ socks} = 15 \text{ socks}
   \]

Thus, the final answer is that Lindsay has missed **15 socks**.
