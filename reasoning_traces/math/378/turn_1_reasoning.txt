==================================================

To determine Uki's total earnings for five days, we need to calculate her daily earnings from each type of baked good and then sum these amounts over the five-day period.

**Step 1: Calculate Daily Earnings from Each Type of Baked Good**

1. **Cupcakes:**
   - Price per cupcake = $1.50
   - Average number of cupcakes baked per day = 20

   Daily earnings from cupcakes = Price per cupcake × Number of cupcakes
   \[
   \text{Daily earnings from cupcakes} = 1.50 \times 20 = 30 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Cookies:**
   - Price per packet of cookies = $2
   - Average number of packets of cookies baked per day = 10

   Daily earnings from cookies = Price per packet × Number of packets
   \[
   \text{Daily earnings from cookies} = 2 \times 10 = 20 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Biscuits:**
   - Price per packet of biscuits = $1
   - Average number of packets of biscuits baked per day = 20

   Daily earnings from biscuits = Price per packet × Number of packets
   \[
   \text{Daily earnings from biscuits} = 1 \times 20 = 20 \text{ dollars}
   \]

**Step 2: Calculate Total Daily Earnings**

Total daily earnings = Earnings from cupcakes + Earnings from cookies + Earnings from biscuits
\[
\text{Total daily earnings} = 30 + 20 + 20 = 70 \text{ dollars}
\]

**Step 3: Calculate Total Earnings for Five Days**

Total earnings for five days = Total daily earnings × Number of days
\[
\text{Total earnings for five days} = 70 \times 5 = 350 \text{ dollars}
\]

Therefore, Uki's total earnings for five days are \(\boxed{350}\) dollars.
