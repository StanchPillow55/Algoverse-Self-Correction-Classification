==================================================

To calculate Uki's total earnings for five days, we need to determine her daily earnings from each type of baked good and then multiply that by five.

### Step 1: Calculate Daily Earnings

1. **Cupcakes**:
   - Price per cupcake: $1.50
   - Average number of cupcakes baked per day: 20
   - Daily earnings from cupcakes:
     \[
     \text{Earnings from cupcakes} = \text{Price per cupcake} \times \text{Number of cupcakes}
     \]
     \[
     = 1.50 \times 20 = 30 \text{ dollars}
     \]

2. **Cookies**:
   - Price per packet of cookies: $2
   - Average number of packets of cookies baked per day: 10
   - Daily earnings from cookies:
     \[
     \text{Earnings from cookies} = \text{Price per packet} \times \text{Number of packets}
     \]
     \[
     = 2 \times 10 = 20 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Biscuits**:
   - Price per packet of biscuits: $1
   - Average number of packets of biscuits baked per day: 20
   - Daily earnings from biscuits:
     \[
     \text{Earnings from biscuits} = \text{Price per packet} \times \text{Number of packets}
     \]
     \[
     = 1 \times 20 = 20 \text{ dollars}
     \]

### Step 2: Calculate Total Daily Earnings

Now, we sum up the daily earnings from cupcakes, cookies, and biscuits:
\[
\text{Total Daily Earnings} = \text{Earnings from cupcakes} + \text{Earnings from cookies} + \text{Earnings from biscuits}
\]
\[
= 30 + 20 + 20 = 70 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate Total Earnings for Five Days

To find the total earnings for five days, we multiply the total daily earnings by 5:
\[
\text{Total Earnings for 5 Days} = \text{Total Daily Earnings} \times 5
\]
\[
= 70 \times 5 = 350 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Final Answer

Uki's total earnings for five days will be **$350**.
