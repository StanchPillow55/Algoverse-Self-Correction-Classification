Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To determine Uki's total earnings for five days, we need to calculate her daily earnings from selling cupcakes, cookies, and biscuits, and then multiply that by five.

### Step 1: Calculate Daily Earnings

**1. Earnings from Cupcakes:**
- Price per cupcake = $1.50
- Average number of cupcakes baked per day = 20

Daily earnings from cupcakes:
\[
\text{Earnings from cupcakes} = \text{Price per cupcake} \times \text{Number of cupcakes}
\]
\[
\text{Earnings from cupcakes} = 1.50 \times 20 = 30 \text{ dollars}
\]

**2. Earnings from Cookies:**
- Price per packet of cookies = $2
- Average number of packets of cookies baked per day = 10

Daily earnings from cookies:
\[
\text{Earnings from cookies} = \text{Price per packet} \times \text{Number of packets}
\]
\[
\text{Earnings from cookies} = 2 \times 10 = 20 \text{ dollars}
\]

**3. Earnings from Biscuits:**
- Price per packet of biscuits = $1
- Average number of packets of biscuits baked per day = 20

Daily earnings from biscuits:
\[
\text{Earnings from biscuits} = \text{Price per packet} \times \text{Number of packets}
\]
\[
\text{Earnings from biscuits} = 1 \times 20 = 20 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate Total Daily Earnings

Now, we add up the daily earnings from cupcakes, cookies, and biscuits:
\[
\text{Total Daily Earnings} = \text{Earnings from cupcakes} + \text{Earnings from cookies} + \text{Earnings from biscuits}
\]
\[
\text{Total Daily Earnings} = 30 + 20 + 20 = 70 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate Total Earnings for Five Days

To find the total earnings for five days, we multiply the total daily earnings by 5:
\[
\text{Total Earnings for 5 Days} = \text{Total Daily Earnings} \times 5
\]
\[
\text{Total Earnings for 5 Days} = 70 \times 5 = 350 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Final Answer

Uki's total earnings for five days will be **$350**.
