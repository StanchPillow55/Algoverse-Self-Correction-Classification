Question ID: 378
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to calculate Uki's total earnings from selling cupcakes, cookies, and biscuits over a period of five days. We will break down the problem step by step.

### Step 1: Calculate Daily Earnings

**Cupcakes:**
- Price per cupcake = $1.50
- Average number of cupcakes baked per day = 20

Daily earnings from cupcakes:
\[ 20 \text{ cupcakes} \times \$1.50/\text{cupcake} = \$30 \]

**Cookies:**
- Price per packet of cookies = $2
- Average number of packets of cookies baked per day = 10

Daily earnings from cookies:
\[ 10 \text{ packets} \times \$2/\text{packet} = \$20 \]

**Biscuits:**
- Price per packet of biscuits = $1
- Average number of packets of biscuits baked per day = 20

Daily earnings from biscuits:
\[ 20 \text{ packets} \times \$1/\text{packet} = \$20 \]

### Step 2: Calculate Total Daily Earnings

Now, we sum up the daily earnings from cupcakes, cookies, and biscuits:

\[ \$30 \text{ (cupcakes)} + \$20 \text{ (cookies)} + \$20 \text{ (biscuits)} = \$70 \]

Uki earns $70 per day from selling all her baked goods.

### Step 3: Calculate Total Earnings for Five Days

To find the total earnings over five days, we multiply the daily earnings by the number of days:

\[ \$70/\text{day} \times 5 \text{ days} = \$350 \]

### Final Answer

Uki's total earnings for five days will be \(\$350\).

Thus, the final answer is:
\[ \boxed{\$350} \]
