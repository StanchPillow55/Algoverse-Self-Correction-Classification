To determine how much Ali has to pay John for the wooden tables and roof frames, we will calculate the total cost for each item separately and then sum them up.

1. **Calculate the cost of the wooden tables:**
   - John manufactured 4 wooden tables.
   - The cost of each wooden table is $20.
   - To find the total cost for the tables, we multiply the number of tables by the cost per table:
     \[
     \text{Total cost of tables} = \text{Number of tables} \times \text{Cost per table} = 4 \times 20
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total cost of tables} = 80
     \]

2. **Calculate the cost of the roof frames:**
   - John manufactured 2 roof frames.
   - The cost of each roof frame is $10.
   - To find the total cost for the roof frames, we multiply the number of roof frames by the cost per frame:
     \[
     \text{Total cost of roof frames} = \text{Number of roof frames} \times \text{Cost per frame} = 2 \times 10
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total cost of roof frames} = 20
     \]

3. **Calculate the total amount Ali has to pay John:**
   - Now we add the total cost of the tables and the total cost of the roof frames:
     \[
     \text{Total amount to pay} = \text{Total cost of tables} + \text{Total cost of roof frames} = 80 + 20
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total amount to pay} = 100
     \]

Therefore, the final amount that Ali has to pay John is **$100**.
