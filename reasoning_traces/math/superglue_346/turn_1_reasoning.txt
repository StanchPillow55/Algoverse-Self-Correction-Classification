==================================================

To solve the problem, we first need to understand what "Sample reasoning question 346" refers to. However, since the problem statement doesn't provide any specific details or context about "Sample reasoning question 346," we need to make some assumptions or ask for clarification.

Assuming "Sample reasoning question 346" is a placeholder for a specific math problem, let's consider a generic approach to solving a math problem:

1. **Identify the Problem Type**: Determine whether the problem is algebraic, geometric, statistical, etc. This will guide the methods and formulas we use.

2. **Understand the Given Information**: List out all the known values and conditions provided in the problem. This might include numbers, equations, or relationships between variables.

3. **Determine What Needs to be Found**: Clearly state what the problem is asking for. This could be a specific value, a proof, or a general solution.

4. **Plan a Solution Strategy**: Based on the type of problem and the given information, decide on a method to solve it. This might involve setting up equations, drawing diagrams, or applying specific theorems.

5. **Execute the Plan**: Carry out the calculations or logical steps needed to solve the problem. Show all work, including intermediate steps and justifications for each step.

6. **Check the Solution**: Verify that the solution is correct and satisfies all the conditions of the problem. This might involve plugging values back into equations or checking the logic of a proof.

7. **State the Final Answer**: Clearly present the final answer, ensuring it is in the correct form and units, if applicable.

Since we don't have specific details about "Sample reasoning question 346," we can't apply these steps to a particular problem. If you have more information or a specific math problem you'd like to solve, please provide the details, and I can work through it step by step.
