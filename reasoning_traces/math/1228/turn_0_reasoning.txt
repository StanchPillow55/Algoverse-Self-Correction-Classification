==================================================

Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Identify the variables**:
   - Let \( S \) represent the number of paintings Samantha has.
   - Let \( H \) represent the number of paintings Shelley has.
   - Let \( K \) represent the number of paintings Kim has.

2. **Translate the problem into equations**:
   - We know from the problem that Samantha has 12 fewer paintings than Shelley:
     \[
     S = H - 12
     \]
   - We also know that Shelley has 8 paintings more than Kim:
     \[
     H = K + 8
     \]
   - We are given that Samantha has 27 paintings:
     \[
     S = 27
     \]

3. **Substitute the value of \( S \) into the first equation**:
   \[
   27 = H - 12
   \]
   To find \( H \), we add 12 to both sides:
   \[
   H = 27 + 12
   \]
   \[
   H = 39
   \]

4. **Now substitute the value of \( H \) into the second equation**:
   \[
   39 = K + 8
   \]
   To find \( K \), we subtract 8 from both sides:
   \[
   K = 39 - 8
   \]
   \[
   K = 31
   \]

5. **Conclusion**:
   Kim has \( K = 31 \) paintings.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{31}
\]
