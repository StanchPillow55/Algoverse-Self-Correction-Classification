==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to determine the total amount of rain Greg experienced while camping and compare it to the amount of rain that fell at his house during the same week.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Calculate the Total Rainfall While Camping:**

   Greg experienced rain on three days with the following amounts:
   - Day 1: 3 mm
   - Day 2: 6 mm
   - Day 3: 5 mm

   To find the total rainfall while camping, we sum these amounts:
   \[
   \text{Total Rainfall While Camping} = 3 \, \text{mm} + 6 \, \text{mm} + 5 \, \text{mm}
   \]

   \[
   \text{Total Rainfall While Camping} = 14 \, \text{mm}
   \]

2. **Determine the Rainfall at Greg's House:**

   According to the problem, it rained 26 mm at Greg's house during the same week.

3. **Calculate the Difference in Rainfall:**

   We need to find out how much less rain Greg experienced while camping compared to his house. This is done by subtracting the total rainfall while camping from the rainfall at his house:
   \[
   \text{Difference in Rainfall} = \text{Rainfall at House} - \text{Total Rainfall While Camping}
   \]

   \[
   \text{Difference in Rainfall} = 26 \, \text{mm} - 14 \, \text{mm}
   \]

   \[
   \text{Difference in Rainfall} = 12 \, \text{mm}
   \]

### Final Answer:

Greg experienced 12 mm less rain while camping compared to the amount of rain that fell at his house during the same week.
