To determine how much less rain Greg experienced while camping compared to the amount of rain at his house, we will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total amount of rain Greg experienced while camping.**
   - Greg experienced rain on three days with the following amounts:
     - Day 1: 3 mm
     - Day 2: 6 mm
     - Day 3: 5 mm
   - We will sum these amounts to find the total rain Greg experienced.

   \[
   \text{Total rain while camping} = 3 \text{ mm} + 6 \text{ mm} + 5 \text{ mm}
   \]

   Performing the addition:

   \[
   3 + 6 = 9
   \]
   \[
   9 + 5 = 14
   \]

   Thus, the total amount of rain Greg experienced while camping is **14 mm**.

2. **Identify the total amount of rain at Greg's house.**
   - According to the problem, it rained **26 mm** at Greg's house.

3. **Calculate the difference in rain amounts.**
   - To find out how much less rain Greg experienced while camping compared to the rain at his house, we will subtract the total rain while camping from the total rain at his house.

   \[
   \text{Difference} = \text{Rain at house} - \text{Rain while camping}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Difference} = 26 \text{ mm} - 14 \text{ mm}
   \]

   Performing the subtraction:

   \[
   26 - 14 = 12
   \]

4. **State the final answer.**
   - Therefore, Greg experienced **12 mm** less rain while camping compared to the amount of rain at his house.

Final answer: **12 mm**.
