==================================================

To find the cost per serving of Antoine's French onion soup, we need to calculate the total cost of the ingredients and then divide that by the number of servings.

### Step 1: Calculate the amount of onions needed
Antoine's original recipe calls for 2 pounds of onions. Since he likes to double that amount, we calculate:

\[
\text{Amount of onions} = 2 \text{ pounds} \times 2 = 4 \text{ pounds}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the cost of the onions
The price of onions is $2.00 per pound. Therefore, the total cost for the onions is:

\[
\text{Cost of onions} = 4 \text{ pounds} \times 2.00 \text{ dollars/pound} = 8.00 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the cost of the beef stock
Antoine needs 2 boxes of beef stock, and each box costs $2.00. Thus, the total cost for the beef stock is:

\[
\text{Cost of beef stock} = 2 \text{ boxes} \times 2.00 \text{ dollars/box} = 4.00 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the total cost of ingredients
Now, we add the cost of the onions and the cost of the beef stock to find the total cost of the ingredients:

\[
\text{Total cost} = \text{Cost of onions} + \text{Cost of beef stock} = 8.00 \text{ dollars} + 4.00 \text{ dollars} = 12.00 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Step 5: Calculate the number of servings
The recipe serves 6 people.

### Step 6: Calculate the cost per serving
To find the cost per serving, we divide the total cost by the number of servings:

\[
\text{Cost per serving} = \frac{\text{Total cost}}{\text{Number of servings}} = \frac{12.00 \text{ dollars}}{6} = 2.00 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Final Answer
The cost per serving of Antoine's French onion soup is:

\[
\boxed{2}
\]
