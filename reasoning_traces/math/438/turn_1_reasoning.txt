Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to compare the total amount of rain Greg experienced while camping with the amount of rain that fell at his house during the same week. We will calculate the total rainfall for both locations and then find the difference.

**Step 1: Calculate the total rainfall while camping.**

Greg experienced rain on three days while camping, with the following amounts:
- Day 1: 3 mm
- Day 2: 6 mm
- Day 3: 5 mm

To find the total rainfall while camping, we add these amounts together:

\[
3 \, \text{mm} + 6 \, \text{mm} + 5 \, \text{mm} = 14 \, \text{mm}
\]

So, Greg experienced a total of 14 mm of rain while camping.

**Step 2: Identify the total rainfall at Greg's house.**

According to the problem, it rained 26 mm at Greg's house during the same week.

**Step 3: Calculate the difference in rainfall.**

To find out how much less rain Greg experienced while camping compared to his house, we subtract the total rainfall while camping from the total rainfall at his house:

\[
26 \, \text{mm} - 14 \, \text{mm} = 12 \, \text{mm}
\]

**Conclusion:**

Greg experienced 12 mm less rain while camping compared to the rain at his house. Therefore, the final answer is:

Greg experienced 12 mm less rain while camping.
