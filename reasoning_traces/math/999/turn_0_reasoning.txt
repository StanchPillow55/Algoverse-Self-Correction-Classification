To solve the problem, we need to determine how to divide the watermelon among the 2 adults and 4 kids, given that each adult receives a slice that is twice as big as that of each kid.

Let's denote the size of each kid's slice as \( k \). Since there are 4 kids, the total size of the slices for the kids can be expressed as:

\[
\text{Total size for kids} = 4k
\]

Since each adult gets a slice that is twice as big as that of each kid, the size of each adult's slice can be expressed as \( 2k \). With 2 adults, the total size of the slices for the adults can be expressed as:

\[
\text{Total size for adults} = 2 \times (2k) = 4k
\]

Now, we can find the total size of the watermelon by adding the total sizes for both the adults and the kids:

\[
\text{Total size of watermelon} = \text{Total size for kids} + \text{Total size for adults} = 4k + 4k = 8k
\]

Next, we need to find out what percentage of the watermelon each adult gets. Since each adult receives a slice of size \( 2k \), we can calculate the percentage of the watermelon that each adult receives as follows:

1. The size of each adult's slice is \( 2k \).
2. The total size of the watermelon is \( 8k \).

The fraction of the watermelon that each adult receives is:

\[
\text{Fraction for each adult} = \frac{2k}{8k} = \frac{2}{8} = \frac{1}{4}
\]

To convert this fraction into a percentage, we multiply by 100:

\[
\text{Percentage for each adult} = \frac{1}{4} \times 100 = 25\%
\]

Thus, each adult gets 25% of the watermelon.

### Final Answer:
Each adult gets **25%** of the watermelon.
