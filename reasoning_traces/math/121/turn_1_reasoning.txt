==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine how many hours it takes to fill the truck with 6000 stone blocks given the rate at which Stella, Twinkle, and the additional workers can fill it.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Initial Work by Stella and Twinkle:**
   - Stella and Twinkle each work at a rate of 250 blocks per hour.
   - Together, their combined rate is:
     \[
     250 \text{ blocks/hour} + 250 \text{ blocks/hour} = 500 \text{ blocks/hour}
     \]
   - They work alone for 4 hours, so the total number of blocks they fill in this time is:
     \[
     500 \text{ blocks/hour} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 2000 \text{ blocks}
     \]

2. **Remaining Blocks to Fill:**
   - The truck's total capacity is 6000 blocks. After the initial 4 hours, the remaining number of blocks to fill is:
     \[
     6000 \text{ blocks} - 2000 \text{ blocks} = 4000 \text{ blocks}
     \]

3. **Adding Additional Workers:**
   - After 4 hours, 6 additional people join Stella and Twinkle. Now, there are 8 people working.
   - Each person works at a rate of 250 blocks per hour, so the new combined rate is:
     \[
     8 \text{ people} \times 250 \text{ blocks/hour} = 2000 \text{ blocks/hour}
     \]

4. **Time to Fill Remaining Blocks:**
   - To fill the remaining 4000 blocks at a rate of 2000 blocks per hour, the time required is:
     \[
     \frac{4000 \text{ blocks}}{2000 \text{ blocks/hour}} = 2 \text{ hours}
     \]

5. **Total Time Taken:**
   - The total time to fill the truck is the initial 4 hours plus the additional 2 hours:
     \[
     4 \text{ hours} + 2 \text{ hours} = 6 \text{ hours}
     \]

### Final Answer:
The total time taken to fill the truck is 6 hours.
