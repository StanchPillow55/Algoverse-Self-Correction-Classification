==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to calculate how many hours it takes to fill the truck with stone blocks given the rates at which Stella, Twinkle, and the additional people work.

### Step 1: Calculate the initial work done by Stella and Twinkle

Stella and Twinkle each work at a rate of 250 blocks per hour. Together, their combined rate is:
\[ 250 \, \text{blocks/hour} + 250 \, \text{blocks/hour} = 500 \, \text{blocks/hour} \]

They work together for 4 hours before the additional people join. Therefore, the total number of blocks they fill in these 4 hours is:
\[ 500 \, \text{blocks/hour} \times 4 \, \text{hours} = 2000 \, \text{blocks} \]

### Step 2: Calculate the remaining blocks to be filled

The truck has a total capacity of 6000 blocks. After the initial 4 hours, 2000 blocks have been filled, so the remaining number of blocks to be filled is:
\[ 6000 \, \text{blocks} - 2000 \, \text{blocks} = 4000 \, \text{blocks} \]

### Step 3: Calculate the combined rate of all workers after 4 hours

After 4 hours, Stella and Twinkle are joined by 6 other people. This means there are now 8 people working, each at a rate of 250 blocks per hour. The combined rate of all 8 people is:
\[ 8 \times 250 \, \text{blocks/hour} = 2000 \, \text{blocks/hour} \]

### Step 4: Calculate the time taken to fill the remaining blocks

With a combined rate of 2000 blocks per hour, we need to find out how many hours it takes to fill the remaining 4000 blocks:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Remaining blocks}}{\text{Combined rate}} = \frac{4000 \, \text{blocks}}{2000 \, \text{blocks/hour}} = 2 \, \text{hours} \]

### Step 5: Calculate the total time taken

The total time taken to fill the truck is the initial 4 hours plus the additional 2 hours:
\[ 4 \, \text{hours} + 2 \, \text{hours} = 6 \, \text{hours} \]

### Final Answer

The total time taken to fill the truck is 6 hours.
