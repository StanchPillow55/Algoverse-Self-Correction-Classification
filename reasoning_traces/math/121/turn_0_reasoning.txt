==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to determine how many fruits Morisette and Kael brought in total. We will break this down step by step.

1. **Identify the number of fruits Morisette brought:**
   - Morisette brought 5 apples and 8 oranges.
   - Total fruits brought by Morisette = Number of apples + Number of oranges
   \[
   \text{Total fruits by Morisette} = 5 + 8 = 13
   \]

2. **Determine the number of fruits Kael brought:**
   - Kael brought twice the amount of apples as Morisette. Since Morisette brought 5 apples:
   \[
   \text{Apples brought by Kael} = 2 \times 5 = 10
   \]
   - Kael brought half the number of oranges as Morisette. Since Morisette brought 8 oranges:
   \[
   \text{Oranges brought by Kael} = \frac{8}{2} = 4
   \]
   - Total fruits brought by Kael = Number of apples + Number of oranges
   \[
   \text{Total fruits by Kael} = 10 + 4 = 14
   \]

3. **Calculate the total number of fruits brought by both Morisette and Kael:**
   - Total fruits = Total fruits by Morisette + Total fruits by Kael
   \[
   \text{Total fruits} = 13 + 14 = 27
   \]

Thus, the total number of fruits that Morisette and Kael have together is \( \boxed{27} \).
