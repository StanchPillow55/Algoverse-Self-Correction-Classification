To solve the problem, we will break it down into steps and calculate how many stone blocks are filled in each phase of the work.

1. **Initial Setup**:
   - Capacity of the truck: 6000 stone blocks
   - Rate per person: 250 blocks per hour
   - Initial workers: Stella and Twinkle (2 people)
   - Additional workers: 6 people (joined after 4 hours)

2. **Calculate the work done in the first 4 hours**:
   - Number of workers initially: 2 (Stella and Twinkle)
   - Rate of work for 2 people: 
     \[
     \text{Rate} = 2 \text{ people} \times 250 \text{ blocks/hour/person} = 500 \text{ blocks/hour}
     \]
   - Work done in 4 hours:
     \[
     \text{Work} = \text{Rate} \times \text{Time} = 500 \text{ blocks/hour} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 2000 \text{ blocks}
     \]

3. **Calculate remaining blocks after 4 hours**:
   - Total blocks filled after 4 hours: 2000 blocks
   - Remaining blocks to fill:
     \[
     \text{Remaining blocks} = 6000 \text{ blocks} - 2000 \text{ blocks} = 4000 \text{ blocks}
     \]

4. **Calculate the new number of workers**:
   - After 4 hours, 6 more people join Stella and Twinkle, making the total number of workers:
     \[
     \text{Total workers} = 2 + 6 = 8 \text{ people}
     \]

5. **Calculate the rate of work with 8 people**:
   - Rate of work for 8 people:
     \[
     \text{Rate} = 8 \text{ people} \times 250 \text{ blocks/hour/person} = 2000 \text{ blocks/hour}
     \]

6. **Calculate the time required to fill the remaining blocks**:
   - Time required to fill the remaining 4000 blocks:
     \[
     \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Remaining blocks}}{\text{Rate}} = \frac{4000 \text{ blocks}}{2000 \text{ blocks/hour}} = 2 \text{ hours}
     \]

7. **Calculate the total time taken to fill the truck**:
   - Total time = Time for the first 4 hours + Time for the remaining blocks:
     \[
     \text{Total time} = 4 \text{ hours} + 2 \text{ hours} = 6 \text{ hours}
     \]

Thus, the total time taken to fill the truck is **6 hours**.

Final answer: **6 hours**.
