To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total time it takes to fill the truck with stone blocks, given the rates at which Stella, Twinkle, and the additional people work.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Determine the initial rate of filling:**
   - Stella and Twinkle each fill at a rate of 250 blocks per hour.
   - Combined, they fill at a rate of \(250 + 250 = 500\) blocks per hour.

2. **Calculate the number of blocks filled in the first four hours:**
   - Since they work together for 4 hours, the total number of blocks filled in this time is:
   \[
   500 \text{ blocks/hour} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 2000 \text{ blocks}
   \]

3. **Calculate the remaining blocks to be filled:**
   - The truck's total capacity is 6000 blocks. After the first 4 hours, the remaining blocks to be filled are:
   \[
   6000 \text{ blocks} - 2000 \text{ blocks} = 4000 \text{ blocks}
   \]

4. **Determine the new rate of filling after 6 more people join:**
   - With 6 additional people, there are now 8 people working (Stella, Twinkle, and 6 others).
   - Each person fills at a rate of 250 blocks per hour, so the combined rate for 8 people is:
   \[
   8 \times 250 = 2000 \text{ blocks per hour}
   \]

5. **Calculate the time required to fill the remaining blocks:**
   - To fill the remaining 4000 blocks at a rate of 2000 blocks per hour, the time required is:
   \[
   \frac{4000 \text{ blocks}}{2000 \text{ blocks/hour}} = 2 \text{ hours}
   \]

6. **Calculate the total time taken to fill the truck:**
   - The total time is the sum of the initial 4 hours plus the additional 2 hours:
   \[
   4 \text{ hours} + 2 \text{ hours} = 6 \text{ hours}
   \]

### Final Answer:
The total time taken to fill the truck is 6 hours.
