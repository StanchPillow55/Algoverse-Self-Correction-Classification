==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine how many hours it takes to fill a truck with a capacity of 6000 stone blocks, given the rates at which Stella, Twinkle, and additional workers fill the truck.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Initial Work by Stella and Twinkle:**
   - Stella and Twinkle each fill at a rate of 250 blocks per hour.
   - Together, their combined rate is:
     \[
     250 \, \text{blocks/hour} + 250 \, \text{blocks/hour} = 500 \, \text{blocks/hour}
     \]
   - They work together for 4 hours initially, so the total number of blocks they fill in this time is:
     \[
     500 \, \text{blocks/hour} \times 4 \, \text{hours} = 2000 \, \text{blocks}
     \]

2. **Remaining Blocks to be Filled:**
   - The truck's total capacity is 6000 blocks, and 2000 blocks have already been filled.
   - Therefore, the remaining number of blocks to be filled is:
     \[
     6000 \, \text{blocks} - 2000 \, \text{blocks} = 4000 \, \text{blocks}
     \]

3. **Adding More Workers:**
   - After 4 hours, 6 additional workers join Stella and Twinkle.
   - Now, there are 8 people working, each at a rate of 250 blocks per hour.
   - The new combined rate is:
     \[
     8 \times 250 \, \text{blocks/hour} = 2000 \, \text{blocks/hour}
     \]

4. **Time to Fill Remaining Blocks:**
   - With 4000 blocks remaining and a combined rate of 2000 blocks per hour, the time required to fill the remaining blocks is:
     \[
     \frac{4000 \, \text{blocks}}{2000 \, \text{blocks/hour}} = 2 \, \text{hours}
     \]

5. **Total Time to Fill the Truck:**
   - The total time taken to fill the truck is the initial 4 hours plus the additional 2 hours:
     \[
     4 \, \text{hours} + 2 \, \text{hours} = 6 \, \text{hours}
     \]

### Final Answer:
The total time taken to fill the truck is 6 hours.
