Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we first need to understand what "Sample reasoning question 393" entails. However, since there is no specific mathematical problem or context provided in the question, I'll demonstrate a general approach to solving a typical math problem by creating an example problem and solving it step-by-step.

**Example Problem:**

Calculate the value of \( x \) in the equation:

\[ 3x + 5 = 20 \]

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Equation:**
   The equation given is a linear equation in one variable, \( x \). Our goal is to isolate \( x \) on one side of the equation to find its value.

2. **Isolate the Variable:**
   To isolate \( x \), we need to perform operations that will leave \( x \) alone on one side of the equation. We start by eliminating the constant term on the left side.

   \[ 3x + 5 = 20 \]

   Subtract 5 from both sides to remove the constant term from the left side:

   \[ 3x + 5 - 5 = 20 - 5 \]

   Simplifying both sides gives:

   \[ 3x = 15 \]

3. **Solve for \( x \):**
   Now, we need to solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides of the equation by the coefficient of \( x \), which is 3.

   \[ \frac{3x}{3} = \frac{15}{3} \]

   Simplifying both sides gives:

   \[ x = 5 \]

4. **Verify the Solution:**
   To ensure that our solution is correct, we substitute \( x = 5 \) back into the original equation to check if both sides are equal.

   Substitute \( x = 5 \) into the original equation:

   \[ 3(5) + 5 = 20 \]

   Simplify the left side:

   \[ 15 + 5 = 20 \]

   \[ 20 = 20 \]

   Since both sides of the equation are equal, our solution is verified.

**Final Answer:**

The value of \( x \) is \( 5 \).
