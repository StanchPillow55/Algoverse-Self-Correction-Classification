==================================================

To solve the problem effectively, I need to understand the context and details of "Sample reasoning question 393." However, since the question is not provided, I'll demonstrate a general approach to solving a typical math problem by outlining the steps and reasoning involved. Let's assume a hypothetical math problem and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**

A rectangle has a length that is 3 times its width. If the perimeter of the rectangle is 48 units, what are the dimensions of the rectangle?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We are given a rectangle with a specific relationship between its length and width.
   - The perimeter of the rectangle is provided.

2. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( w \) be the width of the rectangle.
   - Since the length is 3 times the width, let the length be \( 3w \).

3. **Use the Perimeter Formula:**
   - The formula for the perimeter \( P \) of a rectangle is given by:
     \[
     P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width})
     \]
   - Substitute the known values into the formula:
     \[
     48 = 2 \times (3w + w)
     \]

4. **Simplify and Solve for \( w \):**
   - Simplify the expression inside the parentheses:
     \[
     48 = 2 \times (4w)
     \]
   - Further simplify:
     \[
     48 = 8w
     \]
   - Solve for \( w \) by dividing both sides by 8:
     \[
     w = \frac{48}{8} = 6
     \]

5. **Find the Length:**
   - Since the length is 3 times the width:
     \[
     \text{Length} = 3w = 3 \times 6 = 18
     \]

6. **Verify the Solution:**
   - Check if the calculated dimensions satisfy the perimeter condition:
     \[
     P = 2 \times (18 + 6) = 2 \times 24 = 48
     \]
   - The perimeter matches the given value, confirming our solution is correct.

7. **State the Final Answer:**
   - The dimensions of the rectangle are:
     - Width = 6 units
     - Length = 18 units

This approach demonstrates a structured method to solve a math problem by defining variables, applying relevant formulas, solving equations, and verifying the solution. If you have a specific problem or question in mind, please provide the details, and I can work through that particular problem.
