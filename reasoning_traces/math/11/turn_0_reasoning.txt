==================================================

First, we need to find out how much money Tobias had before he bought the shoes. We know that he had $15 in change after buying the shoes, so he must have had $95 (the cost of the shoes) + $15 (the change) = $110 before buying the shoes.

Next, we need to find out how much money Tobias earned from his allowance. He gets $5 a month and he has been saving for 3 months, so he earned $5 * 3 = $15 from his allowance.

We also know that Tobias mowed 4 lawns and charged $15 for each, so he earned $15 * 4 = $60 from mowing lawns.

Now, we need to find out how much money Tobias earned from shoveling driveways. We know that he had $110 in total, and we know that he earned $15 from his allowance and $60 from mowing lawns. So, he must have earned $110 - $15 - $60 = $35 from shoveling driveways.

Finally, we need to find out how many driveways Tobias shoveled. He charges $7 to shovel a driveway, so he must have shoveled $35 / $7 = 5 driveways.

Therefore, Tobias shoveled 5 driveways.
