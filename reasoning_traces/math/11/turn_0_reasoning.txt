To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step.

1. **Calculate Tobias's total savings from his allowance:**
   - Tobias receives a $5 allowance each month.
   - He has been saving for 3 months.
   \[
   \text{Total from allowance} = 5 \text{ dollars/month} \times 3 \text{ months} = 15 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Calculate the income from mowing lawns:**
   - Tobias mows 4 lawns and charges $15 per lawn.
   \[
   \text{Income from mowing} = 15 \text{ dollars/lawn} \times 4 \text{ lawns} = 60 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Let \( d \) be the number of driveways he shovels.** 
   - He charges $7 to shovel a driveway.
   \[
   \text{Income from shoveling} = 7 \text{ dollars/driveway} \times d \text{ driveways} = 7d \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Calculate Tobias's total income:**
   - His total income is the sum of his allowance, income from mowing lawns, and income from shoveling driveways.
   \[
   \text{Total income} = \text{Total from allowance} + \text{Income from mowing} + \text{Income from shoveling}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total income} = 15 + 60 + 7d
   \]

5. **Determine the total amount he has after buying the shoes:**
   - The shoes cost $95, and after buying them, he has $15 left.
   \[
   \text{Total income} - 95 = 15
   \]

6. **Set up the equation:**
   \[
   15 + 60 + 7d - 95 = 15
   \]

7. **Simplify the equation:**
   \[
   75 + 7d - 95 = 15
   \]
   \[
   7d - 20 = 15
   \]

8. **Solve for \( d \):**
   \[
   7d = 15 + 20
   \]
   \[
   7d = 35
   \]
   \[
   d = \frac{35}{7} = 5
   \]

Thus, the number of driveways Tobias shovels is \( \boxed{5} \).
