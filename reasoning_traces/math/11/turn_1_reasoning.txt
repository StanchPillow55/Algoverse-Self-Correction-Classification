Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine how many driveways Tobias shoveled. We know the following:

1. The cost of the shoes is $95.
2. After buying the shoes, Tobias has $15 left.
3. Therefore, Tobias had $95 + $15 = $110 before buying the shoes.
4. Tobias receives a $5 allowance each month for three months, so he gets \(3 \times 5 = 15\) dollars from his allowance.
5. Tobias mows 4 lawns, and he charges $15 per lawn. Therefore, from mowing lawns, he earns \(4 \times 15 = 60\) dollars.

Now, let's calculate how much money Tobias earned from shoveling driveways:

- Total money Tobias had before buying the shoes: $110
- Money from allowance: $15
- Money from mowing lawns: $60

Let \( x \) be the number of driveways shoveled. Tobias charges $7 per driveway, so he earns \( 7x \) dollars from shoveling driveways.

The total money Tobias has is the sum of his allowance, money from mowing lawns, and money from shoveling driveways:

\[
15 + 60 + 7x = 110
\]

Now, solve for \( x \):

\[
75 + 7x = 110
\]

Subtract 75 from both sides:

\[
7x = 35
\]

Divide both sides by 7:

\[
x = 5
\]

Therefore, Tobias shoveled 5 driveways.

Final Answer: Tobias shoveled 5 driveways.
