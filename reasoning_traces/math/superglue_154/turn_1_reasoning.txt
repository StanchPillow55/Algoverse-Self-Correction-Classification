Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, I need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 154" refers to. However, since I don't have the specific details of the question, I'll demonstrate a general approach to solving a math problem by considering a hypothetical example. Let's assume "Sample reasoning question 154" is a math problem involving solving a quadratic equation. Here's how I would approach it:

### Problem:
Solve the quadratic equation: \(2x^2 - 4x - 6 = 0\).

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Identify the quadratic equation**: The given equation is \(2x^2 - 4x - 6 = 0\).

2. **Simplify the equation**: Check if the equation can be simplified by dividing all terms by a common factor. In this case, all terms are divisible by 2:
   \[
   \frac{2x^2}{2} - \frac{4x}{2} - \frac{6}{2} = 0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad x^2 - 2x - 3 = 0
   \]

3. **Factor the quadratic equation**: Look for two numbers that multiply to \(-3\) (the constant term) and add to \(-2\) (the coefficient of the linear term). The numbers \(-3\) and \(1\) satisfy these conditions:
   \[
   (x - 3)(x + 1) = 0
   \]

4. **Solve for \(x\)**: Set each factor equal to zero and solve for \(x\):
   \[
   x - 3 = 0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad x = 3
   \]
   \[
   x + 1 = 0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad x = -1
   \]

5. **Verify the solutions**: Substitute the solutions back into the original equation to ensure they satisfy it.
   - For \(x = 3\):
     \[
     2(3)^2 - 4(3) - 6 = 18 - 12 - 6 = 0
     \]
   - For \(x = -1\):
     \[
     2(-1)^2 - 4(-1) - 6 = 2 + 4 - 6 = 0
     \]

Both solutions satisfy the original equation.

### Final Answer:
The solutions to the quadratic equation \(2x^2 - 4x - 6 = 0\) are \(x = 3\) and \(x = -1\).

This is a general approach to solving a quadratic equation. If "Sample reasoning question 154" refers to a different type of problem, please provide more details so I can tailor the solution accordingly.
