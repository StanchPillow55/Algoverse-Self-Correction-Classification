==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 154" entails. Since no specific details or context are provided, I will assume this is a hypothetical or placeholder question. Therefore, I will create a sample math problem and solve it step by step.

Let's assume the problem is as follows:

**Problem:**
A store sells apples and oranges. An apple costs $0.50 and an orange costs $0.70. If a customer buys a total of 20 fruits consisting of apples and oranges and spends $11.00, how many apples and how many oranges did the customer buy?

**Solution:**

To solve this problem, we need to set up a system of equations based on the information given.

1. **Define the Variables:**
   - Let \( a \) be the number of apples.
   - Let \( o \) be the number of oranges.

2. **Set Up the Equations:**
   - The total number of fruits is 20:
     \[
     a + o = 20
     \]
   - The total cost of the fruits is $11.00:
     \[
     0.50a + 0.70o = 11.00
     \]

3. **Solve the System of Equations:**

   We have the following system of equations:
   \[
   \begin{align*}
   a + o &= 20 \quad \text{(Equation 1)} \\
   0.50a + 0.70o &= 11.00 \quad \text{(Equation 2)}
   \end{align*}
   \]

   **Step 1:** Solve Equation 1 for one of the variables, say \( a \):
   \[
   a = 20 - o
   \]

   **Step 2:** Substitute \( a = 20 - o \) into Equation 2:
   \[
   0.50(20 - o) + 0.70o = 11.00
   \]

   **Step 3:** Distribute and simplify:
   \[
   10 - 0.50o + 0.70o = 11.00
   \]

   **Step 4:** Combine like terms:
   \[
   10 + 0.20o = 11.00
   \]

   **Step 5:** Solve for \( o \):
   \[
   0.20o = 1.00
   \]
   \[
   o = \frac{1.00}{0.20} = 5
   \]

   **Step 6:** Substitute \( o = 5 \) back into Equation 1 to find \( a \):
   \[
   a + 5 = 20
   \]
   \[
   a = 15
   \]

4. **Conclusion:**
   The customer bought 15 apples and 5 oranges.

**Final Answer:**
The customer bought 15 apples and 5 oranges.
