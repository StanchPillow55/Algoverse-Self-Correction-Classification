==================================================

To solve the problem effectively, we need to understand the context and details of "Sample reasoning question 154." However, since the problem statement is not provided, I'll guide you through a generic approach to solving a reasoning problem, which you can adapt to the specific details of your question.

### Step-by-Step Approach:

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - Carefully read the problem statement.
   - Identify what is being asked.
   - Note any given data or conditions.

2. **Identify the Type of Problem:**
   - Determine if it is a logical reasoning, mathematical reasoning, pattern recognition, or another type of reasoning problem.

3. **Break Down the Problem:**
   - Divide the problem into smaller, manageable parts.
   - Analyze each part separately.

4. **Apply Relevant Concepts:**
   - Use mathematical formulas, logical rules, or reasoning techniques relevant to the problem type.
   - Consider drawing diagrams or charts if it helps visualize the problem.

5. **Perform Calculations:**
   - Execute any necessary calculations step by step.
   - Double-check calculations for accuracy.

6. **Synthesize Information:**
   - Combine insights from the smaller parts to form a complete solution.
   - Ensure that all conditions and constraints are satisfied.

7. **Verify the Solution:**
   - Review each step to ensure no errors were made.
   - Confirm that the solution answers the question posed.

8. **State the Final Answer:**
   - Clearly present the final answer, ensuring it is in the required format.

### Example Problem and Solution:

**Example Problem:**
If the sum of two numbers is 10 and their product is 21, what are the two numbers?

**Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We need to find two numbers whose sum is 10 and product is 21.

2. **Identify the Type of Problem:**
   - This is a system of equations problem involving basic algebra.

3. **Break Down the Problem:**
   - Let the two numbers be \( x \) and \( y \).
   - We have two equations:
     1. \( x + y = 10 \)
     2. \( xy = 21 \)

4. **Apply Relevant Concepts:**
   - Use substitution or elimination to solve the system of equations.

5. **Perform Calculations:**
   - From equation (1), express \( y \) in terms of \( x \): \( y = 10 - x \).
   - Substitute into equation (2): \( x(10 - x) = 21 \).
   - Simplify: \( 10x - x^2 = 21 \).
   - Rearrange: \( x^2 - 10x + 21 = 0 \).

6. **Solve the Quadratic Equation:**
   - Factor the quadratic: \( (x - 3)(x - 7) = 0 \).
   - Solutions are \( x = 3 \) and \( x = 7 \).

7. **Find Corresponding \( y \) Values:**
   - If \( x = 3 \), then \( y = 10 - 3 = 7 \).
   - If \( x = 7 \), then \( y = 10 - 7 = 3 \).

8. **Verify the Solution:**
   - Check: \( 3 + 7 = 10 \) and \( 3 \times 7 = 21 \).
   - Both conditions are satisfied.

9. **State the Final Answer:**
   - The two numbers are 3 and 7.

By following this structured approach, you can solve reasoning problems systematically. If you have the specific details of "Sample reasoning question 154," you can apply this method to find the solution.
