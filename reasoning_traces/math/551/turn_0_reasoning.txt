==================================================

To find out how much change Carly gets back after treating her friends, we need to calculate the total cost of her order and then subtract that from the amount she gives, which is a fifty-dollar bill.

### Step 1: Calculate the cost of the hamburgers
Carly orders 5 hamburgers at $4 each. The total cost for the hamburgers can be calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Cost of hamburgers} = \text{Number of hamburgers} \times \text{Cost per hamburger} = 5 \times 4 = 20 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the cost of the potato fries
Carly orders 10 packs of potato fries at $0.30 each. The total cost for the fries can be calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Cost of potato fries} = \text{Number of packs} \times \text{Cost per pack} = 10 \times 0.30 = 3 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the cost of the fruit drinks
Carly orders 5 cans of fruit drinks at $2 each. The total cost for the drinks can be calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Cost of fruit drinks} = \text{Number of cans} \times \text{Cost per can} = 5 \times 2 = 10 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the total cost of the order
Now, we sum up the costs of all the items:

\[
\text{Total cost} = \text{Cost of hamburgers} + \text{Cost of potato fries} + \text{Cost of fruit drinks}
\]
\[
\text{Total cost} = 20 + 3 + 10 = 33 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Step 5: Calculate the change Carly receives
Carly gives a fifty-dollar bill. To find out how much change she gets back, we subtract the total cost from the amount given:

\[
\text{Change} = \text{Amount given} - \text{Total cost}
\]
\[
\text{Change} = 50 - 33 = 17 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Final Answer
Carly gets back **$17** in change.
