==================================================

To determine how many branches Felix climbed per day, we first need to find out how many branches he climbed in total during the week.

1. **Calculate Total Branches Climbed**:
   Felix charges $0.25 per branch. If he made $105 in total, we can find the total number of branches he climbed by dividing his total earnings by the cost per branch.

   \[
   \text{Total branches climbed} = \frac{\text{Total earnings}}{\text{Cost per branch}} = \frac{105}{0.25}
   \]

   To perform the division, we can convert $0.25 to a fraction:

   \[
   0.25 = \frac{1}{4}
   \]

   Thus, dividing by $0.25 is the same as multiplying by 4:

   \[
   \text{Total branches climbed} = 105 \times 4 = 420
   \]

   So, Felix climbed a total of 420 branches during the week.

2. **Calculate Average Branches Climbed Per Day**:
   There are 7 days in a week. To find the average number of branches climbed per day, we divide the total number of branches climbed by the number of days in the week:

   \[
   \text{Average branches per day} = \frac{\text{Total branches climbed}}{\text{Number of days}} = \frac{420}{7}
   \]

   Performing the division:

   \[
   \text{Average branches per day} = 60
   \]

Thus, Felix climbed an average of 60 branches per day.

**Final Answer**: Felix climbed an average of 60 branches per day.
