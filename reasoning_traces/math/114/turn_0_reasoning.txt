==================================================

To find the total number of pets Ed has, we will break down the problem step by step.

1. **Identify the number of each type of pet:**
   - Ed has 2 dogs.
   - Ed has 3 cats.

2. **Calculate the total number of dogs and cats:**
   \[
   \text{Total dogs and cats} = \text{Number of dogs} + \text{Number of cats} = 2 + 3 = 5
   \]

3. **Determine the number of fish:**
   - According to the problem, Ed has twice as many fish as the total number of dogs and cats combined.
   - Since we found that the total number of dogs and cats is 5, we can calculate the number of fish as follows:
   \[
   \text{Number of fish} = 2 \times \text{Total dogs and cats} = 2 \times 5 = 10
   \]

4. **Calculate the total number of pets:**
   - Now we will add the number of dogs, cats, and fish together to find the total number of pets.
   \[
   \text{Total pets} = \text{Number of dogs} + \text{Number of cats} + \text{Number of fish} = 2 + 3 + 10 = 15
   \]

5. **Final answer:**
   - Therefore, the total number of pets Ed has is \( \boxed{15} \).
