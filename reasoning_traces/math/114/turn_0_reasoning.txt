==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to determine the total number of pets Ed has, given the number of dogs, cats, and fish.

1. **Identify the number of each type of pet:**
   - Ed has 2 dogs.
   - Ed has 3 cats.

2. **Calculate the total number of dogs and cats:**
   \[
   \text{Total number of dogs and cats} = 2 (\text{dogs}) + 3 (\text{cats}) = 5
   \]

3. **Determine the number of fish:**
   - Ed has twice as many fish as the total number of dogs and cats combined.
   - Since the total number of dogs and cats is 5, the number of fish is:
   \[
   \text{Number of fish} = 2 \times 5 = 10
   \]

4. **Calculate the total number of pets:**
   - Add the number of dogs, cats, and fish together:
   \[
   \text{Total number of pets} = 2 (\text{dogs}) + 3 (\text{cats}) + 10 (\text{fish}) = 15
   \]

Therefore, Ed has a total of 15 pets.

**Final Answer: 15**
