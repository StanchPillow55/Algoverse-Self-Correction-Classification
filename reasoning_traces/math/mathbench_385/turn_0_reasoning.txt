==================================================

To solve the problem, "Sample math problem 385," we first need to clarify what the problem is asking. Since "Sample math problem 385" is not a standard problem statement, I'll assume it refers to a specific problem labeled as number 385 in a textbook or a set of problems. Without the actual content of problem 385, I can't provide a specific solution.

However, I can guide you on how to approach solving a math problem step-by-step. Let's assume a generic math problem and solve it as an example:

**Example Problem:**
Solve for \( x \) in the equation: \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We need to solve for \( x \), which means finding the value of \( x \) that makes the equation true.

2. **Isolate the Variable:**
   - Start by isolating \( x \) on one side of the equation. We have:
     \[
     2x + 3 = 11
     \]
   - To isolate \( 2x \), subtract 3 from both sides:
     \[
     2x + 3 - 3 = 11 - 3
     \]
     \[
     2x = 8
     \]

3. **Solve for \( x \):**
   - Now, divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( x \):
     \[
     \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{8}{2}
     \]
     \[
     x = 4
     \]

4. **Check the Solution:**
   - Substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation to verify:
     \[
     2(4) + 3 = 11
     \]
     \[
     8 + 3 = 11
     \]
   - Since both sides of the equation are equal, \( x = 4 \) is indeed the correct solution.

5. **State the Final Answer:**
   - The solution to the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \) is \( x = 4 \).

If you have a specific problem labeled as "Sample math problem 385," please provide the details of the problem, and I can help solve it accordingly.
