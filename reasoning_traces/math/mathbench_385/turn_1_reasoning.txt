Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample math problem 385" refers to. Since no specific details are provided about the problem, I'll assume it's a generic math problem involving the number 385. Let's explore a few possible interpretations and solve them:

### Interpretation 1: Factorization of 385
Let's factor 385 into its prime components.

1. **Check divisibility by 2**: 385 is odd, so it's not divisible by 2.
2. **Check divisibility by 3**: The sum of the digits of 385 is \(3 + 8 + 5 = 16\), which is not divisible by 3.
3. **Check divisibility by 5**: The last digit of 385 is 5, so it is divisible by 5.
   \[
   385 \div 5 = 77
   \]
4. **Factor 77**: 
   - Check divisibility by 7: \(77 \div 7 = 11\), so 77 is divisible by 7.
   - 11 is a prime number.

Thus, the prime factorization of 385 is:
\[
385 = 5 \times 7 \times 11
\]

### Interpretation 2: Sum of Digits of 385
Calculate the sum of the digits of 385.

\[
3 + 8 + 5 = 16
\]

### Interpretation 3: Check if 385 is a Perfect Square
Determine if 385 is a perfect square by finding its square root.

1. Estimate the square root: \(19^2 = 361\) and \(20^2 = 400\).
2. Since \(361 < 385 < 400\), 385 is not a perfect square.

### Interpretation 4: Solve for x in the equation \(x + 385 = 0\)
Solve for \(x\).

\[
x + 385 = 0 \implies x = -385
\]

### Interpretation 5: Calculate the Divisors of 385
Find all divisors of 385 using its prime factorization.

1. Prime factorization: \(385 = 5 \times 7 \times 11\).
2. Use combinations of these factors to find divisors:
   - \(1\)
   - \(5\)
   - \(7\)
   - \(11\)
   - \(5 \times 7 = 35\)
   - \(5 \times 11 = 55\)
   - \(7 \times 11 = 77\)
   - \(5 \times 7 \times 11 = 385\)

The divisors of 385 are: \(1, 5, 7, 11, 35, 55, 77, 385\).

### Conclusion
Without specific details on "Sample math problem 385," I have explored several mathematical properties and problems involving the number 385. If you have a specific problem in mind, please provide more details. Otherwise, here are the results of the interpretations:

1. Prime factorization: \(5 \times 7 \times 11\)
2. Sum of digits: \(16\)
3. Not a perfect square
4. Solution to \(x + 385 = 0\): \(x = -385\)
5. Divisors: \(1, 5, 7, 11, 35, 55, 77, 385\)
