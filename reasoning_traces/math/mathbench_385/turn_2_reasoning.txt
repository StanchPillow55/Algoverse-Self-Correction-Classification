Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample math problem 385" refers to. Since the problem isn't explicitly stated, I'll assume it's a generic math problem involving the number 385. Let's explore a few possibilities and solve them:

### Problem 1: Prime Factorization of 385

**Step 1: Check for divisibility by small prime numbers.**

- **Divisibility by 2:** 385 is odd, so it's not divisible by 2.
- **Divisibility by 3:** The sum of the digits of 385 is \(3 + 8 + 5 = 16\). Since 16 is not divisible by 3, 385 is not divisible by 3.
- **Divisibility by 5:** The last digit of 385 is 5, so it is divisible by 5.

**Step 2: Divide 385 by 5.**

\[
385 \div 5 = 77
\]

**Step 3: Factor 77.**

- **Divisibility by 2:** 77 is odd, so it's not divisible by 2.
- **Divisibility by 3:** The sum of the digits of 77 is \(7 + 7 = 14\). Since 14 is not divisible by 3, 77 is not divisible by 3.
- **Divisibility by 5:** The last digit is not 0 or 5, so it's not divisible by 5.
- **Divisibility by 7:** Divide 77 by 7.

\[
77 \div 7 = 11
\]

**Step 4: Check if 11 is a prime number.**

11 is a prime number.

**Conclusion:**

The prime factorization of 385 is \(5 \times 7 \times 11\).

### Problem 2: Sum of the Digits of 385

**Step 1: Identify the digits of 385.**

The digits are 3, 8, and 5.

**Step 2: Calculate the sum of the digits.**

\[
3 + 8 + 5 = 16
\]

**Conclusion:**

The sum of the digits of 385 is 16.

### Problem 3: Is 385 a Perfect Square?

**Step 1: Estimate the square root of 385.**

Find the two perfect squares between which 385 lies. The perfect squares 361 (19^2) and 400 (20^2) surround 385.

**Step 2: Check if 385 is a perfect square.**

Since 385 is not equal to 19^2 or 20^2, it is not a perfect square.

**Conclusion:**

385 is not a perfect square.

### Final Answer:

Since the problem wasn't explicitly stated, I explored several possibilities involving the number 385. Here are the conclusions:

1. The prime factorization of 385 is \(5 \times 7 \times 11\).
2. The sum of the digits of 385 is 16.
3. 385 is not a perfect square.
