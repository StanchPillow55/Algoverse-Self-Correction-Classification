==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 484" entails. Since the problem statement is not explicitly provided, I'll assume this is a placeholder for a typical math problem. Let's create a hypothetical problem and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**

A company manufactures two types of widgets: Type A and Type B. The company sells Type A widgets for $50 each and Type B widgets for $70 each. Last month, the company sold a total of 300 widgets and earned $18,000 in revenue. How many of each type of widget did the company sell?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( x \) be the number of Type A widgets sold.
   - Let \( y \) be the number of Type B widgets sold.

2. **Set Up Equations:**
   - From the problem, we know the total number of widgets sold is 300. Therefore, we have the equation:
     \[
     x + y = 300
     \]
   - We also know the total revenue from selling the widgets is $18,000. Therefore, we have the equation:
     \[
     50x + 70y = 18,000
     \]

3. **Solve the System of Equations:**

   We have the following system of equations:
   \[
   \begin{align*}
   x + y &= 300 \quad \text{(Equation 1)} \\
   50x + 70y &= 18,000 \quad \text{(Equation 2)}
   \end{align*}
   \]

   **Substitute \( y \) from Equation 1 into Equation 2:**

   From Equation 1, express \( y \) in terms of \( x \):
   \[
   y = 300 - x
   \]

   Substitute \( y = 300 - x \) into Equation 2:
   \[
   50x + 70(300 - x) = 18,000
   \]

   **Simplify and Solve for \( x \):**

   Distribute the 70:
   \[
   50x + 21,000 - 70x = 18,000
   \]

   Combine like terms:
   \[
   -20x + 21,000 = 18,000
   \]

   Subtract 21,000 from both sides:
   \[
   -20x = -3,000
   \]

   Divide by -20:
   \[
   x = 150
   \]

4. **Find \( y \):**

   Substitute \( x = 150 \) back into Equation 1:
   \[
   150 + y = 300
   \]

   Solve for \( y \):
   \[
   y = 150
   \]

5. **Conclusion:**

   The company sold 150 Type A widgets and 150 Type B widgets.

**Final Answer:**
The company sold 150 Type A widgets and 150 Type B widgets.
