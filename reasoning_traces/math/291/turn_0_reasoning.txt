==================================================

To find out how much fuel Mary used in total for the two weeks, we need to first determine how much fuel she used last week.

1. **Calculate the amount of fuel used last week:**
   - Mary used 15 gallons of fuel this week.
   - Last week, she used 20% less fuel than this week.
   - To find 20% of this week's fuel usage, we calculate:
     \[
     20\% \text{ of } 15 \text{ gallons} = 0.20 \times 15 = 3 \text{ gallons}
     \]
   - Now, we subtract this amount from this week's usage to find last week's usage:
     \[
     \text{Fuel used last week} = 15 \text{ gallons} - 3 \text{ gallons} = 12 \text{ gallons}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total fuel used over the two weeks:**
   - Now that we know the fuel used last week (12 gallons) and this week (15 gallons), we can find the total:
     \[
     \text{Total fuel used} = \text{Fuel used last week} + \text{Fuel used this week}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total fuel used} = 12 \text{ gallons} + 15 \text{ gallons} = 27 \text{ gallons}
     \]

3. **Final answer:**
   - Therefore, the total amount of fuel Mary used over the two weeks is:
     \[
     \boxed{27} \text{ gallons}
     \]
