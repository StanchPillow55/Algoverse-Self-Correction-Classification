==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine how much fuel Mary used last week and then add it to the amount she used this week to find the total fuel used over the two weeks.

### Step 1: Determine the amount of fuel used last week

We know that this week Mary used 15 gallons of fuel. Last week, she used 20% less fuel than she did this week. To find out how much fuel she used last week, we need to calculate 20% of the 15 gallons and then subtract that from 15 gallons.

1. **Calculate 20% of 15 gallons:**

   \[
   20\% \text{ of } 15 = \frac{20}{100} \times 15 = 0.2 \times 15 = 3 \text{ gallons}
   \]

2. **Subtract this amount from 15 gallons to find last week's fuel usage:**

   \[
   \text{Fuel used last week} = 15 - 3 = 12 \text{ gallons}
   \]

### Step 2: Calculate the total fuel used over the two weeks

Now that we know Mary used 12 gallons last week and 15 gallons this week, we can find the total fuel used over the two weeks by adding these amounts together.

\[
\text{Total fuel used} = \text{Fuel used last week} + \text{Fuel used this week} = 12 + 15 = 27 \text{ gallons}
\]

### Final Answer

Mary used a total of 27 gallons of fuel over the two weeks.
