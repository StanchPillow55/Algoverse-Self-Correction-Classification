==================================================

To solve the problem, we will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of chocolate bars available.**
   Each packet contains 5 chocolate bars, and there are 8 packets. Therefore, the total number of chocolate bars is calculated as follows:

   \[
   \text{Total chocolate bars} = \text{Number of packets} \times \text{Chocolate bars per packet} = 8 \times 5 = 40
   \]

2. **Determine how many chocolate bars are given to the adults.**
   There are 4 adults, and each adult receives 6 chocolate bars. Thus, the total number of chocolate bars given to the adults is:

   \[
   \text{Chocolate bars for adults} = \text{Number of adults} \times \text{Chocolate bars per adult} = 4 \times 6 = 24
   \]

3. **Calculate the remaining chocolate bars after the adults have taken their share.**
   We subtract the number of chocolate bars given to the adults from the total number of chocolate bars:

   \[
   \text{Remaining chocolate bars} = \text{Total chocolate bars} - \text{Chocolate bars for adults} = 40 - 24 = 16
   \]

4. **Share the remaining chocolate bars equally among the children.**
   There are 8 children, and we need to distribute the remaining 16 chocolate bars equally among them. The number of chocolate bars each child receives is calculated as follows:

   \[
   \text{Chocolate bars per child} = \frac{\text{Remaining chocolate bars}}{\text{Number of children}} = \frac{16}{8} = 2
   \]

5. **Final answer.**
   Each child will receive 2 chocolate bars.

Thus, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{2}
\]
