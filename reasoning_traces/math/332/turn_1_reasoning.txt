==================================================

To solve the problem of determining how much money Dorothy will have left after paying taxes, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Identify the total annual income**: Dorothy earns $60,000 per year.

2. **Determine the tax rate**: Dorothy needs to pay 18% of her income in taxes.

3. **Calculate the amount of taxes she needs to pay**:
   - To find the amount of taxes, we multiply her total income by the tax rate.
   - The tax rate is given as 18%, which can be expressed as a decimal for calculation purposes: 18% = 0.18.

   \[
   \text{Taxes} = \text{Income} \times \text{Tax Rate} = 60,000 \times 0.18
   \]

   \[
   \text{Taxes} = 10,800
   \]

   Dorothy needs to pay $10,800 in taxes.

4. **Calculate the amount of money left after paying taxes**:
   - Subtract the amount of taxes from her total income to find out how much money she will have left.

   \[
   \text{Money Left} = \text{Income} - \text{Taxes} = 60,000 - 10,800
   \]

   \[
   \text{Money Left} = 49,200
   \]

Therefore, after paying her taxes, Dorothy will have $49,200 left.

**Final Answer**: Dorothy will have $49,200 left after paying her taxes.
