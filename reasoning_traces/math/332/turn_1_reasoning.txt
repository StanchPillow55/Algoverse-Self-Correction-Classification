==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine how much money Dorothy will have left after paying her taxes. We will do this by calculating the amount of taxes she needs to pay and then subtracting that from her total earnings.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Identify Dorothy's Annual Earnings:**
   Dorothy earns $60,000 per year.

2. **Determine the Tax Rate:**
   Dorothy needs to pay 18% of her earnings in taxes.

3. **Calculate the Amount of Taxes:**
   To find out how much Dorothy needs to pay in taxes, we calculate 18% of her annual earnings.

   \[
   \text{Taxes} = \text{Earnings} \times \text{Tax Rate}
   \]

   Substituting the known values:

   \[
   \text{Taxes} = 60,000 \times 0.18
   \]

   Calculate the multiplication:

   \[
   \text{Taxes} = 10,800
   \]

   Dorothy needs to pay $10,800 in taxes.

4. **Calculate the Amount Left After Taxes:**
   To find out how much money Dorothy will have left after paying her taxes, subtract the tax amount from her total earnings.

   \[
   \text{Amount Left} = \text{Earnings} - \text{Taxes}
   \]

   Substituting the known values:

   \[
   \text{Amount Left} = 60,000 - 10,800
   \]

   Calculate the subtraction:

   \[
   \text{Amount Left} = 49,200
   \]

### Final Answer:
After paying her taxes, Dorothy will have $49,200 left.
