==================================================

To solve the problem, we will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of ruined castles**: We know that 40 percent of the total castles are ruins. The total number of castles in Scotland is 220.

   \[
   \text{Number of ruined castles} = 40\% \text{ of } 220
   \]

   To calculate 40% of 220, we convert the percentage to a decimal:

   \[
   40\% = \frac{40}{100} = 0.4
   \]

   Now we multiply:

   \[
   \text{Number of ruined castles} = 0.4 \times 220 = 88
   \]

2. **Calculate the number of unmanned ruined castles**: We are told that half of the ruined castles are unmanned. 

   \[
   \text{Number of unmanned ruined castles} = \frac{1}{2} \text{ of the number of ruined castles}
   \]

   We already calculated that there are 88 ruined castles, so we find half of that:

   \[
   \text{Number of unmanned ruined castles} = \frac{1}{2} \times 88 = 44
   \]

3. **Final answer**: Therefore, the number of unmanned ruined castles in Scotland is 

   \[
   \boxed{44}
   \]
