To determine how much money Dorothy will have left after paying taxes, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the amount of taxes Dorothy needs to pay.**

   Dorothy's annual income is $60,000. She needs to pay 18% of this income in taxes. To find the amount of taxes, we calculate 18% of $60,000.

   \[
   \text{Taxes} = 0.18 \times 60,000
   \]

   To perform the multiplication:

   \[
   0.18 \times 60,000 = 10,800
   \]

   So, Dorothy needs to pay $10,800 in taxes.

2. **Calculate the amount of money Dorothy will have left after paying taxes.**

   To find out how much money Dorothy will have left, we subtract the amount of taxes from her total income.

   \[
   \text{Money left} = 60,000 - 10,800
   \]

   Performing the subtraction:

   \[
   60,000 - 10,800 = 49,200
   \]

   Therefore, after paying taxes, Dorothy will have $49,200 left.

3. **Conclusion:**

   After paying 18% of her income in taxes, Dorothy will have $49,200 remaining.

Final Answer: Dorothy will have $49,200 left after paying her taxes.
