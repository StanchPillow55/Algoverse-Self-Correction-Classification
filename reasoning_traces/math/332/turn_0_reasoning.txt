==================================================

To find out how much money Dorothy will have left after paying her taxes, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the amount of taxes Dorothy has to pay.**
   - Dorothy's annual income is $60,000.
   - The tax rate is 18%.

   To find the amount of taxes, we multiply her income by the tax rate:

   \[
   \text{Taxes} = \text{Income} \times \text{Tax Rate}
   \]

   Substituting in the values:

   \[
   \text{Taxes} = 60000 \times 0.18
   \]

   Now, we perform the multiplication:

   \[
   \text{Taxes} = 60000 \times 0.18 = 10800
   \]

   So, Dorothy will pay $10,800 in taxes.

2. **Calculate the amount of money Dorothy has left after paying taxes.**
   - To find out how much money she has left, we subtract the amount of taxes from her total income:

   \[
   \text{Money Left} = \text{Income} - \text{Taxes}
   \]

   Substituting in the values:

   \[
   \text{Money Left} = 60000 - 10800
   \]

   Now, we perform the subtraction:

   \[
   \text{Money Left} = 60000 - 10800 = 49200
   \]

3. **Final Answer:**
   - After paying her taxes, Dorothy will have **$49,200** left.

Thus, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{49200}
\]
