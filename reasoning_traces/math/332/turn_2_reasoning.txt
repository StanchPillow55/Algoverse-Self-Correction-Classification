Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine how much money Dorothy will have left after paying her taxes. We will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the amount of taxes Dorothy needs to pay.**
2. **Subtract the tax amount from her total earnings to find out how much money she will have left.**

### Step 1: Calculate the Tax Amount

Dorothy earns $60,000 a year and needs to pay 18% of this amount in taxes. To find the tax amount, we calculate 18% of $60,000.

The formula to calculate a percentage of a number is:

\[
\text{Percentage of a number} = \left(\frac{\text{Percentage}}{100}\right) \times \text{Total Amount}
\]

Substituting the given values:

\[
\text{Tax Amount} = \left(\frac{18}{100}\right) \times 60000
\]

\[
\text{Tax Amount} = 0.18 \times 60000
\]

\[
\text{Tax Amount} = 10800
\]

Dorothy needs to pay $10,800 in taxes.

### Step 2: Calculate the Remaining Amount After Taxes

Now, we subtract the tax amount from Dorothy's total earnings to find out how much money she will have left.

\[
\text{Remaining Amount} = \text{Total Earnings} - \text{Tax Amount}
\]

Substituting the known values:

\[
\text{Remaining Amount} = 60000 - 10800
\]

\[
\text{Remaining Amount} = 49200
\]

### Final Answer

After paying her taxes, Dorothy will have $49,200 left.
