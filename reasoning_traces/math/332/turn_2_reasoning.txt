==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine how much money Dorothy will have left after paying her taxes. We will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the amount of taxes Dorothy needs to pay.**
2. **Subtract the tax amount from her total earnings to find out how much money she will have left.**

Let's go through these steps in detail:

### Step 1: Calculate the Amount of Taxes

Dorothy earns $60,000 a year, and she needs to pay 18% of this amount in taxes. To find out how much she needs to pay in taxes, we calculate 18% of $60,000.

The formula to calculate a percentage of a given amount is:

\[
\text{Tax Amount} = \text{Total Earnings} \times \left(\frac{\text{Percentage}}{100}\right)
\]

Plugging in the values:

\[
\text{Tax Amount} = 60,000 \times \left(\frac{18}{100}\right)
\]

Calculating the above expression:

\[
\text{Tax Amount} = 60,000 \times 0.18 = 10,800
\]

Dorothy needs to pay $10,800 in taxes.

### Step 2: Calculate the Remaining Amount After Taxes

Now, we subtract the tax amount from Dorothy's total earnings to find out how much money she will have left:

\[
\text{Remaining Amount} = \text{Total Earnings} - \text{Tax Amount}
\]

Substituting the known values:

\[
\text{Remaining Amount} = 60,000 - 10,800
\]

Calculating the above expression:

\[
\text{Remaining Amount} = 49,200
\]

### Final Answer

After paying her taxes, Dorothy will have $49,200 left.

Thus, the final answer is:

Dorothy will have $49,200 left after paying her taxes.
