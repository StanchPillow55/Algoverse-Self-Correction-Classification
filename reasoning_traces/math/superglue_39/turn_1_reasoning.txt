==================================================

To solve the problem, I need more specific information about "Sample reasoning question 39" as it is not provided in the prompt. However, I can guide you through a general approach to solving reasoning problems, especially if they are mathematical in nature.

### General Approach to Solving Mathematical Reasoning Problems:

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - Carefully read the problem statement.
   - Identify what is being asked.
   - Note any given data or conditions.

2. **Devise a Plan:**
   - Determine the type of problem (e.g., algebra, geometry, logic).
   - Consider strategies that might be applicable (e.g., drawing a diagram, creating an equation).

3. **Carry Out the Plan:**
   - Execute the chosen strategy step by step.
   - Perform calculations carefully.
   - Keep track of units and ensure consistency.

4. **Review/Check Your Work:**
   - Verify each step for accuracy.
   - Check if the solution makes sense in the context of the problem.
   - Ensure all parts of the problem are addressed.

5. **State the Final Answer:**
   - Clearly present the solution.
   - Include units if applicable.

### Example Problem and Solution:

**Example Problem:**
A farmer has a rectangular field that is 100 meters long and 50 meters wide. He wants to build a fence around the field. How much fencing material does he need?

**Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We need to find the perimeter of a rectangle to determine the amount of fencing material required.

2. **Devise a Plan:**
   - The perimeter \( P \) of a rectangle is given by the formula:
     \[
     P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width})
     \]

3. **Carry Out the Plan:**
   - Substitute the given values into the formula:
     \[
     P = 2 \times (100 \, \text{meters} + 50 \, \text{meters})
     \]
   - Calculate the sum inside the parentheses:
     \[
     100 + 50 = 150 \, \text{meters}
     \]
   - Multiply by 2 to find the perimeter:
     \[
     P = 2 \times 150 = 300 \, \text{meters}
     \]

4. **Review/Check Your Work:**
   - Double-check the calculations:
     - Addition: \( 100 + 50 = 150 \)
     - Multiplication: \( 2 \times 150 = 300 \)
   - The calculations are correct.

5. **State the Final Answer:**
   - The farmer needs 300 meters of fencing material.
