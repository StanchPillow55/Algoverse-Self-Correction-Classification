Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we will break it down into several steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of elephants that left the park during the exodus.**
2. **Determine the number of elephants remaining after the exodus.**
3. **Calculate the number of new elephants that entered the park.**
4. **Find the rate at which the new elephants entered the park.**

### Step 1: Calculate the total number of elephants that left the park.

The problem states that 2,880 elephants left the park per hour for 4 hours. We can calculate the total number of elephants that left as follows:

\[
\text{Total elephants that left} = \text{Rate of exodus} \times \text{Time} = 2,880 \, \text{elephants/hour} \times 4 \, \text{hours}
\]

Calculating this gives:

\[
\text{Total elephants that left} = 2,880 \times 4 = 11,520 \, \text{elephants}
\]

### Step 2: Determine the number of elephants remaining after the exodus.

Initially, there were 30,000 elephants in the park. After the exodus, the number of elephants remaining can be calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Remaining elephants} = \text{Initial elephants} - \text{Total elephants that left} = 30,000 - 11,520
\]

Calculating this gives:

\[
\text{Remaining elephants} = 30,000 - 11,520 = 18,480 \, \text{elephants}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the number of new elephants that entered the park.

The final number of elephants in the park is given as 28,980. To find out how many new elephants entered the park, we subtract the number of remaining elephants from the final count:

\[
\text{New elephants} = \text{Final elephants} - \text{Remaining elephants} = 28,980 - 18,480
\]

Calculating this gives:

\[
\text{New elephants} = 28,980 - 18,480 = 10,500 \, \text{elephants}
\]

### Step 4: Find the rate at which the new elephants entered the park.

The new elephants entered the park over a period of 7 hours. To find the rate of new elephants entering the park, we can use the formula:

\[
\text{Rate of new elephants} = \frac{\text{New elephants}}{\text{Time}} = \frac{10,500 \, \text{elephants}}{7 \, \text{hours}}
\]

Calculating this gives:

\[
\text{Rate of new elephants} = \frac{10,500}{7} \approx 1,500 \, \text{elephants/hour}
\]

### Final Answer

The rate at which the new elephants entered the park is approximately **1,500 elephants/hour**.
