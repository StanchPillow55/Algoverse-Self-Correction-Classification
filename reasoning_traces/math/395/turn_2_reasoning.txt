Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine the rate at which new elephants entered Utopia National Park after the initial exodus. Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Step 1: Calculate the number of elephants that left the park

We know that elephants left the park at a constant rate of 2,880 elephants per hour over a 4-hour period. To find the total number of elephants that left, we multiply the rate by the time:

\[
\text{Elephants leaving} = 2,880 \, \text{elephants/hour} \times 4 \, \text{hours} = 11,520 \, \text{elephants}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the number of elephants remaining after the exodus

Initially, there were 30,000 elephants in the park. After 11,520 elephants left, the number of elephants remaining is:

\[
\text{Elephants remaining} = 30,000 - 11,520 = 18,480
\]

### Step 3: Determine the number of elephants that entered the park

We are told that after the exodus and the entry of new elephants, the final number of elephants in the park was 28,980. Therefore, the number of elephants that entered the park must be:

\[
\text{Elephants entered} = 28,980 - 18,480 = 10,500
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the rate of new elephants entering the park

The new elephants entered over a 7-hour period. To find the rate at which they entered, we divide the total number of elephants that entered by the time period:

\[
\text{Rate of elephants entering} = \frac{10,500 \, \text{elephants}}{7 \, \text{hours}} = 1,500 \, \text{elephants/hour}
\]

### Final Answer

The rate at which new elephants entered the park was \( \boxed{1,500} \) elephants per hour.
