==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine the rate at which new elephants entered Utopia National Park during the 7-hour period after the initial exodus.

**Step 1: Calculate the number of elephants that left the park.**

The problem states that elephants left the park at a constant rate of 2,880 elephants per hour over a 4-hour period. To find the total number of elephants that left, we multiply the rate by the time:

\[
\text{Elephants that left} = 2,880 \, \text{elephants/hour} \times 4 \, \text{hours} = 11,520 \, \text{elephants}
\]

**Step 2: Determine the number of elephants remaining after the exodus.**

Initially, there were 30,000 elephants in the park. After 11,520 elephants left, the number of elephants remaining is:

\[
\text{Elephants remaining} = 30,000 - 11,520 = 18,480 \, \text{elephants}
\]

**Step 3: Calculate the number of elephants that entered the park.**

The final number of elephants in the park is given as 28,980. Therefore, the number of elephants that entered the park during the 7-hour period is the difference between the final number and the number remaining after the exodus:

\[
\text{Elephants that entered} = 28,980 - 18,480 = 10,500 \, \text{elephants}
\]

**Step 4: Determine the rate at which new elephants entered the park.**

The new elephants entered over a 7-hour period. To find the rate, we divide the total number of elephants that entered by the time period:

\[
\text{Rate of new elephants entering} = \frac{10,500 \, \text{elephants}}{7 \, \text{hours}} = 1,500 \, \text{elephants/hour}
\]

**Final Answer:**

The rate at which new elephants entered the park was \(1,500\) elephants per hour.
