To solve the problem, we need to break it down into steps and calculate the number of elephants that left the park and the number of new elephants that entered the park.

### Step 1: Calculate the number of elephants that left the park during the exodus.

The problem states that the exodus lasted for 4 hours at a rate of 2,880 elephants per hour. We can calculate the total number of elephants that left the park as follows:

\[
\text{Total elephants that left} = \text{Rate of exodus} \times \text{Time of exodus}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\text{Total elephants that left} = 2,880 \, \text{elephants/hour} \times 4 \, \text{hours} = 11,520 \, \text{elephants}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the number of elephants remaining after the exodus.

Initially, there were 30,000 elephants in the park. After the exodus, we can find the remaining number of elephants:

\[
\text{Remaining elephants} = \text{Initial elephants} - \text{Total elephants that left}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\text{Remaining elephants} = 30,000 - 11,520 = 18,480 \, \text{elephants}
\]

### Step 3: Determine the number of new elephants that entered the park.

After the exodus, new elephants entered the park for a period of 7 hours. We know that the final number of elephants in the park is 28,980. Therefore, we can find the number of new elephants that entered the park by subtracting the remaining elephants from the final count:

\[
\text{New elephants that entered} = \text{Final elephants} - \text{Remaining elephants}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\text{New elephants that entered} = 28,980 - 18,480 = 10,500 \, \text{elephants}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the rate at which new elephants entered the park.

Now that we know the total number of new elephants that entered the park (10,500 elephants) over a period of 7 hours, we can find the rate of new elephants entering the park:

\[
\text{Rate of new elephants} = \frac{\text{New elephants that entered}}{\text{Time period}}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\text{Rate of new elephants} = \frac{10,500 \, \text{elephants}}{7 \, \text{hours}} = 1,500 \, \text{elephants/hour}
\]

### Final Answer

The rate at which new elephants entered the park is:

\[
\boxed{1,500} \, \text{elephants/hour}
\]
