To solve the problem, we need to determine the rate at which new elephants entered Utopia National Park after the initial exodus.

1. **Initial Number of Elephants**: 
   The park started with 30,000 elephants.

2. **Elephant Exodus**:
   The elephants left the park at a rate of 2,880 elephants per hour for a duration of 4 hours. We can calculate the total number of elephants that left the park during this time:
   \[
   \text{Total elephants that left} = \text{Rate} \times \text{Time} = 2,880 \, \text{elephants/hour} \times 4 \, \text{hours} = 11,520 \, \text{elephants}
   \]

3. **Remaining Elephants After Exodus**:
   To find the number of elephants remaining in the park after the exodus, we subtract the number of elephants that left from the initial number:
   \[
   \text{Remaining elephants} = 30,000 - 11,520 = 18,480 \, \text{elephants}
   \]

4. **New Elephants Entering the Park**:
   After the exodus, new elephants entered the park for a period of 7 hours. Let \( r \) be the rate at which new elephants entered the park (in elephants per hour). The total number of new elephants that entered the park over 7 hours can be expressed as:
   \[
   \text{Total new elephants} = r \times 7
   \]

5. **Final Number of Elephants in the Park**:
   We know that the final number of elephants in the park is 28,980. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:
   \[
   \text{Remaining elephants} + \text{Total new elephants} = \text{Final number of elephants}
   \]
   Substituting the known values:
   \[
   18,480 + (r \times 7) = 28,980
   \]

6. **Solving for \( r \)**:
   We can rearrange the equation to solve for \( r \):
   \[
   r \times 7 = 28,980 - 18,480
   \]
   \[
   r \times 7 = 10,500
   \]
   Now, divide both sides by 7 to find \( r \):
   \[
   r = \frac{10,500}{7} = 1,500
   \]

Thus, the rate at which new elephants entered the park is \( \boxed{1,500} \) elephants per hour.
