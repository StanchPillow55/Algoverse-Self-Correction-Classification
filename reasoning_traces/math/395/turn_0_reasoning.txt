To solve this problem, we need to determine the rate at which new elephants entered Utopia National Park after the initial exodus.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Number of Elephants:**
   - The park initially hosted 30,000 elephants.

2. **Elephant Exodus:**
   - Elephants left the park at a rate of 2,880 elephants per hour for 4 hours.
   - Total number of elephants that left = Rate × Time = 2,880 elephants/hour × 4 hours = 11,520 elephants.

3. **Number of Elephants After Exodus:**
   - After the exodus, the number of elephants remaining in the park = Initial number - Elephants that left = 30,000 - 11,520 = 18,480 elephants.

4. **New Elephants Entering the Park:**
   - Over the next 7-hour period, new elephants entered the park at a constant rate.
   - Let \( r \) be the rate at which new elephants entered the park (in elephants per hour).

5. **Final Number of Elephants:**
   - The final number of elephants in the park was 28,980.
   - Therefore, the number of new elephants that entered the park = Final number - Number after exodus = 28,980 - 18,480 = 10,500 elephants.

6. **Determine the Rate of New Elephants Entering:**
   - The new elephants entered over a 7-hour period.
   - Total number of new elephants = Rate × Time = \( r \times 7 \).
   - We know that \( r \times 7 = 10,500 \).

7. **Solve for \( r \):**
   \[
   r \times 7 = 10,500
   \]
   \[
   r = \frac{10,500}{7}
   \]
   \[
   r = 1,500
   \]

Thus, the rate at which new elephants entered the park was 1,500 elephants per hour.

**Final Answer:**
The rate at which new elephants entered the park was 1,500 elephants per hour.
