To solve the problem, we need to determine how many sunflowers Faraday sold over the course of 3 days. We will break down the problem step by step.

### Step 1: Determine the daily sales of sunflowers and bouquets

1. **Sunflower Sales**:
   - Each sunflower costs $2.
   - Faraday earned $26 from sunflowers in one day.
   - To find the number of sunflowers sold, we divide the total earnings from sunflowers by the price per sunflower:
     \[
     \text{Number of sunflowers sold} = \frac{\text{Total earnings from sunflowers}}{\text{Price per sunflower}} = \frac{26}{2} = 13
     \]

2. **Bouquet Sales**:
   - Each bouquet costs $8.
   - Faraday earned $56 from bouquets in one day.
   - To find the number of bouquets sold, we divide the total earnings from bouquets by the price per bouquet:
     \[
     \text{Number of bouquets sold} = \frac{\text{Total earnings from bouquets}}{\text{Price per bouquet}} = \frac{56}{8} = 7
     \]

### Step 2: Calculate the total number of sunflowers sold from bouquets

Each bouquet contains 12 sunflowers. Therefore, the total number of sunflowers sold from bouquets is:
\[
\text{Number of sunflowers from bouquets} = \text{Number of bouquets sold} \times \text{Sunflowers per bouquet} = 7 \times 12 = 84
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the total number of sunflowers sold in one day

Now, we can find the total number of sunflowers sold in one day by adding the number of sunflowers sold individually and the number sold through bouquets:
\[
\text{Total sunflowers sold in one day} = \text{Number of sunflowers sold} + \text{Number of sunflowers from bouquets} = 13 + 84 = 97
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the total number of sunflowers sold in 3 days

To find the total number of sunflowers sold over 3 days, we multiply the daily total by 3:
\[
\text{Total sunflowers sold in 3 days} = \text{Total sunflowers sold in one day} \times 3 = 97 \times 3 = 291
\]

### Final Answer

Thus, the total number of sunflowers Faraday was able to sell after 3 days is:
\[
\boxed{291}
\]
