To find out how much money Terry makes in total from selling milkshakes, burger platters, and sodas, we will calculate the total revenue from each item separately and then sum them up.

**Step 1: Calculate the revenue from milkshakes.**

Terry sells 6 milkshakes for $5.50 each. 

To find the total revenue from milkshakes:
\[
\text{Total from milkshakes} = \text{Number of milkshakes} \times \text{Price per milkshake}
\]
\[
\text{Total from milkshakes} = 6 \times 5.50
\]

Now, we perform the multiplication:
\[
6 \times 5.50 = 33.00
\]

So, the total revenue from milkshakes is **$33.00**.

**Step 2: Calculate the revenue from burger platters.**

Terry sells 9 burger platters for $11 each.

To find the total revenue from burger platters:
\[
\text{Total from burger platters} = \text{Number of burger platters} \times \text{Price per burger platter}
\]
\[
\text{Total from burger platters} = 9 \times 11
\]

Now, we perform the multiplication:
\[
9 \times 11 = 99
\]

So, the total revenue from burger platters is **$99.00**.

**Step 3: Calculate the revenue from sodas.**

Terry sells 20 sodas for $1.50 each.

To find the total revenue from sodas:
\[
\text{Total from sodas} = \text{Number of sodas} \times \text{Price per soda}
\]
\[
\text{Total from sodas} = 20 \times 1.50
\]

Now, we perform the multiplication:
\[
20 \times 1.50 = 30.00
\]

So, the total revenue from sodas is **$30.00**.

**Step 4: Calculate the total revenue.**

Now, we sum the total revenues from milkshakes, burger platters, and sodas:
\[
\text{Total revenue} = \text{Total from milkshakes} + \text{Total from burger platters} + \text{Total from sodas}
\]
\[
\text{Total revenue} = 33.00 + 99.00 + 30.00
\]

Now, we perform the addition:
\[
33.00 + 99.00 = 132.00
\]
\[
132.00 + 30.00 = 162.00
\]

Thus, the total revenue Terry makes is **$162.00**.

**Final Answer:**
Terry makes a total of **$162.00**.
