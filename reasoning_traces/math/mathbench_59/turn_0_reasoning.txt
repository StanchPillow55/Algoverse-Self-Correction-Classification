==================================================

It seems like there might be a misunderstanding or missing information in your request. "Sample math problem 59" doesn't provide specific details about the problem you're referring to. To assist you effectively, I'll need more information about the problem itself. 

However, I can guide you on how to approach solving a math problem step by step. Let's assume a generic math problem and work through it:

**Example Problem: Solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).**

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We need to solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).

2. **Isolate the Variable:**
   - To solve for \( x \), we need to get \( x \) by itself on one side of the equation.

3. **Subtract 3 from Both Sides:**
   \[
   2x + 3 - 3 = 11 - 3
   \]
   - This simplifies to:
   \[
   2x = 8
   \]

4. **Divide Both Sides by 2:**
   \[
   \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{8}{2}
   \]
   - This simplifies to:
   \[
   x = 4
   \]

5. **Check the Solution:**
   - Substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation to verify:
   \[
   2(4) + 3 = 11
   \]
   - Simplifying the left side:
   \[
   8 + 3 = 11
   \]
   - Since both sides of the equation are equal, \( x = 4 \) is the correct solution.

### Final Answer:
The solution to the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \) is \( x = 4 \).
