==================================================

To determine how many groups can perform in Vicki's concert, we first need to calculate the total time allocated for each group, including their time to get on stage, perform, and exit the stage.

1. **Calculate the time for each group:**
   - Time to get on stage: 2 minutes
   - Time to perform: 6 minutes
   - Time to exit the stage: 2 minutes

   Total time for one group = Time to get on stage + Time to perform + Time to exit the stage
   \[
   \text{Total time for one group} = 2 \text{ minutes} + 6 \text{ minutes} + 2 \text{ minutes} = 10 \text{ minutes}
   \]

2. **Include the intermission time:**
   Vicki is allowing a 10-minute intermission. This intermission will occur after a certain number of groups have performed. 

3. **Calculate the total concert time:**
   The concert is planned to last for 2 hours. We convert this to minutes:
   \[
   2 \text{ hours} = 2 \times 60 = 120 \text{ minutes}
   \]

4. **Set up the equation:**
   Let \( n \) be the number of groups that can perform. The total time used for \( n \) groups plus the intermission must equal the total concert time:
   \[
   10n + 10 \leq 120
   \]

5. **Solve for \( n \):**
   First, we subtract the intermission time from the total concert time:
   \[
   10n \leq 120 - 10
   \]
   \[
   10n \leq 110
   \]
   Now, divide both sides by 10:
   \[
   n \leq 11
   \]

6. **Conclusion:**
   Since \( n \) must be a whole number, the maximum number of groups that can perform is 11.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{11}
\]
