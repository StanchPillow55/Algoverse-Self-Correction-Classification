==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of stamps Valerie needs based on the different types of mail she is sending. Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Thank You Cards**: Valerie has thank you cards for her grandmother, uncle, and aunt. This means she has 3 thank you cards. Each card requires 1 stamp.
   \[
   \text{Stamps for thank you cards} = 3 \times 1 = 3 \text{ stamps}
   \]

2. **Bills**: Valerie has to pay the water bill and the electric bill separately. This means she has 2 bills. However, the electric bill requires 2 stamps.
   \[
   \text{Stamps for water bill} = 1 \text{ stamp}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Stamps for electric bill} = 2 \text{ stamps}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total stamps for bills} = 1 + 2 = 3 \text{ stamps}
   \]

3. **Mail-in Rebates**: Valerie wants to send three more mail-in rebates than she does bills. Since she has 2 bills, she will send:
   \[
   \text{Number of rebates} = 2 + 3 = 5
   \]
   Each rebate requires 1 stamp.
   \[
   \text{Stamps for rebates} = 5 \times 1 = 5 \text{ stamps}
   \]

4. **Job Applications**: Valerie has twice as many job applications as rebates to mail. Since she has 5 rebates, she will send:
   \[
   \text{Number of job applications} = 2 \times 5 = 10
   \]
   Each job application requires 1 stamp.
   \[
   \text{Stamps for job applications} = 10 \times 1 = 10 \text{ stamps}
   \]

5. **Total Stamps Needed**: Now, we sum up all the stamps needed for each category:
   \[
   \text{Total stamps} = \text{Stamps for thank you cards} + \text{Stamps for bills} + \text{Stamps for rebates} + \text{Stamps for job applications}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total stamps} = 3 + 3 + 5 + 10 = 21 \text{ stamps}
   \]

Therefore, Valerie needs a total of 21 stamps.

**Final Answer**: Valerie needs 21 stamps.
