Question ID: 116
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of stamps Valerie needs based on the number of envelopes she is mailing. Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Thank You Cards:**
   - Valerie has thank you cards for her grandmother, uncle, and aunt.
   - Number of thank you cards = 3

2. **Bills:**
   - Valerie has to pay the water bill and the electric bill separately.
   - Number of bills = 2

3. **Mail-in Rebates:**
   - Valerie wants to send three more mail-in rebates than she does bills.
   - Number of rebates = Number of bills + 3 = 2 + 3 = 5

4. **Job Applications:**
   - Valerie has twice as many job applications as rebates to mail.
   - Number of job applications = 2 × Number of rebates = 2 × 5 = 10

Now, let's calculate the total number of stamps needed:

- **Thank You Cards:** Each thank you card requires 1 stamp.
  - Total stamps for thank you cards = 3 × 1 = 3

- **Water Bill:** The water bill requires 1 stamp.
  - Total stamps for water bill = 1

- **Electric Bill:** The electric bill requires 2 stamps.
  - Total stamps for electric bill = 2

- **Mail-in Rebates:** Each rebate requires 1 stamp.
  - Total stamps for rebates = 5 × 1 = 5

- **Job Applications:** Each job application requires 1 stamp.
  - Total stamps for job applications = 10 × 1 = 10

Finally, we add up all the stamps needed:

\[
\text{Total stamps} = \text{Stamps for thank you cards} + \text{Stamps for water bill} + \text{Stamps for electric bill} + \text{Stamps for rebates} + \text{Stamps for job applications}
\]

\[
\text{Total stamps} = 3 + 1 + 2 + 5 + 10 = 21
\]

Therefore, Valerie needs a total of 21 stamps.

**Final Answer: 21 stamps**
