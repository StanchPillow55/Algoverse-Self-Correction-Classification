Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to define the variables and set up equations based on the information given.

1. **Identify the items to be mailed:**
   - Thank you cards: 3 (for grandmother, uncle, and aunt)
   - Bills: 2 (water bill and electric bill)
   - Mail-in rebates: Let \( r \) be the number of rebates.
   - Job applications: Let \( j \) be the number of job applications.

2. **Set up the relationships based on the problem:**
   - Valerie wants to send three more mail-in rebates than she does bills. Since she has 2 bills, we can express this as:
     \[
     r = 2 + 3 = 5
     \]
   - She has twice as many job applications as rebates:
     \[
     j = 2r = 2 \times 5 = 10
     \]

3. **Count the total number of items to be mailed:**
   - Thank you cards: 3
   - Bills: 2 (1 stamp for the water bill and 2 stamps for the electric bill)
   - Mail-in rebates: 5
   - Job applications: 10

4. **Calculate the total number of stamps needed:**
   - Stamps for thank you cards: \( 3 \times 1 = 3 \)
   - Stamps for the water bill: \( 1 \)
   - Stamps for the electric bill: \( 2 \)
   - Stamps for mail-in rebates: \( 5 \times 1 = 5 \)
   - Stamps for job applications: \( 10 \times 1 = 10 \)

5. **Add up all the stamps:**
   - Total stamps for thank you cards: 3
   - Total stamps for bills: \( 1 + 2 = 3 \)
   - Total stamps for mail-in rebates: 5
   - Total stamps for job applications: 10

   Now, we sum these amounts:
   \[
   \text{Total stamps} = 3 + 3 + 5 + 10 = 21
   \]

Thus, the total number of stamps Valerie needs is \( \boxed{21} \).
