To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of stamps Valerie needs based on the different types of mail she is sending. Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Thank You Cards:**
   - Valerie has thank you cards for her grandmother, uncle, and aunt.
   - Number of thank you cards = 3
   - Each thank you card requires 1 stamp.
   - Total stamps for thank you cards = 3 cards × 1 stamp/card = 3 stamps

2. **Bills:**
   - Valerie needs to pay the water bill and the electric bill separately.
   - Number of bills = 2 (water bill and electric bill)
   - The water bill requires 1 stamp, and the electric bill requires 2 stamps.
   - Total stamps for bills = 1 stamp (water bill) + 2 stamps (electric bill) = 3 stamps

3. **Mail-in Rebates:**
   - Valerie wants to send three more mail-in rebates than she does bills.
   - Number of bills = 2
   - Number of mail-in rebates = Number of bills + 3 = 2 + 3 = 5
   - Each mail-in rebate requires 1 stamp.
   - Total stamps for mail-in rebates = 5 rebates × 1 stamp/rebate = 5 stamps

4. **Job Applications:**
   - Valerie has twice as many job applications as rebates to mail.
   - Number of mail-in rebates = 5
   - Number of job applications = 2 × Number of rebates = 2 × 5 = 10
   - Each job application requires 1 stamp.
   - Total stamps for job applications = 10 applications × 1 stamp/application = 10 stamps

5. **Total Stamps Needed:**
   - Add up all the stamps needed for each category:
   \[
   \text{Total stamps} = (\text{stamps for thank you cards}) + (\text{stamps for bills}) + (\text{stamps for rebates}) + (\text{stamps for job applications})
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total stamps} = 3 + 3 + 5 + 10 = 21
   \]

Therefore, Valerie needs a total of 21 stamps. 

**Final Answer: 21 stamps**
