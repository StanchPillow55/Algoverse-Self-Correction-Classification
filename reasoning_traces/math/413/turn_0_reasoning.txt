==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to determine how many green balls Ryan has, given the total number of balls and the quantities of red and blue balls.

1. **Identify the total number of balls**: 
   Ryan has a total of 40 balls.

2. **Identify the number of blue balls**: 
   According to the problem, Ryan has 11 blue balls.

3. **Determine the number of red balls**: 
   The problem states that there are twice as many red balls as blue balls. Since there are 11 blue balls, we can calculate the number of red balls as follows:
   \[
   \text{Number of red balls} = 2 \times \text{Number of blue balls} = 2 \times 11 = 22
   \]

4. **Calculate the total number of red and blue balls**: 
   Now we can find the total number of red and blue balls combined:
   \[
   \text{Total red and blue balls} = \text{Number of red balls} + \text{Number of blue balls} = 22 + 11 = 33
   \]

5. **Determine the number of green balls**: 
   To find the number of green balls, we subtract the total number of red and blue balls from the total number of balls:
   \[
   \text{Number of green balls} = \text{Total number of balls} - \text{Total red and blue balls} = 40 - 33 = 7
   \]

6. **Final answer**: 
   Therefore, the number of green balls Ryan has is:
   \[
   \boxed{7}
   \]
