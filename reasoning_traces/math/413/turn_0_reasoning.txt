==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine how many green balls Ryan has, given the total number of balls and the relationship between the red and blue balls.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the given information:**
   - Total number of balls = 40
   - There are twice as many red balls as blue balls.
   - The number of blue balls = 11

2. **Determine the number of red balls:**
   Since there are twice as many red balls as blue balls, we can express the number of red balls as:
   \[
   \text{Number of red balls} = 2 \times \text{Number of blue balls} = 2 \times 11 = 22
   \]

3. **Calculate the total number of red and blue balls:**
   \[
   \text{Total number of red and blue balls} = \text{Number of red balls} + \text{Number of blue balls} = 22 + 11 = 33
   \]

4. **Determine the number of green balls:**
   Since the total number of balls is 40, and we have already accounted for the red and blue balls, the remaining balls must be green. Therefore, the number of green balls is:
   \[
   \text{Number of green balls} = \text{Total number of balls} - \text{Total number of red and blue balls} = 40 - 33 = 7
   \]

5. **Conclusion:**
   Ryan has 7 green balls.

Thus, the final answer is that there are \(\boxed{7}\) green balls.
