To solve the problem, we need to determine how many of Marcy's candles will both smell like wet dog and explode.

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - Marcy makes 50,000 candles.
   - 99% of the candles are guaranteed not to explode, which means 1% of the candles are expected to explode.
   - Among the candles that are more dangerous (which we can assume are the ones that explode), 5% have a defect that makes them smell like wet dog.

2. **Calculating the Number of Exploding Candles**:
   - First, we calculate the number of candles that are expected to explode:
     \[
     \text{Number of exploding candles} = 1\% \text{ of } 50000
     \]
     \[
     \text{Number of exploding candles} = 0.01 \times 50000 = 500
     \]

3. **Calculating the Number of Candles that Smell Like Wet Dog**:
   - Next, we find out how many of the exploding candles smell like wet dog. Since 5% of the more dangerous candles (the ones that explode) have this defect:
     \[
     \text{Number of candles that smell like wet dog} = 5\% \text{ of the exploding candles}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Number of candles that smell like wet dog} = 0.05 \times 500 = 25
     \]

4. **Final Answer**:
   - Therefore, the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode is:
     \[
     \boxed{25}
     \] 

This means that out of the 50,000 candles Marcy makes, 25 of them are expected to both explode and smell like wet dog.
