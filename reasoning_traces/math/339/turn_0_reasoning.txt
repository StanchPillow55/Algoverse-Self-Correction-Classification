To solve this problem, we need to determine how many of Terez's cows are pregnant females. Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Total Number of Cows:**
   Terez has a total of 44 cows on his farm.

2. **Determine the Number of Female Cows:**
   We are told that 50 percent of the cows are female. To find the number of female cows, we calculate 50 percent of 44.

   \[
   \text{Number of female cows} = 0.50 \times 44 = 22
   \]

   So, there are 22 female cows on the farm.

3. **Determine the Number of Pregnant Female Cows:**
   We are also told that 50 percent of the female cows are pregnant. To find the number of pregnant female cows, we calculate 50 percent of the 22 female cows.

   \[
   \text{Number of pregnant female cows} = 0.50 \times 22 = 11
   \]

   Therefore, there are 11 pregnant female cows on the farm.

4. **Final Answer:**
   Terez has 11 pregnant female cows.

By following these steps, we have determined that the number of pregnant female cows on Terez's farm is 11.
