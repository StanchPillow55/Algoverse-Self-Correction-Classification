Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the number of female cows:**
   Terez has a total of 44 cows on his farm. According to the problem, 50 percent of these cows are female. 

   To find the number of female cows, we calculate:
   \[
   \text{Number of female cows} = 50\% \text{ of } 44 = \frac{50}{100} \times 44 = 0.5 \times 44 = 22
   \]

2. **Determine the number of pregnant female cows:**
   The problem states that 50 percent of the female cows are pregnant. Now that we know there are 22 female cows, we can calculate the number of pregnant female cows.

   To find the number of pregnant female cows, we calculate:
   \[
   \text{Number of pregnant female cows} = 50\% \text{ of } 22 = \frac{50}{100} \times 22 = 0.5 \times 22 = 11
   \]

3. **Final answer:**
   Therefore, the number of pregnant female cows that Terez has is:
   \[
   \boxed{11}
   \]
