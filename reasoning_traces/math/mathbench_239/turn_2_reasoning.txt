Question ID: mathbench_239
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we first need to understand what "Sample math problem 239" refers to. Since no specific details are provided about this problem, I'll create a hypothetical math problem labeled as "Sample math problem 239" and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem 239:**

"Calculate the sum of the first 10 positive integers and then find the average of these numbers."

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Identify the first 10 positive integers:**
   The first 10 positive integers are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10.

2. **Calculate the sum of these integers:**
   To find the sum, we add all these numbers together:
   \[
   1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 10
   \]

   We can pair the numbers from the ends towards the center to simplify the addition:
   \[
   (1 + 10) + (2 + 9) + (3 + 8) + (4 + 7) + (5 + 6)
   \]

   Each pair sums to 11:
   \[
   11 + 11 + 11 + 11 + 11 = 5 \times 11 = 55
   \]

   Therefore, the sum of the first 10 positive integers is 55.

3. **Calculate the average of these integers:**
   The average is found by dividing the sum by the number of integers:
   \[
   \text{Average} = \frac{\text{Sum of integers}}{\text{Number of integers}} = \frac{55}{10} = 5.5
   \]

**Final Answer:**

The sum of the first 10 positive integers is 55, and their average is 5.5.
