Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve "Sample math problem 239," we first need to understand what the problem is asking. Since the problem is not explicitly stated, let's assume that "Sample math problem 239" refers to a specific math problem that involves a typical mathematical operation or concept. For the sake of this exercise, let's assume it involves solving a quadratic equation, as this is a common type of math problem.

Let's assume the problem is:

Solve the quadratic equation: \( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \).

To solve this quadratic equation, we can use the quadratic formula:

\[ x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \]

**Step-by-step Solution:**

1. **Identify the coefficients:**
   - \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \) are the coefficients of the quadratic equation. For this example, let's assume \( a = 1 \), \( b = -3 \), and \( c = 2 \).

2. **Calculate the discriminant:**
   - The discriminant \( D \) is given by \( D = b^2 - 4ac \).
   - Substitute the values: \( D = (-3)^2 - 4 \times 1 \times 2 = 9 - 8 = 1 \).

3. **Determine the nature of the roots:**
   - Since the discriminant \( D = 1 \) is greater than 0, the quadratic equation has two distinct real roots.

4. **Apply the quadratic formula:**
   - Substitute the values into the quadratic formula:
   \[
   x = \frac{-(-3) \pm \sqrt{1}}{2 \times 1} = \frac{3 \pm 1}{2}
   \]

5. **Calculate the roots:**
   - First root: \( x_1 = \frac{3 + 1}{2} = \frac{4}{2} = 2 \)
   - Second root: \( x_2 = \frac{3 - 1}{2} = \frac{2}{2} = 1 \)

**Final Answer:**

The solutions to the quadratic equation \( x^2 - 3x + 2 = 0 \) are \( x = 2 \) and \( x = 1 \).

This is a complete solution to the assumed problem, showing all calculations and reasoning. If "Sample math problem 239" refers to a different problem, please provide the specific details or context of the problem for an accurate solution.
