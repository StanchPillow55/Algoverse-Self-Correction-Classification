==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 239," we need to first understand what the problem is asking. However, the problem statement is not provided in the question. Therefore, I will assume a hypothetical math problem related to the number 239 and solve it step by step.

Let's assume the problem is as follows:

**Problem:** Determine if 239 is a prime number.

**Step 1: Understand the definition of a prime number.**
A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.

**Step 2: Check if 239 is greater than 1.**
239 is indeed greater than 1, so it could potentially be a prime number.

**Step 3: Check divisibility by prime numbers up to the square root of 239.**
To determine if 239 is a prime number, we need to check if it is divisible by any prime numbers up to its square root. The square root of 239 is approximately 15.46. Therefore, we need to check divisibility by the prime numbers less than or equal to 15, which are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, and 13.

- **Divisibility by 2:** 239 is an odd number, so it is not divisible by 2.
- **Divisibility by 3:** To check divisibility by 3, sum the digits of 239: \(2 + 3 + 9 = 14\). Since 14 is not divisible by 3, 239 is not divisible by 3.
- **Divisibility by 5:** Numbers divisible by 5 end in 0 or 5. 239 ends in 9, so it is not divisible by 5.
- **Divisibility by 7:** Perform the division \(239 \div 7\). The result is approximately 34.14, which is not an integer, so 239 is not divisible by 7.
- **Divisibility by 11:** Use the alternating sum rule for divisibility by 11: \(2 - 3 + 9 = 8\). Since 8 is not divisible by 11, 239 is not divisible by 11.
- **Divisibility by 13:** Perform the division \(239 \div 13\). The result is approximately 18.38, which is not an integer, so 239 is not divisible by 13.

**Step 4: Conclusion.**
Since 239 is not divisible by any prime numbers up to its square root, it has no divisors other than 1 and itself. Therefore, 239 is a prime number.

**Final Answer:**
239 is a prime number.
