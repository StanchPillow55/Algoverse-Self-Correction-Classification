==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 239," we first need to understand what the problem is asking. Since the problem statement is not provided, I'll assume this is a placeholder for a typical math problem. Let's create a sample problem and solve it step by step.

**Sample Problem 239:**
Calculate the sum of the first 20 positive integers.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   We need to find the sum of the first 20 positive integers. The sequence of these integers is: 1, 2, 3, ..., 20.

2. **Identify the Formula:**
   The sum of the first \( n \) positive integers can be calculated using the formula:
   \[
   S = \frac{n(n + 1)}{2}
   \]
   where \( S \) is the sum and \( n \) is the number of terms.

3. **Substitute the Values:**
   Here, \( n = 20 \). Substitute 20 into the formula:
   \[
   S = \frac{20(20 + 1)}{2}
   \]

4. **Calculate Inside the Parentheses:**
   First, calculate \( 20 + 1 \):
   \[
   20 + 1 = 21
   \]

5. **Multiply:**
   Now multiply 20 by 21:
   \[
   20 \times 21 = 420
   \]

6. **Divide:**
   Finally, divide 420 by 2 to find the sum:
   \[
   S = \frac{420}{2} = 210
   \]

7. **Conclusion:**
   The sum of the first 20 positive integers is 210.

**Final Answer:**
The sum of the first 20 positive integers is 210.
