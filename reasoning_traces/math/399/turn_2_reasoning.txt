==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to determine how long it takes Tony to assemble one widget. We will first calculate the total number of widgets assembled by Sam, Jack, and Tony during their respective working hours.

1. **Calculate Sam's output:**
   - Sam assembles 1 widget every 10 minutes.
   - In 6 hours, Sam works for \(6 \times 60 = 360\) minutes.
   - The number of widgets Sam assembles is:
     \[
     \text{Widgets by Sam} = \frac{360 \text{ minutes}}{10 \text{ minutes/widget}} = 36 \text{ widgets}
     \]

2. **Calculate Jack's output:**
   - When Sam and Jack work together, they assemble 2 widgets every 15 minutes.
   - Jack helps for 4 hours, which is \(4 \times 60 = 240\) minutes.
   - The number of 15-minute intervals in 240 minutes is:
     \[
     \frac{240 \text{ minutes}}{15 \text{ minutes}} = 16
     \]
   - Therefore, the number of widgets Jack and Sam assemble together in that time is:
     \[
     \text{Widgets by Sam and Jack} = 2 \text{ widgets/interval} \times 16 \text{ intervals} = 32 \text{ widgets}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total output from Sam and Jack:**
   - Since Sam worked for 6 hours and Jack helped for 4 hours, we need to consider that Jack was helping Sam for 4 hours of the 6 hours Sam worked.
   - Thus, the total widgets assembled by Sam and Jack together is:
     \[
     \text{Total widgets by Sam and Jack} = 32 \text{ widgets}
     \]

4. **Calculate Tony's output:**
   - The total number of widgets completed at the end of the day is 68.
   - Therefore, the number of widgets assembled by Tony is:
     \[
     \text{Widgets by Tony} = 68 - 36 - 32 = 0 \text{ widgets}
     \]
   - This means Tony did not contribute any widgets, which is not possible. We need to recalculate the output correctly.

5. **Reassess Jack's contribution:**
   - Jack can only help for 4 hours, but we need to consider that he can only help when Sam is working. Since Sam worked for 6 hours, Jack's contribution overlaps with Sam's work.
   - Therefore, Jack's contribution is indeed 32 widgets, and Sam's contribution is 36 widgets.

6. **Calculate the total output:**
   - The total number of widgets assembled by Sam and Jack is:
     \[
     \text{Total widgets by Sam and Jack} = 36 + 32 = 68 \text{ widgets}
     \]
   - Since they completed 68 widgets, it means Tony did not assemble any widgets.

7. **Determine Tony's assembly time:**
   - Since Tony did not contribute to the assembly of widgets, we cannot determine how long it takes him to assemble a widget based on the information provided.

Thus, the problem does not provide enough information to determine how long it takes Tony to assemble a widget, as he did not contribute to the total of 68 widgets assembled. 

Final answer: **Not enough information to determine Tony's assembly time.**
