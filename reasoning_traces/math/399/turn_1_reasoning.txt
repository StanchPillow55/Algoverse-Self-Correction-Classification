==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine how long it takes Tony to assemble a widget. We'll start by calculating how many widgets Sam and Jack assembled, and then use that information to find out how many widgets Tony assembled.

### Step 1: Calculate Sam's Production

Sam can assemble 1 widget every 10 minutes. He worked for 6 hours. First, convert hours to minutes:

\[ 6 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 360 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, calculate how many widgets Sam assembled in 360 minutes:

\[ \frac{360 \text{ minutes}}{10 \text{ minutes/widget}} = 36 \text{ widgets} \]

### Step 2: Calculate Jack's Production

When Jack helps, together with Sam, they assemble 2 widgets every 15 minutes. Jack helped for 4 hours. Convert hours to minutes:

\[ 4 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 240 \text{ minutes} \]

Calculate how many 15-minute intervals are in 240 minutes:

\[ \frac{240 \text{ minutes}}{15 \text{ minutes/interval}} = 16 \text{ intervals} \]

Since they assemble 2 widgets per interval, calculate the total number of widgets assembled when Jack helps:

\[ 16 \text{ intervals} \times 2 \text{ widgets/interval} = 32 \text{ widgets} \]

### Step 3: Determine Widgets Assembled by Sam and Jack Together

Since Sam worked for 6 hours, and Jack helped for 4 of those hours, we need to account for the overlap:

- In the 4 hours Jack helped, they assembled 32 widgets together.
- In the remaining 2 hours (120 minutes) that Sam worked alone, he assembled:

\[ \frac{120 \text{ minutes}}{10 \text{ minutes/widget}} = 12 \text{ widgets} \]

Total widgets assembled by Sam and Jack:

\[ 32 \text{ widgets (together)} + 12 \text{ widgets (Sam alone)} = 44 \text{ widgets} \]

### Step 4: Calculate Tony's Production

The total number of widgets assembled by the end of the day was 68. Therefore, the number of widgets Tony assembled is:

\[ 68 \text{ total widgets} - 44 \text{ widgets (Sam and Jack)} = 24 \text{ widgets} \]

### Step 5: Determine Tony's Rate

Tony worked the entire 8-hour shift. Convert hours to minutes:

\[ 8 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 480 \text{ minutes} \]

Tony assembled 24 widgets in 480 minutes. Calculate the time it takes Tony to assemble one widget:

\[ \frac{480 \text{ minutes}}{24 \text{ widgets}} = 20 \text{ minutes/widget} \]

### Final Answer

It takes Tony 20 minutes to assemble a widget.
