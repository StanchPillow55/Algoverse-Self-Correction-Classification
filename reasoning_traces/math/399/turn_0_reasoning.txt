Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to establish the ages of Alice, Beth, and Erica based on the information given.

1. **Identify Erica's age**: 
   We know that Erica is 30 years old.

   \[
   \text{Erica's age} = 30 \text{ years}
   \]

2. **Determine Beth's age**: 
   The problem states that Beth is 5 years older than Erica. Therefore, we can calculate Beth's age by adding 5 years to Erica's age.

   \[
   \text{Beth's age} = \text{Erica's age} + 5 = 30 + 5 = 35 \text{ years}
   \]

3. **Determine Alice's age**: 
   Next, we know that Alice is 7 years older than Beth. We can find Alice's age by adding 7 years to Beth's age.

   \[
   \text{Alice's age} = \text{Beth's age} + 7 = 35 + 7 = 42 \text{ years}
   \]

4. **Calculate the difference between Alice's age and Erica's age**: 
   Finally, we need to find the difference between Alice's age and Erica's age.

   \[
   \text{Difference} = \text{Alice's age} - \text{Erica's age} = 42 - 30 = 12 \text{ years}
   \]

Thus, the difference between the ages of Alice and Erica is \( \boxed{12} \) years.
