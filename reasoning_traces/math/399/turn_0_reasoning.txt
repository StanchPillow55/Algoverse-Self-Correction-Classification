To solve this problem, we need to determine the rate at which each person assembles widgets and then use this information to find out how long it takes Tony to assemble one widget.

### Step 1: Determine the rates of Sam and Jack

1. **Sam's Rate:**
   - Sam assembles 1 widget every 10 minutes.
   - In terms of widgets per minute, Sam's rate is \( \frac{1}{10} \) widgets per minute.

2. **Combined Rate of Sam and Jack:**
   - Together, Sam and Jack assemble 2 widgets every 15 minutes.
   - In terms of widgets per minute, their combined rate is \( \frac{2}{15} \) widgets per minute.

3. **Jack's Rate:**
   - To find Jack's rate, we subtract Sam's rate from their combined rate:
   \[
   \text{Jack's rate} = \frac{2}{15} - \frac{1}{10}
   \]
   - To subtract these fractions, find a common denominator (30):
   \[
   \frac{2}{15} = \frac{4}{30}, \quad \frac{1}{10} = \frac{3}{30}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Jack's rate} = \frac{4}{30} - \frac{3}{30} = \frac{1}{30} \text{ widgets per minute}
   \]

### Step 2: Calculate the total widgets assembled by Sam and Jack

1. **Widgets assembled by Sam:**
   - Sam worked for 6 hours. Convert hours to minutes: \( 6 \times 60 = 360 \) minutes.
   - Widgets assembled by Sam: \( 360 \times \frac{1}{10} = 36 \) widgets.

2. **Widgets assembled by Jack:**
   - Jack worked for 4 hours. Convert hours to minutes: \( 4 \times 60 = 240 \) minutes.
   - Widgets assembled by Jack: \( 240 \times \frac{1}{30} = 8 \) widgets.

### Step 3: Determine the number of widgets assembled by Tony

- Total widgets assembled by all three: 68 widgets.
- Widgets assembled by Sam and Jack together: \( 36 + 8 = 44 \) widgets.
- Therefore, widgets assembled by Tony: \( 68 - 44 = 24 \) widgets.

### Step 4: Calculate Tony's rate and time per widget

1. **Tony's Rate:**
   - Tony worked for the entire 8-hour shift. Convert hours to minutes: \( 8 \times 60 = 480 \) minutes.
   - Tony's rate is \( \frac{24}{480} = \frac{1}{20} \) widgets per minute.

2. **Time for Tony to assemble one widget:**
   - Since Tony assembles \( \frac{1}{20} \) widgets per minute, it takes him 20 minutes to assemble one widget.

### Final Answer

Tony takes 20 minutes to assemble one widget.
