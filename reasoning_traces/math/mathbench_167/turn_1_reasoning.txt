==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 167," we first need to understand what the problem is asking. However, the problem statement is incomplete as it only says "Sample math problem 167" without any specific details or context. 

Since there is no specific math problem provided, I will create a hypothetical math problem labeled as "Sample math problem 167" and solve it step by step. Let's assume the problem is as follows:

**Sample Math Problem 167:**
Solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 3x + 5 = 20 \).

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Equation:**
   The equation given is \( 3x + 5 = 20 \). This is a linear equation in one variable, \( x \).

2. **Isolate the Variable:**
   To solve for \( x \), we need to isolate \( x \) on one side of the equation. We can do this by performing inverse operations.

3. **Subtract 5 from Both Sides:**
   To eliminate the constant term on the left side, subtract 5 from both sides of the equation:
   \[
   3x + 5 - 5 = 20 - 5
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   3x = 15
   \]

4. **Divide by 3:**
   To solve for \( x \), divide both sides of the equation by 3:
   \[
   \frac{3x}{3} = \frac{15}{3}
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   x = 5
   \]

5. **Verify the Solution:**
   Substitute \( x = 5 \) back into the original equation to verify the solution:
   \[
   3(5) + 5 = 20
   \]
   Simplifying the left side gives:
   \[
   15 + 5 = 20
   \]
   \[
   20 = 20
   \]
   The left side equals the right side, confirming that our solution is correct.

**Final Answer:**
The solution to the equation \( 3x + 5 = 20 \) is \( x = 5 \).
