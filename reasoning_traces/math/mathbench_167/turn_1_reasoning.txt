==================================================

To solve the problem, we first need to understand what "Sample math problem 167" refers to. Since the problem itself isn't provided, I'll create a hypothetical math problem and solve it step by step. Let's assume "Sample math problem 167" is the following:

**Problem:**
Calculate the sum of the first 167 positive integers.

**Solution:**

To find the sum of the first \( n \) positive integers, we can use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series. The formula for the sum \( S \) of the first \( n \) positive integers is:

\[
S = \frac{n(n + 1)}{2}
\]

In this problem, \( n = 167 \). Plugging this value into the formula gives:

\[
S = \frac{167 \times (167 + 1)}{2}
\]

First, calculate \( 167 + 1 \):

\[
167 + 1 = 168
\]

Next, multiply 167 by 168:

\[
167 \times 168 = 28056
\]

Now, divide 28056 by 2 to find the sum:

\[
S = \frac{28056}{2} = 14028
\]

Thus, the sum of the first 167 positive integers is 14,028.

**Final Answer:**
The sum of the first 167 positive integers is 14,028.
