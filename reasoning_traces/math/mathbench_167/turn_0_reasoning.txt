To solve the problem, we first need to know what "Sample math problem 167" entails. Since the problem statement is not provided, I'll create a sample math problem and solve it step by step.

**Sample Math Problem 167:**

Calculate the area of a triangle with vertices at points A(2, 3), B(8, 3), and C(5, 7).

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

To find the area of a triangle given its vertices, we can use the formula derived from the determinant of a matrix:

\[
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \left| x_1(y_2-y_3) + x_2(y_3-y_1) + x_3(y_1-y_2) \right|
\]

Where \((x_1, y_1)\), \((x_2, y_2)\), and \((x_3, y_3)\) are the coordinates of the vertices A, B, and C, respectively.

Given:
- \(A(2, 3)\) \(\Rightarrow (x_1, y_1) = (2, 3)\)
- \(B(8, 3)\) \(\Rightarrow (x_2, y_2) = (8, 3)\)
- \(C(5, 7)\) \(\Rightarrow (x_3, y_3) = (5, 7)\)

Plug these coordinates into the formula:

\[
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \left| 2(3-7) + 8(7-3) + 5(3-3) \right|
\]

Calculate each term:

1. \(2(3-7) = 2(-4) = -8\)
2. \(8(7-3) = 8 \times 4 = 32\)
3. \(5(3-3) = 5 \times 0 = 0\)

Substitute these values back into the formula:

\[
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \left| -8 + 32 + 0 \right|
\]

Simplify inside the absolute value:

\[
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \left| 24 \right|
\]

Since the absolute value of 24 is 24, we have:

\[
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times 24 = 12
\]

**Final Answer:**

The area of the triangle with vertices at points A(2, 3), B(8, 3), and C(5, 7) is 12 square units.
