Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem effectively, I need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 79" entails. However, since the problem statement is not provided, I'll demonstrate a general approach to solving a typical math problem by making an assumption about the type of problem it could be. Let's assume it's a problem involving algebra, such as solving an equation. 

### Problem Assumption:
Let's assume the problem is to solve the following equation for \( x \):

\[ 2x + 5 = 15 \]

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Identify the Equation:**
   The equation given is:
   \[
   2x + 5 = 15
   \]

2. **Isolate the Variable:**
   To solve for \( x \), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We start by eliminating the constant term on the left side. We do this by subtracting 5 from both sides of the equation:
   \[
   2x + 5 - 5 = 15 - 5
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   2x = 10
   \]

3. **Solve for \( x \):**
   Now, we need to solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides of the equation by 2:
   \[
   \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{10}{2}
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   x = 5
   \]

4. **Verify the Solution:**
   To ensure our solution is correct, we substitute \( x = 5 \) back into the original equation:
   \[
   2(5) + 5 = 15
   \]
   Simplifying the left side gives:
   \[
   10 + 5 = 15
   \]
   Since both sides of the equation are equal, our solution is verified.

### Final Answer:
The solution to the equation \( 2x + 5 = 15 \) is \( x = 5 \).

If "Sample reasoning question 79" refers to a different type of problem, please provide the specific details or context of the problem, and I will be happy to solve it accordingly.
