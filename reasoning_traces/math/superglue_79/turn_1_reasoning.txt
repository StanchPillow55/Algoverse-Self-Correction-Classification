==================================================

To solve the problem effectively, I need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 79" refers to. Since I don't have access to external databases or specific documents, I will assume this is a hypothetical math problem. Without specific details, I'll create a sample math problem and solve it step-by-step.

**Sample Problem:**

A company produces two types of widgets: Type A and Type B. The company sells Type A widgets for $50 each and Type B widgets for $70 each. Last month, the company sold a total of 500 widgets and earned $30,000 in revenue. How many of each type of widget did the company sell?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( x \) be the number of Type A widgets sold.
   - Let \( y \) be the number of Type B widgets sold.

2. **Set Up Equations:**
   - From the problem, we know the total number of widgets sold is 500. Therefore, the first equation is:
     \[
     x + y = 500
     \]
   - We also know the total revenue is $30,000. The revenue from Type A widgets is \( 50x \) and from Type B widgets is \( 70y \). Therefore, the second equation is:
     \[
     50x + 70y = 30,000
     \]

3. **Solve the System of Equations:**
   - We have the system:
     \[
     \begin{cases} 
     x + y = 500 \\
     50x + 70y = 30,000 
     \end{cases}
     \]

   - Solve the first equation for \( y \):
     \[
     y = 500 - x
     \]

   - Substitute \( y = 500 - x \) into the second equation:
     \[
     50x + 70(500 - x) = 30,000
     \]

   - Simplify and solve for \( x \):
     \[
     50x + 35,000 - 70x = 30,000
     \]
     \[
     -20x + 35,000 = 30,000
     \]
     \[
     -20x = 30,000 - 35,000
     \]
     \[
     -20x = -5,000
     \]
     \[
     x = \frac{-5,000}{-20} = 250
     \]

   - Substitute \( x = 250 \) back into the equation for \( y \):
     \[
     y = 500 - 250 = 250
     \]

4. **Verify the Solution:**
   - Check the total number of widgets:
     \[
     x + y = 250 + 250 = 500
     \]
   - Check the total revenue:
     \[
     50x + 70y = 50(250) + 70(250) = 12,500 + 17,500 = 30,000
     \]

Both conditions are satisfied, confirming the solution is correct.

**Final Answer:**
The company sold 250 Type A widgets and 250 Type B widgets.
