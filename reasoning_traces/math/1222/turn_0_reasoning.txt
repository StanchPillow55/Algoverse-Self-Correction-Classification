==================================================

To determine how much fabric Luke should buy for the curtains, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total width of the windows**: 
   - Luke has 5 windows, and each window is 35 inches wide.
   - To find the total width of all the windows, we multiply the number of windows by the width of each window:
     \[
     \text{Total width of windows} = \text{Number of windows} \times \text{Width of each window}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total width of windows} = 5 \times 35 \text{ inches}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total width of windows} = 175 \text{ inches}
     \]

2. **Calculate the amount of fabric needed**:
   - Luke needs to buy fabric equal to 2 times the total width of the windows.
   - We can calculate this by multiplying the total width of the windows by 2:
     \[
     \text{Amount of fabric needed} = 2 \times \text{Total width of windows}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Amount of fabric needed} = 2 \times 175 \text{ inches}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Amount of fabric needed} = 350 \text{ inches}
     \]

3. **Final answer**:
   - Therefore, Luke should buy **350 inches** of fabric for the curtains.

In conclusion, after calculating the total width of the windows and determining the required fabric, the final answer is:
\[
\text{Luke should buy } 350 \text{ inches of fabric.}
\]
