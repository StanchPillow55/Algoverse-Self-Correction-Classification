Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 176" refers to. Since the problem statement does not provide specific details about the question, I'll demonstrate a general approach to solving a typical math problem by breaking it down into steps. Let's assume a sample math problem for demonstration purposes:

**Sample Problem:**
Calculate the area of a right triangle with a base of 6 units and a height of 8 units.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We are given a right triangle.
   - The base of the triangle is 6 units.
   - The height of the triangle is 8 units.
   - We need to find the area of the triangle.

2. **Recall the Formula for the Area of a Triangle:**
   - The area \( A \) of a triangle is given by the formula:
     \[
     A = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height}
     \]

3. **Substitute the Given Values into the Formula:**
   - Base = 6 units
   - Height = 8 units
   - Substitute these values into the formula:
     \[
     A = \frac{1}{2} \times 6 \times 8
     \]

4. **Perform the Calculations:**
   - First, calculate the product of the base and height:
     \[
     6 \times 8 = 48
     \]
   - Then, multiply by \(\frac{1}{2}\):
     \[
     A = \frac{1}{2} \times 48 = 24
     \]

5. **State the Final Answer:**
   - The area of the right triangle is 24 square units.

By following these steps, we have solved the problem by understanding the requirements, recalling the relevant formula, substituting the given values, performing the calculations, and stating the final answer. If you have a specific "Sample reasoning question 176" in mind, please provide the details, and I can work through that specific problem.
