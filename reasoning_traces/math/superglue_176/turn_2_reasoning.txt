==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 176" refers to. Since the problem statement does not provide specific details about the question, I'll demonstrate a general approach to solving a reasoning-based math problem. 

Let's assume "Sample reasoning question 176" is a typical math problem that involves logical reasoning and calculations. I'll create a hypothetical problem and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**

A farmer has a total of 176 apples. He wants to distribute these apples equally among his 8 friends. After distributing the apples, he wants to keep the remaining apples for himself. How many apples will each friend receive, and how many apples will the farmer keep?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - Total apples = 176
   - Number of friends = 8
   - We need to find out how many apples each friend receives and how many apples are left for the farmer.

2. **Calculate Apples per Friend:**
   - To find out how many apples each friend receives, we divide the total number of apples by the number of friends.
   \[
   \text{Apples per friend} = \frac{176}{8}
   \]

3. **Perform the Division:**
   - Divide 176 by 8.
   \[
   176 \div 8 = 22
   \]
   - Each friend receives 22 apples.

4. **Calculate Remaining Apples:**
   - To find out how many apples are left for the farmer, we calculate the remainder of the division.
   - Since 176 is exactly divisible by 8, the remainder is 0.
   \[
   \text{Remaining apples} = 176 - (8 \times 22) = 176 - 176 = 0
   \]

5. **Conclusion:**
   - Each friend receives 22 apples.
   - The farmer keeps 0 apples because there are no apples left after distribution.

**Final Answer:**
Each friend receives 22 apples, and the farmer keeps 0 apples.
