==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 176" refers to. Since the question is not explicitly provided, I'll create a hypothetical math problem and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**

A company produces two types of products: A and B. The profit from each unit of product A is $30, and the profit from each unit of product B is $50. The company can produce a maximum of 200 units of product A and 150 units of product B per month. However, due to resource constraints, the total production of products A and B combined cannot exceed 300 units per month. How many units of each product should the company produce to maximize profit?

**Solution:**

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( x \) be the number of units of product A produced.
   - Let \( y \) be the number of units of product B produced.

2. **Objective Function:**
   - The profit function \( P \) can be expressed as:
     \[
     P = 30x + 50y
     \]
   - Our goal is to maximize \( P \).

3. **Constraints:**
   - The production constraints are:
     \[
     x \leq 200
     \]
     \[
     y \leq 150
     \]
     \[
     x + y \leq 300
     \]
   - Additionally, \( x \geq 0 \) and \( y \geq 0 \) since negative production is not possible.

4. **Graphical Solution:**
   - Plot the constraints on a graph with \( x \) on the horizontal axis and \( y \) on the vertical axis.
   - The feasible region is the area where all constraints overlap.

5. **Identify Corner Points:**
   - The corner points of the feasible region are found by solving the system of equations formed by the intersection of the constraints:
     - Intersection of \( x = 200 \) and \( x + y = 300 \): \( (200, 100) \)
     - Intersection of \( y = 150 \) and \( x + y = 300 \): \( (150, 150) \)
     - Intersection of \( x = 0 \) and \( y = 150 \): \( (0, 150) \)
     - Intersection of \( y = 0 \) and \( x = 200 \): \( (200, 0) \)

6. **Evaluate Profit at Each Corner Point:**
   - \( P(200, 100) = 30(200) + 50(100) = 6000 + 5000 = 11000 \)
   - \( P(150, 150) = 30(150) + 50(150) = 4500 + 7500 = 12000 \)
   - \( P(0, 150) = 30(0) + 50(150) = 0 + 7500 = 7500 \)
   - \( P(200, 0) = 30(200) + 50(0) = 6000 + 0 = 6000 \)

7. **Determine Maximum Profit:**
   - The maximum profit is \( 12000 \), which occurs at the point \( (150, 150) \).

**Final Answer:**
The company should produce 150 units of product A and 150 units of product B to maximize profit, resulting in a maximum profit of $12,000.
