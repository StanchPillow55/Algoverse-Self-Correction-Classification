==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 176" refers to. Since this is not a standard math problem or a commonly known question, I'll assume it's a placeholder for a specific type of reasoning or math problem. Without specific details, I'll demonstrate how to approach a generic reasoning problem step by step.

Let's assume "Sample reasoning question 176" is a logic puzzle or a mathematical reasoning problem. Here's a step-by-step approach to solving a typical reasoning problem:

### Step 1: Understand the Problem
- **Identify the type of problem:** Is it a logic puzzle, a mathematical equation, or a word problem?
- **Read the problem carefully:** Make sure you understand all the given information and what is being asked.

### Step 2: Gather Information
- **List known facts:** Write down all the information provided in the problem.
- **Identify unknowns:** Determine what you need to find or solve.

### Step 3: Develop a Plan
- **Choose a strategy:** Decide on a method to solve the problem. This could be drawing a diagram, creating a table, writing an equation, or logical deduction.
- **Break it down:** If the problem is complex, break it into smaller, more manageable parts.

### Step 4: Execute the Plan
- **Carry out calculations:** Perform any necessary calculations or logical steps.
- **Keep track of your work:** Write down each step to avoid confusion and ensure accuracy.

### Step 5: Review and Check
- **Verify your solution:** Check your work to ensure it makes sense and that you have answered the question.
- **Consider alternative solutions:** Sometimes there may be more than one way to solve a problem.

### Example Problem
Let's create an example problem to illustrate this process:

**Problem:** A farmer has chickens and cows. There are 22 heads and 56 legs in total. How many chickens and how many cows are there?

**Step 1: Understand the Problem**
- Chickens have 1 head and 2 legs.
- Cows have 1 head and 4 legs.
- Total heads = 22
- Total legs = 56

**Step 2: Gather Information**
- Let \( x \) be the number of chickens.
- Let \( y \) be the number of cows.

**Step 3: Develop a Plan**
- We have two equations based on the problem:
  1. \( x + y = 22 \) (total heads)
  2. \( 2x + 4y = 56 \) (total legs)

**Step 4: Execute the Plan**
- Solve the system of equations:
  1. From \( x + y = 22 \), we can express \( y \) as \( y = 22 - x \).
  2. Substitute \( y = 22 - x \) into the second equation:
     \[
     2x + 4(22 - x) = 56
     \]
     \[
     2x + 88 - 4x = 56
     \]
     \[
     -2x + 88 = 56
     \]
     \[
     -2x = 56 - 88
     \]
     \[
     -2x = -32
     \]
     \[
     x = 16
     \]
  3. Substitute \( x = 16 \) back into \( y = 22 - x \):
     \[
     y = 22 - 16 = 6
     \]

**Step 5: Review and Check**
- Check the solution:
  - Total heads: \( 16 + 6 = 22 \) ✔️
  - Total legs: \( 2(16) + 4(6) = 32 + 24 = 56 \) ✔️

**Final Answer:**
- There are 16 chickens and 6 cows.

This is a complete solution to a typical reasoning problem involving systems of equations. If "Sample reasoning question 176" refers to a different type of problem, please provide more details for a specific solution.
