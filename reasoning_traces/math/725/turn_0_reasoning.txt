==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to determine the time it takes for both the cat and the dog to eat nine sausages, and then calculate the average time taken by both.

**Step 1: Calculate the time taken by the cat.**

The problem states that the cat eats nine sausages in 30 minutes. Therefore, the time taken by the cat is:

\[
\text{Time taken by cat} = 30 \text{ minutes}
\]

**Step 2: Calculate the time taken by the dog.**

The dog can eat the same number of sausages (nine) in \( \frac{2}{3} \) of the time it takes the cat. Since the cat takes 30 minutes, we calculate the time for the dog as follows:

\[
\text{Time taken by dog} = \frac{2}{3} \times 30 \text{ minutes}
\]

Calculating this gives:

\[
\text{Time taken by dog} = \frac{2 \times 30}{3} = \frac{60}{3} = 20 \text{ minutes}
\]

**Step 3: Calculate the average time taken by the cat and the dog.**

To find the average time taken by both the cat and the dog, we use the formula for the average:

\[
\text{Average time} = \frac{\text{Time taken by cat} + \text{Time taken by dog}}{2}
\]

Substituting the values we found:

\[
\text{Average time} = \frac{30 \text{ minutes} + 20 \text{ minutes}}{2}
\]

Calculating this gives:

\[
\text{Average time} = \frac{50 \text{ minutes}}{2} = 25 \text{ minutes}
\]

**Final Answer:**

The average time taken by the cat and the dog to eat the sausages is:

\[
\boxed{25 \text{ minutes}}
\]
