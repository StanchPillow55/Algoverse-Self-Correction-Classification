==================================================

To solve the problem, I first need to understand what "Sample math problem 286" refers to. Since I don't have the specific details of this problem, I'll demonstrate how to approach a generic math problem by creating an example problem and solving it step by step.

Let's assume "Sample math problem 286" is a problem involving solving a quadratic equation. Here's an example problem:

**Problem:** Solve the quadratic equation \(2x^2 - 4x - 6 = 0\).

**Step 1: Identify the coefficients.**

The standard form of a quadratic equation is \(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\). For the equation \(2x^2 - 4x - 6 = 0\), the coefficients are:
- \(a = 2\)
- \(b = -4\)
- \(c = -6\)

**Step 2: Use the quadratic formula.**

The quadratic formula is given by:

\[
x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
\]

**Step 3: Calculate the discriminant.**

The discriminant \(\Delta\) is the part of the quadratic formula under the square root: \(b^2 - 4ac\).

\[
\Delta = (-4)^2 - 4 \times 2 \times (-6)
\]
\[
\Delta = 16 + 48
\]
\[
\Delta = 64
\]

**Step 4: Calculate the roots using the quadratic formula.**

Since the discriminant is positive (\(\Delta = 64\)), there are two real and distinct roots.

\[
x = \frac{-(-4) \pm \sqrt{64}}{2 \times 2}
\]
\[
x = \frac{4 \pm 8}{4}
\]

Calculate the two possible values for \(x\):

1. \(x_1 = \frac{4 + 8}{4} = \frac{12}{4} = 3\)

2. \(x_2 = \frac{4 - 8}{4} = \frac{-4}{4} = -1\)

**Step 5: State the final answer.**

The solutions to the quadratic equation \(2x^2 - 4x - 6 = 0\) are \(x = 3\) and \(x = -1\).

This is a complete solution to the assumed problem, demonstrating the process of solving a quadratic equation using the quadratic formula. If "Sample math problem 286" refers to a different type of problem, please provide more details or context, and I can adjust the solution accordingly.
