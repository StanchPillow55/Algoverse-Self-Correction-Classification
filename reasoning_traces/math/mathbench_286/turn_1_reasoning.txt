Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem labeled "Sample math problem 286," I would need the specific details of the problem. Since the problem itself is not provided, I'll demonstrate how to approach a typical math problem by creating a sample problem and solving it step by step.

Let's assume "Sample math problem 286" is the following:

**Problem:**  
Solve for \( x \) in the equation:  
\[ 3x + 5 = 20 \]

**Step-by-step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Equation:**
   The equation given is a linear equation in one variable, \( x \). Our goal is to isolate \( x \) on one side of the equation to find its value.

2. **Isolate the Variable:**
   To isolate \( x \), we need to perform operations that will leave \( x \) alone on one side of the equation. We start by eliminating the constant term on the left side.

   \[ 3x + 5 = 20 \]

   Subtract 5 from both sides to remove the constant term from the left side:

   \[ 3x + 5 - 5 = 20 - 5 \]

   Simplifying both sides gives:

   \[ 3x = 15 \]

3. **Solve for \( x \):**
   Now, we need to solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides of the equation by the coefficient of \( x \), which is 3.

   \[ \frac{3x}{3} = \frac{15}{3} \]

   Simplifying both sides gives:

   \[ x = 5 \]

4. **Verify the Solution:**
   To ensure our solution is correct, we can substitute \( x = 5 \) back into the original equation and check if both sides are equal.

   Original equation:  
   \[ 3x + 5 = 20 \]

   Substitute \( x = 5 \):  
   \[ 3(5) + 5 = 20 \]

   Simplify:  
   \[ 15 + 5 = 20 \]

   \[ 20 = 20 \]

   Since both sides of the equation are equal, our solution is verified.

**Final Answer:**
The solution to the equation \( 3x + 5 = 20 \) is \( x = 5 \).
