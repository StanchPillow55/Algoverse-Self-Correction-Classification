Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem effectively, I need to first understand what "Sample math problem 286" entails. Since the problem is not explicitly stated, I will create a hypothetical math problem and solve it step by step. Let's assume the problem is as follows:

**Problem:**  
Solve for \( x \) in the equation:  
\[ 3x + 5 = 2x + 9 \]

**Step-by-step Solution:**

1. **Identify the equation:**  
   The given equation is:
   \[ 3x + 5 = 2x + 9 \]

2. **Isolate the variable \( x \):**  
   To solve for \( x \), we need to get all terms containing \( x \) on one side of the equation and constant terms on the other side. We can start by subtracting \( 2x \) from both sides of the equation to eliminate \( x \) from the right side:
   \[
   3x + 5 - 2x = 2x + 9 - 2x
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   x + 5 = 9
   \]

3. **Solve for \( x \):**  
   Next, subtract 5 from both sides to isolate \( x \):
   \[
   x + 5 - 5 = 9 - 5
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   x = 4
   \]

4. **Verify the solution:**  
   Substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies the equation:
   \[
   3(4) + 5 = 2(4) + 9
   \]
   Calculate both sides:
   \[
   12 + 5 = 8 + 9
   \]
   \[
   17 = 17
   \]
   Since both sides of the equation are equal, the solution \( x = 4 \) is verified.

**Final Answer:**  
The solution to the equation \( 3x + 5 = 2x + 9 \) is \( x = 4 \).
