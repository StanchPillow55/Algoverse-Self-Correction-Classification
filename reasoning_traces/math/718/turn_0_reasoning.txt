Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step, calculating the number of people at each stage of the hiring process.

1. **Total Applicants**: There are 100 people who apply for the job.

2. **Interviews**: We know that 30% of the applicants receive interviews. To find the number of people who receive interviews, we calculate:
   \[
   \text{Number of interviews} = 100 \times 0.30 = 30
   \]

3. **Job Offers**: Of those who receive interviews, 20% receive a job offer. We calculate the number of job offers as follows:
   \[
   \text{Number of job offers} = 30 \times 0.20 = 6
   \]

4. **Acceptances**: Finally, of those who receive a job offer, one third accept the position. We calculate the number of people who accept the job offer:
   \[
   \text{Number of acceptances} = 6 \times \frac{1}{3} = 2
   \]

Now, let's summarize the calculations:
- Total applicants: 100
- Interviews received: 30 (30% of 100)
- Job offers made: 6 (20% of 30)
- Job offers accepted: 2 (1/3 of 6)

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{2}
\] 

This means that 2 people accept the job position at Google.
