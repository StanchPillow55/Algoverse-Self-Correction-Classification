==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample reasoning question 444," let's first clarify what the problem is asking. Since the problem statement is not fully detailed, I'll assume it's a placeholder for a mathematical reasoning question. I'll create a hypothetical problem based on the number 444 and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**
"Calculate the sum of the digits of the number 444, and then determine if this sum is a prime number."

**Step 1: Calculate the sum of the digits of 444.**

The number 444 consists of three digits: 4, 4, and 4.

To find the sum of these digits:
\[ 4 + 4 + 4 = 12 \]

**Step 2: Determine if the sum (12) is a prime number.**

A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. Let's check if 12 is a prime number by finding its divisors.

The divisors of 12 are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 12.

Since 12 has divisors other than 1 and itself, it is not a prime number.

**Final Answer:**
The sum of the digits of 444 is 12, and 12 is not a prime number.
