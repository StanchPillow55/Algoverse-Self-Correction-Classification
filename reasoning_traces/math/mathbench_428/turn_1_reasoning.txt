Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we first need to understand what "Sample math problem 428" refers to. Since the problem isn't explicitly stated, I'll assume it's a placeholder for a typical math problem. Let's create a hypothetical problem to solve:

**Problem:**  
Solve for \( x \) in the equation:  
\[ 3x + 5 = 20 \]

**Step-by-step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Equation:**
   The equation \( 3x + 5 = 20 \) is a linear equation in one variable, \( x \). Our goal is to isolate \( x \) on one side of the equation.

2. **Isolate the Term with \( x \):**
   To isolate the term with \( x \), we need to eliminate the constant term on the left side. We do this by subtracting 5 from both sides of the equation:
   \[
   3x + 5 - 5 = 20 - 5
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   3x = 15
   \]

3. **Solve for \( x \):**
   Now, we need to solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides of the equation by 3 (the coefficient of \( x \)):
   \[
   \frac{3x}{3} = \frac{15}{3}
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   x = 5
   \]

4. **Verify the Solution:**
   To ensure our solution is correct, we substitute \( x = 5 \) back into the original equation:
   \[
   3(5) + 5 = 20
   \]
   Simplifying the left side:
   \[
   15 + 5 = 20
   \]
   \[
   20 = 20
   \]
   The left side equals the right side, confirming that our solution is correct.

**Final Answer:**
The solution to the equation \( 3x + 5 = 20 \) is \( x = 5 \).
