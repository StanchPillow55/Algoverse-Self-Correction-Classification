==================================================

To solve the problem, I need to first understand what "Sample math problem 428" refers to. Since I don't have access to external databases or specific problem sets, I'll create a hypothetical math problem that could be labeled as "Sample math problem 428" and solve it step by step.

Let's assume "Sample math problem 428" is the following:

**Problem:**
A rectangle has a length that is 3 times its width. If the perimeter of the rectangle is 48 units, find the dimensions of the rectangle.

**Solution:**

1. **Understand the problem:**
   - We have a rectangle with a length (L) and a width (W).
   - The length is 3 times the width: \( L = 3W \).
   - The perimeter of the rectangle is 48 units.

2. **Recall the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle:**
   \[
   \text{Perimeter} = 2L + 2W
   \]

3. **Substitute the expression for L in terms of W into the perimeter formula:**
   \[
   2(3W) + 2W = 48
   \]

4. **Simplify the equation:**
   \[
   6W + 2W = 48
   \]
   \[
   8W = 48
   \]

5. **Solve for W:**
   \[
   W = \frac{48}{8} = 6
   \]

6. **Find L using the relationship \( L = 3W \):**
   \[
   L = 3 \times 6 = 18
   \]

7. **Verify the solution:**
   - Calculate the perimeter with these dimensions:
     \[
     2L + 2W = 2(18) + 2(6) = 36 + 12 = 48
     \]
   - The calculated perimeter matches the given perimeter, confirming our solution is correct.

**Final Answer:**
The dimensions of the rectangle are:
- Width (W) = 6 units
- Length (L) = 18 units
