==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 428," we first need to understand what the problem is asking. However, the problem statement "Sample math problem 428" is not specific enough for us to determine the exact mathematical question or context. Therefore, I will assume that "Sample math problem 428" is a placeholder for a specific math problem that you would like to solve.

Since I don't have the details of the actual problem, I'll demonstrate how to approach a generic math problem by creating a sample problem and solving it step-by-step. Let's assume "Sample math problem 428" is a problem involving solving a quadratic equation. Here's an example problem:

**Example Problem:**
Solve the quadratic equation: \(2x^2 - 4x - 6 = 0\).

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Identify the quadratic equation:** 
   The given equation is \(2x^2 - 4x - 6 = 0\).

2. **Simplify the equation if possible:**
   Check if the equation can be simplified by dividing all terms by a common factor. In this case, all terms are divisible by 2:
   \[
   \frac{2x^2}{2} - \frac{4x}{2} - \frac{6}{2} = 0 \implies x^2 - 2x - 3 = 0
   \]

3. **Factor the quadratic equation:**
   Look for two numbers that multiply to the constant term (-3) and add to the linear coefficient (-2). The numbers -3 and 1 satisfy these conditions:
   \[
   x^2 - 2x - 3 = (x - 3)(x + 1) = 0
   \]

4. **Solve for the roots:**
   Set each factor equal to zero and solve for \(x\):
   \[
   x - 3 = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad x + 1 = 0
   \]
   Solving these gives:
   \[
   x = 3 \quad \text{or} \quad x = -1
   \]

5. **Verify the solutions:**
   Substitute \(x = 3\) and \(x = -1\) back into the original equation to verify:
   - For \(x = 3\):
     \[
     2(3)^2 - 4(3) - 6 = 18 - 12 - 6 = 0
     \]
   - For \(x = -1\):
     \[
     2(-1)^2 - 4(-1) - 6 = 2 + 4 - 6 = 0
     \]

Both solutions satisfy the original equation.

**Final Answer:**
The solutions to the quadratic equation \(2x^2 - 4x - 6 = 0\) are \(x = 3\) and \(x = -1\).
