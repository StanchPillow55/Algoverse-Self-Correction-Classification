Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem effectively, let's first understand what "Sample reasoning question 263" might entail. Since the problem statement is not explicitly provided, I'll demonstrate a general approach to solving a typical math problem by breaking it down into steps. 

### Step 1: Understand the Problem
Without a specific problem statement, let's assume a common type of math problem, such as solving a linear equation, finding the area of a geometric shape, or calculating a probability. For this example, I'll choose solving a linear equation.

### Step 2: Choose a Specific Problem
Let's solve the linear equation: 
\[ 3x + 5 = 20 \]

### Step 3: Solve the Equation
To solve for \( x \), we need to isolate the variable on one side of the equation. Here are the steps:

1. **Subtract 5 from both sides**: 
   \[
   3x + 5 - 5 = 20 - 5
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   3x = 15
   \]

2. **Divide both sides by 3**:
   \[
   \frac{3x}{3} = \frac{15}{3}
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   x = 5
   \]

### Step 4: Verify the Solution
Substitute \( x = 5 \) back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies the equation:
\[ 
3(5) + 5 = 20 
\]
\[ 
15 + 5 = 20 
\]
\[ 
20 = 20 
\]
The left-hand side equals the right-hand side, confirming that \( x = 5 \) is indeed the correct solution.

### Step 5: State the Final Answer
The solution to the equation \( 3x + 5 = 20 \) is \( x = 5 \).

This approach demonstrates a structured way to solve a math problem by understanding the problem, solving it step-by-step, verifying the solution, and stating the final answer. If you have a specific problem or need a different type of example, please provide more details!
