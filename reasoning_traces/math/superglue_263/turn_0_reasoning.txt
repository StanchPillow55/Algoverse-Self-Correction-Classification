==================================================

To solve the problem, I need more specific information about "Sample reasoning question 263." Since the details of the question are not provided, I'll demonstrate how to approach a generic math problem step by step. If you have a specific question or topic in mind, please provide more details.

Let's consider a typical math problem involving algebra:

**Problem:** Solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).

**Step 1: Understand the Problem**
The goal is to find the value of \( x \) that makes the equation true. The equation given is a linear equation in one variable.

**Step 2: Isolate the Variable**
To solve for \( x \), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We can do this by performing operations that will leave \( x \) by itself.

**Step 3: Perform Operations**
- Start with the equation: \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).
- Subtract 3 from both sides to get rid of the constant term on the left side:
  \[
  2x + 3 - 3 = 11 - 3
  \]
  Simplifying both sides gives:
  \[
  2x = 8
  \]

- Now, divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( x \):
  \[
  \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{8}{2}
  \]
  Simplifying both sides gives:
  \[
  x = 4
  \]

**Step 4: Verify the Solution**
Substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies the equation:
- Original equation: \( 2x + 3 = 11 \)
- Substitute \( x = 4 \):
  \[
  2(4) + 3 = 8 + 3 = 11
  \]
  Since both sides of the equation are equal, \( x = 4 \) is indeed the correct solution.

**Final Answer:**
The solution to the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \) is \( x = 4 \).

If you have a specific problem or a different type of question, please provide the details, and I can work through that specific problem for you.
