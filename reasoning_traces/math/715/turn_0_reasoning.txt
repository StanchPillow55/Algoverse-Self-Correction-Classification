==================================================

To solve the problem, we will follow these steps:

1. **Determine the original price per computer.**
   The company planned to buy each computer for $700.

2. **Calculate the increase in price due to the 10% increase.**
   To find the new price per computer, we need to calculate 10% of the original price and then add that to the original price.

   \[
   \text{Increase in price} = 10\% \text{ of } 700 = 0.10 \times 700 = 70
   \]

   Now, we add this increase to the original price:

   \[
   \text{New price per computer} = 700 + 70 = 770
   \]

3. **Calculate the total cost for 500 computers at the new price.**
   Now that we have the new price per computer, we can calculate the total cost for 500 computers:

   \[
   \text{Total cost} = \text{Number of computers} \times \text{New price per computer}
   \]

   Substituting the values we have:

   \[
   \text{Total cost} = 500 \times 770
   \]

   Now, we perform the multiplication:

   \[
   500 \times 770 = 385000
   \]

4. **State the final answer.**
   The total amount of money the company paid to buy the computers at the new prices is:

   \[
   \boxed{385000}
   \]
