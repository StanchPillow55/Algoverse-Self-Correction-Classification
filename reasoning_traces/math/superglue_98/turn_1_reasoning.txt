==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 98" refers to. However, without specific details or context about what "Sample reasoning question 98" entails, we can only provide a general approach to solving a reasoning question.

Let's assume that "Sample reasoning question 98" is a typical math problem that involves logical reasoning and calculations. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step approach to solving a generic math reasoning problem:

### Step 1: Understand the Problem
- **Read the problem carefully:** Make sure you understand what is being asked. Identify the key information and what the problem is asking you to find or prove.

### Step 2: Identify Known and Unknown Variables
- **List what you know:** Write down all the given information and any relevant formulas or theorems.
- **Identify what you need to find:** Clearly state what the unknowns are.

### Step 3: Develop a Plan
- **Choose a strategy:** Decide on a method to solve the problem. This could involve algebraic manipulation, drawing a diagram, logical reasoning, or breaking the problem into smaller parts.

### Step 4: Execute the Plan
- **Perform calculations:** Carefully carry out the necessary calculations. Show all your work step by step.
- **Use logical reasoning:** If the problem involves logical steps, ensure each step follows logically from the previous one.

### Step 5: Review and Check
- **Verify your solution:** Check your calculations and reasoning to ensure they are correct.
- **Consider alternative solutions:** If time permits, think about whether there might be another way to solve the problem.

### Step 6: State the Final Answer
- **Clearly state your answer:** Make sure your final answer is clearly presented and answers the question posed.

Since we don't have the specific details of "Sample reasoning question 98," this is a general framework for approaching reasoning problems. If you can provide more details or context about the specific problem, I can give a more targeted solution.
