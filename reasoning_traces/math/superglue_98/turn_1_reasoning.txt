Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample reasoning question 98," we need to first understand what the problem is asking. However, the question as presented is incomplete and lacks specific details or numerical data to work with. Therefore, I will demonstrate a general approach to solving a typical math problem by creating a hypothetical example.

Let's assume the problem is a basic algebraic equation:

**Example Problem:**
Solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Equation:**
   The equation given is \( 2x + 3 = 11 \). Our goal is to solve for \( x \).

2. **Isolate the Variable:**
   To isolate \( x \), we need to get rid of the constant term on the left side of the equation. We do this by subtracting 3 from both sides:

   \[
   2x + 3 - 3 = 11 - 3
   \]

   Simplifying both sides gives:

   \[
   2x = 8
   \]

3. **Solve for \( x \):**
   Now, we need to isolate \( x \) by dividing both sides of the equation by 2:

   \[
   \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{8}{2}
   \]

   Simplifying both sides gives:

   \[
   x = 4
   \]

4. **Verify the Solution:**
   Substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies the equation:

   \[
   2(4) + 3 = 11
   \]

   Simplifying the left side:

   \[
   8 + 3 = 11
   \]

   Since both sides of the equation are equal, our solution \( x = 4 \) is correct.

**Final Answer:**
The solution to the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \) is \( x = 4 \).

This example illustrates the typical process of solving a simple algebraic equation. If you have a specific problem or more details about "Sample reasoning question 98," please provide them, and I can offer a more tailored solution.
