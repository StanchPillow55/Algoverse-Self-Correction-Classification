==================================================

It seems like the question "Sample reasoning question 98" is a placeholder or lacks specific details about the problem to be solved. To provide a complete solution, I need more information about the problem itself. However, I can guide you on how to approach a typical math problem by outlining a general problem-solving strategy.

### General Problem-Solving Strategy:

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - Read the problem carefully.
   - Identify what is being asked.
   - Determine what information is given and what needs to be found.

2. **Devise a Plan:**
   - Consider possible strategies to solve the problem, such as drawing a diagram, creating an equation, or breaking the problem into smaller parts.
   - Choose the most appropriate method based on the problem type.

3. **Carry Out the Plan:**
   - Execute the chosen strategy step by step.
   - Perform calculations carefully.
   - Keep track of units and ensure consistency.

4. **Review/Check the Solution:**
   - Verify that the solution answers the question posed.
   - Check calculations for accuracy.
   - Consider whether the solution is reasonable and makes sense in the context of the problem.

5. **State the Final Answer:**
   - Clearly write the final answer, ensuring it is in the correct form and includes units if applicable.

### Example Problem:

Since the original question lacks details, let's consider an example problem:

**Example Problem:**
Solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).

**Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We need to find the value of \( x \) that satisfies the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).

2. **Devise a Plan:**
   - Isolate \( x \) by performing algebraic operations.

3. **Carry Out the Plan:**
   - Subtract 3 from both sides of the equation:
     \[
     2x + 3 - 3 = 11 - 3
     \]
     \[
     2x = 8
     \]
   - Divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( x \):
     \[
     \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{8}{2}
     \]
     \[
     x = 4
     \]

4. **Review/Check the Solution:**
   - Substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation to verify:
     \[
     2(4) + 3 = 8 + 3 = 11
     \]
   - The left side equals the right side, confirming the solution is correct.

5. **State the Final Answer:**
   - The solution to the equation is \( x = 4 \).

If you have a specific problem or additional details, please provide them, and I can work through that particular problem for you.
