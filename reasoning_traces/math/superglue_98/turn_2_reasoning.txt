==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 98" refers to. Since the problem statement is not specific, I'll assume this is a placeholder for a typical math problem. Let's create a hypothetical math problem and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**

Let's assume "Sample reasoning question 98" is a problem involving solving a quadratic equation. Here's the problem:

Solve the quadratic equation: \(2x^2 - 4x - 6 = 0\).

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Identify the coefficients:**
   The given quadratic equation is \(2x^2 - 4x - 6 = 0\).
   Here, the coefficients are:
   - \(a = 2\)
   - \(b = -4\)
   - \(c = -6\)

2. **Use the quadratic formula:**
   The quadratic formula to find the roots of \(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\) is:
   \[
   x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
   \]

3. **Calculate the discriminant:**
   The discriminant \(\Delta\) is given by \(b^2 - 4ac\).
   \[
   \Delta = (-4)^2 - 4 \times 2 \times (-6) = 16 + 48 = 64
   \]

4. **Evaluate the roots using the quadratic formula:**
   Since the discriminant is positive (\(\Delta = 64\)), there are two distinct real roots.
   \[
   x = \frac{-(-4) \pm \sqrt{64}}{2 \times 2}
   \]
   \[
   x = \frac{4 \pm 8}{4}
   \]

5. **Calculate the two roots:**
   - First root:
     \[
     x_1 = \frac{4 + 8}{4} = \frac{12}{4} = 3
     \]
   - Second root:
     \[
     x_2 = \frac{4 - 8}{4} = \frac{-4}{4} = -1
     \]

6. **Verify the solution:**
   Substitute \(x_1 = 3\) and \(x_2 = -1\) back into the original equation to verify:
   - For \(x_1 = 3\):
     \[
     2(3)^2 - 4(3) - 6 = 18 - 12 - 6 = 0
     \]
   - For \(x_2 = -1\):
     \[
     2(-1)^2 - 4(-1) - 6 = 2 + 4 - 6 = 0
     \]

Both roots satisfy the original equation, confirming they are correct.

**Final Answer:**
The solutions to the quadratic equation \(2x^2 - 4x - 6 = 0\) are \(x = 3\) and \(x = -1\).
