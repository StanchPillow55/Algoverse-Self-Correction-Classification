Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 98" refers to. Since the problem statement is not clear or specific, I'll assume that this is a placeholder for a typical math problem. Let's create a hypothetical math problem and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**

Calculate the value of \( x \) in the equation:

\[ 3x + 5 = 20 \]

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Equation:**
   The equation given is a simple linear equation in one variable, \( x \). The goal is to isolate \( x \) on one side of the equation to find its value.

2. **Isolate the Variable \( x \):**
   To isolate \( x \), we need to perform operations that will leave \( x \) alone on one side of the equation.

   - Start with the equation:
     \[
     3x + 5 = 20
     \]

   - Subtract 5 from both sides to eliminate the constant term on the left side:
     \[
     3x + 5 - 5 = 20 - 5
     \]
     Simplifying both sides gives:
     \[
     3x = 15
     \]

3. **Solve for \( x \):**
   Now, divide both sides by 3 to solve for \( x \):
   \[
   \frac{3x}{3} = \frac{15}{3}
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   x = 5
   \]

4. **Verify the Solution:**
   Substitute \( x = 5 \) back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies the equation:
   \[
   3(5) + 5 = 20
   \]
   Simplifying the left side:
   \[
   15 + 5 = 20
   \]
   \[
   20 = 20
   \]
   Since both sides of the equation are equal, our solution \( x = 5 \) is verified.

**Final Answer:**

The value of \( x \) is \( 5 \).
