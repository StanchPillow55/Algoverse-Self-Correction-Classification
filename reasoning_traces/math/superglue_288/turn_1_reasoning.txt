==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 288" refers to. Since the problem statement is not explicitly given, I'll assume this is a placeholder for a specific math problem. Without the actual problem, I'll demonstrate a general approach to solving a math problem using logical reasoning and step-by-step calculations.

Let's assume "Sample reasoning question 288" is a typical algebra problem. Here's a hypothetical problem and how we would solve it:

**Hypothetical Problem:**
Solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 3x + 5 = 20 \).

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   We need to find the value of \( x \) that satisfies the equation \( 3x + 5 = 20 \).

2. **Isolate the Variable:**
   To solve for \( x \), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We start by eliminating the constant term on the left side.

   \[
   3x + 5 = 20
   \]

   Subtract 5 from both sides to remove the constant:

   \[
   3x + 5 - 5 = 20 - 5
   \]

   Simplifying both sides gives:

   \[
   3x = 15
   \]

3. **Solve for \( x \):**
   Now, divide both sides by 3 to solve for \( x \):

   \[
   \frac{3x}{3} = \frac{15}{3}
   \]

   Simplifying both sides gives:

   \[
   x = 5
   \]

4. **Verify the Solution:**
   Substitute \( x = 5 \) back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies the equation:

   \[
   3(5) + 5 = 20
   \]

   Calculate the left side:

   \[
   15 + 5 = 20
   \]

   Since both sides of the equation are equal, \( x = 5 \) is indeed the correct solution.

5. **State the Final Answer:**
   The solution to the equation \( 3x + 5 = 20 \) is \( x = 5 \).

This is a demonstration of how to approach solving an algebraic equation. If "Sample reasoning question 288" refers to a different type of problem, please provide more details or context, and I can adjust the solution accordingly.
