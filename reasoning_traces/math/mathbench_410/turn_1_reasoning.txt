==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 410," we need to first understand what the problem is asking. However, the problem statement is incomplete as it only states "Sample math problem 410" without providing any specific details or context. Therefore, I will assume that "Sample math problem 410" is a placeholder for a specific math problem that needs to be solved.

Since I don't have the actual problem details, I'll demonstrate how to approach a generic math problem by creating a sample problem and solving it step-by-step. Let's assume the problem is as follows:

**Sample Math Problem:**
Solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 2x + 5 = 13 \).

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Equation:**
   The equation given is \( 2x + 5 = 13 \). This is a linear equation in one variable, \( x \).

2. **Isolate the Variable:**
   To solve for \( x \), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We can do this by performing inverse operations.

3. **Subtract 5 from Both Sides:**
   To eliminate the constant term on the left side, subtract 5 from both sides of the equation:
   \[
   2x + 5 - 5 = 13 - 5
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   2x = 8
   \]

4. **Divide by 2:**
   Now, divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( x \):
   \[
   \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{8}{2}
   \]
   Simplifying gives:
   \[
   x = 4
   \]

5. **Verify the Solution:**
   Substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation to verify:
   \[
   2(4) + 5 = 13
   \]
   Simplifying the left side:
   \[
   8 + 5 = 13
   \]
   Since both sides of the equation are equal, our solution \( x = 4 \) is correct.

**Final Answer:**
The solution to the equation \( 2x + 5 = 13 \) is \( x = 4 \).
