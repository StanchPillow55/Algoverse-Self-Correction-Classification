==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 410," we need to first understand what the problem is asking. However, the problem statement "Sample math problem 410" is not specific enough for us to determine the exact nature of the problem. It seems like a placeholder or a reference to a specific problem that is not provided here.

To proceed, let's assume that "Sample math problem 410" is a placeholder for a typical math problem. Since we don't have the actual problem, I'll create a sample math problem and solve it step by step.

### Sample Math Problem:
Let's assume the problem is as follows:

**Problem:** Solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 2x + 5 = 15 \).

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Understand the Equation:**
   The equation given is \( 2x + 5 = 15 \). This is a linear equation in one variable, \( x \).

2. **Isolate the Variable:**
   To solve for \( x \), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We can do this by performing operations that will simplify the equation.

3. **Subtract 5 from Both Sides:**
   To eliminate the constant term on the left side, subtract 5 from both sides of the equation:
   \[
   2x + 5 - 5 = 15 - 5
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   2x = 10
   \]

4. **Divide by 2:**
   To solve for \( x \), divide both sides of the equation by 2:
   \[
   \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{10}{2}
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   x = 5
   \]

5. **Verify the Solution:**
   Substitute \( x = 5 \) back into the original equation to verify:
   \[
   2(5) + 5 = 15
   \]
   Simplifying the left side gives:
   \[
   10 + 5 = 15
   \]
   Since both sides of the equation are equal, our solution \( x = 5 \) is correct.

### Final Answer:
The solution to the equation \( 2x + 5 = 15 \) is \( x = 5 \).
