==================================================

To solve the problem effectively, I need to first understand what "Sample math problem 195" refers to. Since the problem isn't explicitly stated, I'll create a hypothetical math problem with the number 195 and solve it step by step.

Let's assume the problem is as follows:

**Problem:**  
Find the prime factorization of the number 195 and determine if it is a prime number.

**Step-by-step Solution:**

1. **Determine if 195 is a prime number:**
   - A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.
   - To check if 195 is a prime number, we need to test divisibility by prime numbers up to the square root of 195.

2. **Calculate the square root of 195:**
   - \(\sqrt{195} \approx 13.96\)
   - We need to test divisibility by prime numbers less than or equal to 13 (i.e., 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, and 13).

3. **Test divisibility by 2:**
   - 195 is an odd number, so it is not divisible by 2.

4. **Test divisibility by 3:**
   - A number is divisible by 3 if the sum of its digits is divisible by 3.
   - Sum of digits of 195: \(1 + 9 + 5 = 15\)
   - 15 is divisible by 3, so 195 is divisible by 3.

5. **Divide 195 by 3:**
   - \(195 \div 3 = 65\)

6. **Prime factorization of 65:**
   - Now, we need to factor 65.
   - Test divisibility by 5 (next prime number after 3):
     - A number is divisible by 5 if it ends in 0 or 5.
     - 65 ends in 5, so it is divisible by 5.
   - Divide 65 by 5:
     - \(65 \div 5 = 13\)

7. **Check if 13 is a prime number:**
   - 13 is a prime number because it has no divisors other than 1 and 13.

8. **Combine the factors:**
   - The prime factorization of 195 is \(3 \times 5 \times 13\).

9. **Conclusion:**
   - Since 195 can be factored into prime numbers, it is not a prime number.

**Final Answer:**
The prime factorization of 195 is \(3 \times 5 \times 13\). Therefore, 195 is not a prime number.
