Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, "Sample math problem 195," we need to first understand what the problem is asking. Since the problem is not explicitly stated, I'll create a hypothetical math problem labeled as "Sample math problem 195" and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem 195:**

"Calculate the sum of the first 195 positive integers."

To solve this problem, we can use the formula for the sum of the first \( n \) positive integers:

\[
S_n = \frac{n(n + 1)}{2}
\]

where \( S_n \) is the sum of the first \( n \) integers.

**Step-by-step Solution:**

1. **Identify \( n \):**  
   In this problem, \( n = 195 \).

2. **Apply the formula:**  
   Substitute \( n = 195 \) into the formula:

   \[
   S_{195} = \frac{195 \times (195 + 1)}{2}
   \]

3. **Calculate \( 195 + 1 \):**  
   \[
   195 + 1 = 196
   \]

4. **Multiply 195 by 196:**  
   \[
   195 \times 196 = 38220
   \]

5. **Divide the product by 2:**  
   \[
   \frac{38220}{2} = 19110
   \]

Therefore, the sum of the first 195 positive integers is \( 19110 \).

**Final Answer:**

The sum of the first 195 positive integers is \( 19110 \).
