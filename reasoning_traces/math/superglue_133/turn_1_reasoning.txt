==================================================

To solve the problem effectively, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 133" entails. However, since the question itself is not provided, I'll demonstrate a general approach to solving a typical math problem by using a hypothetical example. Let's assume the problem is as follows:

**Problem:**  
A farmer has a rectangular field that is 100 meters long and 60 meters wide. He wants to increase the area of the field by 50% by extending the length and width by the same amount. By how many meters should he extend each dimension?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - The original dimensions of the field are 100 meters (length) and 60 meters (width).
   - The original area of the field is calculated as:
     \[
     \text{Original Area} = \text{Length} \times \text{Width} = 100 \times 60 = 6000 \text{ square meters}
     \]
   - The farmer wants to increase this area by 50%. Therefore, the new area should be:
     \[
     \text{New Area} = 6000 + 0.5 \times 6000 = 6000 + 3000 = 9000 \text{ square meters}
     \]

2. **Set Up the Equation:**
   - Let \( x \) be the amount in meters by which both the length and the width are extended.
   - The new dimensions will be \( 100 + x \) meters and \( 60 + x \) meters.
   - The equation for the new area is:
     \[
     (100 + x)(60 + x) = 9000
     \]

3. **Expand the Equation:**
   - Expanding the left side, we have:
     \[
     100 \times 60 + 100x + 60x + x^2 = 9000
     \]
     \[
     6000 + 160x + x^2 = 9000
     \]

4. **Simplify and Solve the Quadratic Equation:**
   - Rearrange the equation:
     \[
     x^2 + 160x + 6000 = 9000
     \]
     \[
     x^2 + 160x - 3000 = 0
     \]
   - Solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula:
     \[
     x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
     \]
     where \( a = 1 \), \( b = 160 \), and \( c = -3000 \).

5. **Calculate the Discriminant:**
   - The discriminant \( b^2 - 4ac \) is:
     \[
     160^2 - 4 \times 1 \times (-3000) = 25600 + 12000 = 37600
     \]

6. **Find the Roots:**
   - Calculate the roots:
     \[
     x = \frac{-160 \pm \sqrt{37600}}{2}
     \]
     \[
     x = \frac{-160 \pm 194}{2}
     \]
   - This gives two potential solutions:
     \[
     x = \frac{34}{2} = 17 \quad \text{(positive root)}
     \]
     \[
     x = \frac{-354}{2} = -177 \quad \text{(negative root, not feasible)}
     \]

7. **Conclusion:**
   - The farmer should extend each dimension by 17 meters to achieve the desired increase in area.

**Final Answer:**
The farmer should extend each dimension by 17 meters.
