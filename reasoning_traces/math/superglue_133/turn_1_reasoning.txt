==================================================

To solve the problem effectively, let's first understand what is being asked. However, it seems like the problem statement "Sample reasoning question 133" is not providing any specific mathematical question or context. Therefore, I will demonstrate a general approach to solving a typical math problem by creating a hypothetical example.

Let's assume the problem is as follows:

**Problem:**  
A farmer has a rectangular field that is 150 meters long and 100 meters wide. He wants to build a fence around the field and also divide the field into two equal parts with a fence parallel to the shorter side. Calculate the total length of the fence required.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We have a rectangular field.
   - Dimensions: Length = 150 meters, Width = 100 meters.
   - We need to fence around the perimeter and also divide the field into two equal parts with a fence parallel to the shorter side (width).

2. **Calculate the Perimeter of the Field:**
   - The formula for the perimeter \( P \) of a rectangle is given by:
     \[
     P = 2 \times (\text{Length} + \text{Width})
     \]
   - Substituting the given values:
     \[
     P = 2 \times (150 + 100) = 2 \times 250 = 500 \text{ meters}
     \]

3. **Calculate the Length of the Dividing Fence:**
   - The dividing fence is parallel to the width and will span the length of the field.
   - Therefore, the length of the dividing fence is equal to the length of the field, which is 150 meters.

4. **Calculate the Total Length of the Fence Required:**
   - Total fence length = Perimeter of the field + Length of the dividing fence
   - Total fence length = 500 meters + 150 meters = 650 meters

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The total length of the fence required is 650 meters.

**Final Answer:**
The total length of the fence required is 650 meters.

This example illustrates how to approach a problem by breaking it down into smaller, manageable steps, performing calculations, and then synthesizing the results to arrive at the final answer. If you have a specific problem or need further assistance, please provide more details or context.
