Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 133" entails. Since the problem statement is not explicitly provided, I'll assume a generic approach to solving a typical math problem. Let's consider a sample math problem and solve it step-by-step.

**Sample Problem:**
Calculate the value of \( x \) in the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).

**Step-by-step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Equation:**
   The given equation is \( 2x + 3 = 11 \). This is a linear equation in one variable, \( x \).

2. **Isolate the Variable:**
   To find the value of \( x \), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We start by eliminating the constant term on the left side.

   Subtract 3 from both sides of the equation:
   \[
   2x + 3 - 3 = 11 - 3
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   2x = 8
   \]

3. **Solve for \( x \):**
   Now, we need to solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides by the coefficient of \( x \), which is 2.

   Divide both sides by 2:
   \[
   \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{8}{2}
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   x = 4
   \]

4. **Verify the Solution:**
   To ensure our solution is correct, substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation and check if both sides are equal.

   Substitute \( x = 4 \) into \( 2x + 3 = 11 \):
   \[
   2(4) + 3 = 11
   \]
   Simplifying the left side gives:
   \[
   8 + 3 = 11
   \]
   Since both sides are equal, our solution is verified.

**Final Answer:**
The value of \( x \) is 4.
