Question ID: 964
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to determine how many episodes John will watch and then calculate the total time he will spend watching those episodes.

1. **Identify the length of each episode**: 
   Each episode is 20 minutes long.

2. **Determine the number of episodes**: 
   The problem states that there are half as many episodes in total as there are minutes per episode. Since each episode is 20 minutes long, we can calculate the number of episodes as follows:
   \[
   \text{Number of episodes} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{minutes per episode} = \frac{1}{2} \times 20 = 10
   \]

3. **Calculate the total time spent watching the show**: 
   Now that we know there are 10 episodes, we can find the total time John will spend watching the show by multiplying the number of episodes by the length of each episode:
   \[
   \text{Total time} = \text{Number of episodes} \times \text{minutes per episode} = 10 \times 20 = 200 \text{ minutes}
   \]

4. **Final answer**: 
   Therefore, the total time John will spend watching the show is:
   \[
   \boxed{200} \text{ minutes}
   \]
