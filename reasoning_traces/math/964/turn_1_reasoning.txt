==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to determine how many minutes John will spend watching the show if he watches every episode. Let's break down the information given step by step.

1. **Identify the length of each episode**: 
   The problem states that each episode is 20 minutes long.

2. **Determine the total number of episodes**: 
   The problem also states that there are half as many episodes in total as there are minutes per episode. Since each episode is 20 minutes long, we can calculate the total number of episodes as follows:
   \[
   \text{Number of episodes} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{minutes per episode}
   \]
   Substituting the value of minutes per episode:
   \[
   \text{Number of episodes} = \frac{1}{2} \times 20 = 10
   \]

3. **Calculate the total time spent watching the show**: 
   Now that we know there are 10 episodes and each episode is 20 minutes long, we can find the total time John will spend watching the show:
   \[
   \text{Total time} = \text{Number of episodes} \times \text{minutes per episode}
   \]
   Substituting the values we have:
   \[
   \text{Total time} = 10 \times 20 = 200 \text{ minutes}
   \]

4. **Final answer**: 
   Therefore, the total time John will spend watching the show if he watches every episode is:
   \[
   \boxed{200} \text{ minutes}
   \]
