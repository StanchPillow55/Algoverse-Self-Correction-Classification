Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample reasoning question 72," we need to first understand what the problem is asking. However, the problem statement is incomplete as it only says "Sample reasoning question 72" without providing any specific details or context. Therefore, I will demonstrate how to approach a generic reasoning problem by outlining a step-by-step method that can be applied to a variety of reasoning questions.

### Step-by-Step Approach to Reasoning Problems

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - Carefully read the problem statement to identify what is being asked.
   - Determine the type of reasoning required (e.g., logical, mathematical, verbal).

2. **Identify Key Information:**
   - Highlight any important data or constraints given in the problem.
   - Note any patterns, sequences, or relationships that are mentioned.

3. **Formulate a Plan:**
   - Decide on a strategy to solve the problem. This could involve drawing diagrams, creating equations, or listing possibilities.
   - Consider if there are any known formulas or theorems that apply.

4. **Execute the Plan:**
   - Carry out the necessary calculations or logical steps.
   - Be systematic and methodical to avoid errors.

5. **Review and Verify:**
   - Check your work to ensure all steps are correct.
   - Verify that the solution meets all the conditions of the problem.

6. **State the Final Answer:**
   - Clearly present the solution, ensuring it answers the question posed.

### Example Problem and Solution

Let's apply this approach to a hypothetical reasoning problem:

**Example Problem:**
A sequence is defined as follows: The first term is 2, and each subsequent term is 3 more than twice the previous term. What is the fifth term in the sequence?

**Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We need to find the fifth term of a sequence with a specific recursive formula.

2. **Identify Key Information:**
   - First term (\(a_1\)) = 2
   - Recursive formula: \(a_{n} = 2a_{n-1} + 3\)

3. **Formulate a Plan:**
   - Calculate each term up to the fifth term using the recursive formula.

4. **Execute the Plan:**
   - \(a_1 = 2\)
   - \(a_2 = 2 \times 2 + 3 = 4 + 3 = 7\)
   - \(a_3 = 2 \times 7 + 3 = 14 + 3 = 17\)
   - \(a_4 = 2 \times 17 + 3 = 34 + 3 = 37\)
   - \(a_5 = 2 \times 37 + 3 = 74 + 3 = 77\)

5. **Review and Verify:**
   - Each step follows the recursive formula correctly.

6. **State the Final Answer:**
   - The fifth term in the sequence is 77.

Since the original problem statement "Sample reasoning question 72" lacks specific details, this example demonstrates how to approach a reasoning problem systematically. If you have a specific problem or additional details, please provide them for a more tailored solution.
