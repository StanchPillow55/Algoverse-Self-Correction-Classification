==================================================

To solve the problem effectively, let's first understand what is being asked. The problem statement is "Sample reasoning question 72," which is quite vague and doesn't provide specific details or numerical data to work with. However, the instruction "devils_advocate_v1" suggests that we might need to approach this problem from a critical thinking or reasoning perspective, possibly questioning assumptions or exploring different angles.

Since the problem lacks specific details, let's consider a hypothetical scenario where we need to apply reasoning skills to solve a problem. I'll create a sample reasoning problem and demonstrate how to solve it step-by-step.

**Sample Problem:**

A farmer has 72 apples and wants to distribute them equally among a certain number of baskets. Each basket must contain the same number of apples, and there should be no apples left over. What are the possible numbers of baskets the farmer can use?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We need to find the divisors of 72, as these will represent the possible numbers of baskets that can hold an equal number of apples without any remainder.

2. **Find the Divisors of 72:**
   - To find the divisors, we need to determine which numbers divide 72 evenly (i.e., with no remainder).
   - Start with the smallest numbers and work upwards:
     - 1 divides 72 (72 ÷ 1 = 72)
     - 2 divides 72 (72 ÷ 2 = 36)
     - 3 divides 72 (72 ÷ 3 = 24)
     - 4 divides 72 (72 ÷ 4 = 18)
     - 6 divides 72 (72 ÷ 6 = 12)
     - 8 divides 72 (72 ÷ 8 = 9)
     - 9 divides 72 (72 ÷ 9 = 8)
     - 12 divides 72 (72 ÷ 12 = 6)
     - 18 divides 72 (72 ÷ 18 = 4)
     - 24 divides 72 (72 ÷ 24 = 3)
     - 36 divides 72 (72 ÷ 36 = 2)
     - 72 divides 72 (72 ÷ 72 = 1)

3. **List the Divisors:**
   - The divisors of 72 are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 12, 18, 24, 36, 72.

4. **Interpret the Results:**
   - These divisors represent the possible numbers of baskets the farmer can use to distribute the apples equally.

5. **Final Answer:**
   - The possible numbers of baskets the farmer can use are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 12, 18, 24, 36, and 72.

By following these steps, we've reasoned through the problem and found all possible solutions. This approach demonstrates critical thinking and problem-solving skills, which are essential for tackling reasoning questions effectively.
