==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample reasoning question 72," we need to first understand the context and details of the problem. Since the problem statement is not fully provided, I'll demonstrate a general approach to solving a typical math problem, assuming it involves numerical reasoning or algebra.

Let's assume the problem is a typical algebraic equation or word problem. Hereâ€™s how we might approach solving it:

### Step 1: Understand the Problem
- **Read the Problem Carefully**: Ensure you understand what is being asked. Identify the key pieces of information and what the problem is asking you to find.
- **Identify Known and Unknown Variables**: Determine what information is given and what needs to be solved.

### Step 2: Develop a Plan
- **Choose a Strategy**: Decide on a method to solve the problem. This could involve setting up an equation, drawing a diagram, or using logical reasoning.
- **Set Up the Equation**: If applicable, translate the problem into a mathematical equation using variables to represent unknowns.

### Step 3: Execute the Plan
- **Solve the Equation**: Use algebraic methods to solve for the unknown variable(s). This might involve simplifying expressions, combining like terms, or using operations to isolate the variable.
- **Check Your Work**: Verify each step to ensure there are no arithmetic or algebraic errors.

### Step 4: Review and State the Final Answer
- **Interpret the Solution**: Once you have a solution, interpret it in the context of the problem to ensure it makes sense.
- **State the Final Answer**: Clearly write out the final answer, ensuring it addresses the question posed.

### Example Problem
Let's solve a sample algebra problem:

**Problem**: Solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).

#### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Understand the Problem**: We need to find the value of \( x \) that satisfies the equation.

2. **Develop a Plan**: We will isolate \( x \) by performing algebraic operations.

3. **Execute the Plan**:
   - Start with the equation: \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).
   - Subtract 3 from both sides to isolate the term with \( x \):
     \[
     2x + 3 - 3 = 11 - 3
     \]
     \[
     2x = 8
     \]
   - Divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( x \):
     \[
     \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{8}{2}
     \]
     \[
     x = 4
     \]

4. **Review and State the Final Answer**:
   - Substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation to verify:
     \[
     2(4) + 3 = 8 + 3 = 11
     \]
   - The solution is correct. Therefore, the final answer is \( x = 4 \).

By following these steps, we ensure a thorough and logical approach to solving math problems. If you have a specific problem or more details, please provide them, and I can tailor the solution to that particular question.
