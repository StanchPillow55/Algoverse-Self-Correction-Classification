==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 347" entails. Since the problem statement is not fully detailed, I'll assume it's a hypothetical math problem that requires a structured approach to solve. Let's break it down step by step:

### Step 1: Understand the Problem
Since the problem is not explicitly stated, let's assume it involves basic arithmetic operations or algebraic reasoning. For example, let's say the problem is:

**"If you have 347 apples and you give away 123 apples, how many apples do you have left?"**

### Step 2: Identify the Operation
The problem involves subtraction because we are giving away a certain number of apples from the total.

### Step 3: Set Up the Equation
We start with 347 apples and give away 123 apples. The equation to represent this situation is:

\[ 347 - 123 \]

### Step 4: Perform the Calculation
To solve the equation, we perform the subtraction:

1. **Subtract the units place:**
   - 7 (units in 347) - 3 (units in 123) = 4

2. **Subtract the tens place:**
   - 4 (tens in 347) - 2 (tens in 123) = 2

3. **Subtract the hundreds place:**
   - 3 (hundreds in 347) - 1 (hundreds in 123) = 2

So, the subtraction looks like this:

\[ 
\begin{array}{c}
  347 \\
- 123 \\
\hline
  224 \\
\end{array}
\]

### Step 5: Verify the Calculation
To ensure the subtraction is correct, we can add the number of apples given away back to the remaining apples:

\[ 224 + 123 = 347 \]

The addition checks out, confirming our subtraction was correct.

### Step 6: State the Final Answer
After giving away 123 apples, you have 224 apples left.

**Final Answer: 224 apples**
