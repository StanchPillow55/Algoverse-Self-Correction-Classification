To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 347" entails. Since there is no specific mathematical problem provided, I'll create a sample reasoning question and solve it step-by-step.

Let's assume the problem is as follows:

**Problem:**
A factory produces 347 widgets every day. Each widget requires 3 screws and 2 bolts. If the factory operates 5 days a week, how many screws and bolts are needed per week?

**Solution:**

1. **Calculate the total number of widgets produced per week:**
   - The factory produces 347 widgets per day.
   - It operates 5 days a week.
   - Total widgets per week = 347 widgets/day * 5 days/week = 1735 widgets/week.

2. **Calculate the total number of screws needed per week:**
   - Each widget requires 3 screws.
   - Total screws needed per week = 1735 widgets/week * 3 screws/widget = 5205 screws/week.

3. **Calculate the total number of bolts needed per week:**
   - Each widget requires 2 bolts.
   - Total bolts needed per week = 1735 widgets/week * 2 bolts/widget = 3470 bolts/week.

**Final Answer:**
The factory needs 5205 screws and 3470 bolts per week.
