==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to determine how many students in Miss Susan's class are good at math. We know the following:

1. Total number of students in the class: 20
2. Students good at math only: 5
3. Students good at English only: 8
4. Students good at both math and English: Let's denote this number as \( x \).

We can set up an equation based on the total number of students in the class. The total number of students can be expressed as the sum of students who are good at math only, students who are good at English only, and students who are good at both subjects:

\[
\text{Total students} = (\text{Students good at math only}) + (\text{Students good at English only}) + (\text{Students good at both})
\]

Substituting the known values into the equation, we have:

\[
20 = 5 + 8 + x
\]

Now, we can simplify the right side:

\[
20 = 13 + x
\]

Next, we solve for \( x \):

\[
x = 20 - 13
\]
\[
x = 7
\]

So, there are 7 students who are good at both math and English.

Now, to find the total number of students who are good at math, we need to add the number of students who are good at math only and those who are good at both subjects:

\[
\text{Total students good at math} = (\text{Students good at math only}) + (\text{Students good at both})
\]
\[
\text{Total students good at math} = 5 + 7
\]
\[
\text{Total students good at math} = 12
\]

Thus, the final answer is that there are **12 students** who are good at math.
