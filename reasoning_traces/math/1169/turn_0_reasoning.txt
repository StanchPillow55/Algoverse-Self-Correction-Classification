Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine how much money Rissa has:**
   - Ronnie was given $5.
   - Rissa was given thrice as much as Ronnie. Therefore, Rissa's amount is:
     \[
     Rissa's\ amount = 3 \times 5 = 15\ dollars
     \]

2. **Calculate how much money Rissa has left after giving some to her sister:**
   - After giving an equal amount of money to their little sister, Rissa is left with \( \frac{4}{5} \) of her money.
   - We first calculate \( \frac{4}{5} \) of Rissa's initial amount:
     \[
     Rissa's\ remaining\ amount = \frac{4}{5} \times 15 = 12\ dollars
     \]

3. **Determine how much Rissa gave to her little sister:**
   - To find out how much Rissa gave to her sister, we subtract her remaining amount from her initial amount:
     \[
     Amount\ given\ to\ sister = Rissa's\ initial\ amount - Rissa's\ remaining\ amount
     \]
     \[
     Amount\ given\ to\ sister = 15 - 12 = 3\ dollars
     \]

4. **Since Ronnie gave the same amount to their little sister, we know he also gave $3.**
   - Now we can calculate how much money Ronnie has left after giving $3 to his sister:
     \[
     Ronnie's\ remaining\ amount = Ronnie's\ initial\ amount - Amount\ given\ to\ sister
     \]
     \[
     Ronnie's\ remaining\ amount = 5 - 3 = 2\ dollars
     \]

5. **Final answer:**
   - The amount of money left in Ronnie's possession is:
     \[
     \boxed{2\ dollars}
     \]
