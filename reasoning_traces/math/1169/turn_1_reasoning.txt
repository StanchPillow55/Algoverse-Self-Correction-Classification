Question ID: 1169
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the amounts given to Ronnie and Rissa:**
   - Ronnie was given $5.
   - Rissa was given thrice as much as Ronnie, so:
     \[
     \text{Rissa's amount} = 3 \times 5 = 15 \text{ dollars}
     \]

2. **Calculate how much money Rissa has left after giving some to her sister:**
   - Rissa is left with \( \frac{4}{5} \) of her money after giving some to her sister. Therefore, we calculate:
     \[
     \text{Amount left for Rissa} = \frac{4}{5} \times 15 = 12 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Determine how much Rissa gave to her sister:**
   - To find out how much Rissa gave to her sister, we subtract the amount she has left from her original amount:
     \[
     \text{Amount given by Rissa} = 15 - 12 = 3 \text{ dollars}
     \]

4. **Since Ronnie and Rissa gave the same amount to their sister, Ronnie also gave 3 dollars:**
   - Therefore, we can find out how much money Ronnie has left:
     \[
     \text{Amount left for Ronnie} = 5 - 3 = 2 \text{ dollars}
     \]

5. **Final answer:**
   - The amount of money left with Ronnie is:
     \[
     \boxed{2} \text{ dollars}
     \]
