==================================================

To solve the problem step by step, we start with the total number of cupcakes Anna baked, which is 60.

1. **Calculate how many cupcakes Anna gives away:**
   Anna gives away \( \frac{4}{5} \) of her cupcakes. To find out how many cupcakes this is, we multiply the total number of cupcakes by \( \frac{4}{5} \):

   \[
   \text{Cupcakes given away} = 60 \times \frac{4}{5}
   \]

   First, we calculate \( 60 \times 4 = 240 \). Then, we divide by 5:

   \[
   \frac{240}{5} = 48
   \]

   So, Anna gives away 48 cupcakes.

2. **Calculate how many cupcakes remain after giving some away:**
   To find out how many cupcakes Anna has left after giving away 48, we subtract the number of cupcakes given away from the total:

   \[
   \text{Remaining cupcakes} = 60 - 48 = 12
   \]

   Anna has 12 cupcakes left after giving away 48.

3. **Calculate how many cupcakes Anna eats:**
   Of the remaining cupcakes, Anna eats 3 cupcakes. We need to subtract the number of cupcakes she eats from the remaining cupcakes:

   \[
   \text{Cupcakes left after eating} = 12 - 3 = 9
   \]

4. **Final answer:**
   After giving away 48 cupcakes and eating 3, the number of cupcakes Anna has left is:

   \[
   \text{Final answer} = 9
   \]

Thus, Anna has **9 cupcakes left**.
