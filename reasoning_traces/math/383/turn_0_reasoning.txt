Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine how many cupcakes Anna gives away:**

   Anna gives away \( \frac{4}{5} \) of the cupcakes to her classmates. She initially baked 60 cupcakes.

   To find out how many cupcakes she gives away, we calculate:
   \[
   \frac{4}{5} \times 60 = \frac{4 \times 60}{5} = \frac{240}{5} = 48
   \]

   So, Anna gives away 48 cupcakes.

2. **Calculate how many cupcakes are left after giving them away:**

   Anna initially had 60 cupcakes and gave away 48. To find out how many cupcakes are left, we subtract the number of cupcakes she gave away from the total number she baked:
   \[
   60 - 48 = 12
   \]

   Therefore, Anna has 12 cupcakes remaining after giving away 48.

3. **Determine how many cupcakes Anna eats:**

   From the remaining 12 cupcakes, Anna eats 3 cupcakes.

4. **Calculate how many cupcakes are left after Anna eats:**

   To find out how many cupcakes are left after Anna eats 3, we subtract the number of cupcakes she eats from the remaining cupcakes:
   \[
   12 - 3 = 9
   \]

   Therefore, Anna has 9 cupcakes left after eating 3.

Thus, the final answer is that Anna has \(\boxed{9}\) cupcakes left.
