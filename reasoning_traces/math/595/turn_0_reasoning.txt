To solve the problem, we need to determine Jerry's current age based on the information provided.

1. **Understanding the statement**: The problem states that Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago. Let's denote Jerry's current age as \( x \).

2. **Setting up the equation**: Five years ago, Jerry's age would have been \( x - 5 \). According to the problem, Jerry's current age \( x \) is twice his age from 5 years ago. This gives us the equation:
   \[
   x = 2(x - 5)
   \]

3. **Solving the equation**:
   - First, we'll expand the right side of the equation:
     \[
     x = 2x - 10
     \]
   - Next, we will isolate \( x \) by moving \( 2x \) to the left side:
     \[
     x - 2x = -10
     \]
     \[
     -x = -10
     \]
   - Now, we multiply both sides by -1 to solve for \( x \):
     \[
     x = 10
     \]

4. **Finding Jerry's age in 3 years**: Now that we know Jerry's current age is 10, we can find out how old he will be in 3 years:
   \[
   \text{Age in 3 years} = 10 + 3 = 13
   \]

5. **Final answer**: Therefore, Jerry will be 13 years old in 3 years.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{13}
\]
