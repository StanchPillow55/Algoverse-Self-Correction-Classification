To solve the problem, we need to calculate the total number of animals on the farm after three weeks, taking into account the initial number of animals and the daily additions from Milkie Cows Limited and Broilers Limited.

### Step 1: Initial Count of Animals
Melanie's father starts with:
- Cows: 50
- Chickens: 20

So, the initial total number of animals is:
\[
\text{Initial Total} = \text{Cows} + \text{Chickens} = 50 + 20 = 70
\]

### Step 2: Daily Additions
Next, we need to determine how many cows and chickens are added each day:
- Milkie Cows Limited brings 20 cows per day.
- Broilers Limited brings 10 chickens per day.

### Step 3: Calculate Total Additions Over Three Weeks
Three weeks is equivalent to:
\[
3 \text{ weeks} = 3 \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 21 \text{ days}
\]

Now, we calculate the total number of cows and chickens added over these 21 days.

**Cows Added:**
\[
\text{Total Cows Added} = 20 \text{ cows/day} \times 21 \text{ days} = 420 \text{ cows}
\]

**Chickens Added:**
\[
\text{Total Chickens Added} = 10 \text{ chickens/day} \times 21 \text{ days} = 210 \text{ chickens}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate Final Count of Animals
Now we can find the total number of cows and chickens on the farm after three weeks.

**Final Count of Cows:**
\[
\text{Final Cows} = \text{Initial Cows} + \text{Total Cows Added} = 50 + 420 = 470
\]

**Final Count of Chickens:**
\[
\text{Final Chickens} = \text{Initial Chickens} + \text{Total Chickens Added} = 20 + 210 = 230
\]

### Step 5: Calculate Total Number of Animals
Finally, we add the final counts of cows and chickens to get the total number of animals on the farm:
\[
\text{Total Animals} = \text{Final Cows} + \text{Final Chickens} = 470 + 230 = 700
\]

### Final Answer
The total number of animals on the farm after three weeks is:
\[
\boxed{700}
\]
