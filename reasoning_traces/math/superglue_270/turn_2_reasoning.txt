Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem effectively, I need more specific information about "Sample reasoning question 270." Since the problem statement is not provided, I'll demonstrate how to approach a typical math problem by outlining a general problem-solving strategy. If you can provide the specific details of the problem, I can tailor the solution to that.

### General Problem-Solving Strategy

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - Carefully read the problem statement.
   - Identify what is being asked.
   - Note down any given information and constraints.

2. **Devise a Plan:**
   - Determine the type of problem (e.g., algebra, geometry, calculus).
   - Choose an appropriate strategy (e.g., drawing a diagram, setting up equations, using formulas).

3. **Carry Out the Plan:**
   - Execute the chosen strategy step by step.
   - Perform calculations carefully.
   - Keep track of units and conversion factors if applicable.

4. **Review/Check the Solution:**
   - Verify each step of the calculation.
   - Check if the solution makes sense in the context of the problem.
   - Ensure the answer is in the correct format and units.

### Example Problem

Let's consider a simple algebra problem as an example:

**Problem:** Solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).

**Step 1: Understand the Problem**
- We need to find the value of \( x \) that satisfies the equation.

**Step 2: Devise a Plan**
- This is a linear equation. We can solve it by isolating \( x \).

**Step 3: Carry Out the Plan**
- Start with the equation: \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).
- Subtract 3 from both sides to isolate the term with \( x \):
  \[
  2x + 3 - 3 = 11 - 3
  \]
  \[
  2x = 8
  \]
- Divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( x \):
  \[
  x = \frac{8}{2}
  \]
  \[
  x = 4
  \]

**Step 4: Review/Check the Solution**
- Substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation to verify:
  \[
  2(4) + 3 = 11
  \]
  \[
  8 + 3 = 11
  \]
- The left side equals the right side, confirming our solution is correct.

**Final Answer:** \( x = 4 \)

If you provide the specific details of "Sample reasoning question 270," I can apply this structured approach to solve it.
