==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 270" refers to. Since this is not a standard math problem description, I'll assume it's a placeholder for a specific type of reasoning or math problem. Without additional context, I'll create a sample math problem and solve it step by step.

**Sample Problem:**

Let's assume the problem is as follows:

"A company produces two types of widgets: Type A and Type B. The profit from each Type A widget is $50, and the profit from each Type B widget is $70. The company can produce a maximum of 200 widgets in total per day due to resource constraints. Additionally, the company must produce at least 60 Type A widgets per day to meet a minimum order requirement. If the company wants to maximize its profit, how many of each type of widget should it produce per day?"

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( x \) be the number of Type A widgets produced per day.
   - Let \( y \) be the number of Type B widgets produced per day.

2. **Set Up the Constraints:**
   - The total number of widgets produced per day cannot exceed 200:
     \[
     x + y \leq 200
     \]
   - The company must produce at least 60 Type A widgets per day:
     \[
     x \geq 60
     \]
   - Both \( x \) and \( y \) must be non-negative:
     \[
     x \geq 0, \quad y \geq 0
     \]

3. **Objective Function:**
   - The profit function \( P \) to be maximized is:
     \[
     P = 50x + 70y
     \]

4. **Graph the Constraints:**
   - Plot the line \( x + y = 200 \).
   - Plot the vertical line \( x = 60 \).
   - The feasible region is bounded by these lines and the axes.

5. **Identify the Feasible Region:**
   - The feasible region is a polygon on the coordinate plane where all constraints overlap. It is bounded by the lines \( x = 60 \), \( x + y = 200 \), \( x = 0 \), and \( y = 0 \).

6. **Find the Vertices of the Feasible Region:**
   - The vertices of the feasible region are found by solving the system of equations formed by the intersection of the lines:
     - Intersection of \( x = 60 \) and \( x + y = 200 \):
       \[
       x = 60, \quad 60 + y = 200 \Rightarrow y = 140
       \]
       Vertex: \( (60, 140) \)
     - Intersection of \( x = 60 \) and \( y = 0 \):
       \[
       x = 60, \quad y = 0
       \]
       Vertex: \( (60, 0) \)
     - Intersection of \( x + y = 200 \) and \( y = 0 \):
       \[
       x + 0 = 200 \Rightarrow x = 200
       \]
       Vertex: \( (200, 0) \)

7. **Evaluate the Objective Function at Each Vertex:**
   - At \( (60, 140) \): 
     \[
     P = 50(60) + 70(140) = 3000 + 9800 = 12800
     \]
   - At \( (60, 0) \):
     \[
     P = 50(60) + 70(0) = 3000
     \]
   - At \( (200, 0) \):
     \[
     P = 50(200) + 70(0) = 10000
     \]

8. **Determine the Maximum Profit:**
   - The maximum profit occurs at the vertex \( (60, 140) \) with a profit of $12,800.

**Final Answer:**
To maximize profit, the company should produce 60 Type A widgets and 140 Type B widgets per day, resulting in a maximum profit of $12,800.
