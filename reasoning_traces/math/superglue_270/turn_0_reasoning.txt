It seems like the problem statement is incomplete or unclear. "Sample reasoning question 270" doesn't provide enough information for me to understand what the problem is asking. However, I can guide you on how to approach a typical math reasoning problem by explaining the steps you might take to solve it. 

Let's assume a hypothetical math problem and work through it step by step:

**Problem:**
A train travels from City A to City B, a distance of 300 miles, at a speed of 60 miles per hour. After reaching City B, it immediately returns to City A at a speed of 40 miles per hour. What is the average speed of the train for the entire trip?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - The train travels two legs: from City A to City B and back from City B to City A.
   - The distance for each leg is 300 miles.
   - The speed for the first leg is 60 mph, and for the return leg, it is 40 mph.

2. **Calculate the Time for Each Leg:**
   - Time is calculated using the formula: \(\text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}}\).
   - For the first leg (City A to City B):
     \[
     \text{Time}_1 = \frac{300 \text{ miles}}{60 \text{ mph}} = 5 \text{ hours}
     \]
   - For the return leg (City B to City A):
     \[
     \text{Time}_2 = \frac{300 \text{ miles}}{40 \text{ mph}} = 7.5 \text{ hours}
     \]

3. **Calculate the Total Time for the Entire Trip:**
   \[
   \text{Total Time} = \text{Time}_1 + \text{Time}_2 = 5 \text{ hours} + 7.5 \text{ hours} = 12.5 \text{ hours}
   \]

4. **Calculate the Total Distance for the Entire Trip:**
   - The train travels 300 miles each way, so:
   \[
   \text{Total Distance} = 300 \text{ miles} + 300 \text{ miles} = 600 \text{ miles}
   \]

5. **Calculate the Average Speed:**
   - Average speed is calculated using the formula: \(\text{Average Speed} = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Total Time}}\).
   \[
   \text{Average Speed} = \frac{600 \text{ miles}}{12.5 \text{ hours}} = 48 \text{ mph}
   \]

6. **State the Final Answer:**
   - The average speed of the train for the entire trip is 48 miles per hour.

This example demonstrates how to break down a problem, perform calculations, and arrive at a solution. If you have a specific problem or more details about "Sample reasoning question 270," please provide them, and I'll be happy to help further!
