==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to determine how many bottles of carrot juice are required to satisfy the daily energy needs of 2300 people, and then compare that to the current production capacity of the Hortex company.

1. **Understanding the Energy Coverage**:
   Each bottle of carrot juice covers 20% of one person's daily energy demand. This means that to cover 100% of one person's daily energy needs, we would need:
   \[
   \text{Number of bottles needed per person} = \frac{100\%}{20\%} = 5 \text{ bottles}
   \]

2. **Calculating Total Bottles Needed for 2300 People**:
   If each person requires 5 bottles to meet their daily energy needs, then for 2300 people, the total number of bottles required is:
   \[
   \text{Total bottles needed} = 2300 \text{ people} \times 5 \text{ bottles/person} = 11500 \text{ bottles}
   \]

3. **Current Production Capacity**:
   The Hortex company currently produces 4200 bottles of carrot juice each day.

4. **Calculating Additional Bottles Needed**:
   To find out how many more bottles Hortex needs to produce to meet the demand of 11500 bottles, we subtract the current production from the total required:
   \[
   \text{Additional bottles needed} = \text{Total bottles needed} - \text{Current production}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Additional bottles needed} = 11500 \text{ bottles} - 4200 \text{ bottles} = 7300 \text{ bottles}
   \]

5. **Final Answer**:
   Therefore, Hortex would need to produce an additional 7300 bottles of carrot juice to satisfy the daily energy needs of 2300 people.

\[
\text{Final answer: } 7300 \text{ bottles}
\]
