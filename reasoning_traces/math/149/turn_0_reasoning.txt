==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine Jayden's current age given the information about their ages in the future.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the variables:**
   - Let \( J \) represent Jayden's current age.
   - We know Ernesto's current age is 11 years.

2. **Understand the future scenario:**
   - In 3 years, Jayden's age will be \( J + 3 \).
   - In 3 years, Ernesto's age will be \( 11 + 3 = 14 \).

3. **Set up the relationship given in the problem:**
   - In 3 years, Jayden's age will be half of Ernesto's age. Therefore, we can write the equation:
     \[
     J + 3 = \frac{1}{2} \times 14
     \]

4. **Calculate the right side of the equation:**
   - \(\frac{1}{2} \times 14 = 7\).

5. **Substitute and solve for \( J \):**
   - The equation becomes:
     \[
     J + 3 = 7
     \]
   - To find \( J \), subtract 3 from both sides:
     \[
     J = 7 - 3
     \]
   - Simplifying gives:
     \[
     J = 4
     \]

6. **Conclusion:**
   - Jayden is currently 4 years old.

Therefore, the final answer is that Jayden is currently 4 years old.
