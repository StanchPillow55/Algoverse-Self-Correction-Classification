==================================================

To solve the problem, we will define the number of Facebook friends that Dorothy has and then use the information given to find out how many friends James has.

1. **Define Variables**:
   - Let \( D \) be the number of Facebook friends Dorothy has.
   - According to the problem, Charlie has three times as many friends as Dorothy, so we can express Charlie's friends as:
     \[
     C = 3D
     \]
   - James has four times as many friends as Dorothy, so we can express James's friends as:
     \[
     J = 4D
     \]

2. **Use Given Information**:
   - We know from the problem that Charlie has 12 friends on Facebook:
     \[
     C = 12
     \]
   - Now we can set up the equation using the relationship we defined earlier:
     \[
     3D = 12
     \]

3. **Solve for Dorothy's Friends**:
   - To find \( D \), we will divide both sides of the equation by 3:
     \[
     D = \frac{12}{3} = 4
     \]
   - So, Dorothy has 4 friends on Facebook.

4. **Calculate James's Friends**:
   - Now that we know \( D \), we can find out how many friends James has using the equation we defined for James:
     \[
     J = 4D
     \]
   - Substituting \( D = 4 \) into the equation:
     \[
     J = 4 \times 4 = 16
     \]

5. **Final Answer**:
   - Therefore, James has 16 friends on Facebook.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{16}
\]
