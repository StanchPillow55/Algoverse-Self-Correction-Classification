==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to determine Jayden's current age based on the information given about his future age in relation to Ernesto's age.

1. **Identify Ernesto's current age**: 
   - We know that Ernesto is currently 11 years old.

2. **Determine Ernesto's age in 3 years**:
   - In 3 years, Ernesto's age will be:
     \[
     11 + 3 = 14 \text{ years old}
     \]

3. **Set up the relationship between Jayden's age and Ernesto's age in 3 years**:
   - According to the problem, in 3 years, Jayden will be half of Ernesto's age. Therefore, we can express this relationship mathematically:
     \[
     \text{Jayden's age in 3 years} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Ernesto's age in 3 years}
     \]
   - Substituting Ernesto's age in 3 years:
     \[
     \text{Jayden's age in 3 years} = \frac{1}{2} \times 14 = 7 \text{ years old}
     \]

4. **Determine Jayden's current age**:
   - If Jayden will be 7 years old in 3 years, we can find his current age by subtracting 3 years from 7:
     \[
     \text{Jayden's current age} = 7 - 3 = 4 \text{ years old}
     \]

5. **Final answer**:
   - Therefore, Jayden is currently **4 years old**.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{4}
\]
