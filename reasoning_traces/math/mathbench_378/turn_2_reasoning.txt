==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 378," we need to first understand what the problem is asking. However, the problem statement "Sample math problem 378" is not clear or specific. It seems to be a placeholder or reference to a specific problem that is not provided here.

Since there is no specific mathematical problem or question given, I will demonstrate how to solve a generic math problem involving the number 378. Let's assume we want to find the prime factorization of 378.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   We need to find the prime factors of the number 378. Prime factorization involves breaking down a composite number into a product of its prime factors.

2. **Start with the Smallest Prime Number:**
   Begin dividing the number by the smallest prime number, which is 2, and continue with larger primes.

3. **Divide by 2:**
   - 378 is an even number, so it is divisible by 2.
   - \( 378 \div 2 = 189 \)
   - So, 2 is a prime factor, and we continue with 189.

4. **Check Divisibility by 3:**
   - The sum of the digits of 189 is \( 1 + 8 + 9 = 18 \), which is divisible by 3.
   - \( 189 \div 3 = 63 \)
   - So, 3 is a prime factor, and we continue with 63.

5. **Continue with 3:**
   - The sum of the digits of 63 is \( 6 + 3 = 9 \), which is divisible by 3.
   - \( 63 \div 3 = 21 \)
   - So, another 3 is a prime factor, and we continue with 21.

6. **Continue with 3:**
   - The sum of the digits of 21 is \( 2 + 1 = 3 \), which is divisible by 3.
   - \( 21 \div 3 = 7 \)
   - So, another 3 is a prime factor, and we continue with 7.

7. **Check Divisibility by 7:**
   - 7 is a prime number.
   - \( 7 \div 7 = 1 \)
   - So, 7 is a prime factor.

8. **Compile the Prime Factors:**
   - The prime factorization of 378 is \( 2 \times 3 \times 3 \times 3 \times 7 \).
   - This can also be written as \( 2 \times 3^3 \times 7 \).

### Final Answer:
The prime factorization of 378 is \( 2 \times 3^3 \times 7 \).

This concludes the solution to the assumed problem involving the number 378. If you have a specific problem or context in mind, please provide more details for a more targeted solution.
