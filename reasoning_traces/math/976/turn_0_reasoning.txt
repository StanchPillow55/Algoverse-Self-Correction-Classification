To solve the problem, we need to determine how many boxes of gingerbread and apple pie Sunny sold on both Saturday and Sunday, and then calculate his total earnings from those sales.

### Step 1: Define Variables
Let:
- \( G_s \) = number of boxes of gingerbread sold on Saturday
- \( A_s \) = number of boxes of apple pie sold on Saturday
- \( G_su \) = number of boxes of gingerbread sold on Sunday
- \( A_su \) = number of boxes of apple pie sold on Sunday

### Step 2: Set Up Equations Based on the Problem Statement
From the problem, we know:
1. On Saturday, Sunny sold 10 boxes of gingerbread:
   \[
   G_s = 10
   \]
2. On Saturday, he sold 4 fewer boxes of apple pie than on Sunday:
   \[
   A_s = A_su - 4
   \]
3. On Sunday, he sold 5 more boxes of gingerbread than on Saturday:
   \[
   G_su = G_s + 5 = 10 + 5 = 15
   \]
4. On Sunday, he sold 15 boxes of apple pie:
   \[
   A_su = 15
   \]

### Step 3: Calculate the Number of Boxes Sold on Saturday
Using the information from the equations:
- Substitute \( A_su \) into the equation for \( A_s \):
   \[
   A_s = 15 - 4 = 11
   \]

### Step 4: Summary of Sales
Now we have:
- Saturday:
  - Gingerbread: \( G_s = 10 \)
  - Apple Pie: \( A_s = 11 \)
  
- Sunday:
  - Gingerbread: \( G_su = 15 \)
  - Apple Pie: \( A_su = 15 \)

### Step 5: Calculate Earnings
Now we need to calculate the total earnings for both days.

**Cost of Gingerbread:**
- Price per box = $6
- Total boxes sold over two days:
  \[
  G_s + G_su = 10 + 15 = 25
  \]
- Total earnings from gingerbread:
  \[
  \text{Earnings from gingerbread} = 25 \times 6 = 150
  \]

**Cost of Apple Pie:**
- Price per box = $15
- Total boxes sold over two days:
  \[
  A_s + A_su = 11 + 15 = 26
  \]
- Total earnings from apple pie:
  \[
  \text{Earnings from apple pie} = 26 \times 15 = 390
  \]

### Step 6: Total Earnings
Now, we add the earnings from both gingerbread and apple pie:
\[
\text{Total Earnings} = \text{Earnings from gingerbread} + \text{Earnings from apple pie} = 150 + 390 = 540
\]

### Final Answer
Sunny earned a total of **$540** for the two days.
