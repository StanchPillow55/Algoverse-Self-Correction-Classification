==================================================

To solve the problem, I'll need more specific information about "Sample reasoning question 152." Since the question isn't provided, I'll demonstrate how to approach a generic math problem step by step. If you have a specific problem in mind, please provide the details, and I'll be happy to help.

Let's consider a sample math problem:

**Problem:**
Calculate the area of a triangle with a base of 10 units and a height of 5 units.

**Solution:**

1. **Understand the Formula:**
   The area \( A \) of a triangle can be calculated using the formula:
   \[
   A = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height}
   \]

2. **Identify the Given Values:**
   - Base (\( b \)) = 10 units
   - Height (\( h \)) = 5 units

3. **Substitute the Values into the Formula:**
   \[
   A = \frac{1}{2} \times 10 \times 5
   \]

4. **Perform the Multiplication:**
   First, multiply the base and the height:
   \[
   10 \times 5 = 50
   \]

5. **Calculate the Area:**
   Now, multiply the result by \(\frac{1}{2}\):
   \[
   A = \frac{1}{2} \times 50 = 25
   \]

6. **State the Final Answer:**
   The area of the triangle is 25 square units.

This step-by-step approach ensures that each part of the problem is addressed methodically, leading to a clear and accurate solution. If you have a specific problem or need further assistance, please provide more details.
