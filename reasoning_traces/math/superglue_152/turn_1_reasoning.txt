==================================================

To solve the problem effectively, I need to understand the context and details of "Sample reasoning question 152." However, since the problem itself is not provided, I will demonstrate a general approach to solving a typical math reasoning problem. Let's assume a hypothetical problem and solve it step by step.

### Hypothetical Problem:
A train travels from City A to City B, a distance of 300 miles. The train travels at a constant speed of 60 miles per hour. How long does it take for the train to reach City B from City A?

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We need to find the time it takes for the train to travel from City A to City B.
   - We know the distance between the two cities is 300 miles.
   - The train travels at a constant speed of 60 miles per hour.

2. **Identify the Formula:**
   - The formula to calculate time when distance and speed are known is:
     \[
     \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}}
     \]

3. **Substitute the Known Values:**
   - Distance = 300 miles
   - Speed = 60 miles per hour
   - Substitute these values into the formula:
     \[
     \text{Time} = \frac{300 \text{ miles}}{60 \text{ miles per hour}}
     \]

4. **Perform the Calculation:**
   - Divide 300 by 60:
     \[
     \text{Time} = \frac{300}{60} = 5 \text{ hours}
     \]

5. **Verify the Solution:**
   - To verify, multiply the time by the speed to check if it equals the distance:
     \[
     5 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ miles per hour} = 300 \text{ miles}
     \]
   - The calculation is correct.

6. **State the Final Answer:**
   - The train takes 5 hours to travel from City A to City B.

### Conclusion:
By following a structured approach, we determined that the train takes 5 hours to travel from City A to City B at a constant speed of 60 miles per hour. This methodical approach ensures accuracy and clarity in solving math reasoning problems.
