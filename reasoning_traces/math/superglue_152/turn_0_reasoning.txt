   - Carefully read the problem statement.
   - Identify what is being asked.
   - Determine what information is given and what needs to be found.

2. **Devise a Plan:**
   - Consider possible strategies to solve the problem, such as:
     - Drawing a diagram.
     - Creating an equation.
     - Breaking the problem into smaller parts.
     - Looking for patterns.

3. **Carry Out the Plan:**
   - Execute the chosen strategy step by step.
   - Perform calculations carefully.
   - Keep track of units and ensure consistency.

4. **Check Your Work:**
   - Review each step to ensure accuracy.
   - Verify that the solution makes sense in the context of the problem.
   - Check calculations for errors.

5. **State the Final Answer:**
   - Clearly write down the final answer.
   - Include units if applicable.

### Example Problem

Let's apply this approach to a sample math problem:

**Problem:**
A rectangle has a length that is twice its width. If the perimeter of the rectangle is 36 units, what are the dimensions of the rectangle?

**Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We need to find the dimensions (length and width) of the rectangle.
   - Given: Length = 2 Ã— Width, Perimeter = 36 units.

2. **Devise a Plan:**
   - Use the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle: \( P = 2 \times (\text{Length} + \text{Width}) \).

3. **Carry Out the Plan:**
   - Let \( W \) be the width of the rectangle.
   - Then the length \( L = 2W \).
   - Substitute into the perimeter formula:
     \[
     36 = 2 \times (2W + W)
     \]
     \[
     36 = 2 \times 3W
     \]
     \[
     36 = 6W
     \]
     \[
     W = \frac{36}{6} = 6
     \]
   - Therefore, the width \( W = 6 \) units.
   - The length \( L = 2 \times 6 = 12 \) units.

4. **Check Your Work:**
   - Calculate the perimeter with these dimensions:
     \[
     P = 2 \times (12 + 6) = 2 \times 18 = 36
     \]
   - The calculated perimeter matches the given perimeter, confirming the solution is correct.

5. **State the Final Answer:**
   - The dimensions of the rectangle are 12 units (length) and 6 units (width).
