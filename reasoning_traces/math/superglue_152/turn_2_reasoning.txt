==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 152" refers to. However, since no specific details or context about "Sample reasoning question 152" are provided, I'll demonstrate a general approach to solving a typical math problem by creating a sample problem and solving it step-by-step.

**Sample Problem:**

Let's say we have the following problem:

"A farmer has a rectangular field with a length that is 20 meters longer than its width. The area of the field is 1120 square meters. What are the dimensions of the field?"

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Define the Variables:**
   - Let \( w \) be the width of the field in meters.
   - Then the length of the field will be \( w + 20 \) meters.

2. **Write the Equation for the Area:**
   - The area \( A \) of a rectangle is given by the formula:
     \[
     A = \text{length} \times \text{width}
     \]
   - Substituting the given values, we have:
     \[
     1120 = (w + 20) \times w
     \]

3. **Expand and Rearrange the Equation:**
   - Expand the right side:
     \[
     1120 = w^2 + 20w
     \]
   - Rearrange the equation to form a standard quadratic equation:
     \[
     w^2 + 20w - 1120 = 0
     \]

4. **Solve the Quadratic Equation:**
   - We can solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula:
     \[
     w = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
     \]
   - Here, \( a = 1 \), \( b = 20 \), and \( c = -1120 \).
   - Calculate the discriminant:
     \[
     b^2 - 4ac = 20^2 - 4 \times 1 \times (-1120) = 400 + 4480 = 4880
     \]
   - Find the square root of the discriminant:
     \[
     \sqrt{4880} \approx 69.83
     \]
   - Substitute back into the quadratic formula:
     \[
     w = \frac{-20 \pm 69.83}{2}
     \]
   - Calculate the two possible solutions:
     \[
     w_1 = \frac{-20 + 69.83}{2} \approx 24.915
     \]
     \[
     w_2 = \frac{-20 - 69.83}{2} \approx -44.915
     \]
   - Since a width cannot be negative, we discard \( w_2 \).

5. **Find the Length:**
   - Using \( w_1 \approx 24.915 \), calculate the length:
     \[
     \text{Length} = w + 20 \approx 24.915 + 20 = 44.915
     \]

6. **Verify the Solution:**
   - Check the area with the calculated dimensions:
     \[
     \text{Area} = 24.915 \times 44.915 \approx 1120 \, \text{square meters}
     \]
   - The calculations are consistent with the given area.

**Final Answer:**
The dimensions of the field are approximately 24.915 meters in width and 44.915 meters in length.
