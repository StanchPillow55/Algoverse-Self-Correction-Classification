To determine how much money the tomato vendor saves in a week by switching suppliers, we will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the daily cost of tomatoes with the old vendor**:
   - The vendor sells 500 tomatoes a day.
   - The cost per tomato with the old vendor is $0.50.
   - Therefore, the daily cost with the old vendor is calculated as follows:
     \[
     \text{Daily Cost (Old Vendor)} = \text{Number of Tomatoes} \times \text{Cost per Tomato}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Daily Cost (Old Vendor)} = 500 \times 0.50 = 250 \text{ dollars}
     \]

2. **Calculate the daily cost of tomatoes with the new vendor**:
   - The cost per tomato with the new vendor is $0.40.
   - Therefore, the daily cost with the new vendor is calculated as follows:
     \[
     \text{Daily Cost (New Vendor)} = \text{Number of Tomatoes} \times \text{Cost per Tomato}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Daily Cost (New Vendor)} = 500 \times 0.40 = 200 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Calculate the daily savings by switching vendors**:
   - The savings per day can be calculated by subtracting the daily cost with the new vendor from the daily cost with the old vendor:
     \[
     \text{Daily Savings} = \text{Daily Cost (Old Vendor)} - \text{Daily Cost (New Vendor)}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Daily Savings} = 250 - 200 = 50 \text{ dollars}
     \]

4. **Calculate the weekly savings**:
   - Since there are 7 days in a week, the total savings for the week can be calculated by multiplying the daily savings by 7:
     \[
     \text{Weekly Savings} = \text{Daily Savings} \times 7
     \]
     \[
     \text{Weekly Savings} = 50 \times 7 = 350 \text{ dollars}
     \]

Thus, the total amount of money the tomato vendor saves in a week by switching to the new vendor is **$350**.

Final answer: **$350**.
