==================================================

To determine how much money the tomato vendor saves in a week by switching suppliers, we need to calculate the total cost of tomatoes from both vendors and then find the difference.

**Step 1: Calculate the daily cost with the old vendor.**

The old vendor sells tomatoes for $0.50 each. The vendor sells 500 tomatoes a day.

\[
\text{Daily cost with old vendor} = \text{Number of tomatoes} \times \text{Cost per tomato}
\]
\[
\text{Daily cost with old vendor} = 500 \times 0.50 = 250 \text{ dollars}
\]

**Step 2: Calculate the daily cost with the new vendor.**

The new vendor sells tomatoes for $0.40 each.

\[
\text{Daily cost with new vendor} = \text{Number of tomatoes} \times \text{Cost per tomato}
\]
\[
\text{Daily cost with new vendor} = 500 \times 0.40 = 200 \text{ dollars}
\]

**Step 3: Calculate the daily savings.**

Now, we find the difference in daily costs between the old and new vendors.

\[
\text{Daily savings} = \text{Daily cost with old vendor} - \text{Daily cost with new vendor}
\]
\[
\text{Daily savings} = 250 - 200 = 50 \text{ dollars}
\]

**Step 4: Calculate the weekly savings.**

Since the vendor operates every day, we multiply the daily savings by the number of days in a week (7 days).

\[
\text{Weekly savings} = \text{Daily savings} \times 7
\]
\[
\text{Weekly savings} = 50 \times 7 = 350 \text{ dollars}
\]

**Final Answer:**

The tomato vendor saves **$350** a week by switching to the new supplier.
