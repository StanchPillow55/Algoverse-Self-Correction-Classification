==================================================

To determine how much money the tomato vendor saves in a week by switching suppliers, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the daily cost of tomatoes with the old vendor.**
   - The vendor sells 500 tomatoes a day.
   - The cost per tomato from the old vendor is $0.50.
   - Daily cost with the old vendor = Number of tomatoes × Cost per tomato
   \[
   \text{Daily cost (old vendor)} = 500 \, \text{tomatoes} \times 0.50 \, \text{dollars/tomato} = 250 \, \text{dollars}
   \]

2. **Calculate the daily cost of tomatoes with the new vendor.**
   - The cost per tomato from the new vendor is $0.40.
   - Daily cost with the new vendor = Number of tomatoes × Cost per tomato
   \[
   \text{Daily cost (new vendor)} = 500 \, \text{tomatoes} \times 0.40 \, \text{dollars/tomato} = 200 \, \text{dollars}
   \]

3. **Calculate the daily savings by switching vendors.**
   - Daily savings = Daily cost (old vendor) - Daily cost (new vendor)
   \[
   \text{Daily savings} = 250 \, \text{dollars} - 200 \, \text{dollars} = 50 \, \text{dollars}
   \]

4. **Calculate the weekly savings.**
   - There are 7 days in a week, so we multiply the daily savings by 7.
   \[
   \text{Weekly savings} = \text{Daily savings} \times 7
   \]
   \[
   \text{Weekly savings} = 50 \, \text{dollars/day} \times 7 \, \text{days} = 350 \, \text{dollars}
   \]

Thus, the total amount of money the tomato vendor saves in a week by switching to the new vendor is **$350**.

Final answer: **$350**.
