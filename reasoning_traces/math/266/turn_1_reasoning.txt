==================================================

To determine how many hours John spends at the gym each week, we need to consider both his weightlifting time and his warm-up/cardio time.

1. **Weightlifting Time:**
   - John goes to the gym 3 times a week.
   - He spends 1 hour lifting weights each day he goes to the gym.
   - Therefore, the total time spent lifting weights per week is:
     \[
     3 \, \text{days/week} \times 1 \, \text{hour/day} = 3 \, \text{hours/week}
     \]

2. **Warm-up and Cardio Time:**
   - John spends a third of his weightlifting time on warm-up and cardio each day.
   - Since he lifts weights for 1 hour each day, the time spent on warm-up and cardio per day is:
     \[
     \frac{1}{3} \times 1 \, \text{hour} = \frac{1}{3} \, \text{hour/day}
     \]
   - Therefore, the total time spent on warm-up and cardio per week is:
     \[
     3 \, \text{days/week} \times \frac{1}{3} \, \text{hour/day} = 1 \, \text{hour/week}
     \]

3. **Total Time at the Gym:**
   - To find the total time John spends at the gym each week, we add the time spent on weightlifting and the time spent on warm-up and cardio:
     \[
     3 \, \text{hours/week (weightlifting)} + 1 \, \text{hour/week (warm-up and cardio)} = 4 \, \text{hours/week}
     \]

Therefore, John spends a total of 4 hours at the gym each week.

**Final Answer: 4 hours per week**
