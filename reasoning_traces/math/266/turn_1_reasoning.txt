==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine the total amount of time John spends at the gym each week, including both his weightlifting and his warm-up/cardio activities.

1. **Weightlifting Time:**
   - John goes to the gym 3 times a week.
   - Each day, he spends 1 hour lifting weights.
   - Therefore, in one week, the total time spent lifting weights is:
     \[
     3 \text{ days/week} \times 1 \text{ hour/day} = 3 \text{ hours/week}
     \]

2. **Warm-up and Cardio Time:**
   - John spends a third of his weightlifting time on warming up and doing cardio each day.
   - Since he spends 1 hour lifting weights each day, the time spent on warm-up and cardio each day is:
     \[
     \frac{1}{3} \times 1 \text{ hour} = \frac{1}{3} \text{ hour/day}
     \]
   - Over the course of 3 days, the total time spent on warm-up and cardio is:
     \[
     3 \text{ days/week} \times \frac{1}{3} \text{ hour/day} = 1 \text{ hour/week}
     \]

3. **Total Time at the Gym:**
   - To find the total time John spends at the gym each week, we add the time spent on weightlifting and the time spent on warm-up and cardio:
     \[
     3 \text{ hours/week (weightlifting)} + 1 \text{ hour/week (warm-up and cardio)} = 4 \text{ hours/week}
     \]

Therefore, John spends a total of 4 hours at the gym each week.

**Final Answer:** John spends 4 hours at the gym each week.
