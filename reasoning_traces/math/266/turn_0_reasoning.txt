To determine how many hours Johns spends at the gym each week, we will break down the problem step by step.

1. **Identify the number of days Johns goes to the gym**: 
   - Johns goes to the gym **3 times a week**.

2. **Determine the time spent weightlifting each day**: 
   - He spends **1 hour** each day lifting weights.

3. **Calculate the total time spent weightlifting in a week**:
   - Since he goes to the gym 3 times a week and spends 1 hour each day lifting weights, the total time spent weightlifting in a week is:
     \[
     \text{Total weightlifting time} = \text{Number of days} \times \text{Weightlifting time per day} = 3 \, \text{days} \times 1 \, \text{hour/day} = 3 \, \text{hours}
     \]

4. **Determine the time spent warming up and doing cardio each day**:
   - He spends a third of his weightlifting time warming up and doing cardio each day. Since he spends 1 hour lifting weights, the time spent warming up and doing cardio each day is:
     \[
     \text{Warm-up and cardio time per day} = \frac{1}{3} \times \text{Weightlifting time per day} = \frac{1}{3} \times 1 \, \text{hour} = \frac{1}{3} \, \text{hour}
     \]

5. **Calculate the total time spent warming up and doing cardio in a week**:
   - Since he does this 3 times a week, the total time spent warming up and doing cardio in a week is:
     \[
     \text{Total warm-up and cardio time} = \text{Number of days} \times \text{Warm-up and cardio time per day} = 3 \, \text{days} \times \frac{1}{3} \, \text{hour/day} = 3 \times \frac{1}{3} = 1 \, \text{hour}
     \]

6. **Calculate the total time spent at the gym each week**:
   - The total time spent at the gym each week is the sum of the total weightlifting time and the total warm-up and cardio time:
     \[
     \text{Total gym time} = \text{Total weightlifting time} + \text{Total warm-up and cardio time} = 3 \, \text{hours} + 1 \, \text{hour} = 4 \, \text{hours}
     \]

Thus, the total time Johns spends at the gym each week is:

\[
\boxed{4} \text{ hours}
\]
