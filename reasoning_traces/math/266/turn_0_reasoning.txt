To solve this problem, we need to determine the total amount of time John spends at the gym each week, including both his weightlifting and his warm-up/cardio activities.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Determine the time spent on weightlifting per day:**
   - John spends 1 hour each day lifting weights.

2. **Calculate the time spent on warming up and doing cardio per day:**
   - John spends a third of his weightlifting time on warming up and doing cardio.
   - Since he spends 1 hour lifting weights, the time spent on warming up and cardio is:
     \[
     \text{Time for warm-up and cardio} = \frac{1}{3} \times 1 \text{ hour} = \frac{1}{3} \text{ hour}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total time spent at the gym per day:**
   - Total time per day = Time spent on weightlifting + Time spent on warm-up and cardio
   - Total time per day = 1 hour (weightlifting) + \(\frac{1}{3}\) hour (warm-up and cardio)
   - Total time per day = \(\frac{3}{3}\) hour + \(\frac{1}{3}\) hour = \(\frac{4}{3}\) hours

4. **Calculate the total time spent at the gym per week:**
   - John goes to the gym 3 times a week.
   - Total time per week = Total time per day \(\times\) Number of days per week
   - Total time per week = \(\frac{4}{3}\) hours/day \(\times\) 3 days/week
   - Total time per week = \(\frac{4 \times 3}{3}\) hours
   - Total time per week = 4 hours

### Final Answer:
John spends a total of 4 hours at the gym each week.
