To solve the problem, we first need to understand what "Sample math problem 215" refers to. Since the problem statement is not provided, I'll create a hypothetical math problem labeled as "Sample math problem 215" and solve it step by step.

**Sample Math Problem 215:**

*Problem Statement:*

A rectangle has a length that is 3 times its width. If the perimeter of the rectangle is 48 units, find the dimensions of the rectangle.

**Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**

   We are given that the length of the rectangle is 3 times its width. We are also given the perimeter of the rectangle, which is 48 units. We need to find the dimensions of the rectangle, i.e., its length and width.

2. **Define Variables:**

   Let \( w \) be the width of the rectangle.  
   Then the length \( l \) can be expressed in terms of the width as \( l = 3w \).

3. **Use the Perimeter Formula:**

   The formula for the perimeter \( P \) of a rectangle is given by:
   \[
   P = 2l + 2w
   \]
   We know the perimeter is 48 units, so we can set up the equation:
   \[
   2l + 2w = 48
   \]

4. **Substitute the Expression for Length:**

   Substitute \( l = 3w \) into the perimeter equation:
   \[
   2(3w) + 2w = 48
   \]

5. **Simplify and Solve for \( w \):**

   Simplify the equation:
   \[
   6w + 2w = 48
   \]
   Combine like terms:
   \[
   8w = 48
   \]
   Divide both sides by 8 to solve for \( w \):
   \[
   w = \frac{48}{8} = 6
   \]

6. **Find the Length:**

   Now that we have \( w = 6 \), use the expression for length:
   \[
   l = 3w = 3 \times 6 = 18
   \]

7. **Verify the Solution:**

   Check that these dimensions satisfy the original perimeter condition:
   \[
   2l + 2w = 2(18) + 2(6) = 36 + 12 = 48
   \]
   The calculated perimeter matches the given perimeter, confirming our solution is correct.

**Final Answer:**

The dimensions of the rectangle are:
- Width: 6 units
- Length: 18 units
