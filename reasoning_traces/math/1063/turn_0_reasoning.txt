To solve the problem, we need to determine how many emails James responds to in a 5-day work week, given that he receives 80 emails a day and that 20% of those emails do not require a response.

### Step 1: Calculate the number of emails that do not require a response.

First, we find out how many emails do not require a response by calculating 20% of the total emails he receives each day.

\[
\text{Number of emails that do not require a response} = 20\% \text{ of } 80
\]

To calculate 20% of 80, we can convert the percentage to a decimal:

\[
20\% = \frac{20}{100} = 0.20
\]

Now, we multiply:

\[
0.20 \times 80 = 16
\]

So, James receives 16 emails each day that do not require a response.

### Step 2: Calculate the number of emails that require a response.

Next, we find out how many emails require a response by subtracting the number of emails that do not require a response from the total number of emails.

\[
\text{Number of emails that require a response} = \text{Total emails} - \text{Emails that do not require a response}
\]

\[
\text{Number of emails that require a response} = 80 - 16 = 64
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the total number of emails responded to in a 5-day work week.

Now that we know James responds to 64 emails each day, we can find out how many emails he responds to over a 5-day work week.

\[
\text{Total emails responded to in 5 days} = \text{Emails responded to per day} \times \text{Number of days}
\]

\[
\text{Total emails responded to in 5 days} = 64 \times 5
\]

Calculating this gives:

\[
64 \times 5 = 320
\]

### Final Answer

James responds to a total of **320 emails** in a 5-day work week.
