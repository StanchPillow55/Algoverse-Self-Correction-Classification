Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To determine how many reports Vince stapled from 8:00 AM until 11:00 PM, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total time Vince worked**: 
   - From 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM is a total of 15 hours.
   - To convert hours into minutes, we multiply by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):
     \[
     15 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 900 \text{ minutes}
     \]

2. **Determine how many reports Vince can staple in one minute**:
   - Vince staples 30 reports every 15 minutes. To find out how many reports he staples in one minute, we divide the number of reports by the number of minutes:
     \[
     \frac{30 \text{ reports}}{15 \text{ minutes}} = 2 \text{ reports/minute}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total number of reports stapled in 900 minutes**:
   - Now that we know Vince staples 2 reports per minute, we can find out how many reports he staples in 900 minutes:
     \[
     2 \text{ reports/minute} \times 900 \text{ minutes} = 1800 \text{ reports}
     \]

4. **Final answer**:
   - Therefore, the total number of reports that Vince stapled from 8:00 AM until 11:00 PM is:
     \[
     \boxed{1800}
     \]
