==================================================

To determine how many reports Vince stapled from 8:00 AM until 11:00 PM, we will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total time Vince worked**: 
   - From 8:00 AM to 11:00 PM is a total of 15 hours.
   - To convert hours into minutes, we multiply by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):
     \[
     15 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 900 \text{ minutes}
     \]

2. **Determine how many 15-minute intervals are in 900 minutes**:
   - We divide the total minutes by the length of each interval (15 minutes):
     \[
     \frac{900 \text{ minutes}}{15 \text{ minutes/interval}} = 60 \text{ intervals}
     \]

3. **Calculate the number of reports stapled in each interval**:
   - Vince can staple 30 reports every 15 minutes. Therefore, in each interval, he staples 30 reports.

4. **Calculate the total number of reports stapled**:
   - To find the total number of reports stapled, we multiply the number of reports per interval by the total number of intervals:
     \[
     30 \text{ reports/interval} \times 60 \text{ intervals} = 1800 \text{ reports}
     \]

Thus, the total number of reports that Vince stapled from 8:00 AM until 11:00 PM is:

\[
\boxed{1800}
\]
