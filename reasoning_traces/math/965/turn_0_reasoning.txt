To find the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes, we will calculate the total distance traveled south and the total distance traveled north, and then find the difference between these two distances.

### Step 1: Calculate the distance traveled south

1. **First leg of the journey (south)**:
   - Time = 10 hours
   - Speed = 30 miles per hour
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 30 miles/hour × 10 hours = 300 miles

2. **Second leg of the journey (north)**:
   - Time = 2 hours
   - Speed = 18 miles per hour
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 18 miles/hour × 2 hours = 36 miles

3. **Third leg of the journey (south)**:
   - Time = 5 hours
   - Speed = 22 miles per hour
   - Distance = Speed × Time = 22 miles/hour × 5 hours = 110 miles

### Step 2: Calculate total distance traveled south and north

- **Total distance traveled south**:
  - First leg: 300 miles
  - Third leg: 110 miles
  - Total south distance = 300 miles + 110 miles = 410 miles

- **Total distance traveled north**:
  - Second leg: 36 miles

### Step 3: Calculate the net distance between the northern and southern homes

To find the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes, we subtract the total distance traveled north from the total distance traveled south:

\[
\text{Net distance} = \text{Total south distance} - \text{Total north distance}
\]

\[
\text{Net distance} = 410 \text{ miles} - 36 \text{ miles} = 374 \text{ miles}
\]

### Final Answer

The distance between the bird's northern and southern homes is **374 miles**.
