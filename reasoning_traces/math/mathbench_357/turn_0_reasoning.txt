==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample math problem 357" refers to. Since the problem statement is not explicitly given, I'll assume that "357" is the number we need to work with in some mathematical context. Let's explore a few possible interpretations and solve them:

### Interpretation 1: Basic Arithmetic Operations

1. **Sum of Digits**: Calculate the sum of the digits of 357.
   - The digits of 357 are 3, 5, and 7.
   - Sum = 3 + 5 + 7 = 15

2. **Product of Digits**: Calculate the product of the digits of 357.
   - Product = 3 × 5 × 7 = 105

3. **Reverse the Number**: Reverse the digits of 357.
   - Reversed number = 753

### Interpretation 2: Prime Factorization

Find the prime factorization of 357.

1. Check divisibility by the smallest prime, 2. Since 357 is odd, it's not divisible by 2.
2. Check divisibility by 3. The sum of the digits (3 + 5 + 7 = 15) is divisible by 3, so 357 is divisible by 3.
   - Divide 357 by 3: \( 357 \div 3 = 119 \)
3. Now, factor 119. Check divisibility by 3, 5, and 7.
   - 119 is not divisible by 3 or 5.
   - Check divisibility by 7: \( 119 \div 7 = 17 \)
4. 17 is a prime number.

Thus, the prime factorization of 357 is \( 3 \times 7 \times 17 \).

### Interpretation 3: Mathematical Properties

1. **Check if 357 is a Perfect Square**: A perfect square is an integer that is the square of an integer.
   - Calculate the square root of 357: \( \sqrt{357} \approx 18.89 \)
   - Since 18.89 is not an integer, 357 is not a perfect square.

2. **Check if 357 is a Perfect Cube**: A perfect cube is an integer that is the cube of an integer.
   - Calculate the cube root of 357: \( \sqrt[3]{357} \approx 7.11 \)
   - Since 7.11 is not an integer, 357 is not a perfect cube.

### Final Answer

Since the problem "Sample math problem 357" is not specific, I've explored several interpretations:

1. **Sum of Digits**: 15
2. **Product of Digits**: 105
3. **Reversed Number**: 753
4. **Prime Factorization**: \( 3 \times 7 \times 17 \)
5. **Not a Perfect Square or Cube**
