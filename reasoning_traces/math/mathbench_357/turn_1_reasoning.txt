==================================================

To solve the problem, we first need to understand what "Sample math problem 357" refers to. Since the problem itself isn't specified, I'll assume it's a generic math problem involving the number 357. Let's create a problem involving this number and solve it step by step.

**Problem:**  
Find the sum of the digits of the number 357, and then determine if this sum is a prime number.

**Step 1: Find the sum of the digits of 357.**

The number 357 consists of three digits: 3, 5, and 7. To find the sum of these digits, we simply add them together:

\[ 
3 + 5 + 7 = 15 
\]

**Step 2: Determine if the sum (15) is a prime number.**

A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. To determine if 15 is a prime number, we need to check if it has any divisors other than 1 and 15.

- 15 is divisible by 1 and 15 (by definition of any number).
- 15 is also divisible by 3 (since \(15 \div 3 = 5\)) and by 5 (since \(15 \div 5 = 3\)).

Since 15 has divisors other than 1 and itself (specifically, 3 and 5), it is not a prime number.

**Conclusion:**

The sum of the digits of 357 is 15, and 15 is not a prime number.

**Final Answer:**

The sum of the digits of 357 is 15, and 15 is not a prime number.
