==================================================

To solve the problem labeled "Sample math problem 357," we need to first understand what the problem is asking. However, since "Sample math problem 357" is not a specific problem statement, I'll create a hypothetical math problem and solve it step by step. Let's assume the problem is as follows:

**Problem Statement:**
Calculate the sum of all even numbers between 1 and 357.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Identify the Range of Even Numbers:**
   - The even numbers between 1 and 357 start from 2 and go up to 356. These numbers form an arithmetic sequence where the first term \( a_1 = 2 \) and the last term \( a_n = 356 \).

2. **Determine the Number of Terms:**
   - The common difference \( d \) in this sequence is 2 (since even numbers increase by 2).
   - The formula for the \( n \)-th term of an arithmetic sequence is given by:
     \[
     a_n = a_1 + (n-1) \cdot d
     \]
   - Plugging in the known values to find \( n \):
     \[
     356 = 2 + (n-1) \cdot 2
     \]
     \[
     356 = 2 + 2n - 2
     \]
     \[
     356 = 2n
     \]
     \[
     n = \frac{356}{2} = 178
     \]
   - There are 178 even numbers between 1 and 357.

3. **Calculate the Sum of the Sequence:**
   - The sum \( S_n \) of an arithmetic sequence can be calculated using the formula:
     \[
     S_n = \frac{n}{2} \cdot (a_1 + a_n)
     \]
   - Substituting the known values:
     \[
     S_{178} = \frac{178}{2} \cdot (2 + 356)
     \]
     \[
     S_{178} = 89 \cdot 358
     \]

4. **Perform the Multiplication:**
   - Calculate \( 89 \times 358 \):
     \[
     89 \times 358 = 89 \times (300 + 50 + 8)
     \]
     \[
     = 89 \times 300 + 89 \times 50 + 89 \times 8
     \]
     \[
     = 26700 + 4450 + 712
     \]
     \[
     = 31862
     \]

5. **Final Answer:**
   - The sum of all even numbers between 1 and 357 is \( \boxed{31862} \).

This solution involves identifying the sequence of even numbers, calculating the number of terms, and using the arithmetic series sum formula to find the total sum.
