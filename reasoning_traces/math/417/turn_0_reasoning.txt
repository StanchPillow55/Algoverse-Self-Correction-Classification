To find the total distance Tom traveled during his two-week-long trip, we can break down the problem into parts based on the information provided.

### Step 1: Calculate the distance traveled in the first 4 days
Tom traveled 200 kilometers every day for the first 4 days. 

\[
\text{Distance in first 4 days} = 200 \text{ km/day} \times 4 \text{ days} = 800 \text{ km}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the distance traveled in the next 2 days
In the next 2 days, Tom traveled only 30% of the distance he traveled in the first 4 days. 

First, we need to find 30% of the distance traveled in the first 4 days:

\[
30\% \text{ of } 800 \text{ km} = 0.30 \times 800 \text{ km} = 240 \text{ km}
\]

Since this distance is covered over 2 days, we can assume he traveled this total distance over those 2 days. 

### Step 3: Calculate the distance traveled on the next day (day 7)
On the next day (day 7), Tom wasn't traveling at all, so the distance for that day is:

\[
\text{Distance on day 7} = 0 \text{ km}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the distance traveled during the second week
During the second week (days 8 to 14), Tom traveled 300 kilometers every day. There are 7 days in the second week.

\[
\text{Distance in second week} = 300 \text{ km/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 2100 \text{ km}
\]

### Step 5: Calculate the total distance traveled
Now we can sum up all the distances traveled:

1. Distance in the first 4 days: 800 km
2. Distance in the next 2 days: 240 km
3. Distance on day 7: 0 km
4. Distance in the second week: 2100 km

\[
\text{Total distance} = 800 \text{ km} + 240 \text{ km} + 0 \text{ km} + 2100 \text{ km}
\]

Calculating this gives:

\[
\text{Total distance} = 800 + 240 + 0 + 2100 = 3140 \text{ km}
\]

### Final Answer
Thus, the total distance Tom traveled during his two-week-long trip is:

\[
\boxed{3140 \text{ km}}
\]
