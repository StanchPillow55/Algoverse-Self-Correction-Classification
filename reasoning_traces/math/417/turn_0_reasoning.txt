To solve this problem, we need to determine how much Jim pays for a package of 20 car washes, given that he only pays 60% of the normal price for each car wash.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Determine the normal cost of one car wash:**
   - The problem states that a car wash normally costs $15.

2. **Calculate the total normal cost for 20 car washes:**
   - Since one car wash costs $15, the cost for 20 car washes at the normal price would be:
     \[
     20 \times 15 = 300
     \]
   - So, the total normal cost for 20 car washes is $300.

3. **Calculate the discounted cost for the package:**
   - Jim only pays 60% of the normal price for the package. To find 60% of the total normal cost, we multiply the total normal cost by 0.60:
     \[
     300 \times 0.60 = 180
     \]
   - Therefore, Jim pays $180 for the package of 20 car washes.

4. **Verify the calculation:**
   - To ensure accuracy, let's check the calculation:
     - 60% of $300 is calculated as:
       \[
       300 \times \frac{60}{100} = 300 \times 0.60 = 180
       \]
   - The calculation confirms that Jim pays $180.

Thus, the final answer is that Jim paid $180 for the package of 20 car washes.
