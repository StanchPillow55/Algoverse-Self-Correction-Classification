==================================================

To determine how much Jim paid for the package of 20 car washes, we will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the normal cost of one car wash.**
   The normal cost of one car wash is given as $15.

2. **Calculate the total normal cost for 20 car washes.**
   To find the total cost without any discounts, we multiply the cost of one car wash by the number of car washes:
   \[
   \text{Total normal cost} = \text{Cost per car wash} \times \text{Number of car washes}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total normal cost} = 15 \, \text{dollars} \times 20 = 300 \, \text{dollars}
   \]

3. **Calculate the discount percentage.**
   Jim only has to pay 60% of the total cost. This means he receives a discount of 40% (since 100% - 60% = 40%).

4. **Calculate the amount Jim actually pays.**
   To find out how much Jim pays, we take 60% of the total normal cost:
   \[
   \text{Amount paid} = \text{Total normal cost} \times 0.60
   \]
   \[
   \text{Amount paid} = 300 \, \text{dollars} \times 0.60 = 180 \, \text{dollars}
   \]

5. **State the final answer.**
   Therefore, Jim paid **$180** for the package of 20 car washes.

Final answer: **$180**
