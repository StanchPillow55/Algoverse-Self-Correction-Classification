Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To determine how much Jim paid for the package of 20 car washes, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the normal cost of one car wash**:  
   The normal cost of one car wash is given as $15.

2. **Calculate the total normal cost for 20 car washes**:  
   To find the total cost without any discounts, we multiply the cost of one car wash by the number of car washes:
   \[
   \text{Total normal cost} = \text{Cost per car wash} \times \text{Number of car washes} = 15 \, \text{dollars} \times 20 = 300 \, \text{dollars}
   \]

3. **Determine the discount percentage**:  
   Jim receives a discount of 60% on the total cost because he bought a package.

4. **Calculate the amount of the discount**:  
   To find the discount amount, we multiply the total normal cost by the discount percentage:
   \[
   \text{Discount amount} = \text{Total normal cost} \times \text{Discount percentage} = 300 \, \text{dollars} \times 0.60 = 180 \, \text{dollars}
   \]

5. **Calculate the final price Jim pays for the package**:  
   To find out how much Jim actually pays after applying the discount, we subtract the discount amount from the total normal cost:
   \[
   \text{Final price} = \text{Total normal cost} - \text{Discount amount} = 300 \, \text{dollars} - 180 \, \text{dollars} = 120 \, \text{dollars}
   \]

Thus, the total amount Jim paid for the package of 20 car washes is **$120**.

Final Answer: **$120**
