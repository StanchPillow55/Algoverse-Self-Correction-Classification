Question ID: 417
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To find out how much Jim paid for the package of 20 car washes, we can follow these steps:

1. **Determine the normal cost of one car wash**:  
   The normal cost of one car wash is given as $15.

2. **Calculate the total normal cost for 20 car washes**:  
   \[
   \text{Total normal cost} = \text{Cost per car wash} \times \text{Number of car washes}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total normal cost} = 15 \, \text{dollars} \times 20 = 300 \, \text{dollars}
   \]

3. **Calculate the discounted price Jim pays for the package**:  
   Since Jim only has to pay 60% of the total normal cost, we can calculate the amount he pays as follows:
   \[
   \text{Discounted price} = \text{Total normal cost} \times 0.60
   \]
   \[
   \text{Discounted price} = 300 \, \text{dollars} \times 0.60 = 180 \, \text{dollars}
   \]

4. **Final answer**:  
   Therefore, Jim paid **$180** for the package of 20 car washes.

In conclusion, Jim paid **$180** for the package.
