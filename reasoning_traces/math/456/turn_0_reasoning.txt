==================================================

To determine how much Chad will save, we need to first calculate his total earnings for the year and then find 40% of that total.

**Step 1: Calculate Total Earnings**

Chad's earnings come from four sources:
1. Mowing yards: $600
2. Birthday/holiday gifts: $250
3. Selling old video games: $150
4. Doing odd jobs: $150

To find the total amount Chad earned, we add up all these amounts:

\[
\text{Total Earnings} = 600 + 250 + 150 + 150
\]

Calculating this sum:

\[
600 + 250 = 850
\]
\[
850 + 150 = 1000
\]
\[
1000 + 150 = 1150
\]

So, Chad's total earnings for the year are $1150.

**Step 2: Calculate 40% of Total Earnings**

Chad saves 40% of his total earnings. To find 40% of $1150, we use the formula for calculating a percentage of a number:

\[
\text{Amount Saved} = \frac{40}{100} \times 1150
\]

Simplifying the fraction:

\[
\frac{40}{100} = 0.4
\]

Now, multiply $1150 by 0.4:

\[
0.4 \times 1150 = 460
\]

**Final Answer:**

Chad will save $460.
