To determine how much Chad will save, we first need to calculate his total earnings for the year. We will then find 40% of that total to determine his savings.

### Step 1: Calculate Total Earnings

Chad's earnings come from several sources:

1. **Mowing yards:** $600
2. **Birthday/Holiday money:** $250
3. **Selling old video games:** $150
4. **Doing odd jobs:** $150

Now, we will sum these amounts to find his total earnings:

\[
\text{Total Earnings} = \text{Mowing yards} + \text{Birthday/Holiday} + \text{Selling video games} + \text{Odd jobs}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\text{Total Earnings} = 600 + 250 + 150 + 150
\]

Calculating the sum step-by-step:

1. \(600 + 250 = 850\)
2. \(850 + 150 = 1000\)
3. \(1000 + 150 = 1150\)

Thus, Chad's total earnings for the year are:

\[
\text{Total Earnings} = 1150
\]

### Step 2: Calculate Savings

Chad saves 40% of his total earnings. To find out how much he saves, we will calculate 40% of $1150.

The formula to calculate 40% is:

\[
\text{Savings} = \text{Total Earnings} \times 0.40
\]

Substituting the total earnings:

\[
\text{Savings} = 1150 \times 0.40
\]

Now, we perform the multiplication:

\[
\text{Savings} = 1150 \times 0.40 = 460
\]

### Final Answer

Chad will save **$460** this year.
