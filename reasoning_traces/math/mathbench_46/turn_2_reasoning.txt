==================================================

To solve "Sample math problem 46," we first need to understand what the problem is asking. Since the problem itself is not provided, I'll demonstrate how to approach a generic math problem by outlining a structured method for solving it. Let's assume "Sample math problem 46" involves solving a quadratic equation, as an example.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

**Step 1: Identify the Problem Type**

Assume the problem is to solve the quadratic equation:
\[ ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \]

**Step 2: Write Down the Given Equation**

For illustration, let's use:
\[ 2x^2 + 3x - 5 = 0 \]

**Step 3: Determine the Method of Solution**

Quadratic equations can be solved using several methods:
- Factoring
- Completing the square
- Quadratic formula

Here, we'll use the quadratic formula, which is:
\[ x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \]

**Step 4: Identify the Coefficients**

From the equation \( 2x^2 + 3x - 5 = 0 \), we identify:
- \( a = 2 \)
- \( b = 3 \)
- \( c = -5 \)

**Step 5: Calculate the Discriminant**

The discriminant (\( \Delta \)) is given by:
\[ \Delta = b^2 - 4ac \]

Substitute the values:
\[ \Delta = 3^2 - 4 \times 2 \times (-5) \]
\[ \Delta = 9 + 40 \]
\[ \Delta = 49 \]

**Step 6: Apply the Quadratic Formula**

Since the discriminant is positive, there are two real solutions:
\[ x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{\Delta}}{2a} \]

Substitute the values:
\[ x = \frac{-3 \pm \sqrt{49}}{2 \times 2} \]
\[ x = \frac{-3 \pm 7}{4} \]

**Step 7: Solve for the Two Possible Values of \( x \)**

1. \( x = \frac{-3 + 7}{4} = \frac{4}{4} = 1 \)
2. \( x = \frac{-3 - 7}{4} = \frac{-10}{4} = -2.5 \)

**Step 8: State the Final Answer**

The solutions to the quadratic equation \( 2x^2 + 3x - 5 = 0 \) are:
\[ x = 1 \quad \text{and} \quad x = -2.5 \]

### Conclusion

By following these steps, we solved the quadratic equation using the quadratic formula. The final answers are \( x = 1 \) and \( x = -2.5 \). This structured approach ensures that all calculations are clear and logical, leading to the correct solution.
