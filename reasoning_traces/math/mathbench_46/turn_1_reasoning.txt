==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 46," we need to first understand what the problem is asking. However, since "Sample math problem 46" is not a specific question, I'll create a hypothetical math problem and solve it step by step.

Let's assume "Sample math problem 46" is the following:

**Problem:**
A rectangle has a length that is twice its width. If the perimeter of the rectangle is 48 units, find the dimensions of the rectangle.

**Solution:**

1. **Understand the problem:**
   - We have a rectangle with a length (L) and a width (W).
   - The length is twice the width: \( L = 2W \).
   - The perimeter of the rectangle is 48 units.

2. **Recall the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle:**
   \[
   \text{Perimeter} = 2L + 2W
   \]

3. **Substitute the expression for L into the perimeter formula:**
   \[
   2(2W) + 2W = 48
   \]

4. **Simplify the equation:**
   \[
   4W + 2W = 48
   \]
   \[
   6W = 48
   \]

5. **Solve for W:**
   \[
   W = \frac{48}{6} = 8
   \]

6. **Find L using the relationship \( L = 2W \):**
   \[
   L = 2 \times 8 = 16
   \]

7. **Verify the solution:**
   - Check the perimeter with the found dimensions:
     \[
     2L + 2W = 2(16) + 2(8) = 32 + 16 = 48
     \]
   - The calculated perimeter matches the given perimeter, confirming our solution is correct.

**Final Answer:**
The dimensions of the rectangle are:
- Width (W) = 8 units
- Length (L) = 16 units
