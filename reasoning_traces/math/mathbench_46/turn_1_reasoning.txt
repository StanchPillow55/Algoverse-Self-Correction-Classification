==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 46," I need more specific information about the problem itself. Since the problem statement is not provided, I'll demonstrate how to solve a typical math problem by creating an example problem and solving it step by step.

**Example Problem:**

Calculate the value of \( x \) in the equation:

\[ 3x + 5 = 20 \]

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   The equation given is a linear equation in one variable, \( x \). Our goal is to solve for \( x \).

2. **Isolate the Variable:**
   To solve for \( x \), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We start by eliminating the constant term on the left side.

   \[ 3x + 5 = 20 \]

   Subtract 5 from both sides to get:

   \[ 3x + 5 - 5 = 20 - 5 \]

   Simplifying both sides gives:

   \[ 3x = 15 \]

3. **Solve for \( x \):**
   Now, we need to solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides of the equation by 3.

   \[ \frac{3x}{3} = \frac{15}{3} \]

   Simplifying both sides gives:

   \[ x = 5 \]

4. **Verify the Solution:**
   Substitute \( x = 5 \) back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies the equation.

   \[ 3(5) + 5 = 20 \]

   Simplifying the left side gives:

   \[ 15 + 5 = 20 \]

   \[ 20 = 20 \]

   Since both sides of the equation are equal, our solution \( x = 5 \) is correct.

**Final Answer:**

The value of \( x \) is 5.
