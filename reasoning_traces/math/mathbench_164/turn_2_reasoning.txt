Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we first need to understand what "Sample math problem 164" entails. Since the problem is not explicitly stated, I'll assume a generic math problem that involves a common topic, such as solving a linear equation. Let's work through a sample linear equation problem step by step.

**Sample Problem:**
Solve the equation \(3x + 5 = 20\).

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Equation:**
   The given equation is \(3x + 5 = 20\). This is a linear equation in one variable, \(x\).

2. **Isolate the Variable:**
   Our goal is to solve for \(x\). To do this, we need to isolate \(x\) on one side of the equation.

3. **Subtract 5 from Both Sides:**
   To eliminate the constant term on the left side, subtract 5 from both sides of the equation:
   \[
   3x + 5 - 5 = 20 - 5
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   3x = 15
   \]

4. **Divide by the Coefficient of \(x\):**
   The next step is to divide both sides by the coefficient of \(x\), which is 3, to solve for \(x\):
   \[
   \frac{3x}{3} = \frac{15}{3}
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   x = 5
   \]

5. **Verify the Solution:**
   To ensure the solution is correct, substitute \(x = 5\) back into the original equation:
   \[
   3(5) + 5 = 20
   \]
   Simplifying the left side gives:
   \[
   15 + 5 = 20
   \]
   \[
   20 = 20
   \]
   Since both sides of the equation are equal, the solution \(x = 5\) is verified.

**Final Answer:**
The solution to the equation \(3x + 5 = 20\) is \(x = 5\).
