==================================================

To solve the problem effectively, I need to first understand what "Sample math problem 164" entails. Since the problem isn't explicitly stated, I will create a hypothetical math problem labeled as "Sample math problem 164" and solve it step by step. 

Let's assume "Sample math problem 164" is as follows:

**Problem Statement:**
A rectangle has a length that is twice its width. If the perimeter of the rectangle is 48 units, find the dimensions of the rectangle.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We have a rectangle with a length (L) and a width (W).
   - The length is twice the width: \( L = 2W \).
   - The perimeter of the rectangle is 48 units.

2. **Recall the Formula for Perimeter:**
   - The perimeter (P) of a rectangle is given by the formula:
     \[
     P = 2L + 2W
     \]

3. **Set Up the Equation:**
   - Substitute the given perimeter and the relationship between length and width into the formula:
     \[
     48 = 2(2W) + 2W
     \]

4. **Simplify the Equation:**
   - Simplify the terms inside the equation:
     \[
     48 = 4W + 2W
     \]
   - Combine like terms:
     \[
     48 = 6W
     \]

5. **Solve for W (Width):**
   - Divide both sides of the equation by 6 to solve for W:
     \[
     W = \frac{48}{6} = 8
     \]

6. **Find L (Length):**
   - Use the relationship \( L = 2W \) to find the length:
     \[
     L = 2 \times 8 = 16
     \]

7. **Verify the Solution:**
   - Check that the dimensions satisfy the original perimeter condition:
     \[
     P = 2L + 2W = 2(16) + 2(8) = 32 + 16 = 48
     \]
   - The calculated perimeter matches the given perimeter, confirming our solution is correct.

**Final Answer:**
The dimensions of the rectangle are:
- Width (W) = 8 units
- Length (L) = 16 units
