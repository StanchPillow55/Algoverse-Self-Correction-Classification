==================================================

To solve "Sample math problem 164," we need more specific information about the problem itself. Since the problem statement is not provided, I'll guide you through a generic approach to solving math problems step by step. Once you provide the specific details of the problem, I can offer a more targeted solution.

### Generic Steps to Solve a Math Problem:

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - Read the problem carefully.
   - Identify what is being asked.
   - Determine what information is given and what needs to be found.

2. **Devise a Plan:**
   - Consider possible strategies to solve the problem, such as drawing a diagram, creating an equation, or breaking the problem into smaller parts.
   - Choose the most appropriate method based on the problem type (e.g., algebra, geometry, calculus).

3. **Carry Out the Plan:**
   - Execute the chosen strategy step by step.
   - Perform calculations carefully, showing all work.
   - Keep track of units and ensure consistency throughout the calculations.

4. **Review/Check Your Work:**
   - Verify each step to ensure accuracy.
   - Check if the solution makes sense in the context of the problem.
   - Recalculate if necessary to confirm the result.

5. **State the Final Answer:**
   - Clearly present the final answer, including units if applicable.
   - Ensure the answer directly addresses the question asked.

### Example Problem:

Let's assume a simple algebra problem for demonstration:

**Problem:** Solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We need to find the value of \( x \) that satisfies the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).

2. **Devise a Plan:**
   - We will isolate \( x \) by performing algebraic operations.

3. **Carry Out the Plan:**
   - Start with the equation: \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).
   - Subtract 3 from both sides to isolate the term with \( x \):
     \[
     2x + 3 - 3 = 11 - 3
     \]
     \[
     2x = 8
     \]
   - Divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( x \):
     \[
     \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{8}{2}
     \]
     \[
     x = 4
     \]

4. **Review/Check Your Work:**
   - Substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation to verify:
     \[
     2(4) + 3 = 8 + 3 = 11
     \]
   - The left side equals the right side, confirming our solution is correct.

5. **State the Final Answer:**
   - The solution to the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \) is \( x = 4 \).
