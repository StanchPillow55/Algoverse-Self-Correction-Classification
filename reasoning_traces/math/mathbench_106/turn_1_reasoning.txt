==================================================

To solve the problem, we first need to understand what "Sample math problem 106" refers to. Since the problem itself isn't provided, I'll create a hypothetical math problem labeled as "Sample math problem 106" and solve it step by step.

**Sample Math Problem 106:**

Calculate the value of \( x \) in the equation:
\[ 3x + 5 = 2x + 15 \]

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Equation:**
   The equation given is a linear equation in one variable, \( x \). Our goal is to find the value of \( x \) that satisfies this equation.

2. **Isolate the Variable:**
   To solve for \( x \), we need to get all the terms containing \( x \) on one side of the equation and the constant terms on the other side.

   Start by subtracting \( 2x \) from both sides of the equation to get the \( x \)-terms on one side:
   \[
   3x + 5 - 2x = 2x + 15 - 2x
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   x + 5 = 15
   \]

3. **Solve for \( x \):**
   Now, subtract 5 from both sides to isolate \( x \):
   \[
   x + 5 - 5 = 15 - 5
   \]
   Simplifying gives:
   \[
   x = 10
   \]

4. **Verify the Solution:**
   Substitute \( x = 10 \) back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies the equation:
   \[
   3(10) + 5 = 2(10) + 15
   \]
   Simplifying both sides:
   \[
   30 + 5 = 20 + 15
   \]
   \[
   35 = 35
   \]
   Since both sides of the equation are equal, our solution \( x = 10 \) is correct.

**Final Answer:**

The value of \( x \) is \( 10 \).
