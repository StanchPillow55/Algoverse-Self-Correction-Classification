==================================================

To solve the problem, we first need to understand what "Sample reasoning question 212" refers to. Since the problem statement doesn't provide specific details about the question, I'll demonstrate a general approach to solving a typical math reasoning problem. Let's assume the problem involves a common type of reasoning question, such as a number sequence or a logic puzzle.

### Example Problem: Number Sequence

**Problem Statement:**
Find the next number in the sequence: 2, 4, 8, 16, ...

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Identify the Pattern:**
   - Look at the sequence: 2, 4, 8, 16.
   - Notice that each number is double the previous number.

2. **Verify the Pattern:**
   - 2 × 2 = 4
   - 4 × 2 = 8
   - 8 × 2 = 16

3. **Apply the Pattern:**
   - To find the next number, multiply the last number by 2.
   - 16 × 2 = 32

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The next number in the sequence is 32.

### Example Problem: Logic Puzzle

**Problem Statement:**
There are three boxes. One contains apples, one contains oranges, and one contains both apples and oranges. The boxes are labeled incorrectly. You can pick one fruit from one box to determine the correct labeling. How do you do it?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - Each box is labeled incorrectly.
   - You need to determine the correct contents by picking one fruit.

2. **Strategy:**
   - Pick a fruit from the box labeled "Apples and Oranges."

3. **Reasoning:**
   - Since the box is labeled incorrectly, it cannot contain both fruits.
   - If you pick an apple, the box must contain only apples.
   - If you pick an orange, the box must contain only oranges.

4. **Determine Other Boxes:**
   - Suppose you picked an apple from the "Apples and Oranges" box:
     - The box labeled "Oranges" must contain both fruits (since it can't be just oranges).
     - The box labeled "Apples" must contain only oranges.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - By picking one fruit from the "Apples and Oranges" box, you can correctly label all boxes.

### Final Answer:

For the number sequence problem, the next number is 32. For the logic puzzle, you determine the correct labeling by picking one fruit from the box labeled "Apples and Oranges."

If you have a specific problem or need further assistance, please provide more details or clarify the question.
