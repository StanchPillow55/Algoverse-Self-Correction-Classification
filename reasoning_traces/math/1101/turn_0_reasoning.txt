==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to determine how many miles Ahito ran given the total miles run by Amber, Micah, and Ahito.

1. **Identify the distances run by Amber and Micah**:
   - Amber ran 8 miles.
   - Micah ran 3.5 times what Amber ran. To find out how many miles Micah ran, we calculate:
     \[
     \text{Miles Micah ran} = 3.5 \times \text{Miles Amber ran} = 3.5 \times 8
     \]
     Now, we perform the multiplication:
     \[
     3.5 \times 8 = 28
     \]
   - Therefore, Micah ran 28 miles.

2. **Calculate the total miles run by Amber and Micah**:
   - Now we add the miles run by Amber and Micah:
     \[
     \text{Total miles by Amber and Micah} = \text{Miles Amber ran} + \text{Miles Micah ran} = 8 + 28
     \]
     Performing the addition:
     \[
     8 + 28 = 36
     \]
   - So, Amber and Micah together ran 36 miles.

3. **Determine the miles run by Ahito**:
   - We know that the total miles run by all three (Amber, Micah, and Ahito) is 52 miles. To find out how many miles Ahito ran, we subtract the total miles run by Amber and Micah from the total miles:
     \[
     \text{Miles Ahito ran} = \text{Total miles} - \text{Total miles by Amber and Micah} = 52 - 36
     \]
     Performing the subtraction:
     \[
     52 - 36 = 16
     \]
   - Thus, Ahito ran 16 miles.

4. **Final Answer**:
   - The number of miles Ahito ran is \( \boxed{16} \).
