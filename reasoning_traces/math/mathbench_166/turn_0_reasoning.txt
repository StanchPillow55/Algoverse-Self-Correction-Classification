==================================================

It seems like you've referenced "Sample math problem 166," but without the specific details of the problem, I'm unable to provide a solution. However, I can guide you through a generic approach to solving math problems. If you provide the specific details of the problem, I can give a more tailored solution. Here's a general approach:

### Step-by-Step Approach to Solving Math Problems

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - Read the problem carefully.
   - Identify what is being asked.
   - Determine what information is given.

2. **Devise a Plan:**
   - Consider possible strategies to solve the problem. This could include:
     - Drawing a diagram.
     - Writing an equation.
     - Breaking the problem into smaller parts.
     - Looking for patterns.

3. **Carry Out the Plan:**
   - Execute the strategy you have chosen.
   - Perform calculations carefully.
   - Keep track of units and signs.

4. **Review/Check Your Work:**
   - Verify each step of your solution.
   - Check if your solution makes sense in the context of the problem.
   - Re-calculate if necessary.

5. **State the Final Answer:**
   - Clearly write down the final answer.
   - Include units if applicable.

### Example Problem and Solution

Let's solve a simple example problem using this approach:

**Example Problem:**
Find the sum of the first 10 positive integers.

**Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We need to find the sum of the first 10 positive integers: 1, 2, 3, ..., 10.

2. **Devise a Plan:**
   - Use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series: 
     \[
     S_n = \frac{n}{2} \times (a + l)
     \]
     where \( n \) is the number of terms, \( a \) is the first term, and \( l \) is the last term.

3. **Carry Out the Plan:**
   - Here, \( n = 10 \), \( a = 1 \), and \( l = 10 \).
   - Substitute these values into the formula:
     \[
     S_{10} = \frac{10}{2} \times (1 + 10) = 5 \times 11 = 55
     \]

4. **Review/Check Your Work:**
   - Double-check the formula and calculations.
   - Verify by adding the numbers directly: 
     \[
     1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 10 = 55
     \]

5. **State the Final Answer:**
   - The sum of the first 10 positive integers is 55.

If you provide the specific details of "Sample math problem 166," I can work through that problem specifically.
