==================================================

To solve the problem effectively, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 221" entails. Since the problem statement is not explicitly provided, I'll demonstrate a general approach to tackling reasoning questions in mathematics. This will involve breaking down the problem-solving process into clear, logical steps.

### Step-by-Step Problem Solving Approach

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - Carefully read the problem statement.
   - Identify what is being asked.
   - Determine what information is given and what needs to be found.

2. **Devise a Plan:**
   - Consider possible strategies to solve the problem.
   - Think about similar problems you have solved before.
   - Choose a strategy that seems most appropriate for the problem at hand.

3. **Carry Out the Plan:**
   - Execute the chosen strategy step by step.
   - Perform calculations carefully.
   - Keep track of your work to avoid mistakes.

4. **Review/Check Your Work:**
   - Verify each step of your solution.
   - Check if the final answer makes sense in the context of the problem.
   - Consider alternative methods to ensure the solution is robust.

### Hypothetical Example

Let's assume "Sample reasoning question 221" is a math problem involving algebraic reasoning. Here's how we might approach it:

**Problem Statement (Hypothetical):**
Solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).

**Step 1: Understand the Problem**
- We need to find the value of \( x \) that satisfies the equation.

**Step 2: Devise a Plan**
- We can isolate \( x \) by performing algebraic operations.

**Step 3: Carry Out the Plan**
- Start with the equation: \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).
- Subtract 3 from both sides to isolate the term with \( x \):
  \[
  2x + 3 - 3 = 11 - 3 \implies 2x = 8
  \]
- Divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( x \):
  \[
  \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{8}{2} \implies x = 4
  \]

**Step 4: Review/Check Your Work**
- Substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation to verify:
  \[
  2(4) + 3 = 8 + 3 = 11
  \]
- The left-hand side equals the right-hand side, confirming our solution is correct.

**Final Answer:**
The solution to the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \) is \( x = 4 \).

This structured approach ensures that we thoroughly understand and solve the problem, providing a clear and logical solution. If you have a specific problem or need further assistance, please provide more details, and I'll be happy to help!
