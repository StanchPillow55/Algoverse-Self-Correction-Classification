==================================================

To solve "Sample reasoning question 221," we need to first understand what the problem is asking. However, since the problem statement is not provided here, I'll demonstrate a general approach to solving math problems by using a hypothetical example. Let's assume the problem is as follows:

**Example Problem:**
A store sells apples at $2 each and oranges at $3 each. If a customer buys a total of 10 fruits consisting of apples and oranges and spends a total of $25, how many apples and how many oranges did the customer buy?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( x \) be the number of apples.
   - Let \( y \) be the number of oranges.

2. **Set Up Equations:**
   - From the problem, we have two key pieces of information:
     1. The total number of fruits is 10.
     2. The total cost is $25.
   - This gives us the following system of equations:
     \[
     x + y = 10
     \]
     \[
     2x + 3y = 25
     \]

3. **Solve the System of Equations:**
   - We can use the substitution or elimination method. Here, we'll use substitution.
   - Solve the first equation for \( x \):
     \[
     x = 10 - y
     \]
   - Substitute \( x = 10 - y \) into the second equation:
     \[
     2(10 - y) + 3y = 25
     \]
   - Simplify and solve for \( y \):
     \[
     20 - 2y + 3y = 25
     \]
     \[
     20 + y = 25
     \]
     \[
     y = 5
     \]
   - Substitute \( y = 5 \) back into the equation \( x = 10 - y \):
     \[
     x = 10 - 5 = 5
     \]

4. **Verify the Solution:**
   - Check the total number of fruits:
     \[
     x + y = 5 + 5 = 10
     \]
   - Check the total cost:
     \[
     2x + 3y = 2(5) + 3(5) = 10 + 15 = 25
     \]
   - Both conditions are satisfied.

5. **State the Final Answer:**
   - The customer bought 5 apples and 5 oranges.

This approach demonstrates how to systematically solve a problem by defining variables, setting up equations, solving the system, and verifying the solution.
