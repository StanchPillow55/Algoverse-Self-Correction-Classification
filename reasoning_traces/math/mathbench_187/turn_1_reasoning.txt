Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve "Sample math problem 187," we need to first understand what the problem is asking. However, since "Sample math problem 187" is not a specific problem statement, I'll create a hypothetical math problem to demonstrate how to solve it step-by-step. 

Let's assume the problem is as follows:

**Problem:**  
Solve for \( x \) in the equation:  
\[ 3x + 5 = 20 \]

**Step 1: Understand the Problem**  
We need to find the value of \( x \) that satisfies the equation \( 3x + 5 = 20 \).

**Step 2: Isolate the Variable**  
To solve for \( x \), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We start by eliminating the constant term on the left side of the equation.

Subtract 5 from both sides of the equation:
\[ 3x + 5 - 5 = 20 - 5 \]

This simplifies to:
\[ 3x = 15 \]

**Step 3: Solve for the Variable**  
Now, we need to solve for \( x \) by getting rid of the coefficient of \( x \), which is 3. We do this by dividing both sides of the equation by 3.

Divide both sides by 3:
\[ \frac{3x}{3} = \frac{15}{3} \]

This simplifies to:
\[ x = 5 \]

**Step 4: Verify the Solution**  
To ensure our solution is correct, we substitute \( x = 5 \) back into the original equation and check if both sides are equal.

Substitute \( x = 5 \) into the original equation:
\[ 3(5) + 5 = 20 \]

Calculate the left side:
\[ 15 + 5 = 20 \]

Since both sides are equal, our solution is verified.

**Final Answer:**  
The solution to the equation \( 3x + 5 = 20 \) is \( x = 5 \).
