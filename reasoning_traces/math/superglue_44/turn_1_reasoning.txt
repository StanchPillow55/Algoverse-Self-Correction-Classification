==================================================

To solve the problem effectively, I need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 44" refers to. However, since I don't have access to external databases or specific documents, I will assume this is a placeholder for a generic math problem. Without specific details, I'll create a hypothetical math problem and solve it step-by-step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**

A farmer has a rectangular field that is 120 meters long and 80 meters wide. He wants to divide the field into smaller rectangular plots, each with an area of 240 square meters. How many such plots can he create?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We have a large rectangle (the field) with dimensions 120 meters by 80 meters.
   - We need to divide this field into smaller rectangles, each with an area of 240 square meters.

2. **Calculate the Total Area of the Field:**
   - The area of a rectangle is given by the formula: 
     \[
     \text{Area} = \text{Length} \times \text{Width}
     \]
   - For the field:
     \[
     \text{Area of the field} = 120 \, \text{m} \times 80 \, \text{m} = 9600 \, \text{square meters}
     \]

3. **Determine the Number of Smaller Plots:**
   - Each smaller plot has an area of 240 square meters.
   - To find the number of such plots, divide the total area of the field by the area of one plot:
     \[
     \text{Number of plots} = \frac{\text{Area of the field}}{\text{Area of one plot}} = \frac{9600 \, \text{square meters}}{240 \, \text{square meters}}
     \]

4. **Perform the Division:**
   - Simplify the division:
     \[
     \frac{9600}{240} = 40
     \]

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The farmer can create 40 smaller plots, each with an area of 240 square meters.

**Final Answer:**
The farmer can create 40 plots, each with an area of 240 square meters.
