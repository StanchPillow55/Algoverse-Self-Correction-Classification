==================================================

To solve the problem effectively, I need to first understand the context and details of "Sample reasoning question 44," which unfortunately is not provided in your prompt. However, I can guide you through a general approach to solving reasoning problems in mathematics. 

Let's assume "Sample reasoning question 44" is a typical math reasoning problem. Here's how I would approach it:

### Step 1: Understand the Problem
- **Read the Problem Carefully**: Ensure you understand what is being asked. Identify the key information and what the problem is asking you to find.
- **Identify Known and Unknown Variables**: Determine what information is given and what you need to find.

### Step 2: Devise a Plan
- **Choose a Strategy**: Depending on the problem, decide on a strategy. Common strategies include:
  - Drawing a diagram
  - Creating a table
  - Writing an equation
  - Logical reasoning
  - Working backward

### Step 3: Carry Out the Plan
- **Execute Your Strategy**: Apply the chosen strategy step by step. Be meticulous with calculations and logical steps.
- **Show All Work**: Write down each step clearly, showing all calculations and reasoning.

### Step 4: Review/Check Your Work
- **Verify Each Step**: Ensure each step follows logically from the previous one.
- **Check the Final Answer**: Make sure the answer makes sense in the context of the problem. Re-check calculations if necessary.

### Example Problem and Solution
Since I don't have the specific details of "Sample reasoning question 44," let's consider a sample problem:

**Problem**: A farmer has 100 meters of fencing and wants to enclose a rectangular area. What dimensions should the rectangle have to maximize the enclosed area?

**Solution**:

1. **Understand the Problem**: We need to maximize the area of a rectangle with a fixed perimeter of 100 meters.

2. **Devise a Plan**:
   - Let the length be \( l \) and the width be \( w \).
   - The perimeter is given by \( 2l + 2w = 100 \).
   - The area \( A \) is given by \( A = lw \).
   - We need to express \( A \) in terms of one variable.

3. **Carry Out the Plan**:
   - From the perimeter equation: \( 2l + 2w = 100 \) or \( l + w = 50 \).
   - Express \( w \) in terms of \( l \): \( w = 50 - l \).
   - Substitute into the area formula: \( A = l(50 - l) = 50l - l^2 \).
   - This is a quadratic equation in the form \( A = -l^2 + 50l \).

4. **Maximize the Area**:
   - The quadratic equation \( A = -l^2 + 50l \) is a downward-opening parabola.
   - The maximum area occurs at the vertex of the parabola.
   - The vertex \( l \) is given by \( l = -\frac{b}{2a} \) where \( a = -1 \) and \( b = 50 \).
   - \( l = -\frac{50}{2(-1)} = 25 \).
   - Therefore, \( w = 50 - l = 25 \).

5. **Review/Check Your Work**:
   - The dimensions that maximize the area are \( l = 25 \) meters and \( w = 25 \) meters.
   - The maximum area is \( A = 25 \times 25 = 625 \) square meters.

**Final Answer**: The rectangle should be a square with side lengths of 25 meters to maximize the area, resulting in an area of 625 square meters.

If you have the specific details of "Sample reasoning question 44," please provide them, and I can tailor the solution to that particular problem.
