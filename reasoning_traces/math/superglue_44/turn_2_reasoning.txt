==================================================

To solve the problem effectively, I need to understand what "Sample reasoning question 44" refers to. Since I don't have access to external databases or specific documents, I will assume this is a hypothetical or generic math problem. Without specific details, I will create a sample math problem and solve it step-by-step.

**Sample Problem:**

A store sells two types of candies: chocolate and gummy bears. The price of a chocolate is $2, and the price of a gummy bear is $1.50. If a customer buys a total of 15 candies and spends $25, how many chocolates and gummy bears did the customer buy?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( x \) be the number of chocolates.
   - Let \( y \) be the number of gummy bears.

2. **Set Up Equations:**
   - The total number of candies equation: 
     \[
     x + y = 15
     \]
   - The total cost equation:
     \[
     2x + 1.5y = 25
     \]

3. **Solve the System of Equations:**

   First, solve the first equation for one of the variables. Let's solve for \( y \):
   \[
   y = 15 - x
   \]

   Substitute \( y = 15 - x \) into the second equation:
   \[
   2x + 1.5(15 - x) = 25
   \]

   Distribute the 1.5:
   \[
   2x + 22.5 - 1.5x = 25
   \]

   Combine like terms:
   \[
   0.5x + 22.5 = 25
   \]

   Subtract 22.5 from both sides:
   \[
   0.5x = 2.5
   \]

   Divide by 0.5:
   \[
   x = 5
   \]

4. **Find \( y \):**

   Substitute \( x = 5 \) back into the equation \( y = 15 - x \):
   \[
   y = 15 - 5 = 10
   \]

5. **Verify the Solution:**

   Check the total number of candies:
   \[
   x + y = 5 + 10 = 15
   \]

   Check the total cost:
   \[
   2x + 1.5y = 2(5) + 1.5(10) = 10 + 15 = 25
   \]

   Both conditions are satisfied.

**Final Answer:**

The customer bought 5 chocolates and 10 gummy bears.
