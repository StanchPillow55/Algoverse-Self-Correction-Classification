==================================================

To solve "Sample reasoning question 44," we need to first understand the problem. However, the question as presented is incomplete and does not provide specific details or numbers to work with. Therefore, I will demonstrate a general approach to solving a typical math problem by creating a sample problem and solving it step by step.

### Sample Problem:
**Question:** A train travels from City A to City B, a distance of 300 kilometers. The train travels the first half of the distance at a speed of 60 km/h and the second half at a speed of 90 km/h. What is the average speed of the train for the entire journey?

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - Total distance = 300 km.
   - Distance for each half = 300 km / 2 = 150 km.
   - Speed for the first half = 60 km/h.
   - Speed for the second half = 90 km/h.

2. **Calculate the Time for Each Half:**
   - Time for the first half:
     \[
     \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{150 \text{ km}}{60 \text{ km/h}} = 2.5 \text{ hours}
     \]

   - Time for the second half:
     \[
     \text{Time} = \frac{150 \text{ km}}{90 \text{ km/h}} = \frac{150}{90} \text{ hours} = \frac{5}{3} \text{ hours} \approx 1.67 \text{ hours}
     \]

3. **Calculate the Total Time for the Journey:**
   \[
   \text{Total time} = 2.5 \text{ hours} + \frac{5}{3} \text{ hours} = 2.5 + 1.67 = 4.17 \text{ hours}
   \]

4. **Calculate the Average Speed:**
   - Average speed is defined as the total distance divided by the total time.
   \[
   \text{Average speed} = \frac{\text{Total distance}}{\text{Total time}} = \frac{300 \text{ km}}{4.17 \text{ hours}} \approx 71.94 \text{ km/h}
   \]

5. **State the Final Answer:**
   - The average speed of the train for the entire journey is approximately 71.94 km/h.

This solution demonstrates a structured approach to solving a problem involving average speed, including understanding the problem, calculating individual times, and then using these to find the average speed. If you have a specific "Sample reasoning question 44" in mind, please provide the details, and I can work through that specific problem.
