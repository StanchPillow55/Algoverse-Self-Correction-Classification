==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 290," we need to first understand what the problem is asking. However, the problem statement "Sample math problem 290" is not specific enough for me to determine the exact mathematical question or context. 

To proceed, I'll assume that "Sample math problem 290" is a placeholder for a specific math problem. Since I don't have the details of the problem, I'll demonstrate how to solve a generic math problem and show the steps involved. Let's assume a typical algebra problem:

**Example Problem:**
Solve for \( x \) in the equation: \( 2x + 5 = 13 \).

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Equation:**
   The equation given is \( 2x + 5 = 13 \). Our goal is to solve for \( x \).

2. **Isolate the Variable:**
   To solve for \( x \), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We start by getting rid of the constant term on the left side.

   Subtract 5 from both sides of the equation:
   \[
   2x + 5 - 5 = 13 - 5
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   2x = 8
   \]

3. **Solve for \( x \):**
   Now, we need to solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides by 2:
   \[
   \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{8}{2}
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   x = 4
   \]

4. **Verify the Solution:**
   Substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation to verify:
   \[
   2(4) + 5 = 13
   \]
   Simplifying the left side gives:
   \[
   8 + 5 = 13
   \]
   \[
   13 = 13
   \]
   Since both sides of the equation are equal, our solution \( x = 4 \) is correct.

**Final Answer:**
The solution to the equation \( 2x + 5 = 13 \) is \( x = 4 \).
