==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what is being asked. The question states "Sample reasoning question 360," but it doesn't provide any specific details or context. Therefore, I'll assume that this is a placeholder for a typical math problem that involves reasoning. 

Let's create a sample math problem involving reasoning and solve it step by step:

**Sample Problem:**
A company produces 360 units of a product each day. Each unit requires 3 hours of labor to produce. If the company has 15 workers and each worker works 8 hours a day, can the company meet its production goal each day?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Determine the Total Labor Hours Required:**
   - Each unit requires 3 hours of labor.
   - The company produces 360 units per day.
   - Total labor hours required per day = 360 units * 3 hours/unit = 1080 hours.

2. **Determine the Total Labor Hours Available:**
   - The company has 15 workers.
   - Each worker works 8 hours a day.
   - Total labor hours available per day = 15 workers * 8 hours/worker = 120 hours.

3. **Compare Labor Hours Required with Labor Hours Available:**
   - Labor hours required per day = 1080 hours.
   - Labor hours available per day = 120 hours.

4. **Analyze the Situation:**
   - The company requires 1080 hours of labor to meet its production goal.
   - However, the company only has 120 hours of labor available each day.
   - Since 1080 hours > 120 hours, the company cannot meet its production goal with the current number of workers and working hours.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The company needs more labor hours to meet its production goal.
   - To meet the goal, the company could either hire more workers or increase the working hours of the current workers.

**Final Answer:**
No, the company cannot meet its production goal of 360 units per day with the current number of workers and working hours.
