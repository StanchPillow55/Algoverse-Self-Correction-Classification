To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 360" refers to. Since the question is not explicitly stated, I'll assume it's a placeholder for a typical math problem. Let's create a hypothetical math problem and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**

A company produces 360 widgets in a day. Each widget requires 3 screws and 2 bolts. If screws are sold in boxes of 100 and bolts are sold in boxes of 50, how many boxes of screws and bolts are needed for one day of production?

**Solution:**

1. **Determine the total number of screws needed:**

   Each widget requires 3 screws. Therefore, for 360 widgets, the total number of screws needed is:
   \[
   360 \text{ widgets} \times 3 \text{ screws/widget} = 1080 \text{ screws}
   \]

2. **Determine the total number of bolts needed:**

   Each widget requires 2 bolts. Therefore, for 360 widgets, the total number of bolts needed is:
   \[
   360 \text{ widgets} \times 2 \text{ bolts/widget} = 720 \text{ bolts}
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of boxes of screws needed:**

   Screws are sold in boxes of 100. To find out how many boxes are needed for 1080 screws, we divide the total number of screws by the number of screws per box:
   \[
   \frac{1080 \text{ screws}}{100 \text{ screws/box}} = 10.8 \text{ boxes}
   \]
   Since we cannot purchase a fraction of a box, we round up to the nearest whole number, which is 11 boxes.

4. **Calculate the number of boxes of bolts needed:**

   Bolts are sold in boxes of 50. To find out how many boxes are needed for 720 bolts, we divide the total number of bolts by the number of bolts per box:
   \[
   \frac{720 \text{ bolts}}{50 \text{ bolts/box}} = 14.4 \text{ boxes}
   \]
   Again, since we cannot purchase a fraction of a box, we round up to the nearest whole number, which is 15 boxes.

**Final Answer:**

The company needs 11 boxes of screws and 15 boxes of bolts for one day of production.
