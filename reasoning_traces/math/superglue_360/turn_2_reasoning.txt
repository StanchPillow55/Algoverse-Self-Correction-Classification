==================================================

To solve the problem effectively, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 360" refers to. Since the question is not explicitly stated, I will assume it is a placeholder for a mathematical problem. Let's create a hypothetical problem and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**

Calculate the sum of all even numbers between 1 and 360.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Identify the Range of Even Numbers:**
   - The even numbers between 1 and 360 start from 2 and end at 360.

2. **Determine the Sequence of Even Numbers:**
   - The sequence of even numbers can be represented as: 2, 4, 6, ..., 360.
   - This is an arithmetic sequence where the first term \( a_1 = 2 \) and the common difference \( d = 2 \).

3. **Find the Number of Terms in the Sequence:**
   - The general formula for the \( n \)-th term of an arithmetic sequence is given by:
     \[
     a_n = a_1 + (n-1) \cdot d
     \]
   - Set \( a_n = 360 \), \( a_1 = 2 \), and \( d = 2 \):
     \[
     360 = 2 + (n-1) \cdot 2
     \]
     \[
     360 = 2 + 2n - 2
     \]
     \[
     360 = 2n
     \]
     \[
     n = \frac{360}{2} = 180
     \]
   - There are 180 even numbers between 1 and 360.

4. **Calculate the Sum of the Sequence:**
   - The sum \( S_n \) of the first \( n \) terms of an arithmetic sequence is given by:
     \[
     S_n = \frac{n}{2} \cdot (a_1 + a_n)
     \]
   - Substitute \( n = 180 \), \( a_1 = 2 \), and \( a_n = 360 \):
     \[
     S_{180} = \frac{180}{2} \cdot (2 + 360)
     \]
     \[
     S_{180} = 90 \cdot 362
     \]
   - Calculate \( 90 \times 362 \):
     \[
     90 \times 362 = 90 \times (360 + 2) = 90 \times 360 + 90 \times 2
     \]
     \[
     90 \times 360 = 32400
     \]
     \[
     90 \times 2 = 180
     \]
     \[
     90 \times 362 = 32400 + 180 = 32580
     \]

**Final Answer:**

The sum of all even numbers between 1 and 360 is 32,580.
