==================================================

It seems like the problem statement is incomplete or unclear. "Sample reasoning question 25" doesn't provide enough information for me to solve a specific math problem. However, I can guide you through a general approach to solving math problems by using a step-by-step method. If you have a specific math problem in mind, please provide the details, and I'll be happy to help.

Here's a general approach to solving math problems:

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - Carefully read the problem statement.
   - Identify what is being asked.
   - Note down any given information or data.

2. **Devise a Plan:**
   - Think about the mathematical concepts or formulas that might be relevant.
   - Consider drawing a diagram if it helps visualize the problem.
   - Break the problem into smaller, manageable parts if necessary.

3. **Carry Out the Plan:**
   - Perform calculations step by step.
   - Keep track of units and ensure consistency.
   - Double-check each step to avoid errors.

4. **Review/Check Your Work:**
   - Verify that your solution answers the question asked.
   - Check calculations for accuracy.
   - Consider if the answer makes sense in the context of the problem.

5. **State the Final Answer:**
