==================================================

It seems like there might be some confusion or missing information in your request. "Sample reasoning question 25" doesn't provide enough context or details for me to solve a specific math problem. However, I can guide you through a generic approach to solving a math problem using logical reasoning. 

Let's assume we have a typical math problem to solve. I'll create a sample problem and demonstrate how to solve it step by step.

**Sample Problem:**

A car travels 150 miles in 3 hours. What is the average speed of the car in miles per hour?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We need to find the average speed of the car.
   - We know the distance traveled is 150 miles.
   - The time taken is 3 hours.

2. **Identify the Formula:**
   - The formula to calculate average speed is:
     \[
     \text{Average Speed} = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Total Time}}
     \]

3. **Substitute the Known Values:**
   - Total Distance = 150 miles
   - Total Time = 3 hours
   - Substitute these values into the formula:
     \[
     \text{Average Speed} = \frac{150 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ hours}}
     \]

4. **Perform the Calculation:**
   - Divide 150 by 3:
     \[
     \text{Average Speed} = 50 \text{ miles per hour}
     \]

5. **Verify the Solution:**
   - Check if the units make sense: We are looking for a speed in miles per hour, which matches our calculation.
   - Recalculate to ensure there are no arithmetic errors.

6. **State the Final Answer:**
   - The average speed of the car is 50 miles per hour.

This is a simple example of how to approach solving a math problem by breaking it down into clear steps, using the appropriate formulas, and verifying the solution. If you have a specific problem or need further assistance, please provide more details, and I'll be happy to help!
