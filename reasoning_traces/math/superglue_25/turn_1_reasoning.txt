==================================================

To solve the problem effectively, let's first understand what is being asked. The question is titled "Sample reasoning question 25," but it doesn't provide specific details or numbers to work with. Therefore, I will assume this is a placeholder for a typical math problem, and I will create a sample problem to demonstrate the process of solving it.

Let's assume the problem is as follows:

**Problem:**
A store sells apples at $2 each and oranges at $3 each. A customer buys a total of 10 fruits, spending exactly $25. How many apples and how many oranges did the customer buy?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( x \) be the number of apples.
   - Let \( y \) be the number of oranges.

2. **Set Up Equations:**
   - Since the total number of fruits is 10, we have the equation:
     \[
     x + y = 10
     \]
   - Since the total cost is $25, we have the equation:
     \[
     2x + 3y = 25
     \]

3. **Solve the System of Equations:**
   - We have the system:
     \[
     \begin{align*}
     x + y &= 10 \quad \text{(Equation 1)} \\
     2x + 3y &= 25 \quad \text{(Equation 2)}
     \end{align*}
     \]

4. **Substitute \( y \) from Equation 1 into Equation 2:**
   - From Equation 1, express \( y \) in terms of \( x \):
     \[
     y = 10 - x
     \]
   - Substitute \( y = 10 - x \) into Equation 2:
     \[
     2x + 3(10 - x) = 25
     \]

5. **Simplify and Solve for \( x \):**
   \[
   2x + 30 - 3x = 25
   \]
   \[
   -x + 30 = 25
   \]
   \[
   -x = 25 - 30
   \]
   \[
   -x = -5
   \]
   \[
   x = 5
   \]

6. **Find \( y \) Using the Value of \( x \):**
   - Substitute \( x = 5 \) back into Equation 1:
     \[
     5 + y = 10
     \]
     \[
     y = 10 - 5
     \]
     \[
     y = 5
     \]

7. **Verify the Solution:**
   - Check the total number of fruits:
     \[
     x + y = 5 + 5 = 10
     \]
   - Check the total cost:
     \[
     2x + 3y = 2(5) + 3(5) = 10 + 15 = 25
     \]

Both conditions are satisfied, confirming the solution is correct.

**Final Answer:**
The customer bought 5 apples and 5 oranges.
