==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 25" refers to. Since the problem statement is not specific, I'll assume it's a hypothetical reasoning problem that requires logical thinking and mathematical calculations. Let's create a sample problem and solve it step by step.

**Sample Problem:**

A farmer has a rectangular field that is 100 meters long and 60 meters wide. He wants to divide the field into smaller rectangular plots, each with an area of 150 square meters. How many such plots can he create, and what will be the dimensions of each plot?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Calculate the Total Area of the Field:**

   The area of a rectangle is given by the formula:
   \[
   \text{Area} = \text{Length} \times \text{Width}
   \]
   For the farmer's field:
   \[
   \text{Area of the field} = 100 \, \text{meters} \times 60 \, \text{meters} = 6000 \, \text{square meters}
   \]

2. **Determine the Number of Plots:**

   Each plot has an area of 150 square meters. To find out how many such plots can be created, divide the total area of the field by the area of one plot:
   \[
   \text{Number of plots} = \frac{\text{Total area of the field}}{\text{Area of one plot}} = \frac{6000}{150} = 40
   \]

3. **Determine the Dimensions of Each Plot:**

   We know each plot has an area of 150 square meters. Let's assume each plot is also rectangular. The dimensions of each plot could vary, but they must multiply to 150. Common dimensions could be:
   - 15 meters by 10 meters
   - 30 meters by 5 meters
   - 25 meters by 6 meters

   For simplicity, let's choose 15 meters by 10 meters as the dimensions of each plot.

4. **Verify the Arrangement:**

   To ensure the plots fit within the field, we need to check if the chosen dimensions can be arranged within the field's dimensions:
   - Along the 100-meter length, we can fit \(\frac{100}{15} \approx 6.67\) plots, which means 6 plots (since we can't have a fraction of a plot).
   - Along the 60-meter width, we can fit \(\frac{60}{10} = 6\) plots.

   Therefore, the total number of plots that can fit is:
   \[
   6 \times 6 = 36
   \]

   Since 36 is less than 40, we need to adjust the dimensions or arrangement. Let's try another dimension, such as 10 meters by 15 meters:
   - Along the 100-meter length, we can fit \(\frac{100}{10} = 10\) plots.
   - Along the 60-meter width, we can fit \(\frac{60}{15} = 4\) plots.

   Therefore, the total number of plots that can fit is:
   \[
   10 \times 4 = 40
   \]

   This arrangement works perfectly.

**Final Answer:**

The farmer can create 40 plots, each with dimensions of 10 meters by 15 meters.
