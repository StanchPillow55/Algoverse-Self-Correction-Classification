To solve a math problem effectively, it's important to understand the problem, identify the relevant information, and apply appropriate mathematical concepts. Since the question provided is "Sample reasoning question 6," I'll create a hypothetical math problem and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**

A farmer has a rectangular field that is 120 meters long and 80 meters wide. He wants to divide the field into smaller rectangular sections, each with an area of 240 square meters, to plant different crops. How many such sections can he create?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We have a rectangular field with dimensions 120 meters by 80 meters.
   - We need to divide this field into smaller sections, each with an area of 240 square meters.

2. **Calculate the Total Area of the Field:**
   - The area of a rectangle is given by the formula: Area = Length × Width.
   - For the field: Area = 120 meters × 80 meters = 9600 square meters.

3. **Determine the Number of Smaller Sections:**
   - Each smaller section has an area of 240 square meters.
   - To find the number of sections, divide the total area of the field by the area of one section.
   - Number of sections = Total Area of Field / Area of One Section
   - Number of sections = 9600 square meters / 240 square meters = 40 sections.

4. **Verify the Calculation:**
   - Multiply the number of sections by the area of one section to ensure it equals the total area of the field.
   - 40 sections × 240 square meters/section = 9600 square meters.
   - The calculation is correct.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The farmer can divide the field into 40 smaller sections, each with an area of 240 square meters.

**Final Answer:**
The farmer can create 40 sections, each with an area of 240 square meters.
