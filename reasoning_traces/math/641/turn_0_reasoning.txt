To determine how much money Tim will make in a year after his promotion, we need to calculate his new monthly salary after the raise, the bonus he will receive, and then find out his total earnings for the year.

### Step 1: Calculate the raise
Tim's current salary is $20,000 per month. He receives a 5% raise on this amount.

1. **Calculate 5% of $20,000:**
   \[
   \text{Raise} = 0.05 \times 20000 = 1000
   \]

2. **Add the raise to the current salary:**
   \[
   \text{New Salary} = 20000 + 1000 = 21000
   \]

### Step 2: Calculate the bonus
The bonus is worth half a month's salary based on his new salary.

1. **Calculate half of the new monthly salary:**
   \[
   \text{Bonus} = \frac{1}{2} \times 21000 = 10500
   \]

### Step 3: Calculate total earnings for the year
Now we need to calculate Tim's total earnings for the year, which includes his new salary for 12 months plus the bonus.

1. **Calculate annual salary:**
   \[
   \text{Annual Salary} = 21000 \times 12 = 252000
   \]

2. **Add the bonus to the annual salary:**
   \[
   \text{Total Earnings for the Year} = 252000 + 10500 = 262500
   \]

### Final Answer
Tim will make a total of **$262,500** in a year after his promotion.
