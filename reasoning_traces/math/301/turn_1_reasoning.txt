Question ID: 301
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine how many students fall into each category of novel reading and then find out how many students do not read any novels.

**Step 1: Calculate the number of students in each reading category.**

1. **Students reading three or more novels:**
   - According to the problem, \( \frac{1}{6} \) of the students read three or more novels.
   - Total number of students = 240.
   - Number of students reading three or more novels = \( \frac{1}{6} \times 240 = 40 \).

2. **Students reading two novels:**
   - 35% of the students read two novels.
   - Number of students reading two novels = 35% of 240.
   - Convert 35% to a decimal: 0.35.
   - Number of students reading two novels = \( 0.35 \times 240 = 84 \).

3. **Students reading one novel:**
   - \( \frac{5}{12} \) of the students read one novel.
   - Number of students reading one novel = \( \frac{5}{12} \times 240 \).
   - Calculate \( \frac{5}{12} \times 240 \):
     \[
     \frac{5}{12} \times 240 = \frac{5 \times 240}{12} = \frac{1200}{12} = 100
     \]

**Step 2: Calculate the number of students who do not read any novels.**

- Total number of students = 240.
- Total number of students who read novels = Number of students reading three or more novels + Number of students reading two novels + Number of students reading one novel.
- Total number of students who read novels = 40 + 84 + 100 = 224.

- Number of students who do not read any novels = Total number of students - Total number of students who read novels.
- Number of students who do not read any novels = 240 - 224 = 16.

**Final Answer:**
The number of students who do not read any novels is 16.
