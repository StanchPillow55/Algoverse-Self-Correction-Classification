Question ID: 301
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine how many students fall into each category based on the given fractions and percentages, and then find out how many students do not read any novels.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Total number of students**:  
   The total number of students surveyed is 240.

2. **Students who read three or more novels**:  
   We are told that \( \frac{1}{6} \) of the students read three or more novels.  
   To find this number, we calculate:
   \[
   \frac{1}{6} \times 240 = 40
   \]
   So, 40 students read three or more novels.

3. **Students who read two novels**:  
   35% of the students read two novels.  
   To find this number, we calculate:
   \[
   0.35 \times 240 = 84
   \]
   So, 84 students read two novels.

4. **Students who read one novel**:  
   \( \frac{5}{12} \) of the students read one novel.  
   To find this number, we calculate:
   \[
   \frac{5}{12} \times 240 = 100
   \]
   So, 100 students read one novel.

5. **Students who do not read any novels**:  
   To find the number of students who do not read any novels, we first need to find out how many students read at least one novel. We add up the numbers from the previous categories:
   \[
   40 \text{ (three or more novels)} + 84 \text{ (two novels)} + 100 \text{ (one novel)} = 224
   \]
   This means 224 students read at least one novel.

   Therefore, the number of students who do not read any novels is:
   \[
   240 - 224 = 16
   \]

**Final Answer**:  
The number of students who do not read any novels is 16.
