==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to determine how many sixth-grade students do not read any novels based on the information provided.

1. **Total number of students**: 
   There are 240 sixth-grade students.

2. **Students reading three or more novels**:
   According to the problem, \( \frac{1}{6} \) of the students read three or more novels. 
   \[
   \text{Number of students reading three or more novels} = \frac{1}{6} \times 240 = 40
   \]

3. **Students reading two novels**:
   We know that 35% of the students read two novels. 
   \[
   \text{Number of students reading two novels} = 0.35 \times 240 = 84
   \]

4. **Students reading one novel**:
   The problem states that \( \frac{5}{12} \) of the students read one novel. 
   \[
   \text{Number of students reading one novel} = \frac{5}{12} \times 240 = 100
   \]

5. **Calculating total students who read novels**:
   Now, we can find the total number of students who read novels by adding the number of students in each category:
   \[
   \text{Total students reading novels} = \text{Students reading three or more novels} + \text{Students reading two novels} + \text{Students reading one novel}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total students reading novels} = 40 + 84 + 100 = 224
   \]

6. **Calculating students who do not read novels**:
   To find the number of students who do not read any novels, we subtract the total number of students who read novels from the total number of students:
   \[
   \text{Students not reading novels} = \text{Total students} - \text{Total students reading novels}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Students not reading novels} = 240 - 224 = 16
   \]

Thus, the final answer is that **16 students do not read novels**.
