==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine how many students fall into each category of reading habits and then find out how many students do not read any novels.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Total number of students:**  
   We are given that there are 240 sixth-grade students.

2. **Students who read three or more novels:**  
   According to the problem, \( \frac{1}{6} \) of the students read three or more novels.  
   To find this number, we calculate:
   \[
   \frac{1}{6} \times 240 = 40
   \]
   So, 40 students read three or more novels.

3. **Students who read two novels:**  
   We are told that 35% of the students read two novels.  
   To find this number, we calculate:
   \[
   0.35 \times 240 = 84
   \]
   So, 84 students read two novels.

4. **Students who read one novel:**  
   We are given that \( \frac{5}{12} \) of the students read one novel.  
   To find this number, we calculate:
   \[
   \frac{5}{12} \times 240 = 100
   \]
   So, 100 students read one novel.

5. **Students who do not read any novels:**  
   To find the number of students who do not read any novels, we subtract the number of students who read novels from the total number of students.  
   First, we sum up the students who read novels:
   \[
   40 \text{ (three or more novels)} + 84 \text{ (two novels)} + 100 \text{ (one novel)} = 224
   \]
   Now, subtract this from the total number of students:
   \[
   240 - 224 = 16
   \]
   Therefore, 16 students do not read any novels.

**Final Answer:**  
The number of students who do not read any novels is 16.
