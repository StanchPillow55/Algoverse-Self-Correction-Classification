==================================================

To find the total length of all the baked goods that Bill bakes, we need to calculate the total length of each type of baked good and then sum them up. Finally, we will convert the total length into feet.

1. **Calculate the total length of the rolls:**
   - Each roll is 4 inches long.
   - Bill bakes 300 rolls.
   - Total length of rolls = Number of rolls × Length of each roll
   \[
   \text{Total length of rolls} = 300 \text{ rolls} \times 4 \text{ inches/roll} = 1200 \text{ inches}
   \]

2. **Calculate the total length of the chocolate croissants:**
   - Each chocolate croissant is 6 inches long.
   - Bill bakes 120 chocolate croissants.
   - Total length of croissants = Number of croissants × Length of each croissant
   \[
   \text{Total length of croissants} = 120 \text{ croissants} \times 6 \text{ inches/croissant} = 720 \text{ inches}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total length of the baguettes:**
   - Each baguette is 2 feet long. Since we need to work in inches for consistency, we convert feet to inches (1 foot = 12 inches).
   - Therefore, each baguette is \(2 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 24 \text{ inches}\).
   - Bill bakes 60 baguettes.
   - Total length of baguettes = Number of baguettes × Length of each baguette
   \[
   \text{Total length of baguettes} = 60 \text{ baguettes} \times 24 \text{ inches/baguette} = 1440 \text{ inches}
   \]

4. **Sum the total lengths:**
   - Total length in inches = Total length of rolls + Total length of croissants + Total length of baguettes
   \[
   \text{Total length in inches} = 1200 \text{ inches} + 720 \text{ inches} + 1440 \text{ inches} = 3360 \text{ inches}
   \]

5. **Convert the total length from inches to feet:**
   - To convert inches to feet, we divide by 12 (since there are 12 inches in a foot).
   \[
   \text{Total length in feet} = \frac{3360 \text{ inches}}{12 \text{ inches/foot}} = 280 \text{ feet}
   \]

Thus, the total length of all the baked goods when placed end to end is **280 feet**.
