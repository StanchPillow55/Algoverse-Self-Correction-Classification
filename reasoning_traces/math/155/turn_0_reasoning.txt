To find the total length of all the baked goods that Bill makes, we need to calculate the total length of each type of baked good and then sum them up. Finally, we will convert the total length into feet.

### Step 1: Calculate the total length of rolls
- **Number of rolls**: 300
- **Length of each roll**: 4 inches

Total length of rolls in inches:
\[
\text{Total length of rolls} = \text{Number of rolls} \times \text{Length of each roll} = 300 \times 4 = 1200 \text{ inches}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the total length of chocolate croissants
- **Number of chocolate croissants**: 120
- **Length of each croissant**: 6 inches

Total length of chocolate croissants in inches:
\[
\text{Total length of croissants} = \text{Number of croissants} \times \text{Length of each croissant} = 120 \times 6 = 720 \text{ inches}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the total length of baguettes
- **Number of baguettes**: 60
- **Length of each baguette**: 2 feet

First, we need to convert the length of each baguette from feet to inches:
\[
\text{Length of each baguette in inches} = 2 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 24 \text{ inches}
\]

Now, calculate the total length of baguettes in inches:
\[
\text{Total length of baguettes} = \text{Number of baguettes} \times \text{Length of each baguette} = 60 \times 24 = 1440 \text{ inches}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the total length of all baked goods
Now we sum the lengths of rolls, croissants, and baguettes:
\[
\text{Total length} = \text{Total length of rolls} + \text{Total length of croissants} + \text{Total length of baguettes}
\]
\[
\text{Total length} = 1200 + 720 + 1440 = 3360 \text{ inches}
\]

### Step 5: Convert the total length from inches to feet
To convert inches to feet, we divide by 12 (since there are 12 inches in a foot):
\[
\text{Total length in feet} = \frac{\text{Total length in inches}}{12} = \frac{3360}{12} = 280 \text{ feet}
\]

### Final Answer
The total length of all the baked goods put end to end is **280 feet**.
