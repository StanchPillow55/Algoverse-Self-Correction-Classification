==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine how many mangoes Colby still has after selling some of them. Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Total Mangoes Harvested:**
   Colby harvested a total of 60 kilograms of mangoes.

2. **Mangoes Sold to the Market:**
   Colby sold 20 kilograms of mangoes to the market.

3. **Remaining Mangoes After Market Sale:**
   To find out how many kilograms of mangoes Colby has left after selling to the market, we subtract the kilograms sold to the market from the total harvested:
   \[
   60 \text{ kg} - 20 \text{ kg} = 40 \text{ kg}
   \]

4. **Mangoes Sold to the Community:**
   Colby sold half of the remaining mangoes to his community. Since he has 40 kilograms left, half of this amount is:
   \[
   \frac{40 \text{ kg}}{2} = 20 \text{ kg}
   \]

5. **Remaining Mangoes After Community Sale:**
   After selling half of the remaining mangoes to the community, Colby has:
   \[
   40 \text{ kg} - 20 \text{ kg} = 20 \text{ kg}
   \]
   left.

6. **Converting Kilograms to Mangoes:**
   We know that each kilogram contains 8 mangoes. Therefore, to find out how many mangoes Colby still has, we multiply the remaining kilograms by the number of mangoes per kilogram:
   \[
   20 \text{ kg} \times 8 \text{ mangoes/kg} = 160 \text{ mangoes}
   \]

Thus, Colby still has 160 mangoes remaining.

**Final Answer:**
Colby still has 160 mangoes.
