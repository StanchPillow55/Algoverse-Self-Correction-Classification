==================================================

To solve the problem, we will follow these steps:

1. **Determine the total mangoes harvested in kilograms.**
   Colby harvested a total of 60 kilograms of mangoes.

2. **Calculate how many kilograms he sold to the market.**
   Colby sold 20 kilograms to the market.

3. **Calculate the remaining mangoes after selling to the market.**
   To find out how many kilograms of mangoes Colby has left after selling to the market, we subtract the amount sold from the total harvested:
   \[
   \text{Remaining mangoes} = \text{Total harvested} - \text{Sold to market}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Remaining mangoes} = 60 \text{ kg} - 20 \text{ kg} = 40 \text{ kg}
   \]

4. **Determine how many kilograms he sold to his community.**
   Colby sold the remaining half of the mangoes to his community. Since he has 40 kilograms left, we calculate half of that:
   \[
   \text{Sold to community} = \frac{40 \text{ kg}}{2} = 20 \text{ kg}
   \]

5. **Calculate how many kilograms of mangoes Colby has left after selling to the community.**
   Now we subtract the amount sold to the community from the remaining mangoes:
   \[
   \text{Mangoes left} = \text{Remaining mangoes} - \text{Sold to community}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Mangoes left} = 40 \text{ kg} - 20 \text{ kg} = 20 \text{ kg}
   \]

6. **Convert the remaining kilograms of mangoes to the number of mangoes.**
   Each kilogram contains 8 mangoes. Therefore, to find the total number of mangoes Colby has left, we multiply the remaining kilograms by the number of mangoes per kilogram:
   \[
   \text{Total mangoes left} = \text{Mangoes left in kg} \times \text{Mangoes per kg}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total mangoes left} = 20 \text{ kg} \times 8 \text{ mangoes/kg} = 160 \text{ mangoes}
   \]

Finally, the total number of mangoes Colby still has is:
\[
\boxed{160}
\]
