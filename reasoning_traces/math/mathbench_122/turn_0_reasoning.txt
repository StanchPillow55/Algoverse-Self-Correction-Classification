==================================================

To solve the problem, we first need to understand what "Sample math problem 122" refers to. Since no specific details about the problem are provided, I'll create a sample math problem labeled as "122" and solve it step by step.

**Sample Math Problem 122:**

Calculate the area of a triangle with vertices at the points \( A(1, 2) \), \( B(4, 6) \), and \( C(7, 2) \).

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   We need to find the area of a triangle given the coordinates of its vertices. The vertices are \( A(1, 2) \), \( B(4, 6) \), and \( C(7, 2) \).

2. **Formula for the Area of a Triangle:**
   The area \( A \) of a triangle with vertices at \( (x_1, y_1) \), \( (x_2, y_2) \), and \( (x_3, y_3) \) can be calculated using the formula:
   \[
   A = \frac{1}{2} \left| x_1(y_2-y_3) + x_2(y_3-y_1) + x_3(y_1-y_2) \right|
   \]

3. **Substitute the Coordinates:**
   For our triangle, the coordinates are:
   - \( (x_1, y_1) = (1, 2) \)
   - \( (x_2, y_2) = (4, 6) \)
   - \( (x_3, y_3) = (7, 2) \)

   Substitute these into the formula:
   \[
   A = \frac{1}{2} \left| 1(6-2) + 4(2-2) + 7(2-6) \right|
   \]

4. **Calculate Each Term:**
   - First term: \( 1(6-2) = 1 \times 4 = 4 \)
   - Second term: \( 4(2-2) = 4 \times 0 = 0 \)
   - Third term: \( 7(2-6) = 7 \times (-4) = -28 \)

5. **Combine the Terms:**
   \[
   A = \frac{1}{2} \left| 4 + 0 - 28 \right| = \frac{1}{2} \left| 4 - 28 \right| = \frac{1}{2} \left| -24 \right|
   \]

6. **Calculate the Absolute Value:**
   \[
   \left| -24 \right| = 24
   \]

7. **Calculate the Area:**
   \[
   A = \frac{1}{2} \times 24 = 12
   \]

**Final Answer:**

The area of the triangle with vertices at \( A(1, 2) \), \( B(4, 6) \), and \( C(7, 2) \) is \( 12 \) square units.
