==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 122," we first need to understand what the problem is asking. However, since "Sample math problem 122" is not a specific problem statement, I'll create a hypothetical math problem and solve it step by step.

Let's assume the problem is as follows:

**Problem:**
Solve for \( x \) in the equation:
\[ 3x + 5 = 2x + 9 \]

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Identify the Equation:**
   We start with the equation:
   \[
   3x + 5 = 2x + 9
   \]

2. **Isolate the Variable:**
   Our goal is to solve for \( x \). To do this, we need to get all terms containing \( x \) on one side of the equation and constant terms on the other side.

3. **Subtract \( 2x \) from Both Sides:**
   By subtracting \( 2x \) from both sides, we move all terms involving \( x \) to one side:
   \[
   3x + 5 - 2x = 2x + 9 - 2x
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   x + 5 = 9
   \]

4. **Subtract 5 from Both Sides:**
   Next, we subtract 5 from both sides to isolate \( x \):
   \[
   x + 5 - 5 = 9 - 5
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   x = 4
   \]

5. **Verify the Solution:**
   To ensure our solution is correct, we substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation:
   \[
   3(4) + 5 = 2(4) + 9
   \]
   Simplifying both sides:
   \[
   12 + 5 = 8 + 9
   \]
   \[
   17 = 17
   \]
   Since both sides of the equation are equal, our solution is verified.

**Final Answer:**
The solution to the equation \( 3x + 5 = 2x + 9 \) is \( x = 4 \).
