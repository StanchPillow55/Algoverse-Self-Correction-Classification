Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we first need to understand what "Sample math problem 122" entails. Since the problem is not explicitly stated, I'll create a hypothetical math problem labeled as "Sample math problem 122" and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem 122:**
"Calculate the sum of the first 122 positive integers."

To solve this problem, we can use the formula for the sum of the first \( n \) positive integers, which is given by:

\[
S = \frac{n(n + 1)}{2}
\]

where \( S \) is the sum and \( n \) is the number of terms.

**Step-by-step Solution:**

1. **Identify \( n \):**  
   In this problem, \( n = 122 \).

2. **Substitute \( n \) into the formula:**  
   \[
   S = \frac{122(122 + 1)}{2}
   \]

3. **Calculate \( 122 + 1 \):**  
   \[
   122 + 1 = 123
   \]

4. **Substitute back into the formula:**  
   \[
   S = \frac{122 \times 123}{2}
   \]

5. **Calculate \( 122 \times 123 \):**  
   To multiply these numbers, we can break it down:
   \[
   122 \times 123 = 122 \times (100 + 20 + 3)
   \]
   \[
   = 122 \times 100 + 122 \times 20 + 122 \times 3
   \]
   \[
   = 12200 + 2440 + 366
   \]
   \[
   = 15006
   \]

6. **Divide by 2 to find the sum:**  
   \[
   S = \frac{15006}{2} = 7503
   \]

**Final Answer:**

The sum of the first 122 positive integers is \( 7503 \).

This completes the solution to the hypothetical "Sample math problem 122."
