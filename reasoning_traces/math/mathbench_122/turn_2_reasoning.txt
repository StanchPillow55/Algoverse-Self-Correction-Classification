==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 122," we need to first understand what the problem is asking. Since "Sample math problem 122" is not a specific question, I'll assume it's a placeholder for a typical math problem. Let's create a sample problem and solve it step by step.

**Sample Math Problem 122:**

*Problem Statement:*

A rectangle has a length that is 3 times its width. If the perimeter of the rectangle is 48 units, find the dimensions of the rectangle.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**

   We need to find the dimensions (length and width) of a rectangle given that the length is 3 times the width and the perimeter is 48 units.

2. **Define Variables:**

   Let \( w \) be the width of the rectangle.
   
   Then the length \( l \) is \( 3w \).

3. **Write the Perimeter Formula:**

   The formula for the perimeter \( P \) of a rectangle is:
   \[
   P = 2l + 2w
   \]

4. **Substitute Known Values:**

   We know the perimeter \( P = 48 \) units, and \( l = 3w \). Substitute these into the perimeter formula:
   \[
   48 = 2(3w) + 2w
   \]

5. **Simplify and Solve for \( w \):**

   Simplify the equation:
   \[
   48 = 6w + 2w
   \]
   \[
   48 = 8w
   \]

   Divide both sides by 8 to solve for \( w \):
   \[
   w = \frac{48}{8} = 6
   \]

6. **Find the Length \( l \):**

   Since \( l = 3w \), substitute \( w = 6 \) into the equation for \( l \):
   \[
   l = 3 \times 6 = 18
   \]

7. **Verify the Solution:**

   Check that the dimensions satisfy the perimeter condition:
   \[
   P = 2l + 2w = 2(18) + 2(6) = 36 + 12 = 48
   \]

   The calculated perimeter matches the given perimeter, confirming our solution is correct.

**Final Answer:**

The dimensions of the rectangle are:
- Width: 6 units
- Length: 18 units
