Question ID: 940
Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To find the total number of children participating in the mass drills, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the number of children in one row**: 
   Each row consists of 8 children.

2. **Determine the number of rows per school**: 
   There are 7 rows for each school.

3. **Calculate the total number of children per school**:
   To find the total number of children in one school, we multiply the number of rows by the number of children per row:
   \[
   \text{Total children per school} = \text{Number of rows} \times \text{Number of children per row} = 7 \times 8
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total children per school} = 56
   \]

4. **Determine the number of schools**: 
   There are 5 different schools participating in the drill.

5. **Calculate the total number of children for all schools**:
   To find the total number of children in all schools, we multiply the total number of children per school by the number of schools:
   \[
   \text{Total children for all schools} = \text{Total children per school} \times \text{Number of schools} = 56 \times 5
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total children for all schools} = 280
   \]

Thus, the total number of children that can be in the drill is \( \boxed{280} \).
