==================================================

It seems like you've referenced "Sample reasoning question 19," but I don't have access to specific documents or questions labeled in that way. However, I can guide you through a general approach to solving math problems by demonstrating a step-by-step method. If you have a specific math problem in mind, please provide the details, and I'll be happy to help.

For now, let's consider a generic math problem and solve it step-by-step:

**Problem:**
Solve for \( x \) in the equation: \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We need to find the value of \( x \) that makes the equation true.

2. **Isolate the Variable:**
   - The equation is \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).
   - Our goal is to get \( x \) by itself on one side of the equation.

3. **Subtract 3 from Both Sides:**
   - To isolate the term with \( x \), subtract 3 from both sides of the equation:
   \[
   2x + 3 - 3 = 11 - 3
   \]
   - Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   2x = 8
   \]

4. **Divide Both Sides by 2:**
   - Now, divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( x \):
   \[
   \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{8}{2}
   \]
   - Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   x = 4
   \]

5. **Check the Solution:**
   - Substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation to verify:
   \[
   2(4) + 3 = 11
   \]
   - Simplifying the left side:
   \[
   8 + 3 = 11
   \]
   - Since both sides are equal, our solution is correct.

**Final Answer:**
The solution to the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \) is \( x = 4 \).

If you have a specific problem or a different type of question in mind, please provide the details, and I'll be glad to assist you further!
