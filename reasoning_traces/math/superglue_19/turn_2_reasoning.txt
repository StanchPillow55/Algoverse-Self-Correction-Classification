==================================================

To solve the problem effectively, let's first understand what "Sample reasoning question 19" might entail. Since the problem statement is not explicitly provided, I'll assume a generic math problem-solving approach and demonstrate how to tackle a typical reasoning question. 

Let's consider a hypothetical math problem:

**Problem:**
A farmer has a rectangular field that is 100 meters long and 60 meters wide. He wants to divide the field into smaller rectangular plots, each with an area of 150 square meters. How many such plots can he create?

**Step-by-step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We have a rectangular field with dimensions 100 meters by 60 meters.
   - We need to divide this field into smaller plots, each with an area of 150 square meters.

2. **Calculate the Total Area of the Field:**
   - The area of the field is calculated by multiplying its length by its width.
   \[
   \text{Area of the field} = 100 \, \text{meters} \times 60 \, \text{meters} = 6000 \, \text{square meters}
   \]

3. **Determine the Number of Plots:**
   - Each plot has an area of 150 square meters.
   - To find the number of plots, divide the total area of the field by the area of one plot.
   \[
   \text{Number of plots} = \frac{\text{Total area of the field}}{\text{Area of one plot}} = \frac{6000 \, \text{square meters}}{150 \, \text{square meters}}
   \]

4. **Perform the Division:**
   \[
   \frac{6000}{150} = 40
   \]

5. **Verify the Calculation:**
   - Multiply the number of plots by the area of one plot to ensure it equals the total area.
   \[
   40 \, \text{plots} \times 150 \, \text{square meters/plot} = 6000 \, \text{square meters}
   \]
   - The calculation is correct.

6. **Conclusion:**
   - The farmer can create 40 plots, each with an area of 150 square meters.

**Final Answer:**
The farmer can create 40 plots.
