==================================================

To solve the problem effectively, I need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 19" entails. Since I don't have the specific details of this question, I'll demonstrate a general approach to solving a typical math problem by breaking down the steps involved in reasoning through a problem.

Let's assume a hypothetical math problem for demonstration purposes:

**Problem:**  
A train travels from City A to City B at a speed of 60 miles per hour. The distance between the two cities is 180 miles. How long does it take for the train to travel from City A to City B?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We need to find the time it takes for the train to travel a certain distance at a given speed.
   - The formula to calculate time when distance and speed are known is:
     \[
     \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}}
     \]

2. **Identify the Given Information:**
   - Distance between City A and City B = 180 miles
   - Speed of the train = 60 miles per hour

3. **Apply the Formula:**
   - Substitute the given values into the formula:
     \[
     \text{Time} = \frac{180 \text{ miles}}{60 \text{ miles per hour}}
     \]

4. **Perform the Calculation:**
   - Divide 180 by 60:
     \[
     \text{Time} = 3 \text{ hours}
     \]

5. **Verify the Solution:**
   - Check if the units are consistent and the calculation makes sense.
   - The units of miles cancel out, leaving us with hours, which is the correct unit for time.

6. **State the Final Answer:**
   - It takes the train 3 hours to travel from City A to City B.

By following these steps, we ensure that we understand the problem, apply the correct formula, perform accurate calculations, and verify our solution. This systematic approach can be applied to a wide range of math problems to arrive at the correct answer.
