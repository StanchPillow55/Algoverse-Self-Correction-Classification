Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem effectively, I need to understand the context and details of "Sample reasoning question 19." However, since the problem statement is not provided, I will demonstrate a general approach to solving a typical math reasoning problem. 

Let's assume a hypothetical problem for demonstration:

**Problem:**  
A train travels from City A to City B at a speed of 60 miles per hour. The distance between City A and City B is 180 miles. How long does the journey take?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We need to find the time it takes for the train to travel from City A to City B.
   - We know the speed of the train and the distance it needs to cover.

2. **Identify the Formula:**
   - The formula to calculate time when distance and speed are known is:
     \[
     \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}}
     \]

3. **Substitute the Known Values:**
   - Distance = 180 miles
   - Speed = 60 miles per hour
   - Substitute these values into the formula:
     \[
     \text{Time} = \frac{180 \text{ miles}}{60 \text{ miles per hour}}
     \]

4. **Perform the Calculation:**
   - Divide 180 by 60:
     \[
     \text{Time} = 3 \text{ hours}
     \]

5. **Verify the Solution:**
   - To ensure the calculation is correct, consider the units:
     - The units of distance (miles) divided by the units of speed (miles per hour) result in hours, which is a unit of time.
   - Recalculate if necessary to confirm the result.

6. **State the Final Answer:**
   - The journey from City A to City B takes 3 hours.

This structured approach can be applied to a wide range of math reasoning problems. If you have a specific problem in mind, please provide the details, and I can work through that particular problem.
