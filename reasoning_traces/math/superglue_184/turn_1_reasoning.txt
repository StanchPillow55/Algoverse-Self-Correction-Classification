==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 184" refers to. However, since the problem statement is not provided, I'll demonstrate a general approach to solving a typical math reasoning problem. Let's assume a hypothetical problem and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**

A farmer has a rectangular field that is 100 meters long and 60 meters wide. He wants to divide the field into two equal parts by constructing a fence parallel to the shorter side. Calculate the length of the fence needed and the area of each part.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - The field is rectangular with dimensions 100 meters (length) and 60 meters (width).
   - We need to divide the field into two equal parts with a fence parallel to the shorter side (width).

2. **Visualize the Problem:**
   - Imagine the rectangle with the longer side (100 meters) as the base.
   - The shorter side (60 meters) is the width.
   - The fence will be parallel to the width, meaning it will run along the length of the field.

3. **Calculate the Length of the Fence:**
   - Since the fence is parallel to the width, it will span the entire length of the field.
   - Therefore, the length of the fence needed is equal to the length of the field.
   - Length of the fence = 100 meters.

4. **Calculate the Area of Each Part:**
   - The total area of the field is given by the formula for the area of a rectangle: Area = Length × Width.
   - Total area = 100 meters × 60 meters = 6000 square meters.
   - Since the field is divided into two equal parts, each part will have half of the total area.
   - Area of each part = Total area / 2 = 6000 square meters / 2 = 3000 square meters.

5. **Verify the Solution:**
   - Check that the dimensions and calculations are consistent with the problem statement.
   - The fence divides the field into two equal areas, each with an area of 3000 square meters, which is correct.

**Final Answer:**
- The length of the fence needed is 100 meters.
- The area of each part of the field is 3000 square meters.

This approach demonstrates how to break down a problem, perform calculations, and verify the solution. If you have a specific problem or more details about "Sample reasoning question 184," please provide them, and I can tailor the solution accordingly.
