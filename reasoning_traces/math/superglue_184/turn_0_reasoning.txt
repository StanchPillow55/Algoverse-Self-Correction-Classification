==================================================

To solve the problem, I need more information about what "Sample reasoning question 184" entails. Since the question is not provided, I'll demonstrate how to approach a generic math problem by working through an example problem.

Example Problem:
Calculate the area of a triangle with a base of 10 units and a height of 5 units.

Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We are asked to find the area of a triangle.
   - The formula for the area of a triangle is: 
     \[
     \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height}
     \]
   - We are given:
     - Base = 10 units
     - Height = 5 units

2. **Substitute the Given Values into the Formula:**
   - Using the formula for the area of a triangle, substitute the given values:
     \[
     \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times 10 \times 5
     \]

3. **Perform the Calculations:**
   - First, multiply the base and the height:
     \[
     10 \times 5 = 50
     \]
   - Next, multiply the result by \(\frac{1}{2}\):
     \[
     \frac{1}{2} \times 50 = 25
     \]

4. **State the Final Answer:**
   - The area of the triangle is 25 square units.

By following these steps, we have calculated the area of the triangle. If you have a specific problem or question in mind, please provide the details, and I can work through that problem for you.
