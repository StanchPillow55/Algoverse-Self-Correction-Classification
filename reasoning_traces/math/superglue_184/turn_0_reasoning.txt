==================================================

To solve this problem, we first need to understand what "Sample reasoning question 184" refers to. Since no specific details or context are provided, I'll assume this is a placeholder for a generic math problem. Let's create a sample math problem and solve it step by step.

**Sample Problem:**

A farmer has a rectangular field that is 100 meters long and 60 meters wide. He wants to divide the field into smaller rectangular plots, each with an area of 150 square meters. How many such plots can he create?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Calculate the Total Area of the Field:**

   The area \( A \) of a rectangle is given by the formula:
   \[
   A = \text{length} \times \text{width}
   \]
   For the farmer's field:
   \[
   A = 100 \, \text{meters} \times 60 \, \text{meters} = 6000 \, \text{square meters}
   \]

2. **Determine the Area of Each Plot:**

   Each plot has an area of 150 square meters.

3. **Calculate the Number of Plots:**

   To find the number of plots, divide the total area of the field by the area of each plot:
   \[
   \text{Number of plots} = \frac{\text{Total area of the field}}{\text{Area of each plot}} = \frac{6000 \, \text{square meters}}{150 \, \text{square meters}}
   \]

4. **Perform the Division:**

   \[
   \frac{6000}{150} = 40
   \]

   Therefore, the farmer can create 40 plots, each with an area of 150 square meters.

**Final Answer:**

The farmer can create 40 plots, each with an area of 150 square meters.
