==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 233," we need to first understand what the problem is asking. However, the problem statement is not provided in your question. Since I don't have the details of "Sample math problem 233," I'll demonstrate how to solve a general math problem by creating a sample problem and solving it step-by-step.

Let's assume "Sample math problem 233" is a problem involving solving a quadratic equation. Here's a sample problem:

**Problem:** Solve the quadratic equation \(2x^2 - 4x - 6 = 0\).

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Identify the quadratic equation:**
   The given quadratic equation is \(2x^2 - 4x - 6 = 0\).

2. **Write the equation in standard form:**
   The standard form of a quadratic equation is \(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\).
   Here, \(a = 2\), \(b = -4\), and \(c = -6\).

3. **Calculate the discriminant:**
   The discriminant \(\Delta\) of a quadratic equation \(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\) is given by \(\Delta = b^2 - 4ac\).
   \[
   \Delta = (-4)^2 - 4 \times 2 \times (-6) = 16 + 48 = 64
   \]

4. **Determine the nature of the roots:**
   Since the discriminant \(\Delta = 64\) is positive, the quadratic equation has two distinct real roots.

5. **Use the quadratic formula to find the roots:**
   The quadratic formula is given by:
   \[
   x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{\Delta}}{2a}
   \]
   Substitute the values of \(a\), \(b\), and \(\Delta\):
   \[
   x = \frac{-(-4) \pm \sqrt{64}}{2 \times 2} = \frac{4 \pm 8}{4}
   \]

6. **Calculate the two roots:**
   - For the positive case (\(+\)):
     \[
     x_1 = \frac{4 + 8}{4} = \frac{12}{4} = 3
     \]
   - For the negative case (\(-\)):
     \[
     x_2 = \frac{4 - 8}{4} = \frac{-4}{4} = -1
     \]

7. **State the final answer:**
   The solutions to the quadratic equation \(2x^2 - 4x - 6 = 0\) are \(x = 3\) and \(x = -1\).

### Final Answer:
The roots of the quadratic equation are \(x = 3\) and \(x = -1\).
