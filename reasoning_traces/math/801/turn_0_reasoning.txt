==================================================

To find out how many trees will be planted at the end of the reforestation campaign at Ashley's school, we will break the problem down into steps.

### Step 1: Calculate the total number of students
The school has 40 classes, and each class has an average of 25 students. Therefore, the total number of students can be calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Total Students} = \text{Number of Classes} \times \text{Average Students per Class}
\]

\[
\text{Total Students} = 40 \times 25 = 1000
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the total number of teachers
Each class has an average of 3 teachers. Therefore, the total number of teachers can be calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Total Teachers} = \text{Number of Classes} \times \text{Average Teachers per Class}
\]

\[
\text{Total Teachers} = 40 \times 3 = 120
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the total number of trees planted by students
Each student plants 1 tree. Therefore, the total number of trees planted by students is equal to the total number of students:

\[
\text{Trees by Students} = \text{Total Students} \times 1 = 1000 \times 1 = 1000
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the total number of trees planted by teachers
Each teacher plants 2 trees. Therefore, the total number of trees planted by teachers can be calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Trees by Teachers} = \text{Total Teachers} \times 2
\]

\[
\text{Trees by Teachers} = 120 \times 2 = 240
\]

### Step 5: Calculate the total number of trees planted
To find the total number of trees planted, we add the number of trees planted by students and the number of trees planted by teachers:

\[
\text{Total Trees} = \text{Trees by Students} + \text{Trees by Teachers}
\]

\[
\text{Total Trees} = 1000 + 240 = 1240
\]

### Final Answer
At the end of the campaign, the total number of trees planted will be:

\[
\boxed{1240}
\]
