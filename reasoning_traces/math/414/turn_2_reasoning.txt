Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine the total amount of caffeine John consumed from the energy drinks and the caffeine pill. Let's break it down step by step.

### Step 1: Calculate the caffeine in the first energy drink
- The first energy drink is 12 ounces and contains 250 grams of caffeine.
- Therefore, the caffeine content in the first drink is 250 grams.

### Step 2: Calculate the caffeine per ounce in the second energy drink
- The second drink is 3 times more caffeinated per ounce than the first drink.
- First, we need to find the caffeine content per ounce in the first drink:
  \[
  \text{Caffeine per ounce in the first drink} = \frac{250 \text{ grams}}{12 \text{ ounces}} \approx 20.83 \text{ grams per ounce}
  \]
- The second drink is 3 times more caffeinated per ounce:
  \[
  \text{Caffeine per ounce in the second drink} = 3 \times 20.83 \approx 62.49 \text{ grams per ounce}
  \]

### Step 3: Calculate the total caffeine in the second energy drink
- The second drink is 2 ounces:
  \[
  \text{Total caffeine in the second drink} = 62.49 \text{ grams per ounce} \times 2 \text{ ounces} = 124.98 \text{ grams}
  \]

### Step 4: Calculate the total caffeine from both drinks
- Add the caffeine from both drinks:
  \[
  \text{Total caffeine from drinks} = 250 \text{ grams} + 124.98 \text{ grams} = 374.98 \text{ grams}
  \]

### Step 5: Calculate the caffeine in the caffeine pill
- The caffeine pill contains as much caffeine as the two drinks combined, which is 374.98 grams.

### Step 6: Calculate the total caffeine consumed
- John consumed caffeine from both the drinks and the pill:
  \[
  \text{Total caffeine consumed} = 374.98 \text{ grams (from drinks)} + 374.98 \text{ grams (from pill)} = 749.96 \text{ grams}
  \]

### Final Answer
John consumed a total of 749.96 grams of caffeine.
