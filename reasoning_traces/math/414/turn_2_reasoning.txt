Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of caffeine John consumed from the two energy drinks and the caffeine pill. Let's break it down step by step.

### Step 1: Calculate the caffeine content of the first drink

The first drink is a 12-ounce drink with a total of 250 grams of caffeine. Therefore, the caffeine content per ounce for this drink is:

\[
\text{Caffeine per ounce} = \frac{250 \text{ grams}}{12 \text{ ounces}} \approx 20.83 \text{ grams per ounce}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the caffeine content of the second drink

The second drink is 3 times more caffeinated per ounce than the first drink. So, the caffeine content per ounce for the second drink is:

\[
\text{Caffeine per ounce of second drink} = 3 \times 20.83 \approx 62.49 \text{ grams per ounce}
\]

The second drink is 2 ounces, so the total caffeine content in the second drink is:

\[
\text{Total caffeine in second drink} = 62.49 \times 2 \approx 124.98 \text{ grams}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the total caffeine from both drinks

Now, we add the caffeine content from both drinks:

\[
\text{Total caffeine from both drinks} = 250 + 124.98 = 374.98 \text{ grams}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the caffeine content of the pill

The caffeine pill contains as much caffeine as the two drinks combined. Therefore, the caffeine content of the pill is:

\[
\text{Caffeine in pill} = 374.98 \text{ grams}
\]

### Step 5: Calculate the total caffeine consumed

Finally, we add the caffeine from both drinks and the pill to find the total caffeine consumption:

\[
\text{Total caffeine consumed} = 374.98 + 374.98 = 749.96 \text{ grams}
\]

### Final Answer

John consumed a total of approximately 749.96 grams of caffeine.
