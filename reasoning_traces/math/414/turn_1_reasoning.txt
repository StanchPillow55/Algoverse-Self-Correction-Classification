==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of caffeine John consumes from both energy drinks and the caffeine pill. Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Step 1: Calculate the caffeine content of the first drink.
- The first drink is a 12-ounce drink with 250 grams of caffeine.
- Therefore, the caffeine content of the first drink is 250 grams.

### Step 2: Calculate the caffeine content per ounce of the second drink.
- The second drink is 3 times more caffeinated per ounce than the first drink.
- First, we need to find the caffeine content per ounce of the first drink:
  \[
  \text{Caffeine per ounce of first drink} = \frac{250 \text{ grams}}{12 \text{ ounces}} \approx 20.83 \text{ grams per ounce}
  \]
- The second drink is 3 times more caffeinated per ounce:
  \[
  \text{Caffeine per ounce of second drink} = 3 \times 20.83 \approx 62.49 \text{ grams per ounce}
  \]

### Step 3: Calculate the total caffeine content of the second drink.
- The second drink is 2 ounces.
- Therefore, the caffeine content of the second drink is:
  \[
  \text{Total caffeine in second drink} = 62.49 \times 2 \approx 124.98 \text{ grams}
  \]

### Step 4: Calculate the total caffeine content from both drinks.
- Add the caffeine content from both drinks:
  \[
  \text{Total caffeine from both drinks} = 250 + 124.98 = 374.98 \text{ grams}
  \]

### Step 5: Calculate the caffeine content of the caffeine pill.
- The caffeine pill has as much caffeine as the two drinks combined.
- Therefore, the caffeine content of the pill is 374.98 grams.

### Step 6: Calculate the total caffeine John consumed.
- Add the caffeine from both drinks and the pill:
  \[
  \text{Total caffeine consumed} = 374.98 + 374.98 = 749.96 \text{ grams}
  \]

### Final Answer:
John consumed a total of 749.96 grams of caffeine.
