==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of caffeine John consumed from both energy drinks and the caffeine pill. Let's break it down step by step.

### Step 1: Calculate the caffeine content of the first drink
The first energy drink is a 12-ounce drink with 250 grams of caffeine. This means the caffeine content per ounce is:

\[
\text{Caffeine per ounce in first drink} = \frac{250 \text{ grams}}{12 \text{ ounces}} \approx 20.83 \text{ grams per ounce}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the caffeine content of the second drink
The second drink is 3 times more caffeinated per ounce than the first drink and is 2 ounces in size. First, we find the caffeine content per ounce for the second drink:

\[
\text{Caffeine per ounce in second drink} = 3 \times 20.83 \approx 62.49 \text{ grams per ounce}
\]

Now, calculate the total caffeine content of the second drink:

\[
\text{Total caffeine in second drink} = 62.49 \text{ grams per ounce} \times 2 \text{ ounces} = 124.98 \text{ grams}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the total caffeine from both drinks
Add the caffeine content from both drinks:

\[
\text{Total caffeine from both drinks} = 250 \text{ grams} + 124.98 \text{ grams} = 374.98 \text{ grams}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the caffeine content of the pill
The caffeine pill contains as much caffeine as the two drinks combined, which is 374.98 grams.

### Step 5: Calculate the total caffeine consumed
Finally, add the caffeine from the drinks and the pill to find the total caffeine consumed:

\[
\text{Total caffeine consumed} = 374.98 \text{ grams (from drinks)} + 374.98 \text{ grams (from pill)} = 749.96 \text{ grams}
\]

### Final Answer
John consumed a total of 749.96 grams of caffeine.
