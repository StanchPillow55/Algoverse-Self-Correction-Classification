To solve this problem, we need to determine the total amount of caffeine John consumes from both energy drinks and the caffeine pill. Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Calculate the caffeine content of the first drink:**
   - The first drink is a 12-ounce drink with a total of 250 grams of caffeine.
   - Therefore, the caffeine content from the first drink is 250 grams.

2. **Determine the caffeine concentration per ounce for the second drink:**
   - The second drink is 3 times more caffeinated per ounce than the first drink.
   - First, we need to find the caffeine concentration per ounce for the first drink:
     \[
     \text{Caffeine per ounce in the first drink} = \frac{250 \text{ grams}}{12 \text{ ounces}} \approx 20.83 \text{ grams per ounce}
     \]
   - The second drink is 3 times more caffeinated per ounce:
     \[
     \text{Caffeine per ounce in the second drink} = 3 \times 20.83 \approx 62.49 \text{ grams per ounce}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total caffeine content of the second drink:**
   - The second drink is 2 ounces with a caffeine concentration of approximately 62.49 grams per ounce:
     \[
     \text{Total caffeine in the second drink} = 62.49 \times 2 \approx 124.98 \text{ grams}
     \]

4. **Calculate the total caffeine from both drinks:**
   - Add the caffeine content from both drinks:
     \[
     \text{Total caffeine from both drinks} = 250 + 124.98 = 374.98 \text{ grams}
     \]

5. **Determine the caffeine content of the caffeine pill:**
   - The caffeine pill contains as much caffeine as both drinks combined, which is 374.98 grams.

6. **Calculate the total caffeine consumed:**
   - John consumes caffeine from both drinks and the caffeine pill:
     \[
     \text{Total caffeine consumed} = 374.98 + 374.98 = 749.96 \text{ grams}
     \]

Therefore, the total amount of caffeine John consumed is approximately 749.96 grams.

**Final Answer:**
John consumed approximately 749.96 grams of caffeine.
