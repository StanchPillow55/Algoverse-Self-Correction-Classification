To find out how much caffeine John consumed, we need to calculate the caffeine content from each of the drinks and the caffeine pill he took. Let's break it down step by step.

### Step 1: Calculate the caffeine in the first drink
The first drink is a 12-ounce drink with 250 grams of caffeine. 

- Caffeine from the first drink: 
  \[
  \text{Caffeine from first drink} = 250 \text{ grams}
  \]

### Step 2: Calculate the caffeine in the second drink
The second drink is 2 ounces and is 3 times more caffeinated per ounce than the first drink. 

First, we need to find the caffeine concentration per ounce in the first drink:
- Caffeine concentration in the first drink:
  \[
  \text{Caffeine per ounce} = \frac{250 \text{ grams}}{12 \text{ ounces}} \approx 20.83 \text{ grams/ounce}
  \]

Now, since the second drink is 3 times more caffeinated per ounce:
- Caffeine concentration in the second drink:
  \[
  \text{Caffeine per ounce in second drink} = 3 \times 20.83 \text{ grams/ounce} \approx 62.5 \text{ grams/ounce}
  \]

Now, we calculate the total caffeine in the second drink:
- Caffeine from the second drink:
  \[
  \text{Caffeine from second drink} = 62.5 \text{ grams/ounce} \times 2 \text{ ounces} = 125 \text{ grams}
  \]

### Step 3: Calculate the total caffeine from both drinks
Now we can find the total caffeine from both drinks:
\[
\text{Total caffeine from drinks} = \text{Caffeine from first drink} + \text{Caffeine from second drink}
\]
\[
\text{Total caffeine from drinks} = 250 \text{ grams} + 125 \text{ grams} = 375 \text{ grams}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the caffeine from the caffeine pill
John then takes a caffeine pill that has as much caffeine as his two drinks combined. Therefore, the caffeine from the pill is:
\[
\text{Caffeine from pill} = 375 \text{ grams}
\]

### Step 5: Calculate the total caffeine consumed
Finally, we add the caffeine from the drinks and the pill:
\[
\text{Total caffeine consumed} = \text{Total caffeine from drinks} + \text{Caffeine from pill}
\]
\[
\text{Total caffeine consumed} = 375 \text{ grams} + 375 \text{ grams} = 750 \text{ grams}
\]

### Final Answer
John consumed a total of **750 grams of caffeine**.
