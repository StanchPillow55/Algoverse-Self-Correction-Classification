Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine the total amount of time James spent watching TV and then convert that time from minutes to hours.

1. **Determine the duration of each type of episode:**
   - Each episode of Jeopardy is 20 minutes long.
   - Each episode of Wheel of Fortune is twice as long as a Jeopardy episode. Therefore, each Wheel of Fortune episode is \(2 \times 20 = 40\) minutes long.

2. **Calculate the total time spent watching Jeopardy:**
   - James watched 2 episodes of Jeopardy.
   - Total time for Jeopardy = \(2 \times 20 = 40\) minutes.

3. **Calculate the total time spent watching Wheel of Fortune:**
   - James watched 2 episodes of Wheel of Fortune.
   - Total time for Wheel of Fortune = \(2 \times 40 = 80\) minutes.

4. **Calculate the total time spent watching TV:**
   - Total time = Time spent on Jeopardy + Time spent on Wheel of Fortune
   - Total time = \(40 + 80 = 120\) minutes.

5. **Convert the total time from minutes to hours:**
   - There are 60 minutes in an hour.
   - Total time in hours = \(\frac{120}{60} = 2\) hours.

Therefore, James watched TV for a total of 2 hours.

**Final Answer: James watched TV for 2 hours.**
