To determine how many hours James watched TV, we need to calculate the total time he spent watching both shows.

1. **Calculate the duration of Jeopardy episodes:**
   - Each episode of Jeopardy is 20 minutes long.
   - James watched 2 episodes of Jeopardy.
   - Total time for Jeopardy:
     \[
     \text{Total time for Jeopardy} = 2 \text{ episodes} \times 20 \text{ minutes/episode} = 40 \text{ minutes}
     \]

2. **Calculate the duration of Wheel of Fortune episodes:**
   - Each episode of Wheel of Fortune is twice as long as an episode of Jeopardy.
   - Therefore, the duration of one episode of Wheel of Fortune is:
     \[
     \text{Duration of Wheel of Fortune} = 2 \times 20 \text{ minutes} = 40 \text{ minutes}
     \]
   - James watched 2 episodes of Wheel of Fortune.
   - Total time for Wheel of Fortune:
     \[
     \text{Total time for Wheel of Fortune} = 2 \text{ episodes} \times 40 \text{ minutes/episode} = 80 \text{ minutes}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total time spent watching TV:**
   - Now, we add the total time spent on both shows:
     \[
     \text{Total time} = \text{Total time for Jeopardy} + \text{Total time for Wheel of Fortune}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total time} = 40 \text{ minutes} + 80 \text{ minutes} = 120 \text{ minutes}
     \]

4. **Convert the total time from minutes to hours:**
   - There are 60 minutes in an hour, so we convert 120 minutes to hours:
     \[
     \text{Total time in hours} = \frac{120 \text{ minutes}}{60 \text{ minutes/hour}} = 2 \text{ hours}
     \]

Therefore, the total time James watched TV is **2 hours**.

Final answer:
\[
\boxed{2 \text{ hours}}
\]
