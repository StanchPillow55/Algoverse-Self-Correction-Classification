==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to determine how many blue and red shoeboxes Tim has left after he uses some of them for fishing.

1. **Initial Count of Shoe Boxes:**
   - Blue shoeboxes: 7
   - Red shoeboxes: 9

2. **Shoe Boxes Used for Fishing:**
   - Tim uses 3 blue shoeboxes.
   - He also uses \( \frac{1}{3} \) of his red shoeboxes.

3. **Calculating the Number of Red Shoe Boxes Used:**
   - To find out how many red shoeboxes Tim uses, we calculate \( \frac{1}{3} \) of the total red shoeboxes he has:
     \[
     \text{Red shoeboxes used} = \frac{1}{3} \times 9 = 3
     \]

4. **Calculating Remaining Shoe Boxes:**
   - Now we subtract the used shoeboxes from the initial counts.
   - Remaining blue shoeboxes:
     \[
     \text{Remaining blue shoeboxes} = 7 - 3 = 4
     \]
   - Remaining red shoeboxes:
     \[
     \text{Remaining red shoeboxes} = 9 - 3 = 6
     \]

5. **Final Count of Shoe Boxes:**
   - After Tim goes fishing, he has:
     - Blue shoeboxes left: 4
     - Red shoeboxes left: 6

Thus, the final answer is:
- Blue shoeboxes left: 4
- Red shoeboxes left: 6

Final answer:
- Tim has 4 blue shoeboxes and 6 red shoeboxes left.
