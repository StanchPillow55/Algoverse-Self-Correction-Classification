Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to determine how many blue and red shoeboxes Tim has left after he uses some of them for fishing.

1. **Initial Count of Shoe Boxes**:
   - Blue shoeboxes: 7
   - Red shoeboxes: 9

2. **Shoe Boxes Used for Fishing**:
   - Tim uses 3 blue shoeboxes.
   - He also uses 1/3 of his red shoeboxes. 

   To find out how many red shoeboxes he uses, we calculate:
   \[
   \text{Red shoeboxes used} = \frac{1}{3} \times \text{Total red shoeboxes} = \frac{1}{3} \times 9 = 3
   \]

3. **Calculating Remaining Shoe Boxes**:
   - **Remaining Blue Shoeboxes**:
     \[
     \text{Remaining blue shoeboxes} = \text{Initial blue shoeboxes} - \text{Blue shoeboxes used} = 7 - 3 = 4
     \]

   - **Remaining Red Shoeboxes**:
     \[
     \text{Remaining red shoeboxes} = \text{Initial red shoeboxes} - \text{Red shoeboxes used} = 9 - 3 = 6
     \]

4. **Final Count of Shoe Boxes**:
   - Remaining blue shoeboxes: 4
   - Remaining red shoeboxes: 6

5. **Final Answer**:
   - Tim has 4 blue shoeboxes and 6 red shoeboxes left in his box.

Thus, the final answer is:
- **Blue shoeboxes left**: 4
- **Red shoeboxes left**: 6
