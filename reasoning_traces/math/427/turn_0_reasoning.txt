==================================================

To find out how much money Sheila will have in her piggy bank at the end of 4 years, we need to consider her current savings, her monthly contributions, and the amount added by her family.

1. **Current Savings**: Sheila has already saved $3,000.

2. **Monthly Contributions**: Sheila plans to save $276 per month for 4 years. We first need to calculate how many months are in 4 years:
   \[
   4 \text{ years} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 48 \text{ months}
   \]

3. **Total Contributions Over 4 Years**: Now, we can calculate the total amount Sheila will save over these 48 months:
   \[
   276 \text{ dollars/month} \times 48 \text{ months} = 13,248 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Family Contribution**: Sheila's family added $7,000 to her piggy bank.

5. **Total Amount in the Piggy Bank**: Now we can sum all the contributions to find the total amount in the piggy bank at the end of 4 years:
   \[
   \text{Total Amount} = \text{Current Savings} + \text{Total Contributions} + \text{Family Contribution}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total Amount} = 3,000 + 13,248 + 7,000
   \]

6. **Calculating the Total**:
   \[
   3,000 + 13,248 = 16,248
   \]
   \[
   16,248 + 7,000 = 23,248
   \]

Thus, at the end of 4 years, Sheila will have a total of **$23,248** in her piggy bank.

**Final Answer**: $23,248
