==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of money Sheila will have in her piggy bank at the end of 4 years, considering her current savings, her monthly savings plan, and the additional contribution from her family.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Savings:**
   Sheila has already saved $3,000.

2. **Family Contribution:**
   Sheilaâ€™s family added $7,000 to her piggy bank.

3. **Monthly Savings:**
   Sheila plans to save $276 per month for 4 years.

4. **Calculate Total Monthly Savings Over 4 Years:**
   - There are 12 months in a year, so over 4 years, there are:
     \[
     4 \times 12 = 48 \text{ months}
     \]
   - Sheila saves $276 per month, so over 48 months, she will save:
     \[
     276 \times 48 = 13,248
     \]

5. **Calculate Total Savings:**
   - Combine Sheila's initial savings, her family's contribution, and her total monthly savings:
     \[
     3,000 + 7,000 + 13,248 = 23,248
     \]

Thus, at the end of 4 years, Sheila will have $23,248 in her piggy bank.

**Final Answer:**
Sheila will have $23,248 in her piggy bank at the end of 4 years.
