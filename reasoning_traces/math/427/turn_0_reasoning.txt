To solve the problem, we need to determine how many Pokemon cards Kenny started with based on the information given.

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - Kenny wants to buy a ticket to an amusement park that costs $100.
   - He plans to sell his Pokemon cards for $1.5 each.
   - He keeps 1/3 of his cards and sells the remaining 2/3.
   - After selling the cards, he wants to have enough money for the ticket ($100) and also have $50 left for spending cash.

2. **Setting Up the Equation**:
   - Let \( x \) be the total number of cards Kenny starts with.
   - He keeps \( \frac{1}{3}x \) cards and sells \( \frac{2}{3}x \) cards.
   - The amount of money he makes from selling the cards is:
     \[
     \text{Money from selling cards} = \left(\frac{2}{3}x\right) \times 1.5
     \]
   - We can simplify this:
     \[
     \text{Money from selling cards} = \frac{2}{3}x \times 1.5 = \frac{2 \times 1.5}{3}x = \frac{3}{3}x = x
     \]

3. **Calculating Total Money Needed**:
   - Kenny needs $100 for the ticket and $50 for spending cash, which totals:
     \[
     100 + 50 = 150
     \]

4. **Setting Up the Equation for Total Money**:
   - From selling the cards, he makes \( x \) dollars.
   - We set up the equation:
     \[
     x = 150
     \]

5. **Solving for \( x \)**:
   - From the equation \( x = 150 \), we find that:
     \[
     x = 150
     \]

6. **Conclusion**:
   - Therefore, the total number of Pokemon cards Kenny started with is \( \boxed{150} \).
