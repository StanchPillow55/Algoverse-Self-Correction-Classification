Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of money Sheila will have in her piggy bank at the end of 4 years, considering her current savings, her monthly savings plan, and the additional contribution from her family.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Savings:**
   Sheila has already saved $3,000.

2. **Family Contribution:**
   Sheilaâ€™s family added $7,000 to her piggy bank.

3. **Monthly Savings:**
   Sheila plans to save $276 per month for 4 years.

4. **Calculate the Total Monthly Savings:**
   - First, determine the total number of months in 4 years:
     \[
     4 \text{ years} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 48 \text{ months}
     \]
   - Next, calculate the total amount saved from her monthly savings:
     \[
     276 \text{ dollars/month} \times 48 \text{ months} = 13,248 \text{ dollars}
     \]

5. **Calculate the Total Amount in the Piggy Bank:**
   - Add the initial savings, the family contribution, and the total monthly savings:
     \[
     3,000 \text{ dollars (initial savings)} + 7,000 \text{ dollars (family contribution)} + 13,248 \text{ dollars (monthly savings)} = 23,248 \text{ dollars}
     \]

Therefore, at the end of 4 years, Sheila will have a total of $23,248 in her piggy bank.

**Final Answer: $23,248**
