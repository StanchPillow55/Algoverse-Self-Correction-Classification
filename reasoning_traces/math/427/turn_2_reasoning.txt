Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To determine how much money Sheila will have in her piggy bank at the end of 4 years, we need to consider her initial savings, her monthly savings, and the additional amount her family added. Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Savings:**
   Sheila initially saved $3,000.

2. **Monthly Savings:**
   Sheila plans to save $276 per month for 4 years. First, we need to calculate the total number of months in 4 years:
   \[
   4 \text{ years} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 48 \text{ months}
   \]
   Next, we calculate the total amount saved over these 48 months:
   \[
   276 \text{ dollars/month} \times 48 \text{ months} = 13,248 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Family's Contribution:**
   Sheila’s family added $7,000 to her piggy bank.

4. **Total Savings Calculation:**
   To find the total amount in the piggy bank at the end of 4 years, we add together the initial savings, the total monthly savings, and the family’s contribution:
   \[
   3,000 \text{ dollars (initial savings)} + 13,248 \text{ dollars (monthly savings)} + 7,000 \text{ dollars (family's contribution)} = 23,248 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Therefore, at the end of 4 years, Sheila will have a total of $23,248 in her piggy bank.

**Final Answer:**
Sheila will have $23,248 in her piggy bank at the end of 4 years.
