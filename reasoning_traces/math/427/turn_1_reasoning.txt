Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To determine how much money Sheila will have in her piggy bank at the end of 4 years, we will break down the problem into several steps.

### Step 1: Calculate the total amount Sheila will save over 4 years.

Sheila saves $276 per month. To find out how much she saves in a year, we multiply her monthly savings by the number of months in a year:

\[
\text{Annual Savings} = 276 \text{ dollars/month} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 3312 \text{ dollars/year}
\]

Now, since she plans to save for 4 years, we multiply her annual savings by 4:

\[
\text{Total Savings over 4 years} = 3312 \text{ dollars/year} \times 4 \text{ years} = 13248 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Step 2: Add the initial amount saved to the total savings.

Sheila had already saved $3,000 before she started saving the additional amount. We will now add this initial amount to her total savings over 4 years:

\[
\text{Total Amount after 4 years} = \text{Initial Savings} + \text{Total Savings over 4 years}
\]
\[
\text{Total Amount after 4 years} = 3000 \text{ dollars} + 13248 \text{ dollars} = 16248 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Step 3: Include the amount added by Sheila's family.

Her family secretly added $7,000 into the piggy bank. We will now add this amount to the total amount calculated in the previous step:

\[
\text{Final Amount} = \text{Total Amount after 4 years} + \text{Family Contribution}
\]
\[
\text{Final Amount} = 16248 \text{ dollars} + 7000 \text{ dollars} = 23248 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Final Answer

At the end of 4 years, the total amount of money in Sheila's piggy bank will be:

\[
\boxed{23248} \text{ dollars}
\]
