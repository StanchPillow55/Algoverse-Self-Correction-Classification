==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 192," we need to first understand what the problem is asking. However, the problem statement "Sample math problem 192" is not specific enough to determine the exact nature of the problem. Therefore, I will assume this is a placeholder for a specific math problem, and I will create a sample math problem to solve.

Let's assume the problem is as follows:

**Problem:**
Calculate the sum of the first 192 positive integers.

To solve this problem, we can use the formula for the sum of the first \( n \) positive integers:

\[
S_n = \frac{n(n + 1)}{2}
\]

where \( n \) is the number of terms. In this case, \( n = 192 \).

**Step-by-step Solution:**

1. **Identify the formula:**
   The formula for the sum of the first \( n \) positive integers is \( S_n = \frac{n(n + 1)}{2} \).

2. **Substitute \( n = 192 \) into the formula:**
   \[
   S_{192} = \frac{192(192 + 1)}{2}
   \]

3. **Calculate \( 192 + 1 \):**
   \[
   192 + 1 = 193
   \]

4. **Substitute back into the formula:**
   \[
   S_{192} = \frac{192 \times 193}{2}
   \]

5. **Calculate \( 192 \times 193 \):**
   \[
   192 \times 193 = 37056
   \]

6. **Divide by 2 to find the sum:**
   \[
   S_{192} = \frac{37056}{2} = 18528
   \]

**Final Answer:**
The sum of the first 192 positive integers is 18,528.

This solution involves using a well-known formula for the sum of an arithmetic series, specifically the series of the first \( n \) positive integers. Each step involves basic arithmetic operations, and the final result is obtained by following the formula and performing the calculations accurately.
