Question ID: mathbench_192
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample math problem 192" refers to. Since the problem is not explicitly stated, I'll assume it's a placeholder for a specific math problem. Without the actual content of "Sample math problem 192," I'll demonstrate how to approach a generic math problem step by step.

Let's assume "Sample math problem 192" is a typical algebra problem. Here's an example problem we can solve:

**Example Problem:**
Solve for \( x \) in the equation: \( 3x + 5 = 20 \).

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   We need to find the value of \( x \) that makes the equation true.

2. **Isolate the Variable:**
   To solve for \( x \), we need to get \( x \) by itself on one side of the equation. The equation is:
   \[
   3x + 5 = 20
   \]

3. **Subtract 5 from Both Sides:**
   To eliminate the 5 on the left side, subtract 5 from both sides of the equation:
   \[
   3x + 5 - 5 = 20 - 5
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   3x = 15
   \]

4. **Divide by 3:**
   To solve for \( x \), divide both sides by 3:
   \[
   \frac{3x}{3} = \frac{15}{3}
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   x = 5
   \]

5. **Verify the Solution:**
   Substitute \( x = 5 \) back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies the equation:
   \[
   3(5) + 5 = 20
   \]
   Simplifying the left side gives:
   \[
   15 + 5 = 20
   \]
   \[
   20 = 20
   \]
   Since both sides are equal, \( x = 5 \) is the correct solution.

### Final Answer:
The solution to the equation \( 3x + 5 = 20 \) is \( x = 5 \).

This approach can be applied to various types of algebraic equations. If "Sample math problem 192" refers to a different type of problem, please provide more details, and I can adjust the solution accordingly.
