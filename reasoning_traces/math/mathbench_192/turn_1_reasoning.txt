Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample math problem 192" refers to. Since the problem is not explicitly stated, I'll assume it's a placeholder for a typical math problem. Let's create a hypothetical problem and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem 192:**

*Solve for \( x \) in the equation:*

\[ 3x + 5 = 20 \]

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Equation:**
   The equation given is a linear equation in one variable, \( x \). Our goal is to isolate \( x \) on one side of the equation to find its value.

2. **Subtract 5 from Both Sides:**
   To isolate the term with \( x \), we first need to eliminate the constant on the left side of the equation. We do this by subtracting 5 from both sides.

   \[
   3x + 5 - 5 = 20 - 5
   \]

   Simplifying both sides gives:

   \[
   3x = 15
   \]

3. **Divide Both Sides by 3:**
   Now, to solve for \( x \), divide both sides of the equation by 3.

   \[
   \frac{3x}{3} = \frac{15}{3}
   \]

   Simplifying both sides gives:

   \[
   x = 5
   \]

4. **Verify the Solution:**
   To ensure our solution is correct, substitute \( x = 5 \) back into the original equation and check if both sides are equal.

   \[
   3(5) + 5 = 20
   \]

   Simplifying the left side:

   \[
   15 + 5 = 20
   \]

   \[
   20 = 20
   \]

   Since both sides of the equation are equal, our solution is verified.

**Final Answer:**

The solution to the equation \( 3x + 5 = 20 \) is \( x = 5 \).
