==================================================

To solve the problem, we first need to understand what "Sample math problem 192" refers to. Since there is no specific problem statement provided, I'll create a sample math problem with the number 192 and solve it step by step.

**Sample Math Problem:**

"Find the prime factorization of 192 and use it to determine the number of divisors of 192."

**Step 1: Prime Factorization of 192**

To find the prime factorization of 192, we start by dividing it by the smallest prime number, which is 2, and continue dividing by 2 until it is no longer divisible by 2. Then, we proceed with the next smallest prime numbers.

1. \( 192 \div 2 = 96 \)
2. \( 96 \div 2 = 48 \)
3. \( 48 \div 2 = 24 \)
4. \( 24 \div 2 = 12 \)
5. \( 12 \div 2 = 6 \)
6. \( 6 \div 2 = 3 \)

Now, 3 is a prime number and cannot be divided by 2. We divide by 3:

7. \( 3 \div 3 = 1 \)

So, the prime factorization of 192 is \( 2^6 \times 3^1 \).

**Step 2: Determine the Number of Divisors**

To find the number of divisors of a number given its prime factorization, we use the formula:

\[
\text{If } n = p_1^{a_1} \times p_2^{a_2} \times \ldots \times p_k^{a_k}, \text{ then the number of divisors } D(n) = (a_1 + 1)(a_2 + 1) \ldots (a_k + 1)
\]

For 192, with the prime factorization \( 2^6 \times 3^1 \):

- \( a_1 = 6 \) for the prime 2
- \( a_2 = 1 \) for the prime 3

Using the formula:

\[
D(192) = (6 + 1)(1 + 1) = 7 \times 2 = 14
\]

**Final Answer:**

The prime factorization of 192 is \( 2^6 \times 3^1 \), and the number of divisors of 192 is 14.
