==================================================

To solve the problem, we first need to understand what "Sample math problem 192" refers to. Since the problem is not explicitly stated, I'll assume a generic math problem involving the number 192. Let's consider a few possibilities and solve them:

### Problem 1: Factorization of 192

**Step 1: Prime Factorization**

To find the prime factorization of 192, we start by dividing by the smallest prime number, which is 2:

\[ 
192 \div 2 = 96 
\]

Continue dividing by 2:

\[ 
96 \div 2 = 48 
\]

\[ 
48 \div 2 = 24 
\]

\[ 
24 \div 2 = 12 
\]

\[ 
12 \div 2 = 6 
\]

\[ 
6 \div 2 = 3 
\]

Now, 3 is a prime number, so we stop here. The prime factorization of 192 is:

\[ 
192 = 2^6 \times 3^1 
\]

**Final Answer for Problem 1:**

The prime factorization of 192 is \(2^6 \times 3\).

### Problem 2: Find the Square Root of 192

**Step 1: Simplify the Square Root**

We know from the prime factorization that:

\[ 
192 = 2^6 \times 3 
\]

The square root of 192 can be expressed as:

\[ 
\sqrt{192} = \sqrt{2^6 \times 3} 
\]

Using the property of square roots \(\sqrt{a \times b} = \sqrt{a} \times \sqrt{b}\), we can simplify:

\[ 
\sqrt{192} = \sqrt{2^6} \times \sqrt{3} 
\]

Since \(\sqrt{2^6} = 2^3 = 8\), we have:

\[ 
\sqrt{192} = 8 \times \sqrt{3} 
\]

**Final Answer for Problem 2:**

The simplified form of \(\sqrt{192}\) is \(8\sqrt{3}\).

### Problem 3: Determine if 192 is a Perfect Square

A perfect square is a number that can be expressed as the square of an integer. From the prime factorization:

\[ 
192 = 2^6 \times 3 
\]

For a number to be a perfect square, all the exponents in its prime factorization must be even. Here, the exponent of 3 is 1, which is odd. Therefore, 192 is not a perfect square.

**Final Answer for Problem 3:**

192 is not a perfect square.

### Conclusion

Since the original problem was not specified, I provided solutions to three potential problems involving the number 192. If you have a specific problem in mind, please provide more details, and I can solve it accordingly.
