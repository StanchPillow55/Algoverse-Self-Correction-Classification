Question ID: mathbench_453
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we first need to understand what "Sample math problem 453" refers to. Since the problem is not explicitly stated, I will assume it is a placeholder for a typical math problem. For the sake of this exercise, let's consider a common type of math problem: solving a quadratic equation.

Let's assume "Sample math problem 453" is the quadratic equation:

\[ x^2 - 5x + 6 = 0 \]

We will solve this equation step by step using the quadratic formula. The quadratic formula is given by:

\[ x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \]

where \( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \) is the standard form of a quadratic equation.

**Step 1: Identify the coefficients**

For the equation \( x^2 - 5x + 6 = 0 \), the coefficients are:
- \( a = 1 \)
- \( b = -5 \)
- \( c = 6 \)

**Step 2: Calculate the discriminant**

The discriminant (\( \Delta \)) is calculated as follows:

\[ \Delta = b^2 - 4ac \]

Substituting the values of \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \):

\[ \Delta = (-5)^2 - 4 \times 1 \times 6 \]
\[ \Delta = 25 - 24 \]
\[ \Delta = 1 \]

**Step 3: Apply the quadratic formula**

Since the discriminant is positive (\( \Delta = 1 \)), there are two distinct real roots. We will calculate them using the quadratic formula:

\[ x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{\Delta}}{2a} \]

Substitute the values of \( a \), \( b \), and \( \Delta \):

\[ x = \frac{-(-5) \pm \sqrt{1}}{2 \times 1} \]
\[ x = \frac{5 \pm 1}{2} \]

This gives us two solutions:

1. \( x_1 = \frac{5 + 1}{2} = \frac{6}{2} = 3 \)
2. \( x_2 = \frac{5 - 1}{2} = \frac{4}{2} = 2 \)

**Step 4: Verify the solutions**

To ensure our solutions are correct, we can substitute them back into the original equation:

- For \( x = 3 \):
  \[ (3)^2 - 5(3) + 6 = 9 - 15 + 6 = 0 \]

- For \( x = 2 \):
  \[ (2)^2 - 5(2) + 6 = 4 - 10 + 6 = 0 \]

Both solutions satisfy the original equation.

**Final Answer:**

The solutions to the quadratic equation \( x^2 - 5x + 6 = 0 \) are \( x = 3 \) and \( x = 2 \).
