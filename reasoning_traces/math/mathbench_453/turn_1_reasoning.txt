==================================================

To solve "Sample math problem 453," we first need to understand what the problem entails. However, since the problem statement is not provided, I'll demonstrate how to approach a typical math problem by creating a hypothetical example. Let's assume "Sample math problem 453" is a common algebra problem:

**Problem:** Solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).

**Step-by-step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Equation:**
   The equation given is \( 2x + 3 = 11 \). This is a linear equation in one variable, \( x \).

2. **Isolate the Variable:**
   To solve for \( x \), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We start by eliminating the constant term on the left side.

   \[
   2x + 3 = 11
   \]

   Subtract 3 from both sides to remove the constant:

   \[
   2x + 3 - 3 = 11 - 3
   \]

   Simplifying both sides gives:

   \[
   2x = 8
   \]

3. **Solve for \( x \):**
   Now, divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( x \):

   \[
   \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{8}{2}
   \]

   Simplifying both sides gives:

   \[
   x = 4
   \]

4. **Verify the Solution:**
   Substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation to verify:

   \[
   2(4) + 3 = 11
   \]

   Calculate the left side:

   \[
   8 + 3 = 11
   \]

   Since both sides of the equation are equal, our solution \( x = 4 \) is correct.

**Final Answer:**

The solution to the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \) is \( x = 4 \).

This process demonstrates how to solve a basic linear equation step-by-step. If "Sample math problem 453" refers to a different problem, please provide the specific details so I can assist you accordingly.
