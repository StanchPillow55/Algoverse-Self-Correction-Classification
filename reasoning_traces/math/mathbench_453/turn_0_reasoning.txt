==================================================

To solve the problem, we first need to understand what "Sample math problem 453" entails. Since the problem isn't explicitly stated, I'll create a sample math problem with the number 453 and solve it step-by-step.

**Sample Math Problem 453:**

Let's assume the problem is as follows:

"Calculate the sum of the digits of the number 453, and then multiply the result by 3. What is the final result?"

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Identify the digits of the number 453:**
   - The number 453 consists of three digits: 4, 5, and 3.

2. **Calculate the sum of these digits:**
   - Sum = 4 + 5 + 3

3. **Perform the addition:**
   - First, add 4 and 5:
     \[
     4 + 5 = 9
     \]
   - Then, add the result to 3:
     \[
     9 + 3 = 12
     \]

4. **Multiply the sum by 3:**
   - Multiply the sum (12) by 3:
     \[
     12 \times 3 = 36
     \]

5. **State the final result:**
   - The final result after multiplying the sum of the digits by 3 is 36.

Therefore, the final answer to the problem is 36.
