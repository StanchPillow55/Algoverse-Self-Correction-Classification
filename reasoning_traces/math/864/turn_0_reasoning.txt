To solve the problem, we need to calculate how many burritos were consumed during the picnic and then determine how many burritos are left over from the original order of 600 burritos.

1. **Calculate the total number of burritos consumed by the students:**
   - There are 50 students at the picnic.
   - Each student is given 10 burritos.
   - Therefore, the total number of burritos consumed by the students is:
     \[
     \text{Total burritos consumed by students} = \text{Number of students} \times \text{Burritos per student}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total burritos consumed by students} = 50 \times 10 = 500
     \]

2. **Calculate the total number of burritos consumed by Mr. George:**
   - Mr. George eats 20 burritos.
   - Therefore, the total number of burritos consumed by Mr. George is:
     \[
     \text{Total burritos consumed by Mr. George} = 20
     \]

3. **Calculate the total number of burritos consumed in total:**
   - Now, we add the burritos consumed by the students and Mr. George:
     \[
     \text{Total burritos consumed} = \text{Total burritos consumed by students} + \text{Total burritos consumed by Mr. George}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total burritos consumed} = 500 + 20 = 520
     \]

4. **Calculate the total number of leftover burritos:**
   - We started with 600 burritos and consumed 520 of them. To find the leftover burritos, we subtract the total consumed from the total ordered:
     \[
     \text{Total leftover burritos} = \text{Total ordered} - \text{Total consumed}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total leftover burritos} = 600 - 520 = 80
     \]

Thus, the total number of leftover burritos from the picnic is \( \boxed{80} \).
