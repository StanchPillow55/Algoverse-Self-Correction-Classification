==================================================

To address the problem effectively, let's first clarify what "Sample reasoning question 200" might entail. Since the problem is not explicitly stated, I'll assume it's a generic math problem that requires logical reasoning and problem-solving skills. Let's create a hypothetical math problem and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**

A company produces two types of widgets: A and B. The production cost for widget A is $5, and for widget B is $8. The company sells widget A for $10 and widget B for $15. In one month, the company produced 200 widgets in total and made a total profit of $1,200. How many of each type of widget did the company produce?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( x \) be the number of widget A produced.
   - Let \( y \) be the number of widget B produced.

2. **Set Up Equations:**
   - The total number of widgets produced is 200:
     \[
     x + y = 200
     \]

   - The profit from selling widget A is \( (10 - 5)x = 5x \).
   - The profit from selling widget B is \( (15 - 8)y = 7y \).
   - The total profit is $1,200:
     \[
     5x + 7y = 1200
     \]

3. **Solve the System of Equations:**

   We have the following system of equations:
   \[
   \begin{align*}
   x + y &= 200 \quad \text{(Equation 1)} \\
   5x + 7y &= 1200 \quad \text{(Equation 2)}
   \end{align*}
   \]

   - From Equation 1, express \( y \) in terms of \( x \):
     \[
     y = 200 - x
     \]

   - Substitute \( y = 200 - x \) into Equation 2:
     \[
     5x + 7(200 - x) = 1200
     \]

   - Simplify and solve for \( x \):
     \[
     5x + 1400 - 7x = 1200
     \]
     \[
     -2x + 1400 = 1200
     \]
     \[
     -2x = 1200 - 1400
     \]
     \[
     -2x = -200
     \]
     \[
     x = 100
     \]

   - Substitute \( x = 100 \) back into Equation 1 to find \( y \):
     \[
     100 + y = 200
     \]
     \[
     y = 100
     \]

4. **Verify the Solution:**

   - Check the total number of widgets:
     \[
     x + y = 100 + 100 = 200 \quad \text{(Correct)}
     \]

   - Check the total profit:
     \[
     5x + 7y = 5(100) + 7(100) = 500 + 700 = 1200 \quad \text{(Correct)}
     \]

**Final Answer:**

The company produced 100 widgets of type A and 100 widgets of type B.
