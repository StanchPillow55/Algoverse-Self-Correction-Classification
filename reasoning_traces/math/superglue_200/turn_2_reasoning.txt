Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 200" refers to. However, the problem statement is not clear or complete. It seems to be a placeholder or a reference to a specific question that is not provided here. 

To proceed, let's assume that "Sample reasoning question 200" is a hypothetical math problem. Since no specific details are given, I will create a sample math problem and solve it step by step.

**Sample Problem:**

Let's assume the problem is as follows:

"Calculate the sum of the first 200 positive integers."

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   We need to find the sum of the first 200 positive integers. The sequence of the first 200 positive integers is: 1, 2, 3, ..., 200.

2. **Identify the Formula:**
   The sum of the first \( n \) positive integers can be calculated using the formula:
   \[
   S = \frac{n(n + 1)}{2}
   \]
   where \( S \) is the sum and \( n \) is the number of terms.

3. **Substitute the Values:**
   Here, \( n = 200 \). Substitute 200 into the formula:
   \[
   S = \frac{200(200 + 1)}{2}
   \]

4. **Perform the Calculations:**
   - Calculate \( 200 + 1 = 201 \).
   - Multiply 200 by 201:
     \[
     200 \times 201 = 40200
     \]
   - Divide the product by 2:
     \[
     \frac{40200}{2} = 20100
     \]

5. **Conclusion:**
   The sum of the first 200 positive integers is 20,100.

**Final Answer:**

The sum of the first 200 positive integers is 20,100.
