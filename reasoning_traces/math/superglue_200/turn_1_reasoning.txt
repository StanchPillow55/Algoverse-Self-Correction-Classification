Question ID: superglue_200
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem effectively, we need to understand what "Sample reasoning question 200" refers to. Since the question is not explicitly stated, I will assume it is a placeholder for a specific math problem or reasoning question. Without the actual content of "Sample reasoning question 200," I will demonstrate how to approach a generic reasoning problem step by step.

Let's assume "Sample reasoning question 200" is a typical math problem involving logical reasoning. For the sake of illustration, let's consider a problem involving number sequences, which is a common type of reasoning question.

**Problem Example:**
Find the next number in the sequence: 2, 4, 8, 16, ...

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Identify the Pattern:**
   - Look at the sequence: 2, 4, 8, 16.
   - Notice that each number is double the previous number.

2. **Verify the Pattern:**
   - Check if the pattern holds for all given numbers:
     - \(4 = 2 \times 2\)
     - \(8 = 4 \times 2\)
     - \(16 = 8 \times 2\)
   - The pattern is consistent: each term is multiplied by 2 to get the next term.

3. **Apply the Pattern to Find the Next Number:**
   - The last number in the sequence is 16.
   - Multiply 16 by 2 to find the next number:
     \[
     16 \times 2 = 32
     \]

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The next number in the sequence is 32.

**Final Answer:**
The next number in the sequence is 32.

This example illustrates the process of identifying a pattern, verifying it, and applying it to find the next term in a sequence. If "Sample reasoning question 200" refers to a different type of problem, please provide more details or context, and I can adjust the solution accordingly.
