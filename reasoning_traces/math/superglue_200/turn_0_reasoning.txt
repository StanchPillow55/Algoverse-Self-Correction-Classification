It seems like there might be some missing information in your request. "Sample reasoning question 200" does not provide enough context or details for me to solve a specific math problem. However, I can guide you through a general approach to solving math problems by reasoning through a hypothetical example. Let's assume we have a math problem to solve:

**Problem:**
A company produces 200 widgets per day. Each widget sells for $50. The cost to produce each widget is $30. Calculate the company's daily profit.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We need to find the daily profit of the company.
   - Profit is calculated as the total revenue minus the total cost.

2. **Identify the Given Information:**
   - Number of widgets produced per day = 200
   - Selling price per widget = $50
   - Cost to produce each widget = $30

3. **Calculate Total Revenue:**
   - Revenue is the total amount of money received from selling the widgets.
   - Total Revenue = (Number of Widgets) × (Selling Price per Widget)
   - Total Revenue = 200 widgets × $50/widget = $10,000

4. **Calculate Total Cost:**
   - The total cost is the total amount of money spent to produce the widgets.
   - Total Cost = (Number of Widgets) × (Cost per Widget)
   - Total Cost = 200 widgets × $30/widget = $6,000

5. **Calculate Profit:**
   - Profit is the difference between total revenue and total cost.
   - Profit = Total Revenue - Total Cost
   - Profit = $10,000 - $6,000 = $4,000

6. **Conclusion:**
   - The company's daily profit is $4,000.

**Final Answer:**
The company's daily profit is $4,000.
