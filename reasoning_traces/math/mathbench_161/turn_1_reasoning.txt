==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 161," we first need to understand what the problem is asking. Since the problem statement is not provided, I'll create a hypothetical math problem and solve it step-by-step. Let's assume the problem is as follows:

**Problem 161:**
Solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Equation:**
   The equation given is \( 2x + 3 = 11 \). This is a linear equation in one variable, \( x \).

2. **Isolate the Variable:**
   To solve for \( x \), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We start by eliminating the constant term on the left side of the equation.

   \[
   2x + 3 = 11
   \]

   Subtract 3 from both sides to remove the constant term from the left side:

   \[
   2x + 3 - 3 = 11 - 3
   \]

   Simplifying both sides gives:

   \[
   2x = 8
   \]

3. **Solve for \( x \):**
   Now, we need to solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides of the equation by the coefficient of \( x \), which is 2.

   \[
   \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{8}{2}
   \]

   Simplifying both sides gives:

   \[
   x = 4
   \]

4. **Verify the Solution:**
   It's always a good idea to verify the solution by substituting it back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies the equation.

   Substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation:

   \[
   2(4) + 3 = 11
   \]

   Simplify the left side:

   \[
   8 + 3 = 11
   \]

   Since both sides of the equation are equal, our solution \( x = 4 \) is correct.

**Final Answer:**
The solution to the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \) is \( x = 4 \).
