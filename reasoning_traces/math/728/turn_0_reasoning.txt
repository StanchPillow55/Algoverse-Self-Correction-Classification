To find the percentage of Candy's spools that are blue, we first need to determine the total number of spools she has and then the total number of blue spools.

### Step 1: Count the total number of spools

Candy has the following spools:
- Light blue spools: 15
- Dark blue spools: 45
- Light green spools: 40
- Dark green spools: 50

Now, we add these numbers together to find the total number of spools:

\[
\text{Total spools} = \text{Light blue} + \text{Dark blue} + \text{Light green} + \text{Dark green}
\]
\[
\text{Total spools} = 15 + 45 + 40 + 50
\]

Calculating this step-by-step:
- \(15 + 45 = 60\)
- \(60 + 40 = 100\)
- \(100 + 50 = 150\)

Thus, the total number of spools is:

\[
\text{Total spools} = 150
\]

### Step 2: Count the total number of blue spools

Next, we need to find the total number of blue spools, which includes both light blue and dark blue spools:

\[
\text{Total blue spools} = \text{Light blue} + \text{Dark blue}
\]
\[
\text{Total blue spools} = 15 + 45
\]

Calculating this:

\[
\text{Total blue spools} = 60
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the percentage of blue spools

To find the percentage of spools that are blue, we use the formula for percentage:

\[
\text{Percentage of blue spools} = \left( \frac{\text{Total blue spools}}{\text{Total spools}} \right) \times 100
\]

Substituting the values we found:

\[
\text{Percentage of blue spools} = \left( \frac{60}{150} \right) \times 100
\]

Calculating the fraction:

\[
\frac{60}{150} = 0.4
\]

Now, multiplying by 100 to convert to a percentage:

\[
0.4 \times 100 = 40
\]

### Final Answer

Thus, the percentage of Candy's spools that are blue is:

\[
\boxed{40\%}
\]
