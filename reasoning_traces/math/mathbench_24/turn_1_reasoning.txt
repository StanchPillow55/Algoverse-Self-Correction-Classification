==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 24," we need to first understand what the problem is asking. However, the problem statement is incomplete as it only states "Sample math problem 24" without any specific details or context. 

To proceed, let's assume that "Sample math problem 24" refers to a typical math problem involving the number 24. One common type of problem could involve finding the factors of 24, performing operations with 24, or solving an equation involving 24. Without specific instructions, I'll explore a few possibilities:

### Possibility 1: Finding the Factors of 24

To find the factors of 24, we need to determine all the whole numbers that can be multiplied together to equal 24.

1. Start with 1 and 24: \(1 \times 24 = 24\)
2. Next, try 2: \(2 \times 12 = 24\)
3. Then, try 3: \(3 \times 8 = 24\)
4. Try 4: \(4 \times 6 = 24\)
5. Finally, 5 does not work because 24 is not divisible by 5.

Thus, the factors of 24 are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 24.

### Possibility 2: Solving an Equation Involving 24

Let's consider a simple equation where we solve for \(x\) in the equation \(x + 24 = 48\).

1. Start with the equation: \(x + 24 = 48\)
2. Subtract 24 from both sides to isolate \(x\): 
   \[
   x + 24 - 24 = 48 - 24
   \]
3. Simplify the equation: 
   \[
   x = 24
   \]

The solution to the equation is \(x = 24\).

### Possibility 3: Performing Operations with 24

Let's perform a basic arithmetic operation, such as multiplication, with 24. For example, calculate \(24 \times 3\).

1. Set up the multiplication: \(24 \times 3\)
2. Multiply: 
   \[
   24 \times 3 = 72
   \]

The result of the multiplication is 72.

### Conclusion

Without specific details, we explored several possibilities involving the number 24. If the problem had specific instructions, such as finding factors, solving an equation, or performing arithmetic operations, the approach would be tailored accordingly. 

If you have more details or a specific problem involving 24, please provide them for a more targeted solution.
