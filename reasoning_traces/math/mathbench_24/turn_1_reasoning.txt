Question ID: mathbench_24
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, let's first understand what "Sample math problem 24" might entail. Since no specific details are given, I'll assume it's a generic math problem involving the number 24. Let's consider a few possibilities:

### Possibility 1: Basic Arithmetic Problem
Suppose the problem is to find the sum of the digits of 24.

1. **Identify the digits**: The number 24 consists of the digits 2 and 4.
2. **Sum the digits**: Add the digits together: \(2 + 4 = 6\).

**Final Answer**: The sum of the digits of 24 is 6.

### Possibility 2: Factorization Problem
Suppose the problem is to find the prime factorization of 24.

1. **Start with the smallest prime number, 2**: 
   - 24 is even, so divide by 2: \(24 \div 2 = 12\).
2. **Continue with 12**:
   - 12 is even, so divide by 2: \(12 \div 2 = 6\).
3. **Continue with 6**:
   - 6 is even, so divide by 2: \(6 \div 2 = 3\).
4. **Now consider 3**:
   - 3 is a prime number.

The prime factorization of 24 is \(2^3 \times 3\).

**Final Answer**: The prime factorization of 24 is \(2^3 \times 3\).

### Possibility 3: Divisibility Problem
Suppose the problem is to determine if 24 is divisible by 3.

1. **Sum the digits of 24**: \(2 + 4 = 6\).
2. **Check divisibility by 3**: A number is divisible by 3 if the sum of its digits is divisible by 3. Since 6 is divisible by 3, 24 is also divisible by 3.

**Final Answer**: Yes, 24 is divisible by 3.

### Conclusion
Without specific details, I've explored a few potential problems involving the number 24. If you have a specific problem in mind, please provide more details so I can give a more precise solution.
