It seems like the problem statement is incomplete or unclear. However, I'll assume you want me to solve a math problem involving the number 24. Let's consider a problem where we find the factors of 24 and then determine if 24 is a prime number.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find the factors of 24.
   - We will also determine if 24 is a prime number.

2. **Finding the Factors of 24:**
   - A factor is a number that divides another number without leaving a remainder.
   - To find the factors of 24, we start with 1 and go up to 24, checking which numbers divide 24 evenly.

3. **Checking Divisibility:**
   - **1:** \( 24 \div 1 = 24 \) (remainder 0)
   - **2:** \( 24 \div 2 = 12 \) (remainder 0)
   - **3:** \( 24 \div 3 = 8 \) (remainder 0)
   - **4:** \( 24 \div 4 = 6 \) (remainder 0)
   - **5:** \( 24 \div 5 = 4.8 \) (not a whole number, remainder not 0)
   - **6:** \( 24 \div 6 = 4 \) (remainder 0)
   - **7:** \( 24 \div 7 \approx 3.4286 \) (not a whole number, remainder not 0)
   - **8:** \( 24 \div 8 = 3 \) (remainder 0)
   - **9:** \( 24 \div 9 \approx 2.6667 \) (not a whole number, remainder not 0)
   - **10:** \( 24 \div 10 = 2.4 \) (not a whole number, remainder not 0)
   - **11:** \( 24 \div 11 \approx 2.1818 \) (not a whole number, remainder not 0)
   - **12:** \( 24 \div 12 = 2 \) (remainder 0)
   - **13 to 23:** None of these numbers divide 24 evenly.
   - **24:** \( 24 \div 24 = 1 \) (remainder 0)

4. **Listing the Factors:**
   - The factors of 24 are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24.

5. **Determining if 24 is a Prime Number:**
   - A prime number has exactly two distinct positive divisors: 1 and itself.
   - Since 24 has more than two divisors, it is not a prime number.

### Final Answer:
- The factors of 24 are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24.
- 24 is not a prime number.
