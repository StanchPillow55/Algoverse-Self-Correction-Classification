It seems like the problem statement is incomplete. However, I will assume you are asking for a solution to a math problem involving the number 24. Let's consider a few different types of problems involving the number 24 and solve them step by step.

### Problem 1: Basic Arithmetic
**Problem:** What is 24 divided by 6?

**Solution:**
1. **Understand the Problem:** We need to divide 24 by 6.
2. **Perform the Division:** 
   \[
   24 \div 6 = 4
   \]
3. **Verify the Result:** Multiply the quotient by the divisor to check:
   \[
   4 \times 6 = 24
   \]
   The multiplication checks out, so the division is correct.

**Final Answer:** 4

### Problem 2: Solving an Equation
**Problem:** Solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 3x + 6 = 24 \).

**Solution:**
1. **Understand the Problem:** We need to find the value of \( x \) that satisfies the equation.
2. **Isolate the Variable:**
   - Subtract 6 from both sides:
     \[
     3x + 6 - 6 = 24 - 6
     \]
     \[
     3x = 18
     \]
   - Divide both sides by 3:
     \[
     \frac{3x}{3} = \frac{18}{3}
     \]
     \[
     x = 6
     \]
3. **Verify the Solution:** Substitute \( x = 6 \) back into the original equation:
   \[
   3(6) + 6 = 18 + 6 = 24
   \]
   The left side equals the right side, confirming the solution is correct.

**Final Answer:** \( x = 6 \)

### Problem 3: Factorization
**Problem:** What are the prime factors of 24?

**Solution:**
1. **Understand the Problem:** We need to express 24 as a product of prime numbers.
2. **Perform the Factorization:**
   - Start by dividing by the smallest prime number, 2:
     \[
     24 \div 2 = 12
     \]
   - Divide 12 by 2:
     \[
     12 \div 2 = 6
     \]
   - Divide 6 by 2:
     \[
     6 \div 2 = 3
     \]
   - Finally, 3 is a prime number.
3. **List the Prime Factors:** The prime factors of 24 are \( 2 \times 2 \times 2 \times 3 \), or \( 2^3 \times 3 \).

**Final Answer:** The prime factors of 24 are \( 2^3 \times 3 \).
