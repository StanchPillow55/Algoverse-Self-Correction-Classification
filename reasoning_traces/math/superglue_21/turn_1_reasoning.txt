==================================================

To solve the problem effectively, I need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 21" entails. However, since the problem statement is not provided, I will demonstrate how to approach a generic math problem by breaking it down into steps, showing all calculations, and explaining the reasoning.

Let's assume a sample math problem:

**Problem:** Solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).

**Step 1: Understand the Problem**

The equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \) is a linear equation in one variable. The goal is to find the value of \( x \) that makes this equation true.

**Step 2: Isolate the Variable**

To solve for \( x \), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We start by eliminating the constant term on the left side.

- Subtract 3 from both sides of the equation:

\[
2x + 3 - 3 = 11 - 3
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
2x = 8
\]

**Step 3: Solve for \( x \)**

Now, we need to solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides of the equation by the coefficient of \( x \), which is 2.

- Divide both sides by 2:

\[
\frac{2x}{2} = \frac{8}{2}
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
x = 4
\]

**Step 4: Verify the Solution**

To ensure our solution is correct, we substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation and check if both sides are equal.

- Substitute \( x = 4 \) into \( 2x + 3 = 11 \):

\[
2(4) + 3 = 11
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
8 + 3 = 11
\]

Since both sides of the equation are equal, our solution is verified.

**Final Answer**

The solution to the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \) is \( x = 4 \).

This approach can be applied to various types of math problems by understanding the problem, isolating the variable, solving for the variable, and verifying the solution. If you have a specific problem or need further assistance, please provide more details.
