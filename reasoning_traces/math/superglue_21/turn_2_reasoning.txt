==================================================

To solve the problem effectively, I'll need to understand the context and details of "Sample reasoning question 21." Since the problem statement is not provided, I'll demonstrate a general approach to solving a reasoning-based math problem by creating a hypothetical example. 

Let's assume the problem is as follows:

**Problem:**
A train travels from City A to City B at a speed of 60 km/h. After reaching City B, it immediately returns to City A at a speed of 90 km/h. The total travel time for the round trip is 5 hours. What is the distance between City A and City B?

**Solution:**

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( d \) be the distance between City A and City B in kilometers.

2. **Calculate Time for Each Leg of the Trip:**
   - Time taken to travel from City A to City B at 60 km/h is \( \frac{d}{60} \) hours.
   - Time taken to return from City B to City A at 90 km/h is \( \frac{d}{90} \) hours.

3. **Set Up the Equation for Total Time:**
   - The total travel time for the round trip is given as 5 hours. Therefore, the equation is:
     \[
     \frac{d}{60} + \frac{d}{90} = 5
     \]

4. **Find a Common Denominator:**
   - The common denominator for 60 and 90 is 180. Rewrite the fractions:
     \[
     \frac{d}{60} = \frac{3d}{180}
     \]
     \[
     \frac{d}{90} = \frac{2d}{180}
     \]

5. **Combine the Fractions:**
   - Combine the fractions on the left side of the equation:
     \[
     \frac{3d}{180} + \frac{2d}{180} = \frac{5d}{180}
     \]

6. **Simplify the Equation:**
   - The equation becomes:
     \[
     \frac{5d}{180} = 5
     \]

7. **Solve for \( d \):**
   - Multiply both sides by 180 to eliminate the fraction:
     \[
     5d = 5 \times 180
     \]
     \[
     5d = 900
     \]
   - Divide both sides by 5:
     \[
     d = \frac{900}{5}
     \]
     \[
     d = 180
     \]

8. **Conclusion:**
   - The distance between City A and City B is 180 kilometers.

**Final Answer:**
The distance between City A and City B is 180 km.
