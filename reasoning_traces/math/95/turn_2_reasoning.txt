Question ID: 95
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the total value of Alice's quarters.**
   - Alice has 20 quarters.
   - The value of one quarter is $0.25.
   - Therefore, the total value of 20 quarters is:
     \[
     20 \times 0.25 = 5 \text{ dollars}
     \]

2. **Exchange the quarters for nickels.**
   - Since Alice exchanges her quarters for nickels, we need to determine how many nickels she receives.
   - The value of one nickel is $0.05.
   - To find out how many nickels she gets, we divide the total value of the quarters by the value of one nickel:
     \[
     \frac{5}{0.05} = 100 \text{ nickels}
     \]

3. **Determine the number of iron nickels and their value.**
   - According to the problem, 20% of the nickels are iron nickels worth $3 each.
   - First, calculate 20% of 100 nickels:
     \[
     0.20 \times 100 = 20 \text{ iron nickels}
     \]
   - Each iron nickel is worth $3, so the total value of the iron nickels is:
     \[
     20 \times 3 = 60 \text{ dollars}
     \]

4. **Determine the number of regular nickels and their value.**
   - The remaining nickels are regular nickels. Since there are 100 nickels in total and 20 are iron nickels, the number of regular nickels is:
     \[
     100 - 20 = 80 \text{ regular nickels}
     \]
   - The value of the regular nickels is:
     \[
     80 \times 0.05 = 4 \text{ dollars}
     \]

5. **Calculate the total value of all the nickels.**
   - The total value of Alice's money now is the sum of the value of the iron nickels and the regular nickels:
     \[
     60 + 4 = 64 \text{ dollars}
     \]

Therefore, the total value of Alice's money now is \(\boxed{64 \text{ dollars}}\).
