Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the total value of the quarters Alice initially has.**
   - Alice has 20 quarters.
   - The value of one quarter is $0.25.
   - Therefore, the total value of the quarters is:
     \[
     20 \times 0.25 = 5 \text{ dollars}
     \]

2. **Exchange quarters for nickels.**
   - Alice exchanges her quarters for nickels at the bank.
   - The value of one nickel is $0.05.
   - Since Alice has $5 from her quarters, she will receive:
     \[
     \frac{5}{0.05} = 100 \text{ nickels}
     \]

3. **Determine the number of iron nickels and their value.**
   - 20% of the nickels are iron nickels worth $3 each.
   - Calculate 20% of 100 nickels:
     \[
     0.20 \times 100 = 20 \text{ iron nickels}
     \]
   - The value of each iron nickel is $3, so the total value of the iron nickels is:
     \[
     20 \times 3 = 60 \text{ dollars}
     \]

4. **Determine the number and value of the remaining regular nickels.**
   - The remaining nickels are regular nickels.
   - Total nickels = 100, iron nickels = 20, so regular nickels = 100 - 20 = 80.
   - The value of the regular nickels is:
     \[
     80 \times 0.05 = 4 \text{ dollars}
     \]

5. **Calculate the total value of Alice's money now.**
   - The total value is the sum of the value of the iron nickels and the regular nickels:
     \[
     60 + 4 = 64 \text{ dollars}
     \]

Therefore, the total value of Alice's money now is \(\boxed{64 \text{ dollars}}\).
