Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we will break it down into steps.

1. **Determine the number of boys and girls among the 200 Grade 5 students.**

   We know that \( \frac{2}{5} \) of the students are boys. To find the number of boys, we calculate:

   \[
   \text{Number of boys} = \frac{2}{5} \times 200
   \]

   Performing the multiplication:

   \[
   \text{Number of boys} = \frac{2 \times 200}{5} = \frac{400}{5} = 80
   \]

   Now, to find the number of girls, we subtract the number of boys from the total number of students:

   \[
   \text{Number of girls} = 200 - 80 = 120
   \]

2. **Determine how many girls are in the girl scout.**

   We know that \( \frac{2}{3} \) of the girls are in the girl scout. To find the number of girls in the girl scout, we calculate:

   \[
   \text{Number of girls in girl scout} = \frac{2}{3} \times 120
   \]

   Performing the multiplication:

   \[
   \text{Number of girls in girl scout} = \frac{2 \times 120}{3} = \frac{240}{3} = 80
   \]

3. **Determine how many girls are not in the girl scout.**

   To find the number of girls not in the girl scout, we subtract the number of girls in the girl scout from the total number of girls:

   \[
   \text{Number of girls not in girl scout} = 120 - 80 = 40
   \]

4. **Final answer.**

   Therefore, the number of girls who are not in the girl scout is:

   \[
   \boxed{40}
   \]
