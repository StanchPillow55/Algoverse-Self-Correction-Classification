==================================================

Alice has 20 quarters. Since a quarter is worth 25 cents, the total value of her quarters is 20 * 25 cents = 500 cents or $5.

When she exchanges these quarters for nickels, each nickel is worth 5 cents. Therefore, she will have 500 / 5 = 100 nickels.

According to the problem, 20% of these nickels are iron nickels worth $3 each. So, the number of iron nickels is 20/100 * 100 = 20 nickels.

The value of these iron nickels is 20 * $3 = $60.

The remaining 80% of the nickels are regular nickels. So, the number of regular nickels is 80/100 * 100 = 80 nickels.

The value of these regular nickels is 80 * 5 cents = 400 cents or $4.

Therefore, the total value of her money now is $60 (from iron nickels) + $4 (from regular nickels) = $64. 

So, Alice now has $64.
