To solve the problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total value of the quarters Alice has.**
2. **Determine how many nickels she receives in exchange for her quarters.**
3. **Identify how many of those nickels are iron nickels and calculate their value.**
4. **Calculate the total value of the remaining nickels.**
5. **Sum the values to find the total value of her money now.**

### Step 1: Calculate the total value of the quarters

Alice has 20 quarters. The value of one quarter is $0.25. Therefore, the total value of the quarters is:

\[
\text{Total value of quarters} = 20 \times 0.25 = 5 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Step 2: Determine how many nickels she receives

Assuming Alice exchanges her quarters for nickels at a 1:1 value ratio, we need to find out how many nickels she can get for $5. The value of one nickel is $0.05. Therefore, the number of nickels she receives is:

\[
\text{Number of nickels} = \frac{\text{Total value in dollars}}{\text{Value of one nickel}} = \frac{5}{0.05} = 100 \text{ nickels}
\]

### Step 3: Identify how many of those nickels are iron nickels

According to the problem, 20% of the nickels are iron nickels. To find out how many nickels are iron nickels, we calculate:

\[
\text{Number of iron nickels} = 20\% \text{ of } 100 = 0.20 \times 100 = 20 \text{ iron nickels}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the value of the iron nickels

Each iron nickel is worth $3. Therefore, the total value of the iron nickels is:

\[
\text{Value of iron nickels} = 20 \times 3 = 60 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Step 5: Calculate the value of the remaining nickels

The total number of nickels is 100, and we have already calculated that 20 of them are iron nickels. Therefore, the number of regular nickels is:

\[
\text{Number of regular nickels} = 100 - 20 = 80 \text{ regular nickels}
\]

The value of one regular nickel is $0.05, so the total value of the regular nickels is:

\[
\text{Value of regular nickels} = 80 \times 0.05 = 4 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Step 6: Calculate the total value of her money now

Now, we sum the values of the iron nickels and the regular nickels:

\[
\text{Total value} = \text{Value of iron nickels} + \text{Value of regular nickels} = 60 + 4 = 64 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Final Answer

The total value of Alice's money now is:

\[
\boxed{64 \text{ dollars}}
\]
