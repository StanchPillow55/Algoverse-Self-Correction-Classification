Question ID: superglue_395
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, I need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 395" refers to. Since the problem statement is not clear or specific, I'll approach this by considering a generic math problem-solving strategy. 

Let's assume "Sample reasoning question 395" is a placeholder for a typical math problem. I'll create a hypothetical problem and solve it step-by-step to demonstrate the process.

**Hypothetical Problem:**

"Calculate the area of a triangle with a base of 10 units and a height of 5 units."

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We need to find the area of a triangle.
   - We are given the base \( b = 10 \) units and the height \( h = 5 \) units.

2. **Recall the Formula for the Area of a Triangle:**
   - The formula for the area \( A \) of a triangle is:
     \[
     A = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height}
     \]

3. **Substitute the Given Values into the Formula:**
   - Substitute \( b = 10 \) and \( h = 5 \) into the formula:
     \[
     A = \frac{1}{2} \times 10 \times 5
     \]

4. **Perform the Calculations:**
   - First, multiply the base and the height:
     \[
     10 \times 5 = 50
     \]
   - Then, multiply by \(\frac{1}{2}\):
     \[
     A = \frac{1}{2} \times 50 = 25
     \]

5. **State the Final Answer:**
   - The area of the triangle is 25 square units.

**Conclusion:**

The solution involves understanding the problem, recalling the relevant formula, substituting the given values, performing the calculations, and stating the final answer. In this hypothetical example, the area of the triangle is 25 square units. 

If "Sample reasoning question 395" refers to a specific problem, please provide the details, and I will solve it accordingly.
