To solve the problem, we will first calculate how much money Rafaela received in tips and then determine how much Julieta received based on the information given.

1. **Calculate Rafaela's tips:**
   - Each of the 40 customers gave Rafaela a $20 tip.
   - To find the total tips Rafaela received, we multiply the number of customers by the tip amount:
     \[
     \text{Total tips for Rafaela} = \text{Number of customers} \times \text{Tip per customer}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total tips for Rafaela} = 40 \times 20 = 800
     \]
   - So, Rafaela received **$800** in tips.

2. **Calculate Julieta's tips:**
   - Julieta received 10% less money in tips than Rafaela. 
   - First, we need to calculate 10% of Rafaela's tips:
     \[
     \text{10% of Rafaela's tips} = 0.10 \times 800 = 80
     \]
   - Now, we subtract this amount from Rafaela's total tips to find out how much Julieta received:
     \[
     \text{Total tips for Julieta} = \text{Total tips for Rafaela} - \text{10% of Rafaela's tips}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total tips for Julieta} = 800 - 80 = 720
     \]
   - So, Julieta received **$720** in tips.

3. **Calculate the total tips received by both Rafaela and Julieta:**
   - To find the total tips received by both, we add Rafaela's and Julieta's tips together:
     \[
     \text{Total tips for both} = \text{Total tips for Rafaela} + \text{Total tips for Julieta}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total tips for both} = 800 + 720 = 1520
     \]

Thus, the total amount of money that Julieta and Rafaela received as tips altogether is **$1520**. 

Final answer: **$1520**.
