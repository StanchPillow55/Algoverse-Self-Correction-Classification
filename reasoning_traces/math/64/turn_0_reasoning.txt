To find out how much James earns per week from both jobs, we will break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate James's earnings from his main job:**
   - James earns $20 per hour at his main job.
   - He works 30 hours at this job.
   - To find his total earnings from the main job, we multiply his hourly wage by the number of hours worked:
     \[
     \text{Earnings from main job} = \text{Hourly wage} \times \text{Hours worked}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Earnings from main job} = 20 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 30 \, \text{hours} = 600 \, \text{dollars}
     \]

2. **Calculate James's earnings from his second job:**
   - James earns 20% less at his second job compared to his main job.
   - First, we need to calculate 20% of his main job's hourly wage:
     \[
     20\% \text{ of } 20 = 0.20 \times 20 = 4 \, \text{dollars}
     \]
   - Now, we subtract this amount from his main job's hourly wage to find his hourly wage at the second job:
     \[
     \text{Hourly wage at second job} = 20 - 4 = 16 \, \text{dollars/hour}
     \]
   - James works half the hours at his second job compared to his main job. Since he works 30 hours at his main job, he works:
     \[
     \text{Hours at second job} = \frac{30}{2} = 15 \, \text{hours}
     \]
   - Now we can calculate his total earnings from the second job:
     \[
     \text{Earnings from second job} = \text{Hourly wage at second job} \times \text{Hours worked at second job}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Earnings from second job} = 16 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 15 \, \text{hours} = 240 \, \text{dollars}
     \]

3. **Calculate total earnings for the week:**
   - To find James's total earnings for the week, we add the earnings from both jobs:
     \[
     \text{Total earnings} = \text{Earnings from main job} + \text{Earnings from second job}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total earnings} = 600 \, \text{dollars} + 240 \, \text{dollars} = 840 \, \text{dollars}
     \]

Thus, James earns a total of **$840** per week.

Final answer: **$840**
