Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, let's calculate how much James earns from his main job. He works 30 hours a week and earns $20 an hour. So, his earnings from his main job are:

30 hours * $20/hour = $600

Next, let's calculate how much he earns from his second job. He works half as much at his second job as he does at his main job, so he works:

30 hours / 2 = 15 hours

He earns 20% less at his second job than he does at his main job. So, his hourly wage at his second job is:

$20/hour - ($20/hour * 20/100) = $20/hour - $4/hour = $16/hour

So, his earnings from his second job are:

15 hours * $16/hour = $240

Finally, let's add his earnings from both jobs to find his total weekly earnings:

$600 (from main job) + $240 (from second job) = $840

So, James earns $840 per week.
