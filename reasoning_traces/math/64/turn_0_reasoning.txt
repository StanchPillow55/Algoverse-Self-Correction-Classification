==================================================

To determine how far Sophia can drive on a single tank of gas, we need to calculate her car's fuel efficiency in miles per gallon (mpg) and then use that to find out the total distance she can travel on a full tank.

### Step 1: Calculate Fuel Efficiency

1. **Distance Traveled**: Sophia has traveled 100 miles.
2. **Gallons Used**: She put in 4 gallons of gas to fill her tank after traveling those 100 miles.

To find the fuel efficiency in miles per gallon, we use the formula:

\[
\text{Fuel Efficiency (mpg)} = \frac{\text{Distance Traveled (miles)}}{\text{Gallons Used (gallons)}}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\text{Fuel Efficiency (mpg)} = \frac{100 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ gallons}} = 25 \text{ mpg}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate Total Distance on a Full Tank

Now that we know the fuel efficiency, we can calculate how far she can drive on a full tank of gas. The owner's manual states that her tank holds 12 gallons.

To find the total distance she can drive on a full tank, we use the formula:

\[
\text{Total Distance} = \text{Fuel Efficiency (mpg)} \times \text{Tank Capacity (gallons)}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\text{Total Distance} = 25 \text{ mpg} \times 12 \text{ gallons} = 300 \text{ miles}
\]

### Final Answer

Sophia can drive **300 miles** on a single tank of gas.
