==================================================

To determine how much James earns per week, we need to calculate his earnings from both his main job and his second job.

**Step 1: Calculate earnings from the main job.**

James earns $20 per hour at his main job. He works 30 hours at this job.

\[
\text{Earnings from main job} = \text{Hourly rate} \times \text{Hours worked} = 20 \times 30 = 600
\]

James earns $600 from his main job.

**Step 2: Calculate the hourly rate for the second job.**

James earns 20% less at his second job compared to his main job. To find the hourly rate for the second job, we calculate 20% of $20 and subtract it from $20.

\[
\text{20% of } \$20 = 0.20 \times 20 = 4
\]

\[
\text{Hourly rate for second job} = 20 - 4 = 16
\]

James earns $16 per hour at his second job.

**Step 3: Calculate earnings from the second job.**

James works half as many hours at his second job as he does at his main job. Since he works 30 hours at his main job, he works:

\[
\text{Hours at second job} = \frac{30}{2} = 15
\]

Now, calculate the earnings from the second job:

\[
\text{Earnings from second job} = \text{Hourly rate} \times \text{Hours worked} = 16 \times 15 = 240
\]

James earns $240 from his second job.

**Step 4: Calculate total weekly earnings.**

Add the earnings from both jobs to find the total weekly earnings:

\[
\text{Total weekly earnings} = \text{Earnings from main job} + \text{Earnings from second job} = 600 + 240 = 840
\]

James earns a total of $840 per week.

**Final Answer:**

James earns $840 per week.
