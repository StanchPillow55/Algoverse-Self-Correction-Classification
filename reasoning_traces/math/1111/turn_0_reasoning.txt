To find out how much the store will receive after selling all the balls, we need to calculate the total revenue from each type of ball and then sum these amounts.

1. **Calculate the revenue from red balls:**
   - Number of red balls = 3
   - Cost per red ball = $9
   - Total revenue from red balls = Number of red balls × Cost per red ball
   \[
   \text{Total revenue from red balls} = 3 \times 9 = 27 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Calculate the revenue from blue balls:**
   - Number of blue balls = 11
   - Cost per blue ball = $5
   - Total revenue from blue balls = Number of blue balls × Cost per blue ball
   \[
   \text{Total revenue from blue balls} = 11 \times 5 = 55 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Calculate the revenue from green balls:**
   - Number of green balls = 25
   - Cost per green ball = $3
   - Total revenue from green balls = Number of green balls × Cost per green ball
   \[
   \text{Total revenue from green balls} = 25 \times 3 = 75 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Calculate the total revenue from all balls:**
   - Total revenue = Total revenue from red balls + Total revenue from blue balls + Total revenue from green balls
   \[
   \text{Total revenue} = 27 + 55 + 75
   \]
   - Now, we perform the addition:
   \[
   27 + 55 = 82
   \]
   \[
   82 + 75 = 157
   \]

Thus, the total amount the store will receive after all the balls are sold is **$157**.

**Final Answer: $157**
