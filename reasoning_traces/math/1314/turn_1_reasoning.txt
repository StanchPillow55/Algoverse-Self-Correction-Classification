Question ID: 1314
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step.

1. **Determine Dora's current age**:
   - Dora will turn 12 in 3 years. Therefore, her current age is:
     \[
     12 - 3 = 9 \text{ years old}
     \]

2. **Determine James's current age**:
   - We know that James is currently twice as old as Dora. Since Dora is 9 years old, James's age is:
     \[
     2 \times 9 = 18 \text{ years old}
     \]

3. **Determine John's age**:
   - John had James when he was 19. Since James is currently 18 years old, we can find John's current age by adding James's age to the age John was when James was born:
     \[
     19 + 18 = 37 \text{ years old}
     \]

4. **Determine the age of John's youngest son**:
   - John had his youngest son when he was 32. To find the current age of the youngest son, we calculate how many years have passed since John was 32:
     \[
     37 - 32 = 5 \text{ years ago}
     \]
   - Therefore, John's youngest son is currently:
     \[
     0 + 5 = 5 \text{ years old}
     \]

5. **Determine how old the youngest son will be in 3 years**:
   - In 3 years, the youngest son will be:
     \[
     5 + 3 = 8 \text{ years old}
     \]

Finally, the answer to the question is:
\[
\boxed{8}
\]
