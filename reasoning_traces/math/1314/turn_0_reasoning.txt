==================================================

To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step.

1. **Determine Dora's Current Age:**
   - We know that Dora will turn 12 in 3 years. 
   - Therefore, her current age is:
     \[
     12 - 3 = 9 \text{ years old}
     \]

2. **Determine James's Current Age:**
   - We are told that James is currently twice as old as Dora.
   - Since Dora is 9 years old, James's age is:
     \[
     2 \times 9 = 18 \text{ years old}
     \]

3. **Determine John's Age:**
   - John had James when he was 19 years old. 
   - Since James is currently 18 years old, we can find John's current age by adding James's age to the age John was when James was born:
     \[
     19 + 18 = 37 \text{ years old}
     \]

4. **Determine the Age of John's Youngest Son:**
   - We know that John's youngest son was born when John was 32 years old.
   - Since John is currently 37 years old, the age of his youngest son is:
     \[
     37 - 32 = 5 \text{ years old}
     \]

5. **Determine the Age of John's Youngest Son in 3 Years:**
   - To find out how old John's youngest son will be in 3 years, we add 3 years to his current age:
     \[
     5 + 3 = 8 \text{ years old}
     \]

Thus, the final answer is that John's youngest son will be **8 years old** in 3 years.
