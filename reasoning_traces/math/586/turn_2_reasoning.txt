Question ID: 586
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To determine how much water Hannah needs to drink, we first need to calculate the total number of calories she burns during her workouts.

1. **Calculate calories burned during aerobics:**
   - Hannah spends 2 hours doing aerobics.
   - The calorie burn rate for aerobics is 500 calories per hour.
   \[
   \text{Calories burned during aerobics} = 2 \, \text{hours} \times 500 \, \text{calories/hour} = 1000 \, \text{calories}
   \]

2. **Calculate calories burned while running:**
   - Hannah spends 1 hour running.
   - The calorie burn rate for running is 600 calories per hour.
   \[
   \text{Calories burned while running} = 1 \, \text{hour} \times 600 \, \text{calories/hour} = 600 \, \text{calories}
   \]

3. **Calculate total calories burned:**
   - Now, we add the calories burned from both activities.
   \[
   \text{Total calories burned} = 1000 \, \text{calories (aerobics)} + 600 \, \text{calories (running)} = 1600 \, \text{calories}
   \]

4. **Calculate the amount of water needed:**
   - Hannah needs to drink 100 ml of water for every 200 calories burned.
   - First, we find out how many 200-calorie increments are in 1600 calories.
   \[
   \text{Number of 200-calorie increments} = \frac{1600 \, \text{calories}}{200 \, \text{calories}} = 8
   \]
   - Since she needs 100 ml of water for each increment:
   \[
   \text{Total water needed} = 8 \times 100 \, \text{ml} = 800 \, \text{ml}
   \]

Thus, the total amount of water Hannah needs to drink is **800 ml**. 

**Final Answer: 800 ml**
