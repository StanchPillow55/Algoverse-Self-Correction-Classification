Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To determine how much water Hannah needs to drink based on the calories she burns, we will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total calories burned during aerobics.**
   - Hannah spends 2 hours doing aerobics.
   - The rate of calories burned during aerobics is 500 calories per hour.
   - Total calories burned during aerobics = (calories burned per hour) × (number of hours)
   \[
   \text{Calories burned during aerobics} = 500 \, \text{calories/hour} \times 2 \, \text{hours} = 1000 \, \text{calories}
   \]

2. **Calculate the total calories burned while running.**
   - Hannah spends 1 hour running.
   - The rate of calories burned while running is 600 calories per hour.
   - Total calories burned while running = (calories burned per hour) × (number of hours)
   \[
   \text{Calories burned while running} = 600 \, \text{calories/hour} \times 1 \, \text{hour} = 600 \, \text{calories}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total calories burned from both activities.**
   - Total calories burned = (calories burned during aerobics) + (calories burned while running)
   \[
   \text{Total calories burned} = 1000 \, \text{calories} + 600 \, \text{calories} = 1600 \, \text{calories}
   \]

4. **Determine the amount of water needed based on the calories burned.**
   - Hannah needs to drink 100 ml of water for every 200 calories burned.
   - To find out how many 200-calorie portions are in 1600 calories, we divide the total calories by 200.
   \[
   \text{Number of 200-calorie portions} = \frac{1600 \, \text{calories}}{200 \, \text{calories/portion}} = 8 \, \text{portions}
   \]

5. **Calculate the total amount of water needed.**
   - Since she needs 100 ml of water for each 200-calorie portion, we multiply the number of portions by 100 ml.
   \[
   \text{Total water needed} = 8 \, \text{portions} \times 100 \, \text{ml/portion} = 800 \, \text{ml}
   \]

Thus, the final answer is that Hannah needs to drink **800 ml** of water.
