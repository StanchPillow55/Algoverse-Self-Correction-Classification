To determine how much water Hannah needs to drink, we first need to calculate the total number of calories she burns during her workouts.

1. **Calculate calories burned during aerobics:**
   - Hannah spends 2 hours doing aerobics.
   - The rate of calories burned during aerobics is 500 calories per hour.
   - Total calories burned during aerobics = (calories burned per hour) × (number of hours)
   \[
   \text{Calories burned during aerobics} = 500 \, \text{calories/hour} \times 2 \, \text{hours} = 1000 \, \text{calories}
   \]

2. **Calculate calories burned while running:**
   - Hannah spends 1 hour running.
   - The rate of calories burned while running is 600 calories per hour.
   - Total calories burned while running = (calories burned per hour) × (number of hours)
   \[
   \text{Calories burned while running} = 600 \, \text{calories/hour} \times 1 \, \text{hour} = 600 \, \text{calories}
   \]

3. **Calculate total calories burned:**
   - Now, we add the calories burned from both activities.
   \[
   \text{Total calories burned} = \text{Calories burned during aerobics} + \text{Calories burned while running}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total calories burned} = 1000 \, \text{calories} + 600 \, \text{calories} = 1600 \, \text{calories}
   \]

4. **Calculate the amount of water needed:**
   - Hannah needs to drink 100 ml of water for every 200 calories burned.
   - First, we find out how many 200 calorie portions are in the total calories burned.
   \[
   \text{Number of 200 calorie portions} = \frac{\text{Total calories burned}}{200}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Number of 200 calorie portions} = \frac{1600 \, \text{calories}}{200 \, \text{calories/portion}} = 8
   \]

5. **Calculate the total amount of water needed:**
   - Since she needs 100 ml of water for each 200 calorie portion, we multiply the number of portions by 100 ml.
   \[
   \text{Total water needed} = \text{Number of 200 calorie portions} \times 100 \, \text{ml}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total water needed} = 8 \times 100 \, \text{ml} = 800 \, \text{ml}
   \]

Thus, the final answer is that Hannah needs to drink **800 ml** of water.
