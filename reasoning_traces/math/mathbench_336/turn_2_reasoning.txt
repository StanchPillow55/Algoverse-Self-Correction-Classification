==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 336," I need more specific information about what the problem entails. Since the problem is not explicitly stated, I'll create a hypothetical math problem involving the number 336 and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**
Find the prime factorization of the number 336.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Identify if 336 is even or odd:**
   - Since 336 ends in 6, it is an even number. Therefore, it is divisible by 2.

2. **Divide 336 by 2:**
   \[
   336 \div 2 = 168
   \]
   - So, 336 = 2 × 168.

3. **Check if 168 is even or odd:**
   - 168 is also even, so it is divisible by 2.

4. **Divide 168 by 2:**
   \[
   168 \div 2 = 84
   \]
   - So, 168 = 2 × 84, and thus 336 = 2 × 2 × 84.

5. **Check if 84 is even or odd:**
   - 84 is even, so it is divisible by 2.

6. **Divide 84 by 2:**
   \[
   84 \div 2 = 42
   \]
   - So, 84 = 2 × 42, and thus 336 = 2 × 2 × 2 × 42.

7. **Check if 42 is even or odd:**
   - 42 is even, so it is divisible by 2.

8. **Divide 42 by 2:**
   \[
   42 \div 2 = 21
   \]
   - So, 42 = 2 × 21, and thus 336 = 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 21.

9. **Check if 21 is divisible by 3:**
   - The sum of the digits of 21 is 2 + 1 = 3, which is divisible by 3. Therefore, 21 is divisible by 3.

10. **Divide 21 by 3:**
    \[
    21 \div 3 = 7
    \]
    - So, 21 = 3 × 7, and thus 336 = 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 3 × 7.

11. **Check if 7 is a prime number:**
    - 7 is a prime number.

**Final Prime Factorization:**
The prime factorization of 336 is:
\[
336 = 2^4 \times 3 \times 7
\]

**Final Answer:**
The prime factorization of 336 is \(2^4 \times 3 \times 7\).
