==================================================

To solve the problem labeled "Sample math problem 336," we need to first understand what the problem is asking. However, the problem statement is not provided here, so I'll need to make some assumptions or create a hypothetical problem to demonstrate the process of solving a math problem step by step.

Let's assume "Sample math problem 336" is a basic algebra problem. Here's a hypothetical problem:

**Problem:** Solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 2x + 5 = 15 \).

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Understand the Equation:**
   The equation given is \( 2x + 5 = 15 \). Our goal is to solve for \( x \).

2. **Isolate the Variable:**
   To solve for \( x \), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We start by eliminating the constant term on the left side of the equation.

   \[
   2x + 5 = 15
   \]

   Subtract 5 from both sides to remove the constant term:

   \[
   2x + 5 - 5 = 15 - 5
   \]

   Simplifying both sides gives:

   \[
   2x = 10
   \]

3. **Solve for \( x \):**
   Now, we need to solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides of the equation by the coefficient of \( x \), which is 2.

   \[
   \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{10}{2}
   \]

   Simplifying both sides gives:

   \[
   x = 5
   \]

4. **Verify the Solution:**
   To ensure our solution is correct, we substitute \( x = 5 \) back into the original equation to verify:

   \[
   2(5) + 5 = 15
   \]

   Simplifying the left side:

   \[
   10 + 5 = 15
   \]

   Since both sides of the equation are equal, our solution \( x = 5 \) is verified.

### Final Answer:
The solution to the equation \( 2x + 5 = 15 \) is \( x = 5 \).

This is a basic example of solving a linear equation. If "Sample math problem 336" refers to a different type of problem, please provide the specific details or context, and I can adjust the solution accordingly.
