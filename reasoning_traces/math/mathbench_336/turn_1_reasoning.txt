==================================================

To solve the problem, we first need to understand what "Sample math problem 336" refers to. Since the problem is not explicitly stated, I'll assume it involves a common type of math problem. Let's consider a typical math problem that might be labeled as "Sample math problem 336" and solve it step by step.

**Problem Assumption:**
Let's assume "Sample math problem 336" is a problem involving basic algebra, such as solving a linear equation. For example:

Solve for \( x \) in the equation:
\[ 3x + 5 = 20 \]

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Equation:**
   The given equation is \( 3x + 5 = 20 \). Our goal is to solve for \( x \).

2. **Isolate the Variable:**
   To isolate \( x \), we need to get rid of the constant term on the left side of the equation. We do this by subtracting 5 from both sides:
   \[
   3x + 5 - 5 = 20 - 5
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   3x = 15
   \]

3. **Solve for \( x \):**
   Now, we need to solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides of the equation by 3:
   \[
   \frac{3x}{3} = \frac{15}{3}
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   x = 5
   \]

4. **Verify the Solution:**
   To ensure our solution is correct, we substitute \( x = 5 \) back into the original equation:
   \[
   3(5) + 5 = 20
   \]
   Simplifying the left side gives:
   \[
   15 + 5 = 20
   \]
   \[
   20 = 20
   \]
   Since both sides of the equation are equal, our solution is verified.

**Final Answer:**
The solution to the equation \( 3x + 5 = 20 \) is \( x = 5 \).

If "Sample math problem 336" refers to a different type of problem, please provide more details or context, and I can adjust the solution accordingly.
