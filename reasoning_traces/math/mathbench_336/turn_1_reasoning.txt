==================================================

To solve the problem, we first need to understand what "Sample math problem 336" refers to. Since no specific details are provided about the problem, I will create a hypothetical math problem labeled as "Sample math problem 336" and solve it step by step.

**Sample Math Problem 336:**

A rectangle has a length that is 4 times its width. If the perimeter of the rectangle is 100 units, find the dimensions of the rectangle.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We have a rectangle with a length (L) and a width (W).
   - The length is 4 times the width: \( L = 4W \).
   - The perimeter of the rectangle is 100 units.

2. **Recall the Formula for Perimeter of a Rectangle:**
   - The perimeter (P) of a rectangle is given by the formula:
     \[
     P = 2L + 2W
     \]

3. **Substitute the Known Values:**
   - We know the perimeter is 100 units, so:
     \[
     2L + 2W = 100
     \]

4. **Substitute the Expression for L:**
   - Since \( L = 4W \), substitute \( L \) in the perimeter equation:
     \[
     2(4W) + 2W = 100
     \]

5. **Simplify the Equation:**
   - Simplify the left side:
     \[
     8W + 2W = 100
     \]
   - Combine like terms:
     \[
     10W = 100
     \]

6. **Solve for W:**
   - Divide both sides by 10:
     \[
     W = \frac{100}{10} = 10
     \]

7. **Find the Length L:**
   - Use the expression \( L = 4W \):
     \[
     L = 4 \times 10 = 40
     \]

8. **Verify the Solution:**
   - Check if the dimensions satisfy the perimeter condition:
     \[
     2L + 2W = 2(40) + 2(10) = 80 + 20 = 100
     \]
   - The calculated perimeter matches the given perimeter, confirming the solution is correct.

**Final Answer:**

The dimensions of the rectangle are:
- Width (W) = 10 units
- Length (L) = 40 units
