==================================================

To solve the problem labeled as "Sample math problem 336," we need to first understand what the problem is asking. However, since the problem statement is not provided, I'll create a hypothetical math problem with the number 336 and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**
Find the prime factorization of the number 336.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   We need to express the number 336 as a product of prime numbers.

2. **Start with the Smallest Prime:**
   Begin dividing 336 by the smallest prime number, which is 2, and continue dividing by 2 until it is no longer divisible by 2.

   \[
   336 \div 2 = 168
   \]

   \[
   168 \div 2 = 84
   \]

   \[
   84 \div 2 = 42
   \]

   \[
   42 \div 2 = 21
   \]

   At this point, 21 is not divisible by 2.

3. **Move to the Next Prime Number:**
   The next smallest prime number is 3. Check if 21 is divisible by 3.

   \[
   21 \div 3 = 7
   \]

   Now, we have 7, which is a prime number.

4. **Compile the Prime Factors:**
   The prime factorization of 336 is the product of all the prime numbers we used in the division process:

   \[
   336 = 2^4 \times 3 \times 7
   \]

   Here, \(2^4\) represents the four times we divided by 2.

5. **Verify the Solution:**
   Multiply the prime factors to ensure they equal the original number:

   \[
   2^4 = 16
   \]

   \[
   16 \times 3 = 48
   \]

   \[
   48 \times 7 = 336
   \]

   The multiplication checks out, confirming our factorization is correct.

**Final Answer:**
The prime factorization of 336 is \(2^4 \times 3 \times 7\).
