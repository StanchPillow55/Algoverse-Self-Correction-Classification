==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample math problem 336" refers to. Since the problem itself isn't provided, I'll assume a generic math problem involving the number 336. Let's consider a problem involving the factors of 336, as this is a common type of math problem.

**Problem:** Find all the factors of 336.

**Step-by-step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We need to find all the positive integers that divide 336 without leaving a remainder.

2. **Prime Factorization:**
   - Start by finding the prime factorization of 336.
   - Divide 336 by the smallest prime number, which is 2.

     \[
     336 \div 2 = 168
     \]

   - Divide 168 by 2 again.

     \[
     168 \div 2 = 84
     \]

   - Divide 84 by 2 again.

     \[
     84 \div 2 = 42
     \]

   - Divide 42 by 2 again.

     \[
     42 \div 2 = 21
     \]

   - Now, 21 is not divisible by 2. Move to the next smallest prime number, which is 3.

     \[
     21 \div 3 = 7
     \]

   - Finally, 7 is a prime number.

3. **Write the Prime Factorization:**
   - The prime factorization of 336 is:

     \[
     336 = 2^4 \times 3^1 \times 7^1
     \]

4. **Find All Factors:**
   - To find all factors, consider all combinations of the prime factors.
   - Use the formula for finding the number of factors: If \( n = p^a \times q^b \times r^c \), then the number of factors is \((a+1)(b+1)(c+1)\).

   - For 336, the number of factors is:

     \[
     (4+1)(1+1)(1+1) = 5 \times 2 \times 2 = 20
     \]

   - List all combinations of the prime factors to find the factors:

     - \( 2^0 \times 3^0 \times 7^0 = 1 \)
     - \( 2^1 \times 3^0 \times 7^0 = 2 \)
     - \( 2^2 \times 3^0 \times 7^0 = 4 \)
     - \( 2^3 \times 3^0 \times 7^0 = 8 \)
     - \( 2^4 \times 3^0 \times 7^0 = 16 \)
     - \( 2^0 \times 3^1 \times 7^0 = 3 \)
     - \( 2^1 \times 3^1 \times 7^0 = 6 \)
     - \( 2^2 \times 3^1 \times 7^0 = 12 \)
     - \( 2^3 \times 3^1 \times 7^0 = 24 \)
     - \( 2^4 \times 3^1 \times 7^0 = 48 \)
     - \( 2^0 \times 3^0 \times 7^1 = 7 \)
     - \( 2^1 \times 3^0 \times 7^1 = 14 \)
     - \( 2^2 \times 3^0 \times 7^1 = 28 \)
     - \( 2^3 \times 3^0 \times 7^1 = 56 \)
     - \( 2^4 \times 3^0 \times 7^1 = 112 \)
     - \( 2^0 \times 3^1 \times 7^1 = 21 \)
     - \( 2^1 \times 3^1 \times 7^1 = 42 \)
     - \( 2^2 \times 3^1 \times 7^1 = 84 \)
     - \( 2^3 \times 3^1 \times 7^1 = 168 \)
     - \( 2^4 \times 3^1 \times 7^1 = 336 \)

5. **Final Answer:**
   - The factors of 336 are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 12, 14, 16, 21, 24, 28, 42, 48, 56, 84, 112, 168, 336.

This completes the problem. The final answer is the list of factors of 336.
