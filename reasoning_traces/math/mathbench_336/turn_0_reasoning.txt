==================================================

It seems like you've mentioned "Sample math problem 336," but without additional context or details, it's unclear what the specific problem is. However, I can guide you through a generic approach to solving a math problem. If you have a specific problem in mind, please provide the details. For now, let's assume a hypothetical math problem and solve it step by step.

### Hypothetical Problem:
Let's assume the problem is: "Solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \)."

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We need to find the value of \( x \) that satisfies the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).

2. **Isolate the Variable:**
   - To solve for \( x \), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We start by eliminating the constant term on the side with \( x \).

3. **Subtract 3 from Both Sides:**
   \[
   2x + 3 - 3 = 11 - 3
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   2x = 8
   \]

4. **Divide by the Coefficient of \( x \):**
   - Now, divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( x \).
   \[
   \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{8}{2}
   \]
   Simplifying gives:
   \[
   x = 4
   \]

5. **Verify the Solution:**
   - Substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies the equation.
   \[
   2(4) + 3 = 11
   \]
   Simplifying the left side:
   \[
   8 + 3 = 11
   \]
   Since both sides of the equation are equal, our solution \( x = 4 \) is verified.

### Final Answer:
The solution to the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \) is \( x = 4 \).

If you have a different or specific problem in mind, please provide the details, and I can help solve that particular problem.
