==================================================

To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the number of votes for candidate A**:
   - Candidate A received 20% of the total votes.
   - The total number of voters is 100.
   - Therefore, the number of votes for candidate A is:
     \[
     \text{Votes for A} = 20\% \times 100 = 0.20 \times 100 = 20 \text{ votes}
     \]

2. **Determine the number of votes for candidate B**:
   - Candidate B received 50% more votes than candidate A.
   - First, we calculate 50% of the votes candidate A received:
     \[
     50\% \text{ of A's votes} = 0.50 \times 20 = 10 \text{ votes}
     \]
   - Now, we add this to the votes candidate A received to find candidate B's total votes:
     \[
     \text{Votes for B} = \text{Votes for A} + 50\% \text{ of A's votes} = 20 + 10 = 30 \text{ votes}
     \]

3. **Determine the number of votes for candidate C**:
   - The total number of votes is 100, and we have already calculated the votes for candidates A and B.
   - The total votes for candidates A and B combined is:
     \[
     \text{Total votes for A and B} = \text{Votes for A} + \text{Votes for B} = 20 + 30 = 50 \text{ votes}
     \]
   - To find the votes for candidate C, we subtract the total votes for A and B from the total number of voters:
     \[
     \text{Votes for C} = \text{Total voters} - \text{Total votes for A and B} = 100 - 50 = 50 \text{ votes}
     \]

4. **Final answer**:
   - Candidate C received 50 votes.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{50}
\]
