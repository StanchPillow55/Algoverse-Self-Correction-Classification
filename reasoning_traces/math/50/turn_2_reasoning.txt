Question ID: 50
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine how many chores Gerald needs to complete each month during the off-season to save up enough money for his baseball supplies.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Determine Total Cost for Baseball Supplies:**
   - Gerald spends $100 per month on baseball supplies.
   - His baseball season lasts for 4 months.
   - Total cost for the season = \( 100 \text{ dollars/month} \times 4 \text{ months} = 400 \text{ dollars} \).

2. **Determine Off-Season Duration:**
   - A year has 12 months.
   - Gerald's baseball season is 4 months long.
   - Off-season duration = \( 12 \text{ months} - 4 \text{ months} = 8 \text{ months} \).

3. **Calculate Monthly Savings Requirement:**
   - Gerald needs to save a total of $400 during the off-season.
   - Monthly savings required = \( \frac{400 \text{ dollars}}{8 \text{ months}} = 50 \text{ dollars/month} \).

4. **Determine Earnings per Chore:**
   - Gerald charges $10 per chore (raking, shoveling, or mowing lawns).

5. **Calculate Number of Chores Needed per Month:**
   - To save $50 per month, the number of chores needed = \( \frac{50 \text{ dollars/month}}{10 \text{ dollars/chore}} = 5 \text{ chores/month} \).

### Conclusion:

Gerald needs to average **5 chores per month** during the off-season to save up enough money for his baseball supplies.
