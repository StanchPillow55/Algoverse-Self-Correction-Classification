==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine how many chores Gerald needs to do each month during the off-season to save up enough money for his baseball supplies.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Determine Total Cost of Baseball Supplies:**
   - Gerald spends $100 per month on baseball supplies.
   - His baseball season lasts for 4 months.
   - Therefore, the total cost for the baseball supplies for the season is:
     \[
     100 \text{ dollars/month} \times 4 \text{ months} = 400 \text{ dollars}
     \]

2. **Determine Off-Season Duration:**
   - The baseball season is 4 months long.
   - A year has 12 months.
   - Therefore, the off-season duration is:
     \[
     12 \text{ months} - 4 \text{ months} = 8 \text{ months}
     \]

3. **Calculate Monthly Savings Requirement:**
   - Gerald needs to save a total of $400 during the off-season.
   - He has 8 months to save this amount.
   - Therefore, the amount he needs to save each month is:
     \[
     \frac{400 \text{ dollars}}{8 \text{ months}} = 50 \text{ dollars/month}
     \]

4. **Determine Number of Chores Needed Per Month:**
   - Gerald charges $10 per chore.
   - To save $50 each month, the number of chores he needs to do is:
     \[
     \frac{50 \text{ dollars/month}}{10 \text{ dollars/chore}} = 5 \text{ chores/month}
     \]

### Conclusion:
Gerald needs to average **5 chores per month** during the off-season to save up for his baseball supplies.
