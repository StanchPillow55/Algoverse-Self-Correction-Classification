==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine how many chores Gerald needs to perform each month during the off-season to save up enough money for his baseball supplies.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Determine Total Cost of Baseball Supplies:**
   - Gerald spends $100 per month on baseball supplies.
   - His baseball season lasts 4 months.
   - Therefore, the total cost for the baseball supplies for the entire season is:
     \[
     100 \, \text{dollars/month} \times 4 \, \text{months} = 400 \, \text{dollars}
     \]

2. **Determine Off-Season Duration:**
   - A year has 12 months.
   - Gerald's baseball season is 4 months long.
   - Therefore, the off-season lasts:
     \[
     12 \, \text{months} - 4 \, \text{months} = 8 \, \text{months}
     \]

3. **Calculate Monthly Savings Requirement:**
   - Gerald needs to save a total of $400 during the 8-month off-season.
   - To find out how much he needs to save each month, we divide the total amount by the number of off-season months:
     \[
     \frac{400 \, \text{dollars}}{8 \, \text{months}} = 50 \, \text{dollars/month}
     \]

4. **Determine Number of Chores Needed Per Month:**
   - Gerald charges $10 per chore.
   - To find out how many chores he needs to do each month to save $50, we divide the monthly savings requirement by the amount he earns per chore:
     \[
     \frac{50 \, \text{dollars/month}}{10 \, \text{dollars/chore}} = 5 \, \text{chores/month}
     \]

### Final Answer:
Gerald needs to average **5 chores per month** during the off-season to save up for his baseball supplies.
