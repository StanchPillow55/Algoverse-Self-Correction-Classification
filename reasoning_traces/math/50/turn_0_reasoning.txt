==================================================

First, we need to calculate how much Gerald spends on baseball supplies for the entire season. Since he spends $100 a month and the season is 4 months long, we multiply $100 by 4. 

$100 * 4 = $400

So, Gerald spends $400 on baseball supplies for the entire season. 

Next, we need to figure out how many months Gerald has to save up for his supplies. Since there are 12 months in a year and his baseball season is 4 months long, we subtract 4 from 12. 

12 - 4 = 8

So, Gerald has 8 months to save up for his supplies. 

Now, we need to figure out how much Gerald needs to save each month. Since he needs to save $400 in 8 months, we divide $400 by 8. 

$400 / 8 = $50

So, Gerald needs to save $50 a month. 

Finally, we need to figure out how many chores Gerald needs to do each month to save $50. Since he charges $10 for each chore, we divide $50 by $10. 

$50 / $10 = 5

So, Gerald needs to average 5 chores a month to save up for his baseball supplies. 

Final Answer: Gerald needs to average 5 chores a month.
