==================================================

To determine how much Lloyd makes on eggs per week, we will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of eggs produced per week**:
   - Lloyd's chickens produce 252 eggs per day.
   - There are 7 days in a week.
   - Therefore, the total number of eggs produced in a week is:
     \[
     \text{Total eggs per week} = \text{Eggs per day} \times \text{Days per week} = 252 \, \text{eggs/day} \times 7 \, \text{days/week}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total eggs per week} = 252 \times 7 = 1764 \, \text{eggs}
     \]

2. **Calculate the number of dozens of eggs produced per week**:
   - Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we need to find out how many dozens are in 1764 eggs:
     \[
     \text{Dozens of eggs} = \frac{\text{Total eggs}}{12} = \frac{1764}{12}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Dozens of eggs} = 147
     \]

3. **Calculate the total revenue from selling the eggs**:
   - Lloyd sells the eggs for $2 per dozen.
   - Therefore, the total revenue from selling 147 dozens of eggs is:
     \[
     \text{Total revenue} = \text{Dozens of eggs} \times \text{Price per dozen} = 147 \times 2
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total revenue} = 294
     \]

4. **Conclusion**:
   - Lloyd makes $294 from selling eggs per week.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{294}
\]
