To determine how many chores Gerald needs to average per month to save up for his baseball supplies, we can break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate Total Expenses for Baseball Supplies**:
   Gerald spends $100 a month on baseball supplies, and his season lasts for 4 months. Therefore, the total amount he spends on baseball supplies during the season is calculated as follows:

   \[
   \text{Total Expenses} = \text{Monthly Expense} \times \text{Number of Months}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total Expenses} = 100 \, \text{dollars/month} \times 4 \, \text{months} = 400 \, \text{dollars}
   \]

2. **Determine the Months Available for Chores**:
   Since Gerald plays baseball for 4 months, he has the remaining months of the year to save up. Assuming a year has 12 months, the number of months he is not playing baseball is:

   \[
   \text{Months Not Playing} = 12 \, \text{months} - 4 \, \text{months} = 8 \, \text{months}
   \]

3. **Calculate How Much He Needs to Save Each Month**:
   To save up the total amount of $400 over the 8 months he is not playing baseball, we need to find out how much he needs to save each month:

   \[
   \text{Monthly Savings Required} = \frac{\text{Total Expenses}}{\text{Months Not Playing}}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Monthly Savings Required} = \frac{400 \, \text{dollars}}{8 \, \text{months}} = 50 \, \text{dollars/month}
   \]

4. **Determine How Many Chores He Needs to Do**:
   Gerald charges $10 for each chore he completes. To find out how many chores he needs to do each month to save $50, we can set up the following equation:

   \[
   \text{Number of Chores} = \frac{\text{Monthly Savings Required}}{\text{Charge per Chore}}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Number of Chores} = \frac{50 \, \text{dollars}}{10 \, \text{dollars/chore}} = 5 \, \text{chores}
   \]

5. **Final Answer**:
   Therefore, Gerald needs to average **5 chores per month** to save up enough money for his baseball supplies.

**Final Answer**: 5 chores per month.
