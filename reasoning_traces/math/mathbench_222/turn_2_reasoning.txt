Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample math problem 222" refers to. Since the problem itself is not specified, I'll create a hypothetical math problem with the number 222 and solve it step by step.

Let's assume the problem is as follows:

**Problem:**
Calculate the sum of the digits of the number 222, and then multiply the result by 3. What is the final result?

**Step-by-step Solution:**

1. **Identify the digits of the number 222:**
   - The number 222 consists of three digits: 2, 2, and 2.

2. **Calculate the sum of the digits:**
   - Add the digits together: \(2 + 2 + 2\).
   - Perform the addition: 
     \[
     2 + 2 = 4
     \]
     \[
     4 + 2 = 6
     \]
   - The sum of the digits is 6.

3. **Multiply the sum by 3:**
   - Take the sum (6) and multiply it by 3:
     \[
     6 \times 3 = 18
     \]

4. **Final Result:**
   - The final result after multiplying the sum of the digits by 3 is 18.

**Conclusion:**
The final answer to the problem is 18.
