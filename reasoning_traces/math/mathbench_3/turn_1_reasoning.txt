==================================================

To solve the problem effectively, I need to first understand what "Sample math problem 3" entails. Since the problem is not specified, I'll create a hypothetical math problem and solve it step-by-step. Let's assume the problem is as follows:

**Problem:**  
Solve for \( x \) in the equation:  
\[ 3x + 5 = 20 \]

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Equation:**
   The equation given is a linear equation in one variable, \( x \). The goal is to isolate \( x \) on one side of the equation to find its value.

2. **Isolate the Variable:**
   To isolate \( x \), we need to eliminate the constant term on the left side of the equation. The constant term here is \( 5 \).

3. **Subtract 5 from Both Sides:**
   \[
   3x + 5 - 5 = 20 - 5
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   3x = 15
   \]

4. **Solve for \( x \):**
   Now, divide both sides of the equation by the coefficient of \( x \), which is \( 3 \), to solve for \( x \).
   \[
   \frac{3x}{3} = \frac{15}{3}
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   x = 5
   \]

5. **Verify the Solution:**
   Substitute \( x = 5 \) back into the original equation to verify the solution:
   \[
   3(5) + 5 = 20
   \]
   \[
   15 + 5 = 20
   \]
   \[
   20 = 20
   \]
   The left side equals the right side, confirming that the solution is correct.

**Final Answer:**
The value of \( x \) is \( 5 \).
