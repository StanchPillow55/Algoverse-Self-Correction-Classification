==================================================

To solve the problem effectively, I need to first understand what "Sample math problem 3" entails. Since the problem is not explicitly provided, I'll create a hypothetical math problem to demonstrate the process of solving it step by step. Let's assume "Sample math problem 3" is a typical algebra problem:

**Problem:** Solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).

**Step 1: Understand the Problem**
The equation given is a linear equation in one variable, \( x \). Our goal is to isolate \( x \) on one side of the equation to find its value.

**Step 2: Isolate the Variable**
To isolate \( x \), we need to perform operations that will leave \( x \) by itself on one side of the equation.

1. **Subtract 3 from both sides:**
   \[
   2x + 3 - 3 = 11 - 3
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   2x = 8
   \]

2. **Divide both sides by 2:**
   \[
   \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{8}{2}
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   x = 4
   \]

**Step 3: Verify the Solution**
Substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies the equation:
\[
2(4) + 3 = 11
\]
\[
8 + 3 = 11
\]
\[
11 = 11
\]
The left-hand side equals the right-hand side, confirming that \( x = 4 \) is indeed the correct solution.

**Step 4: State the Final Answer**
The solution to the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \) is \( x = 4 \).

This step-by-step approach ensures that we have thoroughly solved the problem and verified the solution. If you have a specific "Sample math problem 3" in mind, please provide the details, and I can solve that particular problem for you.
