==================================================

To solve the problem effectively, I'll need the specific details of "Sample math problem 3" as it is not provided in your request. However, I can guide you through a general approach to solving math problems step by step. If you provide the actual problem, I can give a more precise solution. Here's a general framework:

### Step-by-Step Approach to Solving Math Problems

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - Carefully read the problem statement.
   - Identify what is being asked.
   - Note down any given information or data.

2. **Devise a Plan:**
   - Determine the type of problem (e.g., algebra, geometry, calculus).
   - Decide on the method or formula needed to solve the problem.
   - Consider drawing diagrams or making lists if it helps visualize the problem.

3. **Carry Out the Plan:**
   - Execute the steps needed to solve the problem.
   - Perform calculations carefully.
   - Keep track of units and conversion factors if applicable.

4. **Review/Check Your Work:**
   - Verify each step to ensure no mistakes were made.
   - Check if the solution makes sense in the context of the problem.
   - Re-calculate if necessary to confirm accuracy.

5. **State the Final Answer:**
   - Clearly write down the final answer.
   - Include units if applicable.

### Example Problem and Solution

Let's assume a sample problem: "Solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \)."

**Step 1: Understand the Problem**
- We need to find the value of \( x \) that satisfies the equation.

**Step 2: Devise a Plan**
- This is a simple linear equation. We can solve it by isolating \( x \).

**Step 3: Carry Out the Plan**
- Start by subtracting 3 from both sides of the equation:
  \[
  2x + 3 - 3 = 11 - 3
  \]
  \[
  2x = 8
  \]
- Next, divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( x \):
  \[
  \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{8}{2}
  \]
  \[
  x = 4
  \]

**Step 4: Review/Check Your Work**
- Substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation to verify:
  \[
  2(4) + 3 = 8 + 3 = 11
  \]
- The left-hand side equals the right-hand side, confirming our solution is correct.

**Step 5: State the Final Answer**
- The solution to the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \) is \( x = 4 \).

If you provide the specific details of "Sample math problem 3," I can apply this structured approach to solve it accurately.
