To solve the problem, I'll need more specific information about "Sample math problem 3." Since the problem is not provided, I'll create a sample math problem and solve it step by step.

**Sample Math Problem:**

A rectangle has a length that is twice its width. If the perimeter of the rectangle is 36 units, what are the dimensions of the rectangle?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We need to find the dimensions (length and width) of a rectangle.
   - The length (L) is twice the width (W).
   - The perimeter (P) of the rectangle is 36 units.

2. **Set Up the Equations:**
   - The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is \( P = 2L + 2W \).
   - We know \( L = 2W \) (since the length is twice the width).
   - Substitute \( L = 2W \) into the perimeter formula:
     \[
     2(2W) + 2W = 36
     \]

3. **Simplify and Solve for W:**
   - Simplify the equation:
     \[
     4W + 2W = 36
     \]
   - Combine like terms:
     \[
     6W = 36
     \]
   - Divide both sides by 6 to solve for W:
     \[
     W = 6
     \]

4. **Find the Length (L):**
   - Since \( L = 2W \), substitute \( W = 6 \) into the equation for L:
     \[
     L = 2 \times 6 = 12
     \]

5. **Verify the Solution:**
   - Check the perimeter with the found dimensions:
     \[
     P = 2L + 2W = 2(12) + 2(6) = 24 + 12 = 36
     \]
   - The calculated perimeter matches the given perimeter, confirming our solution is correct.

**Final Answer:**
The dimensions of the rectangle are:
- Width (W) = 6 units
- Length (L) = 12 units
