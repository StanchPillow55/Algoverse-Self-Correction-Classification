Question ID: superglue_61
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, I need more information about "Sample reasoning question 61." Since the problem statement is missing, I will provide a general approach to solving math problems step by step. If you have a specific problem in mind, please provide the details, and I will work through it accordingly.

### General Approach to Solving Math Problems:

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - Read the problem carefully.
   - Identify what is being asked.
   - Determine the information given and what needs to be found.

2. **Devise a Plan:**
   - Think about the strategies that could be used to solve the problem (e.g., algebraic manipulation, drawing a diagram, logical reasoning, etc.).
   - Choose the most appropriate method based on the problem type.

3. **Carry Out the Plan:**
   - Execute the chosen strategy step by step.
   - Perform calculations carefully and check each step for accuracy.
   - Keep track of units and ensure consistency throughout the solution.

4. **Review/Check the Solution:**
   - Verify that the solution answers the question posed.
   - Check calculations for errors.
   - Consider whether the answer is reasonable and makes sense in the context of the problem.

5. **State the Final Answer:**
   - Clearly write the final answer, including units if applicable.

### Example Problem:

Let's apply this approach to a sample math problem:

**Problem:** Solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).

**Step 1: Understand the Problem**
- We need to find the value of \( x \) that satisfies the equation.

**Step 2: Devise a Plan**
- Use algebraic manipulation to isolate \( x \).

**Step 3: Carry Out the Plan**
- Start with the equation: \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).
- Subtract 3 from both sides to isolate the term with \( x \):
  \[
  2x + 3 - 3 = 11 - 3
  \]
  \[
  2x = 8
  \]
- Divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( x \):
  \[
  x = \frac{8}{2}
  \]
  \[
  x = 4
  \]

**Step 4: Review/Check the Solution**
- Substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation to verify:
  \[
  2(4) + 3 = 8 + 3 = 11
  \]
- The left side equals the right side, confirming the solution is correct.

**Step 5: State the Final Answer**
- The solution to the equation is \( x = 4 \).
