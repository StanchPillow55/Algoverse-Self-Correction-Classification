==================================================

To solve the problem effectively, I need more specific information about "Sample reasoning question 61." Since the question isn't provided, I'll demonstrate how to approach a typical math reasoning problem by creating an example problem and solving it step-by-step.

**Example Problem:**

A train travels from City A to City B at a speed of 60 miles per hour. After reaching City B, it immediately returns to City A at a speed of 40 miles per hour. The total travel time for the round trip is 5 hours. What is the distance between City A and City B?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( d \) be the distance between City A and City B in miles.

2. **Determine Time for Each Leg of the Trip:**
   - Time taken to travel from City A to City B at 60 mph is \( \frac{d}{60} \) hours.
   - Time taken to return from City B to City A at 40 mph is \( \frac{d}{40} \) hours.

3. **Set Up the Equation:**
   - The total travel time for the round trip is given as 5 hours.
   - Therefore, the equation is:
     \[
     \frac{d}{60} + \frac{d}{40} = 5
     \]

4. **Solve the Equation:**
   - To solve the equation, find a common denominator for the fractions. The least common multiple of 60 and 40 is 120.
   - Rewrite the equation with a common denominator:
     \[
     \frac{2d}{120} + \frac{3d}{120} = 5
     \]
   - Combine the fractions:
     \[
     \frac{5d}{120} = 5
     \]
   - Multiply both sides by 120 to eliminate the fraction:
     \[
     5d = 600
     \]
   - Divide both sides by 5 to solve for \( d \):
     \[
     d = 120
     \]

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The distance between City A and City B is 120 miles.

**Final Answer:**
The distance between City A and City B is 120 miles.

This example illustrates how to approach a math reasoning problem by defining variables, setting up an equation based on the problem's conditions, and solving the equation step-by-step. If you have a specific problem in mind, please provide the details, and I can work through that problem in a similar manner.
