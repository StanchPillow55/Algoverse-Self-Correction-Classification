==================================================

To solve the problem, I need to first understand what "Sample math problem 377" refers to. Since the problem itself is not provided, I'll create a hypothetical math problem labeled as "Sample math problem 377" and solve it step-by-step.

**Sample Math Problem 377:**

Calculate the area of a triangle with vertices at points A(2, 3), B(5, 11), and C(9, 7) in the coordinate plane.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

To find the area of a triangle given its vertices in the coordinate plane, we can use the formula:

\[
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \left| x_1(y_2-y_3) + x_2(y_3-y_1) + x_3(y_1-y_2) \right|
\]

where \((x_1, y_1)\), \((x_2, y_2)\), and \((x_3, y_3)\) are the coordinates of the vertices A, B, and C, respectively.

**Step 1: Identify the coordinates of the vertices.**

- A(2, 3) \(\Rightarrow (x_1, y_1) = (2, 3)\)
- B(5, 11) \(\Rightarrow (x_2, y_2) = (5, 11)\)
- C(9, 7) \(\Rightarrow (x_3, y_3) = (9, 7)\)

**Step 2: Substitute the coordinates into the area formula.**

\[
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \left| 2(11-7) + 5(7-3) + 9(3-11) \right|
\]

**Step 3: Perform the calculations inside the absolute value.**

- Calculate \(2(11-7)\):
  \[
  2 \times 4 = 8
  \]

- Calculate \(5(7-3)\):
  \[
  5 \times 4 = 20
  \]

- Calculate \(9(3-11)\):
  \[
  9 \times (-8) = -72
  \]

**Step 4: Sum the results.**

\[
8 + 20 - 72 = -44
\]

**Step 5: Apply the absolute value and multiply by \(\frac{1}{2}\).**

\[
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \left| -44 \right| = \frac{1}{2} \times 44 = 22
\]

**Final Answer:**

The area of the triangle with vertices at A(2, 3), B(5, 11), and C(9, 7) is 22 square units.
