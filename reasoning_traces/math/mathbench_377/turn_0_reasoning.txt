==================================================

It seems like there is a misunderstanding or missing information because "Sample math problem 377" does not specify any particular math problem or context. To help you effectively, I need a clear and specific math problem to solve. 

If you have a specific math problem in mind, please provide the details, and I will be happy to work through it step by step, showing all calculations and reasoning.
