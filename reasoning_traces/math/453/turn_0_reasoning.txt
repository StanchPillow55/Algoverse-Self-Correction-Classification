==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of shells collected by Jillian, Savannah, and Clayton.**
   - Jillian collected 29 shells.
   - Savannah collected 17 shells.
   - Clayton collected 8 shells.

   We can find the total by adding these amounts together:

   \[
   \text{Total shells} = 29 + 17 + 8
   \]

   Let's perform the addition step by step:

   - First, add Jillian's and Savannah's shells:
     \[
     29 + 17 = 46
     \]

   - Now, add Clayton's shells to this total:
     \[
     46 + 8 = 54
     \]

   Therefore, the total number of shells collected is **54**.

2. **Distribute the total number of shells evenly to the two friends.**
   - Since they want to give the shells to two friends, we need to divide the total number of shells by 2:

   \[
   \text{Shells per friend} = \frac{\text{Total shells}}{2} = \frac{54}{2}
   \]

   Performing the division:

   \[
   \frac{54}{2} = 27
   \]

   Therefore, each friend receives **27 shells**.

3. **Final Answer:**
   Each friend gets **27 shells**.
