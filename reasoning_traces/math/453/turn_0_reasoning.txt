==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of shells collected by Jillian, Savannah, and Clayton, and then divide that total evenly between the two friends.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of shells collected.**

- Jillian collected 29 shells.
- Savannah collected 17 shells.
- Clayton collected 8 shells.

To find the total number of shells, we add the number of shells each person collected:

\[
29 + 17 + 8
\]

First, add 29 and 17:

\[
29 + 17 = 46
\]

Next, add the result to Clayton's 8 shells:

\[
46 + 8 = 54
\]

So, the total number of shells collected by Jillian, Savannah, and Clayton is 54.

**Step 2: Distribute the shells evenly between the two friends.**

Since the total number of shells is 54 and they want to distribute them evenly to two friends, we divide the total number of shells by 2:

\[
\frac{54}{2} = 27
\]

**Conclusion:**

Each friend receives 27 shells. Therefore, the final answer is that each friend gets 27 shells.
