==================================================

To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step.

1. **Count the spiders**: 
   Nancy saw 90 spiders.

2. **Calculate the number of millipedes**: 
   According to the problem, there are 1/3 as many millipedes as spiders. 
   \[
   \text{Number of millipedes} = \frac{1}{3} \times \text{Number of spiders} = \frac{1}{3} \times 90 = 30
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of stink bugs**: 
   The problem states that the number of stink bugs is equal to twice the number of millipedes minus 12. 
   \[
   \text{Number of stink bugs} = 2 \times \text{Number of millipedes} - 12 = 2 \times 30 - 12
   \]
   First, calculate \(2 \times 30\):
   \[
   2 \times 30 = 60
   \]
   Now, subtract 12:
   \[
   60 - 12 = 48
   \]
   So, there are 48 stink bugs.

4. **Calculate the total number of bugs**: 
   Now we will sum the number of spiders, millipedes, and stink bugs to find the total number of bugs.
   \[
   \text{Total number of bugs} = \text{Number of spiders} + \text{Number of millipedes} + \text{Number of stink bugs}
   \]
   Plugging in the values we calculated:
   \[
   \text{Total number of bugs} = 90 + 30 + 48
   \]
   Now, perform the addition:
   \[
   90 + 30 = 120
   \]
   \[
   120 + 48 = 168
   \]

Thus, the total number of bugs that Nancy counted is \(\boxed{168}\).
