==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to determine how much money the girl scouts will have left after paying for the pool.

1. **Calculate the total cost for the pool:**
   The cost per person to go to the pool is $2.50, and there are 10 people going. We can find the total cost by multiplying the cost per person by the number of people:

   \[
   \text{Total Cost} = \text{Cost per person} \times \text{Number of people}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total Cost} = 2.50 \times 10
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total Cost} = 25.00
   \]

2. **Determine the total amount earned from cookie sales:**
   The girl scouts earned a total of $30 from selling cookies.

3. **Calculate the amount left after paying for the pool:**
   To find out how much money is left after the pool expenses, we subtract the total cost of the pool from the total amount earned:

   \[
   \text{Amount Left} = \text{Total Earned} - \text{Total Cost}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Amount Left} = 30.00 - 25.00
   \]
   \[
   \text{Amount Left} = 5.00
   \]

4. **Final Answer:**
   The amount left after the girl scouts pay for the pool is **$5.00**.
