To solve this problem, we need to determine how much money the girl scouts will have left after paying for the pool entry for 10 people.

**Step 1: Calculate the total cost for 10 people to go to the pool.**

The cost per person to go to the pool is $2.50. Since 10 people are going, we need to multiply the cost per person by the number of people:

\[
\text{Total cost} = \text{Cost per person} \times \text{Number of people}
\]

\[
\text{Total cost} = 2.50 \times 10
\]

\[
\text{Total cost} = 25.00
\]

So, the total cost for 10 people to go to the pool is $25.00.

**Step 2: Calculate the amount of money left after paying for the pool.**

The girl scouts initially earned $30.00 from selling cookies. After paying $25.00 for the pool, we subtract the total cost from the initial amount:

\[
\text{Amount left} = \text{Initial amount} - \text{Total cost}
\]

\[
\text{Amount left} = 30.00 - 25.00
\]

\[
\text{Amount left} = 5.00
\]

Therefore, after paying for the pool, the girl scouts will have $5.00 left.

**Final Answer:**

The amount left after paying for the pool is $5.00.
