==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 139" refers to. Since the problem statement doesn't provide specific details about the question, I'll demonstrate how to approach a typical math problem by creating a hypothetical example and solving it step by step.

Let's assume "Sample reasoning question 139" is a math problem involving algebra. Here's a hypothetical problem:

**Problem:**
Solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 3x + 5 = 20 \).

**Step-by-step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Equation:**
   The equation given is \( 3x + 5 = 20 \). Our goal is to solve for \( x \).

2. **Isolate the Variable:**
   To solve for \( x \), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We start by eliminating the constant term on the left side of the equation.

   Subtract 5 from both sides:
   \[
   3x + 5 - 5 = 20 - 5
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   3x = 15
   \]

3. **Solve for \( x \):**
   Now, we need to solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides of the equation by the coefficient of \( x \), which is 3.

   Divide both sides by 3:
   \[
   \frac{3x}{3} = \frac{15}{3}
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   x = 5
   \]

4. **Verify the Solution:**
   To ensure our solution is correct, we substitute \( x = 5 \) back into the original equation to check if it satisfies the equation.

   Substitute \( x = 5 \) into \( 3x + 5 = 20 \):
   \[
   3(5) + 5 = 20
   \]
   Simplifying the left side gives:
   \[
   15 + 5 = 20
   \]
   \[
   20 = 20
   \]
   Since both sides of the equation are equal, our solution is verified.

**Final Answer:**
The solution to the equation \( 3x + 5 = 20 \) is \( x = 5 \).

This example demonstrates a structured approach to solving an algebraic equation. If "Sample reasoning question 139" refers to a different type of problem, please provide additional details for a more specific solution.
