First, let's calculate how much James sells each DVD for. He sells each DVD for 2.5 times the cost to make it, which is $6. 

2.5 * $6 = $15

So, each DVD is sold for $15. 

Next, let's calculate how much profit he makes from selling one DVD. The profit from selling one DVD is the selling price minus the cost to make it. 

$15 - $6 = $9

So, he makes a profit of $9 from each DVD.

Now, let's calculate how much profit he makes in a week. He sells 500 DVDs a day for 5 days a week, so he sells 500 * 5 = 2500 DVDs in a week.

The profit from selling 2500 DVDs is 2500 * $9 = $22,500.

Now, let's calculate how much profit he makes in 20 weeks. The profit from 20 weeks is 20 * $22,500 = $450,000.

However, we have to subtract the cost of creating the movie, which is $2000. 

So, the total profit James makes in 20 weeks is $450,000 - $2000 = $448,000.

Therefore, James makes a profit of $448,000 in 20 weeks.
