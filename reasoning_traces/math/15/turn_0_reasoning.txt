To find out how much profit James makes in 20 weeks from his media empire, we will break down the problem step by step.

### Step 1: Calculate the Selling Price of Each DVD
James sells each DVD for 2.5 times the cost to make it. The cost to make each DVD is $6.

\[
\text{Selling Price} = 2.5 \times \text{Cost Price} = 2.5 \times 6 = 15
\]

So, the selling price of each DVD is **$15**.

### Step 2: Calculate the Profit per DVD
To find the profit per DVD, we subtract the cost to make the DVD from the selling price.

\[
\text{Profit per DVD} = \text{Selling Price} - \text{Cost Price} = 15 - 6 = 9
\]

Thus, the profit per DVD is **$9**.

### Step 3: Calculate the Total Profit per Day
James sells 500 DVDs each day. Therefore, the total profit per day can be calculated by multiplying the profit per DVD by the number of DVDs sold.

\[
\text{Total Profit per Day} = \text{Profit per DVD} \times \text{Number of DVDs Sold} = 9 \times 500 = 4500
\]

So, the total profit per day is **$4500**.

### Step 4: Calculate the Total Profit per Week
James sells DVDs 5 days a week. Therefore, the total profit per week can be calculated by multiplying the total profit per day by the number of days he sells DVDs in a week.

\[
\text{Total Profit per Week} = \text{Total Profit per Day} \times \text{Number of Days per Week} = 4500 \times 5 = 22500
\]

Thus, the total profit per week is **$22,500**.

### Step 5: Calculate the Total Profit in 20 Weeks
Finally, to find the total profit over 20 weeks, we multiply the total profit per week by the number of weeks.

\[
\text{Total Profit in 20 Weeks} = \text{Total Profit per Week} \times \text{Number of Weeks} = 22500 \times 20 = 450000
\]

Therefore, the total profit James makes in 20 weeks is **$450,000**.

### Final Answer
James makes a total profit of **$450,000** in 20 weeks.
