==================================================

Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to calculate how much James sells each DVD for. We know that each DVD costs $6 to make and he sells it for 2.5 times that much. So, the selling price of each DVD is $6 * 2.5 = $15.

Next, we need to calculate how much profit he makes from selling one DVD. The profit from one DVD is the selling price minus the cost to make it, which is $15 - $6 = $9.

Now, we know that he sells 500 DVDs a day for 5 days a week. So, the total number of DVDs he sells in a week is 500 * 5 = 2500 DVDs.

The total profit he makes in a week is the profit from one DVD times the number of DVDs he sells in a week, which is $9 * 2500 = $22,500.

Now, we need to calculate how much profit he makes in 20 weeks. The total profit he makes in 20 weeks is the weekly profit times the number of weeks, which is $22,500 * 20 = $450,000.

Finally, we need to subtract the cost of creating the movie from the total profit to find the final profit. The final profit is $450,000 - $2000 = $448,000.

So, James makes a profit of $448,000 in 20 weeks.
