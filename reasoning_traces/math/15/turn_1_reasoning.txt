==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to calculate James's total costs, total revenue, and ultimately his profit over a period of 20 weeks. Let's break this down step by step.

### Step 1: Calculate the Cost of Creating the Movie
James creates a movie for $2000. This is a fixed cost.

### Step 2: Calculate the Cost of Making Each DVD
The cost to make each DVD is $6.

### Step 3: Calculate the Selling Price of Each DVD
James sells each DVD for 2.5 times the cost to make it. Therefore, the selling price is calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Selling Price} = 2.5 \times \text{Cost to Make DVD} = 2.5 \times 6 = 15
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the Profit Per DVD
To find the profit per DVD, we subtract the cost to make the DVD from the selling price:

\[
\text{Profit per DVD} = \text{Selling Price} - \text{Cost to Make DVD} = 15 - 6 = 9
\]

### Step 5: Calculate the Daily Profit from DVD Sales
James sells 500 DVDs each day. Therefore, the daily profit from selling DVDs is:

\[
\text{Daily Profit} = \text{Profit per DVD} \times \text{Number of DVDs Sold per Day} = 9 \times 500 = 4500
\]

### Step 6: Calculate the Weekly Profit
James sells DVDs 5 days a week. Thus, the weekly profit is:

\[
\text{Weekly Profit} = \text{Daily Profit} \times \text{Number of Days Sold per Week} = 4500 \times 5 = 22500
\]

### Step 7: Calculate the Profit Over 20 Weeks
Now, we need to calculate the total profit over 20 weeks:

\[
\text{Total Profit over 20 Weeks} = \text{Weekly Profit} \times 20 = 22500 \times 20 = 450000
\]

### Step 8: Calculate Total Costs
Now, we need to account for the initial cost of creating the movie. The total costs include the fixed cost of creating the movie and the variable costs of making the DVDs sold over 20 weeks.

1. **Fixed Cost**: $2000 (cost of creating the movie)
2. **Variable Cost**: The cost to make DVDs sold over 20 weeks. 

First, we calculate the total number of DVDs sold in 20 weeks:

\[
\text{Total DVDs Sold} = \text{Number of DVDs Sold per Day} \times \text{Number of Days Sold per Week} \times \text{Number of Weeks} = 500 \times 5 \times 20 = 50000
\]

Now, we calculate the total variable cost for these DVDs:

\[
\text{Total Variable Cost} = \text{Total DVDs Sold} \times \text{Cost to Make DVD} = 50000 \times 6 = 300000
\]

Now, we can calculate the total costs:

\[
\text{Total Costs} = \text{Fixed Cost} + \text{Total Variable Cost} = 2000 + 300000 = 302000
\]

### Step 9: Calculate Total Profit
Finally, we calculate the total profit by subtracting the total costs from the total revenue:

\[
\text{Total Revenue} = \text{Total Profit over 20 Weeks} = 450000
\]

\[
\text{Total Profit} = \text{Total Revenue} - \text{Total Costs} = 450000 - 302000 = 148000
\]

### Final Answer
James makes a total profit of **$148,000** over 20 weeks.
