Question ID: 15
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, let's calculate how much James sells each DVD for. He sells each DVD for 2.5 times the cost to make it, so:

$6 * 2.5 = $15

So, each DVD is sold for $15.

Next, let's calculate how much profit he makes on each DVD. The profit on each DVD is the selling price minus the cost to make it, so:

$15 - $6 = $9

So, he makes $9 profit on each DVD.

Now, let's calculate how much profit he makes in a week. He sells 500 DVDs a day for 5 days a week, so:

500 DVDs/day * 5 days/week = 2500 DVDs/week

So, he sells 2500 DVDs in a week.

The profit for a week is the profit per DVD times the number of DVDs sold, so:

$9/DVD * 2500 DVDs/week = $22,500/week

So, he makes $22,500 profit in a week.

Now, let's calculate how much profit he makes in 20 weeks. The profit for 20 weeks is the weekly profit times the number of weeks, so:

$22,500/week * 20 weeks = $450,000

So, he makes $450,000 profit in 20 weeks.

However, we also need to subtract the cost of creating the movie, which was $2000. So, the total profit is:

$450,000 - $2000 = $448,000

So, James makes a profit of $448,000 in 20 weeks.
