==================================================

To find out how much profit James makes in 20 weeks from his media empire, we will break down the problem step by step.

### Step 1: Calculate the Selling Price of Each DVD
James sells each DVD for 2.5 times the cost to make it. The cost to make each DVD is $6.

\[
\text{Selling Price} = 2.5 \times \text{Cost to Make} = 2.5 \times 6 = 15
\]

So, the selling price of each DVD is **$15**.

### Step 2: Calculate the Profit per DVD
To find the profit per DVD, we subtract the cost to make the DVD from the selling price.

\[
\text{Profit per DVD} = \text{Selling Price} - \text{Cost to Make} = 15 - 6 = 9
\]

Thus, the profit per DVD is **$9**.

### Step 3: Calculate the Daily Profit
James sells 500 DVDs each day. To find the daily profit, we multiply the profit per DVD by the number of DVDs sold per day.

\[
\text{Daily Profit} = \text{Profit per DVD} \times \text{Number of DVDs Sold} = 9 \times 500 = 4500
\]

So, the daily profit is **$4500**.

### Step 4: Calculate the Weekly Profit
James operates 5 days a week. To find the weekly profit, we multiply the daily profit by the number of days he sells DVDs in a week.

\[
\text{Weekly Profit} = \text{Daily Profit} \times \text{Number of Days per Week} = 4500 \times 5 = 22500
\]

Thus, the weekly profit is **$22,500**.

### Step 5: Calculate the Profit over 20 Weeks
To find the total profit over 20 weeks, we multiply the weekly profit by the number of weeks.

\[
\text{Total Profit} = \text{Weekly Profit} \times \text{Number of Weeks} = 22500 \times 20 = 450000
\]

Therefore, the total profit James makes in 20 weeks is **$450,000**.

### Final Answer
James makes a total profit of **$450,000** in 20 weeks.
