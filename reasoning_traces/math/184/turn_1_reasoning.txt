To solve the problem, we need to determine two probabilities:

1. The probability that Jerry rolls a number greater than 3 on a six-sided die.
2. The probability that Jerry rolls two even numbers in a row.

### Step 1: Probability of rolling a number greater than 3

The numbers on a six-sided die are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. The numbers greater than 3 are 4, 5, and 6.

- Total outcomes on a die: 6
- Favorable outcomes (numbers greater than 3): 4, 5, 6 (which are 3 outcomes)

The probability \( P(A) \) of rolling a number greater than 3 is calculated as follows:

\[
P(A) = \frac{\text{Number of favorable outcomes}}{\text{Total outcomes}} = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2}
\]

### Step 2: Probability of rolling two even numbers in a row

The even numbers on a six-sided die are 2, 4, and 6.

- Total outcomes on a die: 6
- Favorable outcomes (even numbers): 2, 4, 6 (which are 3 outcomes)

The probability \( P(B) \) of rolling an even number on one roll is:

\[
P(B) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2}
\]

Since the rolls are independent, the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is:

\[
P(\text{two even numbers}) = P(B) \times P(B) = \left(\frac{1}{2}\right) \times \left(\frac{1}{2}\right) = \frac{1}{4}
\]

### Step 3: Comparing the probabilities

Now we need to find out how much more likely it is to roll a number greater than 3 compared to rolling two even numbers in a row. We can express this as:

\[
\text{Difference in probabilities} = P(A) - P(\text{two even numbers}) = \frac{1}{2} - \frac{1}{4}
\]

To perform the subtraction, we convert \( \frac{1}{2} \) to have a common denominator:

\[
\frac{1}{2} = \frac{2}{4}
\]

Now we can subtract:

\[
\frac{2}{4} - \frac{1}{4} = \frac{1}{4}
\]

### Step 4: Expressing the difference as a percentage

To express how much more likely it is to roll a number greater than 3 as a percentage, we take the difference in probabilities and convert it to a percentage:

\[
\text{Percentage} = \left(\frac{1}{4}\right) \times 100\% = 25\%
\]

### Final Answer

Jerry is 25% more likely to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two even numbers in a row.
