To solve the problem, we need to calculate two probabilities: the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 on a six-sided die, and the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row. Then, we will compare these probabilities and express the difference as a percentage.

### Step 1: Calculate the probability of rolling a number greater than 3.

A six-sided die has the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. The numbers greater than 3 are 4, 5, and 6.

**Count the favorable outcomes:**
- Favorable outcomes: 4, 5, 6 (3 outcomes)

**Total possible outcomes:**
- Total outcomes when rolling a die: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 (6 outcomes)

**Probability of rolling a number greater than 3:**
\[
P(\text{greater than 3}) = \frac{\text{Number of favorable outcomes}}{\text{Total outcomes}} = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row.

The even numbers on a six-sided die are 2, 4, and 6.

**Count the favorable outcomes for one roll:**
- Favorable outcomes for one roll: 2, 4, 6 (3 outcomes)

**Probability of rolling an even number:**
\[
P(\text{even}) = \frac{\text{Number of favorable outcomes}}{\text{Total outcomes}} = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2}
\]

**Now, calculate the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row:**
Since the rolls are independent, we multiply the probabilities of each roll:
\[
P(\text{two even numbers}) = P(\text{even}) \times P(\text{even}) = \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{4}
\]

### Step 3: Compare the probabilities.

Now we have:
- Probability of rolling a number greater than 3: \( \frac{1}{2} \)
- Probability of rolling two even numbers in a row: \( \frac{1}{4} \)

### Step 4: Calculate how much more likely it is to roll a number greater than 3.

To find how much more likely it is to roll a number greater than 3 compared to rolling two even numbers, we subtract the probability of rolling two even numbers from the probability of rolling a number greater than 3:
\[
\text{Difference} = P(\text{greater than 3}) - P(\text{two even numbers}) = \frac{1}{2} - \frac{1}{4}
\]

To perform the subtraction, we need a common denominator:
\[
\frac{1}{2} = \frac{2}{4}
\]
So,
\[
\text{Difference} = \frac{2}{4} - \frac{1}{4} = \frac{1}{4}
\]

### Step 5: Express the difference as a percentage.

To express \( \frac{1}{4} \) as a percentage, we multiply by 100:
\[
\text{Percentage} = \frac{1}{4} \times 100 = 25\%
\]

### Final Answer:
Jerry is 25% more likely to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two even numbers in a row.
