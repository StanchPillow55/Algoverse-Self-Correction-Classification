==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to track the number of positive Coronavirus cases over the three days, taking into account both new cases and recoveries.

**Day 1:**
- Initial number of positive cases = 2000

**Day 2:**
- New cases = 500
- Recoveries = 50

To find the total number of positive cases at the end of Day 2, we add the new cases and subtract the recoveries from the initial number of cases:

\[
\text{Positive cases at end of Day 2} = 2000 + 500 - 50 = 2450
\]

**Day 3:**
- New cases = 1500
- Recoveries = 200

To find the total number of positive cases at the end of Day 3, we add the new cases and subtract the recoveries from the number of cases at the end of Day 2:

\[
\text{Positive cases at end of Day 3} = 2450 + 1500 - 200 = 3750
\]

Therefore, the total number of positive cases after the third day is \(\boxed{3750}\).
