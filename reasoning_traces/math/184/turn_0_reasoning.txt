To find the total number of positive Coronavirus cases after the third day, we will break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial Cases on Day 1:**
   - The total number of positive cases on the first day is given as 2000.

2. **Cases on Day 2:**
   - On the second day, the number of new cases increased by 500.
   - Additionally, there were 50 recoveries.
   - We can calculate the total number of cases at the end of Day 2 as follows:

   \[
   \text{Total cases at end of Day 2} = \text{Cases at start of Day 2} + \text{New cases} - \text{Recoveries}
   \]

   - The cases at the start of Day 2 is the same as the total at the end of Day 1, which is 2000.
   - Therefore, we have:

   \[
   \text{Total cases at end of Day 2} = 2000 + 500 - 50
   \]

   \[
   \text{Total cases at end of Day 2} = 2000 + 450 = 2450
   \]

3. **Cases on Day 3:**
   - On the third day, the number of new cases spiked to 1500, and there were 200 recoveries.
   - We can calculate the total number of cases at the end of Day 3 using the same formula:

   \[
   \text{Total cases at end of Day 3} = \text{Cases at start of Day 3} + \text{New cases} - \text{Recoveries}
   \]

   - The cases at the start of Day 3 is the same as the total at the end of Day 2, which is 2450.
   - Therefore, we have:

   \[
   \text{Total cases at end of Day 3} = 2450 + 1500 - 200
   \]

   \[
   \text{Total cases at end of Day 3} = 2450 + 1300 = 3750
   \]

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The total number of positive Coronavirus cases after the third day is **3750**.

Thus, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{3750}
\]
