==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to calculate two probabilities: the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 on a six-sided die and the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row. Then, we will compare these probabilities and express the difference as a percentage.

### Step 1: Calculate the probability of rolling a number greater than 3.

A six-sided die has the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. The numbers greater than 3 are 4, 5, and 6. 

- **Count of favorable outcomes (numbers greater than 3):** 3 (which are 4, 5, and 6)
- **Total possible outcomes:** 6 (the numbers 1 through 6)

The probability \( P(A) \) of rolling a number greater than 3 is given by:

\[
P(A) = \frac{\text{Number of favorable outcomes}}{\text{Total possible outcomes}} = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row.

The even numbers on a six-sided die are 2, 4, and 6. 

- **Count of favorable outcomes (even numbers):** 3 (which are 2, 4, and 6)
- **Total possible outcomes:** 6 (the numbers 1 through 6)

The probability \( P(B) \) of rolling one even number is:

\[
P(B) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2}
\]

Since the rolls are independent, the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is:

\[
P(B \text{ and } B) = P(B) \times P(B) = \left(\frac{1}{2}\right) \times \left(\frac{1}{2}\right) = \frac{1}{4}
\]

### Step 3: Compare the probabilities.

Now we have:
- Probability of rolling a number greater than 3: \( P(A) = \frac{1}{2} \)
- Probability of rolling two even numbers in a row: \( P(B \text{ and } B) = \frac{1}{4} \)

### Step 4: Calculate how much more likely it is to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two even numbers.

To find how much more likely it is to roll a number greater than 3 compared to rolling two even numbers, we can calculate the difference in probabilities:

\[
\text{Difference} = P(A) - P(B \text{ and } B) = \frac{1}{2} - \frac{1}{4}
\]

To perform this subtraction, we need a common denominator:

\[
\frac{1}{2} = \frac{2}{4}
\]

Now we can subtract:

\[
\text{Difference} = \frac{2}{4} - \frac{1}{4} = \frac{1}{4}
\]

### Step 5: Express the difference as a percentage.

To express the difference \( \frac{1}{4} \) as a percentage, we multiply by 100:

\[
\text{Percentage difference} = \frac{1}{4} \times 100 = 25\%
\]

### Final Answer

Jerry is 25% more likely to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two even numbers in a row.
