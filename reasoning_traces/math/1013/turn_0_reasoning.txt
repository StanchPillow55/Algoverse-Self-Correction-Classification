To determine how many weeks Janet needs to work to save for the down payment on a car, we will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total amount needed for the down payment.**
2. **Calculate Janet's total earnings per hour.**
3. **Calculate her total earnings per week.**
4. **Determine how many weeks she needs to work to reach the down payment amount.**

### Step 1: Calculate the Total Amount Needed for the Down Payment

Janet wants to save up 20% of the cost of a $10,000 car. 

\[
\text{Down payment} = 20\% \text{ of } 10000 = 0.20 \times 10000 = 2000
\]

So, Janet needs to save $2,000 for the down payment.

### Step 2: Calculate Janet's Total Earnings Per Hour

Janet earns $10 per hour from wages and $15 per hour from tips. 

\[
\text{Total earnings per hour} = \text{Wages} + \text{Tips} = 10 + 15 = 25
\]

Thus, Janet earns $25 per hour.

### Step 3: Calculate Her Total Earnings Per Week

Janet works 40 hours a week. Therefore, her total earnings per week can be calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Total earnings per week} = \text{Total earnings per hour} \times \text{Hours worked per week} = 25 \times 40
\]

Calculating that:

\[
25 \times 40 = 1000
\]

So, Janet earns $1,000 per week.

### Step 4: Determine How Many Weeks She Needs to Work

Now we need to find out how many weeks Janet needs to work to save up the $2,000 down payment. We can set up the equation:

\[
\text{Number of weeks} = \frac{\text{Total amount needed}}{\text{Total earnings per week}} = \frac{2000}{1000}
\]

Calculating that:

\[
\frac{2000}{1000} = 2
\]

### Final Answer

Janet needs to work **2 weeks** to save up the down payment of $2,000 for the car.
