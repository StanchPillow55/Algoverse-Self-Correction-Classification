==================================================

To solve the problem, I need more specific information about "Sample reasoning question 12." Since the problem statement is not provided, I'll demonstrate how to approach a typical math reasoning problem by creating a hypothetical example and solving it step by step.

### Hypothetical Problem:
**Question:** A farmer has a rectangular field with a length that is twice its width. If the perimeter of the field is 300 meters, what are the dimensions of the field?

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We have a rectangular field.
   - Let the width of the field be \( w \).
   - The length of the field is twice the width, so the length is \( 2w \).
   - The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula: 
     \[
     P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width})
     \]
   - We know the perimeter is 300 meters.

2. **Set Up the Equation:**
   - Substitute the known values into the perimeter formula:
     \[
     300 = 2 \times (2w + w)
     \]

3. **Simplify the Equation:**
   - Combine like terms inside the parentheses:
     \[
     300 = 2 \times (3w)
     \]
   - Simplify further:
     \[
     300 = 6w
     \]

4. **Solve for \( w \):**
   - Divide both sides of the equation by 6 to isolate \( w \):
     \[
     w = \frac{300}{6} = 50
     \]

5. **Find the Length:**
   - Since the length is twice the width:
     \[
     \text{Length} = 2w = 2 \times 50 = 100
     \]

6. **Verify the Solution:**
   - Check that the dimensions satisfy the original perimeter condition:
     \[
     P = 2 \times (100 + 50) = 2 \times 150 = 300
     \]
   - The calculated perimeter matches the given perimeter, confirming the solution is correct.

### Final Answer:
The dimensions of the field are 50 meters in width and 100 meters in length.
