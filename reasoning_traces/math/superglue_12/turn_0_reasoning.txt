It seems like there might be some confusion or missing information in your request. "Sample reasoning question 12" doesn't provide enough context or details for me to solve a specific math problem. However, I can guide you through a general approach to solving math problems by using a sample problem.

Let's consider a sample math problem:

**Problem:**
A train travels from City A to City B at a speed of 60 miles per hour. The distance between City A and City B is 180 miles. How long does it take for the train to travel from City A to City B?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We need to find the time it takes for the train to travel from City A to City B.
   - We know the speed of the train is 60 miles per hour.
   - The distance between the two cities is 180 miles.

2. **Identify the Formula:**
   - The formula to find time when distance and speed are known is:
     \[
     \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}}
     \]

3. **Substitute the Known Values:**
   - Distance = 180 miles
   - Speed = 60 miles per hour
   - Substitute these values into the formula:
     \[
     \text{Time} = \frac{180 \text{ miles}}{60 \text{ miles per hour}}
     \]

4. **Perform the Calculation:**
   - Divide 180 by 60:
     \[
     \text{Time} = 3 \text{ hours}
     \]

5. **Verify the Solution:**
   - To ensure the solution is correct, consider if the units make sense. We divided miles by miles per hour, which results in hours, a unit of time, which is what we are solving for.
   - Additionally, multiplying the time by the speed should give us the original distance:
     \[
     3 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ miles per hour} = 180 \text{ miles}
     \]
   - The calculation checks out.

6. **State the Final Answer:**
   - It takes the train 3 hours to travel from City A to City B.

This is a complete step-by-step solution to a sample math problem. If you have a specific problem or more details about "Sample reasoning question 12," please provide them, and I would be happy to assist further!
