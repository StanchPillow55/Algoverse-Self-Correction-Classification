==================================================

To solve the problem, I need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 12" refers to. Since the problem statement is not clear, I will assume it is a placeholder for a specific math problem. Without the actual content of "Sample reasoning question 12," I will demonstrate a general approach to solving a typical math problem by creating a hypothetical example.

Let's assume "Sample reasoning question 12" is a problem about solving a quadratic equation. Here's how I would approach it:

**Problem:**
Solve the quadratic equation \(2x^2 - 4x - 6 = 0\).

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Identify the Standard Form:**
   The given equation is already in the standard form of a quadratic equation, \(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\), where \(a = 2\), \(b = -4\), and \(c = -6\).

2. **Calculate the Discriminant:**
   The discriminant (\(\Delta\)) of a quadratic equation is given by the formula:
   \[
   \Delta = b^2 - 4ac
   \]
   Substituting the values of \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\):
   \[
   \Delta = (-4)^2 - 4 \times 2 \times (-6) = 16 + 48 = 64
   \]

3. **Determine the Nature of the Roots:**
   Since the discriminant is positive (\(\Delta = 64\)), the quadratic equation has two distinct real roots.

4. **Use the Quadratic Formula:**
   The roots of the quadratic equation can be found using the quadratic formula:
   \[
   x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{\Delta}}{2a}
   \]
   Substituting the known values:
   \[
   x = \frac{-(-4) \pm \sqrt{64}}{2 \times 2} = \frac{4 \pm 8}{4}
   \]

5. **Calculate the Roots:**
   - For the positive square root:
     \[
     x_1 = \frac{4 + 8}{4} = \frac{12}{4} = 3
     \]
   - For the negative square root:
     \[
     x_2 = \frac{4 - 8}{4} = \frac{-4}{4} = -1
     \]

6. **State the Final Answer:**
   The solutions to the quadratic equation \(2x^2 - 4x - 6 = 0\) are \(x = 3\) and \(x = -1\).

This is a complete solution to a hypothetical quadratic equation problem, demonstrating the process of solving it step by step. If "Sample reasoning question 12" refers to a different type of problem, please provide the specific details or context so I can address it accurately.
