==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 164" refers to. Since the question itself is not provided, I'll create a hypothetical math problem and solve it step by step. Let's assume the problem is as follows:

**Problem:**
A rectangle has a length that is 4 units more than its width. If the perimeter of the rectangle is 36 units, find the dimensions of the rectangle.

**Step-by-step Solution:**

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( w \) be the width of the rectangle.
   - Then the length \( l \) can be expressed as \( l = w + 4 \).

2. **Use the Perimeter Formula:**
   - The formula for the perimeter \( P \) of a rectangle is given by:
     \[
     P = 2l + 2w
     \]
   - We know the perimeter is 36 units, so:
     \[
     2l + 2w = 36
     \]

3. **Substitute the Expression for Length:**
   - Substitute \( l = w + 4 \) into the perimeter equation:
     \[
     2(w + 4) + 2w = 36
     \]

4. **Simplify and Solve for \( w \):**
   - Distribute the 2 in the equation:
     \[
     2w + 8 + 2w = 36
     \]
   - Combine like terms:
     \[
     4w + 8 = 36
     \]
   - Subtract 8 from both sides:
     \[
     4w = 28
     \]
   - Divide both sides by 4:
     \[
     w = 7
     \]

5. **Find the Length:**
   - Substitute \( w = 7 \) back into the expression for length:
     \[
     l = w + 4 = 7 + 4 = 11
     \]

6. **Verify the Solution:**
   - Check the perimeter with the found dimensions:
     \[
     P = 2l + 2w = 2(11) + 2(7) = 22 + 14 = 36
     \]
   - The calculated perimeter matches the given perimeter, confirming our solution is correct.

**Final Answer:**
The dimensions of the rectangle are a width of 7 units and a length of 11 units.
