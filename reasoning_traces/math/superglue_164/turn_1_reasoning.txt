==================================================

To solve the problem effectively, let's first clarify the question. It appears that the question is labeled as "Sample reasoning question 164," but no specific mathematical problem is provided. Without a specific problem statement, it's challenging to provide a detailed solution or reasoning.

However, I can guide you on how to approach a typical math problem by outlining a general problem-solving strategy. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step approach that can be applied to a variety of math problems:

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - Carefully read the problem statement.
   - Identify what is being asked.
   - Determine what information is given and what needs to be found.

2. **Devise a Plan:**
   - Consider possible strategies to solve the problem. This could include drawing a diagram, creating an equation, or breaking the problem into smaller parts.
   - Choose the most appropriate method based on the type of problem.

3. **Carry Out the Plan:**
   - Execute the chosen strategy step by step.
   - Perform calculations carefully, and keep track of units if applicable.
   - Ensure each step logically follows from the previous one.

4. **Check Your Work:**
   - Review each step to ensure no mistakes were made.
   - Verify that the solution answers the question posed in the problem.
   - Consider whether the answer is reasonable and makes sense in the context of the problem.

5. **State the Final Answer:**
   - Clearly present the final answer, including units if necessary.
   - Ensure the answer is in the correct form as required by the problem.

Since no specific problem is provided, I cannot apply these steps to a particular scenario. If you have a specific math problem or question in mind, please provide the details, and I would be happy to work through it with you using the outlined approach.
