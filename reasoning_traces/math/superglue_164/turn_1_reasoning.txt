==================================================

To solve the problem effectively, let's first understand what "Sample reasoning question 164" might entail. Since no specific details are provided about the content of the question, I'll assume it's a generic math problem that requires logical reasoning and problem-solving skills. I'll create a hypothetical problem and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**

A company produces two types of widgets: Type A and Type B. The company sells Type A widgets for $50 each and Type B widgets for $70 each. The production cost for Type A is $30 per widget, and for Type B, it's $40 per widget. Last month, the company sold a total of 500 widgets and made a profit of $15,000. How many of each type of widget did the company sell?

**Step-by-step Solution:**

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( x \) be the number of Type A widgets sold.
   - Let \( y \) be the number of Type B widgets sold.

2. **Set Up Equations:**
   - Total widgets sold: \( x + y = 500 \)
   - Profit equation: Profit is calculated as total revenue minus total cost.
     - Revenue from Type A: \( 50x \)
     - Revenue from Type B: \( 70y \)
     - Total Revenue: \( 50x + 70y \)
     - Cost for Type A: \( 30x \)
     - Cost for Type B: \( 40y \)
     - Total Cost: \( 30x + 40y \)
     - Profit: \( (50x + 70y) - (30x + 40y) = 15,000 \)

3. **Simplify the Profit Equation:**
   \[
   50x + 70y - 30x - 40y = 15,000
   \]
   \[
   20x + 30y = 15,000
   \]

4. **Solve the System of Equations:**
   - We have two equations:
     1. \( x + y = 500 \)
     2. \( 20x + 30y = 15,000 \)

   - From equation 1, express \( y \) in terms of \( x \):
     \[
     y = 500 - x
     \]

   - Substitute \( y = 500 - x \) into equation 2:
     \[
     20x + 30(500 - x) = 15,000
     \]
     \[
     20x + 15,000 - 30x = 15,000
     \]
     \[
     -10x + 15,000 = 15,000
     \]
     \[
     -10x = 0
     \]
     \[
     x = 0
     \]

   - Substitute \( x = 0 \) back into equation 1:
     \[
     0 + y = 500
     \]
     \[
     y = 500
     \]

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The company sold 0 Type A widgets and 500 Type B widgets.

**Final Answer:**
The company sold 0 Type A widgets and 500 Type B widgets.
