Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem effectively, I need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 164" entails. Since I don't have the specific details of this question, I'll demonstrate a general approach to solving a reasoning-based math problem. 

Let's assume a hypothetical math reasoning problem:

**Problem:**
A train travels from City A to City B at a speed of 60 km/h. On its return trip, due to maintenance work on the tracks, it travels at a reduced speed of 40 km/h. If the total travel time for the round trip is 5 hours, what is the distance between City A and City B?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( d \) be the distance between City A and City B in kilometers.
   - The speed from City A to City B is 60 km/h.
   - The speed from City B to City A is 40 km/h.

2. **Set Up Equations:**
   - Time taken to travel from City A to City B: \( \frac{d}{60} \) hours.
   - Time taken to travel from City B to City A: \( \frac{d}{40} \) hours.
   - Total travel time for the round trip is given as 5 hours.

3. **Equation for Total Time:**
   \[
   \frac{d}{60} + \frac{d}{40} = 5
   \]

4. **Find a Common Denominator:**
   - The least common multiple of 60 and 40 is 120.
   - Rewrite the equation with a common denominator:
   \[
   \frac{2d}{120} + \frac{3d}{120} = 5
   \]

5. **Combine the Fractions:**
   \[
   \frac{2d + 3d}{120} = 5
   \]
   \[
   \frac{5d}{120} = 5
   \]

6. **Solve for \( d \):**
   - Multiply both sides by 120 to eliminate the fraction:
   \[
   5d = 5 \times 120
   \]
   \[
   5d = 600
   \]
   - Divide both sides by 5:
   \[
   d = \frac{600}{5}
   \]
   \[
   d = 120
   \]

7. **Conclusion:**
   - The distance between City A and City B is 120 kilometers.

**Final Answer:**
The distance between City A and City B is 120 km.

This solution demonstrates a structured approach to solving a reasoning-based math problem by defining variables, setting up equations, and solving step-by-step. If you have a specific problem in mind, please provide the details, and I can tailor the solution accordingly.
