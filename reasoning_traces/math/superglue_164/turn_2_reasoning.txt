==================================================

To solve this problem, we first need to understand what "Sample reasoning question 164" entails. Since the problem statement is not fully provided, I'll assume a generic approach to solving a reasoning-based math problem. Let's consider a typical math reasoning problem and solve it step by step.

### Problem:
Let's assume the problem is as follows:

**Problem Statement:**  
A farmer has a certain number of chickens and cows. There are a total of 50 heads and 140 legs on the farm. How many chickens and how many cows are there?

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( c \) represent the number of chickens.
   - Let \( w \) represent the number of cows.

2. **Set Up Equations:**
   - Each chicken has 1 head and 2 legs.
   - Each cow has 1 head and 4 legs.
   - We have two pieces of information:
     1. The total number of heads is 50.
     2. The total number of legs is 140.

   From the heads, we get the equation:
   \[
   c + w = 50
   \]

   From the legs, we get the equation:
   \[
   2c + 4w = 140
   \]

3. **Solve the System of Equations:**

   First, simplify the second equation by dividing everything by 2:
   \[
   c + 2w = 70
   \]

   Now, we have the system of equations:
   \[
   \begin{align*}
   c + w &= 50 \quad \text{(Equation 1)} \\
   c + 2w &= 70 \quad \text{(Equation 2)}
   \end{align*}
   \]

   Subtract Equation 1 from Equation 2:
   \[
   (c + 2w) - (c + w) = 70 - 50
   \]
   \[
   w = 20
   \]

   Substitute \( w = 20 \) back into Equation 1:
   \[
   c + 20 = 50
   \]
   \[
   c = 30
   \]

4. **Verify the Solution:**

   - Total heads: \( c + w = 30 + 20 = 50 \) (Correct)
   - Total legs: \( 2c + 4w = 2(30) + 4(20) = 60 + 80 = 140 \) (Correct)

### Final Answer:
The farmer has 30 chickens and 20 cows.
