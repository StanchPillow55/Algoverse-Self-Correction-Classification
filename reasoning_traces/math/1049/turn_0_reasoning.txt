==================================================

To determine how many books in the library are written in Spanish, we will follow these steps:

1. **Identify the total number of books**: 
   The total number of books in the library is given as 50.

2. **Calculate the number of English books**:
   It is stated that half of the books are written in English. Therefore, we can calculate the number of English books as follows:
   \[
   \text{Number of English books} = \frac{1}{2} \times 50 = 25
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of German books**:
   We are also told that 10% of the books are written in German. To find the number of German books, we calculate 10% of 50:
   \[
   \text{Number of German books} = 0.10 \times 50 = 5
   \]

4. **Calculate the number of Spanish books**:
   Now, we need to find out how many books are written in Spanish. Since the total number of books is 50, we can subtract the number of English and German books from the total:
   \[
   \text{Number of Spanish books} = \text{Total books} - (\text{Number of English books} + \text{Number of German books})
   \]
   Substituting the values we calculated:
   \[
   \text{Number of Spanish books} = 50 - (25 + 5) = 50 - 30 = 20
   \]

5. **Final answer**:
   Therefore, the number of books written in Spanish is:
   \[
   \boxed{20}
   \]
