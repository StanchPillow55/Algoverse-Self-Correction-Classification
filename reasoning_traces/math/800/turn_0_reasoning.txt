==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to determine how many points Nikita scored based on the information given about Pierson's score, and then find the total score of both players.

1. **Identify Pierson's Score**:
   Pierson scored 278 points.

2. **Calculate Nikita's Score**:
   According to the problem, Nikita scored 11 more than half as many points as Pierson. We can express this mathematically.

   First, we need to find half of Pierson's score:
   \[
   \text{Half of Pierson's score} = \frac{278}{2} = 139
   \]

   Next, we add 11 to this value to find Nikita's score:
   \[
   \text{Nikita's score} = 139 + 11 = 150
   \]

3. **Calculate the Total Score**:
   Now that we have both scores, we can find the total score by adding Pierson's score and Nikita's score together:
   \[
   \text{Total score} = \text{Pierson's score} + \text{Nikita's score} = 278 + 150
   \]

   Performing the addition:
   \[
   278 + 150 = 428
   \]

4. **Final Answer**:
   Therefore, the total points scored by Pierson and Nikita together is:
   \[
   \boxed{428}
   \]
