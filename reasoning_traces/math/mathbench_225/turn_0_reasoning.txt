==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 225," we first need to understand what the problem is asking. Since the problem statement is not fully clear, I'll assume that the problem involves the number 225 and requires some mathematical operations or analysis. A common type of problem involving a number like 225 could be finding its square root, determining its factors, or expressing it in a different form.

Let's explore a few possibilities:

### 1. Finding the Square Root of 225

The square root of a number \( n \) is a value \( x \) such that \( x^2 = n \). For 225, we want to find \( x \) such that:

\[ x^2 = 225 \]

To find the square root, we can try to factor 225 into a perfect square. Notice that:

\[ 225 = 15 \times 15 \]

Thus, \( 15^2 = 225 \), which means:

\[ \sqrt{225} = 15 \]

### 2. Finding the Factors of 225

To find the factors of 225, we need to determine all the integers that divide 225 without leaving a remainder. We can start by performing prime factorization:

1. 225 is an odd number, so it is not divisible by 2.
2. The sum of the digits of 225 is \( 2 + 2 + 5 = 9 \), which is divisible by 3. Therefore, 225 is divisible by 3.

   \[ 225 \div 3 = 75 \]

3. Continuing with 75, the sum of its digits is \( 7 + 5 = 12 \), which is also divisible by 3.

   \[ 75 \div 3 = 25 \]

4. 25 is a perfect square, \( 25 = 5 \times 5 \).

Thus, the prime factorization of 225 is:

\[ 225 = 3^2 \times 5^2 \]

Using the prime factorization, we can list all the factors of 225 by considering all combinations of these prime factors:

- \( 1 \)
- \( 3 \)
- \( 5 \)
- \( 9 \) (since \( 3^2 = 9 \))
- \( 15 \) (since \( 3 \times 5 = 15 \))
- \( 25 \) (since \( 5^2 = 25 \))
- \( 45 \) (since \( 3^2 \times 5 = 45 \))
- \( 75 \) (since \( 3 \times 5^2 = 75 \))
- \( 225 \) (since \( 3^2 \times 5^2 = 225 \))

### 3. Expressing 225 in a Different Form

Another common task might be to express 225 in exponential form or as a power of another number. As we found earlier, 225 can be expressed as:

\[ 225 = 15^2 \]

### Conclusion

Based on the assumptions and common mathematical tasks involving the number 225, here are the key points:

- The square root of 225 is \( 15 \).
- The factors of 225 are \( 1, 3, 5, 9, 15, 25, 45, 75, \) and \( 225 \).
- 225 can be expressed as \( 15^2 \).

If the problem had a specific requirement, such as finding the square root or listing factors, the final answer would be tailored to that requirement. Since the problem statement was not specific, I provided a general analysis of the number 225.
