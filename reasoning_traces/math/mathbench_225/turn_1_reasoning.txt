==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 225," we need to first understand what the problem is asking. However, the phrase "Sample math problem 225" is not specific enough to determine the exact nature of the problem. It could refer to a problem number in a textbook, a specific type of math problem, or something else entirely.

Since the problem is not clearly defined, let's assume that "225" is a number that we need to work with in some mathematical context. One common mathematical task involving a number like 225 is to find its square root, factor it, or perform some other operation. Let's explore these possibilities:

### 1. Finding the Square Root of 225

The square root of a number \( x \) is a number \( y \) such that \( y^2 = x \). To find the square root of 225, we look for a number that, when multiplied by itself, equals 225.

\[
y^2 = 225
\]

We can try some numbers to see which one works:

- \( 10^2 = 100 \)
- \( 15^2 = 225 \)

Thus, the square root of 225 is 15.

### 2. Factoring 225

Factoring involves breaking down a number into its prime components. Let's factor 225:

1. Check divisibility by 2: 225 is odd, so it's not divisible by 2.
2. Check divisibility by 3: The sum of the digits of 225 is \( 2 + 2 + 5 = 9 \), which is divisible by 3. Therefore, 225 is divisible by 3.
   \[
   225 \div 3 = 75
   \]
3. Factor 75: 
   - Check divisibility by 3: The sum of the digits of 75 is \( 7 + 5 = 12 \), which is divisible by 3.
   \[
   75 \div 3 = 25
   \]
4. Factor 25: 
   - 25 is \( 5 \times 5 \).

Thus, the prime factorization of 225 is:
\[
225 = 3^2 \times 5^2
\]

### Conclusion

Since the problem was not explicitly defined, we explored two common mathematical operations involving the number 225: finding its square root and its prime factorization.

- The square root of 225 is 15.
- The prime factorization of 225 is \( 3^2 \times 5^2 \).

If there was a specific problem associated with "Sample math problem 225," please provide more details so I can address it directly. Otherwise, these are the typical operations one might perform with the number 225.
