To solve the problem, we will calculate the total amount Clara paid for the pomegranates on Tuesday and the total amount Sheila paid for the pomegranates on Wednesday, then find the difference between the two amounts.

### Step 1: Calculate Clara's total cost on Tuesday

1. **Price per pomegranate**: $20
2. **Number of pomegranates**: 20
3. **Total cost before discount**: 
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = \text{Price per pomegranate} \times \text{Number of pomegranates} = 20 \times 20 = 400
   \]
4. **Discount from voucher**: $2
5. **Total cost after discount**: 
   \[
   \text{Total cost after discount} = \text{Total cost} - \text{Discount} = 400 - 2 = 398
   \]

So, Clara paid **$398** for the pomegranates on Tuesday.

### Step 2: Calculate Sheila's total cost on Wednesday

1. **Price per pomegranate**: $30
2. **Number of pomegranates**: 20
3. **Total cost before discount**: 
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = \text{Price per pomegranate} \times \text{Number of pomegranates} = 30 \times 20 = 600
   \]
4. **Discount offered**: 10%
5. **Amount of discount**: 
   \[
   \text{Discount amount} = \text{Total cost} \times \frac{10}{100} = 600 \times 0.10 = 60
   \]
6. **Total cost after discount**: 
   \[
   \text{Total cost after discount} = \text{Total cost} - \text{Discount amount} = 600 - 60 = 540
   \]

So, Sheila paid **$540** for the pomegranates on Wednesday.

### Step 3: Calculate the difference between the two amounts paid

1. **Difference**: 
   \[
   \text{Difference} = \text{Sheila's total} - \text{Clara's total} = 540 - 398 = 142
   \]

### Final Answer

The difference between the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days is **$142**.
