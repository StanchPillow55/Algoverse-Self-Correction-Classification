To determine the total cost of painting the room, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the area of each wall**.
2. **Sum the areas of all four walls** to find the total area to be painted.
3. **Determine how many gallons of paint are needed** based on the coverage of one gallon.
4. **Calculate the total cost of the paint**.

### Step 1: Calculate the area of each wall

- **North wall**: 
  \[
  \text{Area} = \text{length} \times \text{height} = 10 \, \text{ft} \times 8 \, \text{ft} = 80 \, \text{sq ft}
  \]

- **South wall**: 
  \[
  \text{Area} = 10 \, \text{ft} \times 8 \, \text{ft} = 80 \, \text{sq ft}
  \]

- **East wall**: 
  \[
  \text{Area} = 5 \, \text{ft} \times 8 \, \text{ft} = 40 \, \text{sq ft}
  \]

- **West wall**: 
  \[
  \text{Area} = 5 \, \text{ft} \times 8 \, \text{ft} = 40 \, \text{sq ft}
  \]

### Step 2: Sum the areas of all four walls

Now, we add the areas of all the walls together:
\[
\text{Total Area} = \text{Area of North wall} + \text{Area of South wall} + \text{Area of East wall} + \text{Area of West wall}
\]
\[
\text{Total Area} = 80 \, \text{sq ft} + 80 \, \text{sq ft} + 40 \, \text{sq ft} + 40 \, \text{sq ft} = 240 \, \text{sq ft}
\]

### Step 3: Determine how many gallons of paint are needed

Each gallon of paint covers 20 square feet. To find out how many gallons are needed, we divide the total area by the coverage per gallon:
\[
\text{Gallons needed} = \frac{\text{Total Area}}{\text{Coverage per gallon}} = \frac{240 \, \text{sq ft}}{20 \, \text{sq ft/gallon}} = 12 \, \text{gallons}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the total cost of the paint

The cost of one gallon of paint is $12. Therefore, the total cost for 12 gallons is:
\[
\text{Total Cost} = \text{Gallons needed} \times \text{Cost per gallon} = 12 \, \text{gallons} \times 12 \, \text{dollars/gallon} = 144 \, \text{dollars}
\]

### Final Answer

The total cost to paint the room is **$144**.
