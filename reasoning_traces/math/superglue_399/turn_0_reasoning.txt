==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 399" refers to. Since this is a generic placeholder and doesn't provide specific details about the problem, I'll create a hypothetical math problem to demonstrate the process of solving it step by step. Let's assume the problem is as follows:

**Problem:**
A company produces two types of products, A and B. The profit from each unit of product A is $5, and the profit from each unit of product B is $8. The company can produce a maximum of 100 units of product A and 80 units of product B per week. However, due to resource constraints, the total production of both products cannot exceed 150 units per week. How many units of each product should the company produce to maximize profit?

**Solution:**

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( x \) be the number of units of product A produced.
   - Let \( y \) be the number of units of product B produced.

2. **Objective Function:**
   - The profit function \( P \) is given by:
     \[
     P = 5x + 8y
     \]
   - We want to maximize \( P \).

3. **Constraints:**
   - The production constraints are:
     \[
     x \leq 100 \quad \text{(cannot produce more than 100 units of A)}
     \]
     \[
     y \leq 80 \quad \text{(cannot produce more than 80 units of B)}
     \]
     \[
     x + y \leq 150 \quad \text{(total production constraint)}
     \]
   - Additionally, \( x \geq 0 \) and \( y \geq 0 \) since negative production is not possible.

4. **Graphical Solution Method:**
   - Plot the constraints on a graph with \( x \) on the horizontal axis and \( y \) on the vertical axis.
   - The feasible region is the area where all constraints overlap.

5. **Vertices of the Feasible Region:**
   - The vertices of the feasible region are potential candidates for maximizing the profit function. They occur at the intersections of the constraint lines:
     - Intersection of \( x = 100 \) and \( x + y = 150 \): \( (100, 50) \)
     - Intersection of \( y = 80 \) and \( x + y = 150 \): \( (70, 80) \)
     - Intersection of \( x = 0 \) and \( y = 80 \): \( (0, 80) \)
     - Intersection of \( x = 100 \) and \( y = 0 \): \( (100, 0) \)

6. **Evaluate the Objective Function at Each Vertex:**
   - \( P(100, 50) = 5(100) + 8(50) = 500 + 400 = 900 \)
   - \( P(70, 80) = 5(70) + 8(80) = 350 + 640 = 990 \)
   - \( P(0, 80) = 5(0) + 8(80) = 0 + 640 = 640 \)
   - \( P(100, 0) = 5(100) + 8(0) = 500 + 0 = 500 \)

7. **Determine the Maximum Profit:**
   - The maximum profit occurs at the vertex \( (70, 80) \) with a profit of \( 990 \).

**Final Answer:**
To maximize profit, the company should produce 70 units of product A and 80 units of product B, resulting in a maximum profit of $990.
