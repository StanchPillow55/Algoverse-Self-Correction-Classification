==================================================

To solve the problem effectively, we need to first understand the context and details of the question. However, the question "Sample reasoning question 399" is not specific and lacks details. Therefore, I'll assume this is a placeholder for a typical math problem. Let's create a hypothetical math problem and solve it step by step.

### Hypothetical Problem:
**Question:** A store sells apples at $2 each and oranges at $3 each. A customer buys a total of 10 fruits, spending exactly $24. How many apples and how many oranges did the customer buy?

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( x \) be the number of apples.
   - Let \( y \) be the number of oranges.

2. **Set Up Equations:**
   - The total number of fruits is 10: 
     \[
     x + y = 10
     \]
   - The total cost is $24:
     \[
     2x + 3y = 24
     \]

3. **Solve the System of Equations:**

   We have the system:
   \[
   \begin{align*}
   x + y &= 10 \quad \text{(Equation 1)} \\
   2x + 3y &= 24 \quad \text{(Equation 2)}
   \end{align*}
   \]

   **Substitution Method:**

   From Equation 1, express \( y \) in terms of \( x \):
   \[
   y = 10 - x
   \]

   Substitute \( y = 10 - x \) into Equation 2:
   \[
   2x + 3(10 - x) = 24
   \]

   Simplify and solve for \( x \):
   \[
   2x + 30 - 3x = 24
   \]
   \[
   -x + 30 = 24
   \]
   \[
   -x = 24 - 30
   \]
   \[
   -x = -6
   \]
   \[
   x = 6
   \]

   Substitute \( x = 6 \) back into the expression for \( y \):
   \[
   y = 10 - x = 10 - 6 = 4
   \]

4. **Verify the Solution:**

   Check the total number of fruits:
   \[
   x + y = 6 + 4 = 10
   \]

   Check the total cost:
   \[
   2x + 3y = 2(6) + 3(4) = 12 + 12 = 24
   \]

   Both conditions are satisfied.

### Final Answer:
The customer bought 6 apples and 4 oranges.
