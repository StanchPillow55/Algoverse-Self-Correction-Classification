==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 162," we need to first understand what the problem is asking. However, the problem statement is incomplete as it only says "Sample math problem 162" without providing any specific details or context. 

Since there is no specific math problem provided, I will create a hypothetical math problem based on the number 162 and solve it step by step. Let's assume the problem is as follows:

**Problem:**  
Find the prime factorization of 162 and determine the sum of its prime factors.

**Step 1: Prime Factorization of 162**

To find the prime factorization, we need to divide 162 by the smallest prime numbers until we reach 1.

1. **Divide by 2:**  
   162 is even, so we start by dividing by 2.  
   \( 162 \div 2 = 81 \)

2. **Divide by 3:**  
   81 is not even, so we try the next smallest prime number, which is 3.  
   \( 81 \div 3 = 27 \)

3. **Continue dividing by 3:**  
   \( 27 \div 3 = 9 \)  
   \( 9 \div 3 = 3 \)  
   \( 3 \div 3 = 1 \)

Now, we have divided 162 completely into prime factors. The prime factorization of 162 is:
\[ 162 = 2 \times 3 \times 3 \times 3 \times 3 \]
or more concisely:
\[ 162 = 2 \times 3^4 \]

**Step 2: Sum of the Prime Factors**

The prime factors of 162 are 2 and 3. To find the sum of these distinct prime factors, we add them together:
\[ 2 + 3 = 5 \]

**Final Answer:**

The prime factorization of 162 is \( 2 \times 3^4 \), and the sum of its distinct prime factors is 5.
