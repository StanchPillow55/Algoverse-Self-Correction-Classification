==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample math problem 162" refers to. Since there is no specific problem statement provided, I'll assume this is a placeholder for a generic math problem. Let's create a sample problem and solve it step by step.

**Sample Math Problem 162:**

Let's assume the problem is as follows:

"Calculate the sum of the first 162 positive integers."

To solve this problem, we can use the formula for the sum of the first \( n \) positive integers:

\[
S_n = \frac{n(n + 1)}{2}
\]

where \( S_n \) is the sum of the first \( n \) integers.

**Step-by-step Solution:**

1. **Identify \( n \):**  
   In this problem, \( n = 162 \).

2. **Apply the formula:**  
   Substitute \( n = 162 \) into the formula:

   \[
   S_{162} = \frac{162(162 + 1)}{2}
   \]

3. **Calculate inside the parentheses:**  
   First, calculate \( 162 + 1 \):

   \[
   162 + 1 = 163
   \]

4. **Multiply \( n \) by \( n + 1 \):**  
   Now, multiply 162 by 163:

   \[
   162 \times 163 = 26346
   \]

5. **Divide by 2:**  
   Finally, divide the product by 2 to find the sum:

   \[
   S_{162} = \frac{26346}{2} = 13173
   \]

Therefore, the sum of the first 162 positive integers is \( 13,173 \).

**Final Answer:**

The sum of the first 162 positive integers is \( 13,173 \).
