==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 162," we first need to understand what the problem is asking. However, the problem statement "Sample math problem 162" does not provide any specific details or numbers to work with. Therefore, I will assume that this is a placeholder for a specific math problem that you intended to provide.

Since I don't have the details of the actual problem, I will demonstrate how to solve a generic math problem by creating a sample problem and solving it step by step.

**Sample Problem:**

Let's assume "Sample math problem 162" is the following:

"Calculate the sum of the first 162 positive integers."

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   We need to find the sum of the first 162 positive integers. The sequence of the first 162 positive integers is: 1, 2, 3, ..., 162.

2. **Identify the Formula:**
   The sum of the first \( n \) positive integers can be calculated using the formula:
   \[
   S = \frac{n(n + 1)}{2}
   \]
   where \( S \) is the sum and \( n \) is the number of terms.

3. **Substitute the Values:**
   In this problem, \( n = 162 \). Substitute 162 into the formula:
   \[
   S = \frac{162(162 + 1)}{2}
   \]

4. **Calculate the Sum:**
   First, calculate \( 162 + 1 \):
   \[
   162 + 1 = 163
   \]

   Next, multiply 162 by 163:
   \[
   162 \times 163 = 26346
   \]

   Finally, divide the product by 2 to find the sum:
   \[
   S = \frac{26346}{2} = 13173
   \]

5. **State the Final Answer:**
   The sum of the first 162 positive integers is 13,173.

Therefore, if "Sample math problem 162" refers to calculating the sum of the first 162 positive integers, the final answer is 13,173. If you have a different problem in mind, please provide the specific details, and I will be happy to solve it for you.
