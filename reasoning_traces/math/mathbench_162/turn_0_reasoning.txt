To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample math problem 162" refers to. Since I don't have access to external databases or specific problem sets, I'll create a hypothetical math problem based on the number 162 and solve it step by step.

Let's assume the problem is as follows:

**Problem:**
Find the prime factorization of 162 and determine the sum of its prime factors.

**Solution:**

Step 1: **Prime Factorization of 162**

To find the prime factorization of 162, we start by dividing it by the smallest prime number, which is 2, and continue dividing by prime numbers until we reach 1.

- 162 is even, so divide by 2:
  \[
  162 \div 2 = 81
  \]

- 81 is not divisible by 2 (since it's odd), so we try the next smallest prime number, which is 3:
  \[
  81 \div 3 = 27
  \]

- 27 is divisible by 3:
  \[
  27 \div 3 = 9
  \]

- 9 is divisible by 3:
  \[
  9 \div 3 = 3
  \]

- Finally, 3 is divisible by 3:
  \[
  3 \div 3 = 1
  \]

So, the prime factorization of 162 is:
\[
162 = 2 \times 3 \times 3 \times 3 \times 3 = 2 \times 3^4
\]

Step 2: **Sum of the Prime Factors**

The prime factors of 162 are 2 and 3. To find the sum of these distinct prime factors, we simply add them together:

\[
2 + 3 = 5
\]

**Final Answer:**

The prime factorization of 162 is \(2 \times 3^4\), and the sum of its distinct prime factors is 5.
