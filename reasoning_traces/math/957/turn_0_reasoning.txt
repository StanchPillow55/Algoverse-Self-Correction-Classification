==================================================

To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step.

1. **Identify Aliya's age**: 
   We are given that Aliya is 3 years old.

2. **Determine Shawna's age**: 
   The problem states that Shawna is currently three times as old as Aliya. 
   \[
   \text{Shawna's age} = 3 \times \text{Aliya's age} = 3 \times 3 = 9 \text{ years old}
   \]

3. **Determine Shawna's father's age**: 
   The problem states that Shawna's father is five times as old as Shawna. 
   \[
   \text{Shawna's father's age} = 5 \times \text{Shawna's age} = 5 \times 9 = 45 \text{ years old}
   \]

Now, let's summarize our findings:

- Aliya is 3 years old.
- Shawna is 9 years old.
- Shawna's father is 45 years old.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\text{Shawna's father is } 45 \text{ years old.}
\]
