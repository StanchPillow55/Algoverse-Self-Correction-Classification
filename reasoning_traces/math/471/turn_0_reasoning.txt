Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step.

1. **Calculate the total number of pencils at the start of the year:**
   Each of the 30 students started with 10 pencils. Therefore, the total number of pencils at the beginning of the year is:
   \[
   \text{Total pencils} = \text{Number of students} \times \text{Pencils per student} = 30 \times 10 = 300 \text{ pencils}
   \]

2. **Determine how many pencils were used after two months:**
   According to the problem, \( \frac{1}{5} \) of the total pencils were used after two months. We calculate this as follows:
   \[
   \text{Pencils used} = \frac{1}{5} \times \text{Total pencils} = \frac{1}{5} \times 300 = 60 \text{ pencils}
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of pencils remaining after two months:**
   To find the remaining pencils, we subtract the number of pencils used from the total number of pencils:
   \[
   \text{Remaining pencils} = \text{Total pencils} - \text{Pencils used} = 300 - 60 = 240 \text{ pencils}
   \]

4. **Determine how many pencils are left at the end of the year:**
   At the end of the year, only \( \frac{1}{3} \) of the remaining pencils are left. We calculate this as follows:
   \[
   \text{Pencils left} = \frac{1}{3} \times \text{Remaining pencils} = \frac{1}{3} \times 240 = 80 \text{ pencils}
   \]

5. **Final answer:**
   The number of pencils left at the end of the year is:
   \[
   \boxed{80}
   \]
