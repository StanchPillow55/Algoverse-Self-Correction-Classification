Question ID: 471
Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial Position**: Earl starts on the first floor of the condominium building. We can denote this position as:
   \[
   \text{Current Floor} = 1
   \]

2. **Going Up 5 Floors**: Earl then goes up 5 floors. We can calculate his new position:
   \[
   \text{Current Floor} = 1 + 5 = 6
   \]

3. **Going Down 2 Floors**: Next, Earl goes down 2 floors. We update his position again:
   \[
   \text{Current Floor} = 6 - 2 = 4
   \]

4. **Going Up 7 Floors**: Earl then goes up 7 floors. We calculate his position once more:
   \[
   \text{Current Floor} = 4 + 7 = 11
   \]

5. **Distance from the Top of the Building**: We are told that at this point, Earl is 9 floors away from the top of the building. Let \( T \) represent the total number of floors in the building. According to the problem, we can express this relationship as:
   \[
   T - 11 = 9
   \]

6. **Solving for \( T \)**: To find the total number of floors \( T \), we can rearrange the equation:
   \[
   T = 11 + 9
   \]
   \[
   T = 20
   \]

Thus, the total number of floors in the building is \( \boxed{20} \).
