==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of floors in the building based on Earl's movements and the information given.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Position**: Earl starts on the first floor. We can denote his starting floor as \( F_1 = 1 \).

2. **First Movement**: Earl goes up 5 floors. If he starts on the first floor, moving up 5 floors means he is now on:
   \[
   F_2 = F_1 + 5 = 1 + 5 = 6
   \]
   So, Earl is on the 6th floor after his first movement.

3. **Second Movement**: Earl goes down 2 floors. From the 6th floor, moving down 2 floors means he is now on:
   \[
   F_3 = F_2 - 2 = 6 - 2 = 4
   \]
   So, Earl is on the 4th floor after his second movement.

4. **Third Movement**: Earl goes up 7 floors. From the 4th floor, moving up 7 floors means he is now on:
   \[
   F_4 = F_3 + 7 = 4 + 7 = 11
   \]
   So, Earl is on the 11th floor after his third movement.

5. **Final Information**: Earl is 9 floors away from the top of the building. This means that the top floor of the building is 9 floors above the 11th floor:
   \[
   \text{Top Floor} = F_4 + 9 = 11 + 9 = 20
   \]

Therefore, the building has a total of 20 floors.

**Final Answer**: The building has 20 floors.
