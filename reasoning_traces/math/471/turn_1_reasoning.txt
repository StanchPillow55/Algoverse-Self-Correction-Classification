Question ID: 471
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of floors in the building based on Earl's movements and the information given.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Starting Point:**
   - Earl starts on the first floor. Let's denote the first floor as floor 1.

2. **First Movement:**
   - Earl goes up 5 floors. 
   - Starting from floor 1, moving up 5 floors means Earl is now on floor \(1 + 5 = 6\).

3. **Second Movement:**
   - Earl goes down 2 floors.
   - From floor 6, moving down 2 floors means Earl is now on floor \(6 - 2 = 4\).

4. **Third Movement:**
   - Earl goes up 7 floors.
   - From floor 4, moving up 7 floors means Earl is now on floor \(4 + 7 = 11\).

5. **Information about the Top of the Building:**
   - Earl is 9 floors away from the top of the building when he is on floor 11.
   - This means the top floor is \(11 + 9 = 20\).

Thus, the building has 20 floors.

**Final Answer:**
The building has 20 floors.
