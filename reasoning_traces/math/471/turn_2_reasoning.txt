Question ID: 471
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, let's carefully track Earl's movements and use the information given to determine the total number of floors in the building.

1. **Initial Position:**
   - Earl starts on the first floor. Let's denote his starting floor as \( F_1 = 1 \).

2. **First Movement:**
   - Earl goes up 5 floors. So, his new position is:
     \[
     F_2 = F_1 + 5 = 1 + 5 = 6
     \]

3. **Second Movement:**
   - Earl goes down 2 floors. His new position is:
     \[
     F_3 = F_2 - 2 = 6 - 2 = 4
     \]

4. **Third Movement:**
   - Earl goes up 7 floors. His new position is:
     \[
     F_4 = F_3 + 7 = 4 + 7 = 11
     \]

5. **Information about the Top of the Building:**
   - At this point, Earl is 9 floors away from the top of the building. This means that the top floor is 9 floors above his current position on the 11th floor.
   - Therefore, the top floor is:
     \[
     F_{\text{top}} = F_4 + 9 = 11 + 9 = 20
     \]

Thus, the building has a total of 20 floors.

**Final Answer:**
The building has 20 floors.
