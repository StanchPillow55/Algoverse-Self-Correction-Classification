==================================================

Let \( x \) be the initial weight of the small triceratops in kilograms.

1. **Tyrannosaurus rex eats half of the triceratops:**
   The T-Rex eats half of the triceratops, which means it consumes:
   \[
   \text{Meat eaten by T-Rex} = \frac{x}{2}
   \]
   After the T-Rex eats, the remaining meat is:
   \[
   \text{Remaining meat} = x - \frac{x}{2} = \frac{x}{2}
   \]

2. **Velociraptors scavenge half of what is left:**
   The velociraptors then scavenge half of the remaining meat. The amount they scavenge is:
   \[
   \text{Meat eaten by velociraptors} = \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{x}{2} = \frac{x}{4}
   \]
   After the velociraptors eat, the remaining meat is:
   \[
   \text{Remaining meat} = \frac{x}{2} - \frac{x}{4} = \frac{2x}{4} - \frac{x}{4} = \frac{x}{4}
   \]

3. **Allosaurus eat the last 270 kilograms of meat:**
   We know that the Allosaurus eat the last 270 kilograms of meat, which means:
   \[
   \frac{x}{4} = 270
   \]

4. **Solving for \( x \):**
   To find \( x \), we multiply both sides of the equation by 4:
   \[
   x = 270 \times 4 = 1080
   \]

Thus, the initial weight of the small triceratops before the T-Rex ate is:
\[
\boxed{1080} \text{ kilograms}
\]
