Question ID: 73
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to find out the total number of people who will be having the trail mix. This includes the 13 members of the baseball team, the 3 coaches, and the 2 helpers. 

So, we add these numbers together:

13 (team members) + 3 (coaches) + 2 (helpers) = 18 people

Next, we need to determine how many packs of trail mix Roger needs to buy. Each pack contains 6 individual pouches. 

To find out how many packs Roger needs to buy, we divide the total number of people by the number of pouches in each pack:

18 (people) รท 6 (pouches per pack) = 3 packs

However, since the result of the division is not a whole number, Roger needs to buy an additional pack to ensure everyone gets a pouch. 

So, Roger needs to buy 4 packs of trail mix. 

Final Answer: Roger needs to buy 4 packs of trail mix.
