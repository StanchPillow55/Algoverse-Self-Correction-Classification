Question ID: 73
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to calculate the total cost of the five cell phones, including the interest charged, and then determine how much Shiela will pay each month over the 3-month installment period.

### Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the cell phones

Shiela bought 5 cell phones at $150 each. 

\[
\text{Total cost of cell phones} = \text{Number of phones} \times \text{Cost per phone}
\]
\[
\text{Total cost of cell phones} = 5 \times 150 = 750
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the interest charged

A 2% interest will be charged on the total cost of the cell phones. First, we need to calculate the interest amount.

\[
\text{Interest} = \text{Total cost} \times \text{Interest rate}
\]
\[
\text{Interest} = 750 \times 0.02 = 15
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the total amount to be paid

Now, we add the interest to the total cost of the cell phones to find the total amount Shiela will pay.

\[
\text{Total amount to be paid} = \text{Total cost} + \text{Interest}
\]
\[
\text{Total amount to be paid} = 750 + 15 = 765
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the monthly payment

Shiela will pay this total amount over 3 months. To find the monthly payment, we divide the total amount by the number of months.

\[
\text{Monthly payment} = \frac{\text{Total amount to be paid}}{\text{Number of months}}
\]
\[
\text{Monthly payment} = \frac{765}{3} = 255
\]

### Final Answer

Shiela will pay **$255** each month for 3 months.
