Question ID: 73
Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to find out the total number of people who will be needing trail mix. We do this by adding the number of team members, coaches, and helpers together.

13 (team members) + 3 (coaches) + 2 (helpers) = 18 people

Next, we need to figure out how many packs of trail mix Roger needs to buy. Each pack contains 6 individual pouches, so we divide the total number of people by the number of pouches in each pack.

18 (people) รท 6 (pouches per pack) = 3 packs

However, since we can't buy a fraction of a pack, and we need to make sure everyone gets a pouch, we need to round up to the next whole number. So, Roger needs to buy 4 packs of trail mix.

Final Answer: Roger needs to buy 4 packs of trail mix.
