Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To determine how many packs of trail mix Roger needs to buy, we first need to calculate the total number of individuals who will need a snack.

1. **Calculate the total number of people:**
   - Number of team members: 13
   - Number of coaches: 3
   - Number of helpers: 2

   We add these numbers together:
   \[
   \text{Total people} = 13 + 3 + 2 = 18
   \]

2. **Determine how many pouches are needed:**
   Roger needs one pouch of trail mix for each of the 18 individuals. Therefore, he needs:
   \[
   \text{Total pouches needed} = 18
   \]

3. **Calculate how many packs of trail mix are required:**
   Each pack of trail mix contains 6 individual pouches. To find out how many packs Roger needs, we divide the total number of pouches by the number of pouches per pack:
   \[
   \text{Number of packs needed} = \frac{\text{Total pouches needed}}{\text{Pouches per pack}} = \frac{18}{6} = 3
   \]

4. **Final answer:**
   Since 18 is exactly divisible by 6, Roger needs to buy exactly 3 packs of trail mix.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{3}
\]
