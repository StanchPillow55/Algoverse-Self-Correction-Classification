==================================================

To determine how much Shiela will pay each month for the five cell phones over a 3-month installment period with a 2% interest charge, we will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total cost of the cell phones**:
   Shiela bought 5 cell phones at $150 each.
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = 5 \times 150 = 750 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Calculate the interest charged**:
   The interest rate is 2% per month. We need to calculate the total interest for 3 months.
   First, we calculate the interest for one month:
   \[
   \text{Monthly interest} = \text{Total cost} \times \text{Interest rate} = 750 \times 0.02 = 15 \text{ dollars}
   \]
   Now, we calculate the total interest for 3 months:
   \[
   \text{Total interest for 3 months} = \text{Monthly interest} \times 3 = 15 \times 3 = 45 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total amount to be paid**:
   The total amount Shiela will pay includes the original cost of the cell phones plus the total interest.
   \[
   \text{Total amount to be paid} = \text{Total cost} + \text{Total interest} = 750 + 45 = 795 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Calculate the monthly payment**:
   Since Shiela will pay this total amount over 3 months, we divide the total amount by 3 to find the monthly payment.
   \[
   \text{Monthly payment} = \frac{\text{Total amount to be paid}}{3} = \frac{795}{3} = 265 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Thus, Shiela will pay **$265** each month for 3 months.

**Final Answer**: Shiela will pay $265 each month for 3 months.
