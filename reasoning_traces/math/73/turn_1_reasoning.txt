Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To determine how much Shiela will pay each month for the five cell phones over a 3-month installment period with a 2% interest charge, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total cost of the cell phones**:
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = \text{Number of phones} \times \text{Cost per phone}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = 5 \times 150 = 750
   \]

2. **Calculate the total interest charged**:
   The interest is charged at 2% per month on the total cost. First, we need to find the interest for one month:
   \[
   \text{Monthly interest} = \text{Total cost} \times \text{Interest rate}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Monthly interest} = 750 \times 0.02 = 15
   \]

3. **Calculate the total amount to be paid after 3 months**:
   Since the interest is charged for each of the 3 months, we multiply the monthly interest by 3 and add it to the total cost:
   \[
   \text{Total interest for 3 months} = \text{Monthly interest} \times 3
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total interest for 3 months} = 15 \times 3 = 45
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total amount to be paid} = \text{Total cost} + \text{Total interest for 3 months}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total amount to be paid} = 750 + 45 = 795
   \]

4. **Calculate the monthly payment**:
   To find out how much Shiela will pay each month, we divide the total amount to be paid by the number of months:
   \[
   \text{Monthly payment} = \frac{\text{Total amount to be paid}}{\text{Number of months}}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Monthly payment} = \frac{795}{3} = 265
   \]

Thus, Shiela will pay **$265 each month** for 3 months.

**Final Answer**: $265 per month.
