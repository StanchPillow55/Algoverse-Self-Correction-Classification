Question ID: 73
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, let's find out how many people in total Roger needs to provide snacks for. 

He has 13 members on his baseball team, 3 coaches, and 2 helpers. 

So, the total number of people is 13 (team members) + 3 (coaches) + 2 (helpers) = 18 people.

The trail mix comes in packs of 6 individual pouches. So, to find out how many packs Roger needs to buy, we need to divide the total number of people by the number of pouches in each pack.

So, 18 (total people) รท 6 (pouches per pack) = 3 packs.

However, since the number of people is not a multiple of the number of pouches in each pack, Roger will need to buy an additional pack to make sure everyone gets a pouch.

Therefore, Roger needs to buy 3 + 1 = 4 packs of trail mix.

So, the final answer is that Roger needs to buy 4 packs of trail mix.
