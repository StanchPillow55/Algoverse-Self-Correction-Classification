==================================================

It seems like the problem statement is incomplete. However, I can provide a general approach to solving a math problem involving the number 360. Let's assume a common type of problem involving 360, such as finding its factors, prime factorization, or solving a problem related to angles in a circle. I'll cover a few possibilities:

### 1. Prime Factorization of 360

To find the prime factorization of 360, we need to divide it by the smallest prime numbers until we reach 1.

1. **Divide by 2** (the smallest prime number):
   \[
   360 \div 2 = 180
   \]
   \[
   180 \div 2 = 90
   \]
   \[
   90 \div 2 = 45
   \]
   Now 45 is not divisible by 2.

2. **Divide by 3** (the next smallest prime number):
   \[
   45 \div 3 = 15
   \]
   \[
   15 \div 3 = 5
   \]
   Now 5 is not divisible by 3.

3. **Divide by 5** (the next smallest prime number):
   \[
   5 \div 5 = 1
   \]

Thus, the prime factorization of 360 is:
\[
360 = 2^3 \times 3^2 \times 5^1
\]

### 2. Factors of 360

To find all factors of 360, we use its prime factorization:
\[
360 = 2^3 \times 3^2 \times 5^1
\]

The total number of factors can be found by adding 1 to each of the exponents in the prime factorization and multiplying the results:
\[
(3+1)(2+1)(1+1) = 4 \times 3 \times 2 = 24
\]

The factors of 360 are all the products of the form \(2^a \times 3^b \times 5^c\) where \(0 \leq a \leq 3\), \(0 \leq b \leq 2\), and \(0 \leq c \leq 1\).

### 3. Angle Problem Involving 360

If the problem involves angles, such as finding the measure of an angle in a circle, remember that a full circle is 360 degrees. For example, if you need to find the measure of one angle in a regular polygon with \(n\) sides, you can use the formula for the interior angle:
\[
\text{Interior angle} = \frac{(n-2) \times 180}{n}
\]

If you have a specific problem involving 360, please provide more details, and I can tailor the solution to that problem.
