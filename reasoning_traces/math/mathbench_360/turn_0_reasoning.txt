It seems like your question is a bit vague, as "Sample math problem 360" doesn't specify what kind of math problem you're referring to. However, I can interpret this in a few ways. 

If you meant to ask for a problem involving the number 360, I can create a problem based on that. Let's consider a problem involving the properties of the number 360, such as its factors or its relationship to angles in geometry.

### Problem: Find the factors of 360 and determine how many of them are prime.

**Step 1: Find the prime factorization of 360.**

To find the prime factorization, we can divide 360 by the smallest prime numbers until we reach 1.

1. Divide by 2 (the smallest prime):
   \[
   360 \div 2 = 180
   \]
2. Divide by 2 again:
   \[
   180 \div 2 = 90
   \]
3. Divide by 2 again:
   \[
   90 \div 2 = 45
   \]
4. Now, 45 is not divisible by 2, so we move to the next prime number, which is 3:
   \[
   45 \div 3 = 15
   \]
5. Divide by 3 again:
   \[
   15 \div 3 = 5
   \]
6. Finally, 5 is a prime number, so we stop here.

Thus, the prime factorization of 360 is:
\[
360 = 2^3 \times 3^2 \times 5^1
\]

**Step 2: List the factors of 360.**

To find all the factors of 360, we can use the prime factorization. The formula for finding the number of factors from the prime factorization \( p_1^{e_1} \times p_2^{e_2} \times ... \times p_n^{e_n} \) is:
\[
(e_1 + 1)(e_2 + 1)(e_n + 1)
\]
where \( e_i \) are the exponents in the prime factorization.

For 360:
- The exponent of 2 is 3, so \( e_1 + 1 = 3 + 1 = 4 \)
- The exponent of 3 is 2, so \( e_2 + 1 = 2 + 1 = 3 \)
- The exponent of 5 is 1, so \( e_3 + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2 \)

Now, we calculate the total number of factors:
\[
(3 + 1)(2 + 1)(1 + 1) = 4 \times 3 \times 2 = 24
\]

**Step 3: Identify the prime factors.**

From the prime factorization \( 2^3 \times 3^2 \times 5^1 \), the prime factors of 360 are:
- 2
- 3
- 5

**Step 4: Count the prime factors.**

There are 3 prime factors: 2, 3, and 5.

### Final Answer:
The number of factors of 360 is 24, and the number of prime factors is 3.
