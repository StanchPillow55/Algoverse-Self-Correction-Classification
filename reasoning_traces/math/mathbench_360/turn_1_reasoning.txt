Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what is being asked. The problem statement is "Sample math problem 360." This is quite vague, but let's assume it refers to a mathematical problem involving the number 360. 

One common type of problem involving the number 360 is finding its factors, prime factorization, or properties related to angles (since 360 degrees is a full circle). Let's explore these possibilities:

### 1. Prime Factorization of 360

To find the prime factorization of 360, we start by dividing it by the smallest prime number, which is 2, and continue dividing by prime numbers until we reach 1.

1. \( 360 \div 2 = 180 \)
2. \( 180 \div 2 = 90 \)
3. \( 90 \div 2 = 45 \)
4. \( 45 \div 3 = 15 \)
5. \( 15 \div 3 = 5 \)
6. \( 5 \div 5 = 1 \)

So, the prime factorization of 360 is \( 2^3 \times 3^2 \times 5 \).

### 2. Factors of 360

Using the prime factorization, we can determine the total number of factors. The formula to find the number of factors from the prime factorization \( p^a \times q^b \times r^c \) is \((a+1)(b+1)(c+1)\).

For 360, which is \( 2^3 \times 3^2 \times 5^1 \):

- \( a = 3 \), \( b = 2 \), \( c = 1 \)
- Number of factors = \((3+1)(2+1)(1+1) = 4 \times 3 \times 2 = 24\)

### 3. Properties Related to Angles

360 is significant in geometry as it represents the total degrees in a circle. This means that if you rotate around a point by 360 degrees, you return to your starting position.

### Conclusion

Given the problem statement "Sample math problem 360," we explored several mathematical aspects of the number 360. We found its prime factorization, calculated the number of factors, and noted its significance in geometry.

**Final Answer:**
- Prime Factorization: \( 2^3 \times 3^2 \times 5 \)
- Number of Factors: 24
- Significance: 360 degrees is a full circle.
