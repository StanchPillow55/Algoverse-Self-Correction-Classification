==================================================

It seems like the question is a bit unclear as "Sample math problem 360" does not specify a particular math problem to solve. However, I will assume you want me to demonstrate how to solve a math problem that could be related to the number 360. 

Let's consider a common type of problem involving the number 360: finding the prime factorization of 360.

### Step 1: Understanding Prime Factorization
Prime factorization is the process of expressing a number as the product of its prime factors. A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that cannot be formed by multiplying two smaller natural numbers.

### Step 2: Start with the Number
We start with the number 360.

### Step 3: Divide by the Smallest Prime Number
The smallest prime number is 2. We check if 360 is divisible by 2:

\[
360 \div 2 = 180
\]

Since 360 is even, we can divide by 2 again:

\[
180 \div 2 = 90
\]

We can divide by 2 one more time:

\[
90 \div 2 = 45
\]

Now, 45 is not even, so we move to the next prime number, which is 3.

### Step 4: Divide by 3
We check if 45 is divisible by 3:

\[
45 \div 3 = 15
\]

We can divide by 3 again:

\[
15 \div 3 = 5
\]

Now we are left with 5, which is a prime number.

### Step 5: Compile the Prime Factors
Now we can compile all the prime factors we have found:

- From the divisions by 2: \(2^3\) (since we divided by 2 three times)
- From the divisions by 3: \(3^2\) (since we divided by 3 two times)
- The last factor is 5, which is \(5^1\).

### Step 6: Write the Prime Factorization
Putting it all together, the prime factorization of 360 is:

\[
360 = 2^3 \times 3^2 \times 5^1
\]

### Final Answer
The prime factorization of 360 is:

\[
\boxed{2^3 \times 3^2 \times 5}
\] 

This concludes the problem-solving process for the prime factorization of 360. If you have a different math problem in mind, please provide more details, and I would be happy to assist!
