Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what is being asked. The problem statement is "Sample math problem 360." Without additional context, it's unclear what specific question is being posed. However, let's assume this refers to a common type of math problem involving the number 360. One possibility is that it involves finding the factors, divisors, or properties of the number 360.

Let's explore the number 360 in terms of its mathematical properties:

### Step 1: Prime Factorization of 360

To understand the properties of 360, we can start by finding its prime factorization.

1. **Divide by 2 (smallest prime number):**
   \[
   360 \div 2 = 180
   \]
2. **Divide 180 by 2:**
   \[
   180 \div 2 = 90
   \]
3. **Divide 90 by 2:**
   \[
   90 \div 2 = 45
   \]
4. **Divide 45 by 3 (next smallest prime number):**
   \[
   45 \div 3 = 15
   \]
5. **Divide 15 by 3:**
   \[
   15 \div 3 = 5
   \]
6. **Divide 5 by 5 (next smallest prime number):**
   \[
   5 \div 5 = 1
   \]

Thus, the prime factorization of 360 is:
\[
360 = 2^3 \times 3^2 \times 5^1
\]

### Step 2: Number of Divisors

The number of divisors of a number can be determined from its prime factorization. If a number \( n \) has the prime factorization \( p_1^{a_1} \times p_2^{a_2} \times \ldots \times p_k^{a_k} \), then the number of divisors \( D(n) \) is given by:
\[
D(n) = (a_1 + 1)(a_2 + 1) \ldots (a_k + 1)
\]

For 360, with the prime factorization \( 2^3 \times 3^2 \times 5^1 \), the number of divisors is:
\[
D(360) = (3 + 1)(2 + 1)(1 + 1) = 4 \times 3 \times 2 = 24
\]

### Step 3: Sum of Divisors

The sum of the divisors can be calculated using the formula for the sum of divisors based on prime factorization:
\[
\sigma(n) = (1 + p_1 + p_1^2 + \ldots + p_1^{a_1})(1 + p_2 + \ldots + p_2^{a_2}) \ldots (1 + p_k + \ldots + p_k^{a_k})
\]

For 360:
\[
\sigma(360) = (1 + 2 + 4 + 8)(1 + 3 + 9)(1 + 5)
\]

Calculating each part:
- \( 1 + 2 + 4 + 8 = 15 \)
- \( 1 + 3 + 9 = 13 \)
- \( 1 + 5 = 6 \)

Thus:
\[
\sigma(360) = 15 \times 13 \times 6
\]

Calculating step-by-step:
- \( 15 \times 13 = 195 \)
- \( 195 \times 6 = 1170 \)

### Conclusion

The number 360 has several interesting properties:
- **Prime Factorization:** \( 2^3 \times 3^2 \times 5^1 \)
- **Number of Divisors:** 24
- **Sum of Divisors:** 1170

These calculations reveal the structure and properties of the number 360. If the problem intended a different interpretation, please provide additional context or details. However, based on the information given, these are the mathematical insights related to the number 360.

**Final Answer:**
- Prime Factorization: \( 2^3 \times 3^2 \times 5^1 \)
- Number of Divisors: 24
- Sum of Divisors: 1170
