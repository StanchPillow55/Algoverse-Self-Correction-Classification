==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 360," we first need to clarify what the problem is asking. Since the problem statement is not specific, I'll assume it involves basic operations or properties related to the number 360. Let's explore some possibilities:

### 1. **Factors of 360:**
Finding the factors of 360 involves determining all the integers that divide 360 without leaving a remainder.

- Start with the smallest prime number, 2:
  - 360 is even, so divide by 2: \( 360 \div 2 = 180 \)
  - 180 is even, so divide by 2 again: \( 180 \div 2 = 90 \)
  - 90 is even, so divide by 2 again: \( 90 \div 2 = 45 \)
  - 45 is not even, so move to the next prime number, 3:
    - Sum of digits of 45 is 9, which is divisible by 3, so divide by 3: \( 45 \div 3 = 15 \)
    - Sum of digits of 15 is 6, which is divisible by 3, so divide by 3: \( 15 \div 3 = 5 \)
  - 5 is a prime number.

Thus, the prime factorization of 360 is:
\[ 360 = 2^3 \times 3^2 \times 5^1 \]

### 2. **Divisors of 360:**
Using the prime factorization, we can find the total number of divisors.

- The formula for finding the number of divisors from prime factorization \( p_1^{a_1} \times p_2^{a_2} \times \ldots \times p_n^{a_n} \) is:
  \[ (a_1 + 1)(a_2 + 1) \ldots (a_n + 1) \]

For 360:
- \( 2^3 \) contributes \( 3 + 1 = 4 \)
- \( 3^2 \) contributes \( 2 + 1 = 3 \)
- \( 5^1 \) contributes \( 1 + 1 = 2 \)

Thus, the number of divisors is:
\[ 4 \times 3 \times 2 = 24 \]

### 3. **Sum of Divisors:**
To find the sum of all divisors, use the formula for the sum of divisors based on prime factorization:
\[ \sigma(n) = (1 + p_1 + p_1^2 + \ldots + p_1^{a_1})(1 + p_2 + \ldots + p_2^{a_2}) \ldots (1 + p_n + \ldots + p_n^{a_n}) \]

For 360:
- For \( 2^3 \): \( 1 + 2 + 4 + 8 = 15 \)
- For \( 3^2 \): \( 1 + 3 + 9 = 13 \)
- For \( 5^1 \): \( 1 + 5 = 6 \)

Thus, the sum of divisors is:
\[ 15 \times 13 \times 6 = 1170 \]

### 4. **Other Properties:**
- **360 as an angle measure:** 360 degrees is a full circle.
- **360 in terms of radians:** \( 360^\circ = 2\pi \) radians.

### Final Answer:
Given the lack of specificity in the problem statement, I've explored several mathematical properties of the number 360. If you have a specific question about 360, please provide more details. Otherwise, the exploration above covers its prime factorization, number of divisors, sum of divisors, and its significance in geometry.
