==================================================

To solve the sample math problem "360," let's assume that the problem is asking us to analyze the number 360 in various mathematical contexts. Here, I'll explore several aspects of the number 360:

### 1. **Prime Factorization:**

The first step is to find the prime factorization of 360. This involves breaking down 360 into its prime factors.

- Start by dividing 360 by the smallest prime number, which is 2:
  \[
  360 \div 2 = 180
  \]
- Divide 180 by 2:
  \[
  180 \div 2 = 90
  \]
- Divide 90 by 2:
  \[
  90 \div 2 = 45
  \]
- 45 is not divisible by 2, so move to the next prime number, which is 3:
  \[
  45 \div 3 = 15
  \]
- Divide 15 by 3:
  \[
  15 \div 3 = 5
  \]
- Finally, 5 is a prime number.

Thus, the prime factorization of 360 is:
\[
360 = 2^3 \times 3^2 \times 5
\]

### 2. **Divisors:**

To find the total number of divisors of 360, use its prime factorization. If a number \( n \) has the prime factorization \( p_1^{a_1} \times p_2^{a_2} \times \ldots \times p_k^{a_k} \), the number of divisors is given by:
\[
(a_1 + 1)(a_2 + 1) \ldots (a_k + 1)
\]

For 360:
- \( a_1 = 3 \) for the prime 2
- \( a_2 = 2 \) for the prime 3
- \( a_3 = 1 \) for the prime 5

The number of divisors is:
\[
(3 + 1)(2 + 1)(1 + 1) = 4 \times 3 \times 2 = 24
\]

### 3. **Sum of Divisors:**

To find the sum of the divisors, use the formula for the sum of divisors based on prime factorization:
\[
\sigma(n) = (1 + p_1 + p_1^2 + \ldots + p_1^{a_1})(1 + p_2 + \ldots + p_2^{a_2}) \ldots (1 + p_k + \ldots + p_k^{a_k})
\]

For 360:
- For \( 2^3 \): \( 1 + 2 + 4 + 8 = 15 \)
- For \( 3^2 \): \( 1 + 3 + 9 = 13 \)
- For \( 5^1 \): \( 1 + 5 = 6 \)

The sum of the divisors is:
\[
15 \times 13 \times 6 = 1170
\]

### 4. **Properties of 360:**

- **Perfect Number:** 360 is not a perfect number because the sum of its proper divisors (divisors excluding itself) is not equal to 360.
- **Highly Composite Number:** 360 is a highly composite number because it has more divisors than any smaller positive integer.
- **Degrees in a Circle:** 360 is the number of degrees in a full circle, making it significant in geometry.

### Final Answer:

The number 360 has a prime factorization of \( 2^3 \times 3^2 \times 5 \), 24 divisors, and the sum of its divisors is 1170. It is a highly composite number and represents the degrees in a circle.
