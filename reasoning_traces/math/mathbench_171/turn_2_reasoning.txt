==================================================

To solve "Sample math problem 171," I need more specific information about the problem itself. Since the problem statement is not provided, I'll create a sample math problem and solve it step by step.

**Sample Math Problem:**

Calculate the area of a triangle with vertices at points \( A(1, 2) \), \( B(4, 6) \), and \( C(6, 2) \).

**Solution:**

To find the area of a triangle given its vertices, we can use the formula derived from the determinant of a matrix:

\[
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \left| x_1(y_2-y_3) + x_2(y_3-y_1) + x_3(y_1-y_2) \right|
\]

where \((x_1, y_1)\), \((x_2, y_2)\), and \((x_3, y_3)\) are the coordinates of the vertices \(A\), \(B\), and \(C\), respectively.

**Step-by-step Calculation:**

1. **Identify the coordinates:**
   - \( A(1, 2) \) implies \( x_1 = 1 \), \( y_1 = 2 \)
   - \( B(4, 6) \) implies \( x_2 = 4 \), \( y_2 = 6 \)
   - \( C(6, 2) \) implies \( x_3 = 6 \), \( y_3 = 2 \)

2. **Substitute the coordinates into the formula:**

   \[
   \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \left| 1(6-2) + 4(2-2) + 6(2-6) \right|
   \]

3. **Calculate each term:**

   - \( 1(6-2) = 1 \times 4 = 4 \)
   - \( 4(2-2) = 4 \times 0 = 0 \)
   - \( 6(2-6) = 6 \times (-4) = -24 \)

4. **Sum the terms:**

   \[
   4 + 0 - 24 = -20
   \]

5. **Take the absolute value and multiply by \(\frac{1}{2}\):**

   \[
   \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times |-20| = \frac{1}{2} \times 20 = 10
   \]

**Final Answer:**

The area of the triangle with vertices at \( A(1, 2) \), \( B(4, 6) \), and \( C(6, 2) \) is \( 10 \) square units.
