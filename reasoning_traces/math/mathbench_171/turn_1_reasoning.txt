==================================================

To solve "Sample math problem 171," we first need to understand what the problem is asking. Since the problem statement is not provided, I'll create a hypothetical math problem and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Math Problem 171:**

*Calculate the area of a triangle with a base of 10 units and a height of 5 units.*

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Identify the Formula:**
   The area \( A \) of a triangle can be calculated using the formula:
   \[
   A = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height}
   \]

2. **Substitute the Given Values:**
   In this problem, the base \( b \) is 10 units, and the height \( h \) is 5 units. Substitute these values into the formula:
   \[
   A = \frac{1}{2} \times 10 \times 5
   \]

3. **Perform the Multiplication:**
   First, multiply the base and the height:
   \[
   10 \times 5 = 50
   \]

4. **Calculate the Area:**
   Now, multiply the result by \(\frac{1}{2}\):
   \[
   A = \frac{1}{2} \times 50 = 25
   \]

5. **State the Final Answer:**
   The area of the triangle is 25 square units.

This completes the solution to the hypothetical math problem. If you have a specific "Sample math problem 171" in mind, please provide the details, and I will solve it accordingly.
