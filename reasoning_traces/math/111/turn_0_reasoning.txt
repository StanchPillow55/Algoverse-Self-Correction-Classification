==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of money Paul spent on his groceries and then subtract that from the amount of money he initially had to find out how much he has left.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the prices of each item:**
   - Bread costs $2.
   - Butter costs $3.
   - Juice costs two times the price of the bread.

2. **Calculate the cost of the juice:**
   - Since the juice costs two times the price of the bread, and the bread costs $2, the cost of the juice is:
     \[
     \text{Cost of juice} = 2 \times \text{Cost of bread} = 2 \times 2 = 4
     \]

3. **Calculate the total cost of all the items:**
   - Add up the costs of the bread, butter, and juice:
     \[
     \text{Total cost} = \text{Cost of bread} + \text{Cost of butter} + \text{Cost of juice}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total cost} = 2 + 3 + 4 = 9
     \]

4. **Determine how much money Paul has left:**
   - Paul initially had $15. We subtract the total cost of the groceries from this amount to find out how much money he has left:
     \[
     \text{Money left} = \text{Initial amount} - \text{Total cost}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Money left} = 15 - 9 = 6
     \]

Therefore, Paul has $6 left after buying the groceries.

**Final Answer: Paul has $6 left.**
