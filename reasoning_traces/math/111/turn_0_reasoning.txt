==================================================

To determine how much money Paul has left after his shopping, we need to calculate the total cost of the groceries he bought and then subtract that from the amount of money he had initially.

1. **Identify the prices of the items:**
   - Bread: $2
   - Butter: $3
   - Juice: The price of the juice is two times the price of the bread.

2. **Calculate the price of the juice:**
   \[
   \text{Price of juice} = 2 \times \text{Price of bread} = 2 \times 2 = 4
   \]
   So, the juice costs $4.

3. **Calculate the total cost of all items:**
   Now we will add the prices of all the items together:
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = \text{Price of bread} + \text{Price of butter} + \text{Price of juice}
   \]
   Substituting the values we have:
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = 2 + 3 + 4 = 9
   \]

4. **Determine how much money Paul has left:**
   Paul initially had $15. We will subtract the total cost of the groceries from this amount:
   \[
   \text{Money left} = \text{Initial amount} - \text{Total cost}
   \]
   Substituting the values:
   \[
   \text{Money left} = 15 - 9 = 6
   \]

5. **Final answer:**
   Paul has $6 left after his shopping.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{6}
\]
