Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 432," we first need to understand what the problem is asking. However, the phrase "Sample math problem 432" does not provide any specific details or context about the problem itself. It seems to be a placeholder or reference to a specific problem that is not fully described here.

In order to proceed, let's assume that "Sample math problem 432" refers to a hypothetical math problem. Since no specific details are provided, I'll create a sample math problem involving the number 432 and solve it step by step.

**Sample Math Problem:**
Calculate the sum of the digits of the number 432 and determine if the sum is a prime number.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Identify the Digits of the Number:**
   The number given is 432. The digits of this number are:
   - Hundreds place: 4
   - Tens place: 3
   - Units place: 2

2. **Calculate the Sum of the Digits:**
   To find the sum of the digits, we add them together:
   \[
   4 + 3 + 2 = 9
   \]

3. **Determine if the Sum is a Prime Number:**
   A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. Let's check if 9 is a prime number:
   - The number 9 is greater than 1.
   - The divisors of 9 are 1, 3, and 9.
   - Since 9 has divisors other than 1 and itself (specifically, 3), it is not a prime number.

**Conclusion:**
The sum of the digits of the number 432 is 9, and 9 is not a prime number.

**Final Answer:**
The sum of the digits of 432 is 9, and it is not a prime number.
