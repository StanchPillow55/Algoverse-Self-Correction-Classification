==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 432," we need to first understand what the problem is asking. However, the problem statement "Sample math problem 432" is not clear or specific. It seems to be a placeholder or reference to a specific problem that hasn't been fully described here.

To proceed, let's assume this is a placeholder for a typical math problem. Since we don't have the actual problem, I'll create a hypothetical math problem involving the number 432 and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**
Find the sum of the digits of the number 432 and determine if the sum is a prime number.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Identify the digits of the number 432:**
   - The number 432 consists of three digits: 4, 3, and 2.

2. **Calculate the sum of the digits:**
   - Add the digits together: \(4 + 3 + 2\).

3. **Perform the addition:**
   \[
   4 + 3 = 7
   \]
   \[
   7 + 2 = 9
   \]

4. **Determine if the sum is a prime number:**
   - A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.
   - The number 9 is greater than 1, but it is not a prime number because it can be divided evenly by 1, 3, and 9.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The sum of the digits of 432 is 9.
   - 9 is not a prime number.

**Final Answer:**
The sum of the digits of the number 432 is 9, and 9 is not a prime number.
