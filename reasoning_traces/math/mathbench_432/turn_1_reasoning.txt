==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 432," we first need to understand what the problem is asking. However, the problem statement "Sample math problem 432" is not clear or specific enough to determine what the actual mathematical question is. It seems like a placeholder or reference to a specific problem that is not provided here.

To proceed, let's assume that "Sample math problem 432" refers to a generic math problem involving the number 432. Without additional context, I will create a hypothetical math problem involving the number 432 and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**
Find the prime factorization of the number 432.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   We need to express the number 432 as a product of prime numbers.

2. **Start with the Smallest Prime:**
   Begin dividing 432 by the smallest prime number, which is 2.

3. **Divide by 2:**
   \[
   432 \div 2 = 216
   \]
   Since 432 is even, it is divisible by 2.

4. **Continue Dividing by 2:**
   \[
   216 \div 2 = 108
   \]
   \[
   108 \div 2 = 54
   \]
   \[
   54 \div 2 = 27
   \]
   We continue dividing by 2 until we can no longer do so.

5. **Switch to the Next Prime Number:**
   Now, 27 is not divisible by 2, so we move to the next smallest prime number, which is 3.

6. **Divide by 3:**
   \[
   27 \div 3 = 9
   \]
   \[
   9 \div 3 = 3
   \]
   \[
   3 \div 3 = 1
   \]
   We continue dividing by 3 until we reach 1.

7. **Compile the Prime Factors:**
   We divided by 2 four times and by 3 three times. Therefore, the prime factorization of 432 is:
   \[
   432 = 2^4 \times 3^3
   \]

8. **Verify the Solution:**
   To verify, we can multiply the prime factors back together:
   \[
   2^4 = 16, \quad 3^3 = 27
   \]
   \[
   16 \times 27 = 432
   \]
   The multiplication confirms that the factorization is correct.

**Final Answer:**
The prime factorization of 432 is \(2^4 \times 3^3\).
