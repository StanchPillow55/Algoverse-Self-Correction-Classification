==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to establish the relationships between the ages of Jeff, Martha, and Mike based on the information provided.

1. **Identify Mike's Age**: 
   We know that Mike is 24 years old.

2. **Determine Martha's Age**: 
   The problem states that Martha is 4 years younger than Mike. Therefore, we can calculate Martha's age as follows:
   \[
   \text{Martha's age} = \text{Mike's age} - 4
   \]
   Substituting Mike's age:
   \[
   \text{Martha's age} = 24 - 4 = 20
   \]

3. **Determine Jeff's Age**: 
   The problem also states that Jeff is 10 years older than Martha. We can calculate Jeff's age using Martha's age:
   \[
   \text{Jeff's age} = \text{Martha's age} + 10
   \]
   Substituting Martha's age:
   \[
   \text{Jeff's age} = 20 + 10 = 30
   \]

4. **Final Answer**: 
   Therefore, Jeff is 30 years old.

In conclusion, after working through the relationships and calculations step by step, we find that Jeff's age is:
\[
\boxed{30}
\]
