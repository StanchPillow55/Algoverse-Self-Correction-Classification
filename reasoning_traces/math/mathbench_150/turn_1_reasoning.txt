Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 150," we need to first understand what the problem is asking. However, the phrase "Sample math problem 150" is quite vague and does not specify any particular mathematical operation or context. Therefore, I will assume that "150" is the number we need to work with, and I will explore several mathematical operations and concepts involving this number.

### Step 1: Basic Properties of 150

1. **Prime Factorization:**
   - To find the prime factorization of 150, we start by dividing by the smallest prime number, which is 2:
     \[
     150 \div 2 = 75
     \]
   - Next, we divide 75 by the next smallest prime number, which is 3:
     \[
     75 \div 3 = 25
     \]
   - Finally, we divide 25 by the next smallest prime number, which is 5:
     \[
     25 \div 5 = 5
     \]
   - And 5 divided by 5 gives us 1:
     \[
     5 \div 5 = 1
     \]
   - Therefore, the prime factorization of 150 is:
     \[
     150 = 2 \times 3 \times 5^2
     \]

2. **Divisors:**
   - Using the prime factorization, we can find the divisors of 150. The divisors are all the products of the prime factors taken at different powers:
     \[
     \text{Divisors of 150: } 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 10, 15, 25, 30, 50, 75, 150
     \]

3. **Sum of Divisors:**
   - To find the sum of the divisors, we add them up:
     \[
     1 + 2 + 3 + 5 + 6 + 10 + 15 + 25 + 30 + 50 + 75 + 150 = 372
     \]

### Step 2: Other Mathematical Operations

1. **Square and Square Root:**
   - The square of 150 is:
     \[
     150^2 = 22500
     \]
   - The square root of 150 is approximately:
     \[
     \sqrt{150} \approx 12.247
     \]

2. **Multiples:**
   - Some multiples of 150 are:
     \[
     150 \times 1 = 150, \quad 150 \times 2 = 300, \quad 150 \times 3 = 450, \quad \ldots
     \]

3. **Percentage:**
   - 10% of 150 is:
     \[
     0.10 \times 150 = 15
     \]

### Step 3: Conclusion

Since the problem "Sample math problem 150" does not specify a particular question or operation, I have explored several mathematical properties and operations involving the number 150. If there is a specific question or operation you intended, please provide more details.

**Final Answer:**
- Prime factorization of 150: \(2 \times 3 \times 5^2\)
- Divisors of 150: \(1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 10, 15, 25, 30, 50, 75, 150\)
- Sum of divisors: 372
- Square of 150: 22500
- Square root of 150: \(\approx 12.247\)
- 10% of 150: 15
