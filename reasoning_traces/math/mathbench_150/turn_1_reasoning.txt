==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 150," let's first clarify what the problem is asking. Since the problem statement is not fully clear, I will assume that "Sample math problem 150" refers to a problem involving the number 150. Let's consider a few possibilities:

1. **Factorization of 150:**
   - To factor 150, we start by finding its prime factors.
   - 150 is an even number, so it is divisible by 2. Dividing 150 by 2 gives us 75.
   - Next, we factor 75. Since 75 ends in 5, it is divisible by 5. Dividing 75 by 5 gives us 15.
   - Finally, we factor 15. Since 15 ends in 5, it is divisible by 5. Dividing 15 by 5 gives us 3.
   - 3 is a prime number.
   - Therefore, the prime factorization of 150 is \(2 \times 5^2 \times 3\).

2. **Finding the divisors of 150:**
   - Using the prime factorization \(2 \times 5^2 \times 3\), we can find the divisors.
   - The total number of divisors is given by \((1+1)(2+1)(1+1) = 2 \times 3 \times 2 = 12\).
   - The divisors are: 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 10, 15, 25, 30, 50, 75, and 150.

3. **Checking if 150 is a perfect square:**
   - A perfect square has an even power for each prime factor.
   - In the factorization \(2^1 \times 5^2 \times 3^1\), the powers of 2 and 3 are not even.
   - Therefore, 150 is not a perfect square.

4. **Calculating the sum of the digits of 150:**
   - The digits of 150 are 1, 5, and 0.
   - The sum of these digits is \(1 + 5 + 0 = 6\).

5. **Checking if 150 is a multiple of 9:**
   - A number is a multiple of 9 if the sum of its digits is a multiple of 9.
   - The sum of the digits of 150 is 6, which is not a multiple of 9.
   - Therefore, 150 is not a multiple of 9.

Given these analyses, the problem might be asking for any of these aspects of the number 150. If you have a specific question or operation in mind involving 150, please let me know!

**Final Answer:**
- Prime factorization of 150: \(2 \times 5^2 \times 3\)
- Divisors of 150: 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 10, 15, 25, 30, 50, 75, 150
- 150 is not a perfect square.
- Sum of the digits of 150: 6
- 150 is not a multiple of 9.
