==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 150," we first need to understand what the problem is asking. However, the phrase "Sample math problem 150" is not a complete math problem on its own. It seems like it might be a reference to a specific problem from a textbook or a set of problems, but without additional context or details, it's impossible to determine what the problem is about.

To proceed, let's assume that "Sample math problem 150" is a placeholder for a typical math problem. Since no specific details are provided, I'll create a hypothetical math problem and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Math Problem:**

Let's assume the problem is: "Find the sum of all integers from 1 to 150."

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   We need to find the sum of all integers from 1 to 150. This is a classic problem that can be solved using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series.

2. **Identify the Arithmetic Series:**
   The series is: 1, 2, 3, ..., 150.
   - First term (\(a_1\)) = 1
   - Last term (\(a_n\)) = 150
   - Number of terms (\(n\)) = 150

3. **Use the Formula for the Sum of an Arithmetic Series:**
   The formula for the sum \(S_n\) of the first \(n\) terms of an arithmetic series is:
   \[
   S_n = \frac{n}{2} \times (a_1 + a_n)
   \]

4. **Substitute the Known Values:**
   \[
   S_{150} = \frac{150}{2} \times (1 + 150)
   \]

5. **Calculate the Sum:**
   - Calculate the number of terms divided by 2:
     \[
     \frac{150}{2} = 75
     \]
   - Calculate the sum of the first and last terms:
     \[
     1 + 150 = 151
     \]
   - Multiply these results to find the sum:
     \[
     S_{150} = 75 \times 151
     \]

6. **Perform the Multiplication:**
   \[
   75 \times 151 = 75 \times (150 + 1) = 75 \times 150 + 75 \times 1
   \]
   - Calculate \(75 \times 150\):
     \[
     75 \times 150 = 75 \times (100 + 50) = 75 \times 100 + 75 \times 50
     \]
     \[
     75 \times 100 = 7500
     \]
     \[
     75 \times 50 = 3750
     \]
     \[
     75 \times 150 = 7500 + 3750 = 11250
     \]
   - Calculate \(75 \times 1\):
     \[
     75 \times 1 = 75
     \]
   - Add these results:
     \[
     S_{150} = 11250 + 75 = 11325
     \]

**Final Answer:**
The sum of all integers from 1 to 150 is 11,325.
