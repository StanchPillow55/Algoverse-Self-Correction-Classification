To solve the problem, we need to understand what "Sample math problem 150" refers to. Since the problem isn't specified, I'll assume it's a generic math problem involving the number 150. Let's create a problem involving 150 and solve it step by step.

**Problem:**
Find the prime factorization of 150 and determine the number of positive divisors of 150.

**Step 1: Prime Factorization of 150**

To find the prime factorization, we need to divide 150 by the smallest prime numbers until we are left with 1.

1. **Divide by 2:**  
   150 is even, so divide by 2.  
   \( 150 \div 2 = 75 \)  
   So, 2 is a prime factor.

2. **Divide by 3:**  
   75 is divisible by 3 (since the sum of its digits, 7 + 5 = 12, is divisible by 3).  
   \( 75 \div 3 = 25 \)  
   So, 3 is a prime factor.

3. **Divide by 5:**  
   25 ends in 5, so it is divisible by 5.  
   \( 25 \div 5 = 5 \)  
   So, 5 is a prime factor.

4. **Divide by 5 again:**  
   5 is a prime number, and \( 5 \div 5 = 1 \).

Thus, the prime factorization of 150 is \( 2 \times 3 \times 5^2 \).

**Step 2: Determine the Number of Positive Divisors**

To find the number of positive divisors, use the formula for the divisors based on prime factorization. If a number \( n \) has the prime factorization \( p_1^{a_1} \times p_2^{a_2} \times \cdots \times p_k^{a_k} \), then the number of divisors \( D(n) \) is given by:

\[ D(n) = (a_1 + 1)(a_2 + 1) \cdots (a_k + 1) \]

For 150, the prime factorization is \( 2^1 \times 3^1 \times 5^2 \).

- \( a_1 = 1 \) for the prime 2
- \( a_2 = 1 \) for the prime 3
- \( a_3 = 2 \) for the prime 5

Plug these into the formula:

\[ D(150) = (1 + 1)(1 + 1)(2 + 1) = 2 \times 2 \times 3 = 12 \]

**Final Answer:**

The prime factorization of 150 is \( 2 \times 3 \times 5^2 \), and the number of positive divisors of 150 is 12.
