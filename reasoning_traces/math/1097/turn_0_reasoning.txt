To find out how many people were inside the church after the ceremony, we need to calculate the total number of people transported by the buses and cars.

**Step 1: Calculate the number of people transported by the buses.**

We know that:
- There are 12 buses.
- Each bus carries 35 people.

To find the total number of people carried by the buses, we multiply the number of buses by the number of people each bus can carry:

\[
\text{Total people from buses} = \text{Number of buses} \times \text{People per bus}
\]
\[
\text{Total people from buses} = 12 \times 35
\]

Now, we perform the multiplication:

\[
12 \times 35 = 420
\]

So, the total number of people transported by the buses is **420**.

**Step 2: Calculate the number of people transported by the cars.**

Next, we know that:
- There are 20 private cars.
- Each car carries 3 people.

To find the total number of people carried by the cars, we multiply the number of cars by the number of people each car can carry:

\[
\text{Total people from cars} = \text{Number of cars} \times \text{People per car}
\]
\[
\text{Total people from cars} = 20 \times 3
\]

Now, we perform the multiplication:

\[
20 \times 3 = 60
\]

So, the total number of people transported by the cars is **60**.

**Step 3: Calculate the total number of people inside the church.**

Now, we add the total number of people from the buses and the cars to find the total number of people inside the church:

\[
\text{Total people inside the church} = \text{Total people from buses} + \text{Total people from cars}
\]
\[
\text{Total people inside the church} = 420 + 60
\]

Now, we perform the addition:

\[
420 + 60 = 480
\]

Thus, the total number of people inside the church is **480**.

**Final Answer:**
The total number of people inside the church is **480**.
