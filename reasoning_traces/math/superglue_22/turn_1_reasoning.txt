==================================================

To solve the problem effectively, I need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 22" entails. However, since the problem statement is not provided, I'll demonstrate how to approach a typical math reasoning problem step by step. 

Let's assume a sample problem for demonstration:

**Problem:**  
A farmer has a rectangular field that is 50 meters long and 30 meters wide. He wants to divide the field into two equal parts by building a fence parallel to the shorter side. What will be the length of the fence?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - The field is rectangular with dimensions 50 meters (length) and 30 meters (width).
   - The farmer wants to divide the field into two equal parts with a fence parallel to the shorter side (30 meters).

2. **Visualize the Problem:**
   - Imagine the rectangle with the longer side (50 meters) as the base.
   - The shorter side (30 meters) is the height.
   - The fence will run parallel to the 30-meter side, effectively splitting the field into two smaller rectangles.

3. **Determine the Dimensions of Each Part:**
   - Since the fence is parallel to the shorter side, it will run along the length of the field.
   - The field is divided into two equal parts, so each part will have half the area of the original field.

4. **Calculate the Area of the Field:**
   - Total area = Length × Width = 50 meters × 30 meters = 1500 square meters.

5. **Area of Each Part:**
   - Since the field is divided into two equal parts, each part will have an area of 1500 square meters / 2 = 750 square meters.

6. **Determine the Length of the Fence:**
   - The fence divides the field into two equal parts, so it must span the entire length of the field.
   - Therefore, the length of the fence is equal to the length of the field, which is 50 meters.

7. **Conclusion:**
   - The length of the fence required to divide the field into two equal parts is 50 meters.

**Final Answer:**
The length of the fence is 50 meters.

This step-by-step approach ensures that each part of the problem is addressed logically, leading to a clear and correct solution. If you have a specific "Sample reasoning question 22" in mind, please provide the details, and I can work through that specific problem.
