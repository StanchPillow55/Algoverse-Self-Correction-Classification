To solve the problem, I need more specific information about "Sample reasoning question 22." Since I don't have access to external databases or documents, I can't retrieve or view specific questions or content labeled as "Sample reasoning question 22." However, I can guide you through a general approach to solving a math reasoning problem.

Let's assume a typical math reasoning problem and work through it step by step:

**Example Problem:**

A train travels from Station A to Station B at a speed of 60 km/h and returns from Station B to Station A at a speed of 40 km/h. What is the average speed of the train for the entire journey?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - The train travels two legs: A to B and B to A.
   - We need to find the average speed for the entire journey.

2. **Define Variables:**
   - Let the distance between Station A and Station B be \( d \) km.

3. **Calculate Time for Each Leg:**
   - Time from A to B: \( \text{Time}_{AB} = \frac{d}{60} \) hours.
   - Time from B to A: \( \text{Time}_{BA} = \frac{d}{40} \) hours.

4. **Total Distance and Total Time:**
   - Total distance traveled = \( d + d = 2d \) km.
   - Total time taken = \( \frac{d}{60} + \frac{d}{40} \).

5. **Find a Common Denominator to Add Times:**
   - The common denominator of 60 and 40 is 120.
   - Convert times to have the same denominator:
     \[
     \frac{d}{60} = \frac{2d}{120}, \quad \frac{d}{40} = \frac{3d}{120}
     \]
   - Total time = \( \frac{2d}{120} + \frac{3d}{120} = \frac{5d}{120} = \frac{d}{24} \) hours.

6. **Calculate Average Speed:**
   - Average speed is defined as total distance divided by total time.
   - Average speed = \( \frac{2d}{\frac{d}{24}} = 2d \times \frac{24}{d} = 48 \) km/h.

7. **Conclusion:**
   - The average speed of the train for the entire journey is 48 km/h.

**Final Answer:**
The average speed of the train for the entire journey is 48 km/h.
