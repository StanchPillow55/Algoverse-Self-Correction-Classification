Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 423," we first need to understand what the problem entails. However, the problem statement "Sample math problem 423" is not specific enough for us to determine what mathematical operations or concepts are involved. Therefore, I will assume a hypothetical math problem and solve it step by step.

Let's assume the problem is as follows:

**Problem:** Calculate the sum of the first 423 positive integers.

To solve this problem, we can use the formula for the sum of the first \( n \) positive integers:

\[
S = \frac{n(n + 1)}{2}
\]

where \( S \) is the sum and \( n \) is the number of terms.

In this case, \( n = 423 \).

Substituting \( n = 423 \) into the formula, we get:

\[
S = \frac{423 \times (423 + 1)}{2}
\]

First, calculate \( 423 + 1 \):

\[
423 + 1 = 424
\]

Next, calculate the product \( 423 \times 424 \):

\[
423 \times 424 = 179352
\]

Now, divide the product by 2 to find the sum:

\[
S = \frac{179352}{2} = 89676
\]

Thus, the sum of the first 423 positive integers is 89,676.

**Final Answer:** The sum of the first 423 positive integers is 89,676.
