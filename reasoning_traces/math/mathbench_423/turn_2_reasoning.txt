Question ID: mathbench_423
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 423," we need to first understand what the problem is asking. However, the problem statement provided is incomplete as it only states "Sample math problem 423" without any specific details or question. Therefore, I will assume that this is a placeholder for a specific math problem, and I will create a hypothetical problem to solve.

Let's assume the problem is as follows:

**Problem:**  
Calculate the sum of the first 423 positive integers.

To solve this problem, we can use the formula for the sum of the first \( n \) positive integers, which is given by:

\[
S = \frac{n(n + 1)}{2}
\]

where \( S \) is the sum and \( n \) is the number of terms. In this case, \( n = 423 \).

**Step-by-step Solution:**

1. **Identify the formula:**  
   The formula for the sum of the first \( n \) positive integers is \( S = \frac{n(n + 1)}{2} \).

2. **Substitute the value of \( n \):**  
   Here, \( n = 423 \). Substitute this value into the formula:

   \[
   S = \frac{423(423 + 1)}{2}
   \]

3. **Calculate \( 423 + 1 \):**  
   \[
   423 + 1 = 424
   \]

4. **Calculate the product \( 423 \times 424 \):**  
   To find this product, we can use the standard multiplication method:

   \[
   423 \times 424 = 179352
   \]

5. **Divide the product by 2:**  
   \[
   S = \frac{179352}{2} = 89676
   \]

Thus, the sum of the first 423 positive integers is 89,676.

**Final Answer:**  
The sum of the first 423 positive integers is 89,676.
