==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample math problem 423" refers to. Since this is not a standard problem description, I'll assume it's a placeholder for a specific math problem. Without the actual problem statement, I'll create a hypothetical problem based on the number 423 and solve it.

Let's assume the problem is as follows:

**Problem:**
Calculate the sum of the digits of the number 423, then multiply the result by 3. What is the final result?

**Solution:**

Step 1: Identify the digits of the number 423.
- The number 423 consists of the digits 4, 2, and 3.

Step 2: Calculate the sum of these digits.
- Sum = 4 + 2 + 3

Step 3: Perform the addition.
- Sum = 4 + 2 = 6
- Sum = 6 + 3 = 9

Step 4: Multiply the sum by 3.
- Result = 9 * 3

Step 5: Perform the multiplication.
- Result = 27

**Final Answer:**
The final result is 27.

This solution assumes a hypothetical problem based on the number 423. If you have a specific problem in mind, please provide the details so I can solve it accurately.
