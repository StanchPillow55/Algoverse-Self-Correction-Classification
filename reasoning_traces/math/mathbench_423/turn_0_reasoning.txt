==================================================

It seems like there might be a misunderstanding or missing information in your request. "Sample math problem 423" doesn't provide specific details about the problem you're referring to. To help you effectively, I need more information or context about the math problem you're trying to solve.

However, I can guide you through a generic approach to solving math problems. Let's assume a typical math problem and work through it step by step:

### Example Problem:
**Problem:** Solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We are given the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).
   - Our goal is to solve for \( x \).

2. **Isolate the Variable:**
   - To solve for \( x \), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation.
   - Start by eliminating the constant term on the left side of the equation.

3. **Subtract 3 from Both Sides:**
   \[
   2x + 3 - 3 = 11 - 3
   \]
   - This simplifies to:
   \[
   2x = 8
   \]

4. **Divide Both Sides by 2:**
   \[
   \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{8}{2}
   \]
   - Simplifying gives:
   \[
   x = 4
   \]

5. **Verify the Solution:**
   - Substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies the equation:
   \[
   2(4) + 3 = 11
   \]
   - Simplifying the left side:
   \[
   8 + 3 = 11
   \]
   - Since both sides are equal, our solution is verified.

6. **State the Final Answer:**
   - The solution to the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \) is \( x = 4 \).
