==================================================

To solve a problem, I need to know the specific details or the content of the problem itself. Since "Sample reasoning question 59" does not provide any specific information or context, I cannot solve it directly. However, I can guide you on how to approach solving a typical reasoning or math problem by providing a general framework:

### General Framework for Solving Math Problems:

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - Read the problem carefully.
   - Identify what is being asked.
   - Determine what information is given and what needs to be found.

2. **Devise a Plan:**
   - Consider possible strategies to solve the problem, such as:
     - Drawing a diagram.
     - Creating a table.
     - Writing an equation.
     - Breaking the problem into smaller parts.
     - Looking for patterns.

3. **Carry Out the Plan:**
   - Execute the chosen strategy step by step.
   - Perform calculations carefully.
   - Keep track of units and ensure consistency.

4. **Check Your Work:**
   - Review each step to ensure accuracy.
   - Verify that the solution makes sense in the context of the problem.
   - Check calculations for errors.

5. **State the Final Answer:**
   - Clearly write down the final answer.
   - Include units if applicable.

### Example Problem and Solution:

**Problem:**
A car travels 150 miles in 3 hours. What is the average speed of the car in miles per hour?

**Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We need to find the average speed of the car.
   - We know the car travels 150 miles in 3 hours.

2. **Devise a Plan:**
   - Use the formula for average speed: 
     \[
     \text{Average Speed} = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Total Time}}
     \]

3. **Carry Out the Plan:**
   - Plug the given values into the formula:
     \[
     \text{Average Speed} = \frac{150 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ hours}} = 50 \text{ miles per hour}
     \]

4. **Check Your Work:**
   - Verify the calculation:
     - 150 divided by 3 equals 50.
   - The units are consistent (miles per hour).

5. **State the Final Answer:**
   - The average speed of the car is 50 miles per hour.

If you provide the specific details of "Sample reasoning question 59," I can apply this framework to solve it.
