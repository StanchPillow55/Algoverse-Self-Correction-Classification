==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 59" refers to. Since the problem statement is not provided, I'll demonstrate a general approach to solving a typical math problem by using a hypothetical example. Let's assume the problem is as follows:

**Problem:**  
A farmer has a rectangular field that is 100 meters long and 60 meters wide. He wants to divide the field into smaller rectangular plots, each with an area of 150 square meters. How many such plots can he create?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We have a rectangular field with dimensions 100 meters by 60 meters.
   - We need to divide this field into smaller plots, each with an area of 150 square meters.
   - We need to find out how many such plots can be created.

2. **Calculate the Total Area of the Field:**
   - The area of a rectangle is given by the formula:  
     \[
     \text{Area} = \text{Length} \times \text{Width}
     \]
   - For the field:  
     \[
     \text{Area of the field} = 100 \, \text{meters} \times 60 \, \text{meters} = 6000 \, \text{square meters}
     \]

3. **Determine the Number of Plots:**
   - Each plot has an area of 150 square meters.
   - To find the number of plots, divide the total area of the field by the area of one plot:  
     \[
     \text{Number of plots} = \frac{\text{Area of the field}}{\text{Area of one plot}} = \frac{6000 \, \text{square meters}}{150 \, \text{square meters}}
     \]

4. **Perform the Division:**
   - \[
     \frac{6000}{150} = 40
     \]

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The farmer can create 40 plots, each with an area of 150 square meters.

**Final Answer:**
The farmer can create 40 plots.
