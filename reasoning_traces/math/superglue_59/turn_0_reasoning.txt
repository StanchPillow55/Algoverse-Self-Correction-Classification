==================================================

It seems like there might be some confusion with the question you've provided. "Sample reasoning question 59" doesn't provide enough information for me to solve a specific math problem. However, I can guide you through a sample math problem and demonstrate how to solve it step by step. Let's create a sample problem:

**Sample Problem:**

A rectangle has a length that is 3 times its width. If the perimeter of the rectangle is 48 units, what are the dimensions of the rectangle?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We need to find the length and width of a rectangle.
   - The length (L) is 3 times the width (W).
   - The perimeter (P) of the rectangle is 48 units.

2. **Set Up the Equations:**
   - The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is \( P = 2L + 2W \).
   - We know \( L = 3W \).
   - Substitute \( L = 3W \) into the perimeter formula: 
     \[
     48 = 2(3W) + 2W
     \]

3. **Simplify the Equation:**
   - Distribute the 2 in the equation:
     \[
     48 = 6W + 2W
     \]
   - Combine like terms:
     \[
     48 = 8W
     \]

4. **Solve for W:**
   - Divide both sides by 8 to solve for W:
     \[
     W = \frac{48}{8} = 6
     \]

5. **Find the Length:**
   - Since \( L = 3W \), substitute W = 6 into the equation for L:
     \[
     L = 3 \times 6 = 18
     \]

6. **Verify the Solution:**
   - Check the perimeter with the found dimensions:
     \[
     P = 2L + 2W = 2(18) + 2(6) = 36 + 12 = 48
     \]
   - The calculated perimeter matches the given perimeter, confirming our solution is correct.

**Final Answer:**
The dimensions of the rectangle are a width of 6 units and a length of 18 units.
