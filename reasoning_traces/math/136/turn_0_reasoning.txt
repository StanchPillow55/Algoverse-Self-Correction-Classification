==================================================

To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the number of unicorns in the Scottish Highlands:**
   We know that there are a total of 27 unicorns in the world, and one third of them are in the Scottish Highlands. To find out how many unicorns are in the Scottish Highlands, we calculate:

   \[
   \text{Number of unicorns in the Scottish Highlands} = \frac{1}{3} \times 27
   \]

   Performing the calculation:

   \[
   \frac{1}{3} \times 27 = 9
   \]

   So, there are 9 unicorns in the Scottish Highlands.

2. **Determine the number of female unicorns in the Scottish Highlands:**
   We are told that two thirds of the Scottish unicorns are female. To find out how many of the 9 Scottish unicorns are female, we calculate:

   \[
   \text{Number of female Scottish unicorns} = \frac{2}{3} \times 9
   \]

   Performing the calculation:

   \[
   \frac{2}{3} \times 9 = 6
   \]

   Therefore, there are 6 female Scottish unicorns.

3. **Final Answer:**
   After going through the calculations step by step, we find that the number of female Scottish unicorns is:

   \[
   \boxed{6}
   \]
