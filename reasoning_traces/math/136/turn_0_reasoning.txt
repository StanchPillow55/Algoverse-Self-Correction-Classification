To solve this problem, we need to determine how many sticks of wax Loraine used in total for both large and small animal sculptures.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( L \) represent the number of large animals.
   - Let \( S \) represent the number of small animals.

2. **Understand the Relationships:**
   - Each large animal requires 4 sticks of wax.
   - Each small animal requires 2 sticks of wax.
   - Loraine made three times as many small animals as large animals, which gives us the equation:
     \[
     S = 3L
     \]
   - Loraine used 12 sticks of wax for small animals. Since each small animal uses 2 sticks, we can write:
     \[
     2S = 12
     \]

3. **Solve for \( S \):**
   - From the equation \( 2S = 12 \), divide both sides by 2 to find \( S \):
     \[
     S = \frac{12}{2} = 6
     \]

4. **Find \( L \) Using the Relationship Between \( S \) and \( L \):**
   - We know \( S = 3L \). Substitute \( S = 6 \) into this equation:
     \[
     6 = 3L
     \]
   - Solve for \( L \) by dividing both sides by 3:
     \[
     L = \frac{6}{3} = 2
     \]

5. **Calculate Total Sticks of Wax Used:**
   - Calculate the sticks of wax used for large animals:
     \[
     \text{Sticks for large animals} = 4L = 4 \times 2 = 8
     \]
   - We already know the sticks of wax used for small animals is 12 (given in the problem).

6. **Find the Total Sticks of Wax Used:**
   - Add the sticks of wax used for large and small animals:
     \[
     \text{Total sticks of wax} = 8 + 12 = 20
     \]

Therefore, Loraine used a total of 20 sticks of wax to make all the animals.

**Final Answer: 20 sticks of wax**
