To solve the problem, we need to determine how many large and small animals Loraine made and how many sticks of wax she used in total.

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( L \) be the number of large animals.
   - Let \( S \) be the number of small animals.

2. **Relationships Given:**
   - Large animals take 4 sticks of wax each.
   - Small animals take 2 sticks of wax each.
   - Loraine made three times as many small animals as large animals: 
     \[
     S = 3L
     \]
   - She used 12 sticks of wax for small animals.

3. **Calculate the Number of Small Animals:**
   - Since each small animal takes 2 sticks of wax, the total number of sticks used for small animals can be expressed as:
     \[
     2S = 12
     \]
   - To find \( S \), we solve for \( S \):
     \[
     S = \frac{12}{2} = 6
     \]

4. **Calculate the Number of Large Animals:**
   - Using the relationship \( S = 3L \):
     \[
     6 = 3L
     \]
   - To find \( L \), we solve for \( L \):
     \[
     L = \frac{6}{3} = 2
     \]

5. **Calculate the Total Sticks of Wax Used:**
   - Now we can calculate the total number of sticks of wax used for both large and small animals.
   - For large animals:
     \[
     \text{Sticks for large animals} = 4L = 4 \times 2 = 8
     \]
   - For small animals, we already know:
     \[
     \text{Sticks for small animals} = 12
     \]

6. **Total Sticks of Wax:**
   - Now we add the sticks used for large and small animals:
     \[
     \text{Total sticks} = \text{Sticks for large animals} + \text{Sticks for small animals} = 8 + 12 = 20
     \]

Thus, the total number of sticks of wax Loraine used to make all the animals is \( \boxed{20} \).
