Question ID: 88
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we first need to find out how many geckos Brandon sold the year before last year. Since it's given that he sold twice as many geckos the year before last year as he did last year, we multiply the number of geckos he sold last year by 2.

So, 86 geckos (last year's sales) * 2 = 172 geckos (the year before last year's sales).

Next, we add the number of geckos sold last year to the number sold the year before to find the total number of geckos sold in the last two years.

So, 86 geckos (last year's sales) + 172 geckos (the year before last year's sales) = 258 geckos.

Therefore, Brandon has sold 258 geckos in the last two years.
