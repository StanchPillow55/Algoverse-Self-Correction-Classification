==================================================

To solve this problem, we first need to find out how many geckos Brandon sold the year before last year. Since it's given that he sold twice as many geckos the year before last year as he did last year, we multiply the number of geckos he sold last year by 2.

So, 86 geckos * 2 = 172 geckos.

This means that Brandon sold 172 geckos the year before last year.

To find out the total number of geckos Brandon sold in the last two years, we add the number of geckos he sold last year to the number he sold the year before.

So, 86 geckos (last year) + 172 geckos (the year before) = 258 geckos.

Therefore, Brandon has sold 258 geckos in the last two years.
