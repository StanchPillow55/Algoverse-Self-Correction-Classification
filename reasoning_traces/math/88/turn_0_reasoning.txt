Question ID: 88
Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

Let's denote the number of copies that Harald sold as \( H \). According to the problem, Marilyn's record sold 10 times as many copies as Harald's. Therefore, we can express the number of copies Marilyn sold as \( 10H \).

The problem states that the total number of copies sold by both Marilyn and Harald is 88,000. We can set up the following equation to represent this situation:

\[
H + 10H = 88,000
\]

Now, let's simplify the left side of the equation:

\[
11H = 88,000
\]

Next, we need to solve for \( H \). To do this, we divide both sides of the equation by 11:

\[
H = \frac{88,000}{11}
\]

Now, we perform the division:

\[
H = 8,000
\]

Thus, Harald sold \( 8,000 \) copies of his record.

To verify, we can calculate how many copies Marilyn sold:

\[
10H = 10 \times 8,000 = 80,000
\]

Now, we can check the total number of copies sold:

\[
H + 10H = 8,000 + 80,000 = 88,000
\]

Since this matches the total given in the problem, our solution is confirmed.

Therefore, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{8000}
\]
