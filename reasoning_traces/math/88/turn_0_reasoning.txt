==================================================

To find out how many geckos Brandon sold in the last two years, we need to break down the problem step by step.

1. **Identify the number of geckos sold last year**: 
   According to the problem, Brandon sold 86 geckos last year.

2. **Determine the number of geckos sold the year before last**: 
   The problem states that he sold twice as many geckos the year before last. To find this number, we multiply the number of geckos sold last year by 2:
   \[
   \text{Geckos sold the year before last} = 2 \times 86
   \]
   Now, we perform the multiplication:
   \[
   2 \times 86 = 172
   \]
   So, Brandon sold 172 geckos the year before last.

3. **Calculate the total number of geckos sold over the last two years**: 
   To find the total, we add the number of geckos sold last year to the number sold the year before last:
   \[
   \text{Total geckos sold} = \text{Geckos sold last year} + \text{Geckos sold the year before last}
   \]
   Substituting the values we found:
   \[
   \text{Total geckos sold} = 86 + 172
   \]
   Now, we perform the addition:
   \[
   86 + 172 = 258
   \]

4. **Final answer**: 
   Therefore, the total number of geckos that Brandon has sold in the last two years is:
   \[
   \boxed{258}
   \]
