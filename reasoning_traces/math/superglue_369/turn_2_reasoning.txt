Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 369" entails. Since the problem statement is not specific, I'll assume it's a generic math problem that requires logical reasoning and problem-solving skills. Let's create a hypothetical problem and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**

A farmer has a rectangular field that is 120 meters long and 80 meters wide. He wants to divide the field into smaller rectangular plots, each with an area of 240 square meters. How many such plots can he create?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We have a rectangular field with dimensions 120 meters by 80 meters.
   - We need to divide this field into smaller plots, each with an area of 240 square meters.

2. **Calculate the Total Area of the Field:**
   - The area of the field is given by the formula for the area of a rectangle: 
     \[
     \text{Area of the field} = \text{length} \times \text{width} = 120 \, \text{m} \times 80 \, \text{m} = 9600 \, \text{square meters}
     \]

3. **Determine the Number of Plots:**
   - Each plot has an area of 240 square meters.
   - To find the number of plots, divide the total area of the field by the area of one plot:
     \[
     \text{Number of plots} = \frac{\text{Total area of the field}}{\text{Area of one plot}} = \frac{9600 \, \text{square meters}}{240 \, \text{square meters}}
     \]

4. **Perform the Division:**
   - Calculate the division:
     \[
     \frac{9600}{240} = 40
     \]

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The farmer can create 40 plots, each with an area of 240 square meters.

**Final Answer:**
The farmer can create 40 plots, each with an area of 240 square meters.
