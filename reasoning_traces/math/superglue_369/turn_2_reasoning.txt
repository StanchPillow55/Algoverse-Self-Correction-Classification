Question ID: superglue_369
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem effectively, I need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 369" refers to. However, since the problem statement is not provided, I will assume this is a placeholder for a typical math problem. Without specific details, I'll demonstrate how to approach a generic math problem step by step.

Let's assume "Sample reasoning question 369" is a typical algebra problem. Here's how I would approach solving it:

### Problem Statement (Hypothetical)
Solve for \( x \) in the equation: 
\[ 2x + 3 = 11 \]

### Step-by-Step Solution

1. **Understand the Equation**: 
   The equation given is \( 2x + 3 = 11 \). This is a linear equation in one variable, \( x \).

2. **Isolate the Variable**:
   To solve for \( x \), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We can do this by performing operations that will simplify the equation.

3. **Subtract 3 from Both Sides**:
   \[
   2x + 3 - 3 = 11 - 3
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   2x = 8
   \]

4. **Divide Both Sides by 2**:
   \[
   \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{8}{2}
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   x = 4
   \]

5. **Verify the Solution**:
   Substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation to verify:
   \[
   2(4) + 3 = 11
   \]
   \[
   8 + 3 = 11
   \]
   \[
   11 = 11
   \]
   The left-hand side equals the right-hand side, confirming that \( x = 4 \) is the correct solution.

### Final Answer
The solution to the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \) is \( x = 4 \).

If "Sample reasoning question 369" refers to a different type of problem, please provide additional details or context so I can assist you accurately.
