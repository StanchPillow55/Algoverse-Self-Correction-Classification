==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample reasoning question 369," we need to first clarify what the question is asking. However, since the question is not explicitly stated, I will assume that "Sample reasoning question 369" is a placeholder for a typical math problem. Let's create a hypothetical math problem to solve:

**Problem:**  
A rectangle has a length that is twice its width. If the perimeter of the rectangle is 48 units, find the dimensions of the rectangle.

**Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We have a rectangle with a length (L) and a width (W).
   - The length is twice the width: \( L = 2W \).
   - The perimeter of the rectangle is 48 units.

2. **Recall the Formula for Perimeter:**
   - The perimeter (P) of a rectangle is given by the formula:  
     \[ P = 2L + 2W \]

3. **Substitute the Known Values:**
   - We know \( P = 48 \) and \( L = 2W \).
   - Substitute \( L = 2W \) into the perimeter formula:  
     \[ 48 = 2(2W) + 2W \]

4. **Simplify the Equation:**
   - Simplify the expression:  
     \[ 48 = 4W + 2W \]
   - Combine like terms:  
     \[ 48 = 6W \]

5. **Solve for W:**
   - Divide both sides by 6 to solve for W:  
     \[ W = \frac{48}{6} = 8 \]

6. **Find the Length (L):**
   - Since \( L = 2W \), substitute \( W = 8 \) into the equation for L:  
     \[ L = 2 \times 8 = 16 \]

7. **Verify the Solution:**
   - Check the perimeter with the found dimensions:  
     \[ P = 2L + 2W = 2(16) + 2(8) = 32 + 16 = 48 \]
   - The calculated perimeter matches the given perimeter, confirming our solution is correct.

**Final Answer:**
The dimensions of the rectangle are a width of 8 units and a length of 16 units.
