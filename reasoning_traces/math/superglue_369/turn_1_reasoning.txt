==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 369" refers to. However, since no specific details or context about the problem are provided, I'll demonstrate a general approach to solving a typical math problem by creating a hypothetical example. Let's assume "Sample reasoning question 369" is a math problem involving algebra. Here's how we might approach it:

**Hypothetical Problem:**
Solve for \( x \) in the equation: \( 3x + 5 = 20 \).

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   We need to solve for \( x \) in the linear equation \( 3x + 5 = 20 \).

2. **Isolate the Variable:**
   To solve for \( x \), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We start by eliminating the constant term on the left side.

   \[
   3x + 5 = 20
   \]

   Subtract 5 from both sides to get:

   \[
   3x + 5 - 5 = 20 - 5
   \]

   Simplifying both sides gives:

   \[
   3x = 15
   \]

3. **Solve for \( x \):**
   Now, divide both sides by 3 to solve for \( x \).

   \[
   \frac{3x}{3} = \frac{15}{3}
   \]

   Simplifying both sides gives:

   \[
   x = 5
   \]

4. **Verify the Solution:**
   Substitute \( x = 5 \) back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies the equation.

   \[
   3(5) + 5 = 20
   \]

   Simplifying the left side:

   \[
   15 + 5 = 20
   \]

   \[
   20 = 20
   \]

   The left side equals the right side, confirming that our solution is correct.

**Final Answer:**
The solution to the equation \( 3x + 5 = 20 \) is \( x = 5 \).

This approach demonstrates a clear, step-by-step method for solving a linear equation. If "Sample reasoning question 369" refers to a different type of problem, please provide additional details or context so I can assist you more accurately.
