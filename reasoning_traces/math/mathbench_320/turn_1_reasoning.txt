==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 320," we need to first understand what the problem is asking. However, the problem statement "Sample math problem 320" is not specific enough to determine the exact nature of the problem. Since there is no specific mathematical question or context provided, I will assume that "Sample math problem 320" is a placeholder for a typical math problem that might involve basic arithmetic, algebra, geometry, or another area of mathematics.

Without a specific problem to solve, I will create a hypothetical math problem that could be labeled as "Sample math problem 320" and solve it step-by-step. Let's assume the problem is as follows:

**Hypothetical Problem:**
Solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 2x + 5 = 15 \).

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Equation:**
   The equation given is \( 2x + 5 = 15 \). This is a linear equation in one variable, \( x \).

2. **Isolate the Variable:**
   To solve for \( x \), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We can do this by performing operations that will simplify the equation.

3. **Subtract 5 from Both Sides:**
   To eliminate the constant term on the left side, subtract 5 from both sides of the equation:
   \[
   2x + 5 - 5 = 15 - 5
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   2x = 10
   \]

4. **Divide Both Sides by 2:**
   To solve for \( x \), divide both sides of the equation by 2:
   \[
   \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{10}{2}
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   x = 5
   \]

5. **Verify the Solution:**
   Substitute \( x = 5 \) back into the original equation to verify the solution:
   \[
   2(5) + 5 = 15
   \]
   Simplifying the left side gives:
   \[
   10 + 5 = 15
   \]
   Since both sides of the equation are equal, the solution \( x = 5 \) is verified.

**Final Answer:**
The solution to the equation \( 2x + 5 = 15 \) is \( x = 5 \).

Since the original problem statement "Sample math problem 320" was not specific, I created and solved a hypothetical linear equation problem. If you have a specific math problem in mind, please provide the details, and I will be happy to solve it for you.
