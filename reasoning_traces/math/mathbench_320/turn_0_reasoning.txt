==================================================

It seems like you've referenced "Sample math problem 320," but without specific details about the problem, I can't provide a solution. However, I can guide you through a generic approach to solving math problems. If you have a specific problem in mind, please provide the details, and I'll be happy to help.

Here's a general approach to solving math problems:

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - Read the problem carefully.
   - Identify what is being asked.
   - Determine what information is given and what is needed.

2. **Devise a Plan:**
   - Think about the strategies that can be used to solve the problem (e.g., algebraic manipulation, drawing a diagram, logical reasoning, etc.).
   - Consider similar problems you have solved before.

3. **Carry Out the Plan:**
   - Execute the steps you have planned.
   - Perform calculations carefully.
   - Keep track of units and ensure consistency.

4. **Review/Check Your Work:**
   - Verify each step of your solution.
   - Check if the answer makes sense in the context of the problem.
   - Review calculations for accuracy.

5. **State the Final Answer:**
