==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample math problem 320" refers to. Since there is no specific problem statement given, I will assume this is a placeholder for a typical math problem. Let's create a problem based on the number 320 and solve it.

**Problem:**
Calculate the sum of all positive divisors of 320.

**Solution:**

1. **Find the prime factorization of 320:**

   To find the prime factorization, we start dividing by the smallest prime number, which is 2, and continue dividing until we reach 1.

   \[
   320 \div 2 = 160
   \]
   \[
   160 \div 2 = 80
   \]
   \[
   80 \div 2 = 40
   \]
   \[
   40 \div 2 = 20
   \]
   \[
   20 \div 2 = 10
   \]
   \[
   10 \div 2 = 5
   \]

   Now, 5 is a prime number, so we stop here. The prime factorization of 320 is:
   \[
   320 = 2^6 \times 5^1
   \]

2. **Use the formula for the sum of divisors:**

   The sum of the divisors of a number \( n = p_1^{k_1} \times p_2^{k_2} \times \ldots \times p_m^{k_m} \) is given by:
   \[
   \sigma(n) = (1 + p_1 + p_1^2 + \ldots + p_1^{k_1})(1 + p_2 + p_2^2 + \ldots + p_2^{k_2}) \ldots (1 + p_m + p_m^2 + \ldots + p_m^{k_m})
   \]

   For \( 320 = 2^6 \times 5^1 \), the sum of the divisors is:
   \[
   \sigma(320) = (1 + 2 + 2^2 + 2^3 + 2^4 + 2^5 + 2^6)(1 + 5)
   \]

3. **Calculate each part:**

   - Calculate the sum of powers of 2:
     \[
     1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + 16 + 32 + 64 = 127
     \]

   - Calculate the sum for the power of 5:
     \[
     1 + 5 = 6
     \]

4. **Multiply the results:**

   \[
   \sigma(320) = 127 \times 6 = 762
   \]

Therefore, the sum of all positive divisors of 320 is \( \boxed{762} \).
