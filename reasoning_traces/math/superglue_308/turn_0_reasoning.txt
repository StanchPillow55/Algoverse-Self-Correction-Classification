==================================================

To solve a math problem effectively, it's important to follow a structured approach. However, since "Sample reasoning question 308" is not a specific problem statement, I'll guide you through a generic process of solving a math problem. If you have a specific problem in mind, please provide the details, and I'll be happy to help with that.

Here's a general approach to solving a math problem:

### Step 1: Understand the Problem
- **Read the problem carefully**: Make sure you understand what is being asked. Identify the knowns and unknowns.
- **Identify the type of problem**: Is it algebraic, geometric, calculus-based, etc.?

### Step 2: Devise a Plan
- **Choose a strategy**: Depending on the problem type, decide whether to use algebraic manipulation, draw a diagram, use a formula, etc.
- **Consider similar problems**: Think about similar problems you have solved before and how you approached them.

### Step 3: Carry Out the Plan
- **Execute your strategy**: Perform calculations, draw diagrams, or apply formulas as needed.
- **Show all work**: Write down each step clearly to avoid mistakes and make it easier to review.

### Step 4: Review/Check Your Work
- **Verify your solution**: Check if your solution makes sense in the context of the problem.
- **Recalculate if necessary**: If something seems off, go through your calculations again.

### Example Problem
Let's apply this process to a simple algebra problem:

**Problem**: Solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).

#### Step 1: Understand the Problem
- We need to find the value of \( x \) that satisfies the equation.

#### Step 2: Devise a Plan
- We will isolate \( x \) by performing algebraic operations.

#### Step 3: Carry Out the Plan
1. Start with the equation: 
   \[
   2x + 3 = 11
   \]
2. Subtract 3 from both sides to isolate the term with \( x \):
   \[
   2x + 3 - 3 = 11 - 3
   \]
   \[
   2x = 8
   \]
3. Divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( x \):
   \[
   \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{8}{2}
   \]
   \[
   x = 4
   \]

#### Step 4: Review/Check Your Work
- Substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation to verify:
  \[
  2(4) + 3 = 8 + 3 = 11
  \]
- The left side equals the right side, confirming our solution is correct.

### Final Answer
The solution to the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \) is \( x = 4 \).

If you have a specific problem or question in mind, please provide the details, and I can work through that particular problem for you.
