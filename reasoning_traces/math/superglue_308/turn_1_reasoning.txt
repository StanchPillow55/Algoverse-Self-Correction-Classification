==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 308" entails. Since the question is not explicitly provided, I'll demonstrate a general approach to solving a math problem by assuming a typical problem structure. Let's assume the problem involves solving a quadratic equation, as this is a common type of math problem.

### Problem:
Solve the quadratic equation: \( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \).

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Identify the coefficients**: 
   - Let's assume the quadratic equation is \( 2x^2 + 3x - 5 = 0 \).
   - Here, \( a = 2 \), \( b = 3 \), and \( c = -5 \).

2. **Use the quadratic formula**:
   The quadratic formula to find the roots of \( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \) is:
   \[
   x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
   \]

3. **Calculate the discriminant**:
   The discriminant (\( \Delta \)) is given by \( b^2 - 4ac \).
   \[
   \Delta = 3^2 - 4 \times 2 \times (-5) = 9 + 40 = 49
   \]

4. **Determine the nature of the roots**:
   Since the discriminant is positive (\( \Delta = 49 \)), the equation has two distinct real roots.

5. **Calculate the roots using the quadratic formula**:
   \[
   x = \frac{-3 \pm \sqrt{49}}{2 \times 2}
   \]
   \[
   x = \frac{-3 \pm 7}{4}
   \]

6. **Find the two solutions**:
   - First root:
     \[
     x_1 = \frac{-3 + 7}{4} = \frac{4}{4} = 1
     \]
   - Second root:
     \[
     x_2 = \frac{-3 - 7}{4} = \frac{-10}{4} = -2.5
     \]

### Final Answer:
The solutions to the quadratic equation \( 2x^2 + 3x - 5 = 0 \) are \( x = 1 \) and \( x = -2.5 \).

This approach demonstrates a complete solution to a quadratic equation problem, showing all calculations and reasoning. If "Sample reasoning question 308" refers to a different problem, please provide more details for a specific solution.
