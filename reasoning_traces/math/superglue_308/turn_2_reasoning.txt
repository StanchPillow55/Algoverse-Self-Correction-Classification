==================================================

To solve the problem, we first need to understand what "Sample reasoning question 308" entails. Since the problem statement is not provided, I'll demonstrate how to approach a generic math problem step by step. Let's assume a sample math problem for demonstration purposes:

**Problem:** Solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).

**Step 1: Understand the Problem**

We need to find the value of \( x \) that makes the equation true. The equation is linear, which means it will have one solution.

**Step 2: Isolate the Variable**

To solve for \( x \), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We start with:

\[ 2x + 3 = 11 \]

Subtract 3 from both sides to get rid of the constant term on the left side:

\[ 2x + 3 - 3 = 11 - 3 \]

This simplifies to:

\[ 2x = 8 \]

**Step 3: Solve for \( x \)**

Now, divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( x \):

\[ \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{8}{2} \]

This simplifies to:

\[ x = 4 \]

**Step 4: Verify the Solution**

To ensure our solution is correct, substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation:

\[ 2(4) + 3 = 11 \]

Calculate the left side:

\[ 8 + 3 = 11 \]

Since both sides of the equation are equal, our solution is verified.

**Final Answer:**

The solution to the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \) is \( x = 4 \).

This step-by-step approach can be applied to a wide range of math problems, ensuring clarity and accuracy in finding the solution. If you have a specific problem or need further assistance, please provide additional details.
