==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what is being asked. However, the question provided is "Sample reasoning question 308," which does not contain any specific mathematical problem or details to work through. 

Since there is no explicit problem to solve, let's consider a hypothetical scenario where we might be asked to solve a typical math problem. I will create a sample math problem and solve it step by step.

**Sample Problem:**

Calculate the sum of all even numbers between 1 and 100.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Identify the Even Numbers:**
   - Even numbers are integers divisible by 2.
   - Between 1 and 100, the even numbers start from 2 and end at 100.

2. **List the Even Numbers:**
   - The sequence of even numbers between 1 and 100 is: 2, 4, 6, ..., 100.

3. **Determine the Number of Terms:**
   - This sequence is an arithmetic sequence where the first term \( a_1 = 2 \) and the last term \( a_n = 100 \), with a common difference \( d = 2 \).
   - The formula for the \( n \)-th term of an arithmetic sequence is:
     \[
     a_n = a_1 + (n-1) \cdot d
     \]
   - Plugging in the values to find \( n \):
     \[
     100 = 2 + (n-1) \cdot 2
     \]
     \[
     100 = 2 + 2n - 2
     \]
     \[
     100 = 2n
     \]
     \[
     n = 50
     \]
   - There are 50 even numbers between 1 and 100.

4. **Calculate the Sum of the Sequence:**
   - The sum \( S_n \) of the first \( n \) terms of an arithmetic sequence is given by:
     \[
     S_n = \frac{n}{2} \cdot (a_1 + a_n)
     \]
   - Substituting the known values:
     \[
     S_{50} = \frac{50}{2} \cdot (2 + 100)
     \]
     \[
     S_{50} = 25 \cdot 102
     \]
     \[
     S_{50} = 2550
     \]

**Final Answer:**

The sum of all even numbers between 1 and 100 is 2550.
