==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 248" entails. Since the problem statement is not explicitly provided, I'll assume it's a hypothetical math problem that requires logical reasoning and step-by-step calculations. Let's create a sample problem and solve it.

**Sample Problem:**

A company produces two types of widgets: Type A and Type B. Each Type A widget requires 2 hours of labor and 3 units of raw material. Each Type B widget requires 1 hour of labor and 4 units of raw material. The company has a maximum of 100 hours of labor and 120 units of raw material available per week. The profit from each Type A widget is $40, and the profit from each Type B widget is $30. How many of each type of widget should the company produce to maximize profit?

**Solution:**

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( x \) be the number of Type A widgets produced.
   - Let \( y \) be the number of Type B widgets produced.

2. **Set Up Constraints:**
   - Labor constraint: \( 2x + y \leq 100 \)
   - Raw material constraint: \( 3x + 4y \leq 120 \)
   - Non-negativity constraints: \( x \geq 0 \), \( y \geq 0 \)

3. **Objective Function:**
   - Maximize profit: \( P = 40x + 30y \)

4. **Graphical Solution Method:**
   - Plot the constraints on a graph:
     - For \( 2x + y = 100 \), the intercepts are \( (50, 0) \) and \( (0, 100) \).
     - For \( 3x + 4y = 120 \), the intercepts are \( (40, 0) \) and \( (0, 30) \).

5. **Identify Feasible Region:**
   - The feasible region is the area on the graph where all constraints overlap, including the axes.

6. **Find Corner Points:**
   - Solve the system of equations to find intersection points:
     - \( 2x + y = 100 \)
     - \( 3x + 4y = 120 \)

   Solving these simultaneously:
   - Multiply the first equation by 4: \( 8x + 4y = 400 \)
   - Subtract the second equation: \( 8x + 4y - 3x - 4y = 400 - 120 \)
   - \( 5x = 280 \)
   - \( x = 56 \)

   Substitute \( x = 56 \) into \( 2x + y = 100 \):
   - \( 2(56) + y = 100 \)
   - \( 112 + y = 100 \)
   - \( y = -12 \) (not feasible as \( y \geq 0 \))

   Check other corner points from intercepts:
   - \( (0, 0) \), \( (50, 0) \), \( (0, 30) \)

7. **Evaluate Objective Function at Corner Points:**
   - \( P(0, 0) = 40(0) + 30(0) = 0 \)
   - \( P(50, 0) = 40(50) + 30(0) = 2000 \)
   - \( P(0, 30) = 40(0) + 30(30) = 900 \)

8. **Determine Maximum Profit:**
   - The maximum profit is $2000 at the point \( (50, 0) \).

**Final Answer:**
The company should produce 50 Type A widgets and 0 Type B widgets to maximize profit, resulting in a maximum profit of $2000.
