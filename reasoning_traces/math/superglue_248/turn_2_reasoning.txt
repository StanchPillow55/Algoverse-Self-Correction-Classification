==================================================

To solve a problem, I need to have a clear understanding of what the problem is asking. However, the question you've provided, "Sample reasoning question 248," doesn't include any specific details or context about the problem itself. Therefore, I will create a sample math problem and solve it step by step, showing all calculations and reasoning.

**Sample Problem:**

A farmer has a rectangular field that is 120 meters long and 80 meters wide. He wants to divide the field into smaller, equal-sized square plots. What is the largest possible side length of each square plot?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We have a rectangular field with dimensions 120 meters by 80 meters.
   - We want to divide this field into square plots of equal size.
   - We need to find the largest possible side length for these square plots.

2. **Identify the Mathematical Concept:**
   - The problem requires finding the largest square that can fit into both the length and the width of the rectangle without leaving any remainder.
   - This is a classic problem of finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the two numbers, 120 and 80.

3. **Calculate the GCD:**
   - Use the Euclidean algorithm to find the GCD of 120 and 80.
   - Start with the larger number, 120, and divide it by the smaller number, 80.
     \[
     120 \div 80 = 1 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 40
     \]
   - Now, take 80 and divide it by the remainder, 40.
     \[
     80 \div 40 = 2 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 0
     \]
   - Since the remainder is now 0, the divisor at this step, 40, is the GCD.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The largest possible side length of each square plot is 40 meters.

5. **Verify:**
   - Check that 40 meters can divide both the length and width of the field without leaving a remainder:
     \[
     120 \div 40 = 3 \quad (\text{exact})
     \]
     \[
     80 \div 40 = 2 \quad (\text{exact})
     \]
   - Both divisions result in whole numbers, confirming that 40 meters is indeed the largest possible side length for the square plots.

**Final Answer:**
The largest possible side length of each square plot is 40 meters.
