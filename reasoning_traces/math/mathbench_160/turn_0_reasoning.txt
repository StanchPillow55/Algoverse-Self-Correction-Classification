==================================================

It seems like the question "Sample math problem 160" is not specific enough for me to provide a detailed solution. However, I can guide you through a generic approach to solving math problems. If you have a specific problem or topic in mind, please provide more details. For now, I'll outline a general problem-solving strategy:

### General Problem-Solving Strategy:

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - Read the problem carefully.
   - Identify what is being asked.
   - Determine what information is given and what is missing.

2. **Devise a Plan:**
   - Consider possible strategies to solve the problem. This might include:
     - Drawing a diagram.
     - Creating a table.
     - Writing an equation.
     - Breaking the problem into smaller parts.
     - Looking for patterns.

3. **Carry Out the Plan:**
   - Execute the chosen strategy step by step.
   - Perform calculations carefully.
   - Keep track of units and ensure consistency.

4. **Check Your Work:**
   - Review each step to ensure accuracy.
   - Verify that the solution makes sense in the context of the problem.
   - Check calculations for errors.

5. **State the Final Answer:**
   - Clearly write down the answer.
   - Include units if applicable.

### Example Problem:

Let's apply this strategy to a sample problem:

**Problem:**
A rectangle has a length that is twice its width. If the perimeter of the rectangle is 48 units, find the dimensions of the rectangle.

**Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We need to find the length and width of the rectangle.
   - Given: Perimeter = 48 units, Length = 2 Ã— Width.

2. **Devise a Plan:**
   - Use the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle: \( P = 2 \times (\text{Length} + \text{Width}) \).
   - Substitute the given relationship between length and width into the formula.

3. **Carry Out the Plan:**
   - Let \( W \) be the width of the rectangle.
   - Then the length \( L = 2W \).
   - Substitute into the perimeter formula: 
     \[
     48 = 2 \times (2W + W)
     \]
   - Simplify and solve for \( W \):
     \[
     48 = 2 \times 3W
     \]
     \[
     48 = 6W
     \]
     \[
     W = \frac{48}{6} = 8
     \]
   - Now find the length:
     \[
     L = 2W = 2 \times 8 = 16
     \]

4. **Check Your Work:**
   - Verify the perimeter with the found dimensions:
     \[
     P = 2 \times (16 + 8) = 2 \times 24 = 48
     \]
   - The calculations are consistent with the given perimeter.

5. **State the Final Answer:**
   - The width of the rectangle is 8 units, and the length is 16 units.
