Question ID: mathbench_160
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we first need to understand what "Sample math problem 160" refers to. Since there is no specific problem statement provided, I'll assume a generic math problem that involves basic arithmetic or algebra, as the number "160" might suggest a problem related to this number.

Let's assume the problem is as follows:

**Problem:** If 160 is divided by a number, the result is 8. What is the number?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We are given that dividing 160 by a certain number yields a result of 8.
   - We need to find this unknown number.

2. **Set Up the Equation:**
   - Let the unknown number be \( x \).
   - According to the problem, dividing 160 by \( x \) gives 8. This can be written as an equation:
     \[
     \frac{160}{x} = 8
     \]

3. **Solve for \( x \):**
   - To find \( x \), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We can do this by multiplying both sides of the equation by \( x \) to eliminate the fraction:
     \[
     160 = 8x
     \]
   - Next, divide both sides by 8 to solve for \( x \):
     \[
     x = \frac{160}{8}
     \]

4. **Calculate the Value:**
   - Perform the division:
     \[
     x = 20
     \]

5. **Verify the Solution:**
   - To ensure our solution is correct, we can substitute \( x = 20 \) back into the original condition:
     \[
     \frac{160}{20} = 8
     \]
   - The left side simplifies to 8, which matches the right side, confirming our solution is correct.

6. **State the Final Answer:**
   - The number we are looking for is \( \boxed{20} \).

This completes the solution to the assumed problem. If "Sample math problem 160" refers to a different problem, please provide the specific details or context, and I can solve that problem accordingly.
