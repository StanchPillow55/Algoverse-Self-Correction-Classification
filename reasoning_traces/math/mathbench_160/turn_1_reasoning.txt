==================================================

To solve "Sample math problem 160," we need to first understand what the problem is asking. However, the problem statement is incomplete as it only states "Sample math problem 160" without providing any specific details or context. Therefore, I will create a hypothetical math problem based on the number 160 and solve it step-by-step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**
"Find the prime factorization of 160 and use it to determine the number of divisors of 160."

**Step 1: Prime Factorization of 160**

To find the prime factorization of 160, we start by dividing it by the smallest prime number, which is 2, and continue dividing by 2 until we can no longer do so:

1. \( 160 \div 2 = 80 \)
2. \( 80 \div 2 = 40 \)
3. \( 40 \div 2 = 20 \)
4. \( 20 \div 2 = 10 \)
5. \( 10 \div 2 = 5 \)

Now, 5 is a prime number, and we cannot divide it by 2 anymore. So, we divide by 5:

6. \( 5 \div 5 = 1 \)

Thus, the prime factorization of 160 is \( 2^5 \times 5^1 \).

**Step 2: Determine the Number of Divisors**

To find the number of divisors of a number given its prime factorization, we use the formula:

\[
\text{If } n = p_1^{a_1} \times p_2^{a_2} \times \ldots \times p_k^{a_k}, \text{ then the number of divisors } D(n) = (a_1 + 1)(a_2 + 1) \ldots (a_k + 1)
\]

For 160, the prime factorization is \( 2^5 \times 5^1 \). Therefore, the number of divisors is:

\[
D(160) = (5 + 1)(1 + 1) = 6 \times 2 = 12
\]

**Final Answer:**

The prime factorization of 160 is \( 2^5 \times 5^1 \), and the number of divisors of 160 is 12.
