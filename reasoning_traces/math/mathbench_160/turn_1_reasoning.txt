Question ID: mathbench_160
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample math problem 160" refers to. Since the problem is not explicitly stated, I'll assume it's a placeholder for a typical math problem. Let's create a hypothetical math problem and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**

"Calculate the sum of the first 160 positive integers."

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   We need to find the sum of the first 160 positive integers. The sequence of the first 160 positive integers is: 1, 2, 3, ..., 160.

2. **Identify the Formula:**
   The sum of the first \( n \) positive integers can be calculated using the formula:
   \[
   S_n = \frac{n(n + 1)}{2}
   \]
   where \( n \) is the number of terms.

3. **Substitute the Values:**
   Here, \( n = 160 \). Substitute 160 into the formula:
   \[
   S_{160} = \frac{160(160 + 1)}{2}
   \]

4. **Perform the Calculations:**
   - Calculate \( 160 + 1 \):
     \[
     160 + 1 = 161
     \]
   - Multiply 160 by 161:
     \[
     160 \times 161 = 25760
     \]
   - Divide the product by 2:
     \[
     \frac{25760}{2} = 12880
     \]

5. **Conclusion:**
   The sum of the first 160 positive integers is 12,880.

**Final Answer:**

The sum of the first 160 positive integers is 12,880.
