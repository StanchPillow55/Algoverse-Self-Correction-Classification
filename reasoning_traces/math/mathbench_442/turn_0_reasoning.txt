==================================================

To solve the problem, I need more information about "Sample math problem 442." Since the problem statement is not provided, I'll guide you through a general approach to solving math problems step by step. If you have a specific problem, please provide the details, and I can assist you further.

### General Approach to Solving Math Problems

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - Read the problem carefully.
   - Identify what is given and what needs to be found.
   - Determine the type of problem (e.g., algebra, geometry, calculus).

2. **Devise a Plan:**
   - Think about the methods or formulas that might be applicable.
   - Consider drawing a diagram if the problem involves geometry.
   - Break the problem into smaller, manageable parts if possible.

3. **Carry Out the Plan:**
   - Apply the chosen methods or formulas.
   - Perform calculations carefully, showing all steps.
   - Keep track of units and ensure consistency.

4. **Check Your Work:**
   - Review each step to ensure there are no errors.
   - Verify that the solution makes sense in the context of the problem.
   - Check if there is another way to solve the problem to confirm the answer.

5. **State the Final Answer:**
   - Clearly write down the final answer.
   - Include units if applicable.

### Example Problem

Let's solve a simple algebra problem as an example:

**Problem:** Solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).

**Step 1: Understand the Problem**
- We need to find the value of \( x \) that satisfies the equation.

**Step 2: Devise a Plan**
- We can isolate \( x \) by performing algebraic operations.

**Step 3: Carry Out the Plan**
1. Start with the equation: \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).
2. Subtract 3 from both sides to isolate the term with \( x \):
   \[
   2x + 3 - 3 = 11 - 3 \implies 2x = 8
   \]
3. Divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( x \):
   \[
   \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{8}{2} \implies x = 4
   \]

**Step 4: Check Your Work**
- Substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation to verify:
  \[
  2(4) + 3 = 8 + 3 = 11
  \]
- The left side equals the right side, confirming the solution is correct.

**Step 5: State the Final Answer**
- The solution to the equation is \( x = 4 \).
