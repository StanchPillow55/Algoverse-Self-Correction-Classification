==================================================

It seems like there might be a misunderstanding or missing information, as "Sample math problem 442" doesn't specify the actual math problem to be solved. To provide a complete solution, I need the details of the problem itself. 

However, I can guide you on how to approach solving a math problem step by step. If you provide the specific details of the problem, I can work through it with you. Here's a general approach to solving math problems:

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - Read the problem carefully.
   - Identify what is being asked.
   - Determine what information is given and what is unknown.

2. **Devise a Plan:**
   - Think about the strategies that can be used to solve the problem (e.g., algebraic manipulation, drawing a diagram, logical reasoning).
   - Consider similar problems you have solved before.

3. **Carry Out the Plan:**
   - Execute your chosen strategy step by step.
   - Perform calculations carefully.
   - Keep track of your work and ensure each step logically follows from the previous one.

4. **Review/Check Your Work:**
   - Verify each step of your solution.
   - Check if your solution answers the question.
   - Consider if there is another way to solve the problem or if the solution can be simplified.

5. **State the Final Answer:**
   - Clearly write down the final answer, ensuring it is in the correct form and units (if applicable).

Please provide the specific details of "Sample math problem 442," and I will be happy to work through it with you.
