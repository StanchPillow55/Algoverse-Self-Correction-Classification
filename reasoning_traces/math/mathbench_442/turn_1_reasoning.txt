==================================================

To solve the problem, I need more information about what "Sample math problem 442" entails. Since I don't have the specifics of this problem, I'll demonstrate how to approach a generic math problem by creating an example and solving it step by step.

Let's assume "Sample math problem 442" is a problem involving solving a quadratic equation. Here's a sample problem:

**Problem:**
Solve the quadratic equation \(2x^2 - 4x - 6 = 0\).

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Identify the coefficients:**
   The given quadratic equation is in the standard form \(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\).
   Here, \(a = 2\), \(b = -4\), and \(c = -6\).

2. **Calculate the discriminant:**
   The discriminant \(\Delta\) of a quadratic equation \(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\) is given by:
   \[
   \Delta = b^2 - 4ac
   \]
   Substituting the values, we get:
   \[
   \Delta = (-4)^2 - 4 \times 2 \times (-6) = 16 + 48 = 64
   \]

3. **Determine the nature of the roots:**
   Since the discriminant \(\Delta = 64\) is greater than zero, the quadratic equation has two distinct real roots.

4. **Use the quadratic formula to find the roots:**
   The quadratic formula is:
   \[
   x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{\Delta}}{2a}
   \]
   Substituting the values, we have:
   \[
   x = \frac{-(-4) \pm \sqrt{64}}{2 \times 2}
   \]
   Simplifying further:
   \[
   x = \frac{4 \pm 8}{4}
   \]

5. **Calculate the two roots:**
   - For the positive case (\(+\)):
     \[
     x = \frac{4 + 8}{4} = \frac{12}{4} = 3
     \]
   - For the negative case (\(-\)):
     \[
     x = \frac{4 - 8}{4} = \frac{-4}{4} = -1
     \]

6. **State the final answer:**
   The solutions to the quadratic equation \(2x^2 - 4x - 6 = 0\) are \(x = 3\) and \(x = -1\).

This is a complete solution to a sample quadratic equation problem. If you have a specific problem labeled "Sample math problem 442," please provide the details, and I can solve it accordingly.
