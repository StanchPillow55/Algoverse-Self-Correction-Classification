==================================================

To find out how many marbles Maddison has now, we will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of marbles in the boxes**:
   Maddison has 5 boxes, and each box contains 50 marbles. To find the total number of marbles in the boxes, we multiply the number of boxes by the number of marbles in each box:

   \[
   \text{Total marbles in boxes} = \text{Number of boxes} \times \text{Marbles per box}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total marbles in boxes} = 5 \times 50
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total marbles in boxes} = 250
   \]

2. **Add the marbles received from her friend**:
   Maddison receives an additional 20 marbles from her friend. To find the total number of marbles Maddison has now, we add the marbles she received to the total number of marbles she already has:

   \[
   \text{Total marbles now} = \text{Total marbles in boxes} + \text{Marbles received from friend}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total marbles now} = 250 + 20
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total marbles now} = 270
   \]

3. **Final answer**:
   Therefore, the total number of marbles Maddison has now is:

   \[
   \boxed{270}
   \]
