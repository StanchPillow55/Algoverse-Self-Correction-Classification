Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to determine how many times Jack's current number of apples can fit into Jill's basket.

1. **Determine the capacity of Jack's basket:**
   Jack's basket is full when it has 12 apples, but currently, it has space for 4 more apples. This means that Jack currently has:
   \[
   12 - 4 = 8 \text{ apples}
   \]

2. **Determine the capacity of Jill's basket:**
   According to the problem, Jill's basket can hold twice as much as Jack's basket when both are full. Since Jack's basket can hold 12 apples when full, Jill's basket can hold:
   \[
   2 \times 12 = 24 \text{ apples}
   \]

3. **Calculate how many times Jack's current number of apples fits into Jill's basket:**
   We need to find out how many times Jack's current number of apples (which is 8) can fit into Jill's basket (which can hold 24 apples). We do this by dividing the capacity of Jill's basket by the number of apples Jack currently has:
   \[
   \frac{24}{8} = 3
   \]

Thus, Jack's current number of apples can fit into Jill's basket **3 times**.

4. **Final Answer:**
   The final answer is:
   \[
   \boxed{3}
   \]
