==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine how many times Jack's current number of apples can fit into Jill's basket.

1. **Determine Jack's Basket Capacity:**
   - Jack's basket is full when it has 12 apples.
   - Currently, Jack's basket has space for 4 more apples, meaning it is not full.
   - Therefore, the current number of apples in Jack's basket is:
     \[
     12 - 4 = 8 \text{ apples}
     \]

2. **Determine Jill's Basket Capacity:**
   - Jill's basket can hold twice as much as Jack's basket when both are full.
   - Since Jack's basket holds 12 apples when full, Jill's basket can hold:
     \[
     2 \times 12 = 24 \text{ apples}
     \]

3. **Calculate How Many Times Jack's Current Apples Fit into Jill's Basket:**
   - We need to find out how many times Jack's current number of apples (8 apples) can fit into Jill's basket (24 apples).
   - This is calculated by dividing the capacity of Jill's basket by the current number of apples in Jack's basket:
     \[
     \frac{24}{8} = 3
     \]

Therefore, Jack's current number of apples can fit into Jill's basket 3 times.

**Final Answer:**
Jack's current number of apples can fit into Jill's basket 3 times.
