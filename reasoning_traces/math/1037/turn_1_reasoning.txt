==================================================

To determine how much money Amor will have left after buying cheese, we need to calculate the total cost of the Parmesan and mozzarella cheese she purchases.

1. **Calculate the cost of Parmesan cheese:**
   - Price per pound of Parmesan cheese = $11
   - Amount of Parmesan cheese bought = 2 pounds
   - Total cost for Parmesan = Price per pound × Amount bought
   \[
   \text{Total cost for Parmesan} = 11 \, \text{dollars/pound} \times 2 \, \text{pounds} = 22 \, \text{dollars}
   \]

2. **Calculate the cost of Mozzarella cheese:**
   - Price per pound of Mozzarella cheese = $6
   - Amount of Mozzarella cheese bought = 3 pounds
   - Total cost for Mozzarella = Price per pound × Amount bought
   \[
   \text{Total cost for Mozzarella} = 6 \, \text{dollars/pound} \times 3 \, \text{pounds} = 18 \, \text{dollars}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total cost of both cheeses:**
   - Total cost = Total cost for Parmesan + Total cost for Mozzarella
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = 22 \, \text{dollars} + 18 \, \text{dollars} = 40 \, \text{dollars}
   \]

4. **Calculate how much money Amor has left:**
   - Initial amount of cash = $50
   - Amount spent on cheese = $40
   - Amount left = Initial amount - Amount spent
   \[
   \text{Amount left} = 50 \, \text{dollars} - 40 \, \text{dollars} = 10 \, \text{dollars}
   \]

Thus, after buying the cheese, Amor will have **$10** left to buy meat.

**Final answer:** $10
