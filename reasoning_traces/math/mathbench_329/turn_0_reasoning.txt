==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample math problem 329" refers to. Since there is no specific problem statement provided, I will create a sample math problem labeled as "329" and solve it step by step.

**Sample Math Problem 329:**

**Problem Statement:**
A rectangle has a length that is twice its width. If the perimeter of the rectangle is 48 units, find the dimensions of the rectangle.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( w \) be the width of the rectangle.
   - Since the length is twice the width, let \( l = 2w \).

2. **Perimeter Formula:**
   - The formula for the perimeter \( P \) of a rectangle is given by:
     \[
     P = 2l + 2w
     \]

3. **Substitute Known Values:**
   - We know the perimeter is 48 units, so:
     \[
     48 = 2(2w) + 2w
     \]

4. **Simplify the Equation:**
   - Simplify the expression:
     \[
     48 = 4w + 2w
     \]
   - Combine like terms:
     \[
     48 = 6w
     \]

5. **Solve for \( w \):**
   - Divide both sides by 6 to solve for \( w \):
     \[
     w = \frac{48}{6} = 8
     \]

6. **Find the Length \( l \):**
   - Since \( l = 2w \), substitute \( w = 8 \):
     \[
     l = 2 \times 8 = 16
     \]

7. **Verify the Solution:**
   - Check the perimeter with the found dimensions:
     \[
     P = 2l + 2w = 2(16) + 2(8) = 32 + 16 = 48
     \]
   - The calculated perimeter matches the given perimeter, confirming our solution is correct.

**Final Answer:**
The dimensions of the rectangle are:
- Width \( w = 8 \) units
- Length \( l = 16 \) units
