   - Include units if applicable.

### Example Problem

Let's solve a sample math problem using the above steps:

**Problem:**
Find the value of \( x \) if \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).

**Step 1: Understand the Problem**
- We need to find the value of \( x \) that satisfies the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).

**Step 2: Devise a Plan**
- We can solve for \( x \) by isolating it on one side of the equation.

**Step 3: Carry Out the Plan**
1. Start with the equation: 
   \[
   2x + 3 = 11
   \]
2. Subtract 3 from both sides to isolate the term with \( x \):
   \[
   2x = 11 - 3
   \]
   \[
   2x = 8
   \]
3. Divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( x \):
   \[
   x = \frac{8}{2}
   \]
   \[
   x = 4
   \]

**Step 4: Check Your Work**
- Substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation to verify:
  \[
  2(4) + 3 = 8 + 3 = 11
  \]
- The left side equals the right side, confirming our solution is correct.

**Step 5: State the Final Answer**
- The value of \( x \) is \( 4 \).
