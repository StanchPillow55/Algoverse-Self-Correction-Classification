==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 329," we first need to understand what the problem is asking. However, the problem statement "Sample math problem 329" is not specific, and without additional context or details, it's impossible to determine what the problem entails. 

To proceed, let's assume that "Sample math problem 329" refers to a generic math problem. Since no specific details are provided, I'll create a hypothetical math problem and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**

Let's assume "Sample math problem 329" is a basic algebra problem:

**Problem:**
Solve for \( x \) in the equation:
\[ 3x + 5 = 20 \]

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Equation:**
   The equation given is \( 3x + 5 = 20 \). Our goal is to solve for \( x \).

2. **Isolate the Variable:**
   To solve for \( x \), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We can start by eliminating the constant term on the left side.

3. **Subtract 5 from Both Sides:**
   \[
   3x + 5 - 5 = 20 - 5
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   3x = 15
   \]

4. **Divide by 3:**
   To solve for \( x \), divide both sides by 3:
   \[
   \frac{3x}{3} = \frac{15}{3}
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   x = 5
   \]

5. **Verify the Solution:**
   Substitute \( x = 5 \) back into the original equation to verify:
   \[
   3(5) + 5 = 20
   \]
   \[
   15 + 5 = 20
   \]
   \[
   20 = 20
   \]
   The left side equals the right side, confirming that our solution is correct.

**Final Answer:**
The solution to the equation \( 3x + 5 = 20 \) is \( x = 5 \).

If "Sample math problem 329" refers to a different problem, please provide additional details or context so I can assist you more accurately.
