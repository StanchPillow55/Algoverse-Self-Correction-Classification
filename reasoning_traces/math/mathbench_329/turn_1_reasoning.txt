Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 329," I need more specific information about the problem itself. Since the problem number "329" doesn't provide any context or details, I'll create a hypothetical math problem and solve it step by step. 

Let's assume the problem is as follows:

**Problem 329:**
Calculate the sum of the first 20 positive integers.

**Step-by-step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   We need to find the sum of the first 20 positive integers. These integers are 1, 2, 3, ..., 20.

2. **Identify the Formula:**
   The sum of the first \( n \) positive integers can be calculated using the formula:
   \[
   S = \frac{n(n + 1)}{2}
   \]
   where \( S \) is the sum and \( n \) is the number of terms.

3. **Substitute the Values:**
   Here, \( n = 20 \). Substitute 20 into the formula:
   \[
   S = \frac{20(20 + 1)}{2}
   \]

4. **Calculate the Expression:**
   - First, calculate \( 20 + 1 \):
     \[
     20 + 1 = 21
     \]
   - Next, multiply 20 by 21:
     \[
     20 \times 21 = 420
     \]
   - Finally, divide the product by 2:
     \[
     \frac{420}{2} = 210
     \]

5. **Conclusion:**
   The sum of the first 20 positive integers is 210.

**Final Answer:**
The sum of the first 20 positive integers is 210.
