==================================================

To solve the problem, I need more specific information about "Sample math problem 118." Since I don't have access to external databases or specific problem sets, I'll demonstrate how to solve a generic math problem by walking through a sample problem step-by-step.

Let's consider a sample math problem:

**Problem:** Solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).

**Step 1: Understand the Problem**

The equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \) is a linear equation in one variable. Our goal is to find the value of \( x \) that makes this equation true.

**Step 2: Isolate the Variable**

To solve for \( x \), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We can do this by performing inverse operations.

**Step 3: Perform Inverse Operations**

1. **Subtract 3 from both sides**: This will help eliminate the constant term on the left side of the equation.

   \[
   2x + 3 - 3 = 11 - 3
   \]

   Simplifying both sides, we get:

   \[
   2x = 8
   \]

2. **Divide both sides by 2**: This will isolate \( x \) by removing the coefficient of 2.

   \[
   \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{8}{2}
   \]

   Simplifying both sides, we find:

   \[
   x = 4
   \]

**Step 4: Verify the Solution**

To ensure our solution is correct, we substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation:

\[
2(4) + 3 = 11
\]

Simplifying the left side:

\[
8 + 3 = 11
\]

Since both sides of the equation are equal, our solution \( x = 4 \) is verified.

**Final Answer**

The solution to the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \) is \( x = 4 \).
