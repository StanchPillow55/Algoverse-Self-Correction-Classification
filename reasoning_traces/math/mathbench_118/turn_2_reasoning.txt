==================================================

To solve the problem, we first need to understand what "Sample math problem 118" refers to. Since the problem is not explicitly stated, I'll create a sample math problem and solve it step by step.

**Sample Math Problem 118:**

**Problem:**  
Solve for \( x \) in the equation:  
\[ 2x + 3 = 11 \]

**Step-by-step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Equation:**
   The given equation is a linear equation in one variable, \( x \). Our goal is to isolate \( x \) on one side of the equation to find its value.

2. **Isolate the Variable:**
   We want to get \( x \) by itself on one side of the equation. Start by eliminating the constant term on the left side of the equation.

   \[
   2x + 3 = 11
   \]

   Subtract 3 from both sides to remove the constant term from the left side:

   \[
   2x + 3 - 3 = 11 - 3
   \]

   Simplifying both sides gives:

   \[
   2x = 8
   \]

3. **Solve for \( x \):**
   Now, divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( x \):

   \[
   \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{8}{2}
   \]

   Simplifying both sides gives:

   \[
   x = 4
   \]

4. **Verify the Solution:**
   Substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies the equation:

   \[
   2(4) + 3 = 11
   \]

   Calculate the left side:

   \[
   8 + 3 = 11
   \]

   Since both sides of the equation are equal, our solution is verified.

**Final Answer:**

The solution to the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \) is \( x = 4 \).
