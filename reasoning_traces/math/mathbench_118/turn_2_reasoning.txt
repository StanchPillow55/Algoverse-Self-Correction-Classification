Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 118," we first need to understand what the problem is asking. However, the problem statement "Sample math problem 118" is not specific enough for us to determine the exact question or the type of math problem it is. Therefore, I will demonstrate a general approach to solving a typical math problem, assuming it could be a common type such as an algebraic equation, a geometry problem, or a word problem.

Let's assume "Sample math problem 118" is an algebraic equation problem. Here's a step-by-step approach to solving a typical algebraic equation:

### Example Problem:
Solve for \( x \) in the equation:
\[ 2x + 3 = 11 \]

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Understand the Equation:**
   The equation given is \( 2x + 3 = 11 \). This is a linear equation in one variable, \( x \).

2. **Isolate the Variable:**
   To solve for \( x \), we need to isolate \( x \) on one side of the equation. We can do this by performing inverse operations.

3. **Subtract 3 from Both Sides:**
   \[
   2x + 3 - 3 = 11 - 3
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   2x = 8
   \]

4. **Divide Both Sides by 2:**
   \[
   \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{8}{2}
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   x = 4
   \]

5. **Verify the Solution:**
   Substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation to verify:
   \[
   2(4) + 3 = 11
   \]
   \[
   8 + 3 = 11
   \]
   \[
   11 = 11
   \]
   The left side equals the right side, confirming that \( x = 4 \) is the correct solution.

### Final Answer:
The solution to the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \) is \( x = 4 \).

If "Sample math problem 118" refers to a different type of problem, please provide additional details or context so I can tailor the solution to the specific problem.
