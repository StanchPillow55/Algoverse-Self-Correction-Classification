==================================================

To determine how much longer John and Jack have to get to school without being late, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Total Time Available**: John and Jack have a total of 30 minutes to walk to school.

2. **Time Taken to Reach the Library**: It takes them 6 minutes to walk to the corner where the library is.

3. **Time Taken to Reach the Fire Station**: After reaching the library, it takes them another 13 minutes to walk to the fire station.

4. **Calculate Total Time Spent So Far**: 
   - Time to library: 6 minutes
   - Time to fire station: 13 minutes
   - Total time spent = Time to library + Time to fire station
   \[
   \text{Total time spent} = 6 \text{ minutes} + 13 \text{ minutes} = 19 \text{ minutes}
   \]

5. **Calculate Remaining Time**: 
   - Total time available = 30 minutes
   - Total time spent = 19 minutes
   - Remaining time = Total time available - Total time spent
   \[
   \text{Remaining time} = 30 \text{ minutes} - 19 \text{ minutes} = 11 \text{ minutes}
   \]

Thus, John and Jack have 11 minutes left to get to school without being late.

**Final Answer**: They have 11 minutes left to get to school without being late.
