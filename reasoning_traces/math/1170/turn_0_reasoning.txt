To solve the problem, we need to determine how many pints of red paint were used in the mural, given the total amount of paint and the proportions of each color.

1. **Identify the total amount of paint used**: 
   The total amount of paint used in the mural is 12 pints.

2. **Determine the proportion of yellow paint**: 
   According to the problem, half of the mural is yellow. Therefore, the amount of yellow paint used is:
   \[
   \text{Amount of yellow paint} = \frac{1}{2} \times 12 \text{ pints} = 6 \text{ pints}
   \]

3. **Calculate the remaining amount of paint**: 
   Since half of the mural is yellow, the remaining half consists of red, white, and purple paint. The total amount of paint that is not yellow is:
   \[
   \text{Remaining paint} = 12 \text{ pints} - 6 \text{ pints} = 6 \text{ pints}
   \]

4. **Determine the distribution of the remaining colors**: 
   The problem states that there are equal amounts of red, white, and purple paint. Let \( r \) represent the amount of red paint, \( w \) represent the amount of white paint, and \( p \) represent the amount of purple paint. Since they are equal:
   \[
   r = w = p
   \]
   We can denote the amount of each color as \( x \). Therefore, we have:
   \[
   r = x, \quad w = x, \quad p = x
   \]

5. **Set up the equation for the remaining paint**: 
   Since the total amount of red, white, and purple paint is equal to the remaining paint (6 pints), we can write the equation:
   \[
   r + w + p = 6 \text{ pints}
   \]
   Substituting \( r, w, \) and \( p \) with \( x \):
   \[
   x + x + x = 6
   \]
   This simplifies to:
   \[
   3x = 6
   \]

6. **Solve for \( x \)**: 
   To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 3:
   \[
   x = \frac{6}{3} = 2
   \]

7. **Determine the amount of red paint**: 
   Since \( r = x \), we find that:
   \[
   r = 2 \text{ pints}
   \]

Thus, the amount of red paint used in the mural is \( \boxed{2} \) pints.
