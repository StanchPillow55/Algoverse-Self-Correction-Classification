Question ID: superglue_460
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 460" refers to. Since the problem statement is not clear and lacks specific details, I'll demonstrate how to approach a generic math problem using logical reasoning and step-by-step calculations. 

Let's assume "Sample reasoning question 460" is a placeholder for a typical math problem. I'll create a sample problem and solve it to illustrate the process:

**Sample Problem:**
Calculate the sum of the first 10 positive integers.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   We need to find the sum of the first 10 positive integers. The sequence of the first 10 positive integers is: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.

2. **Identify the Formula:**
   The sum of the first \( n \) positive integers can be calculated using the formula:
   \[
   S = \frac{n(n + 1)}{2}
   \]
   where \( S \) is the sum and \( n \) is the number of terms.

3. **Substitute the Values:**
   In this case, \( n = 10 \). Substitute 10 into the formula:
   \[
   S = \frac{10(10 + 1)}{2}
   \]

4. **Perform the Calculations:**
   \[
   S = \frac{10 \times 11}{2} = \frac{110}{2} = 55
   \]

5. **Verify the Calculation:**
   To ensure the calculation is correct, we can manually add the numbers:
   \[
   1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 10 = 55
   \]

6. **State the Final Answer:**
   The sum of the first 10 positive integers is 55.

By following these steps, we have solved the problem systematically and verified our result. If "Sample reasoning question 460" refers to a different problem, please provide additional details or context so I can assist you further.
