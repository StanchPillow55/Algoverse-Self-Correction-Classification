==================================================

To solve the problem, we first need to understand what "Sample reasoning question 460" refers to. Since the question itself is not provided, I'll demonstrate a general approach to solving a math problem by considering a hypothetical example. Let's assume the problem involves solving a quadratic equation, which is a common type of math problem.

**Hypothetical Problem:**
Solve the quadratic equation \(2x^2 - 4x - 6 = 0\).

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Identify the Standard Form:**
   A quadratic equation is generally in the form \(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\). Here, \(a = 2\), \(b = -4\), and \(c = -6\).

2. **Calculate the Discriminant:**
   The discriminant (\(\Delta\)) of a quadratic equation \(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\) is given by \(\Delta = b^2 - 4ac\).
   \[
   \Delta = (-4)^2 - 4 \times 2 \times (-6) = 16 + 48 = 64
   \]

3. **Determine the Nature of the Roots:**
   Since the discriminant is positive (\(\Delta = 64\)), the quadratic equation has two distinct real roots.

4. **Use the Quadratic Formula:**
   The roots of the quadratic equation can be found using the quadratic formula:
   \[
   x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{\Delta}}{2a}
   \]
   Substitute the values of \(a\), \(b\), and \(\Delta\):
   \[
   x = \frac{-(-4) \pm \sqrt{64}}{2 \times 2} = \frac{4 \pm 8}{4}
   \]

5. **Calculate the Roots:**
   - First root:
     \[
     x_1 = \frac{4 + 8}{4} = \frac{12}{4} = 3
     \]
   - Second root:
     \[
     x_2 = \frac{4 - 8}{4} = \frac{-4}{4} = -1
     \]

6. **Verify the Solution:**
   Substitute \(x_1 = 3\) and \(x_2 = -1\) back into the original equation to verify:
   - For \(x_1 = 3\):
     \[
     2(3)^2 - 4(3) - 6 = 18 - 12 - 6 = 0
     \]
   - For \(x_2 = -1\):
     \[
     2(-1)^2 - 4(-1) - 6 = 2 + 4 - 6 = 0
     \]

Both values satisfy the original equation, confirming they are correct.

**Final Answer:**
The solutions to the quadratic equation \(2x^2 - 4x - 6 = 0\) are \(x = 3\) and \(x = -1\).
