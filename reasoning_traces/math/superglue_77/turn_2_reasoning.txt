==================================================

To solve the problem effectively, we need to first understand the context and details of "Sample reasoning question 77." However, since the specific content of this question is not provided, I'll demonstrate a general approach to solving a reasoning-based math problem. 

Let's assume "Sample reasoning question 77" involves a typical math reasoning scenario. I'll create a hypothetical problem and solve it step-by-step:

**Hypothetical Problem:**
A farmer has a total of 100 animals, consisting of chickens and cows. If the total number of legs among all the animals is 280, how many chickens and how many cows does the farmer have?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( c \) be the number of chickens.
   - Let \( w \) be the number of cows.

2. **Set Up Equations:**
   - We know the total number of animals is 100:
     \[
     c + w = 100
     \]
   - Chickens have 2 legs each, and cows have 4 legs each. The total number of legs is 280:
     \[
     2c + 4w = 280
     \]

3. **Solve the System of Equations:**
   - From the first equation, express \( c \) in terms of \( w \):
     \[
     c = 100 - w
     \]
   - Substitute \( c = 100 - w \) into the second equation:
     \[
     2(100 - w) + 4w = 280
     \]
   - Simplify and solve for \( w \):
     \[
     200 - 2w + 4w = 280
     \]
     \[
     200 + 2w = 280
     \]
     \[
     2w = 80
     \]
     \[
     w = 40
     \]

4. **Find the Number of Chickens:**
   - Substitute \( w = 40 \) back into the equation for \( c \):
     \[
     c = 100 - 40 = 60
     \]

5. **Verify the Solution:**
   - Check the total number of legs:
     - Chickens: \( 60 \times 2 = 120 \) legs
     - Cows: \( 40 \times 4 = 160 \) legs
     - Total: \( 120 + 160 = 280 \) legs, which matches the given condition.

6. **State the Final Answer:**
   - The farmer has 60 chickens and 40 cows.

This methodical approach ensures that each step is clear and logical, leading to a correct and verified solution. If you have a specific question or need help with a different problem, please provide the details, and I'll be glad to assist!
