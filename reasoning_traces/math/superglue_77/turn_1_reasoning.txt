==================================================

To solve the problem, I need more specific information about "Sample reasoning question 77." Since the problem statement is not provided, I'll demonstrate how to approach a generic math problem step by step. If you have a specific problem in mind, please provide the details, and I'll be happy to help.

Let's consider a sample math problem:

**Problem:** Solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).

**Step 1: Understand the Problem**
The equation given is a simple linear equation in one variable, \( x \). Our goal is to find the value of \( x \) that makes the equation true.

**Step 2: Isolate the Variable**
To solve for \( x \), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We start by eliminating the constant term on the left side of the equation.

**Step 3: Subtract 3 from Both Sides**
Subtract 3 from both sides to move the constant term to the right side:
\[
2x + 3 - 3 = 11 - 3
\]
Simplifying both sides gives:
\[
2x = 8
\]

**Step 4: Divide by the Coefficient of \( x \)**
The next step is to divide both sides by the coefficient of \( x \), which is 2, to solve for \( x \):
\[
\frac{2x}{2} = \frac{8}{2}
\]
Simplifying both sides gives:
\[
x = 4
\]

**Step 5: Verify the Solution**
To ensure the solution is correct, substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation:
\[
2(4) + 3 = 11
\]
Calculate the left side:
\[
8 + 3 = 11
\]
Since both sides of the equation are equal, the solution \( x = 4 \) is verified.

**Final Answer**
The solution to the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \) is \( x = 4 \).

If you have a specific problem or need further assistance, please provide additional details, and I'll be glad to help!
