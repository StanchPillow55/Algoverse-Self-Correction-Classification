==================================================

To solve the problem, we will follow these steps:

1. **Identify the total number of chairs and their capacity**:
   - There are 40 chairs, and each chair can accommodate 2 people.
   - Therefore, the total capacity of the chairs is:
     \[
     \text{Total capacity} = 40 \text{ chairs} \times 2 \text{ people/chair} = 80 \text{ people}
     \]

2. **Determine the number of chairs that were not occupied**:
   - According to the problem, \( \frac{2}{5} \) of the chairs were not occupied.
   - To find the number of unoccupied chairs, we calculate:
     \[
     \text{Unoccupied chairs} = \frac{2}{5} \times 40 = 16 \text{ chairs}
     \]

3. **Calculate the number of occupied chairs**:
   - The number of occupied chairs is the total number of chairs minus the unoccupied chairs:
     \[
     \text{Occupied chairs} = 40 - 16 = 24 \text{ chairs}
     \]

4. **Determine the number of people who attended the meeting**:
   - Since each occupied chair has 2 people, the total number of board members who attended the meeting is:
     \[
     \text{Attending members} = 24 \text{ chairs} \times 2 \text{ people/chair} = 48 \text{ people}
     \]

5. **Final answer**:
   - Therefore, the number of board members who did attend the meeting is:
     \[
     \boxed{48}
     \]
