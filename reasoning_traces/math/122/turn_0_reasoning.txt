==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine how many board members attended the meeting given the information about the chairs and their occupancy.

### Step-by-step Solution:

1. **Determine the Total Capacity of the Chairs:**
   - There are 40 chairs, and each chair has a capacity of 2 people.
   - Therefore, the total capacity of the chairs is:
     \[
     40 \text{ chairs} \times 2 \text{ people per chair} = 80 \text{ people}
     \]

2. **Understand the Distribution of Occupied and Unoccupied Chairs:**
   - We are told that \( \frac{2}{5} \) of the chairs were not occupied.
   - Therefore, the fraction of chairs that were occupied is:
     \[
     1 - \frac{2}{5} = \frac{3}{5}
     \]

3. **Calculate the Number of Occupied Chairs:**
   - The number of chairs that were occupied is:
     \[
     \frac{3}{5} \times 40 = 24 \text{ chairs}
     \]

4. **Determine the Number of People Who Attended:**
   - Each occupied chair had 2 people.
   - Therefore, the number of board members who attended the meeting is:
     \[
     24 \text{ occupied chairs} \times 2 \text{ people per chair} = 48 \text{ people}
     \]

### Conclusion:

The number of board members who attended the meeting is 48.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{48}
\]
