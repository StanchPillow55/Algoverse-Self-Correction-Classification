To find out how many hours Sadie slept in total throughout the week, we can break the problem down step by step.

1. **Sleep on Monday**: 
   - Sadie slept 8 hours on Monday.

2. **Sleep on Tuesday and Wednesday**:
   - On Tuesday, she slept 2 hours less than Monday. 
   - Therefore, on Tuesday: 
     \[
     8 \text{ hours} - 2 \text{ hours} = 6 \text{ hours}
     \]
   - On Wednesday, she again slept 2 hours less than Monday:
   - Therefore, on Wednesday:
     \[
     8 \text{ hours} - 2 \text{ hours} = 6 \text{ hours}
     \]

3. **Sleep on Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday**:
   - For the rest of the week (Thursday to Sunday), she slept 1 hour more than the amount she slept on Tuesday and Wednesday.
   - Since she slept 6 hours on both Tuesday and Wednesday, we calculate:
   - Therefore, for Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday:
     \[
     6 \text{ hours} + 1 \text{ hour} = 7 \text{ hours}
     \]
   - She will sleep 7 hours on each of these four days.

4. **Calculating total sleep for the week**:
   - Now we can add up the hours she slept each day:
   - Total sleep for the week:
   \[
   \text{Monday} + \text{Tuesday} + \text{Wednesday} + \text{Thursday} + \text{Friday} + \text{Saturday} + \text{Sunday}
   \]
   \[
   = 8 \text{ hours} + 6 \text{ hours} + 6 \text{ hours} + 7 \text{ hours} + 7 \text{ hours} + 7 \text{ hours} + 7 \text{ hours}
   \]

5. **Calculating the total**:
   - First, we add the hours:
   \[
   8 + 6 + 6 + 7 + 7 + 7 + 7
   \]
   - Adding step by step:
   \[
   8 + 6 = 14
   \]
   \[
   14 + 6 = 20
   \]
   \[
   20 + 7 = 27
   \]
   \[
   27 + 7 = 34
   \]
   \[
   34 + 7 = 41
   \]
   \[
   41 + 7 = 48
   \]

Thus, the total number of hours Sadie slept throughout the week is:
\[
\boxed{48}
\]
