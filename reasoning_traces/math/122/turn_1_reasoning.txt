Question ID: 122
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine how many board members attended the meeting based on the given information about the chairs and their occupancy.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Understand the Chair Setup:**
   - There are 40 chairs in total.
   - Each chair has a capacity of 2 people.
   - Therefore, the total capacity of all chairs is \(40 \times 2 = 80\) people.

2. **Determine the Number of Unoccupied Chairs:**
   - We are told that \( \frac{2}{5} \) of the chairs were not occupied.
   - To find the number of unoccupied chairs, calculate \( \frac{2}{5} \times 40 = 16 \) chairs.

3. **Determine the Number of Occupied Chairs:**
   - If 16 chairs were unoccupied, then the number of occupied chairs is \( 40 - 16 = 24 \) chairs.

4. **Calculate the Number of People Who Attended:**
   - Each occupied chair had 2 people.
   - Therefore, the number of people who attended the meeting is \( 24 \times 2 = 48 \) people.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The number of board members who attended the meeting is 48.

Thus, the final answer is that 48 board members attended the meeting.
