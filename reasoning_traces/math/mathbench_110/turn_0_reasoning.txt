==================================================

To solve "Sample math problem 110," we first need to understand what the problem is asking. However, the problem statement "Sample math problem 110" is not specific enough to determine what the actual mathematical question is. 

For the sake of providing a complete solution, let's assume a hypothetical math problem that could be labeled as "Sample math problem 110." Let's say the problem is:

**Problem:**
Solve for \( x \) in the equation: 
\[ 2x + 5 = 15 \]

**Solution:**

1. **Understand the Equation:**
   The equation given is a linear equation in one variable, \( x \). Our goal is to isolate \( x \) on one side of the equation to find its value.

2. **Subtract 5 from Both Sides:**
   To begin isolating \( x \), we first eliminate the constant term on the left side of the equation. We do this by subtracting 5 from both sides:
   \[
   2x + 5 - 5 = 15 - 5
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   2x = 10
   \]

3. **Divide Both Sides by 2:**
   Next, we need to solve for \( x \) by getting rid of the coefficient of \( x \), which is 2. We do this by dividing both sides of the equation by 2:
   \[
   \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{10}{2}
   \]
   Simplifying both sides results in:
   \[
   x = 5
   \]

4. **Check the Solution:**
   To ensure our solution is correct, we substitute \( x = 5 \) back into the original equation:
   \[
   2(5) + 5 = 15
   \]
   Simplifying the left side gives:
   \[
   10 + 5 = 15
   \]
   Since both sides of the equation are equal, our solution is verified.

**Final Answer:**
The solution to the equation \( 2x + 5 = 15 \) is \( x = 5 \).
