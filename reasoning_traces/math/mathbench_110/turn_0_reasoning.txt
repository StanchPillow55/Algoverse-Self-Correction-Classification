==================================================

To solve the problem, I need to first understand what "Sample math problem 110" refers to. Since this is not a standard or universally recognized problem, I'll need more context or details about the problem itself to provide a solution. However, I can create a sample math problem and solve it step by step for demonstration purposes.

Let's create a sample math problem:

**Problem:**
Solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 3x + 5 = 20 \).

**Solution:**

To solve the equation \( 3x + 5 = 20 \), we need to isolate the variable \( x \). Here are the steps:

1. **Subtract 5 from both sides of the equation:**

   \[
   3x + 5 - 5 = 20 - 5
   \]

   Simplifying both sides gives:

   \[
   3x = 15
   \]

2. **Divide both sides by 3 to solve for \( x \):**

   \[
   \frac{3x}{3} = \frac{15}{3}
   \]

   Simplifying both sides gives:

   \[
   x = 5
   \]

**Verification:**

To ensure the solution is correct, substitute \( x = 5 \) back into the original equation:

\[
3(5) + 5 = 20
\]

Calculate the left side:

\[
15 + 5 = 20
\]

Since both sides of the equation are equal, the solution \( x = 5 \) is verified to be correct.

**Final Answer:**

The solution to the equation \( 3x + 5 = 20 \) is \( x = 5 \).
