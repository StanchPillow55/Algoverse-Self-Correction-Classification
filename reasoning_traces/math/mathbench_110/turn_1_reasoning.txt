==================================================

To solve the problem, we first need to understand what "Sample math problem 110" refers to. Since no specific details are provided about the problem, I'll assume it's a placeholder for a generic math problem. Let's create a sample problem based on common math topics and solve it step by step.

**Sample Math Problem 110:**
Solve for \( x \) in the equation: 
\[ 2x + 3 = 11 \]

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Equation:**
   The given equation is a linear equation in one variable, \( x \). Our goal is to isolate \( x \) on one side of the equation to find its value.

2. **Isolate the Variable:**
   To isolate \( x \), we need to eliminate the constant term on the left side of the equation. The equation is:
   \[ 2x + 3 = 11 \]

3. **Subtract 3 from Both Sides:**
   To remove the \( +3 \) from the left side, subtract 3 from both sides of the equation:
   \[
   2x + 3 - 3 = 11 - 3
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   2x = 8
   \]

4. **Solve for \( x \):**
   Now, divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( x \):
   \[
   \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{8}{2}
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   x = 4
   \]

5. **Verify the Solution:**
   Substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation to verify:
   \[
   2(4) + 3 = 11
   \]
   Simplifying the left side:
   \[
   8 + 3 = 11
   \]
   Since both sides of the equation are equal, our solution is verified.

**Final Answer:**
The solution to the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \) is \( x = 4 \).
