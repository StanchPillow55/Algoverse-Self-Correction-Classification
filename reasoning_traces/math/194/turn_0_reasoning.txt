To determine the total cost of the gifts after the rebate, we need to calculate the total cost of each type of item Mr. Grey purchased, sum these costs, and then apply the rebate.

1. **Calculate the cost of the polo shirts:**
   - Mr. Grey purchased 3 polo shirts, each costing $26.
   - The total cost for the polo shirts is calculated as follows:
     \[
     \text{Total cost of polo shirts} = 3 \times 26 = 78
     \]

2. **Calculate the cost of the necklaces:**
   - Mr. Grey purchased 2 necklaces, each costing $83.
   - The total cost for the necklaces is calculated as follows:
     \[
     \text{Total cost of necklaces} = 2 \times 83 = 166
     \]

3. **Calculate the cost of the computer game:**
   - Mr. Grey purchased 1 computer game costing $90.
   - The total cost for the computer game is:
     \[
     \text{Total cost of computer game} = 90
     \]

4. **Calculate the total cost before the rebate:**
   - Add the total costs of the polo shirts, necklaces, and computer game:
     \[
     \text{Total cost before rebate} = 78 + 166 + 90 = 334
     \]

5. **Apply the rebate:**
   - Mr. Grey received a $12 rebate.
   - Subtract the rebate from the total cost before the rebate:
     \[
     \text{Total cost after rebate} = 334 - 12 = 322
     \]

Thus, the total cost of the gifts after applying the rebate is \(\boxed{322}\).
