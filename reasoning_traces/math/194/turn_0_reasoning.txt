To find the total cost of the gifts after the rebate, we will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total cost of the polo shirts.**
   - Mr. Grey purchased 3 polo shirts at $26 each.
   - Total cost for polo shirts = Number of shirts × Price per shirt
   \[
   \text{Total cost for polo shirts} = 3 \times 26 = 78
   \]

2. **Calculate the total cost of the necklaces.**
   - Mr. Grey purchased 2 necklaces at $83 each.
   - Total cost for necklaces = Number of necklaces × Price per necklace
   \[
   \text{Total cost for necklaces} = 2 \times 83 = 166
   \]

3. **Calculate the total cost of the computer game.**
   - Mr. Grey purchased 1 computer game for $90.
   - Total cost for computer game = Number of games × Price per game
   \[
   \text{Total cost for computer game} = 1 \times 90 = 90
   \]

4. **Calculate the total cost of all gifts before the rebate.**
   - Total cost = Total cost for polo shirts + Total cost for necklaces + Total cost for computer game
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = 78 + 166 + 90
   \]
   - Performing the addition:
   \[
   78 + 166 = 244
   \]
   \[
   244 + 90 = 334
   \]
   - So, the total cost before the rebate is $334.

5. **Apply the rebate.**
   - Mr. Grey received a $12 rebate.
   - Total cost after rebate = Total cost before rebate - Rebate
   \[
   \text{Total cost after rebate} = 334 - 12
   \]
   - Performing the subtraction:
   \[
   334 - 12 = 322
   \]

Thus, the total cost of the gifts after the rebate is \(\boxed{322}\).
