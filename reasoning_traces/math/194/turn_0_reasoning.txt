To determine how much change Violetta will get after buying the crayons, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the total cost of the crayons**:
   - Violetta needs crayons in 5 different colors.
   - Each crayon costs $2.
   - Therefore, the total cost for 5 crayons can be calculated as follows:

   \[
   \text{Total Cost} = \text{Number of Crayons} \times \text{Cost per Crayon}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total Cost} = 5 \times 2 = 10
   \]

2. **Calculate the change Violetta will receive**:
   - Violetta has prepared $20 for this purchase.
   - To find out how much change she will receive, we subtract the total cost of the crayons from the amount of money she has:

   \[
   \text{Change} = \text{Amount Prepared} - \text{Total Cost}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Change} = 20 - 10 = 10
   \]

3. **Final Answer**:
   - Violetta will receive $10 in change after purchasing the crayons.

Thus, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{10}
\]
