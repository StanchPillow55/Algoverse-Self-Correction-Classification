==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine how long it will take David to wash all 64 windows, given that he can wash 4 windows in 10 minutes. We can solve this problem using a step-by-step approach:

1. **Determine the rate at which David washes windows:**

   David washes 4 windows in 10 minutes. To find the rate at which he washes windows, we calculate the time it takes to wash one window.

   \[
   \text{Time per window} = \frac{\text{Total time}}{\text{Number of windows}} = \frac{10 \text{ minutes}}{4 \text{ windows}} = 2.5 \text{ minutes per window}
   \]

2. **Calculate the total time to wash all 64 windows:**

   Now that we know it takes 2.5 minutes to wash one window, we can calculate the time it will take to wash 64 windows by multiplying the time per window by the total number of windows.

   \[
   \text{Total time} = \text{Time per window} \times \text{Number of windows} = 2.5 \text{ minutes/window} \times 64 \text{ windows}
   \]

3. **Perform the multiplication:**

   \[
   2.5 \times 64 = 160
   \]

   To verify this calculation, break it down:

   - First, calculate \(2 \times 64 = 128\).
   - Then, calculate \(0.5 \times 64 = 32\).
   - Add these two results together: \(128 + 32 = 160\).

4. **Conclusion:**

   It will take David 160 minutes to wash all 64 windows.

Therefore, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{160 \text{ minutes}}
\]
