==================================================

To determine how long it will take David to wash all 64 windows, we first need to establish how many windows he can wash in a given time frame.

1. **Calculate the rate at which David washes windows:**
   - David washes 4 windows in 10 minutes.
   - To find out how many windows he can wash in 1 minute, we divide the number of windows by the time taken:
     \[
     \text{Rate} = \frac{4 \text{ windows}}{10 \text{ minutes}} = 0.4 \text{ windows per minute}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total time to wash 64 windows:**
   - Now that we know David can wash 0.4 windows per minute, we can find out how long it will take him to wash 64 windows by dividing the total number of windows by his rate:
     \[
     \text{Time} = \frac{64 \text{ windows}}{0.4 \text{ windows per minute}} 
     \]
   - Performing the division:
     \[
     \text{Time} = 64 \div 0.4
     \]
   - To simplify the division, we can convert 0.4 to a fraction:
     \[
     0.4 = \frac{4}{10} = \frac{2}{5}
     \]
   - Dividing by a fraction is the same as multiplying by its reciprocal:
     \[
     \text{Time} = 64 \times \frac{5}{2}
     \]
   - Now, calculate \(64 \times \frac{5}{2}\):
     \[
     64 \times \frac{5}{2} = \frac{64 \times 5}{2} = \frac{320}{2} = 160 \text{ minutes}
     \]

3. **Final answer:**
   - Therefore, it will take David **160 minutes** to wash all 64 windows.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{160}
\]
