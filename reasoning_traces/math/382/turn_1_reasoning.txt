==================================================

To solve the problem of determining how long it will take David to wash all 64 windows, we need to first understand the rate at which David washes windows and then apply that rate to the total number of windows.

**Step 1: Determine David's rate of washing windows.**

We know from the problem statement that David takes 10 minutes to wash 4 windows. To find out how long it takes him to wash one window, we can set up a proportion or simply divide the total time by the number of windows:

\[
\text{Time per window} = \frac{\text{Total time}}{\text{Number of windows}} = \frac{10 \text{ minutes}}{4 \text{ windows}} = 2.5 \text{ minutes per window}
\]

This means David takes 2.5 minutes to wash one window.

**Step 2: Calculate the total time to wash 64 windows.**

Now that we know it takes David 2.5 minutes to wash one window, we can calculate the total time it will take him to wash all 64 windows by multiplying the time per window by the total number of windows:

\[
\text{Total time} = \text{Time per window} \times \text{Total number of windows} = 2.5 \text{ minutes/window} \times 64 \text{ windows}
\]

\[
\text{Total time} = 160 \text{ minutes}
\]

**Final Answer:**

It will take David 160 minutes to wash all 64 windows.
