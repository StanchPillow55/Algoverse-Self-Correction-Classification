Question ID: 382
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine how long it will take David to wash all 64 windows, given that it takes him 10 minutes to wash 4 windows.

**Step 1: Determine the rate at which David washes windows.**

David washes 4 windows in 10 minutes. To find the rate, we calculate the time it takes to wash one window:

\[
\text{Time per window} = \frac{\text{Total time}}{\text{Number of windows}} = \frac{10 \text{ minutes}}{4 \text{ windows}} = 2.5 \text{ minutes per window}
\]

**Step 2: Calculate the total time to wash 64 windows.**

Now that we know it takes 2.5 minutes to wash one window, we can calculate the time it will take to wash 64 windows:

\[
\text{Total time for 64 windows} = 2.5 \text{ minutes per window} \times 64 \text{ windows}
\]

Perform the multiplication:

\[
2.5 \times 64 = 160
\]

**Conclusion:**

It will take David 160 minutes to wash all 64 windows. Therefore, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{160}
\]
