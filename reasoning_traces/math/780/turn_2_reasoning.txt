Question ID: 780
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to calculate the scores for both Ava and Emma based on the information provided. Let's define the variables for Emma's performance:

- Let \( e \) be the number of enemies Emma jumps on.
- Let \( b \) be the number of berries Emma collects.
- Let \( t \) be the time in seconds Emma has left on the timer when she finishes the level.

Now, we can express Ava's performance in terms of Emma's performance:

- Ava jumps on \( e + 8 \) enemies (8 more than Emma).
- Ava collects \( b + 3 \) berries (3 more than Emma).
- Ava finishes the level \( t - 4 \) seconds (4 seconds slower than Emma).

Next, we can calculate the scores for both players using the scoring system provided:

**Score Calculation:**

1. **Emma's Score:**
   \[
   \text{Score}_{\text{Emma}} = 10e + 5b + 30t
   \]

2. **Ava's Score:**
   \[
   \text{Score}_{\text{Ava}} = 10(e + 8) + 5(b + 3) + 30(t - 4)
   \]

   Now, let's expand Ava's score:
   \[
   \text{Score}_{\text{Ava}} = 10e + 80 + 5b + 15 + 30t - 120
   \]
   \[
   \text{Score}_{\text{Ava}} = 10e + 5b + 30t + 80 + 15 - 120
   \]
   \[
   \text{Score}_{\text{Ava}} = 10e + 5b + 30t - 25
   \]

Now we have both scores:
- Emma's Score: \( 10e + 5b + 30t \)
- Ava's Score: \( 10e + 5b + 30t - 25 \)

**Finding the Difference:**

To find the difference between Ava's score and Emma's score, we subtract Emma's score from Ava's score:
\[
\text{Difference} = \text{Score}_{\text{Ava}} - \text{Score}_{\text{Emma}}
\]
\[
\text{Difference} = (10e + 5b + 30t - 25) - (10e + 5b + 30t)
\]
\[
\text{Difference} = -25
\]

Thus, the difference between Ava's score and Emma's score is \(-25\).

**Final Answer:**
The difference between their two scores is \( \boxed{-25} \). This means Ava scored 25 points less than Emma.
