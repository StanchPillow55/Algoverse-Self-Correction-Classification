==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to calculate the scores for both Ava and Emma based on the information given.

Let's define the variables for Emma's performance:
- Let \( e \) be the number of enemies Emma jumps on.
- Let \( b \) be the number of berries Emma collects.
- Let \( t \) be the time in seconds Emma has left on the timer when she finishes the level.

Now, we can express Ava's performance in terms of Emma's performance:
- Ava jumps on \( e + 8 \) enemies (8 more than Emma).
- Ava collects \( b + 3 \) berries (3 more than Emma).
- Ava finishes the level 4 seconds slower, so she has \( t - 4 \) seconds left on the timer.

Next, we can calculate the scores for both players using the scoring system:
- The score formula is given by:
  \[
  \text{Score} = 10 \times (\text{number of enemies jumped on}) + 5 \times (\text{number of berries collected}) + 30 \times (\text{seconds left})
  \]

### Step 1: Calculate Emma's Score
Using the score formula for Emma:
\[
\text{Score}_{\text{Emma}} = 10e + 5b + 30t
\]

### Step 2: Calculate Ava's Score
Using the score formula for Ava:
\[
\text{Score}_{\text{Ava}} = 10(e + 8) + 5(b + 3) + 30(t - 4)
\]

Now, we can expand Ava's score:
\[
\text{Score}_{\text{Ava}} = 10e + 80 + 5b + 15 + 30t - 120
\]
Combining like terms:
\[
\text{Score}_{\text{Ava}} = 10e + 5b + 30t + 80 + 15 - 120
\]
\[
\text{Score}_{\text{Ava}} = 10e + 5b + 30t - 25
\]

### Step 3: Find the Difference Between Their Scores
Now we need to find the difference between Ava's score and Emma's score:
\[
\text{Difference} = \text{Score}_{\text{Ava}} - \text{Score}_{\text{Emma}}
\]
Substituting the scores we calculated:
\[
\text{Difference} = (10e + 5b + 30t - 25) - (10e + 5b + 30t)
\]
Simplifying this expression:
\[
\text{Difference} = -25
\]

### Final Answer
The difference between Ava's score and Emma's score is \(-25\). This means Ava's score is 25 points lower than Emma's score.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\text{The difference between their two scores is } 25 \text{ points, with Emma winning.}
\]
