Question ID: 780
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to calculate the scores for both Ava and Emma based on the information given. We will define variables for Emma's performance and then express Ava's performance in terms of those variables.

Let:
- \( e \) = number of enemies Emma jumps on
- \( b \) = number of berries Emma collects
- \( t \) = time in seconds Emma has left on the timer when she finishes the level

From the problem statement, we know the following about Ava:
- Ava jumps on 8 more enemies than Emma: \( e + 8 \)
- Ava collects 3 more berries than Emma: \( b + 3 \)
- Ava finishes the level 4 seconds slower than Emma: \( t - 4 \)

Now, we can calculate the scores for both players.

### Score Calculation

**Emma's Score:**
\[
\text{Score}_{\text{Emma}} = (10 \times e) + (5 \times b) + (30 \times t)
\]

**Ava's Score:**
\[
\text{Score}_{\text{Ava}} = (10 \times (e + 8)) + (5 \times (b + 3)) + (30 \times (t - 4))
\]

Now, let's expand Ava's score:
\[
\text{Score}_{\text{Ava}} = (10e + 80) + (5b + 15) + (30t - 120)
\]
Combining like terms:
\[
\text{Score}_{\text{Ava}} = 10e + 5b + 30t + 80 + 15 - 120
\]
\[
\text{Score}_{\text{Ava}} = 10e + 5b + 30t - 25
\]

### Finding the Difference in Scores

Now, we need to find the difference between Ava's score and Emma's score:
\[
\text{Difference} = \text{Score}_{\text{Ava}} - \text{Score}_{\text{Emma}}
\]
Substituting the scores we calculated:
\[
\text{Difference} = (10e + 5b + 30t - 25) - (10e + 5b + 30t)
\]

When we simplify this, we see that the terms \( 10e \), \( 5b \), and \( 30t \) cancel out:
\[
\text{Difference} = -25
\]

### Final Answer

The difference between Ava's score and Emma's score is:
\[
\boxed{-25}
\]

This means Ava's score is 25 points lower than Emma's score.
