==================================================

To solve the problem, we first need to understand what "Sample math problem 140" refers to. Since no specific problem is provided, I'll assume a generic math problem and solve it step by step. Let's consider a typical algebra problem:

**Problem:**
Solve for \( x \) in the equation: 
\[ 2x + 5 = 15 \]

**Step-by-step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Equation:**
   The equation \( 2x + 5 = 15 \) is a linear equation in one variable, \( x \). Our goal is to isolate \( x \) on one side of the equation.

2. **Isolate the Term with \( x \):**
   To isolate the term with \( x \), we need to eliminate the constant term on the left side of the equation. We do this by subtracting 5 from both sides:
   \[
   2x + 5 - 5 = 15 - 5
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   2x = 10
   \]

3. **Solve for \( x \):**
   Now, we need to solve for \( x \) by getting rid of the coefficient of \( x \), which is 2. We do this by dividing both sides of the equation by 2:
   \[
   \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{10}{2}
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   x = 5
   \]

4. **Verify the Solution:**
   To ensure our solution is correct, we substitute \( x = 5 \) back into the original equation:
   \[
   2(5) + 5 = 15
   \]
   Simplifying the left side gives:
   \[
   10 + 5 = 15
   \]
   Since both sides of the equation are equal, our solution is verified.

**Final Answer:**
The solution to the equation \( 2x + 5 = 15 \) is \( x = 5 \).
