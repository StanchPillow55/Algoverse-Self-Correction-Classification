==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample math problem 140" refers to. Since the problem itself is not provided, I'll assume it's a generic math problem that involves basic arithmetic or algebra. Let's create a sample problem and solve it step by step.

**Sample Math Problem 140:**

Solve for \( x \) in the equation:
\[ 3x + 5 = 20 \]

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Equation:**
   The equation given is a linear equation in one variable, \( x \). Our goal is to isolate \( x \) on one side of the equation to find its value.

2. **Subtract 5 from Both Sides:**
   To isolate the term with \( x \), we first need to eliminate the constant term on the left side of the equation. We do this by subtracting 5 from both sides.
   \[
   3x + 5 - 5 = 20 - 5
   \]
   Simplifying both sides, we get:
   \[
   3x = 15
   \]

3. **Divide Both Sides by 3:**
   Now, we need to solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides of the equation by 3, which is the coefficient of \( x \).
   \[
   \frac{3x}{3} = \frac{15}{3}
   \]
   Simplifying both sides, we get:
   \[
   x = 5
   \]

4. **Verify the Solution:**
   To ensure our solution is correct, we substitute \( x = 5 \) back into the original equation and check if both sides are equal.
   \[
   3(5) + 5 = 20
   \]
   Simplifying the left side, we have:
   \[
   15 + 5 = 20
   \]
   \[
   20 = 20
   \]
   Since both sides are equal, our solution is verified.

**Final Answer:**
The solution to the equation \( 3x + 5 = 20 \) is \( x = 5 \).
