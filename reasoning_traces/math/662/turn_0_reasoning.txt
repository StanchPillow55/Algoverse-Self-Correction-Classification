==================================================

To determine how much the apple pie cost, we first need to calculate the total amount Gus spent on the items he purchased at the grocery store, excluding the apple pie.

1. **Calculate the cost of the chips:**
   - Gus bought 2 bags of chips, each costing $2.00.
   - Total cost for chips = Number of bags Ã— Cost per bag
   \[
   \text{Total cost for chips} = 2 \times 2.00 = 4.00
   \]

2. **Cost of the bucket of fried chicken:**
   - The bucket of fried chicken costs $8.00.
   \[
   \text{Cost of fried chicken} = 8.00
   \]

3. **Cost of the bottle of soda:**
   - The bottle of soda costs $1.00.
   \[
   \text{Cost of soda} = 1.00
   \]

4. **Calculate the total cost of the items purchased (excluding the apple pie):**
   - Now, we add the costs of the chips, fried chicken, and soda.
   \[
   \text{Total cost of items} = \text{Cost of chips} + \text{Cost of fried chicken} + \text{Cost of soda}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total cost of items} = 4.00 + 8.00 + 1.00 = 13.00
   \]

5. **Determine the cost of the apple pie:**
   - Gus spent a total of $20.00 at the grocery store. To find the cost of the apple pie, we subtract the total cost of the other items from the total amount spent.
   \[
   \text{Cost of apple pie} = \text{Total amount spent} - \text{Total cost of items}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Cost of apple pie} = 20.00 - 13.00 = 7.00
   \]

Thus, the cost of the apple pie is **$7.00**.

Final answer: **$7.00**
