Question ID: 375
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To find the wholesale price of the pants, we need to understand the relationship between the wholesale price and the retail price. The store owner adds 80% to the wholesale price to determine the retail price. This means that the retail price is 180% of the wholesale price.

Let's denote the wholesale price as \( W \).

According to the problem, the retail price is 180% of the wholesale price. We can express this relationship with the equation:

\[
1.80 \times W = 36
\]

To find \( W \), we need to solve for it by dividing both sides of the equation by 1.80:

\[
W = \frac{36}{1.80}
\]

Now, let's perform the division:

\[
W = 20
\]

Thus, the wholesale price of the pants is $20.

Final Answer: The wholesale price is $20.
