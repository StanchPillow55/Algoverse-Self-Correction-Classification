To solve this problem, we need to determine the wholesale price of the pants given that the retail price is $36 and the store owner adds 80% to the wholesale price to set the retail price.

Let's denote the wholesale price as \( W \).

According to the problem, the retail price is 80% more than the wholesale price. This can be expressed mathematically as:

\[
\text{Retail Price} = W + 0.8W
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
\text{Retail Price} = 1.8W
\]

We know the retail price is $36, so we can set up the equation:

\[
1.8W = 36
\]

To find the wholesale price \( W \), we need to solve this equation for \( W \). We do this by dividing both sides of the equation by 1.8:

\[
W = \frac{36}{1.8}
\]

Now, let's perform the division:

\[
W = 20
\]

Thus, the wholesale price of the pants is $20.

To verify, we can check our work by calculating the retail price using the wholesale price we found:

1. Calculate 80% of the wholesale price: \( 0.8 \times 20 = 16 \).
2. Add this to the wholesale price to find the retail price: \( 20 + 16 = 36 \).

The calculated retail price matches the given retail price, confirming our solution is correct.

Therefore, the wholesale price of the pants is \(\boxed{20}\) dollars.
