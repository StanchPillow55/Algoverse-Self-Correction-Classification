To find the wholesale price of the pants, we need to understand the relationship between the wholesale price and the retail price given the markup percentage.

1. **Define Variables**:
   - Let \( W \) be the wholesale price.
   - The store owner adds 80% to the wholesale price to set the retail price.

2. **Set Up the Equation**:
   The retail price \( R \) can be expressed in terms of the wholesale price \( W \) as follows:
   \[
   R = W + 0.80W
   \]
   This can be simplified to:
   \[
   R = 1.80W
   \]

3. **Substitute the Known Retail Price**:
   We know that the retail price \( R \) is $36. Therefore, we can substitute this value into the equation:
   \[
   36 = 1.80W
   \]

4. **Solve for the Wholesale Price \( W \)**:
   To isolate \( W \), we divide both sides of the equation by 1.80:
   \[
   W = \frac{36}{1.80}
   \]

5. **Perform the Calculation**:
   Now we calculate \( \frac{36}{1.80} \):
   \[
   W = \frac{36}{1.80} = 20
   \]

6. **Conclusion**:
   The wholesale price of the pants is \( W = 20 \).

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{20}
\]
