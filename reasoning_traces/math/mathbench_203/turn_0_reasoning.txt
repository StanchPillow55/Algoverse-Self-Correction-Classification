==================================================

To solve "Sample math problem 203," we first need to understand what the problem is asking. However, the problem statement is incomplete as it only mentions "Sample math problem 203" without any specific details or context. 

To proceed, let's assume a hypothetical math problem labeled as "Sample math problem 203" and solve it step by step. Let's assume the problem is as follows:

**Problem Statement:**
Calculate the sum of the first 203 positive integers.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   We need to find the sum of the first 203 positive integers. This is a classic problem that can be solved using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series.

2. **Identify the Formula:**
   The sum \( S \) of the first \( n \) positive integers is given by the formula:
   \[
   S = \frac{n(n + 1)}{2}
   \]
   where \( n \) is the number of terms.

3. **Substitute the Values:**
   In this problem, \( n = 203 \). Substitute 203 into the formula:
   \[
   S = \frac{203(203 + 1)}{2}
   \]

4. **Calculate Inside the Parentheses:**
   First, calculate \( 203 + 1 \):
   \[
   203 + 1 = 204
   \]

5. **Multiply the Terms:**
   Next, calculate \( 203 \times 204 \):
   \[
   203 \times 204 = 41412
   \]

6. **Divide by 2:**
   Finally, divide the product by 2 to find the sum:
   \[
   S = \frac{41412}{2} = 20706
   \]

7. **Conclusion:**
   The sum of the first 203 positive integers is 20,706.

**Final Answer:**
The sum of the first 203 positive integers is 20,706.
