==================================================

To solve the problem effectively, I need to first understand what "Sample math problem 203" refers to. Since I don't have access to external databases or specific problem sets, I'll assume this is a placeholder for a typical math problem. Without specific details, I'll create a hypothetical math problem and solve it step by step.

Let's assume "Sample math problem 203" is a problem involving algebra, specifically solving a quadratic equation. Here's a sample problem:

**Problem:**
Solve the quadratic equation \(2x^2 - 4x - 6 = 0\).

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Identify the quadratic equation:**
   The given equation is \(2x^2 - 4x - 6 = 0\).

2. **Simplify the equation if possible:**
   Check if the equation can be simplified by dividing all terms by a common factor. In this case, all coefficients are divisible by 2:
   \[
   \frac{2x^2}{2} - \frac{4x}{2} - \frac{6}{2} = 0 \implies x^2 - 2x - 3 = 0
   \]

3. **Factor the quadratic equation:**
   Look for two numbers that multiply to \(-3\) (the constant term) and add to \(-2\) (the coefficient of the linear term). These numbers are \(-3\) and \(1\).
   \[
   x^2 - 2x - 3 = (x - 3)(x + 1) = 0
   \]

4. **Solve for \(x\) using the factored form:**
   Set each factor equal to zero and solve for \(x\):
   \[
   x - 3 = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad x + 1 = 0
   \]
   \[
   x = 3 \quad \text{or} \quad x = -1
   \]

5. **Verify the solutions:**
   Substitute \(x = 3\) and \(x = -1\) back into the original equation to ensure they satisfy it.

   For \(x = 3\):
   \[
   2(3)^2 - 4(3) - 6 = 18 - 12 - 6 = 0
   \]

   For \(x = -1\):
   \[
   2(-1)^2 - 4(-1) - 6 = 2 + 4 - 6 = 0
   \]

   Both solutions satisfy the original equation.

**Final Answer:**
The solutions to the quadratic equation \(2x^2 - 4x - 6 = 0\) are \(x = 3\) and \(x = -1\).
