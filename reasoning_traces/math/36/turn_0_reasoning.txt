==================================================

To determine how much Terry spends on yogurt over 30 days, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of yogurts Terry eats in 30 days.**
   - Terry eats 2 yogurts a day.
   - Over 30 days, the total number of yogurts he eats is:
     \[
     \text{Total yogurts} = \text{Yogurts per day} \times \text{Number of days} = 2 \, \text{yogurts/day} \times 30 \, \text{days} = 60 \, \text{yogurts}
     \]

2. **Determine how many packs of yogurts Terry needs to buy.**
   - The yogurts are sold in packs of 4.
   - To find out how many packs Terry needs, we divide the total number of yogurts by the number of yogurts per pack:
     \[
     \text{Number of packs} = \frac{\text{Total yogurts}}{\text{Yogurts per pack}} = \frac{60 \, \text{yogurts}}{4 \, \text{yogurts/pack}} = 15 \, \text{packs}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total cost for the packs of yogurts.**
   - Each pack costs $5.00.
   - Therefore, the total cost for 15 packs is:
     \[
     \text{Total cost} = \text{Number of packs} \times \text{Cost per pack} = 15 \, \text{packs} \times 5.00 \, \text{dollars/pack} = 75.00 \, \text{dollars}
     \]

4. **State the final answer.**
   - Terry spends a total of $75.00 on yogurt over 30 days.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{75.00}
\]
