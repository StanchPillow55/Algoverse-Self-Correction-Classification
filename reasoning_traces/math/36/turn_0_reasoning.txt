Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step.

1. **Identify the total amount earned**: 
   The total amount earned by Lisa, Jack, and Tommy is $60.

2. **Determine how much Lisa earned**:
   According to the problem, half of the $60 was earned by Lisa. 
   \[
   \text{Amount earned by Lisa} = \frac{60}{2} = 30
   \]

3. **Determine how much Tommy earned**:
   The problem states that Tommy earned half of what Lisa earned. Since we found that Lisa earned $30, we can calculate Tommy's earnings as follows:
   \[
   \text{Amount earned by Tommy} = \frac{30}{2} = 15
   \]

4. **Calculate how much more money Lisa earned than Tommy**:
   To find out how much more Lisa earned than Tommy, we subtract Tommy's earnings from Lisa's earnings:
   \[
   \text{Difference} = \text{Amount earned by Lisa} - \text{Amount earned by Tommy} = 30 - 15 = 15
   \]

5. **Final answer**:
   Lisa earned $15 more than Tommy.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{15}
\]
