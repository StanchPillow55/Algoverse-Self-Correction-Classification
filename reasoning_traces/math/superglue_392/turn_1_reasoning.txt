==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 392" refers to. However, without specific details or context about what "Sample reasoning question 392" entails, I will demonstrate a general approach to solving a math problem by creating a hypothetical problem and solving it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**

Let's assume "Sample reasoning question 392" is a math problem involving algebraic equations. Here's a sample problem:

**Problem:** Solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 3x + 5 = 20 \).

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   The equation given is \( 3x + 5 = 20 \). We need to find the value of \( x \) that makes this equation true.

2. **Isolate the Variable:**
   To solve for \( x \), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We can start by eliminating the constant term on the left side.

   \[
   3x + 5 = 20
   \]

   Subtract 5 from both sides to get:

   \[
   3x + 5 - 5 = 20 - 5
   \]

   Simplifying both sides gives:

   \[
   3x = 15
   \]

3. **Solve for \( x \):**
   Now, divide both sides by 3 to solve for \( x \).

   \[
   \frac{3x}{3} = \frac{15}{3}
   \]

   Simplifying both sides gives:

   \[
   x = 5
   \]

4. **Verify the Solution:**
   Substitute \( x = 5 \) back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies the equation.

   \[
   3(5) + 5 = 20
   \]

   Simplifying the left side gives:

   \[
   15 + 5 = 20
   \]

   \[
   20 = 20
   \]

   Since both sides of the equation are equal, our solution \( x = 5 \) is correct.

**Final Answer:**

The solution to the equation \( 3x + 5 = 20 \) is \( x = 5 \).

This approach demonstrates how to solve a basic algebraic equation by isolating the variable and verifying the solution. If "Sample reasoning question 392" refers to a different type of problem, please provide more details or context for a specific solution.
