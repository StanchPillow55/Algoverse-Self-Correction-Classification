==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 392" entails. Since the question itself is not specified, I'll create a hypothetical math problem and solve it step by step.

Let's assume the problem is as follows:

**Problem:**
A rectangle has a length that is 3 times its width. If the perimeter of the rectangle is 392 units, what are the dimensions of the rectangle?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We have a rectangle with a length (L) and a width (W).
   - The length is 3 times the width: \( L = 3W \).
   - The perimeter of the rectangle is 392 units.

2. **Recall the Formula for Perimeter:**
   - The perimeter (P) of a rectangle is given by the formula:
     \[
     P = 2L + 2W
     \]

3. **Substitute the Known Values:**
   - We know the perimeter is 392, so:
     \[
     2L + 2W = 392
     \]

4. **Substitute the Expression for L:**
   - Since \( L = 3W \), substitute \( L \) in the perimeter equation:
     \[
     2(3W) + 2W = 392
     \]

5. **Simplify the Equation:**
   - Simplify the left side:
     \[
     6W + 2W = 392
     \]
   - Combine like terms:
     \[
     8W = 392
     \]

6. **Solve for W:**
   - Divide both sides by 8 to solve for W:
     \[
     W = \frac{392}{8} = 49
     \]

7. **Find the Length L:**
   - Since \( L = 3W \), substitute the value of W:
     \[
     L = 3 \times 49 = 147
     \]

8. **Verify the Solution:**
   - Check the perimeter with the found dimensions:
     \[
     2L + 2W = 2(147) + 2(49) = 294 + 98 = 392
     \]
   - The calculated perimeter matches the given perimeter, confirming our solution is correct.

**Final Answer:**
The dimensions of the rectangle are:
- Width (W) = 49 units
- Length (L) = 147 units
