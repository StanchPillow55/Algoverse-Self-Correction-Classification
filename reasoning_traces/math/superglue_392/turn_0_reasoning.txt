==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 392" refers to. Since the problem is not explicitly stated, I'll assume it is a placeholder for a typical math problem. Let's create a sample math problem and solve it step by step.

**Sample Problem:**
A farmer has a rectangular field that is 50 meters long and 30 meters wide. He wants to build a fence around the field and also divide the field into two equal parts with a fence parallel to the shorter side. Calculate the total length of the fence required.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We have a rectangular field.
   - Dimensions of the field: Length = 50 meters, Width = 30 meters.
   - We need to fence the perimeter and also add a fence to divide the field into two equal parts parallel to the shorter side.

2. **Calculate the Perimeter of the Field:**
   - The perimeter \( P \) of a rectangle is given by the formula:
     \[
     P = 2 \times (\text{Length} + \text{Width})
     \]
   - Substitute the given dimensions:
     \[
     P = 2 \times (50 + 30) = 2 \times 80 = 160 \text{ meters}
     \]

3. **Calculate the Additional Fence Needed for Division:**
   - The field is divided into two equal parts with a fence parallel to the shorter side (width).
   - This means the additional fence will be along the length of the field.
   - Therefore, the length of the additional fence is equal to the length of the field, which is 50 meters.

4. **Calculate the Total Length of the Fence:**
   - Total length of the fence required is the sum of the perimeter and the additional fence:
     \[
     \text{Total Fence Length} = \text{Perimeter} + \text{Additional Fence}
     \]
   - Substitute the calculated values:
     \[
     \text{Total Fence Length} = 160 + 50 = 210 \text{ meters}
     \]

**Final Answer:**
The total length of the fence required is 210 meters.
