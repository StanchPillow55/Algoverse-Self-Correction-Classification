To find out how tall the beanstalk was after 3 weeks, we will break down the growth of the beanstalk week by week.

1. **First Week**: 
   - At the end of the first week, the beanstalk is 3 inches tall.
   - Height after week 1: **3 inches**

2. **Second Week**: 
   - The beanstalk doubles in height during the second week. 
   - To find the new height, we multiply the height at the end of the first week by 2:
     \[
     \text{Height after week 2} = 3 \text{ inches} \times 2 = 6 \text{ inches}
     \]

3. **Third Week**: 
   - In the third week, the beanstalk grows an additional 4 inches.
   - To find the height at the end of the third week, we add 4 inches to the height at the end of the second week:
     \[
     \text{Height after week 3} = 6 \text{ inches} + 4 \text{ inches} = 10 \text{ inches}
     \]

Now, we can summarize the growth of the beanstalk over the three weeks:
- After the first week: 3 inches
- After the second week: 6 inches
- After the third week: 10 inches

Thus, the final height of the beanstalk after 3 weeks is **10 inches**.

Final answer: **10 inches**.
