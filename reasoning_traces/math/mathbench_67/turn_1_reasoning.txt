Question ID: mathbench_67
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we first need to understand what "Sample math problem 67" refers to. Since the problem isn't explicitly stated, I'll assume a generic math problem involving the number 67. Let's create a problem involving basic arithmetic operations with the number 67 and solve it step by step.

**Problem:**  
Calculate the result of the following expression:  
\[ 67 \times 3 + 45 - 67 \div 2 \]

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Multiplication:**  
   First, we perform the multiplication operation in the expression:  
   \[ 67 \times 3 = 201 \]

2. **Division:**  
   Next, we perform the division operation:  
   \[ 67 \div 2 = 33.5 \]

3. **Substitute the results back into the expression:**  
   Now, substitute the results of the multiplication and division back into the expression:  
   \[ 201 + 45 - 33.5 \]

4. **Addition:**  
   Perform the addition operation:  
   \[ 201 + 45 = 246 \]

5. **Subtraction:**  
   Finally, perform the subtraction operation:  
   \[ 246 - 33.5 = 212.5 \]

**Final Answer:**  
The result of the expression \( 67 \times 3 + 45 - 67 \div 2 \) is \( 212.5 \).

This solution demonstrates the step-by-step process of solving a mathematical expression involving basic arithmetic operations. If "Sample math problem 67" refers to a specific problem, please provide more details for an accurate solution.
