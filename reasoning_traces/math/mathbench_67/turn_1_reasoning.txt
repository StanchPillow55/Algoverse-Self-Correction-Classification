==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 67," we first need to understand what the problem is asking. However, since "Sample math problem 67" is not a specific problem statement, I'll create a hypothetical math problem and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**

"Calculate the sum of all even numbers between 1 and 67."

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Identify the Even Numbers:**
   - Even numbers are integers divisible by 2. Between 1 and 67, the even numbers start from 2 and go up to 66.

2. **List the Even Numbers:**
   - The even numbers between 1 and 67 are: 2, 4, 6, ..., 66.

3. **Determine the Sequence:**
   - This is an arithmetic sequence where the first term \( a_1 = 2 \), the common difference \( d = 2 \), and the last term \( a_n = 66 \).

4. **Find the Number of Terms (n):**
   - The formula for the nth term of an arithmetic sequence is:
     \[
     a_n = a_1 + (n-1) \cdot d
     \]
   - Plugging in the known values:
     \[
     66 = 2 + (n-1) \cdot 2
     \]
     \[
     66 = 2 + 2n - 2
     \]
     \[
     66 = 2n
     \]
     \[
     n = \frac{66}{2} = 33
     \]

5. **Calculate the Sum of the Sequence:**
   - The sum \( S_n \) of the first \( n \) terms of an arithmetic sequence is given by:
     \[
     S_n = \frac{n}{2} \cdot (a_1 + a_n)
     \]
   - Substituting the known values:
     \[
     S_{33} = \frac{33}{2} \cdot (2 + 66)
     \]
     \[
     S_{33} = \frac{33}{2} \cdot 68
     \]
     \[
     S_{33} = 33 \cdot 34
     \]
     \[
     S_{33} = 1122
     \]

**Final Answer:**

The sum of all even numbers between 1 and 67 is 1122.
