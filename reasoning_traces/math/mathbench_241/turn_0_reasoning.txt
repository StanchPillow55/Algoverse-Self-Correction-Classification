==================================================

To solve the problem, we first need to understand what "Sample math problem 241" refers to. Since I don't have access to external databases or specific problem sets, I'll assume this is a generic math problem and create a sample problem to solve.

Let's assume "Sample math problem 241" is the following:

**Problem:**
Solve for \( x \) in the equation:
\[ 3x + 5 = 2x + 11 \]

**Step-by-step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Equation:**
   The equation given is a linear equation in one variable, \( x \). Our goal is to find the value of \( x \) that makes this equation true.

2. **Isolate the Variable:**
   To solve for \( x \), we need to get all terms involving \( x \) on one side of the equation and constant terms on the other side.

   Start by subtracting \( 2x \) from both sides of the equation to move the \( x \)-terms to one side:
   \[
   3x + 5 - 2x = 2x + 11 - 2x
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   x + 5 = 11
   \]

3. **Solve for \( x \):**
   Next, subtract 5 from both sides to isolate \( x \):
   \[
   x + 5 - 5 = 11 - 5
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   x = 6
   \]

4. **Verify the Solution:**
   Substitute \( x = 6 \) back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies the equation:
   \[
   3(6) + 5 = 2(6) + 11
   \]
   Calculate both sides:
   \[
   18 + 5 = 12 + 11
   \]
   \[
   23 = 23
   \]
   Since both sides are equal, our solution \( x = 6 \) is verified.

**Final Answer:**
The solution to the equation \( 3x + 5 = 2x + 11 \) is \( x = 6 \).
