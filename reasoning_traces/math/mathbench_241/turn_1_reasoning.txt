==================================================

To solve the sample math problem 241, we need to first understand what the problem is asking. However, since "Sample math problem 241" is not a specific problem statement, I'll create a hypothetical math problem for demonstration purposes. Let's assume the problem is as follows:

**Problem:**
Calculate the sum of all even numbers between 1 and 241.

**Solution:**

1. **Identify the Even Numbers:**
   Even numbers are integers divisible by 2. The even numbers between 1 and 241 start from 2 and go up to 240.

2. **Sequence of Even Numbers:**
   The sequence of even numbers can be represented as: 2, 4, 6, ..., 240.

3. **Determine the Number of Terms:**
   This sequence is an arithmetic sequence where the first term \( a_1 = 2 \) and the common difference \( d = 2 \).

   To find the number of terms \( n \), we use the formula for the \( n \)-th term of an arithmetic sequence:
   \[
   a_n = a_1 + (n-1) \cdot d
   \]
   Setting \( a_n = 240 \), we solve for \( n \):
   \[
   240 = 2 + (n-1) \cdot 2
   \]
   \[
   240 = 2 + 2n - 2
   \]
   \[
   240 = 2n
   \]
   \[
   n = \frac{240}{2} = 120
   \]

4. **Sum of the Arithmetic Sequence:**
   The sum \( S_n \) of the first \( n \) terms of an arithmetic sequence is given by:
   \[
   S_n = \frac{n}{2} \cdot (a_1 + a_n)
   \]
   Substituting the known values:
   \[
   S_{120} = \frac{120}{2} \cdot (2 + 240)
   \]
   \[
   S_{120} = 60 \cdot 242
   \]

5. **Calculate the Sum:**
   \[
   S_{120} = 60 \cdot 242
   \]
   To simplify the multiplication:
   \[
   60 \cdot 242 = 60 \cdot (240 + 2) = 60 \cdot 240 + 60 \cdot 2
   \]
   \[
   60 \cdot 240 = 14400
   \]
   \[
   60 \cdot 2 = 120
   \]
   \[
   S_{120} = 14400 + 120 = 14520
   \]

**Final Answer:**
The sum of all even numbers between 1 and 241 is 14,520.
