==================================================

To solve the problem, we first need to understand what "Sample math problem 241" refers to. Since the problem itself isn't provided, I'll create a sample math problem that we can solve step by step. Let's assume "Sample math problem 241" is a problem involving solving a quadratic equation. Here's a possible problem:

**Problem:**
Solve the quadratic equation \(2x^2 - 4x - 6 = 0\).

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Identify the quadratic equation:**
   The given equation is \(2x^2 - 4x - 6 = 0\).

2. **Simplify the equation:**
   First, check if the equation can be simplified by dividing all terms by a common factor. In this case, all terms are divisible by 2:
   \[
   \frac{2x^2}{2} - \frac{4x}{2} - \frac{6}{2} = 0
   \]
   This simplifies to:
   \[
   x^2 - 2x - 3 = 0
   \]

3. **Factor the quadratic equation:**
   We need to factor the quadratic equation \(x^2 - 2x - 3 = 0\). We look for two numbers that multiply to \(-3\) (the constant term) and add to \(-2\) (the coefficient of the linear term).

   The numbers \(-3\) and \(1\) satisfy these conditions because:
   \[
   (-3) \times 1 = -3
   \]
   \[
   (-3) + 1 = -2
   \]

   Therefore, the equation can be factored as:
   \[
   (x - 3)(x + 1) = 0
   \]

4. **Solve for \(x\):**
   Set each factor equal to zero and solve for \(x\):
   \[
   x - 3 = 0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad x = 3
   \]
   \[
   x + 1 = 0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad x = -1
   \]

5. **Verify the solutions:**
   Substitute \(x = 3\) and \(x = -1\) back into the original equation to verify:

   For \(x = 3\):
   \[
   2(3)^2 - 4(3) - 6 = 18 - 12 - 6 = 0
   \]

   For \(x = -1\):
   \[
   2(-1)^2 - 4(-1) - 6 = 2 + 4 - 6 = 0
   \]

   Both solutions satisfy the original equation.

**Final Answer:**
The solutions to the quadratic equation \(2x^2 - 4x - 6 = 0\) are \(x = 3\) and \(x = -1\).
