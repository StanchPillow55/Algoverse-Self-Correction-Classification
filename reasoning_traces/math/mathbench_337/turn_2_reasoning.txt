Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 337," we first need to understand what the problem is asking. However, the phrase "Sample math problem 337" does not provide specific details about the problem itself. It seems to be a placeholder or a reference to a specific problem that is not fully described here.

To proceed, let's assume that "Sample math problem 337" refers to a generic math problem. Since no specific details are provided, I will create a hypothetical math problem and solve it step by step. Let's assume the problem involves solving a quadratic equation, which is a common type of math problem.

### Hypothetical Problem:
Solve the quadratic equation: \(2x^2 - 4x - 6 = 0\).

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Identify the coefficients:**
   The given quadratic equation is in the standard form \(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\), where:
   - \(a = 2\)
   - \(b = -4\)
   - \(c = -6\)

2. **Calculate the discriminant:**
   The discriminant (\(\Delta\)) of a quadratic equation \(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\) is given by:
   \[
   \Delta = b^2 - 4ac
   \]
   Substituting the values of \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\):
   \[
   \Delta = (-4)^2 - 4 \times 2 \times (-6) = 16 + 48 = 64
   \]

3. **Determine the nature of the roots:**
   Since the discriminant \(\Delta = 64\) is positive, the quadratic equation has two distinct real roots.

4. **Use the quadratic formula to find the roots:**
   The quadratic formula is:
   \[
   x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{\Delta}}{2a}
   \]
   Substituting the values of \(b\), \(\Delta\), and \(a\):
   \[
   x = \frac{-(-4) \pm \sqrt{64}}{2 \times 2} = \frac{4 \pm 8}{4}
   \]

5. **Calculate the two roots:**
   - First root:
     \[
     x_1 = \frac{4 + 8}{4} = \frac{12}{4} = 3
     \]
   - Second root:
     \[
     x_2 = \frac{4 - 8}{4} = \frac{-4}{4} = -1
     \]

### Final Answer:
The solutions to the quadratic equation \(2x^2 - 4x - 6 = 0\) are \(x = 3\) and \(x = -1\).

This hypothetical problem demonstrates how to solve a quadratic equation using the quadratic formula. If you have a specific "Sample math problem 337" in mind, please provide the details, and I will be happy to solve it for you.
