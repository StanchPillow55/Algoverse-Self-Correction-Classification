Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 337," we need to first understand what the problem is asking. However, the problem statement provided is incomplete or unclear. Since "Sample math problem 337" does not specify any details, I will assume this is a placeholder and create a hypothetical math problem to solve.

Let's assume "Sample math problem 337" is a typical algebra problem. Here's a possible problem and its solution:

**Problem:**
Solve for \( x \) in the equation:
\[ 3x + 5 = 20 \]

**Solution:**

Step 1: Understand the equation.
The equation \( 3x + 5 = 20 \) is a linear equation in one variable. Our goal is to solve for \( x \).

Step 2: Isolate the variable term.
To isolate the term with \( x \), we need to get rid of the constant term on the left side of the equation. We do this by subtracting 5 from both sides:
\[ 3x + 5 - 5 = 20 - 5 \]
\[ 3x = 15 \]

Step 3: Solve for \( x \).
Now, we need to solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides of the equation by 3:
\[ \frac{3x}{3} = \frac{15}{3} \]
\[ x = 5 \]

Step 4: Verify the solution.
To ensure our solution is correct, we can substitute \( x = 5 \) back into the original equation:
\[ 3(5) + 5 = 20 \]
\[ 15 + 5 = 20 \]
\[ 20 = 20 \]

The left side equals the right side, confirming that our solution is correct.

**Final Answer:**
The solution to the equation \( 3x + 5 = 20 \) is \( x = 5 \).
