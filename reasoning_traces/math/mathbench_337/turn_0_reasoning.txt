==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample math problem 337" refers to. Since the problem itself is not provided, I'll create a hypothetical math problem labeled as "Sample math problem 337" and solve it step by step.

**Sample Math Problem 337:**

"Find the value of \( x \) in the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \)."

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Equation:**
   The given equation is \( 2x + 3 = 11 \). This is a simple linear equation in one variable, \( x \).

2. **Isolate the Variable:**
   To solve for \( x \), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We start by eliminating the constant term on the left side of the equation.

   \[
   2x + 3 = 11
   \]

   Subtract 3 from both sides to remove the constant term from the left side:

   \[
   2x + 3 - 3 = 11 - 3
   \]

   Simplifying both sides gives:

   \[
   2x = 8
   \]

3. **Solve for \( x \):**
   Now, we need to solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides of the equation by the coefficient of \( x \), which is 2.

   \[
   \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{8}{2}
   \]

   Simplifying both sides gives:

   \[
   x = 4
   \]

4. **Verify the Solution:**
   To ensure our solution is correct, we substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation and check if both sides are equal.

   Substitute \( x = 4 \) into \( 2x + 3 = 11 \):

   \[
   2(4) + 3 = 11
   \]

   Simplify the left side:

   \[
   8 + 3 = 11
   \]

   Since both sides of the equation are equal, our solution is verified.

**Final Answer:**

The value of \( x \) is \( 4 \).
