==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample math problem 337" refers to. Since there is no specific problem statement provided, I will assume that this is a placeholder for a typical math problem. Let's create a sample math problem and solve it step by step.

**Sample Math Problem 337:**

**Problem:**
Solve the equation for \( x \):
\[ 3x + 5 = 20 \]

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Equation:**
   The equation given is a linear equation in one variable, \( x \). The goal is to find the value of \( x \) that makes the equation true.

2. **Isolate the Variable:**
   To solve for \( x \), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We start by eliminating the constant term on the left side of the equation.

   \[
   3x + 5 = 20
   \]

   Subtract 5 from both sides to remove the constant term from the left side:

   \[
   3x + 5 - 5 = 20 - 5
   \]

   Simplifying both sides gives:

   \[
   3x = 15
   \]

3. **Solve for \( x \):**
   Now, we need to solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides of the equation by the coefficient of \( x \), which is 3.

   \[
   \frac{3x}{3} = \frac{15}{3}
   \]

   Simplifying both sides gives:

   \[
   x = 5
   \]

4. **Verify the Solution:**
   To ensure that our solution is correct, we substitute \( x = 5 \) back into the original equation and check if both sides are equal.

   Original equation:

   \[
   3x + 5 = 20
   \]

   Substitute \( x = 5 \):

   \[
   3(5) + 5 = 20
   \]

   Calculate the left side:

   \[
   15 + 5 = 20
   \]

   Since both sides of the equation are equal, our solution is verified.

**Final Answer:**
The solution to the equation \( 3x + 5 = 20 \) is \( x = 5 \).
