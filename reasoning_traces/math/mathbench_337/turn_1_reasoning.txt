==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 337," we first need to understand what the problem is asking. However, the problem statement is not provided in your question. Assuming this is a placeholder for a specific math problem, I'll demonstrate a general approach to solving a typical math problem. Let's assume "Sample math problem 337" is a placeholder for a specific problem, such as solving a quadratic equation. I'll use a generic quadratic equation as an example:

**Example Problem:**
Solve the quadratic equation: \( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \).

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Identify the coefficients:**
   - The standard form of a quadratic equation is \( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \).
   - Identify the coefficients \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \).

2. **Check if the quadratic can be factored:**
   - Sometimes, the quadratic can be factored into two binomials. For example, if the equation is \( x^2 + 5x + 6 = 0 \), it can be factored as \( (x + 2)(x + 3) = 0 \).

3. **Use the quadratic formula if necessary:**
   - If the quadratic cannot be easily factored, use the quadratic formula:
     \[
     x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
     \]
   - This formula calculates the roots of the quadratic equation.

4. **Calculate the discriminant:**
   - The discriminant is \( b^2 - 4ac \).
   - It determines the nature of the roots:
     - If \( b^2 - 4ac > 0 \), there are two distinct real roots.
     - If \( b^2 - 4ac = 0 \), there is one real root (a repeated root).
     - If \( b^2 - 4ac < 0 \), there are two complex roots.

5. **Solve for the roots:**
   - Substitute the values of \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \) into the quadratic formula to find the roots.

**Example Calculation:**

Let's solve the equation \( 2x^2 + 4x - 6 = 0 \).

1. Identify coefficients: \( a = 2 \), \( b = 4 \), \( c = -6 \).

2. Calculate the discriminant:
   \[
   b^2 - 4ac = 4^2 - 4 \times 2 \times (-6) = 16 + 48 = 64
   \]

3. Since the discriminant is positive, there are two distinct real roots.

4. Use the quadratic formula:
   \[
   x = \frac{-4 \pm \sqrt{64}}{2 \times 2}
   \]
   \[
   x = \frac{-4 \pm 8}{4}
   \]

5. Calculate the roots:
   - First root: 
     \[
     x = \frac{-4 + 8}{4} = \frac{4}{4} = 1
     \]
   - Second root:
     \[
     x = \frac{-4 - 8}{4} = \frac{-12}{4} = -3
     \]

**Final Answer:**
The roots of the equation \( 2x^2 + 4x - 6 = 0 \) are \( x = 1 \) and \( x = -3 \).
