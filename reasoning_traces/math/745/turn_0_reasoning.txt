==================================================

To determine how much profit Mark made from buying and selling the magic cards, we will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total cost of the packs**:
   Mark buys 3 packs for $1800 each. Therefore, the total cost can be calculated as follows:

   \[
   \text{Total Cost} = \text{Number of Packs} \times \text{Cost per Pack} = 3 \times 1800 = 5400
   \]

2. **Calculate the total value of the cards he received**:
   Mark receives several cards with different values:
   - 1 card worth $4000
   - 1 card worth $1000
   - 30 cards worth an average of $50 each

   First, we calculate the total value of the 30 cards:

   \[
   \text{Total Value of 30 Cards} = \text{Number of Cards} \times \text{Average Value per Card} = 30 \times 50 = 1500
   \]

   Now, we can find the total value of all the cards:

   \[
   \text{Total Value of All Cards} = \text{Value of Card 1} + \text{Value of Card 2} + \text{Total Value of 30 Cards}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total Value of All Cards} = 4000 + 1000 + 1500 = 6500
   \]

3. **Calculate the profit**:
   Profit is calculated as the total value of the cards minus the total cost of the packs:

   \[
   \text{Profit} = \text{Total Value of All Cards} - \text{Total Cost}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Profit} = 6500 - 5400 = 1100
   \]

4. **Final answer**:
   Therefore, the total profit that Mark made from buying and selling the magic cards is:

   \[
   \boxed{1100}
   \]
