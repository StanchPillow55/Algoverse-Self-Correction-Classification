==================================================

To solve the problem, I need more specific information about "Sample math problem 82." Since the problem isn't provided, I'll demonstrate how to solve a generic math problem step by step. If you have a specific problem in mind, please provide the details.

Let's consider a sample math problem:

**Problem:** Solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).

**Step 1: Understand the Equation**

The equation given is a linear equation in one variable, \( x \). Our goal is to isolate \( x \) on one side of the equation to find its value.

**Step 2: Isolate the Variable**

To isolate \( x \), we need to perform operations that will leave \( x \) alone on one side of the equation.

1. **Subtract 3 from both sides**: This will help eliminate the constant term on the left side.
   \[
   2x + 3 - 3 = 11 - 3
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   2x = 8
   \]

2. **Divide both sides by 2**: This will solve for \( x \).
   \[
   \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{8}{2}
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   x = 4
   \]

**Step 3: Verify the Solution**

Substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies the equation:
\[
2(4) + 3 = 11
\]
Calculate the left side:
\[
8 + 3 = 11
\]
Since both sides of the equation are equal, our solution \( x = 4 \) is correct.

**Final Answer**

The solution to the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \) is \( x = 4 \).

If you have a specific problem labeled "Sample math problem 82," please provide the details, and I will solve it accordingly.
