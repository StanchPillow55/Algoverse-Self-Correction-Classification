Question ID: mathbench_356
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 356," we need to first understand what the problem is asking. However, the problem statement is incomplete as it only says "Sample math problem 356" without any specific details or context. Therefore, I will assume that "356" might refer to a number that we need to perform some mathematical operations on. 

Let's explore a few potential mathematical problems involving the number 356:

### Problem 1: Find the Prime Factorization of 356

**Step 1: Check divisibility by 2.**
- 356 is an even number, so it is divisible by 2.
- \( 356 \div 2 = 178 \)

**Step 2: Continue with 178.**
- 178 is also even, so it is divisible by 2.
- \( 178 \div 2 = 89 \)

**Step 3: Check 89 for primality.**
- 89 is not divisible by 2, 3, 5, or 7 (all primes less than \(\sqrt{89}\)).
- Therefore, 89 is a prime number.

**Conclusion:**
- The prime factorization of 356 is \( 2^2 \times 89 \).

### Problem 2: Calculate the Sum of the Digits of 356

**Step 1: Identify the digits.**
- The digits of 356 are 3, 5, and 6.

**Step 2: Calculate the sum.**
- \( 3 + 5 + 6 = 14 \)

**Conclusion:**
- The sum of the digits of 356 is 14.

### Problem 3: Convert 356 to Binary

**Step 1: Divide by 2 and record remainders.**
- \( 356 \div 2 = 178 \) remainder 0
- \( 178 \div 2 = 89 \) remainder 0
- \( 89 \div 2 = 44 \) remainder 1
- \( 44 \div 2 = 22 \) remainder 0
- \( 22 \div 2 = 11 \) remainder 0
- \( 11 \div 2 = 5 \) remainder 1
- \( 5 \div 2 = 2 \) remainder 1
- \( 2 \div 2 = 1 \) remainder 0
- \( 1 \div 2 = 0 \) remainder 1

**Step 2: Write the binary number.**
- Reading the remainders from bottom to top, 356 in binary is \( 101100100 \).

### Conclusion

Since the problem statement was not specific, I explored a few different mathematical problems involving the number 356. Here are the final answers for each:

1. **Prime Factorization:** \( 2^2 \times 89 \)
2. **Sum of Digits:** 14
3. **Binary Conversion:** \( 101100100 \)

If you have a specific problem or context in mind, please provide more details so I can address it accurately.
