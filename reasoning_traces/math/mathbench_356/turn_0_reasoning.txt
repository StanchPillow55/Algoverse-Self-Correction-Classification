==================================================

To solve the problem, we first need to understand what "Sample math problem 356" refers to. Since no specific problem is provided, I'll create a hypothetical math problem involving the number 356 and solve it step-by-step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**

Calculate the sum of the digits of the number 356, then multiply the result by 3. Finally, subtract 10 from the product and provide the final answer.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Identify the digits of the number 356:**
   - The number 356 consists of the digits 3, 5, and 6.

2. **Calculate the sum of the digits:**
   - Sum = 3 + 5 + 6

   Let's perform the addition:
   \[
   3 + 5 = 8
   \]
   \[
   8 + 6 = 14
   \]

   So, the sum of the digits is 14.

3. **Multiply the sum by 3:**
   - Product = 14 \times 3

   Let's perform the multiplication:
   \[
   14 \times 3 = 42
   \]

   So, the product is 42.

4. **Subtract 10 from the product:**
   - Result = 42 - 10

   Let's perform the subtraction:
   \[
   42 - 10 = 32
   \]

   So, the result after subtraction is 32.

**Final Answer:**

The final answer, after performing all the calculations, is 32.
