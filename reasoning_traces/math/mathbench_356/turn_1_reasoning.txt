==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 356," we need to first understand what the problem is asking. However, the problem statement is incomplete as it only says "Sample math problem 356" without providing any specific details or context. Therefore, I will assume this is a placeholder or reference to a specific math problem that was not fully provided.

Since I don't have the actual content of "Sample math problem 356," I will demonstrate how to solve a generic math problem by creating an example problem and solving it step by step. Let's assume the problem involves basic algebra:

**Example Problem:**
Solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 2x + 5 = 13 \).

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Equation:**
   The equation given is \( 2x + 5 = 13 \). Our goal is to solve for \( x \).

2. **Isolate the Variable:**
   To solve for \( x \), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We can do this by performing operations that will leave \( x \) alone on one side.

3. **Subtract 5 from Both Sides:**
   To eliminate the constant term on the left side, subtract 5 from both sides of the equation:
   \[
   2x + 5 - 5 = 13 - 5
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   2x = 8
   \]

4. **Divide by 2:**
   Now, divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( x \):
   \[
   \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{8}{2}
   \]
   Simplifying gives:
   \[
   x = 4
   \]

5. **Verify the Solution:**
   Substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation to verify:
   \[
   2(4) + 5 = 13
   \]
   Simplifying the left side:
   \[
   8 + 5 = 13
   \]
   Since both sides of the equation are equal, our solution \( x = 4 \) is correct.

**Final Answer:**
The solution to the equation \( 2x + 5 = 13 \) is \( x = 4 \).
