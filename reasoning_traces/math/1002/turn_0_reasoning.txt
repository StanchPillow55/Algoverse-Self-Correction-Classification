To solve the problem, we need to determine how many chocolate bars are in a box based on the information given about the sales of Lisa and Peter.

1. **Identify the variables**:
   - Let \( x \) be the number of chocolate bars in one box.

2. **Calculate the total number of boxes sold**:
   - Lisa sold 3.5 boxes of chocolate bars.
   - Peter sold 4.5 boxes of chocolate bars.
   - Together, they sold:
     \[
     3.5 + 4.5 = 8 \text{ boxes}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total number of chocolate bars sold**:
   - We know that together they sold 64 chocolate bars. Since they sold a total of 8 boxes, we can express the total number of chocolate bars sold in terms of \( x \):
     \[
     \text{Total chocolate bars} = \text{Total boxes} \times \text{Chocolate bars per box} = 8x
     \]

4. **Set up the equation**:
   - We can set up the equation based on the total number of chocolate bars sold:
     \[
     8x = 64
     \]

5. **Solve for \( x \)**:
   - To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 8:
     \[
     x = \frac{64}{8} = 8
     \]

6. **Conclusion**:
   - Therefore, the number of chocolate bars in one box is \( \boxed{8} \). 

This means that each box contains 8 chocolate bars.
