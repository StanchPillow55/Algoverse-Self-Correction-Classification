==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 294," we need to first understand what the problem is asking. Since the problem is not explicitly stated, let's assume it involves a typical math problem-solving scenario. I'll create a hypothetical problem and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem 294:**

"Calculate the sum of the first 20 positive even numbers."

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Identify the Sequence:**
   - The first positive even numbers are 2, 4, 6, 8, ..., up to the 20th even number.

2. **Recognize the Pattern:**
   - Even numbers can be expressed as 2n, where n is a positive integer.
   - The sequence of the first 20 even numbers is: 2(1), 2(2), 2(3), ..., 2(20).

3. **Write the Sequence:**
   - The sequence is: 2, 4, 6, 8, ..., 40.

4. **Use the Formula for the Sum of an Arithmetic Sequence:**
   - The sum \( S \) of the first \( n \) terms of an arithmetic sequence is given by:
     \[
     S = \frac{n}{2} \times (a + l)
     \]
     where \( n \) is the number of terms, \( a \) is the first term, and \( l \) is the last term.

5. **Substitute the Known Values:**
   - Here, \( n = 20 \), \( a = 2 \), and \( l = 40 \).

6. **Calculate the Sum:**
   \[
   S = \frac{20}{2} \times (2 + 40)
   \]
   \[
   S = 10 \times 42
   \]
   \[
   S = 420
   \]

7. **Verify the Calculation:**
   - To ensure accuracy, let's verify by calculating the sum using another method, such as pairing:
   - Pair the numbers: (2 + 40), (4 + 38), (6 + 36), ..., (20 + 22).
   - Each pair sums to 42, and there are 10 such pairs.
   - Therefore, the sum is \( 10 \times 42 = 420 \).

**Final Answer:**

The sum of the first 20 positive even numbers is 420.
