==================================================

To determine how many pages Bekah needs to read each day for the next 5 days to complete her reading assignment, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total pages left to read**:
   - Bekah had to read a total of 408 pages.
   - She has already read 113 pages.
   - To find out how many pages she has left to read, we subtract the pages she has read from the total pages:

   \[
   \text{Pages left} = \text{Total pages} - \text{Pages read}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Pages left} = 408 - 113 = 295
   \]

2. **Determine how many pages she needs to read each day**:
   - Bekah has 5 days left to finish her reading.
   - To find out how many pages she needs to read each day, we divide the number of pages left by the number of days remaining:

   \[
   \text{Pages per day} = \frac{\text{Pages left}}{\text{Days left}}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Pages per day} = \frac{295}{5}
   \]

3. **Perform the division**:
   - Now we calculate \(295 \div 5\):

   \[
   295 \div 5 = 59
   \]

4. **Conclusion**:
   - Bekah needs to read 59 pages each day for the next 5 days to complete her reading assignment.

Thus, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{59}
\]
