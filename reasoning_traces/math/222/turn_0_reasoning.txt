To solve this problem, we need to determine how many pages Bekah has left to read after the weekend and then divide that number by the 5 days she has left to complete her reading assignment.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Total Pages to Read**: Bekah needs to read a total of 408 pages for her history class.

2. **Pages Already Read**: Bekah read 113 pages over the weekend.

3. **Calculate Remaining Pages**: To find out how many pages Bekah has left to read, we subtract the number of pages she has already read from the total number of pages:
   \[
   408 \text{ pages (total)} - 113 \text{ pages (read)} = 295 \text{ pages (remaining)}
   \]

4. **Days Left to Read**: Bekah has 5 days left to finish her reading.

5. **Pages to Read Per Day**: To find out how many pages Bekah needs to read each day, we divide the remaining pages by the number of days she has left:
   \[
   \frac{295 \text{ pages}}{5 \text{ days}} = 59 \text{ pages per day}
   \]

So, Bekah will need to read 59 pages each day for the next 5 days to complete her assignment.

**Final Answer**: Bekah needs to read 59 pages per day.
