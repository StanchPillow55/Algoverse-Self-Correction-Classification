Question ID: 222
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine how many pages Bekah needs to read each day over the next 5 days to complete her reading assignment. Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Determine the Total Number of Pages Bekah Needs to Read:**
   Bekah's assignment is to read a total of 408 pages.

2. **Calculate the Number of Pages Bekah Has Already Read:**
   Bekah has already read 113 pages over the weekend.

3. **Find Out How Many Pages Are Left to Read:**
   To find out how many pages Bekah still needs to read, we subtract the number of pages she has already read from the total number of pages:
   \[
   \text{Pages left to read} = \text{Total pages} - \text{Pages already read}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Pages left to read} = 408 - 113 = 295
   \]

4. **Determine the Number of Pages Bekah Needs to Read Each Day:**
   Bekah has 5 days left to finish her reading. To find out how many pages she needs to read each day, we divide the remaining pages by the number of days:
   \[
   \text{Pages per day} = \frac{\text{Pages left to read}}{\text{Number of days}}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Pages per day} = \frac{295}{5} = 59
   \]

5. **Conclusion:**
   Bekah needs to read 59 pages each day for the next 5 days to complete her assignment.

Therefore, the final answer is that Bekah needs to read **59 pages per day**.
