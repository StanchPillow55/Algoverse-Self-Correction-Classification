Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine how many pages Bekah has left to read after the weekend and then calculate how many pages she needs to read each day over the next 5 days to complete her assignment.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Determine Total Pages to Read:**
   Bekah needs to read a total of 408 pages for her history class.

2. **Pages Read Over the Weekend:**
   Bekah read 113 pages over the weekend.

3. **Calculate Remaining Pages:**
   To find out how many pages Bekah still needs to read, subtract the number of pages she has already read from the total number of pages:
   \[
   \text{Remaining pages} = \text{Total pages} - \text{Pages read over the weekend}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Remaining pages} = 408 - 113 = 295
   \]

4. **Determine Pages to Read Per Day:**
   Bekah has 5 days left to read the remaining pages. To find out how many pages she needs to read each day, divide the remaining pages by the number of days:
   \[
   \text{Pages per day} = \frac{\text{Remaining pages}}{\text{Number of days}}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Pages per day} = \frac{295}{5} = 59
   \]

### Conclusion:
Bekah needs to read 59 pages each day for the next 5 days to complete her reading assignment.

**Final Answer:**
Bekah will need to read 59 pages each day for 5 days.
