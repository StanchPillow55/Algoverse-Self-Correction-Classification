To find out how many newspapers James delivers to District B, we can start by setting up the information we have:

1. Total newspapers delivered by James in a day: **600**
2. Newspapers delivered to District A: **198**
3. Newspapers delivered to District C: **209**
4. Newspapers delivered to District B: **unknown** (let's call it \( x \))

Now, we can express the total number of newspapers delivered as the sum of the newspapers delivered to each district:

\[
\text{Total newspapers} = \text{Newspapers to District A} + \text{Newspapers to District B} + \text{Newspapers to District C}
\]

Substituting the known values into the equation, we have:

\[
600 = 198 + x + 209
\]

Next, we can simplify the right side of the equation by adding the numbers we know:

\[
198 + 209 = 407
\]

Now, we can rewrite the equation:

\[
600 = 407 + x
\]

To isolate \( x \), we subtract 407 from both sides:

\[
x = 600 - 407
\]

Now, we perform the subtraction:

\[
x = 193
\]

Thus, the number of newspapers delivered to District B is **193**.

Finally, we can state the answer clearly:

**James delivers 193 newspapers to District B.**
