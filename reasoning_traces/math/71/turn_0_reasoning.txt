==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to determine the total number of instructions Kelian has to read to prepare both dishes.

1. **Identify the number of instructions in the first recipe**:
   - The first recipe has 20 instructions.

2. **Determine the number of instructions in the second recipe**:
   - The second recipe has twice as many instructions as the first one. 
   - Therefore, the number of instructions in the second recipe can be calculated as:
     \[
     \text{Instructions in second recipe} = 2 \times \text{Instructions in first recipe} = 2 \times 20 = 40
     \]

3. **Calculate the total number of instructions**:
   - To find the total number of instructions Kelian has to read for both recipes, we add the number of instructions from the first recipe to the number of instructions from the second recipe:
     \[
     \text{Total instructions} = \text{Instructions in first recipe} + \text{Instructions in second recipe} = 20 + 40 = 60
     \]

4. **Final answer**:
   - Therefore, the total number of instructions Kelian has to read to prepare the two dishes is:
     \[
     \boxed{60}
     \]
