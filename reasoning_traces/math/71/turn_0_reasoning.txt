To determine how much money Hillary has left after making her deposit, we will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total earnings from selling crafts.**
   - Hillary sells each craft for 12 dollars.
   - She sells 3 crafts.
   - Total earnings from crafts = Price per craft Ã— Number of crafts sold
   \[
   \text{Total earnings from crafts} = 12 \, \text{dollars/craft} \times 3 \, \text{crafts} = 36 \, \text{dollars}
   \]

2. **Add the extra money received from the customer.**
   - Hillary receives an additional 7 dollars from a customer.
   - Total earnings including the extra money = Total earnings from crafts + Extra money
   \[
   \text{Total earnings including extra} = 36 \, \text{dollars} + 7 \, \text{dollars} = 43 \, \text{dollars}
   \]

3. **Subtract the amount deposited into the bank account.**
   - Hillary deposits 18 dollars into her bank account.
   - Amount left after the deposit = Total earnings including extra - Amount deposited
   \[
   \text{Amount left after deposit} = 43 \, \text{dollars} - 18 \, \text{dollars} = 25 \, \text{dollars}
   \]

4. **Final answer.**
   - After making the deposit, Hillary is left with 25 dollars.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{25}
\]
