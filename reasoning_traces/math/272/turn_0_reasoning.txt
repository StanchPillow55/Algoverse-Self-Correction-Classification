To find out how much change the cashier gives back to the mother after her shopping trip, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total cost of the items purchased.**
   - The mother buys:
     - Cocoa: $4.20
     - Laundry: $9.45
     - Package of pasta: $1.35

   We will add these amounts together:

   \[
   \text{Total Cost} = \text{Cost of Cocoa} + \text{Cost of Laundry} + \text{Cost of Pasta}
   \]

   Substituting the values:

   \[
   \text{Total Cost} = 4.20 + 9.45 + 1.35
   \]

   Now, let's add these amounts step by step:

   - First, add the cost of cocoa and laundry:
     \[
     4.20 + 9.45 = 13.65
     \]

   - Next, add the cost of pasta to this total:
     \[
     13.65 + 1.35 = 15.00
     \]

   So, the total cost of the items is **$15.00**.

2. **Determine how much money the mother paid.**
   - The mother pays $20.00.

3. **Calculate the change given back to the mother.**
   - To find the change, we subtract the total cost from the amount paid:
   
   \[
   \text{Change} = \text{Amount Paid} - \text{Total Cost}
   \]

   Substituting the values:

   \[
   \text{Change} = 20.00 - 15.00
   \]

   Performing the subtraction:

   \[
   \text{Change} = 5.00
   \]

Thus, the cashier gives back **$5.00** in change.

**Final Answer: $5.00**
