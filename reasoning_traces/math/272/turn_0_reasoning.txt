To determine how much more money Oliver has than William, we first need to calculate the total amount of money each person has.

**Step 1: Calculate Oliver's total money.**

Oliver has:
- 10 bills of $20
- 3 bills of $5

First, we calculate the total amount from the $20 bills:
\[
\text{Total from } \$20 \text{ bills} = 10 \times 20 = 200
\]

Next, we calculate the total amount from the $5 bills:
\[
\text{Total from } \$5 \text{ bills} = 3 \times 5 = 15
\]

Now, we add both amounts to find Oliver's total money:
\[
\text{Total money Oliver has} = 200 + 15 = 215
\]

**Step 2: Calculate William's total money.**

William has:
- 15 bills of $10
- 4 bills of $5

First, we calculate the total amount from the $10 bills:
\[
\text{Total from } \$10 \text{ bills} = 15 \times 10 = 150
\]

Next, we calculate the total amount from the $5 bills:
\[
\text{Total from } \$5 \text{ bills} = 4 \times 5 = 20
\]

Now, we add both amounts to find William's total money:
\[
\text{Total money William has} = 150 + 20 = 170
\]

**Step 3: Calculate how much more money Oliver has than William.**

To find out how much more money Oliver has than William, we subtract William's total from Oliver's total:
\[
\text{Difference} = \text{Total money Oliver has} - \text{Total money William has}
\]
\[
\text{Difference} = 215 - 170 = 45
\]

**Final Answer:**
Oliver has $45 more than William.
