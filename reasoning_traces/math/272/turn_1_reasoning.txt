To determine how much more money Oliver has than William, we need to calculate the total amount of money each person has and then find the difference between the two amounts.

**Step 1: Calculate Oliver's total amount of money.**

Oliver has:
- 10 $20 bills
- 3 $5 bills

First, calculate the total amount from the $20 bills:
\[ 10 \times 20 = 200 \]

Next, calculate the total amount from the $5 bills:
\[ 3 \times 5 = 15 \]

Add these two amounts together to find Oliver's total amount of money:
\[ 200 + 15 = 215 \]

So, Oliver has $215.

**Step 2: Calculate William's total amount of money.**

William has:
- 15 $10 bills
- 4 $5 bills

First, calculate the total amount from the $10 bills:
\[ 15 \times 10 = 150 \]

Next, calculate the total amount from the $5 bills:
\[ 4 \times 5 = 20 \]

Add these two amounts together to find William's total amount of money:
\[ 150 + 20 = 170 \]

So, William has $170.

**Step 3: Calculate how much more money Oliver has than William.**

Subtract William's total amount from Oliver's total amount:
\[ 215 - 170 = 45 \]

Therefore, Oliver has $45 more than William.

**Final Answer:**
Oliver has $45 more than William.
