==================================================

It seems like "Sample math problem 402" is not a specific math problem but rather a placeholder or reference to a problem that might be found in a textbook or worksheet. Without the actual content of the problem, I can't provide a solution. However, I can guide you on how to approach solving a math problem step by step.

If you have a specific math problem in mind, please provide the details, and I'll be happy to help you solve it. If you're looking for a general approach to solving math problems, here's a structured method you can follow:

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - Read the problem carefully.
   - Identify what is being asked.
   - Determine what information is given and what needs to be found.

2. **Devise a Plan:**
   - Consider possible strategies to solve the problem, such as drawing a diagram, creating an equation, or breaking the problem into smaller parts.
   - Choose the most appropriate method based on the problem type.

3. **Carry Out the Plan:**
   - Execute the chosen strategy step by step.
   - Perform calculations carefully and check each step for accuracy.
   - Keep track of units and ensure consistency throughout the problem.

4. **Review/Check Your Work:**
   - Once you have a solution, review the problem and your calculations to ensure they make sense.
   - Verify that your solution answers the question posed in the problem.
   - Check for any possible errors or alternative solutions.

5. **State the Final Answer:**
   - Clearly write down the final answer, including units if applicable.
   - Ensure the answer is presented in the required format.

If you provide a specific math problem, I can apply this method to solve it and show all the work and reasoning involved.
