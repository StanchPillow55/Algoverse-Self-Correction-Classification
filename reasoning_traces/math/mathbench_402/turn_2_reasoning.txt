==================================================

To solve the problem, we first need to understand what "Sample math problem 402" refers to. Since the problem is not explicitly stated, I'll assume it's a placeholder for a typical math problem. Let's create a sample problem and solve it step by step.

**Sample Math Problem 402:**

*Problem Statement:*

A rectangle has a length that is 3 times its width. If the perimeter of the rectangle is 48 units, find the dimensions of the rectangle.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**

   We are given that the length \( L \) of a rectangle is 3 times its width \( W \). We are also given that the perimeter \( P \) of the rectangle is 48 units. We need to find the values of \( L \) and \( W \).

2. **Set Up the Equations:**

   The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is:
   \[
   P = 2L + 2W
   \]

   We are given:
   \[
   P = 48
   \]
   \[
   L = 3W
   \]

3. **Substitute the Known Values:**

   Substitute \( L = 3W \) into the perimeter equation:
   \[
   48 = 2(3W) + 2W
   \]

4. **Simplify the Equation:**

   Simplify the equation:
   \[
   48 = 6W + 2W
   \]
   \[
   48 = 8W
   \]

5. **Solve for \( W \):**

   Divide both sides by 8 to solve for \( W \):
   \[
   W = \frac{48}{8} = 6
   \]

6. **Find \( L \):**

   Use the relationship \( L = 3W \) to find \( L \):
   \[
   L = 3 \times 6 = 18
   \]

7. **Verify the Solution:**

   Check if the dimensions satisfy the perimeter condition:
   \[
   P = 2L + 2W = 2(18) + 2(6) = 36 + 12 = 48
   \]

   The calculated perimeter matches the given perimeter, confirming that our solution is correct.

**Final Answer:**

The dimensions of the rectangle are:
- Width \( W = 6 \) units
- Length \( L = 18 \) units
