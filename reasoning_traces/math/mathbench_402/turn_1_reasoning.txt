==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 402," we need to first understand what the problem is asking. However, the problem statement is not clear or specific. It seems like a placeholder or an incomplete reference to a specific math problem. Without additional context or details, it's impossible to provide a precise solution.

However, I can guide you through a general approach to solving math problems, which you can apply to any specific problem once you have the details:

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - Carefully read the problem statement.
   - Identify what is being asked.
   - Determine what information is given and what needs to be found.

2. **Devise a Plan:**
   - Consider different strategies to solve the problem, such as drawing a diagram, creating an equation, or breaking the problem into smaller parts.
   - Choose the most appropriate method based on the type of problem (e.g., algebraic, geometric, arithmetic).

3. **Carry Out the Plan:**
   - Execute the chosen strategy step by step.
   - Perform calculations carefully, showing all work.
   - Keep track of units and make sure all parts of the problem are addressed.

4. **Review/Check Your Work:**
   - Verify each step of your solution to ensure accuracy.
   - Check if the final answer makes sense in the context of the problem.
   - If possible, use a different method to confirm the result.

Since "Sample math problem 402" lacks specific details, I recommend applying the above steps to any math problem you encounter. If you have a specific math problem in mind, please provide the details, and I would be happy to help you solve it.
