==================================================

To solve the problem, we first need to understand what "Sample math problem 402" refers to. Since the problem is not explicitly stated, I'll assume it's a placeholder for a typical math problem. Let's create a hypothetical problem and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem 402:**

"Calculate the sum of all even numbers between 1 and 100."

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Identify the Even Numbers:**
   - Even numbers between 1 and 100 are 2, 4, 6, ..., 100.
   - These numbers form an arithmetic sequence where the first term \( a_1 = 2 \) and the common difference \( d = 2 \).

2. **Determine the Number of Terms:**
   - The last term \( a_n = 100 \).
   - The formula for the \( n \)-th term of an arithmetic sequence is:
     \[
     a_n = a_1 + (n-1) \cdot d
     \]
   - Plug in the known values:
     \[
     100 = 2 + (n-1) \cdot 2
     \]
   - Simplify and solve for \( n \):
     \[
     100 = 2 + 2n - 2
     \]
     \[
     100 = 2n
     \]
     \[
     n = 50
     \]
   - There are 50 even numbers between 1 and 100.

3. **Calculate the Sum of the Sequence:**
   - The sum \( S_n \) of the first \( n \) terms of an arithmetic sequence is given by:
     \[
     S_n = \frac{n}{2} \cdot (a_1 + a_n)
     \]
   - Substitute the known values:
     \[
     S_{50} = \frac{50}{2} \cdot (2 + 100)
     \]
     \[
     S_{50} = 25 \cdot 102
     \]
     \[
     S_{50} = 2550
     \]

**Final Answer:**

The sum of all even numbers between 1 and 100 is 2550.
