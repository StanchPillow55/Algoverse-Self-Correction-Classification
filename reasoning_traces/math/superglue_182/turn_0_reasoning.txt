==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 182" entails. Since the problem statement is not specific, I'll provide a general approach to solving a typical math reasoning problem. Let's assume this is a typical math problem involving logical reasoning or algebraic manipulation.

### Step 1: Understand the Problem
Since the problem statement is not provided, let's assume it involves solving an algebraic equation or a logical reasoning puzzle. For example, let's say the problem is:

"Find the value of \( x \) in the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \)."

### Step 2: Set Up the Equation
The given equation is:
\[ 2x + 3 = 11 \]

### Step 3: Isolate the Variable
To solve for \( x \), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We can do this by performing the following steps:

1. **Subtract 3 from both sides** to eliminate the constant term on the left side:
   \[
   2x + 3 - 3 = 11 - 3
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   2x = 8
   \]

2. **Divide both sides by 2** to solve for \( x \):
   \[
   \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{8}{2}
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   x = 4
   \]

### Step 4: Verify the Solution
To ensure our solution is correct, substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation:
\[ 2(4) + 3 = 11 \]
\[ 8 + 3 = 11 \]
\[ 11 = 11 \]

The left side equals the right side, confirming that our solution is correct.

### Final Answer
The value of \( x \) is \( 4 \).

This is a general example of how to approach a math reasoning problem. If you have a specific problem or need further assistance, please provide additional details.
