==================================================

To determine the total cost for Mario to buy snowshoes for his 6 sled dogs, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of legs for the dogs**: 
   Each dog has 4 legs. Therefore, for 6 dogs, the total number of legs is calculated as follows:
   \[
   \text{Total legs} = \text{Number of dogs} \times \text{Legs per dog} = 6 \times 4 = 24 \text{ legs}
   \]

2. **Determine the number of pairs of snowshoes needed**:
   Each pair of snowshoes is designed to cover 2 legs. To find out how many pairs of snowshoes are needed for 24 legs, we divide the total number of legs by 2:
   \[
   \text{Number of pairs of snowshoes} = \frac{\text{Total legs}}{2} = \frac{24}{2} = 12 \text{ pairs}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total cost for the snowshoes**:
   Each pair of snowshoes costs $12.00. To find the total cost for 12 pairs, we multiply the number of pairs by the cost per pair:
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = \text{Number of pairs} \times \text{Cost per pair} = 12 \times 12.00 = 144.00
   \]

4. **Final answer**:
   Therefore, the total cost for Mario to buy snowshoes for all of his dogs is:
   \[
   \boxed{144.00}
   \]
