To solve this problem, we need to determine how much weight the bear gained from eating small animals. We know the bear needs to gain a total of 1000 pounds. Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Weight Gained from Berries:**
   - The bear gained a fifth of the weight it needed from berries.
   - A fifth of 1000 pounds is calculated as follows:
     \[
     \frac{1}{5} \times 1000 = 200 \text{ pounds}
     \]
   - So, the bear gained 200 pounds from berries.

2. **Weight Gained from Acorns:**
   - During autumn, the bear gained twice the amount it gained from berries by eating acorns.
   - Twice the amount gained from berries is:
     \[
     2 \times 200 = 400 \text{ pounds}
     \]
   - So, the bear gained 400 pounds from acorns.

3. **Remaining Weight to Gain:**
   - After gaining weight from berries and acorns, the remaining weight the bear needs to gain is:
     \[
     1000 - 200 - 400 = 400 \text{ pounds}
     \]

4. **Weight Gained from Salmon:**
   - Salmon made up half of the remaining weight the bear needed to gain.
   - Half of the remaining 400 pounds is:
     \[
     \frac{1}{2} \times 400 = 200 \text{ pounds}
     \]
   - So, the bear gained 200 pounds from salmon.

5. **Weight Gained from Small Animals:**
   - The total weight gained from berries, acorns, and salmon is:
     \[
     200 + 400 + 200 = 800 \text{ pounds}
     \]
   - Since the bear needed to gain a total of 1000 pounds, the weight gained from small animals is:
     \[
     1000 - 800 = 200 \text{ pounds}
     \]

Therefore, the bear gained **200 pounds** from eating small animals.
