==================================================

The bear needs to gain 1000 pounds in total.

First, we calculate how much weight the bear gained from eating berries. Since berries made up a fifth of the weight it needed to gain, we divide 1000 by 5:

1000 / 5 = 200 pounds

The bear gained 200 pounds from eating berries.

Next, we calculate how much weight the bear gained from eating acorns. Since acorns made up twice the amount it gained from berries, we multiply 200 by 2:

200 * 2 = 400 pounds

The bear gained 400 pounds from eating acorns.

So far, the bear has gained 200 pounds from berries and 400 pounds from acorns, for a total of:

200 + 400 = 600 pounds

The bear still needs to gain 1000 - 600 = 400 pounds from eating salmon and small animals.

Since salmon made up half of the remaining weight, we divide 400 by 2 to find out how much weight the bear gained from eating salmon:

400 / 2 = 200 pounds

The bear gained 200 pounds from eating salmon.

Finally, to find out how much weight the bear gained from eating small animals, we subtract the weight gained from salmon from the remaining weight:

400 - 200 = 200 pounds

So, the bear gained 200 pounds from eating small animals.
