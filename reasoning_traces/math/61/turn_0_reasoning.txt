To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step, calculating the weight gained by the bear from different food sources and ultimately finding out how much weight it gained from small animals.

1. **Total Weight Needed to Gain**: The bear needs to gain a total of 1000 pounds.

2. **Weight Gained from Berries**: 
   - The bear gained a fifth of the weight it needed from berries.
   - Calculation: 
     \[
     \text{Weight from berries} = \frac{1}{5} \times 1000 = 200 \text{ pounds}
     \]

3. **Weight Gained from Acorns**: 
   - The bear gained twice the amount it gained from berries from acorns.
   - Calculation:
     \[
     \text{Weight from acorns} = 2 \times 200 = 400 \text{ pounds}
     \]

4. **Total Weight Gained from Berries and Acorns**: 
   - We now add the weight gained from berries and acorns to find the total weight gained so far.
   - Calculation:
     \[
     \text{Total weight from berries and acorns} = 200 + 400 = 600 \text{ pounds}
     \]

5. **Remaining Weight to Gain**: 
   - We subtract the total weight gained from the total weight needed to find out how much more weight the bear needs to gain.
   - Calculation:
     \[
     \text{Remaining weight to gain} = 1000 - 600 = 400 \text{ pounds}
     \]

6. **Weight Gained from Salmon**: 
   - The bear gained half of the remaining weight from salmon.
   - Calculation:
     \[
     \text{Weight from salmon} = \frac{1}{2} \times 400 = 200 \text{ pounds}
     \]

7. **Weight Gained from Small Animals**: 
   - To find out how much weight the bear gained from small animals, we need to subtract the weight gained from berries, acorns, and salmon from the total weight needed.
   - Calculation:
     \[
     \text{Weight from small animals} = 1000 - (200 + 400 + 200) = 1000 - 800 = 200 \text{ pounds}
     \]

Thus, the bear gained **200 pounds** from eating small woodland animals.

**Final Answer**: The bear gained 200 pounds eating small animals.
