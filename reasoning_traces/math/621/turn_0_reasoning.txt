To find the total cost of John’s physical therapy, we will break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the number of sessions per week**: 
   John goes to physical therapy twice a week.

2. **Determine the duration of each session**: 
   Each session lasts for 2 hours.

3. **Calculate the total number of sessions over 6 weeks**:
   \[
   \text{Total sessions} = \text{Sessions per week} \times \text{Number of weeks} = 2 \text{ sessions/week} \times 6 \text{ weeks} = 12 \text{ sessions}
   \]

4. **Calculate the total hours of therapy**:
   Since each session is 2 hours long, we can calculate the total hours by multiplying the number of sessions by the duration of each session:
   \[
   \text{Total hours} = \text{Total sessions} \times \text{Hours per session} = 12 \text{ sessions} \times 2 \text{ hours/session} = 24 \text{ hours}
   \]

5. **Determine the cost per hour**:
   The cost of therapy is given as $125 per hour.

6. **Calculate the total cost of therapy**:
   To find the total cost, we multiply the total hours of therapy by the cost per hour:
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = \text{Total hours} \times \text{Cost per hour} = 24 \text{ hours} \times 125 \text{ dollars/hour}
   \]
   Now, we perform the multiplication:
   \[
   24 \times 125 = 3000
   \]

Thus, the total cost of John’s physical therapy is **$3000**.

Final answer: **$3000**.
