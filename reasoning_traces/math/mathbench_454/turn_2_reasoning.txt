Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 454," I need more specific information about the problem itself. Since the problem is not provided, I'll demonstrate how to solve a generic math problem by creating an example problem and solving it step by step.

**Example Problem:**

Solve for \( x \) in the equation: 

\[ 2x + 3 = 11 \]

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Equation:**
   The equation given is a simple linear equation in one variable, \( x \). Our goal is to isolate \( x \) on one side of the equation to find its value.

2. **Isolate the Variable:**
   To isolate \( x \), we need to perform operations that will leave \( x \) alone on one side of the equation. Start by eliminating the constant term on the side with \( x \).

   \[
   2x + 3 = 11
   \]

   Subtract 3 from both sides to remove the constant term from the left side:

   \[
   2x + 3 - 3 = 11 - 3
   \]

   Simplifying both sides gives:

   \[
   2x = 8
   \]

3. **Solve for \( x \):**
   Now, divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( x \):

   \[
   \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{8}{2}
   \]

   Simplifying both sides gives:

   \[
   x = 4
   \]

4. **Verify the Solution:**
   Substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies the equation:

   \[
   2(4) + 3 = 11
   \]

   Simplifying the left side:

   \[
   8 + 3 = 11
   \]

   Since both sides of the equation are equal, \( x = 4 \) is indeed the correct solution.

**Final Answer:**

The solution to the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \) is \( x = 4 \).
