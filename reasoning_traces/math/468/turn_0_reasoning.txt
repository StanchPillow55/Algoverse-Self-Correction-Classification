==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of the items Kevin wants to buy, apply any discounts, and then add the sales tax. Let's break it down step by step.

### Step 1: Calculate the Cost of Each Item Type

1. **T-shirts:**
   - Each T-shirt costs $8.
   - Kevin wants to buy 6 T-shirts.
   - Total cost for T-shirts = \(6 \times 8 = 48\) dollars.

2. **Sweaters:**
   - Each sweater costs $18.
   - Kevin wants to buy 4 sweaters.
   - Total cost for sweaters = \(4 \times 18 = 72\) dollars.

3. **Jackets:**
   - Each jacket costs $80.
   - The jacket is on sale with a 10% discount.
   - Discount on each jacket = \(10\% \times 80 = 0.10 \times 80 = 8\) dollars.
   - Discounted price of each jacket = \(80 - 8 = 72\) dollars.
   - Kevin wants to buy 5 jackets.
   - Total cost for jackets = \(5 \times 72 = 360\) dollars.

### Step 2: Calculate the Total Cost Before Tax

Add up the total costs for all the items:

- Total cost for T-shirts = $48
- Total cost for sweaters = $72
- Total cost for jackets = $360

Total cost before tax = \(48 + 72 + 360 = 480\) dollars.

### Step 3: Calculate the Sales Tax

The sales tax is 5%.

- Sales tax = \(5\% \times 480 = 0.05 \times 480 = 24\) dollars.

### Step 4: Calculate the Total Cost Including Sales Tax

Add the sales tax to the total cost before tax:

- Total cost including sales tax = \(480 + 24 = 504\) dollars.

### Final Answer

Kevin has to pay a total of $504 for all the items, including the sales tax.
