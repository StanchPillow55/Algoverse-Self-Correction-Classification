==================================================

To find out how much Kevin has to pay for all the items including sales tax, we will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total cost of each type of item before tax.**
2. **Apply the discount on the jacket.**
3. **Sum the total costs of all items.**
4. **Calculate the sales tax on the total cost.**
5. **Add the sales tax to the total cost to find the final amount Kevin has to pay.**

### Step 1: Calculate the total cost of each type of item before tax.

- **T-shirts:** 
  - Price per T-shirt = $8
  - Number of T-shirts = 6
  - Total cost for T-shirts = \( 6 \times 8 = 48 \)

- **Sweaters:**
  - Price per sweater = $18
  - Number of sweaters = 4
  - Total cost for sweaters = \( 4 \times 18 = 72 \)

- **Jackets:**
  - Price per jacket = $80
  - Number of jackets = 5
  - Total cost for jackets = \( 5 \times 80 = 400 \)

### Step 2: Apply the discount on the jacket.

The jacket is on sale with a 10% discount. We need to calculate the discounted price of one jacket first.

- **Discount on one jacket:**
  - Discount = 10% of $80 = \( 0.10 \times 80 = 8 \)
  - Discounted price of one jacket = \( 80 - 8 = 72 \)

Now, calculate the total cost for 5 jackets at the discounted price.

- **Total cost for jackets after discount:**
  - Total cost for jackets = \( 5 \times 72 = 360 \)

### Step 3: Sum the total costs of all items.

Now we sum the total costs of T-shirts, sweaters, and jackets.

- **Total cost before tax:**
  \[
  \text{Total cost} = \text{Total cost of T-shirts} + \text{Total cost of sweaters} + \text{Total cost of jackets}
  \]
  \[
  \text{Total cost} = 48 + 72 + 360 = 480
  \]

### Step 4: Calculate the sales tax on the total cost.

The sales tax is 5%. We will calculate the sales tax on the total cost of $480.

- **Sales tax:**
  \[
  \text{Sales tax} = 5\% \text{ of } 480 = 0.05 \times 480 = 24
  \]

### Step 5: Add the sales tax to the total cost to find the final amount.

Now we add the sales tax to the total cost to find out how much Kevin has to pay in total.

- **Final amount to pay:**
  \[
  \text{Final amount} = \text{Total cost} + \text{Sales tax} = 480 + 24 = 504
  \]

### Final Answer

Kevin has to pay **$504** for all the items, including the sales tax.
