Question ID: 468
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To determine how much Kevin has to pay for all the items, including the sales tax, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total cost of each type of item without discounts or tax.**

   - **T-shirts:** Kevin wants to buy six T-shirts, and each T-shirt costs $8.
     \[
     \text{Total cost for T-shirts} = 6 \times 8 = 48 \text{ dollars}
     \]

   - **Sweaters:** Kevin wants to buy four sweaters, and each sweater costs $18.
     \[
     \text{Total cost for sweaters} = 4 \times 18 = 72 \text{ dollars}
     \]

   - **Jackets:** Kevin wants to buy five jackets, and each jacket costs $80. However, the jackets are on sale with a 10% discount.
     - First, calculate the discount on one jacket:
       \[
       \text{Discount on one jacket} = 80 \times 0.10 = 8 \text{ dollars}
       \]
     - The sale price of one jacket after the discount:
       \[
       \text{Sale price of one jacket} = 80 - 8 = 72 \text{ dollars}
       \]
     - Total cost for five jackets at the sale price:
       \[
       \text{Total cost for jackets} = 5 \times 72 = 360 \text{ dollars}
       \]

2. **Calculate the total cost of all items before tax.**

   Add the total costs of T-shirts, sweaters, and jackets:
   \[
   \text{Total cost before tax} = 48 + 72 + 360 = 480 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Calculate the sales tax.**

   The sales tax is 5% of the total cost before tax:
   \[
   \text{Sales tax} = 480 \times 0.05 = 24 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Calculate the total cost including sales tax.**

   Add the sales tax to the total cost before tax:
   \[
   \text{Total cost including tax} = 480 + 24 = 504 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Therefore, Kevin has to pay a total of $504 for all the items, including the sales tax.

**Final Answer:** Kevin has to pay $504.
