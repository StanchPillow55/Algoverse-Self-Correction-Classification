Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To determine how much Kevin has to pay for all the items, including the sales tax, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total cost of each type of item before any discounts or taxes:**

   - **T-shirts:**
     \[
     \text{Cost of 1 T-shirt} = \$8
     \]
     \[
     \text{Cost of 6 T-shirts} = 6 \times 8 = \$48
     \]

   - **Sweaters:**
     \[
     \text{Cost of 1 sweater} = \$18
     \]
     \[
     \text{Cost of 4 sweaters} = 4 \times 18 = \$72
     \]

   - **Jackets:**
     \[
     \text{Cost of 1 jacket} = \$80
     \]
     \[
     \text{Cost of 5 jackets} = 5 \times 80 = \$400
     \]

2. **Apply the discount to the jackets:**

   The jackets are on sale with a 10% discount. Therefore, the discount on one jacket is:
   \[
   \text{Discount on 1 jacket} = 0.10 \times 80 = \$8
   \]
   \[
   \text{Discount on 5 jackets} = 5 \times 8 = \$40
   \]

   The total cost of the jackets after the discount is:
   \[
   \text{Discounted cost of 5 jackets} = 400 - 40 = \$360
   \]

3. **Calculate the total cost of all items before tax:**

   Add the total costs of T-shirts, sweaters, and discounted jackets:
   \[
   \text{Total cost before tax} = 48 + 72 + 360 = \$480
   \]

4. **Calculate the sales tax:**

   The sales tax is 5% of the total cost before tax:
   \[
   \text{Sales tax} = 0.05 \times 480 = \$24
   \]

5. **Calculate the total amount Kevin has to pay:**

   Add the sales tax to the total cost before tax:
   \[
   \text{Total cost including tax} = 480 + 24 = \$504
   \]

Therefore, Kevin has to pay a total of \(\$504\) for all the items, including the sales tax.
