==================================================

To solve the problem, we first need to understand what "Sample math problem 397" refers to. Since the problem is not explicitly stated, I'll assume it's a placeholder for a specific math problem. Let's create a sample problem and solve it step by step.

**Sample Math Problem 397:**

**Problem:**  
Solve the quadratic equation: \( 2x^2 - 4x - 6 = 0 \).

**Step 1: Identify the coefficients.**

The given quadratic equation is in the standard form \( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \), where:
- \( a = 2 \)
- \( b = -4 \)
- \( c = -6 \)

**Step 2: Calculate the discriminant.**

The discriminant \( D \) of a quadratic equation \( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \) is given by:
\[ D = b^2 - 4ac \]

Substitute the values of \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \):
\[ D = (-4)^2 - 4 \times 2 \times (-6) \]
\[ D = 16 + 48 \]
\[ D = 64 \]

**Step 3: Determine the nature of the roots.**

Since the discriminant \( D = 64 \) is positive, the quadratic equation has two distinct real roots.

**Step 4: Use the quadratic formula to find the roots.**

The quadratic formula is:
\[ x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{D}}{2a} \]

Substitute the values of \( b \), \( D \), and \( a \):
\[ x = \frac{-(-4) \pm \sqrt{64}}{2 \times 2} \]
\[ x = \frac{4 \pm 8}{4} \]

**Step 5: Calculate the two roots.**

1. First root:
   \[ x_1 = \frac{4 + 8}{4} \]
   \[ x_1 = \frac{12}{4} \]
   \[ x_1 = 3 \]

2. Second root:
   \[ x_2 = \frac{4 - 8}{4} \]
   \[ x_2 = \frac{-4}{4} \]
   \[ x_2 = -1 \]

**Final Answer:**

The solutions to the quadratic equation \( 2x^2 - 4x - 6 = 0 \) are \( x = 3 \) and \( x = -1 \).
