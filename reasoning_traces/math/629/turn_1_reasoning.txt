To determine how much James made from selling the cars, we will break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate the total sales revenue from selling the cars:**
   James sold 10 cars, and each car was sold for $25,000. Therefore, the total sales revenue is calculated as follows:
   \[
   \text{Total Sales Revenue} = \text{Number of Cars} \times \text{Price per Car}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total Sales Revenue} = 10 \times 25,000 = 250,000
   \]

2. **Calculate the total cost to the company for acquiring the cars:**
   The company paid 30% of the selling price to acquire each car. First, we need to find out how much the company paid for one car:
   \[
   \text{Cost per Car} = \text{Selling Price} \times \text{Acquisition Percentage}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Cost per Car} = 25,000 \times 0.30 = 7,500
   \]
   Now, we calculate the total cost for acquiring all 10 cars:
   \[
   \text{Total Acquisition Cost} = \text{Number of Cars} \times \text{Cost per Car}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total Acquisition Cost} = 10 \times 7,500 = 75,000
   \]

3. **Calculate the total profit made by the company:**
   The profit is calculated as the total sales revenue minus the total acquisition cost:
   \[
   \text{Total Profit} = \text{Total Sales Revenue} - \text{Total Acquisition Cost}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total Profit} = 250,000 - 75,000 = 175,000
   \]

4. **Calculate James's commission on the profit:**
   James receives a 10% commission on the total profit. We calculate his commission as follows:
   \[
   \text{Commission} = \text{Total Profit} \times \text{Commission Percentage}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Commission} = 175,000 \times 0.10 = 17,500
   \]

5. **Final Answer:**
   Therefore, the total amount James made from his commission is:
   \[
   \boxed{17,500}
   \]
