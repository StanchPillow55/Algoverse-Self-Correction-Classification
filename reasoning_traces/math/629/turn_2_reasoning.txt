To determine how much James made from selling the cars, we need to break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate the total sales revenue from selling the cars:**
   James sold 10 cars at a price of $25,000 each. Therefore, the total sales revenue can be calculated as follows:

   \[
   \text{Total Sales Revenue} = \text{Number of Cars} \times \text{Price per Car}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total Sales Revenue} = 10 \times 25,000 = 250,000
   \]

2. **Calculate the total cost to the company for acquiring the cars:**
   The company paid 30% of the selling price to acquire each car. We first calculate the cost per car:

   \[
   \text{Cost per Car} = 30\% \times \text{Price per Car} = 0.30 \times 25,000 = 7,500
   \]

   Now, we can calculate the total cost for acquiring all 10 cars:

   \[
   \text{Total Acquisition Cost} = \text{Number of Cars} \times \text{Cost per Car}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total Acquisition Cost} = 10 \times 7,500 = 75,000
   \]

3. **Calculate the total profit made by the company:**
   The profit is calculated by subtracting the total acquisition cost from the total sales revenue:

   \[
   \text{Total Profit} = \text{Total Sales Revenue} - \text{Total Acquisition Cost}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total Profit} = 250,000 - 75,000 = 175,000
   \]

4. **Calculate James's commission:**
   James earns a 10% commission on the profits. Therefore, we calculate his commission as follows:

   \[
   \text{James's Commission} = 10\% \times \text{Total Profit} = 0.10 \times 175,000
   \]
   \[
   \text{James's Commission} = 17,500
   \]

5. **Final Answer:**
   Thus, the total amount James made from his commission on the sales is:

   \[
   \boxed{17,500}
   \]
