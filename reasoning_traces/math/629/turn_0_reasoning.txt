==================================================

To determine how much James made from selling the cars, we will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total revenue from selling the cars.**
2. **Determine the total cost incurred by the company to acquire the cars.**
3. **Calculate the profit made by the company.**
4. **Calculate James's commission based on the profit.**

### Step 1: Calculate Total Revenue

James sold 10 cars, each costing $25,000. Therefore, the total revenue from selling the cars is:

\[
\text{Total Revenue} = \text{Number of Cars} \times \text{Price per Car}
\]
\[
\text{Total Revenue} = 10 \times 25,000 = 250,000
\]

### Step 2: Determine Total Cost

The company paid 30% of the selling price to acquire the cars. We first calculate the cost per car:

\[
\text{Cost per Car} = 30\% \text{ of } 25,000 = 0.30 \times 25,000 = 7,500
\]

Now, we calculate the total cost for 10 cars:

\[
\text{Total Cost} = \text{Number of Cars} \times \text{Cost per Car}
\]
\[
\text{Total Cost} = 10 \times 7,500 = 75,000
\]

### Step 3: Calculate Profit

Profit is calculated as the total revenue minus the total cost:

\[
\text{Profit} = \text{Total Revenue} - \text{Total Cost}
\]
\[
\text{Profit} = 250,000 - 75,000 = 175,000
\]

### Step 4: Calculate James's Commission

James earns a 10% commission on the profit. Therefore, we calculate his commission as follows:

\[
\text{Commission} = 10\% \text{ of Profit} = 0.10 \times 175,000
\]
\[
\text{Commission} = 17,500
\]

### Final Answer

James made **$17,500** from his commission on the sales of the cars.
