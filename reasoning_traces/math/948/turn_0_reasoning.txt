To find out how much commission Cayley will earn from selling the newspapers, we need to calculate the commission for each type of newspaper separately and then sum them up.

### Step 1: Calculate the total sales for each newspaper.

1. **New York Times:**
   - Price per copy: $5
   - Number of copies sold: 6
   - Total sales for New York Times = Price per copy × Number of copies sold
   \[
   \text{Total sales for New York Times} = 5 \times 6 = 30 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Wall Street Journal:**
   - Price per copy: $15
   - Number of copies sold: 10
   - Total sales for Wall Street Journal = Price per copy × Number of copies sold
   \[
   \text{Total sales for Wall Street Journal} = 15 \times 10 = 150 \text{ dollars}
   \]

### Step 2: Calculate the commission for each newspaper.

1. **Commission for New York Times:**
   - Commission rate: 10%
   - Commission earned = Total sales × Commission rate
   \[
   \text{Commission for New York Times} = 30 \times 0.10 = 3 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Commission for Wall Street Journal:**
   - Commission rate: 8%
   - Commission earned = Total sales × Commission rate
   \[
   \text{Commission for Wall Street Journal} = 150 \times 0.08 = 12 \text{ dollars}
   \]

### Step 3: Calculate the total commission earned.

Now, we will sum the commissions from both newspapers to find the total commission earned by Cayley.
\[
\text{Total commission} = \text{Commission for New York Times} + \text{Commission for Wall Street Journal}
\]
\[
\text{Total commission} = 3 + 12 = 15 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Final Answer:
Cayley will earn a total commission of **$15** from the sales of the newspapers.
