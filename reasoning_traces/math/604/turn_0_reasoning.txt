To solve the problem, we will break down Howard's spending day by day and then calculate how much money he has left after all his expenditures.

1. **Monday's Spending**:
   - Howard spends $8 at the arcade on Monday.
   - Amount spent on Monday = $8.

2. **Tuesday's Spending**:
   - On Tuesday, he spends twice as much as he did on Monday.
   - Amount spent on Tuesday = 2 × Amount spent on Monday = 2 × $8 = $16.

3. **Wednesday's Spending**:
   - On Wednesday, he spends 4 times as much as he spent on Tuesday.
   - Amount spent on Wednesday = 4 × Amount spent on Tuesday = 4 × $16 = $64.

4. **Total Spending**:
   - Now, we will calculate the total amount Howard spent over the three days.
   - Total spending = Amount spent on Monday + Amount spent on Tuesday + Amount spent on Wednesday
   - Total spending = $8 + $16 + $64 = $88.

5. **Calculating Remaining Money**:
   - Howard originally had $100.
   - To find out how much money he has left after his spending, we subtract the total spending from his original amount.
   - Remaining money = Original amount - Total spending
   - Remaining money = $100 - $88 = $12.

Thus, after all his spending at the arcade, Howard has **$12 left**.

Final answer: **$12**.
