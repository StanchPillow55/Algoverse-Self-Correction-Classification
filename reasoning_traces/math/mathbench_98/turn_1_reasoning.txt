==================================================

It seems like the problem statement "Sample math problem 98" is not clear or complete. To provide a meaningful solution, I need a specific math problem or question to solve. However, I can create a sample math problem based on the number 98 and solve it step by step. Let's consider the following problem:

**Problem:**
Find the prime factorization of the number 98 and determine if it is a perfect square.

**Solution:**

Step 1: **Prime Factorization of 98**

To find the prime factorization of 98, we start by dividing it by the smallest prime number, which is 2.

- 98 is even, so it is divisible by 2.
- \( 98 \div 2 = 49 \)

Now, we need to factor 49. The number 49 is not divisible by 2 (since it's odd), so we try the next smallest prime number, which is 3.

- 49 is not divisible by 3 (since the sum of the digits, 4 + 9 = 13, is not divisible by 3).

Next, we try 5. Since 49 does not end in 0 or 5, it is not divisible by 5.

Next, we try 7.

- 49 is divisible by 7.
- \( 49 \div 7 = 7 \)

Since 7 is a prime number, we have completed the factorization.

Thus, the prime factorization of 98 is:
\[ 98 = 2 \times 7 \times 7 \]
or
\[ 98 = 2 \times 7^2 \]

Step 2: **Determine if 98 is a Perfect Square**

A perfect square is a number that can be expressed as the square of an integer. For a number to be a perfect square, all the exponents in its prime factorization must be even.

The prime factorization of 98 is \( 2^1 \times 7^2 \).

- The exponent of 2 is 1, which is odd.
- The exponent of 7 is 2, which is even.

Since not all exponents are even, 98 is not a perfect square.

**Final Answer:**
The prime factorization of 98 is \( 2 \times 7^2 \), and 98 is not a perfect square.
