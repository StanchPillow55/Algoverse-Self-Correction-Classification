Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 98," we need to first understand what the problem is asking. However, the phrase "Sample math problem 98" does not provide any specific mathematical question or context. It seems like a placeholder or a reference to a specific problem that is not fully described here.

To proceed, let's assume that "Sample math problem 98" refers to a typical math problem that might be labeled as number 98 in a textbook or worksheet. Since we don't have the actual content of the problem, I'll create a hypothetical math problem and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem 98:**
Calculate the sum of the first 98 positive integers.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   We need to find the sum of the first 98 positive integers. This means we are summing the numbers from 1 to 98.

2. **Use the Formula for the Sum of an Arithmetic Series:**
   The sum \( S \) of the first \( n \) positive integers can be calculated using the formula:
   \[
   S = \frac{n(n + 1)}{2}
   \]
   where \( n \) is the number of terms. In this case, \( n = 98 \).

3. **Substitute the Value of \( n \):**
   \[
   S = \frac{98(98 + 1)}{2}
   \]

4. **Calculate Inside the Parentheses:**
   \[
   98 + 1 = 99
   \]

5. **Multiply:**
   \[
   98 \times 99 = 9702
   \]

6. **Divide by 2:**
   \[
   S = \frac{9702}{2} = 4851
   \]

7. **Final Answer:**
   The sum of the first 98 positive integers is 4851.

Therefore, the final answer to the hypothetical problem is 4851. If you have a specific "Sample math problem 98" in mind, please provide the details, and I can solve that particular problem for you.
