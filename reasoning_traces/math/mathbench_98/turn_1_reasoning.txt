==================================================

To solve the problem, we first need to understand what "Sample math problem 98" refers to. Since there is no specific problem statement provided, I'll assume this is a placeholder for a typical math problem. Let's create a sample problem based on common math topics and solve it step by step.

**Sample Math Problem 98:**

**Problem:**
Calculate the sum of the first 98 positive even numbers.

**Solution:**

1. **Identify the Sequence:**
   The sequence of the first 98 positive even numbers is: 2, 4, 6, ..., 2n, where n = 98.

2. **General Formula for the nth Even Number:**
   The nth even number can be expressed as: \( a_n = 2n \).

3. **Sum of an Arithmetic Sequence:**
   The sum \( S_n \) of the first n terms of an arithmetic sequence can be calculated using the formula:
   \[
   S_n = \frac{n}{2} \times (a_1 + a_n)
   \]
   where \( a_1 \) is the first term and \( a_n \) is the nth term.

4. **Apply the Formula:**
   - First term \( a_1 = 2 \).
   - 98th term \( a_{98} = 2 \times 98 = 196 \).

   Substitute these values into the sum formula:
   \[
   S_{98} = \frac{98}{2} \times (2 + 196)
   \]

5. **Calculate the Sum:**
   \[
   S_{98} = 49 \times 198
   \]

6. **Perform the Multiplication:**
   \[
   49 \times 198 = 49 \times (200 - 2) = 49 \times 200 - 49 \times 2
   \]
   \[
   = 9800 - 98 = 9702
   \]

Therefore, the sum of the first 98 positive even numbers is **9702**.

**Final Answer:**
9702
