It seems like the problem statement is incomplete or unclear. However, I will assume that "Sample math problem 98" refers to a generic math problem involving the number 98. Let's create a problem involving the number 98 and solve it step by step.

**Problem:**
Find the prime factorization of the number 98 and determine if it is a perfect square.

**Step 1: Prime Factorization of 98**

To find the prime factorization of 98, we need to divide it by the smallest prime numbers until we are left with 1.

1. Start with the smallest prime number, which is 2. Check if 98 is divisible by 2:
   \[
   98 \div 2 = 49
   \]
   Since 49 is an integer, 98 is divisible by 2. So, 2 is a factor.

2. Now, take the quotient 49 and check for divisibility by the next smallest prime number, which is 3. Since 49 is not divisible by 3 (as the sum of the digits, 4 + 9 = 13, is not divisible by 3), we move to the next prime number, which is 5. 49 is not divisible by 5 either (as it does not end in 0 or 5).

3. Check divisibility by the next prime number, which is 7:
   \[
   49 \div 7 = 7
   \]
   Since 7 is an integer, 49 is divisible by 7. So, 7 is a factor.

4. Now, take the quotient 7 and check for divisibility by 7:
   \[
   7 \div 7 = 1
   \]
   We have reached 1, so we stop here.

Thus, the prime factorization of 98 is:
\[
98 = 2 \times 7 \times 7 = 2 \times 7^2
\]

**Step 2: Determine if 98 is a Perfect Square**

A perfect square is a number that can be expressed as the square of an integer. For 98 to be a perfect square, all the exponents in its prime factorization must be even.

From the prime factorization \(98 = 2 \times 7^2\), we see that the exponent of 2 is 1 (which is odd), and the exponent of 7 is 2 (which is even). Since not all exponents are even, 98 is not a perfect square.

**Final Answer:**

The prime factorization of 98 is \(2 \times 7^2\). The number 98 is not a perfect square.
