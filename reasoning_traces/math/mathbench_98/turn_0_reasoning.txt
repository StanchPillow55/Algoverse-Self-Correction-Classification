==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 98," we need to first understand what the problem is asking. However, since "Sample math problem 98" is not a specific math problem, I'll create a hypothetical math problem involving the number 98 and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**
Calculate the sum of all prime numbers less than 98.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Identify Prime Numbers Less Than 98:**
   A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. We need to list all prime numbers less than 98.

   - Start with the smallest prime number, which is 2.
   - Check each subsequent number to see if it is divisible only by 1 and itself.

   Prime numbers less than 98 are:
   2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97.

2. **Sum the Prime Numbers:**
   Add all the identified prime numbers together.

   \[
   \begin{align*}
   &2 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 11 + 13 + 17 + 19 + 23 + 29 + 31 + 37 + 41 + 43 + 47 + 53 + 59 + 61 + 67 + 71 + 73 + 79 + 83 + 89 + 97 \\
   &= 1060.
   \end{align*}
   \]

3. **Verify the Calculation:**
   To ensure accuracy, let's break the addition into smaller parts and verify:

   - Sum of first ten primes: \(2 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 11 + 13 + 17 + 19 + 23 + 29 = 129\)
   - Sum of next ten primes: \(31 + 37 + 41 + 43 + 47 + 53 + 59 + 61 + 67 + 71 = 510\)
   - Sum of remaining primes: \(73 + 79 + 83 + 89 + 97 = 421\)

   Adding these partial sums:
   \[
   129 + 510 + 421 = 1060.
   \]

**Final Answer:**
The sum of all prime numbers less than 98 is 1060.
