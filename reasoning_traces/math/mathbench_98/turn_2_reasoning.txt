Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 98," we first need to understand what the problem is asking. However, the phrase "Sample math problem 98" is not specific enough to determine the exact nature of the problem. It could refer to a specific problem from a textbook or a set of problems, but without additional context, we cannot proceed with solving it.

To demonstrate a complete problem-solving process, let's assume a hypothetical math problem involving the number 98. For example, let's solve the problem: "What is the prime factorization of 98?"

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We need to find the prime factorization of the number 98. Prime factorization involves expressing a number as a product of its prime factors.

2. **Identify the Smallest Prime Factor:**
   - Start by checking the smallest prime number, which is 2. Since 98 is an even number, it is divisible by 2.

3. **Divide by the Smallest Prime Factor:**
   - Divide 98 by 2:
     \[
     98 \div 2 = 49
     \]
   - So, 98 can be expressed as \(2 \times 49\).

4. **Factor the Resulting Quotient:**
   - Now, we need to factor 49. Check the smallest prime number, 2. Since 49 is odd, it is not divisible by 2. Move to the next prime number, which is 3. The sum of the digits of 49 is 13, which is not divisible by 3, so 49 is not divisible by 3. The next prime number is 5, but 49 does not end in 0 or 5, so it is not divisible by 5. The next prime number is 7.

5. **Check Divisibility by 7:**
   - Divide 49 by 7:
     \[
     49 \div 7 = 7
     \]
   - So, 49 can be expressed as \(7 \times 7\).

6. **Write the Complete Prime Factorization:**
   - Combine all the factors found:
     \[
     98 = 2 \times 7 \times 7
     \]
   - This can also be written as:
     \[
     98 = 2 \times 7^2
     \]

7. **Verify the Solution:**
   - Multiply the prime factors to ensure they equal the original number:
     \[
     2 \times 7 \times 7 = 2 \times 49 = 98
     \]
   - The calculation is correct.

### Final Answer:
The prime factorization of 98 is \(2 \times 7^2\).
