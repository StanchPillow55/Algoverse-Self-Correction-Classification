==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 98," we need to first understand what the problem is asking. However, the problem statement is not clear or specific. Since "Sample math problem 98" does not provide any details or context, I will assume this is a placeholder or a reference to a specific problem that is not fully described here.

To proceed, I'll create a hypothetical math problem involving the number 98 and solve it step by step. Let's assume the problem is as follows:

**Problem:**  
Find the prime factorization of the number 98.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understanding Prime Factorization:**
   Prime factorization involves expressing a number as a product of its prime factors. A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.

2. **Start with the Smallest Prime Number:**
   Begin by dividing the number by the smallest prime number, which is 2. Check if 98 is divisible by 2.

   \[
   98 \div 2 = 49
   \]

   Since 98 is divisible by 2, 2 is a prime factor.

3. **Continue with the Resulting Quotient:**
   Now, take the quotient (49) and check if it is divisible by the next smallest prime number. Since 49 is not even, it is not divisible by 2. The next prime number is 3, but 49 is not divisible by 3 either. Continue with the next prime number, which is 5, and then 7.

   \[
   49 \div 7 = 7
   \]

   Since 49 is divisible by 7, 7 is a prime factor. The quotient is 7, which is also a prime number.

4. **Complete the Factorization:**
   Since the quotient is now a prime number (7), the factorization process is complete.

5. **Write the Prime Factorization:**
   The prime factorization of 98 is the product of all the prime factors we found:

   \[
   98 = 2 \times 7 \times 7
   \]

   Alternatively, this can be expressed using exponents for repeated factors:

   \[
   98 = 2 \times 7^2
   \]

**Final Answer:**
The prime factorization of 98 is \(2 \times 7^2\).
