==================================================

It seems like you've referenced a "Sample reasoning question 403," but without the specific details of the question, I can't provide a solution. However, I can guide you on how to approach solving a math problem step by step. If you provide the specific details of the problem, I can give a more precise solution. Here's a general approach to solving math problems:

### Step-by-Step Approach to Solving Math Problems

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - Carefully read the problem statement.
   - Identify what is being asked.
   - Note down any given information and data.

2. **Devise a Plan:**
   - Think about the mathematical concepts that might apply (e.g., algebra, geometry, calculus).
   - Consider similar problems you have solved before.
   - Decide on a strategy to solve the problem (e.g., drawing a diagram, setting up an equation).

3. **Carry Out the Plan:**
   - Execute your strategy step by step.
   - Perform calculations carefully.
   - Keep track of units and conversions if applicable.

4. **Check Your Work:**
   - Review each step to ensure there are no errors.
   - Verify that your solution makes sense in the context of the problem.
   - Check your calculations for accuracy.

5. **State the Final Answer:**
   - Clearly write down the final answer.
   - Include units if necessary.
   - Ensure the answer addresses the question posed.

### Example Problem

Let's say the problem is: "Solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \)."

**Step 1: Understand the Problem**
- We need to find the value of \( x \) that satisfies the equation.

**Step 2: Devise a Plan**
- We can solve this linear equation by isolating \( x \).

**Step 3: Carry Out the Plan**
- Start with the equation: \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).
- Subtract 3 from both sides to isolate the term with \( x \):
  \[
  2x + 3 - 3 = 11 - 3 \implies 2x = 8
  \]
- Divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( x \):
  \[
  \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{8}{2} \implies x = 4
  \]

**Step 4: Check Your Work**
- Substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation to verify:
  \[
  2(4) + 3 = 8 + 3 = 11
  \]
- The left side equals the right side, confirming our solution is correct.

**Step 5: State the Final Answer**
- The solution to the equation is \( x = 4 \).
