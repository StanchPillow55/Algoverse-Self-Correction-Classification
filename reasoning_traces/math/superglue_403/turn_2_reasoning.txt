==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 403" entails. Since the question is not specified, I'll assume it's a placeholder for a generic math problem. Let's create a hypothetical math problem and solve it step-by-step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**

A company produces two types of products, A and B. The profit from each unit of product A is $3, and the profit from each unit of product B is $5. The company can produce a maximum of 100 units of product A and 80 units of product B per day. However, due to resource constraints, the total production of products A and B combined cannot exceed 150 units per day. How many units of each product should the company produce to maximize profit?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( x \) be the number of units of product A produced.
   - Let \( y \) be the number of units of product B produced.

2. **Objective Function:**
   - The profit function \( P \) is given by:
     \[
     P = 3x + 5y
     \]
   - We want to maximize \( P \).

3. **Constraints:**
   - \( x \leq 100 \) (cannot produce more than 100 units of A)
   - \( y \leq 80 \) (cannot produce more than 80 units of B)
   - \( x + y \leq 150 \) (total production constraint)
   - \( x \geq 0 \) and \( y \geq 0 \) (non-negativity constraints)

4. **Graphical Solution:**
   - Plot the constraints on a graph with \( x \) on the horizontal axis and \( y \) on the vertical axis.
   - The feasible region is the area that satisfies all constraints.

5. **Identify Corner Points:**
   - The corner points of the feasible region are where the lines intersect:
     - Intersection of \( x = 100 \) and \( x + y = 150 \): \( (100, 50) \)
     - Intersection of \( y = 80 \) and \( x + y = 150 \): \( (70, 80) \)
     - Intersection of \( x = 0 \) and \( x + y = 150 \): \( (0, 80) \)
     - Intersection of \( y = 0 \) and \( x + y = 150 \): \( (100, 0) \)

6. **Evaluate the Objective Function at Each Corner Point:**
   - \( P(100, 50) = 3(100) + 5(50) = 300 + 250 = 550 \)
   - \( P(70, 80) = 3(70) + 5(80) = 210 + 400 = 610 \)
   - \( P(0, 80) = 3(0) + 5(80) = 0 + 400 = 400 \)
   - \( P(100, 0) = 3(100) + 5(0) = 300 + 0 = 300 \)

7. **Determine the Maximum Profit:**
   - The maximum profit occurs at the point \( (70, 80) \) with a profit of 610.

**Final Answer:**
To maximize profit, the company should produce 70 units of product A and 80 units of product B, resulting in a maximum profit of $610.
