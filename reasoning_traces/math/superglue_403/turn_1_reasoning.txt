==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 403" refers to. Since the problem statement is not clear and lacks specific details, let's assume it is a placeholder for a typical math problem. Without specific details, I will create a hypothetical math problem and solve it step by step.

Let's assume the problem is as follows:

**Problem:**  
A rectangle has a length that is 3 times its width. If the perimeter of the rectangle is 48 units, find the dimensions of the rectangle.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We have a rectangle with a length (L) and a width (W).
   - The length is 3 times the width: \( L = 3W \).
   - The perimeter of the rectangle is 48 units.

2. **Recall the Formula for Perimeter:**
   - The perimeter (P) of a rectangle is given by the formula:  
     \[ P = 2L + 2W \]

3. **Substitute the Known Values:**
   - We know the perimeter is 48 units, so:  
     \[ 2L + 2W = 48 \]

4. **Substitute the Expression for L:**
   - Since \( L = 3W \), substitute this into the perimeter equation:  
     \[ 2(3W) + 2W = 48 \]

5. **Simplify the Equation:**
   - Distribute and combine like terms:  
     \[ 6W + 2W = 48 \]  
     \[ 8W = 48 \]

6. **Solve for W:**
   - Divide both sides by 8 to find W:  
     \[ W = \frac{48}{8} \]  
     \[ W = 6 \]

7. **Find the Length L:**
   - Since \( L = 3W \), substitute W = 6:  
     \[ L = 3 \times 6 \]  
     \[ L = 18 \]

8. **Verify the Solution:**
   - Check the perimeter with these dimensions:  
     \[ P = 2L + 2W = 2(18) + 2(6) = 36 + 12 = 48 \]
   - The calculated perimeter matches the given perimeter, confirming our solution is correct.

**Final Answer:**
The dimensions of the rectangle are a width of 6 units and a length of 18 units.
