==================================================

To solve the problem, I need more information about what "Sample math problem 263" entails. Since I don't have access to external databases or specific problem sets, I'll demonstrate how to solve a generic math problem step by step. If you have a specific problem in mind, please provide the details, and I'll be happy to help solve it.

For now, let's consider a sample math problem:

**Problem:** Solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).

**Step-by-step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Equation:**
   The equation given is \( 2x + 3 = 11 \). Our goal is to solve for \( x \), which means we need to isolate \( x \) on one side of the equation.

2. **Subtract 3 from Both Sides:**
   To begin isolating \( x \), we first need to eliminate the constant term on the left side of the equation. We do this by subtracting 3 from both sides:
   \[
   2x + 3 - 3 = 11 - 3
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   2x = 8
   \]

3. **Divide Both Sides by 2:**
   Now, to solve for \( x \), we need to divide both sides of the equation by 2, which is the coefficient of \( x \):
   \[
   \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{8}{2}
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   x = 4
   \]

4. **Verify the Solution:**
   It's always a good practice to verify the solution by substituting it back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies the equation:
   \[
   2(4) + 3 = 11
   \]
   Simplifying the left side:
   \[
   8 + 3 = 11
   \]
   Since both sides of the equation are equal, our solution is verified.

**Final Answer:**
The solution to the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \) is \( x = 4 \).

If you have a specific problem or a different type of math problem in mind, please provide the details, and I'll be glad to assist you further.
