==================================================

To solve the problem effectively, I need to know the specific details of "Sample math problem 263." Since I don't have access to external databases or specific problem sets, I'll create a sample math problem and solve it step by step. 

Let's assume "Sample math problem 263" is the following:

**Problem:**
Solve for \( x \) in the equation:
\[ 3x + 5 = 2x + 9 \]

**Step-by-step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Equation:**
   The equation given is a linear equation in one variable, \( x \). Our goal is to isolate \( x \) on one side of the equation to find its value.

2. **Simplify the Equation:**
   Start by getting all terms containing \( x \) on one side of the equation and constant terms on the other side. We can do this by subtracting \( 2x \) from both sides:
   \[
   3x + 5 - 2x = 2x + 9 - 2x
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   x + 5 = 9
   \]

3. **Isolate \( x \):**
   Next, subtract 5 from both sides to solve for \( x \):
   \[
   x + 5 - 5 = 9 - 5
   \]
   Simplifying this gives:
   \[
   x = 4
   \]

4. **Verify the Solution:**
   Substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies the equation:
   \[
   3(4) + 5 = 2(4) + 9
   \]
   Calculate both sides:
   \[
   12 + 5 = 8 + 9
   \]
   \[
   17 = 17
   \]
   Since both sides are equal, our solution \( x = 4 \) is verified.

**Final Answer:**
The solution to the equation \( 3x + 5 = 2x + 9 \) is \( x = 4 \).
