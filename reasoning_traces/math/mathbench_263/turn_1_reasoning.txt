==================================================

To solve the problem, we first need to understand what "Sample math problem 263" refers to. Since the problem itself is not provided, I will create a hypothetical math problem labeled as "Sample math problem 263" and solve it step by step.

**Sample Math Problem 263:**

"Calculate the sum of the first 50 positive even numbers."

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Identify the Sequence:**
   - The sequence of the first 50 positive even numbers is: 2, 4, 6, 8, ..., up to the 50th term.
   - This is an arithmetic sequence where the first term \( a_1 = 2 \) and the common difference \( d = 2 \).

2. **Find the 50th Term:**
   - The formula for the \( n \)-th term of an arithmetic sequence is:
     \[
     a_n = a_1 + (n-1) \cdot d
     \]
   - For the 50th term (\( n = 50 \)):
     \[
     a_{50} = 2 + (50-1) \cdot 2 = 2 + 98 = 100
     \]

3. **Calculate the Sum of the Sequence:**
   - The formula for the sum \( S_n \) of the first \( n \) terms of an arithmetic sequence is:
     \[
     S_n = \frac{n}{2} \cdot (a_1 + a_n)
     \]
   - Substitute the known values (\( n = 50 \), \( a_1 = 2 \), \( a_{50} = 100 \)):
     \[
     S_{50} = \frac{50}{2} \cdot (2 + 100) = 25 \cdot 102 = 2550
     \]

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The sum of the first 50 positive even numbers is 2550.

**Final Answer:**

The sum of the first 50 positive even numbers is 2550.
