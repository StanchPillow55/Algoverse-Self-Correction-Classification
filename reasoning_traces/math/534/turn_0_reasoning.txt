==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to break it down step by step.

1. **Understanding the Group Composition**:
   - There are 20 kids in total.
   - They are divided into two equal groups of girls and boys.
   - Therefore, there are 10 boys and 10 girls.

2. **Calculating the Total Shells Brought by Boys**:
   - Each boy brought back 60 shells.
   - Since there are 10 boys, the total number of shells brought back by the boys is:
     \[
     \text{Total shells by boys} = 10 \text{ boys} \times 60 \text{ shells/boy} = 600 \text{ shells}
     \]

3. **Understanding the Girls' Contribution**:
   - According to the problem, the girls brought back an amount equal to the number of shells brought by the boys plus four times as many seashells as the boys.
   - The amount equal to the number of shells brought by the boys is 600 shells.
   - Four times the number of shells brought by the boys is:
     \[
     4 \times 600 = 2400 \text{ shells}
     \]

4. **Calculating the Total Shells Brought by Girls**:
   - Therefore, the total number of shells brought back by the girls is:
     \[
     \text{Total shells by girls} = 600 + 2400 = 3000 \text{ shells}
     \]

5. **Calculating the Number of Shells Brought by Each Girl**:
   - Since there are 10 girls, the number of shells brought back by each girl is:
     \[
     \text{Shells per girl} = \frac{\text{Total shells by girls}}{\text{Number of girls}} = \frac{3000 \text{ shells}}{10 \text{ girls}} = 300 \text{ shells/girl}
     \]

6. **Final Answer**:
   - Each girl brought back **300 seashells**.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{300}
\]
