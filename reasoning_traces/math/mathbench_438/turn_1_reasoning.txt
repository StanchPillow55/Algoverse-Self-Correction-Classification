Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, I need to first understand what "Sample math problem 438" refers to. Since I don't have access to external databases or specific problem sets, I'll create a hypothetical math problem labeled as "Sample math problem 438" and solve it step-by-step.

Let's assume "Sample math problem 438" is as follows:

**Problem:**
Solve for \( x \) in the equation:
\[ 3x + 5 = 2x - 7 \]

**Step-by-step Solution:**

1. **Identify the equation:**
   The given equation is:
   \[ 3x + 5 = 2x - 7 \]

2. **Isolate the variable \( x \):**
   To solve for \( x \), we need to get all terms involving \( x \) on one side of the equation and the constant terms on the other side.

3. **Subtract \( 2x \) from both sides:**
   \[ 3x + 5 - 2x = 2x - 7 - 2x \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[ x + 5 = -7 \]

4. **Subtract 5 from both sides:**
   \[ x + 5 - 5 = -7 - 5 \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[ x = -12 \]

5. **Verify the solution:**
   Substitute \( x = -12 \) back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies the equation:
   \[ 3(-12) + 5 = 2(-12) - 7 \]
   Simplifying both sides:
   \[ -36 + 5 = -24 - 7 \]
   \[ -31 = -31 \]
   Since both sides are equal, the solution is verified.

**Final Answer:**
The solution to the equation \( 3x + 5 = 2x - 7 \) is \( x = -12 \).
