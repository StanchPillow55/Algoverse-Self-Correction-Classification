==================================================

To solve the problem labeled "Sample reasoning question 365," we need to first understand what the problem is asking. However, since the problem statement is not provided, I'll demonstrate how to approach a generic math problem by outlining a step-by-step reasoning process. Let's assume a sample math problem for demonstration purposes:

**Sample Problem:**
Calculate the area of a triangle with a base of 10 units and a height of 5 units.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We need to find the area of a triangle.
   - We are given the base (\(b\)) of the triangle as 10 units.
   - We are given the height (\(h\)) of the triangle as 5 units.

2. **Recall the Formula:**
   - The formula for the area (\(A\)) of a triangle is:
     \[
     A = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height}
     \]

3. **Substitute the Given Values:**
   - Substitute the base (\(b = 10\)) and height (\(h = 5\)) into the formula:
     \[
     A = \frac{1}{2} \times 10 \times 5
     \]

4. **Perform the Calculations:**
   - First, multiply the base and height:
     \[
     10 \times 5 = 50
     \]
   - Then, multiply by \(\frac{1}{2}\):
     \[
     A = \frac{1}{2} \times 50 = 25
     \]

5. **State the Final Answer:**
   - The area of the triangle is 25 square units.

By following these steps, we have calculated the area of the triangle using the given dimensions. This process involves understanding the problem, recalling the relevant formula, substituting the given values, performing the calculations, and stating the final answer. If you have a specific problem labeled "Sample reasoning question 365," please provide the details, and I can work through that specific problem for you.
