==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 365" refers to. Since the question is not explicitly stated, I'll assume it is a placeholder for a typical math problem. Let's create a sample math problem and solve it step-by-step.

**Sample Math Problem:**

A car travels from City A to City B at a speed of 60 miles per hour. The distance between the two cities is 180 miles. After reaching City B, the car immediately returns to City A at a speed of 90 miles per hour. What is the average speed of the car for the entire journey?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - The car travels from City A to City B and back to City A.
   - The distance from City A to City B is 180 miles.
   - The speed from City A to City B is 60 mph.
   - The speed from City B back to City A is 90 mph.
   - We need to find the average speed for the entire journey.

2. **Calculate the Time for Each Leg of the Journey:**
   - **Time from City A to City B:**
     \[
     \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{180 \text{ miles}}{60 \text{ mph}} = 3 \text{ hours}
     \]

   - **Time from City B to City A:**
     \[
     \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{180 \text{ miles}}{90 \text{ mph}} = 2 \text{ hours}
     \]

3. **Calculate the Total Distance and Total Time:**
   - **Total Distance:**
     \[
     \text{Total Distance} = 180 \text{ miles} + 180 \text{ miles} = 360 \text{ miles}
     \]

   - **Total Time:**
     \[
     \text{Total Time} = 3 \text{ hours} + 2 \text{ hours} = 5 \text{ hours}
     \]

4. **Calculate the Average Speed:**
   - The average speed is given by the total distance divided by the total time.
     \[
     \text{Average Speed} = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Total Time}} = \frac{360 \text{ miles}}{5 \text{ hours}} = 72 \text{ mph}
     \]

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The average speed of the car for the entire journey is 72 miles per hour.

**Final Answer:**
The average speed of the car for the entire journey is 72 mph.
