==================================================

To solve the problem effectively, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 365" refers to. Since the problem statement is not explicitly provided, I'll assume this is a placeholder for a typical math problem. Let's create a hypothetical problem and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**

A company produces two types of products, A and B. The profit from each unit of product A is $5, and the profit from each unit of product B is $7. The company can produce a maximum of 100 units of product A and 80 units of product B per day. However, due to resource constraints, the total production of products A and B combined cannot exceed 150 units per day. Determine the optimal production quantities of products A and B to maximize profit.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( x \) be the number of units of product A produced per day.
   - Let \( y \) be the number of units of product B produced per day.

2. **Objective Function:**
   - The profit function \( P \) to be maximized is given by:
     \[
     P = 5x + 7y
     \]

3. **Constraints:**
   - The production constraints are:
     \[
     x \leq 100 \quad \text{(Product A production limit)}
     \]
     \[
     y \leq 80 \quad \text{(Product B production limit)}
     \]
     \[
     x + y \leq 150 \quad \text{(Total production limit)}
     \]
   - Non-negativity constraints:
     \[
     x \geq 0, \quad y \geq 0
     \]

4. **Graphical Solution Method:**
   - Plot the constraints on a graph with \( x \) on the horizontal axis and \( y \) on the vertical axis.
   - The feasible region is the area that satisfies all the constraints.

5. **Identify Corner Points:**
   - The corner points of the feasible region are determined by the intersections of the constraint lines:
     - Intersection of \( x = 100 \) and \( x + y = 150 \): \( (100, 50) \)
     - Intersection of \( y = 80 \) and \( x + y = 150 \): \( (70, 80) \)
     - Intersection of \( x = 0 \) and \( x + y = 150 \): \( (0, 80) \)
     - Intersection of \( y = 0 \) and \( x + y = 150 \): \( (100, 0) \)

6. **Evaluate the Objective Function at Each Corner Point:**
   - \( P(100, 50) = 5(100) + 7(50) = 500 + 350 = 850 \)
   - \( P(70, 80) = 5(70) + 7(80) = 350 + 560 = 910 \)
   - \( P(0, 80) = 5(0) + 7(80) = 0 + 560 = 560 \)
   - \( P(100, 0) = 5(100) + 7(0) = 500 + 0 = 500 \)

7. **Determine the Maximum Profit:**
   - The maximum profit occurs at the point \( (70, 80) \) with a profit of $910.

**Final Answer:**

To maximize profit, the company should produce 70 units of product A and 80 units of product B per day, resulting in a maximum profit of $910.
