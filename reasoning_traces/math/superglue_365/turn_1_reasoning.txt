==================================================

To solve the problem effectively, we need to first understand what the question is asking. However, the question provided, "Sample reasoning question 365," is not specific enough to determine what mathematical problem needs to be solved. Without additional context or details, it's impossible to provide a step-by-step solution or a final answer.

To proceed, let's assume that "Sample reasoning question 365" refers to a hypothetical math problem. I'll create a sample problem and solve it step-by-step.

**Sample Problem:**

Let's assume the problem is: "If a car travels at a constant speed of 60 miles per hour, how long will it take to travel 365 miles?"

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Identify the Given Information:**
   - Speed of the car = 60 miles per hour
   - Distance to be traveled = 365 miles

2. **Determine the Formula to Use:**
   - We can use the formula for time, which is:
     \[
     \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}}
     \]

3. **Substitute the Given Values into the Formula:**
   - Plug in the values for distance and speed:
     \[
     \text{Time} = \frac{365 \text{ miles}}{60 \text{ miles per hour}}
     \]

4. **Perform the Calculation:**
   - Divide 365 by 60:
     \[
     \text{Time} = \frac{365}{60} \approx 6.0833 \text{ hours}
     \]

5. **Interpret the Result:**
   - The car will take approximately 6.0833 hours to travel 365 miles at a constant speed of 60 miles per hour.

6. **Convert the Decimal to Minutes (if needed):**
   - To convert the decimal part of the hours to minutes, multiply by 60:
     \[
     0.0833 \times 60 \approx 5 \text{ minutes}
     \]
   - Therefore, the time taken is approximately 6 hours and 5 minutes.

**Final Answer:**
The car will take approximately 6 hours and 5 minutes to travel 365 miles at a speed of 60 miles per hour.
