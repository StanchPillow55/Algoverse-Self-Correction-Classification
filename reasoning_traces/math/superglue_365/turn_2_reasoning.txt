==================================================

To solve the problem effectively, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 365" refers to. Since the problem statement is not explicitly provided, I will assume that this is a placeholder for a typical math problem. Without specific details, I'll demonstrate how to approach a generic math problem using logical reasoning and step-by-step calculations.

Let's assume "Sample reasoning question 365" is a typical algebra problem. Here's a hypothetical problem and how we would solve it:

**Problem:**
Solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Equation:**
   The equation given is \( 2x + 3 = 11 \). This is a linear equation in one variable, \( x \).

2. **Isolate the Variable:**
   To solve for \( x \), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We can do this by performing operations that will simplify the equation.

3. **Subtract 3 from Both Sides:**
   To remove the constant term on the left side, subtract 3 from both sides of the equation:
   \[
   2x + 3 - 3 = 11 - 3
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   2x = 8
   \]

4. **Divide by 2:**
   Now, divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( x \):
   \[
   \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{8}{2}
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   x = 4
   \]

5. **Verify the Solution:**
   Substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies the equation:
   \[
   2(4) + 3 = 11
   \]
   Simplifying the left side gives:
   \[
   8 + 3 = 11
   \]
   Since both sides of the equation are equal, our solution is verified.

**Final Answer:**
The solution to the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \) is \( x = 4 \).

This approach demonstrates a clear, logical process for solving a linear equation. If "Sample reasoning question 365" refers to a different type of problem, please provide more details for a tailored solution.
