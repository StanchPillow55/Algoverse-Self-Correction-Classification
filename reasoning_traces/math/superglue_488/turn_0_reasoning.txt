==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 488" entails. Since the question is not explicitly defined, I'll create a hypothetical math problem that could be labeled as such. Let's assume "Sample reasoning question 488" is a typical math problem involving algebraic reasoning. Here's a possible problem and its solution:

**Problem:**

Solve for \( x \) in the equation:

\[ 3(x - 4) + 2 = 2x + 10 \]

**Solution:**

To solve this equation, we will follow these steps:

1. **Distribute the 3 on the left side of the equation:**

   \[
   3(x - 4) + 2 = 2x + 10
   \]

   Distribute the 3:

   \[
   3 \cdot x - 3 \cdot 4 + 2 = 2x + 10
   \]

   Simplify:

   \[
   3x - 12 + 2 = 2x + 10
   \]

   Combine like terms on the left side:

   \[
   3x - 10 = 2x + 10
   \]

2. **Isolate the variable \( x \):**

   To isolate \( x \), we need to get all terms involving \( x \) on one side and constant terms on the other side. Subtract \( 2x \) from both sides:

   \[
   3x - 2x - 10 = 10
   \]

   Simplify:

   \[
   x - 10 = 10
   \]

   Add 10 to both sides to solve for \( x \):

   \[
   x - 10 + 10 = 10 + 10
   \]

   Simplify:

   \[
   x = 20
   \]

3. **Verify the solution:**

   Substitute \( x = 20 \) back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies the equation:

   \[
   3(20 - 4) + 2 = 2(20) + 10
   \]

   Simplify both sides:

   Left side:

   \[
   3(16) + 2 = 48 + 2 = 50
   \]

   Right side:

   \[
   40 + 10 = 50
   \]

   Since both sides are equal, \( x = 20 \) is indeed the correct solution.

**Final Answer:**

The solution to the equation \( 3(x - 4) + 2 = 2x + 10 \) is \( x = 20 \).
