Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 488" refers to. Since the question itself is not explicitly provided, let's assume that it involves a typical math problem-solving scenario. I'll create a hypothetical math problem and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**

Calculate the value of \( x \) in the equation:

\[ 3x + 5 = 20 \]

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Equation:**
   - We have a linear equation in one variable, \( x \).
   - The equation is \( 3x + 5 = 20 \).

2. **Isolate the Variable:**
   - To solve for \( x \), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation.
   - Start by eliminating the constant term on the left side. We do this by subtracting 5 from both sides of the equation:

     \[
     3x + 5 - 5 = 20 - 5
     \]

   - Simplifying both sides gives:

     \[
     3x = 15
     \]

3. **Solve for \( x \):**
   - Now, divide both sides of the equation by 3 to solve for \( x \):

     \[
     \frac{3x}{3} = \frac{15}{3}
     \]

   - Simplifying both sides gives:

     \[
     x = 5
     \]

4. **Verify the Solution:**
   - Substitute \( x = 5 \) back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies the equation:

     \[
     3(5) + 5 = 20
     \]

   - Simplifying the left side:

     \[
     15 + 5 = 20
     \]

   - Since both sides of the equation are equal, \( x = 5 \) is indeed the correct solution.

**Final Answer:**

The value of \( x \) is \( 5 \).
