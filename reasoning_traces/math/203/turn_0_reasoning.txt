==================================================

To find out how much each candy bar cost, we can start by breaking down the information given in the problem.

1. **Identify the costs of the soft drinks:**
   Benny bought 2 soft drinks for $4 each. 
   \[
   \text{Total cost of soft drinks} = 2 \times 4 = 8 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Determine the total amount spent on candy bars:**
   Benny spent a total of $28. We can find out how much he spent on candy bars by subtracting the cost of the soft drinks from the total amount spent.
   \[
   \text{Total spent on candy bars} = \text{Total spent} - \text{Total cost of soft drinks}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total spent on candy bars} = 28 - 8 = 20 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Calculate the cost per candy bar:**
   Benny bought 5 candy bars for a total of $20. To find the cost of each candy bar, we divide the total spent on candy bars by the number of candy bars.
   \[
   \text{Cost per candy bar} = \frac{\text{Total spent on candy bars}}{\text{Number of candy bars}}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Cost per candy bar} = \frac{20}{5} = 4 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Final answer:**
   Each candy bar costs **$4**.

Thus, the final answer is that each candy bar costs **$4**.
