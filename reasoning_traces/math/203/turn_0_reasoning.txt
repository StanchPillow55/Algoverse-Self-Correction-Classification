==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine the cost of each candy bar given the total amount Benny spent and the cost of the soft drinks.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the known quantities:**
   - Benny bought 2 soft drinks, each costing $4.
   - Benny bought 5 candy bars.
   - The total amount spent was $28.

2. **Calculate the total cost of the soft drinks:**
   - Each soft drink costs $4.
   - Benny bought 2 soft drinks.
   - Therefore, the total cost for the soft drinks is:
     \[
     2 \times 4 = 8 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Determine the remaining amount spent on candy bars:**
   - The total amount spent was $28.
   - The amount spent on soft drinks was $8.
   - Therefore, the amount spent on candy bars is:
     \[
     28 - 8 = 20 \text{ dollars}
     \]

4. **Calculate the cost of each candy bar:**
   - Benny bought 5 candy bars.
   - The total cost for the candy bars is $20.
   - To find the cost of each candy bar, divide the total cost of the candy bars by the number of candy bars:
     \[
     \frac{20}{5} = 4 \text{ dollars per candy bar}
     \]

5. **Conclusion:**
   - Each candy bar costs $4.

Therefore, the final answer is that each candy bar costs $4.
