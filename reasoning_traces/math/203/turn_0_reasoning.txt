To find out how many slices of cheese Carl used in total for the week, we will break down the problem into parts based on the meals he had.

1. **Cheese in Sandwiches:**
   - Carl ate a sandwich every day for lunch for a week (7 days).
   - Each sandwich used 2 slices of cheese.
   - Therefore, the total slices of cheese used for sandwiches can be calculated as follows:
     \[
     \text{Total slices for sandwiches} = \text{Number of days} \times \text{Slices per sandwich} = 7 \times 2 = 14 \text{ slices}
     \]

2. **Cheese in Omelets:**
   - Carl had cheese and egg omelets for breakfast for 3 days.
   - Each omelet used one more slice of cheese than his sandwiches. Since each sandwich uses 2 slices, each omelet uses:
     \[
     2 + 1 = 3 \text{ slices}
     \]
   - Therefore, the total slices of cheese used for omelets can be calculated as follows:
     \[
     \text{Total slices for omelets} = \text{Number of days} \times \text{Slices per omelet} = 3 \times 3 = 9 \text{ slices}
     \]

3. **Cheese in Macaroni and Cheese:**
   - Carl made a big dish of macaroni and cheese and used 8 slices of cheese in it.
   - Therefore, the total slices of cheese used for macaroni and cheese is simply:
     \[
     8 \text{ slices}
     \]

4. **Total Cheese Used:**
   - Now, we will add up all the slices of cheese used in each meal to find the total:
     \[
     \text{Total cheese used} = \text{Total slices for sandwiches} + \text{Total slices for omelets} + \text{Total slices for macaroni and cheese}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total cheese used} = 14 + 9 + 8 = 31 \text{ slices}
     \]

Thus, the total number of slices of cheese Carl used during the week is \( \boxed{31} \).
