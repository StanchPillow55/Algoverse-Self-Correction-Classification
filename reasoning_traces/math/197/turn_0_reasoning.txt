==================================================

To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the number of people in each group**:
   - There are 16 people at the dinner party.
   - Half of the people eat 1 1/2 rolls each, and the other half eat 1/2 a roll each.
   - Half of 16 is \( \frac{16}{2} = 8 \).
   - Therefore, there are 8 people in each group.

2. **Calculate the total number of rolls consumed by the first group**:
   - The first group consists of 8 people, and each person eats 1 1/2 rolls.
   - The total number of rolls consumed by this group is:
     \[
     8 \text{ people} \times 1.5 \text{ rolls/person} = 12 \text{ rolls}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total number of rolls consumed by the second group**:
   - The second group also consists of 8 people, and each person eats 1/2 a roll.
   - The total number of rolls consumed by this group is:
     \[
     8 \text{ people} \times 0.5 \text{ rolls/person} = 4 \text{ rolls}
     \]

4. **Calculate the total number of rolls consumed by all people**:
   - Now, we add the rolls consumed by both groups:
     \[
     12 \text{ rolls} + 4 \text{ rolls} = 16 \text{ rolls}
     \]

5. **Determine the number of rolls leftover**:
   - We started with 40 dinner rolls. To find out how many are left after consumption, we subtract the total rolls consumed from the initial amount:
     \[
     40 \text{ rolls} - 16 \text{ rolls} = 24 \text{ rolls}
     \]

Thus, the final answer is that there are **24 dinner rolls leftover**.
