Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To find the number of children in the city of Soda, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Identify the total population**: The total number of inhabitants in Soda is given as 23,786.

2. **Identify the number of men and women**: 
   - The number of men is 8,417.
   - The number of women is 9,092.

3. **Calculate the total number of adults (men and women)**:
   To find the total number of adults, we add the number of men and women together:
   \[
   \text{Total adults} = \text{Number of men} + \text{Number of women}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total adults} = 8417 + 9092
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total adults} = 17509
   \]

4. **Calculate the number of children**:
   To find the number of children, we subtract the total number of adults from the total population:
   \[
   \text{Number of children} = \text{Total population} - \text{Total adults}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Number of children} = 23786 - 17509
   \]
   \[
   \text{Number of children} = 6277
   \]

5. **Final answer**:
   The number of children in the city of Soda is \( \boxed{6277} \).
