To solve this problem, we need to determine how many dinner rolls are consumed by the people at the dinner party and then subtract that number from the total number of dinner rolls available to find out how many are leftover.

### Step-by-step Solution:

1. **Determine the number of people in each group:**
   - There are 16 people at the dinner party.
   - Half of the people eat 1 1/2 rolls each, and the other half eat 1/2 a roll each.
   - Since half of 16 is 8, there are 8 people in each group.

2. **Calculate the total number of rolls consumed by the first group:**
   - Each person in the first group eats 1 1/2 rolls.
   - The number of rolls consumed by this group is:
     \[
     8 \times 1.5 = 12 \text{ rolls}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total number of rolls consumed by the second group:**
   - Each person in the second group eats 1/2 a roll.
   - The number of rolls consumed by this group is:
     \[
     8 \times 0.5 = 4 \text{ rolls}
     \]

4. **Calculate the total number of rolls consumed by both groups:**
   - Add the rolls consumed by both groups:
     \[
     12 + 4 = 16 \text{ rolls}
     \]

5. **Determine the number of rolls leftover:**
   - There are 40 dinner rolls available initially.
   - Subtract the total number of rolls consumed from the total available:
     \[
     40 - 16 = 24 \text{ rolls}
     \]

### Final Answer:
There are 24 dinner rolls leftover.
