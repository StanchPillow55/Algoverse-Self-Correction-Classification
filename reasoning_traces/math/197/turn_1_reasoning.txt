Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine how many dinner rolls are consumed by the 16 people at the dinner party and then subtract that from the total number of dinner rolls available to find out how many are leftover.

**Step 1: Determine the number of people in each group.**

There are 16 people at the dinner party. Half of them eat 1 1/2 rolls each, and the other half eat 1/2 roll each.

- Number of people eating 1 1/2 rolls each:  
  \[
  \frac{16}{2} = 8 \text{ people}
  \]

- Number of people eating 1/2 roll each:  
  \[
  \frac{16}{2} = 8 \text{ people}
  \]

**Step 2: Calculate the total number of rolls consumed by each group.**

- Rolls consumed by the group eating 1 1/2 rolls each:
  \[
  8 \text{ people} \times 1.5 \text{ rolls/person} = 12 \text{ rolls}
  \]

- Rolls consumed by the group eating 1/2 roll each:
  \[
  8 \text{ people} \times 0.5 \text{ rolls/person} = 4 \text{ rolls}
  \]

**Step 3: Calculate the total number of rolls consumed.**

Add the rolls consumed by both groups:
\[
12 \text{ rolls} + 4 \text{ rolls} = 16 \text{ rolls}
\]

**Step 4: Calculate the number of rolls leftover.**

Subtract the total number of rolls consumed from the total number of rolls available:
\[
40 \text{ rolls} - 16 \text{ rolls} = 24 \text{ rolls}
\]

**Final Answer:**

There are 24 dinner rolls leftover.
