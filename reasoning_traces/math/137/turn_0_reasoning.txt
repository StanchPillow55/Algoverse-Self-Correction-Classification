==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to determine how many oversized beach towels are used in total over the 7 days, and then calculate how many loads of laundry are required to wash those towels given the washing machine's capacity.

### Step 1: Calculate the total number of people
There are 3 families, and each family has 4 people. Therefore, the total number of people is:

\[
\text{Total people} = 3 \text{ families} \times 4 \text{ people/family} = 12 \text{ people}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the total number of towels used
Each person uses 1 oversized beach towel per day. Over the course of 7 days, the total number of towels used by all people is:

\[
\text{Total towels} = \text{Total people} \times \text{Days} = 12 \text{ people} \times 7 \text{ days} = 84 \text{ towels}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the number of loads of laundry required
The washing machine can hold 14 oversized beach towels per load. To find out how many loads are needed to wash all 84 towels, we divide the total number of towels by the capacity of the washing machine:

\[
\text{Number of loads} = \frac{\text{Total towels}}{\text{Towels per load}} = \frac{84 \text{ towels}}{14 \text{ towels/load}} = 6 \text{ loads}
\]

### Final Answer
Thus, the total number of loads of laundry required to wash all the oversized beach towels is:

\[
\boxed{6}
\]
