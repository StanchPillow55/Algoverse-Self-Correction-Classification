==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of oversized beach towels used and then calculate how many loads of laundry are required to wash them, given the capacity of the washing machine.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Calculate the Total Number of People:**
   - There are 3 families, and each family has 4 people.
   - Total number of people = 3 families × 4 people/family = 12 people.

2. **Calculate the Total Number of Towels Used Per Day:**
   - Each person uses 1 oversized beach towel per day.
   - Therefore, the total number of towels used per day = 12 people × 1 towel/person = 12 towels.

3. **Calculate the Total Number of Towels Used Over the Vacation:**
   - The vacation lasts for 7 days.
   - Total number of towels used over the vacation = 12 towels/day × 7 days = 84 towels.

4. **Determine the Number of Loads Required:**
   - The washing machine can hold 14 oversized beach towels per load.
   - To find the number of loads required, divide the total number of towels by the capacity of the washing machine:
   \[
   \text{Number of loads} = \frac{84 \text{ towels}}{14 \text{ towels/load}} = 6 \text{ loads}
   \]

### Conclusion:

The washing machine will need to run 6 loads to wash all the oversized beach towels used during the vacation.

**Final Answer: 6 loads**
