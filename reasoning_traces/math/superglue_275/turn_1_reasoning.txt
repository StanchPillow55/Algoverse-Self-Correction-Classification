==================================================

To solve the problem effectively, let's first understand what is being asked. The question is labeled as "Sample reasoning question 275," but unfortunately, it doesn't provide any specific mathematical problem or context to work with. This means we need to consider the possibility that the question might be incomplete or that additional information is required to proceed.

However, let's assume this is a hypothetical situation where we need to demonstrate how to approach a typical math problem. I'll create a sample math problem and solve it step-by-step to illustrate the process.

**Sample Math Problem:**

Let's say the problem is: "Solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \)."

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Equation:**
   The equation given is \( 2x + 3 = 11 \). Our goal is to solve for \( x \), which means we need to isolate \( x \) on one side of the equation.

2. **Isolate the Variable:**
   To isolate \( x \), we first need to eliminate the constant term on the left side of the equation. We can do this by subtracting 3 from both sides:
   \[
   2x + 3 - 3 = 11 - 3
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   2x = 8
   \]

3. **Solve for \( x \):**
   Now, we need to solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides by 2:
   \[
   \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{8}{2}
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   x = 4
   \]

4. **Verify the Solution:**
   To ensure our solution is correct, we can substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation:
   \[
   2(4) + 3 = 11
   \]
   Simplifying the left side gives:
   \[
   8 + 3 = 11
   \]
   Since both sides of the equation are equal, our solution \( x = 4 \) is verified.

**Final Answer:**

The solution to the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \) is \( x = 4 \).

This example demonstrates a typical approach to solving a linear equation. If you have a specific problem or additional context, please provide it, and I can assist further.
