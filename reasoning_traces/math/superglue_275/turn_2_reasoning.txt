==================================================

To solve the problem titled "Sample reasoning question 275," we need to first understand the context and details of the problem. However, since the problem statement is not provided, I will demonstrate a general approach to solving a typical math reasoning problem. Let's assume a hypothetical problem and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**
A farmer has a rectangular field that is 100 meters long and 60 meters wide. He wants to build a fence around the field and also divide the field into two equal parts with a fence parallel to the shorter side. Calculate the total length of the fence required.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We have a rectangular field.
   - Dimensions: Length = 100 meters, Width = 60 meters.
   - We need to fence around the perimeter and add a fence to divide the field into two equal parts.

2. **Calculate the Perimeter of the Field:**
   - The perimeter \( P \) of a rectangle is given by the formula:
     \[
     P = 2 \times (\text{Length} + \text{Width})
     \]
   - Substituting the given values:
     \[
     P = 2 \times (100 + 60) = 2 \times 160 = 320 \text{ meters}
     \]

3. **Divide the Field into Two Equal Parts:**
   - The field is divided into two equal parts with a fence parallel to the shorter side (width).
   - This means we add a fence along the length of the field.
   - The length of this additional fence is equal to the length of the field, which is 100 meters.

4. **Calculate the Total Length of the Fence:**
   - Total fence length is the perimeter plus the additional fence to divide the field:
     \[
     \text{Total Fence Length} = \text{Perimeter} + \text{Additional Fence}
     \]
   - Substituting the values:
     \[
     \text{Total Fence Length} = 320 + 100 = 420 \text{ meters}
     \]

5. **Final Answer:**
   - The total length of the fence required is 420 meters.

This step-by-step approach ensures that we understand each part of the problem and perform the necessary calculations to arrive at the correct solution. If you have a specific problem statement for "Sample reasoning question 275," please provide it, and I can tailor the solution accordingly.
