==================================================

To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the total length of the road**: The road is 16 miles long.

2. **Calculate the amount of road paved on the first day**: The company paved 4 miles on the first day.

3. **Calculate the amount of road paved on the second day**: The second day, they paved one mile less than double what they did on the first day. 
   - Double the first day: \(2 \times 4 = 8\) miles.
   - One mile less: \(8 - 1 = 7\) miles.
   - So, they paved 7 miles on the second day.

4. **Calculate the total road paved after two days**: 
   - Total paved = \(4 + 7 = 11\) miles.

5. **Calculate the remaining road to be paved**: 
   - Remaining road = Total road - Paved road = \(16 - 11 = 5\) miles.

6. **Determine the number of truckloads needed for the remaining road**: 
   - It takes 3 truckloads to pave each mile.
   - For 5 miles, the number of truckloads needed = \(5 \times 3 = 15\) truckloads.

7. **Determine the number of bags of gravel and barrels of pitch used per truckload**:
   - Each truckload uses 2 bags of gravel.
   - It uses 5 times as many bags of gravel as it does barrels of pitch. 
   - Let \(x\) be the number of barrels of pitch used per truckload. Then, the number of bags of gravel used per truckload is \(5x\).
   - We know that \(5x = 2\) (since each truckload uses 2 bags of gravel).
   - Solving for \(x\): 
     \[
     x = \frac{2}{5}
     \]
   - Therefore, each truckload uses \(\frac{2}{5}\) barrels of pitch.

8. **Calculate the total number of barrels of pitch needed for the remaining truckloads**:
   - Total barrels of pitch needed = Number of truckloads Ã— Barrels of pitch per truckload.
   - Total barrels of pitch = \(15 \times \frac{2}{5}\).
   - Calculating this:
     \[
     15 \times \frac{2}{5} = \frac{30}{5} = 6
     \]

Thus, the company will need **6 barrels of pitch** to finish paving the remaining road on the third day.

Final answer: **6 barrels of pitch**.
