==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine how many barrels of pitch are required to finish paving the remaining road on the third day. Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Step 1: Determine the Total Miles of Road to be Paved
The total length of the road is 16 miles.

### Step 2: Calculate the Miles Paved on the First and Second Days
- **First Day:** The company paved 4 miles.
- **Second Day:** The company paved one mile less than double the first day. Double the first day is \(2 \times 4 = 8\) miles. One mile less than that is \(8 - 1 = 7\) miles.

### Step 3: Calculate the Remaining Miles to be Paved
The total miles paved in the first two days is \(4 + 7 = 11\) miles. Therefore, the remaining miles to be paved on the third day is:
\[ 16 - 11 = 5 \text{ miles} \]

### Step 4: Determine the Number of Truckloads Needed for the Remaining Miles
It takes 3 truckloads of asphalt to pave each mile of road. Therefore, for 5 miles, the number of truckloads needed is:
\[ 5 \text{ miles} \times 3 \text{ truckloads/mile} = 15 \text{ truckloads} \]

### Step 5: Determine the Number of Barrels of Pitch per Truckload
Each truckload uses two bags of gravel and five times as many bags of gravel as it does barrels of pitch. Let \( x \) be the number of barrels of pitch per truckload. Then, the number of bags of gravel per truckload is \( 5x \).

Since each truckload uses two bags of gravel, we have:
\[ 5x = 2 \]
Solving for \( x \), we get:
\[ x = \frac{2}{5} \]

### Step 6: Calculate the Total Number of Barrels of Pitch Needed
Each truckload uses \(\frac{2}{5}\) barrels of pitch. Therefore, for 15 truckloads, the total number of barrels of pitch needed is:
\[ 15 \times \frac{2}{5} = 6 \text{ barrels} \]

### Final Answer
The company will need 6 barrels of pitch to finish paving the remaining road on the third day.
