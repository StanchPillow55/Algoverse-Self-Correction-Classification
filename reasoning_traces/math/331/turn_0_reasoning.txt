==================================================

To determine how much more money Nick will make at the job with a higher net pay rate, we need to calculate the net pay for both Job A and Job B after taxes.

### Step 1: Calculate the net pay for Job A

**Job A:**
- Hourly wage: $15
- Hours per year: 2000
- Total income before tax: 
  \[
  \text{Total income} = \text{Hourly wage} \times \text{Hours per year} = 15 \times 2000 = 30,000
  \]
- Tax rate: 20%
- Total tax paid:
  \[
  \text{Total tax} = \text{Total income} \times \text{Tax rate} = 30,000 \times 0.20 = 6,000
  \]
- Net pay after tax:
  \[
  \text{Net pay} = \text{Total income} - \text{Total tax} = 30,000 - 6,000 = 24,000
  \]

### Step 2: Calculate the net pay for Job B

**Job B:**
- Annual salary: $42,000
- Property tax: $6,000
- Net income after property tax:
  \[
  \text{Net income} = \text{Annual salary} - \text{Property tax} = 42,000 - 6,000 = 36,000
  \]
- Tax rate on net income after property tax: 10%
- Total tax paid on net income:
  \[
  \text{Total tax} = \text{Net income} \times \text{Tax rate} = 36,000 \times 0.10 = 3,600
  \]
- Net pay after tax:
  \[
  \text{Net pay} = \text{Net income} - \text{Total tax} = 36,000 - 3,600 = 32,400
  \]

### Step 3: Compare the net pay of both jobs

Now we compare the net pay of Job A and Job B:
- Net pay for Job A: $24,000
- Net pay for Job B: $32,400

### Step 4: Calculate the difference in net pay

To find out how much more money Nick will make at the job with the higher net pay (Job B), we calculate the difference:
\[
\text{Difference} = \text{Net pay of Job B} - \text{Net pay of Job A} = 32,400 - 24,000 = 8,400
\]

### Final Answer

Nick will make **$8,400** more at Job B compared to Job A.
