Question ID: 331
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To determine which job offers Nick a higher net pay and by how much, we will calculate the net pay for both Job A and Job B step by step.

### Job A Calculation

1. **Hourly Wage**: $15/hour
2. **Hours Worked per Year**: 2000 hours

   \[
   \text{Annual Income for Job A} = \text{Hourly Wage} \times \text{Hours Worked}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Annual Income for Job A} = 15 \times 2000 = 30000
   \]

3. **Tax Rate**: 20%

   \[
   \text{Total Tax for Job A} = \text{Annual Income} \times \text{Tax Rate}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total Tax for Job A} = 30000 \times 0.20 = 6000
   \]

4. **Net Pay for Job A**:

   \[
   \text{Net Pay for Job A} = \text{Annual Income} - \text{Total Tax}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Net Pay for Job A} = 30000 - 6000 = 24000
   \]

### Job B Calculation

1. **Annual Salary**: $42,000
2. **Property Tax**: $6,000
3. **Net Income after Property Tax**:

   \[
   \text{Net Income for Job B} = \text{Annual Salary} - \text{Property Tax}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Net Income for Job B} = 42000 - 6000 = 36000
   \]

4. **Tax Rate on Net Income**: 10%

   \[
   \text{Total Tax for Job B} = \text{Net Income} \times \text{Tax Rate}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total Tax for Job B} = 36000 \times 0.10 = 3600
   \]

5. **Net Pay for Job B**:

   \[
   \text{Net Pay for Job B} = \text{Net Income} - \text{Total Tax}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Net Pay for Job B} = 36000 - 3600 = 32400
   \]

### Comparison of Net Pays

Now we compare the net pays of both jobs:

- **Net Pay for Job A**: $24,000
- **Net Pay for Job B**: $32,400

### Difference in Net Pay

To find out how much more money Nick will make at Job B compared to Job A:

\[
\text{Difference} = \text{Net Pay for Job B} - \text{Net Pay for Job A}
\]
\[
\text{Difference} = 32400 - 24000 = 8400
\]

### Final Answer

Nick will make **$8,400** more at Job B compared to Job A.
