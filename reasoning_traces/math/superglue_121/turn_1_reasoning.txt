==================================================

To solve the problem effectively, let's first understand what "Sample reasoning question 121" might entail. Since no specific details are provided about the problem, I'll create a hypothetical math problem and solve it step by step. 

Let's assume the problem is as follows:

**Problem:**
A company produces two types of products, A and B. The profit from each unit of product A is $5, and the profit from each unit of product B is $7. The company can produce a maximum of 100 units of product A and 80 units of product B per day. However, due to resource constraints, the total production of products A and B combined cannot exceed 150 units per day. How many units of each product should the company produce to maximize its profit?

**Solution:**

To solve this problem, we can use a linear programming approach. Let's define the variables:
- Let \( x \) be the number of units of product A produced per day.
- Let \( y \) be the number of units of product B produced per day.

The objective is to maximize the profit function:
\[ P = 5x + 7y \]

Subject to the following constraints:
1. \( x \leq 100 \) (Product A production limit)
2. \( y \leq 80 \) (Product B production limit)
3. \( x + y \leq 150 \) (Total production limit)
4. \( x \geq 0 \) and \( y \geq 0 \) (Non-negativity constraints)

**Step-by-step Solution:**

1. **Identify the feasible region:**
   - The feasible region is determined by the intersection of the constraints on a graph.
   - Plot the lines \( x = 100 \), \( y = 80 \), and \( x + y = 150 \) on a coordinate plane.

2. **Find the corner points of the feasible region:**
   - The intersection of \( x = 100 \) and \( x + y = 150 \) gives the point (100, 50).
   - The intersection of \( y = 80 \) and \( x + y = 150 \) gives the point (70, 80).
   - The intersection of \( x = 0 \) and \( y = 0 \) with \( x + y = 150 \) gives the point (0, 80).
   - The intersection of \( x = 0 \) and \( y = 0 \) with \( x = 100 \) gives the point (100, 0).

3. **Evaluate the profit function at each corner point:**
   - At (100, 50): \( P = 5(100) + 7(50) = 500 + 350 = 850 \)
   - At (70, 80): \( P = 5(70) + 7(80) = 350 + 560 = 910 \)
   - At (0, 80): \( P = 5(0) + 7(80) = 0 + 560 = 560 \)
   - At (100, 0): \( P = 5(100) + 7(0) = 500 + 0 = 500 \)

4. **Determine the maximum profit:**
   - The maximum profit occurs at the point (70, 80) with a profit of $910.

**Final Answer:**
To maximize profit, the company should produce 70 units of product A and 80 units of product B per day, resulting in a maximum profit of $910.
