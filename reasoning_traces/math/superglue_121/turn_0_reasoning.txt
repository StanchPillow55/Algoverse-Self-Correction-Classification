It seems like there might be a misunderstanding or a missing component in your question. "Sample reasoning question 121" doesn't provide enough information for me to solve a specific math problem. However, I can guide you through a general approach to solving math problems or help with a specific type of math problem if you provide more details.

Here's a general approach to solving a math problem:

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - Read the problem carefully.
   - Identify what is being asked.
   - Determine what information is given.

2. **Devise a Plan:**
   - Consider possible strategies to solve the problem (e.g., drawing a diagram, creating an equation, using a formula).
   - Choose the most appropriate strategy based on the problem type.

3. **Carry Out the Plan:**
   - Execute the chosen strategy step by step.
   - Perform calculations carefully.
   - Keep track of units and ensure consistency.

4. **Review/Check Your Work:**
   - Verify each step of your calculations.
   - Check if the solution makes sense in the context of the problem.
   - Ensure that the final answer addresses the question.

If you provide a specific math problem or more details, I can apply this approach to solve it and show all the work and reasoning involved.
