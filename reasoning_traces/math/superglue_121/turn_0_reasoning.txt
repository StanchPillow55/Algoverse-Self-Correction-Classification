==================================================

To solve a math problem effectively, it's important to have a clear understanding of the problem itself. However, the question you've provided, "Sample reasoning question 121," doesn't contain specific details or numbers to work with. Therefore, I'll guide you through a general approach to solving a typical math problem, which you can apply once you have the specific details of your problem.

### General Approach to Solving Math Problems

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - Read the problem carefully.
   - Identify what is being asked.
   - Determine what information is given and what needs to be found.

2. **Devise a Plan:**
   - Think about the strategies that could be used to solve the problem. This might include:
     - Drawing a diagram.
     - Creating an equation.
     - Breaking the problem into smaller parts.
     - Looking for patterns.

3. **Carry Out the Plan:**
   - Execute the steps youâ€™ve decided on.
   - Perform calculations carefully.
   - Keep track of your work to ensure accuracy.

4. **Review/Check Your Work:**
   - Verify each step of your solution.
   - Check if the answer makes sense in the context of the problem.
   - Re-calculate if necessary to confirm your results.

5. **State the Final Answer:**
   - Clearly write down the final answer, ensuring it addresses the question asked.

### Example Problem and Solution

Let's consider an example problem to illustrate this approach:

**Example Problem:**
"A rectangle has a length that is twice its width. If the perimeter of the rectangle is 36 units, what are the dimensions of the rectangle?"

**Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We need to find the length and width of the rectangle.
   - We know the perimeter is 36 units, and the length is twice the width.

2. **Devise a Plan:**
   - Let the width be \( w \).
   - Then the length is \( 2w \).
   - Use the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle: \( P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width}) \).

3. **Carry Out the Plan:**
   - Substitute the known values into the perimeter formula:
     \[
     36 = 2 \times (2w + w)
     \]
   - Simplify and solve for \( w \):
     \[
     36 = 2 \times 3w
     \]
     \[
     36 = 6w
     \]
     \[
     w = \frac{36}{6} = 6
     \]
   - Calculate the length:
     \[
     \text{Length} = 2w = 2 \times 6 = 12
     \]

4. **Review/Check Your Work:**
   - Check the perimeter with the found dimensions:
     \[
     P = 2 \times (12 + 6) = 2 \times 18 = 36
     \]
   - The calculations are correct.

5. **State the Final Answer:**
   - The width of the rectangle is 6 units, and the length is 12 units.

This structured approach ensures that you thoroughly understand and solve the problem, leading to a correct and verified solution. If you have a specific problem in mind, please provide the details, and I can work through it using this method.
