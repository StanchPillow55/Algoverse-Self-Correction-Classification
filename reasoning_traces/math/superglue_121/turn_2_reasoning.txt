==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample reasoning question 121," we need to first understand what the problem is asking. However, since the problem statement is not provided, I will demonstrate a general approach to solving a mathematical reasoning problem by creating a hypothetical problem based on typical reasoning questions.

Let's assume the problem is as follows:

**Problem:**
A train travels from City A to City B at a speed of 60 km/h. On its return trip from City B to City A, it travels at a speed of 90 km/h. If the total travel time for the round trip is 5 hours, what is the distance between City A and City B?

**Solution:**

To solve this problem, we need to find the distance between City A and City B, which we'll denote as \( d \).

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( d \) be the distance between City A and City B.
   - The speed from City A to City B is 60 km/h.
   - The speed from City B to City A is 90 km/h.
   - The total travel time for the round trip is 5 hours.

2. **Set Up Equations:**
   - The time taken to travel from City A to City B is given by the formula:
     \[
     \text{Time from A to B} = \frac{d}{60}
     \]
   - The time taken to travel from City B to City A is:
     \[
     \text{Time from B to A} = \frac{d}{90}
     \]
   - The total travel time for the round trip is the sum of these two times:
     \[
     \frac{d}{60} + \frac{d}{90} = 5
     \]

3. **Solve the Equation:**
   - To solve for \( d \), we first find a common denominator for the fractions, which is 180:
     \[
     \frac{d}{60} = \frac{3d}{180}, \quad \frac{d}{90} = \frac{2d}{180}
     \]
   - Substitute these into the equation:
     \[
     \frac{3d}{180} + \frac{2d}{180} = 5
     \]
   - Combine the fractions:
     \[
     \frac{5d}{180} = 5
     \]
   - Multiply both sides by 180 to clear the fraction:
     \[
     5d = 900
     \]
   - Divide both sides by 5 to solve for \( d \):
     \[
     d = 180
     \]

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The distance between City A and City B is 180 kilometers.

**Final Answer:**
The distance between City A and City B is 180 km.
