==================================================

To find the total cost of May's haircut and color, we need to break down the costs into two parts: the cost of the color and the cost of the haircut.

1. **Cost of the color**: 
   - The cost for coloring her hair is given as $40.

2. **Cost of the haircut**:
   - May's hair started at 10 inches and ended at 8 inches. 
   - The length of hair cut off is calculated as follows:
     \[
     \text{Length cut} = \text{Initial length} - \text{Final length} = 10 \text{ inches} - 8 \text{ inches} = 2 \text{ inches}
     \]
   - The cost of the haircut is $30 per inch. Therefore, the cost for cutting 2 inches is:
     \[
     \text{Cost of haircut} = \text{Length cut} \times \text{Cost per inch} = 2 \text{ inches} \times 30 \text{ dollars/inch} = 60 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Total cost**:
   - Now, we add the cost of the color and the cost of the haircut:
     \[
     \text{Total cost} = \text{Cost of color} + \text{Cost of haircut} = 40 \text{ dollars} + 60 \text{ dollars} = 100 \text{ dollars}
     \]

Thus, the total cost for May's haircut and color is **$100**. 

Final answer: **$100**.
