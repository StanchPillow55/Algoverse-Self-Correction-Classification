==================================================

To find the total cost of May's haircut and color, we need to calculate the cost of each component separately and then sum them up.

1. **Cost of Hair Color**: 
   - The cost for the hair color is given as $40.

2. **Cost of Haircut**:
   - The cost for the haircut is $30 per inch.
   - May's hair started at 10 inches and ended at 8 inches.
   - The amount of hair cut off is:
     \[
     10 \text{ inches} - 8 \text{ inches} = 2 \text{ inches}
     \]
   - Now, we calculate the cost of the haircut:
     \[
     \text{Cost of haircut} = 2 \text{ inches} \times 30 \text{ dollars/inch} = 60 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Total Cost**:
   - Now we sum the costs of the hair color and the haircut:
     \[
     \text{Total cost} = \text{Cost of hair color} + \text{Cost of haircut} = 40 \text{ dollars} + 60 \text{ dollars} = 100 \text{ dollars}
     \]

Thus, the total cost for May's haircut and color is **$100**. 

Final answer: **$100**.
