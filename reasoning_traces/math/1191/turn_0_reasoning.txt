To find the total cost of May's haircut and color, we need to break down the costs into two parts: the cost of the hair color and the cost of the haircut.

1. **Cost of Hair Color**: 
   - The problem states that the cost for the color is $40. 
   - Therefore, the cost of the hair color is:
     \[
     \text{Cost of Hair Color} = 40 \text{ dollars}
     \]

2. **Cost of Haircut**:
   - The problem states that the cost of the haircut is $30 per inch.
   - May's hair started at 10 inches and ended at 8 inches, so we need to calculate how many inches were cut off:
     \[
     \text{Inches Cut} = \text{Starting Length} - \text{Ending Length} = 10 \text{ inches} - 8 \text{ inches} = 2 \text{ inches}
     \]
   - Now, we can calculate the cost of the haircut based on the inches cut:
     \[
     \text{Cost of Haircut} = \text{Inches Cut} \times \text{Cost per Inch} = 2 \text{ inches} \times 30 \text{ dollars/inch} = 60 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Total Cost**:
   - Now we can find the total cost by adding the cost of the hair color and the cost of the haircut:
     \[
     \text{Total Cost} = \text{Cost of Hair Color} + \text{Cost of Haircut} = 40 \text{ dollars} + 60 \text{ dollars} = 100 \text{ dollars}
     \]

Thus, the total cost of May's haircut and color is:
\[
\boxed{100 \text{ dollars}}
\]
