Let's denote the number of stickers Seth initially had as \( S \).

1. **Seth gives half of his stickers to Luis**:
   \[
   \text{Stickers given to Luis} = \frac{S}{2}
   \]

2. **Luis uses half of the stickers he received**:
   \[
   \text{Stickers used by Luis} = \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{S}{2} = \frac{S}{4}
   \]

3. **Stickers left with Luis after using half**:
   \[
   \text{Stickers left with Luis} = \frac{S}{2} - \frac{S}{4} = \frac{S}{4}
   \]

4. **Luis gives the remaining stickers to Kris**:
   \[
   \text{Stickers given to Kris} = \frac{S}{4}
   \]

5. **Kris keeps 9 stickers and gives the remaining 7 stickers to Rob**:
   \[
   \text{Total stickers Kris had} = 9 + 7 = 16
   \]

6. **Setting up the equation**:
   Since we know that Kris received \( \frac{S}{4} \) stickers, we can set up the equation:
   \[
   \frac{S}{4} = 16
   \]

7. **Solving for \( S \)**:
   To find \( S \), we multiply both sides of the equation by 4:
   \[
   S = 16 \times 4 = 64
   \]

Thus, Seth initially had \( \boxed{64} \) stickers.
