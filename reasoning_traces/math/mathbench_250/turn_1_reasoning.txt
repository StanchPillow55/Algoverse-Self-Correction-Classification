==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 250," we need to first understand what the problem is asking. However, the problem statement "Sample math problem 250" is not specific enough to determine the exact question or the mathematical operations involved. Therefore, I will assume a hypothetical problem related to the number 250 and solve it step by step.

Let's assume the problem is as follows:

**Problem:** Find the prime factorization of 250 and determine the number of divisors it has.

**Step 1: Prime Factorization of 250**

To find the prime factorization of 250, we need to divide it by the smallest prime numbers until we reach 1.

1. Start with the smallest prime number, which is 2. Check if 250 is divisible by 2:
   \[
   250 \div 2 = 125
   \]
   Since 250 is divisible by 2, we have one factor of 2.

2. Now, take 125 and check divisibility by the next smallest prime number, which is 3. Since 125 is not divisible by 3, we move to the next prime number, which is 5:
   \[
   125 \div 5 = 25
   \]
   Since 125 is divisible by 5, we have one factor of 5.

3. Continue with 25, which is also divisible by 5:
   \[
   25 \div 5 = 5
   \]
   We have another factor of 5.

4. Finally, 5 is divisible by 5:
   \[
   5 \div 5 = 1
   \]
   We have one more factor of 5.

Thus, the prime factorization of 250 is:
\[
250 = 2^1 \times 5^3
\]

**Step 2: Determine the Number of Divisors**

To find the number of divisors of a number given its prime factorization, use the formula:
\[
(n_1 + 1)(n_2 + 1)\cdots(n_k + 1)
\]
where \( n_1, n_2, \ldots, n_k \) are the exponents in the prime factorization.

For 250, the prime factorization is \( 2^1 \times 5^3 \). Therefore, the number of divisors is:
\[
(1 + 1)(3 + 1) = 2 \times 4 = 8
\]

**Final Answer:**

The prime factorization of 250 is \( 2^1 \times 5^3 \), and it has 8 divisors.
