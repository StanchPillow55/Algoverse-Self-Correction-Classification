==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 250," we need to first understand what the problem is asking. Since "Sample math problem 250" is not a specific question, I'll assume it is a placeholder for a typical math problem. Let's create a sample math problem and solve it step by step.

**Sample Math Problem:**
Calculate the sum of all even numbers from 1 to 250.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Identify the Even Numbers:**
   Even numbers are integers divisible by 2. In the range from 1 to 250, the even numbers start at 2 and end at 250.

2. **List the Sequence of Even Numbers:**
   The sequence of even numbers from 1 to 250 is: 2, 4, 6, ..., 250.

3. **Determine the Number of Terms:**
   The sequence of even numbers is an arithmetic sequence where the first term \( a_1 = 2 \) and the common difference \( d = 2 \).

   To find the number of terms \( n \), use the formula for the \( n \)-th term of an arithmetic sequence:
   \[
   a_n = a_1 + (n-1) \cdot d
   \]
   Set \( a_n = 250 \):
   \[
   250 = 2 + (n-1) \cdot 2
   \]
   \[
   250 = 2 + 2n - 2
   \]
   \[
   250 = 2n
   \]
   \[
   n = \frac{250}{2} = 125
   \]

4. **Calculate the Sum of the Sequence:**
   The sum \( S_n \) of the first \( n \) terms of an arithmetic sequence is given by:
   \[
   S_n = \frac{n}{2} \cdot (a_1 + a_n)
   \]
   Substitute the known values:
   \[
   S_{125} = \frac{125}{2} \cdot (2 + 250)
   \]
   \[
   S_{125} = \frac{125}{2} \cdot 252
   \]
   \[
   S_{125} = 125 \cdot 126
   \]
   \[
   S_{125} = 15750
   \]

**Final Answer:**
The sum of all even numbers from 1 to 250 is 15,750.
