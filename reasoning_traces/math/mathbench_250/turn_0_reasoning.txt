==================================================

To solve the problem, we first need to understand what "Sample math problem 250" refers to. Since the problem is not explicitly stated, I'll assume it's a placeholder for a typical math problem. Let's create a sample problem and solve it step by step.

**Sample Problem:**

Calculate the sum of all even numbers between 1 and 250.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Identify the Sequence of Even Numbers:**
   - The even numbers between 1 and 250 are 2, 4, 6, ..., 250.
   - This sequence is an arithmetic sequence where the first term \( a_1 = 2 \) and the common difference \( d = 2 \).

2. **Find the Number of Terms in the Sequence:**
   - The general formula for the \( n \)-th term of an arithmetic sequence is:
     \[
     a_n = a_1 + (n-1) \cdot d
     \]
   - We need to find \( n \) such that \( a_n = 250 \).
     \[
     250 = 2 + (n-1) \cdot 2
     \]
     \[
     250 = 2 + 2n - 2
     \]
     \[
     250 = 2n
     \]
     \[
     n = \frac{250}{2} = 125
     \]
   - There are 125 even numbers between 1 and 250.

3. **Calculate the Sum of the Sequence:**
   - The sum \( S_n \) of the first \( n \) terms of an arithmetic sequence is given by:
     \[
     S_n = \frac{n}{2} \cdot (a_1 + a_n)
     \]
   - Substitute the known values:
     \[
     S_{125} = \frac{125}{2} \cdot (2 + 250)
     \]
     \[
     S_{125} = \frac{125}{2} \cdot 252
     \]
     \[
     S_{125} = 125 \cdot 126
     \]
   - Calculate \( 125 \times 126 \):
     \[
     125 \times 126 = 125 \times (125 + 1) = 125^2 + 125
     \]
     \[
     125^2 = (100 + 25)^2 = 100^2 + 2 \cdot 100 \cdot 25 + 25^2
     \]
     \[
     125^2 = 10000 + 5000 + 625 = 15625
     \]
     \[
     125 \times 126 = 15625 + 125 = 15750
     \]

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The sum of all even numbers between 1 and 250 is \( \boxed{15750} \).
