==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 250," I need to first understand what the problem is asking. However, the phrase "Sample math problem 250" is quite vague and doesn't specify any particular mathematical question or context. Therefore, I will assume that "250" is the number we need to work with, and I will create a math problem involving this number.

Let's consider a problem involving the number 250:

**Problem:**  
Calculate the sum of all positive divisors of the number 250.

**Step-by-step Solution:**

1. **Find the Prime Factorization of 250:**

   To find the divisors of 250, we first need its prime factorization.

   - 250 is an even number, so it is divisible by 2:
     \[
     250 \div 2 = 125
     \]
   - 125 is not divisible by 2, but it ends in 5, so it is divisible by 5:
     \[
     125 \div 5 = 25
     \]
   - 25 is also divisible by 5:
     \[
     25 \div 5 = 5
     \]
   - Finally, 5 is divisible by 5:
     \[
     5 \div 5 = 1
     \]

   Therefore, the prime factorization of 250 is:
   \[
   250 = 2^1 \times 5^3
   \]

2. **Use the Prime Factorization to Find All Divisors:**

   The divisors of a number can be found by taking all combinations of its prime factors raised to their respective powers. For \(250 = 2^1 \times 5^3\), the divisors are:

   - \(2^0 \times 5^0 = 1\)
   - \(2^1 \times 5^0 = 2\)
   - \(2^0 \times 5^1 = 5\)
   - \(2^1 \times 5^1 = 10\)
   - \(2^0 \times 5^2 = 25\)
   - \(2^1 \times 5^2 = 50\)
   - \(2^0 \times 5^3 = 125\)
   - \(2^1 \times 5^3 = 250\)

   So, the divisors of 250 are: 1, 2, 5, 10, 25, 50, 125, and 250.

3. **Calculate the Sum of the Divisors:**

   Add up all the divisors:
   \[
   1 + 2 + 5 + 10 + 25 + 50 + 125 + 250 = 468
   \]

**Final Answer:**

The sum of all positive divisors of 250 is 468.
