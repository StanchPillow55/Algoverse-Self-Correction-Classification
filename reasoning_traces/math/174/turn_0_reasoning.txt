To solve this problem, we need to determine the cost of movie tickets on Wednesday and Saturday, and then calculate the total amount Glenn spends on these days.

1. **Determine the cost of a movie ticket on Monday:**
   - The problem states that a movie ticket costs $5 on a Monday.

2. **Calculate the cost of a movie ticket on Wednesday:**
   - According to the problem, the cost of a movie ticket on Wednesday is twice as much as on Monday.
   - Therefore, the cost on Wednesday is: 
     \[
     2 \times 5 = 10
     \]
   - So, a movie ticket on Wednesday costs $10.

3. **Calculate the cost of a movie ticket on Saturday:**
   - The problem states that the cost of a movie ticket on Saturday is five times as much as on Monday.
   - Therefore, the cost on Saturday is:
     \[
     5 \times 5 = 25
     \]
   - So, a movie ticket on Saturday costs $25.

4. **Calculate the total amount Glenn spends:**
   - Glenn goes to the movie theater on Wednesday and Saturday.
   - The cost for Wednesday is $10, and the cost for Saturday is $25.
   - To find the total amount spent, we add these two amounts:
     \[
     10 + 25 = 35
     \]

Therefore, Glenn spends a total of $35 when he goes to the movie theater on Wednesday and Saturday.

**Final Answer:**
Glenn spends $35.
