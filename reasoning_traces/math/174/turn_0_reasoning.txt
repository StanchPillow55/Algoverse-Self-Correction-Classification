To solve the problem, we need to determine the cost of movie tickets on Wednesday and Saturday based on the given prices for Monday.

1. **Cost of a movie ticket on Monday**: 
   - The problem states that movie tickets cost $5 each on a Monday.

2. **Cost of a movie ticket on Wednesday**: 
   - According to the problem, tickets on Wednesday cost twice as much as on Monday. 
   - Therefore, the cost on Wednesday is:
     \[
     \text{Cost on Wednesday} = 2 \times \text{Cost on Monday} = 2 \times 5 = 10 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Cost of a movie ticket on Saturday**: 
   - The problem states that tickets on Saturday cost five times as much as on Monday. 
   - Therefore, the cost on Saturday is:
     \[
     \text{Cost on Saturday} = 5 \times \text{Cost on Monday} = 5 \times 5 = 25 \text{ dollars}
     \]

4. **Total cost for Glenn going to the movies on Wednesday and Saturday**: 
   - To find the total amount Glenn spends, we add the costs of the tickets for both days:
     \[
     \text{Total Cost} = \text{Cost on Wednesday} + \text{Cost on Saturday} = 10 + 25 = 35 \text{ dollars}
     \]

Thus, Glenn spends a total of **$35** when he goes to the movie theater on Wednesday and Saturday.

Final answer:
\[
\boxed{35}
\]
