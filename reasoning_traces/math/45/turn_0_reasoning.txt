To find the total cost of Ava's birthday party supplies, we need to calculate the cost of the unicorn piñata and the cost of all the treats separately, and then add them together.

1. **Cost of the unicorn piñata**:
   - The cost of the unicorn piñata is given as $13.

2. **Cost of the treats**:
   - We have three types of treats with their respective quantities and prices:
     - **Reese's**: 4 bags at $9 per bag
     - **Snickers**: 3 bags at $5 per bag
     - **Skittles**: 5 bags at $7 per bag

   Let's calculate the total cost for each type of treat:

   - **Cost of Reese's**:
     \[
     \text{Cost of Reese's} = \text{Number of bags} \times \text{Cost per bag} = 4 \times 9 = 36
     \]

   - **Cost of Snickers**:
     \[
     \text{Cost of Snickers} = \text{Number of bags} \times \text{Cost per bag} = 3 \times 5 = 15
     \]

   - **Cost of Skittles**:
     \[
     \text{Cost of Skittles} = \text{Number of bags} \times \text{Cost per bag} = 5 \times 7 = 35
     \]

3. **Total cost of the treats**:
   Now, we add the costs of all the treats together:
   \[
   \text{Total cost of treats} = \text{Cost of Reese's} + \text{Cost of Snickers} + \text{Cost of Skittles}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total cost of treats} = 36 + 15 + 35
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total cost of treats} = 86
   \]

4. **Total cost of the unicorn piñata and the treats**:
   Finally, we add the cost of the unicorn piñata to the total cost of the treats:
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = \text{Cost of unicorn piñata} + \text{Total cost of treats}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = 13 + 86
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = 99
   \]

Therefore, the total cost of the unicorn piñata and the treats altogether is **$99**.
