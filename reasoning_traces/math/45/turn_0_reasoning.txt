To find the total cost of the unicorn piñata and the treats, we need to add together the cost of the piñata, the cost of the Reese's, the cost of the Snickers, and the cost of the Skittles.

First, let's find the total cost of each type of candy:

- For the Reese's, we multiply the number of bags (4) by the cost per bag ($9), which gives us 4 * $9 = $36.
- For the Snickers, we multiply the number of bags (3) by the cost per bag ($5), which gives us 3 * $5 = $15.
- For the Skittles, we multiply the number of bags (5) by the cost per bag ($7), which gives us 5 * $7 = $35.

Now, we add together the cost of the piñata and the cost of each type of candy:

$13 (piñata) + $36 (Reese's) + $15 (Snickers) + $35 (Skittles) = $99.

So, the total cost of the unicorn piñata and the treats was $99.
