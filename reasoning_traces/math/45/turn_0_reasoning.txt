==================================================

To solve the problem, we will first determine how many articles Meredith wrote each day and then calculate the total time she spent writing those articles.

### Step 1: Calculate the number of articles written each day.

**Monday:**
- Meredith wrote 5 articles.

**Tuesday:**
- She wrote \( \frac{2}{5} \) times more articles than on Monday.
- To find the number of articles written on Tuesday, we calculate:
  \[
  \text{Articles on Tuesday} = 5 + \left(\frac{2}{5} \times 5\right)
  \]
  \[
  = 5 + 2 = 7 \text{ articles}
  \]

**Wednesday:**
- On Wednesday, she wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday.
- Therefore, the number of articles written on Wednesday is:
  \[
  \text{Articles on Wednesday} = 2 \times 7 = 14 \text{ articles}
  \]

### Step 2: Calculate the total number of articles written over the three days.

Now, we can sum the articles written over the three days:
\[
\text{Total articles} = \text{Articles on Monday} + \text{Articles on Tuesday} + \text{Articles on Wednesday}
\]
\[
= 5 + 7 + 14 = 26 \text{ articles}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the total time spent writing articles.

Each article takes an average of 4 hours to research and write. Therefore, the total time spent writing can be calculated as follows:
\[
\text{Total time} = \text{Total articles} \times \text{Time per article}
\]
\[
= 26 \times 4 = 104 \text{ hours}
\]

### Final Answer:
Meredith spent a total of **104 hours** writing articles over the three days.
