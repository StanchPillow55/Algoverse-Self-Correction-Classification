Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To find the total cost of the unicorn piñata and the treats, we need to calculate the cost of each item and then sum them up.

1. **Cost of the Unicorn Piñata:**
   - The piñata itself costs $13.

2. **Cost of Reese's:**
   - There are 4 bags of Reese's, each costing $9.
   - Total cost for Reese's = 4 bags × $9/bag = $36.

3. **Cost of Snickers:**
   - There are 3 bags of Snickers, each costing $5.
   - Total cost for Snickers = 3 bags × $5/bag = $15.

4. **Cost of Skittles:**
   - There are 5 bags of Skittles, each costing $7.
   - Total cost for Skittles = 5 bags × $7/bag = $35.

5. **Total Cost:**
   - Add up the costs of the piñata and all the treats:
   \[
   \text{Total Cost} = \text{Cost of Piñata} + \text{Cost of Reese's} + \text{Cost of Snickers} + \text{Cost of Skittles}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total Cost} = \$13 + \$36 + \$15 + \$35
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total Cost} = \$99
   \]

Therefore, the total cost of the unicorn piñata and the treats is $99.
