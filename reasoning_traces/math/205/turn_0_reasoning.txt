==================================================

To determine how many plates Wickham needs for his Christmas party, we will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of guests.**
   - Wickham invites 30 people.
   - Half of the guests bring a plus one. Since half of 30 is 15, this means 15 guests will bring an additional person.
   - Therefore, the total number of guests is:
     \[
     30 + 15 = 45
     \]

2. **Determine the number of plates needed per guest.**
   - Each guest will be served a 3-course meal, and Wickham uses a new plate for each course.
   - This means each guest will require 3 plates (one for each course).

3. **Calculate the total number of plates needed.**
   - Since there are 45 guests and each guest needs 3 plates, the total number of plates required is:
     \[
     45 \text{ guests} \times 3 \text{ plates per guest} = 135 \text{ plates}
     \]

4. **Final answer.**
   - Wickham needs a total of 135 plates for his Christmas party.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{135}
\]
