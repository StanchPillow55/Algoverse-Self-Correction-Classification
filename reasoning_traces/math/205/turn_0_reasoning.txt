==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of people attending the party and then calculate the total number of plates required for the 3-course meal.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of attendees.**

1. Wickham invites 30 people to the party.
2. Half of these guests bring a plus one. To find out how many guests bring a plus one, we calculate half of 30:
   \[
   \frac{30}{2} = 15
   \]
   So, 15 guests bring a plus one.

3. Each of these 15 guests brings one additional person, so the number of additional people is 15.

4. Therefore, the total number of attendees at the party is the original 30 guests plus the 15 additional people:
   \[
   30 + 15 = 45
   \]

**Step 2: Calculate the total number of plates needed.**

1. Each attendee will have a 3-course meal, and a new plate is used for each course.
2. Therefore, each attendee requires 3 plates.
3. To find the total number of plates needed, multiply the total number of attendees by the number of plates per attendee:
   \[
   45 \times 3 = 135
   \]

**Conclusion:**

Wickham needs a total of 135 plates for the party to serve a 3-course meal to all attendees. 

**Final Answer:**
135 plates
