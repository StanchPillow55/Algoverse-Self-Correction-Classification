==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of plates Wickham needs for his Christmas party. Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Determine the Total Number of Attendees:**
   - Wickham invites 30 people to the party.
   - Half of these guests bring a plus one. Since half of 30 is 15, this means 15 guests bring an additional person.
   - Therefore, the total number of plus ones is 15.

2. **Calculate the Total Number of People Attending:**
   - The original number of invited guests is 30.
   - The number of plus ones is 15.
   - Therefore, the total number of attendees is:
     \[
     30 + 15 = 45
     \]

3. **Determine the Number of Plates Needed per Person:**
   - Each attendee will be served a 3-course meal.
   - For each course, a new plate is used.
   - Therefore, each person requires 3 plates.

4. **Calculate the Total Number of Plates Needed:**
   - With 45 attendees and 3 plates per person, the total number of plates needed is:
     \[
     45 \times 3 = 135
     \]

Thus, Wickham needs a total of 135 plates for his Christmas party.

**Final Answer: 135 plates**
