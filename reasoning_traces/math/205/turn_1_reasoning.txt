Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To determine how many plates Wickham needs for his Christmas party, we will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of guests.**
   - Wickham invites 30 people.
   - Half of the guests bring a plus one. Since half of 30 is 15, this means 15 guests will bring one additional person each.
   - Therefore, the total number of guests is:
     \[
     \text{Total guests} = 30 + 15 = 45
     \]

2. **Determine the number of plates needed per guest.**
   - Wickham is serving a 3-course meal. This means each guest will need a new plate for each course.
   - Therefore, each guest will require:
     \[
     \text{Plates per guest} = 3
     \]

3. **Calculate the total number of plates needed.**
   - To find the total number of plates, we multiply the total number of guests by the number of plates each guest needs:
     \[
     \text{Total plates} = \text{Total guests} \times \text{Plates per guest} = 45 \times 3
     \]
   - Performing the multiplication:
     \[
     45 \times 3 = 135
     \]

Thus, Wickham needs a total of **135 plates** for his Christmas party.

Final answer:
\[
\boxed{135}
\]
