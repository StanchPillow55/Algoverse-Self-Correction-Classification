Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of people attending the party and then calculate the total number of plates required for the 3-course meal.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of people attending the party.**

1. Wickham invites 30 people to the party.
2. Half of these guests bring a plus one. To find out how many guests bring a plus one, we calculate half of 30:
   \[
   \frac{30}{2} = 15
   \]
   So, 15 guests bring a plus one.

3. Each of these 15 guests brings one additional person, so the number of plus ones is 15.

4. Therefore, the total number of people attending the party is the sum of the original guests and the plus ones:
   \[
   30 + 15 = 45
   \]

**Step 2: Calculate the total number of plates needed.**

1. Each person at the party will be served a 3-course meal, and a new plate is used for each course.

2. Therefore, each person needs 3 plates (one for each course).

3. To find the total number of plates needed, multiply the total number of people by the number of plates per person:
   \[
   45 \times 3 = 135
   \]

**Final Answer:**

Wickham needs a total of 135 plates for his Christmas party.
