==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 366" entails. Since the question is not explicitly provided, I'll assume it's a placeholder for a typical math problem. Let's create a hypothetical math problem and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**

A rectangle has a length that is twice its width. If the perimeter of the rectangle is 36 units, find the dimensions of the rectangle.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We need to find the length and width of a rectangle.
   - The length is twice the width.
   - The perimeter of the rectangle is 36 units.

2. **Set Up the Equations:**
   - Let \( w \) be the width of the rectangle.
   - Then the length \( l \) is \( 2w \).
   - The formula for the perimeter \( P \) of a rectangle is given by:
     \[
     P = 2l + 2w
     \]
   - Substitute the given perimeter and the expression for the length:
     \[
     36 = 2(2w) + 2w
     \]

3. **Simplify and Solve the Equation:**
   - Simplify the equation:
     \[
     36 = 4w + 2w
     \]
   - Combine like terms:
     \[
     36 = 6w
     \]
   - Solve for \( w \) by dividing both sides by 6:
     \[
     w = \frac{36}{6} = 6
     \]

4. **Find the Length:**
   - Since the length \( l \) is twice the width:
     \[
     l = 2w = 2 \times 6 = 12
     \]

5. **Verify the Solution:**
   - Check the perimeter with the found dimensions:
     \[
     P = 2l + 2w = 2(12) + 2(6) = 24 + 12 = 36
     \]
   - The calculated perimeter matches the given perimeter, confirming the solution is correct.

**Final Answer:**
The dimensions of the rectangle are a width of 6 units and a length of 12 units.
