==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 366" refers to. Since the problem statement does not provide specific details about the question, I'll demonstrate a general approach to solving a typical math problem by creating a hypothetical problem and solving it step by step.

Let's assume "Sample reasoning question 366" is a problem involving basic algebra. Here's a hypothetical problem:

**Problem:**
Solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).

**Step-by-step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Equation:**
   The equation given is \( 2x + 3 = 11 \). This is a linear equation in one variable, \( x \).

2. **Isolate the Variable:**
   To solve for \( x \), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We start by eliminating the constant term on the left side.

   \[
   2x + 3 = 11
   \]

   Subtract 3 from both sides to remove the constant term from the left side:

   \[
   2x + 3 - 3 = 11 - 3
   \]

   Simplifying both sides gives:

   \[
   2x = 8
   \]

3. **Solve for \( x \):**
   Now, divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( x \):

   \[
   \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{8}{2}
   \]

   Simplifying both sides gives:

   \[
   x = 4
   \]

4. **Verify the Solution:**
   Substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation to verify the solution:

   \[
   2(4) + 3 = 11
   \]

   Simplifying the left side:

   \[
   8 + 3 = 11
   \]

   Since both sides of the equation are equal, our solution \( x = 4 \) is correct.

**Final Answer:**
The solution to the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \) is \( x = 4 \).

This step-by-step approach demonstrates how to solve a basic algebraic equation. If "Sample reasoning question 366" refers to a different type of problem, please provide more details, and I can adjust the solution accordingly.
