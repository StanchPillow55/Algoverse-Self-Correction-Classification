To determine how much money Raymond has left, we will follow these steps:

1. **Initial Amount**: Start with the amount of money Raymond initially had.
   \[
   \text{Initial Amount} = 21 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Savings from Allowance**: Add the amount he saved from his allowance.
   \[
   \text{Amount Saved} = 11 \text{ dollars}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total Amount after Saving} = \text{Initial Amount} + \text{Amount Saved} = 21 + 11 = 32 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Spending on Comic Book**: Subtract the amount he spent on the comic book.
   \[
   \text{Amount Spent on Comic Book} = 5 \text{ dollars}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Amount after Comic Book} = \text{Total Amount after Saving} - \text{Amount Spent on Comic Book} = 32 - 5 = 27 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Spending on Puzzle**: Subtract the amount he spent on the puzzle.
   \[
   \text{Amount Spent on Puzzle} = 19 \text{ dollars}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Amount after Puzzle} = \text{Amount after Comic Book} - \text{Amount Spent on Puzzle} = 27 - 19 = 8 \text{ dollars}
   \]

5. **Final Amount**: The amount of money Raymond has left after all transactions.
   \[
   \text{Final Amount} = 8 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Thus, after saving from his allowance and making his purchases, Raymond has **$8 left**.

**Final Answer**: Raymond has $8 left.
