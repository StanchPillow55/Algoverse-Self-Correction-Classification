To solve a math problem, I need the specific details or numbers involved in the problem. Since "Sample math problem 13" doesn't provide any specific details or context, I'll create a sample math problem and solve it step by step.

**Sample Math Problem:**

A rectangle has a length that is 3 times its width. If the perimeter of the rectangle is 48 units, what are the dimensions of the rectangle?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the problem:**
   - We have a rectangle with a length (L) and a width (W).
   - The length is 3 times the width: \( L = 3W \).
   - The perimeter of the rectangle is 48 units.

2. **Recall the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle:**
   \[
   \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (\text{Length} + \text{Width})
   \]

3. **Set up the equation using the given perimeter:**
   \[
   2 \times (L + W) = 48
   \]

4. **Substitute the expression for the length (L = 3W) into the perimeter equation:**
   \[
   2 \times (3W + W) = 48
   \]

5. **Simplify the equation:**
   \[
   2 \times 4W = 48
   \]
   \[
   8W = 48
   \]

6. **Solve for W (width):**
   \[
   W = \frac{48}{8} = 6
   \]

7. **Find the length using the relationship \( L = 3W \):**
   \[
   L = 3 \times 6 = 18
   \]

8. **Verify the solution:**
   - Check the perimeter with the found dimensions:
   \[
   2 \times (18 + 6) = 2 \times 24 = 48
   \]
   - The calculated perimeter matches the given perimeter, confirming our solution is correct.

**Final Answer:**

The dimensions of the rectangle are:
- Width (W) = 6 units
- Length (L) = 18 units
