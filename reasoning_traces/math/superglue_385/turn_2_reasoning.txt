Question ID: superglue_385
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 385" refers to. Since the question itself is not provided, I'll demonstrate how to approach a generic math problem using logical reasoning and step-by-step calculations. Let's assume a hypothetical math problem for demonstration purposes:

**Hypothetical Problem:**
"Calculate the area of a triangle with a base of 10 units and a height of 5 units."

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We are asked to find the area of a triangle.
   - We are given the base (\(b\)) of the triangle as 10 units.
   - We are given the height (\(h\)) of the triangle as 5 units.

2. **Recall the Formula:**
   - The formula for the area (\(A\)) of a triangle is:
     \[
     A = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height}
     \]

3. **Substitute the Given Values:**
   - Substitute the base and height into the formula:
     \[
     A = \frac{1}{2} \times 10 \times 5
     \]

4. **Perform the Calculations:**
   - First, multiply the base and height:
     \[
     10 \times 5 = 50
     \]
   - Then, multiply by \(\frac{1}{2}\):
     \[
     A = \frac{1}{2} \times 50 = 25
     \]

5. **State the Final Answer:**
   - The area of the triangle is 25 square units.

**Final Answer:**
The area of the triangle is 25 square units.

This step-by-step approach ensures that we understand the problem, recall the relevant formulas, substitute the given values, perform the necessary calculations, and arrive at the correct final answer. If you have a specific problem labeled "Sample reasoning question 385," please provide the details, and I can work through that specific problem.
