Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to understand what "Sample reasoning question 385" entails. However, without specific details or context about what "Sample reasoning question 385" refers to, I will demonstrate a general approach to solving a math problem by creating a hypothetical problem and solving it step-by-step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**

Let's assume "Sample reasoning question 385" is a math problem that involves solving a quadratic equation. The problem is as follows:

"Find the roots of the quadratic equation \(2x^2 - 4x - 6 = 0\)."

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Identify the quadratic equation:**
   The given quadratic equation is \(2x^2 - 4x - 6 = 0\).

2. **Write the equation in standard form:**
   The standard form of a quadratic equation is \(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\).
   Here, \(a = 2\), \(b = -4\), and \(c = -6\).

3. **Use the quadratic formula:**
   The quadratic formula to find the roots of \(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\) is:
   \[
   x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
   \]

4. **Calculate the discriminant (\(b^2 - 4ac\)):**
   \[
   b^2 - 4ac = (-4)^2 - 4 \times 2 \times (-6)
   \]
   \[
   = 16 + 48
   \]
   \[
   = 64
   \]

5. **Calculate the roots using the quadratic formula:**
   Since the discriminant is positive, there are two real and distinct roots.
   \[
   x = \frac{-(-4) \pm \sqrt{64}}{2 \times 2}
   \]
   \[
   = \frac{4 \pm 8}{4}
   \]

6. **Find the two roots:**
   - First root:
     \[
     x_1 = \frac{4 + 8}{4} = \frac{12}{4} = 3
     \]

   - Second root:
     \[
     x_2 = \frac{4 - 8}{4} = \frac{-4}{4} = -1
     \]

7. **State the final answer:**
   The roots of the quadratic equation \(2x^2 - 4x - 6 = 0\) are \(x = 3\) and \(x = -1\).

This solution demonstrates the process of solving a quadratic equation using the quadratic formula. If "Sample reasoning question 385" refers to a different type of problem, please provide additional details or context for a more accurate solution.
