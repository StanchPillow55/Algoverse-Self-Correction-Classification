==================================================

To determine how many minutes Kim slept on her bed that day, we need to analyze the information provided step by step.

1. **Normal Sleep Schedule**:
   - Kim usually goes to sleep at 10 p.m. and wakes up at 6 a.m.
   - The total duration of her usual sleep is from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m., which is 8 hours.

2. **Waking Up Early**:
   - On the day in question, Kim woke up 5 minutes earlier than usual.
   - Normally, she wakes up at 6:00 a.m., so waking up 5 minutes earlier means she woke up at:
     \[
     6:00 \text{ a.m.} - 0:05 \text{ (5 minutes)} = 5:55 \text{ a.m.}
     \]

3. **Sleepwalking Duration**:
   - Kim was sleepwalking from 2:15 a.m. to 2:38 a.m.
   - To find the duration of her sleepwalking, we calculate the time from 2:15 a.m. to 2:38 a.m.:
     \[
     2:38 \text{ a.m.} - 2:15 \text{ a.m.} = 23 \text{ minutes}
     \]

4. **Total Sleep Duration**:
   - Now, we need to calculate how long she slept in total that night.
   - She went to sleep at 10:00 p.m. and woke up at 5:55 a.m.
   - The total sleep duration is from 10:00 p.m. to 5:55 a.m.:
     - From 10:00 p.m. to 5:00 a.m. is 7 hours (or 420 minutes).
     - From 5:00 a.m. to 5:55 a.m. is 55 minutes.
     - Therefore, the total sleep duration is:
     \[
     420 \text{ minutes} + 55 \text{ minutes} = 475 \text{ minutes}
     \]

5. **Calculating Actual Sleep Time**:
   - During her sleep, she was sleepwalking for 23 minutes.
   - This means that during those 23 minutes, she was not in bed sleeping.
   - Therefore, the actual time she spent sleeping in bed is:
     \[
     475 \text{ minutes} - 23 \text{ minutes} = 452 \text{ minutes}
     \]

6. **Final Answer**:
   - Kim slept for a total of **452 minutes** on her bed that day.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{452}
\]
