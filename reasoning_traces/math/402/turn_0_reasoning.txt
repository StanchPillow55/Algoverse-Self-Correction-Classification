To solve this problem, we need to follow several steps to calculate the total profit made by the production company. Let's break it down step by step.

### Step 1: Calculate the Total Gross Revenue

The movie made $120 million during its opening weekend. It is stated that the movie makes 3.5 times that amount during its entire run. Therefore, we need to calculate the total gross revenue for the entire run of the movie.

\[
\text{Total Gross Revenue} = 3.5 \times \text{Opening Weekend Revenue}
\]

Substitute the opening weekend revenue:

\[
\text{Total Gross Revenue} = 3.5 \times 120 \, \text{million}
\]

\[
\text{Total Gross Revenue} = 420 \, \text{million}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the Production Company's Share

The production company gets to keep 60% of the total gross revenue. We need to calculate how much money that is.

\[
\text{Production Company's Share} = 0.60 \times \text{Total Gross Revenue}
\]

Substitute the total gross revenue:

\[
\text{Production Company's Share} = 0.60 \times 420 \, \text{million}
\]

\[
\text{Production Company's Share} = 252 \, \text{million}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the Profit

Profit is calculated as the difference between the production company's share and the production cost of the movie. The movie cost $60 million to produce.

\[
\text{Profit} = \text{Production Company's Share} - \text{Production Cost}
\]

Substitute the values:

\[
\text{Profit} = 252 \, \text{million} - 60 \, \text{million}
\]

\[
\text{Profit} = 192 \, \text{million}
\]

### Final Answer

The production company made a profit of $192 million from the movie.
