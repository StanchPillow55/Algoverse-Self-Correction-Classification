To solve the problem, we will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total box office revenue for the entire run of the movie.**
2. **Determine the amount the production company keeps from the total revenue.**
3. **Calculate the profit by subtracting the production cost from the amount the production company keeps.**

### Step 1: Calculate Total Box Office Revenue

The movie made $120 million in its opening weekend and ended up making 3.5 times that amount during its entire run. 

To find the total box office revenue:
\[
\text{Total Revenue} = \text{Opening Weekend Revenue} \times 3.5
\]
\[
\text{Total Revenue} = 120 \text{ million} \times 3.5 = 420 \text{ million}
\]

### Step 2: Determine the Amount the Production Company Keeps

The production company gets to keep 60% of the total box office revenue. 

To find the amount they keep:
\[
\text{Amount Kept} = \text{Total Revenue} \times 0.60
\]
\[
\text{Amount Kept} = 420 \text{ million} \times 0.60 = 252 \text{ million}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the Profit

The profit is calculated by subtracting the production cost from the amount the production company keeps.

The production cost of the movie is $60 million. 

To find the profit:
\[
\text{Profit} = \text{Amount Kept} - \text{Production Cost}
\]
\[
\text{Profit} = 252 \text{ million} - 60 \text{ million} = 192 \text{ million}
\]

### Final Answer

The profit made by the production company is:
\[
\boxed{192 \text{ million}}
\]
