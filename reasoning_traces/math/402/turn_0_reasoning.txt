==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to determine how much flour and milk Mark needs for a quadruple batch of brownies and then calculate how many bags of flour and bottles of milk he needs to buy.

### Step 1: Calculate the ingredients needed for a quadruple batch

The normal recipe calls for:
- **Flour**: 3 cups
- **Milk**: 1 cup

Since Mark is making a quadruple batch, we multiply the amounts by 4:

- **Flour needed**:
  \[
  3 \text{ cups} \times 4 = 12 \text{ cups}
  \]

- **Milk needed**:
  \[
  1 \text{ cup} \times 4 = 4 \text{ cups}
  \]

### Step 2: Determine how many bags of flour and bottles of milk are needed

Flour is sold in 2-cup bags, and milk is sold in 2-cup bottles.

- **Bags of flour needed**:
  To find out how many bags of flour Mark needs, we divide the total cups of flour by the cups per bag:
  \[
  \frac{12 \text{ cups}}{2 \text{ cups/bag}} = 6 \text{ bags}
  \]

- **Bottles of milk needed**:
  Similarly, for the milk:
  \[
  \frac{4 \text{ cups}}{2 \text{ cups/bottle}} = 2 \text{ bottles}
  \]

### Step 3: Calculate how many more bags of flour than bottles of milk Mark needs to buy

Now we need to find the difference between the number of bags of flour and bottles of milk:
\[
6 \text{ bags} - 2 \text{ bottles} = 4
\]

### Final Answer

Mark needs to buy **4 more bags of flour than bottles of milk**.
