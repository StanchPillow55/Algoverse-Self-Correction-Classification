==================================================

To find the profit made by the production company from the movie, we will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total box office revenue for the entire run of the movie.**
2. **Determine how much money the production company keeps from that revenue.**
3. **Subtract the production costs from the amount the company keeps to find the profit.**

### Step 1: Calculate Total Box Office Revenue

The movie made $120 million in its opening weekend. It made 3.5 times that amount during its entire run. 

To find the total box office revenue, we multiply the opening weekend revenue by 3.5:

\[
\text{Total Box Office Revenue} = \text{Opening Weekend Revenue} \times 3.5
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\text{Total Box Office Revenue} = 120 \text{ million} \times 3.5 = 420 \text{ million}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the Amount the Production Company Keeps

The production company gets to keep 60% of the total box office revenue. We can calculate this by multiplying the total box office revenue by 0.60:

\[
\text{Amount Kept by Production Company} = \text{Total Box Office Revenue} \times 0.60
\]

Substituting the total box office revenue we calculated:

\[
\text{Amount Kept by Production Company} = 420 \text{ million} \times 0.60 = 252 \text{ million}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the Profit

To find the profit, we need to subtract the production costs from the amount the production company keeps. The production cost of the movie is $60 million.

\[
\text{Profit} = \text{Amount Kept by Production Company} - \text{Production Cost}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\text{Profit} = 252 \text{ million} - 60 \text{ million} = 192 \text{ million}
\]

### Final Answer

The profit made by the production company is:

\[
\boxed{192 \text{ million}}
\]
