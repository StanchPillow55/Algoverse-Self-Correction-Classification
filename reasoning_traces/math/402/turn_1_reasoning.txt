==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total revenue the movie made during its entire run, determine how much of that revenue the production company keeps, and then subtract the production costs to find the profit.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Calculate Total Revenue:**
   - The movie made $120 million during its opening weekend.
   - It makes 3.5 times that amount during its entire run.
   - Total revenue = Opening weekend revenue × 3.5
   \[
   \text{Total revenue} = 120 \, \text{million} \times 3.5 = 420 \, \text{million}
   \]

2. **Calculate the Production Company's Share:**
   - The production company keeps 60% of the total revenue.
   - Production company's share = Total revenue × 60%
   \[
   \text{Production company's share} = 420 \, \text{million} \times 0.60 = 252 \, \text{million}
   \]

3. **Calculate Profit:**
   - Profit is calculated as the production company's share minus the production costs.
   - Production cost = $60 million
   - Profit = Production company's share - Production cost
   \[
   \text{Profit} = 252 \, \text{million} - 60 \, \text{million} = 192 \, \text{million}
   \]

### Final Answer:
The production company made a profit of $192 million.
