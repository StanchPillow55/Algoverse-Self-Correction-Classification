Question ID: 402
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine the total revenue the movie made during its entire run, calculate the amount the production company gets to keep, and then subtract the production costs to find the profit.

**Step 1: Calculate the total revenue for the entire run of the movie.**

The movie made $120 million during its opening weekend. It is stated that the movie makes 3.5 times that amount during its entire run. Therefore, we calculate the total revenue as follows:

\[
\text{Total Revenue} = 3.5 \times \text{Opening Weekend Revenue}
\]

\[
\text{Total Revenue} = 3.5 \times 120 \text{ million}
\]

\[
\text{Total Revenue} = 420 \text{ million}
\]

**Step 2: Calculate the amount the production company gets to keep.**

The production company keeps 60% of the total revenue. To find this amount, we calculate:

\[
\text{Amount Kept} = 0.60 \times \text{Total Revenue}
\]

\[
\text{Amount Kept} = 0.60 \times 420 \text{ million}
\]

\[
\text{Amount Kept} = 252 \text{ million}
\]

**Step 3: Calculate the profit.**

Profit is calculated by subtracting the production costs from the amount the production company keeps. The production cost is given as $60 million.

\[
\text{Profit} = \text{Amount Kept} - \text{Production Cost}
\]

\[
\text{Profit} = 252 \text{ million} - 60 \text{ million}
\]

\[
\text{Profit} = 192 \text{ million}
\]

**Final Answer:**

The production company made a profit of $192 million.
