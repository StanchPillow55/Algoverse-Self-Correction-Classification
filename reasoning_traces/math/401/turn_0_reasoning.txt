To find out how many pounds of firewood Ela collected, we can start by setting up an equation based on the information given in the problem.

1. **Identify the known quantities**:
   - Kimberley collects 10 pounds of firewood.
   - Houston collects 12 pounds of firewood.
   - The total amount of firewood collected by all three (Kimberley, Ela, and Houston) is 35 pounds.

2. **Set up the equation**:
   Let \( E \) represent the amount of firewood collected by Ela. The total amount of firewood collected can be expressed as:
   \[
   \text{Total} = \text{Kimberley's amount} + \text{Houston's amount} + \text{Ela's amount}
   \]
   Substituting the known values into the equation gives us:
   \[
   35 = 10 + 12 + E
   \]

3. **Combine the known amounts**:
   First, we need to add Kimberley’s and Houston’s amounts together:
   \[
   10 + 12 = 22
   \]
   Now we can rewrite the equation:
   \[
   35 = 22 + E
   \]

4. **Solve for \( E \)**:
   To find \( E \), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We can do this by subtracting 22 from both sides:
   \[
   E = 35 - 22
   \]
   Performing the subtraction gives:
   \[
   E = 13
   \]

5. **Conclusion**:
   Therefore, the amount of firewood collected by Ela is \( \boxed{13} \) pounds.
