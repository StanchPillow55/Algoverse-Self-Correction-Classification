==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine how many pounds of firewood Ela collected. We know the total amount of firewood collected by Kimberley, Ela, and Houston is 35 pounds. We also know the individual amounts collected by Kimberley and Houston.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the known quantities:**
   - Kimberley collected 10 pounds of firewood.
   - Houston collected 12 pounds of firewood.
   - The total amount of firewood collected by all three is 35 pounds.

2. **Set up an equation to represent the situation:**
   Let \( E \) represent the amount of firewood collected by Ela. According to the problem, the sum of the firewood collected by Kimberley, Ela, and Houston is 35 pounds. Therefore, we can write the equation:
   \[
   10 + E + 12 = 35
   \]

3. **Simplify the equation:**
   Combine the known quantities (the firewood collected by Kimberley and Houston):
   \[
   22 + E = 35
   \]

4. **Solve for \( E \):**
   To find the value of \( E \), subtract 22 from both sides of the equation:
   \[
   E = 35 - 22
   \]
   \[
   E = 13
   \]

5. **Conclusion:**
   Ela collected 13 pounds of firewood.

Therefore, the final answer is that Ela collected 13 pounds of firewood.
