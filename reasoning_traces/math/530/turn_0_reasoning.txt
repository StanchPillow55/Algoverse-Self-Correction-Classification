To find the total number of hours Josh spent working out over the 8 weeks, we can break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate the total hours for the weeks without exceptions**:
   - Josh worked out for 4 hours each week for 8 weeks.
   - The total hours for these weeks is calculated as follows:
     \[
     \text{Total hours without exceptions} = 4 \text{ hours/week} \times 8 \text{ weeks} = 32 \text{ hours}
     \]

2. **Identify the exceptions**:
   - Josh spent 5 hours for two consecutive weeks. This means he worked out for 5 hours in each of those two weeks.
   - The total hours for these two weeks is:
     \[
     \text{Total hours for 5 hours/week} = 5 \text{ hours/week} \times 2 \text{ weeks} = 10 \text{ hours}
     \]
   - Josh also spent 6 hours in one week. Therefore, the total hours for this week is:
     \[
     \text{Total hours for 6 hours/week} = 6 \text{ hours}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total hours spent in the weeks with exceptions**:
   - The total hours spent during the weeks with exceptions (2 weeks at 5 hours and 1 week at 6 hours) is:
     \[
     \text{Total hours with exceptions} = 10 \text{ hours} + 6 \text{ hours} = 16 \text{ hours}
     \]

4. **Determine the number of weeks without exceptions**:
   - Since there are 8 weeks total and 3 weeks accounted for (2 weeks at 5 hours and 1 week at 6 hours), the number of weeks where he worked out for 4 hours is:
     \[
     \text{Weeks without exceptions} = 8 \text{ weeks} - 3 \text{ weeks} = 5 \text{ weeks}
     \]

5. **Calculate the total hours for the weeks without exceptions**:
   - The total hours for these 5 weeks is:
     \[
     \text{Total hours for 5 weeks} = 4 \text{ hours/week} \times 5 \text{ weeks} = 20 \text{ hours}
     \]

6. **Combine the total hours**:
   - Now, we add the total hours from the weeks without exceptions to the total hours from the weeks with exceptions:
     \[
     \text{Total hours} = \text{Total hours without exceptions} + \text{Total hours with exceptions}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total hours} = 20 \text{ hours} + 16 \text{ hours} = 36 \text{ hours}
     \]

Thus, the total number of hours Josh has spent working out across the 8 weeks is:
\[
\boxed{36} \text{ hours}
\]
