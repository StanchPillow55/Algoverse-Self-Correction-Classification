Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, let's first understand what "Sample reasoning question 294" might entail. Since the problem statement is not explicitly given, I'll assume this is a placeholder for a typical math problem. I'll create a hypothetical problem and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**

"Calculate the sum of all even numbers between 1 and 100."

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Identify the Even Numbers:**
   - Even numbers between 1 and 100 are numbers like 2, 4, 6, ..., 100.
   - These numbers form an arithmetic sequence where the first term \(a_1 = 2\) and the common difference \(d = 2\).

2. **Determine the Number of Terms:**
   - The last term \(a_n = 100\).
   - The formula for the \(n\)-th term of an arithmetic sequence is given by:
     \[
     a_n = a_1 + (n-1) \cdot d
     \]
   - Plugging in the known values:
     \[
     100 = 2 + (n-1) \cdot 2
     \]
     \[
     100 = 2 + 2n - 2
     \]
     \[
     100 = 2n
     \]
     \[
     n = 50
     \]
   - There are 50 even numbers between 1 and 100.

3. **Calculate the Sum of the Sequence:**
   - The sum \(S_n\) of the first \(n\) terms of an arithmetic sequence is given by:
     \[
     S_n = \frac{n}{2} \cdot (a_1 + a_n)
     \]
   - Substituting the known values:
     \[
     S_{50} = \frac{50}{2} \cdot (2 + 100)
     \]
     \[
     S_{50} = 25 \cdot 102
     \]
     \[
     S_{50} = 2550
     \]

**Final Answer:**

The sum of all even numbers between 1 and 100 is 2550.
