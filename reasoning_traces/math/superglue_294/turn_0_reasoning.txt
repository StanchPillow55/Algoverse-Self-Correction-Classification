==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 294" entails. Since the problem statement is not specific, I'll assume it's a placeholder for a typical math problem. Let's consider a common type of math problem and solve it step by step.

Let's assume the problem is as follows:

**Problem:**
A company sells two products, A and B. The profit from selling one unit of product A is $3, and the profit from selling one unit of product B is $5. The company sold a total of 294 units of both products combined, and the total profit was $1,200. How many units of each product did the company sell?

**Solution:**

To solve this problem, we can set up a system of equations based on the information given.

1. **Define the variables:**
   - Let \( x \) be the number of units of product A sold.
   - Let \( y \) be the number of units of product B sold.

2. **Set up the equations:**
   - The total number of units sold is 294:
     \[
     x + y = 294
     \]
   - The total profit from selling these units is $1,200:
     \[
     3x + 5y = 1200
     \]

3. **Solve the system of equations:**

   We can use the substitution or elimination method. Here, I'll use the substitution method.

   From the first equation, solve for \( y \):
   \[
   y = 294 - x
   \]

   Substitute \( y = 294 - x \) into the second equation:
   \[
   3x + 5(294 - x) = 1200
   \]

   Simplify and solve for \( x \):
   \[
   3x + 1470 - 5x = 1200
   \]
   \[
   -2x + 1470 = 1200
   \]
   \[
   -2x = 1200 - 1470
   \]
   \[
   -2x = -270
   \]
   \[
   x = \frac{-270}{-2}
   \]
   \[
   x = 135
   \]

   Now, substitute \( x = 135 \) back into the equation for \( y \):
   \[
   y = 294 - 135
   \]
   \[
   y = 159
   \]

4. **Verify the solution:**

   Check the total number of units:
   \[
   x + y = 135 + 159 = 294
   \]

   Check the total profit:
   \[
   3x + 5y = 3(135) + 5(159) = 405 + 795 = 1200
   \]

Both conditions are satisfied, confirming our solution is correct.

**Final Answer:**
The company sold 135 units of product A and 159 units of product B.
