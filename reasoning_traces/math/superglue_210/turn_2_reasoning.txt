==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 210" refers to. Since the problem statement is not explicitly provided, I will assume this is a placeholder for a typical math problem. Let's create a hypothetical math problem and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**
A company produces two types of widgets: Type A and Type B. The company sells Type A widgets for $50 each and Type B widgets for $70 each. In one week, the company sold a total of 210 widgets and made $12,600 in revenue. How many of each type of widget did the company sell?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Define Variables:**
   Let \( x \) be the number of Type A widgets sold.
   Let \( y \) be the number of Type B widgets sold.

2. **Set Up Equations:**
   We have two pieces of information that can be translated into equations:
   - The total number of widgets sold is 210.
   - The total revenue from selling these widgets is $12,600.

   From the first piece of information, we have:
   \[
   x + y = 210
   \]

   From the second piece of information, we have:
   \[
   50x + 70y = 12,600
   \]

3. **Solve the System of Equations:**
   We have the system:
   \[
   \begin{align*}
   x + y &= 210 \quad \text{(Equation 1)} \\
   50x + 70y &= 12,600 \quad \text{(Equation 2)}
   \end{align*}
   \]

   First, solve Equation 1 for \( y \):
   \[
   y = 210 - x
   \]

   Substitute \( y = 210 - x \) into Equation 2:
   \[
   50x + 70(210 - x) = 12,600
   \]

   Distribute the 70:
   \[
   50x + 14,700 - 70x = 12,600
   \]

   Combine like terms:
   \[
   -20x + 14,700 = 12,600
   \]

   Subtract 14,700 from both sides:
   \[
   -20x = 12,600 - 14,700
   \]
   \[
   -20x = -2,100
   \]

   Divide both sides by -20:
   \[
   x = \frac{-2,100}{-20}
   \]
   \[
   x = 105
   \]

   Substitute \( x = 105 \) back into the equation for \( y \):
   \[
   y = 210 - 105
   \]
   \[
   y = 105
   \]

4. **Verify the Solution:**
   Check that these values satisfy both original equations:
   - \( x + y = 105 + 105 = 210 \) (satisfied)
   - \( 50x + 70y = 50(105) + 70(105) = 5,250 + 7,350 = 12,600 \) (satisfied)

Both equations are satisfied, so the solution is correct.

**Final Answer:**
The company sold 105 Type A widgets and 105 Type B widgets.
