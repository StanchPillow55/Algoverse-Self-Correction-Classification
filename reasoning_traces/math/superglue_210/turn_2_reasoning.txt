==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 210" refers to. However, since the problem statement is not clear or specific, I will assume this is a placeholder for a typical math problem. Let's create a hypothetical math problem and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**

A company produces two types of widgets: Type A and Type B. The profit from each Type A widget is $5, and the profit from each Type B widget is $8. The company can produce a maximum of 100 widgets per day due to resource constraints. Additionally, the production of Type B widgets cannot exceed 60% of the total production. How many of each type of widget should the company produce to maximize profit?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( x \) be the number of Type A widgets produced.
   - Let \( y \) be the number of Type B widgets produced.

2. **Set Up the Objective Function:**
   - The objective is to maximize the profit, \( P \).
   - Profit from Type A widgets = \( 5x \).
   - Profit from Type B widgets = \( 8y \).
   - Total profit, \( P = 5x + 8y \).

3. **Set Up the Constraints:**
   - Total production constraint: \( x + y \leq 100 \).
   - Type B production constraint: \( y \leq 0.6(x + y) \).

4. **Simplify the Type B Production Constraint:**
   - \( y \leq 0.6x + 0.6y \).
   - Rearrange to get: \( 0.4y \leq 0.6x \).
   - Simplify: \( y \leq 1.5x \).

5. **Non-negativity Constraints:**
   - \( x \geq 0 \).
   - \( y \geq 0 \).

6. **Graph the Constraints:**
   - Plot the line \( x + y = 100 \).
   - Plot the line \( y = 1.5x \).
   - Identify the feasible region bounded by these lines and the axes.

7. **Find the Corner Points of the Feasible Region:**
   - Intersection of \( x + y = 100 \) and \( y = 1.5x \):
     - Substitute \( y = 1.5x \) into \( x + y = 100 \):
     - \( x + 1.5x = 100 \).
     - \( 2.5x = 100 \).
     - \( x = 40 \).
     - \( y = 1.5(40) = 60 \).
     - Point: \( (40, 60) \).

   - Intersection of \( x + y = 100 \) and \( y = 0 \):
     - \( x + 0 = 100 \).
     - \( x = 100 \).
     - Point: \( (100, 0) \).

   - Intersection of \( y = 1.5x \) and \( x = 0 \):
     - \( y = 1.5(0) = 0 \).
     - Point: \( (0, 0) \).

8. **Evaluate the Objective Function at Each Corner Point:**
   - \( P(40, 60) = 5(40) + 8(60) = 200 + 480 = 680 \).
   - \( P(100, 0) = 5(100) + 8(0) = 500 \).
   - \( P(0, 0) = 5(0) + 8(0) = 0 \).

9. **Determine the Maximum Profit:**
   - The maximum profit is \( 680 \) at the point \( (40, 60) \).

**Final Answer:**
To maximize profit, the company should produce 40 Type A widgets and 60 Type B widgets, resulting in a maximum profit of $680.
