==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to determine the cost of the two remaining pizzas given that the total cost of all four pizzas is 64 dollars and that two of the pizzas cost 30 dollars.

### Step 1: Determine the total cost of the two remaining pizzas

We know the total cost of all four pizzas is 64 dollars. We also know that the cost of two of the pizzas is 30 dollars. Therefore, we can find the cost of the remaining two pizzas by subtracting the cost of the first two pizzas from the total cost:

\[
\text{Cost of remaining pizzas} = \text{Total cost} - \text{Cost of first two pizzas}
\]

Substituting the known values:

\[
\text{Cost of remaining pizzas} = 64 - 30 = 34 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Step 2: Determine the cost of each of the remaining pizzas

Since the problem states that the two remaining pizzas cost the same amount, we can let \( x \) represent the cost of each of these two pizzas. Therefore, we can express the total cost of the two remaining pizzas as:

\[
2x = 34
\]

### Step 3: Solve for \( x \)

To find the value of \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 2:

\[
x = \frac{34}{2} = 17
\]

### Conclusion

Thus, the cost of each of the other two pizzas is 17 dollars.

Final answer: Each of the other two pizzas costs **17 dollars**.
