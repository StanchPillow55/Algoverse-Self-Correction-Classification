Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine Haley's height after 10 years, given her current height and her annual growth rate.

**Step-by-step Solution:**

1. **Identify the Current Height:**
   - Haley's current height is 20 inches.

2. **Determine the Growth Rate:**
   - Haley grows at a rate of 3 inches per year.

3. **Calculate the Total Growth Over 10 Years:**
   - Since Haley grows 3 inches each year, over 10 years, her total growth will be:
     \[
     \text{Total Growth} = \text{Growth Rate} \times \text{Number of Years} = 3 \, \text{inches/year} \times 10 \, \text{years} = 30 \, \text{inches}
     \]

4. **Calculate Haley's Height After 10 Years:**
   - Add the total growth over 10 years to her current height:
     \[
     \text{Height After 10 Years} = \text{Current Height} + \text{Total Growth} = 20 \, \text{inches} + 30 \, \text{inches} = 50 \, \text{inches}
     \]

**Final Answer:**
Haley's height after 10 years will be 50 inches.
