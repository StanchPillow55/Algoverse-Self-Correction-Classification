==================================================

To determine Haley's height after 10 years, we can follow these steps:

1. **Identify the current height**: Haley is currently 20 inches tall.

2. **Identify the growth rate**: Haley grows at a rate of 3 inches per year.

3. **Determine the number of years**: We want to find her height after 10 years.

4. **Calculate the total growth over 10 years**: 
   - Since she grows 3 inches each year, we can calculate the total growth over 10 years by multiplying the growth rate by the number of years.
   \[
   \text{Total Growth} = \text{Growth Rate} \times \text{Number of Years} = 3 \text{ inches/year} \times 10 \text{ years} = 30 \text{ inches}
   \]

5. **Calculate her height after 10 years**: 
   - To find her height after 10 years, we add the total growth to her current height.
   \[
   \text{Height after 10 years} = \text{Current Height} + \text{Total Growth} = 20 \text{ inches} + 30 \text{ inches} = 50 \text{ inches}
   \]

Thus, after 10 years, Haley will be 50 inches tall.

**Final Answer**: 50 inches
