==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to determine how many spoons were in the package that Julia bought. Let's break down the information given step by step.

1. **Understanding the Information**:
   - Julia bought a package of spoons (let's denote the number of spoons in this package as \( x \)).
   - Her husband bought an additional package of 5 spoons.
   - Julia used 3 spoons to sample her stew.
   - After using the spoons, she had a total of 12 spoons available when setting the table.

2. **Setting Up the Equation**:
   - Initially, before using any spoons, the total number of spoons Julia had is:
     \[
     x + 5
     \]
   - After using 3 spoons, the number of spoons left is:
     \[
     (x + 5) - 3
     \]
   - We know that after using the spoons, she had a total of 12 spoons left. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
     \[
     (x + 5) - 3 = 12
     \]

3. **Solving the Equation**:
   - Simplifying the left side of the equation:
     \[
     x + 5 - 3 = 12
     \]
     \[
     x + 2 = 12
     \]
   - Now, we will isolate \( x \) by subtracting 2 from both sides:
     \[
     x = 12 - 2
     \]
     \[
     x = 10
     \]

4. **Conclusion**:
   - Julia bought a package of 10 spoons.

Thus, the final answer is that Julia bought **10 spoons** in the package.
