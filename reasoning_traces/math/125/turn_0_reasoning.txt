To solve this problem, we need to determine how much Haley's height will increase over the next 10 years and then add that increase to her current height.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Identify the current height and growth rate:**
   - Haley's current height is 20 inches.
   - Haley grows at a rate of 3 inches per year.

2. **Calculate the total growth over 10 years:**
   - Since Haley grows 3 inches each year, we need to calculate how much she will grow in 10 years.
   - To find the total growth over 10 years, multiply the annual growth rate by the number of years:
     \[
     \text{Total Growth} = 3 \, \text{inches/year} \times 10 \, \text{years} = 30 \, \text{inches}
     \]

3. **Determine Haley's height after 10 years:**
   - Add the total growth over 10 years to her current height:
     \[
     \text{Height after 10 years} = \text{Current Height} + \text{Total Growth}
     \]
   - Substitute the known values:
     \[
     \text{Height after 10 years} = 20 \, \text{inches} + 30 \, \text{inches} = 50 \, \text{inches}
     \]

### Final Answer:
Haley's height after 10 years will be 50 inches.
