==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine Haley's height after 10 years, given her current height and her annual growth rate.

**Step-by-step reasoning:**

1. **Identify the current height and growth rate:**
   - Haley's current height is 20 inches.
   - She grows at a rate of 3 inches per year.

2. **Determine the number of years over which she will grow:**
   - We are interested in her height after 10 years.

3. **Calculate the total growth over 10 years:**
   - Since Haley grows 3 inches each year, over 10 years, her total growth will be:
     \[
     \text{Total growth} = \text{Growth per year} \times \text{Number of years} = 3 \, \text{inches/year} \times 10 \, \text{years} = 30 \, \text{inches}
     \]

4. **Calculate Haley's height after 10 years:**
   - To find her height after 10 years, add the total growth to her current height:
     \[
     \text{Height after 10 years} = \text{Current height} + \text{Total growth} = 20 \, \text{inches} + 30 \, \text{inches} = 50 \, \text{inches}
     \]

**Final Answer:**
Haley will be 50 inches tall after 10 years.
