==================================================

To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step.

1. **Determine how many times Anne went down the slide**:
   - We know that Mitchel went down the water slide 30 times.
   - Anne went down the slide 30% less than Mitchel. 
   - First, we need to calculate 30% of Mitchel's total:
     \[
     30\% \text{ of } 30 = 0.30 \times 30 = 9
     \]
   - Now, we subtract this amount from Mitchel's total to find out how many times Anne went down the slide:
     \[
     \text{Anne's total} = \text{Mitchel's total} - 30\% \text{ of Mitchel's total} = 30 - 9 = 21
     \]

2. **Determine how many times Robert went down the slide**:
   - We know that Robert went down the slide 4 times as much as Anne.
   - We already calculated that Anne went down the slide 21 times.
   - Now, we multiply Anne's total by 4 to find Robert's total:
     \[
     \text{Robert's total} = 4 \times \text{Anne's total} = 4 \times 21 = 84
     \]

3. **Final Answer**:
   - Therefore, Robert went down the water slide **84 times**.

In conclusion, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{84}
\]
