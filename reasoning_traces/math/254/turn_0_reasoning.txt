To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of cars Nate walked past in both Section G and Section H, and then calculate how long it took him to walk past all these cars at a rate of 11 cars per minute.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of cars in Section G.**

Section G has 15 rows, and each row holds 10 cars. Therefore, the total number of cars in Section G is calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Total cars in Section G} = 15 \text{ rows} \times 10 \text{ cars per row} = 150 \text{ cars}
\]

**Step 2: Calculate the total number of cars in Section H.**

Section H has 20 rows, and each row holds 9 cars. Therefore, the total number of cars in Section H is calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Total cars in Section H} = 20 \text{ rows} \times 9 \text{ cars per row} = 180 \text{ cars}
\]

**Step 3: Calculate the total number of cars Nate walked past in both sections.**

To find the total number of cars Nate walked past, we add the number of cars in Section G and Section H:

\[
\text{Total cars walked past} = 150 \text{ cars (Section G)} + 180 \text{ cars (Section H)} = 330 \text{ cars}
\]

**Step 4: Calculate the time Nate spent walking past these cars.**

Nate walks past 11 cars per minute. To find out how many minutes it took him to walk past 330 cars, we divide the total number of cars by the number of cars he walks past per minute:

\[
\text{Time spent walking} = \frac{330 \text{ cars}}{11 \text{ cars per minute}} = 30 \text{ minutes}
\]

Therefore, Nate spent 30 minutes searching the parking lot.

**Final Answer:**

Nate spent 30 minutes searching the parking lot.
