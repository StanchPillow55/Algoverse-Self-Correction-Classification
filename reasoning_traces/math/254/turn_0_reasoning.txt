==================================================

To determine how many minutes Nate spent searching for his car in the airport parking lot, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of cars in Section G:**
   - Section G has 15 rows, and each row holds 10 cars.
   - The total number of cars in Section G can be calculated as follows:
     \[
     \text{Total cars in Section G} = \text{Number of rows} \times \text{Cars per row} = 15 \times 10 = 150 \text{ cars}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total number of cars in Section H:**
   - Section H has 20 rows, and each row holds 9 cars.
   - The total number of cars in Section H can be calculated as follows:
     \[
     \text{Total cars in Section H} = \text{Number of rows} \times \text{Cars per row} = 20 \times 9 = 180 \text{ cars}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total number of cars in both sections:**
   - Now, we add the total number of cars from Section G and Section H:
     \[
     \text{Total cars in both sections} = \text{Total cars in Section G} + \text{Total cars in Section H} = 150 + 180 = 330 \text{ cars}
     \]

4. **Calculate the time spent searching:**
   - Nate can walk past 11 cars per minute. To find out how many minutes he spent searching, we divide the total number of cars by the rate at which he walks:
     \[
     \text{Time spent (in minutes)} = \frac{\text{Total cars}}{\text{Cars per minute}} = \frac{330}{11}
     \]
   - Performing the division:
     \[
     \frac{330}{11} = 30 \text{ minutes}
     \]

Thus, Nate spent **30 minutes** searching the parking lot.

Final answer: **30 minutes**.
