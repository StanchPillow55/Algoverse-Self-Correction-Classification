==================================================

It seems like there might be some confusion with the problem statement "Sample math problem 135." This doesn't provide enough information to determine what the math problem is. However, I can guide you through a generic approach to solving a math problem, assuming it involves basic arithmetic or algebra. If you have a specific problem in mind, please provide the details. For now, let's assume a hypothetical problem:

**Hypothetical Problem:**
Solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 2x + 3 = 15 \).

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   We need to solve for \( x \) in the linear equation \( 2x + 3 = 15 \).

2. **Isolate the Variable:**
   To solve for \( x \), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We start by eliminating the constant term on the left side.

   \[
   2x + 3 = 15
   \]

   Subtract 3 from both sides to get:

   \[
   2x + 3 - 3 = 15 - 3
   \]

   Simplifying both sides gives:

   \[
   2x = 12
   \]

3. **Solve for \( x \):**
   Now, divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( x \).

   \[
   \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{12}{2}
   \]

   Simplifying gives:

   \[
   x = 6
   \]

4. **Verify the Solution:**
   Substitute \( x = 6 \) back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies the equation.

   \[
   2(6) + 3 = 15
   \]

   Simplifying the left side:

   \[
   12 + 3 = 15
   \]

   Since both sides of the equation are equal, our solution is verified.

**Final Answer:**
The solution to the equation \( 2x + 3 = 15 \) is \( x = 6 \).
