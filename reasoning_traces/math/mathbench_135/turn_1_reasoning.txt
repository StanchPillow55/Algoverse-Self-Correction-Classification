==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 135," we need to first understand what the problem is asking. However, the problem statement is not clear from the given text. It seems like "Sample math problem 135" is a placeholder or reference to a specific problem, but without additional context or details, it's impossible to determine what the problem entails.

To proceed, let's assume that "Sample math problem 135" refers to a generic math problem. I'll create a hypothetical problem and solve it step by step. If you have a specific problem in mind, please provide more details.

### Hypothetical Problem:
Let's assume "Sample math problem 135" is the following:

**Problem:** Solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Understand the Equation:**
   The equation given is \( 2x + 3 = 11 \). We need to solve for \( x \).

2. **Isolate the Variable:**
   To solve for \( x \), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We can do this by performing inverse operations.

3. **Subtract 3 from Both Sides:**
   \[
   2x + 3 - 3 = 11 - 3
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   2x = 8
   \]

4. **Divide Both Sides by 2:**
   \[
   \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{8}{2}
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   x = 4
   \]

5. **Verify the Solution:**
   Substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation to verify:
   \[
   2(4) + 3 = 11
   \]
   Simplifying the left side gives:
   \[
   8 + 3 = 11
   \]
   \[
   11 = 11
   \]
   Since both sides of the equation are equal, our solution is verified.

### Final Answer:
The solution to the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \) is \( x = 4 \).

If this hypothetical problem does not match what you intended with "Sample math problem 135," please provide more details or clarify the problem statement, and I will be happy to assist further.
