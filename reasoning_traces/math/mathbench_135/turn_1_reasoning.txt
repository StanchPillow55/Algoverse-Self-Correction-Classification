==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 135," we need to first understand what the problem is asking. However, the problem statement "Sample math problem 135" is not specific enough to determine what the actual mathematical question is. It seems like a placeholder or reference to a specific problem that is not provided here.

To proceed, let's assume this is a hypothetical math problem and create a sample problem based on the number 135. We will then solve this problem step by step.

### Sample Problem:
Let's assume the problem is: "Find the prime factorization of the number 135."

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Identify the smallest prime number that divides 135:**
   - Start with the smallest prime number, which is 2. Since 135 is odd, it is not divisible by 2.
   - Next, try 3. To check divisibility by 3, sum the digits of 135: \(1 + 3 + 5 = 9\). Since 9 is divisible by 3, 135 is also divisible by 3.

2. **Divide 135 by 3:**
   \[
   135 \div 3 = 45
   \]

3. **Repeat the process for 45:**
   - Check divisibility by 3 again. Sum the digits of 45: \(4 + 5 = 9\). Since 9 is divisible by 3, 45 is divisible by 3.
   - Divide 45 by 3:
   \[
   45 \div 3 = 15
   \]

4. **Repeat the process for 15:**
   - Check divisibility by 3. Sum the digits of 15: \(1 + 5 = 6\). Since 6 is divisible by 3, 15 is divisible by 3.
   - Divide 15 by 3:
   \[
   15 \div 3 = 5
   \]

5. **Factor 5:**
   - 5 is a prime number, so it cannot be divided further by any prime number other than itself.

6. **Compile the prime factors:**
   - From the divisions above, we have divided 135 by 3 three times and ended with 5. Therefore, the prime factorization of 135 is:
   \[
   135 = 3 \times 3 \times 3 \times 5 = 3^3 \times 5
   \]

### Final Answer:
The prime factorization of 135 is \(3^3 \times 5\).
