Question ID: mathbench_135
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 135," we first need to understand what the problem is asking. However, the problem statement is incomplete as it only mentions "Sample math problem 135" without providing any specific details or context. Therefore, I will assume that "135" is a number related to the problem, and I will explore various mathematical operations and properties related to the number 135.

### Step 1: Prime Factorization
First, let's find the prime factorization of 135.

1. 135 is an odd number, so it is not divisible by 2.
2. Check divisibility by 3: The sum of the digits of 135 is \(1 + 3 + 5 = 9\), which is divisible by 3. Therefore, 135 is divisible by 3.
   \[
   135 \div 3 = 45
   \]
3. Now, factor 45. The sum of the digits of 45 is \(4 + 5 = 9\), which is also divisible by 3.
   \[
   45 \div 3 = 15
   \]
4. Factor 15. The sum of the digits of 15 is \(1 + 5 = 6\), which is divisible by 3.
   \[
   15 \div 3 = 5
   \]
5. 5 is a prime number.

Thus, the prime factorization of 135 is:
\[
135 = 3^3 \times 5
\]

### Step 2: Divisors of 135
Using the prime factorization, we can find all divisors of 135. The divisors are obtained by taking all combinations of the prime factors raised to their respective powers.

- \(3^0 \times 5^0 = 1\)
- \(3^1 \times 5^0 = 3\)
- \(3^2 \times 5^0 = 9\)
- \(3^3 \times 5^0 = 27\)
- \(3^0 \times 5^1 = 5\)
- \(3^1 \times 5^1 = 15\)
- \(3^2 \times 5^1 = 45\)
- \(3^3 \times 5^1 = 135\)

Thus, the divisors of 135 are: 1, 3, 5, 9, 15, 27, 45, and 135.

### Step 3: Properties of 135
- **Sum of Divisors**: The sum of all divisors of 135 is:
  \[
  1 + 3 + 5 + 9 + 15 + 27 + 45 + 135 = 240
  \]

- **Number of Divisors**: The total number of divisors can be calculated using the formula for the number of divisors from the prime factorization:
  \[
  (3+1)(1+1) = 4 \times 2 = 8
  \]
  This matches the list of divisors we found.

- **Perfect Square**: 135 is not a perfect square because there is no integer \( n \) such that \( n^2 = 135 \).

- **Perfect Cube**: 135 is not a perfect cube because there is no integer \( n \) such that \( n^3 = 135 \).

### Step 4: Conclusion
Since the problem statement "Sample math problem 135" does not specify a particular question or operation, we have explored various mathematical properties and operations related to the number 135. If there is a specific question or context you have in mind, please provide more details so that I can address it directly.

Final Answer:
- Prime Factorization: \(135 = 3^3 \times 5\)
- Divisors: 1, 3, 5, 9, 15, 27, 45, 135
- Sum of Divisors: 240
- Number of Divisors: 8
