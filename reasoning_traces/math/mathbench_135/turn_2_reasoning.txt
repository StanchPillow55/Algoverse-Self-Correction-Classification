==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 135," we need to first understand what the problem entails. However, the problem statement is not fully provided here. Assuming "Sample math problem 135" refers to a specific math problem, let's create a hypothetical problem based on the number 135 and solve it.

**Hypothetical Problem:**
Determine if the number 135 is a prime number. If it is not, find its prime factorization.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understanding Prime Numbers:**
   A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.

2. **Check if 135 is Prime:**
   To determine if 135 is a prime number, we need to check if it has any divisors other than 1 and 135.

3. **Divisibility Tests:**
   - **Divisibility by 2:** 135 is an odd number, so it is not divisible by 2.
   - **Divisibility by 3:** A number is divisible by 3 if the sum of its digits is divisible by 3.
     - Sum of digits of 135: \(1 + 3 + 5 = 9\).
     - Since 9 is divisible by 3, 135 is divisible by 3.

4. **Divide 135 by 3:**
   \[
   135 \div 3 = 45
   \]
   So, 135 = 3 × 45.

5. **Factor 45 Further:**
   - Check if 45 is divisible by 3:
     - Sum of digits of 45: \(4 + 5 = 9\).
     - Since 9 is divisible by 3, 45 is divisible by 3.
   \[
   45 \div 3 = 15
   \]
   So, 45 = 3 × 15.

6. **Factor 15 Further:**
   - Check if 15 is divisible by 3:
     - Sum of digits of 15: \(1 + 5 = 6\).
     - Since 6 is divisible by 3, 15 is divisible by 3.
   \[
   15 \div 3 = 5
   \]
   So, 15 = 3 × 5.

7. **Prime Factorization of 135:**
   Combining all the factors, we have:
   \[
   135 = 3 \times 3 \times 3 \times 5 = 3^3 \times 5
   \]

8. **Conclusion:**
   Since 135 can be expressed as a product of prime numbers, it is not a prime number. Its prime factorization is \(3^3 \times 5\).

**Final Answer:**
135 is not a prime number. Its prime factorization is \(3^3 \times 5\).
