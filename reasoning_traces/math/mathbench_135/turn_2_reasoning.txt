==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 135," we need to first understand what the problem is asking. However, the problem statement "Sample math problem 135" is not clear or specific. It seems like a placeholder or a reference to a specific problem that is not provided here. 

In order to proceed, I will assume that "Sample math problem 135" refers to a generic math problem that involves basic arithmetic operations, as there is no context or specific question provided. Let's create a hypothetical problem and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**
Calculate the sum of 135 and 246, then subtract 89 from the result.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Identify the operations needed:**
   - First, we need to add 135 and 246.
   - Then, we subtract 89 from the sum obtained in the first step.

2. **Perform the addition:**
   - Add 135 and 246.
   - Align the numbers by their place values and add them:
     ```
       135
     + 246
     ------
       381
     ```
   - Start from the rightmost digit (units place):
     - 5 + 6 = 11. Write 1 and carry over 1 to the tens place.
     - 3 + 4 = 7. Add the carried over 1: 7 + 1 = 8. Write 8.
     - 1 + 2 = 3. Write 3.
   - The sum of 135 and 246 is 381.

3. **Perform the subtraction:**
   - Subtract 89 from 381.
   - Align the numbers by their place values and subtract:
     ```
       381
     -  89
     ------
       292
     ```
   - Start from the rightmost digit (units place):
     - 1 - 9 cannot be done directly, so we borrow 1 from the tens place, making it 11 - 9 = 2.
     - In the tens place, after borrowing, we have 7 (from 8) - 8 = -1, but since we borrowed, it becomes 2.
     - In the hundreds place, 3 remains as it is since there was no borrowing needed here.
   - The result of the subtraction is 292.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The final result after performing the operations is 292.

Therefore, the solution to the hypothetical problem is 292. If "Sample math problem 135" refers to a specific problem, please provide more details or context so I can assist you accurately.
