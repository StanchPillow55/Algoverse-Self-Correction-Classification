To determine how many movie tickets Ryan can buy, we will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate Ryan's total allowance after 3 weeks.**
   - Ryan earns $6 each week for completing his chores.
   - He did his chores for 3 weeks.
   - Total allowance = Weekly allowance × Number of weeks
   \[
   \text{Total allowance} = 6 \, \text{dollars/week} \times 3 \, \text{weeks} = 18 \, \text{dollars}
   \]

2. **Calculate the total cost of the ice cream cones.**
   - Ryan bought ice cream cones for himself and 3 friends, which means he bought a total of 4 cones (1 for himself + 3 for friends).
   - The cost of each ice cream cone is $1.25.
   - Total cost of ice cream cones = Number of cones × Cost per cone
   \[
   \text{Total cost of ice cream} = 4 \, \text{cones} \times 1.25 \, \text{dollars/cone} = 5 \, \text{dollars}
   \]

3. **Calculate Ryan's remaining money after buying the ice cream.**
   - Remaining money = Total allowance - Total cost of ice cream
   \[
   \text{Remaining money} = 18 \, \text{dollars} - 5 \, \text{dollars} = 13 \, \text{dollars}
   \]

4. **Calculate how many movie tickets Ryan can buy.**
   - The cost of each movie ticket is $6.50.
   - To find out how many tickets he can buy, we divide his remaining money by the cost of one ticket.
   \[
   \text{Number of tickets} = \frac{\text{Remaining money}}{\text{Cost per ticket}} = \frac{13 \, \text{dollars}}{6.50 \, \text{dollars/ticket}}
   \]
   - Performing the division:
   \[
   \text{Number of tickets} = 2 \, \text{tickets} \quad \text{(since } 6.50 \times 2 = 13 \text{ and } 6.50 \times 3 = 19.50 \text{ which exceeds 13)}
   \]

5. **Final answer:**
   - Ryan can buy **2 movie tickets**.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{2}
\]
