Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve "Sample math problem 163," we need to first understand what the problem entails. Since the problem is not explicitly stated, I'll assume a hypothetical math problem labeled as "Sample math problem 163" and solve it step by step. Let's assume the problem is as follows:

**Problem 163:**
Solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Understand the Equation:**
   The equation given is \( 2x + 3 = 11 \). This is a linear equation in one variable, \( x \).

2. **Isolate the Variable:**
   To solve for \( x \), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We can start by eliminating the constant term on the left side of the equation.

   \[
   2x + 3 = 11
   \]

   Subtract 3 from both sides to get:

   \[
   2x + 3 - 3 = 11 - 3
   \]

   Simplifying both sides gives:

   \[
   2x = 8
   \]

3. **Solve for \( x \):**
   Now, divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( x \).

   \[
   \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{8}{2}
   \]

   Simplifying both sides gives:

   \[
   x = 4
   \]

4. **Verify the Solution:**
   Substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies the equation.

   \[
   2(4) + 3 = 11
   \]

   Calculate the left side:

   \[
   8 + 3 = 11
   \]

   Since both sides of the equation are equal, \( x = 4 \) is indeed the correct solution.

### Final Answer:
The solution to the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \) is \( x = 4 \).
