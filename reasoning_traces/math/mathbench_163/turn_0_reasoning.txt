==================================================

To solve the problem, I need to first understand what "Sample math problem 163" refers to. Since I don't have access to external databases or specific problem sets, I'll assume this is a generic math problem. Let's create a sample problem and solve it step by step.

**Sample Math Problem 163:**

**Problem:**  
Solve for \( x \) in the equation:  
\[ 3x + 5 = 20 \]

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Equation:**
   The equation given is a linear equation in one variable, \( x \). The goal is to isolate \( x \) on one side of the equation to find its value.

2. **Isolate the Variable:**
   To isolate \( x \), we need to get rid of the constant term on the left side of the equation. The constant term here is \( 5 \).

3. **Subtract 5 from Both Sides:**
   \[
   3x + 5 - 5 = 20 - 5
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   3x = 15
   \]

4. **Solve for \( x \):**
   Now, divide both sides of the equation by the coefficient of \( x \), which is \( 3 \).
   \[
   \frac{3x}{3} = \frac{15}{3}
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   x = 5
   \]

5. **Verify the Solution:**
   Substitute \( x = 5 \) back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies the equation.
   \[
   3(5) + 5 = 20
   \]
   Simplifying the left side:
   \[
   15 + 5 = 20
   \]
   \[
   20 = 20
   \]
   Since both sides of the equation are equal, our solution \( x = 5 \) is correct.

**Final Answer:**
\[ x = 5 \]

This is the complete solution to the sample problem. If "Sample math problem 163" refers to a specific problem, please provide the details of the problem for a tailored solution.
