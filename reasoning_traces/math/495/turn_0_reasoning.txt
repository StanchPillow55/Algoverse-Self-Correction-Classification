==================================================

To determine how many items each baggie will have, we first need to calculate the total number of each type of snack that Mille is preparing. 

1. **Calculate the number of goldfish:**
   Mille has 64 pretzels, and she has four times as many goldfish. 
   \[
   \text{Number of goldfish} = 4 \times 64 = 256
   \]

2. **Calculate the number of suckers:**
   Mille has 32 suckers, which is already given.

3. **Calculate the total number of snacks:**
   Now, we will find the total number of snacks by adding the number of pretzels, goldfish, and suckers together.
   \[
   \text{Total snacks} = \text{Number of pretzels} + \text{Number of goldfish} + \text{Number of suckers}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total snacks} = 64 + 256 + 32
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total snacks} = 352
   \]

4. **Divide the total number of snacks by the number of kids:**
   There are 16 kids in the class, so we will divide the total number of snacks by 16 to find out how many items each baggie will have.
   \[
   \text{Items per baggie} = \frac{\text{Total snacks}}{\text{Number of kids}} = \frac{352}{16}
   \]

5. **Perform the division:**
   \[
   352 \div 16 = 22
   \]

Thus, each baggie will have **22 items**.

Final answer: Each baggie has 22 items.
