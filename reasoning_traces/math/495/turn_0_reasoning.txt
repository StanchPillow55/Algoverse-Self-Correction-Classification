==================================================

To determine how many minutes Charisma has walked after 5 days at the office, we can break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate the number of hours she works in a day**: 
   Charisma works for 8 hours every day.

2. **Determine how many times she gets up to walk in one day**: 
   Since she walks for 5 minutes every hour, we need to find out how many hours she works in a day. She works for 8 hours, so she will get up to walk 8 times in one day (once every hour).

3. **Calculate the total walking time in one day**: 
   Each time she walks, she walks for 5 minutes. Therefore, the total walking time in one day can be calculated as follows:
   \[
   \text{Total walking time in one day} = \text{Number of walks} \times \text{Time per walk}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total walking time in one day} = 8 \text{ walks} \times 5 \text{ minutes/walk} = 40 \text{ minutes}
   \]

4. **Calculate the total walking time over 5 days**: 
   Now that we know how many minutes she walks in one day, we can find out how many minutes she walks in 5 days:
   \[
   \text{Total walking time in 5 days} = \text{Total walking time in one day} \times \text{Number of days}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total walking time in 5 days} = 40 \text{ minutes/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 200 \text{ minutes}
   \]

5. **Final answer**: 
   After 5 days at the office, Charisma has walked a total of 200 minutes.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{200 \text{ minutes}}
\]
