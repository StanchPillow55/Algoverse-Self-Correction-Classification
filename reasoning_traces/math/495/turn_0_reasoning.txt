Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine how many total items Mille is dividing among the 16 kids and then find out how many items each baggie will contain.

### Step 1: Determine the number of each type of item

1. **Pretzels**: Mille has 64 pretzels.
2. **Goldfish**: Mille has four times as many goldfish as pretzels. 
   \[
   \text{Number of goldfish} = 4 \times 64 = 256
   \]
3. **Suckers**: Mille has 32 suckers.

### Step 2: Calculate the total number of items

Add up all the items:
\[
\text{Total items} = \text{Pretzels} + \text{Goldfish} + \text{Suckers} = 64 + 256 + 32
\]

Calculate the sum:
\[
64 + 256 = 320
\]
\[
320 + 32 = 352
\]

So, there are a total of 352 items.

### Step 3: Divide the total number of items by the number of kids

Mille is dividing these items among 16 kids. To find out how many items each baggie will have, divide the total number of items by the number of kids:
\[
\text{Items per baggie} = \frac{352}{16}
\]

Perform the division:
\[
352 \div 16 = 22
\]

### Conclusion

Each baggie will contain 22 items.

Therefore, the final answer is that each baggie has **22 items**.
