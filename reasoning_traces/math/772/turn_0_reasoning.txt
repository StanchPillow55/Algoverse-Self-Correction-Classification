==================================================

To determine the percentage of her weekend that Tatiana spends playing soccer, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total time available over the weekend**:
   - Saturday: 7 hours
   - Sunday: 5 hours
   - Total weekend time = 7 hours + 5 hours = 12 hours

2. **Determine the time spent reading**:
   - Tatiana reads for 3 hours.

3. **Calculate the remaining time after reading**:
   - Remaining time = Total weekend time - Time spent reading
   - Remaining time = 12 hours - 3 hours = 9 hours

4. **Determine the time spent playing video games**:
   - Tatiana plays video games for 1/3 of the remaining time.
   - Time spent on video games = (1/3) * Remaining time
   - Time spent on video games = (1/3) * 9 hours = 3 hours

5. **Calculate the time spent playing soccer**:
   - To find the time spent playing soccer, we subtract the time spent reading and playing video games from the total weekend time.
   - Time spent on soccer = Total weekend time - (Time spent reading + Time spent on video games)
   - Time spent on soccer = 12 hours - (3 hours + 3 hours)
   - Time spent on soccer = 12 hours - 6 hours = 6 hours

6. **Calculate the percentage of the weekend spent playing soccer**:
   - Percentage of time spent on soccer = (Time spent on soccer / Total weekend time) * 100%
   - Percentage of time spent on soccer = (6 hours / 12 hours) * 100%
   - Percentage of time spent on soccer = 0.5 * 100% = 50%

Thus, Tatiana spends **50%** of her weekend playing soccer.

Final answer: **50%**
