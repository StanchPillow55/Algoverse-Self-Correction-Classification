==================================================

To determine the cost of the package with 8 sandwiches, we first need to analyze the prices of the other packages and establish the proportionality of the prices based on the number of sandwiches.

1. **Identify the prices and quantities of the known packages**:
   - Package 1: 2 sandwiches for $3
   - Package 2: 4 sandwiches for $6

2. **Calculate the price per sandwich for each package**:
   - For Package 1:
     \[
     \text{Price per sandwich} = \frac{\text{Total price}}{\text{Number of sandwiches}} = \frac{3}{2} = 1.5 \text{ dollars per sandwich}
     \]
   - For Package 2:
     \[
     \text{Price per sandwich} = \frac{6}{4} = 1.5 \text{ dollars per sandwich}
     \]

   Both packages have the same price per sandwich, which confirms that the prices are proportional.

3. **Determine the price for the package with 8 sandwiches**:
   - Since the price per sandwich is consistent at $1.5, we can calculate the total cost for 8 sandwiches:
   \[
   \text{Total cost for 8 sandwiches} = \text{Price per sandwich} \times \text{Number of sandwiches} = 1.5 \times 8
   \]

4. **Perform the multiplication**:
   \[
   1.5 \times 8 = 12
   \]

Thus, the cost of the package with 8 sandwiches is $12.

5. **Final answer**:
The package with 8 sandwiches will cost **$12**.
