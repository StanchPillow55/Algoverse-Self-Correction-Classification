==================================================

To solve the problem, we first need to understand what "Sample reasoning question 118" refers to. However, since the problem statement is not provided, I'll demonstrate a general approach to solving a reasoning-based math problem. 

Let's assume "Sample reasoning question 118" is a typical math word problem. Here's a step-by-step approach to solving such problems:

### Step 1: Understand the Problem
- **Read the problem carefully**: Identify what is being asked. Look for keywords that indicate mathematical operations (e.g., sum, difference, product, quotient).
- **Identify the given information**: Note down all the numbers, variables, and conditions provided in the problem.

### Step 2: Plan a Solution
- **Choose a strategy**: Depending on the problem, decide whether to use algebra, arithmetic, geometry, or another mathematical approach.
- **Set up equations**: If applicable, translate the word problem into mathematical equations.

### Step 3: Execute the Plan
- **Perform calculations**: Carefully carry out the necessary calculations. Show all steps to ensure clarity.
- **Solve equations**: If you set up equations, solve them step by step.

### Step 4: Check Your Work
- **Verify calculations**: Double-check your arithmetic and algebraic manipulations.
- **Ensure the solution makes sense**: Consider whether your answer is reasonable given the context of the problem.

### Step 5: State the Final Answer
- **Clearly write the answer**: Make sure to answer the question that was asked, including appropriate units if necessary.

Since I don't have the specific details of "Sample reasoning question 118," I can't provide a precise solution. However, if you provide the actual problem statement, I'd be happy to work through it using the steps outlined above.
