==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 118" refers to. Since the question is not explicitly provided, I'll create a hypothetical math problem and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**

A company produces two types of products, A and B. The profit from each unit of product A is $30, and the profit from each unit of product B is $50. The company can produce a maximum of 100 units of product A and 80 units of product B per week. However, due to resource constraints, the total production of both products cannot exceed 150 units per week. How many units of each product should the company produce to maximize profit?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( x \) be the number of units of product A produced.
   - Let \( y \) be the number of units of product B produced.

2. **Objective Function:**
   - The profit function \( P \) can be defined as:
     \[
     P = 30x + 50y
     \]
   - We want to maximize \( P \).

3. **Constraints:**
   - The production constraints are:
     \[
     x \leq 100 \quad \text{(cannot produce more than 100 units of A)}
     \]
     \[
     y \leq 80 \quad \text{(cannot produce more than 80 units of B)}
     \]
     \[
     x + y \leq 150 \quad \text{(total production constraint)}
     \]
   - Additionally, \( x \geq 0 \) and \( y \geq 0 \) since negative production is not possible.

4. **Graphical Solution:**
   - Plot the constraints on a graph with \( x \) on the horizontal axis and \( y \) on the vertical axis.
   - The feasible region is bounded by the lines \( x = 100 \), \( y = 80 \), and \( x + y = 150 \).

5. **Identify Corner Points:**
   - The corner points of the feasible region are where the lines intersect:
     - \( (0, 0) \)
     - \( (100, 0) \)
     - \( (70, 80) \) from solving \( x + y = 150 \) and \( y = 80 \)
     - \( (100, 50) \) from solving \( x = 100 \) and \( x + y = 150 \)

6. **Evaluate the Objective Function at Each Corner Point:**
   - \( P(0, 0) = 30(0) + 50(0) = 0 \)
   - \( P(100, 0) = 30(100) + 50(0) = 3000 \)
   - \( P(70, 80) = 30(70) + 50(80) = 2100 + 4000 = 6100 \)
   - \( P(100, 50) = 30(100) + 50(50) = 3000 + 2500 = 5500 \)

7. **Determine the Maximum Profit:**
   - The maximum profit occurs at the point \( (70, 80) \) with a profit of $6100.

**Final Answer:**
The company should produce 70 units of product A and 80 units of product B to achieve the maximum profit of $6100.
