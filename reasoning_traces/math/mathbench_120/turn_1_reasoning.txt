==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 120," we need to first understand what the problem is asking. However, the problem statement is incomplete as it only says "Sample math problem 120." Without additional context or specific details about the problem, it's challenging to provide a precise solution. 

Let's assume that "Sample math problem 120" refers to a generic math problem involving the number 120. One common type of problem involving a number like 120 is to find its factors, prime factorization, or solve an equation involving 120. I'll explore these possibilities:

### 1. Prime Factorization of 120

To find the prime factorization of 120, we need to break it down into its prime factors.

1. Start with the smallest prime number, which is 2. Check if 120 is divisible by 2:
   \[
   120 \div 2 = 60
   \]
   So, 2 is a factor, and we continue with 60.

2. Check if 60 is divisible by 2:
   \[
   60 \div 2 = 30
   \]
   Again, 2 is a factor, and we continue with 30.

3. Check if 30 is divisible by 2:
   \[
   30 \div 2 = 15
   \]
   Again, 2 is a factor, and we continue with 15.

4. Now, check if 15 is divisible by 2. It is not, so we move to the next prime number, which is 3. Check if 15 is divisible by 3:
   \[
   15 \div 3 = 5
   \]
   So, 3 is a factor, and we continue with 5.

5. Finally, 5 is a prime number, so it is a factor.

Thus, the prime factorization of 120 is:
\[
120 = 2^3 \times 3 \times 5
\]

### 2. Factors of 120

To find all factors of 120, we can use its prime factorization:
\[
120 = 2^3 \times 3 \times 5
\]

The factors are obtained by taking all combinations of these prime factors raised to their respective powers. The factors of 120 are:
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 15, 20, 24, 30, 40, 60, and 120.

### 3. Solving an Equation Involving 120

If the problem involves solving an equation like \( x + 120 = 0 \), we can solve for \( x \):

\[
x + 120 = 0 \\
x = -120
\]

### Conclusion

Without a specific problem statement, I have explored several possibilities involving the number 120. If you have a specific problem or context in mind, please provide more details for a more targeted solution. 

For now, the prime factorization of 120 is:
\[
120 = 2^3 \times 3 \times 5
\]

And the factors of 120 are:
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 15, 20, 24, 30, 40, 60, and 120.
