==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 120," we need to first understand what the problem is asking. However, the problem statement "Sample math problem 120" is not specific enough to determine the exact nature of the problem. It seems like a placeholder or a reference to a specific problem that might be detailed elsewhere.

Since there is no specific mathematical question or context provided, I'll demonstrate how to solve a generic math problem involving the number 120. Let's consider a problem involving the number 120 and work through it step by step.

### Problem:
Find the prime factorization of 120 and determine the number of divisors it has.

### Step 1: Prime Factorization
To find the prime factorization of 120, we start by dividing it by the smallest prime number, which is 2, and continue dividing by prime numbers until we reach 1.

1. \( 120 \div 2 = 60 \)
2. \( 60 \div 2 = 30 \)
3. \( 30 \div 2 = 15 \)

At this point, 15 is not divisible by 2, so we move to the next smallest prime number, which is 3.

4. \( 15 \div 3 = 5 \)

Finally, 5 is a prime number itself.

Thus, the prime factorization of 120 is:
\[ 120 = 2^3 \times 3^1 \times 5^1 \]

### Step 2: Determine the Number of Divisors
To find the number of divisors of a number given its prime factorization, use the formula:
\[ (e_1 + 1)(e_2 + 1)(e_3 + 1) \ldots (e_n + 1) \]
where \( e_1, e_2, \ldots, e_n \) are the exponents in the prime factorization.

For 120, the prime factorization is \( 2^3 \times 3^1 \times 5^1 \). Therefore, the number of divisors is:
\[ (3 + 1)(1 + 1)(1 + 1) = 4 \times 2 \times 2 = 16 \]

### Conclusion
The prime factorization of 120 is \( 2^3 \times 3^1 \times 5^1 \), and it has 16 divisors.

**Final Answer:**
The prime factorization of 120 is \( 2^3 \times 3^1 \times 5^1 \), and it has 16 divisors.
