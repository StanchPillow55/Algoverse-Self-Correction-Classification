==================================================

Certainly! Let's work through the problem step by step. However, it seems like the problem statement is incomplete or unclear. "Sample math problem 120" doesn't specify what the problem is. To proceed, I'll assume a hypothetical problem related to the number 120. Let's say the problem is:

**Problem:** Find the prime factorization of 120 and determine the number of divisors it has.

### Step 1: Prime Factorization of 120

To find the prime factorization of 120, we start by dividing it by the smallest prime number, which is 2, and continue dividing by prime numbers until we reach 1.

1. **Divide by 2:**
   \[
   120 \div 2 = 60
   \]
   So, 120 = 2 × 60.

2. **Divide 60 by 2:**
   \[
   60 \div 2 = 30
   \]
   So, 60 = 2 × 30, and thus 120 = 2 × 2 × 30.

3. **Divide 30 by 2:**
   \[
   30 \div 2 = 15
   \]
   So, 30 = 2 × 15, and thus 120 = 2 × 2 × 2 × 15.

4. **Divide 15 by 3 (next smallest prime):**
   \[
   15 \div 3 = 5
   \]
   So, 15 = 3 × 5, and thus 120 = 2 × 2 × 2 × 3 × 5.

Now, we have reached a prime number (5), and the division process stops here.

The prime factorization of 120 is:
\[
120 = 2^3 \times 3^1 \times 5^1
\]

### Step 2: Determine the Number of Divisors

To find the number of divisors of a number given its prime factorization, we use the formula:
\[
(n_1 + 1)(n_2 + 1)(n_3 + 1) \ldots
\]
where \( n_1, n_2, n_3, \ldots \) are the exponents in the prime factorization.

For 120 = \( 2^3 \times 3^1 \times 5^1 \), the exponents are 3, 1, and 1.

The number of divisors is:
\[
(3 + 1)(1 + 1)(1 + 1) = 4 \times 2 \times 2 = 16
\]

### Final Answer

The prime factorization of 120 is \( 2^3 \times 3^1 \times 5^1 \), and it has 16 divisors.
