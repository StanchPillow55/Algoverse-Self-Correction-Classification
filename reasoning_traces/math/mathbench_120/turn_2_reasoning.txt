==================================================

To solve the sample math problem "120," we need to first understand what the problem is asking. Since "120" is just a number, let's assume the problem involves performing operations or finding properties related to this number. Here are a few possible interpretations and solutions:

### Interpretation 1: Factorization
Let's factor the number 120 into its prime components.

1. **Divide by the smallest prime number, 2:**
   \[
   120 \div 2 = 60
   \]
   So, 120 = 2 × 60.

2. **Continue factoring 60:**
   \[
   60 \div 2 = 30
   \]
   So, 60 = 2 × 30, and thus 120 = 2 × 2 × 30.

3. **Continue factoring 30:**
   \[
   30 \div 2 = 15
   \]
   So, 30 = 2 × 15, and thus 120 = 2 × 2 × 2 × 15.

4. **Factor 15:**
   \[
   15 \div 3 = 5
   \]
   So, 15 = 3 × 5, and thus 120 = 2 × 2 × 2 × 3 × 5.

The prime factorization of 120 is:
\[
2^3 \times 3 \times 5
\]

### Interpretation 2: Divisors
Let's find the number of divisors of 120 using its prime factorization.

The prime factorization of 120 is \(2^3 \times 3^1 \times 5^1\).

To find the number of divisors, use the formula:
\[
(n_1 + 1)(n_2 + 1)(n_3 + 1) \ldots
\]
where \(n_1, n_2, n_3, \ldots\) are the exponents in the prime factorization.

For 120, the exponents are 3, 1, and 1. Therefore, the number of divisors is:
\[
(3 + 1)(1 + 1)(1 + 1) = 4 \times 2 \times 2 = 16
\]

### Interpretation 3: Sum of Divisors
Let's calculate the sum of all divisors of 120.

Using the formula for the sum of divisors based on prime factorization:
\[
\sigma(n) = (1 + p_1 + p_1^2 + \ldots + p_1^{k_1})(1 + p_2 + \ldots + p_2^{k_2}) \ldots
\]

For 120, with \(2^3 \times 3^1 \times 5^1\):
\[
\sigma(120) = (1 + 2 + 4 + 8)(1 + 3)(1 + 5)
\]

Calculate each term:
- \(1 + 2 + 4 + 8 = 15\)
- \(1 + 3 = 4\)
- \(1 + 5 = 6\)

Now multiply these results:
\[
15 \times 4 \times 6 = 360
\]

### Final Answer
Depending on the interpretation, the solutions are:
1. **Prime Factorization:** \(2^3 \times 3 \times 5\)
2. **Number of Divisors:** 16
3. **Sum of Divisors:** 360

These interpretations provide a comprehensive understanding of the number 120 in different mathematical contexts.
