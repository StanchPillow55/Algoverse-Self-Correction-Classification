==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 120," we need to first understand what the problem is asking. However, the problem statement provided is incomplete, as "Sample math problem 120" does not specify any details or context. Therefore, I will assume that "Sample math problem 120" is a placeholder for a typical math problem, and I will create a sample problem to solve.

Let's assume the problem is as follows:

**Problem:** Calculate the sum of all even numbers from 1 to 120.

**Step-by-step Solution:**

1. **Identify the even numbers between 1 and 120:**
   - Even numbers are integers that are divisible by 2.
   - The sequence of even numbers from 1 to 120 is: 2, 4, 6, ..., 120.

2. **Determine the number of even numbers in this sequence:**
   - The sequence of even numbers can be represented as: 2, 4, 6, ..., 120.
   - This is an arithmetic sequence where the first term \(a_1 = 2\) and the common difference \(d = 2\).
   - The last term \(a_n = 120\).
   - The formula for the \(n\)-th term of an arithmetic sequence is given by:
     \[
     a_n = a_1 + (n-1) \cdot d
     \]
   - Plugging in the known values:
     \[
     120 = 2 + (n-1) \cdot 2
     \]
     \[
     120 = 2 + 2n - 2
     \]
     \[
     120 = 2n
     \]
     \[
     n = \frac{120}{2} = 60
     \]
   - There are 60 even numbers from 1 to 120.

3. **Calculate the sum of the even numbers:**
   - The sum \(S_n\) of the first \(n\) terms of an arithmetic sequence is given by:
     \[
     S_n = \frac{n}{2} \cdot (a_1 + a_n)
     \]
   - Substituting the known values:
     \[
     S_{60} = \frac{60}{2} \cdot (2 + 120)
     \]
     \[
     S_{60} = 30 \cdot 122
     \]
     \[
     S_{60} = 3660
     \]

**Final Answer:**

The sum of all even numbers from 1 to 120 is 3660.
