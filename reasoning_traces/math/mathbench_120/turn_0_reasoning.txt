==================================================

To solve the problem, we first need to understand what "Sample math problem 120" refers to. Since the problem itself isn't specified, I'll assume it's a generic math problem involving the number 120. Let's create a problem involving 120 and solve it.

**Problem:**
Find the prime factorization of 120, and then determine the number of divisors of 120.

**Step 1: Prime Factorization of 120**

To find the prime factorization, we start by dividing 120 by the smallest prime number, which is 2, and continue the process with the quotient until we reach 1.

1. \( 120 \div 2 = 60 \)
2. \( 60 \div 2 = 30 \)
3. \( 30 \div 2 = 15 \)

At this point, 15 is not divisible by 2, so we move to the next smallest prime number, which is 3.

4. \( 15 \div 3 = 5 \)

Finally, 5 is a prime number itself, so we stop here.

The prime factorization of 120 is:
\[ 120 = 2^3 \times 3^1 \times 5^1 \]

**Step 2: Determine the Number of Divisors**

To find the number of divisors of a number given its prime factorization, we use the formula:

If the prime factorization of a number \( n \) is \( p_1^{a_1} \times p_2^{a_2} \times \ldots \times p_k^{a_k} \), then the number of divisors \( D(n) \) is given by:
\[ D(n) = (a_1 + 1)(a_2 + 1) \ldots (a_k + 1) \]

For 120, the prime factorization is \( 2^3 \times 3^1 \times 5^1 \). Therefore, the number of divisors is:
\[ D(120) = (3 + 1)(1 + 1)(1 + 1) \]
\[ D(120) = 4 \times 2 \times 2 \]
\[ D(120) = 16 \]

**Final Answer:**

The prime factorization of 120 is \( 2^3 \times 3^1 \times 5^1 \), and the number of divisors of 120 is 16.
