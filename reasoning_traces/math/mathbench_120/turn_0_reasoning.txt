==================================================

To solve the problem, we first need to understand what "Sample math problem 120" refers to. Since there is no specific problem statement provided, I'll assume this is a placeholder for a generic math problem. Let's create a sample problem involving the number 120 and solve it step by step.

**Sample Problem:**
Find the prime factorization of 120 and determine the number of divisors it has.

**Step 1: Prime Factorization of 120**

To find the prime factorization of 120, we start by dividing it by the smallest prime number, which is 2, and continue the process with the quotient until we reach 1.

1. \( 120 \div 2 = 60 \)
2. \( 60 \div 2 = 30 \)
3. \( 30 \div 2 = 15 \)

At this point, 15 is not divisible by 2, so we move to the next smallest prime number, which is 3.

4. \( 15 \div 3 = 5 \)

Finally, 5 is a prime number, so we stop here.

Thus, the prime factorization of 120 is:
\[ 120 = 2^3 \times 3^1 \times 5^1 \]

**Step 2: Determine the Number of Divisors**

To find the number of divisors of a number given its prime factorization, use the formula:

If the prime factorization of a number \( n \) is \( p_1^{a_1} \times p_2^{a_2} \times \ldots \times p_k^{a_k} \), then the number of divisors \( D(n) \) is given by:
\[ D(n) = (a_1 + 1)(a_2 + 1) \ldots (a_k + 1) \]

For 120, the prime factorization is \( 2^3 \times 3^1 \times 5^1 \).

Applying the formula:
\[ D(120) = (3 + 1)(1 + 1)(1 + 1) \]
\[ D(120) = 4 \times 2 \times 2 \]
\[ D(120) = 16 \]

**Final Answer:**

The prime factorization of 120 is \( 2^3 \times 3^1 \times 5^1 \), and it has 16 divisors.
