==================================================

To solve the problem, I need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 337" refers to. However, since no specific details or context are provided about this question, I will need to make some assumptions or create a hypothetical problem to demonstrate the process of solving a math problem step by step.

Let's assume "Sample reasoning question 337" is a math problem involving algebra, such as solving a linear equation. Here's an example problem:

**Problem:** Solve the equation \(3x + 5 = 20\).

**Step-by-step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Equation:**
   The equation given is \(3x + 5 = 20\). This is a linear equation in one variable, \(x\).

2. **Isolate the Variable:**
   To solve for \(x\), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We can do this by performing operations that will simplify the equation.

3. **Subtract 5 from Both Sides:**
   To eliminate the constant term on the left side, subtract 5 from both sides of the equation:
   \[
   3x + 5 - 5 = 20 - 5
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   3x = 15
   \]

4. **Divide by 3:**
   To solve for \(x\), divide both sides of the equation by 3:
   \[
   \frac{3x}{3} = \frac{15}{3}
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   x = 5
   \]

5. **Verify the Solution:**
   Substitute \(x = 5\) back into the original equation to verify the solution:
   \[
   3(5) + 5 = 20
   \]
   Simplifying the left side gives:
   \[
   15 + 5 = 20
   \]
   \[
   20 = 20
   \]
   Since both sides of the equation are equal, the solution \(x = 5\) is correct.

**Final Answer:**
The solution to the equation \(3x + 5 = 20\) is \(x = 5\).

This example demonstrates the process of solving a simple linear equation step by step, including understanding the problem, isolating the variable, performing arithmetic operations, and verifying the solution. If "Sample reasoning question 337" refers to a different type of problem, please provide more details or context for a specific solution.
