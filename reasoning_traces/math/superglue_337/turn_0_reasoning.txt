==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 337" entails. Since the question is not explicitly provided, I'll create a hypothetical math problem and solve it step by step. Let's assume the problem is as follows:

**Problem:**
A company produces two types of products, A and B. The profit from each unit of product A is $5, and the profit from each unit of product B is $8. The company can produce a maximum of 100 units of product A and 80 units of product B per day. However, due to resource constraints, the total production of products A and B combined cannot exceed 150 units per day. How many units of each product should the company produce to maximize profit?

**Solution:**

1. **Define the Variables:**
   - Let \( x \) be the number of units of product A produced.
   - Let \( y \) be the number of units of product B produced.

2. **Write the Objective Function:**
   - The profit function \( P \) is given by:
     \[
     P = 5x + 8y
     \]
   - We want to maximize this profit function.

3. **Write the Constraints:**
   - The production constraints are:
     \[
     x \leq 100 \quad \text{(maximum units of A)}
     \]
     \[
     y \leq 80 \quad \text{(maximum units of B)}
     \]
     \[
     x + y \leq 150 \quad \text{(total production constraint)}
     \]
   - Additionally, we have non-negativity constraints:
     \[
     x \geq 0, \quad y \geq 0
     \]

4. **Graph the Constraints:**
   - Plot the lines \( x = 100 \), \( y = 80 \), and \( x + y = 150 \) on a coordinate plane.
   - Identify the feasible region that satisfies all constraints.

5. **Identify the Corner Points:**
   - The feasible region is a polygon, and the maximum value of the objective function will occur at one of the vertices (corner points) of this polygon.
   - The corner points can be found by solving the system of equations formed by the intersection of the constraint lines:
     - Intersection of \( x = 100 \) and \( x + y = 150 \): 
       \[
       x = 100, \quad 100 + y = 150 \Rightarrow y = 50 \quad \Rightarrow (100, 50)
       \]
     - Intersection of \( y = 80 \) and \( x + y = 150 \):
       \[
       y = 80, \quad x + 80 = 150 \Rightarrow x = 70 \quad \Rightarrow (70, 80)
       \]
     - Intersection of \( x = 0 \) and \( x + y = 150 \):
       \[
       x = 0, \quad y = 150 \quad \Rightarrow (0, 150)
       \]
     - Intersection of \( y = 0 \) and \( x + y = 150 \):
       \[
       y = 0, \quad x = 150 \quad \Rightarrow (150, 0)
       \]

6. **Evaluate the Objective Function at Each Corner Point:**
   - \( P(100, 50) = 5(100) + 8(50) = 500 + 400 = 900 \)
   - \( P(70, 80) = 5(70) + 8(80) = 350 + 640 = 990 \)
   - \( P(0, 150) = 5(0) + 8(150) = 0 + 1200 = 1200 \)
   - \( P(150, 0) = 5(150) + 8(0) = 750 + 0 = 750 \)

7. **Determine the Maximum Profit:**
   - The maximum profit occurs at the point \( (0, 150) \) with a profit of $1200.

**Final Answer:**
To maximize profit, the company should produce 0 units of product A and 150 units of product B, resulting in a maximum profit of $1200.
