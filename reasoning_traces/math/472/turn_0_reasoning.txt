==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to set up an equation based on the information given.

1. **Understanding the problem**: 
   - Let \( c \) be the number of carrot sticks Matt eats.
   - According to the problem, Matt can have half as many cookies as the number of carrot sticks he eats, plus two extra cookies for cleaning his room.
   - The total number of cookies Matt wants to eat is 5.

2. **Setting up the equation**:
   - The number of cookies Matt can have based on the carrot sticks is given by the expression:
     \[
     \frac{c}{2} + 2
     \]
   - We know that this expression equals the total number of cookies Matt wants, which is 5. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
     \[
     \frac{c}{2} + 2 = 5
     \]

3. **Solving the equation**:
   - First, we will isolate the term involving \( c \). We can do this by subtracting 2 from both sides of the equation:
     \[
     \frac{c}{2} = 5 - 2
     \]
     \[
     \frac{c}{2} = 3
     \]
   - Next, to eliminate the fraction, we multiply both sides of the equation by 2:
     \[
     c = 3 \times 2
     \]
     \[
     c = 6
     \]

4. **Conclusion**:
   - Matt needs to eat 6 carrot sticks in order to have a total of 5 cookies.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{6}
\]
