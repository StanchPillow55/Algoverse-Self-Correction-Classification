==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to determine how old Lydia will be when she can eat an apple from the tree she planted.

1. **Understanding the timeline**:
   - Lydia planted the apple tree when she was 4 years old.
   - She is currently 9 years old.

2. **Calculating the age of the tree**:
   - Since Lydia is now 9 years old and she planted the tree at 4 years old, we can find out how many years have passed since she planted the tree:
     \[
     \text{Years since planting} = \text{Current age} - \text{Age when planted} = 9 - 4 = 5 \text{ years}
     \]

3. **Determining when the tree will bear fruit**:
   - According to the problem, it takes 7 years for the apple tree to bear fruit. Since 5 years have already passed since Lydia planted the tree, we need to find out how many more years it will take for the tree to bear fruit:
     \[
     \text{Years remaining until tree bears fruit} = 7 - 5 = 2 \text{ years}
     \]

4. **Calculating Lydia's age when she can eat the apples**:
   - Since it will take 2 more years for the tree to bear fruit, we add this to Lydia's current age:
     \[
     \text{Lydia's age when she can eat apples} = \text{Current age} + \text{Years remaining} = 9 + 2 = 11 \text{ years old}
     \]

5. **Final answer**:
   - Therefore, Lydia will be **11 years old** when she gets to eat an apple from her tree for the first time.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{11}
\]
