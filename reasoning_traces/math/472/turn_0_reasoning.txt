==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine how many more years it will take for Lydia's apple tree to bear fruit, given the information about when she planted it and her current age.

1. **Identify the age when Lydia planted the tree:**
   - Lydia planted the tree when she was 4 years old.

2. **Determine the current age of Lydia:**
   - Lydia is currently 9 years old.

3. **Calculate how many years have passed since Lydia planted the tree:**
   - Current age of Lydia: 9 years old
   - Age when she planted the tree: 4 years old
   - Years passed since planting = Current age - Age when planted
   \[
   9 - 4 = 5 \text{ years}
   \]

4. **Determine the total time required for the tree to bear fruit:**
   - It takes 7 years for the apple tree to bear fruit.

5. **Calculate how many more years it will take for the tree to bear fruit:**
   - Total time required for the tree to bear fruit: 7 years
   - Years already passed since planting: 5 years
   - Remaining years until the tree bears fruit = Total time required - Years passed
   \[
   7 - 5 = 2 \text{ years}
   \]

6. **Calculate Lydia's age when the tree bears fruit:**
   - Current age of Lydia: 9 years old
   - Additional years until the tree bears fruit: 2 years
   - Lydia's age when the tree bears fruit = Current age + Additional years
   \[
   9 + 2 = 11 \text{ years old}
   \]

Therefore, Lydia will be 11 years old when she gets to eat an apple from her tree for the first time.

**Final Answer: Lydia will be 11 years old.**
