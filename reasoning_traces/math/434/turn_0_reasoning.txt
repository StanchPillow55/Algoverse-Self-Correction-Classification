To solve this problem, we need to determine what percentage of his goal Calvin has achieved with the hair clippings from his haircuts.

First, let's define the total number of haircuts Calvin needs to reach his goal. According to the problem, Calvin has already had 8 haircuts and needs 2 more to reach his goal. Therefore, the total number of haircuts required is:

\[ 8 \text{ (current haircuts)} + 2 \text{ (additional haircuts needed)} = 10 \text{ haircuts} \]

Next, we need to calculate the percentage of his goal that Calvin has already achieved with the 8 haircuts he has had. The percentage can be calculated using the formula:

\[ \text{Percentage achieved} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of haircuts completed}}{\text{Total number of haircuts needed}} \right) \times 100\% \]

Substitute the known values into the formula:

\[ \text{Percentage achieved} = \left( \frac{8}{10} \right) \times 100\% \]

Now, perform the division:

\[ \frac{8}{10} = 0.8 \]

Then, convert the decimal to a percentage by multiplying by 100:

\[ 0.8 \times 100\% = 80\% \]

Therefore, Calvin is 80% towards his goal.

Final Answer:
Calvin is 80% towards his goal.
