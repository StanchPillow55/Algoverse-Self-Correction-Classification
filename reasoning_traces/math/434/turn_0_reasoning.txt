Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To determine what percentage Calvin is towards his goal of haircuts, we first need to establish how many haircuts he needs in total and how many he has completed so far.

1. **Identify the total number of haircuts needed:**
   Calvin has already had 8 haircuts and he needs 2 more haircuts to reach his goal. Therefore, the total number of haircuts he needs is:
   \[
   \text{Total haircuts needed} = \text{Haircuts completed} + \text{Haircuts remaining} = 8 + 2 = 10
   \]

2. **Determine how many haircuts he has completed:**
   Calvin has completed 8 haircuts.

3. **Calculate the percentage of the goal achieved:**
   To find out what percentage of the goal he has achieved, we can use the formula for percentage:
   \[
   \text{Percentage achieved} = \left( \frac{\text{Haircuts completed}}{\text{Total haircuts needed}} \right) \times 100
   \]
   Plugging in the numbers:
   \[
   \text{Percentage achieved} = \left( \frac{8}{10} \right) \times 100
   \]

4. **Perform the division:**
   \[
   \frac{8}{10} = 0.8
   \]

5. **Convert to percentage:**
   \[
   0.8 \times 100 = 80
   \]

Thus, Calvin is 80% towards his goal of haircuts.

**Final Answer:**
Calvin is 80% towards his goal.
