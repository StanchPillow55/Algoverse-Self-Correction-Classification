Question ID: 434
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine what percentage of his goal Calvin has achieved with the hair clippings he has collected so far.

1. **Understand the Total Goal:**
   - Calvin needs a total of 8 (already gotten) + 2 (more needed) = 10 haircuts to reach his goal.

2. **Determine Current Progress:**
   - Calvin has already gotten 8 haircuts.

3. **Calculate the Percentage Towards the Goal:**
   - To find the percentage of the goal he has achieved, we use the formula for percentage:
     \[
     \text{Percentage} = \left(\frac{\text{Current Progress}}{\text{Total Goal}}\right) \times 100
     \]
   - Plug in the numbers:
     \[
     \text{Percentage} = \left(\frac{8}{10}\right) \times 100
     \]

4. **Perform the Calculation:**
   - First, divide 8 by 10:
     \[
     \frac{8}{10} = 0.8
     \]
   - Then, multiply by 100 to convert to a percentage:
     \[
     0.8 \times 100 = 80
     \]

5. **Conclusion:**
   - Calvin is 80% towards his goal of collecting enough hair clippings for the wig.

Therefore, the final answer is that Calvin is **80%** towards his goal.
