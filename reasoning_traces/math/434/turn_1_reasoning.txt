Question ID: 434
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To determine what percentage Calvin is towards his goal, we need to understand the relationship between the number of haircuts he has already had and the total number he needs to reach his goal.

1. **Identify the Total Number of Haircuts Needed:**
   Calvin has already had 8 haircuts and needs 2 more to reach his goal. Therefore, the total number of haircuts required to reach his goal is:
   \[
   8 \text{ (haircuts already had)} + 2 \text{ (more needed)} = 10 \text{ (total haircuts needed)}
   \]

2. **Calculate the Percentage Towards the Goal:**
   Calvin has already had 8 haircuts out of the 10 total haircuts needed. To find the percentage towards his goal, we use the formula for percentage:
   \[
   \text{Percentage towards goal} = \left(\frac{\text{Number of haircuts already had}}{\text{Total number of haircuts needed}}\right) \times 100\%
   \]

   Substituting the known values:
   \[
   \text{Percentage towards goal} = \left(\frac{8}{10}\right) \times 100\%
   \]

3. **Perform the Calculation:**
   \[
   \frac{8}{10} = 0.8
   \]
   \[
   0.8 \times 100\% = 80\%
   \]

Therefore, Calvin is 80% towards his goal of saving enough hair clippings for his dog's wig.

**Final Answer:**
Calvin is 80% towards his goal.
