Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To find out how much Tanya earned for teaching on Monday and Wednesday, we will calculate her earnings for each day separately and then sum them up.

### Step 1: Calculate Monday's Earnings
- **Classes Taught**: 4 classes
- **Hours Worked**: 5 hours

**Hourly Earnings**:
Tanya earns $15 for every hour she teaches. Therefore, for 5 hours:
\[
\text{Earnings from hours} = 5 \text{ hours} \times 15 \text{ dollars/hour} = 75 \text{ dollars}
\]

**Daily Bonus**:
Since Tanya taught more than 3 classes on Monday (she taught 4), she qualifies for the additional $5 bonus:
\[
\text{Bonus} = 5 \text{ dollars}
\]

**Total Earnings for Monday**:
\[
\text{Total Monday Earnings} = \text{Earnings from hours} + \text{Bonus} = 75 \text{ dollars} + 5 \text{ dollars} = 80 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate Wednesday's Earnings
- **Classes Taught**: 2 classes
- **Hours Worked**: 2 hours

**Hourly Earnings**:
For 2 hours of teaching:
\[
\text{Earnings from hours} = 2 \text{ hours} \times 15 \text{ dollars/hour} = 30 \text{ dollars}
\]

**Daily Bonus**:
Since Tanya taught 2 classes on Wednesday, which is not more than 3, she does not qualify for the bonus:
\[
\text{Bonus} = 0 \text{ dollars}
\]

**Total Earnings for Wednesday**:
\[
\text{Total Wednesday Earnings} = \text{Earnings from hours} + \text{Bonus} = 30 \text{ dollars} + 0 \text{ dollars} = 30 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate Total Earnings for Both Days
Now, we add the earnings from both days:
\[
\text{Total Earnings} = \text{Total Monday Earnings} + \text{Total Wednesday Earnings} = 80 \text{ dollars} + 30 \text{ dollars} = 110 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Final Answer
Tanya earned a total of **$110** for teaching on Monday and Wednesday.
