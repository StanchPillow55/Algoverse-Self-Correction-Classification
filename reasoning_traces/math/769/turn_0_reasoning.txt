To calculate Tanya's earnings for the two days of teaching, we will break down her earnings for each day separately and then sum them up.

### Step 1: Calculate Earnings for Monday

On Monday, Tanya teaches:
- **Number of classes**: 4
- **Hours taught**: 5

**Hourly Earnings**:
Tanya earns $15 per hour. Therefore, for 5 hours, her earnings are calculated as follows:
\[
\text{Hourly Earnings} = \text{Hours} \times \text{Rate per Hour} = 5 \, \text{hours} \times 15 \, \text{dollars/hour} = 75 \, \text{dollars}
\]

**Daily Bonus**:
Since Tanya taught more than 3 classes (she taught 4 classes), she qualifies for the additional $5 bonus for the day.
\[
\text{Daily Bonus} = 5 \, \text{dollars}
\]

**Total Earnings for Monday**:
Now, we add her hourly earnings and the daily bonus:
\[
\text{Total Earnings (Monday)} = \text{Hourly Earnings} + \text{Daily Bonus} = 75 \, \text{dollars} + 5 \, \text{dollars} = 80 \, \text{dollars}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate Earnings for Wednesday

On Wednesday, Tanya teaches:
- **Number of classes**: 2
- **Hours taught**: 2

**Hourly Earnings**:
Again, she earns $15 per hour. Therefore, for 2 hours, her earnings are calculated as follows:
\[
\text{Hourly Earnings} = \text{Hours} \times \text{Rate per Hour} = 2 \, \text{hours} \times 15 \, \text{dollars/hour} = 30 \, \text{dollars}
\]

**Daily Bonus**:
Since Tanya taught 2 classes, which is not more than 3, she does not qualify for the additional bonus.
\[
\text{Daily Bonus} = 0 \, \text{dollars}
\]

**Total Earnings for Wednesday**:
Now, we add her hourly earnings and the daily bonus:
\[
\text{Total Earnings (Wednesday)} = \text{Hourly Earnings} + \text{Daily Bonus} = 30 \, \text{dollars} + 0 \, \text{dollars} = 30 \, \text{dollars}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate Total Earnings for Both Days

Now, we sum the total earnings from both days:
\[
\text{Total Earnings (Both Days)} = \text{Total Earnings (Monday)} + \text{Total Earnings (Wednesday)} = 80 \, \text{dollars} + 30 \, \text{dollars} = 110 \, \text{dollars}
\]

### Final Answer
Tanya earned a total of **$110** for the two days of teaching.
