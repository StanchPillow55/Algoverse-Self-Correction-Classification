Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 81," we need to first understand what the problem is asking. Since the problem is not explicitly stated, I will assume that it involves the number 81 in some mathematical context. Let's consider a few possibilities and solve them step by step.

### Possibility 1: Find the Square Root of 81

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We are asked to find the square root of 81.

2. **Mathematical Concept:**
   - The square root of a number \( x \) is a number \( y \) such that \( y^2 = x \).

3. **Calculation:**
   - We need to find \( y \) such that \( y^2 = 81 \).
   - Testing small integers, we find:
     - \( 8^2 = 64 \)
     - \( 9^2 = 81 \)

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The square root of 81 is 9.

### Possibility 2: Determine if 81 is a Perfect Square

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to determine if 81 is a perfect square.

2. **Mathematical Concept:**
   - A perfect square is an integer that is the square of an integer.

3. **Calculation:**
   - From the previous calculation, we found that \( 9^2 = 81 \).

4. **Conclusion:**
   - Since 81 can be expressed as \( 9^2 \), it is indeed a perfect square.

### Possibility 3: Factor 81 into Prime Factors

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find the prime factorization of 81.

2. **Mathematical Concept:**
   - Prime factorization involves expressing a number as a product of its prime factors.

3. **Calculation:**
   - Start with the smallest prime number, 2. Since 81 is odd, it is not divisible by 2.
   - Next, try 3:
     - \( 81 \div 3 = 27 \)
     - \( 27 \div 3 = 9 \)
     - \( 9 \div 3 = 3 \)
     - \( 3 \div 3 = 1 \)
   - Thus, the prime factorization of 81 is \( 3^4 \).

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The prime factorization of 81 is \( 3^4 \).

### Final Answer

Since the problem "Sample math problem 81" was not explicitly defined, I explored several interpretations involving the number 81. Here are the conclusions for each possibility:

1. The square root of 81 is 9.
2. 81 is a perfect square.
3. The prime factorization of 81 is \( 3^4 \).

If you have a specific problem involving the number 81, please provide more details for a precise solution.
