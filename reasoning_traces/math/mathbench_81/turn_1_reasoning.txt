Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 81," we need to first understand what the problem is asking. However, the problem statement "Sample math problem 81" is not specific enough to determine the exact nature of the problem. Since no specific details or numbers are provided, I will assume this is a placeholder for a generic math problem involving the number 81.

Let's consider a few possible interpretations of a math problem involving the number 81 and solve them:

### Problem 1: Find the square root of 81.

**Step 1: Understand the problem.**
We need to find a number that, when multiplied by itself, gives 81.

**Step 2: Calculate the square root.**
The square root of 81 is a number \( x \) such that \( x^2 = 81 \).

**Step 3: Solve for \( x \).**
We know that \( 9 \times 9 = 81 \), so \( x = 9 \).

**Final Answer:**
The square root of 81 is 9.

### Problem 2: Determine if 81 is a perfect square.

**Step 1: Understand the problem.**
A perfect square is an integer that is the square of another integer.

**Step 2: Check if 81 is a perfect square.**
We already found that \( 9 \times 9 = 81 \).

**Step 3: Conclusion.**
Since 81 can be expressed as \( 9^2 \), it is a perfect square.

**Final Answer:**
Yes, 81 is a perfect square.

### Problem 3: Factor 81 into its prime factors.

**Step 1: Understand the problem.**
We need to express 81 as a product of prime numbers.

**Step 2: Start factoring 81.**
81 is an odd number, so it is not divisible by 2. Let's try dividing by 3, the smallest odd prime number.

\[ 81 \div 3 = 27 \]

27 is also divisible by 3:

\[ 27 \div 3 = 9 \]

9 is divisible by 3:

\[ 9 \div 3 = 3 \]

Finally, 3 is a prime number.

**Step 3: Write the prime factorization.**
The prime factorization of 81 is \( 3 \times 3 \times 3 \times 3 \) or \( 3^4 \).

**Final Answer:**
The prime factorization of 81 is \( 3^4 \).

### Conclusion

Since the original problem statement "Sample math problem 81" is ambiguous, I have provided solutions to several common math problems involving the number 81. If you have a specific problem in mind, please provide more details so I can address it directly.
