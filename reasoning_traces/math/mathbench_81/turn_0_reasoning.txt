==================================================

To solve the problem, we first need to understand what "Sample math problem 81" refers to. Since no specific details are provided about the problem, I'll assume it's a generic math problem involving the number 81. A common problem involving 81 is finding its square root or solving an equation where 81 is a component. Let's explore a few possibilities:

### Problem 1: Find the square root of 81.

**Step 1: Understand the problem.**
We need to find a number that, when multiplied by itself, equals 81.

**Step 2: Recall the definition of a square root.**
The square root of a number \( x \) is a number \( y \) such that \( y^2 = x \).

**Step 3: Calculate the square root of 81.**
We know that:
\[ 9 \times 9 = 81 \]

Therefore, the square root of 81 is 9.

**Final Answer:**
The square root of 81 is 9.

### Problem 2: Solve the equation \( x^2 = 81 \).

**Step 1: Understand the problem.**
We need to find the value(s) of \( x \) such that when \( x \) is squared, it equals 81.

**Step 2: Set up the equation.**
The equation is:
\[ x^2 = 81 \]

**Step 3: Solve for \( x \).**
To solve for \( x \), take the square root of both sides of the equation:
\[ x = \pm \sqrt{81} \]

**Step 4: Calculate the square root.**
As calculated previously, \( \sqrt{81} = 9 \).

Thus, the solutions are:
\[ x = 9 \quad \text{or} \quad x = -9 \]

**Final Answer:**
The solutions to the equation \( x^2 = 81 \) are \( x = 9 \) and \( x = -9 \).

### Problem 3: Factor the expression \( x^2 - 81 \).

**Step 1: Recognize the expression as a difference of squares.**
The expression \( x^2 - 81 \) can be factored using the difference of squares formula:
\[ a^2 - b^2 = (a - b)(a + b) \]

**Step 2: Identify \( a \) and \( b \).**
Here, \( a = x \) and \( b = 9 \) because \( 81 = 9^2 \).

**Step 3: Apply the difference of squares formula.**
\[ x^2 - 81 = (x - 9)(x + 9) \]

**Final Answer:**
The expression \( x^2 - 81 \) factors to \( (x - 9)(x + 9) \).

These are some possible interpretations of "Sample math problem 81." If you have a specific problem in mind, please provide more details, and I can help solve that particular problem.
