==================================================

To solve the math problem "Sample math problem 81," we first need to understand what the specific problem is asking. Since the problem statement is not fully provided, I'll assume that "Sample math problem 81" refers to a problem involving the number 81. A common type of problem involving the number 81 is finding its square root, solving an equation, or performing some arithmetic operation. Let's explore a few possibilities:

### 1. Finding the Square Root of 81

The square root of a number \( x \) is a number \( y \) such that \( y^2 = x \). For the number 81, we want to find \( y \) such that:

\[
y^2 = 81
\]

We know that:

\[
9^2 = 81
\]

Thus, the square root of 81 is:

\[
y = 9
\]

### 2. Solving an Equation Involving 81

Let's consider a simple equation where we solve for \( x \):

\[
x + 81 = 100
\]

To solve for \( x \), we subtract 81 from both sides:

\[
x = 100 - 81
\]

\[
x = 19
\]

### 3. Performing Arithmetic Operations with 81

Let's perform a basic arithmetic operation, such as multiplication:

\[
81 \times 2 = 162
\]

### Conclusion

Since the specific problem involving 81 was not provided, I demonstrated several common mathematical operations involving the number 81. If you have a specific problem in mind, please provide more details. However, based on the assumptions made, the solutions are:

1. The square root of 81 is 9.
2. Solving the equation \( x + 81 = 100 \) gives \( x = 19 \).
3. Multiplying 81 by 2 gives 162.

If you have a specific problem or context for "Sample math problem 81," please provide additional details for a more precise solution.
