To solve the problem, we will follow these steps:

1. **Determine the total number of students in the school.**
   Each class has 20 students, and there are 3 classes:
   \[
   \text{Total students} = 20 \text{ students/class} \times 3 \text{ classes} = 60 \text{ students}
   \]

2. **Calculate the number of boys and girls in the school.**
   The school is 50% boys and 50% girls, so:
   \[
   \text{Number of boys} = 50\% \text{ of } 60 = 0.5 \times 60 = 30 \text{ boys}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Number of girls} = 50\% \text{ of } 60 = 0.5 \times 60 = 30 \text{ girls}
   \]

3. **Determine the number of girls in the first and second classes.**
   - First class has 15 girls.
   - Second class has 12 girls.

4. **Calculate the total number of girls in the first two classes.**
   \[
   \text{Total girls in first two classes} = 15 + 12 = 27 \text{ girls}
   \]

5. **Calculate the number of girls in the third class.**
   Since there are a total of 30 girls in the school, we can find the number of girls in the third class:
   \[
   \text{Girls in third class} = \text{Total girls} - \text{Total girls in first two classes} = 30 - 27 = 3 \text{ girls}
   \]

6. **Determine the total number of boys in the first two classes.**
   Each class has 20 students, so the number of boys in each of the first two classes can be calculated as follows:
   - First class: 
     \[
     \text{Boys in first class} = 20 - 15 = 5 \text{ boys}
     \]
   - Second class: 
     \[
     \text{Boys in second class} = 20 - 12 = 8 \text{ boys}
     \]

7. **Calculate the total number of boys in the first two classes.**
   \[
   \text{Total boys in first two classes} = 5 + 8 = 13 \text{ boys}
   \]

8. **Determine the number of boys in the third class.**
   Since there are a total of 30 boys in the school, we can find the number of boys in the third class:
   \[
   \text{Boys in third class} = \text{Total boys} - \text{Total boys in first two classes} = 30 - 13 = 17 \text{ boys}
   \]

Thus, the number of boys in the third class is \( \boxed{17} \).
