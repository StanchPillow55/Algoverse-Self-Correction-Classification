==================================================

To determine how heavy the weights felt when being lowered on the exercise machine, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total weight of the plates**: 
   Tom uses 10 weight plates, each weighing 30 pounds. Therefore, the total weight of the plates is calculated as follows:

   \[
   \text{Total weight} = \text{Number of plates} \times \text{Weight per plate}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total weight} = 10 \times 30 = 300 \text{ pounds}
   \]

2. **Calculate the increased weight due to the machine's technology**: 
   The exercise machine makes the weights feel 20% heavier during the lowering portion. To find out how much heavier the weights feel, we need to calculate 20% of the total weight and then add that to the original total weight.

   First, we calculate 20% of the total weight:

   \[
   \text{20% of total weight} = 0.20 \times \text{Total weight}
   \]
   \[
   \text{20% of total weight} = 0.20 \times 300 = 60 \text{ pounds}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total effective weight felt during lowering**: 
   Now, we add the original total weight to the additional weight due to the machine's technology:

   \[
   \text{Effective weight during lowering} = \text{Total weight} + \text{20% of total weight}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Effective weight during lowering} = 300 + 60 = 360 \text{ pounds}
   \]

Thus, the weights felt like they were 360 pounds when being lowered.

**Final Answer**: The weights felt like 360 pounds when being lowered.
