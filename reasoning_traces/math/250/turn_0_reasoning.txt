==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine how heavy the weights feel when being lowered, given that the exercise machine makes them 20% heavier during this phase.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Determine the Total Weight of the Plates:**
   - Tom uses 10 weight plates.
   - Each plate weighs 30 pounds.
   - Therefore, the total weight of the plates is calculated as follows:
     \[
     \text{Total Weight} = 10 \times 30 = 300 \text{ pounds}
     \]

2. **Calculate the Increased Weight During Lowering:**
   - The exercise machine makes the weights feel 20% heavier during the lowering phase.
   - To find 20% of the total weight, we calculate:
     \[
     20\% \text{ of 300 pounds} = 0.20 \times 300 = 60 \text{ pounds}
     \]

3. **Determine the Effective Weight During Lowering:**
   - The effective weight during the lowering phase is the original total weight plus the additional 20%.
   - Therefore, the effective weight is:
     \[
     \text{Effective Weight} = 300 + 60 = 360 \text{ pounds}
     \]

### Final Answer:
The weights feel like they weigh 360 pounds when being lowered.
