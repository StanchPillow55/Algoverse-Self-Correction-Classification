==================================================

To find out how many push-ups Bryan did in total, we can break the problem down step by step.

1. **Calculate the number of push-ups in the first two sets:**
   - Bryan does 3 sets of 15 push-ups each.
   - For the first two sets, he does:
     \[
     15 \text{ push-ups/set} \times 2 \text{ sets} = 30 \text{ push-ups}
     \]

2. **Calculate the number of push-ups in the third set:**
   - In the third set, he gets tired and does 5 fewer push-ups than the usual 15.
   - Therefore, the number of push-ups he does in the third set is:
     \[
     15 \text{ push-ups} - 5 \text{ push-ups} = 10 \text{ push-ups}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total number of push-ups:**
   - Now, we add the push-ups from the first two sets and the third set:
     \[
     30 \text{ push-ups (first two sets)} + 10 \text{ push-ups (third set)} = 40 \text{ push-ups}
     \]

Thus, the total number of push-ups Bryan did is **40**.

Final answer: **40 push-ups**.
