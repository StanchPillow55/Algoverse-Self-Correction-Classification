To solve the problem, we need to calculate the total number of push-ups Bryan did during his workout.

1. **Identify the number of sets and push-ups per set**:
   - Bryan plans to do 3 sets of push-ups.
   - Each set consists of 15 push-ups.

2. **Calculate the total push-ups for the first two sets**:
   - For the first set: 15 push-ups
   - For the second set: 15 push-ups
   - Total for the first two sets = 15 + 15 = 30 push-ups

3. **Calculate the push-ups in the third set**:
   - In the third set, Bryan gets tired and does 5 fewer push-ups than the planned 15.
   - Therefore, the number of push-ups he does in the third set = 15 - 5 = 10 push-ups.

4. **Calculate the total number of push-ups**:
   - Total push-ups = Push-ups from the first set + Push-ups from the second set + Push-ups from the third set
   - Total push-ups = 15 + 15 + 10 = 40 push-ups

5. **Final answer**:
   - Bryan did a total of **40 push-ups**.

Thus, the final answer is **40 push-ups**.
