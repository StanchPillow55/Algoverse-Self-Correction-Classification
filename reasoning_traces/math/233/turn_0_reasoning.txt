To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of push-ups Bryan did, considering the reduction in the number of push-ups in the third set.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Understanding the Sets and Push-ups:**
   - Bryan plans to do 3 sets of push-ups.
   - Each set is supposed to have 15 push-ups.

2. **Calculating Push-ups for the First Two Sets:**
   - The first set has 15 push-ups.
   - The second set also has 15 push-ups.
   - Therefore, the total push-ups for the first two sets is:
     \[
     15 + 15 = 30 \text{ push-ups}
     \]

3. **Calculating Push-ups for the Third Set:**
   - In the third set, Bryan does 5 fewer push-ups than planned.
   - Originally, he planned to do 15 push-ups in the third set.
   - So, the number of push-ups he actually does in the third set is:
     \[
     15 - 5 = 10 \text{ push-ups}
     \]

4. **Calculating the Total Number of Push-ups:**
   - Now, we add the push-ups from all three sets:
     \[
     30 \text{ (from the first two sets)} + 10 \text{ (from the third set)} = 40 \text{ push-ups}
     \]

Thus, the total number of push-ups Bryan did is \(\boxed{40}\).
