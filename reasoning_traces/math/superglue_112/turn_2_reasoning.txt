==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 112" refers to. Since the problem statement does not provide specific details about the question, I'll demonstrate a general approach to solving a reasoning-based math problem. 

Let's assume "Sample reasoning question 112" is a typical math problem involving basic arithmetic or algebra. I'll create a hypothetical problem and solve it step-by-step:

**Hypothetical Problem:**
A store sells apples at $2 each and bananas at $1.50 each. If a customer buys a total of 10 fruits consisting of apples and bananas and spends $17, how many apples and how many bananas did the customer buy?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( a \) be the number of apples.
   - Let \( b \) be the number of bananas.

2. **Set Up Equations:**
   - From the problem, we have two key pieces of information:
     1. The total number of fruits is 10: 
        \[
        a + b = 10
        \]
     2. The total cost is $17:
        \[
        2a + 1.5b = 17
        \]

3. **Solve the System of Equations:**

   We have the system:
   \[
   \begin{align*}
   a + b &= 10 \quad \text{(Equation 1)} \\
   2a + 1.5b &= 17 \quad \text{(Equation 2)}
   \end{align*}
   \]

   **Substitution Method:**

   - Solve Equation 1 for \( b \):
     \[
     b = 10 - a
     \]

   - Substitute \( b = 10 - a \) into Equation 2:
     \[
     2a + 1.5(10 - a) = 17
     \]

   - Simplify and solve for \( a \):
     \[
     2a + 15 - 1.5a = 17
     \]
     \[
     0.5a + 15 = 17
     \]
     \[
     0.5a = 2
     \]
     \[
     a = 4
     \]

   - Substitute \( a = 4 \) back into the equation for \( b \):
     \[
     b = 10 - 4 = 6
     \]

4. **Verify the Solution:**

   - Check the total number of fruits:
     \[
     a + b = 4 + 6 = 10
     \]
     This is correct.

   - Check the total cost:
     \[
     2a + 1.5b = 2(4) + 1.5(6) = 8 + 9 = 17
     \]
     This is also correct.

5. **Final Answer:**
   The customer bought 4 apples and 6 bananas.

This step-by-step approach demonstrates how to solve a reasoning-based math problem by defining variables, setting up equations, solving the system of equations, and verifying the solution.
