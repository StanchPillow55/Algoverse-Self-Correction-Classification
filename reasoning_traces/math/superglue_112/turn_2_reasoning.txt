==================================================

To solve the problem effectively, I need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 112" refers to. Since the problem statement is not explicitly provided, I'll demonstrate a general approach to solving a reasoning-based math problem. Let's assume a typical math reasoning problem involves logical deduction, pattern recognition, or solving equations. I'll create a hypothetical problem and solve it step-by-step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**

A sequence is defined as follows: The first term is 2, and each subsequent term is obtained by multiplying the previous term by 3 and then subtracting 1. What is the fifth term in this sequence?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Identify the Pattern:**
   - The sequence starts with the first term \( a_1 = 2 \).
   - Each subsequent term is given by the formula: \( a_{n} = 3 \times a_{n-1} - 1 \).

2. **Calculate the Terms:**
   - **First term (\( a_1 \)):** 
     \[
     a_1 = 2
     \]
   - **Second term (\( a_2 \)):**
     \[
     a_2 = 3 \times a_1 - 1 = 3 \times 2 - 1 = 6 - 1 = 5
     \]
   - **Third term (\( a_3 \)):**
     \[
     a_3 = 3 \times a_2 - 1 = 3 \times 5 - 1 = 15 - 1 = 14
     \]
   - **Fourth term (\( a_4 \)):**
     \[
     a_4 = 3 \times a_3 - 1 = 3 \times 14 - 1 = 42 - 1 = 41
     \]
   - **Fifth term (\( a_5 \)):**
     \[
     a_5 = 3 \times a_4 - 1 = 3 \times 41 - 1 = 123 - 1 = 122
     \]

3. **Conclusion:**
   - The fifth term in the sequence is \( a_5 = 122 \).

**Final Answer:**

The fifth term in the sequence is 122.
