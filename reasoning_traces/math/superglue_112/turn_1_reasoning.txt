Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 112" refers to. Since the problem statement is not specific and does not provide any details about the nature of the question, we will need to make some assumptions or request further clarification.

However, for the sake of this exercise, let's assume that "Sample reasoning question 112" is a placeholder for a typical math problem. Since no specific details are provided, I will create a hypothetical math problem and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**

"Calculate the sum of the first 112 positive integers."

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   We need to find the sum of the first 112 positive integers. The sequence of the first 112 positive integers is: 1, 2, 3, ..., 112.

2. **Identify the Formula:**
   The sum of the first \( n \) positive integers can be calculated using the formula:
   \[
   S = \frac{n(n + 1)}{2}
   \]
   where \( S \) is the sum and \( n \) is the number of terms.

3. **Substitute the Values:**
   Here, \( n = 112 \). Substitute 112 into the formula:
   \[
   S = \frac{112(112 + 1)}{2}
   \]

4. **Calculate the Expression:**
   First, calculate \( 112 + 1 \):
   \[
   112 + 1 = 113
   \]

   Next, multiply 112 by 113:
   \[
   112 \times 113 = 12656
   \]

   Finally, divide by 2 to find the sum:
   \[
   S = \frac{12656}{2} = 6328
   \]

5. **Conclusion:**
   The sum of the first 112 positive integers is 6328.

**Final Answer:**

The sum of the first 112 positive integers is 6328.
