==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 112" refers to. Since the problem statement does not provide specific details or context about this question, I will assume it is a hypothetical math problem. Let's create a sample math problem and solve it step by step.

**Sample Problem 112:**
A company produces two types of widgets: Type A and Type B. The company sells Type A widgets for $50 each and Type B widgets for $70 each. Last month, the company sold a total of 500 widgets and made $30,000 in revenue. How many of each type of widget did the company sell?

**Step 1: Define Variables**
Let \( x \) be the number of Type A widgets sold.
Let \( y \) be the number of Type B widgets sold.

**Step 2: Set Up Equations**
We have two pieces of information that can be translated into equations:
1. The total number of widgets sold is 500.
   \[
   x + y = 500
   \]
2. The total revenue from selling the widgets is $30,000.
   \[
   50x + 70y = 30,000
   \]

**Step 3: Solve the System of Equations**
We have the following system of equations:
\[
\begin{align*}
x + y &= 500 \quad \text{(Equation 1)} \\
50x + 70y &= 30,000 \quad \text{(Equation 2)}
\end{align*}
\]

First, solve Equation 1 for \( y \):
\[
y = 500 - x
\]

Substitute \( y = 500 - x \) into Equation 2:
\[
50x + 70(500 - x) = 30,000
\]

Expand and simplify:
\[
50x + 35,000 - 70x = 30,000
\]

Combine like terms:
\[
-20x + 35,000 = 30,000
\]

Subtract 35,000 from both sides:
\[
-20x = -5,000
\]

Divide by -20:
\[
x = 250
\]

Substitute \( x = 250 \) back into the equation for \( y \):
\[
y = 500 - 250 = 250
\]

**Step 4: Verify the Solution**
Check the solution against both original equations:
- Equation 1: \( x + y = 250 + 250 = 500 \) (Correct)
- Equation 2: \( 50(250) + 70(250) = 12,500 + 17,500 = 30,000 \) (Correct)

Both equations are satisfied, confirming our solution is correct.

**Final Answer:**
The company sold 250 Type A widgets and 250 Type B widgets.
