==================================================

To solve the problem, we first need to understand what "Sample math problem 147" refers to. Since there is no specific problem statement provided, I'll assume this is a placeholder for a generic math problem. For demonstration purposes, let's create a math problem and solve it step by step.

**Problem:**
Calculate the sum of all even numbers between 1 and 147.

**Solution:**

1. **Identify the even numbers between 1 and 147:**
   - Even numbers are integers divisible by 2.
   - The smallest even number greater than 1 is 2.
   - The largest even number less than or equal to 147 is 146.

2. **List the even numbers:**
   - The even numbers between 1 and 147 are: 2, 4, 6, ..., 146.

3. **Determine the sequence of even numbers:**
   - This sequence is an arithmetic sequence where the first term \(a_1 = 2\) and the common difference \(d = 2\).

4. **Find the number of terms in the sequence:**
   - The \(n\)-th term of an arithmetic sequence can be found using the formula:
     \[
     a_n = a_1 + (n-1) \cdot d
     \]
   - Setting \(a_n = 146\), we solve for \(n\):
     \[
     146 = 2 + (n-1) \cdot 2
     \]
     \[
     146 = 2 + 2n - 2
     \]
     \[
     146 = 2n
     \]
     \[
     n = \frac{146}{2} = 73
     \]
   - There are 73 even numbers between 1 and 147.

5. **Calculate the sum of the sequence:**
   - The sum \(S_n\) of the first \(n\) terms of an arithmetic sequence is given by:
     \[
     S_n = \frac{n}{2} \cdot (a_1 + a_n)
     \]
   - Substituting the known values:
     \[
     S_{73} = \frac{73}{2} \cdot (2 + 146)
     \]
     \[
     S_{73} = \frac{73}{2} \cdot 148
     \]
     \[
     S_{73} = 73 \cdot 74
     \]
     \[
     S_{73} = 5402
     \]

**Final Answer:**
The sum of all even numbers between 1 and 147 is 5402.
