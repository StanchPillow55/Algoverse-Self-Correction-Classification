==================================================

To solve the problem, we first need to understand what "Sample math problem 147" refers to. Since no specific details are provided about the problem, I'll assume it's a generic math problem involving the number 147. Let's explore a few possibilities:

### Possibility 1: Prime Factorization of 147

One common type of problem is finding the prime factorization of a number. Let's find the prime factors of 147.

1. **Check divisibility by 2**: 147 is odd, so it's not divisible by 2.
2. **Check divisibility by 3**: Sum of the digits of 147 is \(1 + 4 + 7 = 12\), which is divisible by 3. Therefore, 147 is divisible by 3.
   \[
   147 \div 3 = 49
   \]
   So, 147 can be expressed as \(3 \times 49\).

3. **Factor 49**: 49 is a perfect square and can be expressed as \(7 \times 7\).

Thus, the prime factorization of 147 is:
\[
147 = 3 \times 7 \times 7 = 3 \times 7^2
\]

### Possibility 2: Solving a Simple Equation Involving 147

Another possibility is solving a simple equation where 147 is involved. For example, let's solve for \(x\) in the equation:
\[ 
2x + 3 = 147 
\]

1. **Subtract 3 from both sides**:
   \[
   2x + 3 - 3 = 147 - 3
   \]
   \[
   2x = 144
   \]

2. **Divide both sides by 2**:
   \[
   \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{144}{2}
   \]
   \[
   x = 72
   \]

### Possibility 3: Calculating the Square Root of 147

Another potential problem could involve calculating the square root of 147. Let's approximate \(\sqrt{147}\).

1. **Estimate between perfect squares**: 
   - \(12^2 = 144\)
   - \(13^2 = 169\)

   Therefore, \(\sqrt{147}\) is between 12 and 13.

2. **Refine the estimate**: 
   - Try \(12.1\): \(12.1^2 = 146.41\)
   - Try \(12.2\): \(12.2^2 = 148.84\)

   Since 146.41 is closer to 147 than 148.84, \(\sqrt{147} \approx 12.1\).

### Final Answer

Since the original problem "Sample math problem 147" is not specified, I've explored several possibilities. Here are the final answers for each scenario:

1. **Prime Factorization**: \(147 = 3 \times 7^2\)
2. **Equation Solution**: \(x = 72\) for the equation \(2x + 3 = 147\)
3. **Square Root Approximation**: \(\sqrt{147} \approx 12.1\)
