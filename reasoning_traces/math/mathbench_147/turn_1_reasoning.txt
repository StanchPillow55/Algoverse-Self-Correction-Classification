Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 147," we first need to understand what the problem is asking. However, the problem statement "Sample math problem 147" is not specific enough to determine the exact nature of the problem. Therefore, I will assume a hypothetical math problem and solve it step by step.

Let's assume the problem is as follows:

**Problem:** Calculate the sum of the first 147 positive integers.

To solve this problem, we can use the formula for the sum of the first \( n \) positive integers. The formula is:

\[
S_n = \frac{n(n + 1)}{2}
\]

where \( S_n \) is the sum of the first \( n \) positive integers.

**Step 1:** Identify \( n \).

In this case, \( n = 147 \).

**Step 2:** Substitute \( n \) into the formula.

\[
S_{147} = \frac{147(147 + 1)}{2}
\]

**Step 3:** Simplify the expression inside the parentheses.

\[
147 + 1 = 148
\]

**Step 4:** Substitute back into the formula.

\[
S_{147} = \frac{147 \times 148}{2}
\]

**Step 5:** Calculate the product of 147 and 148.

\[
147 \times 148 = 21756
\]

**Step 6:** Divide the product by 2 to find the sum.

\[
S_{147} = \frac{21756}{2} = 10878
\]

Therefore, the sum of the first 147 positive integers is 10,878.

**Final Answer:**

The sum of the first 147 positive integers is 10,878.
