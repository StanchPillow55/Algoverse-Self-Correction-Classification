==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 147," we first need to understand what the problem is asking. However, the phrase "Sample math problem 147" does not provide specific details or context about the problem itself. It seems to be a placeholder or reference to a specific problem that is not fully described here.

Since the problem is not explicitly stated, I'll demonstrate how to approach a generic math problem using a hypothetical example. Let's assume "Sample math problem 147" is a simple arithmetic problem:

**Hypothetical Problem:**
Calculate the sum of 147 and 258.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We need to find the sum of two numbers: 147 and 258.

2. **Set Up the Calculation:**
   - Write the numbers vertically, aligning them by their place values (units, tens, hundreds).

   ```
     147
   + 258
   ------
   ```

3. **Add the Units Place:**
   - Add the digits in the units place: 7 (from 147) + 8 (from 258) = 15.
   - Write down 5 in the units place of the result and carry over 1 to the tens place.

4. **Add the Tens Place:**
   - Add the digits in the tens place, including the carry-over: 4 (from 147) + 5 (from 258) + 1 (carry-over) = 10.
   - Write down 0 in the tens place of the result and carry over 1 to the hundreds place.

5. **Add the Hundreds Place:**
   - Add the digits in the hundreds place, including the carry-over: 1 (from 147) + 2 (from 258) + 1 (carry-over) = 4.
   - Write down 4 in the hundreds place of the result.

6. **Write the Final Result:**
   - Combine the results from each place value to get the final sum.

   ```
     147
   + 258
   ------
     405
   ```

**Final Answer:**
The sum of 147 and 258 is 405.

This example demonstrates a structured approach to solving a basic arithmetic problem. If you have a specific "Sample math problem 147" in mind, please provide the details, and I can work through that specific problem for you.
