Question ID: mathbench_147
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample math problem 147" refers to. Since the problem itself is not explicitly stated, I'll assume it involves a typical math problem that could be labeled as such. Let's consider a common type of math problem that might be labeled with a number like 147, such as a basic arithmetic or algebra problem.

Let's assume "Sample math problem 147" is an algebraic equation problem. Here's a hypothetical problem:

**Problem:**
Solve for \( x \) in the equation:
\[ 3x + 5 = 14 \]

**Step-by-step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Equation:**
   The equation given is \( 3x + 5 = 14 \). Our goal is to solve for \( x \).

2. **Isolate the Variable:**
   To solve for \( x \), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We start by eliminating the constant term on the left side of the equation.

3. **Subtract 5 from Both Sides:**
   \[
   3x + 5 - 5 = 14 - 5
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   3x = 9
   \]

4. **Divide by the Coefficient of \( x \):**
   The next step is to divide both sides of the equation by the coefficient of \( x \), which is 3.
   \[
   \frac{3x}{3} = \frac{9}{3}
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   x = 3
   \]

5. **Verify the Solution:**
   To ensure our solution is correct, we substitute \( x = 3 \) back into the original equation:
   \[
   3(3) + 5 = 14
   \]
   Simplifying the left side:
   \[
   9 + 5 = 14
   \]
   \[
   14 = 14
   \]
   Since both sides of the equation are equal, our solution is verified.

**Final Answer:**
The solution to the equation \( 3x + 5 = 14 \) is \( x = 3 \).
