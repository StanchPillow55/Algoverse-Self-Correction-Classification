==================================================

To solve the problem, we first need to understand what "Sample reasoning question 428" refers to. Since the problem statement is not specific, I'll assume it's a generic math problem. Let's create a hypothetical problem and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**

A company sells two types of products: Product A and Product B. The company sells Product A for $50 each and Product B for $30 each. Last month, the company sold a total of 200 products and made $7,000 in revenue. How many of each product did the company sell?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( x \) be the number of Product A sold.
   - Let \( y \) be the number of Product B sold.

2. **Set Up Equations:**
   - We know the total number of products sold is 200:
     \[
     x + y = 200
     \]
   - We also know the total revenue is $7,000:
     \[
     50x + 30y = 7000
     \]

3. **Solve the System of Equations:**

   We have two equations:
   \[
   \begin{align*}
   1) & \quad x + y = 200 \\
   2) & \quad 50x + 30y = 7000
   \end{align*}
   \]

   **Substitution or Elimination Method:**

   Let's use the substitution method. From equation (1), express \( y \) in terms of \( x \):
   \[
   y = 200 - x
   \]

   Substitute \( y = 200 - x \) into equation (2):
   \[
   50x + 30(200 - x) = 7000
   \]

   Simplify and solve for \( x \):
   \[
   50x + 6000 - 30x = 7000
   \]
   \[
   20x + 6000 = 7000
   \]
   \[
   20x = 1000
   \]
   \[
   x = 50
   \]

   Now, substitute \( x = 50 \) back into the equation for \( y \):
   \[
   y = 200 - 50 = 150
   \]

4. **Verify the Solution:**

   Check if these values satisfy both original equations:
   - Total products: \( x + y = 50 + 150 = 200 \) (Correct)
   - Total revenue: \( 50x + 30y = 50(50) + 30(150) = 2500 + 4500 = 7000 \) (Correct)

Both conditions are satisfied, so the solution is correct.

**Final Answer:**

The company sold 50 units of Product A and 150 units of Product B.
