==================================================

To solve this problem, let's first clarify what "Sample reasoning question 428" might entail. Since the problem isn't explicitly stated, I'll assume it's a generic math problem that requires logical reasoning and step-by-step calculations. I'll create a hypothetical problem and solve it accordingly.

**Hypothetical Problem:**

A company produces two types of widgets: Type A and Type B. The production cost for Type A is $5 per widget, and for Type B, it's $8 per widget. The company sells Type A widgets for $10 each and Type B widgets for $15 each. Last month, the company sold a total of 500 widgets and made a total revenue of $6,500. How many of each type of widget did the company sell?

**Solution:**

Let's define:
- \( x \) as the number of Type A widgets sold.
- \( y \) as the number of Type B widgets sold.

We have two key pieces of information:
1. The total number of widgets sold is 500.
2. The total revenue from selling these widgets is $6,500.

From the first piece of information, we can write the equation:
\[ x + y = 500 \]

From the second piece of information, considering the revenue from each type of widget, we can write:
\[ 10x + 15y = 6500 \]

Now, we have a system of linear equations:
1. \( x + y = 500 \)
2. \( 10x + 15y = 6500 \)

Let's solve this system using the substitution or elimination method. I'll use the substitution method.

From the first equation, solve for \( y \):
\[ y = 500 - x \]

Substitute \( y = 500 - x \) into the second equation:
\[ 10x + 15(500 - x) = 6500 \]

Distribute the 15:
\[ 10x + 7500 - 15x = 6500 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ -5x + 7500 = 6500 \]

Subtract 7500 from both sides:
\[ -5x = 6500 - 7500 \]
\[ -5x = -1000 \]

Divide both sides by -5:
\[ x = 200 \]

Now that we have \( x = 200 \), substitute it back into the equation for \( y \):
\[ y = 500 - x \]
\[ y = 500 - 200 \]
\[ y = 300 \]

Thus, the company sold 200 Type A widgets and 300 Type B widgets.

**Final Answer:**
The company sold 200 Type A widgets and 300 Type B widgets.
