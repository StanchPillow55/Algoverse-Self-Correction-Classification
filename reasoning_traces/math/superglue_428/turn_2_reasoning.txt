==================================================

To solve the problem, I need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 428" refers to. However, since there is no specific math problem provided in the text, I'll create a hypothetical math problem and solve it step by step.

Let's assume the problem is as follows:

**Problem:**
A store sells apples at $2 each and oranges at $3 each. If a customer buys a total of 10 fruits consisting of apples and oranges and spends a total of $25, how many apples and how many oranges did the customer buy?

**Solution:**

To solve this problem, we can set up a system of equations based on the information given.

1. **Define the variables:**
   - Let \( a \) be the number of apples.
   - Let \( o \) be the number of oranges.

2. **Set up the equations:**
   - The total number of fruits is 10: 
     \[
     a + o = 10
     \]
   - The total cost is $25:
     \[
     2a + 3o = 25
     \]

3. **Solve the system of equations:**

   We can use the substitution or elimination method. Here, I'll use the substitution method.

   From the first equation, solve for \( a \):
   \[
   a = 10 - o
   \]

   Substitute \( a = 10 - o \) into the second equation:
   \[
   2(10 - o) + 3o = 25
   \]

   Simplify and solve for \( o \):
   \[
   20 - 2o + 3o = 25
   \]
   \[
   20 + o = 25
   \]
   \[
   o = 25 - 20
   \]
   \[
   o = 5
   \]

   Now that we have \( o = 5 \), substitute back to find \( a \):
   \[
   a = 10 - o = 10 - 5 = 5
   \]

4. **Verify the solution:**

   Check the total number of fruits:
   \[
   a + o = 5 + 5 = 10
   \]

   Check the total cost:
   \[
   2a + 3o = 2(5) + 3(5) = 10 + 15 = 25
   \]

Both conditions are satisfied, so the solution is correct.

**Final Answer:**
The customer bought 5 apples and 5 oranges.
