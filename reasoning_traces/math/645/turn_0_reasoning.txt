To determine the total amount of flour in three bags before it was divided into portions, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total amount of flour in one bag**:
   - We know that one bag of flour is divided into 8 portions, with each portion weighing 2 kilograms.
   - Therefore, the total weight of flour in one bag can be calculated by multiplying the number of portions by the weight of each portion:
     \[
     \text{Total weight in one bag} = \text{Number of portions} \times \text{Weight of each portion}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total weight in one bag} = 8 \times 2 \text{ kg} = 16 \text{ kg}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total amount of flour in three bags**:
   - Now that we know the weight of one bag, we can find the total weight of three bags by multiplying the weight of one bag by 3:
     \[
     \text{Total weight in three bags} = \text{Weight of one bag} \times 3
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total weight in three bags} = 16 \text{ kg} \times 3 = 48 \text{ kg}
     \]

3. **Final answer**:
   - Therefore, the total amount of flour in three bags before it was divided into portions is:
     \[
     \boxed{48} \text{ kg}
     \]
