   - Include units if applicable.

### Example Problem and Solution

Let's create a sample problem and solve it using the above strategy:

**Problem:**
A farmer has a rectangular field that is 100 meters long and 50 meters wide. He wants to build a fence around the entire field. How much fencing material does he need?

**Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We need to find the perimeter of the rectangular field to determine how much fencing material is required.

2. **Plan Your Approach:**
   - The formula for the perimeter \( P \) of a rectangle is \( P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width}) \).

3. **Execute the Plan:**
   - Length of the field = 100 meters
   - Width of the field = 50 meters
   - Calculate the perimeter:
     \[
     P = 2 \times (100 + 50) = 2 \times 150 = 300 \text{ meters}
     \]

4. **Review and Verify:**
   - Double-check the calculation:
     \[
     2 \times 150 = 300
     \]
   - The calculation is correct, and the units are consistent.

5. **State the Final Answer:**
   - The farmer needs 300 meters of fencing material.
