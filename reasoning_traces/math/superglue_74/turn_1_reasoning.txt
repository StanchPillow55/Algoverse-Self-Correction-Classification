==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 74" entails. However, since the problem statement is not provided, I'll demonstrate a general approach to solving a typical math reasoning problem. Let's assume a hypothetical problem and solve it step-by-step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**

"Suppose you have a sequence of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding numbers, starting with 1 and 1. What is the 10th number in this sequence?"

This is a classic Fibonacci sequence problem. The Fibonacci sequence is defined as follows:
- \( F_1 = 1 \)
- \( F_2 = 1 \)
- \( F_n = F_{n-1} + F_{n-2} \) for \( n > 2 \)

**Step-by-step Solution:**

1. **Identify the Base Cases:**
   - \( F_1 = 1 \)
   - \( F_2 = 1 \)

2. **Calculate Subsequent Terms:**
   - \( F_3 = F_2 + F_1 = 1 + 1 = 2 \)
   - \( F_4 = F_3 + F_2 = 2 + 1 = 3 \)
   - \( F_5 = F_4 + F_3 = 3 + 2 = 5 \)
   - \( F_6 = F_5 + F_4 = 5 + 3 = 8 \)
   - \( F_7 = F_6 + F_5 = 8 + 5 = 13 \)
   - \( F_8 = F_7 + F_6 = 13 + 8 = 21 \)
   - \( F_9 = F_8 + F_7 = 21 + 13 = 34 \)
   - \( F_{10} = F_9 + F_8 = 34 + 21 = 55 \)

3. **Conclusion:**
   - The 10th number in the Fibonacci sequence is 55.

**Final Answer:**
The 10th number in the sequence is 55.

This approach demonstrates how to solve a problem by breaking it down into smaller, manageable steps and using a systematic method to find the solution. If you have a specific problem or need further assistance, please provide more details, and I'll be happy to help!
