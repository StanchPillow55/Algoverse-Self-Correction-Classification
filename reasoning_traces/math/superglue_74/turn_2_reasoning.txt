==================================================

To solve the problem, I need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 74" refers to. Since I don't have access to external databases or specific documents, I'll assume this is a hypothetical math problem. Without specific details, I'll create a sample math problem and solve it step by step.

**Sample Problem:**

A company produces two types of widgets: Type A and Type B. The profit from each Type A widget is $5, and the profit from each Type B widget is $7. The company can produce a maximum of 100 widgets per day due to resource constraints. Additionally, the company has a contract that requires it to produce at least 20 Type A widgets per day. How many of each type of widget should the company produce to maximize its profit?

**Solution:**

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( x \) be the number of Type A widgets produced per day.
   - Let \( y \) be the number of Type B widgets produced per day.

2. **Set Up the Objective Function:**
   - The profit function \( P \) is given by:
     \[
     P = 5x + 7y
     \]
   - We want to maximize \( P \).

3. **Set Up the Constraints:**
   - The total number of widgets produced per day cannot exceed 100:
     \[
     x + y \leq 100
     \]
   - At least 20 Type A widgets must be produced per day:
     \[
     x \geq 20
     \]
   - Non-negativity constraints:
     \[
     x \geq 0, \quad y \geq 0
     \]

4. **Graph the Constraints:**
   - Plot the line \( x + y = 100 \).
   - Plot the line \( x = 20 \).
   - Identify the feasible region that satisfies all constraints.

5. **Identify Corner Points:**
   - The corner points of the feasible region are where the constraints intersect. These points are:
     - \( (20, 80) \) from \( x = 20 \) and \( x + y = 100 \)
     - \( (20, 0) \) from \( x = 20 \) and \( y = 0 \)
     - \( (100, 0) \) from \( x + y = 100 \) and \( y = 0 \)

6. **Evaluate the Objective Function at Each Corner Point:**
   - At \( (20, 80) \):
     \[
     P = 5(20) + 7(80) = 100 + 560 = 660
     \]
   - At \( (20, 0) \):
     \[
     P = 5(20) + 7(0) = 100
     \]
   - At \( (100, 0) \):
     \[
     P = 5(100) + 7(0) = 500
     \]

7. **Determine the Maximum Profit:**
   - The maximum profit of 660 occurs at the point \( (20, 80) \).

**Final Answer:**
To maximize profit, the company should produce 20 Type A widgets and 80 Type B widgets per day. The maximum profit is $660.
