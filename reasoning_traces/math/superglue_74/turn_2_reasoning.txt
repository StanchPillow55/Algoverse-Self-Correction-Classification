==================================================

To solve the problem effectively, I need to understand the context and details of "Sample reasoning question 74." However, since the problem statement is not provided, I'll demonstrate a general approach to solving a typical math reasoning problem. Let's assume a sample problem and work through it step by step.

**Sample Problem:**

A train travels from City A to City B, a distance of 300 miles. The train travels the first 100 miles at a speed of 50 miles per hour, the next 100 miles at a speed of 60 miles per hour, and the final 100 miles at a speed of 75 miles per hour. What is the average speed of the train for the entire trip?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We need to find the average speed of the train over the entire 300-mile journey.
   - The journey is divided into three segments, each with different speeds.

2. **Calculate the Time for Each Segment:**
   - **First Segment:** Distance = 100 miles, Speed = 50 mph
     \[
     \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{100 \text{ miles}}{50 \text{ mph}} = 2 \text{ hours}
     \]
   - **Second Segment:** Distance = 100 miles, Speed = 60 mph
     \[
     \text{Time} = \frac{100 \text{ miles}}{60 \text{ mph}} = \frac{5}{3} \text{ hours} \approx 1.67 \text{ hours}
     \]
   - **Third Segment:** Distance = 100 miles, Speed = 75 mph
     \[
     \text{Time} = \frac{100 \text{ miles}}{75 \text{ mph}} = \frac{4}{3} \text{ hours} \approx 1.33 \text{ hours}
     \]

3. **Calculate the Total Time:**
   \[
   \text{Total Time} = 2 \text{ hours} + \frac{5}{3} \text{ hours} + \frac{4}{3} \text{ hours} = 2 + \frac{5}{3} + \frac{4}{3}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total Time} = 2 + \frac{9}{3} = 2 + 3 = 5 \text{ hours}
   \]

4. **Calculate the Average Speed:**
   - The total distance is 300 miles.
   - The total time is 5 hours.
   \[
   \text{Average Speed} = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Total Time}} = \frac{300 \text{ miles}}{5 \text{ hours}} = 60 \text{ mph}
   \]

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The average speed of the train for the entire trip is 60 miles per hour.

**Final Answer:**
The average speed of the train for the entire trip is 60 mph.
