To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total time it takes for Nurse Missy to serve dinner to all of her patients, taking into account the increased serving time for patients with special dietary requirements.

1. **Determine the number of patients with special dietary requirements:**

   Missy has a total of 12 patients. One-third of these patients have special dietary requirements. To find the number of patients with special dietary requirements, we calculate:

   \[
   \frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4
   \]

   So, 4 patients have special dietary requirements.

2. **Determine the number of standard care patients:**

   Since 4 patients have special dietary requirements, the remaining patients receive standard care. Therefore, the number of standard care patients is:

   \[
   12 - 4 = 8
   \]

3. **Calculate the serving time for standard care patients:**

   It takes 5 minutes to serve each standard care patient. With 8 standard care patients, the total serving time for these patients is:

   \[
   8 \times 5 = 40 \text{ minutes}
   \]

4. **Calculate the serving time for patients with special dietary requirements:**

   Serving a patient with special dietary requirements takes 20% longer than serving a standard care patient. The serving time for each of these patients is:

   \[
   5 \text{ minutes} + 0.20 \times 5 \text{ minutes} = 5 \text{ minutes} + 1 \text{ minute} = 6 \text{ minutes}
   \]

   With 4 patients having special dietary requirements, the total serving time for these patients is:

   \[
   4 \times 6 = 24 \text{ minutes}
   \]

5. **Calculate the total serving time for all patients:**

   To find the total time Missy spends serving all patients, we add the time spent on standard care patients and the time spent on patients with special dietary requirements:

   \[
   40 \text{ minutes} + 24 \text{ minutes} = 64 \text{ minutes}
   \]

Thus, the total time it takes for Missy to serve dinner to all of her patients is \(\boxed{64}\) minutes.
