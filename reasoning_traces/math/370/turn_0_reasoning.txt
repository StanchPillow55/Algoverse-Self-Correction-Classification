To solve the problem, we need to determine how long it takes Nurse Missy to serve dinner to all 12 patients, considering that one-third of them have special dietary requirements that increase the serving time.

### Step 1: Determine the number of patients with special dietary requirements

We know that there are 12 patients in total. According to the problem, one-third of these patients have special dietary requirements.

\[
\text{Number of patients with special dietary requirements} = \frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4
\]

### Step 2: Determine the number of standard care patients

To find the number of patients who require standard care, we subtract the number of patients with special dietary requirements from the total number of patients.

\[
\text{Number of standard care patients} = 12 - 4 = 8
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the serving time for standard care patients

Each standard care patient takes 5 minutes to serve. Therefore, the total time to serve all standard care patients is:

\[
\text{Total time for standard care patients} = 8 \text{ patients} \times 5 \text{ minutes/patient} = 40 \text{ minutes}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the serving time for patients with special dietary requirements

For the patients with special dietary requirements, the serving time is increased by 20%. First, we need to calculate the new serving time for these patients.

The original serving time for each patient is 5 minutes. The increase in time due to special dietary requirements is:

\[
\text{Increase in time} = 20\% \text{ of } 5 \text{ minutes} = 0.20 \times 5 = 1 \text{ minute}
\]

Thus, the new serving time for each patient with special dietary requirements is:

\[
\text{New serving time} = 5 \text{ minutes} + 1 \text{ minute} = 6 \text{ minutes}
\]

Now, we calculate the total time to serve all patients with special dietary requirements:

\[
\text{Total time for special dietary patients} = 4 \text{ patients} \times 6 \text{ minutes/patient} = 24 \text{ minutes}
\]

### Step 5: Calculate the total serving time for all patients

Finally, we add the total serving time for standard care patients and the total serving time for patients with special dietary requirements:

\[
\text{Total serving time} = \text{Total time for standard care patients} + \text{Total time for special dietary patients}
\]

\[
\text{Total serving time} = 40 \text{ minutes} + 24 \text{ minutes} = 64 \text{ minutes}
\]

### Final Answer

The total time it takes for Nurse Missy to serve dinner to all of her patients is:

\[
\boxed{64} \text{ minutes}
\]
