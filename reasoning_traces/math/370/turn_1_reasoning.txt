Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine how long it takes Nurse Missy to serve dinner to all of her patients, considering that some patients have special dietary requirements that increase the serving time.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Determine the Total Number of Patients:**
   - Nurse Missy is attending to 12 patients in total.

2. **Identify the Number of Patients with Special Dietary Requirements:**
   - One-third of her patients have special dietary requirements.
   - Calculate one-third of 12:
     \[
     \frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4
     \]
   - Therefore, 4 patients have special dietary requirements.

3. **Determine the Number of Standard Care Patients:**
   - Subtract the number of patients with special dietary requirements from the total number of patients:
     \[
     12 - 4 = 8
     \]
   - So, 8 patients require standard care.

4. **Calculate the Serving Time for Standard Care Patients:**
   - It takes 5 minutes to serve each standard care patient.
   - Total time for standard care patients:
     \[
     8 \times 5 = 40 \text{ minutes}
     \]

5. **Calculate the Serving Time for Patients with Special Dietary Requirements:**
   - Serving time for these patients is increased by 20%.
   - Standard serving time per patient is 5 minutes.
   - Increased serving time per patient:
     \[
     5 + (0.20 \times 5) = 5 + 1 = 6 \text{ minutes}
     \]
   - Total time for patients with special dietary requirements:
     \[
     4 \times 6 = 24 \text{ minutes}
     \]

6. **Calculate the Total Serving Time:**
   - Add the total serving times for standard care patients and patients with special dietary requirements:
     \[
     40 + 24 = 64 \text{ minutes}
     \]

### Final Answer:
It takes Nurse Missy 64 minutes to serve dinner to all of her patients.
