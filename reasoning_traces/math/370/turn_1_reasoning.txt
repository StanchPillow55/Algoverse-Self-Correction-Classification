Question ID: 370
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to determine how long it takes Nurse Missy to serve dinner to all 12 patients, taking into account the different serving times for standard care patients and those with special dietary requirements.

### Step 1: Identify the number of patients with special dietary requirements

We know that one-third of the 12 patients have special dietary requirements. To find out how many patients this is, we calculate:

\[
\text{Number of patients with special dietary requirements} = \frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4
\]

### Step 2: Determine the number of standard care patients

Since there are 12 patients in total and 4 of them have special dietary requirements, the number of standard care patients is:

\[
\text{Number of standard care patients} = 12 - 4 = 8
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the serving time for standard care patients

It takes 5 minutes to serve each standard care patient. Therefore, the total time to serve all standard care patients is:

\[
\text{Total time for standard care patients} = 8 \text{ patients} \times 5 \text{ minutes/patient} = 40 \text{ minutes}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the serving time for patients with special dietary requirements

The serving time for patients with special dietary requirements is increased by 20%. First, we need to calculate the new serving time for these patients:

\[
\text{Increased serving time} = 5 \text{ minutes} + (0.20 \times 5 \text{ minutes}) = 5 \text{ minutes} + 1 \text{ minute} = 6 \text{ minutes}
\]

Now, we calculate the total time to serve all patients with special dietary requirements:

\[
\text{Total time for special dietary patients} = 4 \text{ patients} \times 6 \text{ minutes/patient} = 24 \text{ minutes}
\]

### Step 5: Calculate the total serving time for all patients

Now we can find the total time it takes for Nurse Missy to serve dinner to all patients by adding the time for standard care patients and the time for patients with special dietary requirements:

\[
\text{Total serving time} = \text{Total time for standard care patients} + \text{Total time for special dietary patients}
\]

\[
\text{Total serving time} = 40 \text{ minutes} + 24 \text{ minutes} = 64 \text{ minutes}
\]

### Final Answer

Thus, the total time it takes for Missy to serve dinner to all of her patients is:

\[
\boxed{64} \text{ minutes}
\]
