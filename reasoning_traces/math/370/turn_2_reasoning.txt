Question ID: 370
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we will break it down into steps and calculate the total time it takes for Nurse Missy to serve dinner to all her patients.

### Step 1: Determine the number of patients with special dietary requirements.

Missy has a total of 12 patients. According to the problem, one-third of her patients have special dietary requirements.

\[
\text{Number of patients with special dietary requirements} = \frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4
\]

### Step 2: Determine the number of standard care patients.

To find the number of patients who require standard care, we subtract the number of patients with special dietary requirements from the total number of patients.

\[
\text{Number of standard care patients} = 12 - 4 = 8
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the serving time for standard care patients.

It takes Missy 5 minutes to serve each standard care patient. Therefore, the total time to serve all standard care patients is:

\[
\text{Total time for standard care patients} = \text{Number of standard care patients} \times \text{Time per standard care patient}
\]
\[
= 8 \times 5 = 40 \text{ minutes}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the serving time for patients with special dietary requirements.

The problem states that serving time for patients with special dietary requirements increases by 20%. First, we need to calculate the increased serving time.

\[
\text{Increased time per special care patient} = 5 \text{ minutes} + (0.20 \times 5 \text{ minutes}) = 5 + 1 = 6 \text{ minutes}
\]

Now, we calculate the total time to serve all patients with special dietary requirements:

\[
\text{Total time for special care patients} = \text{Number of special care patients} \times \text{Increased time per special care patient}
\]
\[
= 4 \times 6 = 24 \text{ minutes}
\]

### Step 5: Calculate the total serving time for all patients.

Now, we add the total time for standard care patients and the total time for special care patients to find the overall time Missy takes to serve dinner to all her patients.

\[
\text{Total serving time} = \text{Total time for standard care patients} + \text{Total time for special care patients}
\]
\[
= 40 \text{ minutes} + 24 \text{ minutes} = 64 \text{ minutes}
\]

### Final Answer

The total time it takes for Nurse Missy to serve dinner to all of her patients is:

\[
\boxed{64} \text{ minutes}
\]
