Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine how long it takes for Nurse Missy to serve dinner to all of her patients, considering that some patients have special dietary requirements that increase the serving time.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Determine the number of patients with special dietary requirements:**
   - Missy has 12 patients in total.
   - One-third of her patients have special dietary requirements.
   - To find the number of patients with special dietary requirements, we calculate:
     \[
     \frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4
     \]
   - Therefore, 4 patients have special dietary requirements.

2. **Determine the number of standard care patients:**
   - Since 4 patients have special dietary requirements, the remaining patients receive standard care.
   - The number of standard care patients is:
     \[
     12 - 4 = 8
     \]

3. **Calculate the serving time for standard care patients:**
   - It takes 5 minutes to serve each standard care patient.
   - For 8 standard care patients, the total serving time is:
     \[
     8 \times 5 = 40 \text{ minutes}
     \]

4. **Calculate the serving time for patients with special dietary requirements:**
   - Serving time for these patients is increased by 20%.
   - The standard serving time is 5 minutes, so the increased serving time is:
     \[
     5 + (0.20 \times 5) = 5 + 1 = 6 \text{ minutes per patient}
     \]
   - For 4 patients with special dietary requirements, the total serving time is:
     \[
     4 \times 6 = 24 \text{ minutes}
     \]

5. **Calculate the total serving time for all patients:**
   - Add the serving times for standard care patients and those with special dietary requirements:
     \[
     40 + 24 = 64 \text{ minutes}
     \]

Therefore, it takes Missy 64 minutes to serve dinner to all of her patients.

**Final Answer: 64 minutes**
