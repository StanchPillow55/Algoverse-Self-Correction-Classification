==================================================

To solve the problem, I need to first understand what "Sample math problem 260" refers to. Since I don't have access to external databases or specific problem sets labeled as "Sample math problem 260," I'll assume this is a placeholder for a specific math problem you have in mind. 

However, without the actual content of the problem, I can't provide a solution. If you can provide the details of the math problem, I would be happy to help solve it step by step. Please provide the problem statement, and I'll work through it with complete reasoning and calculations.
