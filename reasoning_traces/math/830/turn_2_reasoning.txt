Question ID: 830
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To find out how much time Britany spends on TikTok in a month, we need to calculate the time she spends on her videos, songwriting, and makeup each week, and then multiply that by the number of weeks in a month.

### Step 1: Calculate time spent on TikTok videos
Britany records 18 videos each week, and each video is 4 minutes long.

\[
\text{Time spent on videos per week} = 18 \text{ videos} \times 4 \text{ minutes/video} = 72 \text{ minutes}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate time spent on songwriting
Britany spends 2 hours a week writing songs. We need to convert this time into minutes.

\[
\text{Time spent on songwriting per week} = 2 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 120 \text{ minutes}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate time spent on makeup
Britany spends 15 minutes doing her makeup each day for 6 days a week.

\[
\text{Time spent on makeup per week} = 15 \text{ minutes/day} \times 6 \text{ days} = 90 \text{ minutes}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate total time spent per week
Now, we can sum the time spent on videos, songwriting, and makeup to find the total time spent on TikTok each week.

\[
\text{Total time per week} = \text{Time on videos} + \text{Time on songwriting} + \text{Time on makeup}
\]
\[
\text{Total time per week} = 72 \text{ minutes} + 120 \text{ minutes} + 90 \text{ minutes} = 282 \text{ minutes}
\]

### Step 5: Calculate total time spent in a month
Since there are 4 weeks in a month, we multiply the total time spent per week by 4.

\[
\text{Total time in a month} = 282 \text{ minutes/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 1128 \text{ minutes}
\]

### Final Answer
Britany spends a total of **1128 minutes** on TikTok in a month with four weeks.
