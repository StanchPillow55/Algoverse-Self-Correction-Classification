To find out how much time Britany spends on TikTok in a month with four weeks, we need to calculate the time she spends on filming videos, writing songs, and doing her makeup. Let's break it down step by step.

### Step 1: Calculate the time spent filming TikTok videos

Britany records 18 videos each week, and each video is 4 minutes long. 

**Time spent on videos per week:**
\[
\text{Time per video} = 4 \text{ minutes}
\]
\[
\text{Total videos per week} = 18
\]
\[
\text{Total time for videos per week} = 18 \text{ videos} \times 4 \text{ minutes/video} = 72 \text{ minutes}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the time spent writing songs

Britany spends 2 hours a week writing songs. We need to convert this time into minutes for consistency.

**Time spent writing songs per week:**
\[
\text{Time in hours} = 2 \text{ hours}
\]
\[
\text{Time in minutes} = 2 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 120 \text{ minutes}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the time spent on makeup

Britany spends 15 minutes doing her makeup six days a week.

**Time spent on makeup per week:**
\[
\text{Time per day} = 15 \text{ minutes}
\]
\[
\text{Days per week} = 6
\]
\[
\text{Total time for makeup per week} = 15 \text{ minutes/day} \times 6 \text{ days} = 90 \text{ minutes}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the total time spent per week

Now we can add up the time spent on videos, writing songs, and doing makeup to find the total time spent on TikTok activities in one week.

\[
\text{Total time per week} = \text{Time for videos} + \text{Time for songs} + \text{Time for makeup}
\]
\[
\text{Total time per week} = 72 \text{ minutes} + 120 \text{ minutes} + 90 \text{ minutes} = 282 \text{ minutes}
\]

### Step 5: Calculate the total time spent in a month

Since there are four weeks in a month, we multiply the total time spent per week by 4.

\[
\text{Total time in a month} = \text{Total time per week} \times 4
\]
\[
\text{Total time in a month} = 282 \text{ minutes/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 1128 \text{ minutes}
\]

### Final Answer

Britany spends a total of **1128 minutes** on TikTok in a month with four weeks. 

To convert this into hours and minutes for clarity:
\[
1128 \text{ minutes} \div 60 = 18 \text{ hours} \text{ and } 48 \text{ minutes}
\]

Thus, the final answer is:
**Britany spends 1128 minutes, or 18 hours and 48 minutes, on TikTok in a month.**
