==================================================

To find out how much time Britany spends on TikTok in a month with four weeks, we need to calculate the total time she spends on filming videos, writing songs, and doing her makeup each week, and then multiply that by four.

### Step 1: Calculate time spent filming TikTok videos
Britany records 18 TikTok videos each week, and each video is 4 minutes long.

\[
\text{Time spent on videos per week} = \text{Number of videos} \times \text{Time per video}
\]

\[
\text{Time spent on videos per week} = 18 \text{ videos} \times 4 \text{ minutes/video} = 72 \text{ minutes}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate time spent writing songs
Britany spends 2 hours a week writing songs. We need to convert this time into minutes for consistency.

\[
\text{Time spent writing songs per week} = 2 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 120 \text{ minutes}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate time spent doing makeup
Britany spends 15 minutes doing her makeup six days a week. First, we calculate the total time spent on makeup per week.

\[
\text{Time spent on makeup per week} = 15 \text{ minutes/day} \times 6 \text{ days} = 90 \text{ minutes}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate total time spent per week
Now we can sum up all the time spent on TikTok activities per week.

\[
\text{Total time per week} = \text{Time on videos} + \text{Time writing songs} + \text{Time on makeup}
\]

\[
\text{Total time per week} = 72 \text{ minutes} + 120 \text{ minutes} + 90 \text{ minutes} = 282 \text{ minutes}
\]

### Step 5: Calculate total time spent in a month
Since there are 4 weeks in a month, we multiply the total time spent per week by 4.

\[
\text{Total time in a month} = \text{Total time per week} \times 4
\]

\[
\text{Total time in a month} = 282 \text{ minutes/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 1128 \text{ minutes}
\]

### Final Answer
Britany spends a total of **1128 minutes** on TikTok in a month with four weeks. 

To convert this into hours and minutes for a clearer understanding:

\[
1128 \text{ minutes} \div 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 18 \text{ hours} \text{ and } 48 \text{ minutes}
\]

Thus, the final answer is that Britany spends **18 hours and 48 minutes** on TikTok in a month with four weeks.
