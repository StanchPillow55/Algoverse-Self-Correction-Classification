==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 228" refers to. However, since the problem statement is not provided, I'll demonstrate how to approach a typical reasoning problem step by step. Let's assume a hypothetical reasoning problem and solve it.

**Hypothetical Problem:**

A train travels from City A to City B at a speed of 60 km/h. After reaching City B, it immediately returns to City A at a speed of 90 km/h. If the total travel time for the round trip is 5 hours, what is the distance between City A and City B?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( d \) be the distance between City A and City B in kilometers.
   - The speed from City A to City B is 60 km/h.
   - The speed from City B to City A is 90 km/h.
   - The total travel time for the round trip is 5 hours.

2. **Set Up Equations:**
   - Time taken to travel from City A to City B: \( \frac{d}{60} \) hours.
   - Time taken to travel from City B to City A: \( \frac{d}{90} \) hours.
   - Total travel time for the round trip: \( \frac{d}{60} + \frac{d}{90} = 5 \).

3. **Solve the Equation:**
   - Find a common denominator for the fractions: The least common multiple of 60 and 90 is 180.
   - Rewrite the equation with a common denominator:
     \[
     \frac{3d}{180} + \frac{2d}{180} = 5
     \]
   - Combine the fractions:
     \[
     \frac{5d}{180} = 5
     \]
   - Multiply both sides by 180 to clear the fraction:
     \[
     5d = 900
     \]
   - Divide both sides by 5 to solve for \( d \):
     \[
     d = 180
     \]

4. **Verify the Solution:**
   - Calculate the time for each leg of the trip using \( d = 180 \) km:
     - Time from City A to City B: \( \frac{180}{60} = 3 \) hours.
     - Time from City B to City A: \( \frac{180}{90} = 2 \) hours.
   - Total time: \( 3 + 2 = 5 \) hours, which matches the given total travel time.

5. **Final Answer:**
   - The distance between City A and City B is 180 kilometers.

This step-by-step approach demonstrates how to solve a reasoning problem by defining variables, setting up equations, solving the equations, and verifying the solution.
