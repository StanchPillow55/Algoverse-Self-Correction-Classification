==================================================

To solve the problem effectively, I need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 228" entails. However, since the problem statement is not provided, I will demonstrate how to approach a generic math problem using a structured reasoning process. Let's consider a sample math problem and solve it step by step.

### Sample Problem:
**Problem Statement:**  
A farmer has a rectangular field that is 60 meters long and 40 meters wide. He wants to build a fence around the field and also divide the field into two equal smaller rectangles by adding a fence parallel to the shorter side. Calculate the total length of the fence required.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We have a rectangular field with dimensions 60 meters (length) and 40 meters (width).
   - We need to calculate the total length of the fence required to enclose the entire field and divide it into two equal smaller rectangles.

2. **Visualize the Problem:**
   - The field is a rectangle with a longer side of 60 meters and a shorter side of 40 meters.
   - To divide the field into two equal parts, a fence parallel to the shorter side (40 meters) will be added.

3. **Calculate the Perimeter of the Field:**
   - The perimeter \( P \) of a rectangle is given by the formula:
     \[
     P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width})
     \]
   - Substituting the given dimensions:
     \[
     P = 2 \times (60 + 40) = 2 \times 100 = 200 \text{ meters}
     \]

4. **Calculate the Additional Fence Required:**
   - To divide the field into two equal smaller rectangles, a fence parallel to the shorter side (40 meters) is required.
   - The length of this additional fence is equal to the length of the shorter side, which is 40 meters.

5. **Calculate the Total Length of the Fence:**
   - The total length of the fence required is the sum of the perimeter of the field and the additional fence:
     \[
     \text{Total Length} = \text{Perimeter} + \text{Additional Fence}
     \]
   - Substituting the values:
     \[
     \text{Total Length} = 200 + 40 = 240 \text{ meters}
     \]

6. **Conclusion:**
   - The total length of the fence required to enclose the field and divide it into two equal smaller rectangles is 240 meters.

### Final Answer:
The total length of the fence required is **240 meters**.

This structured approach ensures that each step is logically derived and clearly explained, leading to the correct solution. If you have a specific problem or need further assistance, please provide more details, and I'll be happy to help!
