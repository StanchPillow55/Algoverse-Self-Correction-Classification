==================================================

To solve the problem effectively, I need more specific information about "Sample reasoning question 228." Since the question itself isn't provided, I'll guide you through a general approach to solving a typical math problem, which you can adapt to your specific question once you have it.

### General Approach to Solving Math Problems

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - Read the problem carefully.
   - Identify what is being asked.
   - Determine what information is given and what needs to be found.

2. **Devise a Plan:**
   - Think about the strategies that could be used to solve the problem. This could include drawing a diagram, creating an equation, or breaking the problem into smaller parts.

3. **Carry Out the Plan:**
   - Execute the chosen strategy step by step.
   - Perform calculations carefully.
   - Keep track of units and ensure consistency.

4. **Review/Check the Solution:**
   - Verify each step of your work.
   - Check if the solution makes sense in the context of the problem.
   - Ensure that the final answer addresses the question asked.

### Example Problem and Solution

Let's consider a sample problem:

**Problem:**
A rectangle has a length that is twice its width. If the perimeter of the rectangle is 36 units, what are the dimensions of the rectangle?

**Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We need to find the length and width of the rectangle.
   - We know the perimeter is 36 units, and the length is twice the width.

2. **Devise a Plan:**
   - Use the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle: \( P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width}) \).
   - Let the width be \( w \).
   - Then the length is \( 2w \).

3. **Carry Out the Plan:**
   - Substitute the expressions for length and width into the perimeter formula:
     \[
     36 = 2 \times (2w + w)
     \]
   - Simplify and solve for \( w \):
     \[
     36 = 2 \times 3w
     \]
     \[
     36 = 6w
     \]
     \[
     w = \frac{36}{6} = 6
     \]
   - Find the length using the relationship \( \text{length} = 2w \):
     \[
     \text{length} = 2 \times 6 = 12
     \]

4. **Review/Check the Solution:**
   - Check the perimeter with the found dimensions:
     \[
     P = 2 \times (12 + 6) = 2 \times 18 = 36
     \]
   - The calculations are correct, and the solution makes sense.

**Final Answer:**
The dimensions of the rectangle are 12 units (length) and 6 units (width).
