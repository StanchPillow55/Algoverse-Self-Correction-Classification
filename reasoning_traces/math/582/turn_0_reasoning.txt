==================================================

To find the combined value of Juan's and Herb's houses, we will first determine the value of Juan's house based on the information provided.

1. **Determine the value of Herb's house**:
   - Herb's house is worth $76,000.

2. **Calculate the value of Juan's house**:
   - Juan's house is 30% less expensive than Herb's house.
   - First, we need to calculate 30% of Herb's house value:
     \[
     30\% \text{ of } 76,000 = 0.30 \times 76,000
     \]
     \[
     0.30 \times 76,000 = 22,800
     \]
   - Now, we subtract this amount from the value of Herb's house to find the value of Juan's house:
     \[
     \text{Value of Juan's house} = 76,000 - 22,800
     \]
     \[
     76,000 - 22,800 = 53,200
     \]

3. **Calculate the combined value of both houses**:
   - Now that we have the values of both houses, we can add them together:
     \[
     \text{Combined value} = \text{Value of Herb's house} + \text{Value of Juan's house}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Combined value} = 76,000 + 53,200
     \]
     \[
     76,000 + 53,200 = 129,200
     \]

4. **Final Answer**:
   - The combined value of Juan's and Herb's houses is \(\boxed{129200}\).
