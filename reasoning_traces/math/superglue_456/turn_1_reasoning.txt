Question ID: superglue_456
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what is being asked. The question is labeled as "Sample reasoning question 456," but it doesn't provide any specific details or numbers to work with. Therefore, we need to interpret this as a placeholder for a typical math problem that requires reasoning.

Since there is no specific problem provided, let's create a hypothetical math problem to demonstrate the process of reasoning through a problem step by step. We'll assume a simple algebra problem for illustration:

**Problem:** Solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).

**Step 1: Understand the Problem**
The equation given is \( 2x + 3 = 11 \). Our goal is to find the value of \( x \) that makes this equation true.

**Step 2: Isolate the Variable**
To solve for \( x \), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We start by eliminating the constant term on the left side.

Subtract 3 from both sides:
\[
2x + 3 - 3 = 11 - 3
\]
\[
2x = 8
\]

**Step 3: Solve for \( x \)**
Now that we have \( 2x = 8 \), we need to solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides by 2:
\[
\frac{2x}{2} = \frac{8}{2}
\]
\[
x = 4
\]

**Step 4: Verify the Solution**
To ensure our solution is correct, we substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation:
\[
2(4) + 3 = 11
\]
\[
8 + 3 = 11
\]
\[
11 = 11
\]
The left side equals the right side, confirming that our solution is correct.

**Final Answer**
The solution to the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \) is \( x = 4 \).

This example demonstrates the process of solving a simple algebraic equation by isolating the variable, solving for it, and verifying the solution. Since the original question did not specify a particular problem, this example serves as a demonstration of how to approach and solve a math problem with clear reasoning and steps.
