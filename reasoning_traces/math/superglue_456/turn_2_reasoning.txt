==================================================

To solve the problem, we first need to understand what "Sample reasoning question 456" entails. Since the problem statement is not clear, let's assume this is a placeholder for a specific math problem. For the sake of this exercise, let's create a hypothetical math problem and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**
Calculate the sum of all even numbers between 1 and 456.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Identify the Even Numbers:**
   - Even numbers are integers divisible by 2.
   - The smallest even number greater than 1 is 2.
   - The largest even number less than or equal to 456 is 456 itself.

2. **Formulate the Sequence:**
   - The sequence of even numbers between 1 and 456 is: 2, 4, 6, ..., 456.
   - This is an arithmetic sequence where the first term \( a_1 = 2 \) and the common difference \( d = 2 \).

3. **Determine the Number of Terms:**
   - The formula for the \( n \)-th term of an arithmetic sequence is given by:
     \[
     a_n = a_1 + (n-1) \cdot d
     \]
   - Setting \( a_n = 456 \), we solve for \( n \):
     \[
     456 = 2 + (n-1) \cdot 2
     \]
     \[
     456 = 2 + 2n - 2
     \]
     \[
     456 = 2n
     \]
     \[
     n = \frac{456}{2} = 228
     \]
   - There are 228 even numbers between 1 and 456.

4. **Calculate the Sum of the Sequence:**
   - The sum \( S_n \) of the first \( n \) terms of an arithmetic sequence is given by:
     \[
     S_n = \frac{n}{2} \cdot (a_1 + a_n)
     \]
   - Substituting the known values:
     \[
     S_{228} = \frac{228}{2} \cdot (2 + 456)
     \]
     \[
     S_{228} = 114 \cdot 458
     \]

5. **Perform the Multiplication:**
   - Calculate \( 114 \times 458 \):
     \[
     114 \times 458 = 114 \times (400 + 50 + 8)
     \]
     \[
     = 114 \times 400 + 114 \times 50 + 114 \times 8
     \]
     \[
     = 45600 + 5700 + 912
     \]
     \[
     = 52212
     \]

**Final Answer:**
The sum of all even numbers between 1 and 456 is 52,212.
