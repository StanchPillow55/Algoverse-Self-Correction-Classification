Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to carefully analyze the situation and set up equations based on the information given.

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( C \) be the number of clownfish.
   - Let \( B \) be the number of blowfish.

2. **Initial Conditions:**
   - The aquarium holds an equal number of clownfish and blowfish, so \( C = B \).
   - The total number of fish is 100, so \( C + B = 100 \).

3. **Solve for \( C \) and \( B \):**
   - Since \( C = B \), we can substitute \( B \) with \( C \) in the total equation:
     \[
     C + C = 100
     \]
   - Simplifying gives:
     \[
     2C = 100
     \]
   - Solving for \( C \) gives:
     \[
     C = 50
     \]
   - Therefore, \( B = 50 \) as well.

4. **Blowfish Distribution:**
   - 26 blowfish stay in their own tank, so the number of blowfish in the display tank is:
     \[
     B - 26 = 50 - 26 = 24
     \]

5. **Clownfish Distribution:**
   - An equal number of clownfish join the blowfish in the display tank, so initially, 24 clownfish join the display tank.
   - A third of these clownfish swim back to their own tank:
     \[
     \text{Number of clownfish that swim back} = \frac{1}{3} \times 24 = 8
     \]
   - Therefore, the number of clownfish remaining in the display tank is:
     \[
     24 - 8 = 16
     \]

6. **Final Answer:**
   - The number of clownfish now in the display tank is 16.

Thus, the final answer is \(\boxed{16}\).
