==================================================

Let \( x \) be the number of clownfish in the aquarium. Since the aquarium holds an equal number of clownfish and blowfish, there are also \( x \) blowfish.

The total number of fish in the aquarium is given as 100. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[
x + x = 100
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
2x = 100
\]

Dividing both sides by 2 gives:

\[
x = 50
\]

So, there are 50 clownfish and 50 blowfish in the aquarium.

Next, we know that 26 of the blowfish stay in their own tank. Therefore, the number of blowfish that swim into the display tank is:

\[
50 - 26 = 24
\]

Now, an equal number of clownfish join the blowfish in the display tank. Since 24 blowfish are in the display tank, 24 clownfish also swim into the display tank. Thus, the total number of clownfish in the display tank is:

\[
24
\]

Now, we need to account for the clownfish that swim back to their own tank. A third of the clownfish in the display tank swim back. The number of clownfish in the display tank is currently 24, so the number of clownfish that swim back is:

\[
\frac{1}{3} \times 24 = 8
\]

After 8 clownfish swim back to their own tank, the number of clownfish remaining in the display tank is:

\[
24 - 8 = 16
\]

Thus, the final number of clownfish in the display tank is:

\[
\boxed{16}
\]
