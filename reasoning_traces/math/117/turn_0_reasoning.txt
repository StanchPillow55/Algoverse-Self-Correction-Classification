To solve this problem, we need to determine how many clownfish are now in the display tank. Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( x \) be the number of clownfish in the aquarium.
   - Since the aquarium holds an equal number of clownfish and blowfish, there are also \( x \) blowfish.

2. **Total Number of Fish:**
   - The total number of fish in the aquarium is given as 100.
   - Therefore, we have the equation:
     \[
     x + x = 100
     \]
   - Simplifying, we find:
     \[
     2x = 100
     \]
   - Solving for \( x \), we divide both sides by 2:
     \[
     x = 50
     \]
   - So, there are 50 clownfish and 50 blowfish in the aquarium.

3. **Blowfish Distribution:**
   - 26 blowfish stay in their own tank.
   - Therefore, the number of blowfish that swim into the display tank is:
     \[
     50 - 26 = 24
     \]

4. **Clownfish Joining Blowfish:**
   - An equal number of clownfish join the blowfish in the display tank, so 24 clownfish join the blowfish.

5. **Clownfish Swimming Back:**
   - A third of these clownfish swim back into their own tank.
   - The number of clownfish that swim back is:
     \[
     \frac{1}{3} \times 24 = 8
     \]

6. **Clownfish Remaining in Display Tank:**
   - The number of clownfish that remain in the display tank is:
     \[
     24 - 8 = 16
     \]

Therefore, the number of clownfish now in the display tank is \(\boxed{16}\).
