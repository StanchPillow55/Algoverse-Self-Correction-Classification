To find out how much John paid for the shoes, we can break the problem down into several steps.

1. **Determine the number of pairs of shoes John bought:**
   - John has 3 children.
   - He buys 2 pairs of shoes for each child.
   - Therefore, the total number of pairs of shoes is calculated as follows:
     \[
     \text{Total pairs of shoes} = \text{Number of children} \times \text{Pairs per child} = 3 \times 2 = 6 \text{ pairs}
     \]

2. **Determine the cost of the shoes:**
   - Each pair of shoes costs $60.
   - To find the total cost, we multiply the number of pairs of shoes by the cost per pair:
     \[
     \text{Total cost} = \text{Total pairs of shoes} \times \text{Cost per pair} = 6 \times 60
     \]

3. **Calculate the total cost:**
   - Now we perform the multiplication:
     \[
     6 \times 60 = 360
     \]

Thus, John paid a total of $360 for the shoes.

**Final Answer:**
John paid $360.
