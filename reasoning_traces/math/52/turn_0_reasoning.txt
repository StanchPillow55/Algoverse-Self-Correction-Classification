==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to determine how many pencils are in each box that Arnel has.

1. **Define Variables**:
   Let \( x \) be the number of pencils in each box. Since Arnel has ten boxes, the total number of pencils he has is:
   \[
   10x
   \]

2. **Pencils Kept and Shared**:
   According to the problem, Arnel kept 10 pencils for himself. Therefore, the number of pencils left after he kept 10 is:
   \[
   10x - 10
   \]

3. **Sharing with Friends**:
   Arnel shares the remaining pencils equally with his five friends. This means he shares the remaining pencils among 6 people (Arnel and his 5 friends). Each friend receives 8 pencils, so the total number of pencils shared among the friends is:
   \[
   5 \times 8 = 40
   \]

4. **Setting Up the Equation**:
   Since the total number of pencils left after Arnel kept 10 is equal to the total number of pencils shared (which is 40), we can set up the equation:
   \[
   10x - 10 = 40
   \]

5. **Solving the Equation**:
   Now, we will solve for \( x \):
   \[
   10x - 10 = 40
   \]
   Add 10 to both sides:
   \[
   10x = 50
   \]
   Now, divide both sides by 10:
   \[
   x = 5
   \]

6. **Final Answer**:
   Therefore, the number of pencils in each box is:
   \[
   \boxed{5}
   \] 

This means that each of the ten boxes contains 5 pencils.
