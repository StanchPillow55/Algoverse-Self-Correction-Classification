==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to determine how many toys Uriah needs to remove after he removes 30 comic books in order to achieve a total weight reduction of 15 pounds from his book bag.

### Step 1: Calculate the weight of the comic books removed
Each comic book weighs \( \frac{1}{4} \) pound. If Uriah removes 30 comic books, we can calculate the total weight of the comic books removed as follows:

\[
\text{Weight of comic books removed} = \text{Number of comic books} \times \text{Weight per comic book}
\]
\[
\text{Weight of comic books removed} = 30 \times \frac{1}{4} = \frac{30}{4} = 7.5 \text{ pounds}
\]

### Step 2: Determine the remaining weight to be removed
Uriah needs to remove a total of 15 pounds. After removing the comic books, we need to find out how much more weight he needs to remove:

\[
\text{Remaining weight to remove} = \text{Total weight to remove} - \text{Weight of comic books removed}
\]
\[
\text{Remaining weight to remove} = 15 - 7.5 = 7.5 \text{ pounds}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the number of toys to remove
Each toy weighs \( \frac{1}{2} \) pound. We need to find out how many toys Uriah needs to remove to achieve the remaining weight reduction of 7.5 pounds. We can set up the equation:

\[
\text{Weight of toys removed} = \text{Number of toys} \times \text{Weight per toy}
\]
Let \( x \) be the number of toys Uriah needs to remove. Then:

\[
\frac{1}{2}x = 7.5
\]

### Step 4: Solve for \( x \)
To find \( x \), we can multiply both sides of the equation by 2:

\[
x = 7.5 \times 2 = 15
\]

### Final Answer
Uriah needs to remove **15 toys** to achieve a total weight reduction of 15 pounds from his book bag.
