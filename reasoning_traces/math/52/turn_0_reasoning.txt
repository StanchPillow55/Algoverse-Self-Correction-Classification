Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

Arnel gave away a total of 5 friends * 8 pencils each = <<5*8=40>>40 pencils.

So, Arnel had 10 pencils + 40 pencils = <<10+40=50>>50 pencils in total.

Since he had 10 boxes of pencils, each box contained 50 pencils / 10 boxes = <<50/10=5>>5 pencils.

Therefore, each box contained 5 pencils.
