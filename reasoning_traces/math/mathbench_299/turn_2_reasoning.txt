==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 299," we first need to understand what the problem is asking. However, the problem statement "Sample math problem 299" is not specific and does not provide any details about the mathematical problem to be solved. Therefore, I will demonstrate how to approach a typical math problem by creating a hypothetical problem and solving it step by step.

Let's assume "Sample math problem 299" is a problem involving solving a quadratic equation. Here's a hypothetical problem:

**Problem:** Solve the quadratic equation \(2x^2 - 4x - 6 = 0\).

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Identify the quadratic equation:**
   The given equation is \(2x^2 - 4x - 6 = 0\).

2. **Write the equation in standard form:**
   The standard form of a quadratic equation is \(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\).
   Here, \(a = 2\), \(b = -4\), and \(c = -6\).

3. **Calculate the discriminant:**
   The discriminant \(\Delta\) of a quadratic equation \(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\) is given by:
   \[
   \Delta = b^2 - 4ac
   \]
   Substituting the values of \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\):
   \[
   \Delta = (-4)^2 - 4 \times 2 \times (-6) = 16 + 48 = 64
   \]

4. **Determine the nature of the roots:**
   Since the discriminant \(\Delta = 64\) is positive, the quadratic equation has two distinct real roots.

5. **Use the quadratic formula to find the roots:**
   The quadratic formula is:
   \[
   x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{\Delta}}{2a}
   \]
   Substituting the values of \(a\), \(b\), and \(\Delta\):
   \[
   x = \frac{-(-4) \pm \sqrt{64}}{2 \times 2} = \frac{4 \pm 8}{4}
   \]

6. **Calculate the two roots:**
   - For the positive square root:
     \[
     x_1 = \frac{4 + 8}{4} = \frac{12}{4} = 3
     \]
   - For the negative square root:
     \[
     x_2 = \frac{4 - 8}{4} = \frac{-4}{4} = -1
     \]

### Final Answer:
The solutions to the quadratic equation \(2x^2 - 4x - 6 = 0\) are \(x = 3\) and \(x = -1\).

This is a complete solution to the hypothetical problem based on the assumption that "Sample math problem 299" involves solving a quadratic equation. If you have a specific math problem you would like me to solve, please provide the details, and I will be happy to assist you.
