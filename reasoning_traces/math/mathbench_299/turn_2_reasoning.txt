Question ID: mathbench_299
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we first need to understand what "Sample math problem 299" refers to. Since no specific details about the problem are provided, I will create a hypothetical math problem and solve it step by step. Let's assume "Sample math problem 299" is a problem involving algebraic equations.

**Hypothetical Problem:**

Solve the following system of equations for \(x\) and \(y\):

1. \(2x + 3y = 12\)
2. \(x - y = 3\)

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

**Step 1: Solve one of the equations for one variable.**

Let's solve the second equation for \(x\):

\[ x - y = 3 \]

Add \(y\) to both sides:

\[ x = y + 3 \]

**Step 2: Substitute the expression for \(x\) into the first equation.**

Substitute \(x = y + 3\) into the first equation:

\[ 2(y + 3) + 3y = 12 \]

**Step 3: Simplify and solve for \(y\).**

Distribute the 2:

\[ 2y + 6 + 3y = 12 \]

Combine like terms:

\[ 5y + 6 = 12 \]

Subtract 6 from both sides:

\[ 5y = 6 \]

Divide by 5:

\[ y = \frac{6}{5} \]

**Step 4: Substitute back to find \(x\).**

Use the expression \(x = y + 3\) with \(y = \frac{6}{5}\):

\[ x = \frac{6}{5} + 3 \]

Convert 3 to a fraction with a denominator of 5:

\[ x = \frac{6}{5} + \frac{15}{5} \]

Add the fractions:

\[ x = \frac{21}{5} \]

**Step 5: State the solution.**

The solution to the system of equations is:

\[ x = \frac{21}{5}, \quad y = \frac{6}{5} \]

**Final Answer:**

The values of \(x\) and \(y\) that satisfy both equations are \(x = \frac{21}{5}\) and \(y = \frac{6}{5}\).
