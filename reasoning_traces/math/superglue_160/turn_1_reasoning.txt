==================================================

To solve the problem, we first need to understand what "Sample reasoning question 160" refers to. Since the problem statement doesn't provide any specific details or context, I'll assume that this is a placeholder for a typical math problem. Let's create a hypothetical math problem and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**

A company produces two types of widgets: Type A and Type B. The company sells Type A widgets for $50 each and Type B widgets for $70 each. In one month, the company sold a total of 300 widgets and earned $18,000 in revenue. How many Type A and Type B widgets did the company sell?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( x \) be the number of Type A widgets sold.
   - Let \( y \) be the number of Type B widgets sold.

2. **Set Up Equations:**
   - From the problem, we know the total number of widgets sold is 300. Therefore, we have the equation:
     \[
     x + y = 300
     \]
   - We also know the total revenue is $18,000. The revenue from Type A widgets is \( 50x \) and from Type B widgets is \( 70y \). Therefore, we have the equation:
     \[
     50x + 70y = 18000
     \]

3. **Solve the System of Equations:**
   - We have the system of equations:
     \[
     \begin{align*}
     x + y &= 300 \\
     50x + 70y &= 18000
     \end{align*}
     \]

   - Solve the first equation for \( y \):
     \[
     y = 300 - x
     \]

   - Substitute \( y = 300 - x \) into the second equation:
     \[
     50x + 70(300 - x) = 18000
     \]

   - Simplify and solve for \( x \):
     \[
     50x + 21000 - 70x = 18000
     \]
     \[
     -20x + 21000 = 18000
     \]
     \[
     -20x = 18000 - 21000
     \]
     \[
     -20x = -3000
     \]
     \[
     x = \frac{-3000}{-20} = 150
     \]

   - Substitute \( x = 150 \) back into the equation for \( y \):
     \[
     y = 300 - 150 = 150
     \]

4. **Verify the Solution:**
   - Check the total number of widgets:
     \[
     x + y = 150 + 150 = 300
     \]
   - Check the total revenue:
     \[
     50x + 70y = 50(150) + 70(150) = 7500 + 10500 = 18000
     \]

Both conditions are satisfied, confirming our solution is correct.

**Final Answer:**
The company sold 150 Type A widgets and 150 Type B widgets.
