==================================================

To solve the problem effectively, let's first clarify what "Sample reasoning question 160" might entail. Since the problem statement is not explicitly given, I'll assume it involves a typical math problem-solving scenario. I'll create a hypothetical problem and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**

"Calculate the sum of all even numbers between 1 and 160."

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Identify the Sequence of Even Numbers:**
   - Even numbers between 1 and 160 start from 2 and go up to 160.
   - The sequence is: 2, 4, 6, ..., 160.

2. **Determine the Number of Terms in the Sequence:**
   - This is an arithmetic sequence where the first term \(a_1 = 2\) and the last term \(a_n = 160\).
   - The common difference \(d = 2\).
   - The formula for the \(n\)-th term of an arithmetic sequence is:
     \[
     a_n = a_1 + (n-1) \cdot d
     \]
   - Plugging in the known values:
     \[
     160 = 2 + (n-1) \cdot 2
     \]
     \[
     160 = 2 + 2n - 2
     \]
     \[
     160 = 2n
     \]
     \[
     n = 80
     \]
   - There are 80 even numbers between 1 and 160.

3. **Calculate the Sum of the Sequence:**
   - The sum \(S_n\) of an arithmetic sequence is given by:
     \[
     S_n = \frac{n}{2} \cdot (a_1 + a_n)
     \]
   - Substituting the known values:
     \[
     S_{80} = \frac{80}{2} \cdot (2 + 160)
     \]
     \[
     S_{80} = 40 \cdot 162
     \]
     \[
     S_{80} = 6480
     \]

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The sum of all even numbers between 1 and 160 is 6480.

Thus, the complete reasoning and calculations lead us to the final answer: **6480**.
