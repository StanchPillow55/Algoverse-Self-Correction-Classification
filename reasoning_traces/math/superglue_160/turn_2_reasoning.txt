==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample reasoning question 160," we need to first understand what the problem is asking. However, the question provided is not clear or specific, as it only states "Sample reasoning question 160" without any additional context or details. Therefore, I will demonstrate a general approach to solving a typical math reasoning problem by creating a hypothetical example.

Let's assume the problem is as follows:

**Problem:**
A store sells apples and oranges. An apple costs $0.50, and an orange costs $0.75. If a customer buys a total of 20 fruits consisting of apples and oranges and spends exactly $12.00, how many apples and how many oranges did the customer buy?

**Solution:**

To solve this problem, we need to set up a system of equations based on the information given.

1. **Define the variables:**
   - Let \( x \) be the number of apples.
   - Let \( y \) be the number of oranges.

2. **Set up the equations:**
   - The total number of fruits is 20: 
     \[
     x + y = 20
     \]
   - The total cost of the fruits is $12.00:
     \[
     0.50x + 0.75y = 12.00
     \]

3. **Solve the system of equations:**

   First, solve the first equation for one of the variables. Let's solve for \( x \):
   \[
   x = 20 - y
   \]

   Substitute \( x = 20 - y \) into the second equation:
   \[
   0.50(20 - y) + 0.75y = 12.00
   \]

   Simplify and solve for \( y \):
   \[
   10 - 0.50y + 0.75y = 12.00
   \]
   \[
   10 + 0.25y = 12.00
   \]
   \[
   0.25y = 2.00
   \]
   \[
   y = \frac{2.00}{0.25} = 8
   \]

   Now that we have \( y = 8 \), substitute back to find \( x \):
   \[
   x = 20 - y = 20 - 8 = 12
   \]

4. **Verify the solution:**

   Check the total number of fruits:
   \[
   x + y = 12 + 8 = 20
   \]

   Check the total cost:
   \[
   0.50 \times 12 + 0.75 \times 8 = 6.00 + 6.00 = 12.00
   \]

Both conditions are satisfied, so the solution is correct.

**Final Answer:**
The customer bought 12 apples and 8 oranges.
