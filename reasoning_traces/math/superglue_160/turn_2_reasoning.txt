==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 160" refers to. Since the problem statement is not explicitly given, I'll assume this is a placeholder for a typical math problem. Let's create a hypothetical problem and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**

A company manufactures two products, A and B. The profit from each unit of product A is $5, and the profit from each unit of product B is $8. The company can produce a maximum of 100 units of product A and 80 units of product B per day. However, due to resource constraints, the total production of both products combined cannot exceed 150 units per day. How many units of each product should the company produce to maximize profit?

**Solution:**

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( x \) be the number of units of product A produced.
   - Let \( y \) be the number of units of product B produced.

2. **Objective Function:**
   - The profit function \( P \) is given by:
     \[
     P = 5x + 8y
     \]
   - We aim to maximize this profit function.

3. **Constraints:**
   - The production constraints are:
     \[
     x \leq 100 \quad \text{(Product A constraint)}
     \]
     \[
     y \leq 80 \quad \text{(Product B constraint)}
     \]
     \[
     x + y \leq 150 \quad \text{(Total production constraint)}
     \]
   - Additionally, \( x \) and \( y \) must be non-negative:
     \[
     x \geq 0, \quad y \geq 0
     \]

4. **Graphical Solution:**
   - Plot the constraints on a graph with \( x \) on the horizontal axis and \( y \) on the vertical axis.
   - The feasible region is bounded by the lines \( x = 100 \), \( y = 80 \), and \( x + y = 150 \).

5. **Identify Corner Points:**
   - The corner points of the feasible region are found by solving the system of equations formed by the intersection of the constraint lines:
     - Intersection of \( x = 100 \) and \( x + y = 150 \):
       \[
       100 + y = 150 \implies y = 50 \quad \Rightarrow \quad (100, 50)
       \]
     - Intersection of \( y = 80 \) and \( x + y = 150 \):
       \[
       x + 80 = 150 \implies x = 70 \quad \Rightarrow \quad (70, 80)
       \]
     - Intersection of \( x = 100 \) and \( y = 80 \):
       \[
       (100, 80)
       \]
     - Intersection of \( x = 0 \) and \( y = 0 \):
       \[
       (0, 0)
       \]

6. **Evaluate the Objective Function at Each Corner Point:**
   - \( P(100, 50) = 5(100) + 8(50) = 500 + 400 = 900 \)
   - \( P(70, 80) = 5(70) + 8(80) = 350 + 640 = 990 \)
   - \( P(100, 80) = 5(100) + 8(80) = 500 + 640 = 1140 \)
   - \( P(0, 0) = 5(0) + 8(0) = 0 \)

7. **Determine the Maximum Profit:**
   - The maximum profit occurs at the point \( (100, 80) \) with a profit of $1140.

**Final Answer:**
To maximize profit, the company should produce 100 units of product A and 80 units of product B, resulting in a maximum profit of $1140.
