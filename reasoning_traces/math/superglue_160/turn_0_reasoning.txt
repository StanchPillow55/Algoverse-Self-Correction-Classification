==================================================

To solve the problem, I need more information about what "Sample reasoning question 160" entails. Since the problem statement is not provided, I'll demonstrate how I would approach a typical math reasoning problem by creating a hypothetical example. Let's assume "Sample reasoning question 160" is a problem involving basic algebra.

**Hypothetical Problem:**

Solve for \( x \) in the equation:  
\[ 3x + 5 = 20 \]

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Equation:**
   The equation given is \( 3x + 5 = 20 \). This is a linear equation in one variable, \( x \).

2. **Isolate the Variable:**
   To solve for \( x \), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We can do this by performing operations that will simplify the equation.

3. **Subtract 5 from Both Sides:**
   To eliminate the constant term on the left side, subtract 5 from both sides of the equation:
   \[
   3x + 5 - 5 = 20 - 5
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   3x = 15
   \]

4. **Divide by the Coefficient of \( x \):**
   The next step is to divide both sides by the coefficient of \( x \), which is 3, to solve for \( x \):
   \[
   \frac{3x}{3} = \frac{15}{3}
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   x = 5
   \]

5. **Verify the Solution:**
   Substitute \( x = 5 \) back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies the equation:
   \[
   3(5) + 5 = 20
   \]
   Simplifying the left side gives:
   \[
   15 + 5 = 20
   \]
   \[
   20 = 20
   \]
   Since both sides of the equation are equal, \( x = 5 \) is indeed the correct solution.

**Final Answer:**

The solution to the equation \( 3x + 5 = 20 \) is \( x = 5 \).
