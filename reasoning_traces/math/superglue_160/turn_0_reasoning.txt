==================================================

To solve the problem, I need more specific information about "Sample reasoning question 160." Since the question is not provided, I'll demonstrate how to approach a typical math reasoning problem by creating an example problem and solving it step by step.

**Example Problem:**

A train travels from City A to City B, a distance of 300 miles. The train travels the first half of the distance at a speed of 60 miles per hour and the second half at a speed of 40 miles per hour. What is the average speed of the train for the entire trip?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - Total distance = 300 miles.
   - First half distance = 150 miles at 60 mph.
   - Second half distance = 150 miles at 40 mph.
   - We need to find the average speed for the entire trip.

2. **Calculate the Time for Each Segment:**
   - Time for the first half:
     \[
     \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{150 \text{ miles}}{60 \text{ mph}} = 2.5 \text{ hours}
     \]
   - Time for the second half:
     \[
     \text{Time} = \frac{150 \text{ miles}}{40 \text{ mph}} = 3.75 \text{ hours}
     \]

3. **Calculate the Total Time:**
   \[
   \text{Total Time} = 2.5 \text{ hours} + 3.75 \text{ hours} = 6.25 \text{ hours}
   \]

4. **Calculate the Average Speed:**
   - Average speed is given by the total distance divided by the total time.
   \[
   \text{Average Speed} = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Total Time}} = \frac{300 \text{ miles}}{6.25 \text{ hours}} = 48 \text{ mph}
   \]

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The average speed of the train for the entire trip is 48 miles per hour.

**Final Answer:**
The average speed of the train for the entire trip is 48 mph.
