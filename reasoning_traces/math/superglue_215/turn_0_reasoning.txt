==================================================

It seems like there might be a misunderstanding or a missing part of the question. "Sample reasoning question 215" doesn't provide enough information for me to solve a specific math problem. However, I can guide you through a general approach to solving math problems, or if you have a specific math problem in mind, please provide the details, and I'll be happy to help!

Here's a general approach to solving math problems:

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - Read the problem carefully.
   - Identify what is being asked.
   - Determine what information is given and what needs to be found.

2. **Devise a Plan:**
   - Think about the strategies that can be used to solve the problem (e.g., algebraic manipulation, drawing a diagram, using a formula).
   - Consider similar problems you have solved before.

3. **Carry Out the Plan:**
   - Execute the steps you have planned.
   - Perform calculations carefully.
   - Keep track of units and make sure your work is organized.

4. **Check Your Work:**
   - Review each step to ensure there are no errors.
   - Verify that your solution makes sense in the context of the problem.
   - Check if there is another way to solve the problem to confirm your answer.

5. **State the Final Answer:**
   - Clearly write down the final answer.
   - Make sure it answers the question posed in the problem.

If you provide a specific math problem or more details, I can apply this approach to help you find the solution.
