==================================================

To solve the problem effectively, I need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 215" refers to. However, since the question itself isn't provided, I'll demonstrate how to approach a typical math problem step-by-step. Let's consider a sample math problem and solve it:

**Sample Problem:**

Calculate the area of a triangle with a base of 10 units and a height of 5 units.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We need to find the area of a triangle.
   - We are given the base (\(b\)) of the triangle as 10 units.
   - We are given the height (\(h\)) of the triangle as 5 units.

2. **Recall the Formula for the Area of a Triangle:**
   - The formula for the area (\(A\)) of a triangle is:
     \[
     A = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height}
     \]

3. **Substitute the Given Values into the Formula:**
   - Substitute \(b = 10\) and \(h = 5\) into the formula:
     \[
     A = \frac{1}{2} \times 10 \times 5
     \]

4. **Perform the Calculations:**
   - First, multiply the base and the height:
     \[
     10 \times 5 = 50
     \]
   - Then, multiply by \(\frac{1}{2}\):
     \[
     \frac{1}{2} \times 50 = 25
     \]

5. **State the Final Answer:**
   - The area of the triangle is 25 square units.

By following these steps, we ensure that we understand the problem, recall the necessary formulas, substitute the given values, perform the calculations correctly, and arrive at the final answer. If you have a specific problem or question in mind, please provide the details, and I can work through that problem specifically.
