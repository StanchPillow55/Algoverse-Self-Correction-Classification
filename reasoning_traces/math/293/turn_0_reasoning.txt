To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total time Carlotta spends on three activities: singing on stage, practicing, and throwing temper tantrums. We are given the following information:

1. For every 1 minute Carlotta sings on stage, she spends an additional 3 minutes practicing.
2. For every 1 minute Carlotta sings on stage, she spends an additional 5 minutes throwing temper tantrums.
3. Her final stage performance is 6 minutes long.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

### Step 1: Calculate the time spent singing on stage
Carlotta's final stage performance is 6 minutes long. Therefore, she spends 6 minutes singing on stage.

### Step 2: Calculate the time spent practicing
For every 1 minute of singing, Carlotta practices for 3 minutes. Since she sings for 6 minutes, we calculate the practice time as follows:

\[
\text{Practice time} = 6 \, \text{minutes of singing} \times 3 \, \text{minutes of practice per minute of singing} = 18 \, \text{minutes}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the time spent throwing temper tantrums
For every 1 minute of singing, Carlotta throws temper tantrums for 5 minutes. Since she sings for 6 minutes, we calculate the tantrum time as follows:

\[
\text{Tantrum time} = 6 \, \text{minutes of singing} \times 5 \, \text{minutes of tantrums per minute of singing} = 30 \, \text{minutes}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the total combined time
Now, we add up all the time spent on singing, practicing, and throwing tantrums:

\[
\text{Total time} = \text{Singing time} + \text{Practice time} + \text{Tantrum time}
\]

\[
\text{Total time} = 6 \, \text{minutes} + 18 \, \text{minutes} + 30 \, \text{minutes} = 54 \, \text{minutes}
\]

Therefore, the total combined amount of time that Carlotta spends practicing, throwing tantrums, and singing in the final stage performance is \(\boxed{54}\) minutes.
