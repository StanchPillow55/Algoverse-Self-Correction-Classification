==================================================

Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the points for each player after 3 rounds:**
   - Mike has 21 points.
   - Jim has 3 points less than Mike. Therefore, Jim's points can be calculated as:
     \[
     \text{Jim's points} = \text{Mike's points} - 3 = 21 - 3 = 18
     \]
   - Tony has 2 times more than Mike. Therefore, Tony's points can be calculated as:
     \[
     \text{Tony's points} = 2 \times \text{Mike's points} = 2 \times 21 = 42
     \]

2. **Summarize the points after 3 rounds:**
   - Mike: 21 points
   - Jim: 18 points
   - Tony: 42 points

3. **Calculate the total points after 3 rounds:**
   \[
   \text{Total points} = \text{Mike's points} + \text{Jim's points} + \text{Tony's points} = 21 + 18 + 42
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total points} = 81
   \]

4. **Distribute extra points for the fourth round:**
   - According to the problem, every player gets an extra point if they have over 20 points.
   - Mike has 21 points (over 20), so he gets 1 extra point.
   - Jim has 18 points (not over 20), so he does not get any extra points.
   - Tony has 42 points (over 20), so he gets 1 extra point.

5. **Calculate the new points after the fourth round:**
   - Mike's new points:
     \[
     \text{Mike's new points} = 21 + 1 = 22
     \]
   - Jim's new points remain the same:
     \[
     \text{Jim's new points} = 18
     \]
   - Tony's new points:
     \[
     \text{Tony's new points} = 42 + 1 = 43
     \]

6. **Summarize the points after the fourth round:**
   - Mike: 22 points
   - Jim: 18 points
   - Tony: 43 points

7. **Calculate the total points after the fourth round:**
   \[
   \text{Total points after fourth round} = \text{Mike's new points} + \text{Jim's new points} + \text{Tony's new points} = 22 + 18 + 43
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total points after fourth round} = 83
   \]

8. **Final answer:**
   The total points all three players have after the extra points have been distributed is:
   \[
   \boxed{83}
   \]
