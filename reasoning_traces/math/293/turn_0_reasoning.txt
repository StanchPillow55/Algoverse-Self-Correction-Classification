To solve the problem, we need to determine the total time Carlotta spends on three activities: singing, practicing, and throwing temper tantrums. 

1. **Identify the time spent singing**: 
   - Carlotta sings for 6 minutes during her final performance.

2. **Calculate the time spent practicing**: 
   - For every 1 minute of singing, she practices for an additional 3 minutes.
   - Since she sings for 6 minutes, the total time spent practicing is:
     \[
     \text{Time practicing} = 6 \text{ minutes (singing)} \times 3 \text{ minutes (practicing per minute of singing)} = 18 \text{ minutes}
     \]

3. **Calculate the time spent throwing temper tantrums**: 
   - For every 1 minute of singing, she also throws temper tantrums for an additional 5 minutes.
   - Therefore, the total time spent throwing tantrums is:
     \[
     \text{Time throwing tantrums} = 6 \text{ minutes (singing)} \times 5 \text{ minutes (tantrums per minute of singing)} = 30 \text{ minutes}
     \]

4. **Calculate the total combined amount of time**: 
   - Now, we add the time spent on all three activities:
     \[
     \text{Total time} = \text{Time singing} + \text{Time practicing} + \text{Time throwing tantrums}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total time} = 6 \text{ minutes (singing)} + 18 \text{ minutes (practicing)} + 30 \text{ minutes (tantrums)}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total time} = 6 + 18 + 30 = 54 \text{ minutes}
     \]

Thus, the total combined amount of time that Carlotta spends practicing, throwing tantrums, and singing in the final stage performance is **54 minutes**. 

Final answer: **54 minutes**.
