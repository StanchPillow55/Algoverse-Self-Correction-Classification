==================================================

To solve the sample math problem "333," we need to first understand what the problem is asking. However, the problem statement "333" is ambiguous and does not provide any specific question or context. Therefore, I will assume that the problem involves performing some basic operations or analysis on the number 333. Let's explore a few possibilities:

### Possibility 1: Basic Properties of the Number 333

1. **Identify the Number:**
   - The number given is 333.

2. **Check if 333 is Prime:**
   - A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.
   - To check if 333 is prime, we need to test divisibility by prime numbers up to the square root of 333.
   - The square root of 333 is approximately 18.25, so we test divisibility by prime numbers less than or equal to 18: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17.

3. **Divisibility Tests:**
   - **Divisibility by 2:** 333 is odd, so it is not divisible by 2.
   - **Divisibility by 3:** The sum of the digits of 333 is 3 + 3 + 3 = 9, which is divisible by 3. Therefore, 333 is divisible by 3.
   - Since 333 is divisible by 3, it is not a prime number.

4. **Factorization of 333:**
   - Since 333 is divisible by 3, we divide 333 by 3:
     \[
     333 \div 3 = 111
     \]
   - Next, we factor 111. The sum of the digits of 111 is 1 + 1 + 1 = 3, which is divisible by 3. Therefore, 111 is also divisible by 3.
   - Divide 111 by 3:
     \[
     111 \div 3 = 37
     \]
   - Now, we check if 37 is a prime number. The square root of 37 is approximately 6.08, so we test divisibility by prime numbers less than or equal to 6: 2, 3, 5.
   - 37 is not divisible by 2 (it's odd), not divisible by 3 (3 + 7 = 10, not divisible by 3), and not divisible by 5 (does not end in 0 or 5). Therefore, 37 is a prime number.

5. **Complete Factorization:**
   - The complete prime factorization of 333 is:
     \[
     333 = 3 \times 3 \times 37 = 3^2 \times 37
     \]

### Possibility 2: Numerical Analysis

1. **Number Type:**
   - 333 is an integer.

2. **Even or Odd:**
   - 333 is an odd number because it does not end in 0, 2, 4, 6, or 8.

3. **Divisibility by Other Numbers:**
   - We already established that 333 is divisible by 3.
   - 333 is not divisible by 5 (does not end in 0 or 5).
   - 333 is not divisible by 10 (does not end in 0).

### Conclusion

Given the analysis above, the most meaningful interpretation of the problem "333" is to provide its prime factorization and basic properties. Therefore, the final answer is:

**Final Answer:**
The prime factorization of 333 is \(3^2 \times 37\). 333 is an odd, composite number.
