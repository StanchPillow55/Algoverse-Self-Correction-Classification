==================================================

To solve the sample math problem 333, let's first clarify what the problem is asking. Since the problem is simply stated as "333," it seems we need to interpret what kind of mathematical operation or analysis is required. Let's consider a few possibilities:

1. **Understanding 333 as a Number:**
   - 333 is a three-digit number.
   - It is an odd number because it ends in 3.
   - It is composed of three identical digits, which makes it interesting in terms of patterns.

2. **Prime Factorization:**
   - To determine if 333 is a prime number, we need to check if it has any divisors other than 1 and itself.
   - A quick check for divisibility by 2, 3, 5, and 7 (common small primes) can help:
     - **Divisibility by 2:** 333 is odd, so it is not divisible by 2.
     - **Divisibility by 3:** Sum of digits = 3 + 3 + 3 = 9, which is divisible by 3. Therefore, 333 is divisible by 3.
     - **Divisibility by 5:** 333 does not end in 0 or 5, so it is not divisible by 5.
     - **Divisibility by 7:** Perform the division: \(333 \div 7 \approx 47.571\), which is not an integer, so it is not divisible by 7.

   Since 333 is divisible by 3, let's perform the division:
   \[
   333 \div 3 = 111
   \]
   So, 333 = 3 × 111.

   Now, let's factor 111:
   - **Divisibility by 3:** Sum of digits = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3, which is divisible by 3.
   - Perform the division: 
   \[
   111 \div 3 = 37
   \]
   So, 111 = 3 × 37.

   Therefore, the prime factorization of 333 is:
   \[
   333 = 3^2 \times 37
   \]

3. **Properties and Characteristics:**
   - **Sum of Digits:** As calculated, the sum of the digits of 333 is 9.
   - **Palindrome:** 333 reads the same forwards and backwards, making it a palindromic number.
   - **Divisibility:** As shown, 333 is divisible by 3 and 37.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The number 333 is not a prime number.
   - Its prime factorization is \(3^2 \times 37\).

Final Answer:
The prime factorization of 333 is \(3^2 \times 37\).
