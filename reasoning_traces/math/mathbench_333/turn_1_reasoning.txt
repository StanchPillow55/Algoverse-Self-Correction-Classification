==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 333," we need to first understand what the problem is asking. However, the problem statement "Sample math problem 333" is not clear or specific. It seems like a placeholder or an incomplete problem statement. Therefore, I will assume that "333" is a number involved in a potential problem, and I will create a math problem using this number.

Let's create a problem involving the number 333 and solve it:

**Problem:**
Find the sum of the digits of the number 333 and determine if this sum is a prime number.

**Step-by-step Solution:**

1. **Identify the digits of the number 333:**
   - The number 333 consists of three digits: 3, 3, and 3.

2. **Calculate the sum of the digits:**
   - Sum = 3 + 3 + 3

3. **Perform the addition:**
   - Sum = 3 + 3 + 3 = 9

4. **Determine if the sum is a prime number:**
   - A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.
   - The number 9 is greater than 1, but it is not a prime number because it has divisors other than 1 and itself. Specifically, 9 can be divided evenly by 3 (since 9 = 3 Ã— 3).

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The sum of the digits of the number 333 is 9.
   - The number 9 is not a prime number.

**Final Answer:**
The sum of the digits of the number 333 is 9, and 9 is not a prime number.
