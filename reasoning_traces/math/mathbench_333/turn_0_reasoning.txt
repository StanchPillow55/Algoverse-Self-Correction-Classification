==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample math problem 333" refers to. Since the problem itself is not explicitly stated, I'll assume it might be a placeholder for a typical math problem. Let's create a hypothetical math problem involving the number 333 and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**

Calculate the sum of the digits of the number 333, and then multiply the result by 3.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Identify the digits of the number 333:**
   - The number 333 consists of three digits: 3, 3, and 3.

2. **Calculate the sum of the digits:**
   - Add the digits together: \(3 + 3 + 3\).
   - Perform the addition: \(3 + 3 = 6\).
   - Add the last digit: \(6 + 3 = 9\).

3. **Multiply the sum by 3:**
   - Take the sum of the digits, which is 9, and multiply it by 3.
   - Perform the multiplication: \(9 \times 3 = 27\).

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The final result after multiplying the sum of the digits by 3 is 27.

Therefore, the solution to the hypothetical problem is 27.
