Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, let's first understand what it is asking. Unfortunately, the question "Sample reasoning question 438" does not provide specific details or numbers to work with. Therefore, I'll demonstrate a general approach to solving a reasoning problem, which can be applied to a variety of math problems.

### Step-by-Step Approach:

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - Identify what is being asked. Look for keywords or phrases that indicate the type of problem (e.g., algebra, geometry, probability).
   - Determine what information is given and what needs to be found.

2. **Devise a Plan:**
   - Consider different strategies to solve the problem. Common strategies include:
     - Drawing a diagram
     - Creating an equation
     - Looking for patterns
     - Breaking the problem into smaller parts

3. **Carry Out the Plan:**
   - Execute the chosen strategy step by step.
   - Perform calculations carefully, showing all work to avoid mistakes.
   - If one approach doesn’t work, try another method.

4. **Review/Check the Solution:**
   - Verify that the solution is correct and answers the question.
   - Check calculations for accuracy.
   - Ensure that the solution makes sense in the context of the problem.

### Example Problem:

Let's create an example problem to illustrate this approach:

**Problem:** A rectangle has a length that is twice its width. If the perimeter of the rectangle is 36 units, what are the dimensions of the rectangle?

**Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We need to find the length and width of the rectangle.
   - Given: Length = 2 × Width, Perimeter = 36 units.

2. **Devise a Plan:**
   - Use the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle: \( P = 2 \times (\text{Length} + \text{Width}) \).
   - Substitute the given relationship between length and width into the formula.

3. **Carry Out the Plan:**
   - Let \( W \) be the width. Then the length \( L = 2W \).
   - Substitute into the perimeter formula: \( 36 = 2 \times (2W + W) \).
   - Simplify: \( 36 = 2 \times 3W \).
   - \( 36 = 6W \).
   - Solve for \( W \): \( W = \frac{36}{6} = 6 \).
   - Find the length: \( L = 2W = 2 \times 6 = 12 \).

4. **Review/Check the Solution:**
   - Check the perimeter with the found dimensions: \( 2 \times (12 + 6) = 2 \times 18 = 36 \).
   - The calculations are correct, and the solution makes sense.

**Final Answer:**
The dimensions of the rectangle are 12 units (length) and 6 units (width).

By following this structured approach, you can tackle a wide range of math problems effectively. If you have a specific problem or more details, feel free to provide them, and I can offer a more tailored solution.
