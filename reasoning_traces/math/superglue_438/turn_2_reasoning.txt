Question ID: superglue_438
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 438" entails. Since the problem statement is not specific, I will assume a generic math problem-solving approach and demonstrate how to tackle a typical math problem step by step. Let's assume a hypothetical problem for demonstration purposes:

**Hypothetical Problem:**
Solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   We are given a linear equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \). Our goal is to find the value of \( x \) that satisfies this equation.

2. **Isolate the Variable:**
   To solve for \( x \), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We can do this by performing inverse operations.

3. **Subtract 3 from Both Sides:**
   \[
   2x + 3 - 3 = 11 - 3
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   2x = 8
   \]

4. **Divide Both Sides by 2:**
   \[
   \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{8}{2}
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   x = 4
   \]

5. **Verify the Solution:**
   Substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies the equation:
   \[
   2(4) + 3 = 11
   \]
   Simplifying the left side gives:
   \[
   8 + 3 = 11
   \]
   Since both sides of the equation are equal, \( x = 4 \) is indeed the correct solution.

6. **Conclusion:**
   After solving the equation and verifying the solution, we conclude that the value of \( x \) that satisfies the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \) is \( x = 4 \).

**Final Answer:**
\( x = 4 \)

This step-by-step approach demonstrates how to solve a linear equation by isolating the variable, performing inverse operations, and verifying the solution. If "Sample reasoning question 438" refers to a specific problem, please provide additional details for a tailored solution.
