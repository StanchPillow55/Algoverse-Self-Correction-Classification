Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem effectively, we need to first understand what is being asked. However, the problem statement "Sample reasoning question 438" is not clear or specific enough to determine what mathematical operations or reasoning are required. 

Let's assume that "Sample reasoning question 438" is a placeholder for a specific math problem. Since no details are provided, I will demonstrate how to approach a generic math problem by creating a sample problem and solving it step-by-step.

**Sample Problem:**
Let's assume the problem is: "If 3x + 5 = 20, what is the value of x?"

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Equation:**
   The equation given is \(3x + 5 = 20\). This is a linear equation in one variable, \(x\).

2. **Isolate the Variable:**
   To find the value of \(x\), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We can do this by performing inverse operations.

3. **Subtract 5 from Both Sides:**
   \[
   3x + 5 - 5 = 20 - 5
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   3x = 15
   \]

4. **Divide Both Sides by 3:**
   \[
   \frac{3x}{3} = \frac{15}{3}
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   x = 5
   \]

5. **Verify the Solution:**
   Substitute \(x = 5\) back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies the equation:
   \[
   3(5) + 5 = 20
   \]
   Simplifying the left side gives:
   \[
   15 + 5 = 20
   \]
   \[
   20 = 20
   \]
   Since both sides of the equation are equal, our solution is verified.

**Final Answer:**
The value of \(x\) is 5.
