==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 438" refers to. Since the problem statement does not provide specific details about the question, I'll demonstrate a general approach to solving a typical math reasoning problem. 

Let's assume "Sample reasoning question 438" is a hypothetical math problem that involves logical reasoning and calculations. I'll create a sample problem and solve it step by step.

**Sample Problem:**

A farmer has a rectangular field that is 100 meters long and 60 meters wide. He wants to divide the field into smaller rectangular plots, each with an area of 300 square meters. How many such plots can the farmer create?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - The field is a rectangle with dimensions 100 meters by 60 meters.
   - Each smaller plot should have an area of 300 square meters.
   - We need to determine how many such plots can be created.

2. **Calculate the Total Area of the Field:**
   - The area of a rectangle is given by the formula: 
     \[
     \text{Area} = \text{Length} \times \text{Width}
     \]
   - For the field:
     \[
     \text{Area of the field} = 100 \, \text{meters} \times 60 \, \text{meters} = 6000 \, \text{square meters}
     \]

3. **Determine the Number of Plots:**
   - Each plot has an area of 300 square meters.
   - To find the number of plots, divide the total area of the field by the area of one plot:
     \[
     \text{Number of plots} = \frac{\text{Total area of the field}}{\text{Area of one plot}} = \frac{6000 \, \text{square meters}}{300 \, \text{square meters}}
     \]
   - Simplifying the division:
     \[
     \text{Number of plots} = \frac{6000}{300} = 20
     \]

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The farmer can create 20 plots, each with an area of 300 square meters.

**Final Answer:**
The farmer can create 20 smaller plots, each with an area of 300 square meters.
