To find the total cost of each uniform, we need to calculate the costs of the hat, jacket, and pants step by step.

1. **Cost of the Hat**:
   The problem states that the cost of the hat is $25.

   \[
   \text{Cost of Hat} = 25
   \]

2. **Cost of the Jacket**:
   The jacket costs three times as much as the hat. Therefore, we can calculate the cost of the jacket as follows:

   \[
   \text{Cost of Jacket} = 3 \times \text{Cost of Hat} = 3 \times 25 = 75
   \]

3. **Cost of the Pants**:
   The pants cost the average of the costs of the hat and jacket. To find the average, we first need to sum the costs of the hat and jacket and then divide by 2.

   \[
   \text{Total Cost of Hat and Jacket} = \text{Cost of Hat} + \text{Cost of Jacket} = 25 + 75 = 100
   \]

   Now, we calculate the average:

   \[
   \text{Cost of Pants} = \frac{\text{Total Cost of Hat and Jacket}}{2} = \frac{100}{2} = 50
   \]

4. **Total Cost of the Uniform**:
   Now that we have the costs of the hat, jacket, and pants, we can find the total cost of the uniform by adding these three costs together.

   \[
   \text{Total Cost of Uniform} = \text{Cost of Hat} + \text{Cost of Jacket} + \text{Cost of Pants}
   \]

   Substituting in the values we calculated:

   \[
   \text{Total Cost of Uniform} = 25 + 75 + 50 = 150
   \]

Thus, the total cost of each uniform is:

\[
\boxed{150}
\]
