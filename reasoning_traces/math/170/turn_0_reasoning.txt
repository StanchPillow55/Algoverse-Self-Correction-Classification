==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to establish the relationship between Mel's age and Katherine's age.

1. **Define Katherine's Age**: 
   Let's denote Katherine's age as \( K \). According to the problem, when Katherine is two dozen years old, we can calculate her age:
   \[
   K = 2 \times 12 = 24 \text{ years old}
   \]

2. **Define Mel's Age**: 
   The problem states that Mel is three years younger than Katherine. Therefore, we can express Mel's age \( M \) in terms of Katherine's age:
   \[
   M = K - 3
   \]

3. **Substituting Katherine's Age**: 
   Now we can substitute Katherine's age into the equation for Mel's age:
   \[
   M = 24 - 3
   \]

4. **Calculate Mel's Age**: 
   Performing the subtraction gives us:
   \[
   M = 21
   \]

Thus, when Katherine is two dozen years old (24 years), Mel will be 21 years old.

**Final Answer**: Mel will be 21 years old.
