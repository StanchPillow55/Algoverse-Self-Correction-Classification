To solve this problem, we need to determine Mel's age when Katherine is two dozen years old. Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Understand the relationship between Mel and Katherine's ages:**
   - We are told that Mel is three years younger than Katherine. This can be expressed as:
     \[
     \text{Mel's age} = \text{Katherine's age} - 3
     \]

2. **Determine Katherine's age:**
   - The problem states that Katherine is two dozen years old. A dozen is equal to 12, so two dozen is:
     \[
     2 \times 12 = 24
     \]
   - Therefore, Katherine is 24 years old.

3. **Calculate Mel's age when Katherine is 24:**
   - Using the relationship we established, we substitute Katherine's age into the equation for Mel's age:
     \[
     \text{Mel's age} = 24 - 3
     \]
   - Simplifying this gives:
     \[
     \text{Mel's age} = 21
     \]

Thus, when Katherine is two dozen years old, Mel will be 21 years old.

**Final Answer:**
Mel will be 21 years old.
