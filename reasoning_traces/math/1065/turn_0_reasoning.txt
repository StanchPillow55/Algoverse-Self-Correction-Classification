==================================================

To find the average score across John's 4 tests, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total score for all tests.**
   - John scored 100 on his first 3 tests, so we can calculate the total score for these tests:
     \[
     \text{Total score for first 3 tests} = 100 + 100 + 100 = 300
     \]
   - John scored 80 on his 4th test. We add this score to the total score from the first 3 tests:
     \[
     \text{Total score for all 4 tests} = 300 + 80 = 380
     \]

2. **Count the number of tests.**
   - John took a total of 4 tests.

3. **Calculate the average score.**
   - The average score is calculated by dividing the total score by the number of tests:
     \[
     \text{Average score} = \frac{\text{Total score}}{\text{Number of tests}} = \frac{380}{4}
     \]

4. **Perform the division.**
   - Now we divide 380 by 4:
     \[
     380 \div 4 = 95
     \]

Thus, John's average score across the 4 tests is \( \boxed{95} \).
