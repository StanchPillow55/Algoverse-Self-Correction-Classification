==================================================

Let's start by comparing the ages of Jolyn, Therese, and Aivo. 

According to the problem, Jolyn is 2 months older than Therese and Therese is 5 months older than Aivo. This means that Jolyn is 2 + 5 = 7 months older than Aivo.

Next, let's compare the ages of Leon and Aivo. 

The problem states that Leon is 2 months older than Aivo. 

Since Jolyn is 7 months older than Aivo and Leon is only 2 months older than Aivo, Jolyn is 7 - 2 = 5 months older than Leon.

Therefore, Jolyn is 5 months older than Leon.
