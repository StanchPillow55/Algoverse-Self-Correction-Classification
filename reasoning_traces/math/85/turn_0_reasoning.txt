==================================================

To determine how many quilt blocks Gene has, we need to calculate the total number of vacations he has taken from the age of 23 to 34, and then multiply that by the number of shirts he has from each vacation.

1. **Calculate the number of years Gene has been vacationing:**
   - Gene is currently 34 years old.
   - He started vacationing at the age of 23.
   - The total number of years he has been vacationing is:
     \[
     34 - 23 = 11 \text{ years}
     \]

2. **Calculate the number of vacations per year:**
   - Gene goes on 4 vacations each year.

3. **Calculate the total number of vacations:**
   - To find the total number of vacations, we multiply the number of years by the number of vacations per year:
     \[
     11 \text{ years} \times 4 \text{ vacations/year} = 44 \text{ vacations}
     \]

4. **Determine the number of quilt blocks:**
   - Since each vacation corresponds to one quilt block (one shirt), the total number of quilt blocks is equal to the total number of vacations:
     \[
     \text{Total quilt blocks} = 44
     \]

Thus, Gene has a total of **44 quilt blocks**. 

Final answer: **44**
