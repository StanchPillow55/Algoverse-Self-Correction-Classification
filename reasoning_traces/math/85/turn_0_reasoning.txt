Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to establish the relationships between the ages of the four classmates: Jolyn, Therese, Aivo, and Leon. We will denote their ages in months as follows:

- Let \( A \) be Aivo's age in months.
- Since Therese is 5 months older than Aivo, we can express Therese's age as:
  \[
  T = A + 5
  \]
- Jolyn is 2 months older than Therese, so we can express Jolyn's age as:
  \[
  J = T + 2 = (A + 5) + 2 = A + 7
  \]
- Leon is 2 months older than Aivo, so we can express Leon's age as:
  \[
  L = A + 2
  \]

Now we have the ages of all four classmates in terms of Aivo's age \( A \):
- Aivo's age: \( A \)
- Therese's age: \( T = A + 5 \)
- Jolyn's age: \( J = A + 7 \)
- Leon's age: \( L = A + 2 \)

Next, we need to find out how much older Jolyn is than Leon. We can calculate this by subtracting Leon's age from Jolyn's age:
\[
J - L = (A + 7) - (A + 2)
\]

Now, simplifying the expression:
\[
J - L = A + 7 - A - 2 = 7 - 2 = 5
\]

Thus, Jolyn is 5 months older than Leon.

Finally, we state the answer:
\[
\text{Jolyn is 5 months older than Leon.}
\]
