==================================================

It seems like there is a misunderstanding with the problem statement "Sample math problem 224." This doesn't provide enough information to solve a specific math problem. However, I can guide you through a generic math problem-solving process or help with a specific type of math problem if you provide more details.

To illustrate a typical problem-solving process, let's consider a sample math problem:

**Sample Problem:**
Solve for \( x \) in the equation: \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   We need to find the value of \( x \) that makes the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \) true.

2. **Isolate the Variable:**
   To solve for \( x \), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We can do this by performing inverse operations.

3. **Subtract 3 from Both Sides:**
   \[
   2x + 3 - 3 = 11 - 3
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   2x = 8
   \]

4. **Divide Both Sides by 2:**
   \[
   \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{8}{2}
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   x = 4
   \]

5. **Verify the Solution:**
   Substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies the equation:
   \[
   2(4) + 3 = 11
   \]
   \[
   8 + 3 = 11
   \]
   \[
   11 = 11
   \]
   The left-hand side equals the right-hand side, confirming that \( x = 4 \) is the correct solution.

**Final Answer:**
\( x = 4 \)

If you have a specific problem or type of problem in mind, please provide more details, and I can help solve that particular problem.
