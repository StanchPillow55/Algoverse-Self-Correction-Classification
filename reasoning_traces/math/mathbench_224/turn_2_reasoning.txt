==================================================

To solve the problem, we first need to understand what "Sample math problem 224" refers to. Since the problem is not explicitly stated, I'll assume a generic math problem and solve it step by step. Let's consider a typical algebra problem:

**Problem:**
Solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).

**Step-by-step Solution:**

1. **Identify the equation:**
   The equation given is \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).

2. **Isolate the variable term:**
   To isolate the term with the variable \( x \), we need to get rid of the constant on the left side of the equation. We can do this by subtracting 3 from both sides of the equation.

   \[
   2x + 3 - 3 = 11 - 3
   \]

   Simplifying both sides gives:

   \[
   2x = 8
   \]

3. **Solve for \( x \):**
   Now, we need to solve for \( x \) by isolating it. Since \( x \) is multiplied by 2, we can divide both sides of the equation by 2 to solve for \( x \).

   \[
   \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{8}{2}
   \]

   Simplifying both sides gives:

   \[
   x = 4
   \]

4. **Verify the solution:**
   To ensure our solution is correct, we can substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation and check if both sides are equal.

   Substitute \( x = 4 \) into the original equation:

   \[
   2(4) + 3 = 11
   \]

   Simplifying the left side gives:

   \[
   8 + 3 = 11
   \]

   Since both sides of the equation are equal, our solution is verified.

**Final Answer:**
The solution to the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \) is \( x = 4 \).
