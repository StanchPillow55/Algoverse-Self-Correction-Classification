Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to determine how many pods are in the special size box and then find out how many dishwashing cycles can be run for $1.

1. **Calculate the number of pods in the special size box:**
   - A regular box contains 100 pods.
   - The special box has 20% more pods than the regular box.
   - To find 20% of 100, we calculate:
     \[
     20\% \text{ of } 100 = 0.20 \times 100 = 20
     \]
   - Therefore, the total number of pods in the special box is:
     \[
     100 + 20 = 120 \text{ pods}
     \]

2. **Determine the cost per pod:**
   - The special box costs $12 for 120 pods.
   - To find the cost per pod, we divide the total cost by the number of pods:
     \[
     \text{Cost per pod} = \frac{12}{120} = 0.10 \text{ dollars per pod}
     \]

3. **Calculate how many pods can be bought for $1:**
   - To find out how many pods can be purchased for $1, we divide $1 by the cost per pod:
     \[
     \text{Number of pods for } \$1 = \frac{1}{0.10} = 10 \text{ pods}
     \]

4. **Determine the number of dishwashing cycles:**
   - Since each cycle uses 1 pod, the number of dishwashing cycles that can be run for $1 is equal to the number of pods we can buy for $1, which is 10.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{10}
\]
