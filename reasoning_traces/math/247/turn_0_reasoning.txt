To determine how many pills Tony has left in the bottle after his treatment, we will break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial Count of Pills**: Tony starts with a bottle containing 50 pills.

2. **Dosage for the First 2 Days**:
   - Tony takes 2 pills three times a day for the first 2 days.
   - Daily pill intake for the first 2 days:
     \[
     \text{Daily intake} = 2 \text{ pills} \times 3 \text{ times} = 6 \text{ pills}
     \]
   - Total intake for the first 2 days:
     \[
     \text{Total for 2 days} = 6 \text{ pills/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 12 \text{ pills}
     \]

3. **Dosage for the Next 3 Days**:
   - For the next 3 days, Tony cuts his intake in half. Therefore, he takes:
     \[
     \text{New daily intake} = \frac{6 \text{ pills}}{2} = 3 \text{ pills}
     \]
   - Total intake for the next 3 days:
     \[
     \text{Total for 3 days} = 3 \text{ pills/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 9 \text{ pills}
     \]

4. **Dosage on the Sixth Day**:
   - On the sixth day, Tony takes a final 2 pills in the morning.

5. **Total Pills Taken**:
   - Now, we can calculate the total number of pills Tony has taken over the 6 days:
     \[
     \text{Total pills taken} = \text{Pills from first 2 days} + \text{Pills from next 3 days} + \text{Pills on sixth day}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total pills taken} = 12 \text{ pills} + 9 \text{ pills} + 2 \text{ pills} = 23 \text{ pills}
     \]

6. **Calculating Remaining Pills**:
   - To find out how many pills are left in the bottle, we subtract the total number of pills taken from the initial count:
     \[
     \text{Pills left} = \text{Initial pills} - \text{Total pills taken}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Pills left} = 50 \text{ pills} - 23 \text{ pills} = 27 \text{ pills}
     \]

Therefore, the final answer is that Tony has **27 pills left in the bottle**.
