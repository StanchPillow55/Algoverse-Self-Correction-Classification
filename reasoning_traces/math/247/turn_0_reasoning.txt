To solve this problem, we need to calculate how many pills Tony consumes each day and then subtract the total number of pills he takes from the initial amount in the bottle.

**Step-by-step Calculation:**

1. **Initial Information:**
   - Total pills in the bottle: 50 pills.

2. **Pills taken in the first 2 days:**
   - Tony takes 2 pills, 3 times a day for the first 2 days.
   - Pills per day for the first 2 days: \(2 \text{ pills} \times 3 \text{ times} = 6 \text{ pills per day}\).
   - Total pills for the first 2 days: \(6 \text{ pills/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 12 \text{ pills}\).

3. **Pills taken in the next 3 days:**
   - Tony cuts the amount in half, so he takes 1 pill, 3 times a day.
   - Pills per day for the next 3 days: \(1 \text{ pill} \times 3 \text{ times} = 3 \text{ pills per day}\).
   - Total pills for the next 3 days: \(3 \text{ pills/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 9 \text{ pills}\).

4. **Pills taken on the sixth day:**
   - Tony takes a final 2 pills in the morning.
   - Total pills on the sixth day: 2 pills.

5. **Total pills consumed:**
   - Total pills consumed over the 6 days: \(12 \text{ pills (first 2 days)} + 9 \text{ pills (next 3 days)} + 2 \text{ pills (sixth day)} = 23 \text{ pills}\).

6. **Pills remaining in the bottle:**
   - Initial number of pills: 50 pills.
   - Pills remaining: \(50 \text{ pills} - 23 \text{ pills} = 27 \text{ pills}\).

**Final Answer:**
Tony has 27 pills left in the bottle.
