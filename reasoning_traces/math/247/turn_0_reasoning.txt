==================================================

To determine how much each person paid for the party supplies, we first need to calculate the total amount Isabelle spent on all the items. We will then divide that total by the number of people sharing the cost.

1. **Calculate the total cost of the party supplies:**
   - Cost of cake ingredients: $12
   - Cost of birthday presents: $43
   - Cost of decorations: $15
   - Cost of invitations: $4
   - Cost of goodie bags: $22

   Now, we will add these amounts together:

   \[
   \text{Total Cost} = 12 + 43 + 15 + 4 + 22
   \]

   Let's perform the addition step by step:

   - First, add $12 and $43:
     \[
     12 + 43 = 55
     \]

   - Next, add $15:
     \[
     55 + 15 = 70
     \]

   - Then, add $4:
     \[
     70 + 4 = 74
     \]

   - Finally, add $22:
     \[
     74 + 22 = 96
     \]

   So, the total cost of the party supplies is **$96**.

2. **Determine how much each person pays:**
   Isabelle is splitting the total cost evenly with her two parents, which means there are three people sharing the cost.

   To find out how much each person pays, we divide the total cost by the number of people:

   \[
   \text{Cost per person} = \frac{\text{Total Cost}}{\text{Number of people}} = \frac{96}{3}
   \]

   Now, we perform the division:

   \[
   96 \div 3 = 32
   \]

   Therefore, each person pays **$32**.

3. **Final Answer:**
   Each person (Isabelle and her two parents) pays **$32**.
