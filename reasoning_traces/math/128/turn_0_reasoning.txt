==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to determine the costs of watermelons, peppers, and oranges based on the information provided.

1. **Determine the cost of each pepper**:
   We know from the problem that each pepper costs $15.

2. **Calculate the cost of a watermelon**:
   The problem states that a watermelon costs three times what each pepper costs. Therefore, we can calculate the cost of a watermelon as follows:
   \[
   \text{Cost of a watermelon} = 3 \times \text{Cost of a pepper} = 3 \times 15 = 45
   \]
   So, each watermelon costs $45.

3. **Calculate the cost of an orange**:
   The problem states that an orange costs $5 less than what a watermelon costs. Thus, we can calculate the cost of an orange as follows:
   \[
   \text{Cost of an orange} = \text{Cost of a watermelon} - 5 = 45 - 5 = 40
   \]
   Therefore, each orange costs $40.

4. **Calculate the total cost for Dillon's purchases**:
   Dillon is buying:
   - 4 watermelons
   - 20 peppers
   - 10 oranges

   We will calculate the total cost for each type of fruit separately and then sum them up.

   - **Total cost for watermelons**:
   \[
   \text{Total cost for watermelons} = 4 \times \text{Cost of a watermelon} = 4 \times 45 = 180
   \]

   - **Total cost for peppers**:
   \[
   \text{Total cost for peppers} = 20 \times \text{Cost of a pepper} = 20 \times 15 = 300
   \]

   - **Total cost for oranges**:
   \[
   \text{Total cost for oranges} = 10 \times \text{Cost of an orange} = 10 \times 40 = 400
   \]

5. **Calculate the overall total cost**:
   Now, we sum the total costs for watermelons, peppers, and oranges:
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = \text{Total cost for watermelons} + \text{Total cost for peppers} + \text{Total cost for oranges}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = 180 + 300 + 400 = 880
   \]

Thus, the total amount of money Dillon will spend is \(\boxed{880}\).
