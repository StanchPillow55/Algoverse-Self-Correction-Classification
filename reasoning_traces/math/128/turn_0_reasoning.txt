To determine how many hotel rooms the principal needs to book for the class of 30 students, we need to analyze the sleeping arrangements available in each hotel room.

Each hotel room has:
- 2 queen size beds, with each bed accommodating 2 students. Therefore, the total capacity from the beds is:
  \[
  2 \text{ beds} \times 2 \text{ students per bed} = 4 \text{ students}
  \]

- Additionally, each room has a pull-out couch that can fit 1 student. Therefore, the total capacity from the pull-out couch is:
  \[
  1 \text{ student}
  \]

Now, we can calculate the total capacity of one hotel room:
\[
\text{Total capacity of one room} = 4 \text{ students (from beds)} + 1 \text{ student (from couch)} = 5 \text{ students}
\]

Next, we need to find out how many rooms are required to accommodate all 30 students. We can do this by dividing the total number of students by the capacity of one room:
\[
\text{Number of rooms needed} = \frac{\text{Total number of students}}{\text{Capacity of one room}} = \frac{30 \text{ students}}{5 \text{ students per room}} = 6 \text{ rooms}
\]

Since we are dividing 30 by 5, we find that 6 rooms are exactly enough to fit all 30 students without any leftover students.

Thus, the principal needs to book:
\[
\boxed{6}
\]
rooms to accommodate all 30 students.
