To solve this problem, we need to determine how many hotel rooms are required to accommodate all 30 students, given the sleeping arrangements available in each room.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Understand the Room Capacity:**
   - Each room has two queen size beds. Each bed can fit 2 students, so the two beds together can fit \(2 \times 2 = 4\) students.
   - Additionally, each room has a pull-out couch that can fit 1 student.
   - Therefore, the total capacity of each room is \(4 + 1 = 5\) students.

2. **Calculate the Number of Rooms Needed:**
   - We have a total of 30 students to accommodate.
   - Since each room can fit 5 students, we need to determine how many rooms are necessary to fit all 30 students.
   - To find the number of rooms needed, divide the total number of students by the capacity of each room:
     \[
     \frac{30}{5} = 6
     \]
   - This calculation shows that 6 rooms are required to accommodate all 30 students.

3. **Verification:**
   - If we book 6 rooms, each with a capacity of 5 students, the total number of students that can be accommodated is:
     \[
     6 \times 5 = 30
     \]
   - This matches the total number of students, confirming that 6 rooms are sufficient.

### Conclusion:

The principal needs to book **6 rooms** to accommodate all 30 students for the overnight field trip.
