==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to determine how many logs Carson needs to burn to keep the temperature in his house above freezing (32 degrees Fahrenheit).

### Step 1: Determine the Nighttime Temperature
We know that during the day, the temperature is 45 degrees. At night, the temperature drops by 33 degrees. We can calculate the nighttime temperature as follows:

\[
\text{Nighttime Temperature} = \text{Daytime Temperature} - \text{Temperature Drop}
\]
\[
\text{Nighttime Temperature} = 45 - 33 = 12 \text{ degrees}
\]

### Step 2: Determine the Temperature Increase Needed
Next, we need to find out how much Carson needs to raise the temperature to prevent the pipes from freezing. The target temperature is 32 degrees, and the current nighttime temperature is 12 degrees. We can calculate the required temperature increase:

\[
\text{Temperature Increase Needed} = \text{Target Temperature} - \text{Current Temperature}
\]
\[
\text{Temperature Increase Needed} = 32 - 12 = 20 \text{ degrees}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the Number of Logs Needed
Each log of wood that Carson burns raises the temperature by 5 degrees. To find out how many logs he needs to burn to achieve the required temperature increase, we can use the following formula:

\[
\text{Number of Logs} = \frac{\text{Temperature Increase Needed}}{\text{Temperature Increase per Log}}
\]
\[
\text{Number of Logs} = \frac{20}{5} = 4
\]

### Final Answer
Carson needs to burn **4 logs** to prevent the pipes from freezing.
