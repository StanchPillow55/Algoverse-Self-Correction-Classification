To solve this problem, we need to determine the meowing frequency of each cat and then calculate the total number of meows for all three cats over a period of 5 minutes.

**Step 1: Determine the meowing frequency of each cat.**

- **First Cat:**
  - The first cat meows 3 times per minute.

- **Second Cat:**
  - The second cat meows twice as frequently as the first cat.
  - Therefore, the second cat meows \(2 \times 3 = 6\) times per minute.

- **Third Cat:**
  - The third cat meows at one-third the frequency of the second cat.
  - Therefore, the third cat meows \(\frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2\) times per minute.

**Step 2: Calculate the total number of meows for each cat over 5 minutes.**

- **First Cat:**
  - Meows 3 times per minute.
  - Over 5 minutes, the first cat meows \(3 \times 5 = 15\) times.

- **Second Cat:**
  - Meows 6 times per minute.
  - Over 5 minutes, the second cat meows \(6 \times 5 = 30\) times.

- **Third Cat:**
  - Meows 2 times per minute.
  - Over 5 minutes, the third cat meows \(2 \times 5 = 10\) times.

**Step 3: Calculate the combined total number of meows from all three cats over 5 minutes.**

- Total meows from all three cats:
  \[
  15 \, (\text{first cat}) + 30 \, (\text{second cat}) + 10 \, (\text{third cat}) = 55
  \]

Therefore, the combined total number of meows the three cats make in 5 minutes is \(\boxed{55}\).
