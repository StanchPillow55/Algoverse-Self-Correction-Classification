To solve the problem, we need to determine the meowing frequency of each cat and then calculate the total number of meows they make together over a period of 5 minutes.

1. **Determine the frequency of each cat's meows:**
   - **First Cat:** The first cat meows 3 times per minute.
   - **Second Cat:** The second cat meows twice as frequently as the first cat. Therefore, the frequency of the second cat is:
     \[
     2 \times 3 = 6 \text{ times per minute}
     \]
   - **Third Cat:** The third cat meows at one-third the frequency of the second cat. Therefore, the frequency of the third cat is:
     \[
     \frac{6}{3} = 2 \text{ times per minute}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total number of meows for each cat over 5 minutes:**
   - **First Cat:** In 5 minutes, the first cat will meow:
     \[
     3 \text{ times/minute} \times 5 \text{ minutes} = 15 \text{ meows}
     \]
   - **Second Cat:** In 5 minutes, the second cat will meow:
     \[
     6 \text{ times/minute} \times 5 \text{ minutes} = 30 \text{ meows}
     \]
   - **Third Cat:** In 5 minutes, the third cat will meow:
     \[
     2 \text{ times/minute} \times 5 \text{ minutes} = 10 \text{ meows}
     \]

3. **Calculate the combined total number of meows:**
   Now we sum the meows from all three cats:
   \[
   15 \text{ (first cat)} + 30 \text{ (second cat)} + 10 \text{ (third cat)} = 55 \text{ meows}
   \]

Thus, the combined total number of meows the three cats make in 5 minutes is:

\[
\boxed{55}
\]
