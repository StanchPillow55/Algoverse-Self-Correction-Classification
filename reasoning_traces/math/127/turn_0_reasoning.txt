==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to determine how many friends Amy has based on the information given about Lily's friends and the difference in the number of friends between them.

1. **Identify the number of friends Lily has**: 
   - According to the problem, Lily made 50 friends.

2. **Determine the number of friends Amy has**: 
   - The problem states that Amy made 20 more friends than Lily. 
   - Since Lily has 50 friends, we can calculate the number of friends Amy has by adding 20 to the number of friends Lily has:
     \[
     \text{Number of friends Amy has} = \text{Number of friends Lily has} + 20
     \]
     \[
     \text{Number of friends Amy has} = 50 + 20 = 70
     \]

3. **Calculate the total number of friends Lily and Amy have together**: 
   - To find the total number of friends they have together, we simply add the number of friends Lily has to the number of friends Amy has:
     \[
     \text{Total friends} = \text{Number of friends Lily has} + \text{Number of friends Amy has}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total friends} = 50 + 70 = 120
     \]

4. **Final answer**: 
   - Therefore, the total number of friends that Lily and Amy have together is \( \boxed{120} \).
