==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 291" entails. Since the problem doesn't provide specific details, I'll assume it's a generic math problem that requires logical reasoning and problem-solving skills. Let's break down a hypothetical math problem step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**

Let's assume the problem is as follows:

"A train travels from City A to City B, a distance of 300 miles, at a constant speed. If the train increases its speed by 10 miles per hour, it would take 1 hour less to complete the journey. What is the original speed of the train?"

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( v \) be the original speed of the train in miles per hour.
   - The time taken to travel from City A to City B at the original speed is \( \frac{300}{v} \) hours.

2. **Increased Speed Scenario:**
   - If the speed is increased by 10 miles per hour, the new speed is \( v + 10 \).
   - The time taken at the increased speed is \( \frac{300}{v + 10} \) hours.

3. **Set Up the Equation:**
   - According to the problem, the time taken at the increased speed is 1 hour less than the time taken at the original speed.
   - Therefore, we can set up the equation:
     \[
     \frac{300}{v} - \frac{300}{v + 10} = 1
     \]

4. **Solve the Equation:**
   - To solve the equation, find a common denominator and simplify:
     \[
     \frac{300(v + 10) - 300v}{v(v + 10)} = 1
     \]
     \[
     \frac{300v + 3000 - 300v}{v(v + 10)} = 1
     \]
     \[
     \frac{3000}{v(v + 10)} = 1
     \]

   - Cross-multiply to solve for \( v \):
     \[
     3000 = v(v + 10)
     \]
     \[
     3000 = v^2 + 10v
     \]

   - Rearrange the equation into standard quadratic form:
     \[
     v^2 + 10v - 3000 = 0
     \]

5. **Solve the Quadratic Equation:**
   - Use the quadratic formula \( v = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \), where \( a = 1 \), \( b = 10 \), and \( c = -3000 \).
   - Calculate the discriminant:
     \[
     b^2 - 4ac = 10^2 - 4 \times 1 \times (-3000) = 100 + 12000 = 12100
     \]

   - Calculate the roots:
     \[
     v = \frac{-10 \pm \sqrt{12100}}{2}
     \]
     \[
     v = \frac{-10 \pm 110}{2}
     \]

   - This gives two possible solutions:
     \[
     v = \frac{100}{2} = 50
     \]
     \[
     v = \frac{-120}{2} = -60
     \]

   - Since speed cannot be negative, the original speed of the train is \( v = 50 \) miles per hour.

**Final Answer:**

The original speed of the train is 50 miles per hour.
