Question ID: superglue_291
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 291" entails. Since the question is not explicitly provided, I will assume it is a hypothetical math problem that requires logical reasoning and problem-solving skills. Let's create a sample math problem and solve it step by step.

**Sample Problem:**
A farmer has a rectangular field that is 120 meters long and 80 meters wide. He wants to divide the field into smaller, equal-sized square plots. What is the largest possible side length of each square plot?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We have a rectangular field with dimensions 120 meters by 80 meters.
   - We need to divide this field into square plots of equal size.
   - The goal is to find the largest possible side length for these square plots.

2. **Identify the Mathematical Concept:**
   - The problem requires us to find the largest square that can fit into both the length and the width of the rectangle.
   - This is equivalent to finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the two dimensions.

3. **Calculate the GCD:**
   - The dimensions of the rectangle are 120 meters and 80 meters.
   - We will use the Euclidean algorithm to find the GCD.

   **Euclidean Algorithm Steps:**
   - Divide the larger number by the smaller number and find the remainder.
   - Replace the larger number with the smaller number and the smaller number with the remainder.
   - Repeat the process until the remainder is zero. The last non-zero remainder is the GCD.

   **Calculations:**
   - \( 120 \div 80 = 1 \) remainder \( 40 \)
   - \( 80 \div 40 = 2 \) remainder \( 0 \)

   The last non-zero remainder is 40.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The largest possible side length of each square plot is 40 meters.

5. **Final Answer:**
   - The largest possible side length of each square plot is 40 meters.

By following these steps, we have determined that the largest square plot that can fit into the farmer's rectangular field has a side length of 40 meters.
