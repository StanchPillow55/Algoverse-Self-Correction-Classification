Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we first need to understand what "Sample math problem 330" refers to. Since the problem itself is not explicitly stated, I'll assume a generic math problem involving the number 330. Let's consider a problem involving the factors of 330, which is a common type of math problem.

**Problem:** Find all the factors of 330 and determine if 330 is a prime number.

**Step 1: Understanding Factors**
Factors of a number are integers that can be multiplied together to produce the original number. For example, if \( a \times b = 330 \), then both \( a \) and \( b \) are factors of 330.

**Step 2: Prime Factorization**
To find all factors, it helps to start with the prime factorization of 330.

1. **Check divisibility by 2:** 
   - 330 is even, so it is divisible by 2.
   - \( 330 \div 2 = 165 \)

2. **Check divisibility by 3:**
   - Sum of the digits of 165 is \( 1 + 6 + 5 = 12 \), which is divisible by 3.
   - \( 165 \div 3 = 55 \)

3. **Check divisibility by 5:**
   - 55 ends in 5, so it is divisible by 5.
   - \( 55 \div 5 = 11 \)

4. **Check divisibility by 11:**
   - 11 is a prime number, and 11 divided by itself is 1.

So, the prime factorization of 330 is:
\[ 330 = 2 \times 3 \times 5 \times 11 \]

**Step 3: Finding All Factors**
Using the prime factorization, we can find all factors by considering all combinations of these prime factors.

- Start with 1 (since 1 is a factor of every number).
- Multiply combinations of the prime factors:
  - \( 2, 3, 5, 11 \)
  - \( 2 \times 3 = 6 \)
  - \( 2 \times 5 = 10 \)
  - \( 2 \times 11 = 22 \)
  - \( 3 \times 5 = 15 \)
  - \( 3 \times 11 = 33 \)
  - \( 5 \times 11 = 55 \)
  - \( 2 \times 3 \times 5 = 30 \)
  - \( 2 \times 3 \times 11 = 66 \)
  - \( 2 \times 5 \times 11 = 110 \)
  - \( 3 \times 5 \times 11 = 165 \)
  - \( 2 \times 3 \times 5 \times 11 = 330 \)

Thus, the complete list of factors is:
\[ 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 10, 11, 15, 22, 30, 33, 55, 66, 110, 165, 330 \]

**Step 4: Determine if 330 is a Prime Number**
A prime number has exactly two distinct positive divisors: 1 and itself. Since 330 has more than two factors, it is not a prime number.

**Final Answer:**
The factors of 330 are \( 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 10, 11, 15, 22, 30, 33, 55, 66, 110, 165, 330 \). The number 330 is not a prime number.
