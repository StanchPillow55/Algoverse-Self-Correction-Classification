==================================================

To solve the problem, we first need to understand what "Sample math problem 330" refers to. Since there is no specific problem statement provided, I'll create a hypothetical math problem that could be labeled as "Sample math problem 330" and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem 330:**

A rectangle has a length that is 3 times its width. If the perimeter of the rectangle is 48 units, find the dimensions of the rectangle.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the problem:**
   - We have a rectangle with a length (L) and a width (W).
   - The length is 3 times the width: \( L = 3W \).
   - The perimeter of the rectangle is 48 units.

2. **Recall the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle:**
   \[
   P = 2L + 2W
   \]
   where \( P \) is the perimeter, \( L \) is the length, and \( W \) is the width.

3. **Substitute the given values into the formula:**
   - We know \( P = 48 \) and \( L = 3W \).
   - Substitute \( L = 3W \) into the perimeter formula:
   \[
   48 = 2(3W) + 2W
   \]

4. **Simplify the equation:**
   \[
   48 = 6W + 2W
   \]
   \[
   48 = 8W
   \]

5. **Solve for \( W \):**
   \[
   W = \frac{48}{8} = 6
   \]

6. **Find the length using \( L = 3W \):**
   \[
   L = 3 \times 6 = 18
   \]

7. **Verify the solution:**
   - Check the perimeter with the found dimensions:
   \[
   P = 2L + 2W = 2(18) + 2(6) = 36 + 12 = 48
   \]
   - The calculated perimeter matches the given perimeter, confirming our solution is correct.

**Final Answer:**

The dimensions of the rectangle are:
- Width (\( W \)): 6 units
- Length (\( L \)): 18 units
