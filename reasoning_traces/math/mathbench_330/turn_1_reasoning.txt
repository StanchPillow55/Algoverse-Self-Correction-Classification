Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we first need to understand what "Sample math problem 330" refers to. Since the problem isn't explicitly stated, I'll assume it's a generic math problem involving basic arithmetic or algebra. Let's create a hypothetical problem and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**
Solve for \( x \) in the equation: \( 2x + 5 = 15 \).

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the equation:**
   The equation \( 2x + 5 = 15 \) is a linear equation in one variable, \( x \).

2. **Isolate the variable \( x \):**
   To solve for \( x \), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We can do this by performing inverse operations.

3. **Subtract 5 from both sides:**
   \[
   2x + 5 - 5 = 15 - 5
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   2x = 10
   \]

4. **Divide both sides by 2:**
   \[
   \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{10}{2}
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   x = 5
   \]

5. **Verify the solution:**
   Substitute \( x = 5 \) back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies the equation:
   \[
   2(5) + 5 = 15
   \]
   Simplifying the left side:
   \[
   10 + 5 = 15
   \]
   Since both sides of the equation are equal, \( x = 5 \) is indeed the correct solution.

**Final Answer:**
The solution to the equation \( 2x + 5 = 15 \) is \( x = 5 \).

This hypothetical problem demonstrates a typical approach to solving a simple linear equation. If "Sample math problem 330" refers to a specific problem, please provide more details, and I can adjust the solution accordingly.
