==================================================

To solve the problem, we first need to understand what "Sample math problem 330" refers to. Since the problem is not explicitly stated, I'll assume it's a placeholder for a specific math problem. Without the actual problem, I'll create a sample math problem and solve it step by step.

**Sample Math Problem:**

Let's assume "Sample math problem 330" is the following:

**Problem:**
Solve for \( x \) in the equation:
\[ 3x + 5 = 20 \]

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Equation:**
   The equation given is a linear equation in one variable, \( x \). Our goal is to isolate \( x \) on one side of the equation to find its value.

2. **Isolate the Variable:**
   To isolate \( x \), we need to perform operations that will leave \( x \) alone on one side of the equation.

   Start with the equation:
   \[ 3x + 5 = 20 \]

   Subtract 5 from both sides to eliminate the constant term on the left side:
   \[
   3x + 5 - 5 = 20 - 5
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   3x = 15
   \]

3. **Solve for \( x \):**
   Now, divide both sides by 3 to solve for \( x \):
   \[
   \frac{3x}{3} = \frac{15}{3}
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   x = 5
   \]

4. **Verify the Solution:**
   Substitute \( x = 5 \) back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies the equation:
   \[
   3(5) + 5 = 20
   \]
   Calculate the left side:
   \[
   15 + 5 = 20
   \]
   Since both sides are equal, \( x = 5 \) is indeed the correct solution.

**Final Answer:**
The solution to the equation \( 3x + 5 = 20 \) is \( x = 5 \).
