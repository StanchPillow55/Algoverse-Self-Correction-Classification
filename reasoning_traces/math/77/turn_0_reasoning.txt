==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to establish the relationships between the amounts of laundry done by Raymond, Sarah, and David based on the information given.

1. **Identify the amount of laundry done by Sarah**:
   - We know from the problem that Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry.

2. **Determine the amount of laundry done by David**:
   - The problem states that Sarah does 4 times as much laundry as David. 
   - Let \( D \) represent the amount of laundry done by David. According to the relationship:
     \[
     S = 4D
     \]
   - We know \( S = 400 \) pounds (the amount of laundry Sarah does), so we can set up the equation:
     \[
     400 = 4D
     \]
   - To find \( D \), we divide both sides by 4:
     \[
     D = \frac{400}{4} = 100 \text{ pounds}
     \]
   - Therefore, David does 100 pounds of laundry.

3. **Determine the amount of laundry done by Raymond**:
   - The problem states that Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah. 
   - Let \( R \) represent the amount of laundry done by Raymond. According to the relationship:
     \[
     R = \frac{1}{2}S
     \]
   - Substituting \( S = 400 \) pounds into the equation:
     \[
     R = \frac{1}{2} \times 400 = 200 \text{ pounds}
     \]
   - Therefore, Raymond does 200 pounds of laundry.

4. **Calculate the difference in the amount of laundry Raymond and David do**:
   - We need to find the difference between the amount of laundry Raymond does and the amount David does:
     \[
     \text{Difference} = R - D
     \]
   - Substituting the values we found:
     \[
     \text{Difference} = 200 - 100 = 100 \text{ pounds}
     \]

5. **Final Answer**:
   - The difference in the amount of laundry Raymond and David do is \( \boxed{100} \) pounds.
