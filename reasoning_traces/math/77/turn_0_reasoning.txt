Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To determine the boxer's weight on the day of the fight, we need to calculate how much weight he will lose over the 4 months leading up to the fight.

1. **Initial Weight**: The boxer currently weighs 97 kg.

2. **Weight Loss Rate**: The boxer is on a diet that allows him to lose 3 kg per month.

3. **Duration Until Fight**: There are 4 months until the fight.

4. **Total Weight Loss Calculation**:
   - We calculate the total weight loss over the 4 months by multiplying the weight loss per month by the number of months:
   \[
   \text{Total Weight Loss} = \text{Weight Loss per Month} \times \text{Number of Months}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total Weight Loss} = 3 \, \text{kg/month} \times 4 \, \text{months} = 12 \, \text{kg}
   \]

5. **Final Weight Calculation**:
   - To find the boxer's weight on the day of the fight, we subtract the total weight loss from his initial weight:
   \[
   \text{Final Weight} = \text{Initial Weight} - \text{Total Weight Loss}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Final Weight} = 97 \, \text{kg} - 12 \, \text{kg} = 85 \, \text{kg}
   \]

Thus, the boxer's weight on the day of the fight will be **85 kg**.

**Final Answer**: 85 kg
