==================================================

To solve the problem effectively, we need to first understand what is being asked. However, the question "Sample reasoning question 431" does not provide specific details or numerical data to work with. Therefore, I will demonstrate a general approach to solving a typical math problem by creating a hypothetical problem and solving it step-by-step.

Let's consider a sample math problem:

**Problem:**
A farmer has a rectangular field that is 120 meters long and 80 meters wide. He wants to divide the field into smaller rectangular plots, each with an area of 240 square meters. How many such plots can the farmer create?

**Step 1: Understand the Problem**
The problem involves dividing a large rectangular area into smaller rectangles of a specified area. We need to determine how many smaller rectangles can fit into the larger one.

**Step 2: Calculate the Area of the Large Rectangle**
The area of a rectangle is calculated by multiplying its length by its width. For the farmer's field:
\[ \text{Area of the field} = \text{Length} \times \text{Width} = 120 \, \text{m} \times 80 \, \text{m} = 9600 \, \text{square meters} \]

**Step 3: Determine the Number of Smaller Plots**
Each smaller plot has an area of 240 square meters. To find out how many such plots can be created, we divide the total area of the field by the area of one plot:
\[ \text{Number of plots} = \frac{\text{Area of the field}}{\text{Area of one plot}} = \frac{9600 \, \text{square meters}}{240 \, \text{square meters}} \]

**Step 4: Perform the Division**
\[ \frac{9600}{240} = 40 \]

**Step 5: Verify the Calculation**
To ensure the calculation is correct, we can multiply the number of plots by the area of one plot to see if it equals the total area of the field:
\[ 40 \times 240 = 9600 \, \text{square meters} \]
The calculation checks out, confirming that our division was correct.

**Final Answer:**
The farmer can create 40 smaller plots, each with an area of 240 square meters, from the larger field.

This approach demonstrates how to break down a problem, perform calculations, and verify results to ensure accuracy. If you have a specific problem or more details, feel free to provide them, and I can assist you further!
