==================================================

To solve the problem, I need more specific information about "Sample reasoning question 431." Since the question is not provided, I'll demonstrate how to approach a typical math problem by creating an example and solving it step by step.

**Example Problem:**

A train travels from City A to City B, a distance of 300 miles. The train travels the first 100 miles at a speed of 50 miles per hour and the remaining 200 miles at a speed of 75 miles per hour. How long does the entire journey take?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We need to find the total time taken for the train to travel from City A to City B.
   - The journey is divided into two segments with different speeds.

2. **Identify the Known Values:**
   - Distance for the first segment: 100 miles
   - Speed for the first segment: 50 miles per hour
   - Distance for the second segment: 200 miles
   - Speed for the second segment: 75 miles per hour

3. **Calculate the Time for Each Segment:**
   - Time is calculated using the formula: \(\text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}}\).

   **First Segment:**
   \[
   \text{Time for first segment} = \frac{100 \text{ miles}}{50 \text{ miles per hour}} = 2 \text{ hours}
   \]

   **Second Segment:**
   \[
   \text{Time for second segment} = \frac{200 \text{ miles}}{75 \text{ miles per hour}} = \frac{200}{75} \text{ hours}
   \]

   Simplify \(\frac{200}{75}\):
   \[
   \frac{200}{75} = \frac{8}{3} \text{ hours} \approx 2.67 \text{ hours}
   \]

4. **Calculate the Total Time:**
   - Add the time for both segments to find the total journey time.
   \[
   \text{Total time} = 2 \text{ hours} + \frac{8}{3} \text{ hours} = \frac{6}{3} \text{ hours} + \frac{8}{3} \text{ hours} = \frac{14}{3} \text{ hours}
   \]

   Convert \(\frac{14}{3}\) hours to a decimal:
   \[
   \frac{14}{3} \approx 4.67 \text{ hours}
   \]

5. **State the Final Answer:**
   - The entire journey takes approximately 4.67 hours.

This is a complete solution to the example problem, demonstrating how to break down a problem, perform calculations, and arrive at a final answer. If you have a specific problem labeled "Sample reasoning question 431," please provide the details, and I can solve it accordingly.
