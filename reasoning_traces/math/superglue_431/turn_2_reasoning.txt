==================================================

To solve the problem, I need more specific information about "Sample reasoning question 431." Since the problem statement is not provided, I'll demonstrate a general approach to solving a reasoning-based math problem. If you have a specific problem in mind, please provide the details, and I'll be happy to help.

### General Approach to Solving a Math Reasoning Problem

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - Carefully read the problem statement.
   - Identify what is being asked.
   - Note any given information and constraints.

2. **Devise a Plan:**
   - Consider different strategies to solve the problem, such as drawing a diagram, creating an equation, or breaking the problem into smaller parts.
   - Choose the most suitable strategy based on the problem type.

3. **Carry Out the Plan:**
   - Execute the chosen strategy step by step.
   - Perform calculations carefully, showing all work.
   - Keep track of units and ensure consistency.

4. **Check Your Work:**
   - Verify each step for accuracy.
   - Ensure the solution meets all the problem's requirements.
   - Re-evaluate the reasoning if the solution seems incorrect.

5. **State the Final Answer:**
   - Clearly present the final answer.
   - Include units if applicable.

### Example Problem and Solution

**Example Problem:**
A rectangle has a length that is twice its width. If the perimeter of the rectangle is 36 units, what are the dimensions of the rectangle?

**Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We need to find the length and width of the rectangle.
   - Given: Length = 2 Ã— Width, Perimeter = 36 units.

2. **Devise a Plan:**
   - Use the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle: \( P = 2 \times (\text{Length} + \text{Width}) \).

3. **Carry Out the Plan:**
   - Let \( W \) be the width of the rectangle.
   - Then the length \( L = 2W \).
   - Substitute into the perimeter formula: 
     \[
     36 = 2 \times (2W + W)
     \]
   - Simplify and solve for \( W \):
     \[
     36 = 2 \times 3W
     \]
     \[
     36 = 6W
     \]
     \[
     W = \frac{36}{6} = 6
     \]
   - Find the length \( L \):
     \[
     L = 2W = 2 \times 6 = 12
     \]

4. **Check Your Work:**
   - Verify the perimeter with the found dimensions:
     \[
     P = 2 \times (12 + 6) = 2 \times 18 = 36
     \]
   - The calculations are correct.

5. **State the Final Answer:**
   - The width of the rectangle is 6 units, and the length is 12 units.

If you have a specific problem (like "Sample reasoning question 431"), please provide the details, and I can work through that problem specifically.
