==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 276" refers to. Since the question is not explicitly provided, I will assume this is a placeholder for a typical math problem. Let's create a hypothetical math problem and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**

A company produces two types of widgets: Type A and Type B. Each Type A widget requires 2 hours of labor and 3 units of material. Each Type B widget requires 1 hour of labor and 4 units of material. The company has a maximum of 100 hours of labor and 120 units of material available. If the profit from each Type A widget is $5 and from each Type B widget is $7, how many of each type of widget should the company produce to maximize profit?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( x \) be the number of Type A widgets produced.
   - Let \( y \) be the number of Type B widgets produced.

2. **Set Up Constraints:**
   - Labor Constraint: \( 2x + y \leq 100 \)
   - Material Constraint: \( 3x + 4y \leq 120 \)
   - Non-negativity Constraints: \( x \geq 0 \), \( y \geq 0 \)

3. **Objective Function:**
   - Maximize Profit: \( P = 5x + 7y \)

4. **Graph the Constraints:**
   - Plot the line \( 2x + y = 100 \).
   - Plot the line \( 3x + 4y = 120 \).
   - Identify the feasible region that satisfies all constraints.

5. **Find the Corner Points:**
   - Solve the system of equations to find intersections:
     - \( 2x + y = 100 \)
     - \( 3x + 4y = 120 \)

   Solving these simultaneously:
   - Multiply the first equation by 4: \( 8x + 4y = 400 \)
   - Subtract the second equation: \( 8x + 4y - 3x - 4y = 400 - 120 \)
   - Simplify: \( 5x = 280 \)
   - \( x = 56 \)

   Substitute \( x = 56 \) into \( 2x + y = 100 \):
   - \( 2(56) + y = 100 \)
   - \( 112 + y = 100 \)
   - \( y = -12 \) (Not feasible since \( y \geq 0 \))

   Check intersections with axes:
   - \( x = 0 \): \( 3(0) + 4y = 120 \) → \( y = 30 \)
   - \( y = 0 \): \( 2x + 0 = 100 \) → \( x = 50 \)

6. **Evaluate Objective Function at Corner Points:**
   - (0, 30): \( P = 5(0) + 7(30) = 210 \)
   - (50, 0): \( P = 5(50) + 7(0) = 250 \)

7. **Determine the Maximum Profit:**
   - The maximum profit occurs at the point (50, 0) with a profit of $250.

**Final Answer:**
The company should produce 50 Type A widgets and 0 Type B widgets to maximize profit, resulting in a maximum profit of $250.
