==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 276" refers to. However, since the problem statement is not provided, I will demonstrate a general approach to solving a typical math problem by using a hypothetical example. Let's assume the problem is as follows:

**Problem:**  
A store sells apples at $2 each and bananas at $1.50 each. If a customer buys a total of 10 fruits consisting of apples and bananas and spends a total of $17, how many apples and how many bananas did the customer buy?

**Solution:**

To solve this problem, we need to set up a system of equations based on the information given.

1. **Define the variables:**
   - Let \( x \) be the number of apples.
   - Let \( y \) be the number of bananas.

2. **Set up the equations:**
   - The total number of fruits is 10:  
     \[
     x + y = 10
     \]
   - The total cost is $17:  
     \[
     2x + 1.5y = 17
     \]

3. **Solve the system of equations:**

   We can use the substitution or elimination method. Here, we'll use substitution.

   From the first equation, solve for \( y \):
   \[
   y = 10 - x
   \]

   Substitute \( y = 10 - x \) into the second equation:
   \[
   2x + 1.5(10 - x) = 17
   \]

   Simplify and solve for \( x \):
   \[
   2x + 15 - 1.5x = 17
   \]
   \[
   0.5x + 15 = 17
   \]
   \[
   0.5x = 2
   \]
   \[
   x = 4
   \]

   Now, substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the equation for \( y \):
   \[
   y = 10 - 4 = 6
   \]

4. **Verify the solution:**

   Check the total number of fruits:
   \[
   x + y = 4 + 6 = 10
   \]

   Check the total cost:
   \[
   2x + 1.5y = 2(4) + 1.5(6) = 8 + 9 = 17
   \]

Both conditions are satisfied, so the solution is correct.

**Final Answer:**
The customer bought 4 apples and 6 bananas.
