Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we first need to understand what "Sample reasoning question 276" refers to. However, without specific details or context about what "Sample reasoning question 276" entails, we can only provide a general approach to solving math problems.

Let's assume this is a typical math problem-solving scenario. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step guide on how to approach a math problem:

### Step 1: Understand the Problem
- **Read the problem carefully:** Make sure you understand what is being asked. Identify the key information and what you need to find.
- **Identify the type of problem:** Is it algebra, geometry, calculus, etc.?

### Step 2: Devise a Plan
- **Choose a strategy:** Depending on the problem type, decide on a strategy. Common strategies include:
  - Drawing a diagram
  - Creating an equation
  - Looking for patterns
  - Breaking the problem into smaller parts

### Step 3: Carry Out the Plan
- **Execute your strategy:** Perform calculations or logical reasoning as required by your chosen strategy.
- **Show all work:** Write down each step clearly to avoid mistakes and to make it easier to review your work.

### Step 4: Review/Check Your Work
- **Verify your solution:** Check if your solution makes sense and if it answers the question.
- **Check calculations:** Ensure all calculations are correct.

### Step 5: State the Final Answer
- **Conclude with the answer:** Clearly state the final answer, ensuring it is in the correct form as required by the problem.

Since we don't have the specifics of "Sample reasoning question 276," let's illustrate this process with a simple example problem:

**Example Problem:** Solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).

#### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We need to find the value of \( x \) that satisfies the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).

2. **Devise a Plan:**
   - We will isolate \( x \) by performing algebraic operations.

3. **Carry Out the Plan:**
   - Start by subtracting 3 from both sides of the equation:
     \[
     2x + 3 - 3 = 11 - 3
     \]
     \[
     2x = 8
     \]
   - Next, divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( x \):
     \[
     \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{8}{2}
     \]
     \[
     x = 4
     \]

4. **Review/Check Your Work:**
   - Substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation to verify:
     \[
     2(4) + 3 = 8 + 3 = 11
     \]
   - The left side equals the right side, confirming our solution is correct.

5. **State the Final Answer:**
   - The solution to the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \) is \( x = 4 \).

If you have specific details or context for "Sample reasoning question 276," please provide them, and I can tailor the solution to that particular problem.
