==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample reasoning question 276," we first need to understand what the question is asking. However, the question as presented is incomplete and lacks specific details or numerical data to work with. Therefore, I will demonstrate a general approach to solving a typical math problem by creating a hypothetical problem and solving it step by step.

Let's assume the problem is as follows:

**Problem:**  
A store sells two types of products: A and B. Product A costs $10 each, and product B costs $15 each. Last week, the store sold a total of 100 products and made $1,200 in revenue. How many of each product did the store sell?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( x \) be the number of product A sold.
   - Let \( y \) be the number of product B sold.

2. **Set Up Equations:**
   - From the problem, we know the total number of products sold is 100. Therefore, we have the equation:
     \[
     x + y = 100
     \]
   - We also know the total revenue from selling these products is $1,200. Therefore, we have the equation:
     \[
     10x + 15y = 1200
     \]

3. **Solve the System of Equations:**
   - We have the system of equations:
     \[
     \begin{align*}
     x + y &= 100 \quad \text{(Equation 1)} \\
     10x + 15y &= 1200 \quad \text{(Equation 2)}
     \end{align*}
     \]
   - Solve Equation 1 for \( y \):
     \[
     y = 100 - x
     \]
   - Substitute \( y = 100 - x \) into Equation 2:
     \[
     10x + 15(100 - x) = 1200
     \]
   - Simplify and solve for \( x \):
     \[
     10x + 1500 - 15x = 1200
     \]
     \[
     -5x + 1500 = 1200
     \]
     \[
     -5x = 1200 - 1500
     \]
     \[
     -5x = -300
     \]
     \[
     x = 60
     \]
   - Substitute \( x = 60 \) back into Equation 1 to find \( y \):
     \[
     60 + y = 100
     \]
     \[
     y = 40
     \]

4. **Verify the Solution:**
   - Check the total number of products:
     \[
     x + y = 60 + 40 = 100
     \]
   - Check the total revenue:
     \[
     10x + 15y = 10(60) + 15(40) = 600 + 600 = 1200
     \]

Both conditions are satisfied, confirming our solution is correct.

**Final Answer:**
The store sold 60 units of product A and 40 units of product B.
