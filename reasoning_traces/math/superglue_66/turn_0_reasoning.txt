==================================================

It seems like the question is asking for a solution to "Sample reasoning question 66," but without the specific details of the question, I can't provide a direct solution. However, I can guide you on how to approach a typical math problem-solving process. If you can provide the details of the question, I can give a more precise solution. Here's a general approach to solving math problems:

### Step-by-Step Problem Solving Approach

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - Read the problem carefully.
   - Identify what is being asked.
   - Determine what information is given and what needs to be found.

2. **Devise a Plan:**
   - Consider possible strategies to solve the problem. This could include:
     - Drawing a diagram.
     - Writing an equation.
     - Breaking the problem into smaller parts.
     - Looking for patterns.

3. **Carry Out the Plan:**
   - Execute the steps you have planned.
   - Perform calculations carefully.
   - Keep track of units and conversion factors if applicable.

4. **Check Your Work:**
   - Review each step to ensure accuracy.
   - Verify that the solution makes sense in the context of the problem.
   - Check calculations for errors.

5. **State the Final Answer:**
   - Clearly write down the final answer.
   - Include units if applicable.

### Example Problem

Let's apply this approach to a simple example problem:

**Problem:** If a car travels at a speed of 60 miles per hour, how far will it travel in 3 hours?

**Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We need to find the distance traveled by the car.
   - We know the speed of the car is 60 miles per hour and the time is 3 hours.

2. **Devise a Plan:**
   - Use the formula for distance: \[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]

3. **Carry Out the Plan:**
   - Substitute the given values into the formula:
     \[
     \text{Distance} = 60 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 180 \, \text{miles}
     \]

4. **Check Your Work:**
   - The units of speed (miles/hour) and time (hours) cancel appropriately, leaving miles, which is a unit of distance.
   - The calculation \( 60 \times 3 = 180 \) is correct.

5. **State the Final Answer:**
   - The car will travel 180 miles in 3 hours.

If you provide the specific details of "Sample reasoning question 66," I can apply this structured approach to solve it.
