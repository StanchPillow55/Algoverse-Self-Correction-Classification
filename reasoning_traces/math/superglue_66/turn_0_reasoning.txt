==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 66" refers to. Since the problem statement is not provided, I'll demonstrate a general approach to solving a typical math reasoning problem. Let's assume a hypothetical problem and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**

"Two trains leave a station at the same time, one heading east and the other west. The eastbound train travels at 60 miles per hour, and the westbound train travels at 75 miles per hour. How long will it take for the two trains to be 405 miles apart?"

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We have two trains starting from the same point and moving in opposite directions.
   - The eastbound train travels at 60 mph, and the westbound train travels at 75 mph.
   - We need to find the time it takes for the distance between the two trains to be 405 miles.

2. **Set Up the Equation:**
   - Since the trains are moving in opposite directions, their speeds add up when calculating the distance between them.
   - The combined speed of the two trains is \(60 \text{ mph} + 75 \text{ mph} = 135 \text{ mph}\).

3. **Use the Distance Formula:**
   - Distance = Speed Ã— Time
   - We want the distance to be 405 miles. Let \(t\) be the time in hours.
   - The equation becomes: \(135t = 405\).

4. **Solve for \(t\):**
   - Divide both sides of the equation by 135 to solve for \(t\):
   \[
   t = \frac{405}{135}
   \]

5. **Calculate the Time:**
   - Simplify the fraction:
   \[
   t = \frac{405}{135} = 3
   \]

6. **Conclusion:**
   - It will take 3 hours for the two trains to be 405 miles apart.

**Final Answer:**
The two trains will be 405 miles apart after 3 hours.
