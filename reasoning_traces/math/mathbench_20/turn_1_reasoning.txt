==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 20," let's first clarify what the problem is asking. Since the problem statement is not specific, I'll assume it involves basic arithmetic or algebra, given the context of "Sample math problem 20." 

Let's assume the problem is as follows:

**Problem:** Solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 2x + 5 = 20 \).

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Understand the Equation:**
   The equation given is \( 2x + 5 = 20 \). This is a linear equation in one variable, \( x \).

2. **Isolate the Variable:**
   To solve for \( x \), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We can do this by performing operations that will leave \( x \) by itself.

3. **Subtract 5 from Both Sides:**
   To remove the constant term on the left side, subtract 5 from both sides of the equation:
   \[
   2x + 5 - 5 = 20 - 5
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   2x = 15
   \]

4. **Divide Both Sides by 2:**
   To solve for \( x \), divide both sides of the equation by 2:
   \[
   \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{15}{2}
   \]
   Simplifying gives:
   \[
   x = \frac{15}{2}
   \]

5. **Simplify the Fraction:**
   The fraction \(\frac{15}{2}\) is already in its simplest form, but it can also be expressed as a decimal:
   \[
   x = 7.5
   \]

### Final Answer:
The solution to the equation \( 2x + 5 = 20 \) is \( x = 7.5 \).

This completes the problem-solving process. If the original problem was different, please provide more details for a specific solution.
