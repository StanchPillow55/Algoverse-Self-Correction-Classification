==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 20," we need to first understand what the problem is asking. However, the problem statement "Sample math problem 20" is not specific enough to determine the exact nature of the problem. It could refer to a variety of mathematical problems, such as solving an equation, finding a pattern, or calculating a value.

Since the problem is not explicitly defined, let's assume a hypothetical scenario where "Sample math problem 20" refers to a typical math problem involving basic arithmetic or algebra. For the sake of illustration, let's assume the problem is:

**Problem:** Solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 2x + 5 = 20 \).

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Understand the Equation:**
   The equation given is \( 2x + 5 = 20 \). This is a linear equation in one variable, \( x \).

2. **Isolate the Variable:**
   To solve for \( x \), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We can do this by performing inverse operations.

3. **Subtract 5 from Both Sides:**
   \[
   2x + 5 - 5 = 20 - 5
   \]
   Simplifying both sides, we get:
   \[
   2x = 15
   \]

4. **Divide Both Sides by 2:**
   \[
   \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{15}{2}
   \]
   Simplifying, we find:
   \[
   x = \frac{15}{2}
   \]

5. **Final Answer:**
   The solution to the equation \( 2x + 5 = 20 \) is \( x = \frac{15}{2} \).

### Verification:

To ensure the solution is correct, substitute \( x = \frac{15}{2} \) back into the original equation:

- Original equation: \( 2x + 5 = 20 \)
- Substitute \( x = \frac{15}{2} \):
  \[
  2\left(\frac{15}{2}\right) + 5 = 20
  \]
  Simplifying the left side:
  \[
  15 + 5 = 20
  \]
  \[
  20 = 20
  \]

Since both sides of the equation are equal, the solution \( x = \frac{15}{2} \) is verified.

### Conclusion:

The final answer to the assumed problem is \( x = \frac{15}{2} \). If "Sample math problem 20" refers to a different problem, please provide additional details for a more accurate solution.
