==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 20," we need to first understand what the problem is asking. However, the phrase "Sample math problem 20" is not a complete math problem. It seems to be a placeholder or a reference to a specific problem that is not provided here. 

To proceed, I'll assume that "Sample math problem 20" refers to a generic math problem that involves the number 20 in some way. Let's create a hypothetical problem involving the number 20 and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**

"Find the sum of all even numbers from 1 to 20."

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Identify the Even Numbers:**
   Even numbers are integers that are divisible by 2. From 1 to 20, the even numbers are: 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, and 20.

2. **List the Even Numbers:**
   The even numbers between 1 and 20 are: 
   \[
   2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20
   \]

3. **Calculate the Sum:**
   Add these numbers together:
   \[
   2 + 4 + 6 + 8 + 10 + 12 + 14 + 16 + 18 + 20
   \]

4. **Perform the Addition:**
   - First, pair the numbers to make the addition easier:
     \[
     (2 + 20), (4 + 18), (6 + 16), (8 + 14), (10 + 12)
     \]
   - Calculate each pair:
     \[
     22, 22, 22, 22, 22
     \]
   - Since there are 5 pairs, multiply 22 by 5:
     \[
     22 \times 5 = 110
     \]

5. **Verify the Calculation:**
   To ensure accuracy, let's add the numbers sequentially:
   \[
   2 + 4 = 6 \\
   6 + 6 = 12 \\
   12 + 8 = 20 \\
   20 + 10 = 30 \\
   30 + 12 = 42 \\
   42 + 14 = 56 \\
   56 + 16 = 72 \\
   72 + 18 = 90 \\
   90 + 20 = 110
   \]

The sum of all even numbers from 1 to 20 is indeed 110.

**Final Answer:**
The sum of all even numbers from 1 to 20 is 110.
