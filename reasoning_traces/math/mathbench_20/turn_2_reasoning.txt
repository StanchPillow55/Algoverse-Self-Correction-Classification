Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 20," we first need to understand what the problem is asking. However, the problem statement "Sample math problem 20" is not specific enough to determine the exact nature of the problem. 

Since the problem is not clearly defined, let's assume a hypothetical math problem involving the number 20. For instance, let's solve a problem where we need to find the sum of all integers from 1 to 20.

**Step-by-step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   We need to find the sum of all integers from 1 to 20. This is a straightforward arithmetic series problem.

2. **Identify the Formula:**
   The sum of the first \( n \) natural numbers can be calculated using the formula:
   \[
   S = \frac{n(n + 1)}{2}
   \]
   where \( n \) is the last number in the series.

3. **Apply the Formula:**
   In this case, \( n = 20 \). Plugging this into the formula gives:
   \[
   S = \frac{20(20 + 1)}{2}
   \]

4. **Calculate the Sum:**
   \[
   S = \frac{20 \times 21}{2}
   \]
   \[
   S = \frac{420}{2}
   \]
   \[
   S = 210
   \]

5. **Verify the Calculation:**
   To ensure the calculation is correct, let's verify by adding the numbers manually:
   \[
   1 + 2 + 3 + \ldots + 20
   \]
   Pair the numbers from the start and end:
   \[
   (1 + 20), (2 + 19), (3 + 18), \ldots, (10 + 11)
   \]
   Each pair sums to 21, and there are 10 such pairs:
   \[
   10 \times 21 = 210
   \]

**Final Answer:**
The sum of all integers from 1 to 20 is 210.
