==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to determine how many books Dolly and Pandora will read collectively.

1. **Identify the number of books each person has:**
   - Dolly has 2 books.
   - Pandora has 1 book.

2. **Determine the total number of books:**
   - Total books = Books owned by Dolly + Books owned by Pandora
   - Total books = 2 (Dolly's books) + 1 (Pandora's book) = 3 books.

3. **Understand the reading scenario:**
   - Both Dolly and Pandora read their own books.
   - Additionally, they read each other's books.

4. **Calculate the reading for each individual:**
   - **Dolly's reading:**
     - She reads her 2 books.
     - She also reads Pandora's 1 book.
     - Total books read by Dolly = 2 (her own) + 1 (Pandora's) = 3 books.
   
   - **Pandora's reading:**
     - She reads her 1 book.
     - She also reads both of Dolly's 2 books.
     - Total books read by Pandora = 1 (her own) + 2 (Dolly's) = 3 books.

5. **Calculate the total number of books read collectively:**
   - Total books read = Books read by Dolly + Books read by Pandora
   - Total books read = 3 (Dolly) + 3 (Pandora) = 6 books.

6. **Final answer:**
   - Therefore, the total number of books that Dolly and Pandora will collectively read by the end is **6 books**.
