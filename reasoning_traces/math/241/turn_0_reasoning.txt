==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to determine how many of the 72 computers sold by Mr. Lu's store were desktop computers. We know the distribution of sales among laptops, netbooks, and desktop computers.

1. **Identify the fractions of sales:**
   - Half of the sales are laptops: \( \frac{1}{2} \)
   - One-third of the sales are netbooks: \( \frac{1}{3} \)
   - The rest are desktop computers.

2. **Calculate the total fraction of laptops and netbooks:**
   - To find the total fraction of laptops and netbooks, we add the fractions:
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3}
   \]

   To add these fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 2 and 3 is 6.

   - Convert \( \frac{1}{2} \) to sixths:
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} = \frac{3}{6}
   \]
   - Convert \( \frac{1}{3} \) to sixths:
   \[
   \frac{1}{3} = \frac{2}{6}
   \]

   Now we can add them:
   \[
   \frac{3}{6} + \frac{2}{6} = \frac{5}{6}
   \]

3. **Determine the fraction of desktop computers:**
   - The fraction of sales that are desktop computers is the remainder after accounting for laptops and netbooks:
   \[
   1 - \frac{5}{6} = \frac{1}{6}
   \]

4. **Calculate the number of desktop computers sold:**
   - We know the total number of computers sold is 72. To find the number of desktop computers, we multiply the total sales by the fraction that represents desktop computers:
   \[
   \text{Number of desktop computers} = 72 \times \frac{1}{6}
   \]

   Performing the multiplication:
   \[
   72 \times \frac{1}{6} = \frac{72}{6} = 12
   \]

5. **Final Answer:**
   - Therefore, the number of desktop computers sold is \( \boxed{12} \).
