==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to determine how many books Dolly and Pandora will read collectively.

1. **Identify the number of books each person has:**
   - Dolly has 2 books.
   - Pandora has 1 book.

2. **Determine the total number of books:**
   - The total number of books is the sum of the books each person has:
     \[
     \text{Total books} = \text{Dolly's books} + \text{Pandora's books} = 2 + 1 = 3
     \]

3. **Consider the reading scenario:**
   - Dolly will read her own 2 books.
   - Dolly will also read Pandora's 1 book.
   - Therefore, Dolly reads a total of:
     \[
     \text{Dolly's total reads} = 2 + 1 = 3 \text{ books}
     \]

   - Pandora will read her own 1 book.
   - Pandora will also read both of Dolly's 2 books.
   - Therefore, Pandora reads a total of:
     \[
     \text{Pandora's total reads} = 1 + 2 = 3 \text{ books}
     \]

4. **Calculate the total number of books read:**
   - Now, we need to find the total number of books read by both Dolly and Pandora. Since they are reading the same books, we should not double-count the books.
   - The unique books being read are:
     - Dolly's 2 books
     - Pandora's 1 book
   - Thus, the total number of unique books read is still 3.

5. **Final answer:**
   - Therefore, the total number of books that Dolly and Pandora will collectively read by the end is:
     \[
     \boxed{3}
     \]
