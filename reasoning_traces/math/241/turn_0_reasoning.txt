To solve this problem, we need to determine how many desktop computers Mr. Lu's store sold last month. We know the total number of computers sold and the proportions of laptops and netbooks sold. Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Identify the total number of computers sold:**
   - Mr. Lu's store sold a total of 72 computers.

2. **Determine the proportion of laptops sold:**
   - Half of the sales are laptops. Therefore, the number of laptops sold is:
     \[
     \frac{1}{2} \times 72 = 36
     \]

3. **Determine the proportion of netbooks sold:**
   - One-third of the sales are netbooks. Therefore, the number of netbooks sold is:
     \[
     \frac{1}{3} \times 72 = 24
     \]

4. **Calculate the number of desktop computers sold:**
   - The rest of the computers sold are desktop computers. To find this number, we subtract the number of laptops and netbooks from the total number of computers sold:
   \[
   \text{Number of desktop computers} = 72 - (36 + 24)
   \]

5. **Perform the subtraction:**
   - First, add the number of laptops and netbooks:
     \[
     36 + 24 = 60
     \]
   - Then, subtract this sum from the total number of computers:
     \[
     72 - 60 = 12
     \]

Therefore, Mr. Lu's store sold 12 desktop computers last month.

**Final Answer:**
12 desktop computers
