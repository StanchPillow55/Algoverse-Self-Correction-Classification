Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we first need to understand what "Sample math problem 374" refers to. Since the problem is not explicitly stated, I'll create a hypothetical math problem that could be labeled as "Sample math problem 374" and solve it step by step.

Let's assume "Sample math problem 374" is as follows:

**Problem:**
Calculate the sum of the first 374 positive integers.

**Solution:**

To find the sum of the first \( n \) positive integers, we can use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series:

\[
S_n = \frac{n(n + 1)}{2}
\]

where \( S_n \) is the sum of the first \( n \) integers, and \( n \) is the number of terms.

In this case, \( n = 374 \).

Substitute \( n = 374 \) into the formula:

\[
S_{374} = \frac{374(374 + 1)}{2}
\]

Calculate \( 374 + 1 \):

\[
374 + 1 = 375
\]

Now substitute back into the formula:

\[
S_{374} = \frac{374 \times 375}{2}
\]

Calculate \( 374 \times 375 \):

\[
374 \times 375 = 140250
\]

Now divide by 2 to find the sum:

\[
S_{374} = \frac{140250}{2} = 70125
\]

Thus, the sum of the first 374 positive integers is \( 70125 \).

**Final Answer:**

The sum of the first 374 positive integers is \( 70125 \).
