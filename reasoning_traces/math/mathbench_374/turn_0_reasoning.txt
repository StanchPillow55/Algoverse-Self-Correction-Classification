==================================================

To solve the problem, we first need to understand what "Sample math problem 374" refers to. Since no specific details about the problem are provided, I'll assume this is a placeholder for a generic math problem. Let's create a sample problem and solve it step by step.

### Sample Math Problem 374:
**Problem:** Solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 2x + 5 = 17 \).

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Understand the Equation:**
   The equation given is \( 2x + 5 = 17 \). This is a linear equation in one variable, \( x \).

2. **Isolate the Variable:**
   To solve for \( x \), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We can do this by performing inverse operations.

3. **Subtract 5 from Both Sides:**
   \[
   2x + 5 - 5 = 17 - 5
   \]
   Simplifying both sides, we get:
   \[
   2x = 12
   \]

4. **Divide Both Sides by 2:**
   \[
   \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{12}{2}
   \]
   Simplifying both sides, we find:
   \[
   x = 6
   \]

5. **Verify the Solution:**
   Substitute \( x = 6 \) back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies the equation:
   \[
   2(6) + 5 = 17
   \]
   Simplifying the left side:
   \[
   12 + 5 = 17
   \]
   Since both sides of the equation are equal, \( x = 6 \) is indeed the correct solution.

### Final Answer:
The solution to the equation \( 2x + 5 = 17 \) is \( x = 6 \).
