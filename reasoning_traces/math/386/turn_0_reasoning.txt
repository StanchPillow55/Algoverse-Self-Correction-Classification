Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To find Wilson's current math grade, we need to calculate the average of his 5 test scores. The test scores he received are: 65, 94, 81, 86, and 74.

### Step 1: Calculate the sum of the test scores.

We add all the test scores together:

\[
65 + 94 + 81 + 86 + 74
\]

Calculating this step-by-step:

1. \( 65 + 94 = 159 \)
2. \( 159 + 81 = 240 \)
3. \( 240 + 86 = 326 \)
4. \( 326 + 74 = 400 \)

So, the total sum of the test scores is:

\[
400
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the average of the test scores.

To find the average, we divide the total sum of the test scores by the number of tests. Since there are 5 test scores, we calculate:

\[
\text{Average} = \frac{\text{Total Sum}}{\text{Number of Tests}} = \frac{400}{5}
\]

Calculating this gives:

\[
\frac{400}{5} = 80
\]

### Conclusion

Wilson's current math grade, which is the average of his test scores, is:

\[
\boxed{80}
\]

Since Wilson needs a grade of 80 or higher to have the car for the weekend, he meets the requirement with his current math grade of 80.
