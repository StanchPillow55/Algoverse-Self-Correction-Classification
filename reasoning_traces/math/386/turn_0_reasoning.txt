To determine how much money Daniela spends during the sale, we need to calculate the discounted prices for the shoes and the dress, and then sum these amounts.

### Step 1: Calculate the discount on the shoes

1. **Original price of one pair of shoes**: $50
2. **Number of pairs of shoes**: 2
3. **Total original price for shoes**: 
   \[
   \text{Total original price for shoes} = 2 \times 50 = 100 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Discount on shoes**: 40% off
   - To find the discount amount:
   \[
   \text{Discount amount} = 40\% \text{ of } 100 = 0.40 \times 100 = 40 \text{ dollars}
   \]

5. **Price after discount for shoes**:
   \[
   \text{Price after discount} = \text{Total original price} - \text{Discount amount} = 100 - 40 = 60 \text{ dollars}
   \]

### Step 2: Calculate the discount on the dress

1. **Original price of the dress**: $100
2. **Discount on dress**: 20% off
   - To find the discount amount:
   \[
   \text{Discount amount} = 20\% \text{ of } 100 = 0.20 \times 100 = 20 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Price after discount for the dress**:
   \[
   \text{Price after discount} = \text{Original price} - \text{Discount amount} = 100 - 20 = 80 \text{ dollars}
   \]

### Step 3: Calculate the total amount spent

Now we add the discounted prices of the shoes and the dress:

1. **Total spent on shoes**: $60
2. **Total spent on dress**: $80

3. **Total amount spent**:
   \[
   \text{Total amount spent} = \text{Total spent on shoes} + \text{Total spent on dress} = 60 + 80 = 140 \text{ dollars}
   \]

### Final Answer

Therefore, the total amount of money Daniela spends is:
\[
\boxed{140 \text{ dollars}}
\]
