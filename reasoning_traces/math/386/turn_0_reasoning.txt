==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost Daniela spends on the shoes and the dress after applying the respective discounts.

### Step 1: Calculate the discount on the shoes
- The original price of one pair of shoes is $50.
- The discount on shoes is 40%.

First, calculate the discount amount for one pair of shoes:
\[ \text{Discount on one pair of shoes} = 50 \times \frac{40}{100} = 50 \times 0.4 = 20 \]

Now, subtract the discount from the original price to find the sale price of one pair of shoes:
\[ \text{Sale price of one pair of shoes} = 50 - 20 = 30 \]

Since Daniela buys 2 pairs of shoes, calculate the total cost for the shoes:
\[ \text{Total cost for 2 pairs of shoes} = 2 \times 30 = 60 \]

### Step 2: Calculate the discount on the dress
- The original price of the dress is $100.
- The discount on the dress is 20%.

Calculate the discount amount for the dress:
\[ \text{Discount on the dress} = 100 \times \frac{20}{100} = 100 \times 0.2 = 20 \]

Subtract the discount from the original price to find the sale price of the dress:
\[ \text{Sale price of the dress} = 100 - 20 = 80 \]

### Step 3: Calculate the total amount spent
Add the total cost for the shoes and the sale price of the dress to find the total amount Daniela spends:
\[ \text{Total amount spent} = 60 + 80 = 140 \]

### Final Answer
Daniela spends a total of $140.
