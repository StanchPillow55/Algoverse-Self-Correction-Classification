==================================================

To determine how much money Daniela spends during the sale, we need to calculate the discounted prices for the shoes and the dress, and then sum these amounts.

### Step 1: Calculate the discount on the shoes

1. **Original price of one pair of shoes**: $50
2. **Discount on shoes**: 40%

To find the discount amount on one pair of shoes, we calculate:
\[
\text{Discount on one pair of shoes} = \text{Original price} \times \text{Discount rate}
\]
\[
\text{Discount on one pair of shoes} = 50 \times 0.40 = 20
\]

Now, we subtract the discount from the original price to find the sale price of one pair of shoes:
\[
\text{Sale price of one pair of shoes} = \text{Original price} - \text{Discount}
\]
\[
\text{Sale price of one pair of shoes} = 50 - 20 = 30
\]

Since Daniela buys 2 pairs of shoes, we multiply the sale price of one pair by 2:
\[
\text{Total cost for shoes} = \text{Sale price of one pair} \times 2
\]
\[
\text{Total cost for shoes} = 30 \times 2 = 60
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the discount on the dress

1. **Original price of the dress**: $100
2. **Discount on dresses**: 20%

To find the discount amount on the dress, we calculate:
\[
\text{Discount on the dress} = \text{Original price} \times \text{Discount rate}
\]
\[
\text{Discount on the dress} = 100 \times 0.20 = 20
\]

Now, we subtract the discount from the original price to find the sale price of the dress:
\[
\text{Sale price of the dress} = \text{Original price} - \text{Discount}
\]
\[
\text{Sale price of the dress} = 100 - 20 = 80
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the total amount spent

Now we add the total cost of the shoes and the sale price of the dress:
\[
\text{Total amount spent} = \text{Total cost for shoes} + \text{Sale price of the dress}
\]
\[
\text{Total amount spent} = 60 + 80 = 140
\]

### Final Answer

Daniela spends a total of **$140**.
