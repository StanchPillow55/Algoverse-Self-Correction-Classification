To determine how much Janet makes every day at the farmers' market from selling her duck eggs, we will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of eggs laid by Janet's ducks per day.**
   - Janet's ducks lay **16 eggs** per day.

2. **Determine how many eggs Janet consumes for breakfast.**
   - Janet eats **3 eggs** for breakfast every morning.

3. **Calculate how many eggs Janet uses for baking muffins.**
   - Janet bakes muffins using **4 eggs** each day.

4. **Calculate the total number of eggs consumed by Janet each day.**
   - Total eggs consumed = Eggs for breakfast + Eggs for muffins
   - Total eggs consumed = \(3 + 4 = 7\) eggs

5. **Determine how many eggs are left after Janet's consumption.**
   - Eggs remaining = Total eggs laid - Total eggs consumed
   - Eggs remaining = \(16 - 7 = 9\) eggs

6. **Calculate how much Janet makes from selling the remaining eggs.**
   - Janet sells the remaining eggs at **$2 per egg**.
   - Total earnings from selling eggs = Eggs remaining Ã— Price per egg
   - Total earnings = \(9 \times 2 = 18\) dollars

Thus, Janet makes **$18** every day at the farmers' market.

**Final Answer: $18**
