==================================================

Natalia sold clips to 48 of her friends in April.

In May, she sold half as many clips as she did in April. To find out how many clips she sold in May, we divide the number of clips she sold in April by 2.

48 รท 2 = 24

So, Natalia sold 24 clips in May.

To find out how many clips Natalia sold altogether in April and May, we add the number of clips she sold in April to the number of clips she sold in May.

48 + 24 = 72

Therefore, Natalia sold 72 clips altogether in April and May.
