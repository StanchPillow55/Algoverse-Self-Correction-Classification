To solve the problem, we need to determine how many clips Natalia sold in both April and May.

1. **Determine the number of clips sold in April**:
   - According to the problem, Natalia sold clips to 48 of her friends in April.
   - Therefore, the number of clips sold in April is:
     \[
     \text{Clips sold in April} = 48
     \]

2. **Determine the number of clips sold in May**:
   - The problem states that Natalia sold half as many clips in May as she did in April.
   - To find the number of clips sold in May, we calculate half of the clips sold in April:
     \[
     \text{Clips sold in May} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Clips sold in April} = \frac{1}{2} \times 48
     \]
   - Performing the calculation:
     \[
     \text{Clips sold in May} = \frac{48}{2} = 24
     \]

3. **Calculate the total number of clips sold in April and May**:
   - Now, we need to find the total number of clips sold by adding the clips sold in April and May:
     \[
     \text{Total clips sold} = \text{Clips sold in April} + \text{Clips sold in May} = 48 + 24
     \]
   - Performing the addition:
     \[
     \text{Total clips sold} = 48 + 24 = 72
     \]

4. **Final answer**:
   - Therefore, the total number of clips that Natalia sold altogether in April and May is:
     \[
     \boxed{72}
     \]
