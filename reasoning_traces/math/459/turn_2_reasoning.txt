==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine the current cost of one lawnmower and then calculate the total cost for four lawnmowers.

### Step 1: Understand the Relationship Between Past and Present Costs

The problem states that a year ago, the cost of a lawnmower was \( \frac{2}{5} \) times less than the current cost. This can be a bit confusing, so let's clarify what this means.

If something is \( \frac{2}{5} \) times less than another value, it means the original value is \( 1 - \frac{2}{5} = \frac{3}{5} \) of the current value. Therefore, the cost a year ago was \( \frac{3}{5} \) of the current cost.

### Step 2: Set Up the Equation

Let \( C \) be the current cost of one lawnmower. According to the problem, the cost a year ago was $1800. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

\[
\frac{3}{5}C = 1800
\]

### Step 3: Solve for the Current Cost

To find \( C \), we need to solve the equation:

\[
C = \frac{1800 \times 5}{3}
\]

First, calculate \( 1800 \times 5 \):

\[
1800 \times 5 = 9000
\]

Now, divide by 3:

\[
C = \frac{9000}{3} = 3000
\]

So, the current cost of one lawnmower is $3000.

### Step 4: Calculate the Cost for 4 Lawnmowers

Now that we know the current cost of one lawnmower is $3000, we can find the cost for 4 lawnmowers:

\[
4 \times 3000 = 12000
\]

### Final Answer

The total cost for Mr. Lucian to buy 4 lawnmowers is $12,000.
