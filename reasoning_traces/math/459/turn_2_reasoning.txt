To solve the problem, we need to determine the current cost of a lawnmower based on the information provided about its cost a year ago.

1. **Understanding the relationship between the costs**: 
   The problem states that the cost of the lawnmower a year ago was \( \frac{2}{5} \) times less than the current cost. This means that the cost a year ago is a fraction of the current cost.

2. **Setting up the equation**:
   Let \( C \) be the current cost of the lawnmower. According to the problem, the cost a year ago (which is $1800) can be expressed in terms of the current cost:
   \[
   1800 = C - \frac{2}{5}C
   \]
   Simplifying the right side:
   \[
   1800 = C \left(1 - \frac{2}{5}\right)
   \]
   \[
   1800 = C \left(\frac{5}{5} - \frac{2}{5}\right)
   \]
   \[
   1800 = C \left(\frac{3}{5}\right)
   \]

3. **Solving for the current cost \( C \)**:
   To isolate \( C \), we can multiply both sides of the equation by the reciprocal of \( \frac{3}{5} \):
   \[
   C = 1800 \times \frac{5}{3}
   \]
   Calculating the right side:
   \[
   C = 1800 \times \frac{5}{3} = 1800 \times 1.6667 = 3000
   \]

4. **Calculating the cost for 4 lawnmowers**:
   Now that we have the current cost of one lawnmower as $3000, we can find the total cost for 4 lawnmowers:
   \[
   \text{Total cost for 4 lawnmowers} = 4 \times 3000
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total cost for 4 lawnmowers} = 12000
   \]

5. **Final answer**:
   Therefore, the total cost for Mr. Lucian to buy 4 lawnmowers is \(\boxed{12000}\).
