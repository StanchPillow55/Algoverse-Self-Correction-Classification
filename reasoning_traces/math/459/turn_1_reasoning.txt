To solve the problem, we need to first understand the relationship between the cost of the lawnmower a year ago and its current cost.

1. **Identify the cost a year ago**: 
   The problem states that the cost of the lawnmower a year ago was $1800.

2. **Understanding the phrase "2/5 times less"**: 
   The phrase "2/5 times less" can be a bit confusing. It typically means that the current cost is more than the cost a year ago. To clarify, if the current cost is \( C \), then the cost a year ago is \( C - \frac{2}{5}C \). 

   This can be simplified as:
   \[
   C - \frac{2}{5}C = \frac{3}{5}C
   \]
   Therefore, we can set up the equation:
   \[
   \frac{3}{5}C = 1800
   \]

3. **Solve for the current cost \( C \)**:
   To find \( C \), we can rearrange the equation:
   \[
   C = 1800 \times \frac{5}{3}
   \]
   Now, we calculate \( C \):
   \[
   C = 1800 \times \frac{5}{3} = 1800 \times 1.6667 = 3000
   \]

4. **Calculate the cost for 4 lawnmowers**:
   Now that we know the current cost of one lawnmower is $3000, we can find the total cost for 4 lawnmowers:
   \[
   \text{Total cost for 4 lawnmowers} = 4 \times 3000 = 12000
   \]

5. **Final answer**:
   Therefore, the total cost for Mr. Lucian to buy 4 lawnmowers is:
   \[
   \boxed{12000}
   \]
