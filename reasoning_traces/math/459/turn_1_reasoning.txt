==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine the current cost of a lawnmower and then calculate the total cost for Mr. Lucian to buy four of them.

### Step 1: Understand the relationship between past and current cost

The problem states that a year ago, the cost of a lawnmower was \( \frac{2}{5} \) times less than the current cost. This can be a bit tricky to interpret, so let's break it down:

- If something is \( \frac{2}{5} \) times less, it means the past cost is \( 1 - \frac{2}{5} = \frac{3}{5} \) of the current cost.

Let \( C \) be the current cost of a lawnmower. According to the problem, the cost a year ago was $1800. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

\[
\frac{3}{5}C = 1800
\]

### Step 2: Solve for the current cost \( C \)

To find \( C \), we solve the equation:

\[
C = \frac{1800 \times 5}{3}
\]

Calculating the right-hand side:

\[
1800 \times 5 = 9000
\]

\[
C = \frac{9000}{3} = 3000
\]

So, the current cost of a lawnmower is $3000.

### Step 3: Calculate the cost for 4 lawnmowers

Now that we know the current cost of one lawnmower is $3000, we can find the total cost for 4 lawnmowers:

\[
4 \times 3000 = 12000
\]

### Conclusion

The total cost for Mr. Lucian to buy 4 lawnmowers at the current price is $12,000.

**Final Answer: $12,000**
