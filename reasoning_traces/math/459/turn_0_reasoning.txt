To solve this problem, we need to determine the current cost of one lawnmower and then calculate the cost for four lawnmowers.

### Step 1: Understand the relationship between past and current cost

The problem states that the cost of a lawnmower a year ago was \(\frac{2}{5}\) times less than the cost it is now. This can be interpreted as follows:

- Let \( C \) be the current cost of the lawnmower.
- A year ago, the cost was $1800.

The phrase "\(\frac{2}{5}\) times less" can be interpreted as the past cost being \(\frac{3}{5}\) of the current cost. This is because if something is \(\frac{2}{5}\) times less, it means you subtract \(\frac{2}{5}\) of the current cost from the full cost, leaving \(\frac{3}{5}\) of the current cost.

### Step 2: Set up the equation

Given:
\[ \text{Past Cost} = \frac{3}{5} \times \text{Current Cost} \]

Substitute the known past cost:
\[ 1800 = \frac{3}{5} \times C \]

### Step 3: Solve for the current cost \( C \)

To find \( C \), multiply both sides of the equation by \(\frac{5}{3}\) to isolate \( C \):

\[ C = 1800 \times \frac{5}{3} \]

Calculate:
\[ C = 1800 \times \frac{5}{3} = 1800 \times 1.6667 \]

\[ C = 3000 \]

So, the current cost of one lawnmower is $3000.

### Step 4: Calculate the cost for 4 lawnmowers

Now that we know the current cost of one lawnmower is $3000, we can find the cost for 4 lawnmowers:

\[ \text{Cost for 4 lawnmowers} = 4 \times 3000 \]

\[ \text{Cost for 4 lawnmowers} = 12000 \]

### Final Answer

The cost for Mr. Lucian to buy 4 lawnmowers is $12,000.
