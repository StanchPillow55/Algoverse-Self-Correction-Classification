To determine how many trips the farmer needs to transport all the feed, we first need to calculate the total weight of each type of feed he is buying and then sum these weights to find the overall total. Finally, we will divide this total weight by the truck's carrying capacity to find out how many trips are required.

### Step 1: Calculate the total weight of each type of feed

1. **Sugar Cubes**:
   - The farmer buys 2 boxes of sugar cubes, each weighing 1 pound.
   - Total weight of sugar cubes = \(2 \times 1 = 2\) pounds.

2. **Carrots**:
   - The farmer buys 4 bags of carrots, each weighing 12 pounds.
   - Total weight of carrots = \(4 \times 12 = 48\) pounds.

3. **Hay**:
   - The farmer buys 42 bales of hay, each weighing 75 pounds.
   - Total weight of hay = \(42 \times 75 = 3150\) pounds.

4. **Oats**:
   - The farmer buys 20 sacks of oats, each weighing 65 pounds.
   - Total weight of oats = \(20 \times 65 = 1300\) pounds.

### Step 2: Sum the total weights

Now, we will add all the weights together to find the total weight of the feed:

\[
\text{Total weight} = \text{Weight of sugar cubes} + \text{Weight of carrots} + \text{Weight of hay} + \text{Weight of oats}
\]

Substituting the values we calculated:

\[
\text{Total weight} = 2 + 48 + 3150 + 1300
\]

Calculating this step by step:

\[
2 + 48 = 50
\]
\[
50 + 3150 = 3200
\]
\[
3200 + 1300 = 4500
\]

Thus, the total weight of all the feed is **4500 pounds**.

### Step 3: Calculate the number of trips required

The truck can carry 2250 pounds at a time. To find the number of trips needed, we divide the total weight by the truck's capacity:

\[
\text{Number of trips} = \frac{\text{Total weight}}{\text{Truck capacity}} = \frac{4500}{2250}
\]

Calculating this gives:

\[
\frac{4500}{2250} = 2
\]

### Final Answer

The farmer needs **2 trips** to transport all the feed.
