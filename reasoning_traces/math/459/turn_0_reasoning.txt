To solve the problem, we need to determine the current cost of a lawnmower based on the information given about its cost a year ago.

1. **Understanding the relationship between past and current costs**:
   - We know that a year ago, the cost of the lawnmower was $1800.
   - The problem states that this cost was \( \frac{2}{5} \) times less than the current cost. 

2. **Setting up the equation**:
   - Let \( C \) be the current cost of the lawnmower.
   - According to the problem, the cost a year ago ($1800) is \( \frac{2}{5} \) times less than the current cost. This means:
     \[
     1800 = C - \frac{2}{5}C
     \]
   - Simplifying the right side:
     \[
     1800 = C \left(1 - \frac{2}{5}\right)
     \]
   - The fraction \( 1 - \frac{2}{5} \) can be calculated as follows:
     \[
     1 - \frac{2}{5} = \frac{5}{5} - \frac{2}{5} = \frac{3}{5}
     \]
   - Therefore, we can rewrite the equation as:
     \[
     1800 = C \cdot \frac{3}{5}
     \]

3. **Solving for the current cost \( C \)**:
   - To isolate \( C \), we multiply both sides by the reciprocal of \( \frac{3}{5} \), which is \( \frac{5}{3} \):
     \[
     C = 1800 \cdot \frac{5}{3}
     \]
   - Performing the multiplication:
     \[
     C = 1800 \cdot \frac{5}{3} = 1800 \cdot 1.6667 = 3000
     \]

4. **Calculating the total cost for 4 lawnmowers**:
   - Now that we have the current cost of one lawnmower, which is \( C = 3000 \), we can find the cost for 4 lawnmowers:
     \[
     \text{Total cost for 4 lawnmowers} = 4 \cdot C = 4 \cdot 3000
     \]
   - Performing the multiplication:
     \[
     \text{Total cost for 4 lawnmowers} = 12000
     \]

5. **Final answer**:
   - Therefore, the total cost for Mr. Lucian to buy 4 lawnmowers is \( \boxed{12000} \).
