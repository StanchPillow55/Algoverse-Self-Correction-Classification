Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve "Sample math problem 89," we first need to understand what the problem entails. Since the problem is not explicitly stated, let's assume it involves a typical math problem scenario. For the sake of this exercise, let's create a hypothetical problem and solve it.

**Hypothetical Problem:**
Calculate the sum of the first 89 positive integers.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   We need to find the sum of the first 89 positive integers. These integers are consecutive numbers starting from 1 and ending at 89.

2. **Formula for the Sum of Consecutive Integers:**
   The sum of the first \( n \) positive integers can be calculated using the formula:
   \[
   S = \frac{n(n + 1)}{2}
   \]
   where \( S \) is the sum and \( n \) is the number of terms.

3. **Substitute the Given Value:**
   In this problem, \( n = 89 \). Substitute 89 into the formula:
   \[
   S = \frac{89(89 + 1)}{2}
   \]

4. **Calculate the Expression:**
   - First, calculate \( 89 + 1 \):
     \[
     89 + 1 = 90
     \]
   - Next, calculate the product \( 89 \times 90 \):
     \[
     89 \times 90 = 8010
     \]
   - Finally, divide the product by 2 to find the sum:
     \[
     S = \frac{8010}{2} = 4005
     \]

5. **Conclusion:**
   The sum of the first 89 positive integers is 4005.

**Final Answer:**
The sum of the first 89 positive integers is 4005.
