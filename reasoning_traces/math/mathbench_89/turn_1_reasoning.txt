==================================================

To solve the problem, we first need to understand what "Sample math problem 89" refers to. Since there is no specific problem statement provided, I'll create a hypothetical math problem labeled as "Sample math problem 89" and solve it step by step.

**Sample Math Problem 89:**

Calculate the value of \( x \) in the equation:

\[ 3x + 5 = 2x + 9 \]

**Step-by-step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Equation:**
   The equation given is a linear equation in one variable, \( x \). Our goal is to solve for \( x \).

2. **Isolate the Variable:**
   To solve for \( x \), we need to get all terms involving \( x \) on one side of the equation and constant terms on the other side.

   Start by subtracting \( 2x \) from both sides of the equation to eliminate \( x \) from the right side:

   \[
   3x + 5 - 2x = 2x + 9 - 2x
   \]

   Simplifying both sides gives:

   \[
   x + 5 = 9
   \]

3. **Solve for \( x \):**
   Next, subtract 5 from both sides to isolate \( x \):

   \[
   x + 5 - 5 = 9 - 5
   \]

   Simplifying both sides gives:

   \[
   x = 4
   \]

4. **Verify the Solution:**
   Substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies the equation:

   Original equation: \( 3x + 5 = 2x + 9 \)

   Substitute \( x = 4 \):

   \[
   3(4) + 5 = 2(4) + 9
   \]

   Calculate both sides:

   \[
   12 + 5 = 8 + 9
   \]

   \[
   17 = 17
   \]

   Since both sides are equal, \( x = 4 \) is indeed the correct solution.

**Final Answer:**

The value of \( x \) is \( 4 \).
