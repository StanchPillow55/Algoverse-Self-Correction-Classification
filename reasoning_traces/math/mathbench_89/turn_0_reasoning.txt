It seems like the problem statement is incomplete or unclear. "Sample math problem 89" doesn't provide enough information to understand what the problem is asking. However, I can guide you through a generic approach to solving math problems, or if you have a specific type of problem in mind (e.g., algebra, geometry, calculus), please provide more details or clarify the problem statement.

In general, here's how you might approach solving a math problem:

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - Read the problem carefully.
   - Identify what is being asked.
   - Determine what information is given and what is unknown.

2. **Devise a Plan:**
   - Think about the strategies you can use to solve the problem. This might include:
     - Drawing a diagram.
     - Writing an equation.
     - Breaking the problem into smaller parts.
     - Looking for patterns.

3. **Carry Out the Plan:**
   - Execute your chosen strategy step by step.
   - Perform calculations carefully.
   - Keep track of your work and ensure each step logically follows from the previous one.

4. **Review/Check Your Work:**
   - Verify your solution by checking if it satisfies the conditions of the problem.
   - Consider if there is another way to solve the problem that might be more efficient or insightful.
