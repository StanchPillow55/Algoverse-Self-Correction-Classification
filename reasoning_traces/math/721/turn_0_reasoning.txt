==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to calculate the total number of taps Helga makes with both feet over the 5 minutes of dancing, taking into account the different tap rates for the two scenarios (arms raised and arms at her sides).

### Step 1: Calculate the taps when arms are at her sides
When Helga has her arms at her sides, she taps her right foot at a rate of 300 taps per minute and her left foot at a rate of 250 taps per minute. 

**Total taps per minute with arms at her sides:**
- Right foot: 300 taps/minute
- Left foot: 250 taps/minute

**Combined taps per minute:**
\[
300 + 250 = 550 \text{ taps/minute}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the total taps for the first 3 minutes
Helga dances for a total of 5 minutes, but she has her arms raised for only 2 minutes. Therefore, she has her arms at her sides for the remaining 3 minutes.

**Total taps for 3 minutes:**
\[
550 \text{ taps/minute} \times 3 \text{ minutes} = 1650 \text{ taps}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the taps when arms are raised
When Helga raises her arms, she taps each foot at a rate of 200 taps per minute.

**Total taps per minute with arms raised:**
- Right foot: 200 taps/minute
- Left foot: 200 taps/minute

**Combined taps per minute:**
\[
200 + 200 = 400 \text{ taps/minute}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the total taps for the 2 minutes with arms raised
**Total taps for 2 minutes:**
\[
400 \text{ taps/minute} \times 2 \text{ minutes} = 800 \text{ taps}
\]

### Step 5: Combine the total taps
Now, we add the total taps from both scenarios to find the overall total.

**Total taps:**
\[
1650 \text{ taps (arms at sides)} + 800 \text{ taps (arms raised)} = 2450 \text{ taps}
\]

### Final Answer
The combined total number of times that Helga taps both of her feet during the 5 minutes of dancing is:
\[
\boxed{2450}
\]
