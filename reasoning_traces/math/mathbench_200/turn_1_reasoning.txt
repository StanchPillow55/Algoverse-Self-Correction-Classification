==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 200," we need to first understand what the problem is asking. However, the problem statement provided is not clear or specific. It seems to be a placeholder or an incomplete question. Therefore, I will assume a hypothetical math problem that involves the number 200 and solve it step by step.

Let's assume the problem is as follows:

**Problem:** What is the sum of all positive divisors of 200?

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Find the prime factorization of 200.**

   To find the prime factorization, we divide 200 by the smallest prime number and continue dividing the quotient by prime numbers until we reach 1.

   - 200 is even, so divide by 2:  
     \( 200 \div 2 = 100 \)

   - 100 is even, so divide by 2 again:  
     \( 100 \div 2 = 50 \)

   - 50 is even, so divide by 2 again:  
     \( 50 \div 2 = 25 \)

   - 25 is not even, so divide by the next smallest prime, which is 5:  
     \( 25 \div 5 = 5 \)

   - Finally, divide by 5 again:  
     \( 5 \div 5 = 1 \)

   So, the prime factorization of 200 is \( 2^3 \times 5^2 \).

2. **Use the formula for the sum of divisors.**

   The sum of the divisors of a number \( n = p_1^{k_1} \times p_2^{k_2} \times \ldots \times p_m^{k_m} \) is given by:
   \[
   \sigma(n) = (1 + p_1 + p_1^2 + \ldots + p_1^{k_1})(1 + p_2 + p_2^2 + \ldots + p_2^{k_2}) \ldots (1 + p_m + p_m^2 + \ldots + p_m^{k_m})
   \]

   For 200, with \( 2^3 \) and \( 5^2 \), the sum of divisors is:
   \[
   \sigma(200) = (1 + 2 + 2^2 + 2^3)(1 + 5 + 5^2)
   \]

   Calculate each part:

   - \( 1 + 2 + 4 + 8 = 15 \)
   - \( 1 + 5 + 25 = 31 \)

   Multiply these results:
   \[
   \sigma(200) = 15 \times 31
   \]

3. **Calculate the final product.**

   \[
   15 \times 31 = 465
   \]

Therefore, the sum of all positive divisors of 200 is 465.

**Final Answer:** The sum of all positive divisors of 200 is 465.
