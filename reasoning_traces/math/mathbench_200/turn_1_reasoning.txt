==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 200," we need to first understand what the problem is asking. However, the problem statement is incomplete as it only states "Sample math problem 200" without any specific details or context. 

Since the problem is not clearly defined, I will assume that "Sample math problem 200" is a placeholder for a specific math problem. To proceed, let's create a hypothetical math problem that involves the number 200 and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**
Calculate the sum of all even numbers from 1 to 200.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Identify the Sequence of Even Numbers:**
   Even numbers between 1 and 200 are 2, 4, 6, ..., 200. This is an arithmetic sequence where the first term \( a_1 = 2 \) and the common difference \( d = 2 \).

2. **Find the Number of Terms in the Sequence:**
   The general formula for the \( n \)-th term of an arithmetic sequence is:
   \[
   a_n = a_1 + (n-1) \cdot d
   \]
   We need to find \( n \) such that \( a_n = 200 \):
   \[
   200 = 2 + (n-1) \cdot 2
   \]
   \[
   200 = 2 + 2n - 2
   \]
   \[
   200 = 2n
   \]
   \[
   n = 100
   \]
   So, there are 100 even numbers from 1 to 200.

3. **Calculate the Sum of the Sequence:**
   The sum \( S_n \) of the first \( n \) terms of an arithmetic sequence is given by:
   \[
   S_n = \frac{n}{2} \cdot (a_1 + a_n)
   \]
   Substituting the known values:
   \[
   S_{100} = \frac{100}{2} \cdot (2 + 200)
   \]
   \[
   S_{100} = 50 \cdot 202
   \]
   \[
   S_{100} = 10100
   \]

**Final Answer:**
The sum of all even numbers from 1 to 200 is 10,100.
