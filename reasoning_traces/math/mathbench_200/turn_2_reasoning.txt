==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 200," we need to first understand what the problem is asking. However, the problem statement is incomplete or unclear as it stands. Let's assume that "Sample math problem 200" refers to a specific math problem labeled as number 200 in a textbook or a set of problems. Without additional context, I'll create a hypothetical problem that could be labeled as "Sample math problem 200" and solve it.

Let's assume the problem is as follows:

**Problem 200:**
Calculate the sum of the first 200 positive integers.

To solve this problem, we can use the formula for the sum of the first \( n \) positive integers:

\[
S_n = \frac{n(n + 1)}{2}
\]

where \( S_n \) is the sum of the first \( n \) positive integers.

In this case, \( n = 200 \). Plugging this into the formula, we get:

\[
S_{200} = \frac{200(200 + 1)}{2}
\]

First, calculate \( 200 + 1 \):

\[
200 + 1 = 201
\]

Next, calculate the product of 200 and 201:

\[
200 \times 201 = 40200
\]

Now, divide 40200 by 2 to find the sum:

\[
S_{200} = \frac{40200}{2} = 20100
\]

Therefore, the sum of the first 200 positive integers is 20,100.

**Final Answer:**
The sum of the first 200 positive integers is 20,100.
