==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 200," we need to first understand what the problem is asking. However, the problem statement is incomplete or unclear. Since "Sample math problem 200" doesn't provide specific details or numbers to work with, I'll assume this is a placeholder or a request to solve a generic math problem involving the number 200. 

Let's consider a few possible interpretations of "Sample math problem 200" and solve them:

### Interpretation 1: Basic Arithmetic with 200
Let's assume the problem is to perform a basic arithmetic operation with the number 200. For example, we might be asked to find the sum of 200 and another number, say 50.

**Problem:** What is 200 + 50?

**Solution:**
\[ 200 + 50 = 250 \]

**Final Answer:** 250

### Interpretation 2: Factorization of 200
Another possible interpretation is to factor the number 200 into its prime factors.

**Problem:** What are the prime factors of 200?

**Solution:**
1. Start by dividing 200 by the smallest prime number, which is 2.
   \[ 200 \div 2 = 100 \]
2. Divide 100 by 2 again.
   \[ 100 \div 2 = 50 \]
3. Divide 50 by 2 once more.
   \[ 50 \div 2 = 25 \]
4. Now, 25 is not divisible by 2. The next smallest prime number is 3, but 25 is not divisible by 3 either. Try 5.
   \[ 25 \div 5 = 5 \]
5. Finally, divide 5 by 5.
   \[ 5 \div 5 = 1 \]

The prime factors of 200 are \( 2^3 \times 5^2 \).

**Final Answer:** \( 2^3 \times 5^2 \)

### Interpretation 3: Solving an Equation Involving 200
Let's assume the problem involves solving a simple equation where 200 is part of the equation. For example, solve for \( x \) in the equation \( x + 200 = 500 \).

**Problem:** Solve \( x + 200 = 500 \).

**Solution:**
1. Subtract 200 from both sides of the equation to isolate \( x \).
   \[ x + 200 - 200 = 500 - 200 \]
2. Simplify the equation.
   \[ x = 300 \]

**Final Answer:** \( x = 300 \)

### Conclusion
Without a specific problem statement, I've provided solutions to three possible interpretations involving the number 200. If you have a specific problem in mind, please provide more details so I can assist you further.
