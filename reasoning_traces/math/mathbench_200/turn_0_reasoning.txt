To solve the problem "Sample math problem 200," we first need to understand what the problem is asking. However, the phrase "Sample math problem 200" is not specific enough to determine the exact nature of the problem. It could refer to a specific problem in a textbook or a collection of problems, but without additional context or details, it's impossible to solve it directly.

To proceed, let's assume that "Sample math problem 200" is a placeholder for a typical math problem. I'll create a sample problem and solve it step-by-step.

**Sample Problem:**

Let's assume "Sample math problem 200" is a problem involving solving a quadratic equation. Here's a possible problem:

Solve the quadratic equation: \(2x^2 - 4x - 6 = 0\).

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Identify the quadratic equation:**  
   The given equation is \(2x^2 - 4x - 6 = 0\).

2. **Simplify the equation (if possible):**  
   In this case, the equation is already simplified.

3. **Use the quadratic formula:**  
   The quadratic formula is given by:
   \[
   x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
   \]
   where \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) are the coefficients from the equation \(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\).

   For our equation, \(a = 2\), \(b = -4\), and \(c = -6\).

4. **Calculate the discriminant (\(b^2 - 4ac\)):**  
   \[
   b^2 - 4ac = (-4)^2 - 4 \times 2 \times (-6)
   \]
   \[
   = 16 + 48
   \]
   \[
   = 64
   \]

5. **Calculate the roots using the quadratic formula:**  
   Since the discriminant is positive, there are two real roots.
   \[
   x = \frac{-(-4) \pm \sqrt{64}}{2 \times 2}
   \]
   \[
   = \frac{4 \pm 8}{4}
   \]

   - **First root:**
     \[
     x_1 = \frac{4 + 8}{4} = \frac{12}{4} = 3
     \]

   - **Second root:**
     \[
     x_2 = \frac{4 - 8}{4} = \frac{-4}{4} = -1
     \]

6. **State the final answer:**  
   The solutions to the quadratic equation \(2x^2 - 4x - 6 = 0\) are \(x = 3\) and \(x = -1\).

**Final Answer:**  
\(x = 3\) and \(x = -1\).
