To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample math problem 200" refers to. Since this is not a standard mathematical problem statement, I will assume it is a placeholder for a specific math problem. Without additional context or details, I will create a sample math problem involving the number 200 and solve it step by step.

**Sample Math Problem:**

Calculate the sum of all even numbers from 1 to 200.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Identify the Even Numbers:**
   - Even numbers are integers divisible by 2. From 1 to 200, the even numbers are 2, 4, 6, ..., 200.

2. **Determine the Sequence:**
   - This sequence is an arithmetic sequence where the first term \( a_1 = 2 \) and the common difference \( d = 2 \).

3. **Find the Number of Terms:**
   - The last term \( a_n = 200 \).
   - The formula for the \( n \)-th term of an arithmetic sequence is:
     \[
     a_n = a_1 + (n-1) \cdot d
     \]
   - Plugging in the known values:
     \[
     200 = 2 + (n-1) \cdot 2
     \]
     \[
     200 = 2 + 2n - 2
     \]
     \[
     200 = 2n
     \]
     \[
     n = \frac{200}{2} = 100
     \]
   - There are 100 even numbers from 1 to 200.

4. **Calculate the Sum of the Sequence:**
   - The sum \( S_n \) of the first \( n \) terms of an arithmetic sequence is given by:
     \[
     S_n = \frac{n}{2} \cdot (a_1 + a_n)
     \]
   - Substituting the known values:
     \[
     S_{100} = \frac{100}{2} \cdot (2 + 200)
     \]
     \[
     S_{100} = 50 \cdot 202
     \]
     \[
     S_{100} = 10100
     \]

**Final Answer:**

The sum of all even numbers from 1 to 200 is 10,100.
