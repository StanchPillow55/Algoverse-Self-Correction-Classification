Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 41," we first need to understand what the problem is asking. However, since "Sample math problem 41" is not a specific problem statement, I'll create a hypothetical math problem and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**

"Calculate the area of a triangle with a base of 10 units and a height of 5 units."

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Formula for the Area of a Triangle:**

   The formula to calculate the area of a triangle is:
   \[
   \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height}
   \]

2. **Identify the Given Values:**

   From the problem, we know:
   - Base (\(b\)) = 10 units
   - Height (\(h\)) = 5 units

3. **Substitute the Values into the Formula:**

   Plug the given values into the area formula:
   \[
   \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times 10 \times 5
   \]

4. **Perform the Multiplication:**

   First, multiply the base and the height:
   \[
   10 \times 5 = 50
   \]

5. **Calculate the Final Area:**

   Now, multiply the result by \(\frac{1}{2}\):
   \[
   \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times 50 = 25
   \]

6. **State the Final Answer:**

   The area of the triangle is 25 square units.

This step-by-step solution demonstrates how to calculate the area of a triangle given its base and height. If you have a specific "Sample math problem 41" in mind, please provide the details, and I can solve that specific problem for you.
