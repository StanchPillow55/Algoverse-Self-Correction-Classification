==================================================

To solve the problem, I need more information about what "Sample math problem 436" entails. Since the problem statement is not provided, I'll demonstrate how to approach a generic math problem by creating an example problem and solving it step by step.

Let's assume "Sample math problem 436" is a problem involving solving a quadratic equation. Here's an example problem:

**Problem:** Solve the quadratic equation \(2x^2 - 4x - 6 = 0\).

**Step 1: Identify the quadratic equation format.**

A quadratic equation is generally in the form \(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\), where \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) are constants. In this problem, \(a = 2\), \(b = -4\), and \(c = -6\).

**Step 2: Use the quadratic formula.**

The quadratic formula is given by:

\[
x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
\]

**Step 3: Calculate the discriminant.**

The discriminant \(\Delta\) is the part under the square root in the quadratic formula: \(b^2 - 4ac\).

\[
\Delta = (-4)^2 - 4 \times 2 \times (-6) = 16 + 48 = 64
\]

**Step 4: Determine the roots using the quadratic formula.**

Since the discriminant is positive (\(\Delta = 64\)), there are two distinct real roots.

\[
x = \frac{-(-4) \pm \sqrt{64}}{2 \times 2}
\]

\[
x = \frac{4 \pm 8}{4}
\]

**Step 5: Calculate the two possible values for \(x\).**

1. \(x_1 = \frac{4 + 8}{4} = \frac{12}{4} = 3\)

2. \(x_2 = \frac{4 - 8}{4} = \frac{-4}{4} = -1\)

**Final Answer:**

The solutions to the quadratic equation \(2x^2 - 4x - 6 = 0\) are \(x = 3\) and \(x = -1\).

This is a complete solution to the assumed problem. If you have a specific problem labeled "Sample math problem 436," please provide the details, and I can solve that particular problem for you.
