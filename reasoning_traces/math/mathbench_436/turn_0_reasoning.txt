To solve the problem, we first need to understand what "Sample math problem 436" refers to. Since no specific details are provided about this problem, I'll create a sample math problem and solve it step by step.

**Sample Math Problem 436:**

**Problem:**
A rectangle has a length that is twice its width. If the perimeter of the rectangle is 36 units, find the dimensions of the rectangle.

**Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   We are given that the length of the rectangle is twice its width, and the perimeter is 36 units. We need to find the length and width of the rectangle.

2. **Define Variables:**
   Let \( w \) be the width of the rectangle.
   Then, the length \( l \) is \( 2w \).

3. **Use the Perimeter Formula:**
   The formula for the perimeter \( P \) of a rectangle is:
   \[
   P = 2l + 2w
   \]
   We know the perimeter is 36 units, so:
   \[
   2l + 2w = 36
   \]

4. **Substitute the Expression for Length:**
   Since \( l = 2w \), substitute \( l \) in the perimeter equation:
   \[
   2(2w) + 2w = 36
   \]

5. **Simplify and Solve for \( w \):**
   \[
   4w + 2w = 36
   \]
   \[
   6w = 36
   \]
   Divide both sides by 6:
   \[
   w = 6
   \]

6. **Find the Length:**
   Since \( l = 2w \):
   \[
   l = 2 \times 6 = 12
   \]

7. **Verify the Solution:**
   Check if the perimeter is indeed 36 units with these dimensions:
   \[
   2l + 2w = 2(12) + 2(6) = 24 + 12 = 36
   \]
   The calculated perimeter matches the given perimeter.

**Final Answer:**
The width of the rectangle is 6 units, and the length is 12 units.
