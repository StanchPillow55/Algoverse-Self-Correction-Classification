==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine how many cookies Uncle Jude put in the fridge. We know the following:

1. Uncle Jude baked a total of 256 cookies.
2. He gave 15 cookies to Tim.
3. He gave 23 cookies to Mike.
4. He gave twice as many cookies to Anna as he gave to Tim.
5. The rest of the cookies were put in the fridge.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

### Step 1: Determine the number of cookies given to Anna
- Uncle Jude gave 15 cookies to Tim.
- He gave twice as many cookies to Anna as he gave to Tim.
  
  Therefore, the number of cookies given to Anna is:
  \[
  2 \times 15 = 30 \text{ cookies}
  \]

### Step 2: Calculate the total number of cookies given away
- Cookies given to Tim: 15
- Cookies given to Mike: 23
- Cookies given to Anna: 30

Add these amounts to find the total number of cookies given away:
\[
15 + 23 + 30 = 68 \text{ cookies}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the number of cookies put in the fridge
- Total cookies baked: 256
- Total cookies given away: 68

Subtract the total cookies given away from the total cookies baked to find the number of cookies put in the fridge:
\[
256 - 68 = 188 \text{ cookies}
\]

### Conclusion
Uncle Jude put 188 cookies in the fridge.

Therefore, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{188}
\]
