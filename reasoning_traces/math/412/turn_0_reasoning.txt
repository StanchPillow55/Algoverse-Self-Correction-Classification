Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step.

1. **Identify the total number of cookies**: Uncle Jude baked a total of 256 cookies.

2. **Determine the number of cookies given to Tim and Mike**:
   - Cookies given to Tim: 15
   - Cookies given to Mike: 23

   We can calculate the total number of cookies given to Tim and Mike:
   \[
   \text{Total given to Tim and Mike} = 15 + 23 = 38
   \]

3. **Calculate the remaining cookies after giving to Tim and Mike**:
   We subtract the total given to Tim and Mike from the total cookies baked:
   \[
   \text{Remaining cookies} = 256 - 38 = 218
   \]

4. **Determine the number of cookies given to Anna**:
   According to the problem, Uncle Jude gave twice as many cookies to Anna as he gave to Tim. Since he gave 15 cookies to Tim, the number of cookies given to Anna is:
   \[
   \text{Cookies given to Anna} = 2 \times 15 = 30
   \]

5. **Calculate the number of cookies left for the fridge**:
   Now we need to find out how many cookies are left after giving cookies to Anna. We subtract the cookies given to Anna from the remaining cookies:
   \[
   \text{Cookies in the fridge} = \text{Remaining cookies} - \text{Cookies given to Anna}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Cookies in the fridge} = 218 - 30 = 188
   \]

6. **Final answer**:
   The number of cookies Uncle Jude put in the fridge is:
   \[
   \boxed{188}
   \]
