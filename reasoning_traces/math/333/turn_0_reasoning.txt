==================================================

To determine how many chocolates Kantana bought for the month, we need to break down her purchases step by step.

1. **Weekly Purchases**:
   - Every Saturday, Kantana buys chocolates for herself and her sister.
   - She buys 2 chocolates for herself and 1 for her sister.
   - Therefore, the total number of chocolates she buys each Saturday is:
     \[
     2 \text{ (for herself)} + 1 \text{ (for her sister)} = 3 \text{ chocolates}
     \]

2. **Total Saturdays in a Month**:
   - A typical month has 4 Saturdays. (Note: Some months have 5 Saturdays, but we will calculate based on the standard 4 Saturdays for this problem.)
   - Thus, the total number of chocolates she buys in a month from her weekly purchases is:
     \[
     3 \text{ chocolates/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 12 \text{ chocolates}
     \]

3. **Additional Chocolates for Charlie**:
   - On the last Saturday, Kantana also bought an additional 10 chocolates for her friend Charlie.
   - We need to add this to her total monthly purchases:
     \[
     12 \text{ chocolates (for herself and her sister)} + 10 \text{ chocolates (for Charlie)} = 22 \text{ chocolates}
     \]

4. **Final Calculation**:
   - Therefore, the total number of chocolates Kantana bought for the month is:
     \[
     22 \text{ chocolates}
     \]

In conclusion, Kantana ended up buying a total of **22 chocolates** for the month.
