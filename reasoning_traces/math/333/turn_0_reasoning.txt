To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of chocolates Kantana buys in a month, considering her regular purchases and the additional chocolates she bought for her friend Charlie.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Regular Weekly Purchase:**
   - Every Saturday, Kantana buys 2 chocolates for herself and 1 chocolate for her sister.
   - Therefore, each Saturday, she buys a total of:
     \[
     2 \text{ (for herself)} + 1 \text{ (for her sister)} = 3 \text{ chocolates}
     \]

2. **Additional Purchase for Charlie:**
   - On the last Saturday, she also buys 10 additional chocolates for her friend Charlie's birthday.
   - Therefore, on the last Saturday, she buys:
     \[
     3 \text{ (regular chocolates)} + 10 \text{ (for Charlie)} = 13 \text{ chocolates}
     \]

3. **Total Chocolates for the Month:**
   - We need to calculate the total number of Saturdays in a month. Typically, a month has about 4 weeks, so there are 4 Saturdays in a month.
   - For the first 3 Saturdays, she buys 3 chocolates each Saturday:
     \[
     3 \text{ chocolates/week} \times 3 \text{ weeks} = 9 \text{ chocolates}
     \]
   - On the 4th Saturday, she buys 13 chocolates (including the 10 for Charlie):
     \[
     13 \text{ chocolates}
     \]

4. **Total Calculation:**
   - Add the chocolates from the first 3 Saturdays and the 4th Saturday:
     \[
     9 \text{ chocolates (first 3 Saturdays)} + 13 \text{ chocolates (4th Saturday)} = 22 \text{ chocolates}
     \]

Therefore, Kantana ends up buying a total of 22 chocolates for the month.

**Final Answer: 22 chocolates**
