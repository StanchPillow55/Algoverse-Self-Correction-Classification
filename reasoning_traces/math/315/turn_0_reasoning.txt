==================================================

To determine how many people show up for Martha's Christmas party, we will break down the problem step by step.

### Step 1: Calculate the total number of invited guests

Martha invited:
- 2 families with 6 people each: 
  \[
  2 \times 6 = 12 \text{ people}
  \]
- 3 families with 4 people each: 
  \[
  3 \times 4 = 12 \text{ people}
  \]

Now, we add the two groups together to find the total number of invited guests:
\[
12 + 12 = 24 \text{ people}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the number of people who couldn't come

According to the problem:
- 8 people couldn't come due to illness.
- Additionally, \( \frac{1}{4} \) of that number had previous commitments. 

First, we calculate \( \frac{1}{4} \) of 8:
\[
\frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2 \text{ people}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the total number of people who couldn't come

Now, we add the number of people who couldn't come due to illness and those who had previous commitments:
\[
8 + 2 = 10 \text{ people}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the number of people who will show up

To find the number of people who actually show up at the party, we subtract the total number of people who couldn't come from the total number of invited guests:
\[
24 - 10 = 14 \text{ people}
\]

### Final Answer

Thus, the number of people who show up for Martha's party is:
\[
\boxed{14}
\]
