To solve the problem, we will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total amount of food available in person-days.**
2. **Determine how much food is consumed in the first 30 days.**
3. **Calculate the remaining food after 30 days.**
4. **Determine how many people are left after 100 people leave.**
5. **Calculate how many days the remaining food will last for the remaining people.**

### Step 1: Calculate the total amount of food available in person-days.

The provisions can feed 300 people for 90 days. Therefore, the total amount of food in person-days is:

\[
\text{Total food} = \text{Number of people} \times \text{Number of days} = 300 \text{ people} \times 90 \text{ days} = 27000 \text{ person-days}
\]

### Step 2: Determine how much food is consumed in the first 30 days.

In the first 30 days, all 300 people are present. The amount of food consumed in this period is:

\[
\text{Food consumed in 30 days} = 300 \text{ people} \times 30 \text{ days} = 9000 \text{ person-days}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the remaining food after 30 days.

Now, we subtract the food consumed in the first 30 days from the total food:

\[
\text{Remaining food} = \text{Total food} - \text{Food consumed in 30 days} = 27000 \text{ person-days} - 9000 \text{ person-days} = 18000 \text{ person-days}
\]

### Step 4: Determine how many people are left after 100 people leave.

After 30 days, 100 people leave the castle, so the number of people remaining is:

\[
\text{Remaining people} = 300 \text{ people} - 100 \text{ people} = 200 \text{ people}
\]

### Step 5: Calculate how many days the remaining food will last for the remaining people.

Now we need to find out how many days the remaining food (18000 person-days) will last for the 200 remaining people. We can set up the equation:

\[
\text{Days remaining} = \frac{\text{Remaining food}}{\text{Remaining people}} = \frac{18000 \text{ person-days}}{200 \text{ people}} = 90 \text{ days}
\]

### Final Answer

Thus, the remaining food will last for **90 more days** until it runs out.

\[
\boxed{90}
\]
