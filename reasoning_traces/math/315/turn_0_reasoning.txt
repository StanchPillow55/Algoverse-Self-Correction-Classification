To solve this problem, we need to determine how long the remaining provisions will last after some people have left the castle. Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial Setup

1. **Initial Provisions**: The castle has enough provisions to feed 300 people for 90 days.

2. **Total Person-Days of Provisions**: 
   - "Person-days" is a way to measure the total amount of food available. It is calculated by multiplying the number of people by the number of days the provisions last.
   - For 300 people for 90 days, the total person-days of provisions is:
     \[
     300 \text{ people} \times 90 \text{ days} = 27,000 \text{ person-days}
     \]

### After 30 Days

3. **Consumption in the First 30 Days**:
   - In the first 30 days, all 300 people consume provisions. The total consumption is:
     \[
     300 \text{ people} \times 30 \text{ days} = 9,000 \text{ person-days}
     \]

4. **Remaining Provisions**:
   - After 30 days, the remaining provisions are:
     \[
     27,000 \text{ person-days} - 9,000 \text{ person-days} = 18,000 \text{ person-days}
     \]

### After 100 People Leave

5. **New Population**:
   - After 30 days, 100 people leave, leaving 200 people in the castle.

6. **Determine How Many More Days the Remaining Provisions Will Last**:
   - We need to find out how many days 18,000 person-days of provisions will last for 200 people.
   - Let \( x \) be the number of additional days the provisions will last for 200 people. The equation is:
     \[
     200 \text{ people} \times x \text{ days} = 18,000 \text{ person-days}
     \]
   - Solving for \( x \):
     \[
     x = \frac{18,000 \text{ person-days}}{200 \text{ people}} = 90 \text{ days}
     \]

### Conclusion

The remaining provisions will last for an additional 90 days for the 200 people remaining in the castle.

**Final Answer**: 90 more days until all the food runs out.
