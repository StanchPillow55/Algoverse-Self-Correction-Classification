Question ID: 452
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step and keep track of the number of marbles Emily has at each stage.

1. **Initial Number of Marbles:**
   - Emily starts with 6 marbles.

2. **Megan Gives Emily Double the Number She Has:**
   - Emily has 6 marbles initially.
   - Megan gives Emily double the number of marbles Emily currently has.
   - Double of 6 is \(2 \times 6 = 12\).
   - So, Megan gives Emily 12 marbles.
   - Now, Emily has \(6 + 12 = 18\) marbles.

3. **Emily Gives Megan Back Half of Her New Total Plus 1:**
   - Emily's new total is 18 marbles.
   - Half of 18 is \(18 \div 2 = 9\).
   - Emily gives Megan back half of her total plus 1, which is \(9 + 1 = 10\).
   - So, Emily gives Megan 10 marbles.

4. **Final Calculation of Emily's Marbles:**
   - After giving 10 marbles back to Megan, Emily's total is \(18 - 10 = 8\).

Therefore, after all these transactions, Emily has 8 marbles.

**Final Answer: Emily has 8 marbles.**
