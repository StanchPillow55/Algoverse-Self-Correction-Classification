Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step and keep track of the number of marbles Emily has at each stage.

1. **Initial Number of Marbles:**
   - Emily starts with 6 marbles.

2. **Megan Gives Emily Double the Number She Has:**
   - Emily has 6 marbles initially.
   - Megan gives Emily double this amount: \(2 \times 6 = 12\) marbles.
   - After receiving these marbles from Megan, Emily now has:
     \[
     6 + 12 = 18 \text{ marbles}
     \]

3. **Emily Gives Megan Back Half of Her New Total Plus 1:**
   - Emily's new total is 18 marbles.
   - Half of this total is:
     \[
     \frac{18}{2} = 9
     \]
   - Emily gives back half of her total plus 1 marble:
     \[
     9 + 1 = 10 \text{ marbles}
     \]
   - After giving these marbles back to Megan, Emily has:
     \[
     18 - 10 = 8 \text{ marbles}
     \]

Therefore, after all these transactions, Emily has 8 marbles.

**Final Answer:**
Emily has 8 marbles now.
