==================================================

Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial Number of Marbles**: 
   Emily starts with 6 marbles.

   \[
   \text{Emily's initial marbles} = 6
   \]

2. **Megan Gives Emily Marbles**: 
   Megan gives Emily double the number of marbles Emily currently has. Since Emily has 6 marbles, double that amount is:

   \[
   \text{Marbles given by Megan} = 2 \times 6 = 12
   \]

   Now, we need to calculate Emily's new total after receiving these marbles:

   \[
   \text{Emily's new total} = \text{Emily's initial marbles} + \text{Marbles given by Megan} = 6 + 12 = 18
   \]

3. **Emily Gives Back to Megan**: 
   Emily then gives Megan back half of her new total plus 1. First, we calculate half of Emily's new total:

   \[
   \text{Half of Emily's new total} = \frac{18}{2} = 9
   \]

   Now, we add 1 to this amount:

   \[
   \text{Amount given back to Megan} = 9 + 1 = 10
   \]

4. **Final Calculation of Emily's Marbles**: 
   Now we need to find out how many marbles Emily has left after giving 10 marbles back to Megan:

   \[
   \text{Emily's final total} = \text{Emily's new total} - \text{Amount given back to Megan} = 18 - 10 = 8
   \]

Therefore, after all the transactions, the final number of marbles that Emily has is:

\[
\boxed{8}
\]
