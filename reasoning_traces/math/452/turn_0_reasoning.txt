==================================================

To find the car's average speed during the trip, we need to calculate the total distance traveled and the total time taken.

### Step 1: Calculate the distance for each segment of the trip.

1. **First segment**: The car drives at 60 mph for 2 hours.
   \[
   \text{Distance}_1 = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 60 \text{ mph} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 120 \text{ miles}
   \]

2. **Second segment**: The car drives at 30 mph for 1 hour.
   \[
   \text{Distance}_2 = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 30 \text{ mph} \times 1 \text{ hour} = 30 \text{ miles}
   \]

### Step 2: Calculate the total distance traveled.

Now, we add the distances from both segments:
\[
\text{Total Distance} = \text{Distance}_1 + \text{Distance}_2 = 120 \text{ miles} + 30 \text{ miles} = 150 \text{ miles}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the total time taken.

Next, we add the time spent on each segment:
\[
\text{Total Time} = \text{Time}_1 + \text{Time}_2 = 2 \text{ hours} + 1 \text{ hour} = 3 \text{ hours}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the average speed.

The average speed is calculated using the formula:
\[
\text{Average Speed} = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Total Time}}
\]
Substituting in the values we calculated:
\[
\text{Average Speed} = \frac{150 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ hours}} = 50 \text{ mph}
\]

### Final Answer:
The car's average speed during the trip is **50 mph**.
