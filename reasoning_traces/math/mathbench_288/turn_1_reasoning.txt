==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 288," we first need to understand what the problem is asking. However, the problem statement "Sample math problem 288" is not specific enough to determine the exact nature of the problem. It seems like a placeholder or a reference to a specific problem that might be found in a textbook or a collection of problems.

Since the problem is not explicitly stated, let's consider a hypothetical math problem involving the number 288. We can create a problem involving basic arithmetic operations, factors, or properties of the number 288.

Let's create a problem: "Find the prime factorization of the number 288."

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   We need to find the prime factorization of 288, which means expressing 288 as a product of prime numbers.

2. **Start with the Smallest Prime Number:**
   Begin dividing 288 by the smallest prime number, which is 2, and continue dividing by 2 until it is no longer divisible by 2.

   \[
   288 \div 2 = 144
   \]

   \[
   144 \div 2 = 72
   \]

   \[
   72 \div 2 = 36
   \]

   \[
   36 \div 2 = 18
   \]

   \[
   18 \div 2 = 9
   \]

   At this point, 9 is not divisible by 2.

3. **Proceed to the Next Prime Number:**
   The next smallest prime number is 3. Divide 9 by 3.

   \[
   9 \div 3 = 3
   \]

   \[
   3 \div 3 = 1
   \]

   Now we have reached 1, which means we have completed the factorization.

4. **Write the Prime Factorization:**
   Collect all the prime factors we used in the division process:

   \[
   288 = 2^5 \times 3^2
   \]

   This means 288 can be expressed as the product of five 2's and two 3's.

5. **Verify the Solution:**
   Multiply the prime factors to ensure they equal the original number:

   \[
   2^5 = 2 \times 2 \times 2 \times 2 \times 2 = 32
   \]

   \[
   3^2 = 3 \times 3 = 9
   \]

   \[
   32 \times 9 = 288
   \]

   The multiplication checks out, confirming that our factorization is correct.

### Final Answer:
The prime factorization of 288 is \(2^5 \times 3^2\).
