Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we first need to understand what "Sample math problem 288" refers to. Since the problem itself isn't specified, I'll assume it's a generic math problem involving the number 288. Let's explore a few possibilities:

### Possibility 1: Factorization of 288

One common type of math problem is to factor a number into its prime components. Let's factor 288:

1. **Divide by 2 (smallest prime number):**
   \[
   288 \div 2 = 144
   \]
   So, 288 = 2 × 144.

2. **Continue dividing by 2:**
   \[
   144 \div 2 = 72
   \]
   So, 144 = 2 × 72, and thus 288 = 2 × 2 × 72.

3. **Continue dividing by 2:**
   \[
   72 \div 2 = 36
   \]
   So, 72 = 2 × 36, and thus 288 = 2 × 2 × 2 × 36.

4. **Continue dividing by 2:**
   \[
   36 \div 2 = 18
   \]
   So, 36 = 2 × 18, and thus 288 = 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 18.

5. **Continue dividing by 2:**
   \[
   18 \div 2 = 9
   \]
   So, 18 = 2 × 9, and thus 288 = 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 9.

6. **Divide by 3 (next smallest prime number):**
   \[
   9 \div 3 = 3
   \]
   So, 9 = 3 × 3, and thus 288 = 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 3 × 3.

Therefore, the prime factorization of 288 is:
\[
288 = 2^5 \times 3^2
\]

### Possibility 2: Solving an Equation Involving 288

If the problem involves solving an equation where 288 is a part of it, let's consider a simple equation:

Solve for \( x \) in the equation:
\[
x + 288 = 500
\]

To solve for \( x \), subtract 288 from both sides:
\[
x = 500 - 288
\]

Calculate the right-hand side:
\[
500 - 288 = 212
\]

Thus, the solution to the equation is:
\[
x = 212
\]

### Conclusion

Since the problem "Sample math problem 288" is not specified, I've demonstrated two possible interpretations: finding the prime factorization of 288 and solving a simple equation involving 288. If you have a specific problem in mind, please provide additional details for a more targeted solution.

Final Answer:
- Prime factorization of 288: \( 2^5 \times 3^2 \)
- Solution to the equation \( x + 288 = 500 \): \( x = 212 \)
