Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, let's first clarify what "Sample math problem 288" refers to. Since no specific details are provided about the problem, I'll assume it involves a basic arithmetic operation with the number 288. Let's explore a few possibilities:

### Possibility 1: Basic Arithmetic Operations

1. **Addition**: If the problem involves adding a number to 288, let's assume we add 12.
   \[
   288 + 12 = 300
   \]

2. **Subtraction**: If the problem involves subtracting a number from 288, let's assume we subtract 88.
   \[
   288 - 88 = 200
   \]

3. **Multiplication**: If the problem involves multiplying 288 by a number, let's assume we multiply by 2.
   \[
   288 \times 2 = 576
   \]

4. **Division**: If the problem involves dividing 288 by a number, let's assume we divide by 3.
   \[
   288 \div 3 = 96
   \]

### Possibility 2: Factorization

If the problem involves finding the prime factorization of 288, we can break it down as follows:

1. **Divide by 2** (since 288 is even):
   \[
   288 \div 2 = 144
   \]

2. **Divide by 2 again**:
   \[
   144 \div 2 = 72
   \]

3. **Divide by 2 again**:
   \[
   72 \div 2 = 36
   \]

4. **Divide by 2 again**:
   \[
   36 \div 2 = 18
   \]

5. **Divide by 2 again**:
   \[
   18 \div 2 = 9
   \]

6. **Divide by 3** (since 9 is divisible by 3):
   \[
   9 \div 3 = 3
   \]

7. **Divide by 3 again**:
   \[
   3 \div 3 = 1
   \]

So, the prime factorization of 288 is:
\[
288 = 2^5 \times 3^2
\]

### Possibility 3: Solving an Equation

If the problem involves solving an equation where 288 is a part of it, let's assume a simple equation like \( x + 288 = 500 \).

1. **Subtract 288 from both sides**:
   \[
   x + 288 - 288 = 500 - 288
   \]

2. **Simplify**:
   \[
   x = 212
   \]

### Final Answer

Since the problem "Sample math problem 288" is not explicitly defined, I explored various possibilities. If you have a specific operation or context in mind, please provide more details. Otherwise, here are the results for the scenarios considered:

- **Addition**: \( 288 + 12 = 300 \)
- **Subtraction**: \( 288 - 88 = 200 \)
- **Multiplication**: \( 288 \times 2 = 576 \)
- **Division**: \( 288 \div 3 = 96 \)
- **Prime Factorization**: \( 288 = 2^5 \times 3^2 \)
- **Equation Solution**: \( x = 212 \) for \( x + 288 = 500 \)
