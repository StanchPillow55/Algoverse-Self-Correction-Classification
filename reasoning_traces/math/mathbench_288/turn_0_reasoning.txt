==================================================

It seems like the problem statement is incomplete or unclear. "Sample math problem 288" doesn't provide enough information to determine what the problem is asking. However, I can guide you through a generic approach to solving math problems, or if you have a specific math problem in mind, please provide the full details, and I'll be happy to help.

### Generic Approach to Solving Math Problems

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - Read the problem carefully.
   - Identify what is being asked.
   - Determine what information is given and what needs to be found.

2. **Devise a Plan:**
   - Think about the mathematical concepts that might apply.
   - Consider if there are formulas or theorems that can be used.
   - Plan the steps needed to solve the problem.

3. **Carry Out the Plan:**
   - Execute the steps you have planned.
   - Perform calculations carefully.
   - Keep track of units and ensure consistency.

4. **Check Your Work:**
   - Verify each step of your solution.
   - Check if the answer makes sense in the context of the problem.
   - Review calculations for any possible errors.

5. **State the Final Answer:**
   - Clearly write down the final answer.
   - Include units if applicable.

### Example Problem

Let's create a sample problem to illustrate the process:

**Problem:**
Solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 2x + 5 = 13 \).

**Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We need to find the value of \( x \) that satisfies the equation \( 2x + 5 = 13 \).

2. **Devise a Plan:**
   - Isolate \( x \) on one side of the equation.

3. **Carry Out the Plan:**
   - Start with the equation: \( 2x + 5 = 13 \).
   - Subtract 5 from both sides to isolate the term with \( x \):
     \[
     2x + 5 - 5 = 13 - 5
     \]
     \[
     2x = 8
     \]
   - Divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( x \):
     \[
     \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{8}{2}
     \]
     \[
     x = 4
     \]

4. **Check Your Work:**
   - Substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation to verify:
     \[
     2(4) + 5 = 8 + 5 = 13
     \]
   - The left side equals the right side, confirming our solution is correct.

5. **State the Final Answer:**
   - The solution to the equation \( 2x + 5 = 13 \) is \( x = 4 \).

If you have a specific problem in mind, please provide the details, and I can work through it step by step.
