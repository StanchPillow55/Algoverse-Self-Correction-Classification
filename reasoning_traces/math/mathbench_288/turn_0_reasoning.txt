==================================================

To solve the problem, we first need to understand what "Sample math problem 288" refers to. Since there is no specific problem statement provided, I will assume you are asking for a solution to a generic math problem involving the number 288. Let's consider a common type of problem involving this number: finding its prime factorization.

**Step 1: Understand the Problem**

We need to find the prime factorization of the number 288. Prime factorization involves expressing a number as a product of its prime factors.

**Step 2: Start with the Smallest Prime Number**

The smallest prime number is 2. We will divide 288 by 2 and continue dividing the quotient by 2 until it is no longer divisible by 2.

\[ 288 \div 2 = 144 \]

Since 144 is even, we divide by 2 again:

\[ 144 \div 2 = 72 \]

Continuing this process:

\[ 72 \div 2 = 36 \]

\[ 36 \div 2 = 18 \]

\[ 18 \div 2 = 9 \]

Now, 9 is not divisible by 2, so we move to the next smallest prime number, which is 3.

**Step 3: Divide by the Next Smallest Prime Number**

Since 9 is divisible by 3, we divide:

\[ 9 \div 3 = 3 \]

And 3 is a prime number, so we divide once more:

\[ 3 \div 3 = 1 \]

**Step 4: Compile the Prime Factors**

Now, we have divided 288 completely into prime factors. The prime factors we used are:

- Five 2's: \(2 \times 2 \times 2 \times 2 \times 2\)
- Two 3's: \(3 \times 3\)

**Step 5: Write the Prime Factorization**

The prime factorization of 288 is:

\[ 288 = 2^5 \times 3^2 \]

**Final Answer**

The prime factorization of 288 is \(2^5 \times 3^2\).
