==================================================

To solve the problem effectively, I need more information about "Sample math problem 8" as it is not specified in your request. However, I can guide you through a generic approach to solving math problems by outlining a step-by-step process. If you provide the specific details of the problem, I can tailor the solution accordingly. Here is a general approach:

### Step-by-Step Problem Solving Approach

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - Read the problem carefully.
   - Identify what is being asked.
   - Determine what information is given and what needs to be found.

2. **Devise a Plan:**
   - Consider possible strategies to solve the problem, such as:
     - Drawing a diagram
     - Creating an equation
     - Looking for patterns
     - Breaking the problem into smaller parts

3. **Carry Out the Plan:**
   - Execute the chosen strategy.
   - Perform calculations carefully.
   - Keep track of units and ensure consistency.

4. **Check Your Work:**
   - Review each step to ensure accuracy.
   - Verify that the solution makes sense in the context of the problem.
   - Check calculations for errors.

5. **State the Final Answer:**
   - Clearly present the solution.
   - Include units if applicable.

### Example Problem and Solution

Let's assume "Sample math problem 8" is a simple algebra problem:

**Problem:** Solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).

**Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We need to find the value of \( x \) that satisfies the equation.

2. **Devise a Plan:**
   - Isolate \( x \) on one side of the equation.

3. **Carry Out the Plan:**
   - Subtract 3 from both sides:
     \[
     2x + 3 - 3 = 11 - 3
     \]
     \[
     2x = 8
     \]
   - Divide both sides by 2:
     \[
     \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{8}{2}
     \]
     \[
     x = 4
     \]

4. **Check Your Work:**
   - Substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation to verify:
     \[
     2(4) + 3 = 8 + 3 = 11
     \]
   - The left side equals the right side, confirming the solution is correct.

5. **State the Final Answer:**
   - The solution to the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \) is \( x = 4 \).

If you provide the specific details of "Sample math problem 8," I can offer a more precise solution.
