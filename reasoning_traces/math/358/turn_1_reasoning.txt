Question ID: 358
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to track the number of marbles Carl has at each step and determine how many marbles he will put back into the jar after playing his game.

1. **Initial Situation:**
   - Carl has a jar full of marbles. Let's denote the initial number of marbles in the jar as \( M \).

2. **First Action:**
   - Carl takes out 12 marbles to play a game. 
   - Marbles left in the jar = \( M - 12 \).

3. **Accident:**
   - Carl accidentally drops the 12 marbles and loses half of them.
   - Marbles lost = \( \frac{1}{2} \times 12 = 6 \).
   - Marbles remaining from the 12 he took out = \( 12 - 6 = 6 \).

4. **Second Action:**
   - Carl takes out 10 more marbles from the jar.
   - Marbles left in the jar = \( M - 12 - 10 = M - 22 \).

5. **Additional Marbles:**
   - Carl's mother brings home a bag with 25 marbles.
   - Total marbles Carl has to put back after playing = 6 (from the first set) + 10 (from the second set) + 25 (new marbles) = 41 marbles.

6. **Final Calculation:**
   - After playing his game, Carl will put back the 41 marbles into the jar.
   - Since he cannot find the lost marbles, they are not included in the count of marbles being put back.

Therefore, the number of marbles Carl is going to put back in the jar after he plays his game, from both his original marbles and the new ones, is **41 marbles**.
