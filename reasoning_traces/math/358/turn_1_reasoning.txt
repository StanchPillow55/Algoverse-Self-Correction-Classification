Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To determine how much money Marisa puts in her piggy bank after saving for 5 days, we can break the problem down into the following steps:

1. **Calculate Marisa's daily expenses on lollipops:**
   - Each lollipop costs 25 cents.
   - Marisa buys 4 lollipops each day.
   - Total cost for lollipops per day = 4 lollipops × $0.25/lollipop = $1.00.

2. **Calculate Marisa's daily savings:**
   - Marisa receives $5 as pocket money each day.
   - Daily savings = Daily pocket money - Daily expenses on lollipops.
   - Daily savings = $5.00 - $1.00 = $4.00.

3. **Calculate total savings over 5 days:**
   - Total savings = Daily savings × Number of days.
   - Total savings = $4.00/day × 5 days = $20.00.

Thus, the amount of money Marisa puts in her piggy bank after saving for 5 days is **$20.00**.
