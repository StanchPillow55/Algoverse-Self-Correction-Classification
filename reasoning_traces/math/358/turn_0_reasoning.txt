==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to carefully track the number of marbles Carl has at each step and determine how many marbles he will put back into the jar after playing his game.

1. **Initial Situation:**
   - Let \( x \) be the initial number of marbles in the jar.

2. **First Action:**
   - Carl takes out 12 marbles to play a game. 
   - Marbles left in the jar: \( x - 12 \).

3. **Accident:**
   - Carl drops the 12 marbles, and half of them get lost.
   - Number of marbles lost: \( \frac{1}{2} \times 12 = 6 \).
   - Marbles Carl still has from the 12 he took out: \( 12 - 6 = 6 \).

4. **Second Action:**
   - Carl takes out 10 more marbles from the jar.
   - Marbles left in the jar after taking out 10 more: \( x - 12 - 10 = x - 22 \).

5. **New Marbles:**
   - Carl's mother brings home a bag with 25 new marbles.

6. **Total Marbles Carl Has After Receiving New Ones:**
   - Marbles Carl has from the game: 6 (from the first set he took out and didn't lose) + 10 (second set he took out) = 16.
   - Adding the new marbles: \( 16 + 25 = 41 \).

7. **Final Step:**
   - Carl will put back the 41 marbles he has after playing his game into the jar.

Thus, after playing his game, Carl will put 41 marbles back into the jar. The initial number of marbles \( x \) is irrelevant to the final count of marbles being put back, as we are only asked about the marbles he has after playing and receiving the new ones.

**Final Answer:**
Carl will put 41 marbles back into the jar after playing his game.
