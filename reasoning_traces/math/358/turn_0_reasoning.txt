==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to determine how much money Marisa saves each day after buying lollipops and then calculate her total savings over 5 days.

### Step 1: Calculate the cost of lollipops per day
Marisa buys 4 lollipops every day, and each lollipop costs 25 cents. 

First, we convert the cost of one lollipop into dollars:
\[
25 \text{ cents} = 0.25 \text{ dollars}
\]

Now, we calculate the total cost of 4 lollipops:
\[
\text{Total cost of lollipops} = 4 \times 0.25 = 1.00 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate Marisa's daily savings
Marisa receives $5 as pocket money each day. To find out how much she saves each day, we subtract the cost of the lollipops from her daily pocket money:
\[
\text{Daily savings} = \text{Daily pocket money} - \text{Cost of lollipops}
\]
\[
\text{Daily savings} = 5.00 - 1.00 = 4.00 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate total savings over 5 days
Now we need to find out how much she saves over 5 days. We multiply her daily savings by the number of days:
\[
\text{Total savings over 5 days} = \text{Daily savings} \times 5
\]
\[
\text{Total savings over 5 days} = 4.00 \times 5 = 20.00 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Final Answer
Marisa puts **$20.00** in her piggy bank after saving for 5 days.
