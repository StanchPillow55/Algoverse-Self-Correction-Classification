==================================================

Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial Marbles Taken Out**: Carl takes out 12 marbles to play a game.

2. **Marbles Lost**: He accidentally drops the 12 marbles, and half of them get lost. 
   - Half of 12 is calculated as:
     \[
     \frac{12}{2} = 6
     \]
   - Therefore, Carl loses 6 marbles. 

3. **Marbles Remaining After Loss**: After losing 6 marbles, the number of marbles Carl has left from the original 12 is:
   \[
   12 - 6 = 6
   \]

4. **Additional Marbles Taken Out**: Carl then takes out 10 more marbles. 
   - Now, the total number of marbles he has while playing the game is:
   \[
   6 + 10 = 16
   \]

5. **New Marbles from Mother**: While playing, Carl's mother comes home with a bag containing 25 marbles. 
   - Now, the total number of marbles Carl has (including the new ones) is:
   \[
   16 + 25 = 41
   \]

6. **Lost Marbles**: The problem states that Carl cannot find the lost marbles. He originally lost 6 marbles, and these are not going to be returned to the jar.

7. **Marbles to Put Back in the Jar**: After playing his game, Carl will put back the marbles he has left (the 16 marbles he has while playing) and the new marbles (25 from his mother) into the jar. However, he won't put back the lost marbles (6) since they are lost.

   Therefore, the total number of marbles Carl will put back into the jar is:
   \[
   16 + 25 = 41
   \]

Thus, the final answer is that Carl is going to put **41 marbles** back into the jar after he plays his game.
