==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of vibrations Matt experiences when using the massager at its highest setting for 5 minutes. Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - At the lowest setting, the massager vibrates at 1600 vibrations per second.
   - At the highest setting, it vibrates 60% faster than the lowest setting.
   - Matt uses the massager for 5 minutes at the highest setting.

2. **Calculate the Vibrations per Second at the Highest Setting:**
   - The massager vibrates 60% faster at the highest setting. This means we need to increase the lowest setting by 60%.
   - To find 60% of 1600, we calculate:
     \[
     0.60 \times 1600 = 960
     \]
   - Add this increase to the original 1600 vibrations per second:
     \[
     1600 + 960 = 2560
     \]
   - Therefore, at the highest setting, the massager vibrates at 2560 vibrations per second.

3. **Convert the Usage Time from Minutes to Seconds:**
   - Matt uses the massager for 5 minutes. We need to convert this time into seconds because the vibration rate is given in vibrations per second.
   - There are 60 seconds in a minute, so:
     \[
     5 \text{ minutes} \times 60 \text{ seconds/minute} = 300 \text{ seconds}
     \]

4. **Calculate the Total Number of Vibrations:**
   - Now, we need to find the total number of vibrations over the 300 seconds at the highest setting.
   - Multiply the number of seconds by the number of vibrations per second:
     \[
     2560 \text{ vibrations/second} \times 300 \text{ seconds} = 768,000 \text{ vibrations}
     \]

5. **Conclusion:**
   - Matt experiences a total of 768,000 vibrations when he uses the massager at the highest setting for 5 minutes.

Therefore, the final answer is:

\[ \boxed{768,000} \]
