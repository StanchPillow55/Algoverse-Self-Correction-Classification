==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of vibrations Matt experiences when using the massager at its highest setting for 5 minutes. Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - The massager vibrates at 1600 vibrations per second at the lowest setting.
   - At the highest setting, it vibrates 60% faster than the lowest setting.
   - Matt uses the massager for 5 minutes at the highest setting.

2. **Calculate the Vibrations per Second at the Highest Setting:**
   - The massager vibrates 60% faster at the highest setting compared to the lowest setting.
   - First, calculate 60% of 1600 vibrations per second:
     \[
     0.60 \times 1600 = 960 \text{ vibrations per second}
     \]
   - Add this to the original 1600 vibrations per second to find the vibrations per second at the highest setting:
     \[
     1600 + 960 = 2560 \text{ vibrations per second}
     \]

3. **Convert the Time from Minutes to Seconds:**
   - Matt uses the massager for 5 minutes.
   - Convert minutes to seconds since the vibration rate is given per second:
     \[
     5 \text{ minutes} \times 60 \text{ seconds per minute} = 300 \text{ seconds}
     \]

4. **Calculate the Total Number of Vibrations:**
   - Multiply the number of vibrations per second by the total number of seconds to find the total number of vibrations:
     \[
     2560 \text{ vibrations per second} \times 300 \text{ seconds} = 768,000 \text{ vibrations}
     \]

5. **Final Answer:**
   - Matt experiences a total of 768,000 vibrations when using the massager at the highest setting for 5 minutes.

Therefore, the final answer is 768,000 vibrations.
