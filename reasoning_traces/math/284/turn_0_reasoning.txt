To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of vibrations Matt experiences when using the massager at its highest setting for 5 minutes. Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the vibration rate at the lowest setting:**
   - The massager vibrates at 1600 vibrations per second at the lowest setting.

2. **Determine the vibration rate at the highest setting:**
   - The highest setting is 60% faster than the lowest setting.
   - To find the increase in vibrations per second, calculate 60% of 1600:
     \[
     0.60 \times 1600 = 960
     \]
   - Add this increase to the original rate to find the highest setting rate:
     \[
     1600 + 960 = 2560 \text{ vibrations per second}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total number of vibrations for 5 minutes:**
   - First, convert 5 minutes into seconds, since the vibration rate is given per second:
     \[
     5 \text{ minutes} \times 60 \text{ seconds per minute} = 300 \text{ seconds}
     \]
   - Multiply the vibration rate at the highest setting by the total time in seconds:
     \[
     2560 \text{ vibrations per second} \times 300 \text{ seconds} = 768,000 \text{ vibrations}
     \]

Therefore, the total number of vibrations Matt experiences when using the massager at the highest setting for 5 minutes is \(\boxed{768,000}\).
