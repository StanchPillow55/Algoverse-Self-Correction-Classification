To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of vibrations Matt experiences while using the massager at the highest setting for 5 minutes.

### Step 1: Determine the vibration rate at the highest setting.

The massager vibrates at 1600 vibrations per second at the lowest setting. At the highest setting, it vibrates 60% faster. 

To find the vibration rate at the highest setting, we first calculate 60% of 1600:

\[
60\% \text{ of } 1600 = 0.60 \times 1600 = 960
\]

Now, we add this increase to the original vibration rate:

\[
\text{Vibrations at highest setting} = 1600 + 960 = 2560 \text{ vibrations per second}
\]

### Step 2: Convert the usage time from minutes to seconds.

Matt uses the massager for 5 minutes. We need to convert this time into seconds because the vibration rate is given in vibrations per second.

\[
5 \text{ minutes} = 5 \times 60 \text{ seconds} = 300 \text{ seconds}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the total number of vibrations experienced.

Now that we know the vibration rate at the highest setting (2560 vibrations per second) and the total time used (300 seconds), we can calculate the total number of vibrations:

\[
\text{Total vibrations} = \text{Vibrations per second} \times \text{Total seconds}
\]

Substituting in the values we have:

\[
\text{Total vibrations} = 2560 \text{ vibrations/second} \times 300 \text{ seconds}
\]

Now, we perform the multiplication:

\[
\text{Total vibrations} = 2560 \times 300 = 768000
\]

### Final Answer

Thus, the total number of vibrations Matt experiences while using the massager at the highest setting for 5 minutes is:

\[
\boxed{768000}
\]
