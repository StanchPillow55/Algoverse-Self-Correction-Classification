==================================================

To find the total number of stories written by Alani, Braylen, and Margot over the two weeks, we will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of stories written in the first week:**
   - Alani wrote 20 stories.
   - Braylen wrote 40 stories.
   - Margot wrote 60 stories.

   We can find the total number of stories written in the first week by adding these amounts together:

   \[
   \text{Total stories in the first week} = \text{Alani's stories} + \text{Braylen's stories} + \text{Margot's stories}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total stories in the first week} = 20 + 40 + 60
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total stories in the first week} = 120
   \]

2. **Calculate the number of stories written in the second week:**
   Since each child doubled the number of stories they wrote in the first week, we will calculate the number of stories for each child in the second week:

   - Alani's second week stories:
   \[
   \text{Alani's second week stories} = 2 \times 20 = 40
   \]

   - Braylen's second week stories:
   \[
   \text{Braylen's second week stories} = 2 \times 40 = 80
   \]

   - Margot's second week stories:
   \[
   \text{Margot's second week stories} = 2 \times 60 = 120
   \]

   Now, we can find the total number of stories written in the second week by adding these amounts together:

   \[
   \text{Total stories in the second week} = \text{Alani's second week stories} + \text{Braylen's second week stories} + \text{Margot's second week stories}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total stories in the second week} = 40 + 80 + 120
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total stories in the second week} = 240
   \]

3. **Calculate the total number of stories written over the two weeks:**
   Now we will add the total stories from both weeks:

   \[
   \text{Total stories over two weeks} = \text{Total stories in the first week} + \text{Total stories in the second week}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total stories over two weeks} = 120 + 240
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total stories over two weeks} = 360
   \]

Thus, the total number of stories written by Alani, Braylen, and Margot altogether over the two weeks is:

\[
\boxed{360}
\]
