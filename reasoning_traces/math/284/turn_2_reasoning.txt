Question ID: 284
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of vibrations Matt experiences when using the massager at its highest setting for 5 minutes. Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the vibration rate at the highest setting:**

   We know that at the lowest setting, the massager vibrates at 1600 vibrations per second. At the highest setting, it vibrates 60% faster. To find the vibration rate at the highest setting, we need to calculate 60% of 1600 and then add that to the original rate.

   \[
   \text{Increase in vibrations per second} = 1600 \times 0.60 = 960
   \]

   \[
   \text{Vibrations per second at highest setting} = 1600 + 960 = 2560
   \]

2. **Calculate the total number of vibrations in 5 minutes:**

   First, convert 5 minutes into seconds because the vibration rate is given in vibrations per second.

   \[
   5 \text{ minutes} = 5 \times 60 = 300 \text{ seconds}
   \]

   Now, multiply the number of seconds by the vibration rate at the highest setting to find the total number of vibrations.

   \[
   \text{Total vibrations} = 2560 \times 300
   \]

   To calculate this, we perform the multiplication:

   \[
   2560 \times 300 = 2560 \times (3 \times 100) = (2560 \times 3) \times 100
   \]

   First, calculate \(2560 \times 3\):

   \[
   2560 \times 3 = 7680
   \]

   Then, multiply by 100:

   \[
   7680 \times 100 = 768000
   \]

Therefore, the total number of vibrations Matt experiences is 768,000.

**Final Answer:**

Matt experiences 768,000 vibrations when using the massager at the highest setting for 5 minutes.
