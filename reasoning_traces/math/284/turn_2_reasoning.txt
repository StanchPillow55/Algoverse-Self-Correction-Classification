Question ID: 284
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of vibrations Matt experiences when using the massager at its highest setting for 5 minutes. Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Determine the vibration rate at the highest setting:**

   - We know that at the lowest setting, the massager vibrates at 1600 vibrations per second.
   - The highest setting vibrates 60% faster than the lowest setting.
   - To find the vibration rate at the highest setting, we first calculate 60% of 1600 vibrations per second:
     \[
     0.60 \times 1600 = 960
     \]
   - Add this increase to the original rate to find the highest setting rate:
     \[
     1600 + 960 = 2560 \text{ vibrations per second}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total number of vibrations in 5 minutes:**

   - First, convert 5 minutes into seconds, since the vibration rate is given per second:
     \[
     5 \text{ minutes} \times 60 \text{ seconds per minute} = 300 \text{ seconds}
     \]
   - Now, calculate the total number of vibrations at the highest setting over 300 seconds:
     \[
     2560 \text{ vibrations per second} \times 300 \text{ seconds} = 768,000 \text{ vibrations}
     \]

3. **Final Answer:**

   Matt experiences a total of 768,000 vibrations when using the massager at the highest setting for 5 minutes.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{768,000}
\]
