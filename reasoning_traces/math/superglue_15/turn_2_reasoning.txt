Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to approach it systematically. However, the question "Sample reasoning question 15" is not specific enough to determine what mathematical problem or concept it refers to. Therefore, I'll demonstrate how to solve a generic math problem by walking through an example problem step by step.

Let's assume the problem is as follows:

**Example Problem:**
Solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   We need to find the value of \( x \) that makes the equation true.

2. **Isolate the Variable:**
   To solve for \( x \), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. The equation given is:
   \[
   2x + 3 = 11
   \]

3. **Subtract 3 from Both Sides:**
   To remove the constant term on the left side, subtract 3 from both sides:
   \[
   2x + 3 - 3 = 11 - 3
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   2x = 8
   \]

4. **Divide by the Coefficient of \( x \):**
   The next step is to divide both sides by 2, the coefficient of \( x \), to solve for \( x \):
   \[
   \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{8}{2}
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   x = 4
   \]

5. **Verify the Solution:**
   Substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies the equation:
   \[
   2(4) + 3 = 11
   \]
   Simplifying the left side:
   \[
   8 + 3 = 11
   \]
   Since both sides of the equation are equal, \( x = 4 \) is indeed the correct solution.

**Final Answer:**
The solution to the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \) is \( x = 4 \).
