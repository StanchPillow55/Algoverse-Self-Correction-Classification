==================================================

To solve the problem effectively, I need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 15" refers to. Since I don't have access to external databases or specific problem sets, I'll create a hypothetical math problem and solve it step-by-step. Let's assume "Sample reasoning question 15" is a typical algebra problem.

**Problem:**
Solve for \( x \) in the equation: \( 3x + 5 = 2x + 10 \).

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Equation:**
   The given equation is \( 3x + 5 = 2x + 10 \). This is a linear equation in one variable, \( x \).

2. **Isolate the Variable:**
   To solve for \( x \), we need to get all terms containing \( x \) on one side of the equation and constant terms on the other side.

3. **Subtract \( 2x \) from Both Sides:**
   \[
   3x + 5 - 2x = 2x + 10 - 2x
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   x + 5 = 10
   \]

4. **Subtract 5 from Both Sides:**
   \[
   x + 5 - 5 = 10 - 5
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   x = 5
   \]

5. **Verify the Solution:**
   Substitute \( x = 5 \) back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies the equation:
   \[
   3(5) + 5 = 2(5) + 10
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   15 + 5 = 10 + 10
   \]
   \[
   20 = 20
   \]
   Since both sides of the equation are equal, \( x = 5 \) is indeed the correct solution.

**Final Answer:**
The solution to the equation \( 3x + 5 = 2x + 10 \) is \( x = 5 \).
