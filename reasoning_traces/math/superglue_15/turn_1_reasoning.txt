==================================================

To solve the problem effectively, I need to understand the context and details of "Sample reasoning question 15." However, since the problem statement is not provided, I'll demonstrate a general approach to solving a reasoning-based math problem by creating a hypothetical example.

### Hypothetical Problem:
A farmer has a rectangular field that is 100 meters long and 60 meters wide. He wants to divide the field into smaller, equal-sized square plots. What is the largest possible side length of each square plot?

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We have a rectangular field with dimensions 100 meters by 60 meters.
   - We need to divide this field into square plots of equal size.
   - The goal is to find the largest possible side length for these square plots.

2. **Identify the Mathematical Concept:**
   - The problem involves finding the largest square that can fit evenly into both the length and the width of the rectangle.
   - This requires finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the two dimensions.

3. **Calculate the GCD:**
   - The dimensions of the field are 100 meters and 60 meters.
   - We need to find the GCD of 100 and 60.

4. **Use the Euclidean Algorithm:**
   - The Euclidean algorithm is a method for finding the GCD of two numbers.
   - Start with the two numbers: 100 and 60.
   - Divide the larger number by the smaller number and find the remainder.
   - Replace the larger number with the smaller number and the smaller number with the remainder.
   - Repeat the process until the remainder is 0. The last non-zero remainder is the GCD.

   - **Step 1:** 100 ÷ 60 = 1 remainder 40
   - **Step 2:** 60 ÷ 40 = 1 remainder 20
   - **Step 3:** 40 ÷ 20 = 2 remainder 0

   - The GCD is 20.

5. **Interpret the Result:**
   - The largest possible side length for the square plots is 20 meters.
   - This means the field can be divided into squares that are 20 meters on each side.

6. **Verify the Solution:**
   - Check if both dimensions (100 and 60) are divisible by 20.
   - 100 ÷ 20 = 5
   - 60 ÷ 20 = 3
   - Both results are whole numbers, confirming that 20 meters is the correct side length.

### Final Answer:
The largest possible side length of each square plot is 20 meters.
