Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine how many bales of hay the farmer will have left by the end of December after feeding his horses starting from September 1st. We will break down the problem into several steps:

### Step 1: Determine the Total Hay Harvested This Year

Last year, the farmer harvested 560 bales of hay from 5 acres per month. This year, he planted an additional 7 acres, making a total of \(5 + 7 = 12\) acres.

Assuming the yield per acre remains the same, we can calculate the total number of bales harvested per month this year:

\[
\text{Bales per acre per month} = \frac{560 \text{ bales}}{5 \text{ acres}} = 112 \text{ bales per acre per month}
\]

Thus, for 12 acres, the monthly harvest is:

\[
112 \text{ bales/acre/month} \times 12 \text{ acres} = 1344 \text{ bales/month}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the Total Hay Harvested by the End of August

Since the farmer starts feeding the horses from September, we need to calculate the total hay harvested from January to August (8 months):

\[
1344 \text{ bales/month} \times 8 \text{ months} = 10752 \text{ bales}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the Hay Consumption from September to December

The farmer owns 9 horses, and each horse consumes 3 bales of hay per day. Therefore, the daily consumption for all horses is:

\[
9 \text{ horses} \times 3 \text{ bales/horse/day} = 27 \text{ bales/day}
\]

We need to calculate the total consumption from September 1st to December 31st. This period covers 4 months: September, October, November, and December.

- September has 30 days
- October has 31 days
- November has 30 days
- December has 31 days

Total number of days from September to December:

\[
30 + 31 + 30 + 31 = 122 \text{ days}
\]

Total hay consumption over these 122 days:

\[
27 \text{ bales/day} \times 122 \text{ days} = 3294 \text{ bales}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the Remaining Hay by the End of December

Subtract the total hay consumed from the total hay harvested by the end of August:

\[
10752 \text{ bales} - 3294 \text{ bales} = 7458 \text{ bales}
\]

### Final Answer

By the end of December, the farmer will have 7458 bales of hay left.

\[
\boxed{7458}
\]
