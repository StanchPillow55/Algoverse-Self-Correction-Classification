Question ID: 404
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we will break it down into several steps:

1. **Calculate the total area of grass this year**:
   - Last year, the farmer had 5 acres of grass.
   - This year, he planted an additional 7 acres.
   - Total area of grass this year = 5 acres + 7 acres = 12 acres.

2. **Determine the hay production per month**:
   - Last year, the farmer harvested 560 bales of hay from 5 acres.
   - To find the production per acre, we divide the total bales by the number of acres:
     \[
     \text{Hay per acre} = \frac{560 \text{ bales}}{5 \text{ acres}} = 112 \text{ bales per acre}
     \]
   - This year, with 12 acres, the total hay production per month will be:
     \[
     \text{Total hay this year} = 12 \text{ acres} \times 112 \text{ bales per acre} = 1344 \text{ bales per month}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total hay harvested from September to December**:
   - The farmer will harvest hay for 4 months (September, October, November, December).
   - Total hay harvested from September to December:
     \[
     \text{Total hay from Sept to Dec} = 1344 \text{ bales/month} \times 4 \text{ months} = 5376 \text{ bales}
     \]

4. **Calculate the total hay consumption by the horses**:
   - The farmer has 9 horses, and each horse consumes 3 bales of hay per day.
   - Total daily consumption by all horses:
     \[
     \text{Daily consumption} = 9 \text{ horses} \times 3 \text{ bales/horse} = 27 \text{ bales/day}
     \]
   - Calculate the total consumption from September to December (4 months):
     - Number of days from September to December:
       - September: 30 days
       - October: 31 days
       - November: 30 days
       - December: 31 days
       - Total days = 30 + 31 + 30 + 31 = 122 days
     - Total hay consumed by horses over 122 days:
     \[
     \text{Total consumption} = 27 \text{ bales/day} \times 122 \text{ days} = 3294 \text{ bales}
     \]

5. **Calculate the remaining hay at the end of December**:
   - Total hay harvested from September to December = 5376 bales
   - Total hay consumed by horses = 3294 bales
   - Remaining hay:
   \[
   \text{Remaining hay} = 5376 \text{ bales} - 3294 \text{ bales} = 2082 \text{ bales}
   \]

Thus, the final answer is that the farmer would have **2082 bales of hay left by the end of December**.
