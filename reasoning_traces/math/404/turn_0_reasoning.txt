To find the average number of stripes on the zebras, we first need to determine the total number of stripes across all the zebras and then divide that total by the number of zebras.

1. **Identify the number of zebras and their stripes:**
   - Jane counts two zebras with 17 stripes each.
   - One zebra has 36 stripes.
   - One zebra has half of 36 stripes, which is \( \frac{36}{2} = 18 \) stripes.

2. **Calculate the total number of stripes:**
   - For the two zebras with 17 stripes each:
     \[
     2 \times 17 = 34 \text{ stripes}
     \]
   - For the zebra with 36 stripes:
     \[
     36 \text{ stripes}
     \]
   - For the zebra with 18 stripes:
     \[
     18 \text{ stripes}
     \]

3. **Add all the stripes together:**
   \[
   \text{Total stripes} = 34 + 36 + 18
   \]
   - First, add 34 and 36:
     \[
     34 + 36 = 70
     \]
   - Now add 18:
     \[
     70 + 18 = 88
     \]
   - Therefore, the total number of stripes is 88.

4. **Count the total number of zebras:**
   - There are 4 zebras in total (2 with 17 stripes, 1 with 36 stripes, and 1 with 18 stripes).

5. **Calculate the average number of stripes:**
   - The average is calculated by dividing the total number of stripes by the number of zebras:
   \[
   \text{Average stripes} = \frac{\text{Total stripes}}{\text{Number of zebras}} = \frac{88}{4}
   \]
   - Performing the division:
   \[
   \frac{88}{4} = 22
   \]

6. **Final answer:**
   The average number of stripes on the zebras is \( \boxed{22} \).
