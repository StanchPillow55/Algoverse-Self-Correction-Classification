To solve the problem, we will break it down into several steps:

1. **Calculate the total area of grass the farmer has this year.**
   - Last year, the farmer had 5 acres of grass.
   - This year, he planted an additional 7 acres.
   - Total area of grass this year = 5 acres + 7 acres = 12 acres.

2. **Determine how many bales of hay the farmer can harvest this year.**
   - Last year, the farmer harvested 560 bales from 5 acres.
   - To find the yield per acre, we divide the total bales by the number of acres:
     \[
     \text{Bales per acre} = \frac{560 \text{ bales}}{5 \text{ acres}} = 112 \text{ bales per acre}
     \]
   - This year, with 12 acres, the total harvest can be calculated as:
     \[
     \text{Total bales this year} = 12 \text{ acres} \times 112 \text{ bales per acre} = 1344 \text{ bales}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total hay consumption by the horses from September to December.**
   - The farmer has 9 horses, and each horse consumes 3 bales of hay per day.
   - Total daily consumption by all horses:
     \[
     \text{Daily consumption} = 9 \text{ horses} \times 3 \text{ bales/horse} = 27 \text{ bales per day}
     \]
   - We need to find out how many days are from September 1 to December 31. The total number of days in each month is:
     - September: 30 days
     - October: 31 days
     - November: 30 days
     - December: 31 days
   - Total days from September to December:
     \[
     \text{Total days} = 30 + 31 + 30 + 31 = 122 \text{ days}
     \]
   - Total hay consumption over these 122 days:
     \[
     \text{Total consumption} = 27 \text{ bales/day} \times 122 \text{ days} = 3294 \text{ bales}
     \]

4. **Calculate how many bales of hay the farmer has left at the end of December.**
   - The farmer harvested 1344 bales this year.
   - The total consumption by the horses is 3294 bales.
   - To find the remaining bales:
     \[
     \text{Remaining bales} = \text{Total harvested} - \text{Total consumption} = 1344 \text{ bales} - 3294 \text{ bales} = -1950 \text{ bales}
     \]

Since the result is negative, this indicates that the farmer does not have enough hay to feed the horses from September to December. 

Thus, the final answer is that the farmer will be short of hay by **1950 bales** by the end of December.
