To solve this problem, we need to determine how many bales of hay the farmer will have left by the end of December after feeding his horses starting from September. We'll break down the problem step by step.

### Step 1: Calculate the total number of bales harvested this year.

Last year, the farmer harvested 560 bales from 5 acres per month. This year, he planted an additional 7 acres, making a total of \(5 + 7 = 12\) acres.

Assuming the yield per acre remains the same, we can calculate the total number of bales harvested per month this year:

\[
\text{Bales per acre per month} = \frac{560 \text{ bales}}{5 \text{ acres}} = 112 \text{ bales per acre per month}
\]

Now, calculate the total bales harvested per month from 12 acres:

\[
\text{Total bales per month} = 112 \text{ bales/acre/month} \times 12 \text{ acres} = 1344 \text{ bales/month}
\]

Assuming the harvesting season is the same as last year, let's calculate the total bales harvested over the entire year. Since the problem doesn't specify the number of months the hay is harvested, we'll assume it's harvested every month of the year:

\[
\text{Total bales for the year} = 1344 \text{ bales/month} \times 12 \text{ months} = 16128 \text{ bales}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the total number of bales consumed by the horses from September to December.

The farmer has 9 horses, and each horse consumes 3 bales of hay per day. First, calculate the total daily consumption for all horses:

\[
\text{Daily consumption} = 9 \text{ horses} \times 3 \text{ bales/horse/day} = 27 \text{ bales/day}
\]

Next, calculate the total consumption from September 1st to December 31st. The number of days from September to December is:

- September: 30 days
- October: 31 days
- November: 30 days
- December: 31 days

Total days from September to December:

\[
30 + 31 + 30 + 31 = 122 \text{ days}
\]

Now, calculate the total bales consumed over these 122 days:

\[
\text{Total consumption} = 27 \text{ bales/day} \times 122 \text{ days} = 3294 \text{ bales}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the number of bales left by the end of December.

Subtract the total bales consumed by the horses from the total bales harvested:

\[
\text{Bales left} = 16128 \text{ bales} - 3294 \text{ bales} = 12834 \text{ bales}
\]

### Final Answer:

The farmer will have 12,834 bales of hay left by the end of December.
