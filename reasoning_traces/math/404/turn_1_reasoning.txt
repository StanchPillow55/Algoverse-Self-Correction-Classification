To solve this problem, we need to determine how many bales of hay the farmer will have left by the end of December after feeding his horses from September to December. Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Step 1: Calculate the Total Hay Production for This Year

Last year, the farmer harvested 560 bales of hay from 5 acres. This year, he planted an additional 7 acres, making a total of \(5 + 7 = 12\) acres.

Assuming the yield per acre remains the same, we can calculate the total hay production for this year:

\[
\text{Bales per acre} = \frac{560 \text{ bales}}{5 \text{ acres}} = 112 \text{ bales per acre}
\]

\[
\text{Total bales this year} = 112 \text{ bales/acre} \times 12 \text{ acres} = 1344 \text{ bales}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the Total Hay Consumption by Horses

The farmer owns 9 horses, and each horse consumes 3 bales of hay per day. Therefore, the total daily consumption is:

\[
\text{Daily consumption} = 9 \text{ horses} \times 3 \text{ bales/horse} = 27 \text{ bales/day}
\]

We need to calculate the total consumption from September 1st to December 31st. September, October, November, and December have 30, 31, 30, and 31 days respectively. So, the total number of days is:

\[
30 + 31 + 30 + 31 = 122 \text{ days}
\]

The total hay consumption over these 122 days is:

\[
\text{Total consumption} = 27 \text{ bales/day} \times 122 \text{ days} = 3294 \text{ bales}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the Remaining Hay

The farmer starts with 1344 bales of hay this year. After feeding the horses for 122 days, the remaining hay is:

\[
\text{Remaining hay} = 1344 \text{ bales} - 3294 \text{ bales} = -1950 \text{ bales}
\]

### Conclusion

The calculation shows a negative number of bales, indicating that the farmer will run out of hay before the end of December. Specifically, he will be short by 1950 bales by December 31st.

Therefore, the farmer will have no bales of hay left by the end of December, and he will need an additional 1950 bales to meet the demand.

**Final Answer:** The farmer will have 0 bales of hay left by the end of December and will be short by 1950 bales.
