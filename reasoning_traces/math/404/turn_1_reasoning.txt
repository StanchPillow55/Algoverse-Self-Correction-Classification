==================================================

To solve the problem, we will break it down into several steps:

1. **Determine the total area of grass this year**: 
   The farmer harvested hay from 5 acres last year and planted an additional 7 acres this year. Therefore, the total area of grass this year is:
   \[
   \text{Total acres} = 5 \text{ acres} + 7 \text{ acres} = 12 \text{ acres}
   \]

2. **Calculate the hay harvested this year**: 
   The farmer harvested 560 bales of hay from 5 acres last year. To find out how much hay he will harvest from 12 acres this year, we can set up a proportion:
   \[
   \text{Bales per acre} = \frac{560 \text{ bales}}{5 \text{ acres}} = 112 \text{ bales per acre}
   \]
   Now, we can calculate the total bales harvested from 12 acres:
   \[
   \text{Total bales this year} = 112 \text{ bales per acre} \times 12 \text{ acres} = 1344 \text{ bales}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total hay consumption by the horses**: 
   The farmer has 9 horses, and each horse consumes 3 bales of hay per day. Therefore, the total daily consumption of hay by the horses is:
   \[
   \text{Daily consumption} = 9 \text{ horses} \times 3 \text{ bales per horse} = 27 \text{ bales per day}
   \]
   We need to find out how many days are from September 1 to December 31. This period includes:
   - September: 30 days
   - October: 31 days
   - November: 30 days
   - December: 31 days

   Total days from September to December:
   \[
   \text{Total days} = 30 + 31 + 30 + 31 = 122 \text{ days}
   \]

   Now, we can calculate the total hay consumption over these 122 days:
   \[
   \text{Total consumption} = 27 \text{ bales per day} \times 122 \text{ days} = 3294 \text{ bales}
   \]

4. **Calculate the remaining bales of hay**: 
   The farmer harvested 1344 bales this year. To find out how many bales he has left after feeding the horses, we subtract the total consumption from the total harvested:
   \[
   \text{Remaining bales} = 1344 \text{ bales} - 3294 \text{ bales} = -1950 \text{ bales}
   \]

Since the result is negative, it indicates that the farmer will run out of hay before the end of December. 

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\text{The farmer will have } 0 \text{ bales left by the end of December, as he will run out of hay.}
\]
