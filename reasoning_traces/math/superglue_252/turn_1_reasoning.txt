==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 252" refers to. Since the problem statement is not clear and lacks specific details, I'll demonstrate how to approach a typical reasoning problem step by step. Let's assume a hypothetical reasoning problem and solve it.

### Hypothetical Problem:
A train travels from City A to City B at a speed of 60 km/h. After reaching City B, it immediately returns to City A at a speed of 90 km/h. The total round trip takes 5 hours. What is the distance between City A and City B?

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( d \) be the distance between City A and City B in kilometers.
   - The speed from City A to City B is 60 km/h.
   - The speed from City B to City A is 90 km/h.

2. **Set Up Equations:**
   - Time taken to travel from City A to City B: \( \frac{d}{60} \) hours.
   - Time taken to travel from City B to City A: \( \frac{d}{90} \) hours.
   - Total time for the round trip is 5 hours.

3. **Create the Equation:**
   \[
   \frac{d}{60} + \frac{d}{90} = 5
   \]

4. **Find a Common Denominator:**
   - The least common multiple of 60 and 90 is 180.
   - Rewrite the equation with a common denominator:
   \[
   \frac{3d}{180} + \frac{2d}{180} = 5
   \]

5. **Combine the Fractions:**
   \[
   \frac{3d + 2d}{180} = 5
   \]
   \[
   \frac{5d}{180} = 5
   \]

6. **Solve for \( d \):**
   - Multiply both sides by 180 to eliminate the fraction:
   \[
   5d = 5 \times 180
   \]
   \[
   5d = 900
   \]
   - Divide both sides by 5:
   \[
   d = \frac{900}{5}
   \]
   \[
   d = 180
   \]

### Final Answer:
The distance between City A and City B is 180 kilometers.

This solution demonstrates a structured approach to solving a reasoning problem involving distance, speed, and time. If "Sample reasoning question 252" refers to a different problem, please provide additional details for a specific solution.
