==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 252" refers to. Since this is not a standard math problem and lacks specific details, I'll assume it's a hypothetical reasoning question that involves mathematical thinking. Let's create a sample problem and solve it step by step.

### Sample Problem:
Suppose you have a sequence of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding numbers, starting with 1 and 1. What is the 10th number in this sequence?

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Identify the Sequence Type:**
   The sequence described is the Fibonacci sequence. The Fibonacci sequence starts with two 1s, and each subsequent number is the sum of the two preceding numbers.

2. **Write the First Few Terms:**
   Let's write out the first few terms of the Fibonacci sequence to identify a pattern:
   - \( F_1 = 1 \)
   - \( F_2 = 1 \)
   - \( F_3 = F_1 + F_2 = 1 + 1 = 2 \)
   - \( F_4 = F_2 + F_3 = 1 + 2 = 3 \)
   - \( F_5 = F_3 + F_4 = 2 + 3 = 5 \)
   - \( F_6 = F_4 + F_5 = 3 + 5 = 8 \)
   - \( F_7 = F_5 + F_6 = 5 + 8 = 13 \)
   - \( F_8 = F_6 + F_7 = 8 + 13 = 21 \)
   - \( F_9 = F_7 + F_8 = 13 + 21 = 34 \)
   - \( F_{10} = F_8 + F_9 = 21 + 34 = 55 \)

3. **Calculate the 10th Term:**
   From the calculations above, the 10th term in the Fibonacci sequence is 55.

4. **Verify the Calculation:**
   To ensure accuracy, let's quickly verify by recalculating the last few terms:
   - \( F_8 = 21 \)
   - \( F_9 = 34 \)
   - \( F_{10} = 21 + 34 = 55 \)

   The calculations are consistent.

### Final Answer:
The 10th number in the Fibonacci sequence is 55.
