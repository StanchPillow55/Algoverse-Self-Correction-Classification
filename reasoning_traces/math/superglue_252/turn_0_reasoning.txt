==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 252" refers to. Since the question is not explicitly provided, I will assume it is a generic math problem that requires logical reasoning and problem-solving skills. Let's create a sample problem and solve it step by step.

**Sample Problem:**

A store sells two types of candies: chocolate and gummy bears. The price of a chocolate candy is $0.50, and the price of a gummy bear is $0.20. A customer buys a total of 20 candies and spends $7.00. How many of each type of candy did the customer buy?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( x \) be the number of chocolate candies.
   - Let \( y \) be the number of gummy bears.

2. **Set Up Equations:**
   - The total number of candies is 20:
     \[
     x + y = 20
     \]
   - The total cost of the candies is $7.00:
     \[
     0.50x + 0.20y = 7.00
     \]

3. **Solve the System of Equations:**

   We have the system:
   \[
   \begin{align*}
   x + y &= 20 \quad \text{(Equation 1)} \\
   0.50x + 0.20y &= 7.00 \quad \text{(Equation 2)}
   \end{align*}
   \]

   **Step 1: Solve Equation 1 for \( y \):**
   \[
   y = 20 - x
   \]

   **Step 2: Substitute \( y = 20 - x \) into Equation 2:**
   \[
   0.50x + 0.20(20 - x) = 7.00
   \]

   **Step 3: Simplify and solve for \( x \):**
   \[
   0.50x + 4.00 - 0.20x = 7.00
   \]
   \[
   0.30x + 4.00 = 7.00
   \]
   \[
   0.30x = 3.00
   \]
   \[
   x = \frac{3.00}{0.30} = 10
   \]

   **Step 4: Substitute \( x = 10 \) back into Equation 1 to find \( y \):**
   \[
   10 + y = 20
   \]
   \[
   y = 20 - 10 = 10
   \]

4. **Verify the Solution:**

   - Total number of candies: \( x + y = 10 + 10 = 20 \) (Correct)
   - Total cost: \( 0.50 \times 10 + 0.20 \times 10 = 5.00 + 2.00 = 7.00 \) (Correct)

The solution satisfies both equations, confirming that the calculations are correct.

**Final Answer:**
The customer bought 10 chocolate candies and 10 gummy bears.
