==================================================

To solve the problem, we first need to understand what "Sample reasoning question 252" refers to. Since no specific details or numbers are provided in the question, I'll demonstrate a general approach to solving a typical math problem by creating a hypothetical problem and solving it step-by-step.

Let's assume "Sample reasoning question 252" is a problem involving algebraic equations. Here's a hypothetical problem:

**Problem:** Solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 3x + 5 = 20 \).

**Step 1: Understand the Problem**

The equation given is \( 3x + 5 = 20 \). Our goal is to find the value of \( x \) that makes this equation true.

**Step 2: Isolate the Variable**

To solve for \( x \), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We start by eliminating the constant term on the left side of the equation.

- Subtract 5 from both sides of the equation:

  \[
  3x + 5 - 5 = 20 - 5
  \]

  Simplifying both sides gives:

  \[
  3x = 15
  \]

**Step 3: Solve for \( x \)**

Now that we have \( 3x = 15 \), we need to solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides by 3:

- Divide both sides by 3:

  \[
  \frac{3x}{3} = \frac{15}{3}
  \]

  Simplifying both sides gives:

  \[
  x = 5
  \]

**Step 4: Verify the Solution**

To ensure our solution is correct, we substitute \( x = 5 \) back into the original equation:

- Substitute \( x = 5 \) into \( 3x + 5 = 20 \):

  \[
  3(5) + 5 = 20
  \]

  Simplifying the left side gives:

  \[
  15 + 5 = 20
  \]

  \[
  20 = 20
  \]

Since both sides of the equation are equal, our solution \( x = 5 \) is verified.

**Final Answer:**

The solution to the equation \( 3x + 5 = 20 \) is \( x = 5 \).
