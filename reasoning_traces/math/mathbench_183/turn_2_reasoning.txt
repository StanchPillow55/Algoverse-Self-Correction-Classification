Question ID: mathbench_183
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 183," we need to first understand what the problem is asking. However, since "Sample math problem 183" is not a specific problem statement, I'll create a hypothetical math problem to demonstrate how to solve it step by step.

Let's assume the problem is as follows:

**Problem 183:**
If \( x + 3 = 7 \), what is the value of \( x \)?

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Understand the Equation:**
   The equation given is \( x + 3 = 7 \). This is a simple linear equation where we need to solve for the variable \( x \).

2. **Isolate the Variable:**
   To find the value of \( x \), we need to isolate \( x \) on one side of the equation. We can do this by performing the same operation on both sides of the equation to maintain equality.

3. **Subtract 3 from Both Sides:**
   \[
   x + 3 - 3 = 7 - 3
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   x = 4
   \]

4. **Verify the Solution:**
   To ensure our solution is correct, we substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation:
   \[
   4 + 3 = 7
   \]
   Since both sides of the equation are equal, our solution is verified.

5. **State the Final Answer:**
   The value of \( x \) is \( 4 \).

Thus, the final answer to the problem is \( x = 4 \).
