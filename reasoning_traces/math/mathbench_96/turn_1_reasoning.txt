==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 96," we need to first understand what the problem is asking. However, the problem statement is not clear from the given text. It seems like "Sample math problem 96" is a placeholder or reference to a specific problem, but without additional context or details, we cannot directly solve it.

Let's assume that "Sample math problem 96" refers to a typical math problem involving the number 96. I'll create a problem involving the number 96 and solve it step by step.

**Problem:**  
Find the prime factorization of 96 and determine the number of divisors it has.

**Step 1: Prime Factorization of 96**

To find the prime factorization of 96, we start by dividing it by the smallest prime number, which is 2, and continue dividing by 2 until we can no longer do so evenly.

1. \( 96 \div 2 = 48 \)
2. \( 48 \div 2 = 24 \)
3. \( 24 \div 2 = 12 \)
4. \( 12 \div 2 = 6 \)
5. \( 6 \div 2 = 3 \)

Now, 3 is a prime number and cannot be divided by 2. The next smallest prime number is 3.

6. \( 3 \div 3 = 1 \)

Thus, the prime factorization of 96 is:
\[ 96 = 2^5 \times 3^1 \]

**Step 2: Determine the Number of Divisors**

To find the number of divisors of a number given its prime factorization, use the formula:
\[ (e_1 + 1)(e_2 + 1)\ldots(e_n + 1) \]
where \( e_1, e_2, \ldots, e_n \) are the exponents in the prime factorization.

For 96, the prime factorization is \( 2^5 \times 3^1 \). Therefore, the exponents are 5 and 1.

The number of divisors is:
\[ (5 + 1)(1 + 1) = 6 \times 2 = 12 \]

**Final Answer:**

The prime factorization of 96 is \( 2^5 \times 3^1 \), and it has 12 divisors.
