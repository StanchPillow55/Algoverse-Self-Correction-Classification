==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample math problem 96" refers to. Since the problem is not explicitly stated, I'll assume it involves the number 96 in some mathematical context. Let's consider a few possibilities and solve them step by step.

### Possibility 1: Factorization of 96

Let's factor 96 into its prime factors.

1. **Divide by 2**: 96 is even, so divide by 2.
   \[
   96 \div 2 = 48
   \]
2. **Divide by 2 again**: 48 is even, so divide by 2.
   \[
   48 \div 2 = 24
   \]
3. **Divide by 2 again**: 24 is even, so divide by 2.
   \[
   24 \div 2 = 12
   \]
4. **Divide by 2 again**: 12 is even, so divide by 2.
   \[
   12 \div 2 = 6
   \]
5. **Divide by 2 again**: 6 is even, so divide by 2.
   \[
   6 \div 2 = 3
   \]
6. **Divide by 3**: 3 is a prime number.
   \[
   3 \div 3 = 1
   \]

So, the prime factorization of 96 is:
\[
96 = 2^5 \times 3^1
\]

### Possibility 2: Calculate the Square Root of 96

Let's calculate the square root of 96.

1. **Estimate**: We know \(9^2 = 81\) and \(10^2 = 100\), so \(\sqrt{96}\) is between 9 and 10.
2. **Refine**: Try 9.5.
   \[
   9.5^2 = 90.25
   \]
   Try 9.8.
   \[
   9.8^2 = 96.04
   \]
   Try 9.7.
   \[
   9.7^2 = 94.09
   \]

Since \(9.8^2\) is closer to 96, \(\sqrt{96} \approx 9.8\).

### Possibility 3: Solve an Equation Involving 96

Suppose we have an equation like \(x + 96 = 150\). Solve for \(x\).

1. **Subtract 96 from both sides**:
   \[
   x + 96 - 96 = 150 - 96
   \]
   \[
   x = 54
   \]

### Conclusion

Without a specific problem statement, I've explored a few mathematical contexts involving the number 96. If you have a specific problem in mind, please provide more details. Otherwise, here are the results from the scenarios considered:

1. **Prime Factorization**: \(96 = 2^5 \times 3^1\)
2. **Square Root**: \(\sqrt{96} \approx 9.8\)
3. **Equation Solution**: If \(x + 96 = 150\), then \(x = 54\).

If any of these scenarios match your intended problem, the final answer is provided accordingly.
