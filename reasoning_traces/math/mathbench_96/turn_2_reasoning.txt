Question ID: mathbench_96
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we first need to understand what "Sample math problem 96" refers to. Since no specific problem is provided, I'll assume this is a placeholder for a typical math problem. Let's create a hypothetical problem and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem 96:**

"Calculate the area of a triangle with a base of 12 units and a height of 9 units."

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Formula for the Area of a Triangle:**

   The area \( A \) of a triangle can be calculated using the formula:
   \[
   A = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height}
   \]

2. **Identify the Given Values:**

   From the problem, we know:
   - The base of the triangle \( b = 12 \) units
   - The height of the triangle \( h = 9 \) units

3. **Substitute the Values into the Formula:**

   Substitute the known values into the area formula:
   \[
   A = \frac{1}{2} \times 12 \times 9
   \]

4. **Perform the Multiplication:**

   First, multiply the base and height:
   \[
   12 \times 9 = 108
   \]

5. **Calculate the Area:**

   Now, multiply the result by \(\frac{1}{2}\):
   \[
   A = \frac{1}{2} \times 108 = 54
   \]

6. **State the Final Answer:**

   The area of the triangle is \( 54 \) square units.

This completes the solution to the hypothetical problem. If "Sample math problem 96" refers to a different problem, please provide the specific details, and I will solve it accordingly.
