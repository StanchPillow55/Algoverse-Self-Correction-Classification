Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we first need to understand what "Sample math problem 96" refers to. Since no specific problem is given, I'll assume a generic math problem involving the number 96. Let's create a problem involving 96 and solve it step by step.

**Problem:**
Calculate the sum of the digits of the number 96, then multiply the result by 3. Finally, subtract 10 from the product.

**Step 1: Calculate the sum of the digits of 96.**

The number 96 has two digits: 9 and 6.

Sum of the digits = 9 + 6 = 15

**Step 2: Multiply the sum by 3.**

Now, we take the sum of the digits, which is 15, and multiply it by 3.

15 Ã— 3 = 45

**Step 3: Subtract 10 from the product.**

Finally, we subtract 10 from the product obtained in Step 2.

45 - 10 = 35

**Final Answer:**

The final result after performing all the operations is 35.
