==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample math problem 96" refers to. Since the problem isn't explicitly stated, I'll assume it involves a common type of math problem that could be associated with the number 96. Let's consider a few possibilities and solve them:

### Possibility 1: Basic Arithmetic Problem
Let's assume the problem is to find the sum of the digits of 96.

1. **Identify the digits of 96**: The number 96 has two digits, 9 and 6.
2. **Add the digits together**: 
   \[
   9 + 6 = 15
   \]

**Final Answer**: The sum of the digits of 96 is 15.

### Possibility 2: Prime Factorization
Let's assume the problem is to find the prime factorization of 96.

1. **Divide by the smallest prime number, 2**:
   \[
   96 \div 2 = 48
   \]
2. **Continue dividing by 2**:
   \[
   48 \div 2 = 24
   \]
   \[
   24 \div 2 = 12
   \]
   \[
   12 \div 2 = 6
   \]
   \[
   6 \div 2 = 3
   \]
3. **3 is a prime number**: So, we stop here.

The prime factorization of 96 is \(2^5 \times 3\).

**Final Answer**: The prime factorization of 96 is \(2^5 \times 3\).

### Possibility 3: Solving an Equation
Let's assume the problem involves solving a simple equation like \(x + 96 = 0\).

1. **Isolate \(x\)**:
   \[
   x + 96 = 0
   \]
   \[
   x = 0 - 96
   \]
   \[
   x = -96
   \]

**Final Answer**: The solution to the equation \(x + 96 = 0\) is \(x = -96\).

### Possibility 4: Percentage Problem
Let's assume the problem is to find 96% of a number, say 100.

1. **Convert the percentage to a decimal**:
   \[
   96\% = 0.96
   \]
2. **Multiply by the number**:
   \[
   0.96 \times 100 = 96
   \]

**Final Answer**: 96% of 100 is 96.

Without a specific problem statement, these are some reasonable interpretations of "Sample math problem 96." If you have a specific problem in mind, please provide more details, and I can solve that particular problem.
