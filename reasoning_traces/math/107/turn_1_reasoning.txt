==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of cars that travel down Happy Street for each day of the week and then sum these values to find the total for the entire week.

Let's break it down day by day:

1. **Tuesday:**
   - We are given that 25 cars pass on Tuesday.

2. **Monday:**
   - On Monday, there are 20% less cars than on Tuesday.
   - First, calculate 20% of the number of cars on Tuesday:  
     \[
     20\% \text{ of } 25 = 0.20 \times 25 = 5
     \]
   - Subtract this from the number of cars on Tuesday to find the number of cars on Monday:  
     \[
     25 - 5 = 20
     \]

3. **Wednesday:**
   - On Wednesday, there are 2 more cars than on Monday.
   - Add 2 to the number of cars on Monday:  
     \[
     20 + 2 = 22
     \]

4. **Thursday and Friday:**
   - We are told there are about 10 cars each day.
   - Therefore, for both Thursday and Friday, the number of cars is 10 each.

5. **Saturday and Sunday (Weekend):**
   - On both Saturday and Sunday, traffic drops to 5 cars per day.

Now, let's calculate the total number of cars for the week by summing the cars for each day:

- Monday: 20 cars
- Tuesday: 25 cars
- Wednesday: 22 cars
- Thursday: 10 cars
- Friday: 10 cars
- Saturday: 5 cars
- Sunday: 5 cars

Add these values together to find the total number of cars for the week:

\[
20 + 25 + 22 + 10 + 10 + 5 + 5 = 97
\]

Therefore, the total number of cars that travel down Happy Street from Monday through Sunday is \(\boxed{97}\).
