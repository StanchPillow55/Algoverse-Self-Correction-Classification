To solve the problem, we will first calculate the total time Frankie spent watching TV on each day from Monday to Friday, and then use that information to find out how many 30-minute episodes he watched on Wednesday.

1. **Calculate TV time for each day:**
   - **Monday:** Watched 1 hour (1 episode of 1 hour).
   - **Tuesday:** Watched 1 hour (1 episode of 1 hour).
   - **Wednesday:** Watched a few episodes of a 30-minute show. Letâ€™s denote the number of 30-minute episodes he watched as \( x \). The total time spent watching on Wednesday will be \( 0.5x \) hours (since each episode is 0.5 hours).
   - **Thursday:** Watched 1 hour (1 episode of 1 hour) and 0.5 hours (1 episode of 30 minutes). Total for Thursday = \( 1 + 0.5 = 1.5 \) hours.
   - **Friday:** Watched 2 hours (2 episodes of 1 hour). Total for Friday = \( 2 \) hours.

2. **Sum up the total TV time:**
   - Total TV time = Time on Monday + Time on Tuesday + Time on Wednesday + Time on Thursday + Time on Friday
   - Total TV time = \( 1 + 1 + 0.5x + 1.5 + 2 \)

3. **Combine the constants:**
   - Total TV time = \( 1 + 1 + 1.5 + 2 + 0.5x = 5.5 + 0.5x \)

4. **Set up the equation based on the total TV time:**
   - We know from the problem that Frankie watched a total of 7 hours of TV.
   - Therefore, we can set up the equation:
   \[
   5.5 + 0.5x = 7
   \]

5. **Solve for \( x \):**
   - Subtract 5.5 from both sides:
   \[
   0.5x = 7 - 5.5
   \]
   \[
   0.5x = 1.5
   \]
   - Now, divide both sides by 0.5:
   \[
   x = \frac{1.5}{0.5} = 3
   \]

6. **Conclusion:**
   - Frankie watched \( \boxed{3} \) episodes of the 30-minute show on Wednesday.
