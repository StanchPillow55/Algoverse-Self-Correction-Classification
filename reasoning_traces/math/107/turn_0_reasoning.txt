To solve the problem, we will calculate the number of cars that pass Happy Street each day from Monday through Sunday, and then sum these values to find the total traffic for the week.

1. **Traffic on Tuesday**: 
   - Given that 25 cars pass on Tuesday.
   \[
   \text{Tuesday} = 25 \text{ cars}
   \]

2. **Traffic on Monday**: 
   - It is stated that the traffic on Monday is 20% less than on Tuesday. 
   - To find 20% of Tuesday's traffic:
   \[
   20\% \text{ of } 25 = 0.20 \times 25 = 5
   \]
   - Therefore, the number of cars on Monday is:
   \[
   \text{Monday} = 25 - 5 = 20 \text{ cars}
   \]

3. **Traffic on Wednesday**: 
   - It is stated that Wednesday has 2 more cars than Monday.
   \[
   \text{Wednesday} = 20 + 2 = 22 \text{ cars}
   \]

4. **Traffic on Thursday and Friday**: 
   - It is given that both Thursday and Friday have about 10 cars each day.
   \[
   \text{Thursday} = 10 \text{ cars}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Friday} = 10 \text{ cars}
   \]

5. **Traffic on Saturday and Sunday**: 
   - On the weekend, traffic drops to 5 cars per day.
   \[
   \text{Saturday} = 5 \text{ cars}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Sunday} = 5 \text{ cars}
   \]

Now we will sum the number of cars for each day of the week:

\[
\text{Total cars} = \text{Monday} + \text{Tuesday} + \text{Wednesday} + \text{Thursday} + \text{Friday} + \text{Saturday} + \text{Sunday}
\]
Substituting in the values we calculated:
\[
\text{Total cars} = 20 + 25 + 22 + 10 + 10 + 5 + 5
\]

Now we perform the addition step-by-step:
\[
20 + 25 = 45
\]
\[
45 + 22 = 67
\]
\[
67 + 10 = 77
\]
\[
77 + 10 = 87
\]
\[
87 + 5 = 92
\]
\[
92 + 5 = 97
\]

Thus, the total number of cars that travel down Happy Street from Monday through Sunday is:
\[
\boxed{97}
\]
