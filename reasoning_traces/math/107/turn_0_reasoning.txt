To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of cars passing down Happy Street each day from Monday through Sunday and then sum these numbers to find the total for the week.

Let's break it down day by day:

1. **Tuesday:**
   - We are given that 25 cars pass on Tuesday.

2. **Monday:**
   - On Monday, there are 20% fewer cars than on Tuesday.
   - First, calculate 20% of 25 cars: 
     \[
     0.20 \times 25 = 5
     \]
   - Therefore, on Monday, there are:
     \[
     25 - 5 = 20 \text{ cars}
     \]

3. **Wednesday:**
   - On Wednesday, there are 2 more cars than on Monday.
   - Therefore, on Wednesday, there are:
     \[
     20 + 2 = 22 \text{ cars}
     \]

4. **Thursday and Friday:**
   - We are told that there are about 10 cars each day on Thursday and Friday.
   - Therefore, on both Thursday and Friday, there are:
     \[
     10 \text{ cars each day}
     \]

5. **Saturday and Sunday (Weekend):**
   - On the weekend, traffic drops to 5 cars per day.
   - Therefore, on both Saturday and Sunday, there are:
     \[
     5 \text{ cars each day}
     \]

Now, let's add up the number of cars for each day from Monday through Sunday:

- Monday: 20 cars
- Tuesday: 25 cars
- Wednesday: 22 cars
- Thursday: 10 cars
- Friday: 10 cars
- Saturday: 5 cars
- Sunday: 5 cars

Adding these together gives the total number of cars for the week:
\[
20 + 25 + 22 + 10 + 10 + 5 + 5 = 97
\]

Therefore, the total number of cars that travel down Happy Street from Monday through Sunday is \(\boxed{97}\).
