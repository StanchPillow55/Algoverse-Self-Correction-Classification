Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 114" refers to. However, without specific details or context about what "Sample reasoning question 114" entails, we can't directly solve it. 

Let's assume that "Sample reasoning question 114" is a placeholder for a typical math problem. Since no specific problem is provided, I'll demonstrate how to solve a generic math problem step by step. Let's consider a common type of problem: solving a linear equation.

**Problem Example:**
Solve the equation \(2x + 3 = 11\).

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Equation:**
   The equation \(2x + 3 = 11\) is a linear equation in one variable, \(x\). Our goal is to find the value of \(x\) that makes this equation true.

2. **Isolate the Variable:**
   To solve for \(x\), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We start by eliminating the constant term on the left side.

   \[
   2x + 3 = 11
   \]

   Subtract 3 from both sides to get:

   \[
   2x + 3 - 3 = 11 - 3
   \]

   Simplifying both sides gives:

   \[
   2x = 8
   \]

3. **Solve for \(x\):**
   Now, divide both sides by 2 to solve for \(x\).

   \[
   \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{8}{2}
   \]

   Simplifying both sides gives:

   \[
   x = 4
   \]

4. **Verify the Solution:**
   Substitute \(x = 4\) back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies the equation.

   \[
   2(4) + 3 = 11
   \]

   Simplifying the left side gives:

   \[
   8 + 3 = 11
   \]

   Since both sides of the equation are equal, our solution \(x = 4\) is correct.

**Final Answer:**
The solution to the equation \(2x + 3 = 11\) is \(x = 4\).

If "Sample reasoning question 114" refers to a different problem, please provide the specific details or context, and I will be happy to solve it accordingly.
