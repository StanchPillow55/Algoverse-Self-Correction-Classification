Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we first need to understand what "Sample reasoning question 114" refers to. Unfortunately, without additional context or details about the specific problem, it's impossible to provide a precise solution. However, I can guide you through a general approach to solving reasoning problems, which often involve logical deduction, pattern recognition, or mathematical calculations.

### General Approach to Solving Reasoning Problems

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - Carefully read the problem statement.
   - Identify what is being asked.
   - Note any specific details or constraints provided.

2. **Identify the Type of Problem:**
   - Determine if the problem involves numerical calculations, logical reasoning, pattern recognition, or another type of reasoning.

3. **Break Down the Problem:**
   - Divide the problem into smaller, manageable parts.
   - Solve each part step by step.

4. **Apply Relevant Concepts:**
   - Use mathematical formulas, logical rules, or pattern recognition techniques as needed.
   - Ensure each step logically follows from the previous one.

5. **Check Your Work:**
   - Review each step to ensure accuracy.
   - Verify that the solution satisfies all given conditions.

6. **State the Final Answer:**
   - Clearly present the solution to the problem.
   - Ensure the answer is in the correct format as required by the problem.

### Example Problem and Solution

Let's create a hypothetical reasoning problem to illustrate the process:

**Problem:**
A sequence of numbers is defined as follows: The first term is 2, and each subsequent term is the previous term multiplied by 3. What is the 5th term in this sequence?

**Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We have a sequence where each term is obtained by multiplying the previous term by 3.
   - We need to find the 5th term.

2. **Identify the Type of Problem:**
   - This is a sequence problem involving geometric progression.

3. **Break Down the Problem:**
   - First term (\(a_1\)) = 2
   - Common ratio (\(r\)) = 3

4. **Apply Relevant Concepts:**
   - The nth term of a geometric sequence is given by: \(a_n = a_1 \times r^{(n-1)}\)
   - For the 5th term (\(a_5\)): 
     \[
     a_5 = 2 \times 3^{(5-1)} = 2 \times 3^4
     \]

5. **Calculate:**
   - \(3^4 = 3 \times 3 \times 3 \times 3 = 81\)
   - \(a_5 = 2 \times 81 = 162\)

6. **Check Your Work:**
   - Verify calculations: \(3^4 = 81\) and \(2 \times 81 = 162\).

7. **State the Final Answer:**
   - The 5th term in the sequence is 162.

### Conclusion

Without specific details about "Sample reasoning question 114," this general approach provides a framework for tackling reasoning problems. If you have more information or a specific problem statement, please provide it, and I can offer a more targeted solution.
