==================================================

To solve the problem, let's first understand what "Sample reasoning question 114" might entail. Since the problem statement is not explicitly given, I'll assume a generic math problem-solving approach and demonstrate how to tackle a typical math question step-by-step. 

Let's assume a sample math problem for demonstration:

**Problem:**  
A farmer has a rectangular field that is 100 meters long and 60 meters wide. He wants to divide the field into two equal parts by building a fence parallel to the shorter side. What is the length of the fence?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We have a rectangular field with dimensions 100 meters (length) and 60 meters (width).
   - The farmer wants to divide the field into two equal parts using a fence parallel to the shorter side (width).

2. **Visualize the Problem:**
   - The field is a rectangle with the longer side being 100 meters and the shorter side being 60 meters.
   - To divide the field into two equal parts, the fence should be parallel to the 60-meter side.

3. **Determine the Position of the Fence:**
   - Since the fence is parallel to the 60-meter side, it will run along the length of the field.
   - The length of the fence will be equal to the length of the field.

4. **Calculate the Length of the Fence:**
   - The length of the fence is the same as the length of the field, which is 100 meters.

5. **Verify the Solution:**
   - Dividing the field into two equal parts means each part will have an area of half the total area of the field.
   - Total area of the field = 100 meters * 60 meters = 6000 square meters.
   - Area of each part = 6000 square meters / 2 = 3000 square meters.
   - Each part will have dimensions of 50 meters (half of 100 meters) by 60 meters, confirming that the fence length is correct.

6. **State the Final Answer:**
   - The length of the fence required to divide the field into two equal parts is 100 meters.

By following these steps, we have solved the problem systematically and arrived at the final answer. If you have a specific problem or need further assistance, please provide more details or clarify the question.
