==================================================

To solve the problem effectively, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 114" entails. However, since the problem statement is not provided, I'll demonstrate a general approach to solving a typical math problem by making reasonable assumptions about what such a problem might involve. Let's assume this is a typical algebra problem, and I'll walk through a hypothetical example.

**Hypothetical Problem:**
Solve for \( x \) in the equation: \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We need to find the value of \( x \) that satisfies the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).

2. **Isolate the Variable:**
   - To solve for \( x \), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We start by eliminating the constant term on the left side.
   - Subtract 3 from both sides of the equation:
     \[
     2x + 3 - 3 = 11 - 3
     \]
     \[
     2x = 8
     \]

3. **Solve for \( x \):**
   - Now, we need to solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides of the equation by 2:
     \[
     \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{8}{2}
     \]
     \[
     x = 4
     \]

4. **Verify the Solution:**
   - Substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies the equation:
     \[
     2(4) + 3 = 11
     \]
     \[
     8 + 3 = 11
     \]
   - Since both sides of the equation are equal, our solution is verified.

5. **State the Final Answer:**
   - The solution to the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \) is \( x = 4 \).

This example demonstrates a structured approach to solving a simple algebraic equation. If "Sample reasoning question 114" refers to a different type of problem, please provide more details or context so I can tailor the solution to that specific problem.
