Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine how many calories Ian burns after jogging for 5 days. We'll break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the distance Ian jogs each night:**
   - Ian jogs 5 laps around the complex each night.
   - Each lap is 100 feet.
   - Therefore, the total distance Ian jogs each night is:
     \[
     5 \text{ laps} \times 100 \text{ feet/lap} = 500 \text{ feet}
     \]

2. **Calculate the number of calories burned per night:**
   - It takes 25 feet of jogging to burn 1 calorie.
   - Therefore, the number of calories Ian burns each night is:
     \[
     \frac{500 \text{ feet}}{25 \text{ feet/calorie}} = 20 \text{ calories}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total number of calories burned over 5 days:**
   - Ian jogs every night for 5 days.
   - Therefore, the total number of calories burned over 5 days is:
     \[
     20 \text{ calories/night} \times 5 \text{ nights} = 100 \text{ calories}
     \]

Thus, after 5 days of jogging, Ian burns a total of 100 calories.

**Final Answer: Ian burns 100 calories after 5 days of jogging.**
