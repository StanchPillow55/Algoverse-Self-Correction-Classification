==================================================

To determine how many calories Ian burns after jogging for 5 days, we will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total distance Ian jogs in one night.**
   - Each lap around the complex is 100 feet.
   - Ian jogs 5 laps each night.
   - Therefore, the total distance jogged in one night is:
     \[
     \text{Total distance in one night} = \text{Number of laps} \times \text{Distance per lap} = 5 \times 100 \text{ feet} = 500 \text{ feet}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total distance jogged in 5 days.**
   - If Ian jogs 500 feet each night, over 5 nights, the total distance is:
     \[
     \text{Total distance in 5 days} = \text{Distance per night} \times \text{Number of nights} = 500 \text{ feet} \times 5 = 2500 \text{ feet}
     \]

3. **Determine how many calories Ian burns based on the distance jogged.**
   - It takes 25 feet of jogging to burn 1 calorie.
   - To find out how many calories Ian burns for the total distance of 2500 feet, we divide the total distance by the distance required to burn one calorie:
     \[
     \text{Calories burned} = \frac{\text{Total distance}}{\text{Distance per calorie}} = \frac{2500 \text{ feet}}{25 \text{ feet/calorie}} = 100 \text{ calories}
     \]

4. **Final answer:**
   - After jogging for 5 days, Ian burns a total of:
     \[
     \boxed{100} \text{ calories}
     \]
