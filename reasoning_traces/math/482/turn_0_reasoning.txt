To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of calories Ian burns after jogging for 5 days, given the specific details about his jogging routine.

### Step-by-Step Calculation:

1. **Determine the distance Ian jogs each night:**

   - Ian does 5 laps around the apartment complex each night.
   - Each lap is 100 feet.
   
   To find the total distance jogged each night, we multiply the number of laps by the distance per lap:

   \[
   \text{Total distance per night} = 5 \text{ laps} \times 100 \text{ feet/lap} = 500 \text{ feet}
   \]

2. **Calculate the number of calories burned each night:**

   - We know that it takes 25 feet of jogging to burn 1 calorie.
   
   To find out how many calories Ian burns each night, we divide the total distance jogged by the number of feet per calorie:

   \[
   \text{Calories burned per night} = \frac{500 \text{ feet}}{25 \text{ feet/calorie}} = 20 \text{ calories}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total number of calories burned over 5 days:**

   - Ian jogs every night for 5 days.
   
   To find the total calories burned over these 5 days, we multiply the calories burned per night by the number of days:

   \[
   \text{Total calories burned over 5 days} = 20 \text{ calories/night} \times 5 \text{ nights} = 100 \text{ calories}
   \]

### Final Answer:

After 5 days of jogging, Ian burns a total of 100 calories.
