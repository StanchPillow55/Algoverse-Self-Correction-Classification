Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine how many calories Ian burns after jogging for 5 days, given the details provided.

**Step 1: Calculate the total distance Ian jogs each night.**

Ian jogs 5 laps around the complex each night, and each lap is 100 feet. Therefore, the total distance he jogs each night is:

\[ 
5 \text{ laps} \times 100 \text{ feet/lap} = 500 \text{ feet}
\]

**Step 2: Determine how many calories Ian burns each night.**

We know that Ian burns 1 calorie for every 25 feet he jogs. To find out how many calories he burns each night, we divide the total distance he jogs by the number of feet per calorie:

\[ 
\frac{500 \text{ feet}}{25 \text{ feet/calorie}} = 20 \text{ calories}
\]

So, Ian burns 20 calories each night.

**Step 3: Calculate the total calories burned over 5 days.**

Ian jogs every night for 5 days. Therefore, the total number of calories he burns over 5 days is:

\[ 
20 \text{ calories/night} \times 5 \text{ nights} = 100 \text{ calories}
\]

**Final Answer:**

Ian burns a total of 100 calories after 5 days of jogging.
