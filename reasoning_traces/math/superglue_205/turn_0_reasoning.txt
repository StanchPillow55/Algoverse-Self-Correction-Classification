==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 205" refers to. Since this is not a standard math problem or a commonly known question, I will assume it is a placeholder for a specific type of reasoning problem. Without specific details, I'll demonstrate how to approach a typical reasoning problem step by step.

Let's assume "Sample reasoning question 205" is a logical reasoning problem involving a sequence or pattern. Here's a hypothetical example:

**Problem:** Consider the sequence: 2, 4, 8, 16, ... What is the 7th term in this sequence?

**Step-by-step Solution:**

1. **Identify the Pattern:**
   - Look at the sequence: 2, 4, 8, 16, ...
   - Notice that each term is obtained by multiplying the previous term by 2.
   - This is a geometric sequence where each term is double the previous one.

2. **Write the General Formula:**
   - For a geometric sequence, the nth term \( a_n \) can be expressed as:
     \[
     a_n = a_1 \times r^{(n-1)}
     \]
     where \( a_1 \) is the first term and \( r \) is the common ratio.
   - Here, \( a_1 = 2 \) and \( r = 2 \).

3. **Calculate the 7th Term:**
   - Substitute \( n = 7 \) into the formula:
     \[
     a_7 = 2 \times 2^{(7-1)}
     \]
     \[
     a_7 = 2 \times 2^6
     \]
     \[
     a_7 = 2 \times 64
     \]
     \[
     a_7 = 128
     \]

4. **Verify the Calculation:**
   - Let's verify by listing the terms up to the 7th term:
     - 1st term: \( 2 \)
     - 2nd term: \( 2 \times 2 = 4 \)
     - 3rd term: \( 4 \times 2 = 8 \)
     - 4th term: \( 8 \times 2 = 16 \)
     - 5th term: \( 16 \times 2 = 32 \)
     - 6th term: \( 32 \times 2 = 64 \)
     - 7th term: \( 64 \times 2 = 128 \)

The calculations confirm that the pattern is consistent and the 7th term is indeed 128.

**Final Answer:**
The 7th term in the sequence is 128.
