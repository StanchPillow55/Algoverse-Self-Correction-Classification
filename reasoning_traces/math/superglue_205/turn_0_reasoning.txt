==================================================

It seems like the problem statement is incomplete or unclear. "Sample reasoning question 205" doesn't provide enough information for me to solve a specific math problem. However, I can guide you through a general approach to solving math problems using logical reasoning. If you have a specific problem in mind, please provide the details, and I'll be happy to help.

Here's a general approach to solving math problems:

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - Read the problem carefully.
   - Identify what is being asked.
   - Determine what information is given and what needs to be found.

2. **Devise a Plan:**
   - Consider possible strategies to solve the problem (e.g., drawing a diagram, creating an equation, using a formula, etc.).
   - Choose the most appropriate strategy based on the problem type.

3. **Carry Out the Plan:**
   - Execute the chosen strategy step by step.
   - Perform calculations carefully and check each step for accuracy.
   - Keep track of units and ensure consistency throughout the calculations.

4. **Review/Check the Solution:**
   - Verify that the solution answers the question posed in the problem.
   - Check the calculations for any errors.
   - Consider whether the solution is reasonable and makes sense in the context of the problem.

5. **State the Final Answer:**
   - Clearly present the final answer, including units if applicable.
   - Ensure the answer is in the correct format as required by the problem.

If you have a specific math problem you'd like me to solve, please provide the details, and I'll work through it using the steps outlined above.
