==================================================

To solve the problem effectively, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 205" entails. Since the problem statement itself is not provided, I'll demonstrate a generic approach to solving a math problem step by step, using a hypothetical problem as an example.

Let's assume the problem is as follows:

**Problem:** A farmer has a rectangular field that is 100 meters long and 60 meters wide. He wants to divide the field into two equal areas by constructing a fence parallel to one of the sides. What is the length of the fence?

**Step 1: Understand the Problem**

The field is rectangular, with a length of 100 meters and a width of 60 meters. The farmer wants to divide this field into two equal areas using a fence parallel to one of the sides.

**Step 2: Calculate the Total Area of the Field**

The area \( A \) of a rectangle is given by the formula:
\[ A = \text{length} \times \text{width} \]

For this field:
\[ A = 100 \, \text{meters} \times 60 \, \text{meters} = 6000 \, \text{square meters} \]

**Step 3: Determine the Area of Each Section**

Since the farmer wants to divide the field into two equal areas, each section should have an area of:
\[ \frac{6000 \, \text{square meters}}{2} = 3000 \, \text{square meters} \]

**Step 4: Determine the Orientation of the Fence**

The fence can be parallel to either the length or the width of the field. Let's consider both scenarios:

1. **Fence Parallel to the Length (100 meters):**

   If the fence is parallel to the length, it will divide the width into two equal parts. Let \( x \) be the width of each section:
   \[ 100 \times x = 3000 \]
   \[ x = \frac{3000}{100} = 30 \, \text{meters} \]

   Thus, the fence will be 60 meters long, dividing the width into two 30-meter sections.

2. **Fence Parallel to the Width (60 meters):**

   If the fence is parallel to the width, it will divide the length into two equal parts. Let \( y \) be the length of each section:
   \[ 60 \times y = 3000 \]
   \[ y = \frac{3000}{60} = 50 \, \text{meters} \]

   Thus, the fence will be 100 meters long, dividing the length into two 50-meter sections.

**Step 5: Conclusion**

The length of the fence depends on its orientation:
- If parallel to the length, the fence is 60 meters long.
- If parallel to the width, the fence is 100 meters long.

Since the problem does not specify which orientation to choose, both answers are valid depending on the farmer's preference.

**Final Answer:**
The length of the fence can be either 60 meters or 100 meters, depending on its orientation.
