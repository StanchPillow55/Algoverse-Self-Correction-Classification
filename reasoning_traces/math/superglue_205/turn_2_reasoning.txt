Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample reasoning question 205," we need to first understand what the problem is asking. However, the problem statement is incomplete as it only provides a placeholder text "Sample reasoning question 205" without any specific details or context. 

To proceed, let's assume that "Sample reasoning question 205" refers to a hypothetical math problem. Since the problem is not specified, I will create a sample math problem and solve it step by step.

**Sample Problem:**
Calculate the sum of the first 205 positive integers.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   We need to find the sum of the first 205 positive integers. The sequence of the first 205 positive integers is 1, 2, 3, ..., 205.

2. **Identify the Formula:**
   The sum of the first \( n \) positive integers can be calculated using the formula:
   \[
   S = \frac{n(n + 1)}{2}
   \]
   where \( S \) is the sum and \( n \) is the number of terms.

3. **Substitute the Values:**
   In this case, \( n = 205 \). Substitute 205 into the formula:
   \[
   S = \frac{205(205 + 1)}{2}
   \]

4. **Calculate the Sum:**
   First, calculate \( 205 + 1 \):
   \[
   205 + 1 = 206
   \]

   Next, multiply 205 by 206:
   \[
   205 \times 206 = 42230
   \]

   Finally, divide the product by 2 to find the sum:
   \[
   S = \frac{42230}{2} = 21115
   \]

5. **Conclusion:**
   The sum of the first 205 positive integers is 21,115.

**Final Answer:**
The sum of the first 205 positive integers is 21,115.
