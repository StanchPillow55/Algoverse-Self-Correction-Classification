==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to understand what "Sample reasoning question 205" entails. Since the problem statement is not fully provided, I'll demonstrate a general approach to solving a typical math problem by breaking it down step by step. Let's assume a hypothetical math problem and solve it.

**Hypothetical Problem:**

"Calculate the value of \( x \) in the equation \( 3x + 5 = 20 \)."

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We are given a linear equation \( 3x + 5 = 20 \).
   - Our goal is to solve for \( x \).

2. **Isolate the Variable:**
   - To find \( x \), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation.
   - Start by eliminating the constant term on the left side of the equation.

3. **Subtract 5 from Both Sides:**
   \[
   3x + 5 - 5 = 20 - 5
   \]
   \[
   3x = 15
   \]
   - By subtracting 5 from both sides, we simplify the equation to \( 3x = 15 \).

4. **Divide by the Coefficient of \( x \):**
   - The coefficient of \( x \) is 3. To solve for \( x \), divide both sides by 3.
   \[
   \frac{3x}{3} = \frac{15}{3}
   \]
   \[
   x = 5
   \]

5. **Verify the Solution:**
   - Substitute \( x = 5 \) back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies the equation.
   \[
   3(5) + 5 = 20
   \]
   \[
   15 + 5 = 20
   \]
   \[
   20 = 20
   \]
   - The left side equals the right side, confirming that \( x = 5 \) is the correct solution.

6. **State the Final Answer:**
   - The value of \( x \) is \( 5 \).

This step-by-step approach demonstrates how to solve a linear equation by isolating the variable and verifying the solution. If you have a specific problem or need further assistance, please provide additional details so I can offer a more tailored solution.
