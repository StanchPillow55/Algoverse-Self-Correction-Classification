Question ID: 4506
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to calculate the total jail time Jean is facing based on the counts of arson, burglary, and petty larceny. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Identify the counts of each charge:**
   - Arson: 3 counts
   - Burglary: 2 counts
   - Petty Larceny: 6 times as many as burglary charges

2. **Calculate the number of petty larceny charges:**
   - Since Jean has 2 burglary charges, the number of petty larceny charges is:
     \[
     \text{Petty Larceny Charges} = 6 \times \text{Burglary Charges} = 6 \times 2 = 12
     \]

3. **Determine the sentence for each type of charge:**
   - Each arson count has a sentence of 36 months.
   - Each burglary charge has a sentence of 18 months.
   - Each petty larceny charge has a sentence that is 1/3 of the burglary charge:
     \[
     \text{Petty Larceny Sentence} = \frac{1}{3} \times \text{Burglary Sentence} = \frac{1}{3} \times 18 \text{ months} = 6 \text{ months}
     \]

4. **Calculate the total sentence for each type of charge:**
   - Total sentence for arson:
     \[
     \text{Total Arson Sentence} = \text{Number of Arson Counts} \times \text{Sentence per Count} = 3 \times 36 = 108 \text{ months}
     \]
   - Total sentence for burglary:
     \[
     \text{Total Burglary Sentence} = \text{Number of Burglary Charges} \times \text{Sentence per Charge} = 2 \times 18 = 36 \text{ months}
     \]
   - Total sentence for petty larceny:
     \[
     \text{Total Petty Larceny Sentence} = \text{Number of Petty Larceny Charges} \times \text{Sentence per Charge} = 12 \times 6 = 72 \text{ months}
     \]

5. **Calculate the total jail time:**
   - Now, we sum the total sentences from all charges:
     \[
     \text{Total Jail Time} = \text{Total Arson Sentence} + \text{Total Burglary Sentence} + \text{Total Petty Larceny Sentence}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total Jail Time} = 108 + 36 + 72 = 216 \text{ months}
     \]

Thus, the total number of months in jail that Jean is facing is **216 months**. 

Final answer: **216 months**.
