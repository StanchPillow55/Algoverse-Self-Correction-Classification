To determine how many months in jail Jean is facing, we need to calculate the total sentence based on the counts of arson, burglary, and petty larceny.

1. **Counts of Charges**:
   - Arson: 3 counts
   - Burglary: 2 counts
   - Petty Larceny: 6 times as many as burglary charges

   First, we calculate the number of petty larceny charges:
   \[
   \text{Petty Larceny Charges} = 6 \times \text{Burglary Charges} = 6 \times 2 = 12
   \]

2. **Sentences for Each Charge**:
   - Each arson count has a sentence of 36 months.
   - Each burglary charge has a sentence of 18 months.
   - Each petty larceny charge has a sentence that is 1/3 of a burglary charge:
     \[
     \text{Petty Larceny Sentence} = \frac{1}{3} \times \text{Burglary Sentence} = \frac{1}{3} \times 18 = 6 \text{ months}
     \]

3. **Calculating Total Sentences**:
   - Total sentence for arson:
   \[
   \text{Total Arson Sentence} = \text{Number of Arson Counts} \times \text{Sentence per Count} = 3 \times 36 = 108 \text{ months}
   \]

   - Total sentence for burglary:
   \[
   \text{Total Burglary Sentence} = \text{Number of Burglary Charges} \times \text{Sentence per Charge} = 2 \times 18 = 36 \text{ months}
   \]

   - Total sentence for petty larceny:
   \[
   \text{Total Petty Larceny Sentence} = \text{Number of Petty Larceny Charges} \times \text{Sentence per Charge} = 12 \times 6 = 72 \text{ months}
   \]

4. **Adding All Sentences Together**:
   Now, we add the total sentences from all charges to find the overall sentence:
   \[
   \text{Total Sentence} = \text{Total Arson Sentence} + \text{Total Burglary Sentence} + \text{Total Petty Larceny Sentence}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total Sentence} = 108 + 36 + 72 = 216 \text{ months}
   \]

Thus, the total time Jean is facing in jail is **216 months**.

Final answer:
\[
\boxed{216}
\]
