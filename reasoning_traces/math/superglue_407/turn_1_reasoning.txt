==================================================

To solve this problem, I need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 407" refers to. Since the question itself isn't provided, I'll need to make some assumptions or create a hypothetical problem to demonstrate the process of solving it. Let's assume "Sample reasoning question 407" is a math problem involving basic arithmetic or algebra. I'll create a sample problem and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**

"Sample reasoning question 407: If 3 times a number plus 7 equals 22, what is the number?"

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We are given an equation: 3 times a number plus 7 equals 22.
   - We need to find the unknown number.

2. **Translate the Problem into an Equation:**
   - Let the unknown number be \( x \).
   - According to the problem, 3 times this number plus 7 equals 22.
   - This can be written as: \( 3x + 7 = 22 \).

3. **Solve the Equation:**
   - To find \( x \), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation.
   - Start by subtracting 7 from both sides of the equation to get rid of the constant term on the left side:
     \[
     3x + 7 - 7 = 22 - 7
     \]
     \[
     3x = 15
     \]
   - Next, divide both sides by 3 to solve for \( x \):
     \[
     \frac{3x}{3} = \frac{15}{3}
     \]
     \[
     x = 5
     \]

4. **Verify the Solution:**
   - Substitute \( x = 5 \) back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies the condition:
     \[
     3(5) + 7 = 15 + 7 = 22
     \]
   - Since both sides of the equation are equal, our solution is verified.

5. **State the Final Answer:**
   - The number is \( 5 \).

Therefore, the solution to the hypothetical "Sample reasoning question 407" is that the number is 5.
