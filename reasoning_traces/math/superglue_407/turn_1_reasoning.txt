Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 407" refers to. Since the problem statement does not provide specific details about the question, I'll assume this is a placeholder for a typical math problem. Let's create a hypothetical math problem and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**

"Find the value of \( x \) if \( 3x + 7 = 22 \)."

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Equation:**
   The equation given is \( 3x + 7 = 22 \). This is a linear equation in one variable, \( x \).

2. **Isolate the Variable:**
   To solve for \( x \), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We can do this by performing operations that will simplify the equation.

3. **Subtract 7 from Both Sides:**
   To eliminate the constant term on the left side, subtract 7 from both sides of the equation:
   \[
   3x + 7 - 7 = 22 - 7
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   3x = 15
   \]

4. **Divide by 3:**
   Now, divide both sides by 3 to solve for \( x \):
   \[
   \frac{3x}{3} = \frac{15}{3}
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   x = 5
   \]

5. **Verify the Solution:**
   Substitute \( x = 5 \) back into the original equation to verify:
   \[
   3(5) + 7 = 22
   \]
   Simplifying the left side:
   \[
   15 + 7 = 22
   \]
   Since both sides of the equation are equal, our solution is verified.

**Final Answer:**

The value of \( x \) is 5.
