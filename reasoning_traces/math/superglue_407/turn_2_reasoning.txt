Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 407" entails. Since the problem statement is not explicitly given, I'll assume it's a placeholder for a typical math problem. Let's create a hypothetical math problem and solve it step-by-step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**

A farmer has a rectangular field that is 60 meters long and 40 meters wide. He wants to build a fence around the field and also divide the field into two equal rectangular sections with a fence parallel to the shorter side. Calculate the total length of the fence required.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We have a rectangular field with dimensions 60 meters (length) and 40 meters (width).
   - We need to fence the perimeter of the field.
   - Additionally, we need to divide the field into two equal sections with a fence parallel to the shorter side (width).

2. **Calculate the Perimeter of the Field:**
   - The formula for the perimeter \( P \) of a rectangle is:
     \[
     P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width})
     \]
   - Substitute the given values:
     \[
     P = 2 \times (60 + 40) = 2 \times 100 = 200 \text{ meters}
     \]

3. **Calculate the Length of the Dividing Fence:**
   - Since the dividing fence is parallel to the width, it will be equal to the length of the field.
   - Therefore, the length of the dividing fence is 60 meters.

4. **Calculate the Total Length of the Fence Required:**
   - Add the perimeter of the field and the length of the dividing fence:
     \[
     \text{Total Length} = 200 + 60 = 260 \text{ meters}
     \]

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The total length of the fence required to enclose the field and divide it into two equal sections is 260 meters.

**Final Answer:**
The total length of the fence required is 260 meters.
