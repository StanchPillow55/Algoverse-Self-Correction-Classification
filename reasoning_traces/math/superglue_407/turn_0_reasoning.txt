==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 407" entails. Since the problem statement is not specific, I'll assume it's a generic math problem that requires logical reasoning and step-by-step calculations. Let's create a hypothetical math problem and solve it.

**Hypothetical Problem:**

A farmer has a rectangular field that is 100 meters long and 60 meters wide. He wants to divide the field into smaller, equal-sized square plots. What is the largest possible side length of each square plot?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We have a rectangular field with dimensions 100 meters by 60 meters.
   - We need to divide this field into square plots of equal size.
   - The goal is to find the largest possible side length for these square plots.

2. **Identify the Mathematical Concept:**
   - The problem involves finding the largest square that can fit into both the length and the width of the rectangle.
   - This is a classic problem of finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the two dimensions.

3. **Calculate the GCD:**
   - The dimensions of the field are 100 meters and 60 meters.
   - We need to find the GCD of 100 and 60.

4. **Use the Euclidean Algorithm:**
   - The Euclidean algorithm is an efficient method for computing the GCD.
   - Start with the larger number (100) and divide it by the smaller number (60).
   - Calculate the remainder: \(100 \div 60 = 1\) remainder \(40\).
   - Replace 100 with 60 and 60 with the remainder 40, then repeat the process.
   - \(60 \div 40 = 1\) remainder \(20\).
   - Replace 60 with 40 and 40 with the remainder 20, then repeat the process.
   - \(40 \div 20 = 2\) remainder \(0\).
   - When the remainder is 0, the divisor at this step (20) is the GCD.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The greatest common divisor of 100 and 60 is 20.
   - Therefore, the largest possible side length of each square plot is 20 meters.

**Final Answer:**
The largest possible side length of each square plot is 20 meters.
