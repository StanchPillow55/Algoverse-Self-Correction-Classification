==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to calculate the total cost to repave both Monica's street and Lewis' street, and then find the difference in cost between the two.

### Step 1: Calculate the cost to repave Monica's street.

Monica's street is 150 meters long, and the cost to repave is $194 per meter.

\[
\text{Cost for Monica's street} = \text{Length of Monica's street} \times \text{Cost per meter}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\text{Cost for Monica's street} = 150 \, \text{meters} \times 194 \, \text{dollars/meter}
\]

Calculating this:

\[
150 \times 194 = 29100
\]

So, the cost to repave Monica's street is **$29,100**.

### Step 2: Calculate the cost to repave Lewis' street.

Lewis' street is 490 meters long, and the cost to repave is still $194 per meter.

\[
\text{Cost for Lewis' street} = \text{Length of Lewis' street} \times \text{Cost per meter}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\text{Cost for Lewis' street} = 490 \, \text{meters} \times 194 \, \text{dollars/meter}
\]

Calculating this:

\[
490 \times 194 = 95060
\]

So, the cost to repave Lewis' street is **$95,060**.

### Step 3: Calculate the difference in cost between Lewis' street and Monica's street.

Now, we need to find out how much more it costs to repave Lewis' street compared to Monica's street.

\[
\text{Difference in cost} = \text{Cost for Lewis' street} - \text{Cost for Monica's street}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\text{Difference in cost} = 95060 - 29100
\]

Calculating this:

\[
95060 - 29100 = 65960
\]

### Final Answer

The difference in cost to repave Lewis' street compared to Monica's street is **$65,960**.
