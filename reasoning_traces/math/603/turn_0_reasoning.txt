==================================================

To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step.

### Step 1: Calculate Ruiz's chocolate production per hour.

Ruiz can make 120 pounds of chocolates in 2 hours. To find out how much he makes in 1 hour, we divide the total pounds by the number of hours:

\[
\text{Ruiz's production per hour} = \frac{120 \text{ pounds}}{2 \text{ hours}} = 60 \text{ pounds/hour}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate Marissa's chocolate production per hour.

Marissa makes \( \frac{3}{4} \) times as many pounds of chocolates in an hour as Ruiz makes in the two hours. Since we already calculated that Ruiz makes 120 pounds in 2 hours, we can find Marissa's production as follows:

\[
\text{Marissa's production per hour} = \frac{3}{4} \times 120 \text{ pounds} = 90 \text{ pounds/hour}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the total production for both Ruiz and Marissa in one hour.

Now we can find the total amount of chocolate they make together in one hour by adding their individual productions:

\[
\text{Total production per hour} = \text{Ruiz's production per hour} + \text{Marissa's production per hour}
\]
\[
\text{Total production per hour} = 60 \text{ pounds/hour} + 90 \text{ pounds/hour} = 150 \text{ pounds/hour}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the total production for 12 hours.

Now, we need to calculate how much chocolate they make together in 12 hours. We multiply their combined hourly production by the number of hours they worked:

\[
\text{Total production in 12 hours} = \text{Total production per hour} \times 12 \text{ hours}
\]
\[
\text{Total production in 12 hours} = 150 \text{ pounds/hour} \times 12 \text{ hours} = 1800 \text{ pounds}
\]

### Final Answer

The total amount of chocolate pounds they made together in 12 hours is:

\[
\boxed{1800} \text{ pounds}
\]
