To solve this problem, we need to determine Jonah's total cost, his total revenue, and then calculate his profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue.

**Step 1: Calculate Jonah's Total Cost**

Jonah bought 6 pineapples, and each pineapple cost $3. Therefore, the total cost of the pineapples is calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Total Cost} = \text{Number of Pineapples} \times \text{Cost per Pineapple} = 6 \times 3 = 18
\]

So, Jonah's total cost is $18.

**Step 2: Determine the Total Number of Pineapple Rings**

Each pineapple can be cut into 12 rings. Therefore, the total number of pineapple rings from 6 pineapples is:

\[
\text{Total Rings} = \text{Number of Pineapples} \times \text{Rings per Pineapple} = 6 \times 12 = 72
\]

So, Jonah has a total of 72 pineapple rings.

**Step 3: Calculate Jonah's Total Revenue**

Jonah sells 4 pineapple rings for $5. First, we need to determine how many sets of 4 rings he can sell from the total 72 rings:

\[
\text{Number of Sets} = \frac{\text{Total Rings}}{\text{Rings per Set}} = \frac{72}{4} = 18
\]

Jonah can sell 18 sets of 4 rings. Each set sells for $5, so the total revenue is:

\[
\text{Total Revenue} = \text{Number of Sets} \times \text{Revenue per Set} = 18 \times 5 = 90
\]

So, Jonah's total revenue is $90.

**Step 4: Calculate Jonah's Profit**

Profit is calculated by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue:

\[
\text{Profit} = \text{Total Revenue} - \text{Total Cost} = 90 - 18 = 72
\]

Therefore, Jonah's profit is $72.

**Final Answer:**

Jonah made a profit of $72.
