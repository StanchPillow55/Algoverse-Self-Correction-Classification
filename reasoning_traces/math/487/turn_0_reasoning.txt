To determine how many bags of oats Uncle Ben needs to feed his horses for five days, we can break the problem down into several steps.

### Step 1: Calculate the daily oat consumption for one horse.
Each horse consumes 5 pounds of oats per meal. Since Uncle Ben feeds his horses twice a day, we can calculate the daily consumption for one horse as follows:

\[
\text{Daily consumption per horse} = \text{Oats per meal} \times \text{Number of meals per day}
\]
\[
\text{Daily consumption per horse} = 5 \text{ pounds} \times 2 = 10 \text{ pounds}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the daily oat consumption for all four horses.
Now that we know how much one horse eats in a day, we can find out how much all four horses eat in a day:

\[
\text{Daily consumption for 4 horses} = \text{Daily consumption per horse} \times \text{Number of horses}
\]
\[
\text{Daily consumption for 4 horses} = 10 \text{ pounds} \times 4 = 40 \text{ pounds}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the total oat consumption for five days.
Next, we need to find out how much oats are consumed over five days:

\[
\text{Total consumption for 5 days} = \text{Daily consumption for 4 horses} \times \text{Number of days}
\]
\[
\text{Total consumption for 5 days} = 40 \text{ pounds} \times 5 = 200 \text{ pounds}
\]

### Step 4: Determine how many bags of oats are needed.
Each bag of oats contains 50 pounds. To find out how many bags are needed for 200 pounds of oats, we divide the total amount of oats by the amount in one bag:

\[
\text{Number of bags needed} = \frac{\text{Total consumption for 5 days}}{\text{Pounds per bag}}
\]
\[
\text{Number of bags needed} = \frac{200 \text{ pounds}}{50 \text{ pounds per bag}} = 4
\]

### Final Answer
Uncle Ben needs **4 bags of oats** to feed his horses for five days.
