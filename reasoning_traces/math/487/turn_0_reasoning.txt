To determine how much profit Jonah made, we need to calculate his total costs and total revenue from selling the pineapple rings, and then find the difference between the two.

### Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the pineapples.

Jonah bought 6 pineapples at a price of $3 each. 

\[
\text{Total Cost} = \text{Number of Pineapples} \times \text{Cost per Pineapple}
\]
\[
\text{Total Cost} = 6 \times 3 = 18 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the total number of pineapple rings.

Each pineapple can be cut into 12 pineapple rings. Therefore, the total number of pineapple rings from 6 pineapples is:

\[
\text{Total Rings} = \text{Number of Pineapples} \times \text{Rings per Pineapple}
\]
\[
\text{Total Rings} = 6 \times 12 = 72 \text{ rings}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the total revenue from selling the pineapple rings.

Jonah sold 4 pineapple rings for $5 each. First, we need to find out how many sets of 4 rings he can sell from the total of 72 rings.

\[
\text{Number of Sets of 4 Rings} = \frac{\text{Total Rings}}{4} = \frac{72}{4} = 18 \text{ sets}
\]

Now, we can calculate the total revenue from selling these sets:

\[
\text{Total Revenue} = \text{Number of Sets} \times \text{Price per Set}
\]
\[
\text{Total Revenue} = 18 \times 5 = 90 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the profit.

Profit is calculated by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue:

\[
\text{Profit} = \text{Total Revenue} - \text{Total Cost}
\]
\[
\text{Profit} = 90 - 18 = 72 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Final Answer

Jonah made a profit of **$72**.
