==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample math problem 264" refers to. Since the problem is not explicitly stated, I will assume it involves a typical math problem that could be labeled as such. Let's consider a common type of math problem, such as solving an equation or finding a value. 

For this example, let's assume "Sample math problem 264" involves solving a quadratic equation. Here's a step-by-step solution for a generic quadratic equation:

### Problem:
Solve the quadratic equation: \( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \).

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Identify the coefficients**: 
   - \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \) are the coefficients of the quadratic equation. For this example, let's assume \( a = 1 \), \( b = -3 \), and \( c = 2 \). Thus, the equation becomes:
     \[
     x^2 - 3x + 2 = 0
     \]

2. **Check if the equation can be factored**:
   - We look for two numbers that multiply to \( ac = 1 \times 2 = 2 \) and add to \( b = -3 \).
   - The numbers \(-1\) and \(-2\) satisfy these conditions because:
     \[
     (-1) \times (-2) = 2 \quad \text{and} \quad (-1) + (-2) = -3
     \]

3. **Factor the quadratic equation**:
   - Using the numbers found, we can factor the equation as:
     \[
     (x - 1)(x - 2) = 0
     \]

4. **Solve for \( x \)**:
   - Set each factor equal to zero and solve for \( x \):
     \[
     x - 1 = 0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad x = 1
     \]
     \[
     x - 2 = 0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad x = 2
     \]

5. **Verify the solutions**:
   - Substitute \( x = 1 \) and \( x = 2 \) back into the original equation to ensure they satisfy it:
     - For \( x = 1 \):
       \[
       1^2 - 3 \times 1 + 2 = 1 - 3 + 2 = 0
       \]
     - For \( x = 2 \):
       \[
       2^2 - 3 \times 2 + 2 = 4 - 6 + 2 = 0
       \]

Both solutions satisfy the original equation.

### Final Answer:
The solutions to the quadratic equation \( x^2 - 3x + 2 = 0 \) are \( x = 1 \) and \( x = 2 \).
