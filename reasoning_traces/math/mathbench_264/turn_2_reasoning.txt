==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 264," we need to first understand what the problem is asking. However, the problem statement "Sample math problem 264" is not specific enough for us to identify the exact mathematical question or context. Therefore, I will assume that "264" is a number that we need to analyze or solve a problem related to it. Let's explore some potential mathematical problems involving the number 264 and solve them step by step.

### Problem 1: Prime Factorization of 264

**Step 1: Identify the smallest prime number that divides 264.**

The smallest prime number is 2. Check if 264 is divisible by 2:
\[ 264 \div 2 = 132 \]
Since 264 is divisible by 2, we write:
\[ 264 = 2 \times 132 \]

**Step 2: Continue factoring 132.**

Check if 132 is divisible by 2:
\[ 132 \div 2 = 66 \]
So, we have:
\[ 132 = 2 \times 66 \]
Thus, the factorization so far is:
\[ 264 = 2 \times 2 \times 66 \]

**Step 3: Continue factoring 66.**

Check if 66 is divisible by 2:
\[ 66 \div 2 = 33 \]
So, we have:
\[ 66 = 2 \times 33 \]
Thus, the factorization so far is:
\[ 264 = 2 \times 2 \times 2 \times 33 \]

**Step 4: Factor 33.**

The number 33 is not divisible by 2. Check the next smallest prime number, which is 3:
\[ 33 \div 3 = 11 \]
So, we have:
\[ 33 = 3 \times 11 \]
Thus, the complete prime factorization of 264 is:
\[ 264 = 2^3 \times 3 \times 11 \]

### Problem 2: Determine if 264 is a Perfect Square

A perfect square is a number that can be expressed as the square of an integer. To determine if 264 is a perfect square, we need to check if all the exponents in its prime factorization are even.

From the prime factorization:
\[ 264 = 2^3 \times 3^1 \times 11^1 \]

The exponents are 3, 1, and 1, which are not all even. Therefore, 264 is not a perfect square.

### Problem 3: Calculate the Sum of the Digits of 264

**Step 1: Identify the digits of 264.**

The digits of 264 are 2, 6, and 4.

**Step 2: Calculate the sum of the digits.**

Add the digits together:
\[ 2 + 6 + 4 = 12 \]

### Final Answer

Based on the problems we explored:

1. The prime factorization of 264 is \(2^3 \times 3 \times 11\).
2. 264 is not a perfect square.
3. The sum of the digits of 264 is 12.

If you have a specific problem related to the number 264, please provide more details, and I can solve that specific problem for you.
