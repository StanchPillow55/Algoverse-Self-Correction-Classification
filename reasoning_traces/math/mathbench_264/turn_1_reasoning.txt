==================================================

To solve the problem, we first need to understand what "Sample math problem 264" refers to. Since the problem itself is not provided, I'll assume it involves a typical math problem-solving process. Let's consider a hypothetical math problem and solve it step-by-step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**

"Find the value of \( x \) in the equation \( 3x + 5 = 20 \)."

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Equation:**
   The equation given is \( 3x + 5 = 20 \). This is a linear equation in one variable, \( x \).

2. **Isolate the Variable:**
   To find the value of \( x \), we need to isolate \( x \) on one side of the equation.

3. **Subtract 5 from Both Sides:**
   \[
   3x + 5 - 5 = 20 - 5
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   3x = 15
   \]

4. **Divide Both Sides by 3:**
   \[
   \frac{3x}{3} = \frac{15}{3}
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   x = 5
   \]

5. **Verify the Solution:**
   Substitute \( x = 5 \) back into the original equation to verify:
   \[
   3(5) + 5 = 20
   \]
   Simplifying the left side:
   \[
   15 + 5 = 20
   \]
   \[
   20 = 20
   \]
   The left side equals the right side, confirming that our solution is correct.

**Final Answer:**

The value of \( x \) is \( 5 \).

This is a simple example of solving a linear equation. If "Sample math problem 264" refers to a different problem, please provide the specific details or context, and I can solve that problem accordingly.
