To calculate the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month, we need to consider both the fixed costs and the variable costs associated with renting the studio and teaching the students.

### Step 1: Calculate the weekly earnings

1. **Fixed Cost**: The cost to rent the studio per session is $25.
2. **Variable Cost**: The cost per student per session is $1.50. With 10 students, the total variable cost per session is:
   \[
   \text{Variable Cost per Session} = \text{Number of Students} \times \text{Cost per Student}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Variable Cost per Session} = 10 \times 1.50 = 15
   \]

3. **Total Cost per Session**: The total cost per session is the sum of the fixed cost and the variable cost:
   \[
   \text{Total Cost per Session} = \text{Fixed Cost} + \text{Variable Cost}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total Cost per Session} = 25 + 15 = 40
   \]

4. **Number of Sessions per Week**: The studio is rented 3 days a week.

5. **Total Weekly Earnings**: The total earnings for the studio per week can be calculated by multiplying the total cost per session by the number of sessions per week:
   \[
   \text{Total Weekly Earnings} = \text{Total Cost per Session} \times \text{Number of Sessions per Week}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total Weekly Earnings} = 40 \times 3 = 120
   \]

### Step 2: Calculate the monthly earnings

1. **Number of Weeks in a Month**: Typically, we consider a month to have about 4 weeks.

2. **Total Monthly Earnings**: To find the total earnings for the month, we multiply the total weekly earnings by the number of weeks in a month:
   \[
   \text{Total Monthly Earnings} = \text{Total Weekly Earnings} \times \text{Number of Weeks in a Month}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total Monthly Earnings} = 120 \times 4 = 480
   \]

### Final Answer

The expected earnings of the dance studio in a month are **$480**.
