==================================================

To solve the problem, we will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of boxes of oranges Mrs. Harrington bought.**
   - She bought 12 boxes.

2. **Calculate the total number of oranges in those boxes.**
   - Each box contains 20 oranges.
   - Total oranges = Number of boxes × Oranges per box
   \[
   \text{Total oranges} = 12 \text{ boxes} \times 20 \text{ oranges/box} = 240 \text{ oranges}
   \]

3. **Determine how many boxes of oranges she gave away.**
   - She gave 2 boxes to her mom and 2 boxes to her sister.
   - Total boxes given away = 2 + 2 = 4 boxes.

4. **Calculate the number of oranges given away.**
   - Total oranges given away = Number of boxes given away × Oranges per box
   \[
   \text{Total oranges given away} = 4 \text{ boxes} \times 20 \text{ oranges/box} = 80 \text{ oranges}
   \]

5. **Calculate the number of oranges Mrs. Harrington has left after giving some away.**
   - Oranges left = Total oranges - Oranges given away
   \[
   \text{Oranges left} = 240 \text{ oranges} - 80 \text{ oranges} = 160 \text{ oranges}
   \]

6. **Determine how many oranges she kept.**
   - She kept \( \frac{1}{4} \) of the remaining oranges.
   \[
   \text{Oranges kept} = \frac{1}{4} \times 160 \text{ oranges} = 40 \text{ oranges}
   \]

7. **Calculate how many oranges she sold.**
   - Oranges sold = Oranges left - Oranges kept
   \[
   \text{Oranges sold} = 160 \text{ oranges} - 40 \text{ oranges} = 120 \text{ oranges}
   \]

Finally, the number of oranges Mrs. Harrington sold is:
\[
\boxed{120}
\]
