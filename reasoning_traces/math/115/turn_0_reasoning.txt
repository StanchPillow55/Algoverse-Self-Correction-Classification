To solve the problem, we need to find the total number of jelly beans in the jar based on the information given about the distribution of flavors.

1. **Understanding the proportions**: 
   - We know that three-fourths (3/4) of the jelly beans are red.
   - We also know that one-quarter (1/4) of the red jelly beans are coconut flavored.

2. **Let \( x \) be the total number of jelly beans in the jar**. 

3. **Calculate the number of red jelly beans**:
   - Since three-fourths of the jelly beans are red, the number of red jelly beans can be expressed as:
     \[
     \text{Number of red jelly beans} = \frac{3}{4}x
     \]

4. **Calculate the number of coconut flavored jelly beans**:
   - We know that one-quarter of the red jelly beans are coconut flavored. Therefore, the number of coconut flavored jelly beans can be expressed as:
     \[
     \text{Number of coconut flavored jelly beans} = \frac{1}{4} \times \left(\frac{3}{4}x\right) = \frac{3}{16}x
     \]

5. **Set up the equation**:
   - According to the problem, the number of coconut flavored jelly beans is given as 750. Thus, we can set up the equation:
     \[
     \frac{3}{16}x = 750
     \]

6. **Solve for \( x \)**:
   - To isolate \( x \), we can multiply both sides of the equation by the reciprocal of \(\frac{3}{16}\), which is \(\frac{16}{3}\):
     \[
     x = 750 \times \frac{16}{3}
     \]

   - Now, calculate \( 750 \times \frac{16}{3} \):
     \[
     x = 750 \times \frac{16}{3} = \frac{750 \times 16}{3} = \frac{12000}{3} = 4000
     \]

7. **Final answer**:
   - Therefore, the total number of jelly beans in the jar is:
     \[
     \boxed{4000}
     \]
