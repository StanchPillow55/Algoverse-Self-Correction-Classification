To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of jelly beans in the jar given the information about the red and coconut-flavored jelly beans.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We are told that three fourths of the jelly beans are red.
   - One quarter of the red jelly beans are coconut flavored.
   - There are 750 coconut-flavored jelly beans.

2. **Setting Up Equations:**
   - Let \( x \) be the total number of jelly beans in the jar.
   - Since three fourths of the jelly beans are red, the number of red jelly beans is \( \frac{3}{4}x \).
   - One quarter of these red jelly beans are coconut flavored, so the number of coconut-flavored jelly beans is \( \frac{1}{4} \times \frac{3}{4}x = \frac{3}{16}x \).

3. **Using the Given Information:**
   - We know that the number of coconut-flavored jelly beans is 750.
   - Therefore, we can set up the equation:
     \[
     \frac{3}{16}x = 750
     \]

4. **Solving the Equation:**
   - To solve for \( x \), multiply both sides of the equation by 16 to eliminate the fraction:
     \[
     3x = 750 \times 16
     \]
   - Calculate \( 750 \times 16 \):
     \[
     750 \times 16 = 12000
     \]
   - Now, divide both sides by 3 to solve for \( x \):
     \[
     x = \frac{12000}{3} = 4000
     \]

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The total number of jelly beans in the jar is 4000.

Therefore, the final answer is that there are 4000 jelly beans in the jar.
