==================================================

To find out how much money Monika spent throughout her day, we will break down her expenses step by step.

1. **Mall Spending**: 
   Monika spent $250 at the mall. 
   \[
   \text{Mall Spending} = 250
   \]

2. **Movie Spending**: 
   Monika watched 3 movies, and each movie cost $24. To find the total cost for the movies, we multiply the number of movies by the cost per movie:
   \[
   \text{Movie Cost} = 3 \times 24 = 72
   \]

3. **Farmer's Market Spending**: 
   At the farmer's market, Monika bought 20 bags of beans, with each bag costing $1.25. To find the total cost for the beans, we multiply the number of bags by the cost per bag:
   \[
   \text{Beans Cost} = 20 \times 1.25 = 25
   \]

4. **Total Spending**: 
   Now we will add all of Monika's expenses together to find the total amount she spent throughout the day:
   \[
   \text{Total Spending} = \text{Mall Spending} + \text{Movie Cost} + \text{Beans Cost}
   \]
   Substituting the values we calculated:
   \[
   \text{Total Spending} = 250 + 72 + 25
   \]

   Now, we perform the addition step by step:
   \[
   250 + 72 = 322
   \]
   \[
   322 + 25 = 347
   \]

Thus, the total amount Monika spent throughout her day is:
\[
\boxed{347}
\]
