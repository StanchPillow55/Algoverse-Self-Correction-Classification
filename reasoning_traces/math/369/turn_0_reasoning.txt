To find the total amount spent on the senior gifts, we will break down the costs into different components: the cost of the picture frames, the cost of etching the frames, the cost of the pins, and the cost of the cords for the officers.

### Step 1: Calculate the cost of the picture frames

Each senior receives a picture frame that costs $20. Since there are 44 seniors, the total cost for the picture frames is calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Total cost of picture frames} = \text{Number of seniors} \times \text{Cost per frame}
\]
\[
\text{Total cost of picture frames} = 44 \times 20 = 880
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the cost of etching the frames

Each picture frame needs to be etched with the logo, which adds an additional 20% cost per frame. First, we calculate the etching cost per frame:

\[
\text{Etching cost per frame} = 20\% \text{ of } 20 = 0.20 \times 20 = 4
\]

Now, we calculate the total etching cost for all frames:

\[
\text{Total etching cost} = \text{Number of seniors} \times \text{Etching cost per frame}
\]
\[
\text{Total etching cost} = 44 \times 4 = 176
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the cost of the pins

Two seniors will receive pins that cost $5 each. Therefore, the total cost for the pins is:

\[
\text{Total cost of pins} = \text{Number of pins} \times \text{Cost per pin}
\]
\[
\text{Total cost of pins} = 2 \times 5 = 10
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the cost of the cords for the officers

1/4 of the seniors are officers. To find the number of officers:

\[
\text{Number of officers} = \frac{1}{4} \times 44 = 11
\]

Each officer receives a cord that costs $12. Therefore, the total cost for the cords is:

\[
\text{Total cost of cords} = \text{Number of officers} \times \text{Cost per cord}
\]
\[
\text{Total cost of cords} = 11 \times 12 = 132
\]

### Step 5: Calculate the total cost for all gifts

Now we will sum all the costs calculated:

\[
\text{Total cost} = \text{Total cost of picture frames} + \text{Total etching cost} + \text{Total cost of pins} + \text{Total cost of cords}
\]
\[
\text{Total cost} = 880 + 176 + 10 + 132
\]
\[
\text{Total cost} = 1198
\]

### Final Answer

The total amount spent on the senior gifts is **$1198**.
