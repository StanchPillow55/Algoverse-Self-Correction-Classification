==================================================

To determine how much money Monika spent throughout her day, we need to calculate the total amount spent at each location and then sum these amounts.

1. **Spending at the Mall:**
   - Monika spent $250 at the mall.

2. **Spending at the Movies:**
   - Monika watched 3 movies, and each movie cost $24.
   - To find the total cost for the movies, we multiply the cost per movie by the number of movies:
     \[
     \text{Total cost for movies} = 3 \times 24 = 72
     \]
   - Therefore, Monika spent $72 at the movies.

3. **Spending at the Farmer's Market:**
   - Monika bought 20 bags of beans, and each bag costs $1.25.
   - To find the total cost for the beans, we multiply the cost per bag by the number of bags:
     \[
     \text{Total cost for beans} = 20 \times 1.25 = 25
     \]
   - Therefore, Monika spent $25 at the farmer's market.

4. **Total Spending:**
   - To find the total amount of money Monika spent throughout the day, we add up the amounts spent at each location:
     \[
     \text{Total spending} = 250 + 72 + 25
     \]
   - Calculating the sum:
     \[
     250 + 72 = 322
     \]
     \[
     322 + 25 = 347
     \]

Therefore, Monika spent a total of $347 throughout her day.

**Final Answer:**
Monika spent $347 throughout her day.
