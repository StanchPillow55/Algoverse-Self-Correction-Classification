==================================================

To solve the problem, I need more information about "Sample math problem 74." Since the problem is not provided, I'll demonstrate how to solve a general math problem step by step. If you have a specific problem in mind, please provide the details, and I'll be happy to help.

Let's consider a sample math problem:

**Problem:** Solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).

**Step 1: Understand the problem.**

We need to find the value of \( x \) that makes the equation true.

**Step 2: Isolate the variable.**

The equation is \( 2x + 3 = 11 \). Our goal is to solve for \( x \).

First, we need to isolate the term with \( x \) on one side of the equation. We can do this by subtracting 3 from both sides:

\[
2x + 3 - 3 = 11 - 3
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
2x = 8
\]

**Step 3: Solve for the variable.**

Now, we have \( 2x = 8 \). To solve for \( x \), we need to divide both sides by 2:

\[
\frac{2x}{2} = \frac{8}{2}
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
x = 4
\]

**Step 4: Verify the solution.**

To ensure our solution is correct, we substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation:

\[
2(4) + 3 = 11
\]

Calculate the left side:

\[
8 + 3 = 11
\]

Since both sides of the equation are equal, our solution \( x = 4 \) is correct.

**Final Answer:**

The solution to the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \) is \( x = 4 \).
