==================================================

To solve the problem, I need more information about "Sample math problem 491." Since the problem statement is not provided, I will demonstrate how to solve a generic math problem step by step. If you have a specific problem in mind, please provide the details.

Let's consider a sample math problem:

**Problem:** Solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).

**Step 1: Isolate the variable term.**

The goal is to solve for \( x \), which means we need to isolate \( x \) on one side of the equation. The given equation is:

\[ 2x + 3 = 11 \]

To isolate the term with \( x \), subtract 3 from both sides of the equation:

\[ 2x + 3 - 3 = 11 - 3 \]

This simplifies to:

\[ 2x = 8 \]

**Step 2: Solve for the variable.**

Now, we need to solve for \( x \) by getting rid of the coefficient of \( x \). The coefficient of \( x \) is 2. To eliminate it, divide both sides of the equation by 2:

\[ \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{8}{2} \]

This simplifies to:

\[ x = 4 \]

**Step 3: Verify the solution.**

To ensure that our solution is correct, substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation and check if both sides are equal:

Original equation: \( 2x + 3 = 11 \)

Substitute \( x = 4 \):

\[ 2(4) + 3 = 11 \]

Calculate the left side:

\[ 8 + 3 = 11 \]

Since both sides of the equation are equal, our solution is verified.

**Final Answer:**

The solution to the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \) is \( x = 4 \).
