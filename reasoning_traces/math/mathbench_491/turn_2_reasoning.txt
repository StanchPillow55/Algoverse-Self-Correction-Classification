Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem effectively, I need to first understand what "Sample math problem 491" entails. Since the problem is not explicitly stated, I'll create a hypothetical math problem labeled as "491" and solve it step by step. Let's assume the problem involves solving a quadratic equation, which is a common type of math problem.

**Problem 491:**
Solve the quadratic equation \(2x^2 - 4x - 6 = 0\).

**Step 1: Identify the coefficients.**
The standard form of a quadratic equation is \(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\). For this equation:
- \(a = 2\)
- \(b = -4\)
- \(c = -6\)

**Step 2: Calculate the discriminant.**
The discriminant (\(\Delta\)) of a quadratic equation is given by the formula \(\Delta = b^2 - 4ac\).
\[
\Delta = (-4)^2 - 4 \times 2 \times (-6) = 16 + 48 = 64
\]

**Step 3: Determine the nature of the roots.**
Since the discriminant is positive (\(\Delta = 64\)), the quadratic equation has two distinct real roots.

**Step 4: Use the quadratic formula to find the roots.**
The quadratic formula is given by:
\[
x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{\Delta}}{2a}
\]
Substitute the values of \(a\), \(b\), and \(\Delta\) into the formula:
\[
x = \frac{-(-4) \pm \sqrt{64}}{2 \times 2} = \frac{4 \pm 8}{4}
\]

**Step 5: Calculate the two possible values for \(x\).**
- For the positive square root:
  \[
  x_1 = \frac{4 + 8}{4} = \frac{12}{4} = 3
  \]
- For the negative square root:
  \[
  x_2 = \frac{4 - 8}{4} = \frac{-4}{4} = -1
  \]

**Final Answer:**
The solutions to the quadratic equation \(2x^2 - 4x - 6 = 0\) are \(x = 3\) and \(x = -1\).
