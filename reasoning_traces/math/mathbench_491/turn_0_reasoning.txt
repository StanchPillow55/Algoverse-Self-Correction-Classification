==================================================

To solve the problem, we first need to understand what "Sample math problem 491" refers to. Since the problem itself is not provided, I'll create a sample math problem and solve it step by step.

**Sample Math Problem:**

A company produces two types of widgets: A and B. The profit from each widget A is $30, and the profit from each widget B is $50. The company can produce a maximum of 200 widgets in total per day due to labor constraints. Additionally, the company can use up to 150 units of material per day. Each widget A requires 1 unit of material, and each widget B requires 2 units of material. How many of each type of widget should the company produce to maximize profit?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( x \) be the number of widget A produced.
   - Let \( y \) be the number of widget B produced.

2. **Objective Function:**
   - We want to maximize the profit function \( P \).
   - Profit from widget A is $30 per unit, and from widget B is $50 per unit.
   - Therefore, the profit function is: 
     \[
     P = 30x + 50y
     \]

3. **Constraints:**
   - The total number of widgets produced cannot exceed 200:
     \[
     x + y \leq 200
     \]
   - The total material used cannot exceed 150 units:
     \[
     x + 2y \leq 150
     \]
   - Non-negativity constraints:
     \[
     x \geq 0, \quad y \geq 0
     \]

4. **Graphical Solution:**
   - Plot the constraints on a graph with \( x \) on the horizontal axis and \( y \) on the vertical axis.
   - The line \( x + y = 200 \) intersects the axes at (200, 0) and (0, 200).
   - The line \( x + 2y = 150 \) intersects the axes at (150, 0) and (0, 75).

5. **Feasible Region:**
   - The feasible region is bounded by the lines \( x + y = 200 \), \( x + 2y = 150 \), and the axes.
   - The vertices of the feasible region are found by solving the system of equations:
     - Intersection of \( x + y = 200 \) and \( x + 2y = 150 \):
       \[
       \begin{align*}
       x + y &= 200 \\
       x + 2y &= 150
       \end{align*}
       \]
       Subtract the first equation from the second:
       \[
       (x + 2y) - (x + y) = 150 - 200 \\
       y = -50
       \]
       Since \( y \) cannot be negative, this intersection is not feasible.

     - Intersection of \( x + y = 200 \) and the y-axis:
       \[
       x = 0, \quad y = 200
       \]
       This point is not feasible as it exceeds the material constraint.

     - Intersection of \( x + 2y = 150 \) and the x-axis:
       \[
       y = 0, \quad x = 150
       \]

     - Intersection of \( x + 2y = 150 \) and \( x + y = 200 \) (already checked).

     - Intersection of \( x = 0 \) and \( x + 2y = 150 \):
       \[
       x = 0, \quad y = 75
       \]

6. **Evaluate the Objective Function at Each Vertex:**
   - \( (150, 0) \): \( P = 30(150) + 50(0) = 4500 \)
   - \( (0, 75) \): \( P = 30(0) + 50(75) = 3750 \)

7. **Conclusion:**
   - The maximum profit is $4500, achieved by producing 150 units of widget A and 0 units of widget B.

**Final Answer:**
The company should produce 150 units of widget A and 0 units of widget B to maximize profit, resulting in a maximum profit of $4500.
