==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 150" refers to. Since the problem statement is not clear or specific, I will assume it is a placeholder for a typical math problem. Let's create a sample math problem and solve it step by step.

**Sample Problem:**
A store sells apples at $2 each and oranges at $3 each. If a customer buys a total of 10 fruits and spends $24, how many apples and how many oranges did the customer buy?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( x \) be the number of apples.
   - Let \( y \) be the number of oranges.

2. **Set Up Equations:**
   - Since the total number of fruits is 10, we have the equation:
     \[
     x + y = 10
     \]
   - Since the total cost is $24, we have the equation:
     \[
     2x + 3y = 24
     \]

3. **Solve the System of Equations:**

   We have the system:
   \[
   \begin{align*}
   x + y &= 10 \quad \text{(Equation 1)} \\
   2x + 3y &= 24 \quad \text{(Equation 2)}
   \end{align*}
   \]

   - Solve Equation 1 for \( x \):
     \[
     x = 10 - y
     \]

   - Substitute \( x = 10 - y \) into Equation 2:
     \[
     2(10 - y) + 3y = 24
     \]

   - Simplify and solve for \( y \):
     \[
     20 - 2y + 3y = 24
     \]
     \[
     20 + y = 24
     \]
     \[
     y = 24 - 20
     \]
     \[
     y = 4
     \]

   - Substitute \( y = 4 \) back into Equation 1 to find \( x \):
     \[
     x + 4 = 10
     \]
     \[
     x = 10 - 4
     \]
     \[
     x = 6
     \]

4. **Verify the Solution:**
   - Check the total number of fruits:
     \[
     x + y = 6 + 4 = 10 \quad \text{(Correct)}
     \]
   - Check the total cost:
     \[
     2x + 3y = 2(6) + 3(4) = 12 + 12 = 24 \quad \text{(Correct)}
     \]

**Final Answer:**
The customer bought 6 apples and 4 oranges.
