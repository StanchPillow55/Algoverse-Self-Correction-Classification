==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to determine the cost of one carrot that Ellen eats every day, given the total cost of her daily food items.

1. **Identify the costs of the items:**
   - Cost of the salad = $6
   - Cost of the yogurt = half the price of the salad

   Therefore, the cost of the yogurt is:
   \[
   \text{Cost of yogurt} = \frac{1}{2} \times 6 = 3 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Calculate the total cost of the salad and yogurt:**
   - Total cost of salad and yogurt:
   \[
   \text{Total cost of salad and yogurt} = \text{Cost of salad} + \text{Cost of yogurt} = 6 + 3 = 9 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Determine the total cost of the carrots:**
   - Ellen pays a total of $11 for her daily food items. Therefore, the total cost of the two carrots can be calculated as follows:
   \[
   \text{Total cost of two carrots} = \text{Total cost} - \text{Total cost of salad and yogurt} = 11 - 9 = 2 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Calculate the cost of one carrot:**
   - Since Ellen eats two carrots, the cost of one carrot can be calculated by dividing the total cost of the two carrots by 2:
   \[
   \text{Cost of one carrot} = \frac{\text{Total cost of two carrots}}{2} = \frac{2}{2} = 1 \text{ dollar}
   \]

5. **Final answer:**
   - Therefore, the cost of one carrot that Ellen eats every day is:
   \[
   \boxed{1} \text{ dollar}
   \]
