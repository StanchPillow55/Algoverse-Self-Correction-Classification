==================================================

To solve "Sample math problem 204," I need more specific information about the problem itself. However, I can demonstrate how to approach solving a generic math problem by outlining a step-by-step process. If you have a specific problem in mind, please provide the details, and I'll be happy to help solve it.

Let's assume a hypothetical math problem for demonstration purposes:

**Problem:**
Solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 3x + 5 = 20 \).

**Step-by-step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We are given a linear equation \( 3x + 5 = 20 \).
   - Our goal is to solve for the variable \( x \).

2. **Isolate the Variable:**
   - To solve for \( x \), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation.
   - Start by eliminating the constant term on the left side of the equation.

3. **Subtract 5 from Both Sides:**
   \[
   3x + 5 - 5 = 20 - 5
   \]
   - Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   3x = 15
   \]

4. **Divide by the Coefficient of \( x \):**
   - The coefficient of \( x \) is 3. Divide both sides of the equation by 3 to solve for \( x \).
   \[
   \frac{3x}{3} = \frac{15}{3}
   \]
   - Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   x = 5
   \]

5. **Verify the Solution:**
   - Substitute \( x = 5 \) back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies the equation.
   \[
   3(5) + 5 = 20
   \]
   - Simplify the left side:
   \[
   15 + 5 = 20
   \]
   - Since both sides of the equation are equal, our solution is verified.

**Final Answer:**
The solution to the equation \( 3x + 5 = 20 \) is \( x = 5 \).
