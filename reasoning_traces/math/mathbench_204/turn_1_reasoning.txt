==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample math problem 204" refers to. Since there is no specific problem statement provided, I'll create a hypothetical math problem that could be labeled as "Sample math problem 204" and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem 204:**

Calculate the sum of the first 204 positive integers.

**Step-by-step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   We need to find the sum of the first 204 positive integers. This is a classic arithmetic series problem.

2. **Identify the Formula:**
   The sum \( S \) of the first \( n \) positive integers can be calculated using the formula:
   \[
   S = \frac{n(n + 1)}{2}
   \]
   where \( n \) is the number of terms.

3. **Substitute the Values:**
   Here, \( n = 204 \). Substitute \( n \) into the formula:
   \[
   S = \frac{204(204 + 1)}{2}
   \]

4. **Perform the Calculations:**
   - First, calculate \( 204 + 1 \):
     \[
     204 + 1 = 205
     \]
   - Next, multiply 204 by 205:
     \[
     204 \times 205 = 41820
     \]
   - Finally, divide the product by 2 to find the sum:
     \[
     S = \frac{41820}{2} = 20910
     \]

5. **Verify the Calculation:**
   To ensure accuracy, let's verify by recalculating:
   - Recalculate \( 204 \times 205 \):
     \[
     204 \times 205 = 204 \times (200 + 5) = 204 \times 200 + 204 \times 5
     \]
     \[
     = 40800 + 1020 = 41820
     \]
   - Divide by 2:
     \[
     \frac{41820}{2} = 20910
     \]

6. **Conclusion:**
   The sum of the first 204 positive integers is \( 20910 \).

**Final Answer:**
The sum of the first 204 positive integers is 20910.
