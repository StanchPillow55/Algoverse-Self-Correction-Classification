==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 204," we need to first understand what the problem is asking. However, the problem statement is incomplete as it only says "Sample math problem 204" without providing any specific details or numbers to work with. 

Since there is no specific problem given, I will demonstrate how to approach a generic math problem by creating a hypothetical example. Let's assume "Sample math problem 204" refers to a common type of math problem, such as solving a quadratic equation. 

### Hypothetical Problem: Solve the quadratic equation \(2x^2 - 4x - 6 = 0\).

#### Step 1: Identify the coefficients
The standard form of a quadratic equation is \(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\). For the equation \(2x^2 - 4x - 6 = 0\), the coefficients are:
- \(a = 2\)
- \(b = -4\)
- \(c = -6\)

#### Step 2: Calculate the discriminant
The discriminant (\(\Delta\)) of a quadratic equation is given by the formula:
\[
\Delta = b^2 - 4ac
\]
Substitute the values of \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\):
\[
\Delta = (-4)^2 - 4 \times 2 \times (-6) = 16 + 48 = 64
\]

#### Step 3: Determine the nature of the roots
Since the discriminant \(\Delta = 64\) is greater than zero, the quadratic equation has two distinct real roots.

#### Step 4: Use the quadratic formula to find the roots
The quadratic formula is:
\[
x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{\Delta}}{2a}
\]
Substitute the values of \(b\), \(\Delta\), and \(a\):
\[
x = \frac{-(-4) \pm \sqrt{64}}{2 \times 2} = \frac{4 \pm 8}{4}
\]

#### Step 5: Calculate the roots
Calculate the two possible values for \(x\):
1. \(x_1 = \frac{4 + 8}{4} = \frac{12}{4} = 3\)
2. \(x_2 = \frac{4 - 8}{4} = \frac{-4}{4} = -1\)

### Final Answer
The solutions to the quadratic equation \(2x^2 - 4x - 6 = 0\) are \(x = 3\) and \(x = -1\).

This is a complete solution to a hypothetical quadratic equation problem. If you have a specific "Sample math problem 204" in mind, please provide the details, and I will be happy to solve it for you.
