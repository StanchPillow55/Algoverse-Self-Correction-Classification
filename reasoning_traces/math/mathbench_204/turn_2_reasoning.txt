==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 204," we need to first understand what the problem is asking. However, the problem statement is incomplete as it only states "Sample math problem 204" without any specific details or context. Therefore, I will assume that "204" might refer to a specific math problem number from a textbook or a problem set. Without additional information, I will create a hypothetical math problem involving the number 204 and solve it.

**Hypothetical Problem:**

Let's assume the problem is as follows:

"Find the prime factorization of the number 204."

**Step-by-step Solution:**

1. **Understanding Prime Factorization:**
   Prime factorization involves expressing a number as a product of its prime factors. A prime number is a number greater than 1 that has no divisors other than 1 and itself.

2. **Start with the Smallest Prime Number:**
   Begin dividing the number 204 by the smallest prime number, which is 2.

   \[
   204 \div 2 = 102
   \]

   Since 204 is even, it is divisible by 2. So, 2 is a prime factor.

3. **Continue with the Quotient:**
   Now, take the quotient 102 and divide it by 2 again.

   \[
   102 \div 2 = 51
   \]

   Again, 102 is even, so it is divisible by 2. Thus, another 2 is a prime factor.

4. **Proceed with the Next Quotient:**
   Now, take the quotient 51. Since 51 is not even, it is not divisible by 2. Move to the next smallest prime number, which is 3.

   \[
   51 \div 3 = 17
   \]

   The sum of the digits of 51 is 5 + 1 = 6, which is divisible by 3. Therefore, 51 is divisible by 3, making 3 a prime factor.

5. **Check the Final Quotient:**
   Now, we have the quotient 17. Check if 17 is a prime number.

   - 17 is not divisible by 2 (it's odd).
   - 17 is not divisible by 3 (1 + 7 = 8, which is not divisible by 3).
   - The next prime number to check is 5, but since 5 squared (25) is greater than 17, we can conclude that 17 is a prime number.

6. **Compile the Prime Factors:**
   The prime factors of 204 are 2, 2, 3, and 17.

7. **Express as a Product of Prime Factors:**
   Therefore, the prime factorization of 204 is:

   \[
   204 = 2^2 \times 3 \times 17
   \]

**Final Answer:**

The prime factorization of 204 is \(2^2 \times 3 \times 17\).
