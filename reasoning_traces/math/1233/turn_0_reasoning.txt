To solve the problem, we will go through it step by step.

1. **Determine how many apples Walter ate:**
   Walter bought 60 apples and ate \( \frac{2}{5} \) of them.

   \[
   \text{Number of apples eaten} = \frac{2}{5} \times 60
   \]

   Calculating this:

   \[
   \frac{2}{5} \times 60 = \frac{120}{5} = 24
   \]

   So, Walter ate 24 apples.

2. **Calculate the remaining apples after eating:**
   To find out how many apples Walter has left after eating, we subtract the number of apples he ate from the total he bought.

   \[
   \text{Remaining apples} = 60 - 24 = 36
   \]

3. **Determine how many apples Walter gave to his sister:**
   Walter gave his sister 25% of the remaining apples.

   \[
   \text{Number of apples given to sister} = 0.25 \times 36
   \]

   Calculating this:

   \[
   0.25 \times 36 = 9
   \]

   So, Walter gave 9 apples to his sister.

4. **Calculate the remaining apples after giving some to his sister:**
   Now, we need to find out how many apples Walter has left after giving 9 apples to his sister.

   \[
   \text{Remaining apples} = 36 - 9 = 27
   \]

5. **Determine how much money Walter received from selling the remaining apples:**
   Walter sold the remaining 27 apples to his uncle at $3 each.

   \[
   \text{Total money received} = 27 \times 3
   \]

   Calculating this:

   \[
   27 \times 3 = 81
   \]

Thus, Walter received a total of **$81** from selling the remaining apples.

**Final Answer: $81**
