==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to determine how many pears George has based on the information given about the number of bananas and the percentage increase in the number of pears compared to bananas.

1. **Identify the number of bananas**: 
   George has 200 bananas.

2. **Calculate the number of pears**:
   According to the problem, George has 45% more pears than bananas. To find the number of pears, we first need to calculate what 45% of the number of bananas is.

   \[
   45\% \text{ of } 200 = 0.45 \times 200
   \]

   Performing the multiplication:

   \[
   0.45 \times 200 = 90
   \]

   This means that George has 90 more pears than the number of bananas he has.

3. **Find the total number of pears**:
   Now we add the number of bananas to the additional pears to find the total number of pears:

   \[
   \text{Number of pears} = \text{Number of bananas} + \text{Additional pears}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Number of pears} = 200 + 90 = 290
   \]

4. **Calculate the total number of fruits**:
   Finally, we need to find the total number of fruits George has, which is the sum of the number of bananas and the number of pears:

   \[
   \text{Total fruits} = \text{Number of bananas} + \text{Number of pears}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total fruits} = 200 + 290 = 490
   \]

Thus, the total number of fruits that George has is:

\[
\boxed{490}
\]
