==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 115," we need to first understand what the problem is asking. Since the problem statement is not provided, I'll create a hypothetical math problem labeled as "Sample math problem 115" and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem Statement:**
"Sample math problem 115: If \( x \) and \( y \) are integers such that \( 3x + 4y = 24 \), find all possible pairs \((x, y)\)."

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Equation:**
   The equation given is a linear Diophantine equation: \( 3x + 4y = 24 \). We need to find integer solutions for \( x \) and \( y \).

2. **Find Particular Solution:**
   We can start by finding one particular solution to the equation. Let's try \( x = 0 \) and solve for \( y \):
   \[
   3(0) + 4y = 24 \implies 4y = 24 \implies y = 6
   \]
   So, \((x, y) = (0, 6)\) is a particular solution.

3. **General Solution:**
   The general solution of a linear Diophantine equation \( ax + by = c \) can be expressed as:
   \[
   x = x_0 + \frac{b}{\gcd(a, b)}t, \quad y = y_0 - \frac{a}{\gcd(a, b)}t
   \]
   where \( (x_0, y_0) \) is a particular solution and \( t \) is an integer.

   For our equation \( 3x + 4y = 24 \), the gcd of 3 and 4 is 1. Therefore, the general solution becomes:
   \[
   x = 0 + 4t = 4t, \quad y = 6 - 3t
   \]

4. **Find Integer Solutions:**
   We need to find integer values of \( t \) such that both \( x \) and \( y \) are integers. Since \( t \) is already an integer, we only need to ensure that \( y \) remains non-negative (as no specific constraints on \( x \) and \( y \) being positive are given, but typically \( y \) should be non-negative in such problems).

   \[
   6 - 3t \geq 0 \implies 6 \geq 3t \implies t \leq 2
   \]

   Also, since \( y \) should be non-negative, we consider \( t \geq 0 \).

5. **List Possible Pairs:**
   Now, we list the possible integer pairs \((x, y)\) for \( t = 0, 1, 2 \):
   - For \( t = 0 \): \( x = 4(0) = 0 \), \( y = 6 - 3(0) = 6 \) \(\Rightarrow (x, y) = (0, 6)\)
   - For \( t = 1 \): \( x = 4(1) = 4 \), \( y = 6 - 3(1) = 3 \) \(\Rightarrow (x, y) = (4, 3)\)
   - For \( t = 2 \): \( x = 4(2) = 8 \), \( y = 6 - 3(2) = 0 \) \(\Rightarrow (x, y) = (8, 0)\)

6. **Final Answer:**
   The integer solutions to the equation \( 3x + 4y = 24 \) are:
   \[
   (x, y) = (0, 6), (4, 3), (8, 0)
   \]

These are all the possible pairs of integers \((x, y)\) that satisfy the given equation.
