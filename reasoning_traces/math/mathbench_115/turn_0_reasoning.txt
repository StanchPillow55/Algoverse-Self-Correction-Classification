==================================================

To solve the problem effectively, I need more information about "Sample math problem 115." Since I don't have access to external databases or specific problem sets, I'll demonstrate how to solve a generic math problem by walking through a sample problem step-by-step. If you have a specific problem in mind, please provide the details, and I'll be happy to help.

Let's consider a sample math problem:

**Problem:**
Solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   The equation given is \( 2x + 3 = 11 \). We need to find the value of \( x \) that satisfies this equation.

2. **Isolate the Variable:**
   To solve for \( x \), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We can start by eliminating the constant term on the left side.

   \[
   2x + 3 = 11
   \]

   Subtract 3 from both sides to get:

   \[
   2x + 3 - 3 = 11 - 3
   \]

   Simplifying both sides gives:

   \[
   2x = 8
   \]

3. **Solve for \( x \):**
   Now, we need to solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides by 2.

   \[
   \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{8}{2}
   \]

   Simplifying both sides gives:

   \[
   x = 4
   \]

4. **Verify the Solution:**
   To ensure our solution is correct, substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation:

   \[
   2(4) + 3 = 11
   \]

   Simplifying the left side gives:

   \[
   8 + 3 = 11
   \]

   Since both sides of the equation are equal, our solution \( x = 4 \) is correct.

**Final Answer:**
The solution to the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \) is \( x = 4 \).

If you have a specific problem or need help with a different type of math problem, please provide the details, and I'll be glad to assist you further!
