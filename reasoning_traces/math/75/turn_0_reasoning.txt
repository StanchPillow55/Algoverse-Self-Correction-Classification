==================================================

First, we need to calculate the cost of Dale's breakfast. He had 2 slices of toast and 2 eggs. Since a slice of toast costs £1, two slices would cost 2*£1 = £2. Similarly, since an egg costs £3, two eggs would cost 2*£3 = £6. Therefore, the total cost of Dale's breakfast is £2 (for the toast) + £6 (for the eggs) = £8.

Next, we need to calculate the cost of Andrew's breakfast. He had 1 slice of toast and 2 eggs. The toast costs £1 and the two eggs cost 2*£3 = £6. Therefore, the total cost of Andrew's breakfast is £1 (for the toast) + £6 (for the eggs) = £7.

Finally, to find the total cost of their breakfast, we add the cost of Dale's breakfast to the cost of Andrew's breakfast. This gives us £8 (for Dale's breakfast) + £7 (for Andrew's breakfast) = £15.

Therefore, the total cost of their breakfast was £15.
