==================================================

To find the total cost of Dale and Andrew's breakfast, we will calculate the cost for each person separately and then sum the costs.

### Step 1: Calculate Dale's Breakfast Cost

Dale had:
- 2 slices of toast
- 2 eggs

**Cost of Toast:**
- Each slice of toast costs £1.
- Therefore, the cost for 2 slices of toast is:
  \[
  2 \text{ slices} \times £1/\text{slice} = £2
  \]

**Cost of Eggs:**
- Each egg costs £3.
- Therefore, the cost for 2 eggs is:
  \[
  2 \text{ eggs} \times £3/\text{egg} = £6
  \]

**Total Cost for Dale:**
- Now, we add the cost of the toast and the cost of the eggs:
  \[
  £2 + £6 = £8
  \]

### Step 2: Calculate Andrew's Breakfast Cost

Andrew had:
- 1 slice of toast
- 2 eggs

**Cost of Toast:**
- Each slice of toast costs £1.
- Therefore, the cost for 1 slice of toast is:
  \[
  1 \text{ slice} \times £1/\text{slice} = £1
  \]

**Cost of Eggs:**
- Each egg costs £3.
- Therefore, the cost for 2 eggs is:
  \[
  2 \text{ eggs} \times £3/\text{egg} = £6
  \]

**Total Cost for Andrew:**
- Now, we add the cost of the toast and the cost of the eggs:
  \[
  £1 + £6 = £7
  \]

### Step 3: Calculate Total Cost for Both

Now, we will add the total costs for Dale and Andrew:
\[
\text{Total Cost} = \text{Cost for Dale} + \text{Cost for Andrew} = £8 + £7 = £15
\]

### Final Answer
The total cost of their breakfast is:
\[
\boxed{£15}
\]
