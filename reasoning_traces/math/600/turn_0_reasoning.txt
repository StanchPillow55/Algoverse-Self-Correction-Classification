Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we will follow these steps:

1. **Determine the increase in weight**: Jamaal starts with an 8-pound weight and increases it by 50%. To find 50% of 8 pounds, we calculate:

   \[
   50\% \text{ of } 8 = 0.50 \times 8 = 4 \text{ pounds}
   \]

2. **Calculate the new weight after the increase**: We add the increase to the original weight:

   \[
   \text{New weight} = 8 + 4 = 12 \text{ pounds}
   \]

3. **Determine the weight he actually uses**: Jamaal finds the 12-pound weight too heavy, so he decides to use a weight that is 2 pounds lighter than the 12 pounds. We calculate this by subtracting 2 pounds from the new weight:

   \[
   \text{Weight used} = 12 - 2 = 10 \text{ pounds}
   \]

Now, we have completed all the calculations and reasoning. The weight that Jamaal now uses is:

\[
\boxed{10} \text{ pounds}
\]
