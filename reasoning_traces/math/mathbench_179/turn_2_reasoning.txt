Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample math problem 179" refers to. Since no specific details about the problem are provided, I'll assume this is a placeholder for a generic math problem. Let's create a sample problem and solve it step by step.

**Sample Math Problem 179:**

**Problem:**  
Solve for \( x \) in the equation:  
\[ 3x + 5 = 20 \]

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Equation:**
   The equation given is a linear equation in one variable, \( x \). Our goal is to isolate \( x \) on one side of the equation to find its value.

2. **Isolate the Variable:**
   To isolate \( x \), we need to perform operations that will leave \( x \) by itself on one side of the equation.

3. **Subtract 5 from Both Sides:**
   We start by eliminating the constant term on the left side of the equation. We do this by subtracting 5 from both sides:
   \[
   3x + 5 - 5 = 20 - 5
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   3x = 15
   \]

4. **Divide Both Sides by 3:**
   Next, we divide both sides by 3 to solve for \( x \):
   \[
   \frac{3x}{3} = \frac{15}{3}
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   x = 5
   \]

5. **Verify the Solution:**
   To ensure our solution is correct, we substitute \( x = 5 \) back into the original equation:
   \[
   3(5) + 5 = 20
   \]
   Simplifying the left side gives:
   \[
   15 + 5 = 20
   \]
   \[
   20 = 20
   \]
   The left side equals the right side, confirming that our solution is correct.

**Final Answer:**
The solution to the equation \( 3x + 5 = 20 \) is \( x = 5 \).
