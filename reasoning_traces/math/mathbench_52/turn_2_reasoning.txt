Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 52," we need to first understand what the problem is asking. Since the problem statement is not provided, let's assume a hypothetical math problem that involves basic arithmetic operations. I'll create a sample problem and solve it step by step.

**Sample Math Problem 52:**

Calculate the result of the following expression:

\[ 52 + (8 \times 3) - 15 \div 5 \]

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Identify the Order of Operations:**
   According to the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS), we need to solve expressions in the following order:
   - Parentheses/Brackets
   - Exponents/Orders (such as squares and square roots, etc.)
   - Multiplication and Division (from left to right)
   - Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)

2. **Solve the Expression Inside Parentheses:**
   In the given expression, the parentheses contain \(8 \times 3\). We solve this first:
   \[
   8 \times 3 = 24
   \]

3. **Substitute Back into the Expression:**
   Replace the parentheses with the result:
   \[
   52 + 24 - 15 \div 5
   \]

4. **Perform Division:**
   Next, perform the division operation:
   \[
   15 \div 5 = 3
   \]

5. **Substitute Back into the Expression:**
   Replace the division result back into the expression:
   \[
   52 + 24 - 3
   \]

6. **Perform Addition and Subtraction from Left to Right:**
   - First, perform the addition:
     \[
     52 + 24 = 76
     \]
   - Then, perform the subtraction:
     \[
     76 - 3 = 73
     \]

**Final Answer:**

The result of the expression \(52 + (8 \times 3) - 15 \div 5\) is \(73\).

Therefore, the final answer is:
\[ \boxed{73} \]
