==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 52," we need to first understand what the problem is asking. However, the problem statement is incomplete as it stands. Let's assume that "Sample math problem 52" refers to a specific math problem that involves a calculation or a concept that needs to be addressed. Since we don't have the exact details of the problem, I'll create a hypothetical math problem based on common math topics and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**
Calculate the sum of the first 52 positive integers.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   We need to find the sum of the first 52 positive integers. This is a classic problem that can be solved using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series.

2. **Identify the Arithmetic Series:**
   The series of the first 52 positive integers is: 1, 2, 3, ..., 52.
   This is an arithmetic series where the first term \( a = 1 \) and the last term \( l = 52 \).

3. **Use the Formula for the Sum of an Arithmetic Series:**
   The formula for the sum \( S_n \) of the first \( n \) terms of an arithmetic series is:
   \[
   S_n = \frac{n}{2} \times (a + l)
   \]
   where \( n \) is the number of terms, \( a \) is the first term, and \( l \) is the last term.

4. **Substitute the Known Values:**
   Here, \( n = 52 \), \( a = 1 \), and \( l = 52 \).
   \[
   S_{52} = \frac{52}{2} \times (1 + 52)
   \]

5. **Calculate the Sum:**
   \[
   S_{52} = 26 \times 53
   \]

6. **Perform the Multiplication:**
   \[
   26 \times 53 = 26 \times (50 + 3) = 26 \times 50 + 26 \times 3
   \]
   \[
   = 1300 + 78 = 1378
   \]

7. **Final Answer:**
   The sum of the first 52 positive integers is 1378.

Therefore, the final answer is 1378.
