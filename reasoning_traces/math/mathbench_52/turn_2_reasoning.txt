Question ID: mathbench_52
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 52," we need to first understand what the problem is asking. However, the phrase "Sample math problem 52" is not specific enough to determine the exact problem. Since there is no specific mathematical question provided, I'll create a hypothetical math problem involving the number 52 and solve it step by step.

### Hypothetical Problem:
**Problem:** If 52 is divided by a number \( x \), the result is 13. What is the value of \( x \)?

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We are given that when 52 is divided by \( x \), the result is 13.
   - Mathematically, this can be expressed as:
     \[
     \frac{52}{x} = 13
     \]

2. **Set Up the Equation:**
   - From the equation \(\frac{52}{x} = 13\), we need to solve for \( x \).

3. **Solve for \( x \):**
   - To isolate \( x \), multiply both sides of the equation by \( x \):
     \[
     52 = 13x
     \]
   - Next, divide both sides by 13 to solve for \( x \):
     \[
     x = \frac{52}{13}
     \]

4. **Calculate the Value of \( x \):**
   - Perform the division:
     \[
     x = 4
     \]

5. **Verify the Solution:**
   - Substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation to verify:
     \[
     \frac{52}{4} = 13
     \]
   - Since the left-hand side equals the right-hand side, our solution is verified.

### Final Answer:
The value of \( x \) is 4.

This solution demonstrates a clear understanding of how to solve a basic division equation by isolating the variable and verifying the solution. If you have a specific math problem labeled as "Sample math problem 52," please provide the details, and I will be happy to solve it for you.
