Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 52," we first need to understand what the problem is asking. However, the problem statement "Sample math problem 52" is not specific and does not provide any details about the actual mathematical question or context. Therefore, I will assume that this is a placeholder for a specific math problem that you intended to provide.

Since I don't have the specific details of "Sample math problem 52," I will demonstrate how to approach a generic math problem by creating an example problem and solving it step by step.

### Example Problem:
Let's assume "Sample math problem 52" is the following:

**Problem:**
Solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 3x + 5 = 20 \).

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Understand the Equation:**
   The equation given is \( 3x + 5 = 20 \). This is a linear equation in one variable, \( x \).

2. **Isolate the Variable:**
   To solve for \( x \), we need to isolate \( x \) on one side of the equation. We can do this by performing inverse operations.

3. **Subtract 5 from Both Sides:**
   To eliminate the constant term on the left side, subtract 5 from both sides of the equation:
   \[
   3x + 5 - 5 = 20 - 5
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   3x = 15
   \]

4. **Divide by 3:**
   Now, divide both sides by 3 to solve for \( x \):
   \[
   \frac{3x}{3} = \frac{15}{3}
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   x = 5
   \]

5. **Verify the Solution:**
   Substitute \( x = 5 \) back into the original equation to verify the solution:
   \[
   3(5) + 5 = 20
   \]
   Simplifying the left side gives:
   \[
   15 + 5 = 20
   \]
   \[
   20 = 20
   \]
   Since both sides of the equation are equal, the solution \( x = 5 \) is verified.

### Final Answer:
The solution to the equation \( 3x + 5 = 20 \) is \( x = 5 \).

If you have a specific problem labeled as "Sample math problem 52," please provide the details, and I will be happy to solve it for you.
