Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 52," we need to first understand what the problem is asking. However, the problem statement "Sample math problem 52" is not specific enough for us to determine the exact mathematical question or context. Therefore, I will assume a hypothetical math problem labeled as "52" and solve it step by step.

Let's assume "Sample math problem 52" is the following:

**Problem 52:**
Calculate the sum of the first 52 positive integers.

To solve this problem, we can use the formula for the sum of the first \( n \) positive integers, which is given by:

\[
S_n = \frac{n(n + 1)}{2}
\]

where \( n \) is the number of terms. In this case, \( n = 52 \).

**Step-by-step Calculation:**

1. **Identify the formula:**
   The formula for the sum of the first \( n \) positive integers is:
   \[
   S_n = \frac{n(n + 1)}{2}
   \]

2. **Substitute \( n = 52 \) into the formula:**
   \[
   S_{52} = \frac{52(52 + 1)}{2}
   \]

3. **Calculate \( 52 + 1 \):**
   \[
   52 + 1 = 53
   \]

4. **Multiply 52 by 53:**
   \[
   52 \times 53 = 2756
   \]

5. **Divide the product by 2:**
   \[
   \frac{2756}{2} = 1378
   \]

Therefore, the sum of the first 52 positive integers is 1378.

**Final Answer:**
The sum of the first 52 positive integers is 1378.
