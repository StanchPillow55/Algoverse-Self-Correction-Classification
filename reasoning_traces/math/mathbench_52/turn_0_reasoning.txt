==================================================

It seems like there might be some confusion with the problem statement "Sample math problem 52." Without a specific math problem provided, I can't solve it directly. However, I can guide you through a generic process for solving a math problem, assuming it's a typical problem involving numbers or equations. If you have a specific problem in mind, please provide the details, and I'll be happy to help.

Here's a general approach to solving a math problem:

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - Read the problem carefully.
   - Identify what is being asked.
   - Determine what information is given and what needs to be found.

2. **Devise a Plan:**
   - Think about the mathematical concepts that might apply (e.g., algebra, geometry, calculus).
   - Consider possible strategies (e.g., drawing a diagram, writing an equation).

3. **Carry Out the Plan:**
   - Execute the chosen strategy step by step.
   - Perform calculations carefully.
   - Keep track of units and signs.

4. **Check Your Work:**
   - Review each step to ensure calculations are correct.
   - Verify that the solution makes sense in the context of the problem.
   - Check if there is another method to solve the problem and compare results.

5. **State the Final Answer:**
   - Clearly write the final answer.
   - Include units if applicable.

Since no specific problem was given, I can't provide a final answer. If you have a particular math problem you need help with, please provide the details, and I'll be glad to assist you further!
