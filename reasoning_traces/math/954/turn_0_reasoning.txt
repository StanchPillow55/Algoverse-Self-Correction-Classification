==================================================

To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the number of measuring cups Jonathan has:**
   Jonathan has two dozen measuring cups. Since one dozen equals 12, we can calculate the total number of cups:
   \[
   \text{Number of measuring cups} = 2 \times 12 = 24
   \]

2. **Calculate the number of measuring spoons Jonathan has:**
   According to the problem, Jonathan has \( \frac{2}{3} \) as many measuring spoons as measuring cups. We can find the number of measuring spoons by multiplying the number of measuring cups by \( \frac{2}{3} \):
   \[
   \text{Number of measuring spoons} = \frac{2}{3} \times 24
   \]
   To perform the multiplication:
   \[
   \frac{2}{3} \times 24 = \frac{2 \times 24}{3} = \frac{48}{3} = 16
   \]
   So, Jonathan has 16 measuring spoons.

3. **Calculate the number of measuring spoons after gifting 6 to Pedro:**
   Jonathan gifts 6 measuring spoons to Pedro. We need to subtract this number from the total number of measuring spoons he has:
   \[
   \text{Remaining measuring spoons} = 16 - 6 = 10
   \]

4. **Calculate the total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining:**
   Now we need to find the total number of utensils Jonathan has left, which includes both measuring cups and the remaining measuring spoons:
   \[
   \text{Total utensils remaining} = \text{Remaining measuring cups} + \text{Remaining measuring spoons}
   \]
   We already know he has 24 measuring cups and now has 10 measuring spoons:
   \[
   \text{Total utensils remaining} = 24 + 10 = 34
   \]

5. **Final answer:**
   Therefore, the total number of utensils Jonathan has remaining is:
   \[
   \boxed{34}
   \]
