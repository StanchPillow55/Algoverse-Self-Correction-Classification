Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to calculate the total number of flashlights and candles Brianna's family is using when the power goes out.

### Step 1: Calculate the number of flashlights
- There are 4 people in the house, and each person has one flashlight.
- Therefore, the total number of flashlights is:
  \[
  \text{Total flashlights} = 4 \text{ (one for each person)}
  \]

### Step 2: Calculate the number of candles
The house has 8 rooms, and the candles are distributed as follows:
- Half of the rooms (4 rooms) have 4 small candles each.
- The other half of the rooms (4 rooms) have 5 medium candles each.

#### Small candles:
- For the 4 rooms with small candles:
  \[
  \text{Total small candles} = 4 \text{ rooms} \times 4 \text{ small candles/room} = 16 \text{ small candles}
  \]

#### Medium candles:
- For the 4 rooms with medium candles:
  \[
  \text{Total medium candles} = 4 \text{ rooms} \times 5 \text{ medium candles/room} = 20 \text{ medium candles}
  \]

### Step 3: Calculate the total number of candles
Now, we add the small and medium candles together:
\[
\text{Total candles} = 16 \text{ small candles} + 20 \text{ medium candles} = 36 \text{ candles}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the total number of items (flashlights + candles)
Now we combine the total number of flashlights and candles:
\[
\text{Total items} = \text{Total flashlights} + \text{Total candles} = 4 + 36 = 40
\]

### Final Answer
Brianna's family is using a total of **40 items** (flashlights and candles) when the lights go out.
