To solve the problem, we will break it down into parts: calculating the number of flashlights and the number of candles.

### Step 1: Calculate the number of flashlights

1. **Flashlights per person**: There are 4 people in the house, and each person has one flashlight.
   \[
   \text{Total flashlights} = \text{Number of people} = 4
   \]

2. **Flashlights per room**: There are 8 rooms in the house, and each room has 2 flashlights.
   \[
   \text{Total flashlights from rooms} = \text{Number of rooms} \times \text{Flashlights per room} = 8 \times 2 = 16
   \]

3. **Total flashlights**: Now, we add the flashlights carried by the people and the flashlights in the rooms.
   \[
   \text{Total flashlights} = \text{Flashlights per person} + \text{Flashlights from rooms} = 4 + 16 = 20
   \]

### Step 2: Calculate the number of candles

1. **Small candles**: Half of the rooms have small candles. Since there are 8 rooms, half of them is:
   \[
   \text{Number of rooms with small candles} = \frac{8}{2} = 4
   \]
   Each of these rooms has 4 small candles.
   \[
   \text{Total small candles} = \text{Number of rooms with small candles} \times \text{Small candles per room} = 4 \times 4 = 16
   \]

2. **Medium candles**: The other half of the rooms have medium candles. The number of rooms with medium candles is also 4, and each of these rooms has 5 medium candles.
   \[
   \text{Total medium candles} = \text{Number of rooms with medium candles} \times \text{Medium candles per room} = 4 \times 5 = 20
   \]

3. **Total candles**: Now, we add the total number of small candles and medium candles.
   \[
   \text{Total candles} = \text{Total small candles} + \text{Total medium candles} = 16 + 20 = 36
   \]

### Step 3: Combine the totals

Now, we combine the total number of flashlights and candles to find the overall total.
\[
\text{Total items (candles + flashlights)} = \text{Total flashlights} + \text{Total candles} = 20 + 36 = 56
\]

### Final Answer

The total number of candles and flashlights Brianna's family is using when the lights go out is:
\[
\boxed{56}
\]
