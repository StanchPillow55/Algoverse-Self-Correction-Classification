Question ID: 1249
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step, calculating the number of flashlights and candles used by Brianna's family.

### Step 1: Calculate the number of flashlights
- There are 4 people in Brianna's family, and each person has one flashlight.
- Therefore, the total number of flashlights is:
  \[
  \text{Total flashlights} = \text{Number of people} = 4
  \]

### Step 2: Calculate the number of flashlights in the rooms
- There are 8 rooms in the house, and each room has 2 flashlights.
- Therefore, the total number of flashlights in the rooms is:
  \[
  \text{Flashlights in rooms} = \text{Number of rooms} \times \text{Flashlights per room} = 8 \times 2 = 16
  \]

### Step 3: Calculate the total number of flashlights
- Now, we add the flashlights carried by the people to the flashlights in the rooms:
  \[
  \text{Total flashlights} = \text{Flashlights carried by people} + \text{Flashlights in rooms} = 4 + 16 = 20
  \]

### Step 4: Calculate the number of candles
- The problem states that there are two types of rooms: half have small candles and half have medium candles.
- Since there are 8 rooms, half of them (4 rooms) will have small candles, and the other half (4 rooms) will have medium candles.

#### Small Candles:
- Each of the 4 rooms with small candles has 4 small candles.
- Therefore, the total number of small candles is:
  \[
  \text{Total small candles} = \text{Number of small candle rooms} \times \text{Small candles per room} = 4 \times 4 = 16
  \]

#### Medium Candles:
- Each of the 4 rooms with medium candles has 5 medium candles.
- Therefore, the total number of medium candles is:
  \[
  \text{Total medium candles} = \text{Number of medium candle rooms} \times \text{Medium candles per room} = 4 \times 5 = 20
  \]

### Step 5: Calculate the total number of candles
- Now, we add the total number of small candles and medium candles:
  \[
  \text{Total candles} = \text{Total small candles} + \text{Total medium candles} = 16 + 20 = 36
  \]

### Step 6: Calculate the total number of items (candles + flashlights)
- Finally, we add the total number of candles to the total number of flashlights:
  \[
  \text{Total items} = \text{Total candles} + \text{Total flashlights} = 36 + 20 = 56
  \]

### Final Answer
The total number of candles and flashlights Brianna's family is using when the lights go out is:
\[
\boxed{56}
\]
