==================================================

To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step.

1. **Initial Likes**: Fishio received 2000 likes on her selfie after 1 week.

2. **Likes After Three Weeks**: The problem states that three weeks later, the number of likes was 70 times the initial number of likes. 
   - We calculate this as follows:
   \[
   \text{Likes after three weeks} = 70 \times \text{Initial likes} = 70 \times 2000
   \]
   \[
   \text{Likes after three weeks} = 140000
   \]

3. **New Likes Received**: The problem also mentions that she received 20000 more new likes recently. 
   - We need to add these new likes to the total likes after three weeks:
   \[
   \text{Total likes now} = \text{Likes after three weeks} + \text{New likes}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total likes now} = 140000 + 20000
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total likes now} = 160000
   \]

4. **Final Answer**: The total number of Instagram likes Fishio has now is:
\[
\boxed{160000}
\] 

Thus, the final answer is 160,000 likes.
