Question ID: 649
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step.

1. **Initial Likes**: Fishio received 2000 likes on her selfie after 1 week.

2. **Likes After 3 Weeks**: Three weeks later, the number of likes was 70 times the initial number of likes. We can calculate this as follows:
   \[
   \text{Likes after 3 weeks} = 70 \times \text{Initial Likes} = 70 \times 2000
   \]
   \[
   \text{Likes after 3 weeks} = 140000
   \]

3. **New Likes**: According to the problem, she received 20000 more new likes recently. We need to add these new likes to the total number of likes after 3 weeks:
   \[
   \text{Total Likes} = \text{Likes after 3 weeks} + \text{New Likes}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total Likes} = 140000 + 20000
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total Likes} = 160000
   \]

4. **Final Answer**: Therefore, the total number of Instagram likes on Fishio's selfie is:
   \[
   \boxed{160000}
   \]
