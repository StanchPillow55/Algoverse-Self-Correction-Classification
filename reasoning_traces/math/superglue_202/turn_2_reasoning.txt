==================================================

To solve the problem effectively, let's first clarify the question. The question states "Sample reasoning question 202," which seems to be a placeholder or a reference to a specific problem. Without additional context or details about what "Sample reasoning question 202" entails, I'll assume it's a hypothetical problem that requires logical reasoning and mathematical calculations.

Since the problem is not explicitly defined, I'll create a sample reasoning problem and solve it step by step. Let's consider the following problem:

**Problem:**
A company produces two types of widgets: Type A and Type B. The company sells Type A widgets for $50 each and Type B widgets for $70 each. The production cost for Type A is $30 per widget, and for Type B, it is $40 per widget. Last month, the company sold a total of 500 widgets and made a total profit of $15,000. How many of each type of widget did the company sell?

**Solution:**

To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of Type A and Type B widgets sold. Let's define:
- \( x \) as the number of Type A widgets sold.
- \( y \) as the number of Type B widgets sold.

We have two main pieces of information:
1. The total number of widgets sold is 500.
2. The total profit is $15,000.

From the first piece of information, we can write the equation:
\[ x + y = 500 \]

For the second piece of information, we need to calculate the profit for each type of widget. The profit for each widget is the selling price minus the production cost:
- Profit per Type A widget = $50 - $30 = $20
- Profit per Type B widget = $70 - $40 = $30

The total profit from selling \( x \) Type A widgets and \( y \) Type B widgets is given by:
\[ 20x + 30y = 15,000 \]

Now we have a system of two equations:
1. \( x + y = 500 \)
2. \( 20x + 30y = 15,000 \)

We can solve this system using substitution or elimination. Let's use substitution:

From the first equation, solve for \( y \):
\[ y = 500 - x \]

Substitute \( y = 500 - x \) into the second equation:
\[ 20x + 30(500 - x) = 15,000 \]

Simplify and solve for \( x \):
\[ 20x + 15,000 - 30x = 15,000 \]
\[ -10x + 15,000 = 15,000 \]
\[ -10x = 0 \]
\[ x = 0 \]

Substitute \( x = 0 \) back into the equation for \( y \):
\[ y = 500 - 0 = 500 \]

Thus, the company sold 0 Type A widgets and 500 Type B widgets.

**Final Answer:**
The company sold 0 Type A widgets and 500 Type B widgets.
