==================================================

To solve the problem, I need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 202" refers to. Since this is not a standard math problem or a known problem type, I will assume it is a placeholder for a specific math problem. Without the actual content of "Sample reasoning question 202," I will create a hypothetical math problem and solve it step by step.

Let's assume "Sample reasoning question 202" is the following problem:

**Problem:**
A company produces two types of widgets: Type A and Type B. Each Type A widget requires 3 hours of labor and 2 units of material. Each Type B widget requires 2 hours of labor and 3 units of material. The company has a total of 120 hours of labor and 100 units of material available. The profit for each Type A widget is $40, and for each Type B widget is $50. How many of each type of widget should the company produce to maximize profit?

**Solution:**

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( x \) be the number of Type A widgets produced.
   - Let \( y \) be the number of Type B widgets produced.

2. **Set Up Constraints:**
   - Labor constraint: \( 3x + 2y \leq 120 \)
   - Material constraint: \( 2x + 3y \leq 100 \)
   - Non-negativity constraints: \( x \geq 0 \), \( y \geq 0 \)

3. **Objective Function:**
   - Maximize profit: \( P = 40x + 50y \)

4. **Graph the Constraints:**
   - Convert the inequalities to equations to find boundary lines:
     - \( 3x + 2y = 120 \)
     - \( 2x + 3y = 100 \)

5. **Find Intersections:**
   - Solve \( 3x + 2y = 120 \) and \( 2x + 3y = 100 \) simultaneously:
     - Multiply the first equation by 3: \( 9x + 6y = 360 \)
     - Multiply the second equation by 2: \( 4x + 6y = 200 \)
     - Subtract the second from the first: \( 5x = 160 \) → \( x = 32 \)
     - Substitute \( x = 32 \) into \( 3x + 2y = 120 \): \( 3(32) + 2y = 120 \) → \( 96 + 2y = 120 \) → \( 2y = 24 \) → \( y = 12 \)

6. **Vertices of the Feasible Region:**
   - Intersection with axes:
     - \( 3x + 2y = 120 \): \( x = 0 \), \( y = 60 \); \( y = 0 \), \( x = 40 \)
     - \( 2x + 3y = 100 \): \( x = 0 \), \( y = 33.33 \); \( y = 0 \), \( x = 50 \)
   - Intersection point: \( (32, 12) \)

7. **Evaluate Objective Function at Vertices:**
   - \( (0, 0) \): \( P = 40(0) + 50(0) = 0 \)
   - \( (40, 0) \): \( P = 40(40) + 50(0) = 1600 \)
   - \( (0, 33.33) \): \( P = 40(0) + 50(33.33) = 1666.5 \)
   - \( (32, 12) \): \( P = 40(32) + 50(12) = 1280 + 600 = 1880 \)

8. **Conclusion:**
   - The maximum profit is $1880, achieved by producing 32 Type A widgets and 12 Type B widgets.

**Final Answer:**
The company should produce 32 Type A widgets and 12 Type B widgets to maximize profit, resulting in a maximum profit of $1880.
