==================================================

To solve the problem effectively, let's first clarify what "Sample reasoning question 202" might entail. Since the question is not explicitly provided, I'll assume it is a typical math problem that requires logical reasoning and problem-solving skills. I'll create a hypothetical problem and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**

A train travels from City A to City B, a distance of 300 miles. The train travels the first 100 miles at a speed of 50 miles per hour, the next 100 miles at a speed of 60 miles per hour, and the final 100 miles at a speed of 75 miles per hour. What is the average speed of the train for the entire journey?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Calculate the time taken for each segment of the journey:**

   - **First Segment:**
     \[
     \text{Distance} = 100 \text{ miles}, \quad \text{Speed} = 50 \text{ mph}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{100}{50} = 2 \text{ hours}
     \]

   - **Second Segment:**
     \[
     \text{Distance} = 100 \text{ miles}, \quad \text{Speed} = 60 \text{ mph}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{100}{60} \approx 1.67 \text{ hours}
     \]

   - **Third Segment:**
     \[
     \text{Distance} = 100 \text{ miles}, \quad \text{Speed} = 75 \text{ mph}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{100}{75} \approx 1.33 \text{ hours}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total time for the journey:**

   \[
   \text{Total Time} = 2 + 1.67 + 1.33 = 5 \text{ hours}
   \]

3. **Calculate the average speed for the entire journey:**

   The average speed is given by the total distance divided by the total time.

   \[
   \text{Total Distance} = 300 \text{ miles}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Average Speed} = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Total Time}} = \frac{300}{5} = 60 \text{ mph}
   \]

**Final Answer:**

The average speed of the train for the entire journey is 60 miles per hour.
