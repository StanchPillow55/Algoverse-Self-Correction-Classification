To solve the problem, I need more information about "Sample reasoning question 202." Since the problem statement is not provided, I will demonstrate how to approach a typical math problem by creating a sample problem and solving it step by step.

**Sample Problem:**

A car travels from City A to City B, a distance of 150 miles. The car travels at an average speed of 50 miles per hour for the first part of the trip and then at an average speed of 60 miles per hour for the remaining part of the trip. If the total travel time is 3 hours, how far did the car travel at each speed?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( x \) be the distance traveled at 50 miles per hour.
   - Let \( y \) be the distance traveled at 60 miles per hour.

2. **Set Up Equations:**
   - The total distance equation is:
     \[
     x + y = 150
     \]
   - The total time equation is:
     \[
     \frac{x}{50} + \frac{y}{60} = 3
     \]

3. **Solve the System of Equations:**

   - From the first equation:
     \[
     y = 150 - x
     \]

   - Substitute \( y = 150 - x \) into the second equation:
     \[
     \frac{x}{50} + \frac{150 - x}{60} = 3
     \]

   - Clear the fractions by multiplying through by the least common multiple of 50 and 60, which is 300:
     \[
     300 \left(\frac{x}{50}\right) + 300 \left(\frac{150 - x}{60}\right) = 300 \times 3
     \]

   - Simplify:
     \[
     6x + 5(150 - x) = 900
     \]

   - Distribute and combine like terms:
     \[
     6x + 750 - 5x = 900
     \]

   - Simplify further:
     \[
     x + 750 = 900
     \]

   - Solve for \( x \):
     \[
     x = 900 - 750 = 150
     \]

   - Substitute \( x = 150 \) back into the equation for \( y \):
     \[
     y = 150 - 150 = 0
     \]

4. **Verify the Solution:**
   - Check the total distance:
     \[
     x + y = 150 + 0 = 150
     \]
   - Check the total time:
     \[
     \frac{150}{50} + \frac{0}{60} = 3 + 0 = 3
     \]

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The car traveled 150 miles at 50 miles per hour and 0 miles at 60 miles per hour.

**Final Answer:**
The car traveled 150 miles at 50 miles per hour and 0 miles at 60 miles per hour.
