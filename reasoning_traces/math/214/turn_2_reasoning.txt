==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine how many months ago Bella and Bob celebrated their 2nd anniversary, given that in 6 months they will celebrate their 4th anniversary.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Understanding the timeline:**
   - In 6 months, Bella and Bob will celebrate their 4th anniversary.
   - This means that currently, they are 6 months away from their 4th anniversary.

2. **Current anniversary year:**
   - Since they will celebrate their 4th anniversary in 6 months, they are currently in their 3rd anniversary year.

3. **Calculating the time since the 2nd anniversary:**
   - The 2nd anniversary occurred 1 year before the 3rd anniversary.
   - Since they are currently in their 3rd anniversary year, the 2nd anniversary was celebrated 1 year ago from their current anniversary year.

4. **Converting years to months:**
   - 1 year is equivalent to 12 months.

5. **Calculating the total months ago:**
   - Since the 2nd anniversary was celebrated 1 year ago from the current anniversary year, and 1 year equals 12 months, Bella and Bob celebrated their 2nd anniversary 12 months ago.

Therefore, Bella and Bob celebrated their 2nd anniversary 12 months ago.

**Final Answer: 12 months ago**
