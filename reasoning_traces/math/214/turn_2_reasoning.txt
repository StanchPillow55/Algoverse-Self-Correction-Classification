==================================================

To solve the problem, let's define some variables and work through the information step by step.

Let:
- \( S \) = the amount of water in the small pool 4 minutes ago (in gallons).
- \( B \) = the amount of water in the big pool 4 minutes ago (in gallons).

From the problem, we know that:
1. Four minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool:
   \[
   B = 2S
   \]

2. Both pools have leaks that empty them at a rate of 4 gallons per minute. Therefore, in 4 minutes, each pool loses:
   \[
   \text{Water lost by each pool} = 4 \text{ gallons/minute} \times 4 \text{ minutes} = 16 \text{ gallons}
   \]

Now, we can express the current amounts of water in each pool:
- The current amount of water in the small pool is:
  \[
  S_{\text{current}} = S - 16
  \]
- The current amount of water in the big pool is:
  \[
  B_{\text{current}} = B - 16
  \]

Substituting \( B = 2S \) into the equation for the big pool:
\[
B_{\text{current}} = 2S - 16
\]

According to the problem, now the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool:
\[
B_{\text{current}} = 4S_{\text{current}}
\]

Substituting the expressions we derived:
\[
2S - 16 = 4(S - 16)
\]

Now, let's simplify the right side:
\[
2S - 16 = 4S - 64
\]

Next, we will rearrange the equation to isolate \( S \):
\[
2S - 4S = -64 + 16
\]
\[
-2S = -48
\]
\[
S = 24
\]

Now that we have found \( S \), we can find the current amount of water in the small pool:
\[
S_{\text{current}} = S - 16 = 24 - 16 = 8 \text{ gallons}
\]

Thus, the small pool currently has **8 gallons** of water.

Final answer:
\[
\text{The small pool has } 8 \text{ gallons of water now.}
\]
