==================================================

To solve the problem, let's define some variables and work through the information step by step.

Let:
- \( S \) = the amount of water in the small pool now (in gallons).
- \( B \) = the amount of water in the big pool now (in gallons).

### Step 1: Understand the leak rate
Both pools leak at a rate of 4 gallons per minute. Since we are looking at the situation 4 minutes ago, we need to account for the water that has leaked out during that time.

In 4 minutes, each pool would have lost:
\[
\text{Water lost} = 4 \text{ gallons/minute} \times 4 \text{ minutes} = 16 \text{ gallons}
\]

### Step 2: Determine the water amounts 4 minutes ago
Four minutes ago, the amount of water in each pool would have been:
- Small pool: \( S + 16 \) gallons
- Big pool: \( B + 16 \) gallons

### Step 3: Set up the equations based on the problem statement
According to the problem:
1. Four minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool:
   \[
   B + 16 = 2(S + 16)
   \]

2. Now, the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool:
   \[
   B = 4S
   \]

### Step 4: Solve the equations
We have two equations:
1. \( B + 16 = 2(S + 16) \)
2. \( B = 4S \)

#### Substitute \( B \) from the second equation into the first equation:
\[
4S + 16 = 2(S + 16)
\]

#### Expand and simplify:
\[
4S + 16 = 2S + 32
\]
\[
4S - 2S = 32 - 16
\]
\[
2S = 16
\]
\[
S = 8
\]

### Step 5: Find \( B \)
Now that we have \( S \), we can find \( B \):
\[
B = 4S = 4 \times 8 = 32
\]

### Step 6: Verify the conditions
1. Four minutes ago:
   - Small pool: \( S + 16 = 8 + 16 = 24 \) gallons
   - Big pool: \( B + 16 = 32 + 16 = 48 \) gallons
   - Check: \( 48 = 2 \times 24 \) (True)

2. Now:
   - Small pool: \( S = 8 \) gallons
   - Big pool: \( B = 32 \) gallons
   - Check: \( 32 = 4 \times 8 \) (True)

Both conditions are satisfied.

### Final Answer
The amount of water in the small pool now is:
\[
\boxed{8} \text{ gallons}
\]
