==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine how many months ago Bella and Bob celebrated their 2nd anniversary, given that they will be celebrating their 4th anniversary in 6 months.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Understanding the Timeline:**
   - Bella and Bob will celebrate their 4th anniversary in 6 months. This means that currently, they have been married for 4 years minus 6 months.
   - Since 1 year is equal to 12 months, 4 years is equal to \(4 \times 12 = 48\) months.
   - Therefore, if they will celebrate their 4th anniversary in 6 months, they have currently been married for \(48 - 6 = 42\) months.

2. **Finding the 2nd Anniversary:**
   - The 2nd anniversary marks 2 years of marriage. In months, this is \(2 \times 12 = 24\) months.
   - To find out how many months ago they celebrated their 2nd anniversary, we subtract the number of months at the 2nd anniversary from the current number of months they have been married.

3. **Calculation:**
   - Current duration of marriage: 42 months
   - Duration at 2nd anniversary: 24 months
   - Months since 2nd anniversary: \(42 - 24 = 18\) months

Thus, Bella and Bob celebrated their 2nd anniversary 18 months ago.

**Final Answer:**
Bella and Bob celebrated their 2nd anniversary 18 months ago.
