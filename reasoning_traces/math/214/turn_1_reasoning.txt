==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine how many months ago Bella and Bob celebrated their 2nd anniversary, given that they will celebrate their 4th anniversary in 6 months.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Understanding the Timeline:**
   - Bella and Bob will celebrate their 4th anniversary in 6 months. This means that currently, they have been married for 4 years minus 6 months.
   - 4 years is equivalent to 48 months (since 1 year = 12 months).
   - Therefore, 4 years minus 6 months is \(48 - 6 = 42\) months. This means they have currently been married for 42 months.

2. **Finding the 2nd Anniversary:**
   - The 2nd anniversary would have occurred 2 years after they got married.
   - 2 years is equivalent to 24 months.
   - Therefore, the 2nd anniversary occurred 24 months after they got married.

3. **Calculating the Time Since the 2nd Anniversary:**
   - Since they have currently been married for 42 months, and the 2nd anniversary was at 24 months, we need to find the difference between these two times.
   - The number of months since the 2nd anniversary is \(42 - 24 = 18\) months.

Therefore, Bella and Bob celebrated their 2nd anniversary 18 months ago.

**Final Answer:** 18 months ago.
