To solve this problem, we need to determine the timeline of Bella and Bob's anniversaries and calculate how many months ago their 2nd anniversary occurred.

1. **Current Anniversary Timeline:**
   - Bella and Bob will celebrate their 4th anniversary in 6 months.

2. **Determine the Current Month in Their Anniversary Timeline:**
   - If they will celebrate their 4th anniversary in 6 months, this means they are currently 6 months away from completing 4 years together.
   - Therefore, they are currently at 3 years and 6 months into their relationship.

3. **Calculate the Date of Their 2nd Anniversary:**
   - The 2nd anniversary would have occurred 2 years after they started dating.
   - Since they are currently at 3 years and 6 months, their 2nd anniversary occurred 1 year and 6 months ago (3 years and 6 months - 2 years = 1 year and 6 months).

4. **Convert Years and Months to Just Months:**
   - 1 year is equivalent to 12 months.
   - Therefore, 1 year and 6 months is equivalent to 12 months + 6 months = 18 months.

5. **Final Calculation:**
   - Bella and Bob celebrated their 2nd anniversary 18 months ago.

Thus, the final answer is that Bella and Bob celebrated their 2nd anniversary 18 months ago.
