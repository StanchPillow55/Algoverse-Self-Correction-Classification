==================================================

To determine how many months ago Bella and Bob celebrated their 2nd anniversary, we can follow these steps:

1. **Identify the time frame for the 4th anniversary**: We know that Bella and Bob will be celebrating their 4th anniversary in 6 months. 

2. **Calculate the current time**: Since their 4th anniversary is in 6 months, we can deduce that currently, they are 6 months away from that anniversary. Therefore, we can say that right now, they are in the month that is 6 months before their 4th anniversary.

3. **Determine the date of the 4th anniversary**: If we denote the month of their 4th anniversary as \( T \), then:
   - Current month = \( T - 6 \)

4. **Calculate the date of the 2nd anniversary**: Their 2nd anniversary would have occurred 2 years (or 24 months) before their 4th anniversary. Therefore, the month of their 2nd anniversary can be calculated as:
   - Month of 2nd anniversary = \( T - 24 \)

5. **Calculate the difference in months from now to the 2nd anniversary**: To find out how many months ago they celebrated their 2nd anniversary, we need to calculate the difference between the current month and the month of their 2nd anniversary:
   - Months ago = Current month - Month of 2nd anniversary
   - Months ago = \( (T - 6) - (T - 24) \)

6. **Simplify the expression**:
   \[
   (T - 6) - (T - 24) = T - 6 - T + 24 = 24 - 6 = 18
   \]

Thus, Bella and Bob celebrated their 2nd anniversary 18 months ago.

**Final Answer**: 18 months ago.
