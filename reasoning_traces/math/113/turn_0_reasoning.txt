Question ID: 113
Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to follow the steps outlined in the question carefully, performing calculations at each step.

1. **Determine the number of marbles Baez loses:**

   Baez starts with 25 marbles. She loses 20% of them. To find out how many marbles she loses, we calculate 20% of 25.

   \[
   \text{Marbles lost} = 0.20 \times 25 = 5
   \]

   So, Baez loses 5 marbles.

2. **Calculate the number of marbles Baez has after losing some:**

   After losing 5 marbles, we subtract this from her original total to find out how many she has left.

   \[
   \text{Marbles remaining} = 25 - 5 = 20
   \]

   Baez has 20 marbles after losing some.

3. **Determine how many marbles her friend gives her:**

   Her friend gives her double the amount she has after losing the marbles. Since Baez has 20 marbles at this point, her friend gives her:

   \[
   \text{Marbles given by friend} = 2 \times 20 = 40
   \]

   Her friend gives her 40 marbles.

4. **Calculate the total number of marbles Baez ends up with:**

   Finally, we add the marbles given by her friend to the number of marbles Baez has after losing some.

   \[
   \text{Total marbles Baez ends up with} = 20 + 40 = 60
   \]

Therefore, Baez ends up with 60 marbles.

**Final Answer: 60 marbles**
