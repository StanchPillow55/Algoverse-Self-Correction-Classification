To solve the problem, we will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of marbles Baez loses.**
2. **Determine the number of marbles Baez has after losing some.**
3. **Calculate how many marbles her friend gives her.**
4. **Find the total number of marbles Baez has after receiving the marbles from her friend.**

### Step 1: Calculate the number of marbles Baez loses.

Baez starts with 25 marbles. She loses 20% of them. 

To find 20% of 25, we can use the formula:

\[
\text{Amount lost} = \text{Total marbles} \times \text{Percentage lost}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\text{Amount lost} = 25 \times 0.20 = 5
\]

So, Baez loses 5 marbles.

### Step 2: Determine the number of marbles Baez has after losing some.

Now we subtract the number of marbles lost from the total number of marbles Baez originally had:

\[
\text{Marbles after loss} = \text{Total marbles} - \text{Amount lost}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\text{Marbles after loss} = 25 - 5 = 20
\]

Baez now has 20 marbles.

### Step 3: Calculate how many marbles her friend gives her.

Her friend gives her double the amount that Baez has after losing marbles. Since Baez has 20 marbles now, we calculate:

\[
\text{Marbles given by friend} = 2 \times \text{Marbles after loss}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\text{Marbles given by friend} = 2 \times 20 = 40
\]

So, her friend gives her 40 marbles.

### Step 4: Find the total number of marbles Baez has after receiving the marbles from her friend.

Now we add the marbles Baez has after the loss to the marbles her friend gave her:

\[
\text{Total marbles now} = \text{Marbles after loss} + \text{Marbles given by friend}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\text{Total marbles now} = 20 + 40 = 60
\]

### Final Answer

Baez ends up with **60 marbles**.
