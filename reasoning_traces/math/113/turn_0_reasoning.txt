==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to determine how many flowers Ryan has planted after 15 days and then account for the 5 flowers that did not grow.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of flowers planted.**

Ryan plants 2 flowers each day. Therefore, over 15 days, the total number of flowers he plants can be calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Total flowers planted} = \text{flowers per day} \times \text{number of days}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\text{Total flowers planted} = 2 \text{ flowers/day} \times 15 \text{ days} = 30 \text{ flowers}
\]

**Step 2: Account for the flowers that did not grow.**

Out of the 30 flowers that Ryan planted, we know that 5 flowers did not grow. To find the number of flowers that did grow, we subtract the number of flowers that did not grow from the total number of flowers planted:

\[
\text{Flowers that grew} = \text{Total flowers planted} - \text{flowers that did not grow}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\text{Flowers that grew} = 30 \text{ flowers} - 5 \text{ flowers} = 25 \text{ flowers}
\]

**Final Answer:**

After 15 days, considering that 5 flowers did not grow, Ryan has a total of 25 flowers that grew in his garden.

\[
\boxed{25}
\]
