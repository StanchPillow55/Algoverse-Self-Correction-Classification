==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine the average number of words in each crossword puzzle that Bert completes. We are given the following information:

1. Bert fills out a crossword puzzle every day.
2. He uses up a pencil every two weeks.
3. On average, it takes him 1050 words to use up a pencil.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

### Step 1: Determine the number of days in two weeks
Two weeks consist of:
\[ 2 \text{ weeks} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 14 \text{ days} \]

### Step 2: Determine the total number of crossword puzzles completed in two weeks
Since Bert completes one crossword puzzle per day, in two weeks he completes:
\[ 14 \text{ puzzles} \]

### Step 3: Determine the average number of words per crossword puzzle
We know that Bert uses up a pencil after writing 1050 words, and this happens over the course of completing 14 crossword puzzles. Therefore, the average number of words per puzzle can be calculated by dividing the total number of words by the number of puzzles:

\[ \text{Average words per puzzle} = \frac{1050 \text{ words}}{14 \text{ puzzles}} \]

### Step 4: Perform the division
Now, let's calculate the division:
\[ \frac{1050}{14} = 75 \]

### Conclusion
The average number of words in each crossword puzzle is 75.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[ \boxed{75} \]
