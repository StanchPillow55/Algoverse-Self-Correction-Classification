==================================================

To find out how many words are in each crossword puzzle on average, we need to break down the information given in the problem step by step.

1. **Understanding the time frame**: Bert uses up a pencil every two weeks. Since there are 14 days in two weeks, we can say that he uses one pencil every 14 days.

2. **Total words used per pencil**: We know that Bert uses up a pencil after filling out a total of 1050 words. This means that in 14 days, he fills out 1050 words.

3. **Calculating daily word usage**: To find out how many words Bert fills out per day, we divide the total number of words by the number of days:
   \[
   \text{Words per day} = \frac{1050 \text{ words}}{14 \text{ days}} = 75 \text{ words per day}
   \]

4. **Determining the number of crossword puzzles**: Next, we need to determine how many crossword puzzles Bert completes in those 14 days. However, the problem does not specify how many puzzles he completes in that time frame. For the sake of this problem, we will assume that Bert completes one crossword puzzle each day.

5. **Calculating the average number of words per crossword puzzle**: If Bert completes one crossword puzzle each day, and he fills out 75 words per day, then the average number of words in each crossword puzzle is simply:
   \[
   \text{Average words per crossword puzzle} = 75 \text{ words}
   \]

Thus, the final answer is that on average, there are **75 words in each crossword puzzle**.
