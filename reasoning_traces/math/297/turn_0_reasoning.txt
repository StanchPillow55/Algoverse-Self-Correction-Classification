To determine how many crates Sam was off from his target for the week, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Identify the target**: Sam's target for the week is to sell 120 crates of bread.

2. **Calculate the total sales for the week**: We will add up the number of crates Sam sold each day he was open.

   - **Weekend sales**: Sam sold 20 crates.
   - **Tuesday sales**: Sam sold 15 crates.
   - **Wednesday sales**: Sam sold 12 crates.
   - **Thursday sales**: Sam sold 18 crates.

   Now, let's sum these amounts:

   \[
   \text{Total sales} = \text{Weekend sales} + \text{Tuesday sales} + \text{Wednesday sales} + \text{Thursday sales}
   \]

   Plugging in the numbers:

   \[
   \text{Total sales} = 20 + 15 + 12 + 18
   \]

   Now, we perform the addition step-by-step:

   - First, add the weekend and Tuesday sales:
     \[
     20 + 15 = 35
     \]
   - Next, add Wednesday's sales:
     \[
     35 + 12 = 47
     \]
   - Finally, add Thursday's sales:
     \[
     47 + 18 = 65
     \]

   So, the total number of crates Sam sold during the week is **65 crates**.

3. **Determine how many crates Sam was off from his target**: To find out how many crates he was off from his target, we subtract the total sales from the target:

   \[
   \text{Crates off from target} = \text{Target} - \text{Total sales}
   \]

   Plugging in the numbers:

   \[
   \text{Crates off from target} = 120 - 65
   \]

   Performing the subtraction:

   \[
   120 - 65 = 55
   \]

Thus, Sam was off from his target by **55 crates**.

**Final Answer**: Sam was off from his target by 55 crates.
