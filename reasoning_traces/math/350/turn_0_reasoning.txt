To solve the problem of determining how many more rolls of wrapping paper Chandler needs to sell, we can follow these steps:

1. **Identify the total number of rolls Chandler needs to sell.**
   - Chandler needs to sell a total of 12 rolls of wrapping paper.

2. **Calculate the total number of rolls Chandler has already sold.**
   - Chandler has sold 3 rolls to his grandmother.
   - Chandler has sold 4 rolls to his uncle.
   - Chandler has sold 3 rolls to a neighbor.

3. **Add the rolls sold to find the total number sold so far.**
   \[
   \text{Total rolls sold} = 3 (\text{grandmother}) + 4 (\text{uncle}) + 3 (\text{neighbor})
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total rolls sold} = 3 + 4 + 3 = 10
   \]

4. **Determine how many more rolls Chandler needs to sell.**
   - Subtract the total number of rolls sold from the total number of rolls Chandler needs to sell.
   \[
   \text{Rolls remaining to sell} = 12 (\text{total needed}) - 10 (\text{total sold})
   \]
   \[
   \text{Rolls remaining to sell} = 2
   \]

Therefore, Chandler needs to sell 2 more rolls of wrapping paper.

**Final Answer:**
Chandler needs to sell 2 more rolls of wrapping paper.
