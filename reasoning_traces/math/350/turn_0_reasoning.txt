==================================================

To determine how many more rolls of wrapping paper Chandler needs to sell, we can follow these steps:

1. **Identify the total number of rolls Chandler needs to sell**: 
   - Chandler needs to sell a total of **12 rolls** of wrapping paper.

2. **Calculate the total number of rolls Chandler has already sold**:
   - He has sold:
     - 3 rolls to his grandmother
     - 4 rolls to his uncle
     - 3 rolls to a neighbor

   We can add these amounts together to find out how many rolls he has sold so far:

   \[
   \text{Total sold} = 3 + 4 + 3
   \]

   Performing the addition:

   \[
   3 + 4 = 7
   \]
   \[
   7 + 3 = 10
   \]

   So, Chandler has sold a total of **10 rolls** of wrapping paper.

3. **Calculate how many more rolls Chandler needs to sell**:
   - To find out how many more rolls he needs to sell, we subtract the number of rolls he has sold from the total number of rolls he needs to sell:

   \[
   \text{More rolls needed} = \text{Total needed} - \text{Total sold}
   \]
   \[
   \text{More rolls needed} = 12 - 10
   \]

   Performing the subtraction:

   \[
   12 - 10 = 2
   \]

4. **Final answer**:
   - Therefore, Chandler needs to sell **2 more rolls** of wrapping paper.

In conclusion, the final answer is that Chandler needs to sell **2 more rolls** of wrapping paper.
