To solve this problem, we need to track the weight of Bert's golden retriever as it grows, based on the information given. Let's go through the steps one by one:

1. **Initial Weight at 7 Weeks:**
   - At 7 weeks old, the puppy weighed 6 pounds.

2. **Weight at 9 Weeks:**
   - The puppy doubled its weight by week 9.
   - Weight at 9 weeks = 2 × 6 pounds = 12 pounds.

3. **Weight at 3 Months:**
   - The puppy doubled its weight again at 3 months old.
   - Note: 3 months is approximately 12 weeks.
   - Weight at 3 months = 2 × 12 pounds = 24 pounds.

4. **Weight at 5 Months:**
   - The puppy doubled its weight again at 5 months old.
   - Weight at 5 months = 2 × 24 pounds = 48 pounds.

5. **Final Adult Weight at 1 Year:**
   - By the time the dog was one year old, it added another 30 pounds to its weight at 5 months.
   - Final adult weight = 48 pounds + 30 pounds = 78 pounds.

Therefore, the dog's full adult weight is 78 pounds.

**Final Answer: 78 pounds**
