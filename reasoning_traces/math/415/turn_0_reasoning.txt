To determine the full adult weight of Bert's golden retriever, we will track the dog's weight at various stages of its growth.

1. **Initial Weight at 7 Weeks Old:**
   - The puppy weighs 6 pounds.

2. **Weight at 9 Weeks Old:**
   - The puppy doubles its weight from 7 weeks to 9 weeks.
   \[
   \text{Weight at 9 weeks} = 6 \text{ pounds} \times 2 = 12 \text{ pounds}
   \]

3. **Weight at 3 Months Old:**
   - The puppy doubles its weight again at 3 months (which is approximately 12 weeks).
   \[
   \text{Weight at 3 months} = 12 \text{ pounds} \times 2 = 24 \text{ pounds}
   \]

4. **Weight at 5 Months Old:**
   - The puppy doubles its weight again at 5 months (which is approximately 20 weeks).
   \[
   \text{Weight at 5 months} = 24 \text{ pounds} \times 2 = 48 \text{ pounds}
   \]

5. **Final Weight at 1 Year Old:**
   - The dog adds another 30 pounds to its weight by the time it is one year old.
   \[
   \text{Final adult weight} = 48 \text{ pounds} + 30 \text{ pounds} = 78 \text{ pounds}
   \]

Now, we can summarize the calculations:
- Weight at 7 weeks: 6 pounds
- Weight at 9 weeks: 12 pounds
- Weight at 3 months: 24 pounds
- Weight at 5 months: 48 pounds
- Final adult weight at 1 year: 78 pounds

Thus, the dog's full adult weight is:
\[
\boxed{78} \text{ pounds}
\]
