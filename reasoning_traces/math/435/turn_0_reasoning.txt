To solve this problem, we need to determine how much more money Maria needs to earn to buy the bike, given the contributions from her savings and her mother.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the total cost of the bike:**
   - The retail price of the bike is $600.

2. **Determine how much money Maria has already saved:**
   - Maria has saved $120.

3. **Calculate the amount her mother is contributing:**
   - Her mother is giving her $250.

4. **Calculate the total amount of money Maria currently has, including her savings and her mother's contribution:**
   - Total money available = Maria's savings + Mother's contribution
   - Total money available = $120 + $250
   - Total money available = $370

5. **Determine how much more money Maria needs to buy the bike:**
   - Amount needed = Total cost of the bike - Total money available
   - Amount needed = $600 - $370
   - Amount needed = $230

Therefore, Maria must earn $230 to be able to buy the bike.

**Final Answer:**
Maria must earn $230.
