Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we will follow these steps:

1. **Determine how many lollipops Ray shared.**
   - Ray started with 25 lollipops.
   - He kept 5 lollipops for himself.
   - To find out how many lollipops he shared, we subtract the number of lollipops he kept from the total number he had:
     \[
     \text{Lollipops shared} = \text{Total lollipops} - \text{Lollipops kept}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Lollipops shared} = 25 - 5 = 20
     \]

2. **Determine how many friends Ray shared the lollipops with.**
   - Ray has 4 friends.

3. **Calculate how many lollipops each friend received.**
   - Since Ray shared the 20 lollipops equally among his 4 friends, we divide the total number of lollipops shared by the number of friends:
     \[
     \text{Lollipops per friend} = \frac{\text{Lollipops shared}}{\text{Number of friends}}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Lollipops per friend} = \frac{20}{4} = 5
     \]

4. **State the final answer.**
   - Each of Ray's friends received 5 lollipops.

Thus, the final answer is that each of Ray's friends received **5 lollipops**.
