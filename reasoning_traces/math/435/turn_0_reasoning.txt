==================================================

To determine how much money Maria needs to earn in order to buy the bike, we can follow these steps:

1. **Identify the total cost of the bike**: The retail price of the bike is given as $600.

2. **Determine how much money Maria has saved**: Maria has saved $120.

3. **Calculate the remaining amount needed after her savings**:
   \[
   \text{Remaining amount needed} = \text{Total cost} - \text{Amount saved}
   \]
   Substituting the values:
   \[
   \text{Remaining amount needed} = 600 - 120 = 480
   \]

4. **Identify how much her mother is willing to give her**: Maria's mother offers her $250.

5. **Calculate how much more Maria needs to earn after her mother's contribution**:
   \[
   \text{Amount still needed} = \text{Remaining amount needed} - \text{Amount from mother}
   \]
   Substituting the values:
   \[
   \text{Amount still needed} = 480 - 250 = 230
   \]

6. **Conclusion**: Maria must earn $230 to be able to buy the bike.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{230}
\]
