==================================================

To solve the problem, we first need to understand what "Sample reasoning question 377" refers to. Since the problem statement is not specific, I'll assume it's a placeholder for a typical math problem. Without specific details, I'll create a hypothetical math problem and solve it step-by-step.

Let's assume the problem is as follows:

**Problem:**  
A company produces two types of widgets: Type A and Type B. The company sells Type A widgets for $50 each and Type B widgets for $70 each. The production cost for Type A is $30 per widget, and for Type B, it is $40 per widget. Last month, the company sold a total of 500 widgets and made a profit of $15,000. How many of each type of widget did the company sell?

**Solution:**

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( x \) be the number of Type A widgets sold.
   - Let \( y \) be the number of Type B widgets sold.

2. **Set Up Equations:**
   - Total widgets sold:  
     \[
     x + y = 500
     \]
   - Profit equation:  
     The profit from selling Type A widgets is \( (50 - 30)x = 20x \).  
     The profit from selling Type B widgets is \( (70 - 40)y = 30y \).  
     Total profit is given as $15,000, so:  
     \[
     20x + 30y = 15,000
     \]

3. **Solve the System of Equations:**

   We have the following system of equations:
   \[
   \begin{align*}
   x + y &= 500 \quad \text{(Equation 1)} \\
   20x + 30y &= 15,000 \quad \text{(Equation 2)}
   \end{align*}
   \]

   From Equation 1, express \( y \) in terms of \( x \):
   \[
   y = 500 - x
   \]

   Substitute \( y = 500 - x \) into Equation 2:
   \[
   20x + 30(500 - x) = 15,000
   \]

   Simplify and solve for \( x \):
   \[
   20x + 15,000 - 30x = 15,000
   \]
   \[
   -10x + 15,000 = 15,000
   \]
   \[
   -10x = 0
   \]
   \[
   x = 0
   \]

   Substitute \( x = 0 \) back into Equation 1 to find \( y \):
   \[
   0 + y = 500
   \]
   \[
   y = 500
   \]

4. **Conclusion:**
   The company sold 0 Type A widgets and 500 Type B widgets.

**Final Answer:**
The company sold 0 Type A widgets and 500 Type B widgets.
