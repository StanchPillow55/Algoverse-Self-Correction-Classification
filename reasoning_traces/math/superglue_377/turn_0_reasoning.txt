To solve the problem, I need to understand what "Sample reasoning question 377" refers to. Since this doesn't provide specific details about the problem, I'll create a sample math reasoning problem and solve it step-by-step.

**Sample Problem:**

A farmer has a rectangular field that is 100 meters long and 60 meters wide. He wants to divide the field into two equal parts by building a fence parallel to the shorter side. How long will the fence be?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We have a rectangular field with dimensions 100 meters (length) and 60 meters (width).
   - The field needs to be divided into two equal parts by a fence parallel to the shorter side (width).

2. **Visualize the Problem:**
   - Imagine the rectangle with the longer side (100 meters) as the base.
   - The shorter side (60 meters) is the width.
   - The fence will be parallel to the 60-meter side, dividing the field into two equal areas.

3. **Calculate the Area of the Field:**
   - The area of the rectangle is given by the formula:
     \[
     \text{Area} = \text{Length} \times \text{Width} = 100 \, \text{m} \times 60 \, \text{m} = 6000 \, \text{square meters}
     \]

4. **Determine the Area of Each Part:**
   - Since the field is divided into two equal parts, each part will have an area of:
     \[
     \text{Area of each part} = \frac{6000 \, \text{square meters}}{2} = 3000 \, \text{square meters}
     \]

5. **Determine the Dimensions of Each Part:**
   - Each part will still have a width of 60 meters (since the fence is parallel to the width).
   - Let \( x \) be the length of each part.
   - The area of each part is given by:
     \[
     x \times 60 = 3000
     \]

6. **Solve for \( x \):**
   - Divide both sides by 60 to find \( x \):
     \[
     x = \frac{3000}{60} = 50 \, \text{meters}
     \]

7. **Conclusion:**
   - The length of the fence, which is parallel to the 60-meter side, will be 50 meters.

**Final Answer:**
The length of the fence will be 50 meters.
