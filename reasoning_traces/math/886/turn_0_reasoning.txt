==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to determine how many pairs of microphones the singer can arrange on the stage given that 20% of the microphones will not find any space to fit in.

1. **Calculate the number of microphones that won't fit:**
   The singer has a total of 50 microphones. According to the problem, 20% of these microphones will not find any space to fit in.

   To find 20% of 50, we can use the formula:
   \[
   \text{Number of microphones that won't fit} = 0.20 \times 50
   \]

   Calculating this:
   \[
   0.20 \times 50 = 10
   \]

   So, 10 microphones will not find any space to fit in.

2. **Calculate the number of microphones that can be arranged:**
   Since 10 microphones won't fit, we subtract this number from the total number of microphones to find out how many can be arranged:
   \[
   \text{Number of microphones that can be arranged} = 50 - 10 = 40
   \]

3. **Determine how many pairs can be formed:**
   Since the microphones are to be arranged in pairs, we divide the number of microphones that can be arranged by 2:
   \[
   \text{Number of pairs} = \frac{\text{Number of microphones that can be arranged}}{2} = \frac{40}{2}
   \]

   Calculating this gives:
   \[
   \frac{40}{2} = 20
   \]

Thus, the singer was able to arrange **20 pairs of microphones** on the stage.

**Final Answer: 20 pairs**
