==================================================

To solve "Sample math problem 188," I need to know the specific details of the problem. Since the problem itself isn't provided, I'll demonstrate how to solve a general math problem step-by-step. Let's assume a sample problem:

**Problem:** Solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 3x + 5 = 20 \).

**Step 1: Understand the Problem**
The equation given is a linear equation in one variable. Our goal is to find the value of \( x \) that makes the equation true.

**Step 2: Isolate the Variable**
To solve for \( x \), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We start by eliminating the constant term on the side with the variable.

**Step 3: Subtract 5 from Both Sides**
Subtract 5 from both sides of the equation to remove the constant term from the left side:
\[
3x + 5 - 5 = 20 - 5
\]
\[
3x = 15
\]

**Step 4: Divide by the Coefficient of \( x \)**
The next step is to divide both sides by the coefficient of \( x \), which is 3, to solve for \( x \):
\[
\frac{3x}{3} = \frac{15}{3}
\]
\[
x = 5
\]

**Step 5: Verify the Solution**
Substitute \( x = 5 \) back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies the equation:
\[
3(5) + 5 = 20
\]
\[
15 + 5 = 20
\]
\[
20 = 20
\]
The left-hand side equals the right-hand side, confirming that \( x = 5 \) is the correct solution.

**Final Answer:**
The solution to the equation \( 3x + 5 = 20 \) is \( x = 5 \).
