To solve this problem, we need to determine how many pages Sabrina has left to read in the series after two months, and then calculate the total number of pages she will read to finish the entire series.

1. **Determine the total number of books and pages in the series:**
   - There are 14 books in the series.
   - Each book has 200 pages.
   - Therefore, the total number of pages in the series is:
     \[
     14 \text{ books} \times 200 \text{ pages/book} = 2800 \text{ pages}
     \]

2. **Calculate the number of books Sabrina reads in the first month:**
   - Sabrina reads 4 books in the first month.

3. **Calculate the number of books remaining after the first month:**
   - Initially, there are 14 books.
   - After reading 4 books, the number of books remaining is:
     \[
     14 \text{ books} - 4 \text{ books} = 10 \text{ books}
     \]

4. **Calculate the number of books Sabrina reads in the second month:**
   - In the second month, Sabrina reads half the number of books remaining.
   - Half of the remaining 10 books is:
     \[
     \frac{10 \text{ books}}{2} = 5 \text{ books}
     \]

5. **Calculate the total number of books Sabrina reads in two months:**
   - In the first month, she reads 4 books.
   - In the second month, she reads 5 books.
   - Therefore, the total number of books read in two months is:
     \[
     4 \text{ books} + 5 \text{ books} = 9 \text{ books}
     \]

6. **Calculate the number of books remaining after two months:**
   - Initially, there are 14 books.
   - After reading 9 books in two months, the number of books remaining is:
     \[
     14 \text{ books} - 9 \text{ books} = 5 \text{ books}
     \]

7. **Calculate the number of pages Sabrina has left to read:**
   - Each book has 200 pages.
   - Therefore, the number of pages remaining is:
     \[
     5 \text{ books} \times 200 \text{ pages/book} = 1000 \text{ pages}
     \]

8. **Calculate the total number of pages Sabrina reads to finish the series:**
   - She reads 9 books in two months, which is:
     \[
     9 \text{ books} \times 200 \text{ pages/book} = 1800 \text{ pages}
     \]
   - Plus the remaining 5 books, which is:
     \[
     5 \text{ books} \times 200 \text{ pages/book} = 1000 \text{ pages}
     \]
   - Therefore, the total number of pages she reads to finish the series is:
     \[
     1800 \text{ pages} + 1000 \text{ pages} = 2800 \text{ pages}
     \]

Thus, the total number of pages Sabrina has to read to finish the whole series is \(\boxed{2800}\) pages.
