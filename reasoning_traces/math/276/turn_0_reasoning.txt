To determine the total number of pages Sabrina has to read to finish the entire series of "The Rangers Apprentice," we will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of books in the series**: 
   The problem states that there are 14 books in the series.

2. **Calculate the total number of pages in the series**: 
   Each book has 200 pages. Therefore, the total number of pages in the series can be calculated as follows:
   \[
   \text{Total pages} = \text{Number of books} \times \text{Pages per book} = 14 \times 200 = 2800 \text{ pages}
   \]

3. **Determine how many books Sabrina has read**:
   - In the first month, Sabrina read 4 books.
   - In the second month, she read half the number of books remaining. 
   - After reading 4 books, the number of books remaining is:
   \[
   \text{Remaining books} = \text{Total books} - \text{Books read in first month} = 14 - 4 = 10 \text{ books}
   \]
   - Half of the remaining books is:
   \[
   \text{Books read in second month} = \frac{10}{2} = 5 \text{ books}
   \]

4. **Calculate the total number of books read**:
   - Total books read after two months:
   \[
   \text{Total books read} = \text{Books read in first month} + \text{Books read in second month} = 4 + 5 = 9 \text{ books}
   \]

5. **Calculate the total number of pages read**:
   - The total number of pages Sabrina has read can be calculated as:
   \[
   \text{Total pages read} = \text{Total books read} \times \text{Pages per book} = 9 \times 200 = 1800 \text{ pages}
   \]

6. **Calculate the total number of pages remaining**:
   - To find out how many pages she still has to read, we subtract the pages she has read from the total pages in the series:
   \[
   \text{Pages remaining} = \text{Total pages} - \text{Total pages read} = 2800 - 1800 = 1000 \text{ pages}
   \]

Thus, the total number of pages Sabrina has to read to finish the whole series is:

\[
\boxed{1000}
\]
