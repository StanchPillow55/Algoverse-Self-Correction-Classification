To solve this problem, we need to determine how many pages Sabrina has left to read in the series after two months, and then calculate the total number of pages she will read to finish the entire series.

### Step 1: Determine the total number of books and pages in the series.

The series consists of 14 books, and each book has 200 pages. Therefore, the total number of pages in the series is calculated as follows:

\[
14 \text{ books} \times 200 \text{ pages/book} = 2800 \text{ pages}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the number of books Sabrina reads in the first month.

Sabrina reads 4 books in the first month. Therefore, the number of books she has read by the end of the first month is 4.

### Step 3: Determine the number of books remaining after the first month.

Initially, there are 14 books. After reading 4 books, the number of books remaining is:

\[
14 \text{ books} - 4 \text{ books} = 10 \text{ books}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the number of books Sabrina reads in the second month.

In the second month, Sabrina reads half the number of books remaining. We calculated that there are 10 books remaining after the first month. Therefore, the number of books she reads in the second month is:

\[
\frac{10 \text{ books}}{2} = 5 \text{ books}
\]

### Step 5: Determine the total number of books Sabrina has read after two months.

By the end of the second month, Sabrina has read:

\[
4 \text{ books (first month)} + 5 \text{ books (second month)} = 9 \text{ books}
\]

### Step 6: Calculate the number of books remaining after two months.

The total number of books in the series is 14. After reading 9 books, the number of books remaining is:

\[
14 \text{ books} - 9 \text{ books} = 5 \text{ books}
\]

### Step 7: Calculate the total number of pages Sabrina has read.

Sabrina has read 9 books, and each book has 200 pages. Therefore, the total number of pages she has read is:

\[
9 \text{ books} \times 200 \text{ pages/book} = 1800 \text{ pages}
\]

### Step 8: Calculate the total number of pages Sabrina has left to read.

The total number of pages in the series is 2800. The number of pages Sabrina has read is 1800. Therefore, the number of pages she has left to read is:

\[
2800 \text{ pages} - 1800 \text{ pages} = 1000 \text{ pages}
\]

### Final Answer:

Sabrina has 1000 pages left to read to finish the whole series.
