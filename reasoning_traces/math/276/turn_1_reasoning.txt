==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine how many pages Sabrina has left to read in the series after two months, and then calculate the total number of pages she will read to finish the series.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Total Number of Books in the Series:**
   The series has a total of 14 books.

2. **Pages per Book:**
   Each book has 200 pages.

3. **Total Pages in the Series:**
   To find the total number of pages in the entire series, we multiply the number of books by the number of pages per book:
   \[
   14 \text{ books} \times 200 \text{ pages/book} = 2800 \text{ pages}
   \]

4. **Books Read in the First Month:**
   Sabrina read 4 books in the first month.

5. **Books Remaining After the First Month:**
   After reading 4 books, the number of books remaining is:
   \[
   14 \text{ books} - 4 \text{ books} = 10 \text{ books}
   \]

6. **Books Read in the Second Month:**
   In the second month, Sabrina reads half of the remaining books. She has 10 books remaining, so she reads:
   \[
   \frac{10 \text{ books}}{2} = 5 \text{ books}
   \]

7. **Books Remaining After the Second Month:**
   After reading 5 more books in the second month, the number of books remaining is:
   \[
   10 \text{ books} - 5 \text{ books} = 5 \text{ books}
   \]

8. **Total Books Read:**
   The total number of books Sabrina has read after two months is:
   \[
   4 \text{ books (first month)} + 5 \text{ books (second month)} = 9 \text{ books}
   \]

9. **Pages Read So Far:**
   The total number of pages Sabrina has read in the first two months is:
   \[
   9 \text{ books} \times 200 \text{ pages/book} = 1800 \text{ pages}
   \]

10. **Pages Remaining to Finish the Series:**
    The number of pages remaining for Sabrina to read to finish the series is:
    \[
    2800 \text{ pages (total)} - 1800 \text{ pages (read)} = 1000 \text{ pages}
    \]

Therefore, the total number of pages Sabrina has to read to finish the whole series is 1000 pages.

**Final Answer:**
Sabrina has to read 1000 more pages to finish the whole series.
