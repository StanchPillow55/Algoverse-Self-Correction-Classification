==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine how many pages Sabrina has left to read in the series after two months, and then calculate the total number of pages she will read to finish the series.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Determine the Total Number of Books and Pages:**
   - There are 14 books in the series.
   - Each book has 200 pages.
   - Total pages in the series = 14 books × 200 pages/book = 2800 pages.

2. **Calculate the Number of Books Read in the First Month:**
   - Sabrina read 4 books in the first month.

3. **Calculate the Number of Books Remaining After the First Month:**
   - Total books = 14
   - Books read in the first month = 4
   - Books remaining after the first month = 14 - 4 = 10 books

4. **Calculate the Number of Books Read in the Second Month:**
   - Sabrina reads half the number of books remaining in the second month.
   - Books remaining after the first month = 10
   - Half of 10 books = 10 / 2 = 5 books
   - Books read in the second month = 5

5. **Calculate the Total Number of Books Read After Two Months:**
   - Books read in the first month = 4
   - Books read in the second month = 5
   - Total books read after two months = 4 + 5 = 9 books

6. **Calculate the Number of Books Remaining After Two Months:**
   - Total books = 14
   - Total books read after two months = 9
   - Books remaining = 14 - 9 = 5 books

7. **Calculate the Total Number of Pages Sabrina Has to Read to Finish the Series:**
   - Books remaining = 5
   - Pages per book = 200
   - Total pages remaining = 5 books × 200 pages/book = 1000 pages

### Final Answer:
Sabrina has to read 1000 pages to finish the whole series.
