Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To find the average percentage by which the cranes are taller than the buildings they are finishing, we will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the height difference for each crane and building pair.**
2. **Calculate the percentage taller for each crane.**
3. **Find the average of these percentages.**

### Step 1: Calculate the height difference

- For the first crane:
  - Crane height = 228 feet
  - Building height = 200 feet
  - Height difference = 228 - 200 = 28 feet

- For the second crane:
  - Crane height = 120 feet
  - Building height = 100 feet
  - Height difference = 120 - 100 = 20 feet

- For the third crane:
  - Crane height = 147 feet
  - Building height = 140 feet
  - Height difference = 147 - 140 = 7 feet

### Step 2: Calculate the percentage taller for each crane

The formula to calculate the percentage taller is:
\[
\text{Percentage taller} = \left( \frac{\text{Height difference}}{\text{Building height}} \right) \times 100
\]

- For the first crane:
  \[
  \text{Percentage taller} = \left( \frac{28}{200} \right) \times 100 = 14\%
  \]

- For the second crane:
  \[
  \text{Percentage taller} = \left( \frac{20}{100} \right) \times 100 = 20\%
  \]

- For the third crane:
  \[
  \text{Percentage taller} = \left( \frac{7}{140} \right) \times 100 = 5\%
  \]

### Step 3: Find the average of these percentages

Now we will calculate the average of the percentages:
\[
\text{Average percentage} = \frac{14 + 20 + 5}{3} = \frac{39}{3} = 13\%
\]

### Final Answer

The average percentage by which the cranes are taller than the buildings is **13%**.
