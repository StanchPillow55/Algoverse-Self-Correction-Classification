Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine how much taller each crane is compared to the building it is working on, and then find the average percentage by which the cranes are taller than the buildings.

### Step-by-Step Calculation:

1. **Calculate the height difference for each crane and building pair:**

   - **First Crane:**
     - Crane height = 228 feet
     - Building height = 200 feet
     - Height difference = 228 - 200 = 28 feet

   - **Second Crane:**
     - Crane height = 120 feet
     - Building height = 100 feet
     - Height difference = 120 - 100 = 20 feet

   - **Third Crane:**
     - Crane height = 147 feet
     - Building height = 140 feet
     - Height difference = 147 - 140 = 7 feet

2. **Calculate the percentage taller for each crane:**

   - **First Crane:**
     \[
     \text{Percentage taller} = \left(\frac{28}{200}\right) \times 100 = 14\%
     \]

   - **Second Crane:**
     \[
     \text{Percentage taller} = \left(\frac{20}{100}\right) \times 100 = 20\%
     \]

   - **Third Crane:**
     \[
     \text{Percentage taller} = \left(\frac{7}{140}\right) \times 100 = 5\%
     \]

3. **Calculate the average percentage taller:**

   - Add the percentages: \(14\% + 20\% + 5\% = 39\%\)
   - Divide by the number of cranes: \(\frac{39\%}{3} = 13\%\)

### Final Answer:

On average, the cranes are 13% taller than the buildings they are working on.
