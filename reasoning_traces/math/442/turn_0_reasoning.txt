To find the final temperature of Marcus's house after he bakes and then opens a window, we will break the problem down into several steps.

### Step 1: Initial Temperature
The initial temperature of the house is given as:
\[
\text{Initial Temperature} = 40 \text{ degrees}
\]

### Step 2: Temperature Increase from Baking
Marcus spends 3 hours baking, and the oven raises the house's temperature by 5 degrees for each hour it is on. We can calculate the total increase in temperature from baking as follows:

\[
\text{Temperature Increase} = \text{Hours Baking} \times \text{Increase per Hour}
\]
\[
\text{Temperature Increase} = 3 \text{ hours} \times 5 \text{ degrees/hour} = 15 \text{ degrees}
\]

Now, we add this increase to the initial temperature:
\[
\text{Temperature after Baking} = \text{Initial Temperature} + \text{Temperature Increase}
\]
\[
\text{Temperature after Baking} = 40 \text{ degrees} + 15 \text{ degrees} = 55 \text{ degrees}
\]

### Step 3: Temperature Decrease from Opening the Window
Next, Marcus opens a window for 30 minutes. The house cools down by 2 degrees for every 10 minutes the window is open. We first determine how many 10-minute intervals are in 30 minutes:

\[
\text{Number of 10-minute intervals} = \frac{30 \text{ minutes}}{10 \text{ minutes/interval}} = 3 \text{ intervals}
\]

Now, we can calculate the total decrease in temperature from opening the window:
\[
\text{Temperature Decrease} = \text{Number of Intervals} \times \text{Decrease per Interval}
\]
\[
\text{Temperature Decrease} = 3 \text{ intervals} \times 2 \text{ degrees/interval} = 6 \text{ degrees}
\]

### Step 4: Final Temperature Calculation
Now, we subtract the temperature decrease from the temperature after baking:
\[
\text{Final Temperature} = \text{Temperature after Baking} - \text{Temperature Decrease}
\]
\[
\text{Final Temperature} = 55 \text{ degrees} - 6 \text{ degrees} = 49 \text{ degrees}
\]

### Conclusion
The final temperature of Marcus's house after baking and opening the window is:
\[
\boxed{49 \text{ degrees}}
\]
