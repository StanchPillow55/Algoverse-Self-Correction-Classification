To find the average percentage by which the cranes are taller than the buildings they are finishing, we will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the height difference between each crane and its corresponding building.**
2. **Calculate the percentage difference for each crane.**
3. **Find the average of these percentages.**

### Step 1: Calculate the height difference

For each crane, we subtract the height of the building from the height of the crane.

1. **Crane 1:**
   - Height of crane: 228 feet
   - Height of building: 200 feet
   - Height difference: \( 228 - 200 = 28 \) feet

2. **Crane 2:**
   - Height of crane: 120 feet
   - Height of building: 100 feet
   - Height difference: \( 120 - 100 = 20 \) feet

3. **Crane 3:**
   - Height of crane: 147 feet
   - Height of building: 140 feet
   - Height difference: \( 147 - 140 = 7 \) feet

### Step 2: Calculate the percentage difference for each crane

The percentage difference is calculated using the formula:

\[
\text{Percentage Difference} = \left( \frac{\text{Height Difference}}{\text{Height of Building}} \right) \times 100
\]

1. **Crane 1:**
   \[
   \text{Percentage Difference} = \left( \frac{28}{200} \right) \times 100 = 14\%
   \]

2. **Crane 2:**
   \[
   \text{Percentage Difference} = \left( \frac{20}{100} \right) \times 100 = 20\%
   \]

3. **Crane 3:**
   \[
   \text{Percentage Difference} = \left( \frac{7}{140} \right) \times 100 = 5\%
   \]

### Step 3: Find the average of these percentages

Now, we will calculate the average of the three percentages:

\[
\text{Average Percentage} = \frac{14 + 20 + 5}{3}
\]

Calculating the sum:

\[
14 + 20 + 5 = 39
\]

Now, divide by 3:

\[
\text{Average Percentage} = \frac{39}{3} = 13\%
\]

### Final Answer

The average percentage by which the cranes are taller than the buildings is **13%**.
