To solve this problem, we need to determine how much taller each crane is compared to the building it is finishing, and then find the average percentage by which the cranes are taller than the buildings.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Calculate the height difference for each crane and building pair:**

   - **First pair:** 
     - Crane height = 228 feet
     - Building height = 200 feet
     - Height difference = 228 - 200 = 28 feet

   - **Second pair:**
     - Crane height = 120 feet
     - Building height = 100 feet
     - Height difference = 120 - 100 = 20 feet

   - **Third pair:**
     - Crane height = 147 feet
     - Building height = 140 feet
     - Height difference = 147 - 140 = 7 feet

2. **Calculate the percentage taller for each crane compared to the building:**

   The percentage taller is calculated using the formula:
   \[
   \text{Percentage taller} = \left(\frac{\text{Height difference}}{\text{Building height}}\right) \times 100
   \]

   - **First pair:**
     \[
     \text{Percentage taller} = \left(\frac{28}{200}\right) \times 100 = 14\%
     \]

   - **Second pair:**
     \[
     \text{Percentage taller} = \left(\frac{20}{100}\right) \times 100 = 20\%
     \]

   - **Third pair:**
     \[
     \text{Percentage taller} = \left(\frac{7}{140}\right) \times 100 = 5\%
     \]

3. **Calculate the average percentage taller:**

   To find the average percentage taller, we sum the percentages and divide by the number of pairs:
   \[
   \text{Average percentage taller} = \frac{14\% + 20\% + 5\%}{3}
   \]

   \[
   \text{Average percentage taller} = \frac{39\%}{3} = 13\%
   \]

Therefore, on average, the cranes are 13% taller than the buildings they are finishing.

**Final Answer:**
On average, the cranes are 13% taller than the buildings.
