==================================================

Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial Withdrawal**:
   Thomas withdraws $1000 in $20 bills. To find out how many $20 bills he has, we divide the total amount by the value of each bill:
   \[
   \text{Number of $20 bills} = \frac{1000}{20} = 50
   \]
   So, Thomas initially has 50 $20 bills.

2. **Losing Bills**:
   Thomas loses 10 bills on his way home. We need to subtract the lost bills from the initial number of bills:
   \[
   \text{Remaining bills} = 50 - 10 = 40
   \]
   Now, Thomas has 40 $20 bills.

3. **Paying a Bill**:
   Thomas uses half of the remaining bills to pay for a bill. First, we calculate half of the remaining bills:
   \[
   \text{Half of remaining bills} = \frac{40}{2} = 20
   \]
   After paying, the number of bills left is:
   \[
   \text{Remaining bills after payment} = 40 - 20 = 20
   \]
   So, Thomas now has 20 $20 bills.

4. **Tripling His Money**:
   Now, Thomas triples his money. The total value of the remaining $20 bills is:
   \[
   \text{Value of remaining bills} = 20 \times 20 = 400
   \]
   Tripling this amount gives:
   \[
   \text{Tripled amount} = 3 \times 400 = 1200
   \]

5. **Converting to $5 Bills**:
   Finally, we need to convert the total amount of $1200 into $5 bills. To find out how many $5 bills this amount corresponds to, we divide the total amount by the value of each $5 bill:
   \[
   \text{Number of $5 bills} = \frac{1200}{5} = 240
   \]

Thus, the final answer is that Thomas has **240** $5 bills.
