==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to determine how much money Jack has after receiving a portion of Sophia's money.

1. **Initial Amount**: Jack starts with $100.

2. **Sophia's Contribution**: Sophia gives Jack \( \frac{1}{5} \) of her $100. We need to calculate how much that is.

   \[
   \text{Amount given by Sophia} = \frac{1}{5} \times 100
   \]

   To perform the multiplication:

   \[
   \frac{1}{5} \times 100 = \frac{100}{5} = 20
   \]

   So, Sophia gives Jack $20.

3. **Total Amount for Jack**: Now we add the amount Jack initially had to the amount he received from Sophia.

   \[
   \text{Total amount Jack has} = \text{Initial amount} + \text{Amount from Sophia}
   \]

   Substituting the values we have:

   \[
   \text{Total amount Jack has} = 100 + 20 = 120
   \]

4. **Final Answer**: Therefore, after receiving the money from Sophia, Jack has a total of $120.

Thus, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{120}
\]
