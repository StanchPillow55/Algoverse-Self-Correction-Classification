To find out how much more the basketball coach spent than the baseball coach, we need to calculate the total amount spent by each coach and then find the difference between the two amounts.

**Step 1: Calculate the total spent by the baseball coach.**

The baseball coach bought 9 baseballs at a price of $3 each. We can calculate the total cost for the baseballs using the formula:

\[
\text{Total Cost} = \text{Number of Items} \times \text{Price per Item}
\]

Substituting the values for the baseball coach:

\[
\text{Total Cost}_{\text{baseball}} = 9 \times 3
\]

Calculating this:

\[
\text{Total Cost}_{\text{baseball}} = 27
\]

So, the baseball coach spent $27.

**Step 2: Calculate the total spent by the basketball coach.**

The basketball coach bought 8 basketballs at a price of $14 each. We can use the same formula to calculate the total cost for the basketballs:

\[
\text{Total Cost}_{\text{basketball}} = 8 \times 14
\]

Calculating this:

\[
\text{Total Cost}_{\text{basketball}} = 112
\]

So, the basketball coach spent $112.

**Step 3: Find the difference in spending between the basketball coach and the baseball coach.**

Now we need to find out how much more the basketball coach spent than the baseball coach. We do this by subtracting the total cost of the baseball coach from the total cost of the basketball coach:

\[
\text{Difference} = \text{Total Cost}_{\text{basketball}} - \text{Total Cost}_{\text{baseball}}
\]

Substituting the values we calculated:

\[
\text{Difference} = 112 - 27
\]

Calculating this:

\[
\text{Difference} = 85
\]

**Final Answer:**

The basketball coach spent $85 more than the baseball coach.
