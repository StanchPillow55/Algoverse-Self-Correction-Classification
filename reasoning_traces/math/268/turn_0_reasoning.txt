To find out how much the real estate agent spent on buying all the ads, we need to calculate the total cost for both the newspaper ads and the television ads separately, and then sum those costs.

### Step 1: Calculate the cost of newspaper ads

The cost of each newspaper ad is $5, and the agent bought 50 newspaper ads. 

To find the total cost for the newspaper ads, we use the formula:

\[
\text{Total cost of newspaper ads} = \text{Number of newspaper ads} \times \text{Cost per newspaper ad}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\text{Total cost of newspaper ads} = 50 \times 5
\]

Calculating this gives:

\[
\text{Total cost of newspaper ads} = 250
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the cost of television ads

The cost of each television ad is $75, and the agent bought 15 television ads.

Using the same formula for the total cost of television ads:

\[
\text{Total cost of television ads} = \text{Number of television ads} \times \text{Cost per television ad}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\text{Total cost of television ads} = 15 \times 75
\]

Calculating this gives:

\[
\text{Total cost of television ads} = 1125
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the total cost of all ads

Now, we add the total costs of the newspaper ads and the television ads to find the overall expenditure:

\[
\text{Total cost of all ads} = \text{Total cost of newspaper ads} + \text{Total cost of television ads}
\]

Substituting the values we calculated:

\[
\text{Total cost of all ads} = 250 + 1125
\]

Calculating this gives:

\[
\text{Total cost of all ads} = 1375
\]

### Final Answer

The total amount spent by the real estate agent on buying all the ads is:

\[
\boxed{1375}
\]
