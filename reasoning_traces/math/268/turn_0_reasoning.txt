==================================================

To find the average number of carnations in the bouquets that Trevor bought, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Identify the number of carnations in each bouquet**:
   - First bouquet: 9 carnations
   - Second bouquet: 14 carnations
   - Third bouquet: 13 carnations

2. **Calculate the total number of carnations**:
   We will add the number of carnations from all three bouquets together.

   \[
   \text{Total carnations} = 9 + 14 + 13
   \]

   Let's perform the addition step by step:

   - First, add the first two bouquets:
     \[
     9 + 14 = 23
     \]
   - Now, add the third bouquet:
     \[
     23 + 13 = 36
     \]

   So, the total number of carnations is 36.

3. **Count the number of bouquets**:
   Trevor bought 3 bouquets.

4. **Calculate the average number of carnations**:
   The average is calculated by dividing the total number of carnations by the number of bouquets.

   \[
   \text{Average} = \frac{\text{Total carnations}}{\text{Number of bouquets}} = \frac{36}{3}
   \]

   Now, perform the division:
   \[
   \frac{36}{3} = 12
   \]

5. **State the final answer**:
   The average number of carnations in the bouquets is \( \boxed{12} \).
