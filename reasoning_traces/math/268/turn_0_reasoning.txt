==================================================

To find the average number of carnations in the bouquets, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Identify the number of carnations in each bouquet:**
   - First bouquet: 9 carnations
   - Second bouquet: 14 carnations
   - Third bouquet: 13 carnations

2. **Calculate the total number of carnations:**
   To find the total, we add the number of carnations in each bouquet together:
   \[
   9 + 14 + 13
   \]

3. **Perform the addition:**
   - First, add the first two numbers:
     \[
     9 + 14 = 23
     \]
   - Then, add the result to the third number:
     \[
     23 + 13 = 36
     \]

   So, the total number of carnations is 36.

4. **Determine the number of bouquets:**
   There are 3 bouquets in total.

5. **Calculate the average number of carnations per bouquet:**
   The average is found by dividing the total number of carnations by the number of bouquets:
   \[
   \text{Average} = \frac{\text{Total number of carnations}}{\text{Number of bouquets}} = \frac{36}{3}
   \]

6. **Perform the division:**
   \[
   \frac{36}{3} = 12
   \]

Thus, the average number of carnations in the bouquets is 12.

**Final Answer:**
The average number of carnations in the bouquets is 12.
