==================================================

To find the total amount Molly will pay for the catering, we need to calculate the cost for each type of salad separately and then add those costs together.

1. **Calculate the cost for the chicken salad:**
   - Number of people wanting chicken salad: 10
   - Cost per person for chicken salad: $6.50

   To find the total cost for the chicken salad, we multiply the number of people by the cost per person:
   \[
   \text{Total cost for chicken salad} = \text{Number of people} \times \text{Cost per person}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total cost for chicken salad} = 10 \times 6.50 = 65.00
   \]

2. **Calculate the cost for the pasta salad:**
   - Number of people wanting pasta salad: 6
   - Cost per person for pasta salad: $6.00

   Similarly, we calculate the total cost for the pasta salad:
   \[
   \text{Total cost for pasta salad} = \text{Number of people} \times \text{Cost per person}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total cost for pasta salad} = 6 \times 6.00 = 36.00
   \]

3. **Calculate the total catering cost:**
   Now, we add the total costs for both types of salad:
   \[
   \text{Total catering cost} = \text{Total cost for chicken salad} + \text{Total cost for pasta salad}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total catering cost} = 65.00 + 36.00 = 101.00
   \]

Thus, the total amount Molly will pay for the catering is \(\boxed{101.00}\).
