==================================================

To solve the problem, I need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 373" refers to. However, since this is a placeholder and does not provide specific details about the problem, I will create a hypothetical math problem and solve it step by step. 

Let's assume the problem is as follows:

**Problem:**  
A company produces two types of products, A and B. The profit from each unit of product A is $5, and the profit from each unit of product B is $8. The company can produce a maximum of 100 units of product A and 80 units of product B per day. However, due to resource constraints, the total production of products A and B combined cannot exceed 150 units per day. How many units of each product should the company produce to maximize profit?

**Solution:**

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( x \) be the number of units of product A produced.
   - Let \( y \) be the number of units of product B produced.

2. **Objective Function:**
   - The profit function \( P \) is given by:
     \[
     P = 5x + 8y
     \]
   - We want to maximize \( P \).

3. **Constraints:**
   - The production constraints are:
     \[
     x \leq 100
     \]
     \[
     y \leq 80
     \]
     \[
     x + y \leq 150
     \]
   - Additionally, \( x \) and \( y \) must be non-negative:
     \[
     x \geq 0, \quad y \geq 0
     \]

4. **Graphical Solution:**
   - Plot the constraints on a graph with \( x \) on the horizontal axis and \( y \) on the vertical axis.
   - The feasible region is bounded by the lines \( x = 100 \), \( y = 80 \), and \( x + y = 150 \).

5. **Identify Corner Points:**
   - The corner points of the feasible region are found by solving the system of equations given by the intersections of the constraint lines:
     - Intersection of \( x = 100 \) and \( x + y = 150 \):
       \[
       x = 100 \Rightarrow 100 + y = 150 \Rightarrow y = 50 \quad \Rightarrow (100, 50)
       \]
     - Intersection of \( y = 80 \) and \( x + y = 150 \):
       \[
       y = 80 \Rightarrow x + 80 = 150 \Rightarrow x = 70 \quad \Rightarrow (70, 80)
       \]
     - Intersection of \( x = 0 \) and \( y = 0 \) with \( x + y = 150 \) gives:
       \[
       (0, 0)
       \]
     - Intersection of \( x = 0 \) and \( y = 80 \) gives:
       \[
       (0, 80)
       \]
     - Intersection of \( x = 100 \) and \( y = 0 \) gives:
       \[
       (100, 0)
       \]

6. **Evaluate the Objective Function at Each Corner Point:**
   - \( P(100, 50) = 5(100) + 8(50) = 500 + 400 = 900 \)
   - \( P(70, 80) = 5(70) + 8(80) = 350 + 640 = 990 \)
   - \( P(0, 0) = 5(0) + 8(0) = 0 \)
   - \( P(0, 80) = 5(0) + 8(80) = 640 \)
   - \( P(100, 0) = 5(100) + 8(0) = 500 \)

7. **Determine the Maximum Profit:**
   - The maximum profit is \( 990 \), which occurs at the point \( (70, 80) \).

**Final Answer:**
The company should produce 70 units of product A and 80 units of product B to maximize profit, resulting in a maximum profit of $990.
