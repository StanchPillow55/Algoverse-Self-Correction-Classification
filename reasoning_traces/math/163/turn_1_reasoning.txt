Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To find the total worth of all the toys in the room, we need to calculate the value of each type of toy and then sum them up.

1. **Determine the cost of the red cars:**
   - There are 5 red cars, and each red car costs $4.
   - Total cost of red cars = Number of red cars × Cost per red car
   \[
   \text{Total cost of red cars} = 5 \times 4 = 20 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Determine the cost of the action figures:**
   - There are 3 action figures, and each action figure costs $5.
   - Total cost of action figures = Number of action figures × Cost per action figure
   \[
   \text{Total cost of action figures} = 3 \times 5 = 15 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Determine the cost of the doll:**
   - The problem states that the doll costs as much as 3 action figures.
   - Since each action figure costs $5, the cost of the doll is:
   \[
   \text{Cost of the doll} = 3 \times 5 = 15 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Calculate the total worth of all toys:**
   - Now we sum the costs of all the toys:
   \[
   \text{Total worth} = \text{Total cost of red cars} + \text{Total cost of action figures} + \text{Cost of the doll}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total worth} = 20 + 15 + 15 = 50 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Thus, the total worth of all the toys is **$50**.
