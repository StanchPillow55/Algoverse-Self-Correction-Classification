To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total points James scored during the season and then compare it to the old record of 300 points to determine how many points he beat the record by.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Calculate the points from touchdowns:**
   - James scores 4 touchdowns per game.
   - Each touchdown is worth 6 points.
   - There are 15 games in the season.

   First, calculate the total number of touchdowns James scores in the season:
   \[
   \text{Total touchdowns} = 4 \text{ touchdowns/game} \times 15 \text{ games} = 60 \text{ touchdowns}
   \]

   Next, calculate the total points from these touchdowns:
   \[
   \text{Points from touchdowns} = 60 \text{ touchdowns} \times 6 \text{ points/touchdown} = 360 \text{ points}
   \]

2. **Calculate the points from 2-point conversions:**
   - James scores 2-point conversions 6 times during the season.
   - Each 2-point conversion is worth 2 points.

   Calculate the total points from 2-point conversions:
   \[
   \text{Points from 2-point conversions} = 6 \text{ conversions} \times 2 \text{ points/conversion} = 12 \text{ points}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total points James scored in the season:**
   Add the points from touchdowns and 2-point conversions:
   \[
   \text{Total points scored by James} = 360 \text{ points (touchdowns)} + 12 \text{ points (conversions)} = 372 \text{ points}
   \]

4. **Determine how many points James beat the old record by:**
   The old record was 300 points. Subtract the old record from the total points James scored:
   \[
   \text{Points over the old record} = 372 \text{ points} - 300 \text{ points} = 72 \text{ points}
   \]

Therefore, James beat the old record by 72 points.

**Final Answer:**
James beat the old record by 72 points.
