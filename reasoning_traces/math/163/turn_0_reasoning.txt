To find the total worth of all the toys in the room, we need to calculate the cost of each type of toy and then sum them up.

1. **Determine the cost of the red cars:**
   - We know that one red car costs $4.
   - There are 5 red cars.
   - The total cost for the red cars can be calculated as follows:
     \[
     \text{Total cost of red cars} = \text{Number of red cars} \times \text{Cost per red car} = 5 \times 4 = 20 \text{ dollars}
     \]

2. **Determine the cost of the action figures:**
   - We know that one action figure costs $5.
   - There are 3 action figures.
   - The total cost for the action figures can be calculated as follows:
     \[
     \text{Total cost of action figures} = \text{Number of action figures} \times \text{Cost per action figure} = 3 \times 5 = 15 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Determine the cost of the doll:**
   - We know that the doll costs as much as 3 action figures.
   - Since one action figure costs $5, the cost of 3 action figures is:
     \[
     \text{Cost of the doll} = 3 \times 5 = 15 \text{ dollars}
     \]

4. **Calculate the total cost of all toys:**
   - Now we can sum the costs of all the toys:
     \[
     \text{Total cost of all toys} = \text{Total cost of red cars} + \text{Total cost of action figures} + \text{Cost of the doll}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total cost of all toys} = 20 + 15 + 15 = 50 \text{ dollars}
     \]

Thus, the total worth of all the toys in the room is **$50**. 

Final answer: **$50**.
