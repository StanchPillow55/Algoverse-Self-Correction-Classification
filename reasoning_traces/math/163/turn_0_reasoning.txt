To determine how many points James scored during the season and how much he beat the old record by, we will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total points from touchdowns:**
   - James scores 4 touchdowns per game.
   - Each touchdown is worth 6 points.
   - There are 15 games in the season.

   First, we calculate the total number of touchdowns scored in the season:
   \[
   \text{Total touchdowns} = \text{touchdowns per game} \times \text{number of games} = 4 \times 15 = 60 \text{ touchdowns}
   \]

   Next, we calculate the total points from these touchdowns:
   \[
   \text{Points from touchdowns} = \text{Total touchdowns} \times \text{points per touchdown} = 60 \times 6 = 360 \text{ points}
   \]

2. **Calculate the total points from 2-point conversions:**
   - James scores 2-point conversions 6 times during the season.
   - Each conversion is worth 2 points.

   Now, we calculate the total points from the conversions:
   \[
   \text{Points from conversions} = \text{number of conversions} \times \text{points per conversion} = 6 \times 2 = 12 \text{ points}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total points scored by James:**
   Now, we add the points from touchdowns and the points from conversions to find the total points scored by James:
   \[
   \text{Total points scored by James} = \text{Points from touchdowns} + \text{Points from conversions} = 360 + 12 = 372 \text{ points}
   \]

4. **Compare with the old record:**
   The old record was 300 points. We need to find out how many points James beat this record by:
   \[
   \text{Points beaten by} = \text{Total points scored by James} - \text{Old record} = 372 - 300 = 72 \text{ points}
   \]

Thus, James beat the old record by **72 points**.

**Final Answer: 72 points**
