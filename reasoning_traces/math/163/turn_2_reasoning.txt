Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To find the total value of all the toys in the room, we need to calculate the cost of each type of toy and then sum them up.

1. **Cost of a Red Car**: 
   - Given that one red car costs $4.
   - There are 5 red cars.
   - Total cost of red cars = Number of red cars × Cost per red car
   \[
   \text{Total cost of red cars} = 5 \times 4 = 20 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Cost of an Action Figure**:
   - Given that one action figure costs $5.
   - There are 3 action figures.
   - Total cost of action figures = Number of action figures × Cost per action figure
   \[
   \text{Total cost of action figures} = 3 \times 5 = 15 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Cost of the Doll**:
   - It is stated that the doll costs as much as 3 action figures.
   - Since one action figure costs $5, the cost of 3 action figures is:
   \[
   \text{Cost of the doll} = 3 \times 5 = 15 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Total Cost of All Toys**:
   - Now we sum the total costs of all the toys:
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = \text{Total cost of red cars} + \text{Total cost of action figures} + \text{Cost of the doll}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = 20 + 15 + 15 = 50 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Thus, the total worth of all the toys is **$50**. 

Final answer: **$50**.
