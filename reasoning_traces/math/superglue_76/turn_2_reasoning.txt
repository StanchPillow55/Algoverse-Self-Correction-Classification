Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we first need to understand what "Sample reasoning question 76" refers to. Since the question is not explicitly provided, I'll assume a hypothetical math problem and solve it step by step. Let's assume the problem is as follows:

**Problem:**
A farmer has a rectangular field that is 100 meters long and 60 meters wide. He wants to divide the field into smaller rectangular plots, each with an area of 150 square meters. How many such plots can the farmer create?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We have a rectangular field with dimensions 100 meters (length) and 60 meters (width).
   - The area of the field is calculated as:
     \[
     \text{Area of the field} = \text{Length} \times \text{Width} = 100 \times 60 = 6000 \text{ square meters}
     \]
   - We need to divide this field into smaller plots, each with an area of 150 square meters.

2. **Calculate the Number of Plots:**
   - Each plot has an area of 150 square meters.
   - To find the number of plots, divide the total area of the field by the area of one plot:
     \[
     \text{Number of plots} = \frac{\text{Total area of the field}}{\text{Area of one plot}} = \frac{6000}{150}
     \]

3. **Perform the Division:**
   - Calculate the division:
     \[
     \frac{6000}{150} = 40
     \]

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The farmer can create 40 plots, each with an area of 150 square meters.

**Final Answer:**
The farmer can create 40 smaller plots, each with an area of 150 square meters, from the rectangular field.
