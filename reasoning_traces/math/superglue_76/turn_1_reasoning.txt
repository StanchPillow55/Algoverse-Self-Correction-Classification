==================================================

To solve the problem effectively, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 76" entails. However, since the problem statement is not provided, I will demonstrate a general approach to solving a typical math problem by breaking it down into steps. Let's assume a hypothetical math problem for demonstration purposes.

**Hypothetical Problem:**
Calculate the area of a triangle with a base of 10 units and a height of 5 units.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We need to find the area of a triangle.
   - We are given the base (b) of the triangle as 10 units.
   - We are given the height (h) of the triangle as 5 units.

2. **Recall the Formula for the Area of a Triangle:**
   - The formula for the area (A) of a triangle is:
     \[
     A = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height}
     \]

3. **Substitute the Given Values into the Formula:**
   - Substitute \( b = 10 \) units and \( h = 5 \) units into the formula:
     \[
     A = \frac{1}{2} \times 10 \times 5
     \]

4. **Perform the Calculations:**
   - First, multiply the base and the height:
     \[
     10 \times 5 = 50
     \]
   - Then, multiply the result by \(\frac{1}{2}\):
     \[
     A = \frac{1}{2} \times 50 = 25
     \]

5. **State the Final Answer:**
   - The area of the triangle is 25 square units.

By following these steps, we have systematically solved the problem. If you have a specific problem or question in mind, please provide the details, and I can work through that particular problem using a similar step-by-step approach.
