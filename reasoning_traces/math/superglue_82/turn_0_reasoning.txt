To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 82" entails. Since the problem statement is not provided, I'll demonstrate a general approach to solving a typical math problem by outlining the steps and reasoning involved.

Let's assume "Sample reasoning question 82" is a math problem involving algebra, such as solving an equation. Here's a hypothetical example and how we would solve it:

**Problem:**
Solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 3x + 5 = 20 \).

**Step-by-step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   We need to find the value of \( x \) that makes the equation true. The equation given is \( 3x + 5 = 20 \).

2. **Isolate the Variable:**
   To solve for \( x \), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We start by eliminating the constant term on the left side.

   \[
   3x + 5 = 20
   \]

   Subtract 5 from both sides to remove the constant:

   \[
   3x + 5 - 5 = 20 - 5
   \]

   Simplifying both sides gives:

   \[
   3x = 15
   \]

3. **Solve for \( x \):**
   Now, divide both sides by 3 to solve for \( x \):

   \[
   \frac{3x}{3} = \frac{15}{3}
   \]

   Simplifying both sides gives:

   \[
   x = 5
   \]

4. **Verify the Solution:**
   Substitute \( x = 5 \) back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies the equation:

   \[
   3(5) + 5 = 20
   \]

   Simplifying the left side:

   \[
   15 + 5 = 20
   \]

   \[
   20 = 20
   \]

   The equation holds true, so \( x = 5 \) is indeed the correct solution.

5. **State the Final Answer:**
   The solution to the equation \( 3x + 5 = 20 \) is \( x = 5 \).

This approach demonstrates a clear, step-by-step method to solve a typical algebraic equation. If "Sample reasoning question 82" refers to a different type of problem, please provide additional details or context, and I can tailor the solution accordingly.
