To solve the problem, we first need to understand what "Sample math problem 4" entails. Since no specific details are provided, I'll create a sample math problem and solve it step by step.

**Sample Math Problem 4:**

A rectangle has a length that is twice its width. If the perimeter of the rectangle is 36 units, what are the dimensions of the rectangle?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We have a rectangle with a length (L) and a width (W).
   - The length is twice the width: \( L = 2W \).
   - The perimeter of the rectangle is 36 units.

2. **Use the Perimeter Formula:**
   - The formula for the perimeter (P) of a rectangle is:
     \[
     P = 2L + 2W
     \]
   - We know the perimeter is 36 units, so:
     \[
     2L + 2W = 36
     \]

3. **Substitute the Expression for L:**
   - Since \( L = 2W \), substitute \( L \) in the perimeter equation:
     \[
     2(2W) + 2W = 36
     \]

4. **Simplify the Equation:**
   - Simplify the left side:
     \[
     4W + 2W = 36
     \]
   - Combine like terms:
     \[
     6W = 36
     \]

5. **Solve for W:**
   - Divide both sides by 6 to find W:
     \[
     W = \frac{36}{6} = 6
     \]

6. **Find the Length L:**
   - Use the relationship \( L = 2W \) to find L:
     \[
     L = 2 \times 6 = 12
     \]

7. **Verify the Solution:**
   - Check if the dimensions satisfy the perimeter condition:
     \[
     2L + 2W = 2(12) + 2(6) = 24 + 12 = 36
     \]
   - The calculated perimeter matches the given perimeter, confirming our solution is correct.

**Final Answer:**

The dimensions of the rectangle are:
- Width: 6 units
- Length: 12 units
