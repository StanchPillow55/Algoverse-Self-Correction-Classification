==================================================

It seems like the problem statement "Sample math problem 4" is not providing specific details about the math problem you want to solve. To help you effectively, I need a clear and complete math problem. However, I can create a sample math problem and solve it step by step for you. Let's proceed with a sample problem:

**Sample Problem:**

Solve for \( x \) in the equation: 

\[ 2x + 3 = 11 \]

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Equation:**
   The equation given is a simple linear equation in one variable, \( x \). Our goal is to isolate \( x \) on one side of the equation.

2. **Subtract 3 from Both Sides:**
   To begin isolating \( x \), we need to eliminate the constant term on the left side of the equation. We do this by subtracting 3 from both sides:

   \[
   2x + 3 - 3 = 11 - 3
   \]

   Simplifying both sides gives:

   \[
   2x = 8
   \]

3. **Divide Both Sides by 2:**
   Now, to solve for \( x \), we need to divide both sides of the equation by 2, which is the coefficient of \( x \):

   \[
   \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{8}{2}
   \]

   Simplifying both sides gives:

   \[
   x = 4
   \]

4. **Verify the Solution:**
   To ensure our solution is correct, we substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation:

   \[
   2(4) + 3 = 11
   \]

   Simplifying the left side gives:

   \[
   8 + 3 = 11
   \]

   Since both sides of the equation are equal, our solution is verified.

**Final Answer:**

The solution to the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \) is \( x = 4 \).
