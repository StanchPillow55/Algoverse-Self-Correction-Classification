==================================================

It seems like you've referenced a "Sample reasoning question 16," but I don't have access to external documents or specific questions from textbooks or other sources. However, I can guide you through a generic process of solving a math problem by explaining the steps typically involved. If you have a specific math problem in mind, please provide the details, and I'll be happy to help solve it.

Here's a generic approach to solving a math problem:

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - Read the problem carefully.
   - Identify what is being asked.
   - Determine what information is given and what needs to be found.

2. **Devise a Plan:**
   - Think about the strategies that can be used to solve the problem. This could include drawing a diagram, creating an equation, or breaking the problem into smaller parts.

3. **Carry Out the Plan:**
   - Execute the strategy you devised.
   - Perform calculations carefully.
   - Keep track of units and ensure that all parts of the problem are addressed.

4. **Review/Check Your Work:**
   - Verify each step of your solution.
   - Check your calculations for errors.
   - Ensure that your solution makes sense in the context of the problem.

5. **State the Final Answer:**
   - Clearly write down the final answer.
   - Include units if applicable.

If you provide a specific problem, I can apply this process to solve it.
