==================================================

To solve the problem effectively, I need more specific information about "Sample reasoning question 16." Since the question is not provided, I'll demonstrate how to approach a generic math problem step by step. If you have a specific question in mind, please provide the details, and I'll be happy to assist.

Let's consider a sample math problem:

**Problem:**
A train travels from City A to City B, a distance of 300 miles, at a speed of 60 miles per hour. How long does the journey take?

**Step-by-step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We need to find the time it takes for the train to travel from City A to City B.
   - We know the distance between the two cities is 300 miles.
   - The train travels at a constant speed of 60 miles per hour.

2. **Identify the Formula:**
   - The formula to calculate time when distance and speed are known is:
     \[
     \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}}
     \]

3. **Substitute the Known Values:**
   - Distance = 300 miles
   - Speed = 60 miles per hour
   - Substitute these values into the formula:
     \[
     \text{Time} = \frac{300 \text{ miles}}{60 \text{ miles per hour}}
     \]

4. **Perform the Calculation:**
   - Divide 300 by 60:
     \[
     \text{Time} = \frac{300}{60} = 5 \text{ hours}
     \]

5. **Verify the Solution:**
   - To ensure the calculation is correct, consider the units:
     - Miles cancel out, leaving hours as the unit for time, which is correct.
   - Recalculate if necessary to confirm the accuracy.

6. **State the Final Answer:**
   - The journey takes 5 hours.

By following these steps, you can systematically solve similar problems. If you have a specific question or need further assistance, please provide more details.
