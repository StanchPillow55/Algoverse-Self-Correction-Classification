Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 145," we first need to understand what the problem is asking. Since "Sample math problem 145" is not a specific question, I'll create a hypothetical math problem with the number 145 and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**
Find the sum of the digits of the number 145 and determine if this sum is a prime number.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Identify the Digits of the Number:**
   The number given is 145. The digits in this number are 1, 4, and 5.

2. **Calculate the Sum of the Digits:**
   To find the sum of the digits, we add them together:
   \[
   1 + 4 + 5 = 10
   \]

3. **Determine if the Sum is a Prime Number:**
   A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. Let's check if 10 is a prime number:
   - The divisors of 10 are 1, 2, 5, and 10.
   - Since 10 has divisors other than 1 and itself, it is not a prime number.

4. **Conclusion:**
   The sum of the digits of 145 is 10, and 10 is not a prime number.

**Final Answer:**
The sum of the digits of 145 is 10, and it is not a prime number.
