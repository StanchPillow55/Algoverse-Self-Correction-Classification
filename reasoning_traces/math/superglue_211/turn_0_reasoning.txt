2. **Devise a Plan:**
   - Consider possible strategies to solve the problem. Common strategies include:
     - Drawing a diagram.
     - Creating a table.
     - Writing an equation.
     - Breaking the problem into smaller parts.
     - Looking for patterns.

3. **Carry Out the Plan:**
   - Execute the chosen strategy step by step.
   - Perform calculations carefully.
   - Keep track of units and ensure consistency.

4. **Check Your Work:**
   - Review each step to ensure accuracy.
   - Verify that the solution makes sense in the context of the problem.
   - Check calculations for errors.

5. **State the Final Answer:**
   - Clearly write the final answer.
   - Include units if applicable.

### Example Problem

Let's solve a simple example problem using this approach:

**Problem:** A rectangle has a length of 10 units and a width of 5 units. What is the area of the rectangle?

**Step 1: Understand the Problem**
- We need to find the area of a rectangle.
- The formula for the area of a rectangle is \( \text{Area} = \text{length} \times \text{width} \).

**Step 2: Devise a Plan**
- Use the formula for the area of a rectangle.

**Step 3: Carry Out the Plan**
- Length = 10 units
- Width = 5 units
- Area = \( 10 \times 5 = 50 \) square units

**Step 4: Check Your Work**
- The calculation \( 10 \times 5 = 50 \) is correct.
- The units are consistent (square units for area).

**Step 5: State the Final Answer**
- The area of the rectangle is 50 square units.
