==================================================

It seems like the problem statement is incomplete or unclear. "Sample math problem 33" doesn't provide enough information for me to solve a specific problem. However, I can guide you through a general approach to solving math problems if you provide more details or specify the type of problem you're dealing with (e.g., algebra, geometry, calculus, etc.).

Here's a general approach to solving math problems:

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - Read the problem carefully.
   - Identify what is being asked.
   - Determine what information is given and what needs to be found.

2. **Devise a Plan:**
   - Consider possible strategies to solve the problem (e.g., drawing a diagram, creating an equation, using a formula).
   - Choose the most appropriate method based on the problem type.

3. **Carry Out the Plan:**
   - Execute the chosen strategy step by step.
   - Perform calculations carefully.
   - Keep track of units and ensure consistency.

4. **Check Your Work:**
   - Review each step to ensure accuracy.
   - Verify that the solution makes sense in the context of the problem.
   - Double-check calculations and logic.

5. **State the Final Answer:**
   - Clearly present the solution.
   - Include units if applicable.

If you can provide more details or specify the type of math problem you're dealing with, I'd be happy to help you solve it step by step!
