==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 33," we need to first understand what the problem is asking. However, the problem statement "Sample math problem 33" is not specific and does not provide any details about the actual mathematical question or context. Therefore, I will demonstrate how to approach a typical math problem by creating a hypothetical example and solving it step by step.

Let's assume "Sample math problem 33" refers to a common type of math problem. For this example, I'll create a problem involving algebra:

**Hypothetical Problem:**
Solve for \( x \) in the equation: \( 3x + 5 = 20 \).

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Equation:**
   The equation given is \( 3x + 5 = 20 \). Our goal is to solve for \( x \), which means we need to isolate \( x \) on one side of the equation.

2. **Subtract 5 from Both Sides:**
   To begin isolating \( x \), we first eliminate the constant term on the left side by subtracting 5 from both sides of the equation:
   \[
   3x + 5 - 5 = 20 - 5
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   3x = 15
   \]

3. **Divide Both Sides by 3:**
   Next, we need to solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides of the equation by 3:
   \[
   \frac{3x}{3} = \frac{15}{3}
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   x = 5
   \]

4. **Verify the Solution:**
   To ensure our solution is correct, we substitute \( x = 5 \) back into the original equation:
   \[
   3(5) + 5 = 20
   \]
   Simplifying the left side gives:
   \[
   15 + 5 = 20
   \]
   \[
   20 = 20
   \]
   Since both sides of the equation are equal, our solution \( x = 5 \) is verified.

**Final Answer:**
The solution to the equation \( 3x + 5 = 20 \) is \( x = 5 \).

This example demonstrates how to solve a basic algebraic equation by isolating the variable. If you have a specific "Sample math problem 33" in mind, please provide the details, and I will be happy to solve it for you.
