Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve "Sample math problem 483," we first need to understand what the problem is asking. Since the problem is not explicitly stated, let's assume a hypothetical math problem labeled as "Sample math problem 483" and solve it step by step.

Let's assume the problem is as follows:

**Problem 483:**
A rectangle has a length that is 3 times its width. If the perimeter of the rectangle is 48 units, find the dimensions of the rectangle.

**Step 1: Define the variables.**
Let \( w \) be the width of the rectangle.
Since the length is 3 times the width, let the length be \( 3w \).

**Step 2: Write the equation for the perimeter.**
The formula for the perimeter \( P \) of a rectangle is given by:
\[ P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width}) \]

Substitute the known values:
\[ 48 = 2 \times (3w + w) \]

**Step 3: Simplify the equation.**
\[ 48 = 2 \times 4w \]
\[ 48 = 8w \]

**Step 4: Solve for \( w \).**
Divide both sides of the equation by 8 to solve for \( w \):
\[ w = \frac{48}{8} \]
\[ w = 6 \]

**Step 5: Find the length.**
Since the length is 3 times the width:
\[ \text{Length} = 3w = 3 \times 6 = 18 \]

**Step 6: Verify the solution.**
Check if the calculated dimensions satisfy the perimeter condition:
\[ P = 2 \times (18 + 6) = 2 \times 24 = 48 \]

The calculations are correct, and the perimeter matches the given condition.

**Final Answer:**
The dimensions of the rectangle are:
- Width = 6 units
- Length = 18 units
