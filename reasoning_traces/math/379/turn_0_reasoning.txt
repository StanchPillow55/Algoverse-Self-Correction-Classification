To determine the total cost of John's piano learning experience, we need to calculate the cost of the piano and the total cost of the lessons after applying the discount. Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Cost of the Piano:**
   - John buys a piano for $500. 
   - Therefore, the cost of the piano is $500.

2. **Cost of the Lessons Before Discount:**
   - John hires a teacher for 20 lessons, with each lesson costing $40.
   - To find the total cost of the lessons before the discount, multiply the number of lessons by the cost per lesson:
     \[
     \text{Total cost of lessons before discount} = 20 \text{ lessons} \times \$40/\text{lesson} = \$800
     \]

3. **Applying the Discount:**
   - John receives a 25% discount on the total cost of the lessons.
   - To find the discount amount, calculate 25% of $800:
     \[
     \text{Discount amount} = 0.25 \times \$800 = \$200
     \]
   - Subtract the discount amount from the total cost of the lessons to find the cost after the discount:
     \[
     \text{Total cost of lessons after discount} = \$800 - \$200 = \$600
     \]

4. **Total Cost of Everything:**
   - Add the cost of the piano and the discounted cost of the lessons to find the total cost:
     \[
     \text{Total cost} = \$500 + \$600 = \$1100
     \]

Therefore, the total cost of everything, including the piano and the discounted lessons, is \(\boxed{1100}\) dollars.
