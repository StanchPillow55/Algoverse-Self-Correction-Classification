==================================================

To find out how many cookies Rachel has left after her brother ate some, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of cookies Rachel initially had.**
   - Rachel bought 23 cookies.
   - Janet gave her 42 cookies.
   - To find the total, we add these two amounts together:
     \[
     \text{Total cookies} = 23 + 42
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total cookies} = 65
     \]

2. **Determine how many cookies Rachel's brother ate.**
   - Rachel's brother ate 44 cookies.

3. **Calculate the remaining cookies after her brother ate some.**
   - To find out how many cookies are left, we subtract the number of cookies her brother ate from the total number of cookies Rachel had:
     \[
     \text{Remaining cookies} = \text{Total cookies} - \text{Cookies eaten by brother}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Remaining cookies} = 65 - 44
     \]
     \[
     \text{Remaining cookies} = 21
     \]

Thus, after performing all the calculations, we find that Rachel has **21 cookies left**.

Final answer: **21 cookies**.
