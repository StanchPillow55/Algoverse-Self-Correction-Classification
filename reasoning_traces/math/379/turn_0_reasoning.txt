To find the total cost of John's piano learning journey, we need to calculate the cost of the piano and the cost of the lessons after applying the discount. Let's break this down step by step.

1. **Cost of the Piano:**
   - John buys a piano for $500.
   - Cost of the piano = $500.

2. **Cost of the Lessons:**
   - John hires a teacher for 20 lessons at $40 per lesson.
   - First, we calculate the total cost of the lessons without the discount:
     \[
     \text{Total cost of lessons} = \text{Number of lessons} \times \text{Cost per lesson}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total cost of lessons} = 20 \times 40 = 800
     \]

3. **Applying the Discount:**
   - John receives a 25% discount on the total cost of the lessons.
   - To find the amount of the discount, we calculate 25% of $800:
     \[
     \text{Discount} = 0.25 \times 800 = 200
     \]
   - Now, we subtract the discount from the total cost of the lessons to find the final cost of the lessons:
     \[
     \text{Final cost of lessons} = \text{Total cost of lessons} - \text{Discount}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Final cost of lessons} = 800 - 200 = 600
     \]

4. **Total Cost:**
   - Now, we add the cost of the piano and the final cost of the lessons to find the total cost:
     \[
     \text{Total cost} = \text{Cost of piano} + \text{Final cost of lessons}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total cost} = 500 + 600 = 1100
     \]

Thus, the total cost of everything John spent to learn how to play the piano is **$1100**. 

Final answer: **$1100**.
