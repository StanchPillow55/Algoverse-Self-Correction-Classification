It seems like there might be some confusion with the phrase "Sample math problem 76." This doesn't specify a particular math problem. However, I can create a sample math problem for you and solve it step by step. Let's proceed with a problem involving algebra:

**Sample Math Problem:**

Solve for \( x \) in the equation:
\[ 3x + 5 = 2x + 11 \]

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Identify the Equation:**
   We start with the equation:
   \[
   3x + 5 = 2x + 11
   \]

2. **Isolate the Variable:**
   To solve for \( x \), we need to get all terms involving \( x \) on one side of the equation and constant terms on the other side. Let's move the term \( 2x \) from the right side to the left side by subtracting \( 2x \) from both sides:
   \[
   3x + 5 - 2x = 2x + 11 - 2x
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   x + 5 = 11
   \]

3. **Solve for \( x \):**
   Next, we need to isolate \( x \) by removing the constant term on the left side. We do this by subtracting 5 from both sides:
   \[
   x + 5 - 5 = 11 - 5
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   x = 6
   \]

4. **Verify the Solution:**
   To ensure our solution is correct, we can substitute \( x = 6 \) back into the original equation and check if both sides are equal:
   \[
   3(6) + 5 = 2(6) + 11
   \]
   Calculate each side:
   \[
   18 + 5 = 12 + 11
   \]
   \[
   23 = 23
   \]
   Since both sides are equal, our solution \( x = 6 \) is verified.

**Final Answer:**
The solution to the equation \( 3x + 5 = 2x + 11 \) is \( x = 6 \).
