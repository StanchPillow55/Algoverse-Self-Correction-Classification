==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample math problem 76" refers to. Since there is no specific problem statement provided, I will create a hypothetical math problem labeled as "Sample math problem 76" and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem 76:**

Calculate the sum of all even numbers between 1 and 100.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Identify the Even Numbers:**
   Even numbers between 1 and 100 are numbers that are divisible by 2. The sequence of even numbers between 1 and 100 is: 2, 4, 6, ..., 100.

2. **Determine the Sequence:**
   This sequence is an arithmetic sequence where the first term \( a_1 = 2 \) and the common difference \( d = 2 \).

3. **Find the Number of Terms:**
   To find the number of terms \( n \) in the sequence, we use the formula for the \( n \)-th term of an arithmetic sequence:
   \[
   a_n = a_1 + (n-1) \cdot d
   \]
   Set \( a_n = 100 \) (the last term of the sequence):
   \[
   100 = 2 + (n-1) \cdot 2
   \]
   \[
   100 = 2 + 2n - 2
   \]
   \[
   100 = 2n
   \]
   \[
   n = 50
   \]
   So, there are 50 even numbers between 1 and 100.

4. **Calculate the Sum of the Sequence:**
   The sum \( S_n \) of the first \( n \) terms of an arithmetic sequence is given by:
   \[
   S_n = \frac{n}{2} \cdot (a_1 + a_n)
   \]
   Substitute the known values:
   \[
   S_{50} = \frac{50}{2} \cdot (2 + 100)
   \]
   \[
   S_{50} = 25 \cdot 102
   \]
   \[
   S_{50} = 2550
   \]

**Final Answer:**

The sum of all even numbers between 1 and 100 is 2550.
