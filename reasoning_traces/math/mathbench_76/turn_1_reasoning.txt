==================================================

To solve "Sample math problem 76," we need to first understand what the problem is asking. However, the problem statement "Sample math problem 76" is not specific enough to determine the exact question or context. Therefore, I will assume a generic math problem involving the number 76 and solve it step by step.

Let's assume the problem is as follows:

**Problem:** Find the prime factors of 76 and determine if 76 is a prime number.

**Step 1: Determine if 76 is a prime number.**

A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. To determine if 76 is a prime number, we need to check if it has any divisors other than 1 and 76.

**Step 2: Check divisibility by smaller prime numbers.**

- **Divisibility by 2:** A number is divisible by 2 if it is even. Since 76 is even, it is divisible by 2.
  
  \[
  76 \div 2 = 38
  \]

  Since 76 is divisible by 2, it is not a prime number.

**Step 3: Find the prime factors of 76.**

Since 76 is divisible by 2, we start with 2 as a factor:

- Divide 76 by 2:

  \[
  76 \div 2 = 38
  \]

  So, 76 = 2 × 38.

- Now, find the prime factors of 38. Since 38 is also even, it is divisible by 2:

  \[
  38 \div 2 = 19
  \]

  So, 38 = 2 × 19.

- Now, check if 19 is a prime number. The prime numbers less than the square root of 19 (approximately 4.36) are 2 and 3. Since 19 is not divisible by 2 or 3, it is a prime number.

**Step 4: Compile the prime factors.**

The prime factors of 76 are 2 and 19. Therefore, the prime factorization of 76 is:

\[
76 = 2^2 \times 19
\]

**Final Answer:**

76 is not a prime number. Its prime factors are 2 and 19, and the prime factorization is \(2^2 \times 19\).
