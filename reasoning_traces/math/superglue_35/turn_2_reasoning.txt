==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 35" refers to. Since the problem statement is not specific, I'll assume it's a generic math problem that requires logical reasoning to solve. Let's create a hypothetical problem and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**

A farmer has a rectangular field that is 100 meters long and 50 meters wide. He wants to divide the field into two equal areas by constructing a fence parallel to one of the sides. How long will the fence be?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We have a rectangular field with dimensions 100 meters by 50 meters.
   - The total area of the field is \(100 \times 50 = 5000\) square meters.
   - We need to divide this field into two equal areas, so each area should be \( \frac{5000}{2} = 2500\) square meters.

2. **Determine the Orientation of the Fence:**
   - The fence can be parallel to either the length (100 meters) or the width (50 meters) of the rectangle.

3. **Case 1: Fence Parallel to the Length (100 meters):**
   - If the fence is parallel to the length, it will divide the width into two equal parts.
   - Let the width of each part be \(x\).
   - The area of each part is \(100 \times x = 2500\).
   - Solving for \(x\), we get:
     \[
     100x = 2500 \\
     x = \frac{2500}{100} = 25 \text{ meters}
     \]
   - Therefore, the fence will be 50 meters long (the full width of the field).

4. **Case 2: Fence Parallel to the Width (50 meters):**
   - If the fence is parallel to the width, it will divide the length into two equal parts.
   - Let the length of each part be \(y\).
   - The area of each part is \(50 \times y = 2500\).
   - Solving for \(y\), we get:
     \[
     50y = 2500 \\
     y = \frac{2500}{50} = 50 \text{ meters}
     \]
   - Therefore, the fence will be 100 meters long (the full length of the field).

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The fence can either be 50 meters long if it is parallel to the length of the field or 100 meters long if it is parallel to the width of the field.

**Final Answer:**
The fence can be either 50 meters long if parallel to the length or 100 meters long if parallel to the width of the field.
