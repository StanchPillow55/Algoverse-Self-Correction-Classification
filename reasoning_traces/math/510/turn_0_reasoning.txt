To determine how much of a calorie deficit Andy needs each day to lose 30 lbs. by his birthday on July 19th, we will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total calories needed to lose 30 lbs.**
   - We know that to lose 1 lb., Andy needs to burn 3500 calories.
   - Therefore, to lose 30 lbs., the total calories he needs to burn is:
     \[
     \text{Total calories} = 30 \text{ lbs} \times 3500 \text{ calories/lb} = 105000 \text{ calories}
     \]

2. **Determine the time frame from December 31st to July 19th.**
   - We need to calculate the number of days from December 31st to July 19th.
   - The breakdown of the months is as follows:
     - January: 31 days
     - February: 28 days (assuming it's not a leap year)
     - March: 31 days
     - April: 30 days
     - May: 31 days
     - June: 30 days
     - July: 19 days
   - Now, we add these days together:
     \[
     \text{Total days} = 31 + 28 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 30 + 19 =  31 + 28 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 30 + 19 =  31 + 28 = 59
     \]
     \[
     59 + 31 = 90
     \]
     \[
     90 + 30 = 120
     \]
     \[
     120 + 19 = 139
     \]
   - So, there are 200 days from December 31st to July 19th.

3. **Calculate the daily calorie deficit required.**
   - To find out how many calories Andy needs to burn each day to reach his goal, we divide the total calories he needs to burn by the number of days he has:
     \[
     \text{Daily calorie deficit} = \frac{\text{Total calories}}{\text{Total days}} = \frac{105000 \text{ calories}}{200 \text{ days}} = 525 \text{ calories/day}
     \]

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Andy needs to maintain a daily calorie deficit of **525 calories** to lose 30 lbs. by his birthday on July 19th.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{525}
\]
