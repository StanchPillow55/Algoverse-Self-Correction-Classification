To determine how much of a calorie deficit Andy needs each day to lose 30 lbs by his birthday on July 19th, we will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total calories needed to lose 30 lbs**:
   Since Andy needs to burn 3500 calories to lose 1 pound, we can calculate the total calories needed to lose 30 pounds as follows:

   \[
   \text{Total calories to lose} = 30 \text{ lbs} \times 3500 \text{ calories/lb} = 105000 \text{ calories}
   \]

2. **Determine the time frame**:
   Next, we need to find out how many days there are from December 31st to July 19th. 

   - **Days in January**: 31 days
   - **Days in February**: 28 days (2024 is not a leap year)
   - **Days in March**: 31 days
   - **Days in April**: 30 days
   - **Days in May**: 31 days
   - **Days in June**: 30 days
   - **Days in July**: 19 days

   Now, we sum these days:

   \[
   \text{Total days} = 31 + 28 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 30 + 19 =  31 + 28 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 30 + 19 =  31 + 28 = 59
   \]
   \[
   59 + 31 = 90
   \]
   \[
   90 + 30 = 120
   \]
   \[
   120 + 19 = 139
   \]

   So, there are 201 days from December 31st to July 19th.

3. **Calculate the daily calorie deficit**:
   To find out how much of a calorie deficit Andy needs each day, we divide the total calories he needs to burn by the number of days he has:

   \[
   \text{Daily calorie deficit} = \frac{\text{Total calories to lose}}{\text{Total days}} = \frac{105000 \text{ calories}}{201 \text{ days}} \approx 522.39 \text{ calories/day}
   \]

4. **Final Answer**:
   Rounding to the nearest whole number, Andy needs to have a daily calorie deficit of approximately:

   \[
   \boxed{522} \text{ calories/day}
   \]

This means Andy needs to burn about 522 more calories than he consumes each day to reach his goal of losing 30 lbs by his birthday on July 19th.
