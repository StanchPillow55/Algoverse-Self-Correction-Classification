==================================================

To determine how much of a calorie deficit Andy needs each day to lose 30 lbs by his birthday on July 19th, we will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of calories needed to lose 30 lbs.**
   - Since Andy needs to burn 3500 calories to lose 1 pound, we can calculate the total calories needed to lose 30 lbs:
   \[
   \text{Total calories} = 30 \text{ lbs} \times 3500 \text{ calories/lb} = 105000 \text{ calories}
   \]

2. **Determine the time frame from December 31st to July 19th.**
   - We need to calculate the number of days from December 31st to July 19th. 
   - The months and days are as follows:
     - January: 31 days
     - February: 28 days (assuming it's not a leap year)
     - March: 31 days
     - April: 30 days
     - May: 31 days
     - June: 30 days
     - July: 19 days
   - Now, we add these days together:
   \[
   \text{Total days} = 31 + 28 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 30 + 19 =  31 + 28 + 31 + 30 + 31 + 30 + 19 =  31 + 28 = 59
   \]
   \[
   59 + 31 = 90
   \]
   \[
   90 + 30 = 120
   \]
   \[
   120 + 19 = 139
   \]
   So, there are **200 days** from December 31st to July 19th.

3. **Calculate the daily calorie deficit required.**
   - To find the daily calorie deficit, we divide the total calories needed to lose 30 lbs by the number of days available:
   \[
   \text{Daily calorie deficit} = \frac{\text{Total calories}}{\text{Total days}} = \frac{105000 \text{ calories}}{200 \text{ days}} = 525 \text{ calories/day}
   \]

Thus, Andy needs to maintain a daily calorie deficit of **525 calories** to reach his goal of losing 30 lbs by his birthday on July 19th.

**Final Answer:** Andy needs a daily calorie deficit of **525 calories**.
