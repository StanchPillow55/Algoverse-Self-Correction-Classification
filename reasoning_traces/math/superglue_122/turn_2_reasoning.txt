==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 122" entails. Since the problem statement is not explicitly provided, I'll demonstrate a general approach to solving a typical math reasoning problem. Let's assume a hypothetical problem and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**
A train travels from City A to City B at a speed of 60 miles per hour. If the distance between City A and City B is 180 miles, how long does the journey take?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We need to find the time it takes for the train to travel from City A to City B.
   - We are given:
     - Speed of the train = 60 miles per hour
     - Distance between City A and City B = 180 miles

2. **Identify the Formula:**
   - The formula to calculate time when distance and speed are known is:
     \[
     \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}}
     \]

3. **Substitute the Given Values:**
   - Distance = 180 miles
   - Speed = 60 miles per hour
   - Substitute these values into the formula:
     \[
     \text{Time} = \frac{180 \text{ miles}}{60 \text{ miles per hour}}
     \]

4. **Calculate the Time:**
   - Perform the division:
     \[
     \text{Time} = \frac{180}{60} = 3 \text{ hours}
     \]

5. **Verify the Solution:**
   - To ensure the solution is correct, we can check the calculation:
     - If the train travels at 60 miles per hour, in 3 hours it would cover:
       \[
       60 \text{ miles/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 180 \text{ miles}
       \]
     - This matches the given distance, confirming our solution is correct.

6. **State the Final Answer:**
   - The journey from City A to City B takes 3 hours.

This step-by-step approach demonstrates how to solve a typical math reasoning problem involving distance, speed, and time. If you have a specific problem or need further assistance, please provide more details, and I'll be happy to help!
