==================================================

To solve the problem effectively, let's first understand what is being asked. The problem is titled "Sample reasoning question 122," but without specific details or numbers, it's challenging to provide a direct solution. However, I can guide you through a general approach to solving reasoning problems in mathematics.

### Step-by-Step Approach to Solving a Reasoning Problem:

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - Carefully read the problem statement.
   - Identify what is being asked.
   - Determine the known variables and the unknowns.

2. **Gather Information:**
   - List all given data and conditions.
   - Note any formulas or principles that might apply.

3. **Plan a Solution:**
   - Decide on a strategy to solve the problem. This could involve algebraic manipulation, drawing diagrams, logical reasoning, or applying specific mathematical theorems.

4. **Execute the Plan:**
   - Carry out the calculations or logical steps needed to solve the problem.
   - Be meticulous with each step to avoid errors.

5. **Check Your Work:**
   - Review each step to ensure accuracy.
   - Verify that the solution satisfies all conditions of the problem.

6. **State the Final Answer:**
   - Clearly present the solution, ensuring it addresses the question posed.

### Example Problem and Solution:

Since the original problem is unspecified, let's consider a generic example:

**Example Problem:**
A number is increased by 20% and then decreased by 20%. What is the final percentage change in the number?

**Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We start with an initial number, say \( x \).
   - The number is increased by 20%, making it \( x + 0.2x = 1.2x \).
   - Then, the new number is decreased by 20%.

2. **Plan a Solution:**
   - Calculate the decrease of 20% on the new number \( 1.2x \).

3. **Execute the Plan:**
   - Decrease \( 1.2x \) by 20%: 
     \[
     1.2x - 0.2 \times 1.2x = 1.2x - 0.24x = 0.96x
     \]

4. **Check Your Work:**
   - The final value is \( 0.96x \).
   - Compare this to the original value \( x \).

5. **Calculate the Percentage Change:**
   - The change from \( x \) to \( 0.96x \) is a decrease.
   - The percentage change is:
     \[
     \frac{x - 0.96x}{x} \times 100\% = \frac{0.04x}{x} \times 100\% = 4\%
     \]

6. **State the Final Answer:**
   - The final percentage change in the number is a decrease of 4%.

This example illustrates a structured approach to solving a reasoning problem in mathematics. If you have a specific problem or more details, please provide them, and I can offer a tailored solution.
