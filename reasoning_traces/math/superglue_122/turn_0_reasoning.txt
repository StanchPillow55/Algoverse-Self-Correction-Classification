==================================================

To solve the problem, I first need to understand the context and details of "Sample reasoning question 122." Since the problem statement is not provided, I'll demonstrate a general approach to solving a math problem by assuming a typical type of reasoning question. Let's assume a sample problem involving basic arithmetic and logical reasoning:

**Sample Problem:**
A farmer has a total of 100 animals, consisting of chickens and cows. If the total number of legs is 280, how many chickens and how many cows does the farmer have?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( c \) be the number of chickens.
   - Let \( w \) be the number of cows.

2. **Set Up Equations:**
   - We know the total number of animals is 100:
     \[
     c + w = 100
     \]
   - Chickens have 2 legs, and cows have 4 legs. The total number of legs is 280:
     \[
     2c + 4w = 280
     \]

3. **Solve the System of Equations:**
   - From the first equation, express \( c \) in terms of \( w \):
     \[
     c = 100 - w
     \]
   - Substitute \( c = 100 - w \) into the second equation:
     \[
     2(100 - w) + 4w = 280
     \]
   - Simplify and solve for \( w \):
     \[
     200 - 2w + 4w = 280
     \]
     \[
     200 + 2w = 280
     \]
     \[
     2w = 80
     \]
     \[
     w = 40
     \]

4. **Find the Number of Chickens:**
   - Substitute \( w = 40 \) back into the equation \( c = 100 - w \):
     \[
     c = 100 - 40 = 60
     \]

5. **Verify the Solution:**
   - Check the total number of legs:
     \[
     2c + 4w = 2(60) + 4(40) = 120 + 160 = 280
     \]
   - The calculations are consistent with the given conditions.

**Final Answer:**
The farmer has 60 chickens and 40 cows.
