==================================================

To solve a math problem, it's important to first understand the problem statement and identify what is being asked. However, the question provided, "Sample reasoning question 122," does not contain any specific mathematical problem or details to work through. It appears to be a placeholder or an incomplete question.

To proceed, let's assume a hypothetical math problem and solve it step by step. Let's consider the following example problem:

**Example Problem:**
A store sells apples at $2 each and oranges at $3 each. If a customer buys a total of 10 fruits consisting of apples and oranges and spends $25, how many apples and how many oranges did the customer buy?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( x \) be the number of apples.
   - Let \( y \) be the number of oranges.

2. **Set Up Equations:**
   - Since the total number of fruits is 10, we have the equation:
     \[
     x + y = 10
     \]
   - The total cost of the fruits is $25. The cost equation is:
     \[
     2x + 3y = 25
     \]

3. **Solve the System of Equations:**
   We have the following system of equations:
   \[
   \begin{align*}
   x + y &= 10 \quad \text{(Equation 1)} \\
   2x + 3y &= 25 \quad \text{(Equation 2)}
   \end{align*}
   \]

   - From Equation 1, express \( y \) in terms of \( x \):
     \[
     y = 10 - x
     \]

   - Substitute \( y = 10 - x \) into Equation 2:
     \[
     2x + 3(10 - x) = 25
     \]

   - Simplify and solve for \( x \):
     \[
     2x + 30 - 3x = 25
     \]
     \[
     -x + 30 = 25
     \]
     \[
     -x = 25 - 30
     \]
     \[
     -x = -5
     \]
     \[
     x = 5
     \]

   - Substitute \( x = 5 \) back into the expression for \( y \):
     \[
     y = 10 - x = 10 - 5 = 5
     \]

4. **Verify the Solution:**
   - Check the total number of fruits: \( x + y = 5 + 5 = 10 \) (correct).
   - Check the total cost: \( 2x + 3y = 2(5) + 3(5) = 10 + 15 = 25 \) (correct).

5. **State the Final Answer:**
   The customer bought 5 apples and 5 oranges.

This example illustrates how to approach a math problem by defining variables, setting up equations, solving the system of equations, and verifying the solution. If you have a specific problem or need further assistance, please provide more details.
