==================================================

To solve the problem effectively, let's first clarify the question. However, it seems that "Sample reasoning question 122" is not a specific math problem but rather a placeholder or reference to a specific question. Without the actual content of "Sample reasoning question 122," I can't provide a detailed solution.

However, I can guide you on how to approach a typical math problem using a structured reasoning process. Let's assume a generic math problem and work through it step by step.

### Example Problem:
Suppose we have the following problem: "Solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \)."

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We need to find the value of \( x \) that satisfies the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).

2. **Isolate the Variable:**
   - To solve for \( x \), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. Start by eliminating the constant term on the side with \( x \).
   - Subtract 3 from both sides of the equation:
     \[
     2x + 3 - 3 = 11 - 3
     \]
     \[
     2x = 8
     \]

3. **Solve for \( x \):**
   - Now, divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( x \):
     \[
     \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{8}{2}
     \]
     \[
     x = 4
     \]

4. **Verify the Solution:**
   - Substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies the equation:
     \[
     2(4) + 3 = 11
     \]
     \[
     8 + 3 = 11
     \]
   - Since both sides of the equation are equal, \( x = 4 \) is indeed the correct solution.

5. **State the Final Answer:**
   - The solution to the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \) is \( x = 4 \).

### Conclusion:
This structured approach can be applied to a variety of math problems. If you have a specific problem or need further assistance, please provide the details, and I'll be happy to help!
