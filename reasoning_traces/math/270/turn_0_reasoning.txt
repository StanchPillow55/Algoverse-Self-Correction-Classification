To solve the problem, we need to calculate Ayla's total phone bill for the month based on the number of customers she talks to, the duration of each call, and the cost per minute.

### Step 1: Determine the duration of each call in minutes.
Each call lasts for 1 hour. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we have:
\[
\text{Duration of each call} = 60 \text{ minutes}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the cost of each call.
The cost is charged at five cents per minute. Therefore, the cost for one call can be calculated as follows:
\[
\text{Cost per call} = \text{Duration in minutes} \times \text{Cost per minute}
\]
Substituting the values:
\[
\text{Cost per call} = 60 \text{ minutes} \times 0.05 \text{ dollars/minute} = 3 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Step 3: Determine the number of calls per week.
Ayla talks to 50 customers each week, which means she makes 50 calls per week.

### Step 4: Calculate the total cost per week.
To find the total cost for the calls made in one week, we multiply the cost per call by the number of calls:
\[
\text{Total cost per week} = \text{Cost per call} \times \text{Number of calls per week}
\]
Substituting the values:
\[
\text{Total cost per week} = 3 \text{ dollars/call} \times 50 \text{ calls/week} = 150 \text{ dollars/week}
\]

### Step 5: Calculate the total cost for the month.
Assuming there are 4 weeks in a month, we can calculate the total monthly cost:
\[
\text{Total monthly cost} = \text{Total cost per week} \times 4 \text{ weeks}
\]
Substituting the values:
\[
\text{Total monthly cost} = 150 \text{ dollars/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 600 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Final Answer
Thus, Ayla's phone bill at the end of the month is:
\[
\boxed{600 \text{ dollars}}
\]
