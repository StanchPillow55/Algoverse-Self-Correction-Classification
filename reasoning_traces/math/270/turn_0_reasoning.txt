To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total phone bill for Ayla at the end of the month based on the given information. Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Determine the Duration of Each Call:**
   - Each call lasts 1 hour.
   - Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, each call is 60 minutes long.

2. **Calculate the Cost of Each Call:**
   - The cost is five cents per minute.
   - Therefore, the cost for one call is:
     \[
     60 \text{ minutes} \times 5 \text{ cents per minute} = 300 \text{ cents}
     \]
   - Since 100 cents make up 1 dollar, we convert 300 cents to dollars:
     \[
     300 \text{ cents} = 3 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Determine the Number of Calls Per Week:**
   - Ayla talks to 50 customers each week.

4. **Calculate the Weekly Phone Bill:**
   - The cost for 50 calls in a week is:
     \[
     50 \text{ calls} \times 3 \text{ dollars per call} = 150 \text{ dollars}
     \]

5. **Determine the Number of Weeks in a Month:**
   - Typically, a month is considered to have about 4 weeks. However, for billing purposes, we will assume exactly 4 weeks in a month for simplicity.

6. **Calculate the Monthly Phone Bill:**
   - The total phone bill for the month is:
     \[
     4 \text{ weeks} \times 150 \text{ dollars per week} = 600 \text{ dollars}
     \]

Therefore, the phone bill at the end of the month is \(\boxed{600}\) dollars.
