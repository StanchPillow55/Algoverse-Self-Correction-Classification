Question ID: superglue_422
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem effectively, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 422" entails. Since the problem statement is not explicitly provided, I'll assume it's a hypothetical math problem and demonstrate a structured approach to solving a typical math problem.

### Step 1: Understand the Problem
Since the problem is not explicitly stated, let's assume a sample math problem for demonstration purposes:

**Problem:** Calculate the sum of the first 10 positive integers.

### Step 2: Devise a Plan
To solve this problem, we can use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series. The sum \( S \) of the first \( n \) positive integers is given by the formula:
\[ S = \frac{n(n + 1)}{2} \]

### Step 3: Carry Out the Plan
Here, \( n = 10 \) because we want the sum of the first 10 positive integers.

Substitute \( n = 10 \) into the formula:
\[ S = \frac{10(10 + 1)}{2} \]

Calculate the expression:
\[ S = \frac{10 \times 11}{2} \]
\[ S = \frac{110}{2} \]
\[ S = 55 \]

### Step 4: Look Back
Verify the result by adding the numbers directly:
\[ 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 10 = 55 \]

The direct addition confirms that our formula and calculations are correct.

### Final Answer
The sum of the first 10 positive integers is 55.

This structured approach can be applied to various math problems by understanding the problem, devising a plan, carrying out the plan, and verifying the solution. If you have a specific problem or need further assistance, please provide more details.
