Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 422" refers to. Since the problem statement is not clear and does not provide specific details or numbers, I will assume this is a placeholder for a generic math problem. 

To demonstrate a complete reasoning process, let's consider a hypothetical math problem and solve it step by step. Let's assume the problem is as follows:

**Problem:** Solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).

**Step 1: Understand the Equation**

The equation given is \( 2x + 3 = 11 \). This is a linear equation in one variable, \( x \).

**Step 2: Isolate the Variable**

To solve for \( x \), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We can do this by performing inverse operations.

1. Subtract 3 from both sides of the equation to eliminate the constant term on the left side:

   \[
   2x + 3 - 3 = 11 - 3
   \]

   Simplifying both sides gives:

   \[
   2x = 8
   \]

2. Next, divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( x \):

   \[
   \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{8}{2}
   \]

   Simplifying both sides gives:

   \[
   x = 4
   \]

**Step 3: Verify the Solution**

To ensure our solution is correct, we substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation:

\[
2(4) + 3 = 11
\]

Simplifying the left side:

\[
8 + 3 = 11
\]

Since both sides of the equation are equal, our solution \( x = 4 \) is verified.

**Final Answer:**

The solution to the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \) is \( x = 4 \).

This process demonstrates a complete reasoning and solution for a linear equation. If "Sample reasoning question 422" refers to a different problem, please provide additional details for a specific solution.
