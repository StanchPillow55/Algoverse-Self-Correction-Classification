==================================================

It seems like you've referenced a "Sample reasoning question 422," but without the specific details of the problem, I can't provide a solution. However, I can guide you on how to approach solving a math problem step by step. If you provide the details of the problem, I can give a more specific solution. Here's a general approach to solving math problems:

### Step-by-Step Approach to Solving Math Problems

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - Read the problem carefully.
   - Identify what is being asked.
   - Determine what information is given and what needs to be found.

2. **Devise a Plan:**
   - Consider possible strategies to solve the problem (e.g., drawing a diagram, creating an equation, using a formula).
   - Choose the most appropriate method based on the problem type.

3. **Carry Out the Plan:**
   - Execute the chosen strategy step by step.
   - Perform calculations carefully.
   - Keep track of units and ensure consistency.

4. **Check Your Work:**
   - Review each step to ensure accuracy.
   - Verify that the solution makes sense in the context of the problem.
   - Check calculations and consider alternative methods to confirm the result.

5. **State the Final Answer:**
   - Clearly write the final answer.
   - Include units if applicable.

### Example Problem

Let's solve a simple example problem using this approach:

**Problem:** Solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).

**Step 1: Understand the Problem**
- We need to find the value of \( x \) that satisfies the equation.

**Step 2: Devise a Plan**
- We can solve this linear equation by isolating \( x \).

**Step 3: Carry Out the Plan**
- Start by subtracting 3 from both sides of the equation:
  \[
  2x + 3 - 3 = 11 - 3
  \]
  \[
  2x = 8
  \]
- Next, divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( x \):
  \[
  \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{8}{2}
  \]
  \[
  x = 4
  \]

**Step 4: Check Your Work**
- Substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation to verify:
  \[
  2(4) + 3 = 8 + 3 = 11
  \]
- The left side equals the right side, confirming our solution is correct.

**Step 5: State the Final Answer**
- The solution to the equation is \( x = 4 \).
