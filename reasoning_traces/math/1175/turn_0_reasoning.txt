==================================================

To solve the problem, we will break it down into parts based on the information given about the goals scored by each team in both halves of the match.

### Step 1: Goals Scored in the First Half

- **Team A** scores 4 goals.
- **Team B** scores 2 goals fewer than Team A. Therefore, the number of goals scored by Team B in the first half is:
  \[
  \text{Goals by Team B} = \text{Goals by Team A} - 2 = 4 - 2 = 2
  \]

### Step 2: Goals Scored in the Second Half

Next, we need to determine how many goals Team B scores in the second half.

- Team B scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half. Since Team B scored 2 goals in the first half, the number of goals scored by Team B in the second half is:
  \[
  \text{Goals by Team B in second half} = 4 \times \text{Goals by Team B in first half} = 4 \times 2 = 8
  \]

Now we need to find out how many goals Team A scores in the second half. According to the problem, Team A scores \( \frac{1}{4} \) of the number of goals scored by Team B in the second half. Since Team B scored 8 goals in the second half, the number of goals scored by Team A in the second half is:
\[
\text{Goals by Team A in second half} = \frac{1}{4} \times \text{Goals by Team B in second half} = \frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2
\]

### Step 3: Total Goals Scored in the Match

Now we can calculate the total number of goals scored by both teams in the entire match.

- Total goals scored by Team A:
  \[
  \text{Total Goals by Team A} = \text{Goals in first half} + \text{Goals in second half} = 4 + 2 = 6
  \]

- Total goals scored by Team B:
  \[
  \text{Total Goals by Team B} = \text{Goals in first half} + \text{Goals in second half} = 2 + 8 = 10
  \]

Finally, we can find the total number of goals scored in the match:
\[
\text{Total Goals in Match} = \text{Total Goals by Team A} + \text{Total Goals by Team B} = 6 + 10 = 16
\]

### Final Answer
The total number of goals scored in the match is \( \boxed{16} \).
