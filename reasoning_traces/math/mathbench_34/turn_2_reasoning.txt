Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we first need to understand what "Sample math problem 34" refers to. However, without specific details about the problem, I'll demonstrate a general approach to solving a typical math problem. Let's assume "Sample math problem 34" is a typical algebra problem. Here's how we might approach it:

**Sample Problem:**
Solve for \( x \) in the equation: \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   We need to find the value of \( x \) that makes the equation true.

2. **Isolate the Variable:**
   To solve for \( x \), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. The equation is:
   \[
   2x + 3 = 11
   \]

3. **Subtract 3 from Both Sides:**
   To get rid of the +3 on the left side, subtract 3 from both sides:
   \[
   2x + 3 - 3 = 11 - 3
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   2x = 8
   \]

4. **Divide Both Sides by 2:**
   To solve for \( x \), divide both sides by 2:
   \[
   \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{8}{2}
   \]
   Simplifying gives:
   \[
   x = 4
   \]

5. **Verify the Solution:**
   Substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies the equation:
   \[
   2(4) + 3 = 11
   \]
   Simplifying the left side gives:
   \[
   8 + 3 = 11
   \]
   Since both sides are equal, \( x = 4 \) is indeed the correct solution.

**Final Answer:**
The solution to the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \) is \( x = 4 \).

If "Sample math problem 34" refers to a different problem, please provide the specific details or context of the problem for a tailored solution.
