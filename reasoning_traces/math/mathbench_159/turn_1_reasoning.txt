==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 159," we need to first understand what the problem is asking. However, the problem statement "Sample math problem 159" is not clear or specific enough to determine what the actual math problem is. It seems like a placeholder or reference to a specific problem that is not provided here.

Since I do not have the details of "Sample math problem 159," I will demonstrate how to solve a generic math problem by walking through an example. Let's assume the problem involves solving a quadratic equation, which is a common type of math problem.

### Example Problem:
Solve the quadratic equation: \( 2x^2 - 4x - 6 = 0 \).

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Identify the quadratic equation**:
   The given equation is \( 2x^2 - 4x - 6 = 0 \).

2. **Simplify the equation**:
   Check if the equation can be simplified by dividing all terms by a common factor. In this case, all terms are divisible by 2:
   \[
   \frac{2x^2}{2} - \frac{4x}{2} - \frac{6}{2} = 0 \implies x^2 - 2x - 3 = 0
   \]

3. **Factor the quadratic equation**:
   We need to find two numbers that multiply to -3 (the constant term) and add to -2 (the coefficient of the linear term). The numbers -3 and 1 satisfy these conditions:
   \[
   x^2 - 2x - 3 = (x - 3)(x + 1) = 0
   \]

4. **Solve for the roots**:
   Set each factor equal to zero and solve for \( x \):
   \[
   x - 3 = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad x + 1 = 0
   \]
   Solving these gives:
   \[
   x = 3 \quad \text{or} \quad x = -1
   \]

5. **Verify the solutions**:
   Substitute \( x = 3 \) and \( x = -1 \) back into the original equation to ensure they satisfy it:
   - For \( x = 3 \):
     \[
     2(3)^2 - 4(3) - 6 = 18 - 12 - 6 = 0
     \]
   - For \( x = -1 \):
     \[
     2(-1)^2 - 4(-1) - 6 = 2 + 4 - 6 = 0
     \]

Both solutions satisfy the original equation.

### Final Answer:
The solutions to the quadratic equation \( 2x^2 - 4x - 6 = 0 \) are \( x = 3 \) and \( x = -1 \).
