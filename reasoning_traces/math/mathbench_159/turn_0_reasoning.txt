==================================================

It seems like "Sample math problem 159" is a placeholder or reference to a specific problem that isn't provided here. To solve a math problem, I would need the details of the problem itself. However, I can guide you through a generic process of solving a math problem by providing a hypothetical example. Let's assume a typical algebra problem:

**Example Problem:**
Solve for \( x \) in the equation: \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We are given the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).
   - Our goal is to solve for \( x \).

2. **Isolate the Variable:**
   - To solve for \( x \), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation.
   - Start by eliminating the constant term on the left side. We do this by subtracting 3 from both sides of the equation.

   \[
   2x + 3 - 3 = 11 - 3
   \]

   Simplifying both sides gives:

   \[
   2x = 8
   \]

3. **Solve for \( x \):**
   - Now, we need to isolate \( x \) by dividing both sides by 2.

   \[
   \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{8}{2}
   \]

   Simplifying both sides gives:

   \[
   x = 4
   \]

4. **Verify the Solution:**
   - Substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies the equation.

   \[
   2(4) + 3 = 11
   \]

   Simplifying the left side gives:

   \[
   8 + 3 = 11
   \]

   Since both sides of the equation are equal, our solution \( x = 4 \) is correct.

5. **State the Final Answer:**
   - The solution to the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \) is \( x = 4 \).
