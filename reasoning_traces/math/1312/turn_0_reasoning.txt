==================================================

To find out how much Tom's restaurant makes in a week, we need to calculate the total revenue generated from the reservations over the days they are open.

### Step 1: Calculate the total revenue from one reservation

Each reservation consists of:
- 2 meals at $5 each
- 1 bottle of wine at $5

First, we calculate the total cost for the meals:
\[
\text{Total cost of meals} = 2 \text{ meals} \times 5 \text{ dollars/meal} = 10 \text{ dollars}
\]

Next, we add the cost of the wine:
\[
\text{Total cost of wine} = 1 \text{ bottle} \times 5 \text{ dollars/bottle} = 5 \text{ dollars}
\]

Now, we can find the total revenue from one reservation:
\[
\text{Total revenue per reservation} = \text{Total cost of meals} + \text{Total cost of wine} = 10 \text{ dollars} + 5 \text{ dollars} = 15 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the total revenue for one night

Tom's restaurant gets 6 reservations a night. Therefore, the total revenue for one night is:
\[
\text{Total revenue per night} = \text{Total revenue per reservation} \times \text{Number of reservations}
\]
\[
\text{Total revenue per night} = 15 \text{ dollars/reservation} \times 6 \text{ reservations} = 90 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the total revenue for a week

Tom's restaurant is open 2 days a week. Thus, the total revenue for the week is:
\[
\text{Total revenue per week} = \text{Total revenue per night} \times \text{Number of days open}
\]
\[
\text{Total revenue per week} = 90 \text{ dollars/night} \times 2 \text{ days} = 180 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Final Answer

The total revenue that Tom's restaurant makes in a week is:
\[
\boxed{180 \text{ dollars}}
\]
