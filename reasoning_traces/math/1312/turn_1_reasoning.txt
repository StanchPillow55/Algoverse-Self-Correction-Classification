==================================================

To find out how much Tom's restaurant makes in a week, we need to calculate the total revenue generated from reservations over the course of a week.

1. **Calculate the total number of reservations per week:**
   - The restaurant gets 6 reservations a night.
   - They are open 2 days a week.
   \[
   \text{Total reservations per week} = 6 \text{ reservations/night} \times 2 \text{ nights/week} = 12 \text{ reservations/week}
   \]

2. **Calculate the total revenue from each reservation:**
   - Each reservation orders 2 meals that cost $5 each:
   \[
   \text{Cost of meals per reservation} = 2 \text{ meals} \times 5 \text{ dollars/meal} = 10 \text{ dollars}
   \]
   - Each reservation also orders a bottle of wine that costs $5:
   \[
   \text{Cost of wine per reservation} = 5 \text{ dollars}
   \]
   - Therefore, the total cost per reservation is:
   \[
   \text{Total cost per reservation} = 10 \text{ dollars (meals)} + 5 \text{ dollars (wine)} = 15 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total revenue for the week:**
   - Now, we multiply the total number of reservations by the total cost per reservation:
   \[
   \text{Total revenue per week} = 12 \text{ reservations/week} \times 15 \text{ dollars/reservation} = 180 \text{ dollars/week}
   \]

Thus, the total revenue that Tom's restaurant makes in a week is **$180**. 

Final answer: **$180**.
