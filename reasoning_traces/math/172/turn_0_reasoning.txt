==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of origami stars Kyle must make to fill all the glass bottles he bought.

**Step 1: Determine the capacity of one glass bottle.**

We are told that each glass bottle can hold 15 origami stars.

**Step 2: Calculate the total number of bottles Kyle bought.**

Kyle initially bought 2 glass bottles and then bought another 3 identical glass bottles. To find the total number of bottles, we add these two quantities together:

\[
2 \text{ bottles} + 3 \text{ bottles} = 5 \text{ bottles}
\]

**Step 3: Calculate the total number of origami stars needed to fill all the bottles.**

Since each bottle can hold 15 origami stars, and Kyle has a total of 5 bottles, we multiply the number of bottles by the number of stars each bottle can hold:

\[
5 \text{ bottles} \times 15 \text{ stars per bottle} = 75 \text{ stars}
\]

**Conclusion:**

Kyle must make a total of 75 origami stars to fill all the glass bottles he bought.

**Final Answer:**

Kyle must make 75 origami stars.
