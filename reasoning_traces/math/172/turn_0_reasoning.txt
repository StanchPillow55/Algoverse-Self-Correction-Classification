==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to determine the ages of each of the four birds: Sally Two, Granny Red, Sally Four, and Sally Thirtytwo. We will use the information given in the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the age of Sally Thirtytwo**:
   - We are told that Sally Thirtytwo is 8 years old.
   \[
   \text{Age of Sally Thirtytwo} = 8 \text{ years}
   \]

2. **Determine the age of Sally Four**:
   - The problem states that Sally Four is the same age as Sally Thirtytwo.
   \[
   \text{Age of Sally Four} = \text{Age of Sally Thirtytwo} = 8 \text{ years}
   \]

3. **Determine the age of Granny Red**:
   - We know that Granny Red is two times as old as Sally Four.
   \[
   \text{Age of Granny Red} = 2 \times \text{Age of Sally Four} = 2 \times 8 = 16 \text{ years}
   \]

4. **Determine the age of Sally Two**:
   - The problem states that Sally Two is three years older than Granny Red.
   \[
   \text{Age of Sally Two} = \text{Age of Granny Red} + 3 = 16 + 3 = 19 \text{ years}
   \]

5. **Calculate the total age of the four birds**:
   - Now we can find the total age by adding the ages of all four birds together:
   \[
   \text{Total age} = \text{Age of Sally Two} + \text{Age of Granny Red} + \text{Age of Sally Four} + \text{Age of Sally Thirtytwo}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total age} = 19 + 16 + 8 + 8
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total age} = 51 \text{ years}
   \]

Thus, the total age of the four birds is \( \boxed{51} \) years.
