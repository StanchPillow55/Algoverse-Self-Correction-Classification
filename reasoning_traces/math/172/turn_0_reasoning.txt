To determine how many origami stars Kyle needs to make to fill all the glass bottles he bought, we can break the problem down step by step.

1. **Identify the number of bottles and their capacity**:
   - Kyle bought 2 glass bottles that can hold 15 origami stars each.
   - He also bought an additional 3 identical glass bottles.

2. **Calculate the total number of bottles**:
   - Total bottles = 2 (initial bottles) + 3 (additional bottles) = 5 bottles.

3. **Calculate the total capacity of all the bottles**:
   - Each bottle can hold 15 stars.
   - Therefore, the total capacity for all 5 bottles is calculated as follows:
     \[
     \text{Total capacity} = \text{Number of bottles} \times \text{Capacity of each bottle}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total capacity} = 5 \text{ bottles} \times 15 \text{ stars/bottle} = 75 \text{ stars}
     \]

4. **Conclusion**:
   - To fill all the glass bottles, Kyle must make a total of 75 origami stars.

Thus, the final answer is that Kyle must make **75 origami stars** to fill all the glass bottles he bought.
