Question ID: superglue_159
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 159" refers to. Since the problem statement is not explicitly provided, I'll assume this is a placeholder for a specific math problem. Without the actual problem, I can't provide a precise solution, but I can guide you on how to approach solving a math problem using a structured reasoning process.

### General Approach to Solving Math Problems

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - Read the problem carefully.
   - Identify what is being asked.
   - Determine what information is given and what needs to be found.

2. **Devise a Plan:**
   - Think about the mathematical concepts that apply to the problem.
   - Consider different strategies, such as drawing a diagram, creating an equation, or breaking the problem into smaller parts.

3. **Carry Out the Plan:**
   - Execute the steps you have planned.
   - Perform calculations carefully.
   - Keep track of units and ensure consistency.

4. **Check Your Work:**
   - Review each step to ensure accuracy.
   - Verify that the solution makes sense in the context of the problem.
   - Check calculations and consider alternative approaches to confirm the result.

5. **State the Final Answer:**
   - Clearly present the solution.
   - Include units if applicable.

### Example Problem and Solution

Since I don't have the specific problem, I'll demonstrate this process with a generic example:

**Example Problem:**
A rectangle has a length that is twice its width. If the perimeter of the rectangle is 36 units, what are the dimensions of the rectangle?

**Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We need to find the length and width of the rectangle.
   - The perimeter is given as 36 units.
   - The length is twice the width.

2. **Devise a Plan:**
   - Use the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle: \( P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width}) \).
   - Let the width be \( w \).
   - Then the length is \( 2w \).
   - Substitute these into the perimeter formula.

3. **Carry Out the Plan:**
   \[
   36 = 2 \times (2w + w)
   \]
   \[
   36 = 2 \times 3w
   \]
   \[
   36 = 6w
   \]
   \[
   w = \frac{36}{6} = 6
   \]
   - The width is 6 units.
   - The length is \( 2 \times 6 = 12 \) units.

4. **Check Your Work:**
   - Calculate the perimeter with these dimensions: \( 2 \times (12 + 6) = 2 \times 18 = 36 \).
   - The calculations are consistent with the given perimeter.

5. **State the Final Answer:**
   - The dimensions of the rectangle are 12 units by 6 units.

If you have a specific problem (like "Sample reasoning question 159"), please provide the details, and I can work through that particular problem for you.
