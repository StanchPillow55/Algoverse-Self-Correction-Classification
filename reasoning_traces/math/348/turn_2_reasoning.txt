Question ID: 348
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To find out how much more the factory is making per day now compared to when they were making tractors, we will calculate the daily revenue from both tractors and silos, and then determine the percentage increase.

### Step 1: Calculate the daily revenue from tractors.

- **Number of tractors sold per day**: 10
- **Price per tractor**: $100

Daily revenue from tractors:
\[
\text{Revenue from tractors} = \text{Number of tractors} \times \text{Price per tractor} = 10 \times 100 = 1000 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the daily revenue from silos.

- **Number of silos sold per day**: 5
- **Price per silo**: $220

Daily revenue from silos:
\[
\text{Revenue from silos} = \text{Number of silos} \times \text{Price per silo} = 5 \times 220 = 1100 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the increase in daily revenue.

To find the increase in revenue:
\[
\text{Increase in revenue} = \text{Revenue from silos} - \text{Revenue from tractors} = 1100 - 1000 = 100 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the percentage increase in revenue.

To find the percentage increase:
\[
\text{Percentage increase} = \left( \frac{\text{Increase in revenue}}{\text{Revenue from tractors}} \right) \times 100
\]
Substituting the values:
\[
\text{Percentage increase} = \left( \frac{100}{1000} \right) \times 100 = 10\%
\]

### Final Answer:
The factory is making **10% more** per day now.
