==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to track the progression of how long Brian can hold his breath over the course of three weeks, given the improvements he makes each week.

**Initial Condition:**
- Initially, Brian can hold his breath for 10 seconds.

**Week 1:**
- After the first week, Brian doubles the amount of time he can hold his breath.
- Calculation: \(10 \text{ seconds} \times 2 = 20 \text{ seconds}\)

**Week 2:**
- After the second week, he doubles the time again from the previous week.
- Calculation: \(20 \text{ seconds} \times 2 = 40 \text{ seconds}\)

**Week 3:**
- In the final week, he increases his breath-holding time by 50% from the previous week.
- To find 50% of 40 seconds, we calculate: \(40 \text{ seconds} \times 0.50 = 20 \text{ seconds}\)
- Therefore, the new time he can hold his breath is: \(40 \text{ seconds} + 20 \text{ seconds} = 60 \text{ seconds}\)

**Conclusion:**
After three weeks of practice, Brian can now hold his breath for 60 seconds.

**Final Answer:**
Brian can hold his breath for 60 seconds.
