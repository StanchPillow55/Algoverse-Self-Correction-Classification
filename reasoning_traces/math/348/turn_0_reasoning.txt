Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial Time**: Brian can hold his breath for 10 seconds initially.

2. **After the First Week**: He doubles the time he can hold his breath.
   \[
   \text{Time after week 1} = 10 \text{ seconds} \times 2 = 20 \text{ seconds}
   \]

3. **After the Second Week**: He doubles the time again from the previous week.
   \[
   \text{Time after week 2} = 20 \text{ seconds} \times 2 = 40 \text{ seconds}
   \]

4. **After the Third Week**: He increases the time by 50% from the previous week.
   To find 50% of the time from week 2:
   \[
   50\% \text{ of } 40 \text{ seconds} = 0.5 \times 40 = 20 \text{ seconds}
   \]
   Now, we add this increase to the time from week 2:
   \[
   \text{Time after week 3} = 40 \text{ seconds} + 20 \text{ seconds} = 60 \text{ seconds}
   \]

Now, we summarize the results:
- After week 1, Brian can hold his breath for 20 seconds.
- After week 2, he can hold it for 40 seconds.
- After week 3, he can hold it for 60 seconds.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{60 \text{ seconds}}
\]
