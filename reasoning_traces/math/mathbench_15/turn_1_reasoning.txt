==================================================

To solve "Sample math problem 15," we first need to understand the problem. However, since the problem statement is not provided, I'll create a hypothetical math problem labeled as "Sample math problem 15" and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**

"Sample math problem 15: A rectangle has a length that is 3 times its width. If the perimeter of the rectangle is 48 units, what are the dimensions of the rectangle?"

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We are given that the length \( L \) of the rectangle is 3 times its width \( W \).
   - The perimeter \( P \) of the rectangle is 48 units.

2. **Set Up the Equations:**
   - The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is:
     \[
     P = 2L + 2W
     \]
   - Substitute the given perimeter:
     \[
     48 = 2L + 2W
     \]
   - We are also given that \( L = 3W \).

3. **Substitute and Solve for \( W \):**
   - Substitute \( L = 3W \) into the perimeter equation:
     \[
     48 = 2(3W) + 2W
     \]
   - Simplify the equation:
     \[
     48 = 6W + 2W
     \]
     \[
     48 = 8W
     \]
   - Solve for \( W \):
     \[
     W = \frac{48}{8} = 6
     \]

4. **Find the Length \( L \):**
   - Since \( L = 3W \):
     \[
     L = 3 \times 6 = 18
     \]

5. **Verify the Solution:**
   - Check if the dimensions satisfy the perimeter equation:
     \[
     P = 2L + 2W = 2(18) + 2(6) = 36 + 12 = 48
     \]
   - The calculated perimeter matches the given perimeter, confirming our solution is correct.

**Final Answer:**
The dimensions of the rectangle are:
- Width \( W = 6 \) units
- Length \( L = 18 \) units
