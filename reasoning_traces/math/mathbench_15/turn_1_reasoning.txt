==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 15," we need to first understand what the problem is asking. Since the problem is not explicitly stated, I will assume it involves some basic arithmetic or algebraic operations involving the number 15. Let's consider a few possibilities:

### Possibility 1: Basic Arithmetic Operations

1. **Addition**: What is 15 + 10?
   - Calculation: \( 15 + 10 = 25 \)
   - Explanation: We simply add 10 to 15.

2. **Subtraction**: What is 15 - 5?
   - Calculation: \( 15 - 5 = 10 \)
   - Explanation: We subtract 5 from 15.

3. **Multiplication**: What is 15 \(\times\) 3?
   - Calculation: \( 15 \times 3 = 45 \)
   - Explanation: We multiply 15 by 3.

4. **Division**: What is 15 รท 3?
   - Calculation: \( 15 \div 3 = 5 \)
   - Explanation: We divide 15 by 3.

### Possibility 2: Algebraic Expression

Suppose the problem involves solving an algebraic equation with 15. For example, solve for \( x \) in the equation \( x + 15 = 30 \).

- **Step 1**: Isolate \( x \) by subtracting 15 from both sides of the equation.
  \[
  x + 15 - 15 = 30 - 15
  \]
- **Step 2**: Simplify the equation.
  \[
  x = 15
  \]
- **Explanation**: We subtracted 15 from both sides to solve for \( x \).

### Possibility 3: Word Problem

If the problem is a word problem involving 15, let's consider an example:

- **Problem**: If you have 15 apples and you give away 7, how many apples do you have left?
  - **Calculation**: \( 15 - 7 = 8 \)
  - **Explanation**: You start with 15 apples and give away 7, leaving you with 8 apples.

### Conclusion

Since the problem "Sample math problem 15" is not clearly defined, I have explored several potential interpretations involving the number 15. Each scenario involves basic arithmetic or algebraic reasoning. If you have a specific problem in mind, please provide more details for a precise solution.

**Final Answer**: Without a specific problem statement, the final answer depends on the context. If you provide more details, I can give a more accurate solution.
