==================================================

It seems like you've mentioned "Sample math problem 15," but you haven't provided the specific details of the math problem you want me to solve. To assist you effectively, I'll need the full details of the problem. 

However, I can guide you through a generic approach to solving a math problem. Let's assume a simple math problem for demonstration purposes:

**Problem:** Solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 2x + 3 = 15 \).

**Step-by-step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Equation:**
   The equation given is \( 2x + 3 = 15 \). This is a linear equation in one variable, \( x \).

2. **Isolate the Variable:**
   To solve for \( x \), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We can do this by performing inverse operations.

3. **Subtract 3 from Both Sides:**
   \[
   2x + 3 - 3 = 15 - 3
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   2x = 12
   \]

4. **Divide Both Sides by 2:**
   \[
   \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{12}{2}
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   x = 6
   \]

5. **Verify the Solution:**
   Substitute \( x = 6 \) back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies the equation:
   \[
   2(6) + 3 = 15
   \]
   Simplifying the left side gives:
   \[
   12 + 3 = 15
   \]
   \[
   15 = 15
   \]
   Since both sides of the equation are equal, our solution is verified.

**Final Answer:**
The solution to the equation \( 2x + 3 = 15 \) is \( x = 6 \).

If you have a specific problem in mind, please provide the details, and I'll be happy to help you solve it!
