==================================================

To solve the sample math problem labeled as "252," we first need to understand what the problem is asking. However, since "252" is not a complete problem statement, I'll assume you want to analyze the number 252 in various mathematical contexts. Let's explore some possibilities:

### 1. **Prime Factorization of 252**

To find the prime factorization of 252, we start by dividing it by the smallest prime number, which is 2, and continue the process with the resulting quotient:

- \( 252 \div 2 = 126 \)
- \( 126 \div 2 = 63 \)

63 is not divisible by 2, so we move to the next smallest prime number, which is 3:

- \( 63 \div 3 = 21 \)
- \( 21 \div 3 = 7 \)

Finally, 7 is a prime number. Therefore, the prime factorization of 252 is:

\[ 252 = 2^2 \times 3^2 \times 7 \]

### 2. **Divisors of 252**

Using the prime factorization, we can determine the number of divisors. If a number \( n \) has the prime factorization \( p_1^{a_1} \times p_2^{a_2} \times \ldots \times p_k^{a_k} \), the number of divisors is given by:

\[ (a_1 + 1)(a_2 + 1) \ldots (a_k + 1) \]

For 252, the prime factorization is \( 2^2 \times 3^2 \times 7^1 \). Thus, the number of divisors is:

\[ (2 + 1)(2 + 1)(1 + 1) = 3 \times 3 \times 2 = 18 \]

### 3. **Sum of Divisors of 252**

To find the sum of all divisors, use the formula for the sum of divisors based on the prime factorization:

\[ \sigma(n) = (1 + p_1 + p_1^2 + \ldots + p_1^{a_1})(1 + p_2 + \ldots + p_2^{a_2}) \ldots (1 + p_k + \ldots + p_k^{a_k}) \]

For 252:

\[ \sigma(252) = (1 + 2 + 4)(1 + 3 + 9)(1 + 7) \]

Calculating each term:

- \( 1 + 2 + 4 = 7 \)
- \( 1 + 3 + 9 = 13 \)
- \( 1 + 7 = 8 \)

Thus, the sum of the divisors is:

\[ 7 \times 13 \times 8 = 728 \]

### 4. **Properties of 252**

- **Even Number**: 252 is even because it is divisible by 2.
- **Composite Number**: 252 is composite because it has divisors other than 1 and itself.
- **Perfect Square**: 252 is not a perfect square, as no integer squared equals 252.

### Final Answer

The prime factorization of 252 is \( 2^2 \times 3^2 \times 7 \). It has 18 divisors, and the sum of its divisors is 728.
