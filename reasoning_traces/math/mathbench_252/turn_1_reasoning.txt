==================================================

To solve the problem, we first need to understand what "Sample math problem 252" refers to. Since no specific problem is provided, I'll assume it's a placeholder for a typical math problem. Let's create a problem based on the number 252 and solve it.

**Problem:**
Find the prime factorization of 252 and determine the number of divisors it has.

**Step 1: Prime Factorization of 252**

To find the prime factorization, we start by dividing 252 by the smallest prime number, which is 2, and continue dividing the quotient by prime numbers until we reach 1.

1. **Divide by 2:**
   \[
   252 \div 2 = 126
   \]
   So, 252 = 2 × 126.

2. **Divide 126 by 2:**
   \[
   126 \div 2 = 63
   \]
   So, 126 = 2 × 63, and therefore 252 = 2 × 2 × 63.

3. **Divide 63 by 3:**
   \[
   63 \div 3 = 21
   \]
   So, 63 = 3 × 21, and therefore 252 = 2 × 2 × 3 × 21.

4. **Divide 21 by 3:**
   \[
   21 \div 3 = 7
   \]
   So, 21 = 3 × 7, and therefore 252 = 2 × 2 × 3 × 3 × 7.

Now, we have the prime factorization of 252:
\[
252 = 2^2 \times 3^2 \times 7^1
\]

**Step 2: Determine the Number of Divisors**

To find the number of divisors of a number, use the formula based on its prime factorization. If the prime factorization of a number \( n \) is \( p_1^{a_1} \times p_2^{a_2} \times \ldots \times p_k^{a_k} \), then the number of divisors \( D(n) \) is given by:
\[
D(n) = (a_1 + 1)(a_2 + 1) \ldots (a_k + 1)
\]

For 252, the prime factorization is \( 2^2 \times 3^2 \times 7^1 \). Therefore, the number of divisors is:
\[
D(252) = (2 + 1)(2 + 1)(1 + 1) = 3 \times 3 \times 2 = 18
\]

**Final Answer:**

The prime factorization of 252 is \( 2^2 \times 3^2 \times 7^1 \), and it has 18 divisors.
