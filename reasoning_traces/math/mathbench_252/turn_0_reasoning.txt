==================================================

It seems like the problem statement "Sample math problem 252" is not clear or specific enough to determine what the actual math problem is. However, I can guide you through a generic approach to solving a math problem, assuming it involves basic arithmetic or algebra. If you have a specific problem in mind, please provide more details. For now, I'll create a sample problem based on the number 252 and solve it.

**Sample Problem:**

Let's assume the problem is to find the prime factorization of the number 252.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Identify if the number is even or odd:**
   - 252 is an even number because it ends in 2. Therefore, it is divisible by 2.

2. **Divide by 2:**
   - \( 252 \div 2 = 126 \)

3. **Check if the quotient is even or odd:**
   - 126 is also even, so it is divisible by 2.

4. **Divide by 2 again:**
   - \( 126 \div 2 = 63 \)

5. **Check if the new quotient is even or odd:**
   - 63 is odd, so it is not divisible by 2. Check the next smallest prime number, which is 3.

6. **Check divisibility by 3:**
   - A number is divisible by 3 if the sum of its digits is divisible by 3. The sum of the digits of 63 is \( 6 + 3 = 9 \), which is divisible by 3.

7. **Divide by 3:**
   - \( 63 \div 3 = 21 \)

8. **Repeat the divisibility check for 21:**
   - The sum of the digits of 21 is \( 2 + 1 = 3 \), which is divisible by 3.

9. **Divide by 3 again:**
   - \( 21 \div 3 = 7 \)

10. **Check if 7 is a prime number:**
    - 7 is a prime number because it has no divisors other than 1 and itself.

**Prime Factorization:**

- The prime factorization of 252 is \( 2^2 \times 3^2 \times 7 \).

**Final Answer:**

The prime factorization of 252 is \( 2^2 \times 3^2 \times 7 \).
