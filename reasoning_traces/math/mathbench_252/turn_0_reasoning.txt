==================================================

It seems like the problem statement is incomplete or unclear. "Sample math problem 252" does not provide enough information to determine what the problem is asking. However, I can guide you through a generic approach to solving a math problem if you provide more details or specify the type of problem you're dealing with (e.g., algebra, geometry, calculus, etc.).

If "252" is a part of the problem, let's explore some possibilities:

1. **Factorization**: If the problem involves factorizing the number 252, we can find its prime factors.

   - Start by dividing 252 by the smallest prime number, which is 2:
     \[
     252 \div 2 = 126
     \]
   - Divide 126 by 2 again:
     \[
     126 \div 2 = 63
     \]
   - 63 is not divisible by 2, so we move to the next prime number, which is 3:
     \[
     63 \div 3 = 21
     \]
   - Divide 21 by 3:
     \[
     21 \div 3 = 7
     \]
   - 7 is a prime number.

   Therefore, the prime factorization of 252 is:
   \[
   252 = 2^2 \times 3^2 \times 7
   \]

2. **Finding Divisors**: If the problem involves finding the number of divisors of 252, use its prime factorization.

   - The prime factorization is \(2^2 \times 3^2 \times 7^1\).
   - To find the number of divisors, add 1 to each of the exponents and multiply:
     \[
     (2+1)(2+1)(1+1) = 3 \times 3 \times 2 = 18
     \]

   So, 252 has 18 divisors.

3. **Square Root**: If the problem involves finding the square root of 252, approximate or simplify it.

   - 252 is not a perfect square, but we can simplify \(\sqrt{252}\) using its prime factorization:
     \[
     \sqrt{252} = \sqrt{2^2 \times 3^2 \times 7} = 2 \times 3 \times \sqrt{7} = 6\sqrt{7}
     \]

4. **Other Operations**: If the problem involves other operations with 252, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division, please provide more context or details.

If you have a specific problem or context in mind, please provide more information so I can assist you further.
