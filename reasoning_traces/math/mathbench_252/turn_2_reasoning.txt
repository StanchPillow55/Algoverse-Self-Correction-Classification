Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample math problem 252" refers to. Since the problem is not explicitly stated, I'll assume it involves the number 252 and explore some common mathematical problems or operations that might involve this number. Let's consider a few possibilities:

### Possibility 1: Prime Factorization
One common problem involving a number is to find its prime factorization.

**Step 1: Check divisibility by 2.**
252 is an even number, so it is divisible by 2.
\[ 252 \div 2 = 126 \]

**Step 2: Continue with 126.**
126 is also even, so divide by 2 again.
\[ 126 \div 2 = 63 \]

**Step 3: Check divisibility by 3.**
The sum of the digits of 63 is \(6 + 3 = 9\), which is divisible by 3.
\[ 63 \div 3 = 21 \]

**Step 4: Continue with 21.**
The sum of the digits of 21 is \(2 + 1 = 3\), which is divisible by 3.
\[ 21 \div 3 = 7 \]

**Step 5: Check 7.**
7 is a prime number.

Thus, the prime factorization of 252 is:
\[ 252 = 2^2 \times 3^2 \times 7 \]

### Possibility 2: Find the Sum of the Digits
Another common problem could be to find the sum of the digits of 252.

**Step 1: Identify the digits.**
The digits of 252 are 2, 5, and 2.

**Step 2: Calculate the sum.**
\[ 2 + 5 + 2 = 9 \]

### Possibility 3: Check if 252 is a Perfect Square
A problem might ask if 252 is a perfect square.

**Step 1: Estimate the square root.**
The square root of 252 is approximately 15.8745.

**Step 2: Check perfect squares around this value.**
The perfect squares around this value are \(15^2 = 225\) and \(16^2 = 256\).

Since 252 is not equal to either 225 or 256, it is not a perfect square.

### Conclusion
Without a specific problem statement, I've explored a few mathematical operations involving the number 252. Here are the results:

1. **Prime Factorization:** \(252 = 2^2 \times 3^2 \times 7\)
2. **Sum of Digits:** 9
3. **Perfect Square Check:** 252 is not a perfect square.

If you have a specific problem involving 252, please provide more details, and I can solve it accordingly.
