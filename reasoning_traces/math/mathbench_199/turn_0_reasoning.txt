==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample math problem 199" refers to. Since no specific details are provided about the problem, I will assume it is a placeholder for a generic math problem. Let's create a sample problem and solve it step by step.

**Sample Math Problem 199:**

Let's assume the problem is as follows:

"Find the value of \( x \) in the equation \( 3x + 5 = 20 \)."

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Equation:**
   The equation given is \( 3x + 5 = 20 \). This is a linear equation in one variable, \( x \).

2. **Isolate the Variable:**
   To find the value of \( x \), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We can do this by performing the same operation on both sides of the equation.

3. **Subtract 5 from Both Sides:**
   \[
   3x + 5 - 5 = 20 - 5
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   3x = 15
   \]

4. **Divide Both Sides by 3:**
   \[
   \frac{3x}{3} = \frac{15}{3}
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   x = 5
   \]

5. **Verify the Solution:**
   Substitute \( x = 5 \) back into the original equation to verify:
   \[
   3(5) + 5 = 20
   \]
   \[
   15 + 5 = 20
   \]
   \[
   20 = 20
   \]
   The left-hand side equals the right-hand side, confirming that our solution is correct.

**Final Answer:**

The value of \( x \) is \( 5 \).
