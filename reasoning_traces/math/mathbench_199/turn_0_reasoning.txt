==================================================

To solve the problem, we first need to understand what "Sample math problem 199" refers to. Since no specific details are provided about the problem, I will assume this is a placeholder for a typical math problem. Let's create a hypothetical math problem and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**

"Calculate the sum of all even numbers between 1 and 199."

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Identify the even numbers between 1 and 199:**

   Even numbers are those divisible by 2. The smallest even number greater than 1 is 2, and the largest even number less than 199 is 198.

2. **List the sequence of even numbers:**

   The sequence of even numbers between 1 and 199 is: 2, 4, 6, ..., 198.

3. **Determine the number of terms in the sequence:**

   The sequence is an arithmetic sequence where the first term \( a_1 = 2 \) and the common difference \( d = 2 \).

   The general formula for the \( n \)-th term of an arithmetic sequence is:
   \[
   a_n = a_1 + (n-1) \cdot d
   \]

   We set \( a_n = 198 \) to find \( n \):
   \[
   198 = 2 + (n-1) \cdot 2
   \]
   \[
   198 = 2 + 2n - 2
   \]
   \[
   198 = 2n
   \]
   \[
   n = \frac{198}{2} = 99
   \]

   There are 99 even numbers between 1 and 199.

4. **Calculate the sum of the sequence:**

   The sum \( S_n \) of an arithmetic sequence can be calculated using the formula:
   \[
   S_n = \frac{n}{2} \cdot (a_1 + a_n)
   \]

   Substituting the known values:
   \[
   S_{99} = \frac{99}{2} \cdot (2 + 198)
   \]
   \[
   S_{99} = \frac{99}{2} \cdot 200
   \]
   \[
   S_{99} = 99 \cdot 100
   \]
   \[
   S_{99} = 9900
   \]

**Final Answer:**

The sum of all even numbers between 1 and 199 is 9900.
