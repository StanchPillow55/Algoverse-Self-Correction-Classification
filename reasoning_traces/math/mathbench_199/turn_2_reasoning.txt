Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 199," we need to first understand what the problem is asking. However, the problem statement is incomplete as it only says "Sample math problem 199" without providing any specific details or context. Therefore, I will assume that this is a placeholder for a specific math problem. 

To proceed, let's create a hypothetical math problem and solve it step by step. Let's assume the problem is as follows:

**Problem 199:**
Calculate the sum of the first 199 positive integers.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   We need to find the sum of the first 199 positive integers. This is a classic problem that can be solved using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series.

2. **Identify the Formula:**
   The sum \( S \) of the first \( n \) positive integers is given by the formula:
   \[
   S = \frac{n(n + 1)}{2}
   \]
   where \( n \) is the number of terms.

3. **Substitute the Values:**
   In this problem, \( n = 199 \). Substitute 199 into the formula:
   \[
   S = \frac{199(199 + 1)}{2}
   \]

4. **Perform the Calculations:**
   - First, calculate \( 199 + 1 \):
     \[
     199 + 1 = 200
     \]
   - Next, calculate \( 199 \times 200 \):
     \[
     199 \times 200 = 39800
     \]
   - Finally, divide by 2 to find the sum:
     \[
     S = \frac{39800}{2} = 19900
     \]

5. **Verify the Solution:**
   To ensure the calculation is correct, let's briefly verify:
   - The formula \( \frac{n(n + 1)}{2} \) is well-known and widely used for this type of problem.
   - The arithmetic operations were performed correctly.

6. **State the Final Answer:**
   The sum of the first 199 positive integers is \( 19900 \).

Therefore, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{19900}
\]
