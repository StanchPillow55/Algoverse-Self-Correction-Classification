Question ID: mathbench_199
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 199," we need to first understand what the problem is asking. However, since "Sample math problem 199" is not a specific question, I'll create a hypothetical math problem and solve it step-by-step.

**Hypothetical Problem 199:**

"Calculate the sum of the first 199 positive integers."

To solve this problem, we can use the formula for the sum of the first \( n \) positive integers:

\[
S_n = \frac{n(n + 1)}{2}
\]

where \( S_n \) is the sum of the first \( n \) positive integers.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Identify \( n \):**  
   In this problem, \( n = 199 \).

2. **Apply the formula:**  
   Substitute \( n = 199 \) into the formula:

   \[
   S_{199} = \frac{199 \times (199 + 1)}{2}
   \]

3. **Calculate \( 199 + 1 \):**  
   \[
   199 + 1 = 200
   \]

4. **Multiply 199 by 200:**  
   \[
   199 \times 200 = 39800
   \]

5. **Divide by 2 to find the sum:**  
   \[
   S_{199} = \frac{39800}{2} = 19900
   \]

**Final Answer:**

The sum of the first 199 positive integers is \( 19900 \).

This completes the problem, showing all calculations and reasoning step-by-step.
