==================================================

To solve the problem, we first need to understand what "Sample math problem 199" refers to. Since no specific details are provided about the problem, I'll create a hypothetical math problem labeled as "Sample math problem 199" and solve it step by step.

**Sample Math Problem 199:**

"Calculate the sum of all even numbers between 1 and 199."

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Identify the Range of Even Numbers:**
   - The even numbers between 1 and 199 start from 2 and go up to 198.

2. **Determine the Sequence of Even Numbers:**
   - The sequence of even numbers can be represented as: 2, 4, 6, ..., 198.

3. **Identify the Pattern:**
   - This is an arithmetic sequence where the first term \( a_1 = 2 \) and the common difference \( d = 2 \).

4. **Find the Number of Terms (n):**
   - The nth term of an arithmetic sequence is given by the formula:
     \[
     a_n = a_1 + (n-1) \cdot d
     \]
   - We know the last term \( a_n = 198 \). Plugging in the values:
     \[
     198 = 2 + (n-1) \cdot 2
     \]
     \[
     198 = 2 + 2n - 2
     \]
     \[
     198 = 2n
     \]
     \[
     n = \frac{198}{2} = 99
     \]
   - There are 99 even numbers between 1 and 199.

5. **Calculate the Sum of the Sequence:**
   - The sum \( S_n \) of the first n terms of an arithmetic sequence is given by:
     \[
     S_n = \frac{n}{2} \cdot (a_1 + a_n)
     \]
   - Substituting the known values:
     \[
     S_{99} = \frac{99}{2} \cdot (2 + 198)
     \]
     \[
     S_{99} = \frac{99}{2} \cdot 200
     \]
     \[
     S_{99} = 99 \cdot 100
     \]
     \[
     S_{99} = 9900
     \]

**Final Answer:**

The sum of all even numbers between 1 and 199 is 9900.
