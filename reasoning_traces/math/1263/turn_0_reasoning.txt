To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step, calculating the number of people at the beach each day and then summing them up for the total for the week.

1. **Day 1**: 
   - The number of people at the beach is given as 50.

   \[
   \text{Day 1} = 50 \text{ people}
   \]

2. **Day 2**: 
   - It is stated that there were 20 more people than on the first day. Therefore, we add 20 to the number from Day 1.

   \[
   \text{Day 2} = 50 + 20 = 70 \text{ people}
   \]

3. **Day 3**: 
   - The total number of people on the third day is twice the number of people on the second day. We calculate this by multiplying the number of people on Day 2 by 2.

   \[
   \text{Day 3} = 2 \times 70 = 140 \text{ people}
   \]

4. **Days 4 to 7**: 
   - Conor sees an average of 60 people each day for the rest of the week. Since there are 4 days remaining in the week (Day 4, Day 5, Day 6, and Day 7), we can calculate the total number of people for these days.

   \[
   \text{Total for Days 4 to 7} = 60 \text{ people/day} \times 4 \text{ days} = 240 \text{ people}
   \]

5. **Total for the Week**: 
   - Now, we sum the number of people from each day to find the total number of people Conor saw at the beach that week.

   \[
   \text{Total} = \text{Day 1} + \text{Day 2} + \text{Day 3} + \text{Total for Days 4 to 7}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total} = 50 + 70 + 140 + 240
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total} = 500 \text{ people}
   \]

Thus, the total number of people Conor saw at the beach that week is 

\[
\boxed{500}
\]
