==================================================

To solve the problem, I'll need more specific information about "Sample reasoning question 165" as it seems to refer to a specific question from a source I don't have access to. However, I can guide you through a general approach to solving a typical math reasoning problem. If you provide more details about the problem, I can tailor the solution to that specific question.

Let's assume a typical math reasoning problem involves a scenario with numbers, patterns, or logical deductions. Here's a step-by-step approach to solving such a problem:

### Step 1: Understand the Problem
- **Read the problem carefully**: Identify what is being asked. Look for keywords or phrases that indicate the type of problem (e.g., "sum," "difference," "product," "pattern").
- **Identify knowns and unknowns**: Determine what information is given and what you need to find.

### Step 2: Devise a Plan
- **Choose a strategy**: Depending on the problem, you might use strategies such as looking for patterns, making a table, drawing a diagram, or writing an equation.
- **Consider similar problems**: Think about similar problems you have solved before and how you approached them.

### Step 3: Carry Out the Plan
- **Execute your strategy**: Perform calculations or logical steps as needed. Be systematic and methodical.
- **Show all work**: Write down each step clearly to avoid mistakes and to make it easier to review your work.

### Step 4: Review/Check Your Work
- **Verify your solution**: Check if your answer makes sense in the context of the problem. Re-calculate if necessary.
- **Consider alternative methods**: Sometimes, solving the problem in a different way can confirm your answer or provide additional insights.

### Example Problem and Solution
Let's apply this approach to a simple example problem:

**Problem**: Find the sum of all even numbers between 1 and 10.

**Step 1: Understand the Problem**
- We need to find the sum of even numbers between 1 and 10.

**Step 2: Devise a Plan**
- List the even numbers between 1 and 10: 2, 4, 6, 8, 10.
- Plan to add these numbers together.

**Step 3: Carry Out the Plan**
- Calculate the sum: 
  \[
  2 + 4 + 6 + 8 + 10 = 30
  \]

**Step 4: Review/Check Your Work**
- Verify the list of even numbers: 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 are indeed the even numbers between 1 and 10.
- Re-calculate to ensure accuracy:
  \[
  2 + 4 = 6 \\
  6 + 6 = 12 \\
  12 + 8 = 20 \\
  20 + 10 = 30
  \]
- The calculations confirm the sum is correct.

**Final Answer**: The sum of all even numbers between 1 and 10 is 30.
