==================================================

To solve this problem, I need more information about "Sample reasoning question 165." Since the question is not provided, I'll demonstrate how to approach a typical math problem step by step. Let's assume a sample problem related to algebra:

**Problem:** Solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).

**Step 1: Understand the Problem**

The equation given is \( 2x + 3 = 11 \). We need to find the value of \( x \) that makes this equation true.

**Step 2: Isolate the Variable**

To solve for \( x \), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We can do this by performing operations that will simplify the equation.

**Step 3: Perform Operations**

1. **Subtract 3 from both sides**: This will help to eliminate the constant term on the left side of the equation.

   \[
   2x + 3 - 3 = 11 - 3
   \]

   Simplifying both sides gives:

   \[
   2x = 8
   \]

2. **Divide both sides by 2**: This will solve for \( x \).

   \[
   \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{8}{2}
   \]

   Simplifying both sides gives:

   \[
   x = 4
   \]

**Step 4: Verify the Solution**

To ensure the solution is correct, substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation:

\[
2(4) + 3 = 11
\]

Simplifying the left side:

\[
8 + 3 = 11
\]

Since both sides of the equation are equal, the solution \( x = 4 \) is verified.

**Final Answer:**

The solution to the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \) is \( x = 4 \).
