==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 165" entails. Since the problem statement is not explicitly provided, let's assume that this is a typical math problem that requires logical reasoning and step-by-step calculations. 

For the sake of this exercise, let's create a hypothetical math problem and solve it using detailed reasoning and calculations.

**Hypothetical Problem:**

A company produces two types of widgets: Type A and Type B. The production cost for Type A is $5 per unit, and for Type B, it is $8 per unit. The company sells Type A widgets for $10 each and Type B widgets for $15 each. In a given month, the company produced a total of 500 widgets, consisting of both Type A and Type B. The total revenue from selling all the widgets was $6,500. How many of each type of widget did the company produce?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( x \) be the number of Type A widgets produced.
   - Let \( y \) be the number of Type B widgets produced.

2. **Set Up Equations:**
   - We know the total number of widgets produced is 500. Therefore, the first equation is:
     \[
     x + y = 500
     \]
   - The total revenue from selling the widgets is $6,500. The revenue from Type A widgets is \( 10x \) and from Type B widgets is \( 15y \). Therefore, the second equation is:
     \[
     10x + 15y = 6500
     \]

3. **Solve the System of Equations:**
   - We have the system of equations:
     \[
     \begin{align*}
     x + y &= 500 \quad \text{(Equation 1)} \\
     10x + 15y &= 6500 \quad \text{(Equation 2)}
     \end{align*}
     \]

   - Solve Equation 1 for \( y \):
     \[
     y = 500 - x
     \]

   - Substitute \( y = 500 - x \) into Equation 2:
     \[
     10x + 15(500 - x) = 6500
     \]

   - Simplify and solve for \( x \):
     \[
     10x + 7500 - 15x = 6500
     \]
     \[
     -5x + 7500 = 6500
     \]
     \[
     -5x = 6500 - 7500
     \]
     \[
     -5x = -1000
     \]
     \[
     x = 200
     \]

   - Substitute \( x = 200 \) back into Equation 1 to find \( y \):
     \[
     200 + y = 500
     \]
     \[
     y = 500 - 200
     \]
     \[
     y = 300
     \]

4. **Verify the Solution:**
   - Check the total number of widgets:
     \[
     x + y = 200 + 300 = 500 \quad \text{(Correct)}
     \]
   - Check the total revenue:
     \[
     10x + 15y = 10(200) + 15(300) = 2000 + 4500 = 6500 \quad \text{(Correct)}
     \]

**Final Answer:**
The company produced 200 Type A widgets and 300 Type B widgets.
