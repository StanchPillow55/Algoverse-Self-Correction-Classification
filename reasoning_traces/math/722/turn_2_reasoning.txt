Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To determine how much money Ron saves by fixing the pothole, we need to calculate the total costs he incurs by fixing it himself and compare that to the potential damage to his car if he doesn't fix it.

1. **Calculate the total cost of fixing the pothole:**
   - Cost of the fine for unauthorized road maintenance: $120
   - Cost of 3 buckets of asphalt: 
     \[
     3 \text{ buckets} \times 25 \text{ dollars per bucket} = 75 \text{ dollars}
     \]
   - Total cost for fixing the pothole:
     \[
     120 \text{ dollars (fine)} + 75 \text{ dollars (asphalt)} = 195 \text{ dollars}
     \]

2. **Calculate the potential damage to Ron's car if the pothole is not fixed:**
   - Damage to the car: $450

3. **Calculate the savings by fixing the pothole:**
   - Savings = Damage to car - Total cost of fixing the pothole:
     \[
     450 \text{ dollars (damage)} - 195 \text{ dollars (cost to fix)} = 255 \text{ dollars}
     \]

Thus, by fixing the pothole, Ron saves **$255**.

Final answer: Ron saves $255 by fixing the pothole.
