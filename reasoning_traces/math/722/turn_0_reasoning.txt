To determine how much money Ron saves by fixing the pothole, we need to calculate the total costs he incurs by fixing it himself and compare that to the potential damage costs if he does not fix it.

1. **Calculate the cost of fixing the pothole:**
   - Ron needs to buy 3 buckets of asphalt, each costing $25.
   - Total cost for asphalt = Number of buckets Ã— Cost per bucket
   \[
   \text{Total cost for asphalt} = 3 \text{ buckets} \times 25 \text{ dollars/bucket} = 75 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Calculate the fine for unauthorized road maintenance:**
   - The city council will fine Ron $120 for fixing the pothole himself.
   - Total fine = $120

3. **Calculate the total cost incurred by Ron for fixing the pothole:**
   - Total cost = Cost of asphalt + Fine
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = 75 \text{ dollars} + 120 \text{ dollars} = 195 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Calculate the potential damage to Ron's car if the pothole is not fixed:**
   - The damage to Ron's car if the pothole is not fixed is $450.

5. **Calculate the savings by fixing the pothole:**
   - Savings = Potential damage - Total cost incurred by fixing the pothole
   \[
   \text{Savings} = 450 \text{ dollars} - 195 \text{ dollars} = 255 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Thus, by fixing the pothole, Ron saves **$255**.

Final answer: Ron saves **$255** by fixing the pothole.
