==================================================

Certainly! Let's work through the problem step by step. However, it seems like the problem statement is incomplete or unclear with just "Sample math problem 130." To proceed, I will assume this is a placeholder and create a sample math problem to solve. Let's consider a problem involving algebra:

**Sample Problem:**
Solve for \( x \) in the equation: 
\[ 3x + 5 = 2x + 11 \]

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Equation:**
   We have a linear equation in one variable, \( x \). The goal is to isolate \( x \) on one side of the equation.

2. **Subtract \( 2x \) from both sides:**
   To eliminate \( x \) from the right side, subtract \( 2x \) from both sides of the equation:
   \[
   3x + 5 - 2x = 2x + 11 - 2x
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   x + 5 = 11
   \]

3. **Subtract 5 from both sides:**
   To isolate \( x \), subtract 5 from both sides:
   \[
   x + 5 - 5 = 11 - 5
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   x = 6
   \]

4. **Verify the Solution:**
   Substitute \( x = 6 \) back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies the equation:
   \[
   3(6) + 5 = 2(6) + 11
   \]
   Calculate both sides:
   \[
   18 + 5 = 12 + 11
   \]
   \[
   23 = 23
   \]
   Since both sides are equal, \( x = 6 \) is indeed the correct solution.

**Final Answer:**
The solution to the equation \( 3x + 5 = 2x + 11 \) is \( x = 6 \).
