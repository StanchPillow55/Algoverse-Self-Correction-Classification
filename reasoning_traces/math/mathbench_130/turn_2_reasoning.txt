Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we first need to understand what "Sample math problem 130" refers to. Since the problem itself is not provided, I'll create a hypothetical math problem that could be labeled as "Sample math problem 130" and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem 130:**

Calculate the sum of the first 130 positive integers.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   We need to find the sum of the first 130 positive integers. The sequence of these integers is: 1, 2, 3, ..., 130.

2. **Formula for the Sum of an Arithmetic Series:**
   The sum \( S \) of the first \( n \) positive integers is given by the formula:
   \[
   S = \frac{n(n + 1)}{2}
   \]
   where \( n \) is the number of terms.

3. **Substitute the Given Value:**
   In this problem, \( n = 130 \). Substitute 130 into the formula:
   \[
   S = \frac{130(130 + 1)}{2}
   \]

4. **Calculate the Expression:**
   - First, calculate \( 130 + 1 \):
     \[
     130 + 1 = 131
     \]
   - Next, calculate the product \( 130 \times 131 \):
     \[
     130 \times 131 = 17030
     \]
   - Finally, divide by 2 to find the sum:
     \[
     S = \frac{17030}{2} = 8515
     \]

5. **Conclusion:**
   The sum of the first 130 positive integers is 8515.

**Final Answer:**
The sum of the first 130 positive integers is 8515.
