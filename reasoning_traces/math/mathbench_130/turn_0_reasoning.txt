To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample math problem 130" refers to. Since no specific details are provided about the problem, I'll create a sample math problem labeled as "130" and solve it step by step.

**Sample Math Problem 130:**

**Problem:**
A rectangle has a length that is 3 times its width. If the perimeter of the rectangle is 104 units, find the dimensions of the rectangle.

**Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We are given that the length \( L \) of the rectangle is 3 times its width \( W \).
   - The perimeter \( P \) of the rectangle is 104 units.

2. **Set Up the Equations:**
   - The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is:
     \[
     P = 2L + 2W
     \]
   - We know \( L = 3W \) (since the length is 3 times the width).
   - Substitute \( L = 3W \) into the perimeter formula:
     \[
     104 = 2(3W) + 2W
     \]

3. **Simplify and Solve for \( W \):**
   - Simplify the equation:
     \[
     104 = 6W + 2W
     \]
     \[
     104 = 8W
     \]
   - Solve for \( W \) by dividing both sides by 8:
     \[
     W = \frac{104}{8} = 13
     \]

4. **Find the Length \( L \):**
   - Since \( L = 3W \), substitute \( W = 13 \) into the equation:
     \[
     L = 3 \times 13 = 39
     \]

5. **Verify the Solution:**
   - Check the perimeter with the found dimensions:
     \[
     P = 2L + 2W = 2(39) + 2(13) = 78 + 26 = 104
     \]
   - The calculated perimeter matches the given perimeter, confirming our solution is correct.

6. **State the Final Answer:**
   - The dimensions of the rectangle are:
     - Width \( W = 13 \) units
     - Length \( L = 39 \) units

Thus, the final answer is that the width of the rectangle is 13 units and the length is 39 units.
