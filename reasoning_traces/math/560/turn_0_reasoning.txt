==================================================

To find the total number of rodents in the pet shop, we need to calculate the number of hamsters and guinea pigs separately and then add those two amounts together.

1. **Calculate the number of hamsters:**
   - There are 3 cages of hamsters.
   - Each cage has 10 hamsters.
   - To find the total number of hamsters, we multiply the number of cages by the number of hamsters per cage:
     \[
     \text{Total hamsters} = \text{Number of cages} \times \text{Hamsters per cage} = 3 \times 10 = 30
     \]

2. **Calculate the number of guinea pigs:**
   - There are 3 cages of guinea pigs.
   - Each cage has 5 guinea pigs.
   - To find the total number of guinea pigs, we multiply the number of cages by the number of guinea pigs per cage:
     \[
     \text{Total guinea pigs} = \text{Number of cages} \times \text{Guinea pigs per cage} = 3 \times 5 = 15
     \]

3. **Calculate the total number of rodents:**
   - Now, we add the total number of hamsters and guinea pigs together to find the total number of rodents:
     \[
     \text{Total rodents} = \text{Total hamsters} + \text{Total guinea pigs} = 30 + 15 = 45
     \]

Thus, the total number of rodents in the pet shop is \( \boxed{45} \).
