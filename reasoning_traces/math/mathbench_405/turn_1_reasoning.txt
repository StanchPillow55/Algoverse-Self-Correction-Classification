Question ID: mathbench_405
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we first need to understand what "Sample math problem 405" refers to. Since the problem is not explicitly stated, let's assume it involves a typical math problem that might be labeled as "405" in a sequence of problems. For the sake of this exercise, let's create a hypothetical math problem that could be labeled as such:

**Hypothetical Problem 405:**

"Calculate the sum of the first 20 positive integers."

To solve this problem, we can use the formula for the sum of the first \( n \) positive integers, which is given by:

\[
S_n = \frac{n(n + 1)}{2}
\]

where \( S_n \) is the sum of the first \( n \) positive integers.

**Step-by-step Solution:**

1. **Identify the value of \( n \):**

   In this problem, we are asked to find the sum of the first 20 positive integers. Therefore, \( n = 20 \).

2. **Apply the formula:**

   Substitute \( n = 20 \) into the formula:

   \[
   S_{20} = \frac{20(20 + 1)}{2}
   \]

3. **Calculate inside the parentheses:**

   \[
   20 + 1 = 21
   \]

4. **Multiply:**

   \[
   20 \times 21 = 420
   \]

5. **Divide by 2:**

   \[
   \frac{420}{2} = 210
   \]

Therefore, the sum of the first 20 positive integers is 210.

**Final Answer:**

The sum of the first 20 positive integers is 210.
