To solve the problem, I need more information about what "Sample math problem 405" entails. Since the problem itself isn't specified, I'll demonstrate how to solve a generic math problem step by step. Let's consider a common type of math problem: solving a quadratic equation.

**Problem: Solve the quadratic equation \(2x^2 - 4x - 6 = 0\).**

### Step 1: Identify the coefficients
The standard form of a quadratic equation is \(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\). For the given equation \(2x^2 - 4x - 6 = 0\), the coefficients are:
- \(a = 2\)
- \(b = -4\)
- \(c = -6\)

### Step 2: Calculate the discriminant
The discriminant (\(\Delta\)) of a quadratic equation is given by the formula \(\Delta = b^2 - 4ac\). This helps determine the nature of the roots.

\[
\Delta = (-4)^2 - 4 \times 2 \times (-6)
\]
\[
\Delta = 16 + 48
\]
\[
\Delta = 64
\]

Since the discriminant is positive, the quadratic equation has two distinct real roots.

### Step 3: Use the quadratic formula
The quadratic formula to find the roots of \(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\) is:

\[
x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{\Delta}}{2a}
\]

Substitute the values of \(a\), \(b\), and \(\Delta\) into the formula:

\[
x = \frac{-(-4) \pm \sqrt{64}}{2 \times 2}
\]
\[
x = \frac{4 \pm 8}{4}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the roots
Now, calculate the two possible values for \(x\):

1. \(x_1 = \frac{4 + 8}{4} = \frac{12}{4} = 3\)

2. \(x_2 = \frac{4 - 8}{4} = \frac{-4}{4} = -1\)

### Conclusion
The solutions to the quadratic equation \(2x^2 - 4x - 6 = 0\) are \(x = 3\) and \(x = -1\).

**Final Answer: \(x = 3\) and \(x = -1\)**
