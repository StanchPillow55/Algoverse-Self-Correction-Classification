==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample math problem 180" refers to. Since the problem is not explicitly stated, let's assume it involves a basic arithmetic or algebraic operation involving the number 180. For the sake of this exercise, I'll create a problem involving the number 180 and solve it step by step.

**Problem:**  
Find the prime factorization of 180 and determine the number of divisors it has.

**Step 1: Prime Factorization of 180**  
To find the prime factorization, we divide 180 by the smallest prime number and continue the process with the quotient until we reach 1.

1. Divide 180 by 2 (the smallest prime number):
   \[
   180 \div 2 = 90
   \]
   So, 180 = 2 × 90.

2. Divide 90 by 2:
   \[
   90 \div 2 = 45
   \]
   So, 90 = 2 × 45, and thus 180 = 2 × 2 × 45.

3. Divide 45 by 3 (the next smallest prime number):
   \[
   45 \div 3 = 15
   \]
   So, 45 = 3 × 15, and thus 180 = 2 × 2 × 3 × 15.

4. Divide 15 by 3:
   \[
   15 \div 3 = 5
   \]
   So, 15 = 3 × 5, and thus 180 = 2 × 2 × 3 × 3 × 5.

Now, we have the prime factorization of 180:
\[
180 = 2^2 \times 3^2 \times 5^1
\]

**Step 2: Determine the Number of Divisors**  
To find the number of divisors of a number given its prime factorization, we use the formula:
\[
(n_1 + 1)(n_2 + 1)(n_3 + 1) \ldots
\]
where \( n_1, n_2, n_3, \ldots \) are the exponents in the prime factorization.

For 180 = \( 2^2 \times 3^2 \times 5^1 \), the exponents are 2, 2, and 1.

Calculate the number of divisors:
\[
(2 + 1)(2 + 1)(1 + 1) = 3 \times 3 \times 2 = 18
\]

**Final Answer:**  
The prime factorization of 180 is \( 2^2 \times 3^2 \times 5^1 \), and it has 18 divisors.
