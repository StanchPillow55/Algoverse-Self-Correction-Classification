==================================================

To solve the problem, let's first understand what "Sample math problem 180" might entail. Since the problem is not explicitly stated, I'll assume it involves a mathematical operation or concept related to the number 180. Here are a few possibilities:

1. **Factorization of 180**: Let's find the prime factorization of 180.
   - Start by dividing 180 by the smallest prime number, 2:
     \[
     180 \div 2 = 90
     \]
   - Divide 90 by 2 again:
     \[
     90 \div 2 = 45
     \]
   - 45 is not divisible by 2, so move to the next prime number, 3:
     \[
     45 \div 3 = 15
     \]
   - Divide 15 by 3:
     \[
     15 \div 3 = 5
     \]
   - Finally, 5 is a prime number.
   - Therefore, the prime factorization of 180 is:
     \[
     180 = 2^2 \times 3^2 \times 5
     \]

2. **Sum of the angles in a polygon**: If 180 refers to degrees, it might relate to the sum of angles in a triangle.
   - The sum of the interior angles of a triangle is always 180 degrees.

3. **Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) or Least Common Multiple (LCM)**: If 180 is part of a set of numbers, we might be asked to find the GCD or LCM.
   - For example, if we have numbers 180 and 240, we can find their GCD.
   - Prime factorization of 240 is:
     \[
     240 = 2^4 \times 3 \times 5
     \]
   - The common prime factors are \(2^2\), \(3\), and \(5\).
   - GCD is:
     \[
     2^2 \times 3 \times 5 = 60
     \]

4. **Conversion between degrees and radians**: If 180 refers to degrees, we might convert it to radians.
   - The conversion formula is:
     \[
     \text{Radians} = \text{Degrees} \times \frac{\pi}{180}
     \]
   - Therefore, 180 degrees in radians is:
     \[
     180 \times \frac{\pi}{180} = \pi \text{ radians}
     \]

5. **Arithmetic operations**: If 180 is part of an arithmetic sequence or operation, we might be asked to perform calculations.
   - For example, if asked to find the sum of numbers from 1 to 180, use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series:
     \[
     S_n = \frac{n}{2} \times (a + l)
     \]
     where \(n\) is the number of terms, \(a\) is the first term, and \(l\) is the last term.
   - Here, \(n = 180\), \(a = 1\), \(l = 180\):
     \[
     S_{180} = \frac{180}{2} \times (1 + 180) = 90 \times 181 = 16290
     \]

Since the problem is not explicitly defined, I've covered several interpretations involving the number 180. If you have a specific context or additional details, please provide them for a more targeted solution.
