==================================================

To solve the problem, we first need to understand what "Sample math problem 180" refers to. Since the problem is not explicitly stated, I'll assume it's a generic math problem involving the number 180. Let's consider a common type of problem involving the number 180, such as finding its factors, prime factorization, or solving an equation where 180 is a key component.

### Problem: Find the prime factorization of 180.

**Step 1: Understand Prime Factorization**

Prime factorization is the process of expressing a number as the product of its prime factors. A prime number is a number greater than 1 that has no divisors other than 1 and itself.

**Step 2: Start with the Smallest Prime Number**

Begin dividing 180 by the smallest prime number, which is 2.

\[ 180 \div 2 = 90 \]

So, 2 is a prime factor, and we continue with 90.

**Step 3: Continue with 90**

90 is even, so we can divide by 2 again.

\[ 90 \div 2 = 45 \]

Now, 2 is another prime factor, and we continue with 45.

**Step 4: Move to the Next Prime Number**

45 is not divisible by 2, so we move to the next smallest prime number, which is 3.

\[ 45 \div 3 = 15 \]

So, 3 is a prime factor, and we continue with 15.

**Step 5: Continue with 15**

15 is divisible by 3 again.

\[ 15 \div 3 = 5 \]

So, 3 is another prime factor, and we continue with 5.

**Step 6: Check the Remaining Number**

The number 5 is a prime number, so it is the last prime factor.

**Step 7: Write the Prime Factorization**

Now, we have all the prime factors of 180:

\[ 180 = 2 \times 2 \times 3 \times 3 \times 5 \]

This can be written using exponents as:

\[ 180 = 2^2 \times 3^2 \times 5^1 \]

### Final Answer

The prime factorization of 180 is \( 2^2 \times 3^2 \times 5 \).

This completes the solution to the problem, assuming the task was to find the prime factorization of 180. If the problem was different, please provide more details for a specific solution.
