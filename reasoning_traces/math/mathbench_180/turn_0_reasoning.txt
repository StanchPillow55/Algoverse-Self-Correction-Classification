==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample math problem 180" refers to. Since there is no specific problem statement provided, I'll assume that "Sample math problem 180" is a placeholder for a generic math problem. For the sake of this exercise, let's create a problem involving the number 180 and solve it.

**Problem:**
Find the prime factorization of 180 and determine the number of positive divisors it has.

**Step 1: Prime Factorization of 180**

To find the prime factorization of 180, we start by dividing it by the smallest prime number, which is 2, and continue dividing by prime numbers until we reach 1.

1. \( 180 \div 2 = 90 \)
2. \( 90 \div 2 = 45 \)
3. \( 45 \div 3 = 15 \)
4. \( 15 \div 3 = 5 \)
5. \( 5 \div 5 = 1 \)

So, the prime factorization of 180 is:
\[ 180 = 2^2 \times 3^2 \times 5^1 \]

**Step 2: Determine the Number of Positive Divisors**

To find the number of positive divisors of a number, we use the formula based on its prime factorization. If a number \( n \) has the prime factorization \( n = p_1^{a_1} \times p_2^{a_2} \times \cdots \times p_k^{a_k} \), then the number of positive divisors \( D(n) \) is given by:
\[ D(n) = (a_1 + 1)(a_2 + 1) \cdots (a_k + 1) \]

For 180, with the prime factorization \( 2^2 \times 3^2 \times 5^1 \):

- \( a_1 = 2 \) for the prime 2
- \( a_2 = 2 \) for the prime 3
- \( a_3 = 1 \) for the prime 5

Thus, the number of positive divisors is:
\[ D(180) = (2 + 1)(2 + 1)(1 + 1) = 3 \times 3 \times 2 = 18 \]

**Final Answer:**

The prime factorization of 180 is \( 2^2 \times 3^2 \times 5^1 \), and it has 18 positive divisors.
