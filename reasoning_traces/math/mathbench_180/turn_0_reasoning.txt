==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample math problem 180" refers to. Since the problem is not explicitly stated, I'll assume it involves a common mathematical concept or operation related to the number 180. One such problem could involve finding the factors of 180, determining its prime factorization, or solving an equation involving 180. Let's explore these possibilities:

### 1. Prime Factorization of 180

To find the prime factorization of 180, we need to divide it by the smallest prime numbers until we reach 1.

1. **Divide by 2 (smallest prime number):**
   \[
   180 \div 2 = 90
   \]
   So, 2 is a factor. We continue with 90.

2. **Divide 90 by 2:**
   \[
   90 \div 2 = 45
   \]
   Another factor of 2. We continue with 45.

3. **Divide 45 by 3 (next smallest prime number):**
   \[
   45 \div 3 = 15
   \]
   So, 3 is a factor. We continue with 15.

4. **Divide 15 by 3:**
   \[
   15 \div 3 = 5
   \]
   Another factor of 3. We continue with 5.

5. **Divide 5 by 5 (next smallest prime number):**
   \[
   5 \div 5 = 1
   \]
   So, 5 is a factor.

The prime factorization of 180 is:
\[
180 = 2^2 \times 3^2 \times 5
\]

### 2. Factors of 180

Using the prime factorization, we can determine all factors of 180. The factors are combinations of the prime factors raised to their respective powers:

- \(2^0, 2^1, 2^2\)
- \(3^0, 3^1, 3^2\)
- \(5^0, 5^1\)

To find all factors, we multiply these combinations:

- \(1\) (from \(2^0 \times 3^0 \times 5^0\))
- \(2, 4\) (from \(2^1, 2^2\))
- \(3, 9\) (from \(3^1, 3^2\))
- \(5\) (from \(5^1\))
- \(6, 12, 18, 36, 45, 90, 180\) (combinations of different powers)

The complete list of factors is:
\[ 
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9, 10, 12, 15, 18, 20, 30, 36, 45, 60, 90, 180 
\]

### Final Answer

The prime factorization of 180 is \(2^2 \times 3^2 \times 5\), and the complete list of factors is:
\[ 
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9, 10, 12, 15, 18, 20, 30, 36, 45, 60, 90, 180 
\]
