==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to break it down step by step.

1. **Determine how many scoops of mashed potatoes Gomer ate:**
   - Gomer ate 5 less than 23 scoops of mashed potatoes.
   - We can express this mathematically as:
     \[
     \text{Scoops eaten} = 23 - 5 = 18 \text{ scoops}
     \]

2. **Determine how many potatoes are needed to make one scoop of mashed potatoes:**
   - The problem states that it takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes.
   - First, calculate how many potatoes are needed:
     - 3 less than 6 is:
       \[
       6 - 3 = 3 \text{ potatoes}
       \]
     - 1 less than 3 scoops is:
       \[
       3 - 1 = 2 \text{ scoops}
       \]
   - Therefore, it takes 3 potatoes to make 2 scoops of mashed potatoes.

3. **Calculate how many potatoes are needed for 1 scoop of mashed potatoes:**
   - If 3 potatoes make 2 scoops, then the number of potatoes needed for 1 scoop is:
     \[
     \text{Potatoes per scoop} = \frac{3 \text{ potatoes}}{2 \text{ scoops}} = 1.5 \text{ potatoes per scoop}
     \]

4. **Calculate how many potatoes Gomer used for 18 scoops:**
   - Now that we know it takes 1.5 potatoes to make 1 scoop, we can find out how many potatoes Gomer used for 18 scoops:
     \[
     \text{Total potatoes} = 18 \text{ scoops} \times 1.5 \text{ potatoes/scoop} = 27 \text{ potatoes}
     \]

5. **Final answer:**
   - Therefore, the total number of potatoes Gomer ate is:
     \[
     \boxed{27}
     \]
