==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to determine how many bags of apples the orchard sold and then calculate the total earnings based on the price per bag.

### Step 1: Determine the number of bags sold

The orchard sells apples in bags of 10. We know that a total of 2000 apples were sold. To find out how many bags were sold, we can use the following calculation:

\[
\text{Number of bags} = \frac{\text{Total apples}}{\text{Apples per bag}} = \frac{2000}{10}
\]

Calculating this gives:

\[
\text{Number of bags} = \frac{2000}{10} = 200
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the total earnings

Next, we need to find out how much the orchard earned from selling these bags. The price per bag is $5. Therefore, the total earnings can be calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Total earnings} = \text{Number of bags} \times \text{Price per bag} = 200 \times 5
\]

Calculating this gives:

\[
\text{Total earnings} = 200 \times 5 = 1000
\]

### Final Answer

The orchard earned a total of **$1000** from selling the apples.
