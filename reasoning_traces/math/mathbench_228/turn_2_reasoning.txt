==================================================

To solve "Sample math problem 228," we need to first understand what the problem is asking. Since the problem statement is not provided, I'll create a sample math problem and solve it step by step.

**Sample Math Problem 228:**

**Problem:**  
A rectangular garden has a length that is twice its width. If the perimeter of the garden is 60 meters, what are the dimensions of the garden?

**Solution:**

Let's denote the width of the garden as \( w \) meters.  
Since the length is twice the width, we can denote the length as \( 2w \) meters.

The formula for the perimeter \( P \) of a rectangle is given by:
\[
P = 2(\text{length} + \text{width})
\]

Substituting the known values into the formula, we have:
\[
60 = 2(2w + w)
\]

Simplify the expression inside the parentheses:
\[
60 = 2(3w)
\]

Multiply out the 2:
\[
60 = 6w
\]

To find \( w \), divide both sides of the equation by 6:
\[
w = \frac{60}{6} = 10
\]

Now that we have the width, we can find the length. Since the length is twice the width:
\[
\text{Length} = 2w = 2 \times 10 = 20
\]

**Conclusion:**

The dimensions of the garden are:
- Width = 10 meters
- Length = 20 meters

**Final Answer:**

The dimensions of the garden are 10 meters by 20 meters.
