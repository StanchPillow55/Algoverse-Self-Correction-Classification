To solve the problem, I need more specific information about "Sample math problem 228." Since I don't have access to external databases or specific problem sets, I'll create a sample math problem and solve it step by step. If you have a specific problem in mind, please provide the details.

**Sample Math Problem:**

Let's consider a problem involving algebra and geometry:

**Problem:**

A rectangle has a length that is twice its width. If the perimeter of the rectangle is 36 units, what are the dimensions of the rectangle?

**Solution:**

To solve this problem, we need to find the length and width of the rectangle. Let's denote the width of the rectangle as \( w \) and the length as \( l \).

According to the problem, the length is twice the width:

\[ l = 2w \]

The formula for the perimeter \( P \) of a rectangle is given by:

\[ P = 2l + 2w \]

We are told that the perimeter is 36 units:

\[ 2l + 2w = 36 \]

Now, substitute the expression for \( l \) from the first equation into the perimeter equation:

\[ 2(2w) + 2w = 36 \]

Simplify the equation:

\[ 4w + 2w = 36 \]

Combine like terms:

\[ 6w = 36 \]

Now, solve for \( w \) by dividing both sides by 6:

\[ w = \frac{36}{6} \]

\[ w = 6 \]

Now that we have the width, we can find the length using the relationship \( l = 2w \):

\[ l = 2(6) \]

\[ l = 12 \]

**Conclusion:**

The dimensions of the rectangle are a width of 6 units and a length of 12 units.

**Final Answer:**

Width = 6 units, Length = 12 units.
