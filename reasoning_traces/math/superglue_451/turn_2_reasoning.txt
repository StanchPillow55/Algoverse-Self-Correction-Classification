Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 451" entails. Since the question is not explicitly provided, I'll demonstrate a general approach to solving a math problem using logical reasoning and step-by-step calculations. 

Let's assume "Sample reasoning question 451" is a typical math problem involving algebraic expressions. Here's a hypothetical problem and its solution:

**Problem:** Solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).

**Step 1: Understand the Problem**
The equation given is a simple linear equation in one variable, \( x \). Our goal is to isolate \( x \) on one side of the equation to find its value.

**Step 2: Isolate the Variable**
To isolate \( x \), we need to perform operations that will leave \( x \) by itself on one side of the equation.

**Step 3: Perform Operations**
1. Start with the equation:
   \[
   2x + 3 = 11
   \]

2. Subtract 3 from both sides to eliminate the constant term on the left side:
   \[
   2x + 3 - 3 = 11 - 3
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   2x = 8
   \]

3. Divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( x \):
   \[
   \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{8}{2}
   \]
   Simplifying gives:
   \[
   x = 4
   \]

**Step 4: Verify the Solution**
Substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies the equation:
   \[
   2(4) + 3 = 11
   \]
   Simplifying the left side:
   \[
   8 + 3 = 11
   \]
   Since both sides of the equation are equal, our solution is verified.

**Final Answer:**
The solution to the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \) is \( x = 4 \).

This step-by-step approach demonstrates how to solve a linear equation by isolating the variable and verifying the solution. If "Sample reasoning question 451" refers to a different type of problem, please provide more details for a specific solution.
