To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 451" refers to. Since this is a hypothetical question, let's assume it involves a typical math problem-solving scenario. I'll create a sample problem and solve it step by step.

**Sample Problem:**

Let's assume "Sample reasoning question 451" is a problem involving algebra and geometry. Here's the problem:

"A rectangle has a length that is twice its width. If the perimeter of the rectangle is 54 units, what are the dimensions of the rectangle?"

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We have a rectangle with a length (L) and a width (W).
   - The length is twice the width: \( L = 2W \).
   - The perimeter of the rectangle is 54 units.

2. **Recall the Formula for Perimeter:**
   - The perimeter (P) of a rectangle is given by the formula:
     \[
     P = 2L + 2W
     \]

3. **Substitute the Known Values:**
   - We know \( P = 54 \) and \( L = 2W \).
   - Substitute \( L = 2W \) into the perimeter formula:
     \[
     54 = 2(2W) + 2W
     \]

4. **Simplify the Equation:**
   - Simplify the right side of the equation:
     \[
     54 = 4W + 2W
     \]
   - Combine like terms:
     \[
     54 = 6W
     \]

5. **Solve for W:**
   - Divide both sides by 6 to solve for W:
     \[
     W = \frac{54}{6} = 9
     \]

6. **Find the Length (L):**
   - Since \( L = 2W \), substitute \( W = 9 \) into the equation for L:
     \[
     L = 2 \times 9 = 18
     \]

7. **Verify the Solution:**
   - Check if the dimensions satisfy the perimeter condition:
     \[
     P = 2L + 2W = 2(18) + 2(9) = 36 + 18 = 54
     \]
   - The calculated perimeter matches the given perimeter, confirming our solution is correct.

**Final Answer:**
The dimensions of the rectangle are:
- Width (W) = 9 units
- Length (L) = 18 units
