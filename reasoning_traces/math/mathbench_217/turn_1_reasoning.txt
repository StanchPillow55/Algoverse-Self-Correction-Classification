==================================================

To solve the problem, I need more information about "Sample math problem 217." Since the problem statement is not provided, I'll demonstrate how to solve a generic math problem step by step. If you have a specific problem in mind, please provide the details, and I'll be happy to help.

Let's consider a sample math problem:

**Problem:**
Solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   We need to find the value of \( x \) that satisfies the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).

2. **Isolate the Variable:**
   To solve for \( x \), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We can do this by performing operations that will simplify the equation.

3. **Subtract 3 from Both Sides:**
   \[
   2x + 3 - 3 = 11 - 3
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   2x = 8
   \]

4. **Divide by 2:**
   To solve for \( x \), divide both sides of the equation by 2:
   \[
   \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{8}{2}
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   x = 4
   \]

5. **Verify the Solution:**
   Substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies the equation:
   \[
   2(4) + 3 = 11
   \]
   Simplifying the left side gives:
   \[
   8 + 3 = 11
   \]
   Since both sides of the equation are equal, \( x = 4 \) is indeed the correct solution.

6. **State the Final Answer:**
   The solution to the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \) is \( x = 4 \).

If you have a specific problem or need further assistance, please provide the details, and I'll be glad to help!
