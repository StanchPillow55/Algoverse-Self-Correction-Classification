To solve the problem, we will calculate the amount of water pumped into the tank by Wanda and Ms. B over the two days, and then determine how much water remains to fill the tank.

1. **Calculate the total capacity of the tank:**
   \[
   \text{Total capacity} = 18000 \text{ gallons}
   \]

2. **Day 1: Calculate the amount of water pumped by Wanda and Ms. B.**
   - Wanda filled \( \frac{1}{4} \) of the tank's capacity:
     \[
     \text{Water pumped by Wanda on Day 1} = \frac{1}{4} \times 18000 = 4500 \text{ gallons}
     \]
   - Ms. B pumped \( \frac{3}{4} \) as much water as Wanda:
     \[
     \text{Water pumped by Ms. B on Day 1} = \frac{3}{4} \times 4500 = 3375 \text{ gallons}
     \]

3. **Total water pumped on Day 1:**
   \[
   \text{Total water pumped on Day 1} = 4500 + 3375 = 7875 \text{ gallons}
   \]

4. **Day 2: Calculate the amount of water pumped by Wanda and Ms. B.**
   - Wanda pumped \( \frac{2}{3} \) of the amount she pumped on Day 1:
     \[
     \text{Water pumped by Wanda on Day 2} = \frac{2}{3} \times 4500 = 3000 \text{ gallons}
     \]
   - Ms. B pumped \( \frac{1}{3} \) of the amount she pumped on Day 1:
     \[
     \text{Water pumped by Ms. B on Day 2} = \frac{1}{3} \times 3375 = 1125 \text{ gallons}
     \]

5. **Total water pumped on Day 2:**
   \[
   \text{Total water pumped on Day 2} = 3000 + 1125 = 4125 \text{ gallons}
   \]

6. **Total water pumped over the two days:**
   \[
   \text{Total water pumped} = 7875 + 4125 = 12000 \text{ gallons}
   \]

7. **Calculate the remaining water needed to fill the tank:**
   \[
   \text{Remaining water} = \text{Total capacity} - \text{Total water pumped} = 18000 - 12000 = 6000 \text{ gallons}
   \]

Thus, the amount of water remaining for the tank to be full is:
\[
\boxed{6000} \text{ gallons}
\]
