Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to determine the cost of one pen based on the costs of a pencil and an eraser, and then calculate the total cost for 8 pens.

**Step 1: Identify the costs of the pencil and eraser.**
- The cost of a pencil is given as \( P = 1.20 \) dollars.
- The cost of an eraser is given as \( E = 0.30 \) dollars.

**Step 2: Calculate the combined cost of a pencil and an eraser.**
To find the total cost of a pencil and an eraser, we add their individual costs:
\[
\text{Cost of pencil and eraser} = P + E = 1.20 + 0.30
\]
Calculating this gives:
\[
1.20 + 0.30 = 1.50 \text{ dollars}
\]

**Step 3: Determine the cost of one pen.**
According to the problem, the cost of one pen is equal to the combined cost of a pencil and an eraser. Therefore:
\[
\text{Cost of one pen} = 1.50 \text{ dollars}
\]

**Step 4: Calculate the total cost for 8 pens.**
To find the total cost for 8 pens, we multiply the cost of one pen by 8:
\[
\text{Total cost for 8 pens} = 8 \times \text{Cost of one pen} = 8 \times 1.50
\]
Calculating this gives:
\[
8 \times 1.50 = 12.00 \text{ dollars}
\]

**Final Answer:**
The total cost for 8 pens is \( \boxed{12.00} \) dollars.
