==================================================

To find out how much change Mary received after her purchase, we need to calculate the total cost of the drinks and pizzas she bought, and then subtract that total from the amount she paid.

### Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the drinks.
Mary bought 5 boxes of drinks at $6 each. We can calculate the total cost of the drinks as follows:

\[
\text{Total cost of drinks} = \text{Number of boxes} \times \text{Cost per box}
\]
\[
\text{Total cost of drinks} = 5 \times 6 = 30
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the total cost of the pizzas.
Mary also bought 10 boxes of pizzas at $14 each. We can calculate the total cost of the pizzas as follows:

\[
\text{Total cost of pizzas} = \text{Number of boxes} \times \text{Cost per box}
\]
\[
\text{Total cost of pizzas} = 10 \times 14 = 140
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the total cost of all items.
Now, we will add the total cost of the drinks and the total cost of the pizzas to find the total cost of all items:

\[
\text{Total cost of all items} = \text{Total cost of drinks} + \text{Total cost of pizzas}
\]
\[
\text{Total cost of all items} = 30 + 140 = 170
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the change Mary received.
Mary paid $200 for all the items. To find out how much change she received, we subtract the total cost of all items from the amount she paid:

\[
\text{Change} = \text{Amount paid} - \text{Total cost of all items}
\]
\[
\text{Change} = 200 - 170 = 30
\]

### Final Answer
Mary received **$30** in change.
