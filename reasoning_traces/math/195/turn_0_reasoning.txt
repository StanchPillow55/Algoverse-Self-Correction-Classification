==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of the drinks and pizzas that Mary bought and then determine how much change she received from her $200 payment.

**Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the drinks.**

Mary bought 5 boxes of drinks, and each box costs $6. To find the total cost of the drinks, we multiply the number of boxes by the cost per box:

\[
\text{Total cost of drinks} = 5 \text{ boxes} \times 6 \text{ dollars/box} = 30 \text{ dollars}
\]

**Step 2: Calculate the total cost of the pizzas.**

Mary bought 10 boxes of pizzas, and each box costs $14. To find the total cost of the pizzas, we multiply the number of boxes by the cost per box:

\[
\text{Total cost of pizzas} = 10 \text{ boxes} \times 14 \text{ dollars/box} = 140 \text{ dollars}
\]

**Step 3: Calculate the total cost of all items.**

To find the total cost of all the items Mary bought, we add the total cost of the drinks and the total cost of the pizzas:

\[
\text{Total cost of all items} = 30 \text{ dollars} + 140 \text{ dollars} = 170 \text{ dollars}
\]

**Step 4: Calculate the change Mary received.**

Mary paid $200 for all the items. To find out how much change she received, we subtract the total cost of all items from the amount she paid:

\[
\text{Change} = 200 \text{ dollars} - 170 \text{ dollars} = 30 \text{ dollars}
\]

Therefore, the change Mary received back is \(\boxed{30}\) dollars.
