To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample math problem 129" refers to. Since the problem itself isn't provided, I'll create a sample math problem and solve it step by step.

**Sample Math Problem 129:**

A rectangular garden has a length that is 3 meters more than twice its width. If the perimeter of the garden is 54 meters, find the dimensions of the garden.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( w \) be the width of the garden in meters.
   - Then, the length \( l \) can be expressed in terms of the width as \( l = 2w + 3 \).

2. **Use the Perimeter Formula:**
   - The formula for the perimeter \( P \) of a rectangle is given by:
     \[
     P = 2l + 2w
     \]
   - We know the perimeter is 54 meters, so:
     \[
     2l + 2w = 54
     \]

3. **Substitute the Expression for Length:**
   - Substitute \( l = 2w + 3 \) into the perimeter equation:
     \[
     2(2w + 3) + 2w = 54
     \]

4. **Simplify and Solve for \( w \):**
   - Distribute the 2 in the equation:
     \[
     4w + 6 + 2w = 54
     \]
   - Combine like terms:
     \[
     6w + 6 = 54
     \]
   - Subtract 6 from both sides:
     \[
     6w = 48
     \]
   - Divide by 6:
     \[
     w = 8
     \]

5. **Find the Length:**
   - Substitute \( w = 8 \) back into the expression for the length:
     \[
     l = 2(8) + 3 = 16 + 3 = 19
     \]

6. **Verify the Solution:**
   - Check the perimeter with these dimensions:
     \[
     2l + 2w = 2(19) + 2(8) = 38 + 16 = 54
     \]
   - The calculated perimeter matches the given perimeter, confirming our solution is correct.

**Final Answer:**

The width of the garden is 8 meters, and the length is 19 meters.
