==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 129," we need to first understand what the problem is asking. However, since "Sample math problem 129" is not a specific math problem, I will create a hypothetical math problem and solve it step by step.

Let's assume "Sample math problem 129" is the following:

**Problem:**
A rectangle has a length that is 3 times its width. If the perimeter of the rectangle is 48 units, find the dimensions of the rectangle.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We need to find the length and width of a rectangle.
   - The length (L) is 3 times the width (W).
   - The perimeter (P) of the rectangle is 48 units.

2. **Write Down the Known Formulas:**
   - The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is:
     \[
     P = 2L + 2W
     \]
   - We know that \( L = 3W \).

3. **Substitute the Known Values:**
   - Substitute \( L = 3W \) into the perimeter formula:
     \[
     48 = 2(3W) + 2W
     \]

4. **Simplify the Equation:**
   - Simplify the equation:
     \[
     48 = 6W + 2W
     \]
   - Combine like terms:
     \[
     48 = 8W
     \]

5. **Solve for W:**
   - Divide both sides by 8 to solve for \( W \):
     \[
     W = \frac{48}{8} = 6
     \]

6. **Find the Length L:**
   - Since \( L = 3W \), substitute \( W = 6 \) into the equation for \( L \):
     \[
     L = 3 \times 6 = 18
     \]

7. **Verify the Solution:**
   - Check the perimeter with the found dimensions:
     \[
     P = 2L + 2W = 2(18) + 2(6) = 36 + 12 = 48
     \]
   - The calculated perimeter matches the given perimeter, confirming our solution is correct.

**Final Answer:**
The dimensions of the rectangle are:
- Width (W) = 6 units
- Length (L) = 18 units
