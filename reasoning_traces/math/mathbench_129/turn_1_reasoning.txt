==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample math problem 129" refers to. Since the problem itself is not explicitly stated, I will assume it is a placeholder for a typical math problem. Let's create a sample math problem and solve it step by step.

**Sample Math Problem:**

Calculate the value of \( x \) in the equation:

\[ 3x + 5 = 2x + 10 \]

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Equation:**
   The given equation is a linear equation in one variable, \( x \). Our goal is to find the value of \( x \) that satisfies this equation.

2. **Simplify the Equation:**
   Start by getting all terms involving \( x \) on one side of the equation and constant terms on the other side. We can do this by subtracting \( 2x \) from both sides:

   \[
   3x + 5 - 2x = 2x + 10 - 2x
   \]

   Simplifying both sides gives:

   \[
   x + 5 = 10
   \]

3. **Isolate \( x \):**
   To solve for \( x \), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. Subtract 5 from both sides:

   \[
   x + 5 - 5 = 10 - 5
   \]

   Simplifying both sides gives:

   \[
   x = 5
   \]

4. **Verify the Solution:**
   Substitute \( x = 5 \) back into the original equation to verify:

   \[
   3(5) + 5 = 2(5) + 10
   \]

   Simplifying both sides:

   \[
   15 + 5 = 10 + 10
   \]

   \[
   20 = 20
   \]

   Since both sides of the equation are equal, our solution \( x = 5 \) is correct.

**Final Answer:**

The value of \( x \) is \( 5 \).
