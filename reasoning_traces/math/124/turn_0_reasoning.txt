To solve this problem, we need to determine how many feet of yarn Joy used for the second ball, given the relationships between the sizes of the balls of yarn.

Let's define the variables:
- Let \( x \) be the amount of yarn (in feet) used for the first ball.
- The second ball is twice the size of the first ball, so the amount of yarn used for the second ball is \( 2x \).
- The third ball is three times the size of the first ball, so the amount of yarn used for the third ball is \( 3x \).

According to the problem, Joy used 27 feet of yarn for the third ball. Therefore, we can set up the following equation based on the information given:

\[
3x = 27
\]

To find \( x \), we solve the equation by dividing both sides by 3:

\[
x = \frac{27}{3} = 9
\]

Now that we know \( x = 9 \), we can find the amount of yarn used for the second ball. Since the second ball uses \( 2x \) feet of yarn, we calculate:

\[
2x = 2 \times 9 = 18
\]

Therefore, Joy used 18 feet of yarn for the second ball.

Final Answer:
Joy used 18 feet of yarn for the second ball.
