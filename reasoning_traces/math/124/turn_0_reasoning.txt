To solve the problem, we need to determine how many letters were in the pile of already-stamped letters before Jennie started putting stamps on the letters needing stamps.

1. **Identify the total number of letters needing stamps**: 
   Jennie has a pile of 60 letters that need stamps.

2. **Determine how many letters Jennie stamps**: 
   Jennie puts stamps on one-third of the letters needing stamps. 
   To find out how many letters that is, we calculate:
   \[
   \text{Number of letters stamped} = \frac{1}{3} \times 60 = 20
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of letters remaining that still need stamps**: 
   After Jennie stamps 20 letters, the number of letters still needing stamps is:
   \[
   \text{Remaining letters needing stamps} = 60 - 20 = 40
   \]

4. **Determine the total number of letters after Jennie stamps**: 
   After Jennie puts stamps on the letters, the total number of letters in the office is the sum of the already-stamped letters and the letters that still need stamps. We know that there are now 30 letters in the pile of already-stamped letters:
   \[
   \text{Total letters after stamping} = \text{Already-stamped letters} + \text{Remaining letters needing stamps}
   \]
   Substituting the known values:
   \[
   \text{Total letters after stamping} = 30 + 40 = 70
   \]

5. **Determine how many letters were in the already-stamped pile before Jennie started**: 
   Let \( x \) be the number of letters in the already-stamped pile before Jennie started. After Jennie stamps 20 letters, the number of already-stamped letters becomes:
   \[
   x + 20
   \]
   We know that after Jennie stamps, there are 30 already-stamped letters:
   \[
   x + 20 = 30
   \]

6. **Solve for \( x \)**:
   To find \( x \), we rearrange the equation:
   \[
   x = 30 - 20 = 10
   \]

Thus, the number of letters in the pile of already-stamped letters when Jennie began is \( \boxed{10} \).
