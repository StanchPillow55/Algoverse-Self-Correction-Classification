==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to establish the relationships between the sizes of the yarn balls and the amount of yarn used for each.

1. **Define the sizes of the balls:**
   - Let the size of the first ball be \( x \).
   - According to the problem, the second ball is twice the size of the first ball, so the size of the second ball is \( 2x \).
   - The third ball is three times the size of the first ball, so the size of the third ball is \( 3x \).

2. **Yarn used for the third ball:**
   - We know from the problem that Joy used 27 feet of yarn for the third ball. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
   \[
   3x = 27
   \]

3. **Solve for \( x \):**
   - To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 3:
   \[
   x = \frac{27}{3} = 9
   \]

4. **Determine the size of the second ball:**
   - Now that we have \( x \), we can find the size of the second ball:
   \[
   \text{Size of the second ball} = 2x = 2 \times 9 = 18
   \]

5. **Determine the amount of yarn used for the second ball:**
   - The problem does not directly state how the amount of yarn relates to the size of the balls, but we can assume that the amount of yarn used is proportional to the size of the balls. Since we know the third ball (size \( 3x \)) used 27 feet of yarn, we can find the amount of yarn used for the second ball (size \( 2x \)) using the ratio of their sizes:
   \[
   \text{Yarn for the second ball} = \left(\frac{2x}{3x}\right) \times 27 = \frac{2}{3} \times 27
   \]

6. **Calculate the yarn used for the second ball:**
   \[
   \text{Yarn for the second ball} = \frac{2}{3} \times 27 = 18 \text{ feet}
   \]

Thus, the amount of yarn Joy used for the second ball is **18 feet**.

**Final Answer: 18 feet**
