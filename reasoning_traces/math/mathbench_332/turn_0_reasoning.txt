==================================================

To solve the problem, we first need to understand what "Sample math problem 332" refers to. Since I don't have specific information about this problem, I'll create a hypothetical math problem and solve it step by step. Let's assume the problem is as follows:

**Problem:**
Solve for \( x \) in the equation:
\[ 3x + 5 = 2x + 9 \]

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Identify the Equation:**
   The given equation is:
   \[ 3x + 5 = 2x + 9 \]

2. **Isolate the Variable:**
   To solve for \( x \), we need to get all terms involving \( x \) on one side of the equation and constant terms on the other side.

   - Subtract \( 2x \) from both sides to move the \( x \)-terms to one side:
     \[
     3x + 5 - 2x = 2x + 9 - 2x
     \]
     Simplifying gives:
     \[
     x + 5 = 9
     \]

3. **Solve for \( x \):**
   - Subtract 5 from both sides to isolate \( x \):
     \[
     x + 5 - 5 = 9 - 5
     \]
     Simplifying gives:
     \[
     x = 4
     \]

4. **Verify the Solution:**
   Substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies the equation:
   \[
   3(4) + 5 = 2(4) + 9
   \]
   Calculate both sides:
   \[
   12 + 5 = 8 + 9
   \]
   \[
   17 = 17
   \]
   Since both sides are equal, \( x = 4 \) is indeed the correct solution.

**Final Answer:**
The solution to the equation \( 3x + 5 = 2x + 9 \) is \( x = 4 \).
