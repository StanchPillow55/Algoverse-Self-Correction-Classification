==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 332," we need to first understand what the problem is asking. However, the problem statement "Sample math problem 332" is not specific enough for us to determine what the mathematical question is. 

In order to proceed, let's assume that "Sample math problem 332" refers to a specific math problem that involves typical operations or concepts found in math problems. Since we don't have the actual problem, I'll create a hypothetical math problem and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**
Let's assume "Sample math problem 332" is the following:

"Find the value of \( x \) if \( 2x + 3 = 11 \)."

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Equation:**
   The equation given is \( 2x + 3 = 11 \). This is a linear equation in one variable, \( x \).

2. **Isolate the Variable:**
   To solve for \( x \), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We can do this by performing inverse operations.

3. **Subtract 3 from Both Sides:**
   To eliminate the constant term on the left side, subtract 3 from both sides of the equation:
   \[
   2x + 3 - 3 = 11 - 3
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   2x = 8
   \]

4. **Divide Both Sides by 2:**
   Now, divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( x \):
   \[
   \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{8}{2}
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   x = 4
   \]

5. **Verify the Solution:**
   Substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation to verify:
   \[
   2(4) + 3 = 11
   \]
   Simplifying the left side gives:
   \[
   8 + 3 = 11
   \]
   Since both sides of the equation are equal, our solution is verified.

**Final Answer:**
The value of \( x \) is 4.

This is a complete solution to the hypothetical problem based on the assumption made. If "Sample math problem 332" refers to a different problem, please provide the specific details or context of the problem for an accurate solution.
