==================================================

To solve the sample math problem 332, we need to first understand what the problem is asking. Since the problem statement is not fully provided, let's assume a hypothetical problem for demonstration purposes. Let's say the problem is:

"Calculate the sum of all even numbers between 1 and 332."

To solve this problem, we will follow these steps:

1. **Identify the Even Numbers:**
   - Even numbers are integers divisible by 2. Between 1 and 332, the even numbers start from 2 and go up to 332.

2. **Determine the Sequence of Even Numbers:**
   - The sequence of even numbers between 1 and 332 is: 2, 4, 6, ..., 332.
   - This sequence is an arithmetic sequence where the first term \( a_1 = 2 \) and the common difference \( d = 2 \).

3. **Find the Number of Terms in the Sequence:**
   - The general formula for the \( n \)-th term of an arithmetic sequence is:
     \[
     a_n = a_1 + (n-1) \cdot d
     \]
   - We need to find \( n \) such that \( a_n = 332 \):
     \[
     332 = 2 + (n-1) \cdot 2
     \]
     \[
     332 = 2 + 2n - 2
     \]
     \[
     332 = 2n
     \]
     \[
     n = \frac{332}{2} = 166
     \]
   - There are 166 even numbers between 1 and 332.

4. **Calculate the Sum of the Sequence:**
   - The sum \( S_n \) of the first \( n \) terms of an arithmetic sequence is given by:
     \[
     S_n = \frac{n}{2} \cdot (a_1 + a_n)
     \]
   - Substituting the known values:
     \[
     S_{166} = \frac{166}{2} \cdot (2 + 332)
     \]
     \[
     S_{166} = 83 \cdot 334
     \]

5. **Perform the Multiplication:**
   - Calculate \( 83 \times 334 \):
     \[
     83 \times 334 = 83 \times (300 + 30 + 4)
     \]
     \[
     = 83 \times 300 + 83 \times 30 + 83 \times 4
     \]
     \[
     = 24900 + 2490 + 332
     \]
     \[
     = 24900 + 2490 + 332 = 27722
     \]

6. **Final Answer:**
   - The sum of all even numbers between 1 and 332 is \( \boxed{27722} \).

This solution demonstrates a step-by-step approach to solving an arithmetic sequence problem, assuming the problem was about summing even numbers between 1 and 332. If the actual problem 332 is different, please provide the specific details for an accurate solution.
