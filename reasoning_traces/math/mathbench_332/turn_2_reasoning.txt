Question ID: mathbench_332
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we first need to understand what "Sample math problem 332" entails. Since the problem statement is not explicitly given, let's assume a generic math problem that involves basic arithmetic or algebra, as the number "332" does not provide specific context.

Let's create a hypothetical math problem involving the number 332:

**Problem:**  
Find the sum of the digits of the number 332 and determine if the sum is a prime number.

**Step-by-step Solution:**

1. **Identify the digits of the number 332:**
   - The number 332 consists of three digits: 3, 3, and 2.

2. **Calculate the sum of the digits:**
   - Add the digits together: \(3 + 3 + 2\).

3. **Perform the addition:**
   - \(3 + 3 = 6\)
   - \(6 + 2 = 8\)

4. **Determine if the sum is a prime number:**
   - A prime number is a number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.
   - The number 8 is not a prime number because it can be divided evenly by 1, 2, 4, and 8.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The sum of the digits of 332 is 8.
   - Since 8 is not a prime number, the sum is not prime.

**Final Answer:**
The sum of the digits of 332 is 8, and it is not a prime number.
