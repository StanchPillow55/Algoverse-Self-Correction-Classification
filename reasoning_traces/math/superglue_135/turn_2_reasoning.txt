Question ID: superglue_135
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample reasoning question 135," we need to first understand what the problem is asking. However, the problem statement provided is incomplete and lacks specific details or context. Therefore, I will demonstrate a general approach to solving a reasoning problem by making some assumptions and providing a step-by-step solution.

### Step 1: Understand the Problem
Assume that "Sample reasoning question 135" refers to a typical math reasoning problem. Let's say it involves finding the value of an unknown variable \( x \) given a specific equation or set of conditions.

### Step 2: Set Up the Equation
For demonstration purposes, let's assume the problem is:
"Find the value of \( x \) if \( 3x + 5 = 20 \)."

### Step 3: Solve the Equation
To find the value of \( x \), we need to isolate \( x \) on one side of the equation.

1. **Subtract 5 from both sides:**
   \[
   3x + 5 - 5 = 20 - 5
   \]
   \[
   3x = 15
   \]

2. **Divide both sides by 3:**
   \[
   \frac{3x}{3} = \frac{15}{3}
   \]
   \[
   x = 5
   \]

### Step 4: Verify the Solution
Substitute \( x = 5 \) back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies the equation:
\[
3(5) + 5 = 15 + 5 = 20
\]
The left-hand side equals the right-hand side, confirming that \( x = 5 \) is the correct solution.

### Step 5: State the Final Answer
The value of \( x \) is \( 5 \).

### Conclusion
Since the original problem statement "Sample reasoning question 135" was not provided in detail, I assumed a typical algebraic reasoning problem for demonstration. If you have a specific problem or more details, please provide them, and I can offer a more tailored solution.
