==================================================

It seems like there might be some confusion with the question "Sample reasoning question 135." This doesn't provide specific details about a math problem to solve. However, I can guide you through a generic problem-solving approach or help with a specific type of math problem if you provide more details.

For now, let's assume a generic math problem-solving approach:

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - Read the problem carefully.
   - Identify what is being asked.
   - Determine what information is given and what needs to be found.

2. **Devise a Plan:**
   - Think about the strategies that could be used to solve the problem. This could include algebraic manipulation, drawing a diagram, or breaking the problem into smaller parts.

3. **Carry Out the Plan:**
   - Execute the chosen strategy step by step.
   - Perform calculations carefully and check each step for accuracy.

4. **Review/Check the Solution:**
   - Verify that the solution makes sense in the context of the problem.
   - Check calculations for errors.
   - Ensure that the answer addresses the question asked.

Since the problem is unspecified, let's solve a sample math problem using this approach:

**Sample Problem:**
Solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).

**Step 1: Understand the Problem**
- We need to find the value of \( x \) that satisfies the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).

**Step 2: Devise a Plan**
- To isolate \( x \), we can use basic algebraic operations: subtraction and division.

**Step 3: Carry Out the Plan**
1. Start with the equation: 
   \[
   2x + 3 = 11
   \]
2. Subtract 3 from both sides to isolate the term with \( x \):
   \[
   2x + 3 - 3 = 11 - 3
   \]
   \[
   2x = 8
   \]
3. Divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( x \):
   \[
   \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{8}{2}
   \]
   \[
   x = 4
   \]

**Step 4: Review/Check the Solution**
- Substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation to verify:
  \[
  2(4) + 3 = 8 + 3 = 11
  \]
- The left side equals the right side, confirming that \( x = 4 \) is correct.

**Final Answer:**
The solution to the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \) is \( x = 4 \).
