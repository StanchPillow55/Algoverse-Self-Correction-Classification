Question ID: superglue_135
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we first need to understand what "Sample reasoning question 135" refers to. However, since the problem statement does not provide any specific details or context about the question, we need to make some assumptions or request additional information.

Let's assume that "Sample reasoning question 135" is a placeholder for a typical math problem. Without specific details, I will demonstrate a general approach to solving a math problem using logical reasoning and step-by-step calculations.

### Step-by-Step Approach:

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - Identify what is being asked.
   - Determine the information given and what needs to be found.

2. **Devise a Plan:**
   - Choose a strategy to solve the problem. This could involve algebraic manipulation, drawing a diagram, or breaking the problem into smaller parts.

3. **Carry Out the Plan:**
   - Execute the chosen strategy step by step.
   - Perform calculations carefully and check each step for accuracy.

4. **Review/Check the Solution:**
   - Verify that the solution is correct and answers the question.
   - Consider if there is another way to solve the problem or if the solution can be simplified.

### Example Problem (Hypothetical):

**Problem:** Solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).

**Step 1: Understand the Problem**
- We need to find the value of \( x \) that satisfies the equation.

**Step 2: Devise a Plan**
- Use algebraic manipulation to isolate \( x \).

**Step 3: Carry Out the Plan**
- Start with the equation: \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).
- Subtract 3 from both sides to isolate the term with \( x \):
  \[
  2x + 3 - 3 = 11 - 3
  \]
  \[
  2x = 8
  \]
- Divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( x \):
  \[
  \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{8}{2}
  \]
  \[
  x = 4
  \]

**Step 4: Review/Check the Solution**
- Substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation to verify:
  \[
  2(4) + 3 = 8 + 3 = 11
  \]
- The left-hand side equals the right-hand side, confirming that \( x = 4 \) is correct.

**Final Answer:**
- The solution to the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \) is \( x = 4 \).

Since the original problem statement was not provided, this example demonstrates a general approach to solving a math problem using logical reasoning and step-by-step calculations. If you have a specific problem or additional details, please provide them for a more tailored solution.
