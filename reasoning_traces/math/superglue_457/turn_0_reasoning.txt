==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 457" entails. Since this is a placeholder and not an actual math problem, I will create a sample math problem and solve it step by step.

Let's assume the problem is as follows:

**Problem:**  
A rectangle has a length that is twice its width. If the perimeter of the rectangle is 36 units, what are the dimensions of the rectangle?

**Step 1: Understand the problem.**  
We need to find the length and width of the rectangle. We know:
- The length (L) is twice the width (W), so \( L = 2W \).
- The perimeter (P) of a rectangle is given by the formula \( P = 2L + 2W \).
- The perimeter is 36 units.

**Step 2: Set up the equation.**  
Using the perimeter formula:
\[ 2L + 2W = 36 \]

Substitute \( L = 2W \) into the equation:
\[ 2(2W) + 2W = 36 \]

**Step 3: Simplify and solve for W.**  
\[ 4W + 2W = 36 \]  
\[ 6W = 36 \]  
Divide both sides by 6:
\[ W = 6 \]

**Step 4: Find the length using the width.**  
Since \( L = 2W \):
\[ L = 2 \times 6 = 12 \]

**Step 5: Verify the solution.**  
Check if the perimeter is indeed 36 units with these dimensions:
\[ 2L + 2W = 2(12) + 2(6) = 24 + 12 = 36 \]

The calculations are correct.

**Final Answer:**  
The dimensions of the rectangle are:
- Width = 6 units
- Length = 12 units
