Question ID: superglue_457
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample reasoning question 457," we need to first understand what the problem is asking. However, the problem statement provided is incomplete and lacks specific details or numerical information. Therefore, I'll demonstrate a general approach to solving a typical math problem by outlining the steps and reasoning involved.

### Step-by-Step Approach:

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - Identify what is being asked.
   - Determine what information is given.
   - Clarify any terms or concepts that are unclear.

2. **Devise a Plan:**
   - Consider possible strategies to solve the problem, such as:
     - Drawing a diagram.
     - Creating an equation.
     - Using logical reasoning.
     - Breaking the problem into smaller parts.

3. **Carry Out the Plan:**
   - Execute the chosen strategy.
   - Perform calculations carefully.
   - Keep track of units and ensure consistency.

4. **Check Your Work:**
   - Verify each step of your solution.
   - Check calculations for accuracy.
   - Ensure the solution makes sense in the context of the problem.

5. **State the Final Answer:**
   - Clearly present the solution.
   - Include units if applicable.
   - Confirm that the answer addresses the original question.

### Example Problem:

Since the original problem is not provided, let's consider a simple example problem to illustrate the process:

**Example Problem:**  
Find the value of \( x \) if \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).

**Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We need to solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).

2. **Devise a Plan:**
   - We can isolate \( x \) by performing algebraic operations.

3. **Carry Out the Plan:**
   - Subtract 3 from both sides of the equation:
     \[
     2x + 3 - 3 = 11 - 3
     \]
     \[
     2x = 8
     \]
   - Divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( x \):
     \[
     \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{8}{2}
     \]
     \[
     x = 4
     \]

4. **Check Your Work:**
   - Substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation to verify:
     \[
     2(4) + 3 = 8 + 3 = 11
     \]
   - The left side equals the right side, confirming the solution is correct.

5. **State the Final Answer:**
   - The value of \( x \) is \( 4 \).

### Conclusion:

Without specific details for "Sample reasoning question 457," I provided a general framework for solving math problems and demonstrated it with an example. If you have a specific problem or additional details, please provide them, and I can offer a more tailored solution.
