==================================================

To solve the problem effectively, let's first clarify what "Sample reasoning question 457" might entail. Since the problem statement is not explicitly given, I'll create a hypothetical math problem and solve it step by step, showing all calculations and reasoning.

**Hypothetical Problem:**

"Calculate the sum of all even numbers between 1 and 457."

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Identify the Range of Even Numbers:**
   - The even numbers between 1 and 457 start from 2 and go up to 456 (since 457 is odd).

2. **Determine the Sequence of Even Numbers:**
   - The sequence of even numbers can be represented as: 2, 4, 6, ..., 456.

3. **Recognize the Sequence as an Arithmetic Sequence:**
   - This sequence is an arithmetic sequence where the first term \( a_1 = 2 \) and the common difference \( d = 2 \).

4. **Find the Number of Terms in the Sequence:**
   - The general formula for the \( n \)-th term of an arithmetic sequence is:
     \[
     a_n = a_1 + (n-1) \cdot d
     \]
   - We need to find \( n \) such that \( a_n = 456 \):
     \[
     456 = 2 + (n-1) \cdot 2
     \]
     \[
     456 = 2 + 2n - 2
     \]
     \[
     456 = 2n
     \]
     \[
     n = \frac{456}{2} = 228
     \]
   - So, there are 228 even numbers between 1 and 457.

5. **Calculate the Sum of the Arithmetic Sequence:**
   - The sum \( S_n \) of the first \( n \) terms of an arithmetic sequence is given by:
     \[
     S_n = \frac{n}{2} \cdot (a_1 + a_n)
     \]
   - Plug in the values:
     \[
     S_{228} = \frac{228}{2} \cdot (2 + 456)
     \]
     \[
     S_{228} = 114 \cdot 458
     \]

6. **Perform the Multiplication:**
   - Calculate \( 114 \times 458 \):
     \[
     114 \times 458 = 114 \times (400 + 50 + 8)
     \]
     \[
     = 114 \times 400 + 114 \times 50 + 114 \times 8
     \]
     \[
     = 45600 + 5700 + 912
     \]
     \[
     = 52212
     \]

**Final Answer:**

The sum of all even numbers between 1 and 457 is \( \boxed{52212} \).
