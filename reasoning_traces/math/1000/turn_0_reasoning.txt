To determine how many hours Doctor Jones will have left to update his records after spending time with inpatients and appointments, we will break down the time he spends on each activity step by step.

1. **Time spent with inpatients**:
   - Doctor Jones has **9 inpatients**.
   - Each inpatient takes **20 minutes** for rounds.
   - Total time spent on inpatients can be calculated as follows:
     \[
     \text{Total time for inpatients} = \text{Number of inpatients} \times \text{Time per inpatient}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total time for inpatients} = 9 \times 20 \text{ minutes} = 180 \text{ minutes}
     \]

2. **Time spent on appointments**:
   - Doctor Jones has **10 appointments**.
   - Each appointment takes **30 minutes**.
   - Total time spent on appointments can be calculated as follows:
     \[
     \text{Total time for appointments} = \text{Number of appointments} \times \text{Time per appointment}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total time for appointments} = 10 \times 30 \text{ minutes} = 300 \text{ minutes}
     \]

3. **Total time spent on both activities**:
   - Now, we will add the time spent on inpatients and appointments:
     \[
     \text{Total time spent} = \text{Total time for inpatients} + \text{Total time for appointments}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total time spent} = 180 \text{ minutes} + 300 \text{ minutes} = 480 \text{ minutes}
     \]

4. **Convert total time spent to hours**:
   - Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we convert the total time spent into hours:
     \[
     \text{Total time spent in hours} = \frac{480 \text{ minutes}}{60 \text{ minutes/hour}} = 8 \text{ hours}
     \]

5. **Calculate remaining time**:
   - Doctor Jones has **9 hours** available at the clinic. We will subtract the total time spent from the total available time:
     \[
     \text{Remaining time} = \text{Total available time} - \text{Total time spent}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Remaining time} = 9 \text{ hours} - 8 \text{ hours} = 1 \text{ hour}
     \]

Thus, Doctor Jones will have **1 hour** left to update his records.

**Final Answer**: Doctor Jones has 1 hour left to update his records.
