Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we will calculate the depth of the river at each specified time (mid-May, mid-June, and mid-July) step by step.

1. **Depth in mid-May**: 
   - The problem states that the river is 5 feet deep in mid-May.
   \[
   \text{Depth in mid-May} = 5 \text{ feet}
   \]

2. **Depth in mid-June**: 
   - By mid-June, the river is 10 feet deeper than it was in mid-May. Therefore, we need to add 10 feet to the depth from mid-May.
   \[
   \text{Depth in mid-June} = \text{Depth in mid-May} + 10 \text{ feet}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Depth in mid-June} = 5 \text{ feet} + 10 \text{ feet} = 15 \text{ feet}
   \]

3. **Depth in mid-July**: 
   - By mid-July, the river is three times deeper than it was in mid-June. We will multiply the depth from mid-June by 3.
   \[
   \text{Depth in mid-July} = 3 \times \text{Depth in mid-June}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Depth in mid-July} = 3 \times 15 \text{ feet} = 45 \text{ feet}
   \]

Now that we have calculated the depth of the river at each time point, we can summarize our findings:

- Depth in mid-May: 5 feet
- Depth in mid-June: 15 feet
- Depth in mid-July: 45 feet

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\text{The river is } 45 \text{ feet deep by mid-July.}
\]
