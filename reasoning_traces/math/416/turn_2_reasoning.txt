==================================================

To solve the problem, we will calculate the depth of the river at each specified time step: mid-May, mid-June, and mid-July.

1. **Depth in Mid-May**:
   The problem states that in mid-May, the river is 5 feet deep.
   \[
   \text{Depth in mid-May} = 5 \text{ feet}
   \]

2. **Depth in Mid-June**:
   By mid-June, the river is 10 feet deeper than it was in mid-May. Therefore, we add 10 feet to the depth from mid-May.
   \[
   \text{Depth in mid-June} = \text{Depth in mid-May} + 10 \text{ feet} = 5 \text{ feet} + 10 \text{ feet} = 15 \text{ feet}
   \]

3. **Depth in Mid-July**:
   By mid-July, the river is three times deeper than it was in mid-June. We will multiply the depth from mid-June by 3.
   \[
   \text{Depth in mid-July} = 3 \times \text{Depth in mid-June} = 3 \times 15 \text{ feet} = 45 \text{ feet}
   \]

Now, we have calculated the depth of the river at each stage:
- Mid-May: 5 feet
- Mid-June: 15 feet
- Mid-July: 45 feet

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\text{The depth of the river by mid-July is } 45 \text{ feet.}
\]
