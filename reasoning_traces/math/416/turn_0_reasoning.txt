To solve the problem, we need to set up a system of equations based on the information given about the camels and dromedaries.

Let:
- \( c \) = number of camels
- \( d \) = number of dromedaries

From the problem, we know the following:

1. Each animal has one head. Therefore, the total number of heads can be expressed as:
   \[
   c + d = 180
   \]

2. Camels have 2 humps each, and dromedaries have 1 hump each. The total number of humps can be expressed as:
   \[
   2c + d = 304
   \]

Now we have a system of two equations:
1. \( c + d = 180 \) (Equation 1)
2. \( 2c + d = 304 \) (Equation 2)

Next, we can solve this system of equations. We can start by solving Equation 1 for \( d \):
\[
d = 180 - c
\]

Now, we can substitute this expression for \( d \) into Equation 2:
\[
2c + (180 - c) = 304
\]

Now simplify this equation:
\[
2c + 180 - c = 304
\]
\[
c + 180 = 304
\]
\[
c = 304 - 180
\]
\[
c = 124
\]

Now that we have the number of camels, we can find the number of dromedaries by substituting \( c \) back into the expression for \( d \):
\[
d = 180 - c = 180 - 124 = 56
\]

Thus, the number of dromedaries is \( d = 56 \).

Finally, we can summarize our findings:
- Number of camels \( c = 124 \)
- Number of dromedaries \( d = 56 \)

Therefore, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{56}
\]
