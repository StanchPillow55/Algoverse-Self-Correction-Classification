To solve this problem, we need to determine the depth of the river at different points in time and then calculate the final depth by mid-July.

1. **Depth in Mid-May:**
   - The problem states that in mid-May, the river is 5 feet deep.

2. **Depth in Mid-June:**
   - By mid-June, the river is 10 feet deeper than it was in mid-May.
   - Therefore, we add 10 feet to the mid-May depth:
     \[
     \text{Depth in mid-June} = 5 \text{ feet} + 10 \text{ feet} = 15 \text{ feet}
     \]

3. **Depth in Mid-July:**
   - By mid-July, the river is three times deeper than it was in mid-June.
   - Therefore, we multiply the mid-June depth by 3:
     \[
     \text{Depth in mid-July} = 3 \times 15 \text{ feet} = 45 \text{ feet}
     \]

Thus, by mid-July, the river is 45 feet deep.

**Final Answer:**
The river is 45 feet deep by mid-July.
