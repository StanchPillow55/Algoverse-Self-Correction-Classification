==================================================

To solve the problem effectively, let's first clarify what "Sample reasoning question 158" might entail. Since no specific details are provided, I'll create a hypothetical math problem and solve it step by step. Let's assume the problem is as follows:

**Problem:**

A company produces two types of products: A and B. The production cost for product A is $50 per unit, and for product B, it is $70 per unit. The company has a budget of $7000 for production. Additionally, the company wants to produce at least 50 units of product A and at least 30 units of product B. Determine the maximum number of units of products A and B that the company can produce without exceeding the budget.

**Solution:**

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( x \) be the number of units of product A.
   - Let \( y \) be the number of units of product B.

2. **Set Up the Inequality for the Budget:**
   - The cost for producing \( x \) units of product A is \( 50x \).
   - The cost for producing \( y \) units of product B is \( 70y \).
   - The total production cost should not exceed $7000. Therefore, the inequality is:
     \[
     50x + 70y \leq 7000
     \]

3. **Set Up the Inequalities for Minimum Production:**
   - The company wants to produce at least 50 units of product A:
     \[
     x \geq 50
     \]
   - The company wants to produce at least 30 units of product B:
     \[
     y \geq 30
     \]

4. **Solve the System of Inequalities:**
   - We need to find the maximum values of \( x \) and \( y \) that satisfy all the inequalities.

5. **Substitute the Minimum Values:**
   - Start by substituting the minimum values into the budget inequality to check feasibility:
     \[
     50(50) + 70(30) = 2500 + 2100 = 4600
     \]
   - Since $4600 is less than $7000, producing 50 units of A and 30 units of B is feasible.

6. **Maximize Production:**
   - To maximize production, we need to use the remaining budget:
     \[
     7000 - 4600 = 2400
     \]
   - We can use this remaining budget to produce more units of A or B. Let's explore both options:

   **Option 1: Maximize \( x \) (Product A)**
   - Additional units of A cost $50 each. Calculate how many more units of A can be produced:
     \[
     \frac{2400}{50} = 48
     \]
   - Total units of A: \( 50 + 48 = 98 \)

   **Option 2: Maximize \( y \) (Product B)**
   - Additional units of B cost $70 each. Calculate how many more units of B can be produced:
     \[
     \frac{2400}{70} \approx 34.29
     \]
   - Since we can't produce a fraction of a unit, produce 34 more units of B.
   - Total units of B: \( 30 + 34 = 64 \)

7. **Check Feasibility:**
   - For Option 1 (98 units of A, 30 units of B):
     \[
     50(98) + 70(30) = 4900 + 2100 = 7000
     \]
   - For Option 2 (50 units of A, 64 units of B):
     \[
     50(50) + 70(64) = 2500 + 4480 = 6980
     \]

8. **Conclusion:**
   - Both options are feasible under the budget constraint.
   - The maximum production is achieved with Option 1: 98 units of product A and 30 units of product B.

**Final Answer:**
The company can produce a maximum of 98 units of product A and 30 units of product B without exceeding the budget.
