Question ID: superglue_158
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we first need to understand what "Sample reasoning question 158" refers to. However, since the problem statement does not provide any specific details about the question, we need to make some assumptions or request additional information.

Given the instruction "devils_advocate_v1," it seems like we might be dealing with a hypothetical or abstract reasoning question. Without specific details, I will outline a general approach to solving reasoning problems and then provide a hypothetical example to illustrate the process.

### General Approach to Solving Reasoning Problems:

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - Carefully read the problem statement.
   - Identify what is being asked.
   - Note any given data or constraints.

2. **Analyze the Information:**
   - Break down the information into manageable parts.
   - Look for patterns, relationships, or logical connections.

3. **Develop a Strategy:**
   - Consider different approaches to solving the problem.
   - Choose the most efficient method based on the information available.

4. **Solve the Problem:**
   - Apply the chosen strategy.
   - Perform necessary calculations or logical deductions.

5. **Verify the Solution:**
   - Check the solution for accuracy.
   - Ensure that it satisfies all the conditions of the problem.

6. **State the Final Answer:**
   - Clearly present the solution.

### Hypothetical Example:

Let's assume "Sample reasoning question 158" is a logic puzzle involving a sequence of numbers.

**Problem Statement:**
Find the next number in the sequence: 2, 4, 8, 16, ...

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We need to find the next number in the sequence.

2. **Analyze the Information:**
   - The sequence is: 2, 4, 8, 16, ...
   - Notice that each number is double the previous number.

3. **Develop a Strategy:**
   - Identify the pattern: Each term is obtained by multiplying the previous term by 2.

4. **Solve the Problem:**
   - The last given number is 16.
   - Multiply 16 by 2 to find the next number: \(16 \times 2 = 32\).

5. **Verify the Solution:**
   - Check the pattern: 2, 4, 8, 16, 32.
   - Each number is indeed double the previous one.

6. **State the Final Answer:**
   - The next number in the sequence is 32.

### Final Answer:
The next number in the sequence is 32.
