==================================================

To solve the problem, I need more information about "Sample reasoning question 158." Since the question is not provided, I will demonstrate how to approach a typical math reasoning problem by creating an example problem and solving it step by step.

**Example Problem:**

A farmer has a rectangular field that is 100 meters long and 60 meters wide. He wants to divide the field into smaller rectangular plots, each with an area of 150 square meters. How many such plots can the farmer create?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We have a rectangular field with dimensions 100 meters by 60 meters.
   - The total area of the field is calculated by multiplying the length and width: 
     \[
     \text{Total area} = 100 \, \text{m} \times 60 \, \text{m} = 6000 \, \text{square meters}
     \]
   - Each smaller plot should have an area of 150 square meters.

2. **Determine the Number of Plots:**
   - To find the number of smaller plots, divide the total area of the field by the area of one plot:
     \[
     \text{Number of plots} = \frac{\text{Total area}}{\text{Area of one plot}} = \frac{6000 \, \text{square meters}}{150 \, \text{square meters}}
     \]
   - Perform the division:
     \[
     \frac{6000}{150} = 40
     \]

3. **Verify the Calculation:**
   - Multiply the number of plots by the area of one plot to ensure it matches the total area:
     \[
     40 \, \text{plots} \times 150 \, \text{square meters/plot} = 6000 \, \text{square meters}
     \]
   - The calculation is correct.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The farmer can create 40 smaller plots, each with an area of 150 square meters.

**Final Answer:**
The farmer can create 40 plots.
