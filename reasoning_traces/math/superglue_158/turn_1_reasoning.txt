==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to follow a structured approach. However, since "Sample reasoning question 158" is not a specific math problem, I'll create a hypothetical math problem and solve it step by step. Let's assume the problem is as follows:

**Problem:**

A company produces two types of products: A and B. The profit from each unit of product A is $3, and the profit from each unit of product B is $5. The company can produce a maximum of 100 units of product A and 80 units of product B per day. The company wants to maximize its profit but cannot exceed a total production of 150 units per day due to resource constraints. How many units of each product should the company produce to maximize profit?

**Solution:**

To solve this problem, we need to set up a linear programming model. Let's define the variables:

- Let \( x \) be the number of units of product A produced per day.
- Let \( y \) be the number of units of product B produced per day.

**Objective Function:**

The objective is to maximize the total profit, which can be expressed as:

\[ \text{Maximize } Z = 3x + 5y \]

**Constraints:**

1. The production of product A cannot exceed 100 units:
   \[ x \leq 100 \]

2. The production of product B cannot exceed 80 units:
   \[ y \leq 80 \]

3. The total production cannot exceed 150 units:
   \[ x + y \leq 150 \]

4. Non-negativity constraints:
   \[ x \geq 0 \]
   \[ y \geq 0 \]

**Graphical Solution:**

To solve this linear programming problem graphically, we plot the constraints on a graph.

1. Plot \( x \leq 100 \): This is a vertical line at \( x = 100 \).
2. Plot \( y \leq 80 \): This is a horizontal line at \( y = 80 \).
3. Plot \( x + y \leq 150 \): This is a line with a slope of -1, intersecting the axes at \( x = 150 \) and \( y = 150 \).

The feasible region is the area that satisfies all these constraints. It is a polygon bounded by the lines \( x = 100 \), \( y = 80 \), and \( x + y = 150 \).

**Vertices of the Feasible Region:**

The vertices of the feasible region are points where the constraint lines intersect. We calculate these points:

1. Intersection of \( x = 100 \) and \( y = 80 \): \( (100, 80) \)
2. Intersection of \( x = 100 \) and \( x + y = 150 \): Solve \( 100 + y = 150 \) to get \( y = 50 \). So, the point is \( (100, 50) \).
3. Intersection of \( y = 80 \) and \( x + y = 150 \): Solve \( x + 80 = 150 \) to get \( x = 70 \). So, the point is \( (70, 80) \).
4. Intersection of \( x = 0 \) and \( y = 0 \) (origin), but this is not relevant as it doesn't maximize profit.

**Evaluate the Objective Function at Each Vertex:**

1. At \( (100, 80) \): \( Z = 3(100) + 5(80) = 300 + 400 = 700 \)
2. At \( (100, 50) \): \( Z = 3(100) + 5(50) = 300 + 250 = 550 \)
3. At \( (70, 80) \): \( Z = 3(70) + 5(80) = 210 + 400 = 610 \)

**Conclusion:**

The maximum profit is \( Z = 700 \), which occurs at the point \( (100, 80) \).

**Final Answer:**

To maximize profit, the company should produce 100 units of product A and 80 units of product B per day.
