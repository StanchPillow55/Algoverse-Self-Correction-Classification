==================================================

To solve the problem, we first need to understand what "Sample reasoning question 158" refers to. Since the problem statement does not provide specific details about the question, I'll demonstrate a general approach to solving a typical math problem by breaking it down into steps. Let's assume a hypothetical math problem and solve it step-by-step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**
Calculate the value of \( x \) in the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).

**Step 1: Understand the Problem**
We need to find the value of \( x \) that satisfies the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).

**Step 2: Isolate the Variable**
To solve for \( x \), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We can do this by performing inverse operations.

**Step 3: Perform Inverse Operations**
- Start with the equation: \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).
- Subtract 3 from both sides to eliminate the constant term on the left side:
  \[
  2x + 3 - 3 = 11 - 3
  \]
  Simplifying both sides gives:
  \[
  2x = 8
  \]

**Step 4: Solve for \( x \)**
- Divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( x \):
  \[
  \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{8}{2}
  \]
  Simplifying both sides gives:
  \[
  x = 4
  \]

**Step 5: Verify the Solution**
- Substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies the equation:
  \[
  2(4) + 3 = 11
  \]
  Simplifying the left side gives:
  \[
  8 + 3 = 11
  \]
  Since both sides of the equation are equal, our solution is verified.

**Final Answer:**
The value of \( x \) is 4.

This step-by-step approach can be applied to a wide range of algebraic problems to find the solution systematically. If you have a specific problem or need further assistance, please provide additional details.
