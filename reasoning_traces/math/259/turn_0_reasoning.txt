==================================================

To solve the problem, we will define variables for the number of apples and bananas that Andrea and Jamal have, and then use the information given to set up equations.

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( A_a \) be the number of apples Andrea has.
   - Let \( A_j \) be the number of apples Jamal has.
   - Let \( B_a \) be the number of bananas Andrea has.
   - Let \( B_j \) be the number of bananas Jamal has.

2. **Given Information:**
   - Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal: 
     \[
     A_a = A_j + 8
     \]
   - Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal:
     \[
     B_a = \frac{1}{2} B_j
     \]
   - Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples:
     \[
     B_j = A_j + 4
     \]
   - We also know that Andrea has 52 apples:
     \[
     A_a = 52
     \]

3. **Substituting Known Values:**
   Since we know \( A_a = 52 \), we can substitute this into the first equation:
   \[
   52 = A_j + 8
   \]
   Now, solve for \( A_j \):
   \[
   A_j = 52 - 8 = 44
   \]

4. **Finding Jamal's Bananas:**
   Now we can use the value of \( A_j \) to find \( B_j \):
   \[
   B_j = A_j + 4 = 44 + 4 = 48
   \]

5. **Finding Andrea's Bananas:**
   Now we can find \( B_a \) using the second equation:
   \[
   B_a = \frac{1}{2} B_j = \frac{1}{2} \times 48 = 24
   \]

6. **Calculating Total Fruits:**
   Now we can calculate the total number of fruits:
   - Total fruits = (Andrea's apples + Andrea's bananas) + (Jamal's apples + Jamal's bananas)
   - Total fruits = \( A_a + B_a + A_j + B_j \)
   - Total fruits = \( 52 + 24 + 44 + 48 \)

   Now, let's calculate this step by step:
   \[
   52 + 24 = 76
   \]
   \[
   76 + 44 = 120
   \]
   \[
   120 + 48 = 168
   \]

7. **Final Answer:**
   Therefore, the total number of fruits is \( \boxed{168} \).
