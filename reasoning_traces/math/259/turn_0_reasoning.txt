==================================================

To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the total number of students in class A**:
   We know that 40% of the total 80 students are in class A. We can calculate this as follows:

   \[
   \text{Number of students in class A} = 0.40 \times 80 = 32
   \]

2. **Determine the number of students in class B**:
   The problem states that class B has 21 students fewer than class A. Since we found that class A has 32 students, we can calculate the number of students in class B:

   \[
   \text{Number of students in class B} = \text{Number of students in class A} - 21 = 32 - 21 = 11
   \]

3. **Determine the number of students in class C**:
   Now that we know the number of students in classes A and B, we can find the number of students in class C by subtracting the total number of students in classes A and B from the total number of students at the school.

   First, we calculate the total number of students in classes A and B:

   \[
   \text{Total students in A and B} = \text{Number of students in class A} + \text{Number of students in class B} = 32 + 11 = 43
   \]

   Now, we can find the number of students in class C:

   \[
   \text{Number of students in class C} = \text{Total students} - \text{Total students in A and B} = 80 - 43 = 37
   \]

4. **Final Answer**:
   Therefore, the number of students in class C is:

   \[
   \boxed{37}
   \]
