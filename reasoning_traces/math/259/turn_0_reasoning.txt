==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of students in each class (A, B, and C) and specifically find out how many students are in class C.

1. **Determine the number of students in class A:**

   We know that 40% of the students are in class A. The total number of students in the school is 80.

   \[
   \text{Number of students in class A} = 40\% \times 80 = 0.4 \times 80 = 32
   \]

   So, there are 32 students in class A.

2. **Determine the number of students in class B:**

   We are told that class B has 21 students fewer than class A.

   \[
   \text{Number of students in class B} = \text{Number of students in class A} - 21 = 32 - 21 = 11
   \]

   So, there are 11 students in class B.

3. **Determine the number of students in class C:**

   The total number of students in the school is 80. We have already calculated the number of students in classes A and B. The remaining students are in class C.

   \[
   \text{Number of students in class C} = \text{Total students} - (\text{Number of students in class A} + \text{Number of students in class B})
   \]

   \[
   \text{Number of students in class C} = 80 - (32 + 11) = 80 - 43 = 37
   \]

   So, there are 37 students in class C.

**Final Answer:**

There are 37 students in class C.
