==================================================

Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Identify the cost of the book**: 
   The problem states that the book costs $4. 
   \[
   \text{Cost of the book} = 4 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Determine the cost of the magazine**: 
   According to the problem, the magazine costs half as much as the book. Therefore, we can calculate the cost of the magazine as follows:
   \[
   \text{Cost of the magazine} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Cost of the book} = \frac{1}{2} \times 4 = 2 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Calculate the cost of the pen**: 
   The problem states that the pen costs $1 less than the magazine. We can find the cost of the pen by subtracting $1 from the cost of the magazine:
   \[
   \text{Cost of the pen} = \text{Cost of the magazine} - 1 = 2 - 1 = 1 \text{ dollar}
   \]

4. **Final answer**: 
   After calculating all the costs, we find that the cost of the pen is:
   \[
   \text{Cost of the pen} = 1 \text{ dollar}
   \]

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{1}
\]
