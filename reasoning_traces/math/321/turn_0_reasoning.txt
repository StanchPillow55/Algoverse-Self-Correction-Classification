To solve the problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine Fred's salary five months ago.**
   According to the problem, Fred's salary five months ago was $1000.

2. **Calculate Mike's salary five months ago.**
   The problem states that five months ago, Mike earned 10 times more than Fred. Therefore, we can calculate Mike's salary as follows:
   \[
   \text{Mike's salary five months ago} = 10 \times \text{Fred's salary five months ago} = 10 \times 1000 = 10000
   \]

3. **Calculate Mike's current salary after the increase.**
   Mike's salary has increased by 40 percent. To find the new salary, we first need to calculate the amount of the increase:
   \[
   \text{Increase} = 40\% \text{ of Mike's salary five months ago} = 0.40 \times 10000 = 4000
   \]
   Now, we add this increase to Mike's salary five months ago to find his current salary:
   \[
   \text{Mike's current salary} = \text{Mike's salary five months ago} + \text{Increase} = 10000 + 4000 = 14000
   \]

4. **State the final answer.**
   Therefore, Mike's salary now is:
   \[
   \boxed{14000}
   \]
