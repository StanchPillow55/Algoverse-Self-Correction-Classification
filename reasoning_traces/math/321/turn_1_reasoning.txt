To solve this problem, we need to determine Mike's current salary based on the information provided about his and Fred's past salaries and Mike's salary increase.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Determine Fred's Salary Five Months Ago:**
   - Fred's salary five months ago was given as $1000.

2. **Calculate Mike's Salary Five Months Ago:**
   - Mike earned 10 times more than Fred five months ago.
   - Therefore, Mike's salary five months ago was:
     \[
     \text{Mike's Salary Five Months Ago} = 10 \times \text{Fred's Salary} = 10 \times 1000 = 10000
     \]

3. **Calculate the Increase in Mike's Salary:**
   - Mike's salary has increased by 40% from five months ago.
   - To find the increase, calculate 40% of Mike's salary five months ago:
     \[
     \text{Increase} = 0.40 \times 10000 = 4000
     \]

4. **Calculate Mike's Current Salary:**
   - Add the increase to Mike's salary from five months ago to find his current salary:
     \[
     \text{Mike's Current Salary} = \text{Mike's Salary Five Months Ago} + \text{Increase} = 10000 + 4000 = 14000
     \]

### Final Answer:
Mike's current salary is $14,000.
