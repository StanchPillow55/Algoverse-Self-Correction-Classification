==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to determine Mike's current salary based on the information provided. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Identify Fred's Salary**: 
   - We know that Fred's salary five months ago was $1000.

2. **Calculate Mike's Salary Five Months Ago**:
   - According to the problem, five months ago, Mike earned 10 times more than Fred.
   - Therefore, Mike's salary five months ago can be calculated as:
     \[
     \text{Mike's salary five months ago} = 10 \times \text{Fred's salary}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Mike's salary five months ago} = 10 \times 1000 = 10000
     \]

3. **Calculate Mike's Current Salary**:
   - We are told that Mike's salary has increased by 40% since then.
   - To find the new salary after a 40% increase, we first calculate 40% of Mike's salary five months ago:
     \[
     \text{Increase} = 0.40 \times \text{Mike's salary five months ago}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Increase} = 0.40 \times 10000 = 4000
     \]
   - Now, we add this increase to Mike's salary five months ago to find his current salary:
     \[
     \text{Mike's current salary} = \text{Mike's salary five months ago} + \text{Increase}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Mike's current salary} = 10000 + 4000 = 14000
     \]

4. **Final Answer**:
   - Therefore, Mike's current salary is:
     \[
     \boxed{14000}
     \]
