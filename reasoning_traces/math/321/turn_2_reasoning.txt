Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine Mike's current salary given the information about his past earnings and the increase in his salary.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Understand the Initial Salaries:**
   - Five months ago, Fred's salary was $1000.
   - Mike earned 10 times more than Fred at that time.

2. **Calculate Mike's Salary Five Months Ago:**
   - Since Mike earned 10 times more than Fred, we calculate Mike's salary as follows:
     \[
     \text{Mike's salary five months ago} = 10 \times \text{Fred's salary} = 10 \times 1000 = 10000
     \]
   - Therefore, Mike's salary five months ago was $10,000.

3. **Account for the Salary Increase:**
   - Mike's salary has increased by 40 percent.
   - To find the new salary, we first calculate 40% of Mike's salary five months ago:
     \[
     \text{Increase in salary} = 0.40 \times 10000 = 4000
     \]
   - Add this increase to Mike's original salary to find his current salary:
     \[
     \text{Mike's current salary} = 10000 + 4000 = 14000
     \]

4. **Conclusion:**
   - Mike's current salary is $14,000.

Therefore, the final answer is that Mike's salary now is \(\boxed{14000}\).
