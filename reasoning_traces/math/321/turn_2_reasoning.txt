Question ID: 321
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step.

1. **Determine Fred's salary five months ago:**
   - We are given that Fred's salary five months ago was $1000.

2. **Calculate Mike's salary five months ago:**
   - According to the problem, five months ago, Mike earned 10 times more than Fred. Therefore, we can calculate Mike's salary as follows:
   \[
   \text{Mike's salary five months ago} = 10 \times \text{Fred's salary five months ago} = 10 \times 1000 = 10000
   \]

3. **Calculate Mike's salary increase:**
   - We are told that Mike's salary has increased by 40 percent. To find out how much this increase is, we first calculate 40 percent of Mike's salary five months ago:
   \[
   \text{Increase} = 0.40 \times \text{Mike's salary five months ago} = 0.40 \times 10000 = 4000
   \]

4. **Calculate Mike's current salary:**
   - Now we can find Mike's current salary by adding the increase to his salary five months ago:
   \[
   \text{Mike's current salary} = \text{Mike's salary five months ago} + \text{Increase} = 10000 + 4000 = 14000
   \]

5. **Final answer:**
   - Therefore, Mike's salary now is:
   \[
   \boxed{14000}
   \]
