To determine how much money Sally and Bob will have saved for their trip after a year, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total earnings for each person over the year.**
2. **Determine how much each person saves for the trip.**
3. **Add their savings together to find the total amount saved for the trip.**

### Step 1: Calculate Total Earnings

**Sally's Earnings:**
- Sally earns $6 per day.
- There are 365 days in a year.

Total earnings for Sally:
\[
\text{Total earnings for Sally} = \text{Daily earnings} \times \text{Number of days} = 6 \, \text{dollars/day} \times 365 \, \text{days} = 2190 \, \text{dollars}
\]

**Bob's Earnings:**
- Bob earns $4 per day.

Total earnings for Bob:
\[
\text{Total earnings for Bob} = \text{Daily earnings} \times \text{Number of days} = 4 \, \text{dollars/day} \times 365 \, \text{days} = 1460 \, \text{dollars}
\]

### Step 2: Determine Savings for the Trip

Both Sally and Bob decide to save half of their earnings for the trip.

**Sally's Savings:**
\[
\text{Sally's savings} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Total earnings for Sally} = \frac{1}{2} \times 2190 \, \text{dollars} = 1095 \, \text{dollars}
\]

**Bob's Savings:**
\[
\text{Bob's savings} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Total earnings for Bob} = \frac{1}{2} \times 1460 \, \text{dollars} = 730 \, \text{dollars}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate Total Savings for the Trip

Now, we add Sally's and Bob's savings together to find the total amount saved for the trip.

\[
\text{Total savings for the trip} = \text{Sally's savings} + \text{Bob's savings} = 1095 \, \text{dollars} + 730 \, \text{dollars} = 1825 \, \text{dollars}
\]

### Final Answer

After working through the problem step by step, we find that Sally and Bob will have a total of **$1825** saved for their trip at the end of the year.
