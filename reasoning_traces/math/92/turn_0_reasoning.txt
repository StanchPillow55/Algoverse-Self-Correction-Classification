==================================================

First, let's calculate how much money Sally and Bob make in a year.

There are 365 days in a year. 

So, Sally makes $6 per day * 365 days = $2190 in a year.

Bob makes $4 per day * 365 days = $1460 in a year.

Now, they both decide to save half of what they've earned for their trip.

So, Sally saves $2190 / 2 = $1095 for the trip.

Bob saves $1460 / 2 = $730 for the trip.

Finally, to find out how much money they both have saved for their trip after a year, we add the amounts they have saved.

$1095 (Sally's savings) + $730 (Bob's savings) = $1825

So, Sally and Bob will have saved $1825 for their trip after a year.
