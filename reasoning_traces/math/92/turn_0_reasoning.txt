==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to establish the relationships between the ages of Emily's children based on the information provided.

1. **Identify the known ages:**
   - James is 10 years old.

2. **Establish relationships based on the problem:**
   - James is 1 year younger than Corey. Therefore, we can express Corey's age in terms of James's age:
     \[
     \text{Corey's age} = \text{James's age} + 1 = 10 + 1 = 11 \text{ years old}
     \]

3. **Determine Amy's age:**
   - We know that Amy is 2 years younger than Corey. Thus, we can calculate Amy's age:
     \[
     \text{Amy's age} = \text{Corey's age} - 2 = 11 - 2 = 9 \text{ years old}
     \]

4. **Determine Jackson's age:**
   - According to the problem, Amy is 5 years older than Jackson. We can express Jackson's age in terms of Amy's age:
     \[
     \text{Jackson's age} = \text{Amy's age} - 5 = 9 - 5 = 4 \text{ years old}
     \]

5. **Summarize the ages:**
   - James: 10 years old
   - Corey: 11 years old
   - Amy: 9 years old
   - Jackson: 4 years old

Now, we can conclude that Jackson's age is:

\[
\boxed{4}
\]
