==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine how much money Sally and Bob will save for their trip after working as babysitters for a year. We'll break down the problem step by step.

### Step 1: Determine the number of days in a year
A typical year has 365 days. Since the problem doesn't specify any exceptions (like leap years or days off), we'll assume they work every day of the year.

### Step 2: Calculate Sally's total earnings for the year
Sally earns $6 per day. To find her total earnings for the year, we multiply her daily earnings by the number of days in a year:

\[ \text{Sally's total earnings} = 6 \, \text{dollars/day} \times 365 \, \text{days} \]

\[ \text{Sally's total earnings} = 2190 \, \text{dollars} \]

### Step 3: Calculate Bob's total earnings for the year
Bob earns $4 per day. Similarly, we calculate his total earnings for the year:

\[ \text{Bob's total earnings} = 4 \, \text{dollars/day} \times 365 \, \text{days} \]

\[ \text{Bob's total earnings} = 1460 \, \text{dollars} \]

### Step 4: Calculate the amount saved by Sally
Sally saves half of her earnings for the trip. Therefore, the amount she saves is:

\[ \text{Sally's savings} = \frac{1}{2} \times 2190 \, \text{dollars} \]

\[ \text{Sally's savings} = 1095 \, \text{dollars} \]

### Step 5: Calculate the amount saved by Bob
Bob also saves half of his earnings for the trip. Therefore, the amount he saves is:

\[ \text{Bob's savings} = \frac{1}{2} \times 1460 \, \text{dollars} \]

\[ \text{Bob's savings} = 730 \, \text{dollars} \]

### Step 6: Calculate the total savings for the trip
To find the total amount saved by both Sally and Bob for their trip, we add their individual savings:

\[ \text{Total savings} = \text{Sally's savings} + \text{Bob's savings} \]

\[ \text{Total savings} = 1095 \, \text{dollars} + 730 \, \text{dollars} \]

\[ \text{Total savings} = 1825 \, \text{dollars} \]

### Final Answer
Sally and Bob will have saved a total of $1825 for their trip after a year.
