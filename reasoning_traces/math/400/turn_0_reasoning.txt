To determine how much weight Karen is carrying after six hours of hiking, we need to calculate how much water and food she consumes during that time and then subtract that from her initial total weight.

**Step 1: Calculate the initial total weight.**

Karen packs:
- Water: 20 pounds
- Food: 10 pounds
- Gear: 20 pounds

Total initial weight = Weight of water + Weight of food + Weight of gear
\[
\text{Total initial weight} = 20 \text{ pounds} + 10 \text{ pounds} + 20 \text{ pounds} = 50 \text{ pounds}
\]

**Step 2: Calculate the amount of water consumed in six hours.**

Karen drinks 2 pounds of water per hour. Over six hours, the total amount of water she drinks is:
\[
\text{Water consumed} = 2 \text{ pounds/hour} \times 6 \text{ hours} = 12 \text{ pounds}
\]

**Step 3: Calculate the amount of food consumed in six hours.**

Karen eats 1/3 of the weight of water consumed per hour as food. Since she drinks 2 pounds of water per hour, the amount of food she consumes per hour is:
\[
\text{Food consumed per hour} = \frac{1}{3} \times 2 \text{ pounds} = \frac{2}{3} \text{ pounds/hour}
\]

Over six hours, the total amount of food she eats is:
\[
\text{Food consumed} = \frac{2}{3} \text{ pounds/hour} \times 6 \text{ hours} = 4 \text{ pounds}
\]

**Step 4: Calculate the total weight consumed after six hours.**

Total weight consumed (water + food) is:
\[
\text{Total weight consumed} = \text{Water consumed} + \text{Food consumed} = 12 \text{ pounds} + 4 \text{ pounds} = 16 \text{ pounds}
\]

**Step 5: Calculate the remaining weight after six hours.**

To find out how much weight Karen is carrying after six hours, we subtract the total weight consumed from the initial total weight:
\[
\text{Remaining weight} = \text{Total initial weight} - \text{Total weight consumed}
\]
\[
\text{Remaining weight} = 50 \text{ pounds} - 16 \text{ pounds} = 34 \text{ pounds}
\]

**Final Answer:**
After six hours, Karen is carrying **34 pounds**.
