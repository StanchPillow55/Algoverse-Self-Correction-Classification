==================================================

To determine how many calories John consumed from drinking 2 glasses of milk, we can follow these steps:

1. **Identify the amount of milk in one glass**: 
   - Each glass of milk contains 8 ounces.

2. **Calculate the total amount of milk John drank**:
   - Since John drinks 2 glasses of milk, we multiply the number of glasses by the amount of milk in each glass:
   \[
   \text{Total milk} = 2 \text{ glasses} \times 8 \text{ ounces/glass} = 16 \text{ ounces}
   \]

3. **Determine the calorie content per ounce of milk**:
   - We know that milk has 3 calories per ounce.

4. **Calculate the total calorie consumption**:
   - To find the total calories consumed, we multiply the total ounces of milk by the calories per ounce:
   \[
   \text{Total calories} = 16 \text{ ounces} \times 3 \text{ calories/ounce} = 48 \text{ calories}
   \]

5. **Final answer**:
   - Therefore, the total number of calories John consumed from drinking 2 glasses of milk is:
   \[
   \boxed{48} \text{ calories}
   \]
