To solve this problem, we need to determine how much weight Karen is carrying after six hours of hiking. We'll start by calculating the initial total weight of her backpack and then determine how much weight she loses over the six hours due to consuming water and food.

### Initial Weight Calculation

1. **Water:** 20 pounds
2. **Food:** 10 pounds
3. **Gear:** 20 pounds

The initial total weight of the backpack is the sum of these three components:

\[
\text{Initial Total Weight} = 20 \, \text{pounds (water)} + 10 \, \text{pounds (food)} + 20 \, \text{pounds (gear)} = 50 \, \text{pounds}
\]

### Consumption Over Six Hours

#### Water Consumption

Karen drinks 2 pounds of water per hour. Over six hours, the total water consumed is:

\[
\text{Water Consumed} = 2 \, \text{pounds/hour} \times 6 \, \text{hours} = 12 \, \text{pounds}
\]

#### Food Consumption

Karen eats 1/3 the weight of food per hour as the weight of water she drinks per hour. Since she drinks 2 pounds of water per hour, the food consumed per hour is:

\[
\text{Food Consumed per Hour} = \frac{1}{3} \times 2 \, \text{pounds} = \frac{2}{3} \, \text{pounds}
\]

Over six hours, the total food consumed is:

\[
\text{Food Consumed} = \frac{2}{3} \, \text{pounds/hour} \times 6 \, \text{hours} = 4 \, \text{pounds}
\]

### Remaining Weight Calculation

Now, we calculate the remaining weight of each component after six hours:

1. **Remaining Water:** 
   \[
   \text{Remaining Water} = 20 \, \text{pounds} - 12 \, \text{pounds} = 8 \, \text{pounds}
   \]

2. **Remaining Food:** 
   \[
   \text{Remaining Food} = 10 \, \text{pounds} - 4 \, \text{pounds} = 6 \, \text{pounds}
   \]

3. **Gear Weight:** The gear weight remains unchanged at 20 pounds.

### Final Weight Calculation

The total weight Karen is carrying after six hours is the sum of the remaining weights of water, food, and gear:

\[
\text{Final Total Weight} = 8 \, \text{pounds (water)} + 6 \, \text{pounds (food)} + 20 \, \text{pounds (gear)} = 34 \, \text{pounds}
\]

Therefore, after six hours of hiking, Karen is carrying **34 pounds**.
