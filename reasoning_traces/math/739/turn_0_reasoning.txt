==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to determine the cost of both the gallon jars and the half-gallon jars, and then calculate the total amount Cecelia spent on 10 gallon jars and 16 half-gallon jars.

1. **Identify the cost of the gallon jar**:
   - We are given that a gallon jar costs $5.

2. **Determine the cost of the half-gallon jar**:
   - According to the problem, a gallon jar costs $2 more than a half-gallon jar.
   - Let the cost of the half-gallon jar be \( x \).
   - Therefore, we can set up the equation:
     \[
     x + 2 = 5
     \]
   - Solving for \( x \):
     \[
     x = 5 - 2 = 3
     \]
   - Thus, the cost of a half-gallon jar is $3.

3. **Calculate the total cost for 10 gallon jars**:
   - The cost of one gallon jar is $5.
   - For 10 gallon jars, the total cost is:
     \[
     10 \times 5 = 50
     \]

4. **Calculate the total cost for 16 half-gallon jars**:
   - The cost of one half-gallon jar is $3.
   - For 16 half-gallon jars, the total cost is:
     \[
     16 \times 3 = 48
     \]

5. **Calculate the total amount of money Cecelia spent**:
   - We add the total cost of the gallon jars and the total cost of the half-gallon jars:
     \[
     50 + 48 = 98
     \]

Thus, the total amount of money Cecelia spent is \(\boxed{98}\).
