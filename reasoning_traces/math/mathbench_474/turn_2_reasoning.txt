Question ID: mathbench_474
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the sample math problem 474, we need to first understand what the problem is asking. However, since "Sample math problem 474" is not a specific question, I'll create a hypothetical math problem for demonstration purposes. Let's assume the problem is as follows:

**Problem:**
Calculate the sum of the first 474 positive integers.

**Solution:**

To find the sum of the first \( n \) positive integers, we can use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series:

\[
S_n = \frac{n(n + 1)}{2}
\]

where \( S_n \) is the sum of the first \( n \) integers and \( n \) is the number of terms.

In this case, \( n = 474 \). Plugging this value into the formula gives:

\[
S_{474} = \frac{474 \times (474 + 1)}{2}
\]

First, calculate \( 474 + 1 \):

\[
474 + 1 = 475
\]

Next, multiply 474 by 475:

\[
474 \times 475 = 225150
\]

Now, divide the product by 2 to find the sum:

\[
S_{474} = \frac{225150}{2} = 112575
\]

Therefore, the sum of the first 474 positive integers is \( 112575 \).

**Final Answer:**
112575
