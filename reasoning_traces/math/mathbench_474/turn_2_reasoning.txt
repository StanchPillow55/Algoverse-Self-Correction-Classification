Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample math problem 474" refers to. Since the problem itself isn't specified, I'll assume it's a placeholder for a specific math problem. Without the actual problem, I can't provide a specific solution. However, I can guide you through a general approach to solving math problems.

### General Approach to Solving Math Problems

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - Read the problem carefully.
   - Identify what is being asked.
   - Determine what information is given and what needs to be found.

2. **Devise a Plan:**
   - Think about the mathematical concepts that might apply.
   - Consider similar problems you've solved before.
   - Decide on a strategy (e.g., algebraic manipulation, drawing a diagram, using a formula).

3. **Carry Out the Plan:**
   - Execute your strategy step by step.
   - Perform calculations carefully.
   - Keep track of units and signs.

4. **Check Your Work:**
   - Review each step to ensure accuracy.
   - Verify that your solution makes sense in the context of the problem.
   - Consider alternative methods to confirm your result.

5. **State the Final Answer:**
   - Clearly write down the solution.
   - Include units if applicable.

### Example Problem

Let's create a hypothetical problem to illustrate this process:

**Problem:** Solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).

**Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We need to find the value of \( x \) that satisfies the equation.

2. **Devise a Plan:**
   - This is a linear equation. We can solve it by isolating \( x \).

3. **Carry Out the Plan:**
   - Start with the equation: \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).
   - Subtract 3 from both sides to isolate the term with \( x \):
     \[
     2x + 3 - 3 = 11 - 3 \implies 2x = 8
     \]
   - Divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( x \):
     \[
     \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{8}{2} \implies x = 4
     \]

4. **Check Your Work:**
   - Substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation to verify:
     \[
     2(4) + 3 = 8 + 3 = 11
     \]
   - The left side equals the right side, confirming our solution is correct.

5. **State the Final Answer:**
   - The solution to the equation is \( x = 4 \).

If you have a specific problem labeled as "Sample math problem 474," please provide the details, and I can work through that particular problem for you.
