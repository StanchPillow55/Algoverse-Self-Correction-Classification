==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to determine how many text messages Keiko sent this week based on the information provided about last week's messages.

1. **Identify the number of messages sent last week:**
   - According to the problem, Keiko sent 111 text messages last week.

2. **Calculate the number of messages sent this week:**
   - The problem states that this week she sent 50 less than double what she sent last week.
   - First, we need to calculate double the number of messages sent last week:
     \[
     \text{Double last week's messages} = 2 \times 111 = 222
     \]
   - Next, we need to find 50 less than this amount:
     \[
     \text{Messages sent this week} = 222 - 50 = 172
     \]

3. **Calculate the total number of messages sent over the two weeks:**
   - Now we add the number of messages sent last week to the number of messages sent this week:
     \[
     \text{Total messages} = \text{Messages last week} + \text{Messages this week} = 111 + 172
     \]
   - Performing the addition:
     \[
     111 + 172 = 283
     \]

4. **Final answer:**
   - Therefore, the total number of text messages Keiko sent last week and this week combined is:
     \[
     \boxed{283}
     \]
