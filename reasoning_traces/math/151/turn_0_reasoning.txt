==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of text messages Keiko sent last week and this week, and then find their combined total.

**Step 1: Determine the number of text messages sent last week.**

According to the problem, Keiko sent 111 text messages last week. Therefore, the number of text messages sent last week is:

\[ \text{Last week's messages} = 111 \]

**Step 2: Determine the number of text messages sent this week.**

The problem states that this week, Keiko sent 50 less than double the number of messages she sent last week. First, we calculate double the number of messages sent last week:

\[ 2 \times 111 = 222 \]

Next, we subtract 50 from this result to find the number of messages sent this week:

\[ 222 - 50 = 172 \]

So, Keiko sent 172 text messages this week.

**Step 3: Calculate the total number of text messages sent over the two weeks.**

To find the total number of text messages sent last week and this week combined, we add the number of messages from each week:

\[ 111 + 172 = 283 \]

**Final Answer:**

Keiko sent a total of 283 text messages over the two weeks combined.
