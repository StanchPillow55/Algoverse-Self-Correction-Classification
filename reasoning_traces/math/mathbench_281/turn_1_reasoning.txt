==================================================

To solve the problem, we first need to understand what "Sample math problem 281" refers to. Since the problem itself isn't specified, I'll create a hypothetical math problem labeled as "Sample math problem 281" and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem 281:**

Calculate the value of \( x \) in the equation:

\[ 3x + 7 = 2x + 15 \]

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Identify the Equation:**
   We have the equation:
   \[
   3x + 7 = 2x + 15
   \]

2. **Isolate the Variable:**
   To solve for \( x \), we need to get all terms involving \( x \) on one side of the equation and constant terms on the other side.

   - Subtract \( 2x \) from both sides to move the \( x \) terms to one side:
     \[
     3x + 7 - 2x = 2x + 15 - 2x
     \]
     Simplifying gives:
     \[
     x + 7 = 15
     \]

3. **Solve for \( x \):**
   - Subtract 7 from both sides to isolate \( x \):
     \[
     x + 7 - 7 = 15 - 7
     \]
     Simplifying gives:
     \[
     x = 8
     \]

4. **Verify the Solution:**
   Substitute \( x = 8 \) back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies the equation:
   \[
   3(8) + 7 = 2(8) + 15
   \]
   Calculate both sides:
   \[
   24 + 7 = 16 + 15
   \]
   \[
   31 = 31
   \]
   Since both sides are equal, \( x = 8 \) is indeed the correct solution.

**Final Answer:**

The value of \( x \) is \( 8 \).
