==================================================

To solve the problem, we first need to understand what "Sample math problem 281" refers to. Since the problem is not explicitly stated, I'll assume it's a placeholder for a specific math problem. Without the actual problem, I can't provide a direct solution. However, I can guide you through a generic approach to solving math problems.

Here's a step-by-step guide to solving a typical math problem:

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - Read the problem carefully.
   - Identify what is being asked.
   - Determine what information is given and what needs to be found.

2. **Devise a Plan:**
   - Consider possible strategies to solve the problem. This could include:
     - Drawing a diagram.
     - Creating an equation.
     - Breaking the problem into smaller parts.
     - Looking for patterns.

3. **Carry Out the Plan:**
   - Execute the strategy you have chosen.
   - Perform calculations carefully.
   - Keep track of units and ensure consistency.

4. **Check Your Work:**
   - Review each step to ensure accuracy.
   - Verify that the solution makes sense in the context of the problem.
   - Check calculations for errors.

5. **State the Final Answer:**
   - Clearly present the solution.
   - Include units if applicable.

Since I don't have the specific details of "Sample math problem 281," I can't provide a detailed solution. If you can provide the actual problem, I'd be happy to help solve it step by step.
