==================================================

To solve the problem effectively, I need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 85" refers to. However, since I don't have the specific details of this question, I'll demonstrate a general approach to solving a typical math reasoning problem. Let's assume a hypothetical math problem and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**

A farmer has a total of 85 animals consisting of chickens and cows. If the total number of legs among all the animals is 230, how many chickens and how many cows does the farmer have?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( c \) be the number of chickens.
   - Let \( w \) be the number of cows.

2. **Set Up Equations:**
   - We know the total number of animals is 85:
     \[
     c + w = 85
     \]
   - Chickens have 2 legs and cows have 4 legs. The total number of legs is 230:
     \[
     2c + 4w = 230
     \]

3. **Solve the System of Equations:**
   - From the first equation, express \( c \) in terms of \( w \):
     \[
     c = 85 - w
     \]
   - Substitute \( c = 85 - w \) into the second equation:
     \[
     2(85 - w) + 4w = 230
     \]
   - Simplify and solve for \( w \):
     \[
     170 - 2w + 4w = 230
     \]
     \[
     2w = 230 - 170
     \]
     \[
     2w = 60
     \]
     \[
     w = 30
     \]

4. **Find the Number of Chickens:**
   - Substitute \( w = 30 \) back into the equation for \( c \):
     \[
     c = 85 - 30
     \]
     \[
     c = 55
     \]

5. **Verify the Solution:**
   - Check the total number of legs:
     \[
     2c + 4w = 2(55) + 4(30) = 110 + 120 = 230
     \]
   - The calculations are consistent with the problem statement.

**Final Answer:**

The farmer has 55 chickens and 30 cows.
