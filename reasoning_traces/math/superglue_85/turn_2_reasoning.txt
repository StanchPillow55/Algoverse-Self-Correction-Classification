==================================================

To solve the problem effectively, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 85" entails. Since the problem statement is not provided, I will demonstrate a general approach to solving a typical math problem by outlining the steps and reasoning process. 

Let's assume "Sample reasoning question 85" is a math problem involving algebraic expressions. Hereâ€™s how we might approach solving it:

### Step 1: Understand the Problem
- **Read the problem carefully.** Identify what is being asked. Are we solving for a variable, simplifying an expression, or proving an identity?
- **Identify knowns and unknowns.** What information is provided, and what do we need to find?

### Step 2: Develop a Plan
- **Choose a strategy.** Depending on the problem, strategies might include:
  - Solving equations
  - Factoring expressions
  - Using formulas
  - Graphing
  - Logical reasoning

### Step 3: Execute the Plan
- **Carry out calculations.** Be meticulous with arithmetic and algebraic manipulations.
- **Show all work.** Write each step clearly to avoid errors and to make the reasoning process transparent.

### Step 4: Review and Check
- **Verify the solution.** Check calculations for accuracy.
- **Ensure the solution makes sense.** Does it answer the question? Is it reasonable given the context of the problem?

### Example Problem
Let's create an example problem to illustrate these steps:

**Problem:** Solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).

#### Step 1: Understand the Problem
- We need to find the value of \( x \) that satisfies the equation.

#### Step 2: Develop a Plan
- We will isolate \( x \) by performing algebraic operations.

#### Step 3: Execute the Plan
1. Start with the equation:  
   \[
   2x + 3 = 11
   \]
2. Subtract 3 from both sides to isolate the term with \( x \):  
   \[
   2x + 3 - 3 = 11 - 3
   \]
   \[
   2x = 8
   \]
3. Divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( x \):  
   \[
   \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{8}{2}
   \]
   \[
   x = 4
   \]

#### Step 4: Review and Check
- Substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation to verify:  
  \[
  2(4) + 3 = 8 + 3 = 11
  \]
- The left-hand side equals the right-hand side, confirming our solution is correct.

### Final Answer
The solution to the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \) is \( x = 4 \).

This structured approach ensures clarity and accuracy in solving math problems. If you have a specific problem or additional details for "Sample reasoning question 85," please provide them, and I can tailor the solution accordingly.
