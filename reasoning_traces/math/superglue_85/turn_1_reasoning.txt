==================================================

To solve the problem, we first need to understand what "Sample reasoning question 85" refers to. Since the problem statement is not provided, I will demonstrate a general approach to solving a typical math problem by outlining the steps and reasoning involved. Let's assume a hypothetical math problem and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**
Find the value of \( x \) in the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).

**Step 1: Understand the Problem**
The equation given is a simple linear equation in one variable, \( x \). Our goal is to isolate \( x \) on one side of the equation to find its value.

**Step 2: Simplify the Equation**
The equation is \( 2x + 3 = 11 \). We want to isolate \( x \), so we need to get rid of the constant term on the left side.

**Step 3: Eliminate the Constant Term**
Subtract 3 from both sides of the equation to eliminate the constant term on the left side:
\[
2x + 3 - 3 = 11 - 3
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
2x = 8
\]

**Step 4: Solve for \( x \)**
Now, we need to isolate \( x \) by dividing both sides of the equation by 2:
\[
\frac{2x}{2} = \frac{8}{2}
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
x = 4
\]

**Step 5: Verify the Solution**
Substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation to verify:
\[
2(4) + 3 = 11
\]
\[
8 + 3 = 11
\]
\[
11 = 11
\]
The left side equals the right side, confirming that our solution is correct.

**Final Answer:**
The value of \( x \) is 4.

This step-by-step approach demonstrates how to solve a linear equation by isolating the variable and verifying the solution. If you have a specific problem or need further assistance, please provide additional details or context.
