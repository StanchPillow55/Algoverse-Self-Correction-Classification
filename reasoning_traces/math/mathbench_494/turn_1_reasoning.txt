Question ID: mathbench_494
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, I need to first understand what "Sample math problem 494" refers to. Since I don't have the specific details of this problem, I'll demonstrate how to approach a generic math problem step by step. 

Let's assume "Sample math problem 494" is a typical algebra problem. For example, let's solve the equation:

\[ 2x + 3 = 11 \]

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We need to solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).

2. **Isolate the Variable:**
   - To solve for \( x \), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We start by eliminating the constant term on the left side.

3. **Subtract 3 from Both Sides:**
   \[
   2x + 3 - 3 = 11 - 3
   \]
   \[
   2x = 8
   \]

4. **Divide Both Sides by 2:**
   - Now, divide both sides of the equation by 2 to solve for \( x \).
   \[
   \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{8}{2}
   \]
   \[
   x = 4
   \]

5. **Verify the Solution:**
   - Substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies the equation.
   \[
   2(4) + 3 = 11
   \]
   \[
   8 + 3 = 11
   \]
   \[
   11 = 11
   \]
   - The left side equals the right side, confirming that \( x = 4 \) is the correct solution.

### Final Answer:
The solution to the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \) is \( x = 4 \).

If you have a specific problem labeled as "Sample math problem 494," please provide the details, and I can solve it accordingly.
