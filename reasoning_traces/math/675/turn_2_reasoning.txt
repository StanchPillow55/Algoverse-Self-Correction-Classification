==================================================

To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step.

1. **Initial Situation**:
   - James has 4 toys for 4 dogs. This means each dog currently has one toy.
   - There are 8 more dogs in the shelter, which means the total number of dogs is:
     \[
     4 \text{ (current dogs)} + 8 \text{ (additional dogs)} = 12 \text{ dogs}
     \]

2. **Toys Needed for All Dogs**:
   - Since each dog needs one toy, James will need a total of 12 toys for the 12 dogs.

3. **Toys James Needs to Buy Initially**:
   - James currently has 4 toys, so the number of additional toys he needs to buy is:
     \[
     12 \text{ (total toys needed)} - 4 \text{ (toys on hand)} = 8 \text{ toys}
     \]

4. **After Buying Toys**:
   - James buys 8 toys, bringing his total to:
     \[
     4 \text{ (original toys)} + 8 \text{ (bought toys)} = 12 \text{ toys}
     \]

5. **Situation After Leaving**:
   - When James left, he found that there are now twice as many more dogs than when he left. Initially, there were 8 additional dogs. Twice that amount is:
     \[
     2 \times 8 = 16 \text{ more dogs}
     \]
   - Therefore, the new total number of dogs is:
     \[
     4 \text{ (original dogs)} + 16 \text{ (new dogs)} = 20 \text{ dogs}
     \]

6. **Toys Needed for 20 Dogs**:
   - Now, James needs toys for 20 dogs, so he needs:
     \[
     20 \text{ toys}
     \]

7. **Toys James Needs to Buy Again**:
   - Since he already has 12 toys, the number of additional toys he needs to buy is:
     \[
     20 \text{ (total toys needed)} - 12 \text{ (toys on hand)} = 8 \text{ toys}
     \]

8. **After Returning Again**:
   - When James returns again, he finds that 3 dogs are gone. Therefore, the new total number of dogs is:
     \[
     20 \text{ (previous total)} - 3 \text{ (dogs gone)} = 17 \text{ dogs}
     \]

9. **Final Toys Needed for 17 Dogs**:
   - Now, James needs toys for 17 dogs, so he needs:
     \[
     17 \text{ toys}
     \]

10. **Final Calculation of Toys**:
    - James has 12 toys after his first purchase and needs 17 toys for the 17 dogs. Therefore, the number of additional toys he needs to buy now is:
      \[
      17 \text{ (total toys needed)} - 12 \text{ (toys on hand)} = 5 \text{ toys}
      \]

11. **Total Toys Needed**:
    - In total, James needs to ensure he has enough toys for the final number of dogs, which is 17.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\text{James needs a total of } 17 \text{ toys.}
\]
