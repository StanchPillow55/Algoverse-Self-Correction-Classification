==================================================

To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Initial Situation**:
   - James has 4 toys for 4 dogs. This means each dog currently has one toy.
   - There are 8 more dogs in the shelter, which means the total number of dogs is:
     \[
     4 \text{ (current dogs)} + 8 \text{ (new dogs)} = 12 \text{ dogs}
     \]

2. **Toys Needed Initially**:
   - Since there are 12 dogs and each dog needs one toy, James needs:
     \[
     12 \text{ toys}
     \]
   - James currently has 4 toys, so he needs to buy:
     \[
     12 \text{ (needed toys)} - 4 \text{ (current toys)} = 8 \text{ toys}
     \]

3. **After Buying Toys**:
   - James buys 8 toys, so now he has:
     \[
     4 \text{ (initial toys)} + 8 \text{ (bought toys)} = 12 \text{ toys}
     \]

4. **Returning to the Shelter**:
   - After buying the toys, James goes back to the shelter and finds that there are twice as many more dogs than when he left. Initially, there were 8 new dogs added, so "twice as many more" means:
     \[
     2 \times 8 = 16 \text{ more dogs}
     \]
   - Therefore, the total number of dogs now is:
     \[
     4 \text{ (original dogs)} + 16 \text{ (new dogs)} = 20 \text{ dogs}
     \]

5. **Toys Needed After New Dogs**:
   - Now, with 20 dogs, James needs:
     \[
     20 \text{ toys}
     \]
   - He currently has 12 toys, so he needs to buy:
     \[
     20 \text{ (needed toys)} - 12 \text{ (current toys)} = 8 \text{ more toys}
     \]

6. **Final Situation**:
   - When James comes back again, he finds that 3 dogs are gone. Thus, the total number of dogs is now:
     \[
     20 \text{ (previous total)} - 3 \text{ (dogs gone)} = 17 \text{ dogs}
     \]

7. **Final Toys Needed**:
   - With 17 dogs, James needs:
     \[
     17 \text{ toys}
     \]
   - He currently has 12 toys (after the first purchase) and bought 8 more, so he has:
     \[
     12 \text{ (after first purchase)} + 8 \text{ (second purchase)} = 20 \text{ toys}
     \]

8. **Conclusion**:
   - Since James has 20 toys and only needs 17 toys, he has enough toys for the dogs. However, the question asks how many toys in total does James need, which is simply the number of toys required for the current number of dogs:
     \[
     \text{Total toys needed} = 17
     \]

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{17}
\]
