To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step.

1. **Initial Situation**:
   - James has 4 toys for 4 dogs.
   - Therefore, each dog has one toy, and there are no extra toys.

2. **New Dogs**:
   - James finds out there are 8 more dogs in the shelter.
   - Total number of dogs now = 4 (original dogs) + 8 (new dogs) = 12 dogs.

3. **Toys Needed**:
   - Since each dog needs one toy, James needs 12 toys for 12 dogs.

4. **Toys James Has**:
   - James currently has 4 toys.
   - Therefore, the number of additional toys he needs to buy = 12 (needed) - 4 (on hand) = 8 toys.

5. **After Buying Toys**:
   - James buys 8 toys, so now he has 4 + 8 = 12 toys.

6. **Twice as Many More Dogs**:
   - After buying the toys, he goes back and sees that there are twice as many more dogs than when he left. 
   - When he left, there were 8 new dogs (the additional dogs).
   - Twice as many more dogs = 2 * 8 = 16 additional dogs.
   - Total number of dogs now = 4 (original) + 8 (initial new) + 16 (new additional) = 28 dogs.

7. **Toys Needed Again**:
   - Now, James needs 28 toys for 28 dogs.

8. **Toys James Has**:
   - James still has the 12 toys he bought earlier.
   - Therefore, the number of additional toys he needs to buy now = 28 (needed) - 12 (on hand) = 16 toys.

9. **Final Situation**:
   - James goes back again and finds that 3 dogs are gone.
   - Total number of dogs now = 28 - 3 = 25 dogs.

10. **Final Toys Needed**:
    - Now, James needs 25 toys for 25 dogs.

11. **Toys James Has**:
    - James still has the 12 toys he bought earlier.
    - Therefore, the number of additional toys he needs to buy now = 25 (needed) - 12 (on hand) = 13 toys.

12. **Total Toys Needed**:
    - To summarize, James needs a total of 25 toys for the remaining dogs.

Thus, the final answer is:

**James needs a total of 25 toys.**
