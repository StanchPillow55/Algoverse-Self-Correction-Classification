==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 126" refers to. Since the question itself is not provided, I will assume that it is a placeholder for a specific math problem. Without the actual content of the problem, I will demonstrate a general approach to solving a math problem using logical reasoning and step-by-step calculations.

Let's assume "Sample reasoning question 126" is a typical math problem involving algebra. Here is a hypothetical problem and its solution:

**Hypothetical Problem:**
Solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   The equation given is \( 2x + 3 = 11 \). We need to find the value of \( x \) that makes this equation true.

2. **Isolate the Variable:**
   To solve for \( x \), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We can start by eliminating the constant term on the left side of the equation.

   \[
   2x + 3 = 11
   \]

   Subtract 3 from both sides to remove the constant term:

   \[
   2x + 3 - 3 = 11 - 3
   \]

   Simplifying both sides gives:

   \[
   2x = 8
   \]

3. **Solve for \( x \):**
   Now, we need to solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides of the equation by the coefficient of \( x \), which is 2.

   \[
   \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{8}{2}
   \]

   Simplifying both sides gives:

   \[
   x = 4
   \]

4. **Verify the Solution:**
   To ensure our solution is correct, we substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation to check if it satisfies the equation.

   \[
   2(4) + 3 = 11
   \]

   Simplifying the left side:

   \[
   8 + 3 = 11
   \]

   Since both sides of the equation are equal, our solution \( x = 4 \) is verified.

5. **State the Final Answer:**
   The solution to the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \) is \( x = 4 \).

This step-by-step approach demonstrates how to solve a basic algebraic equation. If "Sample reasoning question 126" refers to a different type of problem, the same logical reasoning and methodical approach can be applied to solve it.
