Question ID: 425
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine how many points Paislee needs to score to tie with Calvin, given that she initially scored 3/4 of Calvin's points.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Determine Paislee's Initial Score:**
   - Calvin's score is given as 500 points.
   - Paislee scored 3/4 times as many points as Calvin.
   - To find Paislee's score, we calculate:
     \[
     \text{Paislee's score} = \frac{3}{4} \times 500
     \]

2. **Calculate Paislee's Initial Score:**
   - Perform the multiplication:
     \[
     \frac{3}{4} \times 500 = \frac{3 \times 500}{4} = \frac{1500}{4} = 375
     \]
   - So, Paislee initially scored 375 points.

3. **Determine the Points Needed to Tie:**
   - To tie with Calvin, Paislee needs to have the same number of points as Calvin, which is 500 points.
   - Calculate the additional points Paislee needs to score to reach 500 points:
     \[
     \text{Additional points needed} = 500 - 375
     \]

4. **Calculate the Additional Points Needed:**
   - Perform the subtraction:
     \[
     500 - 375 = 125
     \]

### Conclusion:

Paislee needs to score an additional 125 points to tie with Calvin. Therefore, the number of points Paislee was required to achieve to have a chance of tying the game is **125 points**.

**Final Answer: 125 points**
