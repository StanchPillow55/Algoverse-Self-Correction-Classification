Question ID: 425
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To determine how many points Paislee scored, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Identify Calvin's Points**: We know from the problem that Calvin scored 500 points.

2. **Calculate Paislee's Points**: The problem states that Paislee scored \( \frac{3}{4} \) times as many points as Calvin. To find Paislee's score, we can set up the following calculation:

   \[
   \text{Paislee's Points} = \frac{3}{4} \times \text{Calvin's Points}
   \]

   Substituting Calvin's points into the equation:

   \[
   \text{Paislee's Points} = \frac{3}{4} \times 500
   \]

3. **Perform the Calculation**:

   First, calculate \( \frac{3}{4} \times 500 \):

   \[
   \frac{3}{4} \times 500 = \frac{3 \times 500}{4} = \frac{1500}{4} = 375
   \]

   So, Paislee scored 375 points.

4. **Determine Points Needed to Tie**: To find out how many points Paislee needs to tie the game, we need to compare her score to Calvin's score. Since Calvin has 500 points, Paislee needs to score enough points to reach 500.

   The points required for Paislee to tie the game can be calculated as follows:

   \[
   \text{Points Needed to Tie} = \text{Calvin's Points} - \text{Paislee's Points}
   \]

   Substituting the known values:

   \[
   \text{Points Needed to Tie} = 500 - 375 = 125
   \]

5. **Final Answer**: Therefore, Paislee needs to score an additional 125 points to tie the game.

Thus, the final answer is:

**125 points**.
