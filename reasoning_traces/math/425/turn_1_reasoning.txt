Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine how many points Paislee needs to score to tie with Calvin, given that she initially scored 3/4 times as many points as Calvin.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Identify Calvin's Score:**
   - Calvin scored 500 points.

2. **Calculate Paislee's Initial Score:**
   - Paislee scored 3/4 times as many points as Calvin.
   - To find Paislee's score, multiply Calvin's score by 3/4:
     \[
     \text{Paislee's Score} = \frac{3}{4} \times 500
     \]
   - Calculate the multiplication:
     \[
     \frac{3}{4} \times 500 = \frac{3 \times 500}{4} = \frac{1500}{4} = 375
     \]
   - So, Paislee initially scored 375 points.

3. **Determine Points Needed to Tie:**
   - To tie the game, Paislee needs to have the same number of points as Calvin.
   - Calvin has 500 points, and Paislee currently has 375 points.
   - Calculate how many more points Paislee needs to tie:
     \[
     \text{Points Needed} = \text{Calvin's Score} - \text{Paislee's Score} = 500 - 375 = 125
     \]

### Conclusion:
Paislee needs to score an additional 125 points to tie the game with Calvin.

**Final Answer:**
Paislee needs 125 more points to tie the game with Calvin.
