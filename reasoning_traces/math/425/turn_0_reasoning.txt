Question ID: 425
Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To determine how many points Paislee scored, we start with the information given in the problem.

1. **Identify Calvin's Points**: 
   Calvin scored 500 points.

2. **Calculate Paislee's Points**: 
   According to the problem, Paislee scored \( \frac{3}{4} \) times as many points as Calvin. We can express this mathematically as:
   \[
   \text{Paislee's Points} = \frac{3}{4} \times \text{Calvin's Points}
   \]
   Substituting in Calvin's points:
   \[
   \text{Paislee's Points} = \frac{3}{4} \times 500
   \]

3. **Perform the Calculation**:
   To calculate \( \frac{3}{4} \times 500 \):
   \[
   \frac{3}{4} \times 500 = \frac{3 \times 500}{4} = \frac{1500}{4} = 375
   \]

4. **Conclusion**:
   Paislee scored 375 points. 

5. **Determine Points Needed to Tie**:
   To tie the game with Calvin, Paislee would need to score the same amount of points as Calvin, which is 500 points.

Thus, the final answer is that Paislee needed to achieve **500 points** to have a chance of tying the game.
