To solve the problem, we need to determine how many birds are attracted to Lillian's garden based on the bird feeders she has built and bought.

1. **Identify the number of feeders**:
   - Lillian builds 3 bird feeders.
   - Lillian buys 3 bird feeders.
   - Total number of bird feeders = 3 (built) + 3 (bought) = 6 feeders.

2. **Determine the number of birds attracted to each type of feeder**:
   - Each store-bought feeder attracts 20 birds.
   - Each feeder that Lillian built attracts 10 more birds than the store-bought ones. Therefore, each built feeder attracts:
     \[
     20 \text{ (birds from store-bought)} + 10 \text{ (additional birds)} = 30 \text{ birds}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total number of birds attracted to all feeders**:
   - For the 3 store-bought feeders:
     \[
     3 \text{ (store-bought feeders)} \times 20 \text{ (birds per feeder)} = 60 \text{ birds}
     \]
   - For the 3 built feeders:
     \[
     3 \text{ (built feeders)} \times 30 \text{ (birds per feeder)} = 90 \text{ birds}
     \]

4. **Add the total number of birds attracted to both types of feeders**:
   \[
   60 \text{ (birds from store-bought)} + 90 \text{ (birds from built)} = 150 \text{ birds}
   \]

Thus, the total number of birds Lillian can expect to see in her garden each day is:

\[
\boxed{150}
\]
