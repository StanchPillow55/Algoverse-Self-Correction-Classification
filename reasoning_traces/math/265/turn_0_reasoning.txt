To determine how much more the total price of the house is than Mrs. Cruz's budget, we need to calculate the total cost of the house, including the selling price, brokerage fee, and transfer fee. Then we will compare this total cost to her budget of $400,000.

### Step 1: Calculate the Brokerage Fee
The brokerage fee is 5% of the selling price. The selling price of the house is $350,000.

\[
\text{Brokerage Fee} = 5\% \times \text{Selling Price} = 0.05 \times 350,000
\]

Calculating the brokerage fee:

\[
\text{Brokerage Fee} = 0.05 \times 350,000 = 17,500
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the Transfer Fee
The transfer fee is 12% of the selling price.

\[
\text{Transfer Fee} = 12\% \times \text{Selling Price} = 0.12 \times 350,000
\]

Calculating the transfer fee:

\[
\text{Transfer Fee} = 0.12 \times 350,000 = 42,000
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the Total Cost of the House
Now we will add the selling price, brokerage fee, and transfer fee to find the total cost.

\[
\text{Total Cost} = \text{Selling Price} + \text{Brokerage Fee} + \text{Transfer Fee}
\]

Substituting the values we calculated:

\[
\text{Total Cost} = 350,000 + 17,500 + 42,000
\]

Calculating the total cost:

\[
\text{Total Cost} = 350,000 + 17,500 = 367,500
\]
\[
\text{Total Cost} = 367,500 + 42,000 = 409,500
\]

### Step 4: Compare Total Cost to Budget
Now we will compare the total cost of the house to Mrs. Cruz's budget of $400,000.

\[
\text{Difference} = \text{Total Cost} - \text{Budget}
\]
\[
\text{Difference} = 409,500 - 400,000
\]

Calculating the difference:

\[
\text{Difference} = 9,500
\]

### Final Answer
The total price of the house is $9,500 more than Mrs. Cruz's budget.

\[
\boxed{9500}
\]
