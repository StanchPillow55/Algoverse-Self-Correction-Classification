==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to determine how high Larry can reach and then add that to how high Barry can reach when he stands on Larry's shoulders.

1. **Determine Larry's shoulder height:**
   - Larry's full height is 5 feet.
   - His shoulder height is 20% less than his full height.
   - First, we calculate 20% of Larry's height:
     \[
     20\% \text{ of } 5 \text{ feet} = 0.20 \times 5 = 1 \text{ foot}
     \]
   - Now, we subtract this value from Larry's full height to find his shoulder height:
     \[
     \text{Shoulder height} = 5 \text{ feet} - 1 \text{ foot} = 4 \text{ feet}
     \]

2. **Determine how high Barry can reach when standing on Larry's shoulders:**
   - Barry can reach apples that are 5 feet high.
   - When Barry stands on Larry's shoulders, we need to add Larry's shoulder height to Barry's reach.
   - Since we found that Larry's shoulder height is 4 feet, we can calculate the total height they can reach together:
     \[
     \text{Total height} = \text{Larry's shoulder height} + \text{Barry's reach}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total height} = 4 \text{ feet} + 5 \text{ feet} = 9 \text{ feet}
     \]

3. **Final answer:**
   - Therefore, when Barry stands on Larry's shoulders, they can reach a total height of **9 feet**.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{9 \text{ feet}}
\]
