==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine how high Barry can reach when he stands on Larry's shoulders. We'll break down the problem step by step.

### Step 1: Determine Larry's shoulder height

Larry's full height is 5 feet. According to the problem, Larry's shoulder height is 20% less than his full height. We need to calculate what 20% of Larry's height is and then subtract that from his full height to find his shoulder height.

1. Calculate 20% of Larry's full height:
   \[
   20\% \text{ of } 5 \text{ feet} = 0.20 \times 5 = 1 \text{ foot}
   \]

2. Subtract this value from Larry's full height to get his shoulder height:
   \[
   \text{Larry's shoulder height} = 5 \text{ feet} - 1 \text{ foot} = 4 \text{ feet}
   \]

### Step 2: Determine the total height Barry can reach

Barry can reach apples that are 5 feet high when standing on the ground. When Barry stands on Larry's shoulders, we need to add Larry's shoulder height to the height Barry can reach from the ground.

1. Add Larry's shoulder height to the height Barry can reach:
   \[
   \text{Total height Barry can reach} = \text{Larry's shoulder height} + \text{Barry's reach from the ground}
   \]
   \[
   = 4 \text{ feet} + 5 \text{ feet} = 9 \text{ feet}
   \]

### Conclusion

When Barry stands on Larry's shoulders, they can reach a height of 9 feet. Therefore, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{9 \text{ feet}}
\]
