==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to set up equations based on the relationships given in the problem statement.

1. **Define Variables**:
   - Let \( q \) be the number of queen bees.
   - Let \( b \) be the number of baby bees.
   - Let \( w \) be the number of worker bees.

2. **Set Up Relationships**:
   - According to the problem, there are twice as many worker bees as baby bees:
     \[
     w = 2b
     \]
   - There are also twice as many baby bees as queens:
     \[
     b = 2q
     \]

3. **Total Bees**:
   - The total number of bees in the hive is given as 700:
     \[
     w + b + q = 700
     \]

4. **Substituting Relationships**:
   - We can substitute the expressions for \( w \) and \( b \) in terms of \( q \) into the total bees equation.
   - First, substitute \( b = 2q \) into \( w = 2b \):
     \[
     w = 2(2q) = 4q
     \]
   - Now we have:
     \[
     w = 4q, \quad b = 2q
     \]
   - Substitute these into the total bees equation:
     \[
     4q + 2q + q = 700
     \]

5. **Combine Like Terms**:
   - Combine the terms on the left side:
     \[
     4q + 2q + q = 7q
     \]
   - Thus, we have:
     \[
     7q = 700
     \]

6. **Solve for \( q \)**:
   - Divide both sides by 7:
     \[
     q = \frac{700}{7} = 100
     \]

7. **Find \( b \) and \( w \)**:
   - Now that we have \( q \), we can find \( b \):
     \[
     b = 2q = 2 \times 100 = 200
     \]
   - Next, find \( w \):
     \[
     w = 4q = 4 \times 100 = 400
     \]

8. **Final Answer**:
   - The number of worker bees is:
     \[
     \boxed{400}
     \]

Thus, there are 400 worker bees in the hive.
