To determine how many minutes Larry spends on his dog each day, we need to calculate the total time he spends walking and playing with his dog, as well as the time he spends feeding his dog.

1. **Walking and Playing with the Dog:**
   - Larry spends half an hour twice a day.
   - First, we calculate the total time spent walking and playing in hours:
     \[
     \text{Total time walking and playing} = 0.5 \text{ hours} \times 2 = 1 \text{ hour}
     \]

2. **Feeding the Dog:**
   - Larry spends a fifth of an hour every day feeding his dog.
   - We convert a fifth of an hour into hours:
     \[
     \text{Time feeding} = \frac{1}{5} \text{ hour}
     \]

3. **Total Time in Hours:**
   - Now, we add the total time spent walking and playing with the dog to the time spent feeding the dog:
     \[
     \text{Total time} = 1 \text{ hour} + \frac{1}{5} \text{ hour}
     \]
   - To add these, we need a common denominator. The common denominator for 1 (which is 1/1) and 1/5 is 5:
     \[
     1 \text{ hour} = \frac{5}{5} \text{ hour}
     \]
   - Now we can add:
     \[
     \text{Total time} = \frac{5}{5} \text{ hour} + \frac{1}{5} \text{ hour} = \frac{6}{5} \text{ hour}
     \]

4. **Convert Total Time to Minutes:**
   - Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we convert \(\frac{6}{5}\) hours into minutes:
     \[
     \text{Total time in minutes} = \frac{6}{5} \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour}
     \]
   - Performing the multiplication:
     \[
     \text{Total time in minutes} = \frac{6 \times 60}{5} = \frac{360}{5} = 72 \text{ minutes}
     \]

Therefore, the total time Larry spends on his dog each day is \( \boxed{72} \) minutes.
