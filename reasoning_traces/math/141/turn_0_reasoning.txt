==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total time Larry spends on his dog each day, considering both the time spent walking and playing with the dog and the time spent feeding the dog.

### Step 1: Calculate the time spent walking and playing with the dog

Larry spends half an hour twice a day walking and playing with his dog. We need to calculate the total time spent on these activities in a day.

- Half an hour is equivalent to 30 minutes.
- Since Larry does this twice a day, we multiply the time for one session by 2:

\[
30 \text{ minutes/session} \times 2 \text{ sessions/day} = 60 \text{ minutes/day}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the time spent feeding the dog

Larry spends a fifth of an hour every day feeding his dog. We need to convert this time into minutes.

- One hour is 60 minutes.
- A fifth of an hour is calculated as:

\[
\frac{1}{5} \text{ hour} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 12 \text{ minutes}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the total time spent on the dog each day

Now, we add the time spent on both activities to find the total time Larry spends on his dog each day:

\[
60 \text{ minutes (walking and playing)} + 12 \text{ minutes (feeding)} = 72 \text{ minutes}
\]

Therefore, Larry spends a total of 72 minutes on his dog each day.

### Final Answer

Larry spends 72 minutes on his dog each day.
