==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the number of riders who can stay upright on the wave:**
   Tiffany observes that only 25% of the riders can stay upright when a wave over 30 feet arrives. 

   Given that there are 100 riders, we can calculate the number of riders who can stay upright as follows:

   \[
   \text{Number of riders who stay upright} = 25\% \text{ of } 100 = 0.25 \times 100 = 25
   \]

2. **Determine the number of women who can stay upright:**
   Of the riders who can stay upright, 60% are women. We can calculate the number of women who stay upright:

   \[
   \text{Number of women who stay upright} = 60\% \text{ of } 25 = 0.60 \times 25 = 15
   \]

3. **Determine the number of men who can stay upright:**
   To find the number of men who can stay upright, we subtract the number of women who stay upright from the total number of riders who stay upright:

   \[
   \text{Number of men who stay upright} = \text{Total riders who stay upright} - \text{Number of women who stay upright}
   \]

   Substituting the values we calculated:

   \[
   \text{Number of men who stay upright} = 25 - 15 = 10
   \]

Thus, the final answer is that **10 men can stay upright on the wave**.
