Question ID: superglue_475
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 475" refers to. However, since the problem statement doesn't provide any specific details or context about "Sample reasoning question 475," we need to consider a general approach to reasoning through a math problem.

Let's assume "Sample reasoning question 475" is a placeholder for a typical math problem. Here's a step-by-step approach to solving a generic math problem:

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - Read the problem carefully.
   - Identify what is being asked.
   - Determine what information is given.

2. **Devise a Plan:**
   - Think about the strategies that can be used to solve the problem. This could include algebraic manipulation, drawing a diagram, or breaking the problem into smaller parts.

3. **Carry Out the Plan:**
   - Execute the chosen strategy step by step.
   - Perform calculations carefully.
   - Keep track of units and ensure consistency.

4. **Review/Check the Solution:**
   - Verify that the solution makes sense in the context of the problem.
   - Check calculations for accuracy.
   - Ensure that the solution answers the question asked.

Since we don't have specific details for "Sample reasoning question 475," let's create a hypothetical math problem and solve it using the steps above.

**Hypothetical Problem:**
"Find the value of \( x \) if \( 2x + 3 = 11 \)."

**Step 1: Understand the Problem**
- We need to solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).

**Step 2: Devise a Plan**
- We can isolate \( x \) by performing algebraic operations.

**Step 3: Carry Out the Plan**
- Start with the equation: \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).
- Subtract 3 from both sides to isolate the term with \( x \):
  \[
  2x + 3 - 3 = 11 - 3
  \]
  \[
  2x = 8
  \]
- Divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( x \):
  \[
  \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{8}{2}
  \]
  \[
  x = 4
  \]

**Step 4: Review/Check the Solution**
- Substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation to verify:
  \[
  2(4) + 3 = 8 + 3 = 11
  \]
- The left side equals the right side, confirming that our solution is correct.

**Final Answer:**
The value of \( x \) is 4.

This approach demonstrates a structured way to solve a math problem, even though the original "Sample reasoning question 475" was not specified.
