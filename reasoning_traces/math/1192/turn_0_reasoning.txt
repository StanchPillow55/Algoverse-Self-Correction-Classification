To find out how much Jen will receive for the month of April, we need to calculate her total earnings based on her hourly rate, the number of hours she works, the number of days she works, and the additional attendance bonus.

### Step 1: Calculate the total hours worked in April

Jen works 7.5 hours a day for 6 days a week. 

First, we calculate the total hours she works in one week:
\[
\text{Hours per week} = \text{Hours per day} \times \text{Days per week} = 7.5 \, \text{hours/day} \times 6 \, \text{days/week} = 45 \, \text{hours/week}
\]

Since there are 4 weeks in April, we can calculate the total hours worked in April:
\[
\text{Total hours in April} = \text{Hours per week} \times \text{Number of weeks} = 45 \, \text{hours/week} \times 4 \, \text{weeks} = 180 \, \text{hours}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the total earnings from hourly wages

Jen's hourly rate is $1.5. To find her total earnings from her hourly wage, we multiply her total hours worked by her hourly rate:
\[
\text{Total earnings from hourly wage} = \text{Total hours in April} \times \text{Hourly rate} = 180 \, \text{hours} \times 1.5 \, \text{dollars/hour} = 270 \, \text{dollars}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the attendance bonus

Since Jen had complete attendance for the month of April, she receives an additional $10:
\[
\text{Attendance bonus} = 10 \, \text{dollars}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the total earnings for April

Now, we add her total earnings from her hourly wage and the attendance bonus to find her total earnings for April:
\[
\text{Total earnings for April} = \text{Total earnings from hourly wage} + \text{Attendance bonus} = 270 \, \text{dollars} + 10 \, \text{dollars} = 280 \, \text{dollars}
\]

### Final Answer

Thus, Jen will receive a total of **$280** for the month of April.
