Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we first need to understand what "Sample reasoning question 206" refers to. Since the problem statement does not provide specific details about the question, I'll demonstrate a general approach to solving a typical math problem by breaking it down into steps. Let's assume a hypothetical math problem and solve it step-by-step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**
Calculate the sum of the first 10 positive integers.

**Step 1: Understand the Problem**
We need to find the sum of the first 10 positive integers. These integers are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10.

**Step 2: Choose a Strategy**
One efficient way to calculate the sum of a sequence of consecutive integers is to use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series. The formula for the sum \( S \) of the first \( n \) positive integers is:
\[ S = \frac{n(n + 1)}{2} \]

**Step 3: Apply the Formula**
Here, \( n = 10 \). Plugging this value into the formula gives:
\[ S = \frac{10(10 + 1)}{2} \]

**Step 4: Perform the Calculation**
Calculate the expression inside the parentheses first:
\[ 10 + 1 = 11 \]

Now multiply 10 by 11:
\[ 10 \times 11 = 110 \]

Finally, divide by 2 to find the sum:
\[ S = \frac{110}{2} = 55 \]

**Step 5: Verify the Solution**
To ensure the calculation is correct, we can add the numbers directly:
\[ 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 10 \]

Grouping the numbers in pairs from the ends:
\[ (1 + 10) + (2 + 9) + (3 + 8) + (4 + 7) + (5 + 6) \]

Each pair sums to 11, and there are 5 pairs:
\[ 5 \times 11 = 55 \]

Both methods give the same result, confirming the calculation is correct.

**Final Answer:**
The sum of the first 10 positive integers is 55.
