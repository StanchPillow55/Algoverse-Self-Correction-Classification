==================================================

To solve the problem effectively, let's first clarify what "Sample reasoning question 206" might entail. Since the problem statement is not specific, I'll assume it's a generic math problem that requires logical reasoning and problem-solving skills. I'll create a hypothetical problem and solve it step-by-step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**

A farmer has a rectangular field that is 100 meters long and 60 meters wide. He wants to divide the field into two equal areas by constructing a fence parallel to one of the sides. Calculate the length of the fence required and explain your reasoning.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - The field is rectangular with dimensions 100 meters (length) and 60 meters (width).
   - The farmer wants to divide the field into two equal areas using a fence parallel to one of the sides.

2. **Calculate the Total Area of the Field:**
   - The area of a rectangle is given by the formula: Area = Length Ã— Width.
   - Therefore, the total area of the field is: 
     \[
     100 \, \text{meters} \times 60 \, \text{meters} = 6000 \, \text{square meters}
     \]

3. **Determine the Area of Each Section:**
   - Since the field is to be divided into two equal areas, each section will have an area of:
     \[
     \frac{6000 \, \text{square meters}}{2} = 3000 \, \text{square meters}
     \]

4. **Decide on the Orientation of the Fence:**
   - The fence can be parallel to either the length (100 meters) or the width (60 meters).

5. **Case 1: Fence Parallel to the Length (100 meters):**
   - If the fence is parallel to the length, it will divide the width into two equal parts.
   - Let the width of each section be \( x \).
   - The area of each section is given by: \( 100 \times x = 3000 \).
   - Solving for \( x \):
     \[
     100x = 3000 \implies x = \frac{3000}{100} = 30 \, \text{meters}
     \]
   - Therefore, the fence will be 60 meters long (the width of the field).

6. **Case 2: Fence Parallel to the Width (60 meters):**
   - If the fence is parallel to the width, it will divide the length into two equal parts.
   - Let the length of each section be \( y \).
   - The area of each section is given by: \( 60 \times y = 3000 \).
   - Solving for \( y \):
     \[
     60y = 3000 \implies y = \frac{3000}{60} = 50 \, \text{meters}
     \]
   - Therefore, the fence will be 100 meters long (the length of the field).

7. **Conclusion:**
   - The farmer can choose to place the fence either parallel to the length or the width.
   - If the fence is parallel to the length, it will be 60 meters long.
   - If the fence is parallel to the width, it will be 100 meters long.

**Final Answer:**
The length of the fence required is either 60 meters or 100 meters, depending on whether it is parallel to the length or the width of the field, respectively.
