==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 206" refers to. Since this is not a standard math problem or a known question, I'll need to make some assumptions or create a hypothetical problem to demonstrate how to solve it.

Let's assume "Sample reasoning question 206" is a math problem involving basic arithmetic or algebra. I'll create a sample problem and solve it step by step.

**Sample Problem:**
Solve for \( x \) in the equation: \( 3x + 5 = 20 \).

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Equation:**
   The equation given is \( 3x + 5 = 20 \). This is a linear equation in one variable, \( x \).

2. **Isolate the Variable:**
   To solve for \( x \), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We can do this by performing inverse operations.

3. **Subtract 5 from Both Sides:**
   \[
   3x + 5 - 5 = 20 - 5
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   3x = 15
   \]

4. **Divide Both Sides by 3:**
   \[
   \frac{3x}{3} = \frac{15}{3}
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   x = 5
   \]

5. **Verify the Solution:**
   Substitute \( x = 5 \) back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies the equation:
   \[
   3(5) + 5 = 20
   \]
   \[
   15 + 5 = 20
   \]
   \[
   20 = 20
   \]
   Since both sides of the equation are equal, our solution is verified.

**Final Answer:**
The solution to the equation \( 3x + 5 = 20 \) is \( x = 5 \).

This is a complete solution to a hypothetical problem based on the prompt "Sample reasoning question 206." If you have a specific problem or context in mind, please provide more details so I can assist you accordingly.
