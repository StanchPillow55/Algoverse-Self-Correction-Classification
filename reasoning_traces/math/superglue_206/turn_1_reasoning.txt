==================================================

To solve the problem effectively, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 206" entails. However, since the problem statement is not provided, I'll demonstrate a general approach to solving a typical math reasoning problem. 

Let's assume "Sample reasoning question 206" is a math problem involving algebraic reasoning. Here's a step-by-step approach to solving a hypothetical algebra problem:

**Problem:**
Solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 3x + 5 = 20 \).

**Step 1: Understand the Problem**
The goal is to find the value of \( x \) that makes the equation true. The equation given is linear, which means it will have one solution.

**Step 2: Isolate the Variable**
To solve for \( x \), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We start by eliminating the constant term on the left side.

- Subtract 5 from both sides of the equation:
  \[
  3x + 5 - 5 = 20 - 5
  \]
  Simplifying both sides gives:
  \[
  3x = 15
  \]

**Step 3: Solve for \( x \)**
Now, divide both sides by 3 to solve for \( x \).

- Divide both sides by 3:
  \[
  \frac{3x}{3} = \frac{15}{3}
  \]
  Simplifying both sides gives:
  \[
  x = 5
  \]

**Step 4: Verify the Solution**
Substitute \( x = 5 \) back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies the equation.

- Substitute \( x = 5 \) into \( 3x + 5 = 20 \):
  \[
  3(5) + 5 = 20
  \]
  Simplifying the left side gives:
  \[
  15 + 5 = 20
  \]
  \[
  20 = 20
  \]
The left side equals the right side, confirming that \( x = 5 \) is indeed the correct solution.

**Final Answer:**
The solution to the equation \( 3x + 5 = 20 \) is \( x = 5 \).

This approach can be adapted to solve various types of algebraic reasoning problems by following similar steps: understanding the problem, isolating the variable, solving for the variable, and verifying the solution. If "Sample reasoning question 206" involves a different type of problem, please provide more details for a specific solution.
