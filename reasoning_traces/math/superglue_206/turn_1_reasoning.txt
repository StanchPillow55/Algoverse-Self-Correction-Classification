==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 206" refers to. Since the problem statement doesn't provide specific details about the question, I'll demonstrate a general approach to solving a reasoning problem, using a hypothetical example.

Let's assume "Sample reasoning question 206" is a logic puzzle. Here's a step-by-step approach to solving a typical logic puzzle:

### Hypothetical Problem:
Three friends, Alice, Bob, and Charlie, are wearing different colored hats: red, blue, and green. We need to determine who is wearing which color hat based on the following clues:
1. Alice is not wearing the red hat.
2. Bob is wearing the blue hat.
3. Charlie is not wearing the green hat.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Identify the Variables:**
   - Alice's hat color: A
   - Bob's hat color: B
   - Charlie's hat color: C

2. **List Possible Options:**
   - Possible colors are red (R), blue (B), and green (G).

3. **Apply the Clues:**
   - From clue 2, we know Bob is wearing the blue hat. So, B = Blue.
   - From clue 1, Alice is not wearing the red hat. So, A ≠ Red.
   - From clue 3, Charlie is not wearing the green hat. So, C ≠ Green.

4. **Eliminate Possibilities:**
   - Since Bob is wearing the blue hat, neither Alice nor Charlie can be wearing blue. Thus, A ≠ Blue and C ≠ Blue.
   - Alice cannot wear red or blue, so Alice must be wearing green. Therefore, A = Green.
   - Charlie cannot wear green or blue, so Charlie must be wearing red. Therefore, C = Red.

5. **Verify the Solution:**
   - Alice is wearing the green hat, which satisfies clue 1 (A ≠ Red).
   - Bob is wearing the blue hat, which satisfies clue 2 (B = Blue).
   - Charlie is wearing the red hat, which satisfies clue 3 (C ≠ Green).

6. **Conclusion:**
   - Alice is wearing the green hat.
   - Bob is wearing the blue hat.
   - Charlie is wearing the red hat.

### Final Answer:
- Alice: Green
- Bob: Blue
- Charlie: Red

This hypothetical example demonstrates the logical reasoning process to solve a reasoning question. If "Sample reasoning question 206" refers to a different type of problem, please provide additional details for a more specific solution.
