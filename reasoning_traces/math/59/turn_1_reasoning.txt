Question ID: 59
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to add up all the coins Joanne collected and then subtract the coins she gave to her coworker.

In the first hour, Joanne collected 15 coins.

In the next two hours, she collected 35 coins.

So far, she has collected a total of 15 coins + 35 coins = 50 coins.

In the fourth hour, she collected another 50 coins, bringing her total to 50 coins + 50 coins = 100 coins.

However, she gave 15 coins to her coworker, so we need to subtract these from her total. 

So, 100 coins - 15 coins = 85 coins.

Therefore, after the fourth hour, Joanne had 85 coins.
