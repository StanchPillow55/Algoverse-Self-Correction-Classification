==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of coins Joanne has after the fourth hour, considering the coins she collected each hour and the coins she gave away.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **First Hour:**
   - Joanne collected 15 coins.

2. **Second and Third Hours:**
   - During these two hours, Joanne collected a total of 35 coins. 
   - Since the problem states "for the next two hours," we assume this total is for both the second and third hours combined.

3. **Fourth Hour:**
   - Joanne collected 50 coins.
   - However, she gave 15 coins to her coworker.

Now, let's calculate the total number of coins Joanne has after the fourth hour:

- **Coins collected in the first hour:** 15 coins
- **Coins collected in the second and third hours:** 35 coins
- **Coins collected in the fourth hour:** 50 coins
- **Coins given away in the fourth hour:** 15 coins

To find the total number of coins Joanne has after the fourth hour, we add up all the coins she collected and then subtract the coins she gave away:

\[
\text{Total coins} = (\text{Coins from first hour}) + (\text{Coins from second and third hours}) + (\text{Coins from fourth hour}) - (\text{Coins given away})
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\text{Total coins} = 15 + 35 + 50 - 15
\]

Now, perform the calculations:

1. Add the coins collected in the first hour and the second and third hours:
   \[
   15 + 35 = 50
   \]

2. Add the coins collected in the fourth hour:
   \[
   50 + 50 = 100
   \]

3. Subtract the coins given away:
   \[
   100 - 15 = 85
   \]

Therefore, after the fourth hour, Joanne has a total of 85 coins.

**Final Answer: 85 coins**
