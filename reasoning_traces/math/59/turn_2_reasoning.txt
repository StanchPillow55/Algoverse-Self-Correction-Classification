Question ID: 59
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

Joanne's coin collection can be calculated as follows:

In the first hour, Joanne collected 15 coins.

In the next two hours, she collected 35 coins. 

So, after the first three hours, Joanne had 15 coins (from the first hour) + 35 coins (from the next two hours) = 50 coins.

In the fourth hour, she collected 50 coins. But she gave 15 coins to her coworker. 

So, in the fourth hour, she had 50 coins (collected) - 15 coins (given to coworker) = 35 coins.

Therefore, after the fourth hour, Joanne had 50 coins (from the first three hours) + 35 coins (from the fourth hour) = 85 coins.

So, Joanne had 85 coins after the fourth hour.
