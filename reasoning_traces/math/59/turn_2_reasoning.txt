Question ID: 59
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of coins Joanne has after the fourth hour, taking into account the coins she collected each hour and the coins she gave away.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **First Hour:**
   - Joanne collected 15 coins.
   - Total coins after the first hour = 15 coins.

2. **Second and Third Hours:**
   - During the next two hours (second and third hours), Joanne collected 35 coins.
   - Total coins collected in the second and third hours = 35 coins.
   - Total coins after the third hour = 15 coins (from the first hour) + 35 coins (from the second and third hours) = 50 coins.

3. **Fourth Hour:**
   - Joanne collected 50 coins in the fourth hour.
   - However, she gave 15 of these coins to her coworker.
   - Coins remaining from the fourth hour = 50 coins - 15 coins = 35 coins.

4. **Total Coins After the Fourth Hour:**
   - To find the total number of coins Joanne has after the fourth hour, we add the coins she had after the third hour to the coins remaining from the fourth hour.
   - Total coins after the fourth hour = 50 coins (after the third hour) + 35 coins (remaining from the fourth hour) = 85 coins.

Therefore, after the fourth hour, Joanne has a total of 85 coins.

**Final Answer: 85 coins**
