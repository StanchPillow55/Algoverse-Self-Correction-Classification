Question ID: 59
Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

Let's break down the problem step by step.

In the first hour, Joanne collected 15 coins.

In the next two hours, she collected 35 coins. 

So, after the first three hours, she had 15 coins (from the first hour) + 35 coins (from the next two hours) = 50 coins.

In the fourth hour, she collected 50 coins. So, before giving any coins to her coworker, she had 50 coins (from the first three hours) + 50 coins (from the fourth hour) = 100 coins.

But then she gave 15 coins to her coworker. So, after giving away these coins, she had 100 coins - 15 coins = 85 coins.

So, after the fourth hour, Joanne had 85 coins. 

Final Answer: Joanne had 85 coins after the fourth hour.
