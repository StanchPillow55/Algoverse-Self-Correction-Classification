==================================================

To find the total number of raspberries on the bush, we need to calculate the total number of fruit in the clusters and then add the number of individual fruit.

1. **Calculate the total number of fruit in the clusters:**
   - There are 6 clusters, and each cluster has 20 fruit.
   - To find the total number of fruit in the clusters, we multiply the number of clusters by the number of fruit per cluster:
     \[
     \text{Total fruit in clusters} = \text{Number of clusters} \times \text{Fruit per cluster} = 6 \times 20
     \]
   - Performing the multiplication:
     \[
     6 \times 20 = 120
     \]
   - So, there are 120 fruit in the clusters.

2. **Add the number of individual fruit:**
   - We know there are 67 individual fruit scattered across the bush.
   - To find the total number of raspberries, we add the total number of fruit in the clusters to the number of individual fruit:
     \[
     \text{Total raspberries} = \text{Total fruit in clusters} + \text{Individual fruit} = 120 + 67
     \]
   - Performing the addition:
     \[
     120 + 67 = 187
     \]

3. **Final answer:**
   - Therefore, the total number of raspberries on the bush is:
     \[
     \boxed{187}
     \]
