To find out how many coins Joanne had after the fourth hour, we will break down the problem step by step, calculating the total coins collected each hour and accounting for the coins given away.

1. **First Hour:**
   - Coins collected: 15
   - Total coins after the first hour: 
     \[
     15
     \]

2. **Second Hour:**
   - Coins collected: 35
   - Total coins after the second hour:
     \[
     15 + 35 = 50
     \]

3. **Third Hour:**
   - Coins collected: 35 (same as the second hour)
   - Total coins after the third hour:
     \[
     50 + 35 = 85
     \]

4. **Fourth Hour:**
   - Coins collected: 50
   - Total coins before giving any away:
     \[
     85 + 50 = 135
     \]
   - Coins given to coworker: 15
   - Total coins after giving away:
     \[
     135 - 15 = 120
     \]

Now, let's summarize the calculations:

- After the first hour: 15 coins
- After the second hour: 50 coins
- After the third hour: 85 coins
- After the fourth hour (after giving away 15 coins): 120 coins

Thus, the total number of coins Joanne had after the fourth hour is:

\[
\boxed{120}
\]
