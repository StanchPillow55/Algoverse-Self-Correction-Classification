==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 257," we need to first understand what the problem is asking. However, the problem statement "Sample math problem 257" is not specific enough for us to determine what the actual mathematical question is. It seems like a placeholder or a reference to a specific problem that is not provided here.

To proceed, let's assume this is a hypothetical math problem and create a sample problem with the number 257 involved. We will then solve this hypothetical problem step by step.

### Hypothetical Problem:
"Find the sum of the digits of the number 257."

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Identify the Digits of the Number:**
   - The number 257 consists of three digits: 2, 5, and 7.

2. **Add the Digits Together:**
   - To find the sum of the digits, we add them together:
   \[
   2 + 5 + 7
   \]

3. **Perform the Addition:**
   - First, add the first two digits:
   \[
   2 + 5 = 7
   \]
   - Next, add the result to the third digit:
   \[
   7 + 7 = 14
   \]

4. **State the Final Answer:**
   - The sum of the digits of the number 257 is 14.

### Conclusion:
The final answer to the hypothetical problem is 14.
