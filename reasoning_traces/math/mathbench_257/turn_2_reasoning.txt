==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 257," we first need to understand what the problem is asking. However, the problem statement is not provided here. Since "Sample math problem 257" is not a standard math problem, I will assume it is a placeholder for an actual math problem. 

Let's create a hypothetical math problem and solve it step by step:

**Hypothetical Problem:**
Calculate the sum of all even numbers between 1 and 257.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Identify the Range of Even Numbers:**
   - The even numbers between 1 and 257 start from 2 and go up to 256.

2. **Determine the Sequence of Even Numbers:**
   - The sequence of even numbers is an arithmetic sequence where the first term \( a_1 = 2 \) and the common difference \( d = 2 \).

3. **Find the Last Term of the Sequence:**
   - The last term \( a_n = 256 \).

4. **Find the Number of Terms in the Sequence:**
   - The formula for the \( n \)-th term of an arithmetic sequence is:
     \[
     a_n = a_1 + (n-1) \cdot d
     \]
   - Plug in the known values:
     \[
     256 = 2 + (n-1) \cdot 2
     \]
   - Simplify and solve for \( n \):
     \[
     256 = 2 + 2n - 2
     \]
     \[
     256 = 2n
     \]
     \[
     n = \frac{256}{2} = 128
     \]

5. **Calculate the Sum of the Sequence:**
   - The sum \( S_n \) of the first \( n \) terms of an arithmetic sequence is given by:
     \[
     S_n = \frac{n}{2} \cdot (a_1 + a_n)
     \]
   - Substitute the known values:
     \[
     S_{128} = \frac{128}{2} \cdot (2 + 256)
     \]
     \[
     S_{128} = 64 \cdot 258
     \]

6. **Perform the Multiplication:**
   - Calculate \( 64 \times 258 \):
     \[
     64 \times 258 = 64 \times (250 + 8) = 64 \times 250 + 64 \times 8
     \]
     \[
     64 \times 250 = 16000
     \]
     \[
     64 \times 8 = 512
     \]
     \[
     64 \times 258 = 16000 + 512 = 16512
     \]

**Final Answer:**
The sum of all even numbers between 1 and 257 is \( \boxed{16512} \).
