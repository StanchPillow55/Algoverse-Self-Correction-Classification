==================================================

To solve the math problem labeled as "Sample math problem 257," we need to first understand what the problem is asking. However, since the problem statement is not provided, I will assume a generic approach to solving a math problem and demonstrate a step-by-step process.

Let's assume "Sample math problem 257" is a typical algebra problem. For illustration purposes, let's say the problem is:

"Find the value of \( x \) in the equation \( 3x + 5 = 20 \)."

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We are given an equation \( 3x + 5 = 20 \).
   - Our goal is to solve for \( x \).

2. **Isolate the Variable:**
   - To find \( x \), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation.
   - Start by eliminating the constant term on the left side. We do this by subtracting 5 from both sides of the equation.

   \[
   3x + 5 - 5 = 20 - 5
   \]

   Simplifying both sides gives:

   \[
   3x = 15
   \]

3. **Solve for \( x \):**
   - Now, we need to isolate \( x \) by dividing both sides of the equation by 3.

   \[
   \frac{3x}{3} = \frac{15}{3}
   \]

   Simplifying both sides gives:

   \[
   x = 5
   \]

4. **Verify the Solution:**
   - Substitute \( x = 5 \) back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies the equation.

   \[
   3(5) + 5 = 20
   \]

   Simplifying the left side gives:

   \[
   15 + 5 = 20
   \]

   \[
   20 = 20
   \]

   Since both sides of the equation are equal, our solution is verified.

5. **State the Final Answer:**
   - The value of \( x \) is \( 5 \).

### Conclusion:

By following these steps, we have solved the equation \( 3x + 5 = 20 \) and found that \( x = 5 \). This process demonstrates a systematic approach to solving linear equations, which can be applied to similar problems. If "Sample math problem 257" is different, please provide the specific problem statement for a tailored solution.
