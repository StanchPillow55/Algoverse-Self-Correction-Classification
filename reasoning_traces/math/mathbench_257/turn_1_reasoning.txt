==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 257," we first need to understand what the problem is asking. However, the problem statement "Sample math problem 257" is not specific enough to determine what the actual mathematical question is. 

In order to proceed, let's assume that "Sample math problem 257" refers to a typical math problem that might involve basic arithmetic, algebra, geometry, or another area of mathematics. Since no specific details are provided, I'll create a hypothetical math problem and solve it step by step.

### Hypothetical Math Problem:
Let's assume "Sample math problem 257" is the following algebra problem:

**Problem:** Solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 3x + 5 = 20 \).

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Understand the Equation:**
   The equation given is \( 3x + 5 = 20 \). Our goal is to solve for \( x \).

2. **Isolate the Variable:**
   To solve for \( x \), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We start by eliminating the constant term on the left side of the equation.

   \[
   3x + 5 = 20
   \]

   Subtract 5 from both sides to remove the constant term:

   \[
   3x + 5 - 5 = 20 - 5
   \]

   Simplifying both sides gives:

   \[
   3x = 15
   \]

3. **Solve for \( x \):**
   Now, we need to solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides of the equation by the coefficient of \( x \), which is 3.

   \[
   \frac{3x}{3} = \frac{15}{3}
   \]

   Simplifying both sides gives:

   \[
   x = 5
   \]

4. **Verify the Solution:**
   To ensure our solution is correct, we substitute \( x = 5 \) back into the original equation to check if both sides are equal.

   Original equation: \( 3x + 5 = 20 \)

   Substitute \( x = 5 \):

   \[
   3(5) + 5 = 20
   \]

   Simplify the left side:

   \[
   15 + 5 = 20
   \]

   \[
   20 = 20
   \]

   Since both sides of the equation are equal, our solution \( x = 5 \) is correct.

### Final Answer:
The solution to the equation \( 3x + 5 = 20 \) is \( x = 5 \).
