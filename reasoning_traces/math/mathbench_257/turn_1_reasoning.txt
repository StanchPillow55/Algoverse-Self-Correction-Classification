==================================================

To solve the problem, we first need to understand what "Sample math problem 257" refers to. Since the problem is not explicitly stated, I'll assume that "257" is the number we need to work with, and I'll create a math problem around it. Let's consider a problem involving basic arithmetic operations with the number 257.

**Problem:**  
Calculate the sum of the digits of the number 257, then multiply the result by 3. Finally, subtract 5 from the product.

**Step-by-step Solution:**

1. **Identify the digits of the number 257.**  
   The number 257 consists of the digits 2, 5, and 7.

2. **Calculate the sum of the digits.**  
   Sum = 2 + 5 + 7

   \[
   2 + 5 = 7
   \]

   \[
   7 + 7 = 14
   \]

   So, the sum of the digits is 14.

3. **Multiply the sum by 3.**  
   Product = 14 Ã— 3

   \[
   14 \times 3 = 42
   \]

   So, the product is 42.

4. **Subtract 5 from the product.**  
   Result = 42 - 5

   \[
   42 - 5 = 37
   \]

   So, the result after subtracting 5 is 37.

**Final Answer:**  
The final result of the operations on the number 257 is 37.
