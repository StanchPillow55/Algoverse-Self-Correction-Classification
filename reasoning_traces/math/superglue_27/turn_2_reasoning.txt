Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 27" refers to. Since the problem statement is not provided, I'll assume it involves a typical math problem-solving scenario. Let's consider a hypothetical math problem and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**
Calculate the area of a triangle with a base of 10 units and a height of 5 units.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We need to find the area of a triangle.
   - The formula for the area of a triangle is: 
     \[
     \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height}
     \]

2. **Identify Given Values:**
   - Base (\(b\)) = 10 units
   - Height (\(h\)) = 5 units

3. **Substitute Values into the Formula:**
   - Plug the given values into the area formula:
     \[
     \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times 10 \times 5
     \]

4. **Perform the Calculation:**
   - First, calculate the product of the base and the height:
     \[
     10 \times 5 = 50
     \]
   - Then, multiply by \(\frac{1}{2}\):
     \[
     \frac{1}{2} \times 50 = 25
     \]

5. **State the Final Answer:**
   - The area of the triangle is 25 square units.

**Conclusion:**
By following these steps, we have calculated the area of the triangle to be 25 square units. This process involved understanding the problem, identifying the given values, substituting them into the appropriate formula, performing the calculation, and stating the final answer.
