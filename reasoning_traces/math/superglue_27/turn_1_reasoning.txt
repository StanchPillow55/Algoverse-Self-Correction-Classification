==================================================

To solve this problem, I'll need more context or details about "Sample reasoning question 27" as it seems to refer to a specific question from a set or document that I don't have access to. However, I can guide you through a general approach to solving math problems by using a hypothetical example.

Let's assume "Sample reasoning question 27" is a typical math problem. I'll create a sample problem and solve it step by step.

### Sample Problem:
**Question:** A car travels 150 miles in 3 hours. What is the average speed of the car in miles per hour?

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We need to find the average speed of the car.
   - The formula for average speed is given by:
     \[
     \text{Average Speed} = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Total Time}}
     \]

2. **Identify the Given Information:**
   - Total Distance = 150 miles
   - Total Time = 3 hours

3. **Apply the Formula:**
   - Substitute the given values into the formula:
     \[
     \text{Average Speed} = \frac{150 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ hours}}
     \]

4. **Perform the Calculation:**
   - Divide 150 by 3:
     \[
     \text{Average Speed} = 50 \text{ miles per hour}
     \]

5. **Verify the Solution:**
   - Check if the units are correct: We have miles per hour, which is appropriate for speed.
   - Ensure the calculation is logical: Traveling 150 miles in 3 hours at 50 miles per hour makes sense.

6. **State the Final Answer:**
   - The average speed of the car is 50 miles per hour.

This is a complete solution to a hypothetical problem. If you have the specific details of "Sample reasoning question 27," please provide them, and I can solve that particular problem for you.
