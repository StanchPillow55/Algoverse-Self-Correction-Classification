Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine how many of Mr. Sanchez's students received a final grade of B or above. We know that 40% of the students received a grade below B. Therefore, the remaining percentage of students received a grade of B or above.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Determine the percentage of students who got a grade of B or above:**

   Since 40% of the students got a grade below B, the percentage of students who got a grade of B or above is the complement of 40% in 100%. This can be calculated as:

   \[
   100\% - 40\% = 60\%
   \]

   So, 60% of the students received a grade of B or above.

2. **Calculate the number of students who got a grade of B or above:**

   Mr. Sanchez has a total of 60 students. To find out how many students got a grade of B or above, we need to calculate 60% of 60 students.

   First, convert the percentage to a decimal by dividing by 100:

   \[
   60\% = \frac{60}{100} = 0.6
   \]

   Next, multiply the total number of students by this decimal:

   \[
   0.6 \times 60 = 36
   \]

   Therefore, 36 students received a grade of B or above.

3. **Final Answer:**

   The number of students who got a final grade of B and above is 36.

Thus, the final answer is 36 students.
