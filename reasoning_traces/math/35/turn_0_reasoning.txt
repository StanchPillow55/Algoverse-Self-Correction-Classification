Question ID: 35
Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

If 40% of Mr. Sanchez's students got a final grade below B, then it means that 60% of his students got a final grade of B and above. This is because the total percentage of students is 100%, so if you subtract the percentage that got below B (40%), you get the percentage that got B and above (60%).

To find out how many students got a final grade of B and above, you need to find 60% of the total number of students. 

The total number of students is 60. 

To find 60% of 60, you multiply 60 by 0.60 (which is the decimal equivalent of 60%).

60 * 0.60 = 36

So, 36 of Mr. Sanchez's students got a final grade of B and above.
