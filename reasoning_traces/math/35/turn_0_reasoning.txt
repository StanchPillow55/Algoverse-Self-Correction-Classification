==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to determine how many of Mr. Sanchez's Grade 5 students received a final grade of B or above, given that 40% of his students received a grade below B.

1. **Identify the total number of students**: 
   Mr. Sanchez has a total of 60 students in Grade 5.

2. **Calculate the number of students who got a grade below B**: 
   We know that 40% of the students received a grade below B. To find the number of students who fall into this category, we can calculate 40% of 60.

   \[
   \text{Number of students below B} = 40\% \times 60
   \]

   To convert the percentage to a decimal, we divide by 100:

   \[
   40\% = \frac{40}{100} = 0.40
   \]

   Now, we can calculate:

   \[
   \text{Number of students below B} = 0.40 \times 60 = 24
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of students who got a grade of B and above**: 
   To find the number of students who received a grade of B or above, we subtract the number of students who received a grade below B from the total number of students.

   \[
   \text{Number of students with B and above} = \text{Total students} - \text{Number of students below B}
   \]

   Substituting the values we have:

   \[
   \text{Number of students with B and above} = 60 - 24 = 36
   \]

4. **Final answer**: 
   Therefore, the number of Mr. Sanchez's Grade 5 students who got a final grade of B and above is 

   \[
   \boxed{36}
   \]
