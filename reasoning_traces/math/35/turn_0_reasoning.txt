To solve the problem, we need to determine how many points Mike scores in total during his 40 minutes of playing ping pong.

1. **Points scored in the first 20 minutes**: 
   - According to the problem, Mike scores 4 points in the first 20 minutes.

2. **Points scored in the second 20 minutes**:
   - In the second 20 minutes, he scores 25% more points than he did in the first 20 minutes.
   - To find out how many points he scores in the second 20 minutes, we first need to calculate 25% of the points he scored in the first 20 minutes.

   \[
   25\% \text{ of } 4 = 0.25 \times 4 = 1
   \]

   - Now, we add this increase to the original 4 points to find the total points scored in the second 20 minutes.

   \[
   \text{Points in second 20 minutes} = 4 + 1 = 5
   \]

3. **Total points scored**:
   - Now, we add the points scored in both time periods to find the total points.

   \[
   \text{Total points} = \text{Points in first 20 minutes} + \text{Points in second 20 minutes}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total points} = 4 + 5 = 9
   \]

Thus, the total number of points Mike scored during the 40 minutes of playing ping pong is **9**.

Final answer: **9 points**.
