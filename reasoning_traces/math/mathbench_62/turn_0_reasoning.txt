==================================================

It seems like there might be a misunderstanding or missing information in your request. "Sample math problem 62" doesn't provide enough detail for me to solve a specific problem. However, I can guide you through a generic math problem-solving process or help with a specific type of math problem if you provide more details.

For now, let's consider a generic math problem and solve it step by step:

**Problem: Solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).**

**Step 1: Understand the problem.**

We need to find the value of \( x \) that makes the equation true.

**Step 2: Isolate the variable.**

The equation is \( 2x + 3 = 11 \). To solve for \( x \), we need to isolate \( x \) on one side of the equation.

**Step 3: Eliminate the constant term on the side with the variable.**

Subtract 3 from both sides of the equation to eliminate the constant term on the left side:

\[ 2x + 3 - 3 = 11 - 3 \]

This simplifies to:

\[ 2x = 8 \]

**Step 4: Solve for the variable.**

Now, divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( x \):

\[ \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{8}{2} \]

This simplifies to:

\[ x = 4 \]

**Step 5: Verify the solution.**

Substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies the equation:

\[ 2(4) + 3 = 11 \]

\[ 8 + 3 = 11 \]

\[ 11 = 11 \]

The left side equals the right side, so \( x = 4 \) is indeed the correct solution.

**Final Answer:**

The solution to the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \) is \( x = 4 \).

If you have a specific problem or a different type of math question, please provide more details, and I'll be happy to help!
