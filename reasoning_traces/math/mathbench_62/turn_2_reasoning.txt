==================================================

To solve the problem, I need more information about "Sample math problem 62." Since the problem is not provided, I'll demonstrate how to approach a generic math problem by solving an example problem. Let's consider a typical algebra problem:

**Example Problem:**
Solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 3x + 5 = 20 \).

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   We need to find the value of \( x \) that makes the equation true.

2. **Isolate the Variable:**
   To solve for \( x \), we need to get \( x \) by itself on one side of the equation. The equation is currently:
   \[
   3x + 5 = 20
   \]

3. **Subtract 5 from Both Sides:**
   To eliminate the 5 from the left side, subtract 5 from both sides of the equation:
   \[
   3x + 5 - 5 = 20 - 5
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   3x = 15
   \]

4. **Divide Both Sides by 3:**
   To solve for \( x \), divide both sides by 3:
   \[
   \frac{3x}{3} = \frac{15}{3}
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   x = 5
   \]

5. **Verify the Solution:**
   Substitute \( x = 5 \) back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies the equation:
   \[
   3(5) + 5 = 20
   \]
   Simplifying the left side:
   \[
   15 + 5 = 20
   \]
   \[
   20 = 20
   \]
   The left side equals the right side, confirming that \( x = 5 \) is the correct solution.

**Final Answer:**
The solution to the equation \( 3x + 5 = 20 \) is \( x = 5 \).
