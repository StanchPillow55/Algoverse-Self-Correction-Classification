Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To determine how many movies Colby can see on the last day of the month, we need to calculate his total spending for the month and how much money he has left.

1. **Monthly Allowance**: Colby receives $150 each month.

2. **Expenses for Movies Already Seen**:
   - **Friday/Saturday Movies**: Colby saw 5 movies on Fridays or Saturdays. Each ticket costs $10.
     \[
     \text{Cost for Friday/Saturday movies} = 5 \text{ movies} \times 10 \text{ dollars/movie} = 50 \text{ dollars}
     \]

   - **Other Day Movies**: Colby saw 8 movies on other days. Each ticket costs $7.
     \[
     \text{Cost for other day movies} = 8 \text{ movies} \times 7 \text{ dollars/movie} = 56 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Expenses for Snacks**:
   - Colby had 2 tubs of popcorn, each costing $8.
     \[
     \text{Cost for popcorn} = 2 \text{ tubs} \times 8 \text{ dollars/tub} = 16 \text{ dollars}
     \]

   - Colby had 4 boxes of candy, each costing $2.
     \[
     \text{Cost for candy} = 4 \text{ boxes} \times 2 \text{ dollars/box} = 8 \text{ dollars}
     \]

4. **Total Expenses**:
   Now, we add all the expenses together:
   \[
   \text{Total expenses} = \text{Cost for Friday/Saturday movies} + \text{Cost for other day movies} + \text{Cost for popcorn} + \text{Cost for candy}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total expenses} = 50 + 56 + 16 + 8 = 130 \text{ dollars}
   \]

5. **Remaining Money**:
   To find out how much money Colby has left, we subtract his total expenses from his monthly allowance:
   \[
   \text{Remaining money} = 150 \text{ dollars} - 130 \text{ dollars} = 20 \text{ dollars}
   \]

6. **Cost of Snacks for the Last Movie**:
   Colby wants to buy a popcorn and a box of candy for the last movie. The cost for these is:
   \[
   \text{Cost for popcorn and candy} = 8 \text{ dollars} + 2 \text{ dollars} = 10 \text{ dollars}
   \]

7. **Money Left After Snacks**:
   After buying the popcorn and candy, we calculate how much money Colby has left:
   \[
   \text{Money left after snacks} = 20 \text{ dollars} - 10 \text{ dollars} = 10 \text{ dollars}
   \]

8. **Cost of the Last Movie**:
   Since it is a Friday, the cost of the movie ticket is $10. We check if he can afford it:
   \[
   \text{Cost of last movie} = 10 \text{ dollars}
   \]

9. **Final Calculation**:
   Colby has $10 left, which is exactly enough to buy one more movie ticket for $10.

Thus, Colby can see **1 more movie** on the last day of the month.

**Final Answer**: 1 movie.
