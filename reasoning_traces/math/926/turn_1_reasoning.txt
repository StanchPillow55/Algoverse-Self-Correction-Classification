Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to calculate how much money Colby has spent this month and how much he has left to spend on movies, popcorn, and candy.

1. **Initial Budget**: Colby has $150 to spend for the month.

2. **Expenses Calculation**:
   - **Movies on Fridays and Saturdays**: Colby saw 5 movies on Fridays or Saturdays. Each ticket costs $10.
     \[
     \text{Cost for Friday/Saturday movies} = 5 \text{ movies} \times 10 \text{ dollars/movie} = 50 \text{ dollars}
     \]

   - **Movies on Other Days**: Colby saw 8 movies on other days. Each ticket costs $7.
     \[
     \text{Cost for other day movies} = 8 \text{ movies} \times 7 \text{ dollars/movie} = 56 \text{ dollars}
     \]

   - **Popcorn**: Colby had 2 tubs of popcorn, each costing $8.
     \[
     \text{Cost for popcorn} = 2 \text{ tubs} \times 8 \text{ dollars/tub} = 16 \text{ dollars}
     \]

   - **Candy**: Colby had 4 boxes of candy, each costing $2.
     \[
     \text{Cost for candy} = 4 \text{ boxes} \times 2 \text{ dollars/box} = 8 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Total Expenses**:
   Now, we sum all the expenses:
   \[
   \text{Total expenses} = 50 \text{ (movies on Fri/Sat)} + 56 \text{ (movies on other days)} + 16 \text{ (popcorn)} + 8 \text{ (candy)} = 130 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Remaining Budget**:
   We subtract the total expenses from the initial budget to find out how much money Colby has left:
   \[
   \text{Remaining budget} = 150 \text{ dollars} - 130 \text{ dollars} = 20 \text{ dollars}
   \]

5. **Cost of Additional Items**:
   Colby wants to buy a popcorn and a box of candy tonight. The costs are:
   - Popcorn: $8
   - Candy: $2
   \[
   \text{Total cost for popcorn and candy} = 8 \text{ dollars} + 2 \text{ dollars} = 10 \text{ dollars}
   \]

6. **Remaining Budget After Popcorn and Candy**:
   We subtract the cost of popcorn and candy from the remaining budget:
   \[
   \text{Remaining budget after popcorn and candy} = 20 \text{ dollars} - 10 \text{ dollars} = 10 \text{ dollars}
   \]

7. **Movies Colby Can See**:
   With the remaining $10, Colby can buy tickets for movies. Since today is Friday, each ticket costs $10. Therefore, he can see:
   \[
   \text{Number of movies} = \frac{10 \text{ dollars}}{10 \text{ dollars/movie}} = 1 \text{ movie}
   \]

**Final Answer**: Colby can see **1 movie** tonight.
