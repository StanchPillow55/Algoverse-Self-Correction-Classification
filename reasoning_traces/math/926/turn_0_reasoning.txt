To solve the problem, we need to determine how much money Colby has spent this month and how much he has left to spend on additional movies, popcorn, and candy on the last day of the month, which is a Friday.

1. **Initial Budget**: Colby starts with $150 for the month.

2. **Expenses Calculation**:
   - **Movies on Fridays and Saturdays**: 
     - Colby saw 5 movies on Fridays or Saturdays. Each ticket costs $10.
     - Total cost for these movies: 
       \[
       5 \text{ movies} \times 10 \text{ dollars/movie} = 50 \text{ dollars}
       \]

   - **Movies on Other Days**: 
     - Colby saw 8 movies on other days. Each ticket costs $7.
     - Total cost for these movies: 
       \[
       8 \text{ movies} \times 7 \text{ dollars/movie} = 56 \text{ dollars}
       \]

   - **Popcorn**: 
     - Colby had 2 tubs of popcorn. Each tub costs $8.
     - Total cost for popcorn: 
       \[
       2 \text{ tubs} \times 8 \text{ dollars/tub} = 16 \text{ dollars}
       \]

   - **Candy**: 
     - Colby had 4 boxes of candy. Each box costs $2.
     - Total cost for candy: 
       \[
       4 \text{ boxes} \times 2 \text{ dollars/box} = 8 \text{ dollars}
       \]

3. **Total Expenses**:
   Now, we sum all the expenses:
   \[
   \text{Total expenses} = \text{Cost of Friday/Saturday movies} + \text{Cost of other movies} + \text{Cost of popcorn} + \text{Cost of candy}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total expenses} = 50 + 56 + 16 + 8 = 130 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Remaining Budget**:
   To find out how much money Colby has left, we subtract his total expenses from his initial budget:
   \[
   \text{Remaining budget} = 150 \text{ dollars} - 130 \text{ dollars} = 20 \text{ dollars}
   \]

5. **Spending on the Last Day**:
   On the last day, which is a Friday, Colby wants to buy a popcorn and a box of candy. The costs are:
   - Popcorn: $8
   - Candy: $2
   - Total cost for popcorn and candy:
   \[
   8 + 2 = 10 \text{ dollars}
   \]

6. **Remaining Budget After Popcorn and Candy**:
   After buying the popcorn and candy, we calculate the remaining budget:
   \[
   \text{Remaining budget after popcorn and candy} = 20 \text{ dollars} - 10 \text{ dollars} = 10 \text{ dollars}
   \]

7. **Movies Colby Can See**:
   With the remaining $10, Colby can buy tickets for movies. Since it is a Friday, each ticket costs $10. Therefore, he can buy:
   \[
   \text{Number of movies} = \frac{10 \text{ dollars}}{10 \text{ dollars/movie}} = 1 \text{ movie}
   \]

**Final Answer**:
Colby can see **1 movie** on the last day of the month.
