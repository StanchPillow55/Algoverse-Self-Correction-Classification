To determine how much longer it takes to ride the biggest waterslide compared to the second biggest waterslide, we need to calculate the time it takes to slide down each slide and then find the difference between these two times.

### Step 1: Calculate the time for the biggest waterslide

The formula to calculate time is:

\[
\text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}}
\]

For the biggest waterslide:
- Distance = 300 feet
- Speed = 60 feet/minute

Using the formula:

\[
\text{Time}_{\text{biggest}} = \frac{300 \text{ feet}}{60 \text{ feet/minute}} = 5 \text{ minutes}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the time for the second biggest waterslide

For the second biggest waterslide:
- Distance = 240 feet
- Speed = 80 feet/minute

Using the formula:

\[
\text{Time}_{\text{second biggest}} = \frac{240 \text{ feet}}{80 \text{ feet/minute}} = 3 \text{ minutes}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the difference in time

Now we need to find out how much longer it takes to ride the biggest slide compared to the second biggest slide:

\[
\text{Difference in time} = \text{Time}_{\text{biggest}} - \text{Time}_{\text{second biggest}} = 5 \text{ minutes} - 3 \text{ minutes} = 2 \text{ minutes}
\]

### Final Answer

It takes **2 minutes longer** to ride the biggest waterslide compared to the second biggest waterslide.
