==================================================

To address the problem "Sample reasoning question 478," we need to first understand what the question is asking. However, the problem statement is incomplete and lacks specific details or numbers to work with. Therefore, I will create a hypothetical math problem related to the number 478 and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**
Let's assume the problem is as follows: "Find the sum of the digits of the number 478, and then determine if this sum is a prime number."

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Identify the Digits of the Number:**
   - The number given is 478.
   - The digits in 478 are 4, 7, and 8.

2. **Calculate the Sum of the Digits:**
   - Sum = 4 + 7 + 8

3. **Perform the Addition:**
   - First, add 4 and 7:
     \[
     4 + 7 = 11
     \]
   - Next, add the result to 8:
     \[
     11 + 8 = 19
     \]

4. **Determine if the Sum is a Prime Number:**
   - A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.
   - Check if 19 is a prime number:
     - The divisors of 19 are 1 and 19.
     - 19 is not divisible by any other numbers (2, 3, 4, ..., 18).
     - Therefore, 19 is a prime number.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The sum of the digits of 478 is 19.
   - 19 is a prime number.

**Final Answer:**
The sum of the digits of 478 is 19, and 19 is a prime number.
