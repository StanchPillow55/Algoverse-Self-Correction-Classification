==================================================

To solve the problem, we will calculate the points collected by each student step by step and then determine how many points the class is missing to reach the minimum threshold of 400 points.

1. **Calculate Betty's points:**
   - Adam has collected 50 points.
   - Betty collected 30% more points than Adam.
   - To find 30% of Adam's points:
     \[
     30\% \text{ of } 50 = 0.30 \times 50 = 15
     \]
   - Therefore, Betty's total points are:
     \[
     \text{Betty's points} = \text{Adam's points} + 30\% \text{ of Adam's points} = 50 + 15 = 65
     \]

2. **Calculate Tom's points:**
   - It is given that Tom has 30 points less than Betty.
   - Therefore, Tom's points are:
     \[
     \text{Tom's points} = \text{Betty's points} - 30 = 65 - 30 = 35
     \]

3. **Calculate Marta's points:**
   - Marta collected 3 times more points than Tom.
   - Therefore, Marta's points are:
     \[
     \text{Marta's points} = 3 \times \text{Tom's points} = 3 \times 35 = 105
     \]

4. **Calculate the total points collected by the class:**
   - Now we can sum the points collected by all four students:
     \[
     \text{Total points} = \text{Adam's points} + \text{Betty's points} + \text{Tom's points} + \text{Marta's points}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total points} = 50 + 65 + 35 + 105 = 255
     \]

5. **Determine how many points the class is missing to reach the threshold:**
   - The minimum threshold for the trip is 400 points.
   - To find out how many points are missing:
     \[
     \text{Points missing} = \text{Minimum threshold} - \text{Total points} = 400 - 255 = 145
     \]

Thus, the class is missing **145 points** to reach the minimum threshold for the trip.

Final answer: **145 points**.
