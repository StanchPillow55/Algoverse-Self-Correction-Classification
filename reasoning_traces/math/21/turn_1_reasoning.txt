==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine how many beetles are eaten each day based on the given food chain: jaguars eat snakes, snakes eat birds, and birds eat beetles. We will work through each step of the food chain to find the total number of beetles consumed per day.

### Step 1: Determine the Number of Snakes Eaten by Jaguars

Each jaguar eats 5 snakes per day. If there are 6 jaguars in the forest, the total number of snakes eaten by all jaguars per day is calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Total snakes eaten by jaguars per day} = 6 \text{ jaguars} \times 5 \text{ snakes/jaguar} = 30 \text{ snakes}
\]

### Step 2: Determine the Number of Birds Eaten by Snakes

Each snake eats 3 birds per day. Since 30 snakes are eaten by jaguars each day, these 30 snakes must have eaten a certain number of birds before being eaten themselves. The total number of birds eaten by these 30 snakes per day is:

\[
\text{Total birds eaten by snakes per day} = 30 \text{ snakes} \times 3 \text{ birds/snake} = 90 \text{ birds}
\]

### Step 3: Determine the Number of Beetles Eaten by Birds

Each bird eats 12 beetles per day. Therefore, the total number of beetles eaten by the 90 birds per day is:

\[
\text{Total beetles eaten by birds per day} = 90 \text{ birds} \times 12 \text{ beetles/bird} = 1080 \text{ beetles}
\]

### Conclusion

By following the food chain from jaguars to snakes to birds to beetles, we have determined that a total of 1080 beetles are eaten each day in the forest.

Thus, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{1080}
\]
