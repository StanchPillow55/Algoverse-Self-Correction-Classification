==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to determine how many beetles are eaten each day based on the number of jaguars in the forest and the eating habits of each animal.

1. **Identify the relationships between the animals:**
   - Each jaguar eats 5 snakes per day.
   - Each snake eats 3 birds per day.
   - Each bird eats 12 beetles per day.

2. **Calculate the number of snakes eaten by the jaguars:**
   - There are 6 jaguars.
   - Each jaguar eats 5 snakes per day.
   - Therefore, the total number of snakes eaten by the jaguars is:
     \[
     \text{Total snakes eaten} = 6 \text{ jaguars} \times 5 \text{ snakes/jaguar} = 30 \text{ snakes}
     \]

3. **Calculate the number of birds eaten by the snakes:**
   - Each snake eats 3 birds per day.
   - Therefore, the total number of birds eaten by the snakes is:
     \[
     \text{Total birds eaten} = 30 \text{ snakes} \times 3 \text{ birds/snake} = 90 \text{ birds}
     \]

4. **Calculate the number of beetles eaten by the birds:**
   - Each bird eats 12 beetles per day.
   - Therefore, the total number of beetles eaten by the birds is:
     \[
     \text{Total beetles eaten} = 90 \text{ birds} \times 12 \text{ beetles/bird} = 1080 \text{ beetles}
     \]

5. **Final answer:**
   - The total number of beetles eaten each day is:
     \[
     \boxed{1080}
     \]
