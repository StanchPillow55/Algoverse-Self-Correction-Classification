Let's solve this problem step by step.

Step 1: Find out how many snakes are eaten by jaguars each day.
Each jaguar eats 5 snakes per day. So, if there are 6 jaguars, they will eat 6 * 5 = 30 snakes per day.

Step 2: Find out how many birds are eaten by snakes each day.
Each snake eats 3 birds per day. So, if 30 snakes are eaten by jaguars, then these snakes would have eaten 30 * 3 = 90 birds per day.

Step 3: Find out how many beetles are eaten by birds each day.
Each bird eats 12 beetles per day. So, if 90 birds are eaten by snakes, then these birds would have eaten 90 * 12 = 1080 beetles per day.

So, the total number of beetles eaten each day is 1080.
