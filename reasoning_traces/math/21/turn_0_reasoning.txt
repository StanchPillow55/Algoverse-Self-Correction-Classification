==================================================

To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step.

1. **Determine Samantha's Age**: 
   We know from the problem that Samantha is currently 31 years old.

2. **Calculate Raymond's Age**: 
   Since Raymond was born 6 years before Samantha, we can find Raymond's age by adding 6 years to Samantha's age:
   \[
   \text{Raymond's age} = \text{Samantha's age} + 6 = 31 + 6 = 37 \text{ years old}
   \]

3. **Determine the Age at Which Raymond Had a Son**: 
   The problem states that Raymond had a son when he was 23 years old.

4. **Calculate the Age of Raymond's Son Now**: 
   To find out how old Raymond's son is now, we need to determine how many years have passed since Raymond was 23. Since Raymond is currently 37 years old, we can calculate the number of years since he was 23:
   \[
   \text{Years since Raymond was 23} = \text{Raymond's current age} - \text{Age when he had a son} = 37 - 23 = 14 \text{ years}
   \]
   This means that Raymond's son is currently 14 years old.

5. **Determine How Many Years Ago Raymond's Son Was Born**: 
   Since Raymond's son is currently 14 years old, we can conclude that he was born 14 years ago.

Thus, the final answer to the question "how many years ago was Raymond's son born?" is:

\[
\boxed{14}
\]
