==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample reasoning question 477," we need to first understand what the question is asking. However, the question as presented is not clear or complete. It seems to be a placeholder or a reference to a specific problem that is not provided here. 

To proceed, let's assume that "Sample reasoning question 477" refers to a typical math problem that involves reasoning. Since we don't have the exact details of the problem, I'll demonstrate how to approach a generic math reasoning problem step by step.

### Step-by-Step Approach to a Generic Math Reasoning Problem

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - Read the problem carefully.
   - Identify what is being asked.
   - Determine what information is given and what needs to be found.

2. **Devise a Plan:**
   - Consider possible strategies to solve the problem, such as drawing a diagram, creating an equation, or breaking the problem into smaller parts.

3. **Carry Out the Plan:**
   - Execute the chosen strategy step by step.
   - Perform calculations carefully and check each step for accuracy.

4. **Review/Check the Solution:**
   - Verify that the solution answers the question.
   - Check the calculations and logic used in the solution.
   - Consider whether there is another way to solve the problem that might be simpler or more elegant.

### Example Problem and Solution

Since we don't have the actual problem, let's solve a sample reasoning problem:

**Problem:**
A train travels from City A to City B at a speed of 60 km/h and returns from City B to City A at a speed of 40 km/h. What is the average speed of the train for the entire journey?

**Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We need to find the average speed for the entire journey.
   - The train travels two legs: City A to City B and City B to City A.

2. **Devise a Plan:**
   - Use the formula for average speed: 
     \[
     \text{Average speed} = \frac{\text{Total distance}}{\text{Total time}}
     \]
   - Let the distance between City A and City B be \(d\).

3. **Carry Out the Plan:**
   - Calculate the time taken for each leg of the journey:
     - Time from City A to City B: \(\frac{d}{60}\) hours
     - Time from City B to City A: \(\frac{d}{40}\) hours
   - Total distance for the round trip: \(2d\)
   - Total time for the round trip: 
     \[
     \frac{d}{60} + \frac{d}{40} = \frac{2d}{120} + \frac{3d}{120} = \frac{5d}{120} = \frac{d}{24}
     \]
   - Average speed:
     \[
     \text{Average speed} = \frac{2d}{\frac{d}{24}} = 2d \times \frac{24}{d} = 48 \text{ km/h}
     \]

4. **Review/Check the Solution:**
   - The calculations are correct, and the logic is sound.
   - The average speed for the entire journey is 48 km/h.

**Final Answer:**
The average speed of the train for the entire journey is 48 km/h.
