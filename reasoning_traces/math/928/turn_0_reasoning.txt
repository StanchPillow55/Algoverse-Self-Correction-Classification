To find the average number of Junebugs that Rita removes per day, we first need to calculate the total number of Junebugs she removed over the week and then divide that by the number of days.

1. **Calculate the number of Junebugs removed each day:**
   - **Monday:** Rita removed 39 Junebugs.
   - **Tuesday:** She removed twice as many as Monday, so:
     \[
     \text{Tuesday} = 2 \times 39 = 78 \text{ Junebugs}
     \]
   - **Wednesday:** Again, she removed twice as many as Monday, so:
     \[
     \text{Wednesday} = 2 \times 39 = 78 \text{ Junebugs}
     \]
   - **Thursday:** She removed 48 Junebugs.
   - **Friday:** She removed 57 Junebugs.

2. **Sum the total number of Junebugs removed:**
   Now we add up the number of Junebugs removed each day:
   \[
   \text{Total} = 39 + 78 + 78 + 48 + 57
   \]

   Let's calculate this step by step:
   - First, add Monday and Tuesday:
     \[
     39 + 78 = 117
     \]
   - Next, add Wednesday:
     \[
     117 + 78 = 195
     \]
   - Then, add Thursday:
     \[
     195 + 48 = 243
     \]
   - Finally, add Friday:
     \[
     243 + 57 = 300
     \]

   So, the total number of Junebugs removed over the week is 300.

3. **Calculate the average number of Junebugs removed per day:**
   There are 5 days in the week (Monday to Friday). To find the average, we divide the total number of Junebugs by the number of days:
   \[
   \text{Average} = \frac{\text{Total}}{\text{Number of Days}} = \frac{300}{5} = 60
   \]

Thus, the average number of Junebugs that Rita removes per day is \(\boxed{60}\).
