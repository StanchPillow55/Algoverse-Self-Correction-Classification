==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 236," we need to first understand what the problem is asking. However, since "Sample math problem 236" is not a specific problem statement, I will create a hypothetical math problem and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem 236:**

A rectangle has a length that is 4 units longer than its width. If the perimeter of the rectangle is 36 units, find the dimensions of the rectangle.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We have a rectangle with a length (L) and a width (W).
   - The length is 4 units longer than the width: \( L = W + 4 \).
   - The perimeter of the rectangle is 36 units.

2. **Recall the Formula for Perimeter:**
   - The perimeter (P) of a rectangle is given by the formula:
     \[
     P = 2L + 2W
     \]

3. **Set Up the Equation:**
   - Substitute the given perimeter into the formula:
     \[
     2L + 2W = 36
     \]
   - Substitute \( L = W + 4 \) into the equation:
     \[
     2(W + 4) + 2W = 36
     \]

4. **Simplify and Solve for W:**
   - Distribute the 2 in the equation:
     \[
     2W + 8 + 2W = 36
     \]
   - Combine like terms:
     \[
     4W + 8 = 36
     \]
   - Subtract 8 from both sides:
     \[
     4W = 28
     \]
   - Divide both sides by 4:
     \[
     W = 7
     \]

5. **Find the Length:**
   - Use the relationship \( L = W + 4 \):
     \[
     L = 7 + 4 = 11
     \]

6. **Verify the Solution:**
   - Check the perimeter with the found dimensions:
     \[
     2L + 2W = 2(11) + 2(7) = 22 + 14 = 36
     \]
   - The calculated perimeter matches the given perimeter, confirming the solution is correct.

**Final Answer:**
The dimensions of the rectangle are a width of 7 units and a length of 11 units.
