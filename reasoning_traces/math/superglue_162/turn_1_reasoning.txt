==================================================

To solve the problem, I need more specific information about "Sample reasoning question 162." Since the question is not provided, I'll demonstrate how to approach a typical math reasoning problem step by step. If you have a specific question in mind, please provide the details.

Let's consider a sample math reasoning problem:

**Problem:**
A farmer has a rectangular field that is 100 meters long and 60 meters wide. He wants to divide the field into smaller rectangular sections, each with an area of 150 square meters. How many such sections can he create?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We have a rectangular field with dimensions 100 meters (length) and 60 meters (width).
   - We need to divide this field into smaller rectangles, each with an area of 150 square meters.

2. **Calculate the Total Area of the Field:**
   - The area of a rectangle is given by the formula: Area = Length × Width.
   - For the field: Area = 100 meters × 60 meters = 6000 square meters.

3. **Determine the Number of Smaller Sections:**
   - Each smaller section has an area of 150 square meters.
   - To find out how many such sections can fit into the total area, divide the total area by the area of one section.
   - Number of sections = Total Area / Area of one section = 6000 square meters / 150 square meters.

4. **Perform the Division:**
   - 6000 ÷ 150 = 40.

5. **Verify the Calculation:**
   - Multiply the number of sections by the area of one section to ensure it equals the total area.
   - 40 sections × 150 square meters/section = 6000 square meters, which matches the total area of the field.

6. **Conclusion:**
   - The farmer can divide the field into 40 smaller rectangular sections, each with an area of 150 square meters.

**Final Answer:**
The farmer can create 40 sections, each with an area of 150 square meters.
