==================================================

To solve the problem, I need more specific information about "Sample reasoning question 162." Since this is a generic reference, I don't have the exact details of the problem. However, I can guide you through a general approach to solving reasoning problems, especially if they involve mathematical reasoning or logic.

### General Approach to Solving a Reasoning Problem:

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - Carefully read the problem statement.
   - Identify what is being asked.
   - Note any given information or constraints.

2. **Organize the Information:**
   - Write down all the known values and conditions.
   - Create diagrams or tables if necessary to visualize the problem.

3. **Develop a Strategy:**
   - Determine which mathematical concepts or reasoning strategies apply.
   - Consider breaking the problem into smaller, more manageable parts.

4. **Execute the Plan:**
   - Perform calculations step by step.
   - Keep track of units and ensure consistency.
   - Use logical reasoning to connect different pieces of information.

5. **Check Your Work:**
   - Verify each step for accuracy.
   - Ensure that the solution satisfies all the conditions of the problem.
   - Consider alternative methods to confirm the result.

6. **State the Final Answer:**
   - Clearly present the solution.
   - Include units or labels as appropriate.

### Example Problem:

Let's consider a hypothetical reasoning problem:

**Problem:**
A farmer has 100 meters of fencing and wants to enclose a rectangular area. What dimensions should the rectangle have to maximize the enclosed area?

**Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We need to maximize the area of a rectangle with a fixed perimeter of 100 meters.

2. **Organize the Information:**
   - Let the length of the rectangle be \( l \) meters and the width be \( w \) meters.
   - The perimeter is given by \( 2l + 2w = 100 \).

3. **Develop a Strategy:**
   - Express one variable in terms of the other using the perimeter equation.
   - Use the area formula \( A = l \times w \) and substitute the expression from the perimeter equation.

4. **Execute the Plan:**
   - From the perimeter equation: \( 2l + 2w = 100 \) implies \( l + w = 50 \).
   - Solve for \( w \): \( w = 50 - l \).
   - Substitute into the area formula: \( A = l \times (50 - l) = 50l - l^2 \).
   - This is a quadratic equation in the form \( A = -l^2 + 50l \).

5. **Maximize the Area:**
   - The quadratic equation \( A = -l^2 + 50l \) is a downward-opening parabola.
   - The maximum area occurs at the vertex of the parabola.
   - The vertex \( l \) is given by \( l = -\frac{b}{2a} \) where \( a = -1 \) and \( b = 50 \).
   - \( l = -\frac{50}{2 \times -1} = 25 \).

6. **Find the Corresponding Width:**
   - \( w = 50 - l = 50 - 25 = 25 \).

7. **State the Final Answer:**
   - The dimensions that maximize the area are \( 25 \) meters by \( 25 \) meters.
   - The maximum enclosed area is \( 25 \times 25 = 625 \) square meters.

This is a typical approach to solving a reasoning problem involving optimization and geometry. If you have a specific problem in mind, please provide the details, and I can offer a more tailored solution.
