==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 483" entails. Since the problem statement is not specific, I'll assume it's a hypothetical question that requires logical reasoning and mathematical calculations. Let's create a sample problem and solve it step by step.

**Sample Problem:**

A company produces two types of products: Product A and Product B. The company has a total production capacity of 100 units per day. The profit from Product A is $20 per unit, and the profit from Product B is $30 per unit. The company wants to maximize its profit while producing at least 20 units of Product A and at least 10 units of Product B per day. How many units of each product should the company produce to maximize profit?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( x \) be the number of units of Product A produced per day.
   - Let \( y \) be the number of units of Product B produced per day.

2. **Set Up the Objective Function:**
   - The objective is to maximize the profit \( P \).
   - Profit from Product A = \( 20x \).
   - Profit from Product B = \( 30y \).
   - Total profit \( P = 20x + 30y \).

3. **Set Up the Constraints:**
   - Total production capacity: \( x + y \leq 100 \).
   - Minimum production of Product A: \( x \geq 20 \).
   - Minimum production of Product B: \( y \geq 10 \).

4. **Graph the Constraints:**
   - The feasible region is determined by the intersection of the constraints.
   - Plot the line \( x + y = 100 \).
   - Plot the vertical line \( x = 20 \).
   - Plot the horizontal line \( y = 10 \).

5. **Identify the Feasible Region:**
   - The feasible region is a polygon bounded by the lines \( x + y = 100 \), \( x = 20 \), and \( y = 10 \).

6. **Find the Corner Points:**
   - The corner points of the feasible region are where the lines intersect:
     - Intersection of \( x = 20 \) and \( y = 10 \): \( (20, 10) \).
     - Intersection of \( x = 20 \) and \( x + y = 100 \): \( (20, 80) \).
     - Intersection of \( y = 10 \) and \( x + y = 100 \): \( (90, 10) \).

7. **Evaluate the Objective Function at Each Corner Point:**
   - At \( (20, 10) \): \( P = 20(20) + 30(10) = 400 + 300 = 700 \).
   - At \( (20, 80) \): \( P = 20(20) + 30(80) = 400 + 2400 = 2800 \).
   - At \( (90, 10) \): \( P = 20(90) + 30(10) = 1800 + 300 = 2100 \).

8. **Determine the Maximum Profit:**
   - The maximum profit is \( 2800 \) at the point \( (20, 80) \).

**Final Answer:**
To maximize profit, the company should produce 20 units of Product A and 80 units of Product B per day, resulting in a maximum profit of $2800.
