To solve this problem, we need to determine how much rice Rose has left after cooking some in the morning and some in the evening. We'll go through the problem step by step.

1. **Initial Amount of Rice:**
   Rose starts with 10 kilograms of rice.

2. **Rice Cooked in the Morning:**
   Rose cooks \( \frac{9}{10} \) kilograms of rice in the morning.
   
   \[
   \text{Rice cooked in the morning} = \frac{9}{10} \text{ kg}
   \]

3. **Remaining Rice After Morning:**
   To find out how much rice is left after the morning, we subtract the amount cooked in the morning from the initial amount.
   
   \[
   \text{Remaining rice after morning} = 10 \text{ kg} - \frac{9}{10} \text{ kg}
   \]

   To perform this subtraction, we convert 10 kg into a fraction with a denominator of 10:
   
   \[
   10 \text{ kg} = \frac{100}{10} \text{ kg}
   \]

   Now, subtract:
   
   \[
   \frac{100}{10} \text{ kg} - \frac{9}{10} \text{ kg} = \frac{91}{10} \text{ kg}
   \]

4. **Rice Cooked in the Evening:**
   Rose cooks \( \frac{1}{4} \) of the remaining rice in the evening. First, we calculate \( \frac{1}{4} \) of the remaining rice.
   
   \[
   \text{Rice cooked in the evening} = \frac{1}{4} \times \frac{91}{10} \text{ kg}
   \]

   To multiply these fractions:
   
   \[
   \frac{1}{4} \times \frac{91}{10} = \frac{91}{40} \text{ kg}
   \]

5. **Remaining Rice After Evening:**
   Subtract the rice cooked in the evening from the remaining rice after the morning.
   
   \[
   \text{Remaining rice after evening} = \frac{91}{10} \text{ kg} - \frac{91}{40} \text{ kg}
   \]

   To subtract these fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 10 and 40 is 40. Convert \( \frac{91}{10} \) to a fraction with a denominator of 40:
   
   \[
   \frac{91}{10} = \frac{364}{40}
   \]

   Now subtract:
   
   \[
   \frac{364}{40} - \frac{91}{40} = \frac{273}{40} \text{ kg}
   \]

6. **Convert Kilograms to Grams:**
   Since 1 kilogram equals 1000 grams, we convert the remaining rice to grams.
   
   \[
   \frac{273}{40} \text{ kg} = \frac{273}{40} \times 1000 \text{ grams}
   \]

   Calculate the multiplication:
   
   \[
   \frac{273 \times 1000}{40} = \frac{273000}{40} = 6825 \text{ grams}
   \]

Thus, the final answer is that Rose has 6825 grams of rice left.
