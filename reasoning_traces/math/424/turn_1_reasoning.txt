Question ID: 424
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we will follow these steps:

1. **Determine the initial amount of rice Rose had.**
   - Rose started with 10 kilograms of rice.

2. **Convert kilograms to grams.**
   - Since we need the final answer in grams, we convert kilograms to grams. 
   - 1 kilogram = 1000 grams, so:
     \[
     10 \text{ kg} = 10 \times 1000 = 10000 \text{ grams}
     \]

3. **Calculate the amount of rice cooked in the morning.**
   - Rose cooked \( \frac{9}{10} \) kilograms in the morning. We need to convert this to grams:
     \[
     \frac{9}{10} \text{ kg} = \frac{9}{10} \times 1000 = 900 \text{ grams}
     \]

4. **Calculate the remaining rice after the morning cooking.**
   - We subtract the amount cooked in the morning from the initial amount:
     \[
     \text{Remaining rice} = 10000 \text{ grams} - 900 \text{ grams} = 9100 \text{ grams}
     \]

5. **Calculate the amount of rice cooked in the evening.**
   - Rose cooked \( \frac{1}{4} \) of the remaining rice in the evening. We first find \( \frac{1}{4} \) of 9100 grams:
     \[
     \frac{1}{4} \times 9100 = \frac{9100}{4} = 2275 \text{ grams}
     \]

6. **Calculate the remaining rice after the evening cooking.**
   - We subtract the amount cooked in the evening from the remaining rice:
     \[
     \text{Remaining rice} = 9100 \text{ grams} - 2275 \text{ grams} = 6825 \text{ grams}
     \]

7. **Final answer.**
   - The amount of rice Rose had left after cooking is:
     \[
     \boxed{6825} \text{ grams}
     \] 

This is the complete reasoning and calculation for the problem. Rose has 6825 grams of rice left after cooking.
