Question ID: 424
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we will follow these steps:

1. **Determine the initial amount of rice**: Rose starts with 10 kilograms of rice.

2. **Convert kilograms to grams**: Since we need the final answer in grams, we first convert kilograms to grams. 
   \[
   10 \text{ kg} = 10 \times 1000 \text{ g} = 10000 \text{ g}
   \]

3. **Calculate the amount of rice cooked in the morning**: Rose cooked \( \frac{9}{10} \) kilograms in the morning. We need to convert this to grams as well.
   \[
   \frac{9}{10} \text{ kg} = \frac{9}{10} \times 1000 \text{ g} = 900 \text{ g}
   \]

4. **Calculate the remaining rice after the morning cooking**: 
   \[
   \text{Remaining rice} = \text{Initial rice} - \text{Rice cooked in the morning}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Remaining rice} = 10000 \text{ g} - 900 \text{ g} = 9100 \text{ g}
   \]

5. **Calculate the amount of rice cooked in the evening**: Rose cooked \( \frac{1}{4} \) of the remaining rice in the evening. First, we need to find \( \frac{1}{4} \) of the remaining rice.
   \[
   \frac{1}{4} \text{ of } 9100 \text{ g} = \frac{9100}{4} = 2275 \text{ g}
   \]

6. **Calculate the remaining rice after the evening cooking**:
   \[
   \text{Remaining rice} = \text{Remaining rice after morning} - \text{Rice cooked in the evening}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Remaining rice} = 9100 \text{ g} - 2275 \text{ g} = 6825 \text{ g}
   \]

7. **Final answer**: The amount of rice Rose has left is 6825 grams.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{6825 \text{ g}}
\]
