Question ID: 424
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To find out how many employees can join the day trip, we need to calculate the total capacity of all the vehicles rented.

1. **Calculate the capacity of the buses:**
   - Number of buses = 4
   - Capacity of each bus = 60 employees
   - Total capacity of buses = Number of buses × Capacity of each bus
   \[
   \text{Total capacity of buses} = 4 \times 60 = 240 \text{ employees}
   \]

2. **Calculate the capacity of the minibusses:**
   - Number of minibusses = 6
   - Capacity of each minibus = 30 employees
   - Total capacity of minibusses = Number of minibusses × Capacity of each minibus
   \[
   \text{Total capacity of minibusses} = 6 \times 30 = 180 \text{ employees}
   \]

3. **Calculate the capacity of the minivans:**
   - Number of minivans = 10
   - Capacity of each minivan = 15 employees
   - Total capacity of minivans = Number of minivans × Capacity of each minivan
   \[
   \text{Total capacity of minivans} = 10 \times 15 = 150 \text{ employees}
   \]

4. **Calculate the total capacity of all vehicles:**
   - Total capacity = Total capacity of buses + Total capacity of minibusses + Total capacity of minivans
   \[
   \text{Total capacity} = 240 + 180 + 150 = 570 \text{ employees}
   \]

Therefore, the total number of employees that can join the day trip is **570**.

Final answer: **570 employees**.
