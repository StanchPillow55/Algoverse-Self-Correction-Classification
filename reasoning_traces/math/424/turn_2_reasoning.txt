Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine how much rice Rose has left after cooking some in the morning and some in the evening. We'll go through the problem step by step.

### Step 1: Convert kilograms to grams
Since the final answer needs to be in grams, it's useful to convert all measurements to grams from the start. We know that:

1 kilogram = 1000 grams

So, Rose initially had:
\[ 10 \text{ kilograms} = 10 \times 1000 = 10,000 \text{ grams} \]

### Step 2: Calculate the amount of rice cooked in the morning
Rose cooked \( \frac{9}{10} \) kilograms of rice in the morning. Converting this to grams:

\[ \frac{9}{10} \text{ kilograms} = \frac{9}{10} \times 1000 = 900 \text{ grams} \]

### Step 3: Calculate the remaining rice after the morning
Subtract the rice cooked in the morning from the initial amount:

\[ 10,000 \text{ grams} - 900 \text{ grams} = 9,100 \text{ grams} \]

### Step 4: Calculate the amount of rice cooked in the evening
Rose cooked \( \frac{1}{4} \) of the remaining rice in the evening. First, we find \( \frac{1}{4} \) of the remaining 9,100 grams:

\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 9,100 = \frac{9,100}{4} = 2,275 \text{ grams} \]

### Step 5: Calculate the remaining rice after the evening
Subtract the rice cooked in the evening from the remaining amount after the morning:

\[ 9,100 \text{ grams} - 2,275 \text{ grams} = 6,825 \text{ grams} \]

### Final Answer
After cooking rice in the morning and evening, Rose has 6,825 grams of rice left.

\[ \boxed{6,825 \text{ grams}} \]
