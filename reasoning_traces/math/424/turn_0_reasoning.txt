To solve this problem, we need to determine how much rice Rose has left after cooking some in the morning and some in the evening. We'll go through the problem step by step.

1. **Initial Amount of Rice:**
   - Rose starts with 10 kilograms of rice.

2. **Rice Cooked in the Morning:**
   - In the morning, she cooks \( \frac{9}{10} \) kilograms of rice.
   - To find out how much rice is left after the morning, subtract the amount cooked from the initial amount:
     \[
     10 - \frac{9}{10} = \frac{100}{10} - \frac{9}{10} = \frac{100 - 9}{10} = \frac{91}{10} \text{ kilograms}
     \]

3. **Rice Cooked in the Evening:**
   - In the evening, she cooks \( \frac{1}{4} \) of the remaining rice.
   - First, calculate \( \frac{1}{4} \) of the remaining rice:
     \[
     \frac{1}{4} \times \frac{91}{10} = \frac{91}{40} \text{ kilograms}
     \]
   - Subtract this amount from the remaining rice after the morning:
     \[
     \frac{91}{10} - \frac{91}{40}
     \]
   - To subtract these fractions, find a common denominator. The least common multiple of 10 and 40 is 40.
   - Convert \( \frac{91}{10} \) to a fraction with a denominator of 40:
     \[
     \frac{91}{10} = \frac{91 \times 4}{10 \times 4} = \frac{364}{40}
     \]
   - Now perform the subtraction:
     \[
     \frac{364}{40} - \frac{91}{40} = \frac{364 - 91}{40} = \frac{273}{40} \text{ kilograms}
     \]

4. **Convert Kilograms to Grams:**
   - There are 1000 grams in a kilogram. Convert the remaining rice to grams:
     \[
     \frac{273}{40} \times 1000 = \frac{273 \times 1000}{40} = \frac{273000}{40}
     \]
   - Simplify the division:
     \[
     \frac{273000}{40} = 6825 \text{ grams}
     \]

Therefore, Rose has 6825 grams of rice left after cooking in the morning and evening.

**Final Answer:**
6825 grams
