==================================================

To solve the problem, we will follow these steps:

1. **Determine the amount of rice cooked in the morning.**
2. **Calculate the remaining rice after the morning cooking.**
3. **Determine the amount of rice cooked in the evening.**
4. **Calculate the remaining rice after the evening cooking.**
5. **Convert the final amount of rice from kilograms to grams.**

### Step 1: Amount of rice cooked in the morning

Rose started with 10 kilograms of rice. She cooked \( \frac{9}{10} \) kilograms in the morning.

\[
\text{Rice cooked in the morning} = \frac{9}{10} \text{ kg}
\]

### Step 2: Remaining rice after the morning cooking

To find the remaining rice after cooking in the morning, we subtract the amount cooked from the initial amount:

\[
\text{Remaining rice} = 10 \text{ kg} - \frac{9}{10} \text{ kg}
\]

To perform this subtraction, we can convert 10 kg into a fraction with a denominator of 10:

\[
10 \text{ kg} = \frac{100}{10} \text{ kg}
\]

Now we can subtract:

\[
\text{Remaining rice} = \frac{100}{10} \text{ kg} - \frac{9}{10} \text{ kg} = \frac{100 - 9}{10} \text{ kg} = \frac{91}{10} \text{ kg}
\]

### Step 3: Amount of rice cooked in the evening

In the evening, Rose cooked \( \frac{1}{4} \) of the remaining rice. We first need to calculate \( \frac{1}{4} \) of the remaining rice:

\[
\text{Remaining rice} = \frac{91}{10} \text{ kg}
\]

Now, we calculate \( \frac{1}{4} \) of \( \frac{91}{10} \):

\[
\text{Rice cooked in the evening} = \frac{1}{4} \times \frac{91}{10} = \frac{91}{40} \text{ kg}
\]

### Step 4: Remaining rice after the evening cooking

Now we subtract the amount cooked in the evening from the remaining rice:

\[
\text{Remaining rice after evening} = \frac{91}{10} \text{ kg} - \frac{91}{40} \text{ kg}
\]

To perform this subtraction, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 10 and 40 is 40. We convert \( \frac{91}{10} \) to have a denominator of 40:

\[
\frac{91}{10} = \frac{91 \times 4}{10 \times 4} = \frac{364}{40}
\]

Now we can subtract:

\[
\text{Remaining rice after evening} = \frac{364}{40} \text{ kg} - \frac{91}{40} \text{ kg} = \frac{364 - 91}{40} \text{ kg} = \frac{273}{40} \text{ kg}
\]

### Step 5: Convert the final amount of rice from kilograms to grams

To convert kilograms to grams, we multiply by 1000 (since 1 kg = 1000 g):

\[
\text{Remaining rice in grams} = \frac{273}{40} \text{ kg} \times 1000 \text{ g/kg} = \frac{273000}{40} \text{ g}
\]

Now we perform the division:

\[
\frac{273000}{40} = 6825 \text{ g}
\]

### Final Answer

Thus, the amount of rice Rose had left is:

\[
\boxed{6825} \text{ grams}
\]
