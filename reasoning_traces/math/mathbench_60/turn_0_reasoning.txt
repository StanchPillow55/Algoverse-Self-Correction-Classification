==================================================

To solve the problem, we first need to understand what "Sample math problem 60" refers to. Since no specific details are provided about the problem, I'll assume it involves a basic mathematical operation involving the number 60. Let's consider a few possibilities and solve them:

### Possibility 1: Basic Arithmetic Operations

1. **Addition**: Let's assume the problem is to add 60 to another number, say 40.
   \[
   60 + 40 = 100
   \]
   Final Answer: 100

2. **Subtraction**: Let's assume the problem is to subtract 20 from 60.
   \[
   60 - 20 = 40
   \]
   Final Answer: 40

3. **Multiplication**: Let's assume the problem is to multiply 60 by 3.
   \[
   60 \times 3 = 180
   \]
   Final Answer: 180

4. **Division**: Let's assume the problem is to divide 60 by 5.
   \[
   60 \div 5 = 12
   \]
   Final Answer: 12

### Possibility 2: More Complex Operations

1. **Finding a Percentage**: Let's assume the problem is to find 25% of 60.
   \[
   25\% \text{ of } 60 = \frac{25}{100} \times 60 = 0.25 \times 60 = 15
   \]
   Final Answer: 15

2. **Finding a Factorial**: Let's assume the problem is to find the factorial of 60 (denoted as 60!).
   - Calculating 60! directly is complex and typically requires computational tools, but the factorial of a number is the product of all positive integers up to that number.
   - For example, \(5! = 5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 120\).
   - 60! is a very large number and not typically calculated by hand.

3. **Prime Factorization**: Let's assume the problem is to find the prime factorization of 60.
   - Start by dividing by the smallest prime number, 2:
     \[
     60 \div 2 = 30
     \]
   - Divide 30 by 2:
     \[
     30 \div 2 = 15
     \]
   - 15 is not divisible by 2, so move to the next prime number, 3:
     \[
     15 \div 3 = 5
     \]
   - 5 is a prime number.
   - Therefore, the prime factorization of 60 is:
     \[
     60 = 2^2 \times 3 \times 5
     \]
   Final Answer: \(2^2 \times 3 \times 5\)

### Conclusion

Without specific details about "Sample math problem 60," I've demonstrated how to solve various mathematical problems involving the number 60. If you have a specific problem in mind, please provide more details for a precise solution.
