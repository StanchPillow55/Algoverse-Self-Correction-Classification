Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we first need to understand what "Sample math problem 60" refers to. Since the problem is not explicitly stated, let's assume it involves solving a mathematical equation or problem related to the number 60. 

Let's consider a common type of problem involving the number 60: finding the factors of 60 and determining its prime factorization.

### Step 1: Find the Factors of 60
Factors of a number are integers that can be multiplied together to produce the original number. To find the factors of 60, we can start by testing divisibility by smaller numbers:

1. **1 and 60**: 1 × 60 = 60
2. **2 and 30**: 60 is even, so it is divisible by 2. 2 × 30 = 60
3. **3 and 20**: The sum of the digits of 60 is 6, which is divisible by 3. 3 × 20 = 60
4. **4 and 15**: 60 divided by 4 gives a whole number. 4 × 15 = 60
5. **5 and 12**: 60 ends in 0, so it is divisible by 5. 5 × 12 = 60
6. **6 and 10**: 60 divided by 6 gives a whole number. 6 × 10 = 60

Thus, the factors of 60 are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10, 12, 15, 20, 30, and 60.

### Step 2: Prime Factorization of 60
Prime factorization involves expressing a number as a product of its prime factors.

1. **Divide by 2**: 60 is even, so divide by 2.
   \[
   60 \div 2 = 30
   \]
2. **Divide by 2 again**: 30 is also even.
   \[
   30 \div 2 = 15
   \]
3. **Divide by 3**: The sum of the digits of 15 is 6, which is divisible by 3.
   \[
   15 \div 3 = 5
   \]
4. **Divide by 5**: 5 is a prime number.
   \[
   5 \div 5 = 1
   \]

The prime factorization of 60 is \(2^2 \times 3 \times 5\).

### Conclusion
The factors of 60 are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10, 12, 15, 20, 30, and 60. The prime factorization of 60 is \(2^2 \times 3 \times 5\).

If the problem intended was different, please provide more specific details or context for "Sample math problem 60." Otherwise, based on the assumptions made, the final answer is:

**Factors of 60**: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10, 12, 15, 20, 30, 60  
**Prime Factorization of 60**: \(2^2 \times 3 \times 5\)
