Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we first need to understand what "Sample math problem 60" refers to. Since the problem is not explicitly stated, I'll assume it involves a typical math problem that could be associated with the number 60. Let's consider a few possibilities:

### Possibility 1: Basic Arithmetic Problem
Let's assume the problem is to find the sum of the digits of the number 60.

1. **Identify the digits of 60**: The number 60 consists of the digits 6 and 0.
2. **Add the digits**: 
   \[
   6 + 0 = 6
   \]

**Final Answer**: The sum of the digits of 60 is 6.

### Possibility 2: Prime Factorization
Let's assume the problem is to find the prime factorization of 60.

1. **Start with the smallest prime number, 2**:
   - 60 is even, so divide by 2:
     \[
     60 \div 2 = 30
     \]
   - 30 is even, so divide by 2 again:
     \[
     30 \div 2 = 15
     \]

2. **Move to the next smallest prime number, 3**:
   - 15 is divisible by 3:
     \[
     15 \div 3 = 5
     \]

3. **Check the remaining number, 5**:
   - 5 is a prime number.

Thus, the prime factorization of 60 is:
\[
60 = 2^2 \times 3 \times 5
\]

**Final Answer**: The prime factorization of 60 is \(2^2 \times 3 \times 5\).

### Possibility 3: Solve an Equation
Let's assume the problem is to solve a simple equation involving 60, such as \(x + 20 = 60\).

1. **Isolate \(x\)**:
   \[
   x + 20 = 60
   \]
   Subtract 20 from both sides:
   \[
   x = 60 - 20
   \]
   \[
   x = 40
   \]

**Final Answer**: \(x = 40\).

### Conclusion
Without a specific problem statement, I've considered a few common types of math problems involving the number 60. If you have a specific problem in mind, please provide more details so I can address it accurately.
