==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 60," we first need to understand what the problem is asking. However, the problem statement "Sample math problem 60" is not clear or specific enough to determine what mathematical operations or concepts are involved. 

Since the problem is not explicitly defined, let's assume it might be a simple arithmetic problem involving the number 60. Here are a few possibilities and how we might solve them:

### Possibility 1: Basic Arithmetic Operations

1. **Addition**: If the problem is to add 60 to another number, say \( x \), the solution would be:
   \[
   60 + x
   \]
   Without a specific \( x \), we can't compute a numerical answer.

2. **Subtraction**: If the problem is to subtract a number from 60, say \( x \), the solution would be:
   \[
   60 - x
   \]
   Again, without a specific \( x \), we can't compute a numerical answer.

3. **Multiplication**: If the problem is to multiply 60 by another number, say \( x \), the solution would be:
   \[
   60 \times x
   \]
   Without a specific \( x \), we can't compute a numerical answer.

4. **Division**: If the problem is to divide 60 by another number, say \( x \), the solution would be:
   \[
   \frac{60}{x}
   \]
   Again, without a specific \( x \), we can't compute a numerical answer.

### Possibility 2: Factors of 60

If the problem involves finding the factors of 60, we would list all the integers that divide 60 without leaving a remainder. The factors of 60 are:
\[
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10, 12, 15, 20, 30, 60
\]

### Possibility 3: Prime Factorization

If the problem involves finding the prime factorization of 60, we would break it down into its prime factors:
\[
60 = 2^2 \times 3 \times 5
\]

### Possibility 4: Solving an Equation Involving 60

If the problem involves solving an equation like \( x + 60 = 100 \), we would solve for \( x \) as follows:
\[
x + 60 = 100 \\
x = 100 - 60 \\
x = 40
\]

### Conclusion

Without a specific problem statement, we can't determine the exact operations or calculations needed. If you have a specific math problem involving the number 60, please provide more details so I can assist you further.
