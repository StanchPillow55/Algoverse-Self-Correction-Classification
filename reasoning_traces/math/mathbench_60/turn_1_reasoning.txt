==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 60," we need to first understand what the problem is asking. However, the problem statement "Sample math problem 60" is not clear or specific. It seems like a placeholder or a reference to a specific problem that is not fully described here.

To proceed, I will assume that "Sample math problem 60" refers to a typical math problem that might involve basic arithmetic, algebra, geometry, or another area of mathematics. Since I don't have the specific details of the problem, I'll create a sample math problem involving the number 60 and solve it step by step.

**Sample Problem:**
Calculate the sum of all even numbers from 1 to 60.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Identify the Even Numbers:**
   Even numbers are integers that are divisible by 2. The even numbers between 1 and 60 are: 2, 4, 6, ..., 60.

2. **Determine the Sequence:**
   This sequence is an arithmetic sequence where the first term \( a_1 = 2 \) and the common difference \( d = 2 \).

3. **Find the Number of Terms (n):**
   To find the number of terms in this sequence, use the formula for the \( n \)-th term of an arithmetic sequence:
   \[
   a_n = a_1 + (n-1) \cdot d
   \]
   Set \( a_n = 60 \) (the last term):
   \[
   60 = 2 + (n-1) \cdot 2
   \]
   \[
   60 = 2 + 2n - 2
   \]
   \[
   60 = 2n
   \]
   \[
   n = 30
   \]
   There are 30 even numbers from 1 to 60.

4. **Calculate the Sum of the Sequence:**
   The sum \( S_n \) of the first \( n \) terms of an arithmetic sequence is given by:
   \[
   S_n = \frac{n}{2} \cdot (a_1 + a_n)
   \]
   Substitute the known values:
   \[
   S_{30} = \frac{30}{2} \cdot (2 + 60)
   \]
   \[
   S_{30} = 15 \cdot 62
   \]
   \[
   S_{30} = 930
   \]

**Final Answer:**
The sum of all even numbers from 1 to 60 is 930.
