Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the sample math problem 386, we need to first understand what the problem is asking. However, since "Sample math problem 386" is not specified in detail, I'll create a hypothetical math problem labeled as 386 and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Math Problem 386:**

Calculate the value of \( x \) in the equation:

\[ 3x + 5 = 2x + 15 \]

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Equation:**
   The given equation is a linear equation in one variable, \( x \). Our goal is to isolate \( x \) on one side of the equation to find its value.

2. **Simplify the Equation:**
   Start by getting all terms involving \( x \) on one side and constant terms on the other side. We can do this by subtracting \( 2x \) from both sides of the equation:

   \[
   3x + 5 - 2x = 2x + 15 - 2x
   \]

   Simplifying both sides gives:

   \[
   x + 5 = 15
   \]

3. **Isolate \( x \):**
   Next, we need to isolate \( x \) by removing the constant term on the left side. Subtract 5 from both sides:

   \[
   x + 5 - 5 = 15 - 5
   \]

   Simplifying both sides gives:

   \[
   x = 10
   \]

4. **Verify the Solution:**
   To ensure our solution is correct, substitute \( x = 10 \) back into the original equation:

   \[
   3(10) + 5 = 2(10) + 15
   \]

   Calculate both sides:

   \[
   30 + 5 = 20 + 15
   \]

   \[
   35 = 35
   \]

   Since both sides are equal, our solution \( x = 10 \) is verified.

**Final Answer:**

The value of \( x \) is \( 10 \).
