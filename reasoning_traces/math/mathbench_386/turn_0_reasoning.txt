==================================================

To solve the problem, I need to first understand what "Sample math problem 386" refers to. Since I don't have access to external databases or specific problem sets, I'll assume this is a generic math problem and create a sample problem to solve.

Let's assume "Sample math problem 386" is a problem involving solving a quadratic equation. Here's a sample problem:

**Problem:**
Solve the quadratic equation \(2x^2 - 4x - 6 = 0\).

**Solution:**

To solve the quadratic equation \(2x^2 - 4x - 6 = 0\), we can use the quadratic formula, which is:

\[
x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
\]

where \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) are the coefficients from the quadratic equation \(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\).

For our equation, \(a = 2\), \(b = -4\), and \(c = -6\).

**Step 1: Calculate the discriminant (\(b^2 - 4ac\))**

\[
b^2 - 4ac = (-4)^2 - 4 \times 2 \times (-6)
\]

\[
= 16 + 48
\]

\[
= 64
\]

**Step 2: Apply the quadratic formula**

Since the discriminant is positive, we will have two real solutions.

\[
x = \frac{-(-4) \pm \sqrt{64}}{2 \times 2}
\]

\[
x = \frac{4 \pm 8}{4}
\]

**Step 3: Calculate the two possible values for \(x\)**

1. \(x = \frac{4 + 8}{4} = \frac{12}{4} = 3\)

2. \(x = \frac{4 - 8}{4} = \frac{-4}{4} = -1\)

**Final Answer:**

The solutions to the quadratic equation \(2x^2 - 4x - 6 = 0\) are \(x = 3\) and \(x = -1\).
