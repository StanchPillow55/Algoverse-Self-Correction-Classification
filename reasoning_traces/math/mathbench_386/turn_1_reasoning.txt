Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we first need to understand what "Sample math problem 386" refers to. Since the problem is not explicitly stated, I'll assume it involves a typical math problem that might be labeled as "problem 386" in a textbook or worksheet. Without specific details, I'll create a hypothetical math problem and solve it step-by-step.

**Hypothetical Problem 386:**
Solve the quadratic equation: \(2x^2 - 4x - 6 = 0\).

**Step 1: Identify the coefficients.**
The given quadratic equation is in the standard form \(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\), where:
- \(a = 2\)
- \(b = -4\)
- \(c = -6\)

**Step 2: Use the quadratic formula.**
The quadratic formula is given by:
\[ x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the discriminant.**
The discriminant (\(D\)) is the part of the quadratic formula under the square root: \(b^2 - 4ac\).
\[ D = (-4)^2 - 4 \times 2 \times (-6) \]
\[ D = 16 + 48 \]
\[ D = 64 \]

**Step 4: Determine the roots using the quadratic formula.**
Since the discriminant is positive (\(D = 64\)), there are two distinct real roots.
\[ x = \frac{-(-4) \pm \sqrt{64}}{2 \times 2} \]
\[ x = \frac{4 \pm 8}{4} \]

**Step 5: Calculate the two possible values for \(x\).**
1. \( x_1 = \frac{4 + 8}{4} = \frac{12}{4} = 3 \)
2. \( x_2 = \frac{4 - 8}{4} = \frac{-4}{4} = -1 \)

**Final Answer:**
The solutions to the quadratic equation \(2x^2 - 4x - 6 = 0\) are \(x = 3\) and \(x = -1\).
