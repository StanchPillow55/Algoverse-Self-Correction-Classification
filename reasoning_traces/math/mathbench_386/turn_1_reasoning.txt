Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we first need to understand what "Sample math problem 386" refers to. Since the problem is not explicitly stated, let's assume it is a hypothetical math problem. For the sake of this exercise, I'll create a sample math problem and solve it step by step.

**Sample Math Problem 386:**

**Problem:**  
Solve for \( x \) in the equation:  
\[ 3x + 5 = 2x + 11 \]

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Equation:**
   The equation given is a linear equation in one variable, \( x \). Our goal is to isolate \( x \) on one side of the equation to find its value.

2. **Simplify the Equation:**
   Start by getting all terms involving \( x \) on one side of the equation and constant terms on the other side. We can do this by subtracting \( 2x \) from both sides of the equation:

   \[
   3x + 5 - 2x = 2x + 11 - 2x
   \]

   Simplifying both sides gives:

   \[
   x + 5 = 11
   \]

3. **Isolate \( x \):**
   Next, we need to isolate \( x \) by getting rid of the constant term on the left side. Subtract 5 from both sides:

   \[
   x + 5 - 5 = 11 - 5
   \]

   Simplifying both sides gives:

   \[
   x = 6
   \]

4. **Verify the Solution:**
   To ensure our solution is correct, substitute \( x = 6 \) back into the original equation:

   \[
   3(6) + 5 = 2(6) + 11
   \]

   Calculate both sides:

   \[
   18 + 5 = 12 + 11
   \]

   \[
   23 = 23
   \]

   Since both sides of the equation are equal, our solution is verified.

**Final Answer:**

The solution to the equation \( 3x + 5 = 2x + 11 \) is \( x = 6 \).
