==================================================

To solve the problem effectively, I need to know the specific details of "Sample math problem 31." Since the problem is not provided, I'll demonstrate how to approach a generic math problem step by step. If you have a specific problem in mind, please provide the details, and I'll work through that.

Let's assume a sample math problem:

**Problem:** Solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).

**Step 1: Understand the Problem**

The equation given is a simple linear equation in one variable. Our goal is to find the value of \( x \) that makes the equation true.

**Step 2: Isolate the Variable**

To solve for \( x \), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We start by eliminating the constant term on the left side.

- The equation is \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).

**Step 3: Eliminate the Constant**

Subtract 3 from both sides of the equation to remove the constant term from the left side.

\[
2x + 3 - 3 = 11 - 3
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
2x = 8
\]

**Step 4: Solve for the Variable**

Now, divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( x \).

\[
\frac{2x}{2} = \frac{8}{2}
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
x = 4
\]

**Step 5: Verify the Solution**

To ensure the solution is correct, substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation and check if both sides are equal.

Original equation: \( 2x + 3 = 11 \)

Substitute \( x = 4 \):

\[
2(4) + 3 = 11
\]

Calculate the left side:

\[
8 + 3 = 11
\]

Since both sides of the equation are equal, the solution \( x = 4 \) is correct.

**Final Answer:**

The solution to the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \) is \( x = 4 \).

If you have a specific "Sample math problem 31" in mind, please provide the details, and I'll be happy to solve it for you.
