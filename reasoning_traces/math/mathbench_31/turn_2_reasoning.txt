==================================================

To solve the problem effectively, I need to first understand what "Sample math problem 31" entails. Since the problem is not explicitly stated, I'll demonstrate how to approach a generic math problem step by step. Let's assume "Sample math problem 31" is a typical algebra problem, such as solving a linear equation. Here's how I would approach it:

### Problem:
Solve the equation for \( x \):
\[ 3x + 5 = 20 \]

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Understand the Equation**:
   The equation \( 3x + 5 = 20 \) is a linear equation in one variable, \( x \). The goal is to find the value of \( x \) that makes this equation true.

2. **Isolate the Variable**:
   To solve for \( x \), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We can do this by performing inverse operations.

3. **Subtract 5 from Both Sides**:
   To eliminate the constant term on the left side, subtract 5 from both sides of the equation:
   \[
   3x + 5 - 5 = 20 - 5
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   3x = 15
   \]

4. **Divide by 3**:
   Now, divide both sides by 3 to solve for \( x \):
   \[
   \frac{3x}{3} = \frac{15}{3}
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   x = 5
   \]

5. **Verify the Solution**:
   Substitute \( x = 5 \) back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies the equation:
   \[
   3(5) + 5 = 20
   \]
   Simplifying the left side:
   \[
   15 + 5 = 20
   \]
   \[
   20 = 20
   \]
   Since both sides are equal, \( x = 5 \) is indeed the correct solution.

### Final Answer:
The solution to the equation \( 3x + 5 = 20 \) is \( x = 5 \).

This step-by-step approach ensures that each part of the problem is addressed methodically, leading to a clear and verified solution. If "Sample math problem 31" refers to a different type of problem, please provide additional details so I can tailor the solution accordingly.
