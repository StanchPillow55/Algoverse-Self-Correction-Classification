==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample math problem 31" refers to. Since the problem itself is not provided, I'll create a sample math problem and solve it step by step.

**Sample Math Problem 31:**

Calculate the value of \( x \) in the equation:

\[ 3x + 5 = 2x + 15 \]

**Step-by-step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Equation:**
   The given equation is a linear equation in one variable, \( x \). Our goal is to isolate \( x \) on one side of the equation to find its value.

2. **Simplify the Equation:**
   Start by getting all terms involving \( x \) on one side of the equation and constant terms on the other side. We can do this by subtracting \( 2x \) from both sides:

   \[
   3x + 5 - 2x = 2x + 15 - 2x
   \]

   Simplifying both sides gives:

   \[
   x + 5 = 15
   \]

3. **Isolate \( x \):**
   Next, we need to isolate \( x \) by removing the constant term on the left side. We do this by subtracting 5 from both sides:

   \[
   x + 5 - 5 = 15 - 5
   \]

   Simplifying both sides gives:

   \[
   x = 10
   \]

4. **Verify the Solution:**
   To ensure our solution is correct, substitute \( x = 10 \) back into the original equation:

   \[
   3(10) + 5 = 2(10) + 15
   \]

   Calculate each side:

   \[
   30 + 5 = 20 + 15
   \]

   \[
   35 = 35
   \]

   Since both sides of the equation are equal, our solution \( x = 10 \) is verified.

**Final Answer:**

The value of \( x \) is \( 10 \).
