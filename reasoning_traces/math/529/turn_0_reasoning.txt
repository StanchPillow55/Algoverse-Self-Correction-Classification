==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to determine how many CDs Tom could have bought if he had not purchased the headphone set. 

1. **Identify the total amount spent**: Tom spent a total of $48.

2. **Identify the cost of the CD**: Each CD costs $4.

3. **Let’s denote the cost of the headphone set as \( H \)**. Since Tom bought one CD and the headphone set, we can express the total cost as:
   \[
   4 + H = 48
   \]

4. **Solve for \( H \)**: To find the cost of the headphone set, we can rearrange the equation:
   \[
   H = 48 - 4
   \]
   \[
   H = 44
   \]
   So, the headphone set costs $44.

5. **Calculate how much money Tom would have if he didn’t buy the headphone set**: If Tom had not bought the headphone set, he would have the full $48 to spend on CDs. 

6. **Determine how many CDs he could buy with $48**: To find out how many CDs Tom could buy with $48, we divide the total amount by the cost of one CD:
   \[
   \text{Number of CDs} = \frac{48}{4} = 12
   \]

7. **Determine how many CDs Tom actually bought**: Since Tom bought one CD, we need to find out how many more CDs he could have bought if he hadn’t purchased the headphone set:
   \[
   \text{More CDs he could buy} = 12 - 1 = 11
   \]

8. **Final answer**: Therefore, if Tom had decided not to buy the headphone set, he would have been able to buy 11 more CDs.

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{11}
\]
