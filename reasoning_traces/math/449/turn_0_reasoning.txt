Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of spiders in the group and then calculate the total number of legs based on that number.

### Step 1: Determine the number of spiders in the group

1. **Understand the problem statement:**
   - A single spider has 8 legs.
   - The group of spiders has 10 more spiders than half as many legs as a single spider has.

2. **Calculate half as many legs as a single spider has:**
   - A single spider has 8 legs.
   - Half of 8 legs is \( \frac{8}{2} = 4 \).

3. **Determine the number of spiders in the group:**
   - The group has 10 more spiders than this number.
   - Therefore, the number of spiders in the group is \( 4 + 10 = 14 \).

### Step 2: Calculate the total number of spider legs in the group

1. **Calculate the total number of legs:**
   - Each spider has 8 legs.
   - There are 14 spiders in the group.
   - Therefore, the total number of legs is \( 14 \times 8 \).

2. **Perform the multiplication:**
   \[
   14 \times 8 = 112
   \]

### Conclusion

The total number of spider legs in this group of spiders is 112.

**Final Answer: 112**
