To find out how many colors of crayons Beatrice bought in total, we need to calculate the total number of crayons in the packets she purchased.

1. **Identify the number of packets and crayons per packet:**
   - Beatrice bought 6 packets that each contained 8 pieces of colors.
   - She also bought 4 packets that each contained 16 pieces of colors.

2. **Calculate the total number of crayons from the first set of packets:**
   - For the 6 packets with 8 pieces each:
     \[
     \text{Total crayons from first set} = 6 \text{ packets} \times 8 \text{ crayons/packet} = 48 \text{ crayons}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total number of crayons from the second set of packets:**
   - For the 4 packets with 16 pieces each:
     \[
     \text{Total crayons from second set} = 4 \text{ packets} \times 16 \text{ crayons/packet} = 64 \text{ crayons}
     \]

4. **Add the total number of crayons from both sets:**
   - Now, we need to add the total crayons from the first set and the second set:
     \[
     \text{Total crayons} = 48 \text{ crayons} + 64 \text{ crayons} = 112 \text{ crayons}
     \]

5. **Final answer:**
   - Therefore, the total number of colors of crayons that Beatrice bought is:
     \[
     \boxed{112}
     \]
