==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to break it down step by step.

1. **Identify the number of legs a single spider has**: 
   A spider has 8 legs.

2. **Determine how many legs half as many as a single spider has**: 
   Half of the number of legs a single spider has is:
   \[
   \frac{8}{2} = 4 \text{ legs}
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of spiders in the group**: 
   According to the problem, the group of spiders has 10 more spiders than half as many legs as a single spider has. Therefore, the number of spiders in the group is:
   \[
   4 + 10 = 14 \text{ spiders}
   \]

4. **Calculate the total number of legs in the group of spiders**: 
   Since each spider has 8 legs, the total number of legs in the group of 14 spiders is:
   \[
   14 \text{ spiders} \times 8 \text{ legs/spider} = 112 \text{ legs}
   \]

5. **Final answer**: 
   The total number of spider legs in this group of spiders is:
   \[
   \boxed{112}
   \]
