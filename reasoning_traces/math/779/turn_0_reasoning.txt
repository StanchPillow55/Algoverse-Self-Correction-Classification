To solve the problem, we need to break it down into steps and calculate the distance the Llesis family traveled to their vacation spot.

1. **Determine the driving speed and hiking speed:**
   - The average driving speed is given as 50 miles per hour.
   - The hiking speed is stated to be 5 miles per hour less than half of their driving speed. 
   - First, we calculate half of the driving speed:
     \[
     \text{Half of driving speed} = \frac{50}{2} = 25 \text{ miles per hour}
     \]
   - Now, we subtract 5 miles per hour from this value to find the hiking speed:
     \[
     \text{Hiking speed} = 25 - 5 = 20 \text{ miles per hour}
     \]

2. **Calculate the time spent driving:**
   - The total time for the trip is 6 hours, and it took them 1.5 hours to hike.
   - Therefore, the time spent driving can be calculated as follows:
     \[
     \text{Time spent driving} = \text{Total time} - \text{Time spent hiking} = 6 - 1.5 = 4.5 \text{ hours}
     \]

3. **Calculate the distance driven:**
   - We can now calculate the distance they drove using the formula:
     \[
     \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time}
     \]
   - Using the driving speed and the time spent driving:
     \[
     \text{Distance driven} = 50 \text{ miles per hour} \times 4.5 \text{ hours} = 225 \text{ miles}
     \]

4. **Calculate the distance hiked:**
   - Similarly, we can calculate the distance they hiked:
     \[
     \text{Distance hiked} = 20 \text{ miles per hour} \times 1.5 \text{ hours} = 30 \text{ miles}
     \]

5. **Calculate the total distance to the vacation spot:**
   - The total distance to their vacation spot is the sum of the distance driven and the distance hiked:
     \[
     \text{Total distance} = \text{Distance driven} + \text{Distance hiked} = 225 \text{ miles} + 30 \text{ miles} = 255 \text{ miles}
     \]

Thus, the total distance to the Llesis family's vacation spot is:

\[
\boxed{255} \text{ miles}
\]
