Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we will define the variables and set up an equation based on the information provided.

1. **Define the Variables**:
   - Let \( b \) be the number of blue gumballs.
   - Let \( p \) be the number of pink gumballs.

2. **Information Given**:
   - We know that there are 12 blue gumballs, so \( b = 12 \).
   - The problem states that there are 22 more than four times the number of blue gumballs as there are pink gumballs. This can be expressed mathematically as:
     \[
     p = 4b + 22
     \]

3. **Substituting the Value of \( b \)**:
   - Now we substitute \( b = 12 \) into the equation:
     \[
     p = 4(12) + 22
     \]

4. **Calculating the Right Side**:
   - First, calculate \( 4 \times 12 \):
     \[
     4 \times 12 = 48
     \]
   - Now add 22 to this result:
     \[
     48 + 22 = 70
     \]

5. **Final Calculation**:
   - Therefore, the number of pink gumballs \( p \) is:
     \[
     p = 70
     \]

6. **Conclusion**:
   - The final answer is that there are **70 pink gumballs** in the candy machine.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{70}
\]
