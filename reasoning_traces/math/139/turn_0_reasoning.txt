To solve the problem, we need to calculate the total number of flights of stairs Janice walks in a single day, both going up and going down.

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - Janice walks up 3 flights of stairs to reach her office.
   - She goes up the stairs 5 times in a day.
   - She goes down the stairs 3 times in a day.

2. **Calculating the Total Flights of Stairs Walked Up**:
   - Each time Janice goes up, she walks 3 flights of stairs.
   - If she goes up 5 times, the total number of flights walked up is:
     \[
     \text{Flights up} = 3 \text{ flights} \times 5 \text{ times} = 15 \text{ flights}
     \]

3. **Calculating the Total Flights of Stairs Walked Down**:
   - Each time Janice goes down, she also walks 3 flights of stairs.
   - If she goes down 3 times, the total number of flights walked down is:
     \[
     \text{Flights down} = 3 \text{ flights} \times 3 \text{ times} = 9 \text{ flights}
     \]

4. **Calculating the Total Flights of Stairs Walked (Up and Down)**:
   - To find the total number of flights of stairs Janice walks in a day, we add the flights walked up and the flights walked down:
     \[
     \text{Total flights} = \text{Flights up} + \text{Flights down} = 15 \text{ flights} + 9 \text{ flights} = 24 \text{ flights}
     \]

5. **Final Answer**:
   - Therefore, the total number of flights of stairs Janice walks in a single day is:
     \[
     \boxed{24}
     \]
