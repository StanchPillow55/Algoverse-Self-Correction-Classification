==================================================

To determine how many flights of stairs Janice walks in a single day, we need to consider both the flights she walks up and the flights she walks down.

1. **Flights Walked Up:**
   - Janice walks up 3 flights of stairs each time she goes up to her office.
   - She does this 5 times in a day.
   - Therefore, the total number of flights she walks up is calculated as follows:
     \[
     \text{Flights walked up} = 3 \text{ flights} \times 5 \text{ times} = 15 \text{ flights}
     \]

2. **Flights Walked Down:**
   - Janice walks down 3 flights of stairs each time she leaves her office.
   - She does this 3 times in a day.
   - Therefore, the total number of flights she walks down is calculated as follows:
     \[
     \text{Flights walked down} = 3 \text{ flights} \times 3 \text{ times} = 9 \text{ flights}
     \]

3. **Total Flights Walked:**
   - To find the total number of flights of stairs Janice walks in a day, we add the flights she walks up and the flights she walks down:
     \[
     \text{Total flights walked} = \text{Flights walked up} + \text{Flights walked down} = 15 \text{ flights} + 9 \text{ flights} = 24 \text{ flights}
     \]

Therefore, Janice walks a total of 24 flights of stairs in a single day.

**Final Answer: 24 flights of stairs**
