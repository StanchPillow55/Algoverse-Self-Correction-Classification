==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to determine how many additional students join the campus by the end of May, given that the number of students doubles at the end of every month.

1. **Initial Number of Students**: At the beginning of the year (January 1), there are 10 students on campus.

2. **Doubling Process**: The number of students doubles at the end of each month. We will calculate the number of students at the end of each month from January to May.

   - **End of January**: 
     \[
     \text{Students at end of January} = 10 \times 2 = 20
     \]

   - **End of February**: 
     \[
     \text{Students at end of February} = 20 \times 2 = 40
     \]

   - **End of March**: 
     \[
     \text{Students at end of March} = 40 \times 2 = 80
     \]

   - **End of April**: 
     \[
     \text{Students at end of April} = 80 \times 2 = 160
     \]

   - **End of May**: 
     \[
     \text{Students at end of May} = 160 \times 2 = 320
     \]

3. **Calculating Additional Students**: Now we need to find out how many additional students have joined by the end of May compared to the initial number of students.

   - **Total Students at End of May**: 320
   - **Initial Students**: 10
   - **Additional Students**: 
     \[
     \text{Additional Students} = \text{Total Students at End of May} - \text{Initial Students} = 320 - 10 = 310
     \]

4. **Final Answer**: The number of additional students that have joined by the end of May, above and beyond the number of students already on campus at the beginning of the year, is \( \boxed{310} \).
