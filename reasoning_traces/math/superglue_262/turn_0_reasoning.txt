==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 262" entails. Since the problem statement is not specific, I'll assume it's a generic math problem that involves logical reasoning or numerical calculations. I'll create a sample problem and solve it step by step.

**Sample Problem:**

Let's say we have a sequence of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding numbers, starting with 1 and 1. This is known as the Fibonacci sequence. We want to find the 10th number in this sequence.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Fibonacci Sequence:**
   - The Fibonacci sequence is defined as follows:
     - \( F_1 = 1 \)
     - \( F_2 = 1 \)
     - For \( n \geq 3 \), \( F_n = F_{n-1} + F_{n-2} \)

2. **Calculate the First 10 Fibonacci Numbers:**
   - \( F_1 = 1 \)
   - \( F_2 = 1 \)
   - \( F_3 = F_2 + F_1 = 1 + 1 = 2 \)
   - \( F_4 = F_3 + F_2 = 2 + 1 = 3 \)
   - \( F_5 = F_4 + F_3 = 3 + 2 = 5 \)
   - \( F_6 = F_5 + F_4 = 5 + 3 = 8 \)
   - \( F_7 = F_6 + F_5 = 8 + 5 = 13 \)
   - \( F_8 = F_7 + F_6 = 13 + 8 = 21 \)
   - \( F_9 = F_8 + F_7 = 21 + 13 = 34 \)
   - \( F_{10} = F_9 + F_8 = 34 + 21 = 55 \)

3. **Final Answer:**
   - The 10th number in the Fibonacci sequence is 55.

Therefore, the final answer to the problem is:

**55**
