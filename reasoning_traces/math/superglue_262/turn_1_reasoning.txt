==================================================

To solve the problem effectively, let's first understand what "Sample reasoning question 262" might entail. Since the problem statement is not explicitly given, I'll create a hypothetical problem that involves reasoning and mathematics, and then solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**

A company produces two products, A and B. The production cost for product A is $50 per unit, and for product B, it is $70 per unit. The company has a budget of $7000 for production costs. Additionally, the company must produce at least 50 units of product A and at least 30 units of product B. The company wants to maximize the number of units produced within the budget. How many units of each product should the company produce?

**Solution:**

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( x \) be the number of units of product A.
   - Let \( y \) be the number of units of product B.

2. **Set Up the Inequalities:**
   - The cost constraint is given by:
     \[
     50x + 70y \leq 7000
     \]
   - The minimum production constraints are:
     \[
     x \geq 50
     \]
     \[
     y \geq 30
     \]

3. **Objective:**
   - Maximize the total number of units produced, which is \( x + y \).

4. **Graphical Solution:**
   - First, consider the cost constraint:
     \[
     50x + 70y = 7000
     \]
     - To find the intercepts, set \( x = 0 \):
       \[
       70y = 7000 \implies y = 100
       \]
     - Set \( y = 0 \):
       \[
       50x = 7000 \implies x = 140
       \]
     - The line intersects the axes at \( (0, 100) \) and \( (140, 0) \).

5. **Feasible Region:**
   - The feasible region is bounded by the lines \( x = 50 \), \( y = 30 \), and the line \( 50x + 70y = 7000 \).
   - We need to find the intersection of \( 50x + 70y = 7000 \) with \( x = 50 \) and \( y = 30 \).

6. **Intersection Points:**
   - Intersection with \( x = 50 \):
     \[
     50(50) + 70y = 7000 \implies 2500 + 70y = 7000 \implies 70y = 4500 \implies y = 64.29
     \]
     - So, one point is \( (50, 64.29) \).

   - Intersection with \( y = 30 \):
     \[
     50x + 70(30) = 7000 \implies 50x + 2100 = 7000 \implies 50x = 4900 \implies x = 98
     \]
     - So, another point is \( (98, 30) \).

7. **Vertices of the Feasible Region:**
   - The vertices are \( (50, 30) \), \( (50, 64.29) \), and \( (98, 30) \).

8. **Evaluate the Objective Function:**
   - At \( (50, 30) \): \( x + y = 50 + 30 = 80 \)
   - At \( (50, 64.29) \): \( x + y = 50 + 64.29 = 114.29 \)
   - At \( (98, 30) \): \( x + y = 98 + 30 = 128 \)

9. **Conclusion:**
   - The maximum number of units is 128 at the point \( (98, 30) \).

**Final Answer:**
The company should produce 98 units of product A and 30 units of product B to maximize the total number of units produced within the budget.
