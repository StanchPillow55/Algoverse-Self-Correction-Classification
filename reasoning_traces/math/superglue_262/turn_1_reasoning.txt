==================================================

To solve the problem effectively, let's first understand what is being asked. The problem statement is "Sample reasoning question 262," which is quite vague and does not provide specific details or numbers to work with. However, since the instruction is "devils_advocate_v1," let's assume this is a prompt to engage in a reasoning exercise where we critically analyze a hypothetical situation or problem.

Given the lack of specific details, let's create a hypothetical math problem and solve it step by step. Suppose we have the following problem:

**Problem:** A company produces two types of widgets: Type A and Type B. The company sells Type A widgets for $50 each and Type B widgets for $70 each. Last month, the company sold a total of 262 widgets and made a total revenue of $15,000. How many of each type of widget did the company sell?

**Step 1: Define Variables**

Let \( x \) be the number of Type A widgets sold.
Let \( y \) be the number of Type B widgets sold.

**Step 2: Set Up Equations**

We have two pieces of information that can be translated into equations:

1. The total number of widgets sold is 262:
   \[
   x + y = 262
   \]

2. The total revenue from selling the widgets is $15,000:
   \[
   50x + 70y = 15,000
   \]

**Step 3: Solve the System of Equations**

We have the following system of equations:
\[
\begin{align*}
x + y &= 262 \\
50x + 70y &= 15,000
\end{align*}
\]

First, solve the first equation for \( y \):
\[
y = 262 - x
\]

Substitute \( y = 262 - x \) into the second equation:
\[
50x + 70(262 - x) = 15,000
\]

Distribute the 70:
\[
50x + 70 \times 262 - 70x = 15,000
\]

Calculate \( 70 \times 262 \):
\[
70 \times 262 = 18,340
\]

Substitute back into the equation:
\[
50x + 18,340 - 70x = 15,000
\]

Combine like terms:
\[
-20x + 18,340 = 15,000
\]

Subtract 18,340 from both sides:
\[
-20x = 15,000 - 18,340
\]

Calculate the right side:
\[
-20x = -3,340
\]

Divide both sides by -20 to solve for \( x \):
\[
x = \frac{-3,340}{-20} = 167
\]

Now, substitute \( x = 167 \) back into the equation for \( y \):
\[
y = 262 - 167 = 95
\]

**Step 4: Verify the Solution**

Check the total revenue:
\[
50 \times 167 + 70 \times 95 = 8,350 + 6,650 = 15,000
\]

The calculations are correct, and the solution satisfies both equations.

**Final Answer:**

The company sold 167 Type A widgets and 95 Type B widgets.
