==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand the context and details provided in the question. However, it seems that the question "Sample reasoning question 262" does not provide any specific mathematical problem or context to work with. Therefore, I will demonstrate how to approach a typical math problem by creating a sample problem and solving it step by step.

### Sample Problem:
Let's consider a problem involving basic algebra:

**Problem:**  
Solve for \( x \) in the equation:  
\[ 3x + 5 = 20 \]

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Understand the Equation:**
   The equation given is \( 3x + 5 = 20 \). Our goal is to solve for \( x \), which means we need to isolate \( x \) on one side of the equation.

2. **Isolate the Term with \( x \):**
   To isolate the term with \( x \), we need to eliminate the constant term on the left side of the equation. We do this by subtracting 5 from both sides of the equation:
   \[
   3x + 5 - 5 = 20 - 5
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   3x = 15
   \]

3. **Solve for \( x \):**
   Now, we need to solve for \( x \) by getting rid of the coefficient of \( x \), which is 3. We do this by dividing both sides of the equation by 3:
   \[
   \frac{3x}{3} = \frac{15}{3}
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   x = 5
   \]

4. **Verify the Solution:**
   To ensure our solution is correct, we substitute \( x = 5 \) back into the original equation:
   \[
   3(5) + 5 = 20
   \]
   Simplifying the left side gives:
   \[
   15 + 5 = 20
   \]
   \[
   20 = 20
   \]
   Since both sides of the equation are equal, our solution is verified.

### Final Answer:
The solution to the equation \( 3x + 5 = 20 \) is \( x = 5 \).

This step-by-step approach can be applied to a variety of algebraic problems to find the solution systematically. If you have a specific problem or context in mind, please provide more details, and I would be happy to assist further!
