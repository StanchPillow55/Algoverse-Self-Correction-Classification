Question ID: 876
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To determine Amy's total score on her history test, we will calculate the points she earns from each type of question separately and then sum them up.

1. **Multiple-Choice Questions:**
   - Total multiple-choice questions = 10
   - Percentage answered correctly = 80%
   - Points per correct answer = 1 point

   First, we calculate the number of correct answers:
   \[
   \text{Correct answers} = 10 \times 0.80 = 8
   \]
   Now, we calculate the points earned from multiple-choice questions:
   \[
   \text{Points from multiple-choice} = 8 \times 1 = 8 \text{ points}
   \]

2. **True/False Questions:**
   - Total true/false questions = 20
   - Percentage answered correctly = 90%
   - Points per correct answer = 1 point

   Next, we calculate the number of correct answers:
   \[
   \text{Correct answers} = 20 \times 0.90 = 18
   \]
   Now, we calculate the points earned from true/false questions:
   \[
   \text{Points from true/false} = 18 \times 1 = 18 \text{ points}
   \]

3. **Long-Answer Questions:**
   - Total long-answer questions = 5
   - Percentage answered correctly = 60%
   - Points per correct answer = 5 points

   Now, we calculate the number of correct answers:
   \[
   \text{Correct answers} = 5 \times 0.60 = 3
   \]
   Now, we calculate the points earned from long-answer questions:
   \[
   \text{Points from long-answer} = 3 \times 5 = 15 \text{ points}
   \]

4. **Total Score:**
   Now we sum the points from all types of questions:
   \[
   \text{Total score} = \text{Points from multiple-choice} + \text{Points from true/false} + \text{Points from long-answer}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total score} = 8 + 18 + 15 = 41 \text{ points}
   \]

Thus, Amy scores a total of **41 points** on her history test.
