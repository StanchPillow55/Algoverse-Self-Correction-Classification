Question ID: 876
Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To find out how many points Amy scores on her history test, we will break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate the points from multiple-choice questions:**
   - Total multiple-choice questions = 10
   - Percentage of questions answered correctly = 80%
   - Number of questions answered correctly = \( 10 \times 0.80 = 8 \)
   - Points per correct answer = 1 point
   - Total points from multiple-choice questions = \( 8 \times 1 = 8 \) points

2. **Calculate the points from true/false questions:**
   - Total true/false questions = 20
   - Percentage of questions answered correctly = 90%
   - Number of questions answered correctly = \( 20 \times 0.90 = 18 \)
   - Points per correct answer = 1 point
   - Total points from true/false questions = \( 18 \times 1 = 18 \) points

3. **Calculate the points from long-answer questions:**
   - Total long-answer questions = 5
   - Percentage of questions answered correctly = 60%
   - Number of questions answered correctly = \( 5 \times 0.60 = 3 \)
   - Points per correct answer = 5 points
   - Total points from long-answer questions = \( 3 \times 5 = 15 \) points

4. **Calculate the total score:**
   - Total score = Points from multiple-choice + Points from true/false + Points from long-answer
   - Total score = \( 8 + 18 + 15 = 41 \) points

Thus, Amy scores a total of **41 points** on her history test.
