Question ID: 876
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To find out how many points Amy scores on her history test, we need to calculate her scores for each type of question separately and then sum them up. 

### Step 1: Calculate the score for multiple-choice questions

- **Total multiple-choice questions**: 10
- **Percentage answered correctly**: 80%

To find the number of questions Amy answered correctly, we calculate:
\[
\text{Correct answers} = \text{Total questions} \times \text{Percentage correct}
\]
\[
\text{Correct answers} = 10 \times 0.80 = 8
\]

Since each multiple-choice question is worth 1 point, her score from multiple-choice questions is:
\[
\text{Score from multiple-choice} = \text{Correct answers} \times \text{Points per question}
\]
\[
\text{Score from multiple-choice} = 8 \times 1 = 8 \text{ points}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the score for true/false questions

- **Total true/false questions**: 20
- **Percentage answered correctly**: 90%

Calculating the number of questions answered correctly:
\[
\text{Correct answers} = 20 \times 0.90 = 18
\]

Since each true/false question is also worth 1 point, her score from true/false questions is:
\[
\text{Score from true/false} = 18 \times 1 = 18 \text{ points}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the score for long-answer questions

- **Total long-answer questions**: 5
- **Percentage answered correctly**: 60%

Calculating the number of questions answered correctly:
\[
\text{Correct answers} = 5 \times 0.60 = 3
\]

Each long-answer question is worth 5 points, so her score from long-answer questions is:
\[
\text{Score from long-answer} = 3 \times 5 = 15 \text{ points}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the total score

Now, we sum up the scores from all types of questions:
\[
\text{Total score} = \text{Score from multiple-choice} + \text{Score from true/false} + \text{Score from long-answer}
\]
\[
\text{Total score} = 8 + 18 + 15 = 41 \text{ points}
\]

### Final Answer

Amy scores a total of **41 points** on her history test.
