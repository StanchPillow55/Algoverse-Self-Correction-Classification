==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 169" entails. Since the problem statement is not specific, I'll assume it's a generic math problem and provide a structured approach to solving a typical math problem. Let's assume this is a word problem involving basic arithmetic or algebra.

### Step 1: Understand the Problem
Let's assume the problem is as follows:

"A farmer has 169 apples. He wants to distribute them equally among his 13 friends. How many apples will each friend receive?"

### Step 2: Identify What is Being Asked
We need to determine how many apples each friend will receive if the apples are distributed equally.

### Step 3: Determine the Method to Solve the Problem
Since we need to distribute 169 apples equally among 13 friends, we will use division to solve this problem.

### Step 4: Perform the Calculation
We need to divide the total number of apples by the number of friends:

\[ \text{Number of apples each friend receives} = \frac{169}{13} \]

### Step 5: Execute the Calculation
Let's perform the division:

1. Divide 169 by 13.
2. 13 goes into 16 once (since 13 x 1 = 13).
3. Subtract 13 from 16 to get 3.
4. Bring down the next digit, 9, to make it 39.
5. 13 goes into 39 three times (since 13 x 3 = 39).
6. Subtract 39 from 39 to get 0.

Thus, the division is exact, and each friend receives 13 apples.

### Step 6: Verify the Solution
To ensure the solution is correct, multiply the number of apples each friend receives by the number of friends:

\[ 13 \times 13 = 169 \]

The product is equal to the original number of apples, confirming the solution is correct.

### Step 7: State the Final Answer
Each friend will receive 13 apples.

Therefore, the final answer is:

**13 apples per friend.**
