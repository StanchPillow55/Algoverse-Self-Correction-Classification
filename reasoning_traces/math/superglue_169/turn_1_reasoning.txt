==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 169" refers to. Since the question itself is not provided, I will demonstrate a general approach to solving a typical math problem by breaking it down into steps. Let's assume a hypothetical math problem and solve it step-by-step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**
Calculate the value of \( x \) in the equation \( 3x + 5 = 20 \).

**Step 1: Understand the Problem**
The equation given is a linear equation in one variable, \( x \). Our goal is to isolate \( x \) on one side of the equation to find its value.

**Step 2: Simplify the Equation**
The equation is \( 3x + 5 = 20 \). We need to isolate \( x \).

**Step 3: Solve for \( x \)**
1. Subtract 5 from both sides of the equation to get rid of the constant term on the left side:
   \[
   3x + 5 - 5 = 20 - 5
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   3x = 15
   \]

2. Divide both sides by 3 to solve for \( x \):
   \[
   \frac{3x}{3} = \frac{15}{3}
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   x = 5
   \]

**Step 4: Verify the Solution**
Substitute \( x = 5 \) back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies the equation:
\[
3(5) + 5 = 20
\]
\[
15 + 5 = 20
\]
\[
20 = 20
\]
The left side equals the right side, confirming that our solution is correct.

**Final Answer:**
The value of \( x \) is 5.

This approach demonstrates a structured way to solve a linear equation. If you have a specific problem or need further assistance, please provide more details or clarify the question.
