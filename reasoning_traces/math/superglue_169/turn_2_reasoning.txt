Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem effectively, I need more specific information about "Sample reasoning question 169." However, since the problem is not provided, I'll demonstrate a general approach to solving a typical math problem by working through an example. Let's assume a sample problem:

**Example Problem:**

A farmer has a rectangular field that is 100 meters long and 60 meters wide. He wants to build a fence around the field and also divide the field into two equal parts with a fence parallel to the shorter side. Calculate the total length of the fence required.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We have a rectangular field with dimensions 100 meters (length) and 60 meters (width).
   - We need to calculate the total length of the fence required to enclose the field and divide it into two equal parts.

2. **Calculate the Perimeter of the Field:**
   - The perimeter \( P \) of a rectangle is given by the formula:
     \[
     P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width})
     \]
   - Substituting the given values:
     \[
     P = 2 \times (100 + 60) = 2 \times 160 = 320 \text{ meters}
     \]

3. **Divide the Field into Two Equal Parts:**
   - The field is divided into two equal parts with a fence parallel to the shorter side (width).
   - This means we need an additional fence equal to the length of the field (100 meters).

4. **Calculate the Total Length of the Fence:**
   - Total length of the fence required is the perimeter plus the additional dividing fence:
     \[
     \text{Total Fence Length} = 320 + 100 = 420 \text{ meters}
     \]

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The total length of the fence required is 420 meters.

**Final Answer:**
The total length of the fence required is 420 meters.

This example demonstrates the process of understanding the problem, applying relevant formulas, performing calculations, and arriving at the final answer. If you have a specific problem or question number 169, please provide the details, and I'll be happy to solve it for you.
