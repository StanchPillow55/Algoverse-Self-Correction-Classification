Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to determine what percentage of the shark's body length is represented by the combined length of the remoras.

### Step 1: Convert all measurements to the same unit
The shark's length is given in feet, and the remoras' lengths are given in inches. To make calculations easier, we will convert the shark's length from feet to inches.

1 foot = 12 inches

So, the length of the shark in inches is:
\[
10 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 120 \text{ inches}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the combined length of the remoras
Each remora is 6 inches long, and there are 2 remoras. Therefore, the combined length of the remoras is:
\[
2 \times 6 \text{ inches} = 12 \text{ inches}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the percentage of the shark's length that the remoras represent
To find the percentage, we use the formula:
\[
\text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Part}}{\text{Whole}} \right) \times 100
\]
In this case, the "Part" is the combined length of the remoras (12 inches), and the "Whole" is the length of the shark (120 inches).

Substituting the values into the formula gives:
\[
\text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{12 \text{ inches}}{120 \text{ inches}} \right) \times 100
\]

### Step 4: Perform the calculation
First, calculate the fraction:
\[
\frac{12}{120} = 0.1
\]

Now, multiply by 100 to convert to a percentage:
\[
0.1 \times 100 = 10\%
\]

### Final Answer
The combined length of the remoras is 10% of the shark's body length. Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{10\%}
\]
