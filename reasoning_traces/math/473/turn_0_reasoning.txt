To solve this problem, we need to determine how much money James owns, given that together James and Ali own $250, and James owns $40 more than Ali.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( A \) represent the amount of money Ali owns.
   - Since James owns $40 more than Ali, we can express the amount James owns as \( A + 40 \).

2. **Set Up the Equation:**
   - According to the problem, the total amount of money James and Ali own together is $250. Therefore, we can write the equation:
     \[
     A + (A + 40) = 250
     \]

3. **Simplify the Equation:**
   - Combine like terms:
     \[
     2A + 40 = 250
     \]

4. **Solve for \( A \):**
   - Subtract 40 from both sides of the equation to isolate the terms involving \( A \):
     \[
     2A = 250 - 40
     \]
     \[
     2A = 210
     \]

   - Divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( A \):
     \[
     A = \frac{210}{2}
     \]
     \[
     A = 105
     \]

5. **Calculate the Amount James Owns:**
   - Since James owns $40 more than Ali, we calculate the amount James owns by adding $40 to Ali's amount:
     \[
     A + 40 = 105 + 40 = 145
     \]

6. **Verify the Solution:**
   - Check that the total amount owned by James and Ali is $250:
     \[
     105 + 145 = 250
     \]
   - The calculation is correct, confirming our solution.

Therefore, the amount owned by James is \(\boxed{145}\).
