==================================================

To find the percentage of the shark's body length that is represented by the combined length of the remoras, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Convert the lengths to the same unit**: 
   - The shark's length is given as 10 feet. 
   - The remoras' lengths are given as 6 inches each.

   First, we convert the shark's length from feet to inches since the remoras' lengths are in inches. There are 12 inches in a foot, so:
   \[
   10 \text{ feet} = 10 \times 12 \text{ inches} = 120 \text{ inches}
   \]

2. **Calculate the combined length of the remoras**:
   - Each remora is 6 inches long, and there are 2 remoras.
   \[
   \text{Combined length of remoras} = 2 \times 6 \text{ inches} = 12 \text{ inches}
   \]

3. **Calculate the percentage of the shark's length that the remoras represent**:
   - To find the percentage, we use the formula:
   \[
   \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Part}}{\text{Whole}} \right) \times 100
   \]
   Here, the "Part" is the combined length of the remoras (12 inches), and the "Whole" is the length of the shark (120 inches).
   \[
   \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{12 \text{ inches}}{120 \text{ inches}} \right) \times 100
   \]

4. **Perform the calculation**:
   \[
   \frac{12}{120} = 0.1
   \]
   Now, multiply by 100 to convert to a percentage:
   \[
   0.1 \times 100 = 10\%
   \]

Thus, the combined length of the remoras is 10% of the shark's body length.

**Final Answer**: 10%
