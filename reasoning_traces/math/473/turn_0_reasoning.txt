==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to set up equations based on the information given.

1. **Define the variables**:
   - Let \( A \) be the amount of money Ali owns.
   - Let \( J \) be the amount of money James owns.

2. **Set up the equations**:
   - From the problem, we know that together they own $250:
     \[
     J + A = 250
     \]
   - We also know that James owns $40 more than Ali:
     \[
     J = A + 40
     \]

3. **Substitute the second equation into the first**:
   - We can substitute \( J \) from the second equation into the first equation:
     \[
     (A + 40) + A = 250
     \]

4. **Combine like terms**:
   - This simplifies to:
     \[
     2A + 40 = 250
     \]

5. **Isolate the variable \( A \)**:
   - Subtract 40 from both sides:
     \[
     2A = 250 - 40
     \]
     \[
     2A = 210
     \]
   - Now, divide both sides by 2:
     \[
     A = \frac{210}{2} = 105
     \]

6. **Calculate \( J \)**:
   - Now that we have \( A \), we can find \( J \) using the equation \( J = A + 40 \):
     \[
     J = 105 + 40 = 145
     \]

7. **Final answer**:
   - Therefore, the amount owned by James is:
     \[
     \boxed{145}
     \] 

To summarize, James owns $145 and Ali owns $105, which together add up to $250, confirming our calculations are correct.
