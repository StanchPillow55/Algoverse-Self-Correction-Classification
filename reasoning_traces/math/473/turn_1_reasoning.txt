==================================================

To find the percentage of the shark's body length that is represented by the combined length of the remoras, we will follow these steps:

1. **Convert the lengths to the same unit**: 
   - The shark's length is given as 10 feet. 
   - The remoras' lengths are given as 6 inches each.

   First, we need to convert the shark's length from feet to inches since the remoras' lengths are in inches. We know that:
   \[
   1 \text{ foot} = 12 \text{ inches}
   \]
   Therefore, the length of the shark in inches is:
   \[
   10 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 120 \text{ inches}
   \]

2. **Calculate the combined length of the remoras**:
   - Each remora is 6 inches long, and there are 2 remoras. Thus, the combined length of the remoras is:
   \[
   2 \times 6 \text{ inches} = 12 \text{ inches}
   \]

3. **Calculate the percentage of the shark's length that the remoras represent**:
   - To find the percentage, we use the formula:
   \[
   \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Part}}{\text{Whole}} \right) \times 100
   \]
   Here, the "Part" is the combined length of the remoras (12 inches), and the "Whole" is the length of the shark (120 inches). Plugging in the values:
   \[
   \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{12 \text{ inches}}{120 \text{ inches}} \right) \times 100
   \]

4. **Perform the calculation**:
   - First, calculate the fraction:
   \[
   \frac{12}{120} = 0.1
   \]
   - Now, multiply by 100 to convert to a percentage:
   \[
   0.1 \times 100 = 10\%
   \]

Thus, the combined length of the remoras is **10%** of the shark's body length.

**Final Answer**: 10%
