==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine how much money James owns, given that together James and Ali own $250, and James owns $40 more than Ali.

Let's define the variables:
- Let \( A \) represent the amount of money Ali owns.
- Since James owns $40 more than Ali, we can express the amount James owns as \( A + 40 \).

According to the problem, the total amount of money they own together is $250. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[
A + (A + 40) = 250
\]

Simplify the equation:

\[
2A + 40 = 250
\]

To isolate \( A \), subtract 40 from both sides:

\[
2A = 250 - 40
\]

\[
2A = 210
\]

Next, divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( A \):

\[
A = \frac{210}{2}
\]

\[
A = 105
\]

Now that we know Ali owns $105, we can find out how much James owns by adding $40 to Ali's amount:

\[
A + 40 = 105 + 40 = 145
\]

Therefore, James owns $145.

Final Answer:
James owns $145.
