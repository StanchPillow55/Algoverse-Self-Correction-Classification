Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To determine the number of pages in the book, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Understand the thickness of the book in relation to the number of pages**: The problem states that the book is 1.5 inches thick and that there are 100 pages per inch.

2. **Calculate the total number of pages based on the thickness**: Since the book is 1.5 inches thick and there are 100 pages per inch, we can calculate the total number of pages as follows:

   \[
   \text{Total pages} = \text{Thickness in inches} \times \text{Pages per inch}
   \]

   Plugging in the values:

   \[
   \text{Total pages} = 1.5 \, \text{inches} \times 100 \, \text{pages/inch}
   \]

   Now, performing the multiplication:

   \[
   \text{Total pages} = 150 \, \text{pages}
   \]

3. **Consider the printing on both sides**: Each sheet of paper has two pages printed on it (one on each side). However, since we are already calculating the total number of pages directly based on thickness and pages per inch, we do not need to adjust for the double-sided printing in this case. The calculation of 150 pages already accounts for the fact that each page is printed on both sides.

4. **Final answer**: Therefore, the total number of pages in the book is:

   \[
   \boxed{150}
   \]
