Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To find the total number of pages in the book, we need to use the information given about the thickness of the book and the number of pages per inch.

1. **Understanding the thickness of the book**: 
   The book is 1.5 inches thick.

2. **Understanding the pages per inch**: 
   We know that there are 100 pages per inch.

3. **Calculating the total number of pages**:
   To find the total number of pages in the book, we can multiply the thickness of the book (in inches) by the number of pages per inch.

   \[
   \text{Total pages} = \text{Thickness (in inches)} \times \text{Pages per inch}
   \]

   Substituting the values we have:

   \[
   \text{Total pages} = 1.5 \, \text{inches} \times 100 \, \text{pages/inch}
   \]

   Now, we perform the multiplication:

   \[
   \text{Total pages} = 1.5 \times 100 = 150
   \]

4. **Final Answer**:
   The total number of pages in the book is **150 pages**. 

Thus, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{150}
\]
