==================================================

To determine how many pages are in the book, we need to consider the thickness of the book and how many pages can fit in that thickness based on the given information.

1. **Understanding the thickness and pages per inch**:
   - We know that the book is 1.5 inches thick.
   - The paper is printed such that there are 100 pages per inch.

2. **Calculating the total number of pages**:
   - Since there are 100 pages in one inch, we can calculate the total number of pages in 1.5 inches by multiplying the number of pages per inch by the thickness of the book in inches:
   \[
   \text{Total pages} = \text{Pages per inch} \times \text{Thickness in inches}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total pages} = 100 \, \text{pages/inch} \times 1.5 \, \text{inches}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total pages} = 150 \, \text{pages}
   \]

3. **Conclusion**:
   - The book has a total of 150 pages.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{150}
\]
