To determine how many days 720 grams of cat food will last for Imma's 3 cats, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total amount of cat food consumed per day**: 
   Imma feeds her cats twice a day with a total of 60 grams of cat food each time. Therefore, the daily consumption of cat food is calculated as follows:

   \[
   \text{Daily consumption} = \text{Amount per feeding} \times \text{Number of feedings per day}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Daily consumption} = 60 \text{ grams} \times 2 = 120 \text{ grams}
   \]

2. **Determine how many days the total cat food will last**:
   Now that we know the daily consumption, we can find out how many days 720 grams of cat food will last by dividing the total amount of cat food by the daily consumption:

   \[
   \text{Number of days} = \frac{\text{Total cat food}}{\text{Daily consumption}}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Number of days} = \frac{720 \text{ grams}}{120 \text{ grams/day}} = 6 \text{ days}
   \]

Thus, the final answer is that 720 grams of cat food will last for **6 days**.
