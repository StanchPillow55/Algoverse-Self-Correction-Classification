Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To determine how many days 720 grams of cat food will last for Imma's 3 cats, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total daily food consumption for the cats**:
   - Imma feeds her cats twice a day with a total of 60 grams of cat food each time.
   - Therefore, the total daily food consumption is:
     \[
     \text{Daily food consumption} = 60 \text{ grams} \times 2 = 120 \text{ grams}
     \]

2. **Determine how many days the 720 grams of cat food will last**:
   - We need to divide the total amount of cat food (720 grams) by the daily food consumption (120 grams):
     \[
     \text{Number of days} = \frac{720 \text{ grams}}{120 \text{ grams/day}} = 6 \text{ days}
     \]

Thus, the 720 grams of cat food will last for **6 days**.

Final answer: **6 days**.
