==================================================

To solve a math problem, we need to first understand what the problem is asking us to do. However, the phrase "Sample math problem 457" does not provide specific details about the problem itself. It seems like a placeholder or reference to a specific problem in a textbook or a database.

Since there is no specific math problem provided, I will demonstrate how to solve a typical math problem by creating an example problem and solving it step by step.

### Example Math Problem:
**Problem:** Solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 3x + 5 = 20 \).

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Understand the Equation:**
   The equation given is \( 3x + 5 = 20 \). This is a linear equation in one variable, \( x \).

2. **Isolate the Variable:**
   To solve for \( x \), we need to isolate \( x \) on one side of the equation. We can do this by performing inverse operations.

3. **Subtract 5 from Both Sides:**
   To eliminate the constant term on the left side, subtract 5 from both sides of the equation:
   \[
   3x + 5 - 5 = 20 - 5
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   3x = 15
   \]

4. **Divide by 3:**
   Now, divide both sides by 3 to solve for \( x \):
   \[
   \frac{3x}{3} = \frac{15}{3}
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   x = 5
   \]

5. **Verify the Solution:**
   Substitute \( x = 5 \) back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies the equation:
   \[
   3(5) + 5 = 20
   \]
   Simplifying the left side gives:
   \[
   15 + 5 = 20
   \]
   \[
   20 = 20
   \]
   Since both sides of the equation are equal, our solution \( x = 5 \) is correct.

### Final Answer:
The solution to the equation \( 3x + 5 = 20 \) is \( x = 5 \).

If you have a specific math problem in mind, please provide the details, and I will be happy to solve it for you.
