Question ID: mathbench_457
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we first need to understand what "Sample math problem 457" refers to. Since the problem is not explicitly stated, let's assume it involves a typical math problem that could be labeled as "457". For the sake of this exercise, let's create a hypothetical math problem that we can solve step by step.

Let's assume "Sample math problem 457" is the following:

**Problem:**  
Calculate the sum of all integers from 1 to 457.

To solve this problem, we can use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series. The sum \( S \) of the first \( n \) integers is given by the formula:

\[
S = \frac{n(n + 1)}{2}
\]

In this case, \( n = 457 \).

**Step-by-step Solution:**

1. **Identify the formula:**  
   We will use the formula for the sum of the first \( n \) integers:  
   \[
   S = \frac{n(n + 1)}{2}
   \]

2. **Substitute the value of \( n \):**  
   Here, \( n = 457 \). Substitute this into the formula:  
   \[
   S = \frac{457(457 + 1)}{2}
   \]

3. **Calculate \( 457 + 1 \):**  
   \[
   457 + 1 = 458
   \]

4. **Calculate the product \( 457 \times 458 \):**  
   To find this product, we can use the standard multiplication method:  
   \[
   457 \times 458 = 209,206
   \]

5. **Divide the product by 2:**  
   \[
   S = \frac{209,206}{2} = 104,603
   \]

Thus, the sum of all integers from 1 to 457 is 104,603.

**Final Answer:**  
The sum of all integers from 1 to 457 is 104,603.
