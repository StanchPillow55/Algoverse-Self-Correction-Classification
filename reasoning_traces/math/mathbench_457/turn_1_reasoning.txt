Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 457," we need to first understand what the problem entails. Since the problem statement is not provided, let's assume that "Sample math problem 457" refers to a specific math problem that needs solving. Without the actual problem, I will demonstrate a general approach to solving math problems and provide an example solution.

### General Approach to Solving Math Problems

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - Read the problem carefully.
   - Identify what is being asked.
   - Determine what information is given.

2. **Devise a Plan:**
   - Consider possible strategies to solve the problem (e.g., algebraic manipulation, drawing a diagram, logical reasoning).
   - Choose the most appropriate strategy based on the problem type.

3. **Carry Out the Plan:**
   - Execute the chosen strategy step by step.
   - Perform calculations carefully.
   - Keep track of units and ensure consistency.

4. **Check Your Work:**
   - Review each step to ensure accuracy.
   - Verify that the solution answers the question posed.
   - Consider alternative methods to confirm the result.

### Example Problem and Solution

Let's assume "Sample math problem 457" is the following:

**Problem:**
Solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 3x + 5 = 20 \).

**Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We need to find the value of \( x \) that satisfies the equation \( 3x + 5 = 20 \).

2. **Devise a Plan:**
   - We can solve for \( x \) by isolating it on one side of the equation using algebraic manipulation.

3. **Carry Out the Plan:**
   - Start with the equation: \( 3x + 5 = 20 \).
   - Subtract 5 from both sides to isolate the term with \( x \):
     \[
     3x + 5 - 5 = 20 - 5
     \]
     \[
     3x = 15
     \]
   - Divide both sides by 3 to solve for \( x \):
     \[
     \frac{3x}{3} = \frac{15}{3}
     \]
     \[
     x = 5
     \]

4. **Check Your Work:**
   - Substitute \( x = 5 \) back into the original equation to verify:
     \[
     3(5) + 5 = 20
     \]
     \[
     15 + 5 = 20
     \]
     \[
     20 = 20
     \]
   - The solution is verified as correct.

**Final Answer:**
The solution to the equation \( 3x + 5 = 20 \) is \( x = 5 \).

This example demonstrates a structured approach to solving a simple algebraic equation. If you have a specific problem labeled "Sample math problem 457," please provide the details, and I will be happy to solve it using a similar approach.
