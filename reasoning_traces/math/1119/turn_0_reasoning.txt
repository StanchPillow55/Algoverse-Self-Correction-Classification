==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to determine the time each person took to complete their chores and then sum these times to find the total time they all spent on their chores.

1. **Amalia's Time:**
   - Amalia mowed the lawn, which took her 4 hours.
   \[
   \text{Time taken by Amalia} = 4 \text{ hours}
   \]

2. **Megan's Time:**
   - Megan walked the dog, and her task took 2 hours longer than Amalia's task.
   \[
   \text{Time taken by Megan} = \text{Time taken by Amalia} + 2 \text{ hours}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Time taken by Megan} = 4 \text{ hours} + 2 \text{ hours} = 6 \text{ hours}
   \]

3. **Dior's Time:**
   - Dior did the laundry, and her task took well over 4 hours longer than the time Amalia took to mow the lawn. Since "well over" is not a specific number, we will interpret it as at least 4 hours longer.
   \[
   \text{Time taken by Dior} = \text{Time taken by Amalia} + 4 \text{ hours}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Time taken by Dior} = 4 \text{ hours} + 4 \text{ hours} = 8 \text{ hours}
   \]

4. **Total Time Calculation:**
   - Now, we sum the time taken by each person to find the total time spent on chores.
   \[
   \text{Total time} = \text{Time taken by Amalia} + \text{Time taken by Megan} + \text{Time taken by Dior}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total time} = 4 \text{ hours} + 6 \text{ hours} + 8 \text{ hours}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total time} = 18 \text{ hours}
   \]

Thus, the total time they all took to do their chores altogether is **18 hours**. 

Final answer:
\[
\boxed{18 \text{ hours}}
\]
