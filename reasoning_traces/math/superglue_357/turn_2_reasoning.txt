Question ID: superglue_357
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, I need more specific information about "Sample reasoning question 357" as it is not clear what the problem entails. However, I can guide you through a general approach to solving math problems by using a structured reasoning process. Let's assume this is a typical math problem-solving scenario:

### Step 1: Understand the Problem
- **Read the problem carefully**: Ensure you understand what is being asked. Identify the key information given and what you need to find.
- **Identify knowns and unknowns**: List out what information is provided and what you need to solve for.

### Step 2: Devise a Plan
- **Choose a strategy**: Depending on the type of problem, decide on a method to solve it. Common strategies include:
  - Algebraic manipulation
  - Drawing a diagram
  - Logical reasoning
  - Trial and error
  - Using formulas

### Step 3: Carry Out the Plan
- **Execute your chosen strategy**: Perform calculations or logical steps as needed.
- **Show all work**: Write down each step clearly to avoid mistakes and to make it easy to review.

### Step 4: Review/Check Your Work
- **Verify your solution**: Check if your answer makes sense in the context of the problem.
- **Recalculate if necessary**: If something seems off, go through your steps again to find any errors.

### Example Problem
Since I don't have the specifics of "Sample reasoning question 357," let's consider a simple example problem:

**Example Problem**: Solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).

#### Step 1: Understand the Problem
- We need to find the value of \( x \) that satisfies the equation.

#### Step 2: Devise a Plan
- Use algebraic manipulation to isolate \( x \).

#### Step 3: Carry Out the Plan
1. Start with the equation: \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).
2. Subtract 3 from both sides to isolate the term with \( x \):
   \[
   2x + 3 - 3 = 11 - 3 \implies 2x = 8
   \]
3. Divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( x \):
   \[
   \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{8}{2} \implies x = 4
   \]

#### Step 4: Review/Check Your Work
- Substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation to verify:
  \[
  2(4) + 3 = 8 + 3 = 11
  \]
- The left side equals the right side, confirming that \( x = 4 \) is correct.

### Final Answer
The solution to the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \) is \( x = 4 \).

If you provide the specific details of "Sample reasoning question 357," I can apply this structured approach to solve it.
