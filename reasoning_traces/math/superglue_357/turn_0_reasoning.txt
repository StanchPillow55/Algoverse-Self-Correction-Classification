To solve the problem, we need to understand what "Sample reasoning question 357" entails. Since the problem statement is not specific, I'll assume it's a generic math problem that requires logical reasoning and problem-solving skills. Let's create a hypothetical problem and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**

A company produces widgets. The production cost for each widget is $5, and the company sells each widget for $12. The company has fixed costs of $700 per month. How many widgets must the company sell in a month to break even?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - Fixed Costs: $700 per month
   - Variable Cost per Widget: $5
   - Selling Price per Widget: $12
   - Break-even Point: The point at which total revenue equals total costs (fixed + variable).

2. **Define the Variables:**
   - Let \( x \) be the number of widgets sold.

3. **Set Up the Equation:**
   - Total Cost = Fixed Costs + Variable Costs
   - Total Cost = $700 + $5x
   - Total Revenue = Selling Price per Widget \(\times\) Number of Widgets Sold
   - Total Revenue = $12x

4. **Break-even Condition:**
   - At the break-even point, Total Revenue = Total Cost.
   - Therefore, $12x = $700 + $5x

5. **Solve the Equation:**
   - Subtract $5x from both sides to isolate terms involving \( x \):
     \[
     12x - 5x = 700
     \]
   - Simplify the equation:
     \[
     7x = 700
     \]
   - Divide both sides by 7 to solve for \( x \):
     \[
     x = \frac{700}{7} = 100
     \]

6. **Interpret the Solution:**
   - The company must sell 100 widgets in a month to break even.

7. **Verify the Solution:**
   - Calculate the total cost when 100 widgets are sold:
     \[
     \text{Total Cost} = 700 + 5 \times 100 = 700 + 500 = 1200
     \]
   - Calculate the total revenue when 100 widgets are sold:
     \[
     \text{Total Revenue} = 12 \times 100 = 1200
     \]
   - Since Total Revenue equals Total Cost, the solution is verified.

**Final Answer:**
The company must sell 100 widgets in a month to break even.
