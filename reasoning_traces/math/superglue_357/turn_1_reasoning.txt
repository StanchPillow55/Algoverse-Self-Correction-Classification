Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 357" refers to. Since the question itself is not explicitly stated, let's assume a hypothetical math problem that could be labeled as "Sample reasoning question 357." 

Let's assume the problem is as follows:

**Problem:**
A company produces 357 widgets every day. Each widget requires 3 parts to assemble. If each part costs $2, how much does the company spend on parts each day?

**Solution:**

1. **Identify the number of widgets produced daily:**
   - The company produces 357 widgets every day.

2. **Determine the number of parts needed per widget:**
   - Each widget requires 3 parts.

3. **Calculate the total number of parts needed daily:**
   - Since each widget requires 3 parts, for 357 widgets, the total number of parts needed is:
     \[
     357 \text{ widgets} \times 3 \text{ parts/widget} = 1071 \text{ parts}
     \]

4. **Determine the cost per part:**
   - Each part costs $2.

5. **Calculate the total cost for parts each day:**
   - The total cost for 1071 parts, with each part costing $2, is:
     \[
     1071 \text{ parts} \times 2 \text{ dollars/part} = 2142 \text{ dollars}
     \]

6. **Conclusion:**
   - The company spends $2142 on parts each day.

**Final Answer:**
The company spends $2142 on parts each day.
