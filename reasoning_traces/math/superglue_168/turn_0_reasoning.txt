==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 168" entails. Since the question is not explicitly provided, I'll demonstrate how to approach a typical reasoning problem by creating a hypothetical example. Let's assume "Sample reasoning question 168" is a logic puzzle or a math problem. I'll create a problem and solve it step by step.

### Hypothetical Problem:
**Problem:** A farmer has a total of 168 animals consisting of chickens and cows. If the total number of legs is 456, how many chickens and how many cows does the farmer have?

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( c \) be the number of chickens.
   - Let \( w \) be the number of cows.

2. **Set Up Equations:**
   - Each chicken has 2 legs, and each cow has 4 legs.
   - We have two equations based on the problem statement:
     1. Total number of animals: \( c + w = 168 \)
     2. Total number of legs: \( 2c + 4w = 456 \)

3. **Solve the System of Equations:**

   **Equation 1:** \( c + w = 168 \)

   **Equation 2:** \( 2c + 4w = 456 \)

   - Simplify Equation 2 by dividing everything by 2:
     \[
     c + 2w = 228
     \]

4. **Subtract Equation 1 from the simplified Equation 2:**

   \[
   (c + 2w) - (c + w) = 228 - 168
   \]

   \[
   c + 2w - c - w = 60
   \]

   \[
   w = 60
   \]

5. **Substitute \( w = 60 \) back into Equation 1:**

   \[
   c + 60 = 168
   \]

   \[
   c = 168 - 60
   \]

   \[
   c = 108
   \]

6. **Verify the Solution:**
   - Number of chickens \( c = 108 \)
   - Number of cows \( w = 60 \)

   - Check the total number of legs:
     \[
     2c + 4w = 2(108) + 4(60) = 216 + 240 = 456
     \]

   - The calculations are consistent with the problem statement.

### Final Answer:
The farmer has 108 chickens and 60 cows.
