==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 168" refers to. However, since the problem statement is not clear or specific, I'll demonstrate a general approach to solving a typical math reasoning problem. Let's assume a hypothetical math problem and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**

A farmer has a rectangular field with a length that is 20 meters longer than its width. The area of the field is 1120 square meters. What are the dimensions of the field?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( w \) be the width of the field in meters.
   - Then, the length of the field is \( w + 20 \) meters.

2. **Write the Equation for Area:**
   - The area \( A \) of a rectangle is given by the formula:
     \[
     A = \text{length} \times \text{width}
     \]
   - Substituting the known values, we have:
     \[
     1120 = (w + 20) \times w
     \]

3. **Expand and Simplify the Equation:**
   - Expanding the right side:
     \[
     1120 = w^2 + 20w
     \]

4. **Rearrange into a Standard Quadratic Equation:**
   - Bring all terms to one side to set the equation to zero:
     \[
     w^2 + 20w - 1120 = 0
     \]

5. **Solve the Quadratic Equation:**
   - We can solve this using the quadratic formula, \( w = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \), where \( a = 1 \), \( b = 20 \), and \( c = -1120 \).
   - Calculate the discriminant:
     \[
     b^2 - 4ac = 20^2 - 4 \times 1 \times (-1120) = 400 + 4480 = 4880
     \]
   - Calculate the square root of the discriminant:
     \[
     \sqrt{4880} \approx 69.86
     \]
   - Substitute back into the quadratic formula:
     \[
     w = \frac{-20 \pm 69.86}{2}
     \]
   - Calculate the two possible solutions for \( w \):
     \[
     w_1 = \frac{-20 + 69.86}{2} \approx 24.93
     \]
     \[
     w_2 = \frac{-20 - 69.86}{2} \approx -44.93
     \]

6. **Select the Valid Solution:**
   - Since width cannot be negative, we choose \( w_1 \approx 24.93 \).

7. **Calculate the Length:**
   - Using \( w = 24.93 \), the length is:
     \[
     l = w + 20 = 24.93 + 20 = 44.93
     \]

8. **Verify the Solution:**
   - Check the area with these dimensions:
     \[
     \text{Area} = 24.93 \times 44.93 \approx 1120 \, \text{square meters}
     \]

**Final Answer:**

The dimensions of the field are approximately 24.93 meters in width and 44.93 meters in length.
