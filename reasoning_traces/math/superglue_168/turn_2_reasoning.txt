==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 168" refers to. Since the problem statement is not provided, I'll demonstrate a general approach to solving a reasoning problem by creating a hypothetical example and solving it step by step.

Let's assume the problem is as follows:

**Problem:**
A farmer has a certain number of apples. He gives half of them to his neighbor and then eats 3 apples. After that, he has 7 apples left. How many apples did the farmer have initially?

**Step-by-step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - The farmer gives away half of his apples.
   - He then eats 3 apples.
   - He is left with 7 apples.

2. **Set Up the Equation:**
   - Let \( x \) be the initial number of apples.
   - After giving away half, he has \( \frac{x}{2} \) apples left.
   - He eats 3 apples, so now he has \( \frac{x}{2} - 3 \) apples.
   - According to the problem, he is left with 7 apples, so we set up the equation:
     \[
     \frac{x}{2} - 3 = 7
     \]

3. **Solve the Equation:**
   - Add 3 to both sides to isolate the term with \( x \):
     \[
     \frac{x}{2} = 10
     \]
   - Multiply both sides by 2 to solve for \( x \):
     \[
     x = 20
     \]

4. **Verify the Solution:**
   - Initially, the farmer has 20 apples.
   - He gives away half, which is \( \frac{20}{2} = 10 \) apples, so he has 10 apples left.
   - He eats 3 apples, leaving him with \( 10 - 3 = 7 \) apples.
   - This matches the condition given in the problem, confirming our solution is correct.

**Final Answer:**
The farmer initially had 20 apples.
