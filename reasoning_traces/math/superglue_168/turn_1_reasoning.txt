==================================================

To solve the problem effectively, let's first understand what "Sample reasoning question 168" might entail. Since the problem statement is not explicitly given, I'll assume a generic approach to solving a reasoning-based math problem. 

Let's consider a typical math reasoning problem that involves logical deduction, pattern recognition, or arithmetic operations. I'll create a hypothetical problem and solve it step-by-step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**

A sequence of numbers is given as follows: 2, 4, 8, 16, ... What is the 10th term of this sequence?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Identify the Pattern:**
   - Look at the sequence: 2, 4, 8, 16, ...
   - Notice that each term is obtained by multiplying the previous term by 2.
   - This is a geometric sequence where each term is twice the previous term.

2. **General Formula for the Sequence:**
   - In a geometric sequence, the nth term can be expressed as:
     \[
     a_n = a_1 \times r^{(n-1)}
     \]
     where \( a_1 \) is the first term and \( r \) is the common ratio.
   - Here, \( a_1 = 2 \) and \( r = 2 \).

3. **Calculate the 10th Term:**
   - Substitute the values into the formula to find the 10th term:
     \[
     a_{10} = 2 \times 2^{(10-1)}
     \]
     \[
     a_{10} = 2 \times 2^9
     \]
     \[
     a_{10} = 2 \times 512
     \]
     \[
     a_{10} = 1024
     \]

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The 10th term of the sequence is 1024.

**Final Answer:**

The 10th term of the sequence is 1024.

This solution demonstrates a clear understanding of geometric sequences and applies the formula to find the desired term. If the original "Sample reasoning question 168" had different specifics, please provide more details for a tailored solution.
