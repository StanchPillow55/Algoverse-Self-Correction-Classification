Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem effectively, let's first clarify the question. It seems like the question is labeled as "Sample reasoning question 371," but without additional context or specific details about what the problem entails, it's challenging to provide a precise solution. However, I can guide you through a generic process of solving a typical math reasoning problem.

### Step-by-Step Approach:

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - Identify what is being asked. Are we solving for a variable, proving a theorem, or calculating a value?
   - Determine what information is given and what is needed.

2. **Gather Information:**
   - List all known values, equations, or conditions provided in the problem.
   - Identify any formulas or theorems that might be relevant.

3. **Plan a Strategy:**
   - Decide on the best approach to solve the problem. This could involve algebraic manipulation, applying a specific formula, or logical reasoning.
   - Consider if there are multiple ways to approach the problem and choose the most efficient one.

4. **Execute the Plan:**
   - Carry out the calculations or logical steps as per the chosen strategy.
   - Ensure each step follows logically from the previous one and adheres to mathematical principles.

5. **Check Your Work:**
   - Verify each step to ensure there are no errors.
   - Check if the final answer makes sense in the context of the problem.
   - If possible, use a different method to confirm the result.

6. **State the Final Answer:**
   - Clearly present the solution, ensuring it answers the question posed.

### Example Problem:

Since the original problem is not specified, let's consider a simple example:

**Problem:** Solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).

**Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We need to find the value of \( x \) that satisfies the equation.

2. **Gather Information:**
   - The equation given is \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).

3. **Plan a Strategy:**
   - Isolate \( x \) by performing algebraic operations.

4. **Execute the Plan:**
   - Subtract 3 from both sides: 
     \[
     2x + 3 - 3 = 11 - 3 \implies 2x = 8
     \]
   - Divide both sides by 2:
     \[
     \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{8}{2} \implies x = 4
     \]

5. **Check Your Work:**
   - Substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation:
     \[
     2(4) + 3 = 8 + 3 = 11
     \]
   - The left-hand side equals the right-hand side, confirming the solution is correct.

6. **State the Final Answer:**
   - The solution to the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \) is \( x = 4 \).
