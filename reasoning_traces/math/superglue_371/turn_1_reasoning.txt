==================================================

To solve the problem effectively, I need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 371" entails. However, since the problem statement is not provided, I will demonstrate a general approach to solving a reasoning-based math problem by creating a hypothetical problem and solving it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**

A train travels from Station A to Station B, a distance of 120 miles. The train travels the first 60 miles at a speed of 30 miles per hour and the remaining 60 miles at a speed of 60 miles per hour. What is the average speed of the train for the entire journey?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We need to find the average speed of the train for the entire journey from Station A to Station B.
   - The journey is divided into two segments:
     - First segment: 60 miles at 30 mph.
     - Second segment: 60 miles at 60 mph.

2. **Calculate the Time Taken for Each Segment:**
   - For the first segment:
     \[
     \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{60 \text{ miles}}{30 \text{ mph}} = 2 \text{ hours}
     \]
   - For the second segment:
     \[
     \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{60 \text{ miles}}{60 \text{ mph}} = 1 \text{ hour}
     \]

3. **Calculate the Total Time for the Journey:**
   \[
   \text{Total Time} = 2 \text{ hours} + 1 \text{ hour} = 3 \text{ hours}
   \]

4. **Calculate the Total Distance:**
   - The total distance is the sum of the distances for both segments:
     \[
     \text{Total Distance} = 60 \text{ miles} + 60 \text{ miles} = 120 \text{ miles}
     \]

5. **Calculate the Average Speed:**
   - The average speed is the total distance divided by the total time:
     \[
     \text{Average Speed} = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Total Time}} = \frac{120 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ hours}} = 40 \text{ mph}
     \]

6. **Conclusion:**
   - The average speed of the train for the entire journey is 40 miles per hour.

**Final Answer:**
The average speed of the train for the entire journey is 40 mph.
