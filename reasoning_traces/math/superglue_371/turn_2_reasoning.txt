==================================================

To solve the problem effectively, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 371" entails. Since the problem statement is not explicitly provided, let's assume that it involves a typical mathematical reasoning problem. I'll create a hypothetical problem and solve it step-by-step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**

A company produces two types of widgets: Type A and Type B. The production cost for Type A is $5 per widget, and for Type B, it is $8 per widget. The company sells Type A widgets for $10 each and Type B widgets for $15 each. In a given month, the company produced a total of 1000 widgets and made a profit of $7000. How many of each type of widget did the company produce?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( x \) be the number of Type A widgets produced.
   - Let \( y \) be the number of Type B widgets produced.

2. **Set Up Equations:**
   - The total number of widgets produced is 1000:
     \[
     x + y = 1000
     \]

   - The profit from selling the widgets is given by the revenue minus the production cost. The revenue from selling Type A widgets is \( 10x \) and from Type B widgets is \( 15y \). The production cost for Type A is \( 5x \) and for Type B is \( 8y \). The profit is given by:
     \[
     (10x + 15y) - (5x + 8y) = 7000
     \]

   - Simplifying the profit equation:
     \[
     5x + 7y = 7000
     \]

3. **Solve the System of Equations:**
   - We have the following system of equations:
     \[
     \begin{align*}
     x + y &= 1000 \\
     5x + 7y &= 7000
     \end{align*}
     \]

   - Solve the first equation for \( x \):
     \[
     x = 1000 - y
     \]

   - Substitute \( x = 1000 - y \) into the second equation:
     \[
     5(1000 - y) + 7y = 7000
     \]

   - Distribute and simplify:
     \[
     5000 - 5y + 7y = 7000
     \]

     \[
     5000 + 2y = 7000
     \]

   - Solve for \( y \):
     \[
     2y = 2000
     \]

     \[
     y = 1000
     \]

   - Substitute \( y = 1000 \) back into \( x = 1000 - y \):
     \[
     x = 1000 - 1000 = 0
     \]

4. **Verify the Solution:**
   - Check the total number of widgets:
     \[
     x + y = 0 + 1000 = 1000
     \]

   - Check the profit:
     \[
     5x + 7y = 5(0) + 7(1000) = 7000
     \]

   Both conditions are satisfied.

**Final Answer:**

The company produced 0 Type A widgets and 1000 Type B widgets.
