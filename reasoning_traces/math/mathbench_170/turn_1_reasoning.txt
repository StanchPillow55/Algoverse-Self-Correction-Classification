==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample math problem 170" refers to. Since I don't have the specific details of this problem, I'll create a hypothetical math problem labeled as "Sample math problem 170" and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem 170:**

*Calculate the sum of the first 20 positive even integers.*

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Identify the Sequence:**
   The first 20 positive even integers are: 2, 4, 6, 8, ..., 40.

2. **Recognize the Pattern:**
   This sequence is an arithmetic sequence where the first term \( a_1 = 2 \) and the common difference \( d = 2 \).

3. **Formula for the Sum of an Arithmetic Sequence:**
   The sum \( S_n \) of the first \( n \) terms of an arithmetic sequence can be calculated using the formula:
   \[
   S_n = \frac{n}{2} \times (a_1 + a_n)
   \]
   where \( a_n \) is the \( n \)-th term.

4. **Find the 20th Term:**
   The \( n \)-th term \( a_n \) of an arithmetic sequence is given by:
   \[
   a_n = a_1 + (n-1) \times d
   \]
   Substituting the known values:
   \[
   a_{20} = 2 + (20-1) \times 2 = 2 + 38 = 40
   \]

5. **Calculate the Sum:**
   Now, substitute \( n = 20 \), \( a_1 = 2 \), and \( a_{20} = 40 \) into the sum formula:
   \[
   S_{20} = \frac{20}{2} \times (2 + 40) = 10 \times 42 = 420
   \]

6. **Conclusion:**
   The sum of the first 20 positive even integers is 420.

**Final Answer:**
The sum of the first 20 positive even integers is 420.
