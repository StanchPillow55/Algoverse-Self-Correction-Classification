==================================================

To solve the problem, we first need to understand what "Sample math problem 170" refers to. Since the problem statement is not explicitly provided, I'll create a hypothetical math problem labeled as "Sample math problem 170" and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem Statement:**
"Sample math problem 170: A rectangle has a length that is twice its width. If the perimeter of the rectangle is 60 units, find the dimensions of the rectangle."

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We have a rectangle with a length (L) and a width (W).
   - The length is twice the width: \( L = 2W \).
   - The perimeter of the rectangle is 60 units.

2. **Recall the Formula for Perimeter:**
   - The perimeter (P) of a rectangle is given by the formula:
     \[
     P = 2L + 2W
     \]

3. **Substitute the Given Values:**
   - We know \( P = 60 \) and \( L = 2W \).
   - Substitute \( L = 2W \) into the perimeter formula:
     \[
     60 = 2(2W) + 2W
     \]

4. **Simplify the Equation:**
   - Simplify the expression:
     \[
     60 = 4W + 2W
     \]
   - Combine like terms:
     \[
     60 = 6W
     \]

5. **Solve for W:**
   - Divide both sides by 6 to solve for W:
     \[
     W = \frac{60}{6} = 10
     \]

6. **Find the Length L:**
   - Since \( L = 2W \), substitute \( W = 10 \) into the equation for L:
     \[
     L = 2 \times 10 = 20
     \]

7. **Verify the Solution:**
   - Check if the dimensions satisfy the perimeter condition:
     \[
     P = 2L + 2W = 2(20) + 2(10) = 40 + 20 = 60
     \]
   - The calculated perimeter matches the given perimeter, confirming our solution is correct.

**Final Answer:**
The dimensions of the rectangle are a width of 10 units and a length of 20 units.
