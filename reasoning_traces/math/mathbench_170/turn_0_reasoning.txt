==================================================

To solve the problem, I need more information about "Sample math problem 170." Since the problem statement is not provided, I'll demonstrate how to solve a generic math problem by walking through an example. Let's consider a sample problem involving algebra:

**Problem:**
Solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).

**Step-by-step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Equation:**
   The equation given is \( 2x + 3 = 11 \). Our goal is to solve for \( x \).

2. **Isolate the Variable:**
   To isolate \( x \), we need to get rid of the constant term on the left side of the equation. We can do this by subtracting 3 from both sides of the equation.

   \[
   2x + 3 - 3 = 11 - 3
   \]

   Simplifying both sides gives:

   \[
   2x = 8
   \]

3. **Solve for \( x \):**
   Now, we need to solve for \( x \) by getting rid of the coefficient of \( x \), which is 2. We can do this by dividing both sides of the equation by 2.

   \[
   \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{8}{2}
   \]

   Simplifying both sides gives:

   \[
   x = 4
   \]

4. **Verify the Solution:**
   To ensure our solution is correct, we can substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation and check if both sides are equal.

   \[
   2(4) + 3 = 11
   \]

   Simplifying the left side gives:

   \[
   8 + 3 = 11
   \]

   Since both sides of the equation are equal, our solution \( x = 4 \) is correct.

**Final Answer:**
The solution to the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \) is \( x = 4 \).
