==================================================

To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step.

1. **Calculate the total number of holes dug by the end of the third day:**
   - On the first day, the pirates dug 10 holes.
   - On the second day, they dug 13 holes.
   - On the third day, they dug 8 holes but filled in 2 holes.

   So, the number of holes dug on the third day that count towards the total is:
   \[
   8 - 2 = 6 \text{ holes}
   \]

   Now, we can calculate the total number of holes dug by the end of the third day:
   \[
   \text{Total holes} = 10 + 13 + 6 = 29 \text{ holes}
   \]

2. **Determine the number of holes at the end of the fourth day:**
   According to the problem, by the end of the fourth day, the number of holes is four times the number of holes at the end of the first day. The number of holes at the end of the first day is:
   \[
   10 \text{ holes}
   \]

   Therefore, the number of holes at the end of the fourth day is:
   \[
   4 \times 10 = 40 \text{ holes}
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of holes dug on the fourth day:**
   To find out how many holes the pirates dug on the fourth day, we need to subtract the total number of holes at the end of the third day from the total number of holes at the end of the fourth day:
   \[
   \text{Holes dug on the fourth day} = \text{Total holes at the end of the fourth day} - \text{Total holes at the end of the third day}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Holes dug on the fourth day} = 40 - 29 = 11 \text{ holes}
   \]

4. **Final Answer:**
   The number of holes the pirates dug on the fourth day before finding the treasure is:
   \[
   \boxed{11}
   \]
