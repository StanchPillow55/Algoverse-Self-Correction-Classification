To find out how many flowers Mark has in his garden, we will break down the problem step by step.

1. **Identify the number of yellow flowers:**
   - Mark has 10 yellow flowers.

2. **Calculate the number of purple flowers:**
   - We are told that there are 80% more purple flowers than yellow flowers. 
   - To find the number of purple flowers, we first calculate 80% of the number of yellow flowers:
     \[
     80\% \text{ of } 10 = 0.80 \times 10 = 8
     \]
   - Therefore, the number of purple flowers is:
     \[
     \text{Number of purple flowers} = \text{Number of yellow flowers} + 80\% \text{ of yellow flowers} = 10 + 8 = 18
     \]

3. **Calculate the total number of yellow and purple flowers:**
   - Now, we add the number of yellow and purple flowers together:
     \[
     \text{Total yellow and purple flowers} = \text{Number of yellow flowers} + \text{Number of purple flowers} = 10 + 18 = 28
     \]

4. **Calculate the number of green flowers:**
   - We are told that there are only 25% as many green flowers as there are yellow and purple flowers. 
   - To find the number of green flowers, we calculate 25% of the total number of yellow and purple flowers:
     \[
     25\% \text{ of } 28 = 0.25 \times 28 = 7
     \]

5. **Calculate the total number of flowers in the garden:**
   - Finally, we add the number of yellow, purple, and green flowers together to find the total number of flowers in the garden:
     \[
     \text{Total flowers} = \text{Number of yellow flowers} + \text{Number of purple flowers} + \text{Number of green flowers} = 10 + 18 + 7 = 35
     \]

Thus, the total number of flowers in Mark's garden is \( \boxed{35} \).
