==================================================

First, let's find out how many purple flowers there are. 

We know there are 10 yellow flowers and that there are 80% more purple flowers than yellow flowers. To find out how many purple flowers there are, we calculate 80% of 10 and add that to the original 10 yellow flowers.

80% of 10 is 0.80 * 10 = 8.

So, there are 10 yellow flowers + 8 purple flowers = 18 purple flowers.

Next, we need to find out how many green flowers there are. We know there are only 25% as many green flowers as there are yellow and purple flowers combined. 

First, we add up the number of yellow and purple flowers: 10 yellow + 18 purple = 28 flowers.

Then, we find out what 25% of that total is to get the number of green flowers: 0.25 * 28 = 7 green flowers.

Finally, we add up all the flowers to find out how many flowers Mark has in total: 10 yellow + 18 purple + 7 green = 35 flowers.

So, Mark has 35 flowers in his garden.
