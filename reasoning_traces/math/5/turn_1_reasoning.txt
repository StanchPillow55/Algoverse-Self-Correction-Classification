Question ID: 5
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many purple flowers there are, then how many green flowers there are, and finally add all the flowers together.

Step 1: Find the number of purple flowers
We know that there are 80% more purple flowers than yellow flowers. Since there are 10 yellow flowers, we can calculate the number of purple flowers as follows:

80% of 10 = 0.80 * 10 = 8

So, there are 8 more purple flowers than yellow flowers. Therefore, the total number of purple flowers is:

10 (yellow flowers) + 8 = 18 purple flowers

Step 2: Find the number of green flowers
We know that the number of green flowers is 25% of the total number of yellow and purple flowers. So, we first add the number of yellow and purple flowers:

10 (yellow flowers) + 18 (purple flowers) = 28 flowers

Then, we calculate 25% of this total:

25% of 28 = 0.25 * 28 = 7 green flowers

Step 3: Find the total number of flowers
Finally, we add the number of flowers of each color to find the total number of flowers:

10 (yellow flowers) + 18 (purple flowers) + 7 (green flowers) = 35 flowers

So, Mark has 35 flowers in his garden.
