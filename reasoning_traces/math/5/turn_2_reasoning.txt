Question ID: 5
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we first need to find out how many purple flowers there are. We know that there are 80% more purple flowers than yellow flowers. 

To calculate this, we multiply the number of yellow flowers (10) by 80% (or 0.8). 

10 * 0.8 = 8

So, there are 8 more purple flowers than yellow flowers. Adding this to the original number of yellow flowers gives us:

10 (yellow flowers) + 8 (additional purple flowers) = 18 purple flowers

Next, we need to find out how many green flowers there are. We know that the number of green flowers is 25% of the total number of yellow and purple flowers. 

To calculate this, we add the number of yellow and purple flowers together and then multiply by 25% (or 0.25).

(10 (yellow flowers) + 18 (purple flowers)) * 0.25 = 7 green flowers

Finally, to find the total number of flowers in the garden, we add the number of yellow, purple, and green flowers together:

10 (yellow flowers) + 18 (purple flowers) + 7 (green flowers) = 35 flowers

So, Mark has 35 flowers in his garden.
