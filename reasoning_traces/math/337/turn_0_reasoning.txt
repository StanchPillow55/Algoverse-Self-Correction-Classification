==================================================

To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step and calculate the number of hot dogs each person ate.

1. **Determine how many hot dogs Luke ate:**
   - According to the problem, Luke ate 2 hot dogs.
   \[
   \text{Luke's hot dogs} = 2
   \]

2. **Calculate how many hot dogs Thomas ate:**
   - The problem states that Thomas ate three times more hot dogs than Luke. Therefore, we can calculate Thomas's consumption as follows:
   \[
   \text{Thomas's hot dogs} = 3 \times \text{Luke's hot dogs} = 3 \times 2 = 6
   \]

3. **Calculate how many hot dogs John ate:**
   - The problem indicates that John ate half the amount that Thomas ate. Thus, we can find John's consumption:
   \[
   \text{John's hot dogs} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Thomas's hot dogs} = \frac{1}{2} \times 6 = 3
   \]

4. **Determine how many more hot dogs John ate than Luke:**
   - Now we need to find the difference between the number of hot dogs John ate and the number of hot dogs Luke ate:
   \[
   \text{Difference} = \text{John's hot dogs} - \text{Luke's hot dogs} = 3 - 2 = 1
   \]

Thus, John ate 1 more hot dog than Luke.

**Final Answer:**
John ate 1 more hot dog than Luke.
