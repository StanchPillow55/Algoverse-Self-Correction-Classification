==================================================

To solve the problem, we can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion, which helps us find the total number of unique individuals in overlapping sets.

Let:
- \( A \) be the set of people who took wine.
- \( B \) be the set of people who took soda.

From the problem, we have the following information:
- \( |A| = 26 \) (the number of people who took wine)
- \( |B| = 22 \) (the number of people who took soda)
- \( |A \cap B| = 17 \) (the number of people who took both wine and soda)

We want to find the total number of unique individuals, which is represented by \( |A \cup B| \) (the number of people who took either wine or soda or both).

Using the principle of inclusion-exclusion, we can calculate \( |A \cup B| \) as follows:

\[
|A \cup B| = |A| + |B| - |A \cap B|
\]

Substituting the values we have:

\[
|A \cup B| = 26 + 22 - 17
\]

Now, we perform the calculations step by step:

1. First, add the number of people who took wine and the number of people who took soda:
   \[
   26 + 22 = 48
   \]

2. Next, subtract the number of people who took both drinks:
   \[
   48 - 17 = 31
   \]

Thus, the total number of unique individuals at the gathering is:

\[
|A \cup B| = 31
\]

Therefore, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{31}
\]
