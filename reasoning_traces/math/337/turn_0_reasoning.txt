==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of people at the gathering, given the number of people who took wine, soda, and both drinks. This is a classic problem involving the principle of inclusion-exclusion.

Let's define the following:
- \( W \) is the set of people who took wine.
- \( S \) is the set of people who took soda.
- \( |W| \) is the number of people who took wine.
- \( |S| \) is the number of people who took soda.
- \( |W \cap S| \) is the number of people who took both drinks.

From the problem, we have:
- \( |W| = 26 \)
- \( |S| = 22 \)
- \( |W \cap S| = 17 \)

We want to find the total number of people at the gathering, which is the number of people who took at least one drink. This can be calculated using the principle of inclusion-exclusion:

\[
|W \cup S| = |W| + |S| - |W \cap S|
\]

Substituting the given values into the formula:

\[
|W \cup S| = 26 + 22 - 17
\]

Calculate the expression:

\[
|W \cup S| = 48 - 17 = 31
\]

Therefore, the total number of people at the gathering is 31.

Final Answer: 31 people were at the gathering.
