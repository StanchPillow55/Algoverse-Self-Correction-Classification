==================================================

It seems like the problem statement "Sample math problem 395" is not providing enough specific information about the math problem you want to solve. To help you effectively, I'll need more details or context about the problem. However, I can demonstrate how to solve a typical math problem by creating an example problem and solving it step by step.

Let's assume "Sample math problem 395" refers to a problem involving basic algebra. Here's an example problem:

**Example Problem:**
Solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 3x + 5 = 20 \).

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Equation:**
   The equation given is \( 3x + 5 = 20 \). Our goal is to solve for \( x \).

2. **Isolate the Variable:**
   To isolate \( x \), we need to get rid of the constant term on the left side of the equation. We can do this by subtracting 5 from both sides of the equation.

   \[
   3x + 5 - 5 = 20 - 5
   \]

   Simplifying both sides gives:

   \[
   3x = 15
   \]

3. **Solve for \( x \):**
   Now, we need to solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides of the equation by 3.

   \[
   \frac{3x}{3} = \frac{15}{3}
   \]

   Simplifying both sides gives:

   \[
   x = 5
   \]

4. **Verify the Solution:**
   To ensure our solution is correct, we can substitute \( x = 5 \) back into the original equation and check if both sides are equal.

   Original equation: \( 3x + 5 = 20 \)

   Substitute \( x = 5 \):

   \[
   3(5) + 5 = 15 + 5 = 20
   \]

   Since both sides of the equation are equal, our solution is verified.

**Final Answer:**
The solution to the equation \( 3x + 5 = 20 \) is \( x = 5 \).
