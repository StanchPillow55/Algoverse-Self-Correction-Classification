To proceed, let's create a hypothetical math problem based on the number 395 and solve it. Suppose the problem is as follows:

**Problem:**
Find the sum of the digits of the number 395, and then multiply the result by 3. What is the final answer?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Identify the digits of the number 395:**
   - The number 395 consists of the digits 3, 9, and 5.

2. **Calculate the sum of the digits:**
   \[
   3 + 9 + 5 = 17
   \]

3. **Multiply the sum by 3:**
   \[
   17 \times 3 = 51
   \]

4. **Final Answer:**
   The final answer is 51.
