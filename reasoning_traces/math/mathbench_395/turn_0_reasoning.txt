==================================================

It seems like there might be a misunderstanding or missing information, as "Sample math problem 395" does not provide specific details about the problem to be solved. To assist you effectively, I need a clear and complete math problem statement. 

However, I can guide you through a generic approach to solving a math problem by outlining the steps typically involved:

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - Read the problem carefully.
   - Identify what is being asked.
   - Determine what information is given and what needs to be found.

2. **Devise a Plan:**
   - Think about the strategies that can be used to solve the problem (e.g., algebraic manipulation, drawing a diagram, logical reasoning, etc.).
   - Consider similar problems you have solved before.

3. **Carry Out the Plan:**
   - Execute the chosen strategy step by step.
   - Perform calculations carefully.
   - Keep track of units and signs.

4. **Review/Check the Solution:**
   - Verify each step of your work.
   - Check if the final answer makes sense in the context of the problem.
   - Recalculate if necessary to ensure accuracy.

5. **State the Final Answer:**
   - Clearly present the solution to the problem.
   - Include units if applicable.

If you provide a specific math problem, I can apply these steps to solve it and show all the work involved.
