To solve the problem, we need to determine the current ages of Emil's dad and brother based on the information given about their ages when Emil turns 24.

1. **Current Age of Emil**: Emil is currently 19 years old.

2. **Age of Emil When He Turns 24**: 
   - Emil will turn 24 in \( 24 - 19 = 5 \) years.

3. **Age of Emil's Dad When Emil Turns 24**: 
   - Let \( D \) be the current age of Emil's dad.
   - In 5 years, Emil's dad will be \( D + 5 \).

4. **Age of Emil's Brother When Emil Turns 24**: 
   - Let \( B \) be the current age of Emil's brother.
   - In 5 years, Emil's brother will be \( B + 5 \).

5. **Setting Up the Age Relationships**:
   - According to the problem, when Emil turns 24, he will be half the age of his dad:
     \[
     24 = \frac{1}{2}(D + 5)
     \]
   - He will also be twice as old as his brother:
     \[
     24 = 2(B + 5)
     \]

6. **Solving the First Equation**:
   - From the first equation:
     \[
     24 = \frac{1}{2}(D + 5)
     \]
   - Multiply both sides by 2:
     \[
     48 = D + 5
     \]
   - Subtract 5 from both sides:
     \[
     D = 48 - 5 = 43
     \]

7. **Solving the Second Equation**:
   - From the second equation:
     \[
     24 = 2(B + 5)
     \]
   - Divide both sides by 2:
     \[
     12 = B + 5
     \]
   - Subtract 5 from both sides:
     \[
     B = 12 - 5 = 7
     \]

8. **Current Ages**:
   - Emil's dad is currently \( D = 43 \) years old.
   - Emil's brother is currently \( B = 7 \) years old.

9. **Calculating the Sum of Their Ages**:
   - The sum of the ages of Emil's dad and brother now is:
     \[
     D + B = 43 + 7 = 50
     \]

10. **Final Answer**:
   - The sum of the ages of Emil's dad and brother now is \( \boxed{50} \).
