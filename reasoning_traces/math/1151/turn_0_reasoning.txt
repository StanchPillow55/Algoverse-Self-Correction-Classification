To find Sid's average speed over the entire trip, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total distance traveled.**
   - Sid first traveled 110 miles.
   - Then he traveled an additional 140 miles.
   - Therefore, the total distance \( D \) is:
     \[
     D = 110 \text{ miles} + 140 \text{ miles} = 250 \text{ miles}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total time taken.**
   - Sid took 2 hours for the first part of the trip.
   - He took 3 hours for the second part of the trip.
   - Therefore, the total time \( T \) is:
     \[
     T = 2 \text{ hours} + 3 \text{ hours} = 5 \text{ hours}
     \]

3. **Calculate the average speed.**
   - Average speed \( S \) is defined as the total distance divided by the total time. The formula is:
     \[
     S = \frac{D}{T}
     \]
   - Substituting the values we calculated:
     \[
     S = \frac{250 \text{ miles}}{5 \text{ hours}} = 50 \text{ miles per hour}
     \]

Thus, Sid's average speed over the entire trip is \( \boxed{50} \) miles per hour.
