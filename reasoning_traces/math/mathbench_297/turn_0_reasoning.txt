==================================================

To solve the problem, we first need to understand what "Sample math problem 297" refers to. Since there is no specific problem statement provided, I will create a sample math problem involving the number 297 and solve it step by step.

**Sample Math Problem:**

Determine if the number 297 is a prime number. If it is not, find its prime factorization.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understanding Prime Numbers:**
   - A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.

2. **Check if 297 is a Prime Number:**
   - To determine if 297 is a prime number, we need to check if it has any divisors other than 1 and 297.
   - We only need to check for divisors up to the square root of 297. Calculating the square root:
     \[
     \sqrt{297} \approx 17.23
     \]
   - Therefore, we need to check divisibility by prime numbers less than or equal to 17 (i.e., 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17).

3. **Check Divisibility:**
   - **Divisibility by 2:** 297 is an odd number, so it is not divisible by 2.
   - **Divisibility by 3:** A number is divisible by 3 if the sum of its digits is divisible by 3.
     \[
     2 + 9 + 7 = 18
     \]
     Since 18 is divisible by 3, 297 is divisible by 3.
   - Divide 297 by 3:
     \[
     297 \div 3 = 99
     \]

4. **Factor 99 Further:**
   - Now, we need to factor 99. Check divisibility by 3 again:
     \[
     9 + 9 = 18
     \]
     Since 18 is divisible by 3, 99 is divisible by 3.
   - Divide 99 by 3:
     \[
     99 \div 3 = 33
     \]

5. **Factor 33 Further:**
   - Check divisibility by 3 again:
     \[
     3 + 3 = 6
     \]
     Since 6 is divisible by 3, 33 is divisible by 3.
   - Divide 33 by 3:
     \[
     33 \div 3 = 11
     \]

6. **Check if 11 is Prime:**
   - 11 is a prime number because it has no divisors other than 1 and itself.

7. **Prime Factorization of 297:**
   - Combining all the factors, we have:
     \[
     297 = 3 \times 3 \times 3 \times 11 = 3^3 \times 11
     \]

**Final Answer:**

The number 297 is not a prime number. Its prime factorization is \(3^3 \times 11\).
