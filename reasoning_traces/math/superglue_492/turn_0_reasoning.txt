To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 492" entails. Since the problem statement is not specific, I'll assume it's a generic math problem that involves logical reasoning and calculations. Let's create a hypothetical problem and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**

A company produces two types of widgets: Type A and Type B. The production cost for Type A is $5 per unit, and for Type B, it is $8 per unit. The company sells Type A widgets for $10 each and Type B widgets for $15 each. In a given month, the company produced 300 Type A widgets and 200 Type B widgets. Calculate the total profit for the company for that month.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Calculate the Total Production Cost:**

   - For Type A widgets:
     \[
     \text{Cost for Type A} = \text{Number of Type A widgets} \times \text{Cost per Type A widget}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Cost for Type A} = 300 \times 5 = 1500 \text{ dollars}
     \]

   - For Type B widgets:
     \[
     \text{Cost for Type B} = \text{Number of Type B widgets} \times \text{Cost per Type B widget}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Cost for Type B} = 200 \times 8 = 1600 \text{ dollars}
     \]

   - Total production cost:
     \[
     \text{Total Production Cost} = \text{Cost for Type A} + \text{Cost for Type B}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total Production Cost} = 1500 + 1600 = 3100 \text{ dollars}
     \]

2. **Calculate the Total Revenue:**

   - For Type A widgets:
     \[
     \text{Revenue for Type A} = \text{Number of Type A widgets} \times \text{Selling price per Type A widget}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Revenue for Type A} = 300 \times 10 = 3000 \text{ dollars}
     \]

   - For Type B widgets:
     \[
     \text{Revenue for Type B} = \text{Number of Type B widgets} \times \text{Selling price per Type B widget}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Revenue for Type B} = 200 \times 15 = 3000 \text{ dollars}
     \]

   - Total revenue:
     \[
     \text{Total Revenue} = \text{Revenue for Type A} + \text{Revenue for Type B}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total Revenue} = 3000 + 3000 = 6000 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Calculate the Total Profit:**

   - Profit is calculated as the difference between total revenue and total production cost:
     \[
     \text{Profit} = \text{Total Revenue} - \text{Total Production Cost}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Profit} = 6000 - 3100 = 2900 \text{ dollars}
     \]

**Final Answer:**

The total profit for the company for that month is $2900.
