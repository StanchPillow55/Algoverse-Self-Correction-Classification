==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 492" entails. Since the problem statement is not explicitly provided, let's assume a hypothetical math problem and solve it step by step. 

Let's assume the problem is as follows:

**Problem:**  
A company produces two types of products, A and B. The profit from each unit of product A is $3, and the profit from each unit of product B is $5. The company can produce a maximum of 100 units of product A and 80 units of product B per day. However, due to resource constraints, the total production of products A and B combined cannot exceed 150 units per day. How many units of each product should the company produce to maximize profit?

**Solution:**

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( x \) be the number of units of product A produced.
   - Let \( y \) be the number of units of product B produced.

2. **Objective Function:**
   - We want to maximize the profit \( P \), which is given by:
     \[
     P = 3x + 5y
     \]

3. **Constraints:**
   - The production constraints are:
     \[
     x \leq 100
     \]
     \[
     y \leq 80
     \]
     \[
     x + y \leq 150
     \]
   - Additionally, \( x \geq 0 \) and \( y \geq 0 \) since negative production is not possible.

4. **Graphical Solution:**
   - Plot the constraints on a graph with \( x \) on the horizontal axis and \( y \) on the vertical axis.
   - The feasible region is bounded by the lines \( x = 100 \), \( y = 80 \), and \( x + y = 150 \).

5. **Vertices of the Feasible Region:**
   - The vertices of the feasible region can be found by solving the system of equations formed by the intersection of the constraint lines:
     - Intersection of \( x = 100 \) and \( x + y = 150 \): \((100, 50)\)
     - Intersection of \( y = 80 \) and \( x + y = 150 \): \((70, 80)\)
     - Intersection of \( x = 100 \) and \( y = 80 \): \((100, 80)\)
     - Intersection of \( x = 0 \) and \( y = 0 \): \((0, 0)\)

6. **Evaluate the Objective Function at Each Vertex:**
   - \( P(100, 50) = 3(100) + 5(50) = 300 + 250 = 550 \)
   - \( P(70, 80) = 3(70) + 5(80) = 210 + 400 = 610 \)
   - \( P(100, 80) = 3(100) + 5(80) = 300 + 400 = 700 \)
   - \( P(0, 0) = 3(0) + 5(0) = 0 \)

7. **Determine the Maximum Profit:**
   - The maximum profit occurs at the vertex \((100, 80)\) with a profit of $700.

**Final Answer:**
The company should produce 100 units of product A and 80 units of product B to achieve the maximum profit of $700 per day.
