==================================================

To solve the problem, we will follow the steps systematically, keeping track of the number of people on the train at each stage.

1. **Initial number of people on the train**: 
   The problem states that there are initially 172 people on the train.

   \[
   \text{Initial number of people} = 172
   \]

2. **First stop**:
   - At the first stop, 47 people get off the train.
   - Then, 13 more people get on the train.

   We will calculate the number of people on the train after the first stop:

   - First, we subtract the number of people who got off:
     \[
     172 - 47 = 125
     \]
   - Next, we add the number of people who got on:
     \[
     125 + 13 = 138
     \]

   So, after the first stop, there are 138 people on the train.

3. **Second stop**:
   - At the next stop, another 38 people get off the train.

   We will calculate the number of people on the train after the second stop:

   - We subtract the number of people who got off:
     \[
     138 - 38 = 100
     \]

4. **Final count**:
   After all the stops, the final number of people on the train is 100.

Thus, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{100}
\]
