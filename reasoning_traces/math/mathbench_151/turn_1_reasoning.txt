==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 151," we need to first understand what the problem is asking. However, since the problem statement is not provided, I'll demonstrate how to approach a generic math problem by creating a sample problem and solving it step-by-step.

**Sample Problem:**

Let's assume the problem is as follows:

"Calculate the sum of the first 151 positive integers."

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   We need to find the sum of the first 151 positive integers. The sequence of these integers is 1, 2, 3, ..., 151.

2. **Identify the Formula:**
   The sum of the first \( n \) positive integers can be calculated using the formula:
   \[
   S = \frac{n(n + 1)}{2}
   \]
   where \( S \) is the sum and \( n \) is the number of terms.

3. **Apply the Formula:**
   In this problem, \( n = 151 \). Plugging this into the formula gives:
   \[
   S = \frac{151 \times (151 + 1)}{2}
   \]

4. **Calculate the Sum:**
   First, calculate \( 151 + 1 \):
   \[
   151 + 1 = 152
   \]
   Then, multiply 151 by 152:
   \[
   151 \times 152 = 22952
   \]
   Finally, divide by 2 to find the sum:
   \[
   S = \frac{22952}{2} = 11476
   \]

5. **Verify the Calculation:**
   To ensure accuracy, let's verify the multiplication:
   \[
   151 \times 152 = 151 \times (150 + 2) = 151 \times 150 + 151 \times 2
   \]
   \[
   151 \times 150 = 22650
   \]
   \[
   151 \times 2 = 302
   \]
   \[
   22650 + 302 = 22952
   \]
   The multiplication is correct.

6. **State the Final Answer:**
   The sum of the first 151 positive integers is \( \boxed{11476} \).

This is a complete solution to the sample problem, demonstrating how to approach and solve a math problem step-by-step. If you have a specific problem labeled "Sample math problem 151," please provide the details so I can assist you accordingly.
