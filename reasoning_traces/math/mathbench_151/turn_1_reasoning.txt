==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample math problem 151" refers to. Since the problem itself is not provided, I will demonstrate how to approach a typical math problem by creating a hypothetical problem and solving it step-by-step.

Let's assume "Sample math problem 151" is the following:

**Problem:**
Calculate the value of \( x \) in the equation \( 3x + 5 = 20 \).

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Equation:**
   The equation given is \( 3x + 5 = 20 \). This is a linear equation in one variable, \( x \).

2. **Isolate the Variable:**
   To solve for \( x \), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We can do this by performing operations that will simplify the equation.

3. **Subtract 5 from Both Sides:**
   Start by eliminating the constant term on the left side of the equation:
   \[
   3x + 5 - 5 = 20 - 5
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   3x = 15
   \]

4. **Divide by 3:**
   Next, divide both sides of the equation by 3 to solve for \( x \):
   \[
   \frac{3x}{3} = \frac{15}{3}
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   x = 5
   \]

5. **Verify the Solution:**
   Substitute \( x = 5 \) back into the original equation to verify the solution:
   \[
   3(5) + 5 = 20
   \]
   Simplifying the left side gives:
   \[
   15 + 5 = 20
   \]
   \[
   20 = 20
   \]
   Since both sides of the equation are equal, the solution \( x = 5 \) is verified.

**Final Answer:**
The value of \( x \) is 5.

This step-by-step approach demonstrates how to solve a simple linear equation. If "Sample math problem 151" refers to a different problem, please provide the specific details, and I will be happy to solve it accordingly.
