==================================================

To solve "Sample math problem 151," we need to first understand what the problem is asking. Since the problem statement is not provided, I'll create a hypothetical math problem and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem 151:**

A rectangle has a length that is twice its width. If the perimeter of the rectangle is 48 units, find the dimensions of the rectangle.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We are given a rectangle with a perimeter of 48 units.
   - The length (L) of the rectangle is twice the width (W).

2. **Set Up the Equations:**
   - The formula for the perimeter (P) of a rectangle is given by:
     \[
     P = 2L + 2W
     \]
   - We know that \( L = 2W \).
   - Substitute \( L = 2W \) into the perimeter formula:
     \[
     48 = 2(2W) + 2W
     \]

3. **Simplify the Equation:**
   - Simplify the expression:
     \[
     48 = 4W + 2W
     \]
   - Combine like terms:
     \[
     48 = 6W
     \]

4. **Solve for W:**
   - Divide both sides by 6 to solve for W:
     \[
     W = \frac{48}{6} = 8
     \]

5. **Find the Length (L):**
   - Since \( L = 2W \), substitute \( W = 8 \) into the equation for L:
     \[
     L = 2(8) = 16
     \]

6. **Verify the Solution:**
   - Check the perimeter with the found dimensions:
     \[
     P = 2L + 2W = 2(16) + 2(8) = 32 + 16 = 48
     \]
   - The calculated perimeter matches the given perimeter, confirming the solution is correct.

**Final Answer:**

The dimensions of the rectangle are:
- Width (W) = 8 units
- Length (L) = 16 units
