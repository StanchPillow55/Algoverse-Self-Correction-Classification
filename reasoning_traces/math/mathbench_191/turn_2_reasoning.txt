Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, I need to first understand what "Sample math problem 191" refers to. Since I don't have access to external databases or specific problem sets, I'll assume this is a generic math problem. Without specific details, I'll create a sample problem and solve it step-by-step.

Let's assume "Sample math problem 191" is a quadratic equation problem:

**Problem:** Solve the quadratic equation \(2x^2 - 4x - 6 = 0\).

**Step 1: Identify the coefficients.**

The standard form of a quadratic equation is \(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\). Here, \(a = 2\), \(b = -4\), and \(c = -6\).

**Step 2: Use the quadratic formula.**

The quadratic formula is given by:

\[
x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
\]

**Step 3: Calculate the discriminant.**

The discriminant (\(\Delta\)) is the part under the square root in the quadratic formula: 

\[
\Delta = b^2 - 4ac
\]

Substitute the values of \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\):

\[
\Delta = (-4)^2 - 4 \times 2 \times (-6) = 16 + 48 = 64
\]

**Step 4: Calculate the roots using the quadratic formula.**

Since the discriminant is positive (\(\Delta = 64\)), there are two real and distinct roots.

Substitute the values into the quadratic formula:

\[
x = \frac{-(-4) \pm \sqrt{64}}{2 \times 2}
\]

Simplify:

\[
x = \frac{4 \pm 8}{4}
\]

**Step 5: Solve for the two possible values of \(x\).**

1. \(x = \frac{4 + 8}{4} = \frac{12}{4} = 3\)

2. \(x = \frac{4 - 8}{4} = \frac{-4}{4} = -1\)

**Final Answer:**

The solutions to the quadratic equation \(2x^2 - 4x - 6 = 0\) are \(x = 3\) and \(x = -1\).
