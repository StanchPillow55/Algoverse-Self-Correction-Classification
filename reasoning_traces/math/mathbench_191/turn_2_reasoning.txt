==================================================

To solve "Sample math problem 191," we need to first understand what the problem is asking. Since the problem is not explicitly stated, I'll create a hypothetical math problem and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem 191:**

*Calculate the area of a triangle with a base of 10 units and a height of 5 units.*

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Formula for the Area of a Triangle:**

   The area \( A \) of a triangle can be calculated using the formula:
   \[
   A = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height}
   \]

2. **Identify the Given Values:**

   From the problem, we know:
   - The base of the triangle \( b = 10 \) units
   - The height of the triangle \( h = 5 \) units

3. **Substitute the Values into the Formula:**

   Plug the given values into the area formula:
   \[
   A = \frac{1}{2} \times 10 \times 5
   \]

4. **Perform the Multiplication:**

   First, multiply the base and the height:
   \[
   10 \times 5 = 50
   \]

5. **Calculate the Area:**

   Now, multiply the result by \(\frac{1}{2}\):
   \[
   A = \frac{1}{2} \times 50 = 25
   \]

6. **State the Final Answer:**

   The area of the triangle is \( 25 \) square units.

By following these steps, we have calculated the area of the triangle. If you have a specific "Sample math problem 191" in mind, please provide the details, and I can solve that particular problem for you.
