==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample math problem 209" refers to. However, since no specific details or context are provided for "Sample math problem 209," I'll create a hypothetical math problem and solve it step by step.

Let's assume "Sample math problem 209" is the following:

**Problem:**
Calculate the value of \( x \) in the equation \( 3x + 5 = 20 \).

**Solution:**

To solve for \( x \), we need to isolate the variable on one side of the equation. Here are the steps:

1. **Subtract 5 from both sides of the equation:**

   \[
   3x + 5 - 5 = 20 - 5
   \]

   Simplifying both sides gives:

   \[
   3x = 15
   \]

2. **Divide both sides by 3 to solve for \( x \):**

   \[
   \frac{3x}{3} = \frac{15}{3}
   \]

   Simplifying both sides gives:

   \[
   x = 5
   \]

**Verification:**

To ensure our solution is correct, we can substitute \( x = 5 \) back into the original equation and check if both sides are equal.

Original equation:

\[
3x + 5 = 20
\]

Substitute \( x = 5 \):

\[
3(5) + 5 = 20
\]

Calculate the left side:

\[
15 + 5 = 20
\]

Since both sides of the equation are equal, our solution is verified.

**Final Answer:**

The value of \( x \) is \( 5 \).
