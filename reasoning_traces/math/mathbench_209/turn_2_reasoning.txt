Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve "Sample math problem 209," we need to first understand what the problem entails. Since the problem statement is not explicitly given, I'll assume a generic math problem and solve it step by step. Let's assume the problem involves solving a quadratic equation, as this is a common type of math problem.

### Problem:
Solve the quadratic equation: \( x^2 - 5x + 6 = 0 \).

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Identify the Quadratic Equation:**
   The given quadratic equation is \( x^2 - 5x + 6 = 0 \).

2. **Factor the Quadratic Equation:**
   To factor the quadratic equation, we need to find two numbers that multiply to the constant term (6) and add up to the linear coefficient (-5).

   - The factors of 6 are: (1, 6) and (2, 3).
   - We need two numbers that multiply to 6 and add to -5. The numbers -2 and -3 satisfy this condition because:
     \[
     (-2) \times (-3) = 6 \quad \text{and} \quad (-2) + (-3) = -5
     \]

3. **Write the Factored Form:**
   Using the numbers found, we can write the factored form of the quadratic equation:
   \[
   x^2 - 5x + 6 = (x - 2)(x - 3) = 0
   \]

4. **Solve for the Roots:**
   Set each factor equal to zero and solve for \( x \):
   \[
   x - 2 = 0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad x = 2
   \]
   \[
   x - 3 = 0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad x = 3
   \]

5. **Verify the Solutions:**
   Substitute \( x = 2 \) and \( x = 3 \) back into the original equation to verify:
   - For \( x = 2 \):
     \[
     (2)^2 - 5(2) + 6 = 4 - 10 + 6 = 0
     \]
   - For \( x = 3 \):
     \[
     (3)^2 - 5(3) + 6 = 9 - 15 + 6 = 0
     \]

   Both solutions satisfy the original equation.

### Final Answer:
The solutions to the quadratic equation \( x^2 - 5x + 6 = 0 \) are \( x = 2 \) and \( x = 3 \).
