==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 209," we first need to understand what the problem is asking. However, the problem statement "Sample math problem 209" is not specific enough for us to determine the exact question or the type of math problem we are dealing with. Therefore, I will assume that "Sample math problem 209" refers to a specific problem from a textbook or a set of problems that is not provided here.

Since I do not have the details of "Sample math problem 209," I will demonstrate how to solve a generic math problem by creating a sample problem and solving it step by step. Let's assume "Sample math problem 209" is a basic algebra problem:

**Sample Problem:**
Solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 2x + 5 = 15 \).

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   We need to solve for the variable \( x \) in the equation \( 2x + 5 = 15 \).

2. **Isolate the Variable:**
   To solve for \( x \), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We can start by eliminating the constant term on the left side of the equation.

3. **Subtract 5 from Both Sides:**
   \[
   2x + 5 - 5 = 15 - 5
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   2x = 10
   \]

4. **Divide Both Sides by 2:**
   \[
   \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{10}{2}
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   x = 5
   \]

5. **Verify the Solution:**
   Substitute \( x = 5 \) back into the original equation to verify:
   \[
   2(5) + 5 = 15
   \]
   Simplifying the left side gives:
   \[
   10 + 5 = 15
   \]
   Since both sides of the equation are equal, our solution \( x = 5 \) is correct.

**Final Answer:**
The solution to the equation \( 2x + 5 = 15 \) is \( x = 5 \).
