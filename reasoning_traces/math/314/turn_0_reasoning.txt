To determine how many pages Berry needs to read on Saturday to reach his goal of reading an average of 50 pages a day over the week, we will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of pages he needs to read for the week.**
   Since there are 7 days in a week and Berry wants to average 50 pages per day, we can calculate the total pages needed as follows:

   \[
   \text{Total pages needed} = 50 \text{ pages/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 350 \text{ pages}
   \]

2. **Calculate the total number of pages he has read from Sunday to Friday.**
   We will add up the pages he read each day:

   - Sunday: 43 pages
   - Monday: 65 pages
   - Tuesday: 28 pages
   - Wednesday: 0 pages (no reading)
   - Thursday: 70 pages
   - Friday: 56 pages

   Now, we sum these values:

   \[
   \text{Total pages read} = 43 + 65 + 28 + 0 + 70 + 56
   \]

   Let's calculate this step by step:

   \[
   43 + 65 = 108
   \]
   \[
   108 + 28 = 136
   \]
   \[
   136 + 0 = 136
   \]
   \[
   136 + 70 = 206
   \]
   \[
   206 + 56 = 262
   \]

   Thus, the total number of pages Berry has read from Sunday to Friday is:

   \[
   \text{Total pages read} = 262 \text{ pages}
   \]

3. **Determine how many pages he needs to read on Saturday.**
   To find out how many pages Berry needs to read on Saturday, we subtract the total pages he has read from the total pages needed for the week:

   \[
   \text{Pages needed on Saturday} = \text{Total pages needed} - \text{Total pages read}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Pages needed on Saturday} = 350 - 262
   \]
   \[
   \text{Pages needed on Saturday} = 88
   \]

Therefore, Berry needs to read **88 pages** on Saturday to reach his goal of reading an average of 50 pages a day over the week.

**Final Answer: 88 pages**
