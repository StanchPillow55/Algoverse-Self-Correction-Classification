To solve this problem, we need to determine how many pages Berry needs to read on Saturday to achieve an average of 50 pages per day over the course of the week.

First, let's calculate the total number of pages Berry needs to read for the entire week to meet his goal. Since there are 7 days in a week, and he wants to average 50 pages per day, we calculate the total pages as follows:

\[
\text{Total pages needed} = 50 \text{ pages/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 350 \text{ pages}
\]

Next, we add up the pages Berry has already read from Sunday to Friday:

- Sunday: 43 pages
- Monday: 65 pages
- Tuesday: 28 pages
- Wednesday: 0 pages
- Thursday: 70 pages
- Friday: 56 pages

Now, let's calculate the total number of pages read from Sunday to Friday:

\[
43 + 65 + 28 + 0 + 70 + 56 = 262 \text{ pages}
\]

Berry has read 262 pages so far. To find out how many pages he needs to read on Saturday, we subtract the pages he has already read from the total pages needed:

\[
\text{Pages needed on Saturday} = 350 \text{ pages} - 262 \text{ pages} = 88 \text{ pages}
\]

Therefore, Berry needs to read 88 pages on Saturday to reach his goal of averaging 50 pages per day for the week.

**Final Answer: Berry needs to read 88 pages on Saturday.**
