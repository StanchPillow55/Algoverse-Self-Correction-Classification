==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to set up equations based on the information given about the football team members.

Let:
- \( d \) = number of players on the defense
- \( o \) = number of players on the offense
- \( s \) = number of players on the special teams

From the problem, we have the following relationships:

1. The total number of team members is 105:
   \[
   o + d + s = 105
   \]

2. There are twice as many players on the offense as there are on the defense:
   \[
   o = 2d
   \]

3. There is half the number of players on the special teams as there is on the defense:
   \[
   s = \frac{1}{2}d
   \]

Now we can substitute the expressions for \( o \) and \( s \) in terms of \( d \) into the total members equation.

Substituting \( o \) and \( s \) into the total equation:
\[
2d + d + \frac{1}{2}d = 105
\]

Now, combine the terms on the left side:
\[
(2d + d + \frac{1}{2}d) = 3d + \frac{1}{2}d
\]
To combine \( 3d \) and \( \frac{1}{2}d \), we can convert \( 3d \) into a fraction:
\[
3d = \frac{6}{2}d
\]
Thus,
\[
\frac{6}{2}d + \frac{1}{2}d = \frac{7}{2}d
\]

Now we have:
\[
\frac{7}{2}d = 105
\]

To solve for \( d \), multiply both sides by \( \frac{2}{7} \):
\[
d = 105 \times \frac{2}{7}
\]

Calculating the right side:
\[
d = 105 \div 7 \times 2 = 15 \times 2 = 30
\]

Now that we have \( d \), we can find \( o \) and \( s \):
1. Calculate \( o \):
   \[
   o = 2d = 2 \times 30 = 60
   \]

2. Calculate \( s \):
   \[
   s = \frac{1}{2}d = \frac{1}{2} \times 30 = 15
   \]

Finally, we can verify that the total number of players adds up to 105:
\[
o + d + s = 60 + 30 + 15 = 105
\]

Everything checks out, so the number of players on the defense is:
\[
\boxed{30}
\]
