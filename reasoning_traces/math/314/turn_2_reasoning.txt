==================================================

Let \( d \) represent the number of players on the defense. According to the problem, we have the following relationships:

1. The number of players on the offense is twice the number of players on the defense:
   \[
   o = 2d
   \]

2. The number of players on the special teams is half the number of players on the defense:
   \[
   s = \frac{1}{2}d
   \]

The total number of members on the team is given as 105. Therefore, we can express the total number of players in terms of \( d \):
\[
d + o + s = 105
\]

Substituting the expressions for \( o \) and \( s \) into the equation:
\[
d + 2d + \frac{1}{2}d = 105
\]

Now, combine the terms on the left side:
\[
3d + \frac{1}{2}d = 105
\]

To combine \( 3d \) and \( \frac{1}{2}d \), we can convert \( 3d \) into a fraction:
\[
3d = \frac{6}{2}d
\]
Thus, we have:
\[
\frac{6}{2}d + \frac{1}{2}d = 105
\]
\[
\frac{7}{2}d = 105
\]

Next, we solve for \( d \) by multiplying both sides by \( \frac{2}{7} \):
\[
d = 105 \times \frac{2}{7}
\]
Calculating the right side:
\[
d = 105 \div 7 \times 2 = 15 \times 2 = 30
\]

Thus, the number of players on the defense is:
\[
\boxed{30}
\]

To verify, we can calculate the number of players on the offense and special teams:
- Offense: \( o = 2d = 2 \times 30 = 60 \)
- Special Teams: \( s = \frac{1}{2}d = \frac{1}{2} \times 30 = 15 \)

Now, check the total:
\[
d + o + s = 30 + 60 + 15 = 105
\]

The calculations confirm that the total is correct, so the final answer is indeed:
\[
\boxed{30}
\]
