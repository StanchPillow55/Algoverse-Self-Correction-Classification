To solve the problem, I need more specific information about "Sample math problem 102." Since the problem statement is not provided, I'll demonstrate how to solve a generic math problem step by step. If you have a specific problem in mind, please provide the details.

Let's consider a sample math problem:

**Problem:** Solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).

**Step 1: Understand the problem.**

The equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \) is a linear equation in one variable. Our goal is to find the value of \( x \) that makes this equation true.

**Step 2: Isolate the variable.**

To solve for \( x \), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We can do this by performing inverse operations.

**Step 3: Perform inverse operations.**

1. **Subtract 3 from both sides** to eliminate the constant term on the left side:
   \[
   2x + 3 - 3 = 11 - 3
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   2x = 8
   \]

2. **Divide both sides by 2** to solve for \( x \):
   \[
   \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{8}{2}
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   x = 4
   \]

**Step 4: Verify the solution.**

Substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies the equation:
\[
2(4) + 3 = 11
\]
\[
8 + 3 = 11
\]
\[
11 = 11
\]

Since both sides of the equation are equal, our solution \( x = 4 \) is correct.

**Final Answer:**

The solution to the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \) is \( x = 4 \).

If you have a specific problem or need further assistance, please provide more details, and I'll be happy to help!
