==================================================

To solve "Sample math problem 102," we need to first understand what the problem is asking. Since the problem statement is not provided, I'll demonstrate how to approach a generic math problem by creating a sample problem and solving it step by step.

**Sample Problem:**
Calculate the area of a triangle with a base of 10 units and a height of 5 units.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Formula:**
   The area \( A \) of a triangle can be calculated using the formula:
   \[
   A = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height}
   \]

2. **Identify the Given Values:**
   - Base (\( b \)) = 10 units
   - Height (\( h \)) = 5 units

3. **Plug the Values into the Formula:**
   Substitute the given values into the area formula:
   \[
   A = \frac{1}{2} \times 10 \times 5
   \]

4. **Perform the Multiplication:**
   First, multiply the base and the height:
   \[
   10 \times 5 = 50
   \]

5. **Calculate the Area:**
   Now, multiply the result by \(\frac{1}{2}\):
   \[
   A = \frac{1}{2} \times 50 = 25
   \]

6. **State the Final Answer:**
   The area of the triangle is 25 square units.

By following these steps, we have calculated the area of the triangle using the given base and height. This approach can be applied to any similar problem involving the calculation of a triangle's area. If you have a specific "Sample math problem 102" in mind, please provide the details, and I can solve that particular problem for you.
