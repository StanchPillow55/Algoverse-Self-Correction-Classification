==================================================

To solve a math problem effectively, it's important to understand the problem, identify what is being asked, and then work through the solution step by step. Since the question provided is "Sample reasoning question 413" without specific details, I'll demonstrate a general approach to solving a math problem using a hypothetical example. Let's assume the problem involves solving a quadratic equation, which is a common type of math problem.

**Problem Example:**
Solve the quadratic equation: \(2x^2 - 4x - 6 = 0\).

**Step-by-step Solution:**

1. **Identify the type of equation:**
   The given equation is a quadratic equation of the form \(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\), where \(a = 2\), \(b = -4\), and \(c = -6\).

2. **Check if the equation can be factored:**
   To factor the quadratic equation, we look for two numbers that multiply to \(a \times c = 2 \times (-6) = -12\) and add to \(b = -4\).

   The numbers that satisfy these conditions are -6 and 2, because \(-6 \times 2 = -12\) and \(-6 + 2 = -4\).

3. **Rewrite the middle term using these numbers:**
   Rewrite \(-4x\) as \(-6x + 2x\):
   \[
   2x^2 - 6x + 2x - 6 = 0
   \]

4. **Factor by grouping:**
   Group the terms:
   \[
   (2x^2 - 6x) + (2x - 6) = 0
   \]

   Factor out the greatest common factor from each group:
   \[
   2x(x - 3) + 2(x - 3) = 0
   \]

5. **Factor out the common binomial factor:**
   \[
   (2x + 2)(x - 3) = 0
   \]

6. **Simplify the expression:**
   Factor out the common factor of 2 from the first term:
   \[
   2(x + 1)(x - 3) = 0
   \]

7. **Solve for the roots:**
   Set each factor equal to zero:
   \[
   x + 1 = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad x - 3 = 0
   \]

   Solve each equation:
   \[
   x = -1 \quad \text{or} \quad x = 3
   \]

8. **Verify the solutions:**
   Substitute \(x = -1\) and \(x = 3\) back into the original equation to verify:
   - For \(x = -1\):
     \[
     2(-1)^2 - 4(-1) - 6 = 2(1) + 4 - 6 = 0
     \]
   - For \(x = 3\):
     \[
     2(3)^2 - 4(3) - 6 = 2(9) - 12 - 6 = 18 - 18 = 0
     \]

   Both solutions satisfy the original equation.

**Final Answer:**
The solutions to the quadratic equation \(2x^2 - 4x - 6 = 0\) are \(x = -1\) and \(x = 3\).
