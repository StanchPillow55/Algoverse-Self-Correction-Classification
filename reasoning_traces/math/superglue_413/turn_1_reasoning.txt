==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 413" entails. Since the problem statement is not specific, I'll assume this is a hypothetical or placeholder question. Without specific details, I'll create a general approach to solving a typical math reasoning problem.

Let's assume "Sample reasoning question 413" involves a common type of math problem, such as solving an equation, analyzing a pattern, or working through a word problem. I'll choose a simple algebraic equation for demonstration purposes:

**Problem:** Solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).

**Step-by-step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Equation:**
   The equation given is \( 2x + 3 = 11 \). Our goal is to solve for \( x \).

2. **Isolate the Variable:**
   To solve for \( x \), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We start by eliminating the constant term on the left side.

   Subtract 3 from both sides:
   \[
   2x + 3 - 3 = 11 - 3
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   2x = 8
   \]

3. **Solve for \( x \):**
   Now, we need to isolate \( x \) by dividing both sides by the coefficient of \( x \), which is 2.

   Divide both sides by 2:
   \[
   \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{8}{2}
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   x = 4
   \]

4. **Verify the Solution:**
   To ensure our solution is correct, substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation and check if both sides are equal.

   Substitute \( x = 4 \) into \( 2x + 3 = 11 \):
   \[
   2(4) + 3 = 11
   \]
   Simplify the left side:
   \[
   8 + 3 = 11
   \]
   Since both sides are equal, our solution is verified.

**Final Answer:**
The solution to the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \) is \( x = 4 \).

This step-by-step approach demonstrates how to solve a basic algebraic equation. If "Sample reasoning question 413" refers to a different type of problem, please provide additional details for a more tailored solution.
