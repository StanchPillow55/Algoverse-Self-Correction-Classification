==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 413" refers to. Since the problem statement is not explicitly provided, I'll assume this is a placeholder for a specific type of reasoning or math problem. Without specific details, I'll create a hypothetical reasoning problem and solve it step-by-step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**
A train travels from City A to City B, a distance of 180 miles, at a constant speed. On the return trip, the train travels at a speed that is 20 miles per hour faster and takes 1 hour less than the trip from City A to City B. What is the speed of the train from City A to City B?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( x \) be the speed of the train from City A to City B in miles per hour.
   - The speed on the return trip is \( x + 20 \) miles per hour.

2. **Set Up Equations:**
   - The time taken to travel from City A to City B is \( \frac{180}{x} \) hours.
   - The time taken to return from City B to City A is \( \frac{180}{x + 20} \) hours.

3. **Use the Given Information:**
   - The return trip takes 1 hour less than the trip from City A to City B.
   - Therefore, we have the equation:
     \[
     \frac{180}{x} - \frac{180}{x + 20} = 1
     \]

4. **Solve the Equation:**
   - To eliminate the fractions, find a common denominator, which is \( x(x + 20) \):
     \[
     \frac{180(x + 20) - 180x}{x(x + 20)} = 1
     \]
   - Simplify the numerator:
     \[
     180x + 3600 - 180x = 3600
     \]
   - The equation becomes:
     \[
     \frac{3600}{x(x + 20)} = 1
     \]
   - Cross-multiply to solve for \( x \):
     \[
     3600 = x(x + 20)
     \]
   - Expand and rearrange the equation:
     \[
     x^2 + 20x - 3600 = 0
     \]

5. **Solve the Quadratic Equation:**
   - Use the quadratic formula \( x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \), where \( a = 1 \), \( b = 20 \), and \( c = -3600 \):
     \[
     x = \frac{-20 \pm \sqrt{20^2 - 4 \times 1 \times (-3600)}}{2 \times 1}
     \]
   - Calculate the discriminant:
     \[
     20^2 + 14400 = 14800
     \]
   - Calculate the square root:
     \[
     \sqrt{14800} = \sqrt{100 \times 148} = 10 \times \sqrt{148} \approx 121.66
     \]
   - Solve for \( x \):
     \[
     x = \frac{-20 \pm 121.66}{2}
     \]
   - The positive solution is:
     \[
     x = \frac{-20 + 121.66}{2} \approx \frac{101.66}{2} \approx 50.83
     \]

6. **Conclusion:**
   - The speed of the train from City A to City B is approximately 50.83 miles per hour.

**Final Answer:**
The speed of the train from City A to City B is approximately 50.83 miles per hour.
