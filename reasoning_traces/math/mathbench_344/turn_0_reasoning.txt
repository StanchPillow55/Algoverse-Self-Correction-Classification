To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample math problem 344" entails. Since the problem statement is not provided, I'll create a sample math problem and solve it step by step.

**Sample Math Problem 344:**

Calculate the area of a triangle with vertices at points A(2, 3), B(5, 11), and C(9, 7) in the coordinate plane.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

To find the area of a triangle given its vertices in the coordinate plane, we can use the formula:

\[
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \left| x_1(y_2-y_3) + x_2(y_3-y_1) + x_3(y_1-y_2) \right|
\]

where \((x_1, y_1)\), \((x_2, y_2)\), and \((x_3, y_3)\) are the coordinates of the vertices A, B, and C, respectively.

**Step 1: Identify the coordinates of the vertices.**

- \(A(2, 3)\) implies \(x_1 = 2\) and \(y_1 = 3\).
- \(B(5, 11)\) implies \(x_2 = 5\) and \(y_2 = 11\).
- \(C(9, 7)\) implies \(x_3 = 9\) and \(y_3 = 7\).

**Step 2: Substitute the coordinates into the area formula.**

\[
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \left| 2(11 - 7) + 5(7 - 3) + 9(3 - 11) \right|
\]

**Step 3: Perform the calculations inside the absolute value.**

- Calculate \(2(11 - 7)\):
  \[
  2 \times 4 = 8
  \]

- Calculate \(5(7 - 3)\):
  \[
  5 \times 4 = 20
  \]

- Calculate \(9(3 - 11)\):
  \[
  9 \times (-8) = -72
  \]

**Step 4: Sum the results.**

\[
8 + 20 - 72 = -44
\]

**Step 5: Apply the absolute value and multiply by \(\frac{1}{2}\).**

\[
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times |-44| = \frac{1}{2} \times 44 = 22
\]

**Final Answer:**

The area of the triangle with vertices at points A(2, 3), B(5, 11), and C(9, 7) is 22 square units.
