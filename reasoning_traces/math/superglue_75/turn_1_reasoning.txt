==================================================

To solve the problem, I need more information about "Sample reasoning question 75." Since the question is not provided, I will demonstrate how to approach a typical math problem step-by-step. Let's assume a sample problem and solve it.

**Sample Problem:**

A car travels from City A to City B at a speed of 60 miles per hour and returns from City B to City A at a speed of 40 miles per hour. If the total travel time is 5 hours, what is the distance between City A and City B?

**Step-by-step Solution:**

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( d \) be the distance between City A and City B in miles.
   - The speed from City A to City B is 60 mph.
   - The speed from City B to City A is 40 mph.
   - The total travel time is 5 hours.

2. **Set Up Equations:**
   - Time taken to travel from City A to City B: \( \frac{d}{60} \) hours.
   - Time taken to travel from City B to City A: \( \frac{d}{40} \) hours.
   - Total travel time: \( \frac{d}{60} + \frac{d}{40} = 5 \).

3. **Solve the Equation:**
   - Find a common denominator for the fractions: The least common multiple of 60 and 40 is 120.
   - Rewrite the equation with the common denominator:
     \[
     \frac{d}{60} = \frac{2d}{120}, \quad \frac{d}{40} = \frac{3d}{120}
     \]
   - Combine the fractions:
     \[
     \frac{2d}{120} + \frac{3d}{120} = \frac{5d}{120} = 5
     \]
   - Simplify the equation:
     \[
     \frac{5d}{120} = 5
     \]
   - Multiply both sides by 120 to clear the fraction:
     \[
     5d = 600
     \]
   - Divide both sides by 5 to solve for \( d \):
     \[
     d = \frac{600}{5} = 120
     \]

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The distance between City A and City B is 120 miles.

**Final Answer:**
The distance between City A and City B is 120 miles.
