Question ID: superglue_75
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we first need to understand what "Sample reasoning question 75" refers to. Since the problem statement does not provide any specific details or context about this question, we need to make some assumptions or create a hypothetical problem to solve.

Let's assume "Sample reasoning question 75" is a math problem involving basic arithmetic or algebra. I'll create a hypothetical problem and solve it step by step.

### Hypothetical Problem:
**Question 75:** If \( x + 5 = 12 \), what is the value of \( x \)?

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Understand the Equation:**
   The equation given is \( x + 5 = 12 \). This is a simple linear equation where we need to solve for the variable \( x \).

2. **Isolate the Variable:**
   To find the value of \( x \), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We can do this by performing the same operation on both sides of the equation to maintain equality.

3. **Subtract 5 from Both Sides:**
   \[
   x + 5 - 5 = 12 - 5
   \]
   Simplifying both sides, we get:
   \[
   x = 7
   \]

4. **Verify the Solution:**
   To ensure our solution is correct, we substitute \( x = 7 \) back into the original equation:
   \[
   7 + 5 = 12
   \]
   Since both sides of the equation are equal, our solution is verified.

### Final Answer:
The value of \( x \) is 7.

This completes the solution to the hypothetical problem based on the given instruction. If "Sample reasoning question 75" refers to a different problem, please provide more details or context for an accurate solution.
