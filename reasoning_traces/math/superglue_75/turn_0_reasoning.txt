==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 75" refers to. Since the question is not explicitly provided, I'll assume it's a typical math problem that requires logical reasoning and problem-solving skills. Let's create a sample problem and solve it step by step.

**Sample Problem:**
A train travels from Town A to Town B at a speed of 60 miles per hour. After reaching Town B, it immediately returns to Town A at a speed of 40 miles per hour. The total travel time for the round trip is 5 hours. What is the distance between Town A and Town B?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( d \) be the distance between Town A and Town B in miles.

2. **Calculate Time for Each Leg of the Trip:**
   - The time taken to travel from Town A to Town B is given by the formula:
     \[
     \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{d}{60} \text{ hours}
     \]
   - The time taken to return from Town B to Town A is:
     \[
     \text{Time} = \frac{d}{40} \text{ hours}
     \]

3. **Set Up the Equation for Total Time:**
   - The total time for the round trip is the sum of the times for each leg of the trip:
     \[
     \frac{d}{60} + \frac{d}{40} = 5
     \]

4. **Solve the Equation:**
   - To solve for \( d \), we first find a common denominator for the fractions, which is 120:
     \[
     \frac{d}{60} = \frac{2d}{120}, \quad \frac{d}{40} = \frac{3d}{120}
     \]
   - Substitute these into the equation:
     \[
     \frac{2d}{120} + \frac{3d}{120} = 5
     \]
   - Combine the fractions:
     \[
     \frac{5d}{120} = 5
     \]
   - Multiply both sides by 120 to clear the fraction:
     \[
     5d = 600
     \]
   - Divide both sides by 5 to solve for \( d \):
     \[
     d = 120
     \]

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The distance between Town A and Town B is 120 miles.

**Final Answer:**
The distance between Town A and Town B is 120 miles.
