==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 75" refers to. Since the problem statement is not specific, I'll assume it's a placeholder for a typical math reasoning problem. Let's create a sample problem and solve it step by step.

**Sample Problem:**

A train travels from City A to City B, a distance of 300 miles. The train travels the first half of the distance at a speed of 60 miles per hour and the second half at a speed of 40 miles per hour. What is the average speed of the train for the entire trip?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - Total distance = 300 miles.
   - Distance for each half = 300 miles / 2 = 150 miles.
   - Speed for the first half = 60 mph.
   - Speed for the second half = 40 mph.
   - We need to find the average speed for the entire trip.

2. **Calculate Time for Each Half:**
   - Time for the first half = Distance / Speed = 150 miles / 60 mph = 2.5 hours.
   - Time for the second half = Distance / Speed = 150 miles / 40 mph = 3.75 hours.

3. **Calculate Total Time:**
   - Total time = Time for first half + Time for second half = 2.5 hours + 3.75 hours = 6.25 hours.

4. **Calculate Average Speed:**
   - Average speed is defined as the total distance traveled divided by the total time taken.
   - Average speed = Total distance / Total time = 300 miles / 6.25 hours = 48 mph.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The average speed of the train for the entire trip is 48 miles per hour.

**Final Answer:**

The average speed of the train for the entire trip is 48 miles per hour.
