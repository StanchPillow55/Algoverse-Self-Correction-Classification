==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to determine how many trays of eggnog Rozanne can prepare based on the number of eggs she has and the number of eggs required for each glass of eggnog.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of eggs.**

Rozanne uses:
- 4 dozen eggs
- 2 loose eggs

First, we need to convert the dozen into individual eggs. Since 1 dozen equals 12 eggs, we calculate the number of eggs in 4 dozen:

\[
4 \text{ dozen} = 4 \times 12 = 48 \text{ eggs}
\]

Now, we add the 2 loose eggs:

\[
\text{Total eggs} = 48 \text{ eggs} + 2 \text{ eggs} = 50 \text{ eggs}
\]

**Step 2: Determine how many glasses of eggnog can be made.**

Each glass of eggnog requires 5 eggs. To find out how many glasses can be made with 50 eggs, we divide the total number of eggs by the number of eggs needed per glass:

\[
\text{Number of glasses} = \frac{50 \text{ eggs}}{5 \text{ eggs/glass}} = 10 \text{ glasses}
\]

**Step 3: Calculate how many trays can be put out.**

Each tray holds 5 glasses of eggnog. To find out how many trays can be filled with 10 glasses, we divide the total number of glasses by the number of glasses per tray:

\[
\text{Number of trays} = \frac{10 \text{ glasses}}{5 \text{ glasses/tray}} = 2 \text{ trays}
\]

**Final Answer:**

Rozanne can put out **2 trays** of eggnog.
