==================================================

To find the total number of books in the classroom, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of books the children have.**
   - There are 10 children, and each child has 7 books.
   - To find the total number of books that the children have, we multiply the number of children by the number of books each child has:
     \[
     \text{Total books from children} = \text{Number of children} \times \text{Books per child} = 10 \times 7
     \]
   - Performing the multiplication:
     \[
     10 \times 7 = 70
     \]
   - So, the children have a total of 70 books.

2. **Add the number of books the teacher brings.**
   - The teacher brings an additional 8 books to the classroom.
   - To find the total number of books in the classroom, we add the books from the children to the books brought by the teacher:
     \[
     \text{Total books in classroom} = \text{Total books from children} + \text{Books from teacher} = 70 + 8
     \]
   - Performing the addition:
     \[
     70 + 8 = 78
     \]

3. **State the final answer.**
   - Therefore, the total number of books in the classroom altogether is:
     \[
     \boxed{78}
     \]
