==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of books in the classroom by considering the books the children have and the additional books brought by the teacher.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of books the children have.**

- There are 10 children in the classroom.
- Each child has 7 books.

To find the total number of books the children have, we multiply the number of children by the number of books each child has:

\[
10 \text{ children} \times 7 \text{ books per child} = 70 \text{ books}
\]

So, the children have a total of 70 books.

**Step 2: Calculate the total number of books brought by the teacher.**

- The teacher brings 8 additional books to the classroom.

**Step 3: Calculate the total number of books in the classroom.**

To find the total number of books in the classroom, we add the number of books the children have to the number of books the teacher brings:

\[
70 \text{ books (children)} + 8 \text{ books (teacher)} = 78 \text{ books}
\]

Thus, the total number of books in the classroom is 78.

**Final Answer:**

The total number of books in the classroom is 78.
