To solve the problem, we need to determine how much Jenny spends on the roses, how much money she has initially, and how much change she receives in quarters.

### Step 1: Calculate the cost of the roses

Jenny buys 15 roses. We have two pricing options for the roses:
- Individual price: $2 each
- Dozen price: $15 for 12 roses

First, we calculate the cost if she buys 15 roses at the individual price:
\[
\text{Cost for 15 roses} = 15 \times 2 = 30 \text{ dollars}
\]

Next, we can also consider the cost if she buys them in dozens. She can buy 12 roses for $15 and then 3 additional roses at $2 each:
\[
\text{Cost for 12 roses} = 15 \text{ dollars}
\]
\[
\text{Cost for 3 additional roses} = 3 \times 2 = 6 \text{ dollars}
\]
\[
\text{Total cost} = 15 + 6 = 21 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Step 2: Determine how much money Jenny has

Jenny arrives with five $5 bills:
\[
\text{Total money} = 5 \times 5 = 25 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the change Jenny receives

Now we can calculate how much change Jenny will receive after her purchase:
\[
\text{Change} = \text{Total money} - \text{Total cost}
\]
\[
\text{Change} = 25 - 21 = 4 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Step 4: Convert the change to quarters

Since the florist only has quarters for change, we need to convert the $4 into quarters. Each quarter is worth $0.25, so we calculate the number of quarters in $4:
\[
\text{Number of quarters} = \frac{4 \text{ dollars}}{0.25 \text{ dollars per quarter}} = 4 \div 0.25 = 16
\]

### Final Answer

Thus, the number of quarters Jenny leaves with is:
\[
\boxed{16}
\]
