==================================================

To solve the problem effectively, I need to first understand the context and details of "Sample reasoning question 32." Since the question itself is not provided, I'll demonstrate a general approach to solving a typical math reasoning problem by outlining the steps and providing a hypothetical example.

### Hypothetical Problem:
**Question:** A farmer has a rectangular field that is twice as long as it is wide. If the perimeter of the field is 300 meters, what are the dimensions of the field?

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We have a rectangular field.
   - The length (L) is twice the width (W).
   - The perimeter (P) of the rectangle is 300 meters.

2. **Set Up the Equations:**
   - The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is \( P = 2L + 2W \).
   - Given \( L = 2W \), substitute \( L \) in the perimeter formula:
     \[
     P = 2(2W) + 2W = 4W + 2W = 6W
     \]
   - We know \( P = 300 \), so:
     \[
     6W = 300
     \]

3. **Solve for Width (W):**
   - Divide both sides by 6 to find \( W \):
     \[
     W = \frac{300}{6} = 50
     \]

4. **Find the Length (L):**
   - Since \( L = 2W \):
     \[
     L = 2 \times 50 = 100
     \]

5. **Verify the Solution:**
   - Check the perimeter with the found dimensions:
     \[
     P = 2L + 2W = 2(100) + 2(50) = 200 + 100 = 300
     \]
   - The calculated perimeter matches the given perimeter, confirming the solution is correct.

6. **State the Final Answer:**
   - The dimensions of the field are 100 meters in length and 50 meters in width.

### Conclusion:
By following a structured approach to understanding the problem, setting up equations, solving them, and verifying the solution, we determined the dimensions of the farmer's field. This methodical process ensures accuracy and clarity in solving math reasoning problems.
