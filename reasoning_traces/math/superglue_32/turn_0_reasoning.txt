==================================================

To solve the problem, we first need to understand what "Sample reasoning question 32" refers to. Since the problem statement is not provided, I'll demonstrate a general approach to solving a typical math problem by creating a hypothetical example. Let's assume "Sample reasoning question 32" is a math problem involving algebra. Here's how we might approach it:

### Hypothetical Problem:
Solve for \( x \) in the equation: 
\[ 3x + 5 = 20 \]

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Understand the Equation**: 
   The equation \( 3x + 5 = 20 \) is a linear equation in one variable, \( x \).

2. **Isolate the Variable**:
   To solve for \( x \), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We start by eliminating the constant term on the left side.

3. **Subtract 5 from Both Sides**:
   \[
   3x + 5 - 5 = 20 - 5
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   3x = 15
   \]

4. **Divide by the Coefficient of \( x \)**:
   The next step is to divide both sides by 3, the coefficient of \( x \), to solve for \( x \).
   \[
   \frac{3x}{3} = \frac{15}{3}
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   x = 5
   \]

5. **Verify the Solution**:
   Substitute \( x = 5 \) back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies the equation.
   \[
   3(5) + 5 = 20
   \]
   \[
   15 + 5 = 20
   \]
   \[
   20 = 20
   \]
   The left side equals the right side, confirming that \( x = 5 \) is the correct solution.

### Final Answer:
The solution to the equation \( 3x + 5 = 20 \) is \( x = 5 \).

This approach demonstrates a systematic method for solving a linear equation. If you have a specific problem in mind, please provide the details, and I can tailor the solution to that particular problem.
