To solve this problem effectively, I'll need more specific information about "Sample reasoning question 32." Since the problem statement is not provided, I'll demonstrate a general approach to solving a typical math reasoning problem. If you have a specific problem in mind, please provide the details, and I'll be happy to assist you with that.

Let's consider a hypothetical math reasoning problem:

**Problem:**
A farmer has a rectangular field that is twice as long as it is wide. If the perimeter of the field is 300 meters, what are the dimensions of the field?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We have a rectangular field.
   - The length (L) is twice the width (W).
   - The perimeter (P) of the rectangle is 300 meters.

2. **Set Up the Equations:**
   - The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is \( P = 2L + 2W \).
   - We know \( L = 2W \) (since the length is twice the width).
   - Substitute \( L = 2W \) into the perimeter formula: 
     \[
     300 = 2(2W) + 2W
     \]

3. **Simplify and Solve the Equation:**
   - Simplify the equation:
     \[
     300 = 4W + 2W
     \]
     \[
     300 = 6W
     \]
   - Solve for W:
     \[
     W = \frac{300}{6} = 50
     \]

4. **Find the Length:**
   - Since \( L = 2W \), substitute \( W = 50 \) into the equation for L:
     \[
     L = 2 \times 50 = 100
     \]

5. **Verify the Solution:**
   - Check the perimeter with the found dimensions:
     \[
     P = 2L + 2W = 2(100) + 2(50) = 200 + 100 = 300
     \]
   - The calculated perimeter matches the given perimeter, confirming our solution is correct.

6. **State the Final Answer:**
   - The dimensions of the field are 100 meters in length and 50 meters in width.
