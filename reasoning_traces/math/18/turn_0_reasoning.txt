==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to calculate the total time Roque spends walking and biking to and from work in a week.

### Step 1: Calculate the time spent walking
Roque walks to work and back home three times a week. 

- **Time to walk one way**: 2 hours
- **Time to walk round trip (to and from work)**: 
  \[
  2 \text{ hours (to work)} + 2 \text{ hours (back home)} = 4 \text{ hours}
  \]

- **Total time walking in a week**: 
  \[
  4 \text{ hours (round trip)} \times 3 \text{ days} = 12 \text{ hours}
  \]

### Step 2: Calculate the time spent biking
Roque rides his bike to work and back home two times a week.

- **Time to bike one way**: 1 hour
- **Time to bike round trip (to and from work)**: 
  \[
  1 \text{ hour (to work)} + 1 \text{ hour (back home)} = 2 \text{ hours}
  \]

- **Total time biking in a week**: 
  \[
  2 \text{ hours (round trip)} \times 2 \text{ days} = 4 \text{ hours}
  \]

### Step 3: Calculate the total time for the week
Now, we add the total time spent walking and biking:

- **Total time in a week**: 
  \[
  12 \text{ hours (walking)} + 4 \text{ hours (biking)} = 16 \text{ hours}
  \]

### Final Answer
Roque takes a total of **16 hours** to get to and from work in a week with walking and biking.
