==================================================

First, let's calculate the total time Roque spends walking to and from work in a week. 

He walks to work and back 3 times a week, and each round trip takes 2 hours to get to work and 2 hours to get back. So, the total time he spends walking is:

3 days * (2 hours to work + 2 hours from work) = 3 days * 4 hours = 12 hours.

Next, let's calculate the total time Roque spends biking to and from work in a week. 

He bikes to work and back 2 times a week, and each round trip takes 1 hour to get to work and 1 hour to get back. So, the total time he spends biking is:

2 days * (1 hour to work + 1 hour from work) = 2 days * 2 hours = 4 hours.

Finally, to find the total time Roque spends getting to and from work in a week, we add the time he spends walking and the time he spends biking:

12 hours walking + 4 hours biking = 16 hours.

So, Roque spends a total of 16 hours getting to and from work in a week.
