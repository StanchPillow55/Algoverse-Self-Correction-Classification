==================================================

To solve the problem effectively, I need to first understand what "Sample math problem 11" entails. Since the problem isn't explicitly stated, I'll demonstrate how to approach a generic math problem by outlining a step-by-step method. Let's assume "Sample math problem 11" is a typical algebra problem. Here's how I would solve it:

**Problem Statement:**
Solve for \( x \) in the equation: \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We are given a linear equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).
   - Our goal is to find the value of \( x \) that makes this equation true.

2. **Isolate the Variable:**
   - To solve for \( x \), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We start by eliminating the constant term on the left side.
   - Subtract 3 from both sides of the equation:
     \[
     2x + 3 - 3 = 11 - 3
     \]
     \[
     2x = 8
     \]

3. **Solve for \( x \):**
   - Now, we need to isolate \( x \) by getting rid of the coefficient 2. We do this by dividing both sides of the equation by 2:
     \[
     \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{8}{2}
     \]
     \[
     x = 4
     \]

4. **Verify the Solution:**
   - Substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies the equation:
     \[
     2(4) + 3 = 11
     \]
     \[
     8 + 3 = 11
     \]
   - Since both sides of the equation are equal, our solution \( x = 4 \) is correct.

5. **State the Final Answer:**
   - The solution to the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \) is \( x = 4 \).

By following these steps, we have successfully solved the problem. If "Sample math problem 11" refers to a different problem, please provide the specific details or context, and I can adjust the solution accordingly.
