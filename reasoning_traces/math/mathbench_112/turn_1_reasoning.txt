==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 112," we need to first understand what the problem entails. However, since "Sample math problem 112" is not a specific problem statement, I'll create a hypothetical math problem for demonstration purposes and solve it step-by-step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**
Calculate the sum of all even numbers between 1 and 112, inclusive.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Identify the Even Numbers:**
   - Even numbers are integers divisible by 2.
   - The sequence of even numbers between 1 and 112 is: 2, 4, 6, ..., 112.

2. **Determine the Sequence:**
   - This is an arithmetic sequence where the first term \( a_1 = 2 \) and the last term \( a_n = 112 \).
   - The common difference \( d = 2 \).

3. **Find the Number of Terms (n):**
   - The general formula for the \( n \)-th term of an arithmetic sequence is:
     \[
     a_n = a_1 + (n-1) \cdot d
     \]
   - Plugging in the known values:
     \[
     112 = 2 + (n-1) \cdot 2
     \]
   - Simplify and solve for \( n \):
     \[
     112 = 2 + 2n - 2
     \]
     \[
     112 = 2n
     \]
     \[
     n = \frac{112}{2} = 56
     \]

4. **Calculate the Sum of the Sequence:**
   - The sum \( S_n \) of the first \( n \) terms of an arithmetic sequence is given by:
     \[
     S_n = \frac{n}{2} \cdot (a_1 + a_n)
     \]
   - Substitute the known values:
     \[
     S_{56} = \frac{56}{2} \cdot (2 + 112)
     \]
     \[
     S_{56} = 28 \cdot 114
     \]

5. **Perform the Multiplication:**
   - Calculate \( 28 \times 114 \):
     \[
     28 \times 114 = 28 \times (100 + 14) = 28 \times 100 + 28 \times 14
     \]
     \[
     = 2800 + 392 = 3192
     \]

**Final Answer:**
The sum of all even numbers between 1 and 112 is \( \boxed{3192} \).
