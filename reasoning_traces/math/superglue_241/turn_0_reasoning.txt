==================================================

To solve the problem, I need more specific information about "Sample reasoning question 241." Since the question is not provided, I'll demonstrate how to approach a typical math problem by solving an example problem. Let's consider a sample math problem and work through it step by step.

**Example Problem:**
Find the value of \( x \) in the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).

**Step-by-step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   The equation given is \( 2x + 3 = 11 \). We need to solve for \( x \).

2. **Isolate the Variable:**
   To find the value of \( x \), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We can do this by performing operations that will leave \( x \) alone on one side.

3. **Subtract 3 from Both Sides:**
   Start by eliminating the constant term on the side with the variable. Subtract 3 from both sides of the equation:
   \[
   2x + 3 - 3 = 11 - 3
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   2x = 8
   \]

4. **Divide by 2:**
   Now, divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( x \):
   \[
   \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{8}{2}
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   x = 4
   \]

5. **Verify the Solution:**
   Substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies the equation:
   \[
   2(4) + 3 = 11
   \]
   Simplifying the left side gives:
   \[
   8 + 3 = 11
   \]
   Since both sides of the equation are equal, our solution is verified.

**Final Answer:**
The value of \( x \) is 4.

This is a demonstration of how to solve a simple linear equation. If you have a specific problem or question in mind, please provide the details, and I can work through that problem for you.
