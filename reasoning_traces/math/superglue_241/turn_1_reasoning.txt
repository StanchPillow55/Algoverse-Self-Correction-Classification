==================================================

To solve this problem, let's first understand what "Sample reasoning question 241" might entail. Since the problem is not explicitly defined, I'll create a hypothetical math problem and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**

Let's assume "Sample reasoning question 241" is a math problem involving algebraic expressions. Here's the problem:

**Problem:**  
Solve for \( x \) in the equation:  
\[ 3x + 5 = 2x + 9 \]

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Equation:**
   The given equation is \( 3x + 5 = 2x + 9 \). We need to find the value of \( x \) that makes this equation true.

2. **Isolate the Variable:**
   To solve for \( x \), we need to get all terms involving \( x \) on one side of the equation and constant terms on the other side.

3. **Subtract \( 2x \) from Both Sides:**
   \[
   3x + 5 - 2x = 2x + 9 - 2x
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   x + 5 = 9
   \]

4. **Subtract 5 from Both Sides:**
   \[
   x + 5 - 5 = 9 - 5
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   x = 4
   \]

5. **Verify the Solution:**
   Substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies the equation:
   \[
   3(4) + 5 = 2(4) + 9
   \]
   Simplifying both sides:
   \[
   12 + 5 = 8 + 9
   \]
   \[
   17 = 17
   \]
   Since both sides of the equation are equal, \( x = 4 \) is indeed the correct solution.

**Final Answer:**

The solution to the equation \( 3x + 5 = 2x + 9 \) is \( x = 4 \).
