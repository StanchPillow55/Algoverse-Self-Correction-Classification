==================================================

Certainly! Let's tackle the problem step by step. However, it seems like the problem statement is incomplete or unclear with "Sample reasoning question 241". Since there's no specific math problem provided, I'll demonstrate how to approach a typical math problem by creating a sample problem and solving it.

**Sample Problem:**

"Calculate the area of a triangle with a base of 10 units and a height of 5 units."

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We need to find the area of a triangle.
   - The formula for the area of a triangle is: 
     \[
     \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height}
     \]
   - We are given:
     - Base = 10 units
     - Height = 5 units

2. **Substitute the Known Values:**
   - Plug the values of the base and height into the formula:
     \[
     \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times 10 \times 5
     \]

3. **Perform the Calculations:**
   - First, multiply the base and the height:
     \[
     10 \times 5 = 50
     \]
   - Then, multiply by \(\frac{1}{2}\):
     \[
     \frac{1}{2} \times 50 = 25
     \]

4. **State the Final Answer:**
   - The area of the triangle is 25 square units.

**Conclusion:**

By following these steps, we calculated the area of the triangle to be 25 square units. This approach can be applied to any similar problem involving the calculation of a triangle's area when the base and height are known. If you have a specific problem or need further assistance, please provide more details!
