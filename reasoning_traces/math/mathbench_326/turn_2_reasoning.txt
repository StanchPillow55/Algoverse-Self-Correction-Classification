Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve "Sample math problem 326," we need to first understand what the problem is asking. Since the problem isn't explicitly stated, I'll assume a hypothetical math problem and solve it step by step. Let's assume the problem is as follows:

**Problem Statement:**
Solve for \( x \) in the equation: 
\[ 2x + 5 = 17 \]

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Equation:**
   The equation given is a linear equation in one variable, \( x \). Our goal is to isolate \( x \) on one side of the equation to find its value.

2. **Subtract 5 from Both Sides:**
   To isolate the term with \( x \), we first need to eliminate the constant term on the left side. We do this by subtracting 5 from both sides of the equation:
   \[
   2x + 5 - 5 = 17 - 5
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   2x = 12
   \]

3. **Divide Both Sides by 2:**
   Now, we need to solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides of the equation by 2:
   \[
   \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{12}{2}
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   x = 6
   \]

4. **Verify the Solution:**
   To ensure our solution is correct, we substitute \( x = 6 \) back into the original equation:
   \[
   2(6) + 5 = 17
   \]
   Simplifying the left side:
   \[
   12 + 5 = 17
   \]
   Since both sides of the equation are equal, our solution \( x = 6 \) is verified.

**Final Answer:**
The solution to the equation \( 2x + 5 = 17 \) is \( x = 6 \).
