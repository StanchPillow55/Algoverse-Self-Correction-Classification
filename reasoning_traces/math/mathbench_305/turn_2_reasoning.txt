Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 305," we first need to understand what the problem is asking. However, the problem statement "Sample math problem 305" is not specific enough for us to determine the exact question or mathematical operation required. 

Since the problem is not clearly defined, let's assume that "Sample math problem 305" refers to a specific math problem that involves the number 305. Without additional context, we can explore a few possibilities of what this problem might involve:

1. **Basic Arithmetic Operations:**
   - If the problem involves basic arithmetic operations with the number 305, we might be asked to perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division.
   - Example: Calculate \( 305 + 100 \).
     - Solution: \( 305 + 100 = 405 \).

2. **Prime Factorization:**
   - If the problem involves finding the prime factorization of 305, we would break it down into its prime factors.
   - Solution: 
     - 305 is an odd number, so it is not divisible by 2.
     - The sum of the digits of 305 is \( 3 + 0 + 5 = 8 \), which is not divisible by 3, so 305 is not divisible by 3.
     - 305 ends in a 5, so it is divisible by 5.
     - Dividing 305 by 5 gives \( 305 \div 5 = 61 \).
     - 61 is a prime number.
     - Therefore, the prime factorization of 305 is \( 5 \times 61 \).

3. **Solving an Equation:**
   - If the problem involves solving an equation where 305 is a part of the equation, we would solve for the unknown variable.
   - Example: Solve for \( x \) in the equation \( x + 305 = 500 \).
     - Solution: Subtract 305 from both sides to isolate \( x \).
     - \( x = 500 - 305 = 195 \).

4. **Finding a Percentage:**
   - If the problem involves finding a percentage of 305, we would calculate that percentage.
   - Example: Find 20% of 305.
     - Solution: \( 0.20 \times 305 = 61 \).

Without a specific problem statement, we cannot definitively solve "Sample math problem 305." However, based on the assumptions above, we have explored several potential mathematical operations involving the number 305.

If you have a specific math problem involving 305, please provide additional details so that I can assist you further.
