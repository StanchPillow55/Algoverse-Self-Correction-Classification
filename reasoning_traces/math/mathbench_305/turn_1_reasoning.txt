Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 305," we need to first understand what the problem is asking. However, the problem statement "Sample math problem 305" is not specific enough for us to determine the exact question or the mathematical operations involved. Therefore, I will assume this is a placeholder for a typical math problem and create a hypothetical problem to solve.

Let's assume "Sample math problem 305" refers to a problem involving basic algebra. Here is a hypothetical problem:

**Problem:**
Solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 3x + 5 = 20 \).

**Solution:**

To solve the equation \( 3x + 5 = 20 \), we need to isolate the variable \( x \). We can do this by performing the following steps:

1. **Subtract 5 from both sides of the equation** to eliminate the constant term on the left side:
   \[
   3x + 5 - 5 = 20 - 5
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   3x = 15
   \]

2. **Divide both sides by 3** to solve for \( x \):
   \[
   \frac{3x}{3} = \frac{15}{3}
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   x = 5
   \]

**Verification:**

To ensure our solution is correct, we can substitute \( x = 5 \) back into the original equation and verify that both sides are equal:

Original equation:
\[
3x + 5 = 20
\]

Substitute \( x = 5 \):
\[
3(5) + 5 = 20
\]

Calculate the left side:
\[
15 + 5 = 20
\]

Since both sides of the equation are equal, our solution is verified.

**Final Answer:**
The solution to the equation \( 3x + 5 = 20 \) is \( x = 5 \).
