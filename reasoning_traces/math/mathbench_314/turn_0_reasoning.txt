To solve the problem, we first need to understand what "Sample math problem 314" refers to. Since there is no specific problem statement provided, I will assume a hypothetical math problem involving the number 314. Let's consider a problem involving basic arithmetic operations with the number 314.

**Problem:**  
Calculate the sum of the digits of the number 314, then multiply the result by 2, and finally subtract 10 from the product. What is the final result?

**Step-by-step Solution:**

1. **Identify the digits of the number 314.**  
   The number 314 consists of the digits: 3, 1, and 4.

2. **Calculate the sum of the digits.**  
   Sum = 3 + 1 + 4

   \[
   \text{Sum} = 3 + 1 + 4 = 8
   \]

3. **Multiply the sum by 2.**  
   Product = 8 Ã— 2

   \[
   \text{Product} = 8 \times 2 = 16
   \]

4. **Subtract 10 from the product.**  
   Result = 16 - 10

   \[
   \text{Result} = 16 - 10 = 6
   \]

**Final Answer:**  
The final result after performing all the operations is 6.
