Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 314," we need to first understand what the problem entails. Since the problem is not explicitly stated, let's assume a hypothetical problem involving the number 314. A common type of problem involving numbers is to perform operations or analyze properties of the number. Let's consider a few possibilities:

### Problem 1: Sum of the Digits
Let's find the sum of the digits of the number 314.

**Step 1: Identify the digits.**
- The number 314 consists of the digits 3, 1, and 4.

**Step 2: Sum the digits.**
- Add the digits together: \(3 + 1 + 4\).

**Calculation:**
\[ 3 + 1 + 4 = 8 \]

**Conclusion:**
The sum of the digits of 314 is 8.

### Problem 2: Check if 314 is a Prime Number
Let's determine if 314 is a prime number.

**Step 1: Understand what a prime number is.**
- A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.

**Step 2: Check divisibility.**
- A quick check for divisibility by small prime numbers (2, 3, 5, 7, 11, etc.) is a good start.

**Step 3: Check divisibility by 2.**
- A number is divisible by 2 if its last digit is even. The last digit of 314 is 4, which is even.

**Conclusion:**
Since 314 is divisible by 2, it is not a prime number.

### Problem 3: Factorization of 314
Let's find the prime factorization of 314.

**Step 1: Divide by the smallest prime number, 2.**
- Since 314 is even, divide by 2: \(314 \div 2 = 157\).

**Step 2: Check if 157 is a prime number.**
- Check divisibility by prime numbers up to the square root of 157 (approximately 12.53).

- 157 is not divisible by 2 (it's odd), 3 (sum of digits 1+5+7=13, not divisible by 3), 5 (does not end in 0 or 5), 7 (157 divided by 7 is not an integer), or 11 (alternating sum of digits 1-5+7=3, not divisible by 11).

**Conclusion:**
157 is a prime number.

**Final Factorization:**
The prime factorization of 314 is \(2 \times 157\).

### Final Answer
Based on the hypothetical problems considered, here are the answers:
1. The sum of the digits of 314 is 8.
2. 314 is not a prime number.
3. The prime factorization of 314 is \(2 \times 157\).
