Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we first need to understand what "Sample math problem 314" refers to. Since the problem is not explicitly stated, I'll assume it's a placeholder for a typical math problem. Let's create a sample problem and solve it step by step.

**Sample Problem:**
Calculate the sum of the first 314 positive integers.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   We need to find the sum of the first 314 positive integers. The sequence of these integers is: 1, 2, 3, ..., 314.

2. **Identify the Formula:**
   The sum of the first \( n \) positive integers can be calculated using the formula:
   \[
   S = \frac{n(n + 1)}{2}
   \]
   where \( S \) is the sum and \( n \) is the number of terms.

3. **Substitute the Values:**
   In this problem, \( n = 314 \). Substitute 314 into the formula:
   \[
   S = \frac{314(314 + 1)}{2}
   \]

4. **Calculate the Expression:**
   First, calculate \( 314 + 1 \):
   \[
   314 + 1 = 315
   \]

   Next, calculate the product \( 314 \times 315 \):
   \[
   314 \times 315 = 98910
   \]

   Finally, divide by 2 to find the sum:
   \[
   S = \frac{98910}{2} = 49455
   \]

5. **Verify the Calculation:**
   To ensure accuracy, let's verify the multiplication:
   - Break down \( 314 \times 315 \) using the distributive property:
     \[
     314 \times 315 = 314 \times (300 + 15) = 314 \times 300 + 314 \times 15
     \]
   - Calculate each part:
     \[
     314 \times 300 = 94200
     \]
     \[
     314 \times 15 = 4710
     \]
   - Add the results:
     \[
     94200 + 4710 = 98910
     \]
   - Divide by 2:
     \[
     \frac{98910}{2} = 49455
     \]

6. **Conclusion:**
   The sum of the first 314 positive integers is \( 49455 \).

**Final Answer:**
The sum of the first 314 positive integers is \( 49455 \).
