Question ID: mathbench_314
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we first need to understand what "Sample math problem 314" refers to. Since no specific details are provided about the content of "Sample math problem 314," let's assume it is a generic math problem. Without specific details, I will create a hypothetical math problem labeled as "Sample math problem 314" and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**
"Sample math problem 314: Solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 2x + 5 = 17 \)."

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Equation:**
   The given equation is \( 2x + 5 = 17 \). Our goal is to solve for \( x \).

2. **Isolate the Variable:**
   To solve for \( x \), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We start by eliminating the constant term on the left side of the equation.

   \[
   2x + 5 = 17
   \]

   Subtract 5 from both sides to remove the constant term:

   \[
   2x + 5 - 5 = 17 - 5
   \]

   Simplifying both sides gives:

   \[
   2x = 12
   \]

3. **Solve for \( x \):**
   Now, we need to solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides of the equation by the coefficient of \( x \), which is 2.

   \[
   \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{12}{2}
   \]

   Simplifying both sides gives:

   \[
   x = 6
   \]

4. **Verify the Solution:**
   To ensure our solution is correct, we substitute \( x = 6 \) back into the original equation and check if both sides are equal.

   \[
   2(6) + 5 = 17
   \]

   Calculate the left side:

   \[
   12 + 5 = 17
   \]

   Since both sides of the equation are equal, our solution is verified.

**Final Answer:**
The solution to the equation \( 2x + 5 = 17 \) is \( x = 6 \).
