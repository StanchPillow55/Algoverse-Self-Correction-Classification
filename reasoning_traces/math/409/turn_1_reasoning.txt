==================================================

To determine how many cars Frank needs to sell in the remaining days to meet his quota of 50 cars, we will break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate the total number of cars sold in the first 3 days:**
   - Frank sold 5 cars each day for 3 days.
   - Total cars sold in the first 3 days = 5 cars/day * 3 days = 15 cars.

2. **Calculate the total number of cars sold in the next 4 days:**
   - Frank sold 3 cars each day for 4 days.
   - Total cars sold in the next 4 days = 3 cars/day * 4 days = 12 cars.

3. **Calculate the total number of cars sold in the first 7 days:**
   - Total cars sold in the first 7 days = Cars sold in the first 3 days + Cars sold in the next 4 days.
   - Total cars sold in the first 7 days = 15 cars + 12 cars = 27 cars.

4. **Determine how many cars Frank still needs to sell to meet his quota:**
   - Frank's sales quota is 50 cars.
   - Cars still needed = Quota - Total cars sold in the first 7 days.
   - Cars still needed = 50 cars - 27 cars = 23 cars.

5. **Calculate the number of remaining days in the month:**
   - The month has 30 days, and Frank has already sold cars for 7 days.
   - Remaining days = 30 days - 7 days = 23 days.

6. **Determine how many cars Frank needs to sell per day in the remaining days:**
   - To find out how many cars he needs to sell each day for the remaining 23 days to meet his quota, we divide the number of cars still needed by the number of remaining days.
   - Cars needed per day = Cars still needed / Remaining days.
   - Cars needed per day = 23 cars / 23 days = 1 car/day.

**Final Answer:**
Frank needs to sell **1 car per day** for the remaining 23 days to meet his quota of 50 cars.
