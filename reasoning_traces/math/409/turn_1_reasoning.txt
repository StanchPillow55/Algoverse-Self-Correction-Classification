To solve this problem, we need to determine how many cars Frank still needs to sell to meet his quota after accounting for the cars he has already sold.

**Step 1: Determine the total quota.**

Frank's quota is to sell 50 cars in 30 days.

**Step 2: Calculate the number of cars sold in the first 3 days.**

Frank sold 5 cars each day for the first 3 days. Therefore, the total number of cars sold in the first 3 days is:

\[ 5 \text{ cars/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 15 \text{ cars} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the number of cars sold in the next 4 days.**

Frank sold 3 cars each day for the next 4 days. Therefore, the total number of cars sold in these 4 days is:

\[ 3 \text{ cars/day} \times 4 \text{ days} = 12 \text{ cars} \]

**Step 4: Calculate the total number of cars sold so far.**

Add the cars sold in the first 3 days to the cars sold in the next 4 days:

\[ 15 \text{ cars} + 12 \text{ cars} = 27 \text{ cars} \]

**Step 5: Determine how many cars Frank still needs to sell.**

Frank's quota is 50 cars, and he has already sold 27 cars. Therefore, the number of cars he still needs to sell is:

\[ 50 \text{ cars} - 27 \text{ cars} = 23 \text{ cars} \]

**Step 6: Calculate the number of remaining days.**

Frank has already worked for 3 + 4 = 7 days. Therefore, the number of remaining days in the month is:

\[ 30 \text{ days} - 7 \text{ days} = 23 \text{ days} \]

**Conclusion:**

Frank needs to sell 23 more cars in the remaining 23 days to meet his quota. This means he needs to sell, on average, 1 car per day for the rest of the month.

**Final Answer:**

Frank needs to sell 23 more cars in the remaining 23 days to meet his quota.
