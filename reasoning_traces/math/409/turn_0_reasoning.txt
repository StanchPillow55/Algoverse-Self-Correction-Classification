To solve the problem, we need to determine how many cars Frank has sold so far and how many more he needs to sell in order to meet his quota of 50 cars by the end of the month.

1. **Calculate the total number of cars sold in the first three days:**
   - Frank sold 5 cars each day for the first 3 days.
   \[
   \text{Cars sold in first 3 days} = 5 \text{ cars/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 15 \text{ cars}
   \]

2. **Calculate the total number of cars sold in the next four days:**
   - Frank sold 3 cars each day for the next 4 days.
   \[
   \text{Cars sold in next 4 days} = 3 \text{ cars/day} \times 4 \text{ days} = 12 \text{ cars}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total number of cars sold so far:**
   - Add the cars sold in the first 3 days and the next 4 days.
   \[
   \text{Total cars sold so far} = 15 \text{ cars} + 12 \text{ cars} = 27 \text{ cars}
   \]

4. **Determine how many cars Frank needs to sell to meet his quota:**
   - Frank's quota is 50 cars. We subtract the number of cars he has already sold from his quota.
   \[
   \text{Cars needed to meet quota} = 50 \text{ cars} - 27 \text{ cars} = 23 \text{ cars}
   \]

5. **Calculate the number of days remaining in the month:**
   - Frank has already sold cars for 7 days (3 days + 4 days), so the number of days remaining is:
   \[
   \text{Remaining days} = 30 \text{ days} - 7 \text{ days} = 23 \text{ days}
   \]

6. **Determine how many cars Frank needs to sell per day for the remaining days:**
   - To find out how many cars he needs to sell each day for the remaining 23 days, we divide the number of cars he still needs to sell by the number of days remaining.
   \[
   \text{Cars needed per day} = \frac{23 \text{ cars}}{23 \text{ days}} = 1 \text{ car/day}
   \]

Thus, Frank needs to sell **1 car per day** for the remaining 23 days to meet his quota of 50 cars by the end of the month.

**Final Answer: Frank needs to sell 1 car per day for the remaining days.**
