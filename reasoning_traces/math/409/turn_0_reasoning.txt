To solve this problem, we need to determine how many cars Frank needs to sell over the remaining days of the month to meet his quota of 50 cars.

### Step-by-step Solution:

1. **Determine the Total Quota:**
   - Frank's total sales quota for the month is 50 cars.

2. **Calculate Cars Sold in the First 3 Days:**
   - Frank sold 5 cars each day for the first 3 days.
   - Total cars sold in the first 3 days = \(5 \text{ cars/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 15 \text{ cars}\).

3. **Calculate Cars Sold in the Next 4 Days:**
   - Frank sold 3 cars each day for the next 4 days.
   - Total cars sold in the next 4 days = \(3 \text{ cars/day} \times 4 \text{ days} = 12 \text{ cars}\).

4. **Calculate Total Cars Sold So Far:**
   - Total cars sold in the first 7 days = Cars sold in the first 3 days + Cars sold in the next 4 days.
   - Total cars sold so far = \(15 \text{ cars} + 12 \text{ cars} = 27 \text{ cars}\).

5. **Determine Remaining Cars to be Sold:**
   - Frank needs to sell a total of 50 cars to meet his quota.
   - Remaining cars to be sold = Total quota - Total cars sold so far.
   - Remaining cars to be sold = \(50 \text{ cars} - 27 \text{ cars} = 23 \text{ cars}\).

6. **Calculate Remaining Days:**
   - Total days in the month = 30 days.
   - Days already passed = 7 days.
   - Remaining days = Total days in the month - Days already passed.
   - Remaining days = \(30 \text{ days} - 7 \text{ days} = 23 \text{ days}\).

7. **Determine Cars to be Sold per Remaining Day:**
   - Frank needs to sell 23 cars over the remaining 23 days.
   - Cars to be sold per day = Remaining cars to be sold / Remaining days.
   - Cars to be sold per day = \(23 \text{ cars} / 23 \text{ days} = 1 \text{ car/day}\).

### Final Answer:
Frank needs to sell 1 car per day for the remaining 23 days to meet his quota of 50 cars for the month.
