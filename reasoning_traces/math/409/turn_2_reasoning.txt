==================================================

To determine how many cars Frank needs to sell in the remaining days to meet his quota, we can break down the problem step by step.

1. **Total Quota**: Frank needs to sell a total of 50 cars in 30 days.

2. **Sales in the First 3 Days**: 
   - Frank sold 5 cars each day for the first 3 days.
   - Total cars sold in the first 3 days = 5 cars/day × 3 days = 15 cars.

3. **Sales in the Next 4 Days**: 
   - Frank sold 3 cars each day for the next 4 days.
   - Total cars sold in the next 4 days = 3 cars/day × 4 days = 12 cars.

4. **Total Cars Sold So Far**:
   - Total cars sold = Cars sold in the first 3 days + Cars sold in the next 4 days
   - Total cars sold = 15 cars + 12 cars = 27 cars.

5. **Remaining Cars to Sell**:
   - Cars remaining to meet the quota = Total quota - Total cars sold so far
   - Cars remaining = 50 cars - 27 cars = 23 cars.

6. **Remaining Days**:
   - Total days in the month = 30 days.
   - Days already passed = 3 days + 4 days = 7 days.
   - Remaining days = 30 days - 7 days = 23 days.

7. **Cars Needed to Sell Per Day**:
   - To find out how many cars Frank needs to sell per day for the remaining days:
   - Cars needed per day = Cars remaining / Remaining days
   - Cars needed per day = 23 cars / 23 days = 1 car/day.

Thus, Frank needs to sell **1 car per day** for the remaining 23 days to meet his quota of 50 cars.

**Final Answer**: Frank needs to sell 1 car per day for the remaining days.
