Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to calculate the total amount of money the company paid to the employees in May and June. We will break this down step by step.

### Step 1: Calculate the total payment for May

1. **Number of employees hired**: 40
2. **Hourly wage per employee**: $15
3. **Hours worked per week**: 40

First, we calculate the weekly payment for one employee:
\[
\text{Weekly payment per employee} = \text{Hourly wage} \times \text{Hours worked}
\]
\[
\text{Weekly payment per employee} = 15 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 40 \, \text{hours} = 600 \, \text{dollars}
\]

Next, we calculate the total payment for all employees in May:
\[
\text{Total payment for May} = \text{Weekly payment per employee} \times \text{Number of employees}
\]
\[
\text{Total payment for May} = 600 \, \text{dollars} \times 40 = 24000 \, \text{dollars}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the total payment for June

In June, 1/4 of the employees' contracts expired. We need to find out how many employees are left after 1/4 of them leave.

1. **Number of employees leaving**:
\[
\text{Number of employees leaving} = \frac{1}{4} \times 40 = 10
\]

2. **Number of employees remaining**:
\[
\text{Number of employees remaining} = 40 - 10 = 30
\]

Now, we calculate the total payment for the remaining employees in June:
\[
\text{Total payment for June} = \text{Weekly payment per employee} \times \text{Number of employees remaining}
\]
\[
\text{Total payment for June} = 600 \, \text{dollars} \times 30 = 18000 \, \text{dollars}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the total payment for both months

Now we add the total payments for May and June to find the overall total:
\[
\text{Total payment for both months} = \text{Total payment for May} + \text{Total payment for June}
\]
\[
\text{Total payment for both months} = 24000 \, \text{dollars} + 18000 \, \text{dollars} = 42000 \, \text{dollars}
\]

### Final Answer

The total amount of money the company paid to the employees in the two months is:
\[
\boxed{42000 \, \text{dollars}}
\]
