==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 277" refers to. Since the question itself is not provided, I will assume this is a placeholder for a typical math problem. Let's create a sample math problem and solve it step-by-step.

**Sample Problem:**

A farmer has a rectangular field that is 100 meters long and 60 meters wide. He wants to build a fence around the field and also divide the field into two equal parts with a fence parallel to the shorter side. Calculate the total length of the fence required.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We have a rectangular field.
   - Dimensions of the field: Length = 100 meters, Width = 60 meters.
   - We need to fence around the perimeter and also add a fence to divide the field into two equal parts parallel to the shorter side.

2. **Calculate the Perimeter of the Field:**
   - The formula for the perimeter \( P \) of a rectangle is given by:
     \[
     P = 2 \times (\text{Length} + \text{Width})
     \]
   - Substituting the given values:
     \[
     P = 2 \times (100 + 60) = 2 \times 160 = 320 \text{ meters}
     \]

3. **Calculate the Length of the Dividing Fence:**
   - The field is divided into two equal parts parallel to the shorter side (width).
   - Therefore, the dividing fence will be along the length of the field.
   - Length of the dividing fence = Length of the field = 100 meters.

4. **Calculate the Total Length of the Fence Required:**
   - Total fence length = Perimeter of the field + Length of the dividing fence
   - Total fence length = 320 meters + 100 meters = 420 meters

5. **Final Answer:**
   - The total length of the fence required is 420 meters.

By following these steps, we have calculated the total length of the fence needed for the farmer's field. The key was to carefully consider both the perimeter and the additional dividing fence.
