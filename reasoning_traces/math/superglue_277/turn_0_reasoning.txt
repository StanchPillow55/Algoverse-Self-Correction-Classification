To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 277" entails. Since the problem statement is not fully provided, I'll assume it's a typical math problem that requires logical reasoning and calculations. Let's create a hypothetical problem and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**

A company produces two types of widgets: Type A and Type B. The production cost for Type A is $5 per unit, and for Type B, it is $8 per unit. The company sells Type A widgets for $10 each and Type B widgets for $15 each. The company has a production budget of $800 and wants to maximize its profit. How many of each type of widget should the company produce to maximize profit, assuming all produced widgets are sold?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( x \) be the number of Type A widgets produced.
   - Let \( y \) be the number of Type B widgets produced.

2. **Set Up the Cost Equation:**
   - The total production cost is given by the equation:
     \[
     5x + 8y \leq 800
     \]
   - This equation represents the budget constraint.

3. **Set Up the Profit Equation:**
   - The profit from selling Type A widgets is \( 10x - 5x = 5x \).
   - The profit from selling Type B widgets is \( 15y - 8y = 7y \).
   - The total profit is:
     \[
     P = 5x + 7y
     \]

4. **Objective:**
   - Maximize the profit \( P = 5x + 7y \) subject to the constraint \( 5x + 8y \leq 800 \).

5. **Graphical Method to Solve:**
   - First, solve the constraint equation for \( y \):
     \[
     8y \leq 800 - 5x \quad \Rightarrow \quad y \leq \frac{800 - 5x}{8}
     \]
   - Plot the line \( 5x + 8y = 800 \) on a graph.
   - Identify the feasible region that satisfies \( 5x + 8y \leq 800 \) and \( x, y \geq 0 \).

6. **Find Corner Points:**
   - The line intersects the axes at:
     - \( x = 0 \): \( 8y = 800 \Rightarrow y = 100 \)
     - \( y = 0 \): \( 5x = 800 \Rightarrow x = 160 \)
   - The corner points of the feasible region are \( (0, 0) \), \( (0, 100) \), and \( (160, 0) \).

7. **Calculate Profit at Each Corner Point:**
   - At \( (0, 0) \): \( P = 5(0) + 7(0) = 0 \)
   - At \( (0, 100) \): \( P = 5(0) + 7(100) = 700 \)
   - At \( (160, 0) \): \( P = 5(160) + 7(0) = 800 \)

8. **Determine Maximum Profit:**
   - The maximum profit is \( 800 \) at the point \( (160, 0) \).

**Final Answer:**
To maximize profit, the company should produce 160 Type A widgets and 0 Type B widgets, resulting in a maximum profit of $800.
