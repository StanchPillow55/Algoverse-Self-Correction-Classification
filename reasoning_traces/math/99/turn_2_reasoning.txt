Question ID: 99
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, let's find out the size of the second tank. Since the first tank is twice the size of the second tank and the first tank is 48 gallons, the second tank must be 48/2 = 24 gallons.

Next, let's find out how many fish each tank can hold. Gail follows the rule of one gallon of water per inch of fish. So, in the second tank, which is 24 gallons, she can keep 24/2 = 12 two-inch fish. In the first tank, which is 48 gallons, she can keep 48/3 = 16 three-inch fish.

However, the problem states that one of the fish in the first tank eats another. This means that there is one less fish in the first tank, so there are now 16 - 1 = 15 fish in the first tank.

Finally, let's find out how many more fish Gail would have in the first tank than the second tank. The difference is 15 - 12 = 3 fish.

So, Gail would have 3 more fish in the first tank than the second tank if one of the first tank fish eats another.
