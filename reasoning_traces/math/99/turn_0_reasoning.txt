To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the size of the second tank**: 
   We know that the first tank is twice the size of the second tank. Since the first tank has 48 gallons of water, we can find the size of the second tank by dividing the size of the first tank by 2.

   \[
   \text{Size of the second tank} = \frac{48 \text{ gallons}}{2} = 24 \text{ gallons}
   \]

2. **Calculate the number of fish in the first tank**:
   The first tank has 48 gallons of water, and Gail keeps three-inch fish in this tank. According to the rule of one gallon of water per inch of fish, we can calculate the total number of inches of fish that can be accommodated in the first tank.

   \[
   \text{Total inches of fish in the first tank} = 48 \text{ gallons} = 48 \text{ inches of fish}
   \]

   Since each fish is three inches long, we can find the number of fish in the first tank by dividing the total inches of fish by the size of each fish.

   \[
   \text{Number of fish in the first tank} = \frac{48 \text{ inches}}{3 \text{ inches per fish}} = 16 \text{ fish}
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of fish in the second tank**:
   The second tank has 24 gallons of water, and Gail keeps two-inch fish in this tank. Using the same rule, we can calculate the total number of inches of fish that can be accommodated in the second tank.

   \[
   \text{Total inches of fish in the second tank} = 24 \text{ gallons} = 24 \text{ inches of fish}
   \]

   Since each fish is two inches long, we can find the number of fish in the second tank by dividing the total inches of fish by the size of each fish.

   \[
   \text{Number of fish in the second tank} = \frac{24 \text{ inches}}{2 \text{ inches per fish}} = 12 \text{ fish}
   \]

4. **Determine the difference in the number of fish**:
   Now we need to find out how many more fish are in the first tank than in the second tank. 

   \[
   \text{Difference in number of fish} = \text{Number of fish in the first tank} - \text{Number of fish in the second tank}
   \]

   \[
   \text{Difference} = 16 \text{ fish} - 12 \text{ fish} = 4 \text{ fish}
   \]

5. **Consider the scenario where one fish eats another**:
   If one of the fish in the first tank eats another fish, the number of fish in the first tank will decrease by one.

   \[
   \text{New number of fish in the first tank} = 16 - 1 = 15 \text{ fish}
   \]

6. **Calculate the new difference**:
   Now we need to find the new difference in the number of fish after one fish has been eaten.

   \[
   \text{New difference} = \text{New number of fish in the first tank} - \text{Number of fish in the second tank}
   \]

   \[
   \text{New difference} = 15 \text{ fish} - 12 \text{ fish} = 3 \text{ fish}
   \]

Finally, the answer to the question is that after one fish in the first tank eats another, Gail would have **3 more fish in the first tank than in the second tank**.

**Final Answer: 3**
