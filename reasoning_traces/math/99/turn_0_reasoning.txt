==================================================

Let's start by figuring out the size of the second tank. Since the first tank is twice the size of the second tank and the first tank is 48 gallons, the second tank must be 48/2 = 24 gallons.

Next, let's figure out how many fish each tank can hold. Gail follows the rule of one gallon of water per inch of fish. So, in the second tank, which holds 24 gallons, she can keep 24/2 = 12 two-inch fish. In the first tank, which holds 48 gallons, she can keep 48/3 = 16 three-inch fish.

However, if one of the fish in the first tank eats another, then there would be one less fish in the first tank. So, the first tank would then hold 16 - 1 = 15 fish.

Finally, to find out how many more fish Gail would have in the first tank than the second tank, we subtract the number of fish in the second tank from the number of fish in the first tank. So, 15 - 12 = 3.

Therefore, Gail would have 3 more fish in the first tank than the second tank if one of the first tank fish eats another.
