To solve the problem, we will break it down into steps and perform the necessary calculations.

1. **Calculate the total number of potted plants Mary currently has:**
   - Mary has 2 potted plants on each of the 40 window ledges.
   - To find the total number of potted plants on the ledges, we multiply the number of plants per ledge by the number of ledges:
     \[
     \text{Total plants on ledges} = 2 \text{ plants/ledge} \times 40 \text{ ledges} = 80 \text{ plants}
     \]

2. **Add the new potted plants Mary received:**
   - Mary received 18 new potted plants from the nursery.
   - We add these new plants to the total number of plants she already has:
     \[
     \text{Total plants after receiving new ones} = 80 \text{ plants} + 18 \text{ plants} = 98 \text{ plants}
     \]

3. **Determine how many plants Mary will give away:**
   - Mary plans to give 1 potted plant from each of the 40 ledges to friends and family.
   - Therefore, the total number of plants she will give away is:
     \[
     \text{Total plants given away} = 1 \text{ plant/ledge} \times 40 \text{ ledges} = 40 \text{ plants}
     \]

4. **Calculate the number of potted plants Mary will have left:**
   - To find out how many plants Mary will have remaining after giving away the 40 plants, we subtract the number of plants given away from the total number of plants she has:
     \[
     \text{Remaining plants} = 98 \text{ plants} - 40 \text{ plants} = 58 \text{ plants}
     \]

Thus, after performing all the calculations and reasoning through the problem, we find that Mary will remain with **58 potted plants**.

Final answer: **58**
