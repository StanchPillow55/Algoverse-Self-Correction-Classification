Question ID: 99
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

Let's start by figuring out the size of the second tank. Since the first tank is twice the size of the second tank and the first tank is 48 gallons, the second tank must be 48/2 = 24 gallons.

Next, let's figure out how many fish Gail can keep in each tank. Since she follows the rule of one gallon of water per inch of fish, she can keep 24 two-inch fish in the second tank (because 24 gallons / 2 inches per fish = 12 fish) and 48 three-inch fish in the first tank (because 48 gallons / 3 inches per fish = 16 fish).

However, if one of the fish in the first tank eats another, there would be one less fish in that tank. So, the number of fish in the first tank would be 16 - 1 = 15 fish.

Finally, to find out how many more fish Gail would have in the first tank than the second tank, we subtract the number of fish in the second tank from the number of fish in the first tank. So, 15 fish - 12 fish = 3 fish.

Therefore, Gail would have 3 more fish in the first tank than the second tank if one of the first tank fish eats another.
