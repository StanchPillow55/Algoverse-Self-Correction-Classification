==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 363" refers to. Since the question is not explicitly provided, I'll demonstrate how to approach a generic math problem by outlining a structured method for solving it. Let's assume a sample math problem and work through it step by step.

**Sample Problem:**

Let's say the problem is: "Solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \)."

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We need to find the value of \( x \) that satisfies the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).

2. **Isolate the Variable:**
   - To solve for \( x \), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We start by eliminating the constant term on the left side of the equation.
   - Subtract 3 from both sides of the equation:
     \[
     2x + 3 - 3 = 11 - 3
     \]
     \[
     2x = 8
     \]

3. **Solve for \( x \):**
   - Now, divide both sides of the equation by 2 to solve for \( x \):
     \[
     \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{8}{2}
     \]
     \[
     x = 4
     \]

4. **Verify the Solution:**
   - Substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies the equation:
     \[
     2(4) + 3 = 11
     \]
     \[
     8 + 3 = 11
     \]
   - The left side equals the right side, confirming that \( x = 4 \) is the correct solution.

5. **State the Final Answer:**
   - The solution to the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \) is \( x = 4 \).

By following these steps, we have systematically solved the problem. If you have a specific problem labeled "Sample reasoning question 363," please provide the details, and I can work through that specific problem using a similar structured approach.
