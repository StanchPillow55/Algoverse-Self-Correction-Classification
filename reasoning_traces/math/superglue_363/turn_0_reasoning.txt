==================================================

It seems like you've referenced a "Sample reasoning question 363," but without specific details or context about the problem, I'm unable to provide a direct solution. However, I can guide you through a general approach to solving math problems, which you can apply to your specific question once you have the details.

### General Approach to Solving Math Problems

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - Carefully read the problem statement.
   - Identify what is being asked.
   - Determine what information is given and what needs to be found.

2. **Devise a Plan:**
   - Consider possible strategies to solve the problem, such as:
     - Drawing a diagram.
     - Writing an equation.
     - Breaking the problem into smaller parts.
     - Looking for patterns.

3. **Carry Out the Plan:**
   - Execute the chosen strategy step by step.
   - Perform calculations carefully.
   - Keep track of units and ensure consistency.

4. **Review/Check Your Work:**
   - Verify each step of your solution.
   - Check if the final answer makes sense in the context of the problem.
   - Consider alternative methods to confirm your result.

5. **State the Final Answer:**
   - Clearly present the solution to the problem.
   - Include units if applicable.

### Example Problem and Solution

To illustrate, let's consider a simple example problem:

**Example Problem:**
A rectangle has a length of 10 units and a width of 5 units. What is the area of the rectangle?

**Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We need to find the area of a rectangle.
   - The formula for the area of a rectangle is \( \text{Area} = \text{length} \times \text{width} \).

2. **Devise a Plan:**
   - Use the formula for the area of a rectangle.

3. **Carry Out the Plan:**
   - Substitute the given values into the formula:
     \[
     \text{Area} = 10 \, \text{units} \times 5 \, \text{units} = 50 \, \text{square units}
     \]

4. **Review/Check Your Work:**
   - The calculation \( 10 \times 5 = 50 \) is correct.
   - The units are consistent, resulting in square units for area.

5. **State the Final Answer:**
   - The area of the rectangle is 50 square units.
