To solve the problem, we need to determine the total duration of the songs in 20 playlists, given that each playlist contains 300 songs and each song is 10 hours long.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of songs in 20 playlists.**

Each playlist has 300 songs. Therefore, the total number of songs in 20 playlists can be calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Total songs} = \text{Number of playlists} \times \text{Number of songs per playlist}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\text{Total songs} = 20 \times 300 = 6000 \text{ songs}
\]

**Step 2: Calculate the total duration of all songs.**

Each song is 10 hours long. To find the total duration of all 6000 songs, we multiply the total number of songs by the duration of each song:

\[
\text{Total duration (in hours)} = \text{Total songs} \times \text{Duration of each song}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\text{Total duration} = 6000 \times 10 = 60000 \text{ hours}
\]

**Final Answer:**

The total duration of the 20 playlists is **60000 hours**.
