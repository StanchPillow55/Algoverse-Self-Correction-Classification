To solve the problem, we will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the amount of the loan John receives.**
2. **Determine how much of that loan he uses to pay off his debts.**
3. **Calculate how much money he has left after paying off his debts.**

### Step 1: Calculate the amount of the loan

John's house is worth $250,000. He gets a loan worth 40% of that value.

\[
\text{Loan Amount} = 40\% \text{ of } 250,000
\]

To find 40% of $250,000, we convert the percentage to a decimal and multiply:

\[
\text{Loan Amount} = 0.40 \times 250,000
\]

Calculating this gives:

\[
\text{Loan Amount} = 0.40 \times 250,000 = 100,000
\]

So, John receives a loan of **$100,000**.

### Step 2: Determine how much he uses to pay off debts

John uses 60% of the loan amount to pay off his debts.

\[
\text{Debt Payment} = 60\% \text{ of } 100,000
\]

Again, we convert the percentage to a decimal and multiply:

\[
\text{Debt Payment} = 0.60 \times 100,000
\]

Calculating this gives:

\[
\text{Debt Payment} = 0.60 \times 100,000 = 60,000
\]

So, John uses **$60,000** to pay off his debts.

### Step 3: Calculate how much money he has left

To find out how much money John has left after paying off his debts, we subtract the amount he used to pay off debts from the total loan amount.

\[
\text{Money Left} = \text{Loan Amount} - \text{Debt Payment}
\]

Substituting the values we calculated:

\[
\text{Money Left} = 100,000 - 60,000
\]

Calculating this gives:

\[
\text{Money Left} = 40,000
\]

### Final Answer

John has **$40,000** left after paying off his debts.
