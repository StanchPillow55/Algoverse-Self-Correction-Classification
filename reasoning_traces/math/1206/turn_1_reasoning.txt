Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem step by step, we will first calculate the amount of the loan John receives based on the value of his house, then determine how much he uses to pay off his debts, and finally find out how much money he has left over after paying those debts.

1. **Calculate the loan amount:**
   - The value of John's house is $250,000.
   - He gets a loan worth 40% of that value.
   - To find 40% of $250,000, we use the formula:
     \[
     \text{Loan Amount} = \text{House Value} \times \text{Percentage}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Loan Amount} = 250,000 \times 0.40
     \]
     \[
     \text{Loan Amount} = 100,000
     \]

2. **Determine how much he uses to pay off debts:**
   - John uses 60% of the loan amount to pay off his debts.
   - To find 60% of $100,000, we use the same formula:
     \[
     \text{Debt Payment} = \text{Loan Amount} \times \text{Percentage}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Debt Payment} = 100,000 \times 0.60
     \]
     \[
     \text{Debt Payment} = 60,000
     \]

3. **Calculate how much money he has left over:**
   - To find out how much money John has left after paying off his debts, we subtract the amount he used to pay off debts from the total loan amount:
     \[
     \text{Money Left Over} = \text{Loan Amount} - \text{Debt Payment}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Money Left Over} = 100,000 - 60,000
     \]
     \[
     \text{Money Left Over} = 40,000
     \]

Thus, after paying off his debts, John has **$40,000** left over.

**Final Answer: $40,000**
