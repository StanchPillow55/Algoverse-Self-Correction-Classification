To solve the problem "Sample math problem 265," I need more specific information about what the problem entails. Since the problem is not explicitly stated, I'll create a sample math problem involving the number 265 and solve it step by step.

**Sample Math Problem:**

Find the sum of the digits of the number 265, then multiply the result by 3. What is the final result?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Identify the digits of the number 265:**
   - The number 265 consists of the digits 2, 6, and 5.

2. **Calculate the sum of the digits:**
   - Add the digits together: \(2 + 6 + 5\).

   \[
   2 + 6 = 8
   \]

   \[
   8 + 5 = 13
   \]

   So, the sum of the digits is 13.

3. **Multiply the sum by 3:**
   - Take the sum obtained in the previous step and multiply it by 3.

   \[
   13 \times 3 = 39
   \]

4. **State the final result:**
   - The final result after multiplying the sum of the digits of 265 by 3 is 39.

Therefore, the final answer is 39.
