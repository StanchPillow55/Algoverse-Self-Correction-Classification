==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 265," we first need to understand what the problem is asking. However, the problem statement "Sample math problem 265" is not specific enough to determine the exact nature of the problem. It seems like a placeholder or reference to a specific problem that is not provided here.

To proceed, let's assume that "Sample math problem 265" refers to a typical math problem that could be found in a textbook or exam. Since we don't have the actual problem, I'll create a hypothetical math problem and solve it step by step.

### Hypothetical Math Problem 265:

**Problem Statement:**
Solve for \( x \) in the equation:  
\[ 3x + 5 = 2x + 10 \]

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Understand the Equation:**
   The equation given is a simple linear equation in one variable, \( x \).

2. **Isolate the Variable:**
   To solve for \( x \), we need to get all terms involving \( x \) on one side of the equation and constant terms on the other side.

3. **Subtract \( 2x \) from Both Sides:**
   \[
   3x + 5 - 2x = 2x + 10 - 2x
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   x + 5 = 10
   \]

4. **Subtract 5 from Both Sides:**
   \[
   x + 5 - 5 = 10 - 5
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   x = 5
   \]

5. **Verify the Solution:**
   Substitute \( x = 5 \) back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies the equation:
   \[
   3(5) + 5 = 2(5) + 10
   \]
   \[
   15 + 5 = 10 + 10
   \]
   \[
   20 = 20
   \]
   Since both sides of the equation are equal, the solution \( x = 5 \) is verified.

### Final Answer:
The solution to the equation \( 3x + 5 = 2x + 10 \) is \( x = 5 \).

If you have a specific "Sample math problem 265" in mind, please provide the details, and I will be happy to solve it for you.
