==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 265," we need to first understand what the problem is asking. Since the problem statement is not fully provided, I'll assume it involves a typical math problem scenario. Let's create a hypothetical problem based on the number 265 and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**
Calculate the sum of the digits of the number 265, then multiply the result by 3. What is the final result?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Identify the digits of the number 265:**
   - The number 265 consists of three digits: 2, 6, and 5.

2. **Calculate the sum of the digits:**
   - Add the digits together: \(2 + 6 + 5\).

   \[
   2 + 6 = 8
   \]
   \[
   8 + 5 = 13
   \]

   So, the sum of the digits is 13.

3. **Multiply the sum by 3:**
   - Take the sum obtained in the previous step and multiply it by 3.

   \[
   13 \times 3 = 39
   \]

4. **Final Result:**
   - The final result after multiplying the sum of the digits by 3 is 39.

Therefore, the final answer to the hypothetical problem is 39.
