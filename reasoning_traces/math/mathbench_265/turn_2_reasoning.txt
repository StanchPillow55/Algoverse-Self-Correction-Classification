==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 265," we need to first understand what the problem is asking. However, the problem statement "Sample math problem 265" is not clear or specific. It seems like a placeholder or reference to a specific problem that is not provided here. 

Since there is no specific math problem given, I will demonstrate how to solve a generic math problem by creating a sample problem and solving it step by step.

**Sample Problem:**
Solve for \( x \) in the equation: \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).

**Step-by-step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Equation:**
   The equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \) is a linear equation in one variable, \( x \). Our goal is to find the value of \( x \) that makes this equation true.

2. **Isolate the Variable:**
   To solve for \( x \), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We start by eliminating the constant term on the left side.

   \[
   2x + 3 = 11
   \]

   Subtract 3 from both sides to get:

   \[
   2x + 3 - 3 = 11 - 3
   \]

   Simplifying both sides gives:

   \[
   2x = 8
   \]

3. **Solve for \( x \):**
   Now, divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( x \).

   \[
   \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{8}{2}
   \]

   Simplifying both sides gives:

   \[
   x = 4
   \]

4. **Verify the Solution:**
   Substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies the equation.

   \[
   2(4) + 3 = 11
   \]

   Calculate the left side:

   \[
   8 + 3 = 11
   \]

   Since both sides of the equation are equal, \( x = 4 \) is indeed the correct solution.

**Final Answer:**
The solution to the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \) is \( x = 4 \).
