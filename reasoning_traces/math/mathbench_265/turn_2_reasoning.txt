Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 265," we first need to understand what the problem entails. However, the problem statement "Sample math problem 265" is not specific enough for us to determine what the actual mathematical question is. 

In order to proceed, let's assume that "Sample math problem 265" refers to a generic math problem that involves basic arithmetic or algebra. Without specific details, I'll create a hypothetical problem and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**
Suppose "Sample math problem 265" is the following:

"Find the value of \( x \) in the equation: \( 3x + 5 = 20 \)."

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Equation:**
   The equation given is \( 3x + 5 = 20 \). This is a linear equation in one variable, \( x \).

2. **Isolate the Variable:**
   To solve for \( x \), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We can do this by performing inverse operations.

3. **Subtract 5 from Both Sides:**
   \[
   3x + 5 - 5 = 20 - 5
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   3x = 15
   \]

4. **Divide Both Sides by 3:**
   \[
   \frac{3x}{3} = \frac{15}{3}
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   x = 5
   \]

5. **Verify the Solution:**
   Substitute \( x = 5 \) back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies the equation:
   \[
   3(5) + 5 = 20
   \]
   Simplifying the left side gives:
   \[
   15 + 5 = 20
   \]
   \[
   20 = 20
   \]
   Since both sides of the equation are equal, our solution \( x = 5 \) is verified.

**Final Answer:**
The value of \( x \) is 5.
