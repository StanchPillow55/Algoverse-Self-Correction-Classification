==================================================

It seems like the question you provided is somewhat vague, as "Sample math problem 400" does not specify a particular math problem to solve. However, I can create a sample math problem and solve it step by step for you. Let's consider a common type of math problem involving algebra.

**Problem: Solve for \( x \) in the equation:**

\[ 3x + 5 = 20 \]

**Step 1: Isolate the variable term.**

To isolate the term with \( x \), we need to eliminate the constant on the left side of the equation. We can do this by subtracting 5 from both sides:

\[
3x + 5 - 5 = 20 - 5
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
3x = 15
\]

**Step 2: Solve for \( x \).**

Now that we have \( 3x = 15 \), we can solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides of the equation by 3:

\[
x = \frac{15}{3}
\]

Calculating the right side gives:

\[
x = 5
\]

**Final Answer:**

The solution to the equation \( 3x + 5 = 20 \) is 

\[
\boxed{5}
\]

If you have a specific math problem in mind, please provide the details, and I would be happy to solve it step by step!
