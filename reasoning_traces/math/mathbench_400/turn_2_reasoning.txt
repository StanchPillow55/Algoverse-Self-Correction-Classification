==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 400," we need to first understand what the problem is asking. However, the problem statement provided is incomplete or unclear. It simply states "Sample math problem 400," which does not give us enough information to determine what mathematical operations or concepts are involved.

To proceed, let's assume that "Sample math problem 400" refers to a hypothetical math problem involving the number 400. We can explore various mathematical operations or concepts related to the number 400, such as:

1. **Prime Factorization**: 
   - To find the prime factorization of 400, we start by dividing 400 by the smallest prime number, which is 2.
   - \( 400 \div 2 = 200 \)
   - \( 200 \div 2 = 100 \)
   - \( 100 \div 2 = 50 \)
   - \( 50 \div 2 = 25 \)
   - 25 is not divisible by 2, so we move to the next prime number, which is 3. 25 is not divisible by 3, so we move to the next prime number, which is 5.
   - \( 25 \div 5 = 5 \)
   - \( 5 \div 5 = 1 \)
   - Therefore, the prime factorization of 400 is \( 2^4 \times 5^2 \).

2. **Square Root**:
   - To find the square root of 400, we look for a number that, when multiplied by itself, equals 400.
   - The square root of 400 is 20, since \( 20 \times 20 = 400 \).

3. **Divisors**:
   - To find the divisors of 400, we can use its prime factorization \( 2^4 \times 5^2 \).
   - The total number of divisors can be found by adding 1 to each of the exponents in the prime factorization and then multiplying the results: \((4+1)(2+1) = 5 \times 3 = 15\).
   - The divisors of 400 are: 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 10, 16, 20, 25, 40, 50, 80, 100, 200, and 400.

4. **Properties**:
   - 400 is an even number.
   - 400 is a perfect square, as we found earlier that \( \sqrt{400} = 20 \).

Since the original problem statement was not specific, we explored different mathematical aspects of the number 400. If you have a specific math problem involving 400, please provide more details so I can assist you further.

Final Answer:
- Prime Factorization: \( 2^4 \times 5^2 \)
- Square Root: 20
- Divisors: 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 10, 16, 20, 25, 40, 50, 80, 100, 200, 400
- Properties: Even number, perfect square
