==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 400," we first need to understand what the problem is asking. However, the problem statement is incomplete as it only says "Sample math problem 400" without providing any specific details or context. 

Since there is no specific problem given, I will assume that "Sample math problem 400" refers to a generic math problem involving the number 400. Let's consider a few possible interpretations and solve them:

### Interpretation 1: Basic Arithmetic Operations
Let's assume the problem is to perform basic arithmetic operations with the number 400.

1. **Addition**: What is 400 + 100?
   \[
   400 + 100 = 500
   \]

2. **Subtraction**: What is 400 - 150?
   \[
   400 - 150 = 250
   \]

3. **Multiplication**: What is 400 \times 2?
   \[
   400 \times 2 = 800
   \]

4. **Division**: What is 400 \div 4?
   \[
   400 \div 4 = 100
   \]

### Interpretation 2: Factorization
Let's assume the problem is to find the prime factorization of 400.

1. Start by dividing 400 by the smallest prime number, 2:
   \[
   400 \div 2 = 200
   \]

2. Divide 200 by 2:
   \[
   200 \div 2 = 100
   \]

3. Divide 100 by 2:
   \[
   100 \div 2 = 50
   \]

4. Divide 50 by 2:
   \[
   50 \div 2 = 25
   \]

5. 25 is not divisible by 2, so we move to the next prime number, 5:
   \[
   25 \div 5 = 5
   \]

6. Finally, divide 5 by 5:
   \[
   5 \div 5 = 1
   \]

The prime factorization of 400 is:
\[
400 = 2^4 \times 5^2
\]

### Interpretation 3: Solving an Equation
Let's assume the problem involves solving a simple equation with 400.

Solve for \( x \) in the equation \( x + 100 = 400 \).

1. Subtract 100 from both sides:
   \[
   x + 100 - 100 = 400 - 100
   \]

2. Simplify:
   \[
   x = 300
   \]

### Final Answer
Since the original problem statement is unclear, I've provided solutions for several possible interpretations involving the number 400. If you have a specific problem in mind, please provide more details so I can assist you further.
