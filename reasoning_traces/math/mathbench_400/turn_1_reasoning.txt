==================================================

It seems like the question you've provided is a bit unclear, as "Sample math problem 400" does not specify a particular math problem to solve. However, I can demonstrate how to approach a sample math problem step by step. 

Let's create a sample math problem and solve it:

**Sample Problem:**
Calculate the area of a rectangle with a length of 10 units and a width of 5 units.

**Step 1: Understand the formula for the area of a rectangle.**
The area \( A \) of a rectangle can be calculated using the formula:
\[
A = \text{length} \times \text{width}
\]

**Step 2: Identify the values given in the problem.**
From the problem, we have:
- Length = 10 units
- Width = 5 units

**Step 3: Substitute the values into the formula.**
Now we will substitute the length and width into the area formula:
\[
A = 10 \, \text{units} \times 5 \, \text{units}
\]

**Step 4: Perform the multiplication.**
Calculating the multiplication gives:
\[
A = 50 \, \text{square units}
\]

**Step 5: State the final answer.**
The area of the rectangle is \( 50 \, \text{square units} \).

If you have a specific math problem in mind, please provide the details, and I will be happy to solve it step by step!
