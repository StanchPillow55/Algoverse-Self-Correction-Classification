It seems like your request is a bit vague, as "Sample math problem 400" does not specify a particular math problem to solve. However, I can create a sample math problem and solve it step by step. Let's consider a problem involving basic algebra.

**Sample Problem: Solve for x in the equation: 3x + 5 = 20.**

### Step 1: Understand the equation
We have the equation \(3x + 5 = 20\). Our goal is to isolate \(x\) on one side of the equation.

### Step 2: Subtract 5 from both sides
To isolate the term with \(x\), we first need to eliminate the constant term on the left side. We do this by subtracting 5 from both sides of the equation.

\[
3x + 5 - 5 = 20 - 5
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
3x = 15
\]

### Step 3: Divide both sides by 3
Next, we need to solve for \(x\) by dividing both sides of the equation by 3.

\[
\frac{3x}{3} = \frac{15}{3}
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
x = 5
\]

### Final Answer
The solution to the equation \(3x + 5 = 20\) is:

\[
\boxed{5}
\]

If you have a specific math problem in mind, please provide the details, and I would be happy to help you solve it!
