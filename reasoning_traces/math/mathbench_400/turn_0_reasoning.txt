==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 400," we need to first understand what the problem is asking. However, the phrase "Sample math problem 400" is not specific enough to determine the exact nature of the problem. It could refer to a problem labeled as number 400 in a textbook or a specific type of math problem.

Since the problem is not clearly defined, I'll assume we are dealing with a generic math problem involving the number 400. Let's explore a few possibilities:

### Possibility 1: Basic Arithmetic Operations
Let's consider basic arithmetic operations involving the number 400.

1. **Addition**: What is 400 plus 100?
   \[
   400 + 100 = 500
   \]

2. **Subtraction**: What is 400 minus 150?
   \[
   400 - 150 = 250
   \]

3. **Multiplication**: What is 400 times 2?
   \[
   400 \times 2 = 800
   \]

4. **Division**: What is 400 divided by 4?
   \[
   400 \div 4 = 100
   \]

### Possibility 2: Factorization
Let's factor the number 400 into its prime factors.

1. Start with the smallest prime number, 2:
   \[
   400 \div 2 = 200
   \]
   \[
   200 \div 2 = 100
   \]
   \[
   100 \div 2 = 50
   \]
   \[
   50 \div 2 = 25
   \]

2. Now, 25 is not divisible by 2, so we move to the next prime number, 3. Since 25 is not divisible by 3, we try 5:
   \[
   25 \div 5 = 5
   \]
   \[
   5 \div 5 = 1
   \]

Thus, the prime factorization of 400 is:
\[
400 = 2^4 \times 5^2
\]

### Possibility 3: Solving an Equation
Let's solve a simple equation involving 400.

Consider the equation \( x + 400 = 1000 \).

To solve for \( x \), subtract 400 from both sides:
\[
x + 400 - 400 = 1000 - 400
\]
\[
x = 600
\]

### Conclusion
Since the problem "Sample math problem 400" is not clearly defined, I have explored a few mathematical operations and concepts involving the number 400. If you have a specific problem in mind, please provide more details so I can assist you further.

If any of the above possibilities align with your intended problem, the final answers are:
- For basic arithmetic: \(500\), \(250\), \(800\), \(100\).
- For factorization: \(2^4 \times 5^2\).
- For the equation: \(x = 600\).
