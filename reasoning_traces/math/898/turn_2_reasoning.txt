Question ID: 898
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to calculate the total distance that both Dijana and Anis rowed on that Sunday morning.

1. **Distance rowed by Dijana**: 
   - Dijana rowed a total of 50 miles.

2. **Distance rowed by Anis**: 
   - According to the problem, Anis rowed 1/5 times more miles than Dijana. 
   - To find out how many miles Anis rowed, we first need to calculate 1/5 of Dijana's distance:
     \[
     \text{1/5 of Dijana's distance} = \frac{1}{5} \times 50 \text{ miles} = 10 \text{ miles}
     \]
   - Since Anis rowed 1/5 times more than Dijana, we need to add this amount to Dijana's distance:
     \[
     \text{Distance rowed by Anis} = \text{Dijana's distance} + \text{1/5 of Dijana's distance} = 50 \text{ miles} + 10 \text{ miles} = 60 \text{ miles}
     \]

3. **Total distance rowed by both**:
   - Now we can calculate the total distance rowed by both Dijana and Anis:
     \[
     \text{Total distance} = \text{Distance rowed by Dijana} + \text{Distance rowed by Anis} = 50 \text{ miles} + 60 \text{ miles} = 110 \text{ miles}
     \]

4. **Final answer**:
   - Therefore, the total distance that Dijana and Anis rowed on that day is:
     \[
     \boxed{110} \text{ miles}
     \]
