==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to determine the total distance that both Dijana and Anis rowed on that Sunday morning.

1. **Distance rowed by Dijana**: 
   Dijana rowed a total of 50 miles.

2. **Distance rowed by Anis**: 
   According to the problem, Anis rowed 1/5 times more miles than Dijana. We need to calculate how many miles this is.

   First, we calculate 1/5 of Dijana's distance:
   \[
   \text{Distance Anis rowed} = \text{Dijana's distance} + \frac{1}{5} \times \text{Dijana's distance}
   \]
   \[
   = 50 + \frac{1}{5} \times 50
   \]
   \[
   = 50 + 10
   \]
   \[
   = 60 \text{ miles}
   \]

3. **Total distance rowed by both**:
   Now, we add the distances rowed by both Dijana and Anis to find the total distance:
   \[
   \text{Total distance} = \text{Distance rowed by Dijana} + \text{Distance rowed by Anis}
   \]
   \[
   = 50 + 60
   \]
   \[
   = 110 \text{ miles}
   \]

Thus, the total distance that Dijana and Anis rowed on that day is **110 miles**. 

Final answer:
\[
\text{Total distance rowed} = 110 \text{ miles}
\]
