==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to determine the distance Anis rowed based on the distance Dijana rowed, and then calculate the total distance both of them rowed together.

1. **Identify the distance Dijana rowed**: 
   Dijana rowed a total of 50 miles.

2. **Calculate the distance Anis rowed**: 
   The problem states that Anis rowed 1/5 times more miles than Dijana. 
   To find out how many miles this is, we first need to calculate 1/5 of Dijana's distance:
   \[
   \text{Distance Anis rowed} = \text{Distance Dijana rowed} + \frac{1}{5} \times \text{Distance Dijana rowed}
   \]
   This can be rewritten as:
   \[
   \text{Distance Anis rowed} = 50 + \frac{1}{5} \times 50
   \]

   Now, calculate \(\frac{1}{5} \times 50\):
   \[
   \frac{1}{5} \times 50 = 10
   \]

   Therefore, the distance Anis rowed is:
   \[
   \text{Distance Anis rowed} = 50 + 10 = 60 \text{ miles}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total distance rowed by both**:
   Now we can find the total distance rowed by both Dijana and Anis:
   \[
   \text{Total distance} = \text{Distance Dijana} + \text{Distance Anis}
   \]
   Substituting the values we found:
   \[
   \text{Total distance} = 50 + 60 = 110 \text{ miles}
   \]

4. **Final answer**:
   The total distance that Dijana and Anis rowed together on that day is:
   \[
   \boxed{110} \text{ miles}
   \]
