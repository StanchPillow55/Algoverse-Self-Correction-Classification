==================================================

To solve a math problem effectively, it's important to follow a structured approach. However, the question you've provided, "Sample reasoning question 459," lacks specific details or context. Therefore, I'll demonstrate a general approach to solving a math problem by creating a hypothetical problem and solving it step by step.

### Hypothetical Problem:
**Question:** A farmer has a rectangular field with a length that is twice its width. The perimeter of the field is 300 meters. What are the dimensions of the field?

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We have a rectangular field.
   - The length (L) is twice the width (W).
   - The perimeter (P) of the rectangle is 300 meters.

2. **Set Up the Equations:**
   - The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is \( P = 2L + 2W \).
   - We know \( L = 2W \) (since the length is twice the width).
   - Substitute \( L = 2W \) into the perimeter formula: 
     \[
     P = 2(2W) + 2W = 4W + 2W = 6W
     \]
   - We know the perimeter is 300 meters, so:
     \[
     6W = 300
     \]

3. **Solve for W (Width):**
   - Divide both sides of the equation by 6 to solve for W:
     \[
     W = \frac{300}{6} = 50
     \]

4. **Solve for L (Length):**
   - Since \( L = 2W \), substitute the value of W:
     \[
     L = 2 \times 50 = 100
     \]

5. **Verify the Solution:**
   - Check the perimeter with the calculated dimensions:
     \[
     P = 2L + 2W = 2(100) + 2(50) = 200 + 100 = 300
     \]
   - The calculated perimeter matches the given perimeter, confirming our solution is correct.

6. **State the Final Answer:**
   - The dimensions of the field are: 
     - Width = 50 meters
     - Length = 100 meters

This structured approach ensures that we understand the problem, set up the correct equations, solve for the unknowns, and verify our solution. If you have a specific problem or more details, feel free to provide them, and I can assist you further!
