To solve the problem, we need to understand what "Sample reasoning question 459" entails. Since the problem statement is not specific, I'll assume it's a placeholder for a typical math problem. Let's create a hypothetical math problem and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**

A company produces two types of widgets: Type A and Type B. The company sells Type A widgets for $50 each and Type B widgets for $70 each. In one month, the company sold a total of 300 widgets and made $18,000 in revenue. How many of each type of widget did the company sell?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( x \) be the number of Type A widgets sold.
   - Let \( y \) be the number of Type B widgets sold.

2. **Set Up Equations:**
   - From the problem, we know the total number of widgets sold is 300. Therefore, we have the equation:
     \[
     x + y = 300
     \]
   - We also know the total revenue is $18,000. The revenue from Type A widgets is \( 50x \) and from Type B widgets is \( 70y \). Therefore, the revenue equation is:
     \[
     50x + 70y = 18,000
     \]

3. **Solve the System of Equations:**
   - We have the system:
     \[
     \begin{align*}
     x + y &= 300 \\
     50x + 70y &= 18,000
     \end{align*}
     \]

   - Solve the first equation for \( y \):
     \[
     y = 300 - x
     \]

   - Substitute \( y = 300 - x \) into the second equation:
     \[
     50x + 70(300 - x) = 18,000
     \]

   - Distribute the 70:
     \[
     50x + 21,000 - 70x = 18,000
     \]

   - Combine like terms:
     \[
     -20x + 21,000 = 18,000
     \]

   - Subtract 21,000 from both sides:
     \[
     -20x = 18,000 - 21,000
     \]
     \[
     -20x = -3,000
     \]

   - Divide by -20:
     \[
     x = \frac{-3,000}{-20} = 150
     \]

   - Substitute \( x = 150 \) back into the equation for \( y \):
     \[
     y = 300 - 150 = 150
     \]

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The company sold 150 Type A widgets and 150 Type B widgets.

**Final Answer:**
The company sold 150 Type A widgets and 150 Type B widgets.
