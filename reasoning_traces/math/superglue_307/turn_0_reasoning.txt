==================================================

To solve the problem, I need more specific information about "Sample reasoning question 307" as it is not a standard or universally recognized problem. However, I can guide you through a general approach to solving math problems by outlining a typical problem-solving process. If you provide more details about the specific problem, I can tailor the solution accordingly.

### General Problem-Solving Approach:

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - Read the problem carefully.
   - Identify what is being asked.
   - Determine what information is given and what is missing.

2. **Devise a Plan:**
   - Consider possible strategies to solve the problem, such as:
     - Drawing a diagram
     - Creating an equation
     - Looking for patterns
     - Breaking the problem into smaller parts

3. **Carry Out the Plan:**
   - Execute the chosen strategy step by step.
   - Perform calculations carefully.
   - Keep track of units and ensure consistency.

4. **Review/Check the Solution:**
   - Verify each step of your work.
   - Check if the solution makes sense in the context of the problem.
   - Ensure that all parts of the problem have been addressed.

5. **State the Final Answer:**
   - Clearly present the final answer, including units if applicable.

### Example Problem:

Let's apply this process to a sample math problem:

**Problem:**
A rectangle has a length that is twice its width. If the perimeter of the rectangle is 36 units, what are the dimensions of the rectangle?

**Step 1: Understand the Problem**
- We need to find the length and width of the rectangle.
- We know the perimeter is 36 units.
- The length is twice the width.

**Step 2: Devise a Plan**
- Use the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle: \( P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width}) \).
- Let the width be \( w \).
- Then the length is \( 2w \).

**Step 3: Carry Out the Plan**
- Substitute into the perimeter formula:
  \[
  36 = 2 \times (2w + w)
  \]
- Simplify the equation:
  \[
  36 = 2 \times 3w
  \]
  \[
  36 = 6w
  \]
- Solve for \( w \):
  \[
  w = \frac{36}{6} = 6
  \]
- Find the length:
  \[
  \text{Length} = 2w = 2 \times 6 = 12
  \]

**Step 4: Review/Check the Solution**
- Check the perimeter with these dimensions:
  \[
  P = 2 \times (12 + 6) = 2 \times 18 = 36
  \]
- The calculations are correct.

**Step 5: State the Final Answer**
- The width of the rectangle is 6 units, and the length is 12 units.
