Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we first need to understand what "Sample reasoning question 307" entails. Since the problem statement is not explicitly given, I'll assume it's a hypothetical math problem that requires a structured approach to solve. Let's consider a generic math problem-solving strategy and apply it to a sample problem.

### Sample Problem:
Let's assume "Sample reasoning question 307" is a problem involving algebraic equations. For instance, let's solve the following equation:

\[ 3x + 5 = 20 \]

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We need to find the value of \( x \) that satisfies the equation \( 3x + 5 = 20 \).

2. **Isolate the Variable:**
   - To solve for \( x \), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We start by eliminating the constant term on the left side.
   - Subtract 5 from both sides of the equation:
     \[
     3x + 5 - 5 = 20 - 5
     \]
     \[
     3x = 15
     \]

3. **Solve for \( x \):**
   - Now, divide both sides by 3 to solve for \( x \):
     \[
     \frac{3x}{3} = \frac{15}{3}
     \]
     \[
     x = 5
     \]

4. **Verify the Solution:**
   - Substitute \( x = 5 \) back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies the equation:
     \[
     3(5) + 5 = 20
     \]
     \[
     15 + 5 = 20
     \]
     \[
     20 = 20
     \]
   - The left side equals the right side, confirming that \( x = 5 \) is indeed the correct solution.

5. **State the Final Answer:**
   - The solution to the equation \( 3x + 5 = 20 \) is \( x = 5 \).

### Conclusion:
By following a systematic approach, we solved the algebraic equation and verified our solution. The final answer to the problem is \( x = 5 \).
