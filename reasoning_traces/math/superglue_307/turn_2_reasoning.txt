==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 307" entails. Since the problem statement is not specific, let's assume it involves a typical math problem-solving scenario. I'll create a hypothetical problem and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**

A company produces two types of widgets: Widget A and Widget B. The company can produce a maximum of 100 widgets per day. The profit from selling Widget A is $5 per unit, and the profit from selling Widget B is $8 per unit. The company must produce at least 20 units of Widget A and at least 10 units of Widget B each day. How many of each type of widget should the company produce to maximize its profit?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( x \) be the number of Widget A produced per day.
   - Let \( y \) be the number of Widget B produced per day.

2. **Objective Function:**
   - We want to maximize the profit, \( P \), given by the equation:
     \[
     P = 5x + 8y
     \]

3. **Constraints:**
   - The total production constraint: \( x + y \leq 100 \)
   - Minimum production constraints:
     \[
     x \geq 20
     \]
     \[
     y \geq 10
     \]

4. **Set Up the Problem:**
   - We have a linear programming problem with the objective function and constraints defined above.

5. **Graphical Solution:**
   - Plot the constraints on a graph:
     - The line \( x + y = 100 \) is the boundary for the total production.
     - The vertical line \( x = 20 \) and the horizontal line \( y = 10 \) are the minimum production constraints.
   - The feasible region is bounded by these lines and is a polygon on the graph.

6. **Identify Corner Points:**
   - The feasible region is a polygon with vertices at the intersection of the lines:
     - Intersection of \( x = 20 \) and \( y = 10 \): \( (20, 10) \)
     - Intersection of \( x = 20 \) and \( x + y = 100 \): \( (20, 80) \)
     - Intersection of \( y = 10 \) and \( x + y = 100 \): \( (90, 10) \)

7. **Evaluate the Objective Function at Each Corner Point:**
   - At \( (20, 10) \): \( P = 5(20) + 8(10) = 100 + 80 = 180 \)
   - At \( (20, 80) \): \( P = 5(20) + 8(80) = 100 + 640 = 740 \)
   - At \( (90, 10) \): \( P = 5(90) + 8(10) = 450 + 80 = 530 \)

8. **Determine the Maximum Profit:**
   - The maximum profit is \( 740 \), which occurs at the point \( (20, 80) \).

**Final Answer:**
To maximize profit, the company should produce 20 units of Widget A and 80 units of Widget B per day, resulting in a maximum profit of $740.
