==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 307" entails. Since the problem statement is not provided, I'll demonstrate a general approach to solving a typical math problem by using a hypothetical example. Let's assume the problem is as follows:

**Problem:**  
A car travels from City A to City B at a speed of 60 km/h and returns from City B to City A at a speed of 40 km/h. If the total travel time is 5 hours, what is the distance between City A and City B?

**Solution:**

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( d \) be the distance between City A and City B in kilometers.

2. **Set Up Equations:**
   - The time taken to travel from City A to City B is given by:
     \[
     \text{Time from A to B} = \frac{d}{60}
     \]
   - The time taken to travel from City B to City A is given by:
     \[
     \text{Time from B to A} = \frac{d}{40}
     \]
   - The total travel time is 5 hours, so:
     \[
     \frac{d}{60} + \frac{d}{40} = 5
     \]

3. **Solve the Equation:**
   - To solve for \( d \), first find a common denominator for the fractions, which is 120:
     \[
     \frac{d}{60} = \frac{2d}{120}, \quad \frac{d}{40} = \frac{3d}{120}
     \]
   - Substitute these into the equation:
     \[
     \frac{2d}{120} + \frac{3d}{120} = 5
     \]
   - Combine the fractions:
     \[
     \frac{5d}{120} = 5
     \]
   - Simplify the equation by multiplying both sides by 120:
     \[
     5d = 600
     \]
   - Divide both sides by 5 to solve for \( d \):
     \[
     d = 120
     \]

4. **Verify the Solution:**
   - Check the time for each leg of the journey:
     - Time from A to B: \( \frac{120}{60} = 2 \) hours
     - Time from B to A: \( \frac{120}{40} = 3 \) hours
     - Total time: \( 2 + 3 = 5 \) hours, which matches the given total time.

5. **State the Final Answer:**
   - The distance between City A and City B is 120 kilometers.

This step-by-step approach demonstrates how to solve a problem by defining variables, setting up equations, solving the equations, verifying the solution, and stating the final answer. If you have a specific problem in mind, please provide the details, and I can work through that particular problem.
