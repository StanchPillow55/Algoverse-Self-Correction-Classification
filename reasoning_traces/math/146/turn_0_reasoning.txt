==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine how long each person takes to clean their room and then calculate the total time they spend cleaning their rooms each week.

1. **Determine the time each person takes to clean their room:**

   - **Richard:** It is given that Richard can clean his room in 22 minutes.

   - **Cory:** Cory takes 3 minutes more than Richard. Therefore, the time Cory takes is:
     \[
     22 \text{ minutes} + 3 \text{ minutes} = 25 \text{ minutes}
     \]

   - **Blake:** Blake can clean his room 4 minutes more quickly than Cory. Therefore, the time Blake takes is:
     \[
     25 \text{ minutes} - 4 \text{ minutes} = 21 \text{ minutes}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total time spent cleaning in one session:**

   Each person cleans their room once per session. Therefore, the total time spent by all three in one session is the sum of the times each person takes:
   \[
   22 \text{ minutes} + 25 \text{ minutes} + 21 \text{ minutes} = 68 \text{ minutes}
   \]

3. **Determine the total time spent cleaning each week:**

   They clean their rooms twice a week. Therefore, the total time spent cleaning each week is:
   \[
   68 \text{ minutes/session} \times 2 \text{ sessions/week} = 136 \text{ minutes/week}
   \]

Thus, the total number of minutes all three spend cleaning their rooms each week is \(\boxed{136}\).
