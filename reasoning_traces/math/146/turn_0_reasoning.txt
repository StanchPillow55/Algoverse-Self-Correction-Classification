To solve the problem, we need to determine how long each person spends cleaning their room and then calculate the total time spent by all three individuals cleaning their rooms in a week.

1. **Determine Richard's cleaning time:**
   - Richard can clean his room in 22 minutes.

2. **Determine Cory's cleaning time:**
   - Cory takes 3 minutes more than Richard.
   - Therefore, Cory's cleaning time = Richard's time + 3 minutes = 22 minutes + 3 minutes = 25 minutes.

3. **Determine Blake's cleaning time:**
   - Blake can clean his room 4 minutes more quickly than Cory.
   - Therefore, Blake's cleaning time = Cory's time - 4 minutes = 25 minutes - 4 minutes = 21 minutes.

Now we have the cleaning times for each person:
- Richard: 22 minutes
- Cory: 25 minutes
- Blake: 21 minutes

4. **Calculate the total cleaning time for one week:**
   - Each person cleans their room twice a week.
   - Total cleaning time for Richard in one week = 22 minutes × 2 = 44 minutes.
   - Total cleaning time for Cory in one week = 25 minutes × 2 = 50 minutes.
   - Total cleaning time for Blake in one week = 21 minutes × 2 = 42 minutes.

5. **Add the total cleaning times for all three individuals:**
   - Total cleaning time for all three in one week = Richard's time + Cory's time + Blake's time
   - Total cleaning time = 44 minutes + 50 minutes + 42 minutes

Now, we perform the addition:
\[
44 + 50 = 94
\]
\[
94 + 42 = 136
\]

Thus, the total time spent by all three cleaning their rooms each week is **136 minutes**.

**Final Answer: 136 minutes**
