==================================================

To find out how many blocks Johnny picks up, we need to calculate the total number of pieces from all the lego boxed sets he has.

1. **Identify the number of pieces in each set:**
   - The first set has 500 pieces.
   - The second set has 3 times more pieces than the first set. Therefore, we calculate:
     \[
     \text{Pieces in second set} = 3 \times 500 = 1500 \text{ pieces}
     \]
   - The third set has 1/4 the number of pieces of the first set. Therefore, we calculate:
     \[
     \text{Pieces in third set} = \frac{1}{4} \times 500 = 125 \text{ pieces}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total number of pieces:**
   Now we add the number of pieces from all three sets together:
   \[
   \text{Total pieces} = \text{Pieces in first set} + \text{Pieces in second set} + \text{Pieces in third set}
   \]
   Substituting the values we calculated:
   \[
   \text{Total pieces} = 500 + 1500 + 125
   \]

3. **Perform the addition:**
   First, add the pieces from the first and second sets:
   \[
   500 + 1500 = 2000
   \]
   Now, add the pieces from the third set:
   \[
   2000 + 125 = 2125
   \]

Thus, the total number of blocks Johnny picks up is:
\[
\boxed{2125}
\]
