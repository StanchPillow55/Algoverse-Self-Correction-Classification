==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 106" entails. Since the problem statement is not fully provided, I'll demonstrate a general approach to solving a reasoning-based math problem by creating a hypothetical scenario.

Let's assume "Sample reasoning question 106" is a logic-based math problem that involves solving for a variable using given conditions. Here's a step-by-step approach to solving a typical reasoning problem:

### Hypothetical Problem:
**Problem Statement:**
You have a total of 106 apples and oranges. If the number of apples is twice the number of oranges, how many apples and how many oranges do you have?

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( x \) be the number of oranges.
   - Since the number of apples is twice the number of oranges, the number of apples is \( 2x \).

2. **Set Up the Equation:**
   - The total number of fruits (apples and oranges) is 106.
   - Therefore, the equation is:
     \[
     x + 2x = 106
     \]

3. **Simplify the Equation:**
   - Combine like terms:
     \[
     3x = 106
     \]

4. **Solve for \( x \):**
   - Divide both sides by 3 to isolate \( x \):
     \[
     x = \frac{106}{3}
     \]
   - Calculate the division:
     \[
     x = 35.3333\ldots
     \]

5. **Interpret the Result:**
   - Since the number of oranges must be a whole number, there seems to be an inconsistency in our hypothetical problem setup. Let's adjust the problem to make it solvable with whole numbers.

### Revised Problem:
**Revised Problem Statement:**
You have a total of 105 apples and oranges. If the number of apples is twice the number of oranges, how many apples and how many oranges do you have?

### Revised Solution:

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( x \) be the number of oranges.
   - The number of apples is \( 2x \).

2. **Set Up the Equation:**
   - The total number of fruits is 105.
   - Therefore, the equation is:
     \[
     x + 2x = 105
     \]

3. **Simplify the Equation:**
   - Combine like terms:
     \[
     3x = 105
     \]

4. **Solve for \( x \):**
   - Divide both sides by 3:
     \[
     x = \frac{105}{3}
     \]
   - Calculate the division:
     \[
     x = 35
     \]

5. **Find the Number of Apples:**
   - Since the number of apples is twice the number of oranges:
     \[
     2x = 2 \times 35 = 70
     \]

6. **Conclusion:**
   - Number of oranges: 35
   - Number of apples: 70

### Final Answer:
In the revised problem, there are 35 oranges and 70 apples.
