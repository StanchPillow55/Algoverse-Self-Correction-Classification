==================================================

To solve the problem effectively, let's first understand what is being asked. The question is labeled as "Sample reasoning question 106," but without specific details, we need to assume a generic approach to solving a reasoning-based math problem. 

Since no specific problem details are provided, I'll create a hypothetical math reasoning problem and solve it step by step. Let's assume the problem is as follows:

**Problem:**
A farmer has a rectangular field with a length that is 10 meters more than its width. The area of the field is 600 square meters. What are the dimensions of the field?

**Step-by-step Solution:**

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( w \) be the width of the field in meters.
   - Then the length of the field will be \( w + 10 \) meters.

2. **Write the Equation for Area:**
   - The area of a rectangle is given by the formula: 
     \[
     \text{Area} = \text{Length} \times \text{Width}
     \]
   - Substituting the known values, we have:
     \[
     600 = (w + 10) \times w
     \]

3. **Expand and Rearrange the Equation:**
   - Expanding the right-hand side, we get:
     \[
     600 = w^2 + 10w
     \]
   - Rearrange the equation to form a standard quadratic equation:
     \[
     w^2 + 10w - 600 = 0
     \]

4. **Solve the Quadratic Equation:**
   - We can solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula:
     \[
     w = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
     \]
   - Here, \( a = 1 \), \( b = 10 \), and \( c = -600 \).
   - Calculate the discriminant:
     \[
     b^2 - 4ac = 10^2 - 4 \times 1 \times (-600) = 100 + 2400 = 2500
     \]
   - Since the discriminant is positive, there are two real solutions:
     \[
     w = \frac{-10 \pm \sqrt{2500}}{2}
     \]
   - Calculate the square root and solve:
     \[
     w = \frac{-10 \pm 50}{2}
     \]
   - This gives two potential solutions for \( w \):
     \[
     w = \frac{40}{2} = 20 \quad \text{or} \quad w = \frac{-60}{2} = -30
     \]

5. **Select the Valid Solution:**
   - Since a width cannot be negative, we discard \( w = -30 \).
   - Thus, \( w = 20 \).

6. **Find the Length:**
   - Substitute \( w = 20 \) back into the expression for length:
     \[
     \text{Length} = w + 10 = 20 + 10 = 30
     \]

7. **Conclusion:**
   - The dimensions of the field are 20 meters in width and 30 meters in length.

**Final Answer:**
The width of the field is 20 meters, and the length is 30 meters.
