Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 106" refers to. Since the problem statement is not explicitly provided, I'll assume this is a placeholder for a typical math problem. Let's create a hypothetical math problem and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**

A train travels from City A to City B, a distance of 300 miles. The train travels at a constant speed of 60 miles per hour. How long does it take for the train to reach City B from City A?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Identify the Given Information:**
   - Distance from City A to City B = 300 miles
   - Speed of the train = 60 miles per hour

2. **Determine What is Being Asked:**
   - We need to find the time it takes for the train to travel from City A to City B.

3. **Use the Formula for Time:**
   - The formula to calculate time when distance and speed are known is:
     \[
     \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}}
     \]

4. **Substitute the Given Values into the Formula:**
   - Substitute the distance (300 miles) and speed (60 miles per hour) into the formula:
     \[
     \text{Time} = \frac{300 \text{ miles}}{60 \text{ miles per hour}}
     \]

5. **Perform the Calculation:**
   - Divide 300 by 60:
     \[
     \text{Time} = 5 \text{ hours}
     \]

6. **Verify the Calculation:**
   - To ensure the calculation is correct, consider the units: miles cancel out, leaving hours, which is the correct unit for time.
   - Additionally, multiplying the time (5 hours) by the speed (60 miles per hour) should give back the original distance:
     \[
     5 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ miles per hour} = 300 \text{ miles}
     \]
   - This confirms the calculation is correct.

**Final Answer:**

The train takes 5 hours to travel from City A to City B.
