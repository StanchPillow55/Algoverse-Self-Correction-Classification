Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To find out how long Elaina's usual concerts run for, we can break down the information given in the problem step by step.

1. **Identify the total runtime of the final concert**: 
   The total runtime of the final concert is given as 65 minutes.

2. **Identify the encore duration**: 
   At the end of the concert, Elaina performs a 15-minute encore.

3. **Determine the runtime of the main concert**: 
   Since the encore is part of the total concert time, we need to subtract the encore duration from the total runtime to find out how long the main concert lasts.

   \[
   \text{Main concert duration} = \text{Total concert duration} - \text{Encore duration}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Main concert duration} = 65 \text{ minutes} - 15 \text{ minutes} = 50 \text{ minutes}
   \]

4. **Relate the main concert duration to the usual concert duration**: 
   The problem states that this final concert is twice as long as her usual concerts. Let \( x \) represent the duration of her usual concerts in minutes. Therefore, we can express the relationship as:

   \[
   2x = 50 \text{ minutes}
   \]

5. **Solve for \( x \)**: 
   To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 2:

   \[
   x = \frac{50 \text{ minutes}}{2} = 25 \text{ minutes}
   \]

6. **Final answer**: 
   The duration of Elaina's usual concerts is \( \boxed{25} \) minutes.
