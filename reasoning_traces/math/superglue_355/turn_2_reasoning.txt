==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 355" entails. Since the problem statement is not explicitly given, I'll assume that "Sample reasoning question 355" is a placeholder for a specific math problem. For the sake of this exercise, let's create a hypothetical math problem and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**

A company produces two types of widgets: Type A and Type B. The production cost for Type A is $5 per unit, and for Type B, it is $8 per unit. The company sells Type A for $10 per unit and Type B for $15 per unit. If the company produces 100 units of Type A and 150 units of Type B, what is the total profit?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Calculate the Total Revenue:**

   - **Revenue from Type A:**
     \[
     \text{Revenue from Type A} = \text{Number of Type A units} \times \text{Selling price per unit of Type A}
     \]
     \[
     = 100 \times 10 = 1000 \text{ dollars}
     \]

   - **Revenue from Type B:**
     \[
     \text{Revenue from Type B} = \text{Number of Type B units} \times \text{Selling price per unit of Type B}
     \]
     \[
     = 150 \times 15 = 2250 \text{ dollars}
     \]

   - **Total Revenue:**
     \[
     \text{Total Revenue} = \text{Revenue from Type A} + \text{Revenue from Type B}
     \]
     \[
     = 1000 + 2250 = 3250 \text{ dollars}
     \]

2. **Calculate the Total Cost:**

   - **Cost for Type A:**
     \[
     \text{Cost for Type A} = \text{Number of Type A units} \times \text{Cost per unit of Type A}
     \]
     \[
     = 100 \times 5 = 500 \text{ dollars}
     \]

   - **Cost for Type B:**
     \[
     \text{Cost for Type B} = \text{Number of Type B units} \times \text{Cost per unit of Type B}
     \]
     \[
     = 150 \times 8 = 1200 \text{ dollars}
     \]

   - **Total Cost:**
     \[
     \text{Total Cost} = \text{Cost for Type A} + \text{Cost for Type B}
     \]
     \[
     = 500 + 1200 = 1700 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Calculate the Total Profit:**

   \[
   \text{Total Profit} = \text{Total Revenue} - \text{Total Cost}
   \]
   \[
   = 3250 - 1700 = 1550 \text{ dollars}
   \]

**Final Answer:**

The total profit for producing and selling 100 units of Type A and 150 units of Type B is $1550.
