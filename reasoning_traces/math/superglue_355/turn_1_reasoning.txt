==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 355" entails. Since the question itself is not provided, I'll demonstrate a general approach to solving a typical math problem by making reasonable assumptions about what such a problem might involve. Let's assume it's a math problem involving algebraic reasoning.

### Problem Assumption:
Let's assume the problem is as follows:

**Problem:** Solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 3x + 5 = 20 \).

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Understand the Equation:**
   The equation given is \( 3x + 5 = 20 \). This is a linear equation in one variable, \( x \).

2. **Isolate the Variable:**
   To solve for \( x \), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We start by eliminating the constant term on the left side.

   \[
   3x + 5 = 20
   \]

   Subtract 5 from both sides to remove the constant term:

   \[
   3x + 5 - 5 = 20 - 5
   \]

   Simplifying both sides gives:

   \[
   3x = 15
   \]

3. **Solve for \( x \):**
   Now, we need to solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides by the coefficient of \( x \), which is 3.

   \[
   \frac{3x}{3} = \frac{15}{3}
   \]

   Simplifying both sides gives:

   \[
   x = 5
   \]

4. **Verify the Solution:**
   Substitute \( x = 5 \) back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies the equation.

   \[
   3(5) + 5 = 20
   \]

   Simplifying the left side:

   \[
   15 + 5 = 20
   \]

   \[
   20 = 20
   \]

   Since both sides of the equation are equal, our solution \( x = 5 \) is verified.

### Final Answer:
The solution to the equation \( 3x + 5 = 20 \) is \( x = 5 \).

This approach demonstrates a typical method for solving a linear equation, involving isolating the variable, solving for it, and verifying the solution. If the original problem was different, please provide more details for a specific solution.
