==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine how many gallons of milk Flora needs to drink daily to meet Dr. Juan's requirement of 105 gallons in 3 weeks, and then compare this to the 3 gallons she plans to drink daily.

### Step 1: Determine the total number of days in 3 weeks.
Since there are 7 days in a week, 3 weeks will have:
\[ 3 \text{ weeks} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 21 \text{ days} \]

### Step 2: Calculate the daily milk consumption needed to meet the 105-gallon requirement.
Flora needs to drink a total of 105 gallons in 21 days. To find out how many gallons she needs to drink per day, we divide the total gallons by the total number of days:
\[ \frac{105 \text{ gallons}}{21 \text{ days}} = 5 \text{ gallons/day} \]

### Step 3: Compare Flora's planned daily consumption with the required daily consumption.
Flora plans to drink 3 gallons of milk per day. We need to compare this with the 5 gallons per day requirement:
- Required daily consumption: 5 gallons/day
- Planned daily consumption: 3 gallons/day

### Step 4: Calculate the additional gallons Flora needs to drink daily.
To find out how many more gallons Flora needs to drink each day, subtract her planned daily consumption from the required daily consumption:
\[ 5 \text{ gallons/day} - 3 \text{ gallons/day} = 2 \text{ gallons/day} \]

### Conclusion:
Flora needs to drink 2 more gallons of milk daily to meet Dr. Juan's requirement of 105 gallons in 3 weeks.

**Final Answer: Flora must drink 2 more gallons of milk daily.**
