To solve the problem, we need to analyze the two options for purchasing a movie ticket and the associated costs.

1. **Super Ticket Option**:
   - Cost of the super ticket: $20
   - Cost for popcorn and soda: $1 extra
   - Total cost for the super ticket option: 
     \[
     20 + 1 = 21 \text{ dollars}
     \]

2. **Regular Ticket Option**:
   - Cost of the regular movie ticket: $12
   - Cost of soda: $3
   - Let \( p \) be the regular price of popcorn.
   - Total cost for the regular ticket option:
     \[
     12 + 3 + p = 15 + p \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Savings**:
   - According to the problem, by not buying the super ticket and opting for the regular ticket, you saved $2. This means:
     \[
     \text{Cost of super ticket option} - \text{Cost of regular ticket option} = 2
     \]
   - Substituting the costs we calculated:
     \[
     21 - (15 + p) = 2
     \]

4. **Solving the Equation**:
   - Rearranging the equation:
     \[
     21 - 15 - p = 2
     \]
     \[
     6 - p = 2
     \]
   - Now, isolate \( p \):
     \[
     6 - 2 = p
     \]
     \[
     p = 4
     \]

Thus, the regular price of popcorn is \( \boxed{4} \) dollars.
