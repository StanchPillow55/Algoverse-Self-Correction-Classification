To determine how many more gallons of milk Flora needs to drink daily to meet Dr. Juan's requirement, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total amount of milk Flora needs to drink in a day**:
   Dr. Juan has asked Flora to drink a total of 105 gallons of milk over 3 weeks. First, we need to convert the time period of 3 weeks into days.

   \[
   \text{Number of days in 3 weeks} = 3 \text{ weeks} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 21 \text{ days}
   \]

2. **Determine the daily requirement**:
   Now, we can find out how many gallons of milk Flora needs to drink each day to meet the total requirement of 105 gallons in 21 days.

   \[
   \text{Daily requirement} = \frac{105 \text{ gallons}}{21 \text{ days}} = 5 \text{ gallons/day}
   \]

3. **Compare with Flora's current plan**:
   Flora thinks that drinking 3 gallons of milk daily will be enough. We need to compare this with the daily requirement we just calculated.

   - Flora's current plan: 3 gallons/day
   - Required amount: 5 gallons/day

4. **Calculate how many more gallons Flora needs to drink daily**:
   To find out how many more gallons Flora needs to drink, we subtract her current daily intake from the required daily intake.

   \[
   \text{Additional gallons needed} = \text{Required amount} - \text{Current plan}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Additional gallons needed} = 5 \text{ gallons/day} - 3 \text{ gallons/day} = 2 \text{ gallons/day}
   \]

5. **Conclusion**:
   Flora needs to drink an additional 2 gallons of milk each day to meet Dr. Juan's requirement.

Thus, the final answer is:

**Flora must drink 2 more gallons of milk daily.**
