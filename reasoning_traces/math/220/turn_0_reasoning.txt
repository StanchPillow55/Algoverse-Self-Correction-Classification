==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine how many gallons of gas Mr. Montero's car requires to travel 600 miles and how many more gallons he needs beyond the 8 gallons already in the tank.

### Step 1: Determine the car's fuel efficiency
The car uses 20 gallons of gas to travel 400 miles. We can calculate the car's fuel efficiency in miles per gallon (mpg) as follows:

\[
\text{Fuel efficiency} = \frac{\text{Distance traveled}}{\text{Gallons used}} = \frac{400 \text{ miles}}{20 \text{ gallons}} = 20 \text{ mpg}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the total gallons needed for 600 miles
Now that we know the car's fuel efficiency is 20 miles per gallon, we can calculate how many gallons are needed to travel 600 miles:

\[
\text{Gallons needed} = \frac{\text{Total distance}}{\text{Fuel efficiency}} = \frac{600 \text{ miles}}{20 \text{ mpg}} = 30 \text{ gallons}
\]

### Step 3: Determine how many more gallons are needed
Mr. Montero's car currently has 8 gallons of gas. To find out how many more gallons he needs, we subtract the gallons he already has from the total gallons needed:

\[
\text{Additional gallons needed} = \text{Total gallons needed} - \text{Gallons already in the tank} = 30 \text{ gallons} - 8 \text{ gallons} = 22 \text{ gallons}
\]

### Final Answer
Mr. Montero needs 22 more gallons of gas to travel 600 miles.
