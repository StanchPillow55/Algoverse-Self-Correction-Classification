To determine how much time Carmen spent playing crossword puzzles and sudoku puzzles over the weekend, we can break the problem down into steps.

1. **Calculate the time spent on crossword puzzles:**
   - Carmen takes 10 minutes to finish one crossword puzzle.
   - She solved 3 crossword puzzles.
   - Therefore, the total time spent on crossword puzzles can be calculated as follows:
     \[
     \text{Time for crossword puzzles} = \text{Number of crossword puzzles} \times \text{Time per crossword puzzle}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Time for crossword puzzles} = 3 \times 10 \text{ minutes} = 30 \text{ minutes}
     \]

2. **Calculate the time spent on sudoku puzzles:**
   - Carmen takes 5 minutes to finish one sudoku puzzle.
   - She solved 8 sudoku puzzles.
   - Therefore, the total time spent on sudoku puzzles can be calculated as follows:
     \[
     \text{Time for sudoku puzzles} = \text{Number of sudoku puzzles} \times \text{Time per sudoku puzzle}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Time for sudoku puzzles} = 8 \times 5 \text{ minutes} = 40 \text{ minutes}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total time spent on both games:**
   - Now, we add the time spent on crossword puzzles and sudoku puzzles to find the total time spent:
     \[
     \text{Total time spent} = \text{Time for crossword puzzles} + \text{Time for sudoku puzzles}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total time spent} = 30 \text{ minutes} + 40 \text{ minutes} = 70 \text{ minutes}
     \]

Thus, the total time Carmen spent playing these games over the weekend is **70 minutes**.

Final answer: **70 minutes**.
