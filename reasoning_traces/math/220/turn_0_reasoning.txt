==================================================

To determine how many more gallons of gas Mr. Montero needs to travel 600 miles back and forth, we will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the car's fuel efficiency (miles per gallon)**:
   The car uses 20 gallons of gas to travel 400 miles. We can find the miles per gallon (mpg) by dividing the total miles traveled by the total gallons used:

   \[
   \text{Miles per gallon} = \frac{\text{Total miles}}{\text{Total gallons}} = \frac{400 \text{ miles}}{20 \text{ gallons}} = 20 \text{ miles per gallon}
   \]

2. **Determine the total distance for the round trip**:
   Mr. Montero needs to travel 600 miles back and forth. This means he will travel:

   \[
   \text{Total distance} = 600 \text{ miles} \times 2 = 1200 \text{ miles}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total gallons of gas needed for the round trip**:
   Now that we know the car's fuel efficiency is 20 miles per gallon, we can calculate how many gallons are needed to travel 1200 miles:

   \[
   \text{Gallons needed} = \frac{\text{Total distance}}{\text{Miles per gallon}} = \frac{1200 \text{ miles}}{20 \text{ miles per gallon}} = 60 \text{ gallons}
   \]

4. **Determine how many gallons Mr. Montero currently has**:
   Mr. Montero's car currently has 8 gallons of gas.

5. **Calculate how many more gallons he needs**:
   To find out how many more gallons he needs, we subtract the amount of gas he has from the total gallons needed:

   \[
   \text{Gallons needed} = 60 \text{ gallons} - 8 \text{ gallons} = 52 \text{ gallons}
   \]

Thus, Mr. Montero needs **52 more gallons of gas** to travel 600 miles back and forth.

Final answer: **52 gallons**.
