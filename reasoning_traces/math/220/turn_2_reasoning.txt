Question ID: 220
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine how many gallons of gas Mr. Montero's car will require to travel a total of 600 miles, and then calculate how many more gallons he needs beyond the 8 gallons he already has.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Determine the car's fuel efficiency:**
   - The car uses 20 gallons of gas to travel 400 miles.
   - To find the miles per gallon (mpg), divide the total miles by the total gallons:
     \[
     \text{Fuel efficiency} = \frac{400 \text{ miles}}{20 \text{ gallons}} = 20 \text{ mpg}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total gallons needed for 600 miles:**
   - Mr. Montero wants to travel 600 miles.
   - Using the fuel efficiency, calculate the gallons needed:
     \[
     \text{Gallons needed} = \frac{600 \text{ miles}}{20 \text{ mpg}} = 30 \text{ gallons}
     \]

3. **Determine how many more gallons are needed:**
   - Mr. Montero currently has 8 gallons in his car.
   - Subtract the gallons he has from the total gallons needed:
     \[
     \text{Additional gallons needed} = 30 \text{ gallons} - 8 \text{ gallons} = 22 \text{ gallons}
     \]

### Final Answer:
Mr. Montero needs 22 more gallons of gas to travel 600 miles.
