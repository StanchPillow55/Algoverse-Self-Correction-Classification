Question ID: 220
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine how many gallons of gas Mr. Montero's car will require to travel 600 miles and how many more gallons he needs beyond the 8 gallons already in the tank.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Determine the car's fuel efficiency:**
   The car uses 20 gallons of gas to travel 400 miles. We can calculate the car's fuel efficiency in miles per gallon (mpg) as follows:

   \[
   \text{Fuel efficiency} = \frac{\text{Distance traveled}}{\text{Gallons used}} = \frac{400 \text{ miles}}{20 \text{ gallons}} = 20 \text{ mpg}
   \]

   This means the car can travel 20 miles per gallon of gas.

2. **Calculate the total gallons needed for 600 miles:**
   We need to find out how many gallons are required to travel 600 miles. Using the fuel efficiency calculated above:

   \[
   \text{Gallons needed} = \frac{\text{Distance to travel}}{\text{Fuel efficiency}} = \frac{600 \text{ miles}}{20 \text{ mpg}} = 30 \text{ gallons}
   \]

3. **Determine how many more gallons are needed:**
   Mr. Montero's car currently has 8 gallons of gas. To find out how many more gallons he needs, subtract the gallons he already has from the total gallons required:

   \[
   \text{Additional gallons needed} = \text{Total gallons needed} - \text{Gallons already in the tank} = 30 \text{ gallons} - 8 \text{ gallons} = 22 \text{ gallons}
   \]

### Final Answer:
Mr. Montero needs 22 more gallons of gas to travel 600 miles.
