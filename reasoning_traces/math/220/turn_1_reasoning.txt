Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine how many gallons of gas Mr. Montero's car will need to travel 600 miles and how many more gallons he needs beyond the 8 gallons already in the car.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Determine the car's fuel efficiency:**
   - The car uses 20 gallons of gas to travel 400 miles.
   - Fuel efficiency (miles per gallon) = Total miles / Total gallons = 400 miles / 20 gallons = 20 miles per gallon.

2. **Calculate the total gallons needed for 600 miles:**
   - We need to find out how many gallons are required to travel 600 miles.
   - Using the fuel efficiency, we calculate:
     \[
     \text{Gallons needed} = \frac{\text{Total miles to travel}}{\text{Miles per gallon}} = \frac{600 \text{ miles}}{20 \text{ miles per gallon}} = 30 \text{ gallons}
     \]

3. **Determine how many more gallons are needed:**
   - Mr. Montero's car currently has 8 gallons.
   - To find out how many more gallons are needed, subtract the current amount of gas from the total gallons needed:
     \[
     \text{Additional gallons needed} = \text{Total gallons needed} - \text{Current gallons} = 30 \text{ gallons} - 8 \text{ gallons} = 22 \text{ gallons}
     \]

### Final Answer:
Mr. Montero needs 22 more gallons of gas to travel 600 miles.
