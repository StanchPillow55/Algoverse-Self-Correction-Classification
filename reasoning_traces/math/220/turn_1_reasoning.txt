Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine how many gallons of gas Mr. Montero needs to travel a total of 600 miles, and then find out how many more gallons he needs beyond the 8 gallons he already has.

### Step 1: Determine the car's fuel efficiency.
The car uses 20 gallons of gas to travel 400 miles. We can calculate the car's fuel efficiency in miles per gallon (mpg) as follows:

\[
\text{Fuel Efficiency} = \frac{\text{Miles Traveled}}{\text{Gallons Used}} = \frac{400 \text{ miles}}{20 \text{ gallons}} = 20 \text{ mpg}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the total gallons needed for 600 miles.
Since Mr. Montero wants to travel 600 miles, we use the car's fuel efficiency to find out how many gallons are needed:

\[
\text{Gallons Needed} = \frac{\text{Total Miles}}{\text{Fuel Efficiency}} = \frac{600 \text{ miles}}{20 \text{ mpg}} = 30 \text{ gallons}
\]

### Step 3: Determine how many more gallons are needed.
Mr. Montero currently has 8 gallons of gas in his car. To find out how many more gallons he needs, we subtract the gallons he already has from the total gallons needed:

\[
\text{Additional Gallons Needed} = \text{Gallons Needed} - \text{Gallons Available} = 30 \text{ gallons} - 8 \text{ gallons} = 22 \text{ gallons}
\]

### Final Answer:
Mr. Montero needs 22 more gallons of gas to travel 600 miles.
