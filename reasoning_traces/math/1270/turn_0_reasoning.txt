To determine the value of the boat after three years of depreciation, we will calculate the value of the boat at the end of each year step by step.

1. **Initial Value of the Boat**: 
   \[
   \text{Initial Value} = 9000 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **First Year Depreciation**:
   The boat depreciates by 30% in the first year. To find the depreciation amount:
   \[
   \text{Depreciation Amount (Year 1)} = 9000 \times 0.30 = 2700 \text{ dollars}
   \]
   Now, we subtract this depreciation from the initial value to find the value at the end of the first year:
   \[
   \text{Value after Year 1} = 9000 - 2700 = 6300 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Second Year Depreciation**:
   In the second year, the boat again depreciates by 30%, but this time it is based on the value at the end of the first year, which is $6300.
   \[
   \text{Depreciation Amount (Year 2)} = 6300 \times 0.30 = 1890 \text{ dollars}
   \]
   We subtract this depreciation from the value at the end of the first year:
   \[
   \text{Value after Year 2} = 6300 - 1890 = 4410 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Third Year Depreciation**:
   In the third year, the boat depreciates by 20%, based on the value at the end of the second year, which is $4410.
   \[
   \text{Depreciation Amount (Year 3)} = 4410 \times 0.20 = 882 \text{ dollars}
   \]
   We subtract this depreciation from the value at the end of the second year:
   \[
   \text{Value after Year 3} = 4410 - 882 = 3528 \text{ dollars}
   \]

5. **Final Value**:
   After three years of depreciation, the final value of the boat is:
   \[
   \text{Final Value} = 3528 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Thus, the boat is worth **$3528** after three years.
