==================================================

To determine the value of the boat after three years of depreciation, we will calculate the depreciation for each year step by step.

1. **Initial Value of the Boat**: 
   - The initial purchase price of the boat is $9000.

2. **First Year Depreciation**:
   - The boat depreciates by 30% in the first year.
   - To find the amount of depreciation, we calculate:
     \[
     \text{Depreciation for Year 1} = 9000 \times 0.30 = 2700
     \]
   - Now, we subtract this depreciation from the initial value to find the value at the end of the first year:
     \[
     \text{Value after Year 1} = 9000 - 2700 = 6300
     \]

3. **Second Year Depreciation**:
   - In the second year, the boat again depreciates by 30%, but this time it is based on the value at the end of the first year, which is $6300.
   - We calculate the depreciation for the second year:
     \[
     \text{Depreciation for Year 2} = 6300 \times 0.30 = 1890
     \]
   - We subtract this depreciation from the value at the end of the first year:
     \[
     \text{Value after Year 2} = 6300 - 1890 = 4410
     \]

4. **Third Year Depreciation**:
   - In the third year, the boat depreciates by 20%, based on the value at the end of the second year, which is $4410.
   - We calculate the depreciation for the third year:
     \[
     \text{Depreciation for Year 3} = 4410 \times 0.20 = 882
     \]
   - We subtract this depreciation from the value at the end of the second year:
     \[
     \text{Value after Year 3} = 4410 - 882 = 3528
     \]

5. **Final Value**:
   - After three years of depreciation, the final value of the boat is:
     \[
     \text{Final Value} = 3528
     \]

Thus, the boat is worth **$3528** after three years.
