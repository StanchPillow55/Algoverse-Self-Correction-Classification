==================================================

To solve the problem, we will follow the steps outlined in the question and calculate the number of pens each person has based on the information provided.

1. **Identify the number of pens George has:**
   - According to the problem, George has 18 pens.

2. **Calculate the number of pens Timothy has:**
   - The problem states that Timothy has three times the number of pens that George owns. 
   - Therefore, we can calculate Timothy's pens as follows:
     \[
     \text{Timothy's pens} = 3 \times \text{George's pens} = 3 \times 18
     \]
     \[
     \text{Timothy's pens} = 54
     \]

3. **Calculate the number of pens Sarah has:**
   - The problem states that Sarah has half as many pens as Timothy.
   - We can calculate Sarah's pens as follows:
     \[
     \text{Sarah's pens} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Timothy's pens} = \frac{1}{2} \times 54
     \]
     \[
     \text{Sarah's pens} = 27
     \]

4. **Final answer:**
   - Therefore, the number of pens that Sarah has is \( \boxed{27} \).
