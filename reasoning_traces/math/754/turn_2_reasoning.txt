Question ID: 754
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to carefully track Lorraine's stickers and buttons through each step of her trading process. Let's break it down step by step.

### Step 1: Initial Stickers
Lorraine starts with:
- **30 small stickers**
- **40 large stickers**

### Step 2: Trading Small Stickers
Lorraine trades **90%** of her small stickers for large buttons. 

Calculating 90% of her small stickers:
\[
90\% \text{ of } 30 = 0.9 \times 30 = 27 \text{ small stickers}
\]

Now, we need to determine how many large buttons she receives for these 27 small stickers. According to the problem, each small sticker is worth **1 small button**. Therefore, she can trade her small stickers for large buttons as follows:
- Each large button is worth **3 small stickers**.

Calculating how many large buttons Lorraine receives:
\[
\text{Large buttons received} = \frac{27 \text{ small stickers}}{3 \text{ small stickers per large button}} = 9 \text{ large buttons}
\]

After this trade, Lorraine has:
- **3 small stickers** left (since she started with 30 and traded 27)
- **40 large stickers** (no change yet)
- **9 large buttons** (from trading small stickers)

### Step 3: Trading Large Stickers
Next, Lorraine trades **50%** of her large stickers for large buttons.

Calculating 50% of her large stickers:
\[
50\% \text{ of } 40 = 0.5 \times 40 = 20 \text{ large stickers}
\]

Now, we need to determine how many large buttons she receives for these 20 large stickers. According to the problem, each large sticker is worth **1 large button** or **3 small buttons**. Since she is trading large stickers for large buttons, she receives:
\[
\text{Large buttons received} = 20 \text{ large stickers} \text{ (1 large sticker = 1 large button)}
\]

After this trade, Lorraine has:
- **3 small stickers** (no change)
- **20 large stickers** left (since she started with 40 and traded 20)
- **9 + 20 = 29 large buttons** (from trading small and large stickers)

### Step 4: Trading Remaining Large Stickers
Lorraine trades the remaining **20 large stickers** for small buttons. Each large sticker is worth **3 small buttons**.

Calculating how many small buttons she receives:
\[
\text{Small buttons received} = 20 \text{ large stickers} \times 3 \text{ small buttons per large sticker} = 60 \text{ small buttons}
\]

### Final Count of Buttons
Now, we can summarize Lorraine's total buttons:
- **Large buttons**: 29 (from previous trades)
- **Small buttons**: 60 (from trading the remaining large stickers)

Adding these together gives:
\[
\text{Total buttons} = 29 \text{ large buttons} + 60 \text{ small buttons} = 89 \text{ buttons}
\]

### Final Answer
Thus, the total number of buttons Lorraine has by the end is:
\[
\boxed{89}
\]
