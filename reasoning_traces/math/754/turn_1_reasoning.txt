Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to track Lorraine's stickers and buttons through her trades step by step.

1. **Initial Stickers**:
   - Small stickers: 30
   - Large stickers: 40

2. **Trading Small Stickers**:
   - Lorraine trades 90% of her small stickers for large buttons.
   - 90% of 30 small stickers = \(0.9 \times 30 = 27\) small stickers.
   - Remaining small stickers = \(30 - 27 = 3\) small stickers.

   Each large sticker is worth 1 large button or 3 small buttons. Therefore, trading 27 small stickers for large buttons means:
   - 27 small stickers = 27 small buttons (since 1 small sticker = 1 small button).
   - Since 1 large button = 3 small buttons, Lorraine can trade 27 small buttons for:
     \[
     \frac{27 \text{ small buttons}}{3 \text{ small buttons per large button}} = 9 \text{ large buttons}
     \]

3. **Trading Large Stickers**:
   - Lorraine trades 50% of her large stickers for large buttons.
   - 50% of 40 large stickers = \(0.5 \times 40 = 20\) large stickers.
   - Remaining large stickers = \(40 - 20 = 20\) large stickers.

   Trading 20 large stickers for large buttons:
   - Each large sticker is worth 1 large button, so she gets 20 large buttons from trading 20 large stickers.

4. **Trading Remaining Large Stickers**:
   - Lorraine trades the remaining 20 large stickers for small buttons.
   - Each large sticker is worth 3 small stickers, so:
     \[
     20 \text{ large stickers} \times 3 \text{ small stickers per large sticker} = 60 \text{ small stickers}
     \]

5. **Final Count of Buttons**:
   - Total large buttons from small stickers: 9
   - Total large buttons from large stickers: 20
   - Total small buttons from remaining large stickers: 60 small stickers (which are equivalent to 60 small buttons).

   Now, we sum up all the buttons:
   - Total large buttons = 9 (from small stickers) + 20 (from large stickers) = 29 large buttons.
   - Total small buttons = 60.

6. **Final Answer**:
   - Lorraine has a total of \(29\) large buttons and \(60\) small buttons.

Thus, the total number of buttons Lorraine has by the end is:
\[
\text{Total buttons} = 29 \text{ large buttons} + 60 \text{ small buttons} = 89 \text{ buttons}.
\]

**Final Answer**: Lorraine has 89 buttons in total.
