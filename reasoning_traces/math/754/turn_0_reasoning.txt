To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step, keeping track of Lorraine's stickers and buttons throughout the trading process.

### Step 1: Initial Inventory
- Lorraine starts with:
  - Small stickers: 30
  - Large stickers: 40

### Step 2: Trading Small Stickers for Large Buttons
Lorraine trades 90% of her small stickers for large buttons.
- 90% of 30 small stickers = \(0.9 \times 30 = 27\) small stickers.
- Remaining small stickers after the trade = \(30 - 27 = 3\) small stickers.

Each large sticker is worth 1 large button or 3 small buttons. Therefore, when trading small stickers for large buttons:
- 27 small stickers can be traded for 27 small buttons (since 1 small sticker = 1 small button).
- Since 1 large button is worth 3 small buttons, Lorraine can trade her 27 small buttons for:
  \[
  \frac{27 \text{ small buttons}}{3 \text{ small buttons per large button}} = 9 \text{ large buttons}
  \]

### Step 3: Trading Large Stickers for Large Buttons
Next, Lorraine trades 50% of her large stickers for large buttons.
- 50% of 40 large stickers = \(0.5 \times 40 = 20\) large stickers.
- Remaining large stickers after the trade = \(40 - 20 = 20\) large stickers.

Since each large sticker can be traded for 1 large button:
- 20 large stickers can be traded for 20 large buttons.

### Step 4: Trading Remaining Large Stickers for Small Buttons
Lorraine trades the remaining 20 large stickers for small buttons.
- Each large button is worth 3 small stickers, so:
\[
20 \text{ large stickers} \rightarrow 20 \text{ large buttons} \rightarrow 20 \times 3 = 60 \text{ small buttons}
\]

### Step 5: Total Buttons Calculation
Now, we will calculate the total number of buttons Lorraine has:
- From trading small stickers: 9 large buttons
- From trading half of her large stickers: 20 large buttons
- From trading the remaining large stickers: 60 small buttons

Now, we sum these:
- Total large buttons = \(9 + 20 = 29\) large buttons
- Total small buttons = 60 small buttons

### Final Count
- Total buttons (large + small) = \(29 \text{ large buttons} + 60 \text{ small buttons} = 89 \text{ buttons}\)

### Final Answer
Thus, Lorraine has a total of **89 buttons** by the end of her trading.
