Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the sample math problem "25," we need to first understand what the problem is asking. However, the problem statement "Sample math problem 25" is incomplete and does not provide enough information to determine what specific mathematical operation or concept is being addressed.

Let's consider a few possibilities for what "25" might refer to in a mathematical context:

1. **Basic Arithmetic**: If the problem is simply to evaluate the number 25, then the answer is straightforward: 25 is a whole number, an integer, and it is already in its simplest form.

2. **Square Root**: If the problem is asking for the square root of 25, we would calculate:
   \[
   \sqrt{25} = 5
   \]
   This is because 5 multiplied by itself (5 Ã— 5) equals 25.

3. **Factorization**: If the problem involves finding the factors of 25, we would list:
   \[
   25 = 1 \times 25 \quad \text{and} \quad 5 \times 5
   \]
   Therefore, the factors of 25 are 1, 5, and 25.

4. **Prime Factorization**: If the problem is asking for the prime factorization of 25, we would express 25 as a product of prime numbers:
   \[
   25 = 5^2
   \]
   Here, 5 is a prime number, and it is used twice in the factorization.

5. **Percentage**: If the problem involves converting 25 into a percentage, it is already a whole number percentage, i.e., 25%.

6. **Algebraic Expression**: If "25" is part of an algebraic equation or expression, we would need more context to solve or simplify it.

Without additional context or specific instructions, it is challenging to determine the exact nature of the problem. However, based on the possibilities above, the most straightforward interpretation is that the problem is simply referring to the number 25 itself.

**Final Answer**: 25

If there is a specific operation or context you have in mind, please provide more details so I can assist you further.
