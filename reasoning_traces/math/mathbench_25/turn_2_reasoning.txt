==================================================

To solve the sample math problem "25," we need to first interpret what the problem is asking. Since "25" is a number, it seems like there might be some missing context or additional information needed to form a complete math problem. However, let's explore a few possibilities based on the number 25:

### Possibility 1: Basic Arithmetic Operations

If the problem is simply to perform operations involving the number 25, we can explore basic arithmetic:

1. **Addition**: \( 25 + 10 = 35 \)
2. **Subtraction**: \( 25 - 10 = 15 \)
3. **Multiplication**: \( 25 \times 2 = 50 \)
4. **Division**: \( 25 \div 5 = 5 \)

### Possibility 2: Square of 25

Another common problem involving the number 25 is finding its square:

- The square of 25 is calculated as:
  \[
  25^2 = 25 \times 25 = 625
  \]

### Possibility 3: Square Root of 25

Finding the square root of 25 is another straightforward calculation:

- The square root of 25 is:
  \[
  \sqrt{25} = 5
  \]

### Possibility 4: Prime Factorization of 25

If the problem involves finding the prime factors of 25:

- The prime factorization of 25 is:
  \[
  25 = 5 \times 5 = 5^2
  \]

### Possibility 5: Solving an Equation Involving 25

If 25 is part of an equation, such as solving for \( x \) in \( x + 25 = 50 \):

1. Subtract 25 from both sides:
   \[
   x + 25 - 25 = 50 - 25
   \]
2. Simplify:
   \[
   x = 25
   \]

### Conclusion

Without additional context, it's challenging to determine the exact nature of the problem involving "25." However, based on the possibilities explored, the final answer could vary. If we assume the problem is to find the square of 25, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{625}
\]
