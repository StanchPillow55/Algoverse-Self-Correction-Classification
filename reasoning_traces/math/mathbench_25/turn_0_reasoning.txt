==================================================

It seems like the problem statement "Sample math problem 25" is not clear or complete. However, I will interpret it as a request to solve a math problem involving the number 25. Let's consider a few possibilities:

### Problem 1: Find the square root of 25.

**Step 1: Understand the problem.**
We need to find a number which, when multiplied by itself, gives 25.

**Step 2: Solve the problem.**
The square root of 25 is the number that satisfies the equation \( x^2 = 25 \).

**Step 3: Calculate the square root.**
\[
x = \sqrt{25} = 5
\]

**Step 4: Verify the solution.**
Check if \( 5 \times 5 = 25 \). Yes, it does.

**Final Answer:**
The square root of 25 is 5.

### Problem 2: Solve the equation \( x^2 - 25 = 0 \).

**Step 1: Understand the problem.**
We need to solve for \( x \) in the equation \( x^2 - 25 = 0 \).

**Step 2: Rearrange the equation.**
Add 25 to both sides:
\[
x^2 = 25
\]

**Step 3: Solve for \( x \).**
Take the square root of both sides:
\[
x = \pm \sqrt{25}
\]

**Step 4: Calculate the square root.**
\[
x = \pm 5
\]

**Step 5: Verify the solution.**
Check both solutions:
- \( 5^2 - 25 = 0 \) (True)
- \( (-5)^2 - 25 = 0 \) (True)

**Final Answer:**
The solutions to the equation \( x^2 - 25 = 0 \) are \( x = 5 \) and \( x = -5 \).
