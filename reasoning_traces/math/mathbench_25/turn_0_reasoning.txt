==================================================

To solve the problem, we first need to understand what "Sample math problem 25" refers to. Since the problem is not explicitly stated, I'll assume it involves a basic arithmetic operation with the number 25. Let's consider a few possibilities and solve them step by step.

### Possibility 1: Simple Arithmetic Operation

Let's assume the problem is to find the square of 25.

**Step 1: Understand the problem**

We need to calculate \( 25^2 \).

**Step 2: Perform the calculation**

\[ 25^2 = 25 \times 25 \]

To multiply 25 by 25, we can use the distributive property:

\[ 25 \times 25 = (20 + 5) \times (20 + 5) \]

Using the distributive property (also known as the FOIL method for binomials):

\[ = 20 \times 20 + 20 \times 5 + 5 \times 20 + 5 \times 5 \]

Calculate each term:

- \( 20 \times 20 = 400 \)
- \( 20 \times 5 = 100 \)
- \( 5 \times 20 = 100 \)
- \( 5 \times 5 = 25 \)

Add them up:

\[ 400 + 100 + 100 + 25 = 625 \]

**Step 3: State the final answer**

The square of 25 is 625.

### Possibility 2: Another Arithmetic Operation

Let's assume the problem is to find the sum of 25 and another number, say 10.

**Step 1: Understand the problem**

We need to calculate \( 25 + 10 \).

**Step 2: Perform the calculation**

\[ 25 + 10 = 35 \]

**Step 3: State the final answer**

The sum of 25 and 10 is 35.

### Conclusion

Without a specific problem statement, I have assumed two possible arithmetic operations involving the number 25. If you have a specific problem in mind, please provide more details so I can assist you accurately.
