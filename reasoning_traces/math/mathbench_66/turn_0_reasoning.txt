To solve the problem, I need more information about "Sample math problem 66." Since the problem statement is not provided, I will create a sample math problem and solve it step by step.

**Sample Math Problem:**

A rectangle has a length that is twice its width. If the perimeter of the rectangle is 66 units, what are the dimensions of the rectangle?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We are given that the perimeter of a rectangle is 66 units.
   - The length of the rectangle is twice its width.

2. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( w \) be the width of the rectangle.
   - Then the length \( l \) is \( 2w \).

3. **Write the Perimeter Formula:**
   - The formula for the perimeter \( P \) of a rectangle is:
     \[
     P = 2l + 2w
     \]
   - We know \( P = 66 \), so:
     \[
     66 = 2(2w) + 2w
     \]

4. **Substitute and Simplify:**
   - Substitute \( l = 2w \) into the perimeter equation:
     \[
     66 = 4w + 2w
     \]
   - Combine like terms:
     \[
     66 = 6w
     \]

5. **Solve for \( w \):**
   - Divide both sides by 6 to solve for \( w \):
     \[
     w = \frac{66}{6} = 11
     \]

6. **Find the Length \( l \):**
   - Since \( l = 2w \), substitute \( w = 11 \):
     \[
     l = 2 \times 11 = 22
     \]

7. **Verify the Solution:**
   - Check the perimeter with the found dimensions:
     \[
     P = 2l + 2w = 2(22) + 2(11) = 44 + 22 = 66
     \]
   - The calculated perimeter matches the given perimeter, confirming our solution is correct.

**Final Answer:**
The dimensions of the rectangle are:
- Width: 11 units
- Length: 22 units
