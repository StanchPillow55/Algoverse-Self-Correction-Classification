==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample math problem 66" refers to. Since the problem is not explicitly stated, I'll assume a generic math problem involving the number 66. Let's create a problem and solve it step by step.

**Problem:**  
Find the sum of all positive divisors of the number 66.

**Step 1: Find the divisors of 66.**

To find the divisors, we need to determine which numbers divide 66 without leaving a remainder. We start by performing prime factorization of 66:

- 66 is an even number, so it is divisible by 2:  
  \( 66 \div 2 = 33 \)

- Next, we factor 33. Since 33 is not divisible by 2, we try the next smallest prime number, which is 3:  
  \( 33 \div 3 = 11 \)

- 11 is a prime number, so we stop here.

Thus, the prime factorization of 66 is \( 2 \times 3 \times 11 \).

**Step 2: List all divisors of 66.**

Using the prime factorization, we can list all divisors by considering all combinations of the prime factors:

- \( 1 \) (no factors)
- \( 2 \) (only the factor 2)
- \( 3 \) (only the factor 3)
- \( 6 \) (factors 2 and 3)
- \( 11 \) (only the factor 11)
- \( 22 \) (factors 2 and 11)
- \( 33 \) (factors 3 and 11)
- \( 66 \) (factors 2, 3, and 11)

Thus, the divisors of 66 are: 1, 2, 3, 6, 11, 22, 33, and 66.

**Step 3: Calculate the sum of the divisors.**

Now, we add up all the divisors:

\[
1 + 2 + 3 + 6 + 11 + 22 + 33 + 66
\]

Let's add them step by step:

- \( 1 + 2 = 3 \)
- \( 3 + 3 = 6 \)
- \( 6 + 6 = 12 \)
- \( 12 + 11 = 23 \)
- \( 23 + 22 = 45 \)
- \( 45 + 33 = 78 \)
- \( 78 + 66 = 144 \)

**Final Answer:**

The sum of all positive divisors of 66 is \( \boxed{144} \).
