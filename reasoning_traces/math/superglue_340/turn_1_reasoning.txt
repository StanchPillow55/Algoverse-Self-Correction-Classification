==================================================

To solve the problem effectively, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 340" entails. Since the problem statement is not explicitly clear, let's assume it involves a typical math problem-solving scenario. I'll create a hypothetical problem and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**

A company produces two types of widgets: Type A and Type B. The production cost for Type A is $5 per unit, and for Type B, it is $8 per unit. The company sells Type A for $10 per unit and Type B for $15 per unit. If the company produces 100 units of Type A and 150 units of Type B, what is the total profit?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Identify the Costs:**
   - Cost of producing Type A = 100 units × $5/unit = $500
   - Cost of producing Type B = 150 units × $8/unit = $1200

2. **Identify the Revenue:**
   - Revenue from selling Type A = 100 units × $10/unit = $1000
   - Revenue from selling Type B = 150 units × $15/unit = $2250

3. **Calculate the Profit:**
   - Profit from Type A = Revenue from Type A - Cost of Type A
     \[
     = \$1000 - \$500 = \$500
     \]
   - Profit from Type B = Revenue from Type B - Cost of Type B
     \[
     = \$2250 - \$1200 = \$1050
     \]

4. **Total Profit:**
   - Total Profit = Profit from Type A + Profit from Type B
     \[
     = \$500 + \$1050 = \$1550
     \]

**Final Answer:**

The total profit from producing and selling 100 units of Type A and 150 units of Type B is $1550.

This hypothetical problem demonstrates a structured approach to solving a typical profit calculation problem, involving identifying costs, revenues, and calculating profits. If "Sample reasoning question 340" refers to a different type of problem, please provide additional details for a more accurate solution.
