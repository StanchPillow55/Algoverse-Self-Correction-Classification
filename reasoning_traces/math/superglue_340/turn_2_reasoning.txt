==================================================

To solve the problem effectively, let's first understand what is being asked. The question is labeled as "Sample reasoning question 340," but it doesn't provide any specific mathematical problem or context. Therefore, I'll assume that the task is to demonstrate a general approach to solving a mathematical reasoning problem.

Since the problem is not specified, I'll create a hypothetical math problem and solve it step by step. Let's consider the following problem:

**Problem:**
A farmer has a rectangular field with a length that is 20 meters longer than its width. The perimeter of the field is 200 meters. What are the dimensions of the field?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   We need to find the length and width of the rectangular field. We know:
   - The length (L) is 20 meters longer than the width (W).
   - The perimeter of the rectangle is 200 meters.

2. **Set Up the Equations:**
   The formula for the perimeter (P) of a rectangle is:
   \[
   P = 2L + 2W
   \]
   We are given that the perimeter is 200 meters, so:
   \[
   2L + 2W = 200
   \]

   We also know that the length is 20 meters longer than the width:
   \[
   L = W + 20
   \]

3. **Substitute and Solve:**
   Substitute the expression for L from the second equation into the perimeter equation:
   \[
   2(W + 20) + 2W = 200
   \]

   Simplify and solve for W:
   \[
   2W + 40 + 2W = 200
   \]
   \[
   4W + 40 = 200
   \]
   Subtract 40 from both sides:
   \[
   4W = 160
   \]
   Divide by 4:
   \[
   W = 40
   \]

4. **Find the Length:**
   Now that we have the width, use the equation \(L = W + 20\) to find the length:
   \[
   L = 40 + 20 = 60
   \]

5. **Verify the Solution:**
   Check if the dimensions satisfy the perimeter condition:
   \[
   2L + 2W = 2(60) + 2(40) = 120 + 80 = 200
   \]
   The calculated perimeter matches the given perimeter, confirming our solution is correct.

**Final Answer:**
The dimensions of the field are 60 meters in length and 40 meters in width.
