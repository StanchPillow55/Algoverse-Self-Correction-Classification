==================================================

To solve the problem effectively, let's first clarify what "Sample reasoning question 340" might entail. Since the problem is not explicitly stated, I'll assume it's a hypothetical math problem that requires logical reasoning and step-by-step calculations. I'll create a sample problem and solve it.

**Sample Problem:**

A company produces two types of gadgets: Type A and Type B. The production cost for Type A is $50 per unit, and for Type B, it is $70 per unit. The company sells Type A for $80 per unit and Type B for $120 per unit. If the company produces 100 units of Type A and 150 units of Type B, what is the total profit?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Identify the Costs:**
   - Cost of producing Type A = $50 per unit
   - Cost of producing Type B = $70 per unit

2. **Identify the Selling Prices:**
   - Selling price of Type A = $80 per unit
   - Selling price of Type B = $120 per unit

3. **Calculate the Total Production Costs:**
   - Total cost for Type A = 100 units × $50/unit = $5,000
   - Total cost for Type B = 150 units × $70/unit = $10,500

4. **Calculate the Total Revenue:**
   - Revenue from Type A = 100 units × $80/unit = $8,000
   - Revenue from Type B = 150 units × $120/unit = $18,000

5. **Calculate the Profit for Each Type:**
   - Profit from Type A = Revenue from Type A - Cost of Type A
     = $8,000 - $5,000 = $3,000
   - Profit from Type B = Revenue from Type B - Cost of Type B
     = $18,000 - $10,500 = $7,500

6. **Calculate the Total Profit:**
   - Total Profit = Profit from Type A + Profit from Type B
   = $3,000 + $7,500 = $10,500

**Final Answer:**

The total profit from producing and selling 100 units of Type A and 150 units of Type B is $10,500.
