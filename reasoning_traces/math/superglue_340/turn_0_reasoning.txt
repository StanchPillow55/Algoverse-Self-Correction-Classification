==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 340" refers to. Since there is no specific math problem given in the question, I'll assume this is a placeholder for a typical math problem. Let's create a sample math problem and solve it step by step.

**Sample Problem:**

A store sells two types of candies: chocolate and gummy bears. The price of a chocolate bar is $2, and the price of a bag of gummy bears is $3. If a customer buys a total of 10 items and spends $24, how many chocolate bars and how many bags of gummy bears did the customer buy?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( x \) be the number of chocolate bars.
   - Let \( y \) be the number of bags of gummy bears.

2. **Set Up Equations:**
   - The total number of items bought is 10: 
     \[
     x + y = 10
     \]
   - The total cost of the items is $24:
     \[
     2x + 3y = 24
     \]

3. **Solve the System of Equations:**

   We have the following system of equations:
   \[
   \begin{align*}
   x + y &= 10 \quad \text{(Equation 1)} \\
   2x + 3y &= 24 \quad \text{(Equation 2)}
   \end{align*}
   \]

   **Substitution Method:**

   - Solve Equation 1 for \( x \):
     \[
     x = 10 - y
     \]

   - Substitute \( x = 10 - y \) into Equation 2:
     \[
     2(10 - y) + 3y = 24
     \]

   - Simplify and solve for \( y \):
     \[
     20 - 2y + 3y = 24
     \]
     \[
     20 + y = 24
     \]
     \[
     y = 24 - 20
     \]
     \[
     y = 4
     \]

   - Substitute \( y = 4 \) back into the expression for \( x \):
     \[
     x = 10 - y = 10 - 4 = 6
     \]

4. **Verify the Solution:**

   - Check the total number of items:
     \[
     x + y = 6 + 4 = 10
     \]
     This satisfies the first equation.

   - Check the total cost:
     \[
     2x + 3y = 2(6) + 3(4) = 12 + 12 = 24
     \]
     This satisfies the second equation.

5. **Conclusion:**

   The customer bought 6 chocolate bars and 4 bags of gummy bears.

**Final Answer:**

The customer bought 6 chocolate bars and 4 bags of gummy bears.
