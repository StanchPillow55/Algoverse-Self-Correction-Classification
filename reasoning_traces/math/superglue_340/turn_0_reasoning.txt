==================================================

To solve the problem, I need more information about what "Sample reasoning question 340" entails. Since the question is not specified, I'll demonstrate how to approach a general math problem by creating a sample problem and solving it step by step.

### Sample Problem:
**Problem:** A company sells two products, A and B. Product A costs $50 and Product B costs $30. In one week, the company sold a total of 100 products and made $3,800 in revenue. How many of each product did the company sell?

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( x \) be the number of Product A sold.
   - Let \( y \) be the number of Product B sold.

2. **Set Up Equations:**
   - The total number of products sold is 100:
     \[
     x + y = 100
     \]
   - The total revenue from selling these products is $3,800:
     \[
     50x + 30y = 3800
     \]

3. **Solve the System of Equations:**

   We have the system of equations:
   \[
   \begin{align*}
   1. & \quad x + y = 100 \\
   2. & \quad 50x + 30y = 3800
   \end{align*}
   \]

   **Substitution Method:**

   From equation 1, express \( y \) in terms of \( x \):
   \[
   y = 100 - x
   \]

   Substitute \( y = 100 - x \) into equation 2:
   \[
   50x + 30(100 - x) = 3800
   \]

   Simplify and solve for \( x \):
   \[
   50x + 3000 - 30x = 3800
   \]
   \[
   20x + 3000 = 3800
   \]
   \[
   20x = 800
   \]
   \[
   x = 40
   \]

   Substitute \( x = 40 \) back into the expression for \( y \):
   \[
   y = 100 - 40 = 60
   \]

4. **Verify the Solution:**

   Check the solution in both original equations:
   - For equation 1: \( x + y = 40 + 60 = 100 \) (True)
   - For equation 2: \( 50x + 30y = 50(40) + 30(60) = 2000 + 1800 = 3800 \) (True)

Both equations are satisfied, confirming the solution is correct.

### Final Answer:
The company sold 40 units of Product A and 60 units of Product B.
