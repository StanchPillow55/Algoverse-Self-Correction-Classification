Question ID: 326
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine the average cost of each book Fred purchased. Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Determine the Total Amount Spent on Books:**
   - Fred started with 236 dollars.
   - After buying the books, he had 14 dollars left.
   - To find out how much he spent on the books, we subtract the amount he had left from the amount he started with:
     \[
     \text{Total spent} = 236 - 14 = 222 \text{ dollars}
     \]

2. **Calculate the Average Cost per Book:**
   - Fred bought 6 books.
   - The total amount spent on the books was 222 dollars.
   - To find the average cost per book, we divide the total amount spent by the number of books:
     \[
     \text{Average cost per book} = \frac{222}{6}
     \]

3. **Perform the Division:**
   - Divide 222 by 6:
     \[
     222 \div 6 = 37
     \]

   - Let's verify this division:
     - 6 goes into 22 three times (since \(6 \times 3 = 18\)), leaving a remainder of 4.
     - Bring down the next digit (2) to make it 42.
     - 6 goes into 42 seven times (since \(6 \times 7 = 42\)), with no remainder.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The average cost of each book is 37 dollars.

Therefore, the final answer is that each book cost, on average, 37 dollars.
