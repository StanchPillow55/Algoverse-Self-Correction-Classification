==================================================

Let's denote the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal as \( x \).

1. **Initial number of people on the bus**: 
   - At the terminal, there are \( x \) people.

2. **First bus stop**:
   - At the first bus stop, 5 more people got on the bus. 
   - Therefore, the total number of people on the bus after the first stop is:
     \[
     x + 5
     \]

3. **Second bus stop**:
   - At the second bus stop, 7 people got down and 8 more got in.
   - The number of people after 7 got down is:
     \[
     (x + 5) - 7 = x - 2
     \]
   - Then, 8 more people got on:
     \[
     (x - 2) + 8 = x + 6
     \]

4. **Total number of people heading to the third stop**:
   - We know that there were a total of 20 people heading to the third stop. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
     \[
     x + 6 = 20
     \]

5. **Solving for \( x \)**:
   - To find \( x \), we subtract 6 from both sides:
     \[
     x = 20 - 6
     \]
     \[
     x = 14
     \]

Thus, the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal is \( \boxed{14} \).
