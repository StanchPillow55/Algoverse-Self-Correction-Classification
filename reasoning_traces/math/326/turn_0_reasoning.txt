==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine the average cost of each book that Fred purchased. We can do this by following these steps:

1. **Determine the total amount spent on the books:**

   Fred started with 236 dollars and ended up with 14 dollars after buying the books. To find out how much he spent, we subtract the amount he had left from the amount he started with:

   \[
   \text{Total amount spent} = \text{Initial amount} - \text{Remaining amount}
   \]

   \[
   \text{Total amount spent} = 236 - 14 = 222 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Calculate the average cost per book:**

   Fred bought 6 books with the 222 dollars he spent. To find the average cost per book, we divide the total amount spent by the number of books:

   \[
   \text{Average cost per book} = \frac{\text{Total amount spent}}{\text{Number of books}}
   \]

   \[
   \text{Average cost per book} = \frac{222}{6}
   \]

3. **Perform the division:**

   To find \(\frac{222}{6}\), we perform the division:

   \[
   222 \div 6 = 37
   \]

   Therefore, the average cost of each book is 37 dollars.

4. **Conclusion:**

   After performing the calculations, we find that the average cost of each book Fred bought is 37 dollars.

**Final Answer:**

The average cost of each book is 37 dollars.
