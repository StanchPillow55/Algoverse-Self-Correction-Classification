Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To find out how much each book cost on average, we can follow these steps:

1. **Determine how much money Fred spent on the books.**
   - Fred started with 236 dollars.
   - After buying the books, he had 14 dollars left.
   - To find out how much he spent, we subtract the amount he has left from the amount he started with:

   \[
   \text{Amount spent} = \text{Initial amount} - \text{Amount left}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Amount spent} = 236 - 14 = 222 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Calculate the average cost per book.**
   - Fred bought 6 books, and we know he spent a total of 222 dollars on them.
   - To find the average cost per book, we divide the total amount spent by the number of books:

   \[
   \text{Average cost per book} = \frac{\text{Total amount spent}}{\text{Number of books}}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Average cost per book} = \frac{222}{6}
   \]

3. **Perform the division.**
   - Now we calculate \( \frac{222}{6} \):

   \[
   222 \div 6 = 37
   \]

Thus, the average cost of each book is 37 dollars.

**Final Answer:**
The average cost of each book is 37 dollars.
