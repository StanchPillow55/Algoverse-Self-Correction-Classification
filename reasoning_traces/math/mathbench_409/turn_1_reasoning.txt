Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample math problem 409" refers to. Since the problem itself isn't provided, I'll assume it's a hypothetical problem and create a sample math problem to solve. Let's consider a problem involving basic algebra:

**Problem:**

Solve for \( x \) in the equation:

\[ 3x + 5 = 20 \]

**Step-by-step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Equation:**
   The equation given is \( 3x + 5 = 20 \). Our goal is to solve for \( x \).

2. **Isolate the Variable:**
   To isolate \( x \), we need to get rid of the constant term on the left side of the equation. We can do this by subtracting 5 from both sides of the equation.

   \[
   3x + 5 - 5 = 20 - 5
   \]

   Simplifying both sides gives:

   \[
   3x = 15
   \]

3. **Solve for \( x \):**
   Now, we need to solve for \( x \) by getting rid of the coefficient of \( x \), which is 3. We do this by dividing both sides of the equation by 3.

   \[
   \frac{3x}{3} = \frac{15}{3}
   \]

   Simplifying both sides gives:

   \[
   x = 5
   \]

4. **Verify the Solution:**
   To ensure our solution is correct, we substitute \( x = 5 \) back into the original equation to check if both sides are equal.

   \[
   3(5) + 5 = 20
   \]

   Simplifying the left side:

   \[
   15 + 5 = 20
   \]

   \[
   20 = 20
   \]

   Since both sides of the equation are equal, our solution is verified.

**Final Answer:**

The solution to the equation \( 3x + 5 = 20 \) is \( x = 5 \).
