Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem labeled "Sample math problem 409," we need to first understand what the problem is asking. However, since the problem statement is not provided, I will create a hypothetical math problem labeled "Sample math problem 409" and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**

"Sample math problem 409: A rectangle has a length that is 3 times its width. If the perimeter of the rectangle is 48 units, find the dimensions of the rectangle."

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( w \) be the width of the rectangle.
   - Since the length is 3 times the width, let the length be \( 3w \).

2. **Write the Formula for Perimeter:**
   - The formula for the perimeter \( P \) of a rectangle is given by:
     \[
     P = 2(\text{length} + \text{width})
     \]

3. **Substitute the Known Values:**
   - Substitute the expressions for length and width into the perimeter formula:
     \[
     48 = 2(3w + w)
     \]

4. **Simplify the Equation:**
   - Simplify inside the parentheses:
     \[
     48 = 2(4w)
     \]
   - Simplify further:
     \[
     48 = 8w
     \]

5. **Solve for \( w \):**
   - Divide both sides by 8 to solve for \( w \):
     \[
     w = \frac{48}{8} = 6
     \]

6. **Find the Length:**
   - Since the length is 3 times the width:
     \[
     \text{Length} = 3w = 3 \times 6 = 18
     \]

7. **Verify the Solution:**
   - Check if the calculated dimensions satisfy the original perimeter condition:
     \[
     P = 2(\text{length} + \text{width}) = 2(18 + 6) = 2 \times 24 = 48
     \]
   - The calculated perimeter matches the given perimeter, confirming the solution is correct.

**Final Answer:**

The dimensions of the rectangle are:
- Width = 6 units
- Length = 18 units
