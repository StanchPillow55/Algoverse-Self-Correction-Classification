Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we first need to understand what "Sample math problem 409" refers to. Since the problem itself is not explicitly stated, I will assume that "409" is the key part of the problem and will explore mathematical operations and properties related to this number.

### Step 1: Understanding the Number 409
409 is a positive integer. Let's explore some of its properties:

1. **Prime Factorization**: 
   - To determine if 409 is a prime number, we need to check if it has any divisors other than 1 and itself.
   - Check divisibility by smaller prime numbers: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, etc.
   - 409 is odd, so it is not divisible by 2.
   - The sum of the digits of 409 is 4 + 0 + 9 = 13, which is not divisible by 3, so 409 is not divisible by 3.
   - 409 does not end in 0 or 5, so it is not divisible by 5.
   - For 7, 11, 13, 17, and 19, perform division to check:
     - \( 409 \div 7 \approx 58.4286 \) (not an integer)
     - \( 409 \div 11 \approx 37.1818 \) (not an integer)
     - \( 409 \div 13 \approx 31.4615 \) (not an integer)
     - \( 409 \div 17 \approx 24.0588 \) (not an integer)
     - \( 409 \div 19 \approx 21.5263 \) (not an integer)
   - Since 409 is not divisible by any of these primes, 409 is a prime number.

### Step 2: Properties of 409
- **Prime Number**: As established, 409 is a prime number.
- **Odd Number**: 409 is odd because it is not divisible by 2.
- **Number of Divisors**: Since 409 is prime, it has exactly two divisors: 1 and 409.

### Step 3: Mathematical Operations Involving 409
- **Square of 409**: 
  \[
  409^2 = 409 \times 409 = 167281
  \]
- **Square Root of 409**: 
  - The square root of 409 is not an integer. Approximating:
  \[
  \sqrt{409} \approx 20.2237
  \]

### Step 4: Conclusion
Given the exploration of the number 409, we have determined that it is a prime number with interesting properties. If the problem required specific operations or further exploration, those would be addressed based on additional context.

**Final Answer**: 409 is a prime number.
