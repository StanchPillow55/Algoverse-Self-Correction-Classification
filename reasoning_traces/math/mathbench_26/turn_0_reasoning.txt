==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample math problem 26" refers to. Since the problem statement is not provided, I'll assume this is a placeholder for a specific math problem. Without the actual problem, I can't provide a specific solution. However, I can guide you through a general approach to solving math problems.

Here's a step-by-step approach to solving a typical math problem:

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - Read the problem carefully.
   - Identify what is being asked.
   - Note down the given information and any constraints.

2. **Devise a Plan:**
   - Think about the mathematical concepts that apply to the problem.
   - Consider similar problems you have solved before.
   - Decide on a strategy to solve the problem (e.g., algebraic manipulation, drawing a diagram, etc.).

3. **Carry Out the Plan:**
   - Execute your chosen strategy step by step.
   - Perform calculations carefully.
   - Keep track of units and signs.

4. **Check Your Work:**
   - Review each step to ensure there are no errors.
   - Verify that your solution makes sense in the context of the problem.
   - Check if there is another method to solve the problem and compare results.

5. **State the Final Answer:**
   - Clearly write down the answer.
   - Include units if applicable.

Since I don't have the specific details of "Sample math problem 26," I can't provide a detailed solution. If you can provide the actual problem, I'd be happy to help solve it!
