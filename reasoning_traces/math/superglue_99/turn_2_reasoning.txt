==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample reasoning question 99," we need to first understand what the problem is asking. However, the problem statement provided is not clear or complete. It seems to be a placeholder or a reference to a specific problem that is not fully described here. Without additional context or details, it's challenging to provide a specific solution.

Let's assume that "Sample reasoning question 99" refers to a hypothetical math problem. In order to solve it, we would typically follow these steps:

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - Identify what is being asked.
   - Determine what information is given.
   - Recognize any constraints or conditions.

2. **Devise a Plan:**
   - Consider possible strategies to solve the problem. This could involve algebraic manipulation, drawing diagrams, logical reasoning, or applying known formulas.

3. **Carry Out the Plan:**
   - Execute the chosen strategy step by step.
   - Perform calculations carefully.
   - Keep track of units and ensure consistency.

4. **Review/Check the Solution:**
   - Verify that the solution meets all the conditions of the problem.
   - Check calculations for accuracy.
   - Consider whether the answer is reasonable.

Since we don't have a specific problem to solve, let's create a simple example to illustrate the process:

**Example Problem:**
Find the sum of the first 10 positive integers.

**Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We need to find the sum of the first 10 positive integers: 1, 2, 3, ..., 10.

2. **Devise a Plan:**
   - Use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series: 
     \[
     S_n = \frac{n}{2} \times (a + l)
     \]
     where \( n \) is the number of terms, \( a \) is the first term, and \( l \) is the last term.

3. **Carry Out the Plan:**
   - Here, \( n = 10 \), \( a = 1 \), and \( l = 10 \).
   - Substitute these values into the formula:
     \[
     S_{10} = \frac{10}{2} \times (1 + 10) = 5 \times 11 = 55
     \]

4. **Review/Check the Solution:**
   - Verify by adding the numbers directly: 
     \[
     1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 10 = 55
     \]
   - The calculated sum matches the direct addition, confirming the solution is correct.

**Final Answer:**
The sum of the first 10 positive integers is 55.
