==================================================

To solve "Sample reasoning question 99," we need to first understand what the question is asking. However, since the question is not fully specified, I'll demonstrate a general approach to solving a math problem by assuming a hypothetical problem. Let's assume the problem is:

**Problem:**
Calculate the sum of the first 99 positive integers.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   We need to find the sum of the first 99 positive integers. This is a well-known problem that can be solved using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series.

2. **Identify the Arithmetic Series:**
   The series of the first 99 positive integers is: 1, 2, 3, ..., 99.
   This is an arithmetic series where the first term \( a = 1 \) and the last term \( l = 99 \).

3. **Use the Formula for the Sum of an Arithmetic Series:**
   The formula for the sum \( S_n \) of the first \( n \) terms of an arithmetic series is:
   \[
   S_n = \frac{n}{2} \times (a + l)
   \]
   where \( n \) is the number of terms, \( a \) is the first term, and \( l \) is the last term.

4. **Substitute the Values:**
   Here, \( n = 99 \), \( a = 1 \), and \( l = 99 \).
   \[
   S_{99} = \frac{99}{2} \times (1 + 99)
   \]

5. **Calculate the Sum:**
   \[
   S_{99} = \frac{99}{2} \times 100
   \]
   \[
   S_{99} = 49.5 \times 100
   \]
   \[
   S_{99} = 4950
   \]

6. **Verify the Calculation:**
   To ensure the calculation is correct, we can verify using another method, such as pairing numbers:
   - Pair the first and last numbers: (1 + 99), (2 + 98), ..., (49 + 51), and the middle number 50.
   - Each pair sums to 100, and there are 49 pairs plus the middle number 50.
   - Total sum = \( 49 \times 100 + 50 = 4950 \).

**Final Answer:**
The sum of the first 99 positive integers is 4950.
