Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem effectively, let's first clarify the task at hand. The question is labeled as "Sample reasoning question 99," but without additional context or specific details about the problem, it's difficult to provide a precise solution. However, I can guide you through a general approach to solving reasoning problems, especially if they involve mathematical or logical reasoning.

### Step-by-Step Approach:

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - Carefully read the problem statement. Identify what is being asked and what information is provided.
   - Determine if there are any implicit assumptions or constraints.

2. **Identify the Type of Problem:**
   - Is it a mathematical problem involving calculations?
   - Is it a logical reasoning problem requiring deduction or pattern recognition?
   - Is it a word problem that needs translation into mathematical expressions?

3. **Gather Information:**
   - List out all known quantities, variables, and relationships.
   - If applicable, draw diagrams or charts to visualize the problem.

4. **Develop a Plan:**
   - Decide on a strategy to tackle the problem. This could involve:
     - Setting up equations
     - Using logical deductions
     - Applying known formulas or theorems
     - Breaking the problem into smaller, manageable parts

5. **Execute the Plan:**
   - Carry out the necessary calculations or logical steps.
   - Ensure each step logically follows from the previous one.
   - Keep track of units and ensure consistency throughout.

6. **Check Your Work:**
   - Review each step to ensure there are no errors.
   - Verify that the solution satisfies all conditions of the problem.
   - Consider alternative methods to confirm the result.

7. **State the Final Answer:**
   - Clearly present the solution, ensuring it directly addresses the question asked.
   - Include units or labels if applicable.

### Example of a Reasoning Problem:

Since the original problem is unspecified, let's consider a simple example:

**Problem:** If a train travels at a speed of 60 miles per hour, how long will it take to travel 180 miles?

**Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We need to find the time it takes for a train to travel 180 miles at a speed of 60 miles per hour.

2. **Identify the Type of Problem:**
   - This is a straightforward distance-speed-time problem.

3. **Gather Information:**
   - Speed = 60 miles per hour
   - Distance = 180 miles

4. **Develop a Plan:**
   - Use the formula: Time = Distance / Speed

5. **Execute the Plan:**
   - Time = 180 miles / 60 miles per hour = 3 hours

6. **Check Your Work:**
   - Verify the calculation: 60 miles per hour * 3 hours = 180 miles, which matches the given distance.

7. **State the Final Answer:**
   - It will take 3 hours for the train to travel 180 miles.

### Conclusion:

Without specific details about "Sample reasoning question 99," this general approach provides a structured method to tackle reasoning problems. If you have more information or a specific problem statement, please provide it, and I can offer a more targeted solution.
