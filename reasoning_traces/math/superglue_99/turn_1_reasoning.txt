==================================================

To solve a problem effectively, it's important to understand the context and details of the problem. However, the question "Sample reasoning question 99" does not provide specific details or context about what the problem entails. Therefore, I will demonstrate a general approach to solving a reasoning problem by creating a hypothetical example and working through it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**

Let's assume "Sample reasoning question 99" is a logic puzzle involving numbers. Here's a sample problem:

**Problem:**  
You have a sequence of numbers: 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, ...  
What is the 10th number in this sequence?

**Step-by-step Solution:**

1. **Identify the Pattern:**
   - Look at the sequence: 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, ...
   - Notice that each number is obtained by multiplying the previous number by 2.
   - This is a geometric sequence where each term is twice the previous term.

2. **Define the Sequence Formula:**
   - In a geometric sequence, the nth term can be expressed as:
     \[
     a_n = a_1 \times r^{(n-1)}
     \]
     where \( a_1 \) is the first term, \( r \) is the common ratio, and \( n \) is the term number.
   - Here, \( a_1 = 2 \) and \( r = 2 \).

3. **Calculate the 10th Term:**
   - Substitute the known values into the formula:
     \[
     a_{10} = 2 \times 2^{(10-1)}
     \]
     \[
     a_{10} = 2 \times 2^9
     \]
     \[
     a_{10} = 2 \times 512
     \]
     \[
     a_{10} = 1024
     \]

4. **Verify the Calculation:**
   - Calculate \( 2^9 \) separately to ensure accuracy:
     \[
     2^9 = 512
     \]
   - Multiply by 2:
     \[
     2 \times 512 = 1024
     \]

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The 10th number in the sequence is 1024.

**Final Answer:**
The 10th number in the sequence is 1024.

This approach demonstrates how to identify patterns, apply mathematical formulas, and verify calculations to solve a reasoning problem. If you have a specific problem or context in mind, please provide more details, and I can tailor the solution accordingly.
