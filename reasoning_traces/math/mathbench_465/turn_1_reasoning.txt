Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, I need to first understand what "Sample math problem 465" refers to. Since this is not a standard reference and no specific details are provided, I'll assume it's a placeholder for a generic math problem. Without specific details, I can't solve a particular problem, but I can guide you through a typical problem-solving process.

Let's assume "Sample math problem 465" is a typical algebra problem. I'll create a sample problem and solve it step by step.

**Sample Problem:**
Solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   We need to find the value of \( x \) that makes the equation true.

2. **Isolate the Variable:**
   To solve for \( x \), we need to get \( x \) by itself on one side of the equation.

3. **Subtract 3 from Both Sides:**
   \[
   2x + 3 - 3 = 11 - 3
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   2x = 8
   \]

4. **Divide Both Sides by 2:**
   \[
   \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{8}{2}
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   x = 4
   \]

5. **Check the Solution:**
   Substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation to verify:
   \[
   2(4) + 3 = 11
   \]
   \[
   8 + 3 = 11
   \]
   \[
   11 = 11
   \]
   The left side equals the right side, confirming that \( x = 4 \) is correct.

**Final Answer:**
The solution to the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \) is \( x = 4 \).

If you have a specific problem in mind, please provide the details, and I can solve that particular problem for you.
