==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample math problem 465" entails. Since the problem is not explicitly stated, I'll assume a generic math problem and solve it step by step. Let's consider a problem involving algebra, which is common in math problem sets.

**Problem:**
Solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 3x + 5 = 20 \).

**Step 1: Isolate the variable term.**

The equation given is:
\[ 3x + 5 = 20 \]

To isolate the term with the variable \( x \), we need to get rid of the constant term on the left side. We do this by subtracting 5 from both sides of the equation:

\[ 3x + 5 - 5 = 20 - 5 \]

This simplifies to:

\[ 3x = 15 \]

**Step 2: Solve for the variable.**

Now, we need to solve for \( x \). Since \( 3x \) means 3 times \( x \), we can solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides of the equation by 3:

\[ \frac{3x}{3} = \frac{15}{3} \]

This simplifies to:

\[ x = 5 \]

**Step 3: Verify the solution.**

To ensure our solution is correct, we substitute \( x = 5 \) back into the original equation:

\[ 3(5) + 5 = 20 \]

Calculate the left side:

\[ 15 + 5 = 20 \]

Since both sides of the equation are equal, our solution is verified.

**Final Answer:**
The solution to the equation \( 3x + 5 = 20 \) is \( x = 5 \).
