==================================================

To solve "Sample math problem 39," we need to first understand what the problem entails. Since the problem is not specified, let's assume a general approach to solving a math problem by breaking it down into steps. I'll create a hypothetical problem and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**
Solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 3x + 5 = 20 \).

**Step 1: Understand the Problem**
The equation \( 3x + 5 = 20 \) is a linear equation in one variable. Our goal is to find the value of \( x \) that makes this equation true.

**Step 2: Isolate the Variable**
To solve for \( x \), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We start by eliminating the constant term on the left side.

- Subtract 5 from both sides of the equation:
  \[
  3x + 5 - 5 = 20 - 5
  \]
  Simplifying both sides gives:
  \[
  3x = 15
  \]

**Step 3: Solve for \( x \)**
Now, we need to solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides of the equation by the coefficient of \( x \), which is 3.

- Divide both sides by 3:
  \[
  \frac{3x}{3} = \frac{15}{3}
  \]
  Simplifying both sides gives:
  \[
  x = 5
  \]

**Step 4: Verify the Solution**
To ensure our solution is correct, we substitute \( x = 5 \) back into the original equation and check if both sides are equal.

- Substitute \( x = 5 \) into the original equation:
  \[
  3(5) + 5 = 20
  \]
  Simplifying the left side gives:
  \[
  15 + 5 = 20
  \]
  \[
  20 = 20
  \]
  Since both sides are equal, our solution is verified.

**Final Answer:**
The solution to the equation \( 3x + 5 = 20 \) is \( x = 5 \).
