==================================================

To determine the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow, we need to analyze the different scenarios that could occur based on the information given.

1. **Substitute Teacher Scenario**:
   - There is a 50% chance that there will be a substitute teacher. If there is a substitute, Marcus does not have to turn in his homework.
   - Therefore, if a substitute teacher is present, the probability that Marcus has to turn in his homework is 0%.

2. **Normal Teacher Scenario**:
   - If there is no substitute teacher (which happens with a 50% probability), we then consider the normal teacher's actions.
   - There is a 40% chance that the normal teacher will give an extension. If she gives an extension, Marcus does not have to turn in his homework.
   - Therefore, if the normal teacher is present and gives an extension, the probability that Marcus has to turn in his homework is again 0%.

3. **No Extension Scenario**:
   - If the normal teacher does not give an extension (which happens with a 60% probability), we then consider the possibility that Marcus can convince the teacher that his dog ate his homework.
   - There is a 20% chance that Marcus can convince the teacher to give him a personal extension. If he convinces her, he does not have to turn in his homework.
   - Therefore, if the teacher does not give an extension and Marcus does not convince her, the probability that he has to turn in his homework is 100%.

Now, let's calculate the overall probability that Marcus will have to turn in his homework.

### Step-by-Step Calculation:

1. **Probability of Substitute Teacher**:
   - Probability of substitute teacher = 50% = 0.5
   - Probability of having to turn in homework if substitute = 0%
   - Contribution to total probability = \(0.5 \times 0 = 0\)

2. **Probability of Normal Teacher**:
   - Probability of normal teacher = 50% = 0.5
   - Probability of extension from normal teacher = 40% = 0.4
   - Probability of having to turn in homework if extension is given = 0%
   - Contribution to total probability from extension = \(0.5 \times 0.4 \times 0 = 0\)

   - Probability of no extension from normal teacher = 60% = 0.6
   - Probability of convincing the teacher = 20% = 0.2
   - Probability of having to turn in homework if no extension and not convincing = 100% = 1
   - Contribution to total probability from no extension and not convincing = 
     \[
     0.5 \times 0.6 \times (1 - 0.2) = 0.5 \times 0.6 \times 0.8 = 0.5 \times 0.48 = 0.24
     \]

### Final Calculation:
Now we sum up the contributions to find the total probability that Marcus has to turn in his homework:

\[
\text{Total Probability} = 0 + 0 + 0.24 = 0.24
\]

### Convert to Percentage:
To express this probability as a percentage, we multiply by 100:

\[
0.24 \times 100 = 24\%
\]

### Conclusion:
The percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow is **24%**.
