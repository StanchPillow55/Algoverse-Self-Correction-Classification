To determine the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow, we need to analyze the different scenarios that could occur based on the information provided.

1. **Substitute Teacher Scenario**:
   - There is a 50% chance that a substitute teacher will be present. If a substitute is present, Marcus will not have to turn in his homework.
   - Therefore, if a substitute teacher is present, the probability of having to turn in homework is 0%.

2. **Normal Teacher Scenario**:
   - If the normal teacher is present (which happens with a probability of 50%), we need to consider the next two possibilities:
     - **Extension Given**: There is a 40% chance that the normal teacher will give everyone an extension. If this happens, Marcus will not have to turn in his homework.
     - **No Extension Given**: If the teacher does not give an extension (which happens with a probability of 60%), we then consider Marcus's chance of convincing the teacher that his dog ate his homework.
       - **Convincing the Teacher**: There is a 20% chance that Marcus can convince the teacher to give him a personal extension. If he convinces her, he will not have to turn in his homework.
       - **Not Convincing the Teacher**: If he does not convince her (which happens with a probability of 80%), he will have to turn in his homework.

Now, let's calculate the probabilities step by step.

### Step 1: Calculate the probability of having to turn in homework if the normal teacher is present.

- Probability of the normal teacher being present: \( P(N) = 0.5 \)
- Probability of the teacher giving an extension: \( P(E) = 0.4 \)
- Probability of the teacher not giving an extension: \( P(NE) = 0.6 \)
- Probability of Marcus convincing the teacher: \( P(C) = 0.2 \)
- Probability of Marcus not convincing the teacher: \( P(NC) = 0.8 \)

If the normal teacher is present:
- Probability of having to turn in homework if the teacher gives an extension: \( P(H | E) = 0 \)
- Probability of having to turn in homework if the teacher does not give an extension and Marcus convinces her: \( P(H | NE \cap C) = 0 \)
- Probability of having to turn in homework if the teacher does not give an extension and Marcus does not convince her: \( P(H | NE \cap NC) = 1 \)

Now we can calculate the total probability of having to turn in homework when the normal teacher is present:

\[
P(H | N) = P(E) \cdot P(H | E) + P(NE) \cdot (P(C) \cdot P(H | NE \cap C) + P(NC) \cdot P(H | NE \cap NC))
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
P(H | N) = 0.4 \cdot 0 + 0.6 \cdot (0.2 \cdot 0 + 0.8 \cdot 1)
\]
\[
P(H | N) = 0 + 0.6 \cdot 0.8
\]
\[
P(H | N) = 0.48
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the overall probability of having to turn in homework.

Now we combine the probabilities from both scenarios (substitute teacher and normal teacher):

\[
P(H) = P(S) \cdot P(H | S) + P(N) \cdot P(H | N)
\]

Where:
- \( P(S) = 0.5 \) (probability of substitute teacher)
- \( P(H | S) = 0 \) (probability of having to turn in homework with substitute)
- \( P(N) = 0.5 \) (probability of normal teacher)
- \( P(H | N) = 0.48 \) (calculated above)

Substituting the values:

\[
P(H) = 0.5 \cdot 0 + 0.5 \cdot 0.48
\]
\[
P(H) = 0 + 0.24
\]
\[
P(H) = 0.24
\]

### Final Answer

To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100:

\[
P(H) = 0.24 \times 100 = 24\%
\]

Thus, the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow is **24%**.
