==================================================

To determine the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow, we need to analyze the different scenarios that could occur based on the probabilities given.

1. **Substitute Teacher Scenario**:
   - There is a 50% chance that there will be a substitute teacher. If there is a substitute teacher, Marcus will not have to turn in his homework.
   - Therefore, the probability that he will **not** have to turn in his homework due to a substitute teacher is 50% (or 0.5).

2. **Normal Teacher Scenario**:
   - If the normal teacher comes in (which has a 50% chance), we need to consider the next two possibilities:
     - There is a 40% chance that the teacher will give everyone an extension. If this happens, Marcus will not have to turn in his homework.
     - There is a 60% chance that the teacher will not give an extension. If the teacher does not give an extension, we then consider the possibility that Marcus can convince the teacher that his dog ate his homework.
       - There is a 20% chance that Marcus can convince the teacher to give him a personal extension. If he convinces her, he will not have to turn in his homework.
       - Conversely, there is an 80% chance that he cannot convince her, and he will have to turn in his homework.

Now, let's calculate the probabilities step by step:

### Step 1: Probability of Not Having to Turn in Homework with Normal Teacher

- Probability of normal teacher = 50% (0.5)
- Probability of extension from the teacher = 40% (0.4)
- Probability of no extension from the teacher = 60% (0.6)
- Probability of convincing the teacher for a personal extension = 20% (0.2)
- Probability of not convincing the teacher = 80% (0.8)

Now, we can calculate the probability that Marcus does not have to turn in his homework if the normal teacher is present:

1. **If the normal teacher gives an extension**:
   - Probability = 0.5 (normal teacher) * 0.4 (extension) = 0.2 (20%)

2. **If the normal teacher does not give an extension, but Marcus convinces her**:
   - Probability = 0.5 (normal teacher) * 0.6 (no extension) * 0.2 (convince) = 0.06 (6%)

Adding these two probabilities gives us the total probability of not having to turn in homework with the normal teacher:

\[
P(\text{not turn in homework | normal teacher}) = 0.2 + 0.06 = 0.26
\]

### Step 2: Total Probability of Not Having to Turn in Homework

Now we combine the probabilities from both scenarios (substitute teacher and normal teacher):

1. **Substitute Teacher**: 
   - Probability of not turning in homework = 0.5

2. **Normal Teacher**: 
   - Probability of not turning in homework = 0.26

Now we calculate the total probability of not having to turn in homework:

\[
P(\text{not turn in homework}) = P(\text{substitute}) + P(\text{normal teacher}) \cdot P(\text{not turn in homework | normal teacher})
\]

\[
P(\text{not turn in homework}) = 0.5 + 0.5 \cdot 0.26 = 0.5 + 0.13 = 0.63
\]

### Step 3: Probability of Having to Turn in Homework

To find the probability that Marcus will have to turn in his homework, we subtract the probability of not having to turn in homework from 1:

\[
P(\text{turn in homework}) = 1 - P(\text{not turn in homework}) = 1 - 0.63 = 0.37
\]

### Final Answer

To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100:

\[
P(\text{turn in homework}) = 0.37 \times 100 = 37\%
\]

Thus, the percentage chance that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow is **37%**.
