==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 284" refers to. Since there is no specific mathematical problem given in your question, I will create a hypothetical math problem and solve it step by step. 

Let's assume the problem is as follows:

**Problem:**
A rectangle has a length that is 4 units more than its width. If the perimeter of the rectangle is 28 units, find the dimensions of the rectangle.

**Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We have a rectangle with a length (L) and a width (W).
   - The length is 4 units more than the width: \( L = W + 4 \).
   - The perimeter of the rectangle is 28 units.

2. **Recall the Formula for Perimeter:**
   - The perimeter (P) of a rectangle is given by the formula: 
     \[
     P = 2L + 2W
     \]

3. **Set Up the Equation:**
   - Substitute the given perimeter into the formula:
     \[
     2L + 2W = 28
     \]
   - Substitute \( L = W + 4 \) into the equation:
     \[
     2(W + 4) + 2W = 28
     \]

4. **Simplify and Solve for W:**
   - Distribute the 2 in the equation:
     \[
     2W + 8 + 2W = 28
     \]
   - Combine like terms:
     \[
     4W + 8 = 28
     \]
   - Subtract 8 from both sides:
     \[
     4W = 20
     \]
   - Divide both sides by 4:
     \[
     W = 5
     \]

5. **Find the Length:**
   - Use the relationship \( L = W + 4 \):
     \[
     L = 5 + 4 = 9
     \]

6. **Verify the Solution:**
   - Check the perimeter with the found dimensions:
     \[
     P = 2L + 2W = 2(9) + 2(5) = 18 + 10 = 28
     \]
   - The calculated perimeter matches the given perimeter, confirming our solution is correct.

**Final Answer:**
The dimensions of the rectangle are a width of 5 units and a length of 9 units.
