==================================================

To solve a math problem effectively, it's important to follow a structured approach. However, the problem statement you've provided, "Sample reasoning question 284," lacks specific details or context. Therefore, I'll demonstrate a general approach to solving a typical math problem by creating a hypothetical problem and solving it step-by-step.

### Hypothetical Problem:
**Problem:** Solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We need to find the value of \( x \) that satisfies the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).

2. **Isolate the Variable:**
   - To solve for \( x \), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We start by eliminating the constant term on the left side.
   - Subtract 3 from both sides of the equation:
     \[
     2x + 3 - 3 = 11 - 3
     \]
     \[
     2x = 8
     \]

3. **Solve for \( x \):**
   - Now, divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( x \):
     \[
     \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{8}{2}
     \]
     \[
     x = 4
     \]

4. **Verify the Solution:**
   - Substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies the equation:
     \[
     2(4) + 3 = 11
     \]
     \[
     8 + 3 = 11
     \]
   - Since both sides of the equation are equal, \( x = 4 \) is indeed the correct solution.

5. **State the Final Answer:**
   - The solution to the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \) is \( x = 4 \).

This structured approach—understanding the problem, isolating the variable, solving for the variable, verifying the solution, and stating the final answer—can be applied to a wide range of algebraic problems. If you have a specific problem or need further assistance, please provide more details, and I'll be happy to help!
