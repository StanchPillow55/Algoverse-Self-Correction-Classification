Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine the total cost of the gift based on the information given about how the cost is shared among the friends.

Let's define the variables:
- Let \( C \) be the total cost of the gift in dollars.
- Let \( x \) be the original share per person when all ten friends were contributing.

Initially, the cost per person when all ten friends were contributing is:
\[
x = \frac{C}{10}
\]

After four friends drop out, there are \( 10 - 4 = 6 \) friends left. The new cost per person is:
\[
\frac{C}{6}
\]

According to the problem, the new share per person is $8 more than the original share. Therefore, we can write the equation:
\[
\frac{C}{6} = x + 8
\]

Substitute the expression for \( x \) from the first equation into the second equation:
\[
\frac{C}{6} = \frac{C}{10} + 8
\]

To eliminate the fractions, find a common denominator, which is 30, and rewrite the equation:
\[
\frac{5C}{30} = \frac{3C}{30} + 8
\]

Multiply every term by 30 to clear the fractions:
\[
5C = 3C + 240
\]

Subtract \( 3C \) from both sides to solve for \( C \):
\[
2C = 240
\]

Divide both sides by 2:
\[
C = 120
\]

Thus, the total cost of the gift is \(\boxed{120}\) dollars.
