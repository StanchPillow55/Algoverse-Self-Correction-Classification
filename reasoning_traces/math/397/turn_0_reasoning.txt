==================================================

To solve this problem, let's define the variables and work through the steps systematically.

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( C \) be the total cost of the gift in dollars.
   - Let \( x \) be the original share each of the ten friends would pay if they all contributed equally.

2. **Original Situation:**
   - If all ten friends contribute, each would pay \(\frac{C}{10}\).
   - Therefore, \( x = \frac{C}{10} \).

3. **New Situation:**
   - Four friends drop out, leaving six friends to share the cost.
   - Each of the remaining six friends now pays \(\frac{C}{6}\).

4. **Relationship Between the Two Situations:**
   - We are told that the new share is $8 more than the original share:
     \[
     \frac{C}{6} = \frac{C}{10} + 8
     \]

5. **Solve the Equation:**
   - Start by eliminating the fractions by finding a common denominator, which is 30 in this case:
     \[
     5C = 3C + 240
     \]
   - Simplify and solve for \( C \):
     \[
     5C - 3C = 240
     \]
     \[
     2C = 240
     \]
     \[
     C = 120
     \]

6. **Verification:**
   - If \( C = 120 \), originally each friend would pay:
     \[
     \frac{120}{10} = 12
     \]
   - With six friends, each pays:
     \[
     \frac{120}{6} = 20
     \]
   - The difference between the new share and the original share is:
     \[
     20 - 12 = 8
     \]
   - This matches the condition given in the problem, confirming our solution is correct.

**Final Answer:**
The gift costs $120.
