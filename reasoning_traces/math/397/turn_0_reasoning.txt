==================================================

To determine how many days Mark needs to save his money to buy a bike that costs $300, we can follow these steps:

1. **Identify Mark's current savings**: Mark currently has $50 in his bank account.

2. **Determine the cost of the bike**: The bike costs $300.

3. **Calculate the amount of money Mark still needs**: 
   \[
   \text{Amount needed} = \text{Cost of the bike} - \text{Current savings}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Amount needed} = 300 - 50 = 250
   \]
   So, Mark needs an additional $250 to buy the bike.

4. **Identify Mark's daily earnings**: Mark earns $10 per day.

5. **Calculate the number of days needed to save the additional amount**:
   To find out how many days it will take for Mark to save the additional $250, we divide the amount needed by his daily earnings:
   \[
   \text{Number of days} = \frac{\text{Amount needed}}{\text{Daily earnings}}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Number of days} = \frac{250}{10} = 25
   \]

Thus, Mark needs to save for **25 days** to have enough money to buy the bike.

Final answer: Mark has to save for **25 days**.
