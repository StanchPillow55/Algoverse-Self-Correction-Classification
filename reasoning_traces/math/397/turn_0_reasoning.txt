Let the total cost of the gift be denoted as \( C \) dollars. Initially, there are 10 friends who plan to split the cost equally. Therefore, the cost per person when all 10 friends are contributing is:

\[
\text{Cost per person with 10 friends} = \frac{C}{10}
\]

When 4 friends drop out, only 6 friends remain to split the cost. The cost per person for these 6 friends is:

\[
\text{Cost per person with 6 friends} = \frac{C}{6}
\]

According to the problem, the cost per person with 6 friends is $8 more than the cost per person with 10 friends. This gives us the equation:

\[
\frac{C}{6} = \frac{C}{10} + 8
\]

To solve this equation, we first eliminate the fractions by finding a common denominator. The least common multiple of 6 and 10 is 30. We can multiply the entire equation by 30 to eliminate the denominators:

\[
30 \cdot \frac{C}{6} = 30 \cdot \left(\frac{C}{10} + 8\right)
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
5C = 3C + 240
\]

Next, we isolate \( C \) by subtracting \( 3C \) from both sides:

\[
5C - 3C = 240
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
2C = 240
\]

Now, we divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( C \):

\[
C = 120
\]

Thus, the total cost of the gift is \( \boxed{120} \) dollars.

To verify, we can check the cost per person for both scenarios:

1. With 10 friends:
   \[
   \frac{120}{10} = 12 \text{ dollars per person}
   \]

2. With 6 friends:
   \[
   \frac{120}{6} = 20 \text{ dollars per person}
   \]

The difference between the two amounts is:

\[
20 - 12 = 8 \text{ dollars}
\]

This confirms that our solution is correct. The total cost of the gift is indeed \( \boxed{120} \) dollars.
