To solve the problem effectively, I need more information about "Sample reasoning question 384." Since the question itself is not provided, I'll demonstrate how to approach a typical math problem step by step. If you have a specific problem in mind, please provide the details, and I'll be happy to solve it for you.

Let's consider a sample math problem:

**Problem:**  
A rectangle has a length that is 3 times its width. If the perimeter of the rectangle is 48 units, what are the dimensions of the rectangle?

**Step-by-step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We have a rectangle with a length (L) and a width (W).
   - The length is 3 times the width: \( L = 3W \).
   - The perimeter of the rectangle is 48 units.

2. **Recall the Formula for Perimeter:**
   - The perimeter (P) of a rectangle is given by the formula:  
     \[ P = 2L + 2W \]

3. **Substitute the Known Values:**
   - We know the perimeter is 48 units, so:  
     \[ 2L + 2W = 48 \]

4. **Substitute the Expression for L:**
   - Since \( L = 3W \), substitute this into the perimeter equation:  
     \[ 2(3W) + 2W = 48 \]

5. **Simplify the Equation:**
   - Simplify the terms:  
     \[ 6W + 2W = 48 \]
   - Combine like terms:  
     \[ 8W = 48 \]

6. **Solve for W:**
   - Divide both sides by 8 to solve for W:  
     \[ W = \frac{48}{8} = 6 \]

7. **Find L Using the Relationship Between L and W:**
   - Since \( L = 3W \), substitute W = 6 into this equation:  
     \[ L = 3 \times 6 = 18 \]

8. **Verify the Solution:**
   - Check that the perimeter is correct with these dimensions:  
     \[ 2L + 2W = 2(18) + 2(6) = 36 + 12 = 48 \]
   - The perimeter matches the given value, confirming our solution is correct.

**Final Answer:**
The dimensions of the rectangle are:
- Width (W) = 6 units
- Length (L) = 18 units
