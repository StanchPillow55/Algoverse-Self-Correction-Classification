To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 384" entails. Since the problem statement is not specific, I will assume it involves a typical math problem-solving scenario. Let's create a hypothetical math problem and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**

A company produces two types of widgets: Type A and Type B. The production cost for Type A is $5 per unit, and for Type B, it is $8 per unit. The company sells Type A for $10 per unit and Type B for $15 per unit. If the company produces 100 units of Type A and 150 units of Type B, what is the total profit?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Determine the Total Production Cost:**

   - For Type A:
     \[
     \text{Cost for Type A} = \text{Number of units of Type A} \times \text{Cost per unit of Type A}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Cost for Type A} = 100 \times 5 = 500
     \]

   - For Type B:
     \[
     \text{Cost for Type B} = \text{Number of units of Type B} \times \text{Cost per unit of Type B}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Cost for Type B} = 150 \times 8 = 1200
     \]

   - Total Production Cost:
     \[
     \text{Total Production Cost} = \text{Cost for Type A} + \text{Cost for Type B}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total Production Cost} = 500 + 1200 = 1700
     \]

2. **Determine the Total Revenue:**

   - For Type A:
     \[
     \text{Revenue for Type A} = \text{Number of units of Type A} \times \text{Selling price per unit of Type A}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Revenue for Type A} = 100 \times 10 = 1000
     \]

   - For Type B:
     \[
     \text{Revenue for Type B} = \text{Number of units of Type B} \times \text{Selling price per unit of Type B}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Revenue for Type B} = 150 \times 15 = 2250
     \]

   - Total Revenue:
     \[
     \text{Total Revenue} = \text{Revenue for Type A} + \text{Revenue for Type B}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total Revenue} = 1000 + 2250 = 3250
     \]

3. **Calculate the Total Profit:**

   - Profit is calculated as the total revenue minus the total production cost.
     \[
     \text{Total Profit} = \text{Total Revenue} - \text{Total Production Cost}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total Profit} = 3250 - 1700 = 1550
     \]

**Final Answer:**

The total profit for the company is $1550.
