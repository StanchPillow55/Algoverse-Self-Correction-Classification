==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 302" entails. Since the problem statement does not provide specific details about the question, let's assume it is a typical math problem that requires logical reasoning and step-by-step calculations.

Given the lack of specific information, let's create a hypothetical math problem and solve it. Suppose the problem is as follows:

**Problem:**
A store sells apples and oranges. The price of an apple is $0.50, and the price of an orange is $0.80. If a customer buys a total of 20 fruits consisting of apples and oranges and spends exactly $12.00, how many apples and how many oranges did the customer buy?

**Solution:**

To solve this problem, we need to set up a system of equations based on the information provided.

1. **Define the variables:**
   - Let \( a \) be the number of apples.
   - Let \( o \) be the number of oranges.

2. **Set up the equations:**
   - The total number of fruits is 20: 
     \[
     a + o = 20
     \]
   - The total cost is $12.00:
     \[
     0.50a + 0.80o = 12.00
     \]

3. **Solve the system of equations:**

   First, solve the first equation for one of the variables. Let's solve for \( a \):
   \[
   a = 20 - o
   \]

   Substitute \( a = 20 - o \) into the second equation:
   \[
   0.50(20 - o) + 0.80o = 12.00
   \]

   Simplify and solve for \( o \):
   \[
   10 - 0.50o + 0.80o = 12.00
   \]
   \[
   10 + 0.30o = 12.00
   \]
   \[
   0.30o = 2.00
   \]
   \[
   o = \frac{2.00}{0.30}
   \]
   \[
   o = \frac{200}{30} = \frac{20}{3} \approx 6.67
   \]

   Since the number of oranges must be a whole number, let's check our calculations. It seems there might be a mistake in the setup or calculation. Let's re-evaluate:

   Re-evaluate the substitution:
   \[
   0.50(20 - o) + 0.80o = 12.00
   \]
   \[
   10 - 0.50o + 0.80o = 12.00
   \]
   \[
   10 + 0.30o = 12.00
   \]
   \[
   0.30o = 2.00
   \]
   \[
   o = \frac{2.00}{0.30} = \frac{20}{3} \approx 6.67
   \]

   Let's try another approach by checking integer solutions:

   Assume \( o = 8 \):
   \[
   a = 20 - 8 = 12
   \]

   Check the cost:
   \[
   0.50 \times 12 + 0.80 \times 8 = 6.00 + 6.40 = 12.40
   \]

   Assume \( o = 10 \):
   \[
   a = 20 - 10 = 10
   \]

   Check the cost:
   \[
   0.50 \times 10 + 0.80 \times 10 = 5.00 + 8.00 = 13.00
   \]

   Assume \( o = 5 \):
   \[
   a = 20 - 5 = 15
   \]

   Check the cost:
   \[
   0.50 \times 15 + 0.80 \times 5 = 7.50 + 4.00 = 11.50
   \]

   Assume \( o = 4 \):
   \[
   a = 20 - 4 = 16
   \]

   Check the cost:
   \[
   0.50 \times 16 + 0.80 \times 4 = 8.00 + 3.20 = 11.20
   \]

   Assume \( o = 6 \):
   \[
   a = 20 - 6 = 14
   \]

   Check the cost:
   \[
   0.50 \times 14 + 0.80 \times 6 = 7.00 + 4.80 = 11.80
   \]

   Assume \( o = 7 \):
   \[
   a = 20 - 7 = 13
   \]

   Check the cost:
   \[
   0.50 \times 13 + 0.80 \times 7 = 6.50 + 5.60 = 12.10
   \]

   Assume \( o = 9 \):
   \[
   a = 20 - 9 = 11
   \]

   Check the cost:
   \[
   0.50 \times 11 + 0.80 \times 9 = 5.50 + 7.20 = 12.70
   \]

   Assume \( o = 3 \):
   \[
   a = 20 - 3 = 17
   \]

   Check the cost:
   \[
   0.50 \times 17 + 0.80 \times 3 = 8.50 + 2.40 = 10.90
   \]

   Assume \( o = 2 \):
   \[
   a = 20 - 2 = 18
   \]

   Check the cost:
   \[
   0.50 \times 18 + 0.80 \times 2 = 9.00 + 1.60 = 10.60
   \]

   Assume \( o = 1 \):
   \[
   a = 20 - 1 = 19
   \]

   Check the cost:
   \[
   0.50 \times 19 + 0.80 \times 1 = 9.50 + 0.80 = 10.30
   \]

   Assume \( o = 0 \):
   \[
   a = 20 - 0 = 20
   \]

   Check the cost:
   \[
   0.50 \times 20 + 0.80 \times 0 = 10.00 + 0.00 = 10.00
   \]

   After checking various combinations, it seems there is an error in the problem setup or assumptions. Let's re-evaluate the problem constraints or consider a different approach.

**Final Answer:**
The problem as initially assumed does not yield a valid integer solution under the given constraints. Please provide additional information or clarify the problem statement for further analysis.
