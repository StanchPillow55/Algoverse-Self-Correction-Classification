Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve a math problem, I need the specific details or numbers involved in the problem. Since "Sample reasoning question 302" doesn't provide any specific mathematical details or context, I'll need more information to proceed.

However, I can guide you through a generic approach to solving a math problem:

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - Read the problem carefully.
   - Identify what is being asked.
   - Determine what information is given and what needs to be found.

2. **Devise a Plan:**
   - Consider possible strategies to solve the problem, such as drawing a diagram, creating an equation, or breaking the problem into smaller parts.

3. **Carry Out the Plan:**
   - Execute the chosen strategy step by step.
   - Perform calculations carefully, showing all work.
   - Keep track of units and ensure consistency.

4. **Review/Check Your Work:**
   - Verify each step and calculation.
   - Check if the solution makes sense in the context of the problem.
   - Ensure that the final answer addresses the question asked.

5. **State the Final Answer:**
   - Clearly write down the final answer, including units if applicable.

If you provide a specific math problem, I can apply this approach to solve it and show all the work and reasoning involved.
