Certainly! However, it seems like the question "Sample reasoning question 302" is not specific enough for me to provide a detailed solution. It appears to be a placeholder or reference to a specific problem that isn't fully described here.

To help you effectively, I would need more details or the actual math problem you are referring to. If you can provide the specific math problem or question, I will be more than happy to work through it step by step, showing all calculations and reasoning, and provide a final answer.

Please provide the details of the math problem you need help with!
