==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to determine the arrival times of each train and how long Paul will wait for the fourth train. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **First Train:**
   - Scheduled to arrive in 10 minutes.
   - Stays for 20 minutes.
   - **Departure time of the first train:** 
     \[
     10 \text{ minutes (arrival)} + 20 \text{ minutes (stay)} = 30 \text{ minutes}
     \]

2. **Second Train:**
   - Scheduled to arrive half an hour (30 minutes) after the first train leaves.
   - **Arrival time of the second train:**
     \[
     30 \text{ minutes (departure of first train)} + 30 \text{ minutes} = 60 \text{ minutes}
     \]
   - The second train stays for a quarter of the time the first train stayed (20 minutes).
   - **Stay duration of the second train:**
     \[
     \frac{20 \text{ minutes}}{4} = 5 \text{ minutes}
     \]
   - **Departure time of the second train:**
     \[
     60 \text{ minutes (arrival)} + 5 \text{ minutes (stay)} = 65 \text{ minutes}
     \]

3. **Third Train:**
   - Scheduled to arrive an hour (60 minutes) after the second train leaves.
   - **Arrival time of the third train:**
     \[
     65 \text{ minutes (departure of second train)} + 60 \text{ minutes} = 125 \text{ minutes}
     \]
   - The third train leaves immediately after it arrives, so it departs at 125 minutes.

4. **Fourth Train:**
   - Scheduled to arrive 20 minutes after the third train leaves.
   - **Arrival time of the fourth train:**
     \[
     125 \text{ minutes (departure of third train)} + 20 \text{ minutes} = 145 \text{ minutes}
     \]

5. **Calculating Paul's Wait Time:**
   - Paul arrives at the station at the same time as the first train, which is at 10 minutes.
   - He will wait until the fourth train arrives at 145 minutes.
   - **Total wait time:**
     \[
     145 \text{ minutes (arrival of fourth train)} - 10 \text{ minutes (arrival at station)} = 135 \text{ minutes}
     \]

Thus, the total time Paul will wait for his train is **135 minutes**.

**Final Answer: 135 minutes**
