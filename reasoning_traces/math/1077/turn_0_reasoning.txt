To determine how long Paul will wait for his train, we need to calculate the arrival and departure times of each train leading up to the fourth train. Let's break this down step by step.

1. **First Train:**
   - Scheduled to arrive in 10 minutes.
   - Stays for 20 minutes.
   - Departure time of the first train: 
     \[
     10 \text{ minutes (arrival)} + 20 \text{ minutes (stay)} = 30 \text{ minutes}
     \]

2. **Second Train:**
   - Scheduled to arrive half an hour (30 minutes) after the first train leaves.
   - Arrival time of the second train:
     \[
     30 \text{ minutes (departure of first train)} + 30 \text{ minutes} = 60 \text{ minutes}
     \]
   - The second train stays for a quarter of the amount of time that the first train stayed:
     \[
     \frac{20 \text{ minutes}}{4} = 5 \text{ minutes}
     \]
   - Departure time of the second train:
     \[
     60 \text{ minutes (arrival)} + 5 \text{ minutes (stay)} = 65 \text{ minutes}
     \]

3. **Third Train:**
   - Scheduled to arrive an hour (60 minutes) after the second train leaves.
   - Arrival time of the third train:
     \[
     65 \text{ minutes (departure of second train)} + 60 \text{ minutes} = 125 \text{ minutes}
     \]
   - The third train leaves immediately after it arrives, so it departs at:
     \[
     125 \text{ minutes}
     \]

4. **Fourth Train:**
   - Scheduled to arrive 20 minutes after the third train leaves.
   - Arrival time of the fourth train:
     \[
     125 \text{ minutes (departure of third train)} + 20 \text{ minutes} = 145 \text{ minutes}
     \]

Now, we need to calculate how long Paul waits from the moment he arrives at the station until the fourth train arrives. Since he arrives at the station when the first train is scheduled to arrive (in 10 minutes), we can calculate the total wait time:

- Paul arrives at the station at:
  \[
  10 \text{ minutes}
  \]
- The fourth train arrives at:
  \[
  145 \text{ minutes}
  \]
- Therefore, the total wait time for Paul is:
  \[
  145 \text{ minutes} - 10 \text{ minutes} = 135 \text{ minutes}
  \]

Thus, the final answer is that Paul will wait for **135 minutes** for his train.
