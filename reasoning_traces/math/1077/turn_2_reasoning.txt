==================================================

To determine how long Paul will wait for his train, we need to calculate the arrival and departure times of each train leading up to the fourth train. Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **First Train:**
   - Scheduled to arrive in **10 minutes**.
   - Stays for **20 minutes**.
   - Departure time of the first train: 
     \[
     10 \text{ minutes (arrival)} + 20 \text{ minutes (stay)} = 30 \text{ minutes}
     \]

2. **Second Train:**
   - Scheduled to arrive **half an hour (30 minutes)** after the first train leaves.
   - Arrival time of the second train:
     \[
     30 \text{ minutes (departure of first train)} + 30 \text{ minutes} = 60 \text{ minutes}
     \]
   - The second train stays for a quarter of the time the first train stayed:
     \[
     \frac{20 \text{ minutes}}{4} = 5 \text{ minutes}
     \]
   - Departure time of the second train:
     \[
     60 \text{ minutes (arrival)} + 5 \text{ minutes (stay)} = 65 \text{ minutes}
     \]

3. **Third Train:**
   - Scheduled to arrive **an hour (60 minutes)** after the second train leaves.
   - Arrival time of the third train:
     \[
     65 \text{ minutes (departure of second train)} + 60 \text{ minutes} = 125 \text{ minutes}
     \]
   - The third train leaves immediately after it arrives, so it departs at:
     \[
     125 \text{ minutes}
     \]

4. **Fourth Train:**
   - Scheduled to arrive **20 minutes** after the third train leaves.
   - Arrival time of the fourth train:
     \[
     125 \text{ minutes (departure of third train)} + 20 \text{ minutes} = 145 \text{ minutes}
     \]

5. **Calculating Total Wait Time:**
   - Paul arrives at the station when the first train arrives, which is at **10 minutes**.
   - He waits until the fourth train arrives at **145 minutes**.
   - Total wait time:
     \[
     145 \text{ minutes (arrival of fourth train)} - 10 \text{ minutes (arrival at station)} = 135 \text{ minutes}
     \]

Thus, the total time Paul will wait for his train is **135 minutes**.

**Final Answer: 135 minutes**
