To find the height of Caroline's fourth child, we will calculate the heights of each child step by step, starting from the first child.

1. **Height of the first child**:
   - The first child is 6 feet tall.
   - To convert feet to inches, we use the conversion factor that 1 foot = 12 inches.
   - Therefore, the height of the first child in inches is:
     \[
     6 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 72 \text{ inches}
     \]

2. **Height of the second child**:
   - The second child is two inches taller than the first child.
   - So, we add 2 inches to the height of the first child:
     \[
     72 \text{ inches} + 2 \text{ inches} = 74 \text{ inches}
     \]

3. **Height of the third child**:
   - The third child is 5 inches shorter than the second child.
   - We subtract 5 inches from the height of the second child:
     \[
     74 \text{ inches} - 5 \text{ inches} = 69 \text{ inches}
     \]

4. **Height of the fourth child**:
   - The fourth child is three inches taller than the third child.
   - We add 3 inches to the height of the third child:
     \[
     69 \text{ inches} + 3 \text{ inches} = 72 \text{ inches}
     \]

Now that we have calculated the height of the fourth child, we can state the final answer:

The height of the fourth child is \( \boxed{72} \) inches.
