Question ID: superglue_313
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 313" entails. However, since the question is not explicitly provided, I'll demonstrate a general approach to solving a typical math problem by using a hypothetical example.

Let's assume "Sample reasoning question 313" is a math problem involving algebraic expressions. Here's a step-by-step approach to solving a hypothetical algebra problem:

**Hypothetical Problem:**
Solve for \( x \) in the equation: \( 3x + 5 = 20 \).

**Step 1: Understand the Problem**
The goal is to find the value of \( x \) that makes the equation true.

**Step 2: Isolate the Variable**
To solve for \( x \), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We start by eliminating the constant term on the left side.

- Subtract 5 from both sides of the equation:
  \[
  3x + 5 - 5 = 20 - 5
  \]
  Simplifying both sides gives:
  \[
  3x = 15
  \]

**Step 3: Solve for the Variable**
Now, divide both sides by 3 to solve for \( x \).

- Divide both sides by 3:
  \[
  \frac{3x}{3} = \frac{15}{3}
  \]
  Simplifying gives:
  \[
  x = 5
  \]

**Step 4: Verify the Solution**
Substitute \( x = 5 \) back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies the equation.

- Original equation: \( 3x + 5 = 20 \)
- Substitute \( x = 5 \):
  \[
  3(5) + 5 = 15 + 5 = 20
  \]
  Since both sides of the equation are equal, \( x = 5 \) is indeed the correct solution.

**Final Answer:**
The solution to the equation \( 3x + 5 = 20 \) is \( x = 5 \).

This step-by-step approach can be applied to various types of algebraic problems. If "Sample reasoning question 313" refers to a different type of problem, please provide additional details or context for a more specific solution.
