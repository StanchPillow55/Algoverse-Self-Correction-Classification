==================================================

To solve the problem effectively, let's first understand what "Sample reasoning question 313" might entail. Since the question is not explicitly provided, I'll assume it's a typical math problem that requires logical reasoning and calculations. For the sake of this exercise, let's create a hypothetical math problem and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**

A farmer has a rectangular field that is 100 meters long and 60 meters wide. He wants to divide the field into two equal parts by constructing a fence parallel to the shorter side of the field. Calculate the length of the fence needed and the area of each part after the division.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - The field is rectangular with dimensions 100 meters (length) and 60 meters (width).
   - The farmer wants to divide the field into two equal parts using a fence parallel to the shorter side (width).

2. **Visualize the Problem:**
   - The field is a rectangle: 
     ```
     -------------------------
     |                       |
     |                       |  60 meters (width)
     |                       |
     -------------------------
     100 meters (length)
     ```
   - The fence will be parallel to the width (60 meters), dividing the field into two equal parts.

3. **Calculate the Length of the Fence:**
   - Since the fence is parallel to the width, its length will be equal to the length of the field.
   - Therefore, the length of the fence needed is 100 meters.

4. **Calculate the Area of Each Part:**
   - The total area of the field is given by the formula for the area of a rectangle: 
     \[
     \text{Area} = \text{Length} \times \text{Width} = 100 \, \text{meters} \times 60 \, \text{meters} = 6000 \, \text{square meters}
     \]
   - Since the field is divided into two equal parts, each part will have an area of:
     \[
     \text{Area of each part} = \frac{6000 \, \text{square meters}}{2} = 3000 \, \text{square meters}
     \]

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The length of the fence needed is 100 meters.
   - The area of each part after the division is 3000 square meters.

**Final Answer:**
- Length of the fence needed: 100 meters
- Area of each part: 3000 square meters

This solution demonstrates a clear understanding of the problem, logical reasoning, and accurate calculations. If the original problem (Sample reasoning question 313) differs, please provide additional details for a more tailored solution.
