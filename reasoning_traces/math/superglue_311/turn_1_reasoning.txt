Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, I need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 311" refers to. Since the problem statement doesn't provide specific details about the question, I'll need to make some assumptions to demonstrate a step-by-step reasoning process.

Let's assume "Sample reasoning question 311" is a math problem involving basic arithmetic operations. I'll create a hypothetical problem and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**
Calculate the value of the expression: \( (3 + 5) \times 2 - 4^2 \).

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Expression:**
   The expression given is \( (3 + 5) \times 2 - 4^2 \). This involves addition, multiplication, and exponentiation.

2. **Order of Operations:**
   According to the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS), we need to solve expressions in the following order:
   - Parentheses/Brackets
   - Exponents/Orders
   - Multiplication and Division (from left to right)
   - Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)

3. **Solve Inside Parentheses:**
   First, solve the expression inside the parentheses:
   \[
   3 + 5 = 8
   \]
   Now the expression becomes \( 8 \times 2 - 4^2 \).

4. **Calculate Exponents:**
   Next, calculate the exponent:
   \[
   4^2 = 16
   \]
   Now the expression is \( 8 \times 2 - 16 \).

5. **Perform Multiplication:**
   Perform the multiplication:
   \[
   8 \times 2 = 16
   \]
   Now the expression is \( 16 - 16 \).

6. **Perform Subtraction:**
   Finally, perform the subtraction:
   \[
   16 - 16 = 0
   \]

**Final Answer:**
The value of the expression \( (3 + 5) \times 2 - 4^2 \) is \( 0 \).

This step-by-step reasoning demonstrates how to approach and solve a mathematical expression using the order of operations. If "Sample reasoning question 311" refers to a different problem, please provide additional details for a more accurate solution.
