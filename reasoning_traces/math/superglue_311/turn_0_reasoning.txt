==================================================

To solve the problem, I need more specific information about "Sample reasoning question 311." Since the question is not provided in detail, I will demonstrate how to approach a generic math problem step by step. 

Let's assume a sample math problem:

**Problem:**
A car travels from City A to City B at a speed of 60 miles per hour and returns from City B to City A at a speed of 40 miles per hour. If the total travel time is 5 hours, what is the distance between City A and City B?

**Solution:**

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( d \) be the distance between City A and City B.
   - The speed from City A to City B is 60 mph.
   - The speed from City B to City A is 40 mph.
   - Total travel time is 5 hours.

2. **Set Up Equations:**
   - Time taken to travel from City A to City B: \( \frac{d}{60} \) hours.
   - Time taken to travel from City B to City A: \( \frac{d}{40} \) hours.
   - Total time for the round trip is given as 5 hours.

3. **Equation for Total Time:**
   \[
   \frac{d}{60} + \frac{d}{40} = 5
   \]

4. **Find a Common Denominator:**
   - The common denominator for 60 and 40 is 120.

5. **Rewrite the Equation:**
   \[
   \frac{d}{60} = \frac{2d}{120}, \quad \frac{d}{40} = \frac{3d}{120}
   \]
   \[
   \frac{2d}{120} + \frac{3d}{120} = 5
   \]

6. **Combine the Fractions:**
   \[
   \frac{2d + 3d}{120} = 5
   \]
   \[
   \frac{5d}{120} = 5
   \]

7. **Solve for \( d \):**
   \[
   5d = 5 \times 120
   \]
   \[
   5d = 600
   \]
   \[
   d = \frac{600}{5}
   \]
   \[
   d = 120
   \]

8. **Conclusion:**
   The distance between City A and City B is 120 miles.

**Final Answer:**
The distance between City A and City B is 120 miles.
