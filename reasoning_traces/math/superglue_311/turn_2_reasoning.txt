==================================================

To solve the problem effectively, I need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 311" entails. However, since the problem statement is not provided, I will demonstrate a general approach to solving a reasoning-based math problem by considering a hypothetical example.

Let's assume the problem is as follows:

**Problem:**
A farmer has a rectangular field that is 100 meters long and 60 meters wide. He wants to divide the field into smaller rectangular plots, each with an area of 150 square meters. How many such plots can the farmer create?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We have a rectangular field with dimensions 100 meters by 60 meters.
   - We need to divide this field into smaller plots, each with an area of 150 square meters.

2. **Calculate the Total Area of the Field:**
   - The area of a rectangle is given by the formula: 
     \[
     \text{Area} = \text{Length} \times \text{Width}
     \]
   - For the field:
     \[
     \text{Area of the field} = 100 \, \text{meters} \times 60 \, \text{meters} = 6000 \, \text{square meters}
     \]

3. **Determine the Number of Plots:**
   - Each plot has an area of 150 square meters.
   - To find the number of plots, divide the total area of the field by the area of one plot:
     \[
     \text{Number of plots} = \frac{\text{Total area of the field}}{\text{Area of one plot}} = \frac{6000 \, \text{square meters}}{150 \, \text{square meters}}
     \]

4. **Perform the Division:**
   - Simplify the division:
     \[
     \frac{6000}{150} = 40
     \]

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The farmer can create 40 plots, each with an area of 150 square meters, from the field.

**Final Answer:**
The farmer can create 40 plots.

This example illustrates a structured approach to solving a math problem by breaking it down into clear steps, performing calculations, and arriving at a logical conclusion. If you have a specific problem in mind, please provide the details, and I can work through that problem in a similar manner.
