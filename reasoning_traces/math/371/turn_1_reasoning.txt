Question ID: 371
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine how many more grilling sessions Ronald needs to complete in order to cook a total of 115 hamburgers, given that he has already cooked 40 hamburgers.

**Step 1: Determine the number of hamburgers remaining to be cooked.**

Ronald needs to cook a total of 115 hamburgers. He has already cooked 40 hamburgers. Therefore, the number of hamburgers remaining to be cooked is:

\[ 115 - 40 = 75 \]

So, Ronald still needs to cook 75 hamburgers.

**Step 2: Calculate the number of additional grilling sessions needed.**

Ronald can grill 15 hamburgers per session. To find out how many more sessions he needs, we divide the remaining hamburgers by the number of hamburgers he can cook per session:

\[ \frac{75}{15} = 5 \]

This calculation shows that Ronald needs 5 more grilling sessions to cook the remaining 75 hamburgers.

**Conclusion:**

Ronald will need 5 more sessions to finish cooking all 115 hamburgers.

**Final Answer:**

5 sessions
