To solve the problem, we will break it down day by day and calculate the total number of tennis shoes sold, taking into account the returns.

1. **Sales on Friday**: 
   - The store sold 14 pairs of tennis shoes.

2. **Sales on Saturday**: 
   - The next day (Saturday), they sold double the number of shoes sold on Friday.
   - Calculation: 
     \[
     \text{Sales on Saturday} = 2 \times \text{Sales on Friday} = 2 \times 14 = 28 \text{ pairs}
     \]

3. **Sales on Sunday**: 
   - On the last day of the sale (Sunday), they sold one-half the amount that they did the day before (Saturday).
   - Calculation:
     \[
     \text{Sales on Sunday} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Sales on Saturday} = \frac{1}{2} \times 28 = 14 \text{ pairs}
     \]

4. **Returns**: 
   - On Sunday, six people returned their pairs because they didn't fit. We need to subtract these returns from the total sales.
   - Calculation of returns:
     \[
     \text{Returns} = 6 \text{ pairs}
     \]

5. **Total Sales Calculation**: 
   - Now we will calculate the total number of shoes sold over the three days and then subtract the returns.
   - Total sales before returns:
     \[
     \text{Total Sales} = \text{Sales on Friday} + \text{Sales on Saturday} + \text{Sales on Sunday}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total Sales} = 14 + 28 + 14 = 56 \text{ pairs}
     \]
   - Now, subtract the returns:
     \[
     \text{Total Sold after Returns} = \text{Total Sales} - \text{Returns} = 56 - 6 = 50 \text{ pairs}
     \]

6. **Final Answer**: 
   - The total number of tennis shoes sold by the end of the sale, after accounting for returns, is:
   \[
   \boxed{50}
   \]
