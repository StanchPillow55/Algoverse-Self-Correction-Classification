==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine how many more grilling sessions Ronald needs to complete in order to cook a total of 115 hamburgers, given that he has already cooked 40 hamburgers and can grill 15 hamburgers per session.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Determine the Remaining Hamburgers to Cook:**
   - Ronald needs to cook a total of 115 hamburgers.
   - He has already cooked 40 hamburgers.
   - Therefore, the number of hamburgers he still needs to cook is:
     \[
     115 - 40 = 75
     \]
   Ronald needs to cook 75 more hamburgers.

2. **Calculate the Number of Sessions Needed:**
   - Ronald can grill 15 hamburgers per session.
   - To find out how many sessions are needed to cook 75 hamburgers, we divide the remaining hamburgers by the number of hamburgers he can cook per session:
     \[
     \frac{75}{15} = 5
     \]
   This calculation shows that Ronald needs 5 more sessions to cook the remaining 75 hamburgers.

3. **Verify the Calculation:**
   - If Ronald grills 15 hamburgers per session for 5 sessions, he will cook:
     \[
     15 \times 5 = 75
     \]
   This confirms that 5 sessions are indeed sufficient to cook the remaining 75 hamburgers.

Therefore, the final answer is that Ronald will need 5 more grilling sessions to finish cooking all 115 hamburgers.

**Final Answer: 5 sessions**
