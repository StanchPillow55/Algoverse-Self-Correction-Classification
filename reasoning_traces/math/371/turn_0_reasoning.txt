Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To determine how many more sessions Ronald needs to finish cooking all 115 hamburgers, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the remaining hamburgers to be cooked**:
   Ronald has already cooked 40 hamburgers. Therefore, we need to find out how many hamburgers are left to cook.

   \[
   \text{Remaining hamburgers} = \text{Total hamburgers} - \text{Hamburgers already cooked}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Remaining hamburgers} = 115 - 40 = 75
   \]

2. **Determine how many hamburgers Ronald can cook in one session**:
   According to the problem, Ronald can grill 15 hamburgers per session.

3. **Calculate the number of sessions needed to cook the remaining hamburgers**:
   To find out how many sessions Ronald needs to cook the remaining 75 hamburgers, we divide the number of remaining hamburgers by the number of hamburgers he can cook in one session.

   \[
   \text{Number of sessions} = \frac{\text{Remaining hamburgers}}{\text{Hamburgers per session}}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Number of sessions} = \frac{75}{15} = 5
   \]

4. **Conclusion**:
   Ronald will need 5 more sessions to finish cooking all 115 hamburgers.

Thus, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{5}
\]
