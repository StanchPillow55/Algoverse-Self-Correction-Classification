Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem effectively, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 312" refers to. Unfortunately, without additional context or specific details about the problem, it's impossible to provide a precise solution. However, I can guide you through a general approach to solving reasoning problems, which often involve logical thinking, pattern recognition, or mathematical calculations.

### General Approach to Solving Reasoning Problems

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - Carefully read the problem statement.
   - Identify what is being asked.
   - Determine what information is provided and what is missing.

2. **Break Down the Problem:**
   - Divide the problem into smaller, manageable parts.
   - Look for patterns or relationships between different elements of the problem.

3. **Develop a Strategy:**
   - Choose an appropriate method to tackle the problem (e.g., algebraic manipulation, drawing diagrams, logical deduction).
   - Consider different approaches if the first one doesn't seem to work.

4. **Execute the Plan:**
   - Carry out the necessary calculations or logical steps.
   - Keep track of your work to ensure accuracy.

5. **Review and Verify:**
   - Double-check your calculations and reasoning.
   - Ensure that your solution answers the question posed.

6. **State the Final Answer:**
   - Clearly present your final answer, ensuring it is in the correct format and addresses the problem.

### Example Problem and Solution

Since "Sample reasoning question 312" is not specified, let's consider a hypothetical example:

**Example Problem:**
A sequence is defined as follows: The first term is 2, and each subsequent term is 3 more than twice the previous term. What is the fifth term in this sequence?

**Solution:**

1. **Identify the Sequence Rule:**
   - First term (\(a_1\)) = 2.
   - Each subsequent term (\(a_n\)) is given by: \(a_{n} = 2 \times a_{n-1} + 3\).

2. **Calculate the Terms:**
   - \(a_1 = 2\)
   - \(a_2 = 2 \times a_1 + 3 = 2 \times 2 + 3 = 4 + 3 = 7\)
   - \(a_3 = 2 \times a_2 + 3 = 2 \times 7 + 3 = 14 + 3 = 17\)
   - \(a_4 = 2 \times a_3 + 3 = 2 \times 17 + 3 = 34 + 3 = 37\)
   - \(a_5 = 2 \times a_4 + 3 = 2 \times 37 + 3 = 74 + 3 = 77\)

3. **Final Answer:**
   - The fifth term in the sequence is 77.

This example illustrates the process of understanding a problem, breaking it down, applying a strategy, and arriving at a solution. If you have a specific problem or more details about "Sample reasoning question 312," please provide them, and I can offer a more targeted solution.
