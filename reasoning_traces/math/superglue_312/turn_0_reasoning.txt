==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 312" refers to. Since this is not a standard math problem or a common reference, I'll assume it's a placeholder for a generic math problem. Let's create a sample math problem and solve it step by step.

**Sample Problem:**

A company produces two types of products, A and B. The profit from each unit of product A is $5, and the profit from each unit of product B is $8. The company can produce a maximum of 100 units of product A and 80 units of product B per day. However, due to resource constraints, the total production of products A and B combined cannot exceed 150 units per day. How many units of each product should the company produce to maximize profit?

**Solution:**

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( x \) be the number of units of product A produced per day.
   - Let \( y \) be the number of units of product B produced per day.

2. **Objective Function:**
   - We want to maximize the profit function \( P \), where:
     \[
     P = 5x + 8y
     \]

3. **Constraints:**
   - The production constraints are:
     1. \( x \leq 100 \) (cannot produce more than 100 units of A)
     2. \( y \leq 80 \) (cannot produce more than 80 units of B)
     3. \( x + y \leq 150 \) (total production cannot exceed 150 units)

4. **Graphical Solution:**
   - Plot the constraints on a graph with \( x \) on the horizontal axis and \( y \) on the vertical axis.
   - The feasible region is bounded by the lines:
     - \( x = 100 \)
     - \( y = 80 \)
     - \( x + y = 150 \)

5. **Identify Corner Points:**
   - The feasible region is a polygon, and the maximum profit will occur at one of the vertices (corner points) of this polygon.
   - Calculate the intersection points (vertices) of the constraints:
     1. Intersection of \( x = 100 \) and \( x + y = 150 \): \( (100, 50) \)
     2. Intersection of \( y = 80 \) and \( x + y = 150 \): \( (70, 80) \)
     3. Intersection of \( x = 100 \) and \( y = 80 \): \( (100, 80) \)
     4. Intersection of \( x = 0 \) and \( y = 0 \): \( (0, 0) \) (not relevant as it doesn't satisfy all constraints)

6. **Evaluate the Objective Function at Each Vertex:**
   - \( P(100, 50) = 5(100) + 8(50) = 500 + 400 = 900 \)
   - \( P(70, 80) = 5(70) + 8(80) = 350 + 640 = 990 \)
   - \( P(100, 80) = 5(100) + 8(80) = 500 + 640 = 1140 \)

7. **Determine the Maximum Profit:**
   - The maximum profit is \( 1140 \), which occurs at the point \( (100, 80) \).

**Final Answer:**
The company should produce 100 units of product A and 80 units of product B to maximize profit, resulting in a maximum profit of $1140 per day.
