==================================================

To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step, using the information provided about the heights of Carl, Ned, and Isabel.

1. **Determine Isabel's height**: 
   We know from the problem that Isabel is 7 feet tall.

   \[
   \text{Isabel's height} = 7 \text{ feet}
   \]

2. **Calculate Ned's height**: 
   The problem states that Ned is two feet shorter than Isabel. Therefore, we can find Ned's height by subtracting 2 feet from Isabel's height.

   \[
   \text{Ned's height} = \text{Isabel's height} - 2 \text{ feet} = 7 \text{ feet} - 2 \text{ feet} = 5 \text{ feet}
   \]

3. **Calculate Carl's height**: 
   The problem states that Carl is one foot taller than Ned. Thus, we can find Carl's height by adding 1 foot to Ned's height.

   \[
   \text{Carl's height} = \text{Ned's height} + 1 \text{ foot} = 5 \text{ feet} + 1 \text{ foot} = 6 \text{ feet}
   \]

4. **Determine the length of Carl's cane**: 
   The problem states that Carl's cane is half as long as he is tall. Therefore, we can find the length of the cane by dividing Carl's height by 2.

   \[
   \text{Length of Carl's cane} = \frac{\text{Carl's height}}{2} = \frac{6 \text{ feet}}{2} = 3 \text{ feet}
   \]

5. **Final answer**: 
   The length of Carl's cane is 

   \[
   \boxed{3} \text{ feet}
   \]
