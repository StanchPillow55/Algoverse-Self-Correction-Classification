==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine how many weasels and rabbits are caught by the foxes over a period of 3 weeks and then subtract these numbers from the initial populations.

**Step 1: Determine the total number of weasels caught by the foxes.**

- Each fox catches an average of 4 weasels per week.
- There are 3 foxes.

The number of weasels caught by one fox in one week is 4. Therefore, the total number of weasels caught by all 3 foxes in one week is:
\[ 3 \text{ foxes} \times 4 \text{ weasels/fox/week} = 12 \text{ weasels/week} \]

Over 3 weeks, the total number of weasels caught is:
\[ 12 \text{ weasels/week} \times 3 \text{ weeks} = 36 \text{ weasels} \]

**Step 2: Determine the total number of rabbits caught by the foxes.**

- Each fox catches an average of 2 rabbits per week.
- There are 3 foxes.

The number of rabbits caught by one fox in one week is 2. Therefore, the total number of rabbits caught by all 3 foxes in one week is:
\[ 3 \text{ foxes} \times 2 \text{ rabbits/fox/week} = 6 \text{ rabbits/week} \]

Over 3 weeks, the total number of rabbits caught is:
\[ 6 \text{ rabbits/week} \times 3 \text{ weeks} = 18 \text{ rabbits} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the remaining number of weasels and rabbits.**

- Initial number of weasels: 100
- Weasels caught: 36

Remaining weasels:
\[ 100 \text{ weasels} - 36 \text{ weasels} = 64 \text{ weasels} \]

- Initial number of rabbits: 50
- Rabbits caught: 18

Remaining rabbits:
\[ 50 \text{ rabbits} - 18 \text{ rabbits} = 32 \text{ rabbits} \]

**Final Answer:**

After 3 weeks, there will be 64 weasels and 32 rabbits left in the section of the forest.
