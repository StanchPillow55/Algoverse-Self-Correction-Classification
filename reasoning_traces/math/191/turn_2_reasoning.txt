==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to determine how many weasels and rabbits are left after three weeks of hunting by the foxes.

### Step 1: Determine the total number of animals hunted by the foxes in one week.

Each fox catches:
- 4 weasels
- 2 rabbits

Since there are 3 foxes, we can calculate the total number of weasels and rabbits caught per week as follows:

**Total weasels caught per week:**
\[
\text{Total weasels caught} = \text{Number of foxes} \times \text{Weasels caught per fox}
\]
\[
\text{Total weasels caught} = 3 \times 4 = 12 \text{ weasels}
\]

**Total rabbits caught per week:**
\[
\text{Total rabbits caught} = \text{Number of foxes} \times \text{Rabbits caught per fox}
\]
\[
\text{Total rabbits caught} = 3 \times 2 = 6 \text{ rabbits}
\]

### Step 2: Determine the total number of animals hunted over 3 weeks.

Now, we calculate the total number of weasels and rabbits caught over 3 weeks.

**Total weasels caught in 3 weeks:**
\[
\text{Total weasels caught in 3 weeks} = \text{Total weasels caught per week} \times 3
\]
\[
\text{Total weasels caught in 3 weeks} = 12 \times 3 = 36 \text{ weasels}
\]

**Total rabbits caught in 3 weeks:**
\[
\text{Total rabbits caught in 3 weeks} = \text{Total rabbits caught per week} \times 3
\]
\[
\text{Total rabbits caught in 3 weeks} = 6 \times 3 = 18 \text{ rabbits}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the remaining number of weasels and rabbits.

Now, we subtract the total number of weasels and rabbits caught from the initial populations.

**Initial number of weasels:**
\[
\text{Initial weasels} = 100
\]
**Remaining weasels after 3 weeks:**
\[
\text{Remaining weasels} = \text{Initial weasels} - \text{Total weasels caught in 3 weeks}
\]
\[
\text{Remaining weasels} = 100 - 36 = 64 \text{ weasels}
\]

**Initial number of rabbits:**
\[
\text{Initial rabbits} = 50
\]
**Remaining rabbits after 3 weeks:**
\[
\text{Remaining rabbits} = \text{Initial rabbits} - \text{Total rabbits caught in 3 weeks}
\]
\[
\text{Remaining rabbits} = 50 - 18 = 32 \text{ rabbits}
\]

### Final Answer

After 3 weeks of hunting by the foxes, the number of weasels left is 64 and the number of rabbits left is 32.

Thus, the final answer is:
- **Weasels left:** 64
- **Rabbits left:** 32
