Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we will first determine how many weasels and rabbits are caught by the foxes over the course of 3 weeks. We will then subtract these amounts from the initial populations of weasels and rabbits to find out how many are left.

### Step 1: Determine the total number of weasels and rabbits caught by one fox in one week.

- Each fox catches:
  - 4 weasels
  - 2 rabbits

### Step 2: Calculate the total number of weasels and rabbits caught by all three foxes in one week.

- For 3 foxes:
  - Total weasels caught in one week = 3 foxes × 4 weasels/fox = 12 weasels
  - Total rabbits caught in one week = 3 foxes × 2 rabbits/fox = 6 rabbits

### Step 3: Calculate the total number of weasels and rabbits caught by all three foxes in 3 weeks.

- For 3 weeks:
  - Total weasels caught in 3 weeks = 12 weasels/week × 3 weeks = 36 weasels
  - Total rabbits caught in 3 weeks = 6 rabbits/week × 3 weeks = 18 rabbits

### Step 4: Calculate the remaining number of weasels and rabbits after 3 weeks.

- Initial populations:
  - Weasels: 100
  - Rabbits: 50

- Remaining weasels after 3 weeks:
  \[
  \text{Remaining weasels} = \text{Initial weasels} - \text{Weasels caught}
  \]
  \[
  \text{Remaining weasels} = 100 - 36 = 64
  \]

- Remaining rabbits after 3 weeks:
  \[
  \text{Remaining rabbits} = \text{Initial rabbits} - \text{Rabbits caught}
  \]
  \[
  \text{Remaining rabbits} = 50 - 18 = 32
  \]

### Final Answer

After 3 weeks, the number of weasels left is **64** and the number of rabbits left is **32**. 

Thus, the final answer is:
- Weasels left: 64
- Rabbits left: 32
