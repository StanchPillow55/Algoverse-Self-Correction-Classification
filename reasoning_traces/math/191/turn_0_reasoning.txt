==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to calculate how many weasels and rabbits are caught by the foxes over a period of 3 weeks and then subtract these numbers from the initial populations.

### Step-by-step Calculation:

1. **Initial Populations:**
   - Weasels: 100
   - Rabbits: 50

2. **Foxes' Hunting Rate:**
   - Each fox catches an average of 4 weasels and 2 rabbits per week.

3. **Total Foxes:**
   - There are 3 foxes.

4. **Calculate Total Weasels Caught:**
   - Each fox catches 4 weasels per week.
   - Total weasels caught by all foxes per week = 3 foxes * 4 weasels/fox = 12 weasels.
   - Over 3 weeks, total weasels caught = 12 weasels/week * 3 weeks = 36 weasels.

5. **Calculate Total Rabbits Caught:**
   - Each fox catches 2 rabbits per week.
   - Total rabbits caught by all foxes per week = 3 foxes * 2 rabbits/fox = 6 rabbits.
   - Over 3 weeks, total rabbits caught = 6 rabbits/week * 3 weeks = 18 rabbits.

6. **Calculate Remaining Weasels:**
   - Initial weasels = 100
   - Weasels caught = 36
   - Remaining weasels = 100 - 36 = 64 weasels.

7. **Calculate Remaining Rabbits:**
   - Initial rabbits = 50
   - Rabbits caught = 18
   - Remaining rabbits = 50 - 18 = 32 rabbits.

### Final Answer:
After 3 weeks, there will be 64 weasels and 32 rabbits left in the section of the forest.
