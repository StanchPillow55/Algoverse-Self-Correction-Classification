==================================================

To determine how many pounds of insects a flock of ten ducks needs per day, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total weekly food requirement for the flock of ducks**:
   Each duck needs 3.5 pounds of insects per week. Therefore, for 10 ducks, we multiply the weekly requirement per duck by the number of ducks:

   \[
   \text{Total weekly requirement} = \text{Number of ducks} \times \text{Weekly requirement per duck}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total weekly requirement} = 10 \text{ ducks} \times 3.5 \text{ pounds/duck} = 35 \text{ pounds}
   \]

2. **Convert the weekly requirement to a daily requirement**:
   Since there are 7 days in a week, we need to divide the total weekly requirement by 7 to find out how much the ducks need per day:

   \[
   \text{Daily requirement} = \frac{\text{Total weekly requirement}}{7}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Daily requirement} = \frac{35 \text{ pounds}}{7} = 5 \text{ pounds}
   \]

Thus, the flock of ten ducks needs **5 pounds of insects per day**.

Final answer: **5 pounds**.
