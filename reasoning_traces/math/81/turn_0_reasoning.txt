To solve the problem, we will analyze each round of the skipping competition step by step, using the information provided about Sam's and Jeff's skips.

1. **Understanding Sam's Skips**:
   - It is given that Sam skipped 16 times in each round.

2. **Calculating Jeff's Skips in Each Round**:
   - **Round 1**: Sam completed 1 more skip than Jeff.
     - Let \( J_1 \) be the number of skips Jeff made in the first round.
     - Since Sam skipped 16 times, we have:
       \[
       16 = J_1 + 1 \implies J_1 = 16 - 1 = 15
       \]

   - **Round 2**: Jeff skipped 3 fewer times than Sam.
     - Let \( J_2 \) be the number of skips Jeff made in the second round.
     - Since Sam skipped 16 times, we have:
       \[
       J_2 = 16 - 3 = 13
       \]

   - **Round 3**: Jeff skipped 4 more times than Sam.
     - Let \( J_3 \) be the number of skips Jeff made in the third round.
     - Since Sam skipped 16 times, we have:
       \[
       J_3 = 16 + 4 = 20
       \]

   - **Round 4**: Jeff completed half the number of skips as Sam.
     - Let \( J_4 \) be the number of skips Jeff made in the fourth round.
     - Since Sam skipped 16 times, we have:
       \[
       J_4 = \frac{16}{2} = 8
       \]

3. **Summarizing Jeff's Skips**:
   - Now we have the number of skips Jeff made in each round:
     - Round 1: \( J_1 = 15 \)
     - Round 2: \( J_2 = 13 \)
     - Round 3: \( J_3 = 20 \)
     - Round 4: \( J_4 = 8 \)

4. **Calculating the Total Skips by Jeff**:
   - We can find the total number of skips Jeff made across all rounds:
     \[
     \text{Total skips by Jeff} = J_1 + J_2 + J_3 + J_4 = 15 + 13 + 20 + 8
     \]
   - Performing the addition:
     \[
     15 + 13 = 28
     \]
     \[
     28 + 20 = 48
     \]
     \[
     48 + 8 = 56
     \]
   - Therefore, Jeff skipped a total of 56 times.

5. **Calculating the Average Number of Skips per Round**:
   - To find the average number of skips per round completed by Jeff, we divide the total skips by the number of rounds (which is 4):
     \[
     \text{Average skips by Jeff} = \frac{\text{Total skips by Jeff}}{\text{Number of rounds}} = \frac{56}{4} = 14
     \]

6. **Final Answer**:
   - The average number of skips per round completed by Jeff is \( \boxed{14} \).
