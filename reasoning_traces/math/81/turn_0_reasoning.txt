Dataset Type: math
==================================================

In the first round, Sam completed 1 more skip than Jeff. So, Jeff completed 16 - 1 = 15 skips.

In the second round, Jeff skipped 3 fewer times than Sam. So, Jeff completed 16 - 3 = 13 skips.

In the third round, Jeff skipped 4 more times than Sam. So, Jeff completed 16 + 4 = 20 skips.

In the last round, Jeff completed half the number of skips as Sam. So, Jeff completed 16 / 2 = 8 skips.

To find the average number of skips per round completed by Jeff, we first need to find the total number of skips Jeff completed. We do this by adding up the number of skips he completed in each round: 15 + 13 + 20 + 8 = 56 skips.

The average is then found by dividing the total number of skips by the number of rounds. There were 4 rounds, so the average number of skips per round completed by Jeff is 56 / 4 = 14 skips.

So, Jeff completed an average of 14 skips per round.
