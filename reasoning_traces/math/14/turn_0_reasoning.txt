Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To determine how long it will take Joy to read 120 pages, we can start by finding her reading rate in pages per minute.

1. **Calculate Joy's reading rate:**
   Joy reads 8 pages in 20 minutes. To find her reading rate in pages per minute, we divide the number of pages by the number of minutes:

   \[
   \text{Reading rate} = \frac{8 \text{ pages}}{20 \text{ minutes}} = 0.4 \text{ pages per minute}
   \]

2. **Determine the time to read 120 pages:**
   Next, we need to find out how long it will take her to read 120 pages at her reading rate of 0.4 pages per minute. We can use the formula:

   \[
   \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Total pages}}{\text{Reading rate}}
   \]

   Substituting the values we have:

   \[
   \text{Time} = \frac{120 \text{ pages}}{0.4 \text{ pages per minute}} = 300 \text{ minutes}
   \]

3. **Convert minutes to hours:**
   Since the question asks for the time in hours, we need to convert minutes to hours. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so we divide the total minutes by 60:

   \[
   \text{Time in hours} = \frac{300 \text{ minutes}}{60 \text{ minutes per hour}} = 5 \text{ hours}
   \]

Thus, it will take Joy **5 hours** to read 120 pages.

Final answer: **5 hours**.
