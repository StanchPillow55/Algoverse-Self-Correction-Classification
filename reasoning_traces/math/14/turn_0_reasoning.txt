==================================================

To solve the problem, we will follow these steps:

1. **Determine the number of students enrolled in contemporary dance.**
2. **Calculate the number of remaining students after accounting for those in contemporary dance.**
3. **Determine the number of students enrolled in jazz dance from the remaining students.**
4. **Calculate the number of students enrolled in hip-hop dance.**
5. **Find the percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance relative to the total number of students.**

### Step 1: Calculate the number of students in contemporary dance

The total number of students in the dance class is 20. According to the problem, 20% of these students enrolled in contemporary dance.

\[
\text{Number of students in contemporary dance} = 20\% \times 20 = \frac{20}{100} \times 20 = 4
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the number of remaining students

After accounting for the students in contemporary dance, we find the number of remaining students:

\[
\text{Remaining students} = \text{Total students} - \text{Students in contemporary dance} = 20 - 4 = 16
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the number of students in jazz dance

Next, we know that 25% of the remaining students enrolled in jazz dance. We will calculate this number:

\[
\text{Number of students in jazz dance} = 25\% \times 16 = \frac{25}{100} \times 16 = 4
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the number of students in hip-hop dance

Now, we can find the number of students who enrolled in hip-hop dance. This is the remainder of the students after accounting for those in contemporary and jazz dance:

\[
\text{Students in hip-hop dance} = \text{Remaining students} - \text{Students in jazz dance} = 16 - 4 = 12
\]

### Step 5: Calculate the percentage of students in hip-hop dance

Finally, we need to find the percentage of the total students that are enrolled in hip-hop dance:

\[
\text{Percentage of students in hip-hop dance} = \left( \frac{\text{Students in hip-hop dance}}{\text{Total students}} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{12}{20} \right) \times 100 = 60\%
\]

### Final Answer

The percentage of the entire students enrolled in hip-hop dance is **60%**.
