==================================================

First, we need to establish Joy's reading rate. We know that she can read 8 pages in 20 minutes. Therefore, her reading rate is 8 pages/20 minutes = 0.4 pages/minute.

Next, we need to figure out how long it will take her to read 120 pages at this rate. We can set up the equation:

0.4 pages/minute * x minutes = 120 pages

Solving for x gives us:

x = 120 pages / 0.4 pages/minute = 300 minutes

However, the problem asks for the answer in hours, not minutes. We know that there are 60 minutes in an hour, so we can convert 300 minutes to hours by dividing by 60:

300 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 5 hours

So, it will take Joy 5 hours to read 120 pages.
