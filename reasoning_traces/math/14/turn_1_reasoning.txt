Question ID: 14
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we will follow these steps:

1. **Determine the number of students enrolled in contemporary dance.**
2. **Calculate the number of students remaining after accounting for those in contemporary dance.**
3. **Determine the number of students enrolled in jazz dance from the remaining students.**
4. **Calculate the number of students enrolled in hip-hop dance.**
5. **Find the percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance relative to the total number of students.**

### Step 1: Calculate the number of students in contemporary dance

The total number of students in the dance class is 20. According to the problem, 20% of these students enrolled in contemporary dance.

\[
\text{Number of students in contemporary dance} = 20\% \times 20 = \frac{20}{100} \times 20 = 4
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the remaining students after contemporary dance

Now, we subtract the number of students in contemporary dance from the total number of students:

\[
\text{Remaining students} = 20 - 4 = 16
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the number of students in jazz dance

Next, we find out how many of the remaining students enrolled in jazz dance. The problem states that 25% of the remaining students enrolled in jazz dance.

\[
\text{Number of students in jazz dance} = 25\% \times 16 = \frac{25}{100} \times 16 = 4
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the number of students in hip-hop dance

Now, we need to find out how many students are left who enrolled in hip-hop dance. We subtract the number of students in contemporary and jazz dance from the total number of students:

\[
\text{Number of students in hip-hop dance} = \text{Total students} - (\text{Students in contemporary} + \text{Students in jazz})
\]

\[
\text{Number of students in hip-hop dance} = 20 - (4 + 4) = 20 - 8 = 12
\]

### Step 5: Calculate the percentage of students in hip-hop dance

Finally, we need to find the percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance relative to the total number of students:

\[
\text{Percentage of students in hip-hop dance} = \left(\frac{\text{Number of students in hip-hop}}{\text{Total students}}\right) \times 100
\]

\[
\text{Percentage of students in hip-hop dance} = \left(\frac{12}{20}\right) \times 100 = 0.6 \times 100 = 60\%
\]

### Final Answer

The percentage of the entire students enrolled in hip-hop dance is **60%**.
