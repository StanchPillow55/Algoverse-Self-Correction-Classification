Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine how long it will take Joy to read 120 pages, given that she can read 8 pages in 20 minutes. We'll break this down step by step.

### Step 1: Determine Joy's reading rate

First, we find out how many pages Joy can read per minute. She reads 8 pages in 20 minutes, so her reading rate is:

\[
\text{Reading rate} = \frac{8 \text{ pages}}{20 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{2}{5} \text{ pages per minute}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the time to read 120 pages

Next, we need to find out how many minutes it will take her to read 120 pages. We use her reading rate to set up the equation:

\[
\text{Time (in minutes)} = \frac{\text{Total pages}}{\text{Pages per minute}} = \frac{120 \text{ pages}}{\frac{2}{5} \text{ pages per minute}}
\]

To divide by a fraction, we multiply by its reciprocal:

\[
\text{Time (in minutes)} = 120 \times \frac{5}{2} = 120 \times 2.5 = 300 \text{ minutes}
\]

### Step 3: Convert minutes to hours

Finally, we convert the time from minutes to hours. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so:

\[
\text{Time (in hours)} = \frac{300 \text{ minutes}}{60 \text{ minutes per hour}} = 5 \text{ hours}
\]

### Conclusion

Joy will take 5 hours to read 120 pages. 

Therefore, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{5 \text{ hours}}
\]
