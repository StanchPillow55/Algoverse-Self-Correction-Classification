Question ID: 14
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to determine how many minutes it takes Joy to read one page. We do this by dividing the total minutes (20) by the number of pages she reads in that time (8). 

20 minutes / 8 pages = 2.5 minutes per page

Next, we need to find out how many minutes it will take her to read 120 pages. We do this by multiplying the number of pages (120) by the time it takes to read one page (2.5 minutes).

120 pages * 2.5 minutes per page = 300 minutes

Finally, we need to convert minutes to hours since the problem asks for the answer in hours. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so we divide the total minutes (300) by 60.

300 minutes / 60 = 5 hours

Therefore, it will take Joy 5 hours to read 120 pages.
