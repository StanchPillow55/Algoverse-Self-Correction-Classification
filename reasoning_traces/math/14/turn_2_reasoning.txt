Question ID: 14
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to find out how many minutes it takes Joy to read one page. We know that she can read 8 pages in 20 minutes, so we divide 20 minutes by 8 pages to find the time per page.

20 minutes รท 8 pages = 2.5 minutes per page

Next, we need to find out how many minutes it will take her to read 120 pages. We multiply the number of pages by the time per page.

120 pages ร 2.5 minutes per page = 300 minutes

Finally, we need to convert minutes to hours, since the problem asks for the answer in hours. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so we divide the total minutes by 60.

300 minutes รท 60 = 5 hours

Therefore, it will take Joy 5 hours to read 120 pages.
