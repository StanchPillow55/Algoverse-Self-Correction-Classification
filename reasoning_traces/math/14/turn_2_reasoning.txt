Question ID: 14
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the number of students enrolled in contemporary dance:**
   - The total number of students in the dance class is 20.
   - 20% of these students enrolled in contemporary dance.
   - To find 20% of 20, we calculate:
     \[
     \text{Number of students in contemporary dance} = 20 \times 0.20 = 4
     \]

2. **Calculate the number of remaining students after contemporary dance:**
   - After accounting for the students in contemporary dance, the number of remaining students is:
     \[
     \text{Remaining students} = 20 - 4 = 16
     \]

3. **Determine the number of students enrolled in jazz dance:**
   - 25% of the remaining students enrolled in jazz dance.
   - To find 25% of 16, we calculate:
     \[
     \text{Number of students in jazz dance} = 16 \times 0.25 = 4
     \]

4. **Calculate the number of students remaining after jazz dance:**
   - After accounting for the students in jazz dance, the number of remaining students is:
     \[
     \text{Remaining students} = 16 - 4 = 12
     \]

5. **Determine the number of students enrolled in hip-hop dance:**
   - The remaining students, who did not enroll in contemporary or jazz dance, are enrolled in hip-hop dance. Therefore, the number of students in hip-hop dance is:
     \[
     \text{Number of students in hip-hop dance} = 12
     \]

6. **Calculate the percentage of the entire class that enrolled in hip-hop dance:**
   - To find the percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance, we use the formula:
     \[
     \text{Percentage of students in hip-hop dance} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of students in hip-hop dance}}{\text{Total number of students}} \right) \times 100
     \]
   - Substituting the values we have:
     \[
     \text{Percentage of students in hip-hop dance} = \left( \frac{12}{20} \right) \times 100 = 60\%
     \]

**Final Answer:**
The percentage of the entire students enrolled in hip-hop dance is **60%**.
