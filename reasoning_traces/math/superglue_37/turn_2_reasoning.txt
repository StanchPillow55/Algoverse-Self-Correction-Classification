==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 37" refers to. Since the problem statement is not explicitly provided, I will assume this is a placeholder for a typical math problem. Let's create a sample math problem and solve it step by step.

**Sample Problem:**

A train travels from City A to City B, a distance of 300 miles, at a constant speed. On the return trip, the train travels at a speed that is 20 miles per hour faster and takes 1 hour less than the trip from City A to City B. What is the speed of the train from City A to City B?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( v \) be the speed of the train from City A to City B in miles per hour.
   - The time taken to travel from City A to City B is \( \frac{300}{v} \) hours.

2. **Return Trip:**
   - The speed on the return trip is \( v + 20 \) miles per hour.
   - The time taken for the return trip is \( \frac{300}{v + 20} \) hours.

3. **Set Up the Equation:**
   - According to the problem, the return trip takes 1 hour less than the trip from City A to City B. Therefore, we can write the equation:
   \[
   \frac{300}{v} - \frac{300}{v + 20} = 1
   \]

4. **Solve the Equation:**
   - To solve the equation, first find a common denominator:
   \[
   \frac{300(v + 20) - 300v}{v(v + 20)} = 1
   \]
   - Simplify the numerator:
   \[
   300v + 6000 - 300v = 6000
   \]
   - The equation becomes:
   \[
   \frac{6000}{v(v + 20)} = 1
   \]
   - Cross-multiply to eliminate the fraction:
   \[
   6000 = v(v + 20)
   \]
   - Expand and rearrange the equation:
   \[
   v^2 + 20v - 6000 = 0
   \]

5. **Solve the Quadratic Equation:**
   - Use the quadratic formula, \( v = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \), where \( a = 1 \), \( b = 20 \), and \( c = -6000 \).
   - Calculate the discriminant:
   \[
   b^2 - 4ac = 20^2 - 4 \times 1 \times (-6000) = 400 + 24000 = 24400
   \]
   - Calculate the square root of the discriminant:
   \[
   \sqrt{24400} = 156.2 \quad (\text{approximate})
   \]
   - Solve for \( v \):
   \[
   v = \frac{-20 \pm 156.2}{2}
   \]
   - Calculate the two possible solutions:
   \[
   v = \frac{-20 + 156.2}{2} = 68.1
   \]
   \[
   v = \frac{-20 - 156.2}{2} = -88.1 \quad (\text{not feasible as speed cannot be negative})
   \]

6. **Conclusion:**
   - The speed of the train from City A to City B is approximately 68.1 miles per hour.

**Final Answer:**
The speed of the train from City A to City B is approximately 68.1 miles per hour.
