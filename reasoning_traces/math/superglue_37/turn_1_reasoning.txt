==================================================

To solve the problem, we first need to understand what "Sample reasoning question 37" refers to. However, since the problem statement is not provided, I'll demonstrate a general approach to solving reasoning-based math problems. Let's assume a hypothetical problem and solve it step-by-step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**

A farmer has a certain number of apples. If he divides them equally among 5 baskets, he will have 3 apples left over. If he divides them among 7 baskets, he will have 2 apples left over. What is the smallest number of apples the farmer could have?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We need to find the smallest number of apples, \( x \), such that:
     - \( x \equiv 3 \pmod{5} \) (i.e., when divided by 5, the remainder is 3)
     - \( x \equiv 2 \pmod{7} \) (i.e., when divided by 7, the remainder is 2)

2. **Set Up the Congruences:**
   - We have two congruences:
     1. \( x \equiv 3 \pmod{5} \)
     2. \( x \equiv 2 \pmod{7} \)

3. **Use the Chinese Remainder Theorem:**
   - Since 5 and 7 are coprime, we can use the Chinese Remainder Theorem to find a solution.
   - The solution will be of the form \( x = 5k + 3 \) for some integer \( k \).

4. **Substitute into the Second Congruence:**
   - Substitute \( x = 5k + 3 \) into the second congruence:
     \[
     5k + 3 \equiv 2 \pmod{7}
     \]
   - Simplify:
     \[
     5k \equiv -1 \equiv 6 \pmod{7}
     \]

5. **Solve for \( k \):**
   - We need to find the multiplicative inverse of 5 modulo 7.
   - By trial, we find that \( 5 \times 3 \equiv 15 \equiv 1 \pmod{7} \).
   - Thus, the inverse of 5 modulo 7 is 3.
   - Multiply both sides of the congruence by 3:
     \[
     k \equiv 6 \times 3 \equiv 18 \equiv 4 \pmod{7}
     \]

6. **Find \( x \):**
   - Substitute \( k = 7m + 4 \) into \( x = 5k + 3 \):
     \[
     x = 5(7m + 4) + 3 = 35m + 20 + 3 = 35m + 23
     \]
   - The smallest positive \( x \) occurs when \( m = 0 \):
     \[
     x = 23
     \]

7. **Verify the Solution:**
   - Check \( x = 23 \) against the original conditions:
     - \( 23 \div 5 = 4 \) remainder \( 3 \) (satisfies \( x \equiv 3 \pmod{5} \))
     - \( 23 \div 7 = 3 \) remainder \( 2 \) (satisfies \( x \equiv 2 \pmod{7} \))

**Final Answer:**

The smallest number of apples the farmer could have is 23.
