==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to calculate the total amount of money Carrie spent on lunch using the denominations of money she received.

1. **Identify the denominations and quantities**:
   - Carrie has **ten twenties**. Each twenty-dollar bill is worth $20.
   - Carrie also has **140 quarters**. Each quarter is worth $0.25.

2. **Calculate the total amount from the twenties**:
   - Since Carrie has ten twenty-dollar bills, the total amount from the twenties is:
     \[
     10 \times 20 = 200 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total amount from the quarters**:
   - Since Carrie has 140 quarters, the total amount from the quarters is:
     \[
     140 \times 0.25 = 35 \text{ dollars}
     \]

4. **Calculate the total amount of money Carrie has**:
   - The total amount of money Carrie has from both twenties and quarters is:
     \[
     200 + 35 = 235 \text{ dollars}
     \]

5. **Determine how much she spent**:
   - Carrie spent all the quarters, which we calculated as $35.
   - She also spent \( \frac{3}{5} \) of the twenties. To find out how much that is, we first calculate \( \frac{3}{5} \) of the total amount from the twenties:
     \[
     \frac{3}{5} \times 200 = \frac{600}{5} = 120 \text{ dollars}
     \]

6. **Calculate the total amount spent on lunch**:
   - The total amount spent by Carrie is the sum of the amount spent from the quarters and the amount spent from the twenties:
     \[
     35 + 120 = 155 \text{ dollars}
     \]

7. **Final answer**:
   - Therefore, the total amount of money Carrie paid for lunch is:
     \[
     \boxed{155} \text{ dollars}
     \]
