To solve the problem, we need to calculate the total cost of the cookies that Carl buys and then determine how much change he receives after paying with a $10 bill.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of cookies.**
Carl buys 10 packs of cookies, and each pack contains 6 cookies. Therefore, the total number of cookies can be calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Total cookies} = \text{Number of packs} \times \text{Cookies per pack}
\]
\[
\text{Total cookies} = 10 \times 6 = 60 \text{ cookies}
\]

**Step 2: Calculate the total cost of the cookies.**
Each cookie costs $0.10. To find the total cost of all the cookies, we multiply the total number of cookies by the cost per cookie:

\[
\text{Total cost} = \text{Total cookies} \times \text{Cost per cookie}
\]
\[
\text{Total cost} = 60 \times 0.10 = 6.00 \text{ dollars}
\]

**Step 3: Calculate the change Carl receives.**
Carl pays with a $10 bill. To find out how much change he receives, we subtract the total cost from the amount he paid:

\[
\text{Change} = \text{Amount paid} - \text{Total cost}
\]
\[
\text{Change} = 10.00 - 6.00 = 4.00 \text{ dollars}
\]

**Final Answer:**
Carl receives $4.00 in change.
