To find the cost of the discounted subscription, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the amount of the discount**: 
   The discount is given as 45% of the normal subscription price. The normal price of the subscription is $80.

   To calculate the discount amount, we use the formula:
   \[
   \text{Discount Amount} = \text{Normal Price} \times \text{Discount Rate}
   \]
   Here, the discount rate is 45%, which can be expressed as a decimal:
   \[
   45\% = \frac{45}{100} = 0.45
   \]

   Now, we can calculate the discount amount:
   \[
   \text{Discount Amount} = 80 \times 0.45
   \]
   \[
   \text{Discount Amount} = 36
   \]

2. **Calculate the discounted price**:
   To find the final price after applying the discount, we subtract the discount amount from the normal price:
   \[
   \text{Discounted Price} = \text{Normal Price} - \text{Discount Amount}
   \]
   Substituting the values we have:
   \[
   \text{Discounted Price} = 80 - 36
   \]
   \[
   \text{Discounted Price} = 44
   \]

3. **Final answer**:
   The cost of the discounted subscription is \(\$44\).

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{44}
\]
