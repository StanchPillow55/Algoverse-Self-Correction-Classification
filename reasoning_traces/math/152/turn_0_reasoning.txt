To solve this problem, we need to determine the cost of a one-year subscription to a newspaper after applying a 45% discount to the original price of $80.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Understand the Original Price:**
   - The original price of the subscription is $80.

2. **Determine the Discount Amount:**
   - The discount offered is 45% of the original price.
   - To find the discount amount, we calculate 45% of $80.

   \[
   \text{Discount Amount} = 0.45 \times 80
   \]

3. **Calculate the Discount Amount:**
   - Perform the multiplication:

   \[
   \text{Discount Amount} = 0.45 \times 80 = 36
   \]

   - So, the discount amount is $36.

4. **Calculate the Discounted Price:**
   - Subtract the discount amount from the original price to find the discounted price.

   \[
   \text{Discounted Price} = \text{Original Price} - \text{Discount Amount}
   \]

   \[
   \text{Discounted Price} = 80 - 36 = 44
   \]

5. **Final Answer:**
   - The cost of the subscription after the 45% discount is applied is $44.

Therefore, the discounted subscription cost is \(\boxed{44}\) dollars.
