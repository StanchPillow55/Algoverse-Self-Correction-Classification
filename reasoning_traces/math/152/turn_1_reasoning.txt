==================================================

To solve the problem of determining the discounted cost of a newspaper subscription, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - The normal cost of a one-year subscription is $80.
   - A discount of 45% is offered on this subscription.

2. **Calculate the Discount Amount:**
   - The discount is 45% of the normal price.
   - To find the discount amount, we calculate 45% of $80.

3. **Convert the Percentage to a Decimal:**
   - Percentages are converted to decimals by dividing by 100. Thus, 45% becomes 0.45.

4. **Calculate the Discount Amount:**
   - Multiply the normal price by the decimal form of the percentage to find the discount amount:
   \[
   \text{Discount Amount} = 80 \times 0.45 = 36
   \]
   - This means the discount amount is $36.

5. **Calculate the Discounted Price:**
   - Subtract the discount amount from the normal price to find the discounted subscription cost:
   \[
   \text{Discounted Price} = 80 - 36 = 44
   \]

6. **Conclusion:**
   - The discounted subscription cost is $44.

Therefore, the final answer is that the discounted subscription costs $44.
