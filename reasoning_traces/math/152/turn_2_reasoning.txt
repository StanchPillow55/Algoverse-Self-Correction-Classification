==================================================

To solve the problem of finding the discounted cost of a one-year newspaper subscription, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Identify the Original Cost**:  
   The original cost of the subscription is given as $80.

2. **Determine the Discount Rate**:  
   The discount offered is 45%.

3. **Calculate the Discount Amount**:  
   To find the discount amount, multiply the original cost by the discount rate (expressed as a decimal).  
   \[
   \text{Discount Amount} = \text{Original Cost} \times \text{Discount Rate}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Discount Amount} = 80 \times 0.45 = 36
   \]

4. **Calculate the Discounted Cost**:  
   Subtract the discount amount from the original cost to find the discounted cost.  
   \[
   \text{Discounted Cost} = \text{Original Cost} - \text{Discount Amount}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Discounted Cost} = 80 - 36 = 44
   \]

Therefore, the cost of the subscription after applying the 45% discount is $44.

**Final Answer**: The discounted subscription cost is $44.
