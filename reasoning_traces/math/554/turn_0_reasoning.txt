To solve the problem, we need to determine how long it takes Ray to swim 3 miles on both a cold day and a hot day, and then find the difference between those two times.

### Step 1: Determine Ray's swimming time in cold water.

From the problem, we know that Ray swims a mile in 16 minutes when the water is cold. Therefore, the time it takes him to swim 3 miles in cold water can be calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Time for 3 miles in cold water} = 3 \text{ miles} \times 16 \text{ minutes/mile} = 48 \text{ minutes}
\]

### Step 2: Determine Ray's swimming time in warm water.

Next, we need to find out how long it takes Ray to swim a mile in warm water. The problem states that when the water is warm, Ray swims a mile in 2 minutes more than twice as long as he does in cold water.

First, we calculate twice the time it takes him to swim a mile in cold water:

\[
2 \times 16 \text{ minutes} = 32 \text{ minutes}
\]

Now, we add 2 minutes to this time to find the time it takes him to swim a mile in warm water:

\[
\text{Time for 1 mile in warm water} = 32 \text{ minutes} + 2 \text{ minutes} = 34 \text{ minutes}
\]

Now, we can calculate the time it takes him to swim 3 miles in warm water:

\[
\text{Time for 3 miles in warm water} = 3 \text{ miles} \times 34 \text{ minutes/mile} = 102 \text{ minutes}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the difference in time.

Now we need to find out how much longer it takes Ray to swim 3 miles on a hot day (warm water) compared to a cold day:

\[
\text{Difference in time} = \text{Time in warm water} - \text{Time in cold water}
\]
\[
\text{Difference in time} = 102 \text{ minutes} - 48 \text{ minutes} = 54 \text{ minutes}
\]

### Final Answer

Ray takes **54 minutes longer** to swim 3 miles on a hot day than on a cold day.
