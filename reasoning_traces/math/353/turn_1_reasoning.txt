Question ID: 353
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to determine how much time John spent sightseeing based on the information provided.

1. **Calculate the time spent on boating and swimming:**
   - John spends 6 hours boating.
   - He spends half that time swimming, which is:
     \[
     \text{Swimming time} = \frac{6}{2} = 3 \text{ hours}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total time spent watching shows:**
   - John watched 3 different shows, each lasting 2 hours:
     \[
     \text{Total show time} = 3 \times 2 = 6 \text{ hours}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total time spent on activities:**
   - Total time spent on boating, swimming, and watching shows:
     \[
     \text{Total activity time} = \text{Boating time} + \text{Swimming time} + \text{Show time}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total activity time} = 6 + 3 + 6 = 15 \text{ hours}
     \]

4. **Determine the total time spent on vacation:**
   - We know that the time spent watching shows (6 hours) is 30% of the total time spent on vacation. Let \( T \) be the total time spent on vacation. We can set up the equation:
     \[
     0.30T = 6
     \]
   - To find \( T \), divide both sides by 0.30:
     \[
     T = \frac{6}{0.30} = 20 \text{ hours}
     \]

5. **Calculate the time spent sightseeing:**
   - John spent 40% of his total vacation time sightseeing. Therefore, we can calculate the sightseeing time as follows:
     \[
     \text{Sightseeing time} = 0.40 \times T = 0.40 \times 20 = 8 \text{ hours}
     \]

Thus, the time John spent sightseeing is \( \boxed{8} \) hours.
