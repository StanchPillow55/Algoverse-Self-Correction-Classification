==================================================

To determine how much money Sally’s Woodworking LLC will reimburse Remy, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total cost of the furniture at the correct price.**
   - We know that the cost of a piece of furniture is $134.
   - Remy purchased 150 pieces of furniture.
   - Therefore, the total correct cost can be calculated as follows:

   \[
   \text{Total correct cost} = \text{Cost per piece} \times \text{Number of pieces} = 134 \times 150
   \]

   Now, let's perform the multiplication:

   \[
   134 \times 150 = 20100
   \]

   So, the total correct cost of the furniture is $20,100.

2. **Determine the amount Remy was overcharged.**
   - Remy paid a total of $20,700.
   - To find out how much he was overcharged, we subtract the total correct cost from the amount he paid:

   \[
   \text{Overcharge} = \text{Amount paid} - \text{Total correct cost} = 20700 - 20100
   \]

   Performing the subtraction:

   \[
   20700 - 20100 = 600
   \]

   Thus, Remy was overcharged by $600.

3. **Determine the reimbursement amount.**
   - Since the overcharge amount is the amount that Sally’s Woodworking LLC needs to reimburse Remy, we conclude that:

   \[
   \text{Reimbursement amount} = 600
   \]

4. **Final answer:**
   - Therefore, Sally’s Woodworking LLC will reimburse Remy **$600**.

In summary, the calculations show that Remy was overcharged by $600, which is the amount that will be reimbursed to him. 

Final answer: **$600**.
