Question ID: 353
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To find out how much time John spent sightseeing, we first need to calculate the total time he spent on all activities.

1. **Calculate time spent on boating and swimming:**
   - John spent 6 hours boating.
   - He spent half that time swimming, which is:
     \[
     \text{Time swimming} = \frac{6}{2} = 3 \text{ hours}
     \]

2. **Calculate time spent watching shows:**
   - John watched 3 different shows, each lasting 2 hours. Therefore, the total time spent watching shows is:
     \[
     \text{Time watching shows} = 3 \times 2 = 6 \text{ hours}
     \]

3. **Calculate total time spent on activities:**
   - Now we can add up all the time spent on the activities:
     \[
     \text{Total time} = \text{Time boating} + \text{Time swimming} + \text{Time watching shows}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total time} = 6 + 3 + 6 = 15 \text{ hours}
     \]

4. **Determine the total time spent based on the percentage of time:**
   - We know that the time spent watching shows (6 hours) is 30% of the total time. Let \( T \) be the total time.
   - We can set up the equation:
     \[
     0.30T = 6
     \]
   - To find \( T \), we divide both sides by 0.30:
     \[
     T = \frac{6}{0.30} = 20 \text{ hours}
     \]

5. **Calculate time spent sightseeing:**
   - We know that John spent 40% of his total time sightseeing. Therefore, the time spent sightseeing is:
     \[
     \text{Time sightseeing} = 0.40 \times T = 0.40 \times 20 = 8 \text{ hours}
     \]

Finally, the amount of time John spent sightseeing is:
\[
\boxed{8} \text{ hours}
\]
