To solve the problem, we need to determine the total time John spent on his vacation and then calculate how much time he spent sightseeing.

1. **Calculate the time spent on boating and swimming:**
   - John spent 6 hours boating.
   - He spent half that time swimming, which is:
     \[
     \text{Swimming time} = \frac{6}{2} = 3 \text{ hours}
     \]

2. **Calculate the time spent watching shows:**
   - John watched 3 different shows, each lasting 2 hours. Therefore, the total time spent watching shows is:
     \[
     \text{Time watching shows} = 3 \times 2 = 6 \text{ hours}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total time spent on activities:**
   - Now, we add the time spent on boating, swimming, and watching shows:
     \[
     \text{Total time spent on activities} = \text{Boating} + \text{Swimming} + \text{Shows}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total time spent on activities} = 6 + 3 + 6 = 15 \text{ hours}
     \]

4. **Determine the total time spent on vacation:**
   - We know that the time spent watching shows (6 hours) represents 30% of the total time spent on vacation. Let \( T \) be the total time spent on vacation. We can set up the equation:
     \[
     0.30T = 6
     \]
   - To find \( T \), we divide both sides by 0.30:
     \[
     T = \frac{6}{0.30} = 20 \text{ hours}
     \]

5. **Calculate the time spent sightseeing:**
   - We know that John spent 40% of his total vacation time sightseeing. Therefore, the time spent sightseeing is:
     \[
     \text{Sightseeing time} = 0.40T = 0.40 \times 20 = 8 \text{ hours}
     \]

6. **Final answer:**
   - John spent **8 hours** sightseeing.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{8}
\]
