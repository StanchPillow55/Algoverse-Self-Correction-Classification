==================================================

To determine how much money Sally’s Woodworking LLC will reimburse Remy, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total cost of the furniture based on the correct price per piece.**
   - The cost of one piece of furniture is given as $134.
   - Remy purchased 150 pieces of furniture.
   - Therefore, the total correct cost can be calculated as follows:

   \[
   \text{Total correct cost} = \text{Number of pieces} \times \text{Cost per piece}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total correct cost} = 150 \times 134
   \]

   Now, we perform the multiplication:

   \[
   150 \times 134 = 150 \times (100 + 30 + 4) = 150 \times 100 + 150 \times 30 + 150 \times 4
   \]
   \[
   = 15000 + 4500 + 600 = 20400
   \]

   Thus, the total correct cost of the furniture is **$20,400**.

2. **Determine the amount Remy was overcharged.**
   - Remy paid a total of $20,700.
   - To find out how much he was overcharged, we subtract the correct total cost from the amount he paid:

   \[
   \text{Overcharged amount} = \text{Amount paid} - \text{Total correct cost}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Overcharged amount} = 20700 - 20400
   \]
   \[
   = 300
   \]

3. **Conclusion:**
   - Since Remy was overcharged by $300, this is the amount that Sally’s Woodworking LLC will reimburse him.

Thus, the final answer is:

\[
\text{Sally’s Woodworking LLC will reimburse Remy: } \boxed{300}
\]
