==================================================

To determine how much money Sally’s Woodworking LLC should reimburse Remy, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the Correct Total Cost:**
   - We know that the cost of one piece of furniture is $134.
   - Remy purchased 150 pieces of furniture.
   - To find the correct total cost, we multiply the number of pieces by the cost per piece:
     \[
     \text{Correct Total Cost} = 150 \times 134
     \]

2. **Perform the Multiplication:**
   - Let's calculate \(150 \times 134\):
     \[
     150 \times 134 = 150 \times (100 + 30 + 4)
     \]
   - Break it down using the distributive property:
     \[
     150 \times 100 = 15000
     \]
     \[
     150 \times 30 = 4500
     \]
     \[
     150 \times 4 = 600
     \]
   - Add these results together to find the total:
     \[
     15000 + 4500 + 600 = 20100
     \]

3. **Determine the Amount Overcharged:**
   - Remy was charged $20,700.
   - The correct total cost should have been $20,100.
   - The amount overcharged is the difference between what Remy paid and the correct total cost:
     \[
     \text{Amount Overcharged} = 20700 - 20100 = 600
     \]

4. **Conclusion:**
   - Sally’s Woodworking LLC should reimburse Remy $600.

Thus, the final answer is that Sally’s Woodworking LLC will reimburse Remy \(\boxed{600}\) dollars.
