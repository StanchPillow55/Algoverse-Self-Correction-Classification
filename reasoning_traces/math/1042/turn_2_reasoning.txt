Question ID: 1042
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step, calculating the amounts lost and won in each race, and then find the average loss.

1. **First Race:**
   - Johnny's dad lost $5.
   - Letâ€™s denote this loss as \( L_1 = -5 \).

2. **Second Race:**
   - He won $1 more than twice the amount he lost in the first race.
   - The amount he lost in the first race is $5, so twice that amount is \( 2 \times 5 = 10 \).
   - Therefore, the amount he won in the second race is:
     \[
     W_2 = 10 + 1 = 11
     \]

3. **Third Race:**
   - He lost 1.5 times as much as he won in the second race.
   - Since he won $11 in the second race, we calculate 1.5 times that amount:
     \[
     L_3 = 1.5 \times 11 = 16.5
     \]

4. **Calculating Total Losses and Wins:**
   - Total losses:
     \[
     \text{Total Loss} = L_1 + L_3 = -5 - 16.5 = -21.5
     \]
   - Total wins:
     \[
     \text{Total Win} = W_2 = 11
     \]

5. **Calculating Net Loss:**
   - The net loss for the day can be calculated by adding the total losses and the total wins:
     \[
     \text{Net Loss} = \text{Total Loss} + \text{Total Win} = -21.5 + 11 = -10.5
     \]

6. **Calculating Average Loss:**
   - To find the average loss, we need to consider the total number of races, which is 3 (two losses and one win).
   - The average loss is calculated as:
     \[
     \text{Average Loss} = \frac{\text{Total Loss}}{\text{Number of Races}} = \frac{-21.5}{3} \approx -7.1667
     \]

Thus, the average loss Johnny's dad incurred that day is approximately $7.17.

**Final Answer:**
The average loss that day was approximately $7.17.
