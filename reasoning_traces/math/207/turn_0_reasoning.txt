==================================================

To determine how many hours John volunteers per year, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Identify the frequency of volunteering**: John volunteers twice a month.
2. **Identify the duration of each volunteering session**: Each session lasts for 3 hours.
3. **Calculate the total number of volunteering sessions per year**: Since there are 12 months in a year, we can calculate the total number of sessions by multiplying the number of sessions per month by the number of months in a year.

   \[
   \text{Total sessions per year} = \text{Sessions per month} \times \text{Months per year}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total sessions per year} = 2 \text{ sessions/month} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 24 \text{ sessions/year}
   \]

4. **Calculate the total hours volunteered per year**: Now that we know John volunteers 24 sessions in a year and each session is 3 hours long, we can find the total hours volunteered by multiplying the number of sessions by the duration of each session.

   \[
   \text{Total hours volunteered per year} = \text{Total sessions per year} \times \text{Hours per session}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total hours volunteered per year} = 24 \text{ sessions/year} \times 3 \text{ hours/session} = 72 \text{ hours/year}
   \]

5. **Final answer**: Therefore, the total number of hours John volunteers per year is 

   \[
   \boxed{72}
   \]
