To find the total weight of Joe's bag of Halloween candy, we need to calculate the weight of the chocolate bars and the weight of the candied apples separately, and then sum these two weights.

### Step 1: Calculate the weight of the chocolate bars

We know that:
- There are 25 chocolate bars.
- Each chocolate bar weighs 40 grams.

To find the total weight of the chocolate bars, we multiply the number of chocolate bars by the weight of each chocolate bar:

\[
\text{Weight of chocolate bars} = \text{Number of chocolate bars} \times \text{Weight of each chocolate bar}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\text{Weight of chocolate bars} = 25 \times 40 \, \text{g} = 1000 \, \text{g}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the weight of the candied apples

Next, we need to find the weight of the candied apples. We know that:
- There are 80 candied apples.
- Each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as each candied apple. Since each chocolate bar weighs 40 grams, we can find the weight of each candied apple:

\[
\text{Weight of each candied apple} = \frac{\text{Weight of each chocolate bar}}{2} = \frac{40 \, \text{g}}{2} = 20 \, \text{g}
\]

Now, we can calculate the total weight of the candied apples:

\[
\text{Weight of candied apples} = \text{Number of candied apples} \times \text{Weight of each candied apple}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\text{Weight of candied apples} = 80 \times 20 \, \text{g} = 1600 \, \text{g}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the total weight of the bag of candy

Now, we can find the total weight of Joe's bag of candy by adding the weight of the chocolate bars and the weight of the candied apples:

\[
\text{Total weight} = \text{Weight of chocolate bars} + \text{Weight of candied apples}
\]

Substituting the values we calculated:

\[
\text{Total weight} = 1000 \, \text{g} + 1600 \, \text{g} = 2600 \, \text{g}
\]

### Final Answer

The total weight of Joe's bag of Halloween candy is:

\[
\boxed{2600 \, \text{g}}
\]
