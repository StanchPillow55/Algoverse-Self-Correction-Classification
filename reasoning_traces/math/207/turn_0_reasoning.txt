==================================================

To determine how many hours John volunteers per year, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the number of volunteering sessions per month:**
   John volunteers twice a month. Therefore, he has 2 volunteering sessions each month.

2. **Determine the number of hours per volunteering session:**
   Each volunteering session lasts for 3 hours.

3. **Calculate the total hours volunteered per month:**
   Since John volunteers twice a month and each session is 3 hours long, we can calculate the monthly volunteering hours as follows:
   \[
   \text{Hours per month} = 2 \text{ sessions/month} \times 3 \text{ hours/session} = 6 \text{ hours/month}
   \]

4. **Determine the number of months in a year:**
   There are 12 months in a year.

5. **Calculate the total hours volunteered per year:**
   To find the total number of hours John volunteers in a year, we multiply the monthly volunteering hours by the number of months in a year:
   \[
   \text{Total hours per year} = 6 \text{ hours/month} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 72 \text{ hours/year}
   \]

Therefore, John volunteers a total of 72 hours per year.

**Final Answer: 72 hours per year**
