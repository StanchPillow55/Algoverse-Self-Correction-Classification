To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step.

1. **Total Investment**: The total amount invested in the joint savings account is $1200.

2. **Dylan's Investment**: Dylan invests \( \frac{2}{5} \) of the total amount. We calculate Dylan's investment as follows:
   \[
   \text{Dylan's investment} = \frac{2}{5} \times 1200
   \]
   \[
   \text{Dylan's investment} = \frac{2400}{5} = 480
   \]

3. **Remaining Amount After Dylan's Investment**: After Dylan's investment, we need to find out how much money is left in the account:
   \[
   \text{Remaining amount} = 1200 - 480 = 720
   \]

4. **Frances's Investment**: Frances invests \( \frac{2}{3} \) of the remaining amount. We calculate Frances's investment as follows:
   \[
   \text{Frances's investment} = \frac{2}{3} \times 720
   \]
   \[
   \text{Frances's investment} = \frac{1440}{3} = 480
   \]

5. **Remaining Amount After Frances's Investment**: Now we find out how much money is left after Frances's investment:
   \[
   \text{Remaining amount} = 720 - 480 = 240
   \]

6. **Skyler's Investment**: Skyler's investment is the remaining amount after both Dylan's and Frances's investments:
   \[
   \text{Skyler's investment} = 240
   \]

Thus, after calculating all the investments, we find that Skyler's investment is:

\[
\boxed{240}
\]
