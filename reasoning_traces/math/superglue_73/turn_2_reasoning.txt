Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem effectively, I need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 73" entails. Since the problem statement is not explicitly provided, I'll demonstrate a general approach to solving a typical math problem by breaking it down into steps, showing all calculations, and explaining the reasoning behind each step.

### Step-by-Step Approach

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - Identify what is being asked.
   - Determine what information is given and what needs to be found.

2. **Devise a Plan:**
   - Choose an appropriate strategy to solve the problem. This could involve algebraic manipulation, drawing a diagram, or applying a specific formula.

3. **Carry Out the Plan:**
   - Execute the chosen strategy step by step.
   - Perform calculations carefully and check each step for accuracy.

4. **Review/Check the Solution:**
   - Verify that the solution makes sense in the context of the problem.
   - Check calculations and ensure that all parts of the problem have been addressed.

### Example Problem

Since I don't have the specific details of "Sample reasoning question 73," I'll create a sample problem to illustrate the process:

**Problem:** Solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).

#### Step 1: Understand the Problem
We need to find the value of \( x \) that satisfies the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).

#### Step 2: Devise a Plan
To isolate \( x \), we can use basic algebraic operations. Our goal is to get \( x \) by itself on one side of the equation.

#### Step 3: Carry Out the Plan
- Start with the equation: \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).
- Subtract 3 from both sides to isolate the term with \( x \):
  \[
  2x + 3 - 3 = 11 - 3
  \]
  \[
  2x = 8
  \]
- Divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( x \):
  \[
  \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{8}{2}
  \]
  \[
  x = 4
  \]

#### Step 4: Review/Check the Solution
- Substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies the equation:
  \[
  2(4) + 3 = 11
  \]
  \[
  8 + 3 = 11
  \]
  \[
  11 = 11
  \]
The solution checks out, confirming that \( x = 4 \) is correct.

### Final Answer
The solution to the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \) is \( x = 4 \).

This example illustrates the process of solving a basic algebraic equation. If you have a specific problem or additional details about "Sample reasoning question 73," please provide them, and I can tailor the solution to that specific problem.
