Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we first need to understand what "Sample reasoning question 73" entails. Since the problem statement doesn't provide specific details about the question, I'll demonstrate a general approach to solving a typical math problem by outlining the steps and reasoning involved.

Let's assume "Sample reasoning question 73" is a math problem involving algebraic expressions. Here's how we might approach solving it:

### Step 1: Understand the Problem
- **Identify the given information**: We need to know what variables, equations, or expressions are provided.
- **Determine what is being asked**: Are we solving for a variable, simplifying an expression, or proving an identity?

### Step 2: Develop a Plan
- **Choose a strategy**: Depending on the problem, we might use substitution, elimination, factoring, or another algebraic method.
- **Consider possible solutions**: Think about whether there might be one solution, multiple solutions, or no solution.

### Step 3: Execute the Plan
- **Perform calculations**: Carefully carry out the necessary algebraic manipulations.
- **Check each step**: Ensure that each transformation or calculation is valid.

### Step 4: Review and Conclude
- **Verify the solution**: Substitute back into the original equation to check if the solution is correct.
- **State the final answer clearly**: Make sure the answer is presented in a clear and concise manner.

### Example Problem
Let's consider a hypothetical algebra problem:

**Problem**: Solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).

#### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Understand the Problem**:
   - We have the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).
   - We need to solve for \( x \).

2. **Develop a Plan**:
   - Isolate the variable \( x \) on one side of the equation.

3. **Execute the Plan**:
   - Subtract 3 from both sides: 
     \[
     2x + 3 - 3 = 11 - 3
     \]
     \[
     2x = 8
     \]
   - Divide both sides by 2:
     \[
     \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{8}{2}
     \]
     \[
     x = 4
     \]

4. **Review and Conclude**:
   - Substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation to verify:
     \[
     2(4) + 3 = 8 + 3 = 11
     \]
   - The left side equals the right side, confirming our solution is correct.

**Final Answer**: \( x = 4 \).

Since the original problem statement "Sample reasoning question 73" was not specific, this example demonstrates a typical approach to solving an algebraic equation. If you have a specific problem in mind, please provide more details, and I can tailor the solution accordingly.
