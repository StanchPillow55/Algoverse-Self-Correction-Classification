Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem effectively, I need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 146" entails. Since the problem is not explicitly stated, I'll assume a generic approach to solving a reasoning-based math problem. Let's consider a hypothetical math reasoning problem and work through it step by step.

### Hypothetical Problem:
**Problem:** A train travels from Station A to Station B at a speed of 60 km/h. On its return trip from Station B to Station A, it travels at a speed of 90 km/h. If the total travel time for the round trip is 5 hours, what is the distance between Station A and Station B?

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( d \) be the distance between Station A and Station B in kilometers.
   - The speed from A to B is 60 km/h.
   - The speed from B to A is 90 km/h.
   - The total travel time for the round trip is 5 hours.

2. **Set Up Equations:**
   - The time taken to travel from A to B is given by \( \frac{d}{60} \) hours.
   - The time taken to travel from B to A is given by \( \frac{d}{90} \) hours.
   - The total travel time for the round trip is the sum of these two times:
     \[
     \frac{d}{60} + \frac{d}{90} = 5
     \]

3. **Find a Common Denominator:**
   - The common denominator for 60 and 90 is 180.
   - Convert the fractions:
     \[
     \frac{d}{60} = \frac{3d}{180}
     \]
     \[
     \frac{d}{90} = \frac{2d}{180}
     \]

4. **Combine the Fractions:**
   \[
   \frac{3d}{180} + \frac{2d}{180} = \frac{5d}{180}
   \]

5. **Set the Equation Equal to 5:**
   \[
   \frac{5d}{180} = 5
   \]

6. **Solve for \( d \):**
   - Multiply both sides by 180 to clear the fraction:
     \[
     5d = 5 \times 180
     \]
   - Simplify:
     \[
     5d = 900
     \]
   - Divide both sides by 5:
     \[
     d = \frac{900}{5} = 180
     \]

### Final Answer:
The distance between Station A and Station B is 180 kilometers.

This solution demonstrates a clear, step-by-step approach to solving a reasoning-based math problem involving rates, distances, and times. If "Sample reasoning question 146" refers to a specific problem, please provide the details, and I can tailor the solution accordingly.
