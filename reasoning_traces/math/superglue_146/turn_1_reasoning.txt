Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we first need to understand what "Sample reasoning question 146" refers to. Since the problem statement does not provide specific details about the question, we will need to make some assumptions or create a hypothetical problem to demonstrate the process of solving a math problem.

Let's assume "Sample reasoning question 146" is a typical math problem involving algebra. Here's a hypothetical problem we can solve:

**Problem:** Solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).

**Step-by-step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Equation:**
   The equation given is \( 2x + 3 = 11 \). Our goal is to solve for \( x \).

2. **Isolate the Variable:**
   To solve for \( x \), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We start by eliminating the constant term on the left side of the equation.

   \[
   2x + 3 = 11
   \]

   Subtract 3 from both sides to get:

   \[
   2x + 3 - 3 = 11 - 3
   \]

   Simplifying both sides gives:

   \[
   2x = 8
   \]

3. **Solve for \( x \):**
   Now, we need to solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides by 2.

   \[
   \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{8}{2}
   \]

   Simplifying gives:

   \[
   x = 4
   \]

4. **Verify the Solution:**
   To ensure our solution is correct, we substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation to check if both sides are equal.

   Original equation: \( 2x + 3 = 11 \)

   Substitute \( x = 4 \):

   \[
   2(4) + 3 = 11
   \]

   Simplifying the left side:

   \[
   8 + 3 = 11
   \]

   Since both sides of the equation are equal, our solution is verified.

**Final Answer:**
The solution to the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \) is \( x = 4 \).
