==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 146" entails. Since the problem statement is not explicitly provided, I'll demonstrate a general approach to solving a typical math problem by assuming a hypothetical scenario. Let's assume the problem involves solving a quadratic equation, as this is a common type of math problem.

**Hypothetical Problem:**
Solve the quadratic equation \(2x^2 - 4x - 6 = 0\).

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Identify the Equation Type:**
   The given equation \(2x^2 - 4x - 6 = 0\) is a quadratic equation in the standard form \(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\), where \(a = 2\), \(b = -4\), and \(c = -6\).

2. **Check for Simplification:**
   Before applying the quadratic formula, check if the equation can be simplified. In this case, all coefficients are divisible by 2:
   \[
   \frac{2x^2}{2} - \frac{4x}{2} - \frac{6}{2} = 0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad x^2 - 2x - 3 = 0
   \]

3. **Apply the Quadratic Formula:**
   The quadratic formula is given by:
   \[
   x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
   \]
   For the simplified equation \(x^2 - 2x - 3 = 0\), \(a = 1\), \(b = -2\), and \(c = -3\).

4. **Calculate the Discriminant:**
   The discriminant \(\Delta\) is calculated as:
   \[
   \Delta = b^2 - 4ac = (-2)^2 - 4 \times 1 \times (-3) = 4 + 12 = 16
   \]

5. **Find the Roots:**
   Since the discriminant is positive, there are two distinct real roots:
   \[
   x = \frac{-(-2) \pm \sqrt{16}}{2 \times 1} = \frac{2 \pm 4}{2}
   \]
   Calculate the two possible values for \(x\):
   \[
   x_1 = \frac{2 + 4}{2} = \frac{6}{2} = 3
   \]
   \[
   x_2 = \frac{2 - 4}{2} = \frac{-2}{2} = -1
   \]

6. **Verify the Solutions:**
   Substitute \(x_1 = 3\) and \(x_2 = -1\) back into the original equation to verify:
   - For \(x = 3\):
     \[
     2(3)^2 - 4(3) - 6 = 18 - 12 - 6 = 0
     \]
   - For \(x = -1\):
     \[
     2(-1)^2 - 4(-1) - 6 = 2 + 4 - 6 = 0
     \]

Both solutions satisfy the original equation.

**Final Answer:**
The solutions to the quadratic equation \(2x^2 - 4x - 6 = 0\) are \(x = 3\) and \(x = -1\).
