==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 146" refers to. Since the question is not explicitly provided, I'll create a hypothetical math problem and solve it step by step.

Let's assume "Sample reasoning question 146" is the following problem:

**Problem:**
A company produces two types of widgets: Type A and Type B. The company can produce a maximum of 100 widgets per day. Each Type A widget requires 2 hours of labor, and each Type B widget requires 3 hours of labor. The company has a maximum of 240 labor hours available per day. If the profit from each Type A widget is $5 and from each Type B widget is $7, how many of each type of widget should the company produce to maximize profit?

**Solution:**

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( x \) be the number of Type A widgets produced.
   - Let \( y \) be the number of Type B widgets produced.

2. **Set Up Constraints:**
   - The total number of widgets produced cannot exceed 100:
     \[
     x + y \leq 100
     \]
   - The total labor hours cannot exceed 240:
     \[
     2x + 3y \leq 240
     \]
   - Non-negativity constraints:
     \[
     x \geq 0, \quad y \geq 0
     \]

3. **Objective Function:**
   - The profit function to maximize is:
     \[
     P = 5x + 7y
     \]

4. **Graphical Solution Method:**
   - Plot the constraints on a graph.
   - The line \( x + y = 100 \) intersects the axes at \( (100, 0) \) and \( (0, 100) \).
   - The line \( 2x + 3y = 240 \) intersects the axes at \( (120, 0) \) and \( (0, 80) \).

5. **Find the Feasible Region:**
   - The feasible region is bounded by the lines \( x + y = 100 \), \( 2x + 3y = 240 \), and the axes.

6. **Identify Corner Points:**
   - The corner points of the feasible region are found by solving the system of equations:
     - Intersection of \( x + y = 100 \) and \( 2x + 3y = 240 \):
       \[
       \begin{align*}
       x + y &= 100 \\
       2x + 3y &= 240
       \end{align*}
       \]
     - Solve for \( y \) in the first equation: \( y = 100 - x \).
     - Substitute into the second equation:
       \[
       2x + 3(100 - x) = 240 \\
       2x + 300 - 3x = 240 \\
       -x + 300 = 240 \\
       x = 60
       \]
     - Substitute \( x = 60 \) back into \( y = 100 - x \):
       \[
       y = 100 - 60 = 40
       \]
     - So, one corner point is \( (60, 40) \).

   - Other corner points are \( (0, 80) \) and \( (100, 0) \).

7. **Evaluate the Objective Function at Each Corner Point:**
   - \( P(0, 80) = 5(0) + 7(80) = 560 \)
   - \( P(60, 40) = 5(60) + 7(40) = 300 + 280 = 580 \)
   - \( P(100, 0) = 5(100) + 7(0) = 500 \)

8. **Determine the Maximum Profit:**
   - The maximum profit is \( 580 \) at the point \( (60, 40) \).

**Final Answer:**
To maximize profit, the company should produce 60 Type A widgets and 40 Type B widgets per day, resulting in a maximum profit of $580.
