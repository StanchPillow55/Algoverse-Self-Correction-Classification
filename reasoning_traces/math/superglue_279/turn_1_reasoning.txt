==================================================

To solve the problem effectively, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 279" entails. However, since the problem statement is not provided, I'll demonstrate a general approach to solving a typical math problem by making reasonable assumptions about the type of problem it might be. Let's assume it's a typical algebra problem involving solving for a variable.

**Problem Assumption:**
Let's assume the problem is to solve the following equation for \( x \):

\[ 3x + 5 = 20 \]

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Equation:**
   The equation \( 3x + 5 = 20 \) is a linear equation in one variable, \( x \). Our goal is to isolate \( x \) on one side of the equation.

2. **Isolate the Variable:**
   To isolate \( x \), we need to perform operations that will leave \( x \) alone on one side of the equation.

3. **Subtract 5 from Both Sides:**
   Start by eliminating the constant term on the left side. Subtract 5 from both sides of the equation:

   \[
   3x + 5 - 5 = 20 - 5
   \]

   Simplifying both sides gives:

   \[
   3x = 15
   \]

4. **Divide by the Coefficient of \( x \):**
   Now, divide both sides by the coefficient of \( x \), which is 3, to solve for \( x \):

   \[
   \frac{3x}{3} = \frac{15}{3}
   \]

   Simplifying both sides gives:

   \[
   x = 5
   \]

5. **Verify the Solution:**
   Substitute \( x = 5 \) back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies the equation:

   \[
   3(5) + 5 = 20
   \]

   Simplifying the left side:

   \[
   15 + 5 = 20
   \]

   \[
   20 = 20
   \]

   The left side equals the right side, confirming that our solution is correct.

**Final Answer:**

The solution to the equation \( 3x + 5 = 20 \) is \( x = 5 \).

This approach demonstrates a clear, step-by-step method to solve a linear equation. If "Sample reasoning question 279" refers to a different type of problem, please provide more details or context so I can address it accurately.
