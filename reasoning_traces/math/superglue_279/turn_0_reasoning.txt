==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to first understand what is being asked. However, the question "Sample reasoning question 279" is not specific and does not provide any details or context about what the problem entails. Therefore, I will demonstrate a general approach to solving a typical math problem by creating a sample problem and solving it step by step.

Let's consider a sample math problem:

**Problem:**
A farmer has a rectangular field that is 120 meters long and 80 meters wide. He wants to build a fence around the entire field. How many meters of fencing does he need?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We need to find the total length of fencing required to enclose a rectangular field.
   - The field has a length of 120 meters and a width of 80 meters.

2. **Identify the Formula:**
   - The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula:
     \[
     P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width})
     \]

3. **Substitute the Given Values:**
   - Length (\(l\)) = 120 meters
   - Width (\(w\)) = 80 meters
   - Substitute these values into the perimeter formula:
     \[
     P = 2 \times (120 + 80)
     \]

4. **Perform the Calculations:**
   - First, calculate the sum inside the parentheses:
     \[
     120 + 80 = 200
     \]
   - Then, multiply by 2 to find the perimeter:
     \[
     P = 2 \times 200 = 400
     \]

5. **State the Final Answer:**
   - The farmer needs 400 meters of fencing to enclose the field.

By following these steps, we have solved the problem and determined that the farmer needs 400 meters of fencing. This approach can be applied to various math problems by understanding the problem, identifying relevant formulas, substituting given values, performing calculations, and stating the final answer.
