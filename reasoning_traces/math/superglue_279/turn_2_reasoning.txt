==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 279" refers to. Since the problem statement doesn't provide specific details about the question, I'll demonstrate a general approach to solving a math problem using logical reasoning and step-by-step calculations.

Let's assume "Sample reasoning question 279" is a typical math problem involving algebra. Here's a hypothetical problem and how we would solve it:

**Hypothetical Problem:**
Solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 3x + 5 = 20 \).

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We need to find the value of \( x \) that makes the equation true.
   - The equation given is \( 3x + 5 = 20 \).

2. **Isolate the Variable:**
   - To solve for \( x \), we need to get \( x \) by itself on one side of the equation.
   - Start by eliminating the constant term on the left side of the equation.

3. **Subtract 5 from Both Sides:**
   \[
   3x + 5 - 5 = 20 - 5
   \]
   - This simplifies to:
   \[
   3x = 15
   \]

4. **Divide by 3:**
   - To solve for \( x \), divide both sides of the equation by 3:
   \[
   \frac{3x}{3} = \frac{15}{3}
   \]
   - This simplifies to:
   \[
   x = 5
   \]

5. **Verify the Solution:**
   - Substitute \( x = 5 \) back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies the equation:
   \[
   3(5) + 5 = 20
   \]
   - Calculate the left side:
   \[
   15 + 5 = 20
   \]
   - Since both sides of the equation are equal, \( x = 5 \) is indeed the correct solution.

**Final Answer:**
The solution to the equation \( 3x + 5 = 20 \) is \( x = 5 \).

This step-by-step approach demonstrates how to solve a basic algebraic equation by isolating the variable, performing arithmetic operations, and verifying the solution. If "Sample reasoning question 279" refers to a different type of problem, please provide more details for a specific solution.
