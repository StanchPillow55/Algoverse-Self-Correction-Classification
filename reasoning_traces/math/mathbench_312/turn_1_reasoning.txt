Question ID: mathbench_312
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the sample math problem labeled "312," we need to first understand what the problem entails. However, since "312" is not a standard math problem description, I'll assume it's a placeholder or identifier for a specific problem. Without additional context or details, I'll create a hypothetical math problem involving the number 312 and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**
Calculate the sum of the digits of the number 312, then multiply the result by 3. Finally, subtract 5 from the product.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Identify the digits of the number 312:**
   - The number 312 consists of the digits 3, 1, and 2.

2. **Calculate the sum of the digits:**
   \[
   3 + 1 + 2 = 6
   \]

3. **Multiply the sum by 3:**
   \[
   6 \times 3 = 18
   \]

4. **Subtract 5 from the product:**
   \[
   18 - 5 = 13
   \]

**Final Answer:**
The result of the operations described in the hypothetical problem is 13.

If you have a specific problem labeled "312" or additional details, please provide them so I can solve the actual problem intended.
