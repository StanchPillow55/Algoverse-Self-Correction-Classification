==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 312," we need to first understand what the problem is asking. However, the problem statement "Sample math problem 312" is not specific and does not provide any details about the mathematical problem to be solved. Therefore, I will assume that this is a placeholder or an incomplete problem statement.

To proceed, let's consider a hypothetical math problem that could be labeled as "Sample math problem 312." For the sake of this exercise, I will create a problem involving basic algebra, which is a common topic in math problems.

**Hypothetical Problem:**
Solve for \( x \) in the equation: 
\[ 3x + 5 = 20 \]

**Step-by-step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Equation:**
   The equation given is \( 3x + 5 = 20 \). This is a linear equation in one variable, \( x \).

2. **Isolate the Variable:**
   To solve for \( x \), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We can start by eliminating the constant term on the left side of the equation.

3. **Subtract 5 from Both Sides:**
   \[
   3x + 5 - 5 = 20 - 5
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   3x = 15
   \]

4. **Divide Both Sides by 3:**
   To solve for \( x \), divide both sides of the equation by 3:
   \[
   \frac{3x}{3} = \frac{15}{3}
   \]
   Simplifying gives:
   \[
   x = 5
   \]

5. **Verify the Solution:**
   Substitute \( x = 5 \) back into the original equation to verify:
   \[
   3(5) + 5 = 20
   \]
   \[
   15 + 5 = 20
   \]
   \[
   20 = 20
   \]
   The left side equals the right side, confirming that our solution is correct.

**Final Answer:**
The solution to the equation \( 3x + 5 = 20 \) is \( x = 5 \).

If you have a specific problem labeled as "Sample math problem 312," please provide the details, and I will be happy to solve it for you.
