==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine the height of the sunflowers from Packet B given that the sunflowers from Packet A are 20% taller than those from Packet B. We know the height of the sunflowers from Packet A is 192 inches.

Let's denote the height of the sunflowers from Packet B as \( x \) inches.

According to the problem, the sunflowers from Packet A are 20% taller than those from Packet B. This means that the height of the sunflowers from Packet A is 120% of the height of the sunflowers from Packet B.

We can express this relationship mathematically as:

\[
192 = 1.20 \times x
\]

To find \( x \), we need to solve this equation for \( x \). We do this by dividing both sides of the equation by 1.20:

\[
x = \frac{192}{1.20}
\]

Now, let's perform the division:

\[
x = \frac{192}{1.20} = 160
\]

Therefore, the height of the sunflowers from Packet B is 160 inches.

To verify, we can check if 20% of 160 added to 160 equals 192:

1. Calculate 20% of 160:
   \[
   0.20 \times 160 = 32
   \]

2. Add this to the original height of Packet B's sunflowers:
   \[
   160 + 32 = 192
   \]

This confirms our calculation is correct.

Thus, the height of the sunflowers from Packet B is \(\boxed{160}\) inches.
