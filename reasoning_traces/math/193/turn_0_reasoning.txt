To find the height of the sunflowers from Packet B, we start by understanding the relationship between the heights of the sunflowers from the two packets.

1. **Identify the height of sunflowers from Packet A**: 
   - The height of the sunflowers from Packet A is given as 192 inches.

2. **Understand the relationship**: 
   - It is stated that the sunflowers from Packet A are 20% taller than those from Packet B. This means that the height of the sunflowers from Packet A is 120% of the height of the sunflowers from Packet B.

3. **Let the height of sunflowers from Packet B be denoted as \( x \)**. 
   - According to the relationship, we can express the height of Packet A in terms of \( x \):
   \[
   \text{Height of Packet A} = 1.2 \times \text{Height of Packet B}
   \]
   This can be written as:
   \[
   192 = 1.2 \times x
   \]

4. **Solve for \( x \)**:
   - To isolate \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 1.2:
   \[
   x = \frac{192}{1.2}
   \]

5. **Perform the division**:
   - To simplify \( \frac{192}{1.2} \), we can convert 1.2 to a fraction:
   \[
   1.2 = \frac{12}{10} = \frac{6}{5}
   \]
   Thus, we can rewrite the division:
   \[
   x = 192 \div 1.2 = 192 \times \frac{5}{6}
   \]

6. **Calculate \( 192 \times \frac{5}{6} \)**:
   - First, calculate \( 192 \div 6 \):
   \[
   192 \div 6 = 32
   \]
   - Now multiply by 5:
   \[
   32 \times 5 = 160
   \]

7. **Conclusion**:
   - Therefore, the height of the sunflowers from Packet B is \( x = 160 \) inches.

The final answer is:
\[
\text{The height of the sunflowers from Packet B is } 160 \text{ inches.}
\]
