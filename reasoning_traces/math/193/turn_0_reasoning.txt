To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step and keep track of the number of pink and white flamingos throughout the weekend.

1. **Initial Setup (Friday Morning)**:
   - The neighbors placed **18 pink flamingos** in Sue's yard.
   - At this point, the count is:
     - Pink flamingos: 18
     - White flamingos: 0

2. **Saturday Morning**:
   - The neighbors took back one third of the flamingos. 
   - To find out how many flamingos were taken back, we calculate one third of 18:
     \[
     \text{One third of 18} = \frac{18}{3} = 6
     \]
   - So, 6 flamingos were taken back and painted white.
   - After painting, the counts are:
     - Pink flamingos: \(18 - 6 = 12\)
     - White flamingos: 6

3. **Sunday Morning**:
   - The neighbors added another 18 pink flamingos to the yard.
   - Now, we update the counts:
     - Pink flamingos: \(12 + 18 = 30\)
     - White flamingos: 6

4. **Final Calculation (Noon on Sunday)**:
   - We need to find out how many more pink flamingos there are than white flamingos:
     \[
     \text{Difference} = \text{Number of pink flamingos} - \text{Number of white flamingos}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Difference} = 30 - 6 = 24
     \]

Thus, at noon on Sunday, there are **24 more pink plastic flamingos than white plastic flamingos**.

**Final Answer**: 24
