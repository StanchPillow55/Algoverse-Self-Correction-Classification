Question ID: 193
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Initial Number of Flamingos**: 
   On Friday morning, the neighbors placed 18 pink plastic flamingos in Sue's yard. 
   \[
   \text{Pink Flamingos (Friday)} = 18
   \]

2. **Taking Back Flamingos**: 
   On Saturday morning, the neighbors took back one third of the flamingos. 
   To find out how many flamingos were taken back, we calculate one third of 18:
   \[
   \text{Flamingos Taken Back} = \frac{1}{3} \times 18 = 6
   \]

3. **Painting Flamingos**: 
   The 6 flamingos that were taken back were painted white. 
   \[
   \text{White Flamingos} = 6
   \]

4. **Flamingos Remaining**: 
   After taking back 6 flamingos, the number of pink flamingos remaining in the yard is:
   \[
   \text{Pink Flamingos (Saturday)} = 18 - 6 = 12
   \]

5. **Adding More Flamingos**: 
   On Sunday morning, the neighbors added another 18 pink flamingos to the yard. 
   \[
   \text{Pink Flamingos (Sunday)} = 12 + 18 = 30
   \]

6. **Total Count of Flamingos**: 
   Now we have:
   - Pink Flamingos = 30
   - White Flamingos = 6

7. **Calculating the Difference**: 
   We need to find out how many more pink flamingos there are than white flamingos:
   \[
   \text{Difference} = \text{Pink Flamingos} - \text{White Flamingos} = 30 - 6 = 24
   \]

Thus, at noon on Sunday, there are 24 more pink plastic flamingos than white plastic flamingos.

**Final Answer**: 24
