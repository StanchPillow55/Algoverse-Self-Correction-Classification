==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine the height of the sunflowers from Packet B, given that the sunflowers from Packet A are 20% taller.

Let's denote the height of the sunflowers from Packet B as \( x \) inches.

According to the problem, the sunflowers from Packet A are 20% taller than those from Packet B. This means that the height of the sunflowers from Packet A is 120% of the height of the sunflowers from Packet B.

We can express this relationship mathematically as:
\[
\text{Height of sunflowers from Packet A} = 1.2 \times \text{Height of sunflowers from Packet B}
\]

We know from the problem that the height of the sunflowers from Packet A is 192 inches. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
\[
192 = 1.2 \times x
\]

To find \( x \), we need to solve this equation for \( x \). We do this by dividing both sides of the equation by 1.2:
\[
x = \frac{192}{1.2}
\]

Now, let's perform the division:
\[
x = \frac{192}{1.2} = 160
\]

Thus, the height of the sunflowers from Packet B is 160 inches.

Final Answer: The sunflowers from Packet B were 160 inches tall.
