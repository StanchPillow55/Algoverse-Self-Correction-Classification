Question ID: 193
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step and keep track of the number of pink and white flamingos throughout the weekend.

1. **Initial Setup (Friday)**:
   - On Friday morning, the neighbors placed **18 pink flamingos** in Sue's yard.
   - At this point:
     - Pink flamingos = 18
     - White flamingos = 0

2. **Saturday's Changes**:
   - On Saturday morning, the neighbors took back **one third** of the flamingos.
   - To find out how many flamingos were taken back, we calculate one third of 18:
     \[
     \text{One third of 18} = \frac{18}{3} = 6
     \]
   - So, 6 flamingos were taken back and painted white.
   - After taking back the flamingos:
     - Pink flamingos left = \( 18 - 6 = 12 \)
     - White flamingos added = 6
   - Now, the counts are:
     - Pink flamingos = 12
     - White flamingos = 6

3. **Sunday's Changes**:
   - On Sunday morning, the neighbors added another **18 pink flamingos** to the yard.
   - After adding the new pink flamingos:
     - Total pink flamingos = \( 12 + 18 = 30 \)
     - White flamingos remain the same = 6
   - Now, the counts are:
     - Pink flamingos = 30
     - White flamingos = 6

4. **Final Calculation**:
   - We need to find out how many more pink flamingos there are than white flamingos at noon on Sunday.
   - We calculate the difference:
     \[
     \text{Difference} = \text{Pink flamingos} - \text{White flamingos} = 30 - 6 = 24
     \]

Thus, at noon on Sunday, there are **24 more pink plastic flamingos** than white plastic flamingos.

**Final Answer**: 24
