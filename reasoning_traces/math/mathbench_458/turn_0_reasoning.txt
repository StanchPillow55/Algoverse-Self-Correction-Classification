==================================================

To solve the problem, we first need to understand what "Sample math problem 458" refers to. Since the problem itself isn't provided, I'll create a hypothetical math problem and solve it step by step. Let's assume "Sample math problem 458" is the following:

**Problem:**
Find the value of \( x \) in the equation \( 3x + 5 = 20 \).

**Solution:**

Step 1: Understand the equation.
The equation given is \( 3x + 5 = 20 \). This is a linear equation in one variable, \( x \).

Step 2: Isolate the variable term.
To solve for \( x \), we need to isolate the term containing \( x \) on one side of the equation. We can do this by subtracting 5 from both sides of the equation:

\[
3x + 5 - 5 = 20 - 5
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
3x = 15
\]

Step 3: Solve for \( x \).
Now, we need to solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides of the equation by 3:

\[
\frac{3x}{3} = \frac{15}{3}
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
x = 5
\]

Step 4: Verify the solution.
To ensure our solution is correct, we can substitute \( x = 5 \) back into the original equation:

\[
3(5) + 5 = 20
\]

Calculate the left side:

\[
15 + 5 = 20
\]

Since both sides of the equation are equal, our solution is verified.

**Final Answer:**
The value of \( x \) is 5.
