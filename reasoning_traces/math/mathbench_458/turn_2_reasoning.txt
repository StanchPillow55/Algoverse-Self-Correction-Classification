==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 458," we first need to understand what the problem is asking. However, the problem statement is not provided here. Let's assume a hypothetical math problem and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**

"Sample math problem 458: If a car travels at a constant speed of 60 miles per hour, how long will it take to travel a distance of 180 miles?"

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Identify the Given Information:**
   - Speed of the car = 60 miles per hour
   - Distance to be traveled = 180 miles

2. **Understand the Relationship:**
   - The relationship between distance, speed, and time is given by the formula:
     \[
     \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time}
     \]

3. **Rearrange the Formula to Solve for Time:**
   - We need to find the time it takes to travel 180 miles. Rearrange the formula to solve for time:
     \[
     \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}}
     \]

4. **Substitute the Known Values:**
   - Substitute the given values into the formula:
     \[
     \text{Time} = \frac{180 \text{ miles}}{60 \text{ miles per hour}}
     \]

5. **Perform the Calculation:**
   - Divide 180 by 60 to find the time:
     \[
     \text{Time} = 3 \text{ hours}
     \]

6. **Verify the Solution:**
   - To verify, multiply the time by the speed to check if it equals the distance:
     \[
     60 \text{ miles per hour} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 180 \text{ miles}
     \]
   - The calculation is correct.

**Final Answer:**

The car will take 3 hours to travel a distance of 180 miles at a constant speed of 60 miles per hour.

This hypothetical problem demonstrates how to approach a typical math problem involving distance, speed, and time. If you have a specific problem labeled "Sample math problem 458," please provide the details so I can assist you accurately.
