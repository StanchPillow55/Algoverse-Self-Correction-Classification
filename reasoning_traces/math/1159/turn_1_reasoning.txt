==================================================

To solve the problem, we first need to determine how many of the octuplets are dressed in purple and how many are dressed in blue.

1. **Total number of octuplets**: 8

2. **Dressing in colors**:
   - **Purple**: \( \frac{3}{4} \) of 8
     \[
     \text{Number of purple-wearers} = \frac{3}{4} \times 8 = 6
     \]
   - **Blue**: \( \frac{1}{4} \) of 8
     \[
     \text{Number of blue-wearers} = \frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2
     \]

3. **Bows**:
   - **Blue-wearers**: All 2 blue-wearers wear bows.
   - **Purple-wearers**: \( \frac{1}{3} \) of the 6 purple-wearers wear bows.
     \[
     \text{Number of purple-wearers with bows} = \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2
     \]

4. **Total number of babies wearing bows**:
   \[
   \text{Total with bows} = \text{Blue-wearers with bows} + \text{Purple-wearers with bows} = 2 + 2 = 4
   \]

5. **Calculating the percentage chance a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple**:
   - The number of babies wearing bows that are purple is 2.
   - The total number of babies wearing bows is 4.
   - The probability (or percentage chance) that a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple is given by:
     \[
     \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of purple-wearers with bows}}{\text{Total number of babies with bows}} \right) \times 100
     \]
     \[
     \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{2}{4} \right) \times 100 = 50\%
     \]

Thus, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{50\%}
\]
