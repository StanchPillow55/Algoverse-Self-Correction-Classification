Question ID: 1159
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the total number of octuplets**: Carla has 8 identical octuplets.

2. **Calculate how many are dressed in purple and blue**:
   - **Purple**: \( \frac{3}{4} \) of 8 octuplets:
     \[
     \text{Number in purple} = \frac{3}{4} \times 8 = 6
     \]
   - **Blue**: \( \frac{1}{4} \) of 8 octuplets:
     \[
     \text{Number in blue} = \frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2
     \]

3. **Determine how many wear bows**:
   - **Blue-wearers**: All 2 blue-wearers wear bows.
   - **Purple-wearers**: \( \frac{1}{3} \) of the 6 purple-wearers wear bows:
     \[
     \text{Number of purple wearers with bows} = \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2
     \]

4. **Total number of babies wearing bows**:
   \[
   \text{Total wearing bows} = \text{Blue with bows} + \text{Purple with bows} = 2 + 2 = 4
   \]

5. **Determine the number of babies wearing bows that are purple**:
   - We found that 2 of the purple-wearers are wearing bows.

6. **Calculate the percentage chance that a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple**:
   - The probability (or percentage chance) that a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple is given by the ratio of purple-wearers with bows to the total number of babies wearing bows:
   \[
   \text{Percentage chance} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of purple wearers with bows}}{\text{Total wearing bows}} \right) \times 100
   \]
   \[
   \text{Percentage chance} = \left( \frac{2}{4} \right) \times 100 = 50\%
   \]

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{50\%}
\]
