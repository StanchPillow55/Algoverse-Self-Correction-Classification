To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the total number of octuplets**: 
   Carla has 8 identical octuplets.

2. **Calculate how many are dressed in purple and blue**:
   - **Purple**: \( \frac{3}{4} \) of the octuplets are dressed in purple.
     \[
     \text{Number of purple-wearers} = \frac{3}{4} \times 8 = 6
     \]
   - **Blue**: \( \frac{1}{4} \) of the octuplets are dressed in blue.
     \[
     \text{Number of blue-wearers} = \frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2
     \]

3. **Determine how many of the purple and blue wearers wear bows**:
   - **Blue wearers**: All blue-wearers wear bows.
     \[
     \text{Number of blue wearers with bows} = 2
     \]
   - **Purple wearers**: \( \frac{1}{3} \) of the purple wearers wear bows.
     \[
     \text{Number of purple wearers with bows} = \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2
     \]

4. **Calculate the total number of babies wearing bows**:
   - Total babies wearing bows = blue wearers with bows + purple wearers with bows.
     \[
     \text{Total wearing bows} = 2 + 2 = 4
     \]

5. **Determine how many of the babies wearing bows are wearing purple**:
   - From our previous calculation, we found that 2 of the purple wearers are wearing bows.

6. **Calculate the percentage of babies wearing bows that are wearing purple**:
   - The percentage chance that a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple is given by the formula:
     \[
     \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of purple wearers with bows}}{\text{Total number of babies wearing bows}} \right) \times 100
     \]
   - Plugging in the numbers:
     \[
     \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{2}{4} \right) \times 100 = 50\%
     \]

Thus, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{50\%}
\]
