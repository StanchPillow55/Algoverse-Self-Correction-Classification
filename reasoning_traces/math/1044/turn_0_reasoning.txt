==================================================

To find the difference between Cole and Xavier's heights after they have both grown over the summer, we need to first determine their new heights.

### Step 1: Convert Xavier's height to inches
Xavier was originally 4 feet tall. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we can convert his height to inches:
\[
4 \text{ feet} = 4 \times 12 \text{ inches} = 48 \text{ inches}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate Xavier's new height
Xavier grew 3 inches over the summer. Therefore, we add this growth to his original height:
\[
\text{Xavier's new height} = 48 \text{ inches} + 3 \text{ inches} = 51 \text{ inches}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate Cole's new height
Cole was originally 50 inches tall and grew 2 inches over the summer. We add this growth to his original height:
\[
\text{Cole's new height} = 50 \text{ inches} + 2 \text{ inches} = 52 \text{ inches}
\]

### Step 4: Find the difference in height between Cole and Xavier
Now that we have both of their new heights, we can find the difference:
\[
\text{Difference} = \text{Cole's new height} - \text{Xavier's new height} = 52 \text{ inches} - 51 \text{ inches} = 1 \text{ inch}
\]

### Final Answer
The difference between Cole and Xavierâ€™s height now is:
\[
\boxed{1 \text{ inch}}
\]
