To solve the problem, we will go through it step by step, calculating how much money Julie spends and how much she has left after each step.

1. **Initial Amount**: Julie starts with $500.

2. **Calculating the Amount Spent on Clothes**:
   - Julie spends 20% of her initial amount on clothes.
   - To find 20% of $500, we can use the formula:
     \[
     \text{Amount spent on clothes} = 0.20 \times 500
     \]
   - Calculating this gives:
     \[
     0.20 \times 500 = 100
     \]
   - So, Julie spends $100 on clothes.

3. **Calculating Remaining Money After Clothes**:
   - To find out how much money Julie has left after buying clothes, we subtract the amount spent on clothes from her initial amount:
     \[
     \text{Remaining money} = 500 - 100
     \]
   - This gives:
     \[
     500 - 100 = 400
     \]
   - Now, Julie has $400 left.

4. **Calculating the Amount Spent on CDs**:
   - Next, Julie spends 25% of the remaining money on CDs.
   - To find 25% of $400, we use the formula:
     \[
     \text{Amount spent on CDs} = 0.25 \times 400
     \]
   - Calculating this gives:
     \[
     0.25 \times 400 = 100
     \]
   - So, Julie spends $100 on CDs.

5. **Calculating Remaining Money After CDs**:
   - To find out how much money Julie has left after buying CDs, we subtract the amount spent on CDs from her remaining money:
     \[
     \text{Final remaining money} = 400 - 100
     \]
   - This gives:
     \[
     400 - 100 = 300
     \]
   - Now, Julie has $300 left.

6. **Final Answer**:
   - Therefore, the amount of money Julie has left after her purchases is:
     \[
     \boxed{300}
     \]
