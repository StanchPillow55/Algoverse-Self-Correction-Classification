Question ID: 156
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine the cost of each item George bought and then sum these costs to find the total amount he paid.

1. **Cost of the Sandwich:**
   - The sandwich costs $4.

2. **Cost of the Juice:**
   - The juice is two times more expensive than the sandwich.
   - Therefore, the cost of the juice is \( 2 \times 4 = 8 \) dollars.

3. **Total Cost of the Sandwich and Juice:**
   - The combined cost of the sandwich and juice is \( 4 + 8 = 12 \) dollars.

4. **Cost of the Milk:**
   - The cost of the milk is 75% of the total cost of the sandwich and juice.
   - To find 75% of $12, we calculate \( 0.75 \times 12 = 9 \) dollars.

5. **Total Cost of All Items:**
   - Finally, we add the costs of the sandwich, juice, and milk to find the total amount George paid.
   - Total cost = Cost of sandwich + Cost of juice + Cost of milk
   - Total cost = \( 4 + 8 + 9 = 21 \) dollars.

Therefore, George paid a total of $21 for his food.

**Final Answer: $21**
