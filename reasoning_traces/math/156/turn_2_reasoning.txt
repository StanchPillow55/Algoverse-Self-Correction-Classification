Question ID: 156
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine the cost of each item George bought and then sum these costs to find the total amount he paid for his food.

1. **Cost of the Sandwich:**
   - The problem states that the sandwich costs $4.

2. **Cost of the Juice:**
   - The juice is two times more expensive than the sandwich. Therefore, the cost of the juice is:
     \[
     \text{Cost of Juice} = 2 \times \text{Cost of Sandwich} = 2 \times 4 = 8 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Total Cost of the Sandwich and Juice:**
   - Add the cost of the sandwich and the juice:
     \[
     \text{Total Cost of Sandwich and Juice} = 4 + 8 = 12 \text{ dollars}
     \]

4. **Cost of the Milk:**
   - The bottle of milk costs 75% of the total cost of the sandwich and juice. To find 75% of $12, we calculate:
     \[
     \text{Cost of Milk} = 0.75 \times 12 = 9 \text{ dollars}
     \]

5. **Total Cost of All Items:**
   - Finally, add the costs of the sandwich, juice, and milk to find the total amount George paid:
     \[
     \text{Total Cost} = \text{Cost of Sandwich} + \text{Cost of Juice} + \text{Cost of Milk} = 4 + 8 + 9 = 21 \text{ dollars}
     \]

Therefore, George paid a total of $21 for his food.

**Final Answer: $21**
