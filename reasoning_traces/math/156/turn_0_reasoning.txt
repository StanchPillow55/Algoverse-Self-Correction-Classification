==================================================

To determine how many bananas the zookeeper needs to order for the apes in the zoo for 2 months, we first need to calculate the total banana consumption for each type of ape (monkeys, gorillas, and baboons) over that period.

1. **Calculate the monthly banana needs for each type of ape:**
   - **Monkeys:** 200 bananas per month
   - **Gorillas:** 400 bananas per month
   - **Baboons:** 100 bananas per month

2. **Calculate the total monthly banana consumption:**
   We add the monthly needs of all three types of apes:
   \[
   \text{Total monthly bananas} = \text{Monkeys} + \text{Gorillas} + \text{Baboons}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total monthly bananas} = 200 + 400 + 100 = 700 \text{ bananas}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total banana consumption for 2 months:**
   Since the zookeeper orders bananas every 2 months, we need to multiply the total monthly consumption by 2:
   \[
   \text{Total for 2 months} = \text{Total monthly bananas} \times 2
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total for 2 months} = 700 \times 2 = 1400 \text{ bananas}
   \]

4. **Final Answer:**
   The zookeeper needs to order **1400 bananas** to last for 2 months.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{1400}
\]
