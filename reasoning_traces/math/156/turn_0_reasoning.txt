==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine the cost of each item George bought and then sum these costs to find the total amount he paid for his food.

1. **Determine the cost of the sandwich:**
   - The problem states that the sandwich costs $4.

2. **Determine the cost of the juice:**
   - The juice is two times more expensive than the sandwich. 
   - Therefore, the cost of the juice is \(2 \times 4 = 8\) dollars.

3. **Calculate the total cost of the sandwich and juice:**
   - The total cost of the sandwich and juice is \(4 + 8 = 12\) dollars.

4. **Determine the cost of the bottle of milk:**
   - The cost of the milk is 75% of the total cost of the sandwich and juice.
   - To find 75% of 12 dollars, we calculate:
     \[
     0.75 \times 12 = 9 \text{ dollars}
     \]

5. **Calculate the total amount George paid for all the food:**
   - Add the costs of the sandwich, juice, and milk:
     \[
     4 + 8 + 9 = 21 \text{ dollars}
     \]

Therefore, George paid a total of $21 for his food.

**Final Answer: George paid $21 for his food.**
