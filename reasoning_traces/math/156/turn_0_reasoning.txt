==================================================

To find out how much George paid for his food, we will break down the costs step by step.

1. **Cost of the Sandwich**:
   - The sandwich costs $4.

2. **Cost of the Juice**:
   - The juice is two times more expensive than the sandwich. Therefore, we calculate the cost of the juice as follows:
   \[
   \text{Cost of Juice} = 2 \times \text{Cost of Sandwich} = 2 \times 4 = 8
   \]
   So, the juice costs $8.

3. **Total Cost of the Sandwich and Juice**:
   - Now, we will find the total cost of the sandwich and juice:
   \[
   \text{Total Cost of Sandwich and Juice} = \text{Cost of Sandwich} + \text{Cost of Juice} = 4 + 8 = 12
   \]
   Thus, the total cost of the sandwich and juice is $12.

4. **Cost of the Milk**:
   - The bottle of milk costs 75% of the total cost of the sandwich and juice. We calculate the cost of the milk as follows:
   \[
   \text{Cost of Milk} = 0.75 \times \text{Total Cost of Sandwich and Juice} = 0.75 \times 12 = 9
   \]
   Therefore, the milk costs $9.

5. **Total Cost of All Items**:
   - Finally, we will find the total cost of all items (sandwich, juice, and milk):
   \[
   \text{Total Cost} = \text{Cost of Sandwich} + \text{Cost of Juice} + \text{Cost of Milk} = 4 + 8 + 9 = 21
   \]

Thus, the total amount George paid for his food is \(\boxed{21}\).
