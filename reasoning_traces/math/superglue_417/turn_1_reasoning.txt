Question ID: superglue_417
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we first need to understand what "Sample reasoning question 417" refers to. Since the question doesn't provide specific details, let's assume it's a generic math problem that requires logical reasoning. I'll create a hypothetical problem and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**

Suppose we have a sequence of numbers where each number is the sum of the previous two numbers. The sequence starts with 1 and 1. What is the 10th number in this sequence?

**Step-by-step Solution:**

1. **Identify the Sequence Pattern:**
   - The sequence is defined such that each number is the sum of the two preceding numbers. This is known as the Fibonacci sequence.

2. **Write Down the Initial Terms:**
   - The sequence starts with: 1, 1

3. **Calculate the Next Terms:**
   - 3rd term: \(1 + 1 = 2\)
   - 4th term: \(1 + 2 = 3\)
   - 5th term: \(2 + 3 = 5\)
   - 6th term: \(3 + 5 = 8\)
   - 7th term: \(5 + 8 = 13\)
   - 8th term: \(8 + 13 = 21\)
   - 9th term: \(13 + 21 = 34\)
   - 10th term: \(21 + 34 = 55\)

4. **Verify the Pattern:**
   - Check that each term is indeed the sum of the two preceding terms. This confirms that our calculations are correct.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The 10th number in the sequence is 55.

**Final Answer:**
The 10th number in the sequence is 55.
