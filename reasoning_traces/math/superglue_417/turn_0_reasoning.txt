==================================================

To solve the problem, we first need to understand what "Sample reasoning question 417" refers to. Since the question is not explicitly stated, I'll assume it's a generic math problem that requires a step-by-step reasoning approach. Let's create a sample math problem and solve it.

**Sample Problem:**

A farmer has a rectangular field that is 50 meters long and 30 meters wide. He wants to divide the field into smaller rectangular sections, each with an area of 150 square meters, to plant different crops. How many such sections can he create?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We have a rectangular field with dimensions 50 meters (length) and 30 meters (width).
   - We need to divide this field into smaller rectangles, each with an area of 150 square meters.

2. **Calculate the Total Area of the Field:**
   \[
   \text{Total Area} = \text{Length} \times \text{Width} = 50 \, \text{m} \times 30 \, \text{m} = 1500 \, \text{square meters}
   \]

3. **Determine the Number of Smaller Sections:**
   - Each smaller section has an area of 150 square meters.
   - To find the number of such sections, divide the total area by the area of one section:
   \[
   \text{Number of Sections} = \frac{\text{Total Area}}{\text{Area of One Section}} = \frac{1500 \, \text{square meters}}{150 \, \text{square meters}} = 10
   \]

4. **Verify the Solution:**
   - If we divide the field into 10 sections, each with an area of 150 square meters, the total area covered by these sections is:
   \[
   10 \times 150 \, \text{square meters} = 1500 \, \text{square meters}
   \]
   - This matches the total area of the field, confirming our solution is correct.

5. **Final Answer:**
   - The farmer can create 10 smaller rectangular sections, each with an area of 150 square meters.

Thus, the final answer is that the farmer can create 10 sections.
