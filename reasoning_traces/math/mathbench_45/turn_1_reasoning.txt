==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 45," we need to first understand what the problem is asking. However, the problem statement is incomplete as it only says "Sample math problem 45" without providing any specific details or context. 

Since there is no specific problem given, let's assume a hypothetical math problem involving the number 45 and solve it step by step. 

**Hypothetical Problem:**
Find the prime factorization of the number 45.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understanding Prime Factorization:**
   Prime factorization involves expressing a number as a product of its prime factors. A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.

2. **Start with the Smallest Prime:**
   Begin with the smallest prime number, which is 2. Check if 45 is divisible by 2. Since 45 is an odd number, it is not divisible by 2.

3. **Move to the Next Prime Number:**
   The next prime number is 3. Check if 45 is divisible by 3. To do this, add the digits of 45: \(4 + 5 = 9\). Since 9 is divisible by 3, 45 is also divisible by 3.

4. **Divide by 3:**
   Divide 45 by 3:
   \[
   45 \div 3 = 15
   \]
   So, one of the prime factors is 3.

5. **Factor 15:**
   Now, factor 15. Again, check divisibility by 3. Add the digits of 15: \(1 + 5 = 6\). Since 6 is divisible by 3, 15 is also divisible by 3.

6. **Divide by 3 Again:**
   Divide 15 by 3:
   \[
   15 \div 3 = 5
   \]
   So, another prime factor is 3.

7. **Factor 5:**
   The result is 5, which is a prime number. Therefore, 5 is also a prime factor.

8. **Write the Prime Factorization:**
   Now we have expressed 45 as a product of prime numbers:
   \[
   45 = 3 \times 3 \times 5
   \]

9. **Express Using Exponents:**
   The prime factorization can also be written using exponents:
   \[
   45 = 3^2 \times 5^1
   \]

**Final Answer:**
The prime factorization of 45 is \(3^2 \times 5\).

This solution assumes a hypothetical problem involving the number 45. If you have a specific problem in mind, please provide more details so I can assist you accurately.
