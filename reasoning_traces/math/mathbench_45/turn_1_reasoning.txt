==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 45," we need to first understand what the problem is asking. Since the problem statement is not clear, let's assume that "Sample math problem 45" refers to a specific math problem involving the number 45. Without additional context, I'll create a problem involving the number 45 and solve it step by step.

**Problem:**  
Find the prime factorization of the number 45 and determine if 45 is a perfect square.

**Step 1: Prime Factorization of 45**

To find the prime factorization of 45, we need to divide 45 by the smallest prime numbers until we reach 1.

1. **Divide by 2:**  
   45 is an odd number, so it is not divisible by 2.

2. **Divide by 3:**  
   Check if 45 is divisible by 3. A number is divisible by 3 if the sum of its digits is divisible by 3.  
   The sum of the digits of 45 is \(4 + 5 = 9\), which is divisible by 3.  
   Divide 45 by 3:  
   \[
   45 \div 3 = 15
   \]

3. **Divide 15 by 3:**  
   Again, check if 15 is divisible by 3. The sum of the digits of 15 is \(1 + 5 = 6\), which is divisible by 3.  
   Divide 15 by 3:  
   \[
   15 \div 3 = 5
   \]

4. **Divide 5 by 5:**  
   5 is a prime number, so it is only divisible by itself.  
   Divide 5 by 5:  
   \[
   5 \div 5 = 1
   \]

The prime factorization of 45 is \(3 \times 3 \times 5\), or \(3^2 \times 5\).

**Step 2: Determine if 45 is a Perfect Square**

A perfect square is a number that can be expressed as the square of an integer. For 45 to be a perfect square, all the prime factors must appear in pairs.

From the prime factorization \(3^2 \times 5\), we see that:

- The factor 3 appears in a pair (since \(3^2\)).
- The factor 5 does not appear in a pair (since it is \(5^1\)).

Since not all prime factors of 45 appear in pairs, 45 is not a perfect square.

**Final Answer:**

The prime factorization of 45 is \(3^2 \times 5\).  
45 is not a perfect square.
