==================================================

It seems like the problem statement is incomplete or unclear. "Sample math problem 45" does not provide enough information for me to solve a specific problem. However, I can guide you through a generic math problem-solving process or help with a specific type of math problem if you provide more details. 

For now, I'll demonstrate how to solve a typical math problem involving basic arithmetic or algebra. Let's assume the problem is:

**Problem:**
Solve for \( x \) in the equation: \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).

**Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   We need to find the value of \( x \) that makes the equation true.

2. **Isolate the Variable:**
   To solve for \( x \), we need to get \( x \) by itself on one side of the equation.

3. **Subtract 3 from Both Sides:**
   \[
   2x + 3 - 3 = 11 - 3
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   2x = 8
   \]

4. **Divide Both Sides by 2:**
   \[
   \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{8}{2}
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   x = 4
   \]

5. **Check the Solution:**
   Substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation to verify:
   \[
   2(4) + 3 = 11
   \]
   \[
   8 + 3 = 11
   \]
   \[
   11 = 11
   \]
   The left side equals the right side, confirming that our solution is correct.

**Final Answer:**
\( x = 4 \)

If you have a specific problem or a different type of math question, please provide more details, and I'll be happy to help!
