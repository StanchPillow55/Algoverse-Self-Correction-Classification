It seems like the problem statement is incomplete. However, I will assume that "Sample math problem 45" refers to a generic math problem involving the number 45. Let's create a problem involving the number 45 and solve it step by step.

**Problem:**
Find the prime factorization of 45, and then determine the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 45 and another number, say 60.

**Step 1: Prime Factorization of 45**

To find the prime factorization of 45, we need to express it as a product of prime numbers.

1. Start with the smallest prime number, which is 2. Since 45 is odd, it is not divisible by 2.
2. Move to the next prime number, which is 3. Check if 45 is divisible by 3:
   \[
   45 \div 3 = 15
   \]
   So, 45 is divisible by 3. We write:
   \[
   45 = 3 \times 15
   \]
3. Now, factor 15. Again, check divisibility by 3:
   \[
   15 \div 3 = 5
   \]
   So, 15 is divisible by 3. We write:
   \[
   15 = 3 \times 5
   \]
4. Now, 5 is a prime number.

Thus, the prime factorization of 45 is:
\[
45 = 3^2 \times 5
\]

**Step 2: Prime Factorization of 60**

Now, let's find the prime factorization of 60.

1. Start with the smallest prime number, 2. Check if 60 is divisible by 2:
   \[
   60 \div 2 = 30
   \]
   So, 60 is divisible by 2. We write:
   \[
   60 = 2 \times 30
   \]
2. Factor 30. Check divisibility by 2:
   \[
   30 \div 2 = 15
   \]
   So, 30 is divisible by 2. We write:
   \[
   30 = 2 \times 15
   \]
3. Factor 15. Check divisibility by 3:
   \[
   15 \div 3 = 5
   \]
   So, 15 is divisible by 3. We write:
   \[
   15 = 3 \times 5
   \]
4. Now, 5 is a prime number.

Thus, the prime factorization of 60 is:
\[
60 = 2^2 \times 3 \times 5
\]

**Step 3: Finding the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD)**

To find the GCD of 45 and 60, we look for the lowest powers of all common prime factors.

- The prime factors of 45 are \(3^2\) and \(5\).
- The prime factors of 60 are \(2^2\), \(3\), and \(5\).

The common prime factors are 3 and 5.

- For 3, the lowest power is \(3^1\).
- For 5, the lowest power is \(5^1\).

Thus, the GCD is:
\[
GCD = 3^1 \times 5^1 = 3 \times 5 = 15
\]

**Final Answer:**

The greatest common divisor (GCD) of 45 and 60 is 15.
