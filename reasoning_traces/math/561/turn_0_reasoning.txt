==================================================

To find the average weight of Mark, Susan, and Bob, we will follow these steps:

1. **Determine Susan's weight**:
   - We know that Mark weighs 150 pounds.
   - Susan weighs 20 pounds less than Mark.
   - Therefore, we can calculate Susan's weight as follows:
     \[
     \text{Susan's weight} = \text{Mark's weight} - 20 = 150 - 20 = 130 \text{ pounds}
     \]

2. **Determine Bob's weight**:
   - Bob weighs twice as much as Susan.
   - We can calculate Bob's weight as follows:
     \[
     \text{Bob's weight} = 2 \times \text{Susan's weight} = 2 \times 130 = 260 \text{ pounds}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total weight of the three friends**:
   - Now we will add the weights of Mark, Susan, and Bob together:
     \[
     \text{Total weight} = \text{Mark's weight} + \text{Susan's weight} + \text{Bob's weight}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total weight} = 150 + 130 + 260 = 540 \text{ pounds}
     \]

4. **Calculate the average weight**:
   - The average weight is found by dividing the total weight by the number of friends:
     \[
     \text{Average weight} = \frac{\text{Total weight}}{\text{Number of friends}} = \frac{540}{3}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Average weight} = 180 \text{ pounds}
     \]

Thus, the average weight of Mark, Susan, and Bob is \(\boxed{180}\) pounds.
