==================================================

To determine how many hours Kris still needs to play to earn the achievement, we will first calculate the total hours she has already played based on the information provided.

1. **Calculate the hours played in the first 2 weeks:**
   - Kris plays for half an hour every day.
   - There are 14 days in 2 weeks.

   \[
   \text{Hours played in 2 weeks} = \text{Daily playtime} \times \text{Number of days}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Hours played in 2 weeks} = 0.5 \text{ hours/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 7 \text{ hours}
   \]

2. **Calculate the hours played in the following week:**
   - Kris plays for 2 hours every day for 1 week.
   - There are 7 days in a week.

   \[
   \text{Hours played in 1 week} = \text{Daily playtime} \times \text{Number of days}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Hours played in 1 week} = 2 \text{ hours/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 14 \text{ hours}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total hours played:**
   - Now we add the hours played in both periods.

   \[
   \text{Total hours played} = \text{Hours from 2 weeks} + \text{Hours from 1 week}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total hours played} = 7 \text{ hours} + 14 \text{ hours} = 21 \text{ hours}
   \]

4. **Determine how many hours are still needed to reach the achievement:**
   - The achievement requires a total of 30 hours.

   \[
   \text{Hours needed} = \text{Total hours required} - \text{Total hours played}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Hours needed} = 30 \text{ hours} - 21 \text{ hours} = 9 \text{ hours}
   \]

Therefore, Kris still needs to play **9 hours** to earn the achievement.

Final answer: **9 hours**
