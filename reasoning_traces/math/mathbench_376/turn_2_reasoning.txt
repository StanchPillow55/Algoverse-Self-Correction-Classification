==================================================

To solve "Sample math problem 376," we first need to understand what the problem is asking. However, the problem statement "Sample math problem 376" is not specific enough for me to determine the exact question or the type of math problem it is. 

To proceed, I will assume a generic approach to solving a math problem by outlining a step-by-step method that can be applied to various types of math problems. If you have a specific math problem in mind, please provide more details.

### Generic Math Problem Solving Steps:

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - Read the problem carefully.
   - Identify what is being asked.
   - Determine what information is given and what needs to be found.

2. **Devise a Plan:**
   - Consider possible strategies to solve the problem (e.g., algebraic manipulation, drawing a diagram, using a formula).
   - Choose the most appropriate method based on the problem type.

3. **Carry Out the Plan:**
   - Execute the chosen strategy step by step.
   - Perform calculations carefully.
   - Keep track of units and ensure consistency.

4. **Review/Check the Solution:**
   - Verify that the solution answers the question posed.
   - Check calculations for accuracy.
   - Consider whether the solution is reasonable and makes sense in the context of the problem.

5. **State the Final Answer:**
   - Clearly present the final answer.
   - Include units if applicable.

### Example Problem and Solution:

Let's consider an example problem to illustrate these steps:

**Example Problem:**
Solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).

**Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We need to find the value of \( x \) that satisfies the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).

2. **Devise a Plan:**
   - Use algebraic manipulation to isolate \( x \).

3. **Carry Out the Plan:**
   - Subtract 3 from both sides of the equation:
     \[
     2x + 3 - 3 = 11 - 3
     \]
     \[
     2x = 8
     \]
   - Divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( x \):
     \[
     \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{8}{2}
     \]
     \[
     x = 4
     \]

4. **Review/Check the Solution:**
   - Substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation to verify:
     \[
     2(4) + 3 = 8 + 3 = 11
     \]
   - The left-hand side equals the right-hand side, confirming the solution is correct.

5. **State the Final Answer:**
   - The solution to the equation is \( x = 4 \).
