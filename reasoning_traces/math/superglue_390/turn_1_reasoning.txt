==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 390" refers to. Since the question is not explicitly stated, I'll assume it's a placeholder for a typical math problem. Let's create a hypothetical math problem and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**

A company produces two types of gadgets: Type A and Type B. The company can produce up to 100 gadgets in a day. Each Type A gadget requires 2 hours to produce, and each Type B gadget requires 1 hour to produce. The company has a total of 160 production hours available each day. If the profit from each Type A gadget is $30 and from each Type B gadget is $20, how many of each type of gadget should the company produce to maximize profit?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( x \) be the number of Type A gadgets produced.
   - Let \( y \) be the number of Type B gadgets produced.

2. **Set Up Constraints:**
   - The total number of gadgets produced cannot exceed 100:
     \[
     x + y \leq 100
     \]
   - The total production hours cannot exceed 160:
     \[
     2x + y \leq 160
     \]
   - Non-negativity constraints:
     \[
     x \geq 0, \quad y \geq 0
     \]

3. **Objective Function:**
   - The profit function to maximize is:
     \[
     P = 30x + 20y
     \]

4. **Graph the Constraints:**
   - Plot the line \( x + y = 100 \).
   - Plot the line \( 2x + y = 160 \).
   - Identify the feasible region that satisfies all constraints.

5. **Find the Corner Points:**
   - Solve the system of equations to find the intersection points:
     - \( x + y = 100 \)
     - \( 2x + y = 160 \)

     Subtract the first equation from the second:
     \[
     (2x + y) - (x + y) = 160 - 100 \\
     x = 60
     \]

     Substitute \( x = 60 \) back into \( x + y = 100 \):
     \[
     60 + y = 100 \\
     y = 40
     \]

   - Other corner points are found by setting \( x = 0 \) and \( y = 0 \):
     - If \( x = 0 \), \( y = 100 \) from \( x + y = 100 \).
     - If \( y = 0 \), \( x = 80 \) from \( 2x + y = 160 \).

6. **Evaluate the Objective Function at Each Corner Point:**
   - \( (x, y) = (0, 100) \): \( P = 30(0) + 20(100) = 2000 \)
   - \( (x, y) = (80, 0) \): \( P = 30(80) + 20(0) = 2400 \)
   - \( (x, y) = (60, 40) \): \( P = 30(60) + 20(40) = 1800 + 800 = 2600 \)

7. **Conclusion:**
   - The maximum profit is $2600, achieved by producing 60 Type A gadgets and 40 Type B gadgets.

**Final Answer:**
To maximize profit, the company should produce 60 Type A gadgets and 40 Type B gadgets, resulting in a maximum profit of $2600.
