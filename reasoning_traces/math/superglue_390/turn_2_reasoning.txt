==================================================

To solve the problem effectively, let's first clarify what "Sample reasoning question 390" might entail. Since the problem statement is not explicitly provided, I'll assume it's a generic math problem that requires logical reasoning and step-by-step calculations. I'll create a hypothetical problem and solve it.

**Hypothetical Problem:**
A company produces two types of widgets: Type A and Type B. The production cost for Type A is $5 per unit, and for Type B, it is $8 per unit. The company sells Type A for $10 per unit and Type B for $15 per unit. Last month, the company produced a total of 1000 widgets, consisting of both Type A and Type B, and made a total revenue of $12,000. How many units of each type were produced?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( x \) be the number of Type A widgets produced.
   - Let \( y \) be the number of Type B widgets produced.

2. **Set Up Equations:**
   - From the problem, we know the total number of widgets produced is 1000. Therefore, we have:
     \[
     x + y = 1000
     \]

   - We also know the total revenue from selling the widgets is $12,000. The revenue from Type A is \( 10x \) and from Type B is \( 15y \). Therefore, we have:
     \[
     10x + 15y = 12000
     \]

3. **Solve the System of Equations:**
   - We have the system of equations:
     \[
     \begin{align*}
     x + y &= 1000 \quad \text{(Equation 1)} \\
     10x + 15y &= 12000 \quad \text{(Equation 2)}
     \end{align*}
     \]

   - Solve Equation 1 for \( y \):
     \[
     y = 1000 - x
     \]

   - Substitute \( y = 1000 - x \) into Equation 2:
     \[
     10x + 15(1000 - x) = 12000
     \]

   - Simplify and solve for \( x \):
     \[
     10x + 15000 - 15x = 12000
     \]
     \[
     -5x + 15000 = 12000
     \]
     \[
     -5x = 12000 - 15000
     \]
     \[
     -5x = -3000
     \]
     \[
     x = 600
     \]

   - Substitute \( x = 600 \) back into Equation 1 to find \( y \):
     \[
     600 + y = 1000
     \]
     \[
     y = 400
     \]

4. **Verify the Solution:**
   - Check the total number of widgets:
     \[
     x + y = 600 + 400 = 1000
     \]
     - This is correct.

   - Check the total revenue:
     \[
     10x + 15y = 10(600) + 15(400) = 6000 + 6000 = 12000
     \]
     - This is also correct.

**Final Answer:**
The company produced 600 units of Type A widgets and 400 units of Type B widgets.
