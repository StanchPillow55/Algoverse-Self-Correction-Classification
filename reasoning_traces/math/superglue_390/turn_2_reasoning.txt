==================================================

To solve the problem, we first need to understand what "Sample reasoning question 390" refers to. However, since the problem statement does not provide any specific details or context about "Sample reasoning question 390," I will demonstrate a general approach to solving a reasoning problem by creating a hypothetical example. 

Let's assume "Sample reasoning question 390" is a logic puzzle involving numbers. Here's a possible scenario:

**Hypothetical Problem:**
You have a sequence of numbers: 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, ... What is the 10th number in this sequence?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Identify the Pattern:**
   - Look at the sequence: 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, ...
   - Notice that each number is double the previous number.
   - This is a geometric sequence where each term is multiplied by 2 to get the next term.

2. **Determine the Formula:**
   - The first term \( a_1 \) is 2.
   - The common ratio \( r \) is 2.
   - The formula for the nth term of a geometric sequence is given by:
     \[
     a_n = a_1 \times r^{(n-1)}
     \]
   - Substitute the known values into the formula:
     \[
     a_n = 2 \times 2^{(n-1)}
     \]

3. **Calculate the 10th Term:**
   - We need to find \( a_{10} \).
   - Substitute \( n = 10 \) into the formula:
     \[
     a_{10} = 2 \times 2^{(10-1)}
     \]
     \[
     a_{10} = 2 \times 2^9
     \]
   - Calculate \( 2^9 \):
     \[
     2^9 = 512
     \]
   - Multiply by 2:
     \[
     a_{10} = 2 \times 512 = 1024
     \]

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The 10th number in the sequence is 1024.

**Final Answer:**
The 10th number in the sequence is 1024.

This example demonstrates how to approach a reasoning problem involving sequences by identifying patterns, deriving a formula, and calculating the desired term. If "Sample reasoning question 390" refers to a different type of problem, please provide additional details or context for a more accurate solution.
