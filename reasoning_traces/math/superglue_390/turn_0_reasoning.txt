==================================================

It seems like there might be a misunderstanding or a missing component in your request. "Sample reasoning question 390" doesn't provide enough information for me to solve a specific math problem. However, I can guide you through a generic process of solving a math problem by explaining the steps typically involved. If you have a specific math problem, please provide the details, and I'll be happy to help solve it.

Here's a general approach to solving a math problem:

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - Carefully read the problem statement.
   - Identify what is being asked.
   - Determine what information is given and what needs to be found.

2. **Devise a Plan:**
   - Consider possible strategies to solve the problem. This could include:
     - Drawing a diagram.
     - Writing an equation.
     - Breaking the problem into smaller parts.
     - Looking for patterns.

3. **Carry Out the Plan:**
   - Execute the chosen strategy step by step.
   - Perform calculations carefully.
   - Keep track of units and ensure consistency.

4. **Check Your Work:**
   - Verify each step of your solution.
   - Check if the final answer makes sense in the context of the problem.
   - Review calculations for any errors.

5. **State the Final Answer:**
   - Clearly write down the final answer.
   - Include units if applicable.

If you provide a specific math problem, I can apply this process to solve it and show all the work involved.
