==================================================

It seems like the problem statement is incomplete or unclear. "Sample reasoning question 390" doesn't provide enough information for me to solve a specific math problem. However, I can guide you through a general approach to solving math problems by explaining the steps typically involved in reasoning through a problem.

### General Approach to Solving Math Problems

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - Read the problem carefully.
   - Identify what is being asked.
   - Determine what information is given and what needs to be found.

2. **Devise a Plan:**
   - Consider possible strategies to solve the problem. This might include:
     - Drawing a diagram.
     - Writing an equation.
     - Breaking the problem into smaller parts.
     - Looking for patterns.
     - Using logical reasoning.

3. **Carry Out the Plan:**
   - Execute the chosen strategy step by step.
   - Perform calculations carefully.
   - Keep track of units and ensure consistency.

4. **Check Your Work:**
   - Review each step to ensure accuracy.
   - Verify that the solution makes sense in the context of the problem.
   - Check calculations for errors.

5. **State the Final Answer:**
   - Clearly present the solution.
   - Include units if applicable.
   - Ensure the answer addresses the question asked.

### Example Problem

Let's apply this approach to a simple example problem:

**Problem:** A rectangle has a length of 10 units and a width of 5 units. What is the area of the rectangle?

**Step 1: Understand the Problem**
- We need to find the area of a rectangle.
- We are given the length (10 units) and the width (5 units).

**Step 2: Devise a Plan**
- The area \( A \) of a rectangle is calculated using the formula:
  \[
  A = \text{length} \times \text{width}
  \]

**Step 3: Carry Out the Plan**
- Substitute the given values into the formula:
  \[
  A = 10 \times 5 = 50
  \]

**Step 4: Check Your Work**
- Verify the calculation:
  \[
  10 \times 5 = 50
  \]
- The units are consistent (units \(\times\) units = square units).

**Step 5: State the Final Answer**
- The area of the rectangle is 50 square units.
