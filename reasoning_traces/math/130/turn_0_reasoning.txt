==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to carefully track the number of seashells Ali has at each step of the process. Let's go through the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Number of Seashells:**
   Ali started with 180 seashells.

2. **Giving Away Seashells to Friends:**
   Ali gave away 40 seashells to his friends. To find out how many seashells he had after this, we subtract the 40 seashells from the initial amount:
   \[
   180 - 40 = 140
   \]
   So, Ali had 140 seashells after giving some to his friends.

3. **Giving Away Seashells to Brothers:**
   Ali then gave 30 seashells to his brothers. We subtract these 30 seashells from the current total:
   \[
   140 - 30 = 110
   \]
   After giving seashells to his brothers, Ali had 110 seashells left.

4. **Selling Half of the Remaining Seashells:**
   Ali sold half of the remaining seashells. To find out how many seashells he sold, we calculate half of 110:
   \[
   \frac{110}{2} = 55
   \]
   Ali sold 55 seashells.

5. **Calculating the Final Number of Seashells:**
   To find out how many seashells Ali had left after selling, we subtract the 55 seashells he sold from the 110 seashells he had before selling:
   \[
   110 - 55 = 55
   \]

Therefore, after all these transactions, Ali had 55 seashells left.

**Final Answer:**
Ali had 55 seashells left.
