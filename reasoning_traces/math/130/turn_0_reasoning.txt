==================================================

To solve the problem step by step, let's break it down into manageable parts.

1. **Starting Amount of Seashells**: 
   Ali starts with 180 seashells.

2. **Giving Away Seashells**:
   - First, he gives away 40 seashells to his friends.
   - Then, he gives away 30 seashells to his brothers.

   We need to calculate how many seashells he has after giving these away.

   \[
   \text{Seashells given away} = 40 + 30 = 70
   \]

   Now, we subtract the total seashells given away from the starting amount:

   \[
   \text{Remaining seashells} = 180 - 70 = 110
   \]

3. **Selling Half of the Remaining Seashells**:
   Now, Ali sells half of the remaining seashells. To find out how many seashells he sells, we calculate half of the remaining seashells:

   \[
   \text{Seashells sold} = \frac{110}{2} = 55
   \]

4. **Calculating Seashells Left**:
   Finally, we need to determine how many seashells Ali has left after selling half of them:

   \[
   \text{Seashells left} = 110 - 55 = 55
   \]

Thus, after going through all the steps, we find that the number of seashells Ali has left is:

\[
\boxed{55}
\]
