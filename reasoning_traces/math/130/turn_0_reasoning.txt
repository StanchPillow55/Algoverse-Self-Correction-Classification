==================================================

To solve the problem, we will follow the steps outlined in the question carefully.

1. **Determine the initial number of elves**: Nissa hires 60 seasonal workers to play elves.

   \[
   \text{Initial number of elves} = 60
   \]

2. **Calculate how many elves quit after the incident**: A third of the elves quit after children vomit on them. To find out how many elves this is, we need to calculate one third of 60.

   \[
   \text{Number of elves that quit} = \frac{1}{3} \times 60 = 20
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of elves remaining after the first incident**: We subtract the number of elves that quit from the initial number of elves.

   \[
   \text{Remaining elves after first incident} = 60 - 20 = 40
   \]

4. **Determine how many elves quit after the second incident**: After the first incident, 10 of the remaining elves quit after kids kick their shins.

5. **Calculate the number of elves remaining after the second incident**: We subtract the 10 elves that quit from the remaining 40 elves.

   \[
   \text{Remaining elves after second incident} = 40 - 10 = 30
   \]

6. **Final count of elves**: The final number of elves left after both incidents is 30.

Thus, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{30}
\]
