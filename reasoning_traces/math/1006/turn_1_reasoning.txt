==================================================

To determine the cost to fill the Smith family's swimming pool, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the volume of the pool in cubic feet.**
2. **Convert the volume from cubic feet to gallons.**
3. **Calculate the total cost to fill the pool based on the cost per gallon.**

### Step 1: Calculate the Volume of the Pool

The formula for the volume \( V \) of a rectangular prism (which is the shape of the pool) is given by:

\[
V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth}
\]

Given:
- Length = 25 feet
- Width = 14 feet
- Depth = 4 feet

Substituting the values into the formula:

\[
V = 25 \, \text{ft} \times 14 \, \text{ft} \times 4 \, \text{ft}
\]

Calculating the volume:

\[
V = 25 \times 14 = 350 \, \text{ft}^2
\]
\[
V = 350 \times 4 = 1400 \, \text{ft}^3
\]

So, the volume of the pool is **1400 cubic feet**.

### Step 2: Convert the Volume to Gallons

The problem states that we need to multiply the volume in cubic feet by 5.9 to find the volume in gallons:

\[
\text{Volume in gallons} = \text{Volume in cubic feet} \times 5.9
\]

Substituting the volume we calculated:

\[
\text{Volume in gallons} = 1400 \, \text{ft}^3 \times 5.9
\]

Calculating the volume in gallons:

\[
\text{Volume in gallons} = 1400 \times 5.9 = 8260 \, \text{gallons}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the Total Cost to Fill the Pool

The cost to fill the pool is given as $0.10 per gallon. Therefore, we can calculate the total cost \( C \) as follows:

\[
C = \text{Volume in gallons} \times \text{Cost per gallon}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
C = 8260 \, \text{gallons} \times 0.10 \, \text{dollars/gallon}
\]

Calculating the total cost:

\[
C = 8260 \times 0.10 = 826 \, \text{dollars}
\]

### Final Answer

The total cost to fill the Smith family's swimming pool is **$826**.
