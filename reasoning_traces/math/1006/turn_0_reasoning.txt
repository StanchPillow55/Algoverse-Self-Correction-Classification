To determine the cost to fill the Smith family's swimming pool, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the volume of the pool in cubic feet.**
   The formula for the volume \( V \) of a rectangular prism (which is the shape of the pool) is given by:
   \[
   V = \text{length} \times \text{width} \times \text{depth}
   \]
   Given:
   - Length = 25 feet
   - Width = 14 feet
   - Depth = 4 feet

   Plugging in the values:
   \[
   V = 25 \, \text{ft} \times 14 \, \text{ft} \times 4 \, \text{ft}
   \]

   First, calculate \( 25 \times 14 \):
   \[
   25 \times 14 = 350 \, \text{ft}^2
   \]

   Now multiply by the depth:
   \[
   V = 350 \, \text{ft}^2 \times 4 \, \text{ft} = 1400 \, \text{ft}^3
   \]

2. **Convert the volume from cubic feet to gallons.**
   The pool company instructed the Smith family to multiply the volume in cubic feet by 5.9 to find the volume in gallons:
   \[
   \text{Volume in gallons} = 1400 \, \text{ft}^3 \times 5.9
   \]

   Performing the multiplication:
   \[
   1400 \times 5.9 = 8260 \, \text{gallons}
   \]

3. **Calculate the cost to fill the pool.**
   The cost to fill the pool is $0.10 per gallon. Therefore, the total cost \( C \) can be calculated as:
   \[
   C = \text{Volume in gallons} \times \text{Cost per gallon}
   \]
   Substituting the values:
   \[
   C = 8260 \, \text{gallons} \times 0.10 \, \text{dollars/gallon}
   \]

   Performing the multiplication:
   \[
   C = 8260 \times 0.10 = 826 \, \text{dollars}
   \]

4. **Final answer:**
   The total cost to fill the Smith family's swimming pool is:
   \[
   \boxed{826 \text{ dollars}}
   \]
