==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to determine the total number of glasses broken by both David and William.

1. **Identify the number of glasses broken by David:**
   - According to the problem, David broke 2 glasses.

2. **Determine the number of glasses broken by William:**
   - The problem states that William broke 4 times the number of glasses that David broke.
   - Since David broke 2 glasses, we calculate the number of glasses William broke as follows:
     \[
     \text{Number of glasses William broke} = 4 \times (\text{Number of glasses David broke})
     \]
     \[
     \text{Number of glasses William broke} = 4 \times 2 = 8
     \]

3. **Calculate the total number of glasses broken:**
   - To find the total number of glasses broken by both David and William, we add the number of glasses each of them broke:
     \[
     \text{Total number of glasses broken} = (\text{Number of glasses David broke}) + (\text{Number of glasses William broke})
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total number of glasses broken} = 2 + 8 = 10
     \]

Thus, the total number of glasses broken is 10.

**Final Answer: 10 glasses were broken.**
