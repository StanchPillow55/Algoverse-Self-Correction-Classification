==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to determine the total number of glasses broken by both David and William.

1. **Identify the number of glasses David broke:**
   - According to the problem, David broke 2 glasses.

2. **Calculate the number of glasses William broke:**
   - The problem states that William broke 4 times the number of glasses that David broke.
   - Since David broke 2 glasses, we can calculate the number of glasses William broke as follows:
     \[
     \text{Number of glasses William broke} = 4 \times \text{Number of glasses David broke} = 4 \times 2
     \]
   - Performing the multiplication:
     \[
     4 \times 2 = 8
     \]
   - Therefore, William broke 8 glasses.

3. **Calculate the total number of glasses broken:**
   - Now, we need to find the total number of glasses broken by both David and William. We do this by adding the number of glasses broken by each:
     \[
     \text{Total glasses broken} = \text{Glasses broken by David} + \text{Glasses broken by William}
     \]
   - Substituting the values we found:
     \[
     \text{Total glasses broken} = 2 + 8
     \]
   - Performing the addition:
     \[
     2 + 8 = 10
     \]

4. **Final answer:**
   - The total number of glasses broken at the party is \( \boxed{10} \).
