To find out how much Alison spent on athletic gear, we will break down the costs of each item she purchased step by step.

1. **Cost of the tank top**: 
   - Alison bought a tank top for **$10**.

2. **Cost of the running shorts**: 
   - The running shorts cost **$5 more** than the tank top.
   - Therefore, the cost of the running shorts is:
     \[
     10 + 5 = 15 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Cost of the tennis shoes**: 
   - The original price of the tennis shoes is **$48**.
   - They were on sale for **half price**. So, we calculate half of $48:
     \[
     \frac{48}{2} = 24 \text{ dollars}
     \]

4. **Cost of the athletic socks**: 
   - The package of athletic socks costs **$8**.
   - Alison has a coupon for **$2 off**. Therefore, the cost of the socks after applying the coupon is:
     \[
     8 - 2 = 6 \text{ dollars}
     \]

5. **Total cost of all items**: 
   - Now we will add up the costs of all the items:
     - Cost of tank top: $10
     - Cost of running shorts: $15
     - Cost of tennis shoes: $24
     - Cost of athletic socks: $6
   - The total cost is:
     \[
     10 + 15 + 24 + 6
     \]

   Let's calculate this step by step:
   - First, add the cost of the tank top and running shorts:
     \[
     10 + 15 = 25
     \]
   - Next, add the cost of the tennis shoes:
     \[
     25 + 24 = 49
     \]
   - Finally, add the cost of the athletic socks:
     \[
     49 + 6 = 55
     \]

Thus, the total amount Alison spent on athletic gear is **$55**.

**Final Answer**: Alison spent **$55** on athletic gear.
