==================================================

To solve this problem, I'll need more specific information about "Sample reasoning question 9" as it appears to be a placeholder or reference to a specific question that isn't provided here. However, I can guide you through a general approach to solving reasoning problems in mathematics.

### General Approach to Solving Math Reasoning Problems:

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - Carefully read the problem statement.
   - Identify what is being asked.
   - Determine what information is given and what needs to be found.

2. **Devise a Plan:**
   - Consider possible strategies to solve the problem. This could include drawing diagrams, creating equations, or breaking the problem into smaller parts.
   - Choose the strategy that seems most appropriate for the problem.

3. **Carry Out the Plan:**
   - Execute the chosen strategy step by step.
   - Perform calculations carefully and check each step for accuracy.
   - Keep track of units and ensure consistency throughout the problem.

4. **Review/Check Your Work:**
   - Once a solution is found, review each step to ensure no mistakes were made.
   - Verify that the solution makes sense in the context of the problem.
   - Consider whether there might be alternative solutions or methods.

5. **State the Final Answer:**
   - Clearly present the final answer, ensuring it addresses the question posed.
   - Include units if applicable and ensure the answer is in the simplest form.

### Example Problem and Solution:

Let's apply this approach to a sample problem:

**Problem:** A rectangle has a length that is twice its width. If the perimeter of the rectangle is 36 units, what are the dimensions of the rectangle?

**Step 1: Understand the Problem**
- We need to find the length and width of the rectangle.
- We know the perimeter is 36 units and the length is twice the width.

**Step 2: Devise a Plan**
- Use the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle: \( P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width}) \).
- Let the width be \( w \) and the length be \( 2w \).

**Step 3: Carry Out the Plan**
- Substitute the expressions for length and width into the perimeter formula:
  \[
  36 = 2 \times (2w + w)
  \]
- Simplify and solve for \( w \):
  \[
  36 = 2 \times 3w
  \]
  \[
  36 = 6w
  \]
  \[
  w = \frac{36}{6} = 6
  \]
- Now find the length:
  \[
  \text{Length} = 2w = 2 \times 6 = 12
  \]

**Step 4: Review/Check Your Work**
- Check the calculations:
  - Width = 6, Length = 12
  - Perimeter = \( 2 \times (12 + 6) = 2 \times 18 = 36 \), which matches the given perimeter.

**Step 5: State the Final Answer**
- The dimensions of the rectangle are: Width = 6 units, Length = 12 units.
