==================================================

To solve "Sample reasoning question 9," we need to first understand the problem. However, since the problem statement is not provided, I'll guide you through a generic approach to solving a math problem:

### Step 1: Understand the Problem
- **Identify what is being asked.** Determine the unknowns and what you need to find.
- **Identify the given information.** List all the data and conditions provided in the problem.

### Step 2: Devise a Plan
- **Choose a strategy.** Depending on the type of problem, you might use algebra, geometry, calculus, or another area of mathematics.
- **Consider similar problems.** Think about how you have solved similar problems in the past.

### Step 3: Carry Out the Plan
- **Execute your chosen strategy.** Perform calculations carefully, step by step.
- **Show all work.** Write down each step of your calculations to avoid mistakes and to make it easier to review.

### Step 4: Review/Check Your Work
- **Verify each step.** Ensure that each part of your solution is correct.
- **Check your final answer.** Make sure it makes sense in the context of the problem.

### Example Problem
Since I don't have the specific details of "Sample reasoning question 9," let's consider a simple example problem:

**Example Problem:** Solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).

#### Step 1: Understand the Problem
- We need to find the value of \( x \).
- We are given the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).

#### Step 2: Devise a Plan
- We will use basic algebra to isolate \( x \).

#### Step 3: Carry Out the Plan
1. Start with the equation:  
   \[
   2x + 3 = 11
   \]
2. Subtract 3 from both sides to isolate the term with \( x \):  
   \[
   2x + 3 - 3 = 11 - 3
   \]
   \[
   2x = 8
   \]
3. Divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( x \):  
   \[
   \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{8}{2}
   \]
   \[
   x = 4
   \]

#### Step 4: Review/Check Your Work
- Substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation to verify:  
  \[
  2(4) + 3 = 8 + 3 = 11
  \]
- The left side equals the right side, confirming our solution is correct.

### Final Answer
The solution to the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \) is \( x = 4 \).
