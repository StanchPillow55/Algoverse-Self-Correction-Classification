==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 9" entails. Since the problem statement is not specific, I'll assume it's a generic math problem that requires logical reasoning and step-by-step calculations. Let's consider a hypothetical math problem and solve it.

**Hypothetical Problem:**

A train travels from City A to City B, a distance of 300 miles. The train travels the first 100 miles at a speed of 50 miles per hour, the next 100 miles at a speed of 60 miles per hour, and the final 100 miles at a speed of 75 miles per hour. Calculate the total time taken for the journey.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Calculate the time taken for each segment of the journey:**

   - **First Segment:**
     - Distance = 100 miles
     - Speed = 50 miles per hour
     - Time = Distance / Speed = 100 miles / 50 miles per hour = 2 hours

   - **Second Segment:**
     - Distance = 100 miles
     - Speed = 60 miles per hour
     - Time = Distance / Speed = 100 miles / 60 miles per hour = 1.6667 hours (approximately 1 hour and 40 minutes)

   - **Third Segment:**
     - Distance = 100 miles
     - Speed = 75 miles per hour
     - Time = Distance / Speed = 100 miles / 75 miles per hour = 1.3333 hours (approximately 1 hour and 20 minutes)

2. **Calculate the total time taken for the entire journey:**

   - Total Time = Time for First Segment + Time for Second Segment + Time for Third Segment
   - Total Time = 2 hours + 1.6667 hours + 1.3333 hours
   - Total Time = 5 hours

3. **Final Answer:**

The total time taken for the train to travel from City A to City B is 5 hours.

This solution involves breaking down the problem into manageable parts, calculating the time for each segment of the journey, and then summing these times to find the total time. This methodical approach ensures that all aspects of the problem are considered and calculated accurately.
