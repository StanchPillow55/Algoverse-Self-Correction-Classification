==================================================

To solve the problem, let's first understand what is being asked. Unfortunately, the question "Sample reasoning question 251" does not provide specific details or numbers to work with. Therefore, I will need to make some assumptions or create a hypothetical problem to demonstrate the process of solving a math problem step by step.

Let's assume "Sample reasoning question 251" is a typical math problem involving algebra. Here's a hypothetical problem:

**Problem:**
Solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 3x + 5 = 20 \).

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Equation:**
   The equation given is \( 3x + 5 = 20 \). This is a linear equation in one variable, \( x \).

2. **Isolate the Variable:**
   To solve for \( x \), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We can do this by performing inverse operations.

3. **Subtract 5 from Both Sides:**
   To eliminate the constant term on the left side, subtract 5 from both sides of the equation:
   \[
   3x + 5 - 5 = 20 - 5
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   3x = 15
   \]

4. **Divide by 3:**
   Now, divide both sides by 3 to solve for \( x \):
   \[
   \frac{3x}{3} = \frac{15}{3}
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   x = 5
   \]

5. **Verify the Solution:**
   Substitute \( x = 5 \) back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies the equation:
   \[
   3(5) + 5 = 20
   \]
   Simplifying the left side gives:
   \[
   15 + 5 = 20
   \]
   \[
   20 = 20
   \]
   Since both sides of the equation are equal, the solution \( x = 5 \) is verified.

**Final Answer:**
The solution to the equation \( 3x + 5 = 20 \) is \( x = 5 \).

This step-by-step approach demonstrates how to solve a basic algebraic equation by isolating the variable, performing arithmetic operations, and verifying the solution. If you have a specific problem or more details for "Sample reasoning question 251," please provide them, and I can tailor the solution accordingly.
