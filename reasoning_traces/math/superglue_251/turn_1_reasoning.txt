Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 251" entails. Since the problem statement is not provided, I'll demonstrate a general approach to solving a typical math problem, which involves understanding the problem, devising a plan, carrying out the plan, and then reviewing the solution.

### Step 1: Understand the Problem

Without specific details, let's assume "Sample reasoning question 251" is a typical math problem involving algebra, geometry, or arithmetic. The first step is to carefully read the problem statement (which we don't have) and identify what is being asked. Key elements to look for include:

- What are the known quantities?
- What are the unknowns?
- What is the relationship between the knowns and unknowns?

### Step 2: Devise a Plan

Once we understand the problem, the next step is to devise a plan. Common strategies include:

- Drawing a diagram if it's a geometry problem.
- Setting up equations if it's an algebra problem.
- Breaking the problem into smaller, more manageable parts.

### Step 3: Carry Out the Plan

This step involves executing the plan. Here are some general techniques:

- **Algebra**: Solve equations by isolating variables, using substitution, or applying the quadratic formula if necessary.
- **Geometry**: Use properties of shapes, the Pythagorean theorem, or trigonometric identities.
- **Arithmetic**: Perform calculations carefully, ensuring to follow the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS).

### Step 4: Review the Solution

Finally, we review the solution to ensure it makes sense and answers the question posed. Check calculations for errors and verify that the solution is reasonable given the context of the problem.

### Example Problem

Since we don't have the specific problem, let's solve a simple algebra problem as an example:

**Problem**: Solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).

**Solution**:

1. **Understand the Problem**: We need to find the value of \( x \) that satisfies the equation.

2. **Devise a Plan**: Isolate \( x \) by performing inverse operations.

3. **Carry Out the Plan**:
   \[
   2x + 3 = 11
   \]
   Subtract 3 from both sides:
   \[
   2x = 8
   \]
   Divide both sides by 2:
   \[
   x = 4
   \]

4. **Review the Solution**: Substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation to verify:
   \[
   2(4) + 3 = 8 + 3 = 11
   \]
   The solution is correct.

**Final Answer**: \( x = 4 \)

This example illustrates the general approach to solving a math problem. If you have a specific problem in mind, please provide the details, and I can offer a more tailored solution.
