==================================================

To solve the problem, I need more specific information about "Sample reasoning question 251." Since the question isn't provided, I'll demonstrate how to approach a generic math problem by solving an example problem. Let's consider the following problem:

**Example Problem:**

A farmer has a rectangular field that is 100 meters long and 60 meters wide. He wants to build a fence around the field and also divide the field into two equal smaller rectangular fields by adding a fence parallel to the shorter side. How much fencing material does he need in total?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We have a rectangular field with dimensions 100 meters (length) and 60 meters (width).
   - We need to calculate the total length of fencing required to enclose the entire field and divide it into two equal parts.

2. **Calculate the Perimeter of the Field:**
   - The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula:
     \[
     P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width})
     \]
   - Substitute the given dimensions:
     \[
     P = 2 \times (100 + 60) = 2 \times 160 = 320 \text{ meters}
     \]
   - This is the fencing required to enclose the entire field.

3. **Divide the Field into Two Equal Parts:**
   - The field is divided into two smaller rectangles by a fence parallel to the shorter side (width).
   - This means we add a fence along the length of the field, which is 100 meters.

4. **Calculate the Total Fencing Required:**
   - Total fencing = Perimeter of the field + Additional fence to divide the field
   - Total fencing = 320 meters + 100 meters = 420 meters

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The farmer needs a total of 420 meters of fencing material.

**Final Answer:**
The farmer needs 420 meters of fencing material in total.
