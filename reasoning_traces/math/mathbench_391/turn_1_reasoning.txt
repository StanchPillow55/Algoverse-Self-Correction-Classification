==================================================

Certainly! However, it seems like "Sample math problem 391" is not a specific math problem but rather a placeholder or reference. To assist you effectively, I'll need a specific math problem to work through. Could you please provide the details of the math problem you would like me to solve? Once you do, I'll be happy to show all the work and reasoning step by step.
