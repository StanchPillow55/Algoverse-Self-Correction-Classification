==================================================

To solve "Sample math problem 391," we need to first understand what the problem is asking. Since the problem is not explicitly stated, let's assume a hypothetical math problem and solve it step by step. 

Let's assume the problem is:

**Problem:** Solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).

**Step 1: Understand the Equation**

The equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \) is a linear equation in one variable, \( x \). Our goal is to isolate \( x \) on one side of the equation to find its value.

**Step 2: Isolate the Variable**

To isolate \( x \), we need to perform operations that will leave \( x \) by itself on one side of the equation.

1. **Subtract 3 from both sides:**

   \[
   2x + 3 - 3 = 11 - 3
   \]

   Simplifying both sides gives:

   \[
   2x = 8
   \]

2. **Divide both sides by 2:**

   \[
   \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{8}{2}
   \]

   Simplifying both sides gives:

   \[
   x = 4
   \]

**Step 3: Verify the Solution**

To ensure our solution is correct, we substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation:

\[
2(4) + 3 = 11
\]

Simplifying the left side:

\[
8 + 3 = 11
\]

Since both sides of the equation are equal, our solution \( x = 4 \) is verified.

**Final Answer:**

The solution to the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \) is \( x = 4 \).
