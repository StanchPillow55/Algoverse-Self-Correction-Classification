Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to determine how many additional flowering plants Pat needs to buy to fill her flower bed, and then calculate the total cost of those plants.

### Step 1: Convert Measurements
First, we need to convert all measurements to the same unit. The flower bed is 111 feet long, and the spacing between plants is given in feet. 

- The flower bed length is already in feet: **111 feet**.
- The width of each flower is given as 12 inches. We convert this to feet:
  \[
  12 \text{ inches} = \frac{12}{12} \text{ feet} = 1 \text{ foot}
  \]

### Step 2: Calculate the Space Required for Each Plant
Each plant occupies a width of 1 foot, and Pat wants to leave 1.5 feet between each plant. Therefore, the total space occupied by each plant, including the space between them, is:
\[
\text{Space per plant} = \text{Width of plant} + \text{Space between plants} = 1 \text{ foot} + 1.5 \text{ feet} = 2.5 \text{ feet}
\]

### Step 3: Determine the Number of Plants that Fit in the Flower Bed
To find out how many plants can fit in the flower bed, we divide the total length of the flower bed by the space required for each plant:
\[
\text{Number of plants} = \frac{\text{Length of flower bed}}{\text{Space per plant}} = \frac{111 \text{ feet}}{2.5 \text{ feet}} = 44.4
\]
Since Pat cannot plant a fraction of a plant, we round down to the nearest whole number:
\[
\text{Number of plants that can fit} = 44
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the Number of Additional Plants Needed
Pat already owns 17 flowers. Therefore, the number of additional plants she needs to buy is:
\[
\text{Additional plants needed} = \text{Total plants needed} - \text{Plants owned} = 44 - 17 = 27
\]

### Step 5: Calculate the Total Cost of Additional Plants
Each flowering plant costs $6. Therefore, the total cost for the additional plants is:
\[
\text{Total cost} = \text{Additional plants needed} \times \text{Cost per plant} = 27 \times 6 = 162
\]

### Final Answer
Pat will spend **$162** at the store to fill up her flower bed.
