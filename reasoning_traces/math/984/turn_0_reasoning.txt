To solve the problem, we need to determine how many additional flowering plants Pat needs to buy to fill her flower bed, and then calculate the total cost for those plants.

### Step 1: Convert Measurements
First, we need to ensure all measurements are in the same units. The flower bed is 111 feet long, and the width of each flower is given in inches. 

1. **Convert the width of the flower from inches to feet:**
   \[
   12 \text{ inches} = \frac{12}{12} = 1 \text{ foot}
   \]

### Step 2: Determine the Space Required for Each Plant
Each plant occupies its width plus the space needed between plants. Since each flower is 1 foot wide and there is a 1.5 feet gap between each plant, the total space required for each plant is:
\[
\text{Space per plant} = \text{Width of plant} + \text{Space between plants} = 1 \text{ foot} + 1.5 \text{ feet} = 2.5 \text{ feet}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the Number of Plants that Fit in the Flower Bed
Now, we can calculate how many plants can fit in the 111 feet long flower bed. We divide the total length of the flower bed by the space required for each plant:
\[
\text{Number of plants that fit} = \frac{\text{Length of flower bed}}{\text{Space per plant}} = \frac{111 \text{ feet}}{2.5 \text{ feet}} = 44.4
\]
Since Pat cannot plant a fraction of a plant, we round down to the nearest whole number:
\[
\text{Number of plants that fit} = 44
\]

### Step 4: Determine How Many Additional Plants Pat Needs
Pat already owns 17 flowers, so we need to find out how many more plants she needs to buy:
\[
\text{Additional plants needed} = \text{Total plants needed} - \text{Plants owned} = 44 - 17 = 27
\]

### Step 5: Calculate the Total Cost for Additional Plants
Each flowering plant costs $6. Therefore, the total cost for the additional plants is:
\[
\text{Total cost} = \text{Additional plants needed} \times \text{Cost per plant} = 27 \times 6 = 162
\]

### Final Answer
Pat will spend a total of **$162** at the store to fill up her flower bed.
