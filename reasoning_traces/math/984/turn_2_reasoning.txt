Question ID: 984
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To determine how much money Pat will spend at the store to fill her flower bed, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Convert the flower bed length from feet to inches**: 
   Since the width of the flowers is given in inches, we will convert the length of the flower bed from feet to inches. There are 12 inches in a foot, so:
   \[
   111 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 1332 \text{ inches}
   \]

2. **Calculate the space taken by each flower**: 
   Each flower has a width of 12 inches, and Pat needs to leave 1.5 feet (which is 18 inches) between each flower. Therefore, the total space taken by each flower including the space between them is:
   \[
   12 \text{ inches (flower width)} + 18 \text{ inches (space)} = 30 \text{ inches}
   \]

3. **Determine how many flowers can fit in the flower bed**: 
   To find out how many flowers can fit in the flower bed, we divide the total length of the flower bed in inches by the total space taken by each flower:
   \[
   \frac{1332 \text{ inches}}{30 \text{ inches/flower}} = 44.4
   \]
   Since Pat cannot plant a fraction of a flower, we round down to the nearest whole number, which is 44 flowers.

4. **Calculate how many additional flowers Pat needs to buy**: 
   Pat already owns 17 flowers, so we need to find out how many more flowers she needs to buy:
   \[
   44 \text{ flowers needed} - 17 \text{ flowers owned} = 27 \text{ flowers to buy}
   \]

5. **Calculate the total cost of the flowers**: 
   Each flowering plant costs $6, so the total cost for the 27 flowers is:
   \[
   27 \text{ flowers} \times 6 \text{ dollars/flower} = 162 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Thus, the total amount of money Pat will spend at the store to fill up her flower bed is:
\[
\boxed{162}
\]
