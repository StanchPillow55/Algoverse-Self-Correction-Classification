==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 44," we need to first understand what the problem is asking. However, the problem statement is incomplete as it only says "Sample math problem 44" without providing any specific details or numbers. Therefore, I will demonstrate how to approach a generic math problem by creating a hypothetical problem and solving it step by step.

Let's assume "Sample math problem 44" is a problem involving solving a quadratic equation. Here's a hypothetical problem:

**Problem:**
Solve the quadratic equation \(2x^2 - 4x - 6 = 0\).

**Step-by-step Solution:**

1. **Identify the standard form of a quadratic equation:**
   A quadratic equation is generally in the form \(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\). In this case, \(a = 2\), \(b = -4\), and \(c = -6\).

2. **Use the quadratic formula:**
   The quadratic formula to find the roots of \(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\) is:
   \[
   x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
   \]

3. **Calculate the discriminant (\(b^2 - 4ac\)):**
   \[
   b^2 - 4ac = (-4)^2 - 4 \times 2 \times (-6)
   \]
   \[
   = 16 + 48
   \]
   \[
   = 64
   \]

4. **Calculate the roots using the quadratic formula:**
   Since the discriminant is positive, there will be two real and distinct roots.
   \[
   x = \frac{-(-4) \pm \sqrt{64}}{2 \times 2}
   \]
   \[
   = \frac{4 \pm 8}{4}
   \]

5. **Find the two solutions:**
   - First root:
     \[
     x_1 = \frac{4 + 8}{4} = \frac{12}{4} = 3
     \]
   - Second root:
     \[
     x_2 = \frac{4 - 8}{4} = \frac{-4}{4} = -1
     \]

6. **Verify the solutions:**
   Substitute \(x = 3\) and \(x = -1\) back into the original equation to ensure they satisfy it.
   - For \(x = 3\):
     \[
     2(3)^2 - 4(3) - 6 = 18 - 12 - 6 = 0
     \]
   - For \(x = -1\):
     \[
     2(-1)^2 - 4(-1) - 6 = 2 + 4 - 6 = 0
     \]

Both solutions satisfy the original equation, confirming they are correct.

**Final Answer:**
The solutions to the quadratic equation \(2x^2 - 4x - 6 = 0\) are \(x = 3\) and \(x = -1\).
