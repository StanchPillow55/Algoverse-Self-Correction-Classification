To solve the problem, we need to determine the ages of Omi, Kimiko, and Arlette based on the information provided.

1. **Determine Kimiko's Age**:
   - We know from the problem that Kimiko is 28 years old.

2. **Calculate Omi's Age**:
   - The problem states that Omi is twice as old as Kimiko.
   - Therefore, Omi's age can be calculated as:
     \[
     \text{Omi's age} = 2 \times \text{Kimiko's age} = 2 \times 28 = 56 \text{ years old}
     \]

3. **Calculate Arlette's Age**:
   - The problem states that Arlette is \( \frac{3}{4} \) times as old as Kimiko.
   - Therefore, Arlette's age can be calculated as:
     \[
     \text{Arlette's age} = \frac{3}{4} \times \text{Kimiko's age} = \frac{3}{4} \times 28
     \]
   - To perform the multiplication:
     \[
     \frac{3}{4} \times 28 = \frac{3 \times 28}{4} = \frac{84}{4} = 21 \text{ years old}
     \]

4. **Calculate the Average Age**:
   - Now that we have the ages of all three individuals:
     - Kimiko: 28 years
     - Omi: 56 years
     - Arlette: 21 years
   - We can calculate the average age using the formula for the average:
     \[
     \text{Average age} = \frac{\text{Sum of ages}}{\text{Number of individuals}} = \frac{28 + 56 + 21}{3}
     \]
   - First, calculate the sum of the ages:
     \[
     28 + 56 + 21 = 105
     \]
   - Now, divide by the number of individuals (which is 3):
     \[
     \text{Average age} = \frac{105}{3} = 35
     \]

5. **Final Answer**:
   - The average age of Omi, Kimiko, and Arlette is \( \boxed{35} \) years.
