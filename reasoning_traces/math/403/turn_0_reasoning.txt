To solve this problem, we need to determine the ages of Omi, Kimiko, and Arlette, and then calculate their average age.

**Step 1: Determine the ages of Omi, Kimiko, and Arlette.**

1. **Kimiko's Age:**
   - We are given that Kimiko is 28 years old.

2. **Omi's Age:**
   - Omi is twice as old as Kimiko.
   - Therefore, Omi's age is calculated as:
     \[
     \text{Omi's age} = 2 \times \text{Kimiko's age} = 2 \times 28 = 56 \text{ years old}
     \]

3. **Arlette's Age:**
   - Arlette is \(\frac{3}{4}\) times as old as Kimiko.
   - Therefore, Arlette's age is calculated as:
     \[
     \text{Arlette's age} = \frac{3}{4} \times \text{Kimiko's age} = \frac{3}{4} \times 28 = 21 \text{ years old}
     \]

**Step 2: Calculate the average age of the three individuals.**

To find the average age, we sum the ages of Omi, Kimiko, and Arlette and then divide by the number of individuals, which is 3.

- Sum of their ages:
  \[
  \text{Sum of ages} = \text{Omi's age} + \text{Kimiko's age} + \text{Arlette's age} = 56 + 28 + 21 = 105
  \]

- Average age:
  \[
  \text{Average age} = \frac{\text{Sum of ages}}{3} = \frac{105}{3} = 35
  \]

**Final Answer:**

The average age of Omi, Kimiko, and Arlette is 35 years old.
