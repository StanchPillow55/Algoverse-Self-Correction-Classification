==================================================

To determine how much Cynthia will spend on ice cream after 60 days, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of servings Cynthia will eat in 60 days.**
   - Since Cynthia eats one serving of ice cream every night, in 60 days, she will eat:
     \[
     \text{Total servings} = 60 \text{ servings}
     \]

2. **Determine how many cartons of ice cream she needs to buy.**
   - Each carton contains 15 servings of ice cream. To find out how many cartons she needs, we divide the total number of servings by the number of servings per carton:
     \[
     \text{Number of cartons} = \frac{\text{Total servings}}{\text{Servings per carton}} = \frac{60}{15} = 4 \text{ cartons}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total cost of the ice cream.**
   - Each carton costs $4.00. Therefore, the total cost for 4 cartons is:
     \[
     \text{Total cost} = \text{Number of cartons} \times \text{Cost per carton} = 4 \times 4.00 = 16.00
     \]

4. **State the final answer.**
   - After 60 days, Cynthia will spend a total of:
     \[
     \boxed{16.00}
     \]
   - Thus, the final answer is $16.00.
