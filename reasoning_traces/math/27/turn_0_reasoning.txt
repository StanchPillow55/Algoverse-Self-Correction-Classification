Question ID: 27
Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to find out how many files Brennan deleted from the first batch of 800 files. We know that he deleted 70% of them, so we calculate 70% of 800:

70/100 * 800 = 560 files

So, Brennan deleted 560 files from the first batch. To find out how many files he kept, we subtract the number of deleted files from the total number of downloaded files:

800 - 560 = 240 files

Next, we need to find out how many files Brennan deleted from the second batch of 400 files. We know that he deleted 3/5 of them, so we calculate 3/5 of 400:

3/5 * 400 = 240 files

So, Brennan deleted 240 files from the second batch. To find out how many files he kept, we subtract the number of deleted files from the total number of downloaded files:

400 - 240 = 160 files

Finally, to find out how many valuable files Brennan was left with in total, we add the number of files he kept from the first batch to the number of files he kept from the second batch:

240 + 160 = 400 files

So, Brennan was left with 400 valuable files after deleting the unrelated files he downloaded in the second round.
