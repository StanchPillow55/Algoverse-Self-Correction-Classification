==================================================

To solve the problem, we will break it down into steps, calculating the number of valuable files Brennan has after each round of downloads and deletions.

### Step 1: Initial Download and Deletion

1. **Initial Files Downloaded**: Brennan downloaded 800 files.
2. **Files Deleted**: He deleted 70% of these files.
   - To find out how many files he deleted, we calculate:
     \[
     \text{Files Deleted} = 0.70 \times 800 = 560
     \]
3. **Valuable Files Remaining**: The number of files left after deletion is:
   \[
   \text{Valuable Files} = 800 - 560 = 240
   \]

### Step 2: Second Download and Deletion

1. **Second Round of Downloads**: Brennan downloaded 400 more files.
2. **Files Deleted from Second Download**: He realized that 3/5 of these files were irrelevant.
   - To find out how many files he deleted from the second download, we calculate:
     \[
     \text{Files Deleted} = \frac{3}{5} \times 400 = 240
     \]
3. **Valuable Files from Second Download**: The number of valuable files from the second download is:
   \[
   \text{Valuable Files from Second Download} = 400 - 240 = 160
   \]

### Step 3: Total Valuable Files

Now, we combine the valuable files from both rounds of downloads:
\[
\text{Total Valuable Files} = \text{Valuable Files from First Download} + \text{Valuable Files from Second Download}
\]
Substituting the values we calculated:
\[
\text{Total Valuable Files} = 240 + 160 = 400
\]

### Final Answer

After deleting the unrelated files from both rounds of downloads, Brennan is left with a total of **400 valuable files**.
