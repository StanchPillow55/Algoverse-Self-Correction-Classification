Question ID: 823
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step, calculating the points scored by Sasha and Julie in both games.

1. **First Game:**
   - Sasha scored 14 points.
   - Julie scored 4 fewer points than Sasha. Therefore, we can calculate Julie's score as follows:
     \[
     \text{Julie's score} = \text{Sasha's score} - 4 = 14 - 4 = 10 \text{ points}
     \]

2. **Second Game:**
   - In the second game, Sasha scored 6 fewer points than Julie's score in the first game. We already know that Julie scored 10 points in the first game. Thus, we can calculate Sasha's score in the second game as follows:
     \[
     \text{Sasha's score in the second game} = \text{Julie's score in the first game} - 6 = 10 - 6 = 4 \text{ points}
     \]

3. **Total Points Scored by Sasha:**
   - Now, we will add the points Sasha scored in both games to find the total:
     \[
     \text{Total points scored by Sasha} = \text{Sasha's score in the first game} + \text{Sasha's score in the second game}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total points scored by Sasha} = 14 + 4 = 18 \text{ points}
     \]

Thus, the total points that Sasha scored during both games is \( \boxed{18} \).
