Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step, calculating the scores for both Sasha and Julie in each game.

### Step 1: Determine Julie's score in the first game.

We know that Sasha scored 14 points in the first game. Julie scored 4 fewer points than Sasha. Therefore, we can calculate Julie's score as follows:

\[
\text{Julie's score in the first game} = \text{Sasha's score} - 4
\]
\[
\text{Julie's score in the first game} = 14 - 4 = 10
\]

### Step 2: Determine Sasha's score in the second game.

In the second game, Sasha scored 6 fewer points than Julie's score in the first game. We already calculated Julie's score in the first game to be 10 points. Thus, we can find Sasha's score in the second game:

\[
\text{Sasha's score in the second game} = \text{Julie's score in the first game} - 6
\]
\[
\text{Sasha's score in the second game} = 10 - 6 = 4
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the total points scored by Sasha in both games.

Now that we have both of Sasha's scores, we can find the total points she scored during both games:

\[
\text{Total points scored by Sasha} = \text{Sasha's score in the first game} + \text{Sasha's score in the second game}
\]
\[
\text{Total points scored by Sasha} = 14 + 4 = 18
\]

### Final Answer

Sasha scored a total of **18 points** during both games.
