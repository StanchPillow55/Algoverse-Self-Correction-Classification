Question ID: 823
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to determine the total points that Sasha scored during both games. We will break down the information given step by step.

1. **First Game:**
   - Sasha scored 14 points.
   - Julie scored 4 fewer points than Sasha. 
   - To find Julie's score, we calculate:
     \[
     \text{Julie's score} = \text{Sasha's score} - 4 = 14 - 4 = 10 \text{ points}
     \]

2. **Second Game:**
   - In the second game, Sasha scored 6 fewer points than Julie's score in the first game.
   - We already calculated that Julie scored 10 points in the first game.
   - Therefore, Sasha's score in the second game is:
     \[
     \text{Sasha's score in second game} = \text{Julie's score in first game} - 6 = 10 - 6 = 4 \text{ points}
     \]

3. **Total Points Scored by Sasha:**
   - Now we need to find the total points Sasha scored during both games. We add Sasha's scores from both games:
     \[
     \text{Total points scored by Sasha} = \text{Sasha's score in first game} + \text{Sasha's score in second game} = 14 + 4 = 18 \text{ points}
     \]

Thus, the total points that Sasha scored during both games is \( \boxed{18} \).
