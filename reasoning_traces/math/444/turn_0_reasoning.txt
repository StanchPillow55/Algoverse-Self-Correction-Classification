==================================================

To determine how many points Reggie loses by in the basketball shooting contest, we need to calculate the total points scored by both Reggie and his brother.

**Step 1: Calculate Reggie's Points**

Reggie makes:
- 3 layups (worth 1 point each)
- 2 free throws (worth 2 points each)
- 1 long shot (worth 3 points)

Now, we calculate the points for each type of shot:

1. Points from layups:
   \[
   3 \text{ layups} \times 1 \text{ point/layup} = 3 \text{ points}
   \]

2. Points from free throws:
   \[
   2 \text{ free throws} \times 2 \text{ points/free throw} = 4 \text{ points}
   \]

3. Points from long shots:
   \[
   1 \text{ long shot} \times 3 \text{ points/long shot} = 3 \text{ points}
   \]

Now, we sum these points to find Reggie's total score:
\[
\text{Total points for Reggie} = 3 \text{ points (layups)} + 4 \text{ points (free throws)} + 3 \text{ points (long shot)} = 10 \text{ points}
\]

**Step 2: Calculate His Brother's Points**

Reggie's brother only shoots long shots and makes 4 of them. The points for his brother are calculated as follows:

1. Points from long shots:
   \[
   4 \text{ long shots} \times 3 \text{ points/long shot} = 12 \text{ points}
   \]

**Step 3: Determine the Point Difference**

Now, we find out how many points Reggie loses by by calculating the difference in their scores:
\[
\text{Points lost by Reggie} = \text{Points scored by his brother} - \text{Points scored by Reggie}
\]
\[
\text{Points lost by Reggie} = 12 \text{ points} - 10 \text{ points} = 2 \text{ points}
\]

**Final Answer:**
Reggie loses by **2 points**.
