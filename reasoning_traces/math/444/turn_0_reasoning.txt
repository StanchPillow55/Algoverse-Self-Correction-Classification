==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total points scored by Reggie and his brother, and then determine how many points Reggie loses by.

**Step 1: Calculate Reggie's total points.**

Reggie makes:
- 3 layups, each worth 1 point.
- 2 free throws, each worth 2 points.
- 1 long shot, worth 3 points.

Let's calculate the points from each type of shot:

- Points from layups: \(3 \text{ layups} \times 1 \text{ point per layup} = 3 \text{ points}\).
- Points from free throws: \(2 \text{ free throws} \times 2 \text{ points per free throw} = 4 \text{ points}\).
- Points from long shots: \(1 \text{ long shot} \times 3 \text{ points per long shot} = 3 \text{ points}\).

Now, add up all the points Reggie scored:
\[ 3 \text{ (layups)} + 4 \text{ (free throws)} + 3 \text{ (long shot)} = 10 \text{ points}. \]

**Step 2: Calculate Reggie's brother's total points.**

Reggie's brother only shoots long shots and makes 4 of them. Each long shot is worth 3 points.

Calculate the points from the long shots:
\[ 4 \text{ long shots} \times 3 \text{ points per long shot} = 12 \text{ points}. \]

**Step 3: Determine how many points Reggie loses by.**

Reggie's brother scored 12 points, and Reggie scored 10 points. To find out how many points Reggie loses by, subtract Reggie's points from his brother's points:
\[ 12 \text{ points (brother)} - 10 \text{ points (Reggie)} = 2 \text{ points}. \]

**Final Answer:**

Reggie loses by 2 points.
