==================================================

To solve the problem, let's first understand what "Sample reasoning question 11" might entail. Since the problem is not explicitly stated, I'll assume a generic math problem and solve it step by step. Let's consider a problem involving basic algebra, as this is a common type of reasoning question.

**Problem:**
Solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).

**Step 1: Understand the Equation**
The equation given is a linear equation in one variable, \( x \). The goal is to isolate \( x \) on one side of the equation to find its value.

**Step 2: Isolate the Variable**
To isolate \( x \), we need to perform operations that will leave \( x \) alone on one side of the equation. 

1. **Subtract 3 from both sides:**
   \[
   2x + 3 - 3 = 11 - 3
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   2x = 8
   \]

2. **Divide both sides by 2:**
   \[
   \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{8}{2}
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   x = 4
   \]

**Step 3: Verify the Solution**
To ensure the solution is correct, substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation:

\[
2(4) + 3 = 11
\]

Calculate the left side:
\[
8 + 3 = 11
\]

Since both sides of the equation are equal, the solution \( x = 4 \) is verified.

**Final Answer:**
The solution to the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \) is \( x = 4 \).
