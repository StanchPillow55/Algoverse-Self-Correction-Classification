Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to determine how many toys Jonathan currently has based on the information provided.

1. **Understanding the problem**: 
   - James has 80 toys.
   - Jonathan needs 2 more toys than he currently has to have enough toys to create a play set that is five times larger than James's play set.

2. **Calculating the size of Jonathan's desired play set**:
   - Since James has 80 toys, five times the size of James's play set would be:
     \[
     5 \times 80 = 400 \text{ toys}
     \]

3. **Setting up the equation**:
   - Let \( x \) represent the number of toys Jonathan currently has.
   - According to the problem, Jonathan needs 2 more toys than he currently has to reach the total of 400 toys. This can be expressed as:
     \[
     x + 2 = 400
     \]

4. **Solving for \( x \)**:
   - To find \( x \), we can rearrange the equation:
     \[
     x = 400 - 2
     \]
   - Performing the subtraction:
     \[
     x = 398
     \]

5. **Conclusion**:
   - Therefore, Jonathan currently has \( 398 \) toys.

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{398}
\]
