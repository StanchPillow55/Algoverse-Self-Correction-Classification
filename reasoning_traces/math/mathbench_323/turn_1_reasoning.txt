Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 323," we need to first understand what the problem is asking. However, the problem statement "Sample math problem 323" is not specific enough for us to determine what the actual mathematical question is. 

To proceed, let's assume that "Sample math problem 323" refers to a specific problem from a textbook or a set of problems. Since we don't have the actual problem statement, I'll demonstrate how to solve a generic math problem and show all steps and reasoning involved.

Let's consider a sample math problem:

**Problem:** Solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).

**Step 1: Understand the Equation**

The equation given is a linear equation in one variable, \( x \). Our goal is to isolate \( x \) on one side of the equation to find its value.

**Step 2: Isolate the Variable**

To isolate \( x \), we need to perform operations that will leave \( x \) alone on one side of the equation. We start by eliminating the constant term on the left side.

- Subtract 3 from both sides of the equation:

\[
2x + 3 - 3 = 11 - 3
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
2x = 8
\]

**Step 3: Solve for \( x \)**

Now, we need to solve for \( x \) by getting rid of the coefficient of \( x \), which is 2. We do this by dividing both sides of the equation by 2:

\[
\frac{2x}{2} = \frac{8}{2}
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
x = 4
\]

**Step 4: Verify the Solution**

To ensure our solution is correct, we substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation:

\[
2(4) + 3 = 11
\]

Calculate the left side:

\[
8 + 3 = 11
\]

Since both sides of the equation are equal, our solution is verified.

**Final Answer:**

The solution to the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \) is \( x = 4 \).

If "Sample math problem 323" refers to a different problem, please provide the specific details or context of the problem, and I will be happy to solve it step by step.
