Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to first understand what "Sample math problem 323" refers to. Since there is no specific problem statement provided, I will assume this is a placeholder for a typical math problem. Let's create a sample math problem and solve it step by step.

**Sample Math Problem 323:**

**Problem:**  
Solve for \( x \) in the equation:  
\[ 2x + 3 = 11 \]

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Equation:**
   The equation given is a simple linear equation in one variable, \( x \). Our goal is to isolate \( x \) on one side of the equation to find its value.

2. **Subtract 3 from Both Sides:**
   To begin isolating \( x \), we need to eliminate the constant term on the left side of the equation. We do this by subtracting 3 from both sides:
   \[
   2x + 3 - 3 = 11 - 3
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   2x = 8
   \]

3. **Divide Both Sides by 2:**
   Now, we need to solve for \( x \) by getting rid of the coefficient of \( x \), which is 2. We do this by dividing both sides of the equation by 2:
   \[
   \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{8}{2}
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   x = 4
   \]

4. **Verify the Solution:**
   To ensure our solution is correct, we substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation:
   \[
   2(4) + 3 = 11
   \]
   Simplifying the left side:
   \[
   8 + 3 = 11
   \]
   Since both sides of the equation are equal, our solution is verified.

**Final Answer:**
The solution to the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \) is \( x = 4 \).
