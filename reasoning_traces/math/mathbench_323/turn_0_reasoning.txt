Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample math problem 323" refers to. Since this is not a standard problem description, I'll assume it's a placeholder for a specific math problem. Without the actual problem statement, I can't provide a solution. However, I can guide you through a generic approach to solving math problems.

Here's a general step-by-step approach to solving a math problem:

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - Read the problem carefully.
   - Identify what is being asked.
   - Determine what information is given and what needs to be found.

2. **Devise a Plan:**
   - Consider possible strategies to solve the problem (e.g., algebraic manipulation, drawing a diagram, logical reasoning, etc.).
   - Choose the most appropriate method based on the problem type.

3. **Carry Out the Plan:**
   - Execute the chosen strategy step by step.
   - Perform calculations carefully.
   - Keep track of units and ensure consistency.

4. **Review/Check Your Work:**
   - Verify each step to ensure accuracy.
   - Check if the solution makes sense in the context of the problem.
   - Re-calculate if necessary to confirm results.

5. **State the Final Answer:**
   - Clearly present the final answer.
   - Include units if applicable.

Since I don't have the specific details of "Sample math problem 323," I can't provide a detailed solution. If you can provide the actual problem statement, I'd be happy to help solve it!
