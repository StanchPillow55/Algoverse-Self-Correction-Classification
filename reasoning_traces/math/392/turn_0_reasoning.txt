==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to determine the washing times for each type of laundry: clothes, towels, and sheets. We will then sum these times to find the total washing time.

1. **Determine the washing time for clothes**:
   - The problem states that the clothes take **30 minutes** to wash.

2. **Determine the washing time for towels**:
   - The towels take **twice as long** as the clothes to wash. 
   - Therefore, the time for towels is:
     \[
     \text{Time for towels} = 2 \times \text{Time for clothes} = 2 \times 30 \text{ minutes} = 60 \text{ minutes}
     \]

3. **Determine the washing time for sheets**:
   - The sheets take **15 minutes less** time to wash than the towels.
   - Therefore, the time for sheets is:
     \[
     \text{Time for sheets} = \text{Time for towels} - 15 \text{ minutes} = 60 \text{ minutes} - 15 \text{ minutes} = 45 \text{ minutes}
     \]

4. **Calculate the total washing time**:
   - Now we add the washing times for all three types of laundry:
     \[
     \text{Total time} = \text{Time for clothes} + \text{Time for towels} + \text{Time for sheets}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total time} = 30 \text{ minutes} + 60 \text{ minutes} + 45 \text{ minutes}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total time} = 135 \text{ minutes}
     \]

Thus, the total time it will take for Naomi to wash everything is **135 minutes**.

Final answer: **135 minutes**.
