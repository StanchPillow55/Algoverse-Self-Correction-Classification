==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine the time it takes to wash each type of laundry and then sum these times to find the total time Naomi will spend washing everything.

1. **Clothes on the Gentle Cycle:**
   - We are told that the clothes take 30 minutes to wash.

2. **Towels:**
   - The problem states that the towels take twice as long as the clothes to wash.
   - Since the clothes take 30 minutes, the towels will take:
     \[
     2 \times 30 = 60 \text{ minutes}
     \]

3. **Sheets:**
   - The sheets take 15 minutes less time to wash than the towels.
   - Since the towels take 60 minutes, the sheets will take:
     \[
     60 - 15 = 45 \text{ minutes}
     \]

4. **Total Time:**
   - To find the total time Naomi will spend washing everything, we add the times for each type of laundry:
     \[
     30 \text{ (clothes)} + 60 \text{ (towels)} + 45 \text{ (sheets)} = 135 \text{ minutes}
     \]

Therefore, the total time it will take for Naomi to wash everything is \(\boxed{135}\) minutes.
