To determine how much money Tim saves by canceling his cable subscription and switching to streaming services, we need to calculate the total cost of the streaming services and compare it to the cost of the cable package.

1. **Calculate the cost of the streaming services:**
   - **Netflix:** $10 per month
   - **Hulu:** $10 per month
   - **Disney Plus:** $10 per month

   If Tim were to subscribe to each service separately, the total cost would be:
   \[
   \text{Total cost without bundling} = \text{Netflix} + \text{Hulu} + \text{Disney Plus} = 10 + 10 + 10 = 30 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Calculate the bundling discount:**
   Tim saves 20% by bundling Hulu and Disney Plus. First, we need to find the cost of Hulu and Disney Plus together before applying the discount:
   \[
   \text{Cost of Hulu and Disney Plus} = 10 + 10 = 20 \text{ dollars}
   \]
   Now, we calculate the 20% discount:
   \[
   \text{Discount} = 20\% \text{ of } 20 = 0.20 \times 20 = 4 \text{ dollars}
   \]
   Therefore, the cost after the discount is:
   \[
   \text{Cost after discount} = 20 - 4 = 16 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total cost of the streaming services with the discount:**
   Now we add the cost of Netflix to the discounted cost of Hulu and Disney Plus:
   \[
   \text{Total cost of streaming services} = \text{Netflix} + \text{Cost of Hulu and Disney Plus after discount} = 10 + 16 = 26 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Calculate the savings from canceling the cable subscription:**
   Tim's cable subscription costs $60 per month. To find out how much he saves, we subtract the total cost of the streaming services from the cost of the cable subscription:
   \[
   \text{Savings} = \text{Cost of cable} - \text{Total cost of streaming services} = 60 - 26 = 34 \text{ dollars}
   \]

5. **Final answer:**
   Tim saves **$34** by canceling his cable subscription and switching to streaming services.
