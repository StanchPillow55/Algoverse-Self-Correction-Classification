==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to determine how far Tom's ship travels during the first leg of his journey and then use that distance to find out how long it takes him to return at a different speed.

### Step 1: Determine the time spent sailing from 1 PM to 4 PM.

Tom sails from 1 PM to 4 PM, which is a total of:
\[
4 \text{ PM} - 1 \text{ PM} = 3 \text{ hours}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the distance traveled during the first leg of the journey.

Tom's ship travels at a speed of 10 miles per hour. The distance traveled can be calculated using the formula:
\[
\text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time}
\]
Substituting the known values:
\[
\text{Distance} = 10 \text{ miles/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 30 \text{ miles}
\]

### Step 3: Determine the time taken to return at a speed of 6 mph.

Now, Tom needs to return the same distance of 30 miles at a speed of 6 miles per hour. We can use the same distance formula rearranged to find time:
\[
\text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}}
\]
Substituting the values for the return trip:
\[
\text{Time} = \frac{30 \text{ miles}}{6 \text{ miles/hour}} = 5 \text{ hours}
\]

### Final Answer

It takes Tom **5 hours** to get back.
