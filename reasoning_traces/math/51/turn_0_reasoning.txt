First, we need to calculate the total area of the fabric before Ann starts cutting. The area of a rectangle is calculated by multiplying the length by the width. So, the total area of the fabric is 16 feet * 12 feet = 192 square feet.

Next, we need to calculate the area of the fabric that Ann cuts for the curtains. The area of the living room curtains is 4 feet * 6 feet = 24 square feet. The area of the bedroom curtains is 2 feet * 4 feet = 8 square feet.

To find the total area of the fabric that Ann cuts, we add the area of the living room curtains to the area of the bedroom curtains. So, the total area of the fabric that Ann cuts is 24 square feet + 8 square feet = 32 square feet.

Finally, to find out how much fabric is left, we subtract the total area of the fabric that Ann cuts from the total area of the fabric before Ann starts cutting. So, the amount of fabric left is 192 square feet - 32 square feet = 160 square feet.

Therefore, there are 160 square feet of fabric left.
