To determine how much fabric Ann has left after cutting the pieces for the curtains, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the area of the bolt of fabric.**
   The dimensions of the bolt of fabric are 16 feet by 12 feet. The area \( A \) of a rectangle is calculated using the formula:
   \[
   A = \text{length} \times \text{width}
   \]
   So, the area of the bolt of fabric is:
   \[
   A = 16 \, \text{feet} \times 12 \, \text{feet} = 192 \, \text{square feet}
   \]

2. **Calculate the area of the fabric cut for the living room.**
   The dimensions of the rectangle cut for the living room are 4 feet by 6 feet. Using the same area formula:
   \[
   A_{\text{living room}} = 4 \, \text{feet} \times 6 \, \text{feet} = 24 \, \text{square feet}
   \]

3. **Calculate the area of the fabric cut for the bedroom.**
   The dimensions of the rectangle cut for the bedroom are 2 feet by 4 feet. Again, using the area formula:
   \[
   A_{\text{bedroom}} = 2 \, \text{feet} \times 4 \, \text{feet} = 8 \, \text{square feet}
   \]

4. **Calculate the total area of fabric cut.**
   To find the total area of fabric that Ann has cut, we add the areas of the living room and bedroom fabric:
   \[
   A_{\text{total cut}} = A_{\text{living room}} + A_{\text{bedroom}} = 24 \, \text{square feet} + 8 \, \text{square feet} = 32 \, \text{square feet}
   \]

5. **Calculate the remaining area of fabric.**
   To find the remaining area of fabric after the cuts, we subtract the total area cut from the area of the bolt of fabric:
   \[
   A_{\text{remaining}} = A_{\text{bolt}} - A_{\text{total cut}} = 192 \, \text{square feet} - 32 \, \text{square feet} = 160 \, \text{square feet}
   \]

Thus, the amount of fabric left after Ann cuts the pieces for the curtains is:

\[
\boxed{160} \, \text{square feet}
\]
