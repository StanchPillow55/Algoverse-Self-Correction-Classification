To calculate Jill's annual salary, we need to determine her earnings from both her teaching job and her coaching job separately, and then sum those amounts.

### Step 1: Calculate Jill's earnings as a teacher

1. **Hourly Rate as a Teacher**: $20 per hour
2. **Hours Worked per Week as a Teacher**: 35 hours
3. **Weeks Worked per Year**: 50 weeks

Now, we can calculate her annual earnings from teaching:

\[
\text{Annual Earnings from Teaching} = \text{Hourly Rate} \times \text{Hours per Week} \times \text{Weeks per Year}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\text{Annual Earnings from Teaching} = 20 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 35 \, \text{hours/week} \times 50 \, \text{weeks/year}
\]

Calculating this step-by-step:

1. Calculate the weekly earnings from teaching:
   \[
   20 \times 35 = 700 \, \text{dollars/week}
   \]

2. Now calculate the annual earnings from teaching:
   \[
   700 \, \text{dollars/week} \times 50 \, \text{weeks/year} = 35,000 \, \text{dollars/year}
   \]

### Step 2: Calculate Jill's earnings as a cheerleading coach

1. **Hourly Rate as a Coach**: $30 per hour
2. **Hours Worked per Week as a Coach**: 15 hours
3. **Weeks Worked per Year**: 50 weeks

Now, we can calculate her annual earnings from coaching:

\[
\text{Annual Earnings from Coaching} = \text{Hourly Rate} \times \text{Hours per Week} \times \text{Weeks per Year}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\text{Annual Earnings from Coaching} = 30 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 15 \, \text{hours/week} \times 50 \, \text{weeks/year}
\]

Calculating this step-by-step:

1. Calculate the weekly earnings from coaching:
   \[
   30 \times 15 = 450 \, \text{dollars/week}
   \]

2. Now calculate the annual earnings from coaching:
   \[
   450 \, \text{dollars/week} \times 50 \, \text{weeks/year} = 22,500 \, \text{dollars/year}
   \]

### Step 3: Calculate Jill's total annual salary

Now we can find Jill's total annual salary by adding her earnings from teaching and coaching:

\[
\text{Total Annual Salary} = \text{Annual Earnings from Teaching} + \text{Annual Earnings from Coaching}
\]

Substituting the values we calculated:

\[
\text{Total Annual Salary} = 35,000 \, \text{dollars/year} + 22,500 \, \text{dollars/year}
\]

Calculating this:

\[
\text{Total Annual Salary} = 57,500 \, \text{dollars/year}
\]

### Final Answer

Jill's total annual salary is **$57,500**.
