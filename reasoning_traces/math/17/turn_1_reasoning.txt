==================================================

First, let's calculate the total number of hard hats in the truck before Carl and John take any. 

The total number of hard hats is the sum of the pink, green, and yellow hard hats. 

So, 26 (pink) + 15 (green) + 24 (yellow) = 65 hard hats.

Now, let's calculate how many hard hats Carl and John take away.

Carl takes away 4 pink hard hats.

John takes away 6 pink hard hats and twice as many green hard hats. Twice the number of pink hard hats that John took is 2 * 6 = 12 green hard hats.

So, John takes away a total of 6 (pink) + 12 (green) = 18 hard hats.

Therefore, Carl and John together take away 4 (Carl's pink) + 18 (John's total) = 22 hard hats.

Now, to find the total number of hard hats that remained in the truck, we subtract the number of hard hats that Carl and John took from the initial total.

So, 65 (total) - 22 (taken) = 43 hard hats.

Therefore, 43 hard hats remained in the truck.
