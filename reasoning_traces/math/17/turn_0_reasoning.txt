To solve the problem, we will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the initial total number of hard hats in the truck.**
2. **Determine how many hard hats Carl and John take away.**
3. **Calculate the total number of hard hats remaining in the truck after they take some away.**

### Step 1: Calculate the initial total number of hard hats

We have the following hard hats:
- Pink hard hats: 26
- Green hard hats: 15
- Yellow hard hats: 24

To find the total number of hard hats, we add these quantities together:

\[
\text{Total hard hats} = \text{Pink} + \text{Green} + \text{Yellow} = 26 + 15 + 24
\]

Calculating this:

\[
26 + 15 = 41
\]
\[
41 + 24 = 65
\]

So, the initial total number of hard hats in the truck is **65**.

### Step 2: Determine how many hard hats Carl and John take away

**Carl's removal:**
- Carl takes away 4 pink hard hats.

**John's removal:**
- John takes away 6 pink hard hats.
- Additionally, John takes away twice as many green hard hats as the number of pink hard hats he removed. Since he removed 6 pink hard hats, he will take away:

\[
\text{Green hard hats taken by John} = 2 \times 6 = 12
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the total number of hard hats taken away

Now, we can calculate the total number of hard hats taken away by both Carl and John:

- Total pink hard hats taken away = Carl's pink + John's pink = 4 + 6 = 10
- Total green hard hats taken away = John's green = 12
- There are no yellow hard hats taken away.

Thus, the total number of hard hats taken away is:

\[
\text{Total taken away} = \text{Pink taken} + \text{Green taken} = 10 + 12 = 22
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the total number of hard hats remaining

To find the total number of hard hats remaining in the truck, we subtract the total number of hard hats taken away from the initial total:

\[
\text{Remaining hard hats} = \text{Initial total} - \text{Total taken away} = 65 - 22
\]

Calculating this:

\[
65 - 22 = 43
\]

### Final Answer

The total number of hard hats that remained in the truck is **43**.
