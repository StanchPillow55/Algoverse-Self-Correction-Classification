==================================================

The total number of hard hats in the truck initially is the sum of the pink, green, and yellow hard hats. 

So, the total number of hard hats initially is 26 (pink) + 15 (green) + 24 (yellow) = 65 hard hats.

Carl takes away 4 pink hard hats, reducing the number of pink hard hats to 26 - 4 = 22.

John takes away 6 pink hard hats, further reducing the number of pink hard hats to 22 - 6 = 16.

John also takes away twice as many green hard hats as the number of pink hard hats that he removed. So, he takes away 2 * 6 = 12 green hard hats.

This reduces the number of green hard hats to 15 - 12 = 3.

Therefore, the total number of hard hats that remained in the truck is the sum of the remaining pink, green, and yellow hard hats.

So, the total number of hard hats that remained in the truck is 16 (pink) + 3 (green) + 24 (yellow) = 43 hard hats.

So, the final answer is that there are 43 hard hats remaining in the truck.
