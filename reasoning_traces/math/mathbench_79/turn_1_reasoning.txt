==================================================

To solve "Sample math problem 79," we first need to understand what the problem is asking. Since the problem is not explicitly stated, I'll assume a hypothetical math problem for demonstration purposes. Let's say the problem is:

**Problem 79:**
Calculate the sum of the first 79 positive integers.

To solve this problem, we can use the formula for the sum of the first \( n \) positive integers:

\[
S = \frac{n(n + 1)}{2}
\]

where \( n \) is the number of terms. In this case, \( n = 79 \).

**Step-by-step Solution:**

1. **Identify the formula:**
   The formula for the sum of the first \( n \) positive integers is:
   \[
   S = \frac{n(n + 1)}{2}
   \]

2. **Substitute \( n = 79 \) into the formula:**
   \[
   S = \frac{79(79 + 1)}{2}
   \]

3. **Calculate \( 79 + 1 \):**
   \[
   79 + 1 = 80
   \]

4. **Substitute back into the formula:**
   \[
   S = \frac{79 \times 80}{2}
   \]

5. **Calculate \( 79 \times 80 \):**
   \[
   79 \times 80 = 6320
   \]

6. **Divide by 2 to find the sum:**
   \[
   S = \frac{6320}{2} = 3160
   \]

Thus, the sum of the first 79 positive integers is 3160.

**Final Answer:**
The sum of the first 79 positive integers is 3160.
