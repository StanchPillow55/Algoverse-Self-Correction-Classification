==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 79," we first need to clarify what the problem is asking. Since "Sample math problem 79" is not a standard or specific math problem, I'll need to create a hypothetical problem to demonstrate how to solve it step by step. Let's assume the problem is as follows:

**Problem:**
Calculate the sum of all even numbers from 1 to 79.

**Step-by-step Solution:**

1. **Identify the Even Numbers:**
   Even numbers are integers that are divisible by 2. From 1 to 79, the even numbers start at 2 and end at 78.

2. **List the Even Numbers:**
   The even numbers from 1 to 79 are: 2, 4, 6, 8, ..., 78.

3. **Determine the Sequence:**
   This is an arithmetic sequence where the first term \( a_1 = 2 \), the common difference \( d = 2 \), and the last term \( a_n = 78 \).

4. **Find the Number of Terms:**
   To find the number of terms \( n \) in the sequence, use the formula for the \( n \)-th term of an arithmetic sequence:
   \[
   a_n = a_1 + (n-1) \cdot d
   \]
   Plug in the known values:
   \[
   78 = 2 + (n-1) \cdot 2
   \]
   \[
   78 = 2 + 2n - 2
   \]
   \[
   78 = 2n
   \]
   \[
   n = \frac{78}{2} = 39
   \]
   So, there are 39 even numbers from 1 to 79.

5. **Calculate the Sum of the Sequence:**
   Use the formula for the sum \( S_n \) of an arithmetic sequence:
   \[
   S_n = \frac{n}{2} \cdot (a_1 + a_n)
   \]
   Plug in the values:
   \[
   S_{39} = \frac{39}{2} \cdot (2 + 78)
   \]
   \[
   S_{39} = \frac{39}{2} \cdot 80
   \]
   \[
   S_{39} = 39 \cdot 40
   \]
   \[
   S_{39} = 1560
   \]

**Final Answer:**
The sum of all even numbers from 1 to 79 is 1560.
