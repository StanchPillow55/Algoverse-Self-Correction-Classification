Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To determine how many signatures Carol and Jennifer need to collect to reach their goal of 100 signatures by the end of the summer, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of signatures they currently have:**
   - Carol has 20 signatures.
   - Jennifer has 44 signatures.
   - To find the total signatures they currently have, we add these two amounts together:

   \[
   \text{Total signatures} = \text{Carol's signatures} + \text{Jennifer's signatures} = 20 + 44 = 64
   \]

2. **Determine the goal for the total number of signatures:**
   - The sisters want to reach a total of 100 signatures.

3. **Calculate how many more signatures they need to collect:**
   - To find out how many more signatures they need, we subtract the total signatures they currently have from their goal:

   \[
   \text{Signatures needed} = \text{Goal} - \text{Total signatures} = 100 - 64 = 36
   \]

4. **Conclusion:**
   - Carol and Jennifer need to collect 36 more signatures to reach their goal of 100 signatures by the end of the summer.

Thus, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{36}
\]
