Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine how many ice cream cones Dan sold and how many of those were given away for free.

### Step-by-step Solution:

1. **Determine the Total Number of Cones Sold:**
   - Dan sold $100 worth of cones.
   - Each cone costs $2.
   - To find the total number of cones sold, divide the total sales by the price per cone:
     \[
     \text{Total cones sold} = \frac{\text{Total sales}}{\text{Price per cone}} = \frac{100}{2} = 50
     \]
   - Therefore, Dan sold 50 cones in total.

2. **Determine How Many Cones Were Given Away for Free:**
   - Every sixth customer gets a free cone.
   - To find out how many cones were given away, we need to determine how many groups of 6 customers there are in the total number of cones sold.
   - Since every sixth cone is free, we divide the total number of cones by 6:
     \[
     \text{Free cones given} = \left\lfloor \frac{\text{Total cones sold}}{6} \right\rfloor = \left\lfloor \frac{50}{6} \right\rfloor
     \]
   - Calculate the division:
     \[
     \frac{50}{6} \approx 8.33
     \]
   - The floor function \(\left\lfloor 8.33 \right\rfloor\) gives us 8, meaning there are 8 complete groups of 6 customers, and thus 8 free cones were given away.

### Conclusion:

Dan gave away 8 free ice cream cones. 

**Final Answer:** 8 free cones.
