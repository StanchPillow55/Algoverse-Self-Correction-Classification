==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to determine how many ice cream cones Dan sold and how many of those were free cones given away.

1. **Determine the total number of cones sold**:
   Dan sold $100 worth of cones, and each cone costs $2. To find out how many cones he sold, we divide the total sales amount by the price per cone:

   \[
   \text{Total cones sold} = \frac{\text{Total sales}}{\text{Price per cone}} = \frac{100}{2} = 50
   \]

   So, Dan sold a total of 50 ice cream cones.

2. **Determine how many free cones were given away**:
   According to the problem, every sixth customer receives a free ice cream cone. This means that for every 6 customers, 1 cone is given away for free. To find out how many free cones were given away, we need to calculate how many groups of 6 customers are in the total number of cones sold (which is 50).

   We can find this by dividing the total number of cones sold by 6:

   \[
   \text{Number of free cones} = \frac{\text{Total cones sold}}{6} = \frac{50}{6}
   \]

   When we perform this division, we get:

   \[
   \frac{50}{6} = 8.33
   \]

   Since Dan cannot give away a fraction of a cone, we take the integer part of this division, which means Dan gave away 8 free cones.

3. **Final answer**:
   Therefore, the total number of free ice cream cones that Dan gave away is:

   \[
   \boxed{8}
   \]
