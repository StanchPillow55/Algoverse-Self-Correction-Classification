==================================================

To determine the profit the hospital makes from the visits, we need to calculate both the total revenue generated from the patients and the total cost incurred by the hospital for the doctors' services. 

### Step 1: Calculate the total time spent on patients per day

Each patient is seen for an average of 24 minutes. Since there are 500 patients per day, we can calculate the total time spent on all patients in minutes:

\[
\text{Total time (in minutes)} = \text{Number of patients} \times \text{Time per patient}
\]
\[
\text{Total time (in minutes)} = 500 \times 24 = 12000 \text{ minutes}
\]

### Step 2: Convert total time into hours

Since the doctors charge by the hour, we need to convert the total time from minutes to hours. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so:

\[
\text{Total time (in hours)} = \frac{\text{Total time (in minutes)}}{60}
\]
\[
\text{Total time (in hours)} = \frac{12000}{60} = 200 \text{ hours}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the total cost for the hospital

The doctors charge the hospital $150 per hour. Therefore, the total cost for the hospital can be calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Total cost} = \text{Total time (in hours)} \times \text{Cost per hour}
\]
\[
\text{Total cost} = 200 \times 150 = 30000 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the total revenue from patients

The hospital charges patients $200 per hour. To find the total revenue from the patients, we first calculate the revenue per patient and then multiply by the number of patients. Since each patient is seen for 24 minutes, we need to convert that to hours:

\[
\text{Time per patient (in hours)} = \frac{24}{60} = 0.4 \text{ hours}
\]

Now, we can calculate the revenue from each patient:

\[
\text{Revenue per patient} = \text{Time per patient (in hours)} \times \text{Charge per hour}
\]
\[
\text{Revenue per patient} = 0.4 \times 200 = 80 \text{ dollars}
\]

Now, we can find the total revenue from all patients:

\[
\text{Total revenue} = \text{Number of patients} \times \text{Revenue per patient}
\]
\[
\text{Total revenue} = 500 \times 80 = 40000 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Step 5: Calculate the profit

Profit is calculated as total revenue minus total costs:

\[
\text{Profit} = \text{Total revenue} - \text{Total cost}
\]
\[
\text{Profit} = 40000 - 30000 = 10000 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Final Answer

The hospital makes a profit of **$10,000** from these visits.
