To solve the problem, we need to determine how many ice cream cones Dan sold and how many of those were free cones given away.

1. **Determine the total number of cones sold**:
   The total revenue from selling ice cream cones is $100. Each cone costs $2. We can find the total number of cones sold by dividing the total revenue by the cost per cone.

   \[
   \text{Total cones sold} = \frac{\text{Total revenue}}{\text{Cost per cone}} = \frac{100}{2} = 50
   \]

   So, Dan sold a total of 50 ice cream cones.

2. **Determine how many free cones were given away**:
   According to the problem, every sixth customer receives a free ice cream cone. This means that for every 6 cones sold, 1 cone is free. To find out how many free cones were given away, we need to calculate how many groups of 6 are in the total number of cones sold.

   \[
   \text{Number of free cones} = \frac{\text{Total cones sold}}{6} = \frac{50}{6}
   \]

   When we perform the division:

   \[
   50 \div 6 = 8 \quad \text{(with a remainder of 2)}
   \]

   This means that Dan gave away 8 free cones because we only count complete groups of 6 customers.

3. **Final answer**:
   Therefore, the total number of free ice cream cones Dan gave away is:

   \[
   \boxed{8}
   \]
