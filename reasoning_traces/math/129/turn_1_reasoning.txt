==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine how many free ice cream cones Dan gave away when he sold $100 worth of cones, given that every sixth customer receives a free cone.

### Step-by-step Solution:

1. **Determine the Number of Cones Sold:**
   - Each cone costs $2.
   - Dan sold $100 worth of cones.
   - To find the number of cones sold, divide the total sales by the price per cone:
     \[
     \text{Number of cones sold} = \frac{\text{Total sales}}{\text{Price per cone}} = \frac{100}{2} = 50
     \]

2. **Determine the Number of Free Cones Given:**
   - Every sixth customer receives a free cone.
   - This means for every 6 cones given out, 5 are sold and 1 is free.
   - We need to find out how many sets of 6 cones were given out in total.
   - Since 50 cones were sold, we calculate the number of sets of 6 cones:
     \[
     \text{Number of sets of 6 cones} = \frac{50}{6} \approx 8.33
     \]
   - Since Dan can't give away a fraction of a free cone, we consider only the whole number part, which is 8.

3. **Calculate the Number of Free Cones:**
   - For each complete set of 6 cones, 1 cone is free.
   - Therefore, Dan gave away 8 free cones.

### Conclusion:

Dan gave away 8 free ice cream cones. 

**Final Answer: 8 free cones**
