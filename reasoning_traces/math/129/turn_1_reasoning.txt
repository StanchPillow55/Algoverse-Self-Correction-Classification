==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to determine how many ice cream cones Dan sold and how many of those were free cones given away.

1. **Understanding the Pricing**:
   Each ice cream cone costs $2. 

2. **Calculating Total Sales**:
   Dan sold $100 worth of ice cream cones. To find out how many cones he sold, we divide the total sales by the price per cone:
   \[
   \text{Number of cones sold} = \frac{\text{Total sales}}{\text{Price per cone}} = \frac{100}{2} = 50
   \]
   So, Dan sold a total of 50 ice cream cones.

3. **Identifying Free Cones**:
   According to the problem, every sixth customer receives a free ice cream cone. This means that for every 6 cones sold, 1 cone is free. 

4. **Calculating the Number of Free Cones**:
   To find out how many free cones were given away, we need to determine how many groups of 6 are in the total number of cones sold:
   \[
   \text{Number of free cones} = \frac{\text{Total cones sold}}{6} = \frac{50}{6}
   \]
   When we perform the division:
   \[
   \frac{50}{6} = 8.33
   \]
   Since Dan cannot give away a fraction of a cone, we take the integer part of this division, which means he gave away 8 free cones.

5. **Final Answer**:
   Therefore, the total number of free ice cream cones Dan gave away is:
   \[
   \boxed{8}
   \]
