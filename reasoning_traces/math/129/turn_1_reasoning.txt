==================================================

To determine the profit the hospital makes from the visits, we need to calculate both the total revenue generated from the patients and the total cost incurred by the hospital for the doctors' services. We will then subtract the total costs from the total revenue to find the profit.

### Step 1: Calculate Total Revenue from Patients

1. **Number of Patients per Day**: 500 patients
2. **Charge per Patient**: $200 per hour
3. **Average Time per Patient**: 24 minutes

First, we need to convert the average time per patient from minutes to hours:
\[
\text{Average time per patient in hours} = \frac{24 \text{ minutes}}{60 \text{ minutes/hour}} = 0.4 \text{ hours}
\]

Next, we calculate the revenue generated from each patient:
\[
\text{Revenue per patient} = 200 \text{ dollars/hour} \times 0.4 \text{ hours} = 80 \text{ dollars}
\]

Now, we can calculate the total revenue for all patients in a day:
\[
\text{Total Revenue} = \text{Number of Patients} \times \text{Revenue per Patient} = 500 \times 80 = 40,000 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate Total Cost for Doctors

1. **Charge per Doctor**: $150 per hour
2. **Average Time per Patient**: 24 minutes (or 0.4 hours)
3. **Number of Patients per Day**: 500 patients

First, we calculate the total time spent by doctors for all patients:
\[
\text{Total time for all patients} = \text{Number of Patients} \times \text{Average Time per Patient} = 500 \times 0.4 = 200 \text{ hours}
\]

Next, we calculate the total cost for the doctors:
\[
\text{Total Cost} = \text{Total time for all patients} \times \text{Charge per Doctor} = 200 \text{ hours} \times 150 \text{ dollars/hour} = 30,000 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate Profit

Now we can find the profit by subtracting the total costs from the total revenue:
\[
\text{Profit} = \text{Total Revenue} - \text{Total Cost} = 40,000 \text{ dollars} - 30,000 \text{ dollars} = 10,000 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Final Answer
The hospital makes a profit of **$10,000** from these visits.
