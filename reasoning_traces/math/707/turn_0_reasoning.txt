To solve the problem, we need to break it down step by step.

1. **Identify the total water usage by Colorado City from the Colorado River**:
   - Colorado City uses 40% of the water from the Colorado River. 
   - Let's denote the total amount of water from the Colorado River as \( W \).
   - Therefore, the amount of water used by Colorado City is:
     \[
     \text{Water used by Colorado City} = 0.40 \times W
     \]

2. **Determine the amount of water used for industrial purposes**:
   - It is given that 80% of the water used by Colorado City is for industrial purposes.
   - The amount of water used for industrial purposes can be calculated as:
     \[
     \text{Water used for industrial purposes} = 0.80 \times (\text{Water used by Colorado City}) = 0.80 \times (0.40 \times W)
     \]
   - Simplifying this gives:
     \[
     \text{Water used for industrial purposes} = 0.80 \times 0.40 \times W = 0.32 \times W
     \]

3. **Calculate the amount of water used for non-industrial purposes**:
   - The remaining water used by Colorado City is for non-industrial purposes. This can be calculated by subtracting the industrial water usage from the total water usage by the city:
     \[
     \text{Water used for non-industrial purposes} = \text{Water used by Colorado City} - \text{Water used for industrial purposes}
     \]
   - Substituting the values we have:
     \[
     \text{Water used for non-industrial purposes} = (0.40 \times W) - (0.32 \times W)
     \]
   - Simplifying this gives:
     \[
     \text{Water used for non-industrial purposes} = (0.40 - 0.32) \times W = 0.08 \times W
     \]

4. **Calculate the percentage of the river's total water used by the city for non-industrial purposes**:
   - To find the percentage of the river's total water that is used by Colorado City for non-industrial purposes, we take the amount used for non-industrial purposes and express it as a percentage of the total water \( W \):
     \[
     \text{Percentage of river's total water used for non-industrial purposes} = \left( \frac{0.08 \times W}{W} \right) \times 100\%
     \]
   - This simplifies to:
     \[
     \text{Percentage} = 0.08 \times 100\% = 8\%
     \]

Thus, the final answer is that **8% of the Colorado River's total water is used by Colorado City for non-industrial purposes**.
