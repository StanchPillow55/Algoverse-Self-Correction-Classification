==================================================

To solve the problem effectively, I need to understand the context and details of "Sample reasoning question 46." However, since the specific content of the question isn't provided, I'll demonstrate a general approach to solving a typical math problem by walking through a hypothetical example.

Let's assume a sample math problem:

**Problem:**
A farmer has a rectangular field that is 100 meters long and 60 meters wide. He wants to build a fence around the entire field and also divide the field into two equal smaller rectangles by adding a fence parallel to the shorter side. Calculate the total length of the fence required.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We have a rectangular field with dimensions 100 meters (length) and 60 meters (width).
   - We need to calculate the total length of the fence required to enclose the entire field and divide it into two equal parts.

2. **Calculate the Perimeter of the Field:**
   - The perimeter \( P \) of a rectangle is given by the formula:
     \[
     P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width})
     \]
   - Substituting the given values:
     \[
     P = 2 \times (100 + 60) = 2 \times 160 = 320 \text{ meters}
     \]
   - This is the length of the fence required to enclose the entire field.

3. **Divide the Field into Two Equal Parts:**
   - The field is divided into two equal rectangles by a fence parallel to the shorter side (width).
   - This means we add an additional fence along the length of the field.
   - The length of this additional fence is equal to the length of the field, which is 100 meters.

4. **Calculate the Total Length of the Fence:**
   - Total length of the fence required is the perimeter of the field plus the additional fence:
     \[
     \text{Total Fence Length} = 320 + 100 = 420 \text{ meters}
     \]

5. **Final Answer:**
   - The total length of the fence required is 420 meters.

This step-by-step approach ensures that each part of the problem is addressed systematically, leading to a clear and correct solution. If you have a specific problem or question in mind, please provide the details, and I can work through that particular problem.
