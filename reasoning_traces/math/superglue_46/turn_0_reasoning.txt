To provide a thorough solution, I need the specific details of "Sample reasoning question 46." Since the question isn't provided, I'll demonstrate how to approach a typical math problem by solving an example problem. If you have a specific question in mind, please provide the details.

**Example Problem:**

**Question:**  
A farmer has a rectangular field that is twice as long as it is wide. If the perimeter of the field is 300 meters, what are the dimensions of the field?

**Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We have a rectangular field.
   - Let the width of the field be \( w \).
   - The length of the field is twice the width, so it is \( 2w \).
   - The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula:  
     \[
     P = 2(\text{length} + \text{width})
     \]
   - We know the perimeter is 300 meters.

2. **Set Up the Equation:**
   - Substitute the known values into the perimeter formula:
     \[
     300 = 2(2w + w)
     \]

3. **Simplify and Solve for \( w \):**
   - Simplify inside the parentheses:
     \[
     300 = 2(3w)
     \]
   - Simplify further:
     \[
     300 = 6w
     \]
   - Solve for \( w \) by dividing both sides by 6:
     \[
     w = \frac{300}{6} = 50
     \]

4. **Find the Length:**
   - Since the length is twice the width:
     \[
     \text{Length} = 2w = 2 \times 50 = 100
     \]

5. **Verify the Solution:**
   - Check the perimeter with the found dimensions:
     \[
     P = 2(\text{Length} + \text{Width}) = 2(100 + 50) = 2 \times 150 = 300
     \]
   - The calculated perimeter matches the given perimeter, confirming our solution is correct.

6. **State the Final Answer:**
   - The dimensions of the field are 50 meters in width and 100 meters in length.
