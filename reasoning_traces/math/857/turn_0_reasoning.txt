==================================================

To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step, calculating the amount of water passing through the river at each stage.

1. **Initial Amount of Water**: 
   - The problem states that the amount of water passing through the river at one point in time is 4000 gallons.

2. **After Heavy Rain (Day 1)**: 
   - After a day of heavy rain, the amount of water doubles. 
   - Therefore, the new amount of water is:
     \[
     4000 \text{ gallons} \times 2 = 8000 \text{ gallons}
     \]

3. **On the Third Day**: 
   - The problem states that the volume of water passing through the river increases by 6000 gallons on the third day.
   - We need to add this increase to the amount of water from Day 1 (after the rain):
     \[
     8000 \text{ gallons} + 6000 \text{ gallons} = 14000 \text{ gallons}
     \]

4. **Final Calculation**: 
   - The total amount of water passing through the river at that point after the rain and the additional increase is:
     \[
     14000 \text{ gallons}
     \]

Thus, the total amount of water passing through the river at that point is **14000 gallons**.

**Final Answer**: 14000 gallons
