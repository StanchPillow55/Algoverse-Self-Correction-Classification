==================================================

To solve the problem effectively, I need to understand the context and details of "Sample reasoning question 78." However, since the problem statement is not provided, I'll demonstrate a general approach to solving a typical math reasoning problem. If you have a specific problem in mind, please provide the details, and I'll address it accordingly.

Let's assume a sample reasoning problem:

**Problem:**
A farmer has a rectangular field that is 100 meters long and 50 meters wide. He wants to divide the field into two equal areas by constructing a fence parallel to one of the sides. How long will the fence be?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We have a rectangular field with dimensions 100 meters by 50 meters.
   - The total area of the field is \(100 \times 50 = 5000\) square meters.
   - We need to divide this area into two equal parts, each with an area of \( \frac{5000}{2} = 2500 \) square meters.
   - The fence should be parallel to one of the sides.

2. **Determine Possible Configurations:**
   - The fence can be parallel to the longer side (100 meters) or the shorter side (50 meters).

3. **Case 1: Fence Parallel to the Longer Side (100 meters):**
   - If the fence is parallel to the 100-meter side, it will divide the width of the field.
   - Let the length of the fence be \( x \).
   - The area of one part of the field will be \( 100 \times x = 2500 \).
   - Solving for \( x \), we get:
     \[
     100x = 2500 \implies x = \frac{2500}{100} = 25 \text{ meters}
     \]
   - So, the fence will be 25 meters long if parallel to the longer side.

4. **Case 2: Fence Parallel to the Shorter Side (50 meters):**
   - If the fence is parallel to the 50-meter side, it will divide the length of the field.
   - Let the length of the fence be \( y \).
   - The area of one part of the field will be \( 50 \times y = 2500 \).
   - Solving for \( y \), we get:
     \[
     50y = 2500 \implies y = \frac{2500}{50} = 50 \text{ meters}
     \]
   - So, the fence will be 50 meters long if parallel to the shorter side.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The farmer can construct a fence that is either 25 meters long (parallel to the longer side) or 50 meters long (parallel to the shorter side) to divide the field into two equal areas.

**Final Answer:**
The fence can be either 25 meters long or 50 meters long, depending on which side it is parallel to.
