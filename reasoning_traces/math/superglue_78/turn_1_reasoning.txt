==================================================

To solve the problem, we first need to understand what "Sample reasoning question 78" refers to. Since no specific details are provided about the content of this question, I'll demonstrate how to approach a generic math problem using a structured reasoning process. Let's assume a hypothetical math problem and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**
Calculate the value of \( x \) in the equation \( 3x + 7 = 22 \).

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   The equation given is \( 3x + 7 = 22 \). We need to find the value of \( x \) that satisfies this equation.

2. **Isolate the Variable:**
   To solve for \( x \), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We start by eliminating the constant term on the left side of the equation.

   \[
   3x + 7 = 22
   \]

   Subtract 7 from both sides to get:

   \[
   3x + 7 - 7 = 22 - 7
   \]

   Simplifying both sides gives:

   \[
   3x = 15
   \]

3. **Solve for \( x \):**
   Now, divide both sides by 3 to solve for \( x \).

   \[
   \frac{3x}{3} = \frac{15}{3}
   \]

   Simplifying both sides gives:

   \[
   x = 5
   \]

4. **Verify the Solution:**
   Substitute \( x = 5 \) back into the original equation to verify the solution.

   \[
   3(5) + 7 = 22
   \]

   Calculate the left side:

   \[
   15 + 7 = 22
   \]

   Since both sides of the equation are equal, our solution is verified.

5. **State the Final Answer:**
   The value of \( x \) that satisfies the equation \( 3x + 7 = 22 \) is \( x = 5 \).

By following these steps, we have solved the hypothetical problem and verified our solution. If you have a specific problem or question in mind, please provide more details, and I can assist you further.
