Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to define the dimensions of the rectangular plot based on the information given.

1. **Define Variables**:
   - Let the length of the short side of the rectangle be \( x \).
   - Since the long sides are three times the length of the short sides, the length of the long side will be \( 3x \).

2. **Calculate the Perimeter**:
   The perimeter \( P \) of a rectangle is given by the formula:
   \[
   P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width}) = 2 \times (3x + x) = 2 \times (4x) = 8x
   \]

3. **Set Up the Equation**:
   According to the problem, the total length of the fence (the perimeter) is 640 feet. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
   \[
   8x = 640
   \]

4. **Solve for \( x \)**:
   To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 8:
   \[
   x = \frac{640}{8} = 80
   \]

5. **Determine the Dimensions**:
   Now that we have \( x \):
   - The length of the short side is \( x = 80 \) feet.
   - The length of the long side is \( 3x = 3 \times 80 = 240 \) feet.

6. **Identify the Side to be Replaced**:
   The problem states that one short side of the fence is rusted and needs to be replaced. Since we have determined that the length of the short side is 80 feet, this is the length of the fence that needs to be replaced.

7. **Final Answer**:
   Therefore, the total length of the fence that needs to be replaced is:
   \[
   \boxed{80} \text{ feet}
   \]
