To solve this problem, we need to determine the length of the short side of the rectangular plot, as this is the side that needs to be replaced. We are given that the total perimeter of the fence is 640 feet and that the long sides are three times the length of the short sides.

Let's denote:
- \( x \) as the length of the short side of the rectangle.
- \( 3x \) as the length of the long side of the rectangle, since the long sides are three times the length of the short sides.

The rectangle has two short sides and two long sides. Therefore, the perimeter \( P \) of the rectangle can be expressed as:

\[
P = 2 \times (\text{short side}) + 2 \times (\text{long side})
\]

Substituting the expressions for the short and long sides, we have:

\[
P = 2x + 2(3x)
\]

Simplifying this expression gives:

\[
P = 2x + 6x = 8x
\]

We know from the problem statement that the total perimeter is 640 feet:

\[
8x = 640
\]

To find \( x \), we solve the equation by dividing both sides by 8:

\[
x = \frac{640}{8} = 80
\]

Thus, the length of the short side of the rectangle is 80 feet.

Since the problem states that one short side of the fence needs to be replaced, the length of the fence that needs to be replaced is exactly the length of one short side, which is:

\[
\boxed{80 \text{ feet}}
\]
