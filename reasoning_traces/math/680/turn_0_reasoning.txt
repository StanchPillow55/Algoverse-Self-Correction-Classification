==================================================

To determine how much the total weight of Jack and the 8 other adults exceeds the maximum load of the elevator, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total weight of the adults:**
   - Each adult weighs an average of 80 kg.
   - Jack is one of the adults, so there are a total of 9 adults (Jack + 8 others).
   - The total weight can be calculated using the formula:
     \[
     \text{Total Weight} = \text{Number of Adults} \times \text{Weight per Adult}
     \]
   - Substituting the values:
     \[
     \text{Total Weight} = 9 \times 80 \text{ kg} = 720 \text{ kg}
     \]

2. **Determine the maximum load of the elevator:**
   - The maximum load supported by the elevator is given as 700 kg.

3. **Calculate the excess weight:**
   - To find out how much the total weight exceeds the maximum load, we subtract the maximum load from the total weight:
     \[
     \text{Excess Weight} = \text{Total Weight} - \text{Maximum Load}
     \]
   - Substituting the values:
     \[
     \text{Excess Weight} = 720 \text{ kg} - 700 \text{ kg} = 20 \text{ kg}
     \]

4. **Final answer:**
   - The total weight of Jack and the 8 other adults exceeds the maximum load of the elevator by **20 kg**.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\text{The adults will have exceeded the maximum load of the elevator by } 20 \text{ kg.}
\]
