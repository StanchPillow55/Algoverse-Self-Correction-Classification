==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to determine how many cookies each of Susan's 6 nephews will receive after her husband takes 4 cookies for himself.

### Step 1: Calculate the total number of cookies after her husband takes some.

Susan originally made 100 cookies. However, her husband took 4 cookies for himself. We need to subtract the 4 cookies from the total:

\[
\text{Total cookies after husband takes some} = 100 - 4 = 96
\]

### Step 2: Divide the remaining cookies among the nephews.

Now that we know there are 96 cookies left, we need to divide these cookies equally among Susan's 6 nephews. To find out how many cookies each nephew will get, we perform the division:

\[
\text{Cookies per nephew} = \frac{96}{6}
\]

### Step 3: Perform the division.

Calculating the division:

\[
\frac{96}{6} = 16
\]

### Conclusion

Each of Susan's nephews will receive 16 cookies.

Thus, the final answer is:

**Each nephew gets 16 cookies.**
