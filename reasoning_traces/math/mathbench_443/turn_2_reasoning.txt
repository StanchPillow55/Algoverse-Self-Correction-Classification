Question ID: mathbench_443
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we first need to understand what "Sample math problem 443" refers to. Since the problem is not explicitly stated, I'll assume a generic math problem that involves basic arithmetic or algebra, as the number "443" doesn't specify a particular type of problem. 

Let's assume a hypothetical math problem involving the number 443. For example, let's solve the following problem:

**Problem:** What is the sum of the digits of the number 443?

**Step-by-step Solution:**

1. **Identify the digits of the number 443:**
   - The number 443 is composed of three digits: 4, 4, and 3.

2. **Add the digits together:**
   - Sum = 4 + 4 + 3

3. **Perform the addition:**
   - First, add the first two digits: 4 + 4 = 8
   - Then, add the result to the third digit: 8 + 3 = 11

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The sum of the digits of the number 443 is 11.

Thus, the final answer to the problem is 11.
