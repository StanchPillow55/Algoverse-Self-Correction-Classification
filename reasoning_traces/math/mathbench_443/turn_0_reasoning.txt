To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample math problem 443" refers to. Since there is no specific problem statement provided, I'll create a sample math problem and solve it step by step.

**Sample Math Problem 443:**

Calculate the area of a triangle with vertices at points A(2, 3), B(5, 11), and C(9, 7).

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

To find the area of a triangle given its vertices, we can use the formula derived from the determinant of a matrix:

\[
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \left| x_1(y_2-y_3) + x_2(y_3-y_1) + x_3(y_1-y_2) \right|
\]

where \((x_1, y_1)\), \((x_2, y_2)\), and \((x_3, y_3)\) are the coordinates of the vertices A, B, and C, respectively.

Given:
- \(A(2, 3)\) implies \(x_1 = 2\), \(y_1 = 3\)
- \(B(5, 11)\) implies \(x_2 = 5\), \(y_2 = 11\)
- \(C(9, 7)\) implies \(x_3 = 9\), \(y_3 = 7\)

Substitute these values into the formula:

\[
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \left| 2(11-7) + 5(7-3) + 9(3-11) \right|
\]

Calculate each term inside the absolute value:

1. \(2(11-7) = 2 \times 4 = 8\)
2. \(5(7-3) = 5 \times 4 = 20\)
3. \(9(3-11) = 9 \times (-8) = -72\)

Now, substitute these values back into the formula:

\[
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \left| 8 + 20 - 72 \right|
\]

Simplify inside the absolute value:

\[
8 + 20 - 72 = 28 - 72 = -44
\]

Take the absolute value:

\[
|-44| = 44
\]

Finally, calculate the area:

\[
\text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times 44 = 22
\]

Thus, the area of the triangle is \(22\) square units.

**Final Answer:**

The area of the triangle with vertices at points A(2, 3), B(5, 11), and C(9, 7) is \(22\) square units.
