Question ID: 685
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To find out how much Catherine pays in total at the grocery store, we will calculate the cost of each type of fruit she buys and then sum those amounts.

1. **Cost of Apples:**
   - Catherine buys 1 kilo of apples for $4.
   - Total cost for apples = 1 kilo × $4/kilo = $4.

2. **Cost of Bananas:**
   - Catherine buys 2 kilos of bananas at $2 per kilo.
   - Total cost for bananas = 2 kilos × $2/kilo = $4.

3. **Cost of Oranges:**
   - Catherine buys 2 kilos of oranges at $3 per kilo.
   - Total cost for oranges = 2 kilos × $3/kilo = $6.

4. **Total Cost:**
   - Now, we will add the costs of all the fruits together:
   \[
   \text{Total Cost} = \text{Cost of Apples} + \text{Cost of Bananas} + \text{Cost of Oranges}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total Cost} = $4 + $4 + $6 = $14.
   \]

Therefore, Catherine pays a total of **$14**.
