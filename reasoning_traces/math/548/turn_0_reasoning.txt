Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To find Mark's initial weight, we need to consider the weight he lost during the 3 months he was unwell and his final weight.

1. **Determine the total weight lost**: 
   Mark lost 10 pounds each month for 3 months. 
   \[
   \text{Total weight lost} = \text{Weight lost per month} \times \text{Number of months} = 10 \, \text{pounds/month} \times 3 \, \text{months} = 30 \, \text{pounds}
   \]

2. **Identify Mark's final weight**: 
   According to the problem, Mark's final weight after losing the weight is 70 pounds.

3. **Calculate Mark's initial weight**: 
   To find the initial weight, we need to add the total weight lost back to his final weight.
   \[
   \text{Initial weight} = \text{Final weight} + \text{Total weight lost} = 70 \, \text{pounds} + 30 \, \text{pounds} = 100 \, \text{pounds}
   \]

Thus, Mark's initial weight was \( \boxed{100} \) pounds.
