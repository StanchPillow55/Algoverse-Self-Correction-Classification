Question ID: 626
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To convert Ashley's internet connection speed from kilobits per second (kb/s) to megabits per hour (Mb/h), we will follow these steps:

1. **Understand the Units**: 
   - Ashley's internet speed is given as 20 kb/s.
   - We know that 1 Mb = 1000 kb.
   - We need to convert the speed from kb/s to Mb/h.

2. **Convert kb/s to Mb/s**:
   - Since 1 Mb = 1000 kb, we can convert kilobits to megabits by dividing the speed in kb/s by 1000.
   \[
   \text{Speed in Mb/s} = \frac{20 \text{ kb/s}}{1000} = 0.02 \text{ Mb/s}
   \]

3. **Convert seconds to hours**:
   - There are 3600 seconds in an hour (60 seconds per minute × 60 minutes per hour).
   - To find the speed in Mb/h, we multiply the speed in Mb/s by the number of seconds in an hour.
   \[
   \text{Speed in Mb/h} = 0.02 \text{ Mb/s} \times 3600 \text{ s/h}
   \]

4. **Calculate the speed in Mb/h**:
   \[
   \text{Speed in Mb/h} = 0.02 \times 3600 = 72 \text{ Mb/h}
   \]

5. **Final Answer**:
   - Therefore, Ashley’s internet connection speed is **72 Mb/h**.

In conclusion, Ashley's internet connection speed is **72 megabits per hour**.
