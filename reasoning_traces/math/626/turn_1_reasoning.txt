Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To convert Ashley's internet connection speed from kilobits per second (kb/s) to megabits per hour (Mb/h), we will follow these steps:

1. **Understand the conversion factors**:
   - We know that 1 megabit (Mb) is equal to 1000 kilobits (kb).
   - We also need to convert seconds to hours. There are 3600 seconds in 1 hour (60 seconds per minute × 60 minutes per hour).

2. **Convert kb/s to Mb/s**:
   - Ashley's internet speed is 20 kb/s.
   - To convert this to megabits per second, we use the conversion factor:
     \[
     \text{Speed in Mb/s} = \frac{\text{Speed in kb/s}}{1000}
     \]
   - Substituting the values:
     \[
     \text{Speed in Mb/s} = \frac{20 \text{ kb/s}}{1000} = 0.02 \text{ Mb/s}
     \]

3. **Convert Mb/s to Mb/h**:
   - Now we need to convert the speed from megabits per second to megabits per hour. Since there are 3600 seconds in an hour, we multiply the speed in Mb/s by 3600:
     \[
     \text{Speed in Mb/h} = \text{Speed in Mb/s} \times 3600
     \]
   - Substituting the values:
     \[
     \text{Speed in Mb/h} = 0.02 \text{ Mb/s} \times 3600
     \]

4. **Calculate the final speed**:
   - Performing the multiplication:
     \[
     \text{Speed in Mb/h} = 0.02 \times 3600 = 72 \text{ Mb/h}
     \]

Thus, Ashley’s internet connection speed is **72 megabits per hour**.

Final Answer: **72 Mb/h**
