To determine how long a 42 kg bag of rice will last for a household of 5 members consuming rice at every lunch and dinner, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total rice consumption per meal for the household:**
   Each person consumes 0.2 kg of rice per meal. Therefore, for 5 members:
   \[
   \text{Total consumption per meal} = 5 \text{ members} \times 0.2 \text{ kg/member} = 1 \text{ kg}
   \]

2. **Calculate the total rice consumption per day:**
   Since the household eats rice for both lunch and dinner, there are 2 meals per day. Thus, the total consumption per day is:
   \[
   \text{Total consumption per day} = 1 \text{ kg/meal} \times 2 \text{ meals/day} = 2 \text{ kg/day}
   \]

3. **Calculate how many days the 42 kg bag of rice will last:**
   To find out how many days the 42 kg bag will last, we divide the total amount of rice by the daily consumption:
   \[
   \text{Days the rice will last} = \frac{42 \text{ kg}}{2 \text{ kg/day}} = 21 \text{ days}
   \]

4. **Convert days into weeks:**
   Since there are 7 days in a week, we can convert the total days into weeks:
   \[
   \text{Weeks the rice will last} = \frac{21 \text{ days}}{7 \text{ days/week}} = 3 \text{ weeks}
   \]

Thus, the final answer is that the 42 kg bag of rice will last for **3 weeks**.
