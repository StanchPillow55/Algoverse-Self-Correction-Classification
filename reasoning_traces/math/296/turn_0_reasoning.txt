==================================================

To solve the problem, we will follow these steps:

1. **Determine how much sugar is in each bag.**
   Chelsea has a total of 24 kilos of sugar, and she divides it into 4 bags equally. To find out how much sugar is in each bag, we divide the total amount of sugar by the number of bags:

   \[
   \text{Sugar per bag} = \frac{\text{Total sugar}}{\text{Number of bags}} = \frac{24 \text{ kilos}}{4} = 6 \text{ kilos}
   \]

   So, each bag contains 6 kilos of sugar.

2. **Calculate the amount of sugar that falls when one bag is torn.**
   When one of the bags gets torn, half of the sugar in that bag falls to the ground. Since each bag contains 6 kilos, we need to find half of that amount:

   \[
   \text{Sugar that falls} = \frac{1}{2} \times 6 \text{ kilos} = 3 \text{ kilos}
   \]

3. **Determine how much sugar remains after the loss.**
   After half of the sugar from the torn bag falls to the ground, we need to calculate how much sugar remains. Initially, Chelsea had 24 kilos of sugar. After losing 3 kilos, the remaining amount of sugar is:

   \[
   \text{Remaining sugar} = \text{Initial sugar} - \text{Sugar that falls} = 24 \text{ kilos} - 3 \text{ kilos} = 21 \text{ kilos}
   \]

4. **Final answer.**
   Therefore, the total amount of sugar that remains after one bag gets torn and half of its sugar falls to the ground is:

   \[
   \boxed{21} \text{ kilos}
   \]
