==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to follow the steps outlined in the question and perform the necessary calculations.

1. **Initial Division of Sugar:**
   - Chelsea starts with 24 kilos of sugar.
   - She divides the sugar equally into 4 bags.
   - To find out how much sugar is in each bag, we divide the total amount of sugar by the number of bags:
     \[
     \text{Sugar per bag} = \frac{24 \text{ kilos}}{4 \text{ bags}} = 6 \text{ kilos per bag}
     \]
   - So, each bag contains 6 kilos of sugar.

2. **Incident with the Torn Bag:**
   - One of the bags gets torn, and half of the sugar in that bag falls to the ground.
   - Since each bag contains 6 kilos of sugar, half of this amount is:
     \[
     \text{Sugar lost from torn bag} = \frac{6 \text{ kilos}}{2} = 3 \text{ kilos}
     \]
   - Therefore, 3 kilos of sugar are lost from the torn bag.

3. **Calculating Remaining Sugar:**
   - Initially, Chelsea had 24 kilos of sugar.
   - She loses 3 kilos due to the torn bag.
   - To find out how much sugar remains, we subtract the lost sugar from the initial total:
     \[
     \text{Remaining sugar} = 24 \text{ kilos} - 3 \text{ kilos} = 21 \text{ kilos}
     \]

Thus, after the incident with the torn bag, Chelsea has 21 kilos of sugar remaining.

**Final Answer:**
21 kilos of sugar remain.
