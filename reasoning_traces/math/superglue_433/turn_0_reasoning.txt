==================================================

To solve the problem, I'll need more specific information about "Sample reasoning question 433." Since the problem isn't provided, I'll demonstrate how to approach a typical math reasoning problem by creating an example problem and solving it step-by-step.

**Example Problem:**

A train travels from City A to City B at a speed of 60 miles per hour. It then returns from City B to City A at a speed of 40 miles per hour. The total travel time for the round trip is 5 hours. What is the distance between City A and City B?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( d \) be the distance between City A and City B in miles.

2. **Set Up Equations:**
   - The time taken to travel from City A to City B is given by the formula: 
     \[
     \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{d}{60}
     \]
   - The time taken to travel back from City B to City A is:
     \[
     \frac{d}{40}
     \]

3. **Total Travel Time:**
   - According to the problem, the total travel time for the round trip is 5 hours. Therefore, we can write the equation:
     \[
     \frac{d}{60} + \frac{d}{40} = 5
     \]

4. **Solve the Equation:**
   - To solve this equation, first find a common denominator for the fractions. The least common multiple of 60 and 40 is 120.
   - Rewrite the equation with the common denominator:
     \[
     \frac{2d}{120} + \frac{3d}{120} = 5
     \]
   - Combine the fractions:
     \[
     \frac{5d}{120} = 5
     \]
   - Multiply both sides by 120 to eliminate the fraction:
     \[
     5d = 600
     \]
   - Divide both sides by 5 to solve for \( d \):
     \[
     d = 120
     \]

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The distance between City A and City B is 120 miles.

**Final Answer:**
The distance between City A and City B is 120 miles.
