==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 433" entails. Since the question is not explicitly provided, I'll demonstrate a general approach to solving a typical math reasoning problem. Let's assume a hypothetical problem and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**

A train travels from City A to City B at a speed of 60 miles per hour. The distance between City A and City B is 180 miles. After reaching City B, the train takes a 30-minute break and then returns to City A at a speed of 90 miles per hour. Calculate the total time taken for the entire journey, including the break.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Calculate the time taken to travel from City A to City B:**

   - **Distance from City A to City B:** 180 miles
   - **Speed from City A to City B:** 60 miles per hour

   \[
   \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{180 \text{ miles}}{60 \text{ miles per hour}} = 3 \text{ hours}
   \]

2. **Calculate the break time at City B:**

   - The train takes a 30-minute break at City B. Since time is usually calculated in hours, convert 30 minutes to hours:

   \[
   30 \text{ minutes} = 0.5 \text{ hours}
   \]

3. **Calculate the time taken to travel from City B back to City A:**

   - **Speed from City B to City A:** 90 miles per hour

   \[
   \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{180 \text{ miles}}{90 \text{ miles per hour}} = 2 \text{ hours}
   \]

4. **Calculate the total time for the entire journey:**

   - Add the time taken for each leg of the journey and the break time:

   \[
   \text{Total Time} = \text{Time from A to B} + \text{Break Time} + \text{Time from B to A}
   \]

   \[
   \text{Total Time} = 3 \text{ hours} + 0.5 \text{ hours} + 2 \text{ hours} = 5.5 \text{ hours}
   \]

**Final Answer:**

The total time taken for the entire journey, including the break, is 5.5 hours.
