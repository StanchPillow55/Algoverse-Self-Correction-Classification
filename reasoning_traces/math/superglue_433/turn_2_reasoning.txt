Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what the question is asking. However, the question provided is "Sample reasoning question 433," which does not contain any specific mathematical problem or context to solve. Therefore, I will demonstrate how to approach a typical math problem by creating a sample problem and solving it step by step.

**Sample Problem:**

Calculate the area of a triangle with a base of 10 units and a height of 5 units.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Formula:**
   The formula to calculate the area of a triangle is:
   \[
   \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height}
   \]

2. **Identify the Given Values:**
   From the problem, we know:
   - Base (\(b\)) = 10 units
   - Height (\(h\)) = 5 units

3. **Substitute the Values into the Formula:**
   Substitute the given values for the base and height into the area formula:
   \[
   \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times 10 \times 5
   \]

4. **Perform the Multiplication:**
   First, multiply the base and height:
   \[
   10 \times 5 = 50
   \]

5. **Calculate the Area:**
   Now, multiply the result by \(\frac{1}{2}\):
   \[
   \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times 50 = 25
   \]

6. **State the Final Answer:**
   The area of the triangle is 25 square units.

By following these steps, we have calculated the area of the triangle. If you have a specific problem or question in mind, please provide more details so I can assist you accordingly.
