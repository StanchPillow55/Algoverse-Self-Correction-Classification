Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem effectively, I need more specific information about "Sample reasoning question 433." Since the question is not provided, I'll demonstrate how to approach a generic math problem step-by-step. Let's assume a sample math problem and solve it.

**Sample Problem:**
Calculate the area of a right triangle with a base of 6 cm and a height of 8 cm.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We need to find the area of a right triangle.
   - The formula for the area of a triangle is: 
     \[
     \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height}
     \]

2. **Identify the Given Values:**
   - Base (\(b\)) = 6 cm
   - Height (\(h\)) = 8 cm

3. **Substitute the Values into the Formula:**
   - Plug the values of the base and height into the area formula:
     \[
     \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times 6 \, \text{cm} \times 8 \, \text{cm}
     \]

4. **Perform the Calculations:**
   - First, multiply the base and height:
     \[
     6 \, \text{cm} \times 8 \, \text{cm} = 48 \, \text{cm}^2
     \]
   - Then, multiply by \(\frac{1}{2}\):
     \[
     \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times 48 \, \text{cm}^2 = 24 \, \text{cm}^2
     \]

5. **State the Final Answer:**
   - The area of the right triangle is \(24 \, \text{cm}^2\).

This is a complete solution to the sample problem. If you have a specific problem labeled "Sample reasoning question 433," please provide the details, and I can work through that specific problem.
