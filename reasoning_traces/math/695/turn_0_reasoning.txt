==================================================

To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the total number of bucks:**
   We know that there are 50 deer in total, and 50 percent of them are bucks. To find the number of bucks, we calculate:

   \[
   \text{Number of bucks} = 50 \times 0.50 = 25
   \]

   So, there are 25 bucks in the field.

2. **Determine the number of 8 point bucks:**
   Next, we are told that 20 percent of the bucks are 8 points. To find the number of 8 point bucks, we calculate:

   \[
   \text{Number of 8 point bucks} = 25 \times 0.20 = 5
   \]

   Therefore, there are 5 bucks that are 8 points.

3. **Final answer:**
   After performing the calculations, we find that the number of 8 point bucks is:

   \[
   \boxed{5}
   \]
