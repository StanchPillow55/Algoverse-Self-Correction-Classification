To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of money Daniel spent on his entire video game collection. We will break down the problem into steps based on the information provided.

1. **Determine the number of games bought at each price point:**

   - Daniel has a total of 346 video games.
   - He bought 80 games at $12 each.

2. **Calculate the number of games bought at the other price points:**

   - Subtract the 80 games bought for $12 each from the total number of games:
     \[
     346 - 80 = 266
     \]
   - Of these 266 games, 50% were bought for $7 each. Calculate 50% of 266:
     \[
     \frac{266}{2} = 133
     \]
   - The remaining games were bought for $3 each. Calculate the number of these games:
     \[
     266 - 133 = 133
     \]

3. **Calculate the total cost for each group of games:**

   - **Games bought for $12 each:**
     \[
     80 \times 12 = 960
     \]
   - **Games bought for $7 each:**
     \[
     133 \times 7 = 931
     \]
   - **Games bought for $3 each:**
     \[
     133 \times 3 = 399
     \]

4. **Calculate the total amount spent on all games:**

   Add the total costs from each group:
   \[
   960 + 931 + 399 = 2290
   \]

Therefore, Daniel spent a total of $2290 on all the games in his collection.

**Final Answer:**
Daniel spent $2290 on all the games in his collection.
