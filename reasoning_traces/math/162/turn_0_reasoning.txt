To determine the cost of a bag of marbles after 36 months, given that the price increases by 20% of the original price every two months, we can follow these steps:

1. **Identify the original price and the percentage increase**:
   - Original price of the bag of marbles = $20
   - Percentage increase every two months = 20% of the original price

2. **Calculate the amount of increase every two months**:
   - 20% of $20 = 0.20 × 20 = $4
   - Therefore, every two months, the price of the bag of marbles increases by $4.

3. **Determine how many two-month periods are in 36 months**:
   - Total months = 36
   - Number of two-month periods = 36 months / 2 months per period = 18 periods

4. **Calculate the total increase over 36 months**:
   - Total increase = Increase per period × Number of periods
   - Total increase = $4 × 18 = $72

5. **Calculate the final price after 36 months**:
   - Final price = Original price + Total increase
   - Final price = $20 + $72 = $92

Thus, after 36 months, the cost of a bag of marbles would be **$92**.

Final answer: **$92**
