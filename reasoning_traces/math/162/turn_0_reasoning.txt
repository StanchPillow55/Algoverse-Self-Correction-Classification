To find out how much Daniel spent on all the video games in his collection, we will break down the problem step by step.

1. **Identify the total number of video games**: 
   Daniel has a total of 346 video games.

2. **Calculate the number of games bought for $12**: 
   Daniel bought 80 games for $12 each.

   \[
   \text{Cost for games bought at } \$12 = 80 \times 12 = 960
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of remaining games**: 
   After accounting for the 80 games, we find the number of remaining games:

   \[
   \text{Remaining games} = 346 - 80 = 266
   \]

4. **Determine how many of the remaining games were bought for $7**: 
   According to the problem, 50% of the remaining games were bought for $7. So, we calculate 50% of 266:

   \[
   \text{Games bought at } \$7 = 0.5 \times 266 = 133
   \]

5. **Calculate the cost for games bought at $7**: 
   Now we calculate the total cost for the 133 games bought at $7:

   \[
   \text{Cost for games bought at } \$7 = 133 \times 7 = 931
   \]

6. **Determine the number of games bought for $3**: 
   The rest of the games were bought for $3 each. We first find out how many games were bought for $3:

   \[
   \text{Games bought at } \$3 = \text{Remaining games} - \text{Games bought at } \$7 = 266 - 133 = 133
   \]

7. **Calculate the cost for games bought at $3**: 
   Now we calculate the total cost for the 133 games bought at $3:

   \[
   \text{Cost for games bought at } \$3 = 133 \times 3 = 399
   \]

8. **Calculate the total cost for all games**: 
   Finally, we sum the costs of all the games:

   \[
   \text{Total cost} = \text{Cost for games at } \$12 + \text{Cost for games at } \$7 + \text{Cost for games at } \$3
   \]

   \[
   \text{Total cost} = 960 + 931 + 399
   \]

   \[
   \text{Total cost} = 2290
   \]

Thus, the total amount Daniel spent on all the games in his collection is \(\boxed{2290}\).
