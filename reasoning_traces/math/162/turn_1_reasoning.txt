To determine how much Daniel spent on all the games in his collection, we need to break down the problem into parts and calculate the cost for each part.

1. **Determine the number of games bought at each price:**

   - Daniel has a total of 346 video games.
   - 80 of these games were bought for $12 each.

   First, calculate the number of games that were not bought for $12:
   \[
   346 - 80 = 266
   \]
   So, 266 games were bought at either $7 or $3.

   - Of these 266 games, 50% were bought for $7 each.

   Calculate 50% of 266:
   \[
   \frac{266}{2} = 133
   \]
   So, 133 games were bought for $7 each.

   - The remaining games were bought for $3 each.

   Calculate the number of games bought for $3:
   \[
   266 - 133 = 133
   \]
   So, 133 games were bought for $3 each.

2. **Calculate the total cost for each group of games:**

   - **Games bought for $12 each:**
     \[
     80 \times 12 = 960
     \]
     Daniel spent $960 on the games bought for $12 each.

   - **Games bought for $7 each:**
     \[
     133 \times 7 = 931
     \]
     Daniel spent $931 on the games bought for $7 each.

   - **Games bought for $3 each:**
     \[
     133 \times 3 = 399
     \]
     Daniel spent $399 on the games bought for $3 each.

3. **Calculate the total amount spent on all games:**

   Add up the total costs for each group:
   \[
   960 + 931 + 399 = 2290
   \]

Therefore, Daniel spent a total of $2290 on all the games in his collection.

**Final Answer:**
Daniel spent $2290 on all the games in his collection.
