==================================================

To determine the cost of a bag of marbles after 36 months given that the price increases by 20% of the original price every two months, we can follow these steps:

1. **Identify the original price and the increase**:
   - Original price of the bag of marbles = $20
   - Increase every two months = 20% of the original price = 0.20 × $20 = $4

2. **Determine the number of two-month periods in 36 months**:
   - Total months = 36
   - Number of two-month periods = 36 months / 2 months = 18 periods

3. **Calculate the total increase over 36 months**:
   - Total increase = Increase per period × Number of periods
   - Total increase = $4 × 18 = $72

4. **Calculate the final price after 36 months**:
   - Final price = Original price + Total increase
   - Final price = $20 + $72 = $92

Thus, the cost of a bag of marbles after 36 months is **$92**.
