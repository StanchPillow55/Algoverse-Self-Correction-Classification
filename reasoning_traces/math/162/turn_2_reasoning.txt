Question ID: 162
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To determine the cost of a bag of marbles after 36 months, given that the price increases by 20% of the original price every two months, we can follow these steps:

1. **Identify the original price and the increase**:
   - Original price of the bag of marbles = $20
   - Increase every two months = 20% of $20

   \[
   \text{Increase} = 0.20 \times 20 = 4 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Determine the number of two-month periods in 36 months**:
   - Total months = 36
   - Number of two-month periods = \( \frac{36}{2} = 18 \)

3. **Calculate the total increase over 36 months**:
   - Total increase after 18 periods = Increase per period Ã— Number of periods

   \[
   \text{Total increase} = 4 \times 18 = 72 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Calculate the final cost of the bag of marbles**:
   - Final cost = Original price + Total increase

   \[
   \text{Final cost} = 20 + 72 = 92 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Thus, the cost of a bag of marbles after 36 months is **$92**.
