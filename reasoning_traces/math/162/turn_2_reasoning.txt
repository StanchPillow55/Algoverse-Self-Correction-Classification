==================================================

To determine how much Daniel spent on all the games in his collection, we need to break down the problem into manageable parts and calculate the total cost step by step.

1. **Identify the number of games in each price category:**

   - Daniel has a total of 346 video games.
   - He bought 80 games for $12 each.

2. **Calculate the number of games remaining after accounting for the $12 games:**

   \[
   \text{Total games} = 346
   \]
   \[
   \text{Games bought for $12 each} = 80
   \]
   \[
   \text{Remaining games} = 346 - 80 = 266
   \]

3. **Determine how many of the remaining games were bought for $7 each:**

   - 50% of the remaining 266 games were bought for $7 each.

   \[
   \text{Games bought for $7 each} = 0.5 \times 266 = 133
   \]

4. **Calculate the number of games bought for $3 each:**

   - The rest of the games were bought for $3 each.

   \[
   \text{Games bought for $3 each} = 266 - 133 = 133
   \]

5. **Calculate the total cost for each category of games:**

   - **Cost of games bought for $12 each:**

     \[
     \text{Cost for $12 games} = 80 \times 12 = 960
     \]

   - **Cost of games bought for $7 each:**

     \[
     \text{Cost for $7 games} = 133 \times 7 = 931
     \]

   - **Cost of games bought for $3 each:**

     \[
     \text{Cost for $3 games} = 133 \times 3 = 399
     \]

6. **Calculate the total amount spent on all games:**

   \[
   \text{Total cost} = 960 + 931 + 399 = 2290
   \]

Therefore, Daniel spent a total of $2290 on all the games in his collection.

**Final Answer: $2290**
