==================================================

Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial Count of Marbles**: Brendan starts with 10 marbles in his bag.

2. **Dropping Marbles**: He trips and drops half of the marbles. To find out how many he dropped, we calculate half of 10:
   \[
   \text{Marbles dropped} = \frac{10}{2} = 5
   \]
   After dropping 5 marbles, he has:
   \[
   \text{Remaining marbles} = 10 - 5 = 5
   \]

3. **Searching for Marbles**: Brendan searches for the marbles he dropped and finds 3 of them. This means he has now found 3 marbles in addition to the 5 he still has:
   \[
   \text{Total marbles after finding} = 5 + 3 = 8
   \]

4. **Identifying a Non-Marble**: Upon inspecting the marbles further, he discovers that one of the marbles he found is actually a bead. Therefore, he needs to remove this bead from his total count of marbles:
   \[
   \text{Marbles after removing bead} = 8 - 1 = 7
   \]

5. **Final Count of Marbles**: After all these steps, the final count of marbles that Brendan ends up with is 7.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{7}
\]
