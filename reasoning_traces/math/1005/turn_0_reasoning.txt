To solve the problem, we will follow these steps:

1. **Determine the number of female porcupines.**
2. **Calculate the number of babies born each month.**
3. **Calculate the total number of porcupines after one year.**

### Step 1: Determine the number of female porcupines

The total population of porcupines in the park is given as 50. The number of female porcupines is \( \frac{3}{5} \) of the total population.

\[
\text{Number of female porcupines} = \frac{3}{5} \times 50
\]

Calculating this:

\[
\text{Number of female porcupines} = \frac{3 \times 50}{5} = \frac{150}{5} = 30
\]

So, there are 30 female porcupines.

### Step 2: Calculate the number of babies born each month

Each female porcupine gives birth to 4 babies every month. Therefore, the total number of babies born each month can be calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Total babies born each month} = \text{Number of female porcupines} \times \text{Babies per female}
\]

Substituting the values we have:

\[
\text{Total babies born each month} = 30 \times 4 = 120
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the total number of porcupines after one year

There are 12 months in a year, so the total number of babies born in a year is:

\[
\text{Total babies born in a year} = \text{Total babies born each month} \times 12
\]

Calculating this:

\[
\text{Total babies born in a year} = 120 \times 12 = 1440
\]

Now, we need to find the total population after one year. We add the original population to the total number of babies born in a year:

\[
\text{Total population after one year} = \text{Original population} + \text{Total babies born in a year}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\text{Total population after one year} = 50 + 1440 = 1490
\]

### Final Answer

The total number of porcupines in the park after one year will be **1490**.
