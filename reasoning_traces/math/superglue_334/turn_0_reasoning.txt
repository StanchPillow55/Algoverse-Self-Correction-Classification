To solve the problem, I need more specific information or details about "Sample reasoning question 334." Since the question is not provided, I'll demonstrate how to approach a typical math problem step-by-step. If you have a specific problem in mind, please provide the details.

Let's assume a sample math problem:

**Problem:**  
A car travels 150 miles in 3 hours. What is the average speed of the car in miles per hour?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We need to find the average speed of the car.
   - We know the total distance traveled is 150 miles.
   - The total time taken is 3 hours.

2. **Identify the Formula:**
   - The formula for average speed is:
     \[
     \text{Average Speed} = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Total Time}}
     \]

3. **Substitute the Known Values:**
   - Total Distance = 150 miles
   - Total Time = 3 hours
   - Substitute these values into the formula:
     \[
     \text{Average Speed} = \frac{150 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ hours}}
     \]

4. **Perform the Calculation:**
   - Divide 150 by 3:
     \[
     \text{Average Speed} = 50 \text{ miles per hour}
     \]

5. **Verify the Solution:**
   - Check if the units make sense: miles per hour is a unit of speed.
   - Recalculate to ensure no arithmetic errors.

6. **State the Final Answer:**
   - The average speed of the car is 50 miles per hour.
