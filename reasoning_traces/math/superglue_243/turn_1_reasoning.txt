==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 243" refers to. Since the question is not explicitly provided, I'll assume this is a placeholder for a typical math problem. Let's create a hypothetical math problem and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**

A company produces widgets. The cost to produce \( x \) widgets is given by the function \( C(x) = 5x + 200 \), where \( C(x) \) is the total cost in dollars. The revenue generated from selling \( x \) widgets is given by the function \( R(x) = 12x \). The company wants to determine how many widgets they need to sell to break even.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We need to find the number of widgets, \( x \), where the cost equals the revenue. This is known as the break-even point.

2. **Set Up the Equation:**
   - At the break-even point, the cost equals the revenue:
     \[
     C(x) = R(x)
     \]
   - Substitute the given functions into the equation:
     \[
     5x + 200 = 12x
     \]

3. **Solve for \( x \):**
   - First, get all terms involving \( x \) on one side of the equation:
     \[
     200 = 12x - 5x
     \]
   - Simplify the equation:
     \[
     200 = 7x
     \]
   - Solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides by 7:
     \[
     x = \frac{200}{7}
     \]
   - Calculate the value:
     \[
     x \approx 28.57
     \]

4. **Interpret the Result:**
   - Since \( x \) represents the number of widgets, and you can't sell a fraction of a widget, the company needs to sell at least 29 widgets to break even.

5. **Verify the Solution:**
   - Calculate the cost and revenue for \( x = 29 \):
     \[
     C(29) = 5(29) + 200 = 145 + 200 = 345
     \]
     \[
     R(29) = 12(29) = 348
     \]
   - Since \( R(29) > C(29) \), selling 29 widgets results in a profit, confirming that selling 28 widgets would not cover the costs.

**Final Answer:**

The company needs to sell at least 29 widgets to break even.
