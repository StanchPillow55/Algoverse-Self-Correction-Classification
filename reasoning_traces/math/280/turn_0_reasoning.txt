To find out how much Peter paid in total for the popsicles and ice cream bars, we can break the problem down into two parts: calculating the total cost of the popsicles and the total cost of the ice cream bars, and then adding those two amounts together.

**Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the popsicles.**

Peter purchased 20 popsicles at a price of $0.25 each. To find the total cost of the popsicles, we multiply the number of popsicles by the price per popsicle:

\[
\text{Total cost of popsicles} = \text{Number of popsicles} \times \text{Price per popsicle}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\text{Total cost of popsicles} = 20 \times 0.25
\]

Calculating this:

\[
20 \times 0.25 = 5.00
\]

So, the total cost of the popsicles is **$5.00**.

**Step 2: Calculate the total cost of the ice cream bars.**

Peter also purchased 4 ice cream bars at a price of $0.50 each. To find the total cost of the ice cream bars, we use the same method:

\[
\text{Total cost of ice cream bars} = \text{Number of ice cream bars} \times \text{Price per ice cream bar}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\text{Total cost of ice cream bars} = 4 \times 0.50
\]

Calculating this:

\[
4 \times 0.50 = 2.00
\]

So, the total cost of the ice cream bars is **$2.00**.

**Step 3: Calculate the total amount paid.**

Now, we add the total cost of the popsicles and the total cost of the ice cream bars together to find the total amount Peter paid:

\[
\text{Total amount paid} = \text{Total cost of popsicles} + \text{Total cost of ice cream bars}
\]

Substituting the values we calculated:

\[
\text{Total amount paid} = 5.00 + 2.00
\]

Calculating this:

\[
5.00 + 2.00 = 7.00
\]

Therefore, the total amount Peter paid is **$7.00**.

**Final Answer:**
Peter paid a total of **$7.00**.
