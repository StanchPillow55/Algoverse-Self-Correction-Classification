To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of the cards the boy bought from each box and then add these amounts together to get the total cost.

**Step 1: Calculate the cost of cards from the first box.**

- The first box contains cards that cost $1.25 each.
- The boy buys 6 cards from this box.

To find the total cost of the cards from the first box, we multiply the number of cards by the cost per card:

\[
\text{Cost from first box} = 6 \times 1.25
\]

Calculating this:

\[
6 \times 1.25 = 7.50
\]

So, the total cost of the cards from the first box is $7.50.

**Step 2: Calculate the cost of cards from the second box.**

- The second box contains cards that cost $1.75 each.
- The boy buys 6 cards from this box.

To find the total cost of the cards from the second box, we multiply the number of cards by the cost per card:

\[
\text{Cost from second box} = 6 \times 1.75
\]

Calculating this:

\[
6 \times 1.75 = 10.50
\]

So, the total cost of the cards from the second box is $10.50.

**Step 3: Calculate the total cost of all the cards.**

Now, we add the total costs from both boxes to find the overall total cost:

\[
\text{Total cost} = 7.50 + 10.50
\]

Calculating this:

\[
7.50 + 10.50 = 18.00
\]

Therefore, the total cost of all the cards the boy bought is $18.00.

**Final Answer:**

The total cost, in dollars, of the cards the boy bought is $18.00.
