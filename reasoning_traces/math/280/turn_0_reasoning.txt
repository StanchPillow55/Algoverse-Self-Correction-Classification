To find the total cost of the cards the boy bought, we need to calculate the cost of the cards from each box separately and then sum those costs.

1. **Calculate the cost of cards from the first box:**
   - The first box contains cards that cost $1.25 each.
   - The boy buys 6 cards from this box.
   - The total cost for the cards from the first box can be calculated as follows:
     \[
     \text{Cost from first box} = \text{Number of cards} \times \text{Cost per card}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Cost from first box} = 6 \times 1.25
     \]
     \[
     \text{Cost from first box} = 7.50
     \]

2. **Calculate the cost of cards from the second box:**
   - The second box contains cards that cost $1.75 each.
   - The boy also buys 6 cards from this box.
   - The total cost for the cards from the second box can be calculated as follows:
     \[
     \text{Cost from second box} = \text{Number of cards} \times \text{Cost per card}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Cost from second box} = 6 \times 1.75
     \]
     \[
     \text{Cost from second box} = 10.50
     \]

3. **Calculate the total cost of all cards:**
   - Now, we need to sum the costs from both boxes to find the total cost:
     \[
     \text{Total cost} = \text{Cost from first box} + \text{Cost from second box}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total cost} = 7.50 + 10.50
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total cost} = 18.00
     \]

Thus, the total cost of the cards the boy bought is \(\boxed{18.00}\) dollars.
