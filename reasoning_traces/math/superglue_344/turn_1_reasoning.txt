==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to understand what "Sample reasoning question 344" refers to. Since the question is not explicitly stated, I'll assume it's a placeholder for a typical math problem. Let's create a sample math problem and solve it step by step.

**Sample Problem:**

A farmer has a rectangular field that is 120 meters long and 80 meters wide. He wants to divide the field into smaller, equal-sized square plots. What is the largest possible side length of each square plot?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We have a rectangular field with dimensions 120 meters by 80 meters.
   - We need to divide this field into square plots of equal size.
   - We are looking for the largest possible side length of these square plots.

2. **Identify the Mathematical Concept:**
   - The problem requires finding the largest square that can fit into both the length and the width of the rectangle.
   - This is equivalent to finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the two dimensions.

3. **Calculate the GCD:**
   - The dimensions of the rectangle are 120 meters and 80 meters.
   - We find the GCD of 120 and 80.

4. **Use the Euclidean Algorithm:**
   - The Euclidean algorithm is a method for finding the GCD of two numbers.
   - Start with the larger number (120) and divide it by the smaller number (80).

   \[
   120 \div 80 = 1 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 40
   \]

   - Replace the larger number with the smaller number and the smaller number with the remainder.

   \[
   80 \div 40 = 2 \quad \text{remainder} \quad 0
   \]

   - Since the remainder is now 0, the divisor at this step (40) is the GCD.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The largest possible side length of each square plot is 40 meters.

**Final Answer:**
The largest possible side length of each square plot is 40 meters.
