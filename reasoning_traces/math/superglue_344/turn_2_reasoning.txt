==================================================

To solve a problem effectively, it's important to first understand what is being asked. However, the question "Sample reasoning question 344" does not provide specific details or context about the problem. Without additional information, I will demonstrate a general approach to solving a math problem by using a hypothetical example.

Let's assume the problem is as follows:

**Problem:**  
A store sells apples at $2 each and oranges at $3 each. If a customer buys a total of 10 fruits consisting of apples and oranges and spends $25, how many apples and how many oranges did the customer buy?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( x \) be the number of apples.
   - Let \( y \) be the number of oranges.

2. **Set Up Equations:**
   - The total number of fruits is 10:  
     \[
     x + y = 10
     \]
   - The total cost is $25:  
     \[
     2x + 3y = 25
     \]

3. **Solve the System of Equations:**

   We have the following system of equations:
   \[
   \begin{align*}
   x + y &= 10 \quad \text{(Equation 1)} \\
   2x + 3y &= 25 \quad \text{(Equation 2)}
   \end{align*}
   \]

   **Substitution Method:**

   From Equation 1, express \( y \) in terms of \( x \):
   \[
   y = 10 - x
   \]

   Substitute \( y = 10 - x \) into Equation 2:
   \[
   2x + 3(10 - x) = 25
   \]

   Simplify and solve for \( x \):
   \[
   2x + 30 - 3x = 25
   \]
   \[
   -x + 30 = 25
   \]
   \[
   -x = 25 - 30
   \]
   \[
   -x = -5
   \]
   \[
   x = 5
   \]

   Substitute \( x = 5 \) back into the expression for \( y \):
   \[
   y = 10 - 5 = 5
   \]

4. **Verify the Solution:**

   Check the solution in both original equations:
   - For Equation 1: \( x + y = 5 + 5 = 10 \), which is correct.
   - For Equation 2: \( 2x + 3y = 2(5) + 3(5) = 10 + 15 = 25 \), which is correct.

5. **Conclusion:**

   The customer bought 5 apples and 5 oranges.

**Final Answer:**
The customer bought 5 apples and 5 oranges.
