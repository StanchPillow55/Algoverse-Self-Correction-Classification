==================================================

To solve the problem effectively, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 344" entails. Since the problem statement is not provided, I'll demonstrate a general approach to solving a typical math problem by breaking it down into steps. Let's assume a hypothetical math problem and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**
Calculate the value of \( x \) in the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).

**Step 1: Understand the Problem**
We need to find the value of \( x \) that satisfies the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).

**Step 2: Isolate the Variable**
To solve for \( x \), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We can do this by performing operations that will eliminate the other terms from the side containing \( x \).

**Step 3: Perform Operations**
1. Start with the equation: 
   \[
   2x + 3 = 11
   \]

2. Subtract 3 from both sides to eliminate the constant term on the left side:
   \[
   2x + 3 - 3 = 11 - 3
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   2x = 8
   \]

3. Divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( x \):
   \[
   \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{8}{2}
   \]
   Simplifying gives:
   \[
   x = 4
   \]

**Step 4: Verify the Solution**
Substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies the equation:
\[
2(4) + 3 = 11
\]
\[
8 + 3 = 11
\]
\[
11 = 11
\]
The left side equals the right side, confirming that \( x = 4 \) is the correct solution.

**Final Answer:**
The value of \( x \) is \( 4 \).

This step-by-step approach can be applied to a wide range of algebraic problems, ensuring that each step logically follows from the previous one and that the solution is verified at the end. If you have a specific problem or need further assistance, please provide more details.
