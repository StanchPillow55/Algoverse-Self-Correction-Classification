To solve this problem, we need to determine the age of each scroll based on the given conditions. We know the age of the first scroll and the relationship between the ages of consecutive scrolls.

Let's denote the age of the first scroll as \( S_1 \), the second scroll as \( S_2 \), the third scroll as \( S_3 \), the fourth scroll as \( S_4 \), and the fifth scroll as \( S_5 \).

Given:
- \( S_1 = 4080 \) years
- Each subsequent scroll is older than the previous one by half the age of the previous scroll.

We need to find \( S_5 \).

### Step-by-step Calculation:

1. **First Scroll:**
   \[
   S_1 = 4080
   \]

2. **Second Scroll:**
   The second scroll is older than the first scroll by half the age of the first scroll:
   \[
   S_2 = S_1 + \frac{1}{2}S_1 = 4080 + \frac{1}{2} \times 4080 = 4080 + 2040 = 6120
   \]

3. **Third Scroll:**
   The third scroll is older than the second scroll by half the age of the second scroll:
   \[
   S_3 = S_2 + \frac{1}{2}S_2 = 6120 + \frac{1}{2} \times 6120 = 6120 + 3060 = 9180
   \]

4. **Fourth Scroll:**
   The fourth scroll is older than the third scroll by half the age of the third scroll:
   \[
   S_4 = S_3 + \frac{1}{2}S_3 = 9180 + \frac{1}{2} \times 9180 = 9180 + 4590 = 13770
   \]

5. **Fifth Scroll:**
   The fifth scroll is older than the fourth scroll by half the age of the fourth scroll:
   \[
   S_5 = S_4 + \frac{1}{2}S_4 = 13770 + \frac{1}{2} \times 13770 = 13770 + 6885 = 20655
   \]

### Conclusion:
The age of the fifth scroll is \( \boxed{20655} \) years.
