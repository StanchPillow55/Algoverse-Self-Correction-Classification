==================================================

To find out how much Carlos and Benji will pay for their rentals altogether, we need to calculate the total cost for each of them separately and then add those amounts together.

**Step 1: Calculate Carlos's rental cost.**

Carlos rents a canoe for $30 per hour. He uses the canoe for 3 hours. 

To find the total cost for Carlos, we multiply the hourly rate by the number of hours he used the canoe:

\[
\text{Cost for Carlos} = \text{Hourly Rate} \times \text{Number of Hours}
\]

\[
\text{Cost for Carlos} = 30 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 90 \, \text{dollars}
\]

**Step 2: Calculate Benji's rental cost.**

Benji rents a banana boat raft for $18 per hour. He uses the raft for 5 hours.

To find the total cost for Benji, we again multiply the hourly rate by the number of hours he used the raft:

\[
\text{Cost for Benji} = \text{Hourly Rate} \times \text{Number of Hours}
\]

\[
\text{Cost for Benji} = 18 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 5 \, \text{hours} = 90 \, \text{dollars}
\]

**Step 3: Calculate the total cost for both Carlos and Benji.**

Now, we add the costs for Carlos and Benji together to find the total amount they will pay for their rentals:

\[
\text{Total Cost} = \text{Cost for Carlos} + \text{Cost for Benji}
\]

\[
\text{Total Cost} = 90 \, \text{dollars} + 90 \, \text{dollars} = 180 \, \text{dollars}
\]

**Final Answer:**

Carlos and Benji will pay a total of **$180** for their rentals altogether.
