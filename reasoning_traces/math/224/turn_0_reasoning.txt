To solve the problem, we need to determine the ages of the five scrolls based on the information given. We know that the first scroll is 4080 years old, and each subsequent scroll is older than the last by half as many years as the last scroll's age.

Let's denote the ages of the scrolls as follows:
- \( S_1 \): age of the first scroll
- \( S_2 \): age of the second scroll
- \( S_3 \): age of the third scroll
- \( S_4 \): age of the fourth scroll
- \( S_5 \): age of the fifth scroll

From the problem, we know:
- \( S_1 = 4080 \)

Now, we will calculate the ages of the subsequent scrolls using the rule provided.

### Step 1: Calculate \( S_2 \)
The second scroll is older than the first by half the age of the first scroll:
\[
S_2 = S_1 + \frac{1}{2} S_1
\]
Substituting \( S_1 = 4080 \):
\[
S_2 = 4080 + \frac{1}{2} \times 4080
\]
Calculating \( \frac{1}{2} \times 4080 \):
\[
\frac{1}{2} \times 4080 = 2040
\]
Now substituting back:
\[
S_2 = 4080 + 2040 = 6120
\]

### Step 2: Calculate \( S_3 \)
The third scroll is older than the second by half the age of the second scroll:
\[
S_3 = S_2 + \frac{1}{2} S_2
\]
Substituting \( S_2 = 6120 \):
\[
S_3 = 6120 + \frac{1}{2} \times 6120
\]
Calculating \( \frac{1}{2} \times 6120 \):
\[
\frac{1}{2} \times 6120 = 3060
\]
Now substituting back:
\[
S_3 = 6120 + 3060 = 9180
\]

### Step 3: Calculate \( S_4 \)
The fourth scroll is older than the third by half the age of the third scroll:
\[
S_4 = S_3 + \frac{1}{2} S_3
\]
Substituting \( S_3 = 9180 \):
\[
S_4 = 9180 + \frac{1}{2} \times 9180
\]
Calculating \( \frac{1}{2} \times 9180 \):
\[
\frac{1}{2} \times 9180 = 4590
\]
Now substituting back:
\[
S_4 = 9180 + 4590 = 13770
\]

### Step 4: Calculate \( S_5 \)
The fifth scroll is older than the fourth by half the age of the fourth scroll:
\[
S_5 = S_4 + \frac{1}{2} S_4
\]
Substituting \( S_4 = 13770 \):
\[
S_5 = 13770 + \frac{1}{2} \times 13770
\]
Calculating \( \frac{1}{2} \times 13770 \):
\[
\frac{1}{2} \times 13770 = 6885
\]
Now substituting back:
\[
S_5 = 13770 + 6885 = 20655
\]

### Final Answer
The age of the fifth scroll is:
\[
\boxed{20655}
\]
