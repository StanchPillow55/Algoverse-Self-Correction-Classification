To determine the total cost of Kayla's birthday party at the movie theater, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of guests**:
   - Kayla invited 25 classmates.
   - She also invited 7 girls from her dance class.
   - Additionally, she invited 13 family members.
   - Total invited guests = 25 (classmates) + 7 (dance class) + 13 (family) = 45 guests.

2. **Determine how many guests will actually attend**:
   - Out of the 45 invited guests, 4 people said they could not come.
   - Therefore, the number of guests who will attend = 45 (invited) - 4 (not attending) = 41 guests.

3. **Calculate the number of guests beyond the initial 20**:
   - The theater rental fee covers up to 20 guests.
   - Since Kayla has 41 guests attending, the number of additional guests = 41 (attending) - 20 (included in the base fee) = 21 additional guests.

4. **Calculate the total cost of the party**:
   - The base fee for renting the theater is $125.
   - The cost for the additional guests is $6 per guest.
   - Total cost for additional guests = 21 (additional guests) Ã— $6 (cost per additional guest) = $126.

5. **Combine the base fee and the additional guest fees**:
   - Total cost = Base fee + Cost for additional guests
   - Total cost = $125 + $126 = $251.

Thus, the total cost of Kayla's birthday party at the movie theater is **$251**.
