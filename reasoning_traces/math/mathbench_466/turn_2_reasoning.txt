Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we first need to understand what "Sample math problem 466" refers to. Since no specific details or context are provided about this problem, I'll need to make some assumptions to proceed. Let's assume "Sample math problem 466" is a placeholder for a typical math problem. For the sake of illustration, I'll create a sample problem and solve it step by step.

**Sample Problem:**
Let's assume "Sample math problem 466" is the following:

"Calculate the value of \( x \) in the equation \( 3x + 5 = 20 \)."

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Equation:**
   The equation given is \( 3x + 5 = 20 \). This is a linear equation in one variable, \( x \).

2. **Isolate the Variable:**
   To solve for \( x \), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We can do this by performing operations that will leave \( x \) alone on one side.

3. **Subtract 5 from Both Sides:**
   To eliminate the constant term on the left side, subtract 5 from both sides of the equation:
   \[
   3x + 5 - 5 = 20 - 5
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   3x = 15
   \]

4. **Divide by 3:**
   Next, divide both sides of the equation by 3 to solve for \( x \):
   \[
   \frac{3x}{3} = \frac{15}{3}
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   x = 5
   \]

5. **Verify the Solution:**
   Substitute \( x = 5 \) back into the original equation to verify:
   \[
   3(5) + 5 = 20
   \]
   Simplifying the left side gives:
   \[
   15 + 5 = 20
   \]
   \[
   20 = 20
   \]
   Since both sides of the equation are equal, our solution is verified.

**Final Answer:**
The value of \( x \) is 5.

This completes the solution to the assumed problem. If "Sample math problem 466" refers to a different problem, please provide the specific details or context for that problem, and I will be happy to solve it accordingly.
