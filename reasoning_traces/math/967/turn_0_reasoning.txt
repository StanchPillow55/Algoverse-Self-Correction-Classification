==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to determine the ages of Nani, his brother, and his sister, and then sum these ages to find the total age of all three family members.

1. **Determine Nani's Age:**
   - Nani is given to be 8 years old.

2. **Determine Nani's Brother's Age:**
   - It is stated that Nani's brother is twice his age.
   - Therefore, we calculate the brother's age as follows:
     \[
     \text{Brother's Age} = 2 \times \text{Nani's Age} = 2 \times 8 = 16 \text{ years old}
     \]

3. **Determine Nani's Sister's Age:**
   - Nani's sister is 25% younger than him. To find her age, we first calculate 25% of Nani's age:
     \[
     25\% \text{ of Nani's Age} = 0.25 \times 8 = 2 \text{ years}
     \]
   - Since she is 25% younger, we subtract this amount from Nani's age:
     \[
     \text{Sister's Age} = \text{Nani's Age} - 25\% \text{ of Nani's Age} = 8 - 2 = 6 \text{ years old}
     \]

4. **Calculate the Total Age of All Three Family Members:**
   - Now we add the ages of Nani, his brother, and his sister:
     \[
     \text{Total Age} = \text{Nani's Age} + \text{Brother's Age} + \text{Sister's Age}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total Age} = 8 + 16 + 6
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total Age} = 30 \text{ years}
     \]

Thus, the total age of all three family members is \( \boxed{30} \) years.
