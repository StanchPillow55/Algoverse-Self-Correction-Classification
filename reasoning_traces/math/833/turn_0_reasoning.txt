==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to determine how high Naruto can lift a mountain based on the lifting capabilities of Pompei, Saskay, and Kagiyami. We will work through the relationships step by step.

1. **Determine Pompei's lifting capability:**
   - Pompei can lift a mountain 1 inch.

2. **Determine Saskay's lifting capability:**
   - According to the problem, Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei.
   - Since Pompei lifts 1 inch, we calculate Saskay's lifting capability:
     \[
     \text{Saskay's lift} = 12 \times \text{Pompei's lift} = 12 \times 1 \text{ inch} = 12 \text{ inches}
     \]

3. **Determine Kagiyami's lifting capability:**
   - Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay.
   - We calculate Kagiyami's lifting capability:
     \[
     \text{Kagiyami's lift} = 4 \times \text{Saskay's lift} = 4 \times 12 \text{ inches} = 48 \text{ inches}
     \]

4. **Determine Naruto's lifting capability:**
   - Naruto can lift a mountain 10 times higher than Kagiyami.
   - We calculate Naruto's lifting capability:
     \[
     \text{Naruto's lift} = 10 \times \text{Kagiyami's lift} = 10 \times 48 \text{ inches} = 480 \text{ inches}
     \]

5. **Convert Naruto's lifting capability from inches to feet:**
   - There are 12 inches in a foot, so we convert Naruto's lift to feet:
     \[
     \text{Naruto's lift in feet} = \frac{480 \text{ inches}}{12 \text{ inches/foot}} = 40 \text{ feet}
     \]

Thus, after working through the relationships and performing the necessary calculations, we find that Naruto can lift a mountain **40 feet** high.

**Final Answer:**
Naruto can lift a mountain 40 feet high.
