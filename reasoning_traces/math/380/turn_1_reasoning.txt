==================================================

To determine how much Karan has to pay per month for her loan, we need to calculate the total amount she will repay, including the interest, and then divide that total by the number of months she will be making payments.

### Step 1: Calculate the Interest

Karan borrowed $3,650 at an interest rate of 10% for five months. First, we need to find out how much interest she will accrue over this period.

The formula for calculating simple interest is:

\[
\text{Interest} = \text{Principal} \times \text{Rate} \times \text{Time}
\]

Where:
- Principal = $3,650
- Rate = 10% per annum = 0.10 (as a decimal)
- Time = 5 months = \(\frac{5}{12}\) years (since the interest rate is annual)

Now, substituting the values into the formula:

\[
\text{Interest} = 3650 \times 0.10 \times \frac{5}{12}
\]

Calculating this step-by-step:

1. Calculate the annual interest for the principal:
   \[
   3650 \times 0.10 = 365
   \]

2. Now, calculate the interest for 5 months:
   \[
   \text{Interest} = 365 \times \frac{5}{12} = 365 \times 0.4167 \approx 152.08
   \]

### Step 2: Calculate the Total Amount to be Repaid

Now that we have the interest, we can calculate the total amount Karan has to repay:

\[
\text{Total Amount} = \text{Principal} + \text{Interest}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\text{Total Amount} = 3650 + 152.08 \approx 3802.08
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the Monthly Payment

Karan will repay this total amount over 5 months. To find the monthly payment, we divide the total amount by the number of months:

\[
\text{Monthly Payment} = \frac{\text{Total Amount}}{\text{Number of Months}} = \frac{3802.08}{5}
\]

Calculating this gives:

\[
\text{Monthly Payment} = 760.416
\]

### Final Answer

Rounding to two decimal places, Karan has to pay approximately:

\[
\boxed{760.42}
\]

Thus, Karan will pay $760.42 each month for five months to repay her loan.
