Question ID: 380
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to determine Patrick's current age based on the information given about his elder brother Robert.

1. **Determine Robert's Current Age:**
   - We are told that Robert will turn 30 after 2 years. This means that Robert's current age is 2 years less than 30.
   - Calculation: \( 30 - 2 = 28 \)
   - Therefore, Robert is currently 28 years old.

2. **Determine Patrick's Current Age:**
   - Patrick is half the age of Robert. Since we have determined that Robert is currently 28 years old, we can find Patrick's age by dividing Robert's age by 2.
   - Calculation: \( \frac{28}{2} = 14 \)
   - Therefore, Patrick is currently 14 years old.

**Final Answer:**
Patrick is 14 years old.
