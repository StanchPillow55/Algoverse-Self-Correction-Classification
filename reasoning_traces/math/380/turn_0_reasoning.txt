Question ID: 380
Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to determine Patrick's current age given the information about his elder brother Robert.

1. **Understand the information given:**
   - Robert will turn 30 after 2 years.

2. **Determine Robert's current age:**
   - Since Robert will be 30 years old in 2 years, we can calculate his current age by subtracting 2 years from 30.
   \[
   \text{Robert's current age} = 30 - 2 = 28
   \]

3. **Use the relationship between Patrick's and Robert's ages:**
   - We are told that Patrick is half the age of Robert.
   - Therefore, Patrick's age is half of Robert's current age.
   \[
   \text{Patrick's age} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Robert's current age} = \frac{1}{2} \times 28 = 14
   \]

4. **Conclusion:**
   - Patrick is currently 14 years old.

Thus, the final answer is that Patrick is 14 years old.
