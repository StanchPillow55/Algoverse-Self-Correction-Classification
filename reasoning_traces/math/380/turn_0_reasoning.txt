==================================================

To determine how much Karan has to pay per month, we need to calculate the total amount she will owe after five months, including the interest, and then divide that total by the number of months.

### Step 1: Calculate the interest

Karan borrowed $3,650 at an interest rate of 10% for five months. Since the interest rate is typically annual, we need to convert it to a monthly rate.

1. **Convert the annual interest rate to a monthly rate**:
   \[
   \text{Monthly interest rate} = \frac{10\%}{12} = \frac{0.10}{12} \approx 0.0083333
   \]

2. **Calculate the total interest for five months**:
   \[
   \text{Total interest} = \text{Principal} \times \text{Monthly interest rate} \times \text{Number of months}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total interest} = 3650 \times 0.0083333 \times 5
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total interest} = 3650 \times 0.0416665 \approx 152.83
   \]

### Step 2: Calculate the total amount to be repaid

Now, we add the total interest to the principal to find the total amount Karan has to repay.

\[
\text{Total amount to be repaid} = \text{Principal} + \text{Total interest}
\]
\[
\text{Total amount to be repaid} = 3650 + 152.83 \approx 3802.83
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the monthly payment

To find out how much Karan has to pay each month, we divide the total amount to be repaid by the number of months (5).

\[
\text{Monthly payment} = \frac{\text{Total amount to be repaid}}{\text{Number of months}}
\]
\[
\text{Monthly payment} = \frac{3802.83}{5} \approx 760.566
\]

### Final Answer

Rounding to two decimal places, Karan has to pay approximately **$760.57** per month.
