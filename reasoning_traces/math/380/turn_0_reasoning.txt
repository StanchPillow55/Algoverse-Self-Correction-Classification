Question ID: 380
Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to determine Patrick's current age based on the information given about his elder brother Robert.

1. **Understanding Robert's Future Age**:
   - We know that Robert will turn 30 after 2 years. This means that currently, Robert is:
     \[
     30 - 2 = 28 \text{ years old}
     \]

2. **Understanding Patrick's Age in Relation to Robert's Age**:
   - The problem states that Patrick is half the age of Robert. Since we have established that Robert is currently 28 years old, we can find Patrick's age by calculating half of Robert's age:
     \[
     \text{Patrick's age} = \frac{28}{2} = 14 \text{ years old}
     \]

3. **Conclusion**:
   - Therefore, Patrick is currently 14 years old.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{14}
\]
