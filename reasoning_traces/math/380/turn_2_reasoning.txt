Question ID: 380
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To determine how much Karan has to pay per month for her loan, we need to calculate the total amount she will repay, including interest, and then divide that total by the number of months she will be making payments.

### Step 1: Calculate the Interest

Karan borrowed $3,650 at an interest rate of 10% for five months. First, we need to calculate the total interest she will pay over this period.

The formula for calculating simple interest is:

\[
\text{Interest} = \text{Principal} \times \text{Rate} \times \text{Time}
\]

Where:
- Principal = $3,650
- Rate = 10% per annum = 0.10
- Time = 5 months = \(\frac{5}{12}\) years (since the interest rate is annual)

Now, substituting the values into the formula:

\[
\text{Interest} = 3650 \times 0.10 \times \frac{5}{12}
\]

Calculating the interest:

\[
\text{Interest} = 3650 \times 0.10 \times 0.4167 \approx 3650 \times 0.04167 \approx 152.41
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the Total Amount to be Repaid

Next, we need to find the total amount Karan will repay, which is the sum of the principal and the interest:

\[
\text{Total Amount} = \text{Principal} + \text{Interest}
\]

Substituting the values we have:

\[
\text{Total Amount} = 3650 + 152.41 \approx 3802.41
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the Monthly Payment

Karan will make equal monthly payments over 5 months. To find the monthly payment, we divide the total amount by the number of months:

\[
\text{Monthly Payment} = \frac{\text{Total Amount}}{\text{Number of Months}}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\text{Monthly Payment} = \frac{3802.41}{5} \approx 760.48
\]

### Final Answer

Karan has to pay approximately **$760.48** per month.
