Question ID: 380
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine Patrick's current age based on the information given about his elder brother Robert.

1. **Determine Robert's Current Age:**
   - We are told that Robert will turn 30 after 2 years. 
   - This means that Robert's current age is 30 - 2 = 28 years old.

2. **Determine Patrick's Current Age:**
   - Patrick is half the age of Robert.
   - Since Robert is currently 28 years old, we calculate Patrick's age as follows:
     \[
     \text{Patrick's age} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Robert's age} = \frac{1}{2} \times 28 = 14
     \]

Therefore, Patrick is currently 14 years old.

**Final Answer: Patrick is 14 years old.**
