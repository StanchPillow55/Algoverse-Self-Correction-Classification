==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 22," we first need to understand what the problem is asking. Since the problem statement is incomplete, I'll create a hypothetical math problem labeled "Sample math problem 22" and solve it step-by-step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**

"Sample math problem 22: A rectangle has a length that is 3 times its width. If the perimeter of the rectangle is 48 units, find the dimensions of the rectangle."

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We have a rectangle where the length (L) is 3 times the width (W).
   - The perimeter (P) of the rectangle is given as 48 units.

2. **Write Down the Formula for Perimeter:**
   - The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is:
     \[
     P = 2L + 2W
     \]

3. **Substitute the Given Information:**
   - We know \( L = 3W \).
   - Substitute \( L = 3W \) into the perimeter formula:
     \[
     48 = 2(3W) + 2W
     \]

4. **Simplify the Equation:**
   - Simplify the expression:
     \[
     48 = 6W + 2W
     \]
   - Combine like terms:
     \[
     48 = 8W
     \]

5. **Solve for W:**
   - Divide both sides by 8 to solve for W:
     \[
     W = \frac{48}{8} = 6
     \]

6. **Find the Length L:**
   - Since \( L = 3W \), substitute \( W = 6 \) into the equation for L:
     \[
     L = 3 \times 6 = 18
     \]

7. **Verify the Solution:**
   - Check the perimeter with the found dimensions:
     \[
     P = 2L + 2W = 2(18) + 2(6) = 36 + 12 = 48
     \]
   - The calculated perimeter matches the given perimeter, confirming our solution is correct.

**Final Answer:**

The dimensions of the rectangle are:
- Width (W) = 6 units
- Length (L) = 18 units
