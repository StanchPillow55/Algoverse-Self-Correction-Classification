==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 22," let's first assume that it is a placeholder for an actual math problem. Since no specific details are provided, I'll create a hypothetical math problem and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Math Problem 22:**

"Calculate the value of \( x \) in the equation \( 3x + 5 = 20 \)."

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Equation:**
   The equation given is \( 3x + 5 = 20 \). This is a linear equation in one variable, \( x \).

2. **Isolate the Variable:**
   To find the value of \( x \), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We can do this by performing operations that will leave \( x \) alone on one side.

3. **Subtract 5 from Both Sides:**
   To eliminate the constant term on the left side, subtract 5 from both sides of the equation:
   \[
   3x + 5 - 5 = 20 - 5
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   3x = 15
   \]

4. **Divide by 3:**
   Now, divide both sides by 3 to solve for \( x \):
   \[
   \frac{3x}{3} = \frac{15}{3}
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   x = 5
   \]

5. **Verify the Solution:**
   Substitute \( x = 5 \) back into the original equation to verify:
   \[
   3(5) + 5 = 20
   \]
   Simplifying the left side:
   \[
   15 + 5 = 20
   \]
   \[
   20 = 20
   \]
   The left side equals the right side, confirming that our solution is correct.

**Final Answer:**
The value of \( x \) is 5.

This is a complete solution to the hypothetical problem based on the placeholder "Sample math problem 22." If you have a specific problem in mind, please provide the details, and I can solve that for you.
