==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 22," we need to first understand what the problem is asking. However, since "Sample math problem 22" is not a specific problem statement, I'll create a hypothetical math problem for demonstration purposes and solve it step by step.

Let's assume the problem is as follows:

**Problem Statement:**
A rectangle has a length that is 4 units more than its width. If the perimeter of the rectangle is 28 units, find the dimensions of the rectangle.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( w \) be the width of the rectangle.
   - Then the length \( l \) can be expressed as \( l = w + 4 \).

2. **Perimeter Formula:**
   - The perimeter \( P \) of a rectangle is given by the formula:
     \[
     P = 2l + 2w
     \]
   - We know the perimeter is 28 units, so:
     \[
     2l + 2w = 28
     \]

3. **Substitute the Expression for Length:**
   - Substitute \( l = w + 4 \) into the perimeter equation:
     \[
     2(w + 4) + 2w = 28
     \]

4. **Simplify and Solve for \( w \):**
   - Distribute the 2:
     \[
     2w + 8 + 2w = 28
     \]
   - Combine like terms:
     \[
     4w + 8 = 28
     \]
   - Subtract 8 from both sides:
     \[
     4w = 20
     \]
   - Divide by 4:
     \[
     w = 5
     \]

5. **Find the Length:**
   - Substitute \( w = 5 \) back into the expression for length:
     \[
     l = w + 4 = 5 + 4 = 9
     \]

6. **Verify the Solution:**
   - Check the perimeter with these dimensions:
     \[
     P = 2l + 2w = 2(9) + 2(5) = 18 + 10 = 28
     \]
   - The calculated perimeter matches the given perimeter, confirming the solution is correct.

**Final Answer:**
The dimensions of the rectangle are:
- Width: 5 units
- Length: 9 units
