==================================================

To determine how many cups of bird food Herman will need for December, January, and February, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the daily food requirement**:
   Herman feeds the birds 1/2 cup in the morning and 1/2 cup in the afternoon. Therefore, the total amount of food he feeds the birds in one day is:
   \[
   \text{Daily food} = \frac{1}{2} \text{ cup (morning)} + \frac{1}{2} \text{ cup (afternoon)} = 1 \text{ cup}
   \]

2. **Determine the number of days in each month**:
   - December has 31 days.
   - January has 31 days.
   - February has 28 days (assuming it is not a leap year).

3. **Calculate the total number of days for the three months**:
   \[
   \text{Total days} = 31 \text{ (December)} + 31 \text{ (January)} + 28 \text{ (February)} = 90 \text{ days}
   \]

4. **Calculate the total amount of food needed for all three months**:
   Since Herman feeds the birds 1 cup of food each day, we can calculate the total food needed over the 90 days:
   \[
   \text{Total food} = \text{Daily food} \times \text{Total days} = 1 \text{ cup/day} \times 90 \text{ days} = 90 \text{ cups}
   \]

5. **Final answer**:
   Therefore, the total amount of bird food Herman will need for December, January, and February is:
   \[
   \boxed{90} \text{ cups}
   \]
