Question ID: 90
Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to determine how many days are in December, January, and February. 

December has 31 days, January also has 31 days, and February usually has 28 days (we will use 28 days for this problem, since it doesn't specify a leap year).

So, the total number of days is 31 (December) + 31 (January) + 28 (February) = 90 days.

Herman feeds the birds 1/2 cup in the morning and 1/2 cup in the afternoon, which totals to 1/2 + 1/2 = 1 cup per day.

So, for 90 days, he will need 90 days * 1 cup/day = 90 cups of food.

Therefore, Herman will need 90 cups of food to feed the birds in December, January, and February.
