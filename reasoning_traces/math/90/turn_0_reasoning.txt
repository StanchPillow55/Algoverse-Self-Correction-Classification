To determine how many pounds of potato salad Ted needs to bring to the picnic, we need to calculate the total amount of potato salad required for both the adults and the children.

1. **Calculate the amount of potato salad needed for the adults:**
   - Each adult dinosaur eats 10 lbs of potato salad.
   - There are 20 adults at the picnic.
   - Therefore, the total amount of potato salad needed for the adults is calculated as follows:
     \[
     \text{Total for adults} = \text{Number of adults} \times \text{Amount per adult}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total for adults} = 20 \times 10 = 200 \text{ lbs}
     \]

2. **Calculate the amount of potato salad needed for the children:**
   - Each child dinosaur eats half as much as an adult. Since an adult eats 10 lbs, a child will eat:
     \[
     \text{Amount per child} = \frac{10}{2} = 5 \text{ lbs}
     \]
   - There are 5 children at the picnic.
   - Therefore, the total amount of potato salad needed for the children is calculated as follows:
     \[
     \text{Total for children} = \text{Number of children} \times \text{Amount per child}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total for children} = 5 \times 5 = 25 \text{ lbs}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total amount of potato salad needed for the picnic:**
   - Now, we add the total amount needed for adults and children together:
     \[
     \text{Total potato salad} = \text{Total for adults} + \text{Total for children}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total potato salad} = 200 + 25 = 225 \text{ lbs}
     \]

Therefore, Ted needs to bring **225 pounds** of potato salad to the picnic to ensure that there is enough for everyone.

Final answer: **225 lbs**
