==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample math problem 414" refers to. Since the problem statement is not provided, I'll assume it's a placeholder for a typical math problem. Let's create a sample problem and solve it step by step.

**Sample Problem 414:**
Solve for \( x \) in the equation: 

\[ 2x + 3 = 11 \]

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Equation:**
   The equation given is a simple linear equation in one variable, \( x \). Our goal is to isolate \( x \) on one side of the equation to find its value.

2. **Isolate the Variable:**
   To isolate \( x \), we need to get rid of the constant term on the left side of the equation. The constant term here is \( 3 \).

   - Subtract \( 3 \) from both sides of the equation to maintain the equality:

     \[
     2x + 3 - 3 = 11 - 3
     \]

   - Simplifying both sides gives:

     \[
     2x = 8
     \]

3. **Solve for \( x \):**
   Now, we need to solve for \( x \) by getting rid of the coefficient of \( x \), which is \( 2 \).

   - Divide both sides of the equation by \( 2 \):

     \[
     \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{8}{2}
     \]

   - Simplifying both sides gives:

     \[
     x = 4
     \]

4. **Verify the Solution:**
   Substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies the equation:

   \[
   2(4) + 3 = 11
   \]

   - Calculate the left side:

     \[
     8 + 3 = 11
     \]

   - Since both sides of the equation are equal, the solution \( x = 4 \) is verified.

**Final Answer:**

The solution to the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \) is \( x = 4 \).
