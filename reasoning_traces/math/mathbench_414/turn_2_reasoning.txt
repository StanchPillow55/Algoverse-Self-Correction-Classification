Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 414," we need to first understand what the problem entails. However, the problem statement "Sample math problem 414" is not specific enough for me to determine the exact nature of the problem. It seems like a placeholder or a reference to a specific problem that is not provided here.

To proceed, let's assume that "Sample math problem 414" refers to a generic math problem. Since I don't have the specific details of the problem, I'll create a hypothetical math problem and solve it step by step. Let's assume the problem is as follows:

**Hypothetical Problem:**
Solve for \( x \) in the equation: 
\[ 2x + 3 = 11 \]

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Equation:**
   The equation given is a linear equation in one variable, \( x \). Our goal is to isolate \( x \) on one side of the equation.

2. **Subtract 3 from Both Sides:**
   To begin isolating \( x \), we first eliminate the constant term on the left side by subtracting 3 from both sides of the equation:
   \[
   2x + 3 - 3 = 11 - 3
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   2x = 8
   \]

3. **Divide Both Sides by 2:**
   Next, we divide both sides of the equation by 2 to solve for \( x \):
   \[
   \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{8}{2}
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   x = 4
   \]

4. **Verify the Solution:**
   To ensure our solution is correct, we substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation:
   \[
   2(4) + 3 = 11
   \]
   Simplifying the left side gives:
   \[
   8 + 3 = 11
   \]
   Since both sides of the equation are equal, our solution is verified.

**Final Answer:**
The solution to the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \) is \( x = 4 \).

If "Sample math problem 414" refers to a different problem, please provide the specific details or context of the problem so I can assist you accurately.
