==================================================

It seems like the problem statement "Sample math problem 388" is not providing enough information to understand what the actual math problem is. To solve a math problem, we need specific details or a clear question to address. Since the problem is not specified, I'll guide you through a general approach to solving math problems, which you can apply once you have the actual problem details.

### General Approach to Solving Math Problems:

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - Read the problem carefully.
   - Identify what is being asked.
   - Determine what information is given and what needs to be found.

2. **Devise a Plan:**
   - Think about the mathematical concepts that apply to the problem.
   - Consider different strategies such as drawing a diagram, creating an equation, or breaking the problem into smaller parts.

3. **Carry Out the Plan:**
   - Execute your chosen strategy step by step.
   - Perform calculations carefully and check each step for accuracy.

4. **Review/Check Your Work:**
   - Verify that your solution makes sense in the context of the problem.
   - Double-check calculations and ensure all parts of the problem are addressed.

5. **State the Final Answer:**
   - Clearly write down the final answer, ensuring it answers the question posed in the problem.

### Example Problem:

Since we don't have a specific problem, let's consider a simple example:

**Problem:** Solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).

**Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We need to find the value of \( x \) that satisfies the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).

2. **Devise a Plan:**
   - We can solve for \( x \) by isolating it on one side of the equation.

3. **Carry Out the Plan:**
   - Start by subtracting 3 from both sides of the equation:
     \[
     2x + 3 - 3 = 11 - 3
     \]
     \[
     2x = 8
     \]
   - Next, divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( x \):
     \[
     \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{8}{2}
     \]
     \[
     x = 4
     \]

4. **Review/Check Your Work:**
   - Substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies the equation:
     \[
     2(4) + 3 = 8 + 3 = 11
     \]
   - The left-hand side equals the right-hand side, confirming our solution is correct.

5. **State the Final Answer:**
   - The solution to the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \) is \( x = 4 \).
