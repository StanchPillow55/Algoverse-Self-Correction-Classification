To solve the problem, we need more information about what "Sample math problem 388" refers to. Since the problem is not specified, I'll create a sample math problem and solve it step by step.

**Sample Math Problem:**

A rectangle has a length that is 3 times its width. If the perimeter of the rectangle is 64 units, find the dimensions of the rectangle.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( w \) be the width of the rectangle.
   - Then the length \( l \) is \( 3w \) since the length is 3 times the width.

2. **Write the Perimeter Formula:**
   - The formula for the perimeter \( P \) of a rectangle is given by:
     \[
     P = 2l + 2w
     \]
   - We know the perimeter is 64 units, so:
     \[
     64 = 2l + 2w
     \]

3. **Substitute the Expression for Length:**
   - Substitute \( l = 3w \) into the perimeter equation:
     \[
     64 = 2(3w) + 2w
     \]

4. **Simplify the Equation:**
   - Simplify the equation:
     \[
     64 = 6w + 2w
     \]
     \[
     64 = 8w
     \]

5. **Solve for Width \( w \):**
   - Divide both sides by 8 to solve for \( w \):
     \[
     w = \frac{64}{8} = 8
     \]

6. **Find the Length \( l \):**
   - Since \( l = 3w \), substitute \( w = 8 \) into the expression for \( l \):
     \[
     l = 3 \times 8 = 24
     \]

7. **Verify the Solution:**
   - Check that the dimensions satisfy the perimeter condition:
     \[
     P = 2l + 2w = 2(24) + 2(8) = 48 + 16 = 64
     \]
   - The calculated perimeter matches the given perimeter, confirming the solution is correct.

**Final Answer:**

The dimensions of the rectangle are:
- Width: 8 units
- Length: 24 units
