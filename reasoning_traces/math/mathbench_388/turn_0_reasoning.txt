==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample math problem 388" refers to. Since no specific details are provided about the problem, I'll assume it's a generic math problem and create a sample problem for demonstration purposes.

Let's assume "Sample math problem 388" is the following:

**Problem:**
Solve for \( x \) in the equation:
\[ 2x + 3 = 11 \]

**Step-by-step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Equation:**
   The equation given is a simple linear equation in one variable, \( x \). Our goal is to isolate \( x \) on one side of the equation.

2. **Isolate the Variable:**
   To solve for \( x \), we need to get rid of the constant term on the left side of the equation. The equation is:
   \[
   2x + 3 = 11
   \]
   Subtract 3 from both sides to eliminate the constant term:
   \[
   2x + 3 - 3 = 11 - 3
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   2x = 8
   \]

3. **Solve for \( x \):**
   Now, we need to solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides of the equation by 2, which is the coefficient of \( x \):
   \[
   \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{8}{2}
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   x = 4
   \]

4. **Verify the Solution:**
   To ensure our solution is correct, substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation:
   \[
   2(4) + 3 = 11
   \]
   Simplifying the left side:
   \[
   8 + 3 = 11
   \]
   Since both sides of the equation are equal, our solution is verified.

**Final Answer:**
The solution to the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \) is \( x = 4 \).
