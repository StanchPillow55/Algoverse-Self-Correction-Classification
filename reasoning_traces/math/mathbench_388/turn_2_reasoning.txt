==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample math problem 388" refers to. Since this is not a standard math problem description, I will assume it is a placeholder for a specific math problem. Without the actual problem statement, I will create a hypothetical math problem and solve it step by step.

Let's assume "Sample math problem 388" is the following:

**Problem:**  
A rectangle has a length that is 3 times its width. If the perimeter of the rectangle is 48 units, find the dimensions of the rectangle.

**Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We have a rectangle with a length (L) and a width (W).
   - The length is 3 times the width: \( L = 3W \).
   - The perimeter of the rectangle is 48 units.

2. **Recall the Formula for Perimeter:**
   - The perimeter (P) of a rectangle is given by the formula:  
     \[ P = 2L + 2W \]

3. **Substitute the Known Values:**
   - We know \( P = 48 \) and \( L = 3W \). Substitute these into the perimeter formula:  
     \[ 48 = 2(3W) + 2W \]

4. **Simplify the Equation:**
   - Simplify the expression on the right side:  
     \[ 48 = 6W + 2W \]
   - Combine like terms:  
     \[ 48 = 8W \]

5. **Solve for W:**
   - Divide both sides by 8 to solve for W:  
     \[ W = \frac{48}{8} \]
     \[ W = 6 \]

6. **Find the Length (L):**
   - Since \( L = 3W \), substitute \( W = 6 \) into the equation for L:  
     \[ L = 3 \times 6 \]
     \[ L = 18 \]

7. **Verify the Solution:**
   - Check if the dimensions satisfy the original perimeter condition:  
     \[ P = 2L + 2W = 2(18) + 2(6) = 36 + 12 = 48 \]
   - The calculated perimeter matches the given perimeter, confirming our solution is correct.

**Final Answer:**
The dimensions of the rectangle are a length of 18 units and a width of 6 units.
