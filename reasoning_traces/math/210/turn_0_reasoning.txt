To solve this problem, we need to determine how many toy cars Bobby will have after three years, given that the number of cars increases by 50% each year.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Number of Cars:**
   Bobby starts with 16 toy cars.

2. **Year 1:**
   - The number of cars increases by 50%.
   - To find 50% of 16, we calculate:
     \[
     0.50 \times 16 = 8
     \]
   - Therefore, the number of cars at the end of Year 1 is:
     \[
     16 + 8 = 24
     \]

3. **Year 2:**
   - The number of cars increases by 50% again.
   - To find 50% of 24, we calculate:
     \[
     0.50 \times 24 = 12
     \]
   - Therefore, the number of cars at the end of Year 2 is:
     \[
     24 + 12 = 36
     \]

4. **Year 3:**
   - The number of cars increases by 50% once more.
   - To find 50% of 36, we calculate:
     \[
     0.50 \times 36 = 18
     \]
   - Therefore, the number of cars at the end of Year 3 is:
     \[
     36 + 18 = 54
     \]

Thus, after three years, Bobby will have a total of 54 toy cars.

**Final Answer:**
Bobby will have 54 toy cars in three years.
