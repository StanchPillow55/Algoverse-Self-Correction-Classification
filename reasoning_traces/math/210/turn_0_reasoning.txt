==================================================

To determine how many toy cars Bobby will have in three years, we need to calculate the increase in the number of cars each year based on the 50% increase.

1. **Initial Number of Cars**: Bobby starts with 16 toy cars.

2. **Understanding the Increase**: A 50% increase means that each year, Bobby will have 1.5 times the number of cars he had the previous year. This is because a 50% increase can be expressed as:
   \[
   1 + 0.5 = 1.5
   \]

3. **Calculating the Number of Cars Year by Year**:
   - **After Year 1**:
     \[
     \text{Cars after Year 1} = 16 \times 1.5 = 24
     \]
   - **After Year 2**:
     \[
     \text{Cars after Year 2} = 24 \times 1.5 = 36
     \]
   - **After Year 3**:
     \[
     \text{Cars after Year 3} = 36 \times 1.5 = 54
     \]

4. **Final Calculation**:
   After calculating the number of cars for each year, we find that after three years, Bobby will have 54 toy cars.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{54}
\]
