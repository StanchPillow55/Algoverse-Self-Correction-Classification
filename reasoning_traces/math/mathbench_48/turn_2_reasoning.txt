==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample math problem 48" refers to. Since the problem is not explicitly stated, I'll assume it involves basic arithmetic or algebra, as these are common in sample math problems. Let's consider a hypothetical problem involving the number 48, such as finding its factors, solving an equation, or performing operations with it.

Let's assume the problem is to find the factors of 48 and then solve a simple equation involving 48. Here's how we can approach it:

### Step 1: Find the Factors of 48

Factors of a number are integers that can be multiplied together to produce the original number. To find the factors of 48, we can start by dividing 48 by the smallest integers and see which ones divide evenly.

1. **Divide by 1:**  
   \( 48 \div 1 = 48 \)  
   So, 1 and 48 are factors.

2. **Divide by 2:**  
   \( 48 \div 2 = 24 \)  
   So, 2 and 24 are factors.

3. **Divide by 3:**  
   \( 48 \div 3 = 16 \)  
   So, 3 and 16 are factors.

4. **Divide by 4:**  
   \( 48 \div 4 = 12 \)  
   So, 4 and 12 are factors.

5. **Divide by 5:**  
   \( 48 \div 5 \) does not result in an integer, so 5 is not a factor.

6. **Divide by 6:**  
   \( 48 \div 6 = 8 \)  
   So, 6 and 8 are factors.

7. **Divide by 7:**  
   \( 48 \div 7 \) does not result in an integer, so 7 is not a factor.

After checking up to the square root of 48 (approximately 6.93), we have found all the factors. The complete list of factors of 48 is:  
1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16, 24, 48.

### Step 2: Solve an Equation Involving 48

Let's solve a simple equation where 48 is involved. Consider the equation:

\[ x + 48 = 100 \]

To solve for \( x \), we need to isolate \( x \) on one side of the equation. We can do this by subtracting 48 from both sides:

\[ x + 48 - 48 = 100 - 48 \]

This simplifies to:

\[ x = 52 \]

### Conclusion

The factors of 48 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16, 24, and 48.  
The solution to the equation \( x + 48 = 100 \) is \( x = 52 \).

Final Answer:  
Factors of 48: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16, 24, 48  
Solution to \( x + 48 = 100 \): \( x = 52 \)
