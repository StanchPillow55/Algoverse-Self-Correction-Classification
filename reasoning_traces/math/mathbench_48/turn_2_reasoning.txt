Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample math problem 48" refers to. Since there is no specific problem statement provided, I'll assume it involves a typical math problem that could be labeled as "48" in a sequence, such as a textbook or worksheet. Let's consider a common type of math problem that might be encountered in such a context, like solving an equation or performing a calculation.

For this exercise, I'll assume a problem involving solving a simple linear equation. Let's say the problem is:

**Solve for \( x \):**

\[ 3x + 5 = 20 \]

**Step-by-step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Equation:**
   The equation given is \( 3x + 5 = 20 \). This is a linear equation in one variable, \( x \).

2. **Isolate the Variable:**
   To solve for \( x \), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We can start by eliminating the constant term on the left side of the equation.

3. **Subtract 5 from Both Sides:**
   \[
   3x + 5 - 5 = 20 - 5
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   3x = 15
   \]

4. **Divide by the Coefficient of \( x \):**
   The next step is to divide both sides by the coefficient of \( x \), which is 3, to solve for \( x \).
   \[
   \frac{3x}{3} = \frac{15}{3}
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   x = 5
   \]

5. **Verify the Solution:**
   Substitute \( x = 5 \) back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies the equation.
   \[
   3(5) + 5 = 20
   \]
   \[
   15 + 5 = 20
   \]
   \[
   20 = 20
   \]
   The left side equals the right side, confirming that our solution is correct.

**Final Answer:**

The solution to the equation \( 3x + 5 = 20 \) is \( x = 5 \).
