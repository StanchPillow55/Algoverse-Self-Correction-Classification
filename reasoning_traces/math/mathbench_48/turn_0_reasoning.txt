It seems like the problem statement is incomplete or unclear. However, I'll assume that "Sample math problem 48" refers to a specific math problem that involves the number 48. Without additional context, I'll create a problem involving the number 48 and solve it step by step.

**Problem:**
Find the prime factorization of 48 and use it to determine the number of divisors of 48.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Prime Factorization of 48:**

   To find the prime factorization of 48, we start by dividing it by the smallest prime number, which is 2, and continue dividing by 2 until we can no longer do so evenly.

   \[
   48 \div 2 = 24
   \]

   \[
   24 \div 2 = 12
   \]

   \[
   12 \div 2 = 6
   \]

   \[
   6 \div 2 = 3
   \]

   Now, 3 is a prime number and cannot be divided by 2. So, we divide by 3:

   \[
   3 \div 3 = 1
   \]

   Therefore, the prime factorization of 48 is:

   \[
   48 = 2^4 \times 3^1
   \]

2. **Finding the Number of Divisors:**

   To find the number of divisors of a number given its prime factorization, we use the formula: If a number \( n \) has the prime factorization \( p_1^{a_1} \times p_2^{a_2} \times \ldots \times p_k^{a_k} \), then the number of divisors \( D(n) \) is given by:

   \[
   D(n) = (a_1 + 1)(a_2 + 1) \ldots (a_k + 1)
   \]

   For 48, the prime factorization is \( 2^4 \times 3^1 \). Therefore, the exponents are 4 and 1.

   \[
   D(48) = (4 + 1)(1 + 1) = 5 \times 2 = 10
   \]

   Thus, 48 has 10 divisors.

**Final Answer:**

The prime factorization of 48 is \( 2^4 \times 3^1 \), and the number of divisors of 48 is 10.
