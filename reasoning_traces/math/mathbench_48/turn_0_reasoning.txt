==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to understand what "Sample math problem 48" refers to. Since the problem itself is not explicitly stated, I'll assume it involves a basic mathematical operation with the number 48. Let's consider a few possibilities and solve them:

### Possibility 1: Basic Arithmetic Operations

1. **Addition**: Let's assume the problem is to add 48 to another number, say 25.
   \[
   48 + 25 = 73
   \]
   **Final Answer**: 73

2. **Subtraction**: Let's assume the problem is to subtract a number from 48, say 15.
   \[
   48 - 15 = 33
   \]
   **Final Answer**: 33

3. **Multiplication**: Let's assume the problem is to multiply 48 by another number, say 3.
   \[
   48 \times 3 = 144
   \]
   **Final Answer**: 144

4. **Division**: Let's assume the problem is to divide 48 by another number, say 4.
   \[
   48 \div 4 = 12
   \]
   **Final Answer**: 12

### Possibility 2: Factorization

Let's factor the number 48 into its prime factors.

1. Start by dividing by the smallest prime number, 2:
   \[
   48 \div 2 = 24
   \]
2. Divide 24 by 2:
   \[
   24 \div 2 = 12
   \]
3. Divide 12 by 2:
   \[
   12 \div 2 = 6
   \]
4. Divide 6 by 2:
   \[
   6 \div 2 = 3
   \]
5. Finally, divide 3 by 3:
   \[
   3 \div 3 = 1
   \]

The prime factorization of 48 is:
\[
48 = 2^4 \times 3^1
\]

**Final Answer**: \(2^4 \times 3^1\)

### Possibility 3: Solving for a Variable

Let's assume the problem involves solving for \(x\) in an equation like \(48 = 6x\).

1. Divide both sides by 6 to solve for \(x\):
   \[
   x = \frac{48}{6} = 8
   \]

**Final Answer**: \(x = 8\)

### Conclusion

Without a specific problem statement, I've provided solutions to several possible interpretations involving the number 48. If you have a specific problem in mind, please provide more details, and I can solve it accordingly.
