==================================================

To solve the problem, we first need to understand what "Sample math problem 48" refers to. Since the problem is not explicitly stated, I'll assume it's a placeholder for a typical math problem. Let's create a sample problem involving the number 48 and solve it.

**Sample Problem:**

Calculate the sum of all even numbers from 1 to 48.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Identify the Even Numbers:**
   - Even numbers are integers divisible by 2.
   - From 1 to 48, the even numbers are: 2, 4, 6, ..., 48.

2. **Determine the Sequence:**
   - This is an arithmetic sequence where the first term \( a_1 = 2 \) and the last term \( a_n = 48 \).
   - The common difference \( d = 2 \).

3. **Find the Number of Terms:**
   - The formula for the \( n \)-th term of an arithmetic sequence is:
     \[
     a_n = a_1 + (n-1) \cdot d
     \]
   - Plug in the known values to find \( n \):
     \[
     48 = 2 + (n-1) \cdot 2
     \]
     \[
     48 = 2 + 2n - 2
     \]
     \[
     48 = 2n
     \]
     \[
     n = \frac{48}{2} = 24
     \]
   - There are 24 even numbers from 1 to 48.

4. **Calculate the Sum of the Sequence:**
   - The sum \( S_n \) of an arithmetic sequence is given by:
     \[
     S_n = \frac{n}{2} \cdot (a_1 + a_n)
     \]
   - Substitute the known values:
     \[
     S_{24} = \frac{24}{2} \cdot (2 + 48)
     \]
     \[
     S_{24} = 12 \cdot 50
     \]
     \[
     S_{24} = 600
     \]

**Final Answer:**

The sum of all even numbers from 1 to 48 is 600.
