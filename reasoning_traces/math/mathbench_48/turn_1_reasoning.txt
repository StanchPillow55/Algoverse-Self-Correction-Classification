Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we first need to understand what "Sample math problem 48" refers to. Since the problem itself is not explicitly stated, I will assume it is a placeholder for a typical math problem. Let's consider a common type of math problem that involves basic arithmetic or algebra, and solve it step by step.

Let's assume the problem is:

**Problem:** Solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 3x + 5 = 20 \).

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Understand the Equation:**
   The given equation is \( 3x + 5 = 20 \). Our goal is to solve for \( x \).

2. **Isolate the Variable:**
   To isolate \( x \), we need to get rid of the constant term on the left side of the equation. We can do this by subtracting 5 from both sides.

   \[
   3x + 5 - 5 = 20 - 5
   \]

   Simplifying both sides gives:

   \[
   3x = 15
   \]

3. **Solve for \( x \):**
   Now, we need to solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides of the equation by 3.

   \[
   \frac{3x}{3} = \frac{15}{3}
   \]

   Simplifying both sides gives:

   \[
   x = 5
   \]

4. **Verify the Solution:**
   To ensure our solution is correct, we can substitute \( x = 5 \) back into the original equation and check if both sides are equal.

   Substitute \( x = 5 \) into \( 3x + 5 = 20 \):

   \[
   3(5) + 5 = 20
   \]

   Calculate the left side:

   \[
   15 + 5 = 20
   \]

   Since both sides are equal, our solution is verified.

### Final Answer:
The solution to the equation \( 3x + 5 = 20 \) is \( x = 5 \).
