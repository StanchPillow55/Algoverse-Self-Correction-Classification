Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample reasoning question 258," we need to first understand what the problem is asking. However, the problem statement is incomplete or unclear as it stands. Let's assume that "Sample reasoning question 258" refers to a specific math problem that involves reasoning skills, such as a logic puzzle or a word problem.

Since the problem is not explicitly stated, let's create a hypothetical math problem that involves reasoning and solve it step by step. Here's an example problem:

**Example Problem:**
A farmer has a total of 258 apples. He wants to distribute these apples equally among his 6 children. After distributing the apples, he wants to keep the remaining apples for himself. How many apples will each child receive, and how many apples will the farmer keep?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - Total number of apples = 258
   - Number of children = 6
   - We need to find out how many apples each child will receive and how many apples will be left for the farmer.

2. **Divide the Apples Equally:**
   - To find out how many apples each child will receive, we need to divide the total number of apples by the number of children.
   - Calculation: \( \frac{258}{6} \)

3. **Perform the Division:**
   - Divide 258 by 6:
     - 6 goes into 25 four times (since \( 6 \times 4 = 24 \)), leaving a remainder of 1.
     - Bring down the next digit (8), making it 18.
     - 6 goes into 18 three times (since \( 6 \times 3 = 18 \)), leaving a remainder of 0.

4. **Calculate the Result:**
   - Each child receives 43 apples.
   - Since there is no remainder, the farmer will keep 0 apples.

5. **Verify the Calculation:**
   - Multiply the number of apples each child receives by the number of children to ensure it matches the total number of apples:
     - \( 43 \times 6 = 258 \)
   - The calculation is correct.

**Final Answer:**
Each child will receive 43 apples, and the farmer will keep 0 apples.
