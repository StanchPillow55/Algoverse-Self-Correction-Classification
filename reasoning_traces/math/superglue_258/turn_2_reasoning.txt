==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample reasoning question 258," we need to first understand what the question is asking. However, since the problem statement is not provided, I will demonstrate a general approach to solving a math problem by creating a hypothetical problem and solving it step by step.

Let's assume the problem is as follows:

**Problem:**  
A store sells apples at $2 each and oranges at $3 each. If a customer buys a total of 10 fruits consisting of apples and oranges and spends a total of $25, how many apples and how many oranges did the customer buy?

**Solution:**

To solve this problem, we can use a system of equations. Let's define two variables:
- Let \( a \) be the number of apples.
- Let \( o \) be the number of oranges.

We have two pieces of information that can be translated into equations:
1. The total number of fruits is 10.
2. The total cost of the fruits is $25.

From the first piece of information, we can write the equation:
\[ a + o = 10 \]

From the second piece of information, we can write the equation for the total cost:
\[ 2a + 3o = 25 \]

Now, we have the following system of equations:
1. \( a + o = 10 \)
2. \( 2a + 3o = 25 \)

We can solve this system using the substitution or elimination method. Here, I'll use the substitution method:

From equation (1), solve for \( a \):
\[ a = 10 - o \]

Substitute \( a = 10 - o \) into equation (2):
\[ 2(10 - o) + 3o = 25 \]

Simplify and solve for \( o \):
\[ 20 - 2o + 3o = 25 \]
\[ 20 + o = 25 \]
\[ o = 25 - 20 \]
\[ o = 5 \]

Now that we have \( o = 5 \), substitute back into equation (1) to find \( a \):
\[ a + 5 = 10 \]
\[ a = 10 - 5 \]
\[ a = 5 \]

Therefore, the customer bought 5 apples and 5 oranges.

**Final Answer:**
The customer bought 5 apples and 5 oranges.
