==================================================

It seems like the question you've provided is not complete or specific. "Sample reasoning question 258" does not give enough information for me to understand what the problem is about. However, I can guide you through a general approach to solving math problems by showing a step-by-step process. If you have a specific math problem in mind, please provide the details, and I can work through it with you.

Here's a general approach to solving a math problem:

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - Read the problem carefully.
   - Identify what is being asked.
   - Determine what information is given and what needs to be found.

2. **Devise a Plan:**
   - Think about the strategies that could be used to solve the problem. This could include drawing a diagram, creating an equation, or breaking the problem into smaller parts.

3. **Carry Out the Plan:**
   - Execute the steps you have planned.
   - Perform calculations carefully.
   - Keep track of units and ensure consistency.

4. **Review/Check the Solution:**
   - Verify that your solution makes sense.
   - Check your calculations and reasoning.
   - Ensure that you have answered the question that was asked.

Since I don't have a specific problem to solve, I'll illustrate this process with a simple example:

**Example Problem:**
A rectangle has a length that is twice its width. If the perimeter of the rectangle is 36 units, what are the dimensions of the rectangle?

**Step 1: Understand the Problem**
- We need to find the length and width of the rectangle.
- We know the perimeter is 36 units.
- The length is twice the width.

**Step 2: Devise a Plan**
- Use the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle: \( P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width}) \).
- Let the width be \( w \).
- Then the length is \( 2w \).
- Substitute these into the perimeter formula.

**Step 3: Carry Out the Plan**
- The perimeter formula becomes: \( 36 = 2 \times (2w + w) \).
- Simplify inside the parentheses: \( 36 = 2 \times 3w \).
- Simplify further: \( 36 = 6w \).
- Solve for \( w \): \( w = \frac{36}{6} = 6 \).

- Now find the length: \( \text{length} = 2w = 2 \times 6 = 12 \).

**Step 4: Review/Check the Solution**
- Check the perimeter with these dimensions: \( 2 \times (12 + 6) = 2 \times 18 = 36 \).
- The calculations are correct, and the solution makes sense.

**Final Answer:**
The width of the rectangle is 6 units, and the length is 12 units.

If you have a specific problem or question, please provide the details, and I'll be happy to help you solve it!
