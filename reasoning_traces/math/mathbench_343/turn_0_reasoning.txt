==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what is being asked. The problem statement is "Sample math problem 343." This is quite vague, as it doesn't specify what kind of math problem it is. However, the number 343 might be a clue. 

Let's explore the number 343:

1. **Identify the nature of 343:**
   - 343 is a number that might have some mathematical significance. One common approach is to check if it is a perfect power, such as a perfect square or a perfect cube.

2. **Check if 343 is a perfect cube:**
   - A perfect cube is a number that can be expressed as \( n^3 \) where \( n \) is an integer.
   - Let's find the cube root of 343.

3. **Calculate the cube root of 343:**
   - We need to find an integer \( n \) such that \( n^3 = 343 \).
   - Start by estimating: 
     - \( 5^3 = 125 \)
     - \( 6^3 = 216 \)
     - \( 7^3 = 343 \)

4. **Verification:**
   - Calculate \( 7^3 \) to verify:
     \[
     7^3 = 7 \times 7 \times 7
     \]
     \[
     7 \times 7 = 49
     \]
     \[
     49 \times 7 = 343
     \]
   - Therefore, \( 7^3 = 343 \).

5. **Conclusion:**
   - 343 is indeed a perfect cube, and its cube root is 7.

Thus, if the problem was to find the cube root of 343, the answer is:

\[
\boxed{7}
\]
