==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to understand what "Sample math problem 343" refers to. Since the problem itself isn't specified, I'll assume it involves the number 343 and explore a few mathematical aspects related to it. Let's consider a common type of problem involving the number 343, such as finding its prime factorization or determining its cube root.

### Step 1: Determine the Cube Root of 343

343 is a number that might be recognized as a perfect cube. Let's check if it is a perfect cube by finding its cube root.

1. **Estimate the Cube Root:**
   - We know that \(7^3 = 7 \times 7 \times 7 = 343\).
   - Therefore, the cube root of 343 is 7.

2. **Verification:**
   - Calculate \(7^3\) to verify:
     \[
     7 \times 7 = 49
     \]
     \[
     49 \times 7 = 343
     \]
   - Since \(7^3 = 343\), our calculation is correct.

### Step 2: Prime Factorization of 343

Next, let's find the prime factorization of 343.

1. **Divide by Smallest Prime:**
   - Start with the smallest prime number, which is 2. Since 343 is odd, it is not divisible by 2.
   - Next, try dividing by 3. The sum of the digits of 343 is \(3 + 4 + 3 = 10\), which is not divisible by 3, so 343 is not divisible by 3.
   - Try dividing by 5. Since 343 does not end in 0 or 5, it is not divisible by 5.
   - Try dividing by 7:
     \[
     343 \div 7 = 49
     \]
   - 49 is \(7 \times 7\), so we continue factoring:
     \[
     49 \div 7 = 7
     \]
   - Finally, \(7 \div 7 = 1\).

2. **Prime Factorization:**
   - The prime factorization of 343 is \(7 \times 7 \times 7\) or \(7^3\).

### Conclusion

The number 343 is a perfect cube, and its cube root is 7. Additionally, its prime factorization is \(7^3\).

**Final Answer:**
- The cube root of 343 is 7.
- The prime factorization of 343 is \(7^3\).
