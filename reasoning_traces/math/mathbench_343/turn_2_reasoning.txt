==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample math problem 343" refers to. Since the problem is not explicitly stated, I'll assume it involves the number 343 and explore a few mathematical concepts related to it. Let's break it down step by step:

### Step 1: Identify the Nature of 343
The number 343 is an integer. Let's first determine if it has any special properties.

#### Check if 343 is a Perfect Cube
To check if 343 is a perfect cube, we need to find an integer \( n \) such that \( n^3 = 343 \).

1. Calculate the cube root of 343:
   \[
   \sqrt[3]{343} = 7
   \]
   This is because:
   \[
   7^3 = 7 \times 7 \times 7 = 49 \times 7 = 343
   \]
   Therefore, 343 is a perfect cube, specifically \( 7^3 \).

### Step 2: Factorization of 343
Let's factor 343 to see its prime factors.

1. Since we already know \( 343 = 7^3 \), the prime factorization of 343 is:
   \[
   343 = 7 \times 7 \times 7
   \]

### Step 3: Divisors of 343
Using the prime factorization, we can find all divisors of 343.

1. The divisors are determined by the combinations of the powers of the prime factors:
   - \( 7^0 = 1 \)
   - \( 7^1 = 7 \)
   - \( 7^2 = 49 \)
   - \( 7^3 = 343 \)

   Therefore, the divisors of 343 are 1, 7, 49, and 343.

### Step 4: Check if 343 is a Prime Number
A prime number has exactly two distinct positive divisors: 1 and itself. Since 343 has more than two divisors (1, 7, 49, 343), it is not a prime number.

### Conclusion
The number 343 is a perfect cube, specifically \( 7^3 \), and it is not a prime number. Its divisors are 1, 7, 49, and 343.

**Final Answer:**
343 is a perfect cube (\( 7^3 \)), not a prime number, and its divisors are 1, 7, 49, and 343.
