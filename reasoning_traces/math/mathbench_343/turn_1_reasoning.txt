==================================================

To solve the sample math problem 343, we first need to understand what the problem is asking. However, since the problem statement is not provided, I'll assume that the problem involves the number 343 in some mathematical context. A common problem involving the number 343 is finding its cube root or determining its prime factorization. Let's explore these possibilities:

### Finding the Cube Root of 343

1. **Recognize the Number**: 
   - 343 is a relatively small number, and it might be a perfect cube. 

2. **Estimate the Cube Root**:
   - We know that \(7^3 = 7 \times 7 \times 7\).
   - Calculate \(7 \times 7 = 49\).
   - Then, calculate \(49 \times 7 = 343\).

3. **Conclusion**:
   - Since \(7^3 = 343\), the cube root of 343 is 7.

### Prime Factorization of 343

1. **Start with the Smallest Prime**:
   - Check if 343 is divisible by 2. Since 343 is odd, it is not divisible by 2.

2. **Check Divisibility by 3**:
   - Sum of the digits of 343 is \(3 + 4 + 3 = 10\). Since 10 is not divisible by 3, 343 is not divisible by 3.

3. **Check Divisibility by 5**:
   - 343 does not end in 0 or 5, so it is not divisible by 5.

4. **Check Divisibility by 7**:
   - Perform the division: \(343 \div 7 = 49\).
   - Since 49 is \(7 \times 7\), we have \(343 = 7 \times 7 \times 7 = 7^3\).

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The prime factorization of 343 is \(7^3\).

### Final Answer

Based on the assumptions and calculations above, the final answer to the problem involving the number 343, assuming it was about finding the cube root or prime factorization, is:

- The cube root of 343 is 7.
- The prime factorization of 343 is \(7^3\).

If the original problem had a different context or requirement, please provide additional details for a more specific solution.
