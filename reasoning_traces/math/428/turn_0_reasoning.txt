To find the total number of eggs laid by the frog over the span of 4 days, we will calculate the number of eggs laid each day step by step.

1. **Day 1**: The frog lays 50 eggs.
   \[
   \text{Eggs on Day 1} = 50
   \]

2. **Day 2**: The frog doubles her production from Day 1.
   \[
   \text{Eggs on Day 2} = 2 \times \text{Eggs on Day 1} = 2 \times 50 = 100
   \]

3. **Day 3**: The frog lays 20 more eggs than she did on Day 2.
   \[
   \text{Eggs on Day 3} = \text{Eggs on Day 2} + 20 = 100 + 20 = 120
   \]

4. **Day 4**: The frog doubles the total number of eggs laid in the first three days.
   - First, we need to calculate the total number of eggs laid in the first three days:
   \[
   \text{Total for Days 1, 2, and 3} = \text{Eggs on Day 1} + \text{Eggs on Day 2} + \text{Eggs on Day 3}
   \]
   \[
   = 50 + 100 + 120 = 270
   \]
   - Now, we double this total for Day 4:
   \[
   \text{Eggs on Day 4} = 2 \times \text{Total for Days 1, 2, and 3} = 2 \times 270 = 540
   \]

5. **Total Eggs Laid**: Now we can find the total number of eggs laid over the 4 days by adding the eggs from each day:
   \[
   \text{Total Eggs} = \text{Eggs on Day 1} + \text{Eggs on Day 2} + \text{Eggs on Day 3} + \text{Eggs on Day 4}
   \]
   \[
   = 50 + 100 + 120 + 540 = 810
   \]

Thus, the total number of eggs laid by the frog over the span of the 4 days is \(\boxed{810}\).
