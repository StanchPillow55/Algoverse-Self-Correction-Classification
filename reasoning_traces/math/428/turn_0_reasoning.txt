==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of eggs laid by the frog each day and then sum them up to find the total number of eggs laid over the 4 days.

**Day 1:**
- The frog lays 50 eggs.

**Day 2:**
- The frog doubles her production from the first day.
- Eggs laid on Day 2 = 2 × 50 = 100 eggs.

**Day 3:**
- The frog lays 20 more eggs than she did on the second day.
- Eggs laid on Day 3 = 100 + 20 = 120 eggs.

**Day 4:**
- The frog doubles the total number of eggs laid over the first three days.
- First, we need to calculate the total number of eggs laid over the first three days:
  - Total eggs from Day 1, Day 2, and Day 3 = 50 + 100 + 120 = 270 eggs.
- On Day 4, the frog lays double this amount:
  - Eggs laid on Day 4 = 2 × 270 = 540 eggs.

**Total Eggs Laid Over 4 Days:**
- Now, we sum up the eggs laid over all four days:
  - Total eggs = Eggs on Day 1 + Eggs on Day 2 + Eggs on Day 3 + Eggs on Day 4
  - Total eggs = 50 + 100 + 120 + 540 = 810 eggs.

Therefore, the frog laid a total of 810 eggs over the span of the 4 days.

**Final Answer:**
The frog laid a total of 810 eggs over the 4 days.
