Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of eggs the frog lays each day and then sum them up.

**Day 1:**
- The frog lays 50 eggs.

**Day 2:**
- The frog doubles her production from Day 1.
- Eggs on Day 2 = 2 × 50 = 100 eggs.

**Day 3:**
- The frog lays 20 more eggs than she did on Day 2.
- Eggs on Day 3 = 100 + 20 = 120 eggs.

**Day 4:**
- The frog doubles the total number of eggs laid over the first three days.
- First, calculate the total eggs from Days 1, 2, and 3:
  - Total eggs from Days 1, 2, and 3 = 50 + 100 + 120 = 270 eggs.
- Eggs on Day 4 = 2 × 270 = 540 eggs.

**Total Eggs Over 4 Days:**
- Sum the eggs from all four days:
  - Total eggs = 50 (Day 1) + 100 (Day 2) + 120 (Day 3) + 540 (Day 4) = 810 eggs.

Therefore, the frog laid a total of 810 eggs over the span of 4 days.

**Final Answer: 810 eggs**
