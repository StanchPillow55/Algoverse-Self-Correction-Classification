==================================================

To find out how much Sab and Dane will earn each after selling shoes and shirts, we need to calculate the total earnings from both items and then divide that total by 2, since they are sharing the earnings equally.

**Step 1: Calculate the earnings from the shoes.**

The cost of each pair of shoes is $3, and they sold 6 pairs. 

\[
\text{Earnings from shoes} = \text{Number of pairs} \times \text{Cost per pair}
\]
\[
\text{Earnings from shoes} = 6 \times 3 = 18 \text{ dollars}
\]

**Step 2: Calculate the earnings from the shirts.**

The cost of each shirt is $2, and they sold 18 shirts.

\[
\text{Earnings from shirts} = \text{Number of shirts} \times \text{Cost per shirt}
\]
\[
\text{Earnings from shirts} = 18 \times 2 = 36 \text{ dollars}
\]

**Step 3: Calculate the total earnings.**

Now, we add the earnings from the shoes and the shirts to find the total earnings.

\[
\text{Total earnings} = \text{Earnings from shoes} + \text{Earnings from shirts}
\]
\[
\text{Total earnings} = 18 + 36 = 54 \text{ dollars}
\]

**Step 4: Divide the total earnings by 2.**

Since Sab and Dane are dividing the total earnings equally, we divide the total earnings by 2.

\[
\text{Earnings per person} = \frac{\text{Total earnings}}{2}
\]
\[
\text{Earnings per person} = \frac{54}{2} = 27 \text{ dollars}
\]

**Final Answer:**

Each of them will earn **$27**.
