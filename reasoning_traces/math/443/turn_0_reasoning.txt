==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total earnings from selling the shoes and shirts, and then divide that total equally between Sab and Dane.

### Step 1: Calculate the total earnings from the shoes.

- Sab and Dane sold 6 pairs of shoes.
- Each pair of shoes costs $3.

To find the total earnings from the shoes, multiply the number of pairs by the cost per pair:

\[
6 \text{ pairs} \times 3 \text{ dollars per pair} = 18 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the total earnings from the shirts.

- They sold 18 shirts.
- Each shirt costs $2.

To find the total earnings from the shirts, multiply the number of shirts by the cost per shirt:

\[
18 \text{ shirts} \times 2 \text{ dollars per shirt} = 36 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the total earnings from both shoes and shirts.

Add the earnings from the shoes and the shirts to find the total earnings:

\[
18 \text{ dollars (from shoes)} + 36 \text{ dollars (from shirts)} = 54 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Step 4: Divide the total earnings between Sab and Dane.

Since Sab and Dane are dividing their total earnings equally, divide the total earnings by 2:

\[
\frac{54 \text{ dollars}}{2} = 27 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Final Answer:

Each of them, Sab and Dane, will earn $27.
