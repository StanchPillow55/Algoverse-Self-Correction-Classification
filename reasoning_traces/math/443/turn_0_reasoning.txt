==================================================

To solve the problem, we will first calculate Jon's total time for the triathlon, then determine James's time for each segment of the triathlon, and finally find out how long it took James to complete the run.

### Step 1: Calculate Jon's Total Time

1. **Swim Time**: 40 minutes
2. **Bike Time**: 1 hour and 20 minutes = 80 minutes
3. **Run Time**: 50 minutes

Now, we can calculate Jon's total time:

\[
\text{Total Time for Jon} = \text{Swim Time} + \text{Bike Time} + \text{Run Time}
\]

\[
\text{Total Time for Jon} = 40 + 80 + 50 = 170 \text{ minutes}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate James's Swim Time

James swims 10% faster than Jon. To find James's swim time, we first need to determine how long it takes Jon to swim 1 minute. If Jon takes 40 minutes to swim, then:

\[
\text{Speed of Jon} = \frac{1 \text{ distance unit}}{40 \text{ minutes}} \quad \text{(let's assume distance unit is arbitrary)}
\]

Since James swims 10% faster, his speed is:

\[
\text{Speed of James} = 1.1 \times \text{Speed of Jon} = 1.1 \times \frac{1 \text{ distance unit}}{40 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1.1 \text{ distance unit}}{40 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1 \text{ distance unit}}{36.36 \text{ minutes}}
\]

Now, we can calculate James's swim time:

\[
\text{Swim Time for James} = \frac{40 \text{ minutes}}{1.1} \approx 36.36 \text{ minutes}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate James's Bike Time

James takes 5 minutes longer than Jon on the bike. Since Jon's bike time is 80 minutes:

\[
\text{Bike Time for James} = 80 + 5 = 85 \text{ minutes}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate James's Total Time Before the Run

Now we can calculate the total time for James before he runs:

\[
\text{Total Time for James (before run)} = \text{Swim Time for James} + \text{Bike Time for James}
\]

\[
\text{Total Time for James (before run)} = 36.36 + 85 = 121.36 \text{ minutes}
\]

### Step 5: Calculate James's Total Time

Jon won by 10 minutes, meaning James's total time is:

\[
\text{Total Time for James} = \text{Total Time for Jon} - 10
\]

\[
\text{Total Time for James} = 170 - 10 = 160 \text{ minutes}
\]

### Step 6: Calculate James's Run Time

Now we can find out how long it took James to do the run:

\[
\text{Run Time for James} = \text{Total Time for James} - \text{Total Time for James (before run)}
\]

\[
\text{Run Time for James} = 160 - 121.36 = 38.64 \text{ minutes}
\]

### Final Answer

Thus, the time it took James to do the run is approximately:

\[
\boxed{38.64 \text{ minutes}}
\]
