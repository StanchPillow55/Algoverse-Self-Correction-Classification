Question ID: 443
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to calculate the total time it takes for both Jon and James to complete the triathlon and then determine how long James took for the run.

### Step 1: Calculate Jon's Total Time

1. **Swim**: 40 minutes
2. **Bike**: 1 hour and 20 minutes = 80 minutes
3. **Run**: 50 minutes

Now, we add these times together:

\[
\text{Total time for Jon} = 40 + 80 + 50 = 170 \text{ minutes}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate James's Swim Time

James swims 10% faster than Jon. To find James's swim time, we first calculate how long it takes Jon to swim 100% of the distance and then determine what 90% of that time is (since he is 10% faster).

\[
\text{James's swim time} = 40 \text{ minutes} \times (1 - 0.10) = 40 \times 0.90 = 36 \text{ minutes}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate James's Bike Time

James takes 5 minutes longer than Jon on the bike ride.

\[
\text{James's bike time} = 80 \text{ minutes} + 5 \text{ minutes} = 85 \text{ minutes}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate James's Total Time Without the Run

Now we can calculate James's total time for the swim and bike:

\[
\text{Total time for swim and bike for James} = 36 + 85 = 121 \text{ minutes}
\]

### Step 5: Determine Jon's Winning Time

Jon won by 10 minutes, which means James's total time for the triathlon is:

\[
\text{James's total time} = \text{Jon's total time} + 10 \text{ minutes} = 170 + 10 = 180 \text{ minutes}
\]

### Step 6: Calculate James's Run Time

Now we can find out how long James took for the run by subtracting his swim and bike times from his total time:

\[
\text{James's run time} = \text{James's total time} - \text{Total time for swim and bike for James}
\]

\[
\text{James's run time} = 180 \text{ minutes} - 121 \text{ minutes} = 59 \text{ minutes}
\]

### Final Answer

James took **59 minutes** to do the run.
