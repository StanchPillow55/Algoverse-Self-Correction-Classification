Question ID: 443
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To find out how much Sab and Dane will earn each after selling shoes and shirts, we need to calculate their total earnings from both items and then divide that amount by two.

**Step 1: Calculate the earnings from shoes.**
- They sold 6 pairs of shoes.
- Each pair of shoes costs $3.

Total earnings from shoes:
\[
\text{Earnings from shoes} = \text{Number of shoes} \times \text{Cost per shoe} = 6 \times 3 = 18 \text{ dollars}
\]

**Step 2: Calculate the earnings from shirts.**
- They sold 18 shirts.
- Each shirt costs $2.

Total earnings from shirts:
\[
\text{Earnings from shirts} = \text{Number of shirts} \times \text{Cost per shirt} = 18 \times 2 = 36 \text{ dollars}
\]

**Step 3: Calculate the total earnings.**
Now, we add the earnings from shoes and shirts:
\[
\text{Total earnings} = \text{Earnings from shoes} + \text{Earnings from shirts} = 18 + 36 = 54 \text{ dollars}
\]

**Step 4: Divide the total earnings by 2.**
Since Sab and Dane will divide the total earnings equally:
\[
\text{Earnings per person} = \frac{\text{Total earnings}}{2} = \frac{54}{2} = 27 \text{ dollars}
\]

**Final Answer:**
Each of them will earn $27.
