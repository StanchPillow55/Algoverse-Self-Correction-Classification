To solve the problem effectively, I need more context or details about "Sample reasoning question 58." Since the question is not provided, I'll demonstrate how to approach a generic math problem by breaking it down step by step. If you have a specific problem in mind, please provide the details, and I'll be happy to assist.

Let's consider a sample math problem:

**Problem:**
A rectangle has a length that is twice its width. If the perimeter of the rectangle is 36 units, find the dimensions of the rectangle.

**Step-by-step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We have a rectangle with a length (L) and a width (W).
   - The length is twice the width: \( L = 2W \).
   - The perimeter of the rectangle is 36 units.

2. **Recall the Formula for Perimeter:**
   - The perimeter (P) of a rectangle is given by the formula:
     \[
     P = 2L + 2W
     \]

3. **Substitute Known Values:**
   - Substitute \( L = 2W \) into the perimeter formula:
     \[
     36 = 2(2W) + 2W
     \]

4. **Simplify the Equation:**
   - Simplify the expression:
     \[
     36 = 4W + 2W
     \]
     \[
     36 = 6W
     \]

5. **Solve for W:**
   - Divide both sides of the equation by 6 to solve for W:
     \[
     W = \frac{36}{6} = 6
     \]

6. **Find the Length:**
   - Since \( L = 2W \), substitute \( W = 6 \) into the equation for L:
     \[
     L = 2 \times 6 = 12
     \]

7. **Verify the Solution:**
   - Check that the dimensions satisfy the original perimeter condition:
     \[
     P = 2L + 2W = 2(12) + 2(6) = 24 + 12 = 36
     \]
   - The calculated perimeter matches the given perimeter, confirming the solution is correct.

**Final Answer:**
The dimensions of the rectangle are a width of 6 units and a length of 12 units.
