==================================================

To solve this problem, I need to clarify what "Sample reasoning question 58" refers to, as it seems to be a placeholder or a specific reference that isn't clear in this context. Since I don't have access to external databases or specific documents, I'll need to make some assumptions or create a hypothetical problem to demonstrate how to solve a reasoning question.

Let's assume "Sample reasoning question 58" is a typical math reasoning problem. I'll create a hypothetical problem and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**

A train travels from City A to City B, a distance of 300 kilometers, at a speed of 60 kilometers per hour. It then travels from City B to City C, a distance of 180 kilometers, at a speed of 90 kilometers per hour. What is the total travel time for the train from City A to City C?

**Step-by-step Solution:**

1. **Calculate the time taken to travel from City A to City B:**

   - Distance from City A to City B = 300 kilometers
   - Speed = 60 kilometers per hour

   Using the formula for time, \( \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \):

   \[
   \text{Time from A to B} = \frac{300 \text{ km}}{60 \text{ km/h}} = 5 \text{ hours}
   \]

2. **Calculate the time taken to travel from City B to City C:**

   - Distance from City B to City C = 180 kilometers
   - Speed = 90 kilometers per hour

   Again, using the formula for time:

   \[
   \text{Time from B to C} = \frac{180 \text{ km}}{90 \text{ km/h}} = 2 \text{ hours}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total travel time from City A to City C:**

   Add the time taken for each segment of the journey:

   \[
   \text{Total travel time} = \text{Time from A to B} + \text{Time from B to C} = 5 \text{ hours} + 2 \text{ hours} = 7 \text{ hours}
   \]

**Final Answer:**

The total travel time for the train from City A to City C is 7 hours.

This hypothetical problem demonstrates how to break down a reasoning question involving travel time and speed into manageable steps, ensuring each part of the journey is calculated separately before summing the results for the final answer.
