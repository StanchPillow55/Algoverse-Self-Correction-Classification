==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to set up a system of equations based on the information given.

Let:
- \( c \) = number of chickens
- \( w \) = number of cows

From the problem, we have two pieces of information:

1. The total number of animals is 20:
   \[
   c + w = 20
   \]

2. The total number of legs is 70. Chickens have 2 legs each and cows have 4 legs each:
   \[
   2c + 4w = 70
   \]

Now we have a system of equations:
1. \( c + w = 20 \)  (Equation 1)
2. \( 2c + 4w = 70 \)  (Equation 2)

We can simplify Equation 2 by dividing everything by 2:
\[
c + 2w = 35  \quad \text{(Equation 3)}
\]

Now we have:
1. \( c + w = 20 \)  (Equation 1)
2. \( c + 2w = 35 \)  (Equation 3)

Next, we can solve this system of equations. We can subtract Equation 1 from Equation 3:
\[
(c + 2w) - (c + w) = 35 - 20
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
w = 15
\]

Now that we have \( w \), we can substitute it back into Equation 1 to find \( c \):
\[
c + 15 = 20
\]
Subtracting 15 from both sides gives:
\[
c = 5
\]

Thus, the number of chickens is \( c = 5 \).

To verify, we can check the total number of legs:
- Chickens: \( 5 \times 2 = 10 \) legs
- Cows: \( 15 \times 4 = 60 \) legs
- Total legs: \( 10 + 60 = 70 \) legs, which matches the information given in the problem.

Therefore, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{5}
\]
