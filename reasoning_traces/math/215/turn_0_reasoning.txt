==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of adults and children in the church and then find out how many more children there are than adults.

**Step 1: Calculate the number of adults.**

The problem states that 40% of the church members are adults. To find the number of adults, we calculate 40% of the total number of members, which is 120.

\[
\text{Number of adults} = 40\% \times 120
\]

Convert the percentage to a decimal by dividing by 100:

\[
40\% = \frac{40}{100} = 0.4
\]

Now, multiply this by the total number of members:

\[
\text{Number of adults} = 0.4 \times 120 = 48
\]

So, there are 48 adults in the church.

**Step 2: Calculate the number of children.**

The rest of the members are children. Since the total number of members is 120, we subtract the number of adults from the total to find the number of children:

\[
\text{Number of children} = 120 - \text{Number of adults}
\]

Substitute the number of adults:

\[
\text{Number of children} = 120 - 48 = 72
\]

So, there are 72 children in the church.

**Step 3: Calculate how many more children there are than adults.**

To find how many more children there are than adults, subtract the number of adults from the number of children:

\[
\text{Difference} = \text{Number of children} - \text{Number of adults}
\]

Substitute the numbers we found:

\[
\text{Difference} = 72 - 48 = 24
\]

**Final Answer:**

There are 24 more children than adults in the church.
