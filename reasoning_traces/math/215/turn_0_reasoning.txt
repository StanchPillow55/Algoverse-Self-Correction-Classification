==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of adults and children in the church, and then find out how many more children there are than adults.

1. **Calculate the number of adults:**
   We know that 40% of the church members are adults. The total number of members is 120.

   To find the number of adults, we calculate 40% of 120:
   \[
   \text{Number of adults} = 0.40 \times 120
   \]
   \[
   \text{Number of adults} = 48
   \]

2. **Calculate the number of children:**
   Since the rest of the members are children, we can find the number of children by subtracting the number of adults from the total number of members:
   \[
   \text{Number of children} = \text{Total members} - \text{Number of adults}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Number of children} = 120 - 48
   \]
   \[
   \text{Number of children} = 72
   \]

3. **Determine how many more children there are than adults:**
   To find out how many more children there are than adults, we subtract the number of adults from the number of children:
   \[
   \text{Difference} = \text{Number of children} - \text{Number of adults}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Difference} = 72 - 48
   \]
   \[
   \text{Difference} = 24
   \]

Thus, there are 24 more children than adults in the church.

**Final Answer:**
There are 24 more children than adults.
