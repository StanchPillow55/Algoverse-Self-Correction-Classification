Question ID: mathbench_298
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 298," we need to first understand what the problem is asking. However, the problem statement "Sample math problem 298" is not specific enough for us to determine the exact question or the mathematical operations involved. 

Since the problem is not clearly defined, let's assume a hypothetical math problem related to the number 298. We will create a problem and solve it step by step.

### Hypothetical Problem:
Calculate the sum of the digits of the number 298, and then determine if the sum is a prime number.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Identify the Digits of the Number:**
   - The number 298 consists of the digits 2, 9, and 8.

2. **Calculate the Sum of the Digits:**
   - Sum = 2 + 9 + 8

3. **Perform the Addition:**
   - First, add 2 and 9:
     \[
     2 + 9 = 11
     \]
   - Then, add the result to 8:
     \[
     11 + 8 = 19
     \]

4. **Determine if the Sum is a Prime Number:**
   - A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.
   - Check the divisibility of 19:
     - 19 is not divisible by 2 (it's odd).
     - 19 is not divisible by 3 (sum of digits, 1 + 9 = 10, is not divisible by 3).
     - 19 is not divisible by 5 (it does not end in 0 or 5).
   - Since 19 is not divisible by any number other than 1 and 19, it is a prime number.

### Conclusion:
The sum of the digits of 298 is 19, and 19 is a prime number.

**Final Answer:**
The sum of the digits of 298 is 19, which is a prime number.
