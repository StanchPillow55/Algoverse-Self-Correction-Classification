==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to determine how much charcoal Jason will add when he uses 900 ml of water, given the ratio of charcoal to water.

1. **Identify the ratio of charcoal to water**: 
   The problem states that Jason needs to add 2 grams of charcoal for every 30 ml of water. This can be expressed as a ratio:
   \[
   \text{Charcoal (grams)} : \text{Water (ml)} = 2 : 30
   \]

2. **Determine how many times the ratio fits into the amount of water used**:
   We need to find out how many 30 ml portions are in 900 ml of water. We do this by dividing the total amount of water by the amount of water per ratio:
   \[
   \text{Number of portions} = \frac{900 \text{ ml}}{30 \text{ ml}} = 30
   \]

3. **Calculate the total amount of charcoal needed**:
   Since each portion requires 2 grams of charcoal, we multiply the number of portions by the amount of charcoal per portion:
   \[
   \text{Total charcoal} = \text{Number of portions} \times \text{Charcoal per portion} = 30 \times 2 \text{ grams} = 60 \text{ grams}
   \]

4. **Final answer**:
   Therefore, the total amount of charcoal that Jason adds when he uses 900 ml of water is:
   \[
   \boxed{60 \text{ grams}}
   \]
