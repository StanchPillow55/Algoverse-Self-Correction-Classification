To determine how much you will save by buying 2 tubs of ice cream and 4 packets of milk, we need to calculate the total cost of these items at their original prices and at their discounted prices. Then, we will find the difference to see the total savings.

### Step 1: Calculate the cost of ice cream

1. **Original price of one tub of ice cream**: $13
2. **Discounted price of one tub of ice cream**: $11
3. **Number of tubs of ice cream to buy**: 2

**Total cost of ice cream at discounted price**:
\[
\text{Total cost of ice cream} = \text{Discounted price} \times \text{Number of tubs} = 11 \times 2 = 22
\]

**Total cost of ice cream at original price**:
\[
\text{Total cost of ice cream at original price} = \text{Original price} \times \text{Number of tubs} = 13 \times 2 = 26
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the cost of milk

1. **Original price of one packet of milk**: Let's denote it as \( P \).
2. **Discount on one packet of milk**: $0.5
3. **Discounted price of one packet of milk**: \( P - 0.5 \)
4. **Number of packets of milk to buy**: 4

**Total cost of milk at discounted price**:
\[
\text{Total cost of milk} = (P - 0.5) \times 4
\]

**Total cost of milk at original price**:
\[
\text{Total cost of milk at original price} = P \times 4
\]

### Step 3: Calculate total costs

**Total cost at discounted prices**:
\[
\text{Total cost (discounted)} = \text{Total cost of ice cream} + \text{Total cost of milk} = 22 + (P - 0.5) \times 4
\]

**Total cost at original prices**:
\[
\text{Total cost (original)} = \text{Total cost of ice cream at original price} + \text{Total cost of milk at original price} = 26 + P \times 4
\]

### Step 4: Calculate savings

**Savings**:
\[
\text{Savings} = \text{Total cost (original)} - \text{Total cost (discounted)}
\]
Substituting the expressions we derived:
\[
\text{Savings} = \left(26 + P \times 4\right) - \left(22 + (P - 0.5) \times 4\right)
\]

### Step 5: Simplify the savings expression

Expanding the savings expression:
\[
\text{Savings} = 26 + 4P - 22 - (4P - 2) = 26 + 4P - 22 - 4P + 2
\]
\[
\text{Savings} = 26 - 22 + 2 = 6
\]

### Final Answer

You will save **$6** if you buy 2 tubs of ice cream and 4 packets of milk.
