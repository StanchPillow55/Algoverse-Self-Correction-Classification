==================================================

To determine how much charcoal Jason needs to add when he uses 900 ml of water, we can set up a proportion based on the given ratio of charcoal to water.

1. **Identify the ratio of charcoal to water**: 
   - The problem states that for every 30 ml of water, Jason adds 2 grams of charcoal.

2. **Set up the proportion**:
   - We can express the relationship as:
     \[
     \frac{2 \text{ grams of charcoal}}{30 \text{ ml of water}} = \frac{x \text{ grams of charcoal}}{900 \text{ ml of water}}
     \]
   - Here, \( x \) is the amount of charcoal we want to find.

3. **Cross-multiply to solve for \( x \)**:
   \[
   2 \text{ grams} \times 900 \text{ ml} = 30 \text{ ml} \times x \text{ grams}
   \]
   \[
   1800 = 30x
   \]

4. **Solve for \( x \)**:
   - Divide both sides by 30:
   \[
   x = \frac{1800}{30} = 60
   \]

5. **Conclusion**:
   - Jason needs to add **60 grams of charcoal** for 900 ml of water.

Final answer: **60 grams of charcoal**.
