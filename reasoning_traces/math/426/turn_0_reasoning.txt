==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of students in both the Elementary School and the Middle School, given the relationship between the two.

Let's define the variables:
- Let \( M \) represent the number of students in the Middle School.
- Let \( E \) represent the number of students in the Elementary School.

According to the problem, the number of students in the Middle School is given as:
\[ M = 50 \]

The problem states that the number of students in the Elementary School is three less than four times the number of students in the Middle School. We can express this relationship with the following equation:
\[ E = 4M - 3 \]

Now, substitute the value of \( M \) into the equation for \( E \):
\[ E = 4(50) - 3 \]

Calculate the expression:
\[ E = 200 - 3 \]
\[ E = 197 \]

Now that we have both \( M \) and \( E \), we can find the total number of students in both the Elementary School and the Middle School by adding these two values together:
\[ \text{Total number of students} = M + E \]
\[ \text{Total number of students} = 50 + 197 \]
\[ \text{Total number of students} = 247 \]

Therefore, the total number of students in both the Elementary School and the Middle School is \( \boxed{247} \).
