==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of students in Elementary School based on the information given about the number of students in Middle School.

1. **Identify the number of students in Middle School**: 
   We are told that the number of students in Middle School is 50.

2. **Set up the equation for the number of students in Elementary School**:
   The problem states that there is "three less than four times the number of students in Elementary School as there are in Middle School." We can express this mathematically. Let \( E \) represent the number of students in Elementary School. According to the problem, we can write the relationship as:
   \[
   E = 4 \times \text{(number of Middle School students)} - 3
   \]
   Substituting the number of Middle School students:
   \[
   E = 4 \times 50 - 3
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of students in Elementary School**:
   Now, we perform the multiplication:
   \[
   E = 200 - 3
   \]
   Simplifying this gives:
   \[
   E = 197
   \]

4. **Calculate the total number of students in both levels**:
   Now that we have the number of students in both schools, we can find the total number of students by adding the number of students in Middle School and Elementary School:
   \[
   \text{Total students} = E + \text{(number of Middle School students)}
   \]
   Substituting the values we found:
   \[
   \text{Total students} = 197 + 50
   \]
   Performing the addition:
   \[
   \text{Total students} = 247
   \]

5. **Final answer**:
   Therefore, the total number of students in both Elementary School and Middle School is:
   \[
   \boxed{247}
   \]
