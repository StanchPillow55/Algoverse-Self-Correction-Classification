==================================================

To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step, calculating the total number of brownies Greta had at different points in the day and how many were eaten during the party.

1. **Brownies Greta made for herself:**
   Greta made 1 dozen cream cheese swirl brownies.
   \[
   1 \text{ dozen} = 12 \text{ brownies}
   \]

2. **Brownies she received from her office:**
   At her office party, she received 1/2 dozen brownies.
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} \text{ dozen} = 6 \text{ brownies}
   \]

3. **Brownies her friends brought to the surprise party:**
   Her friends had 4 dozen brownies waiting for her.
   \[
   4 \text{ dozen} = 4 \times 12 = 48 \text{ brownies}
   \]

4. **Total brownies before the party:**
   Now, we will add up all the brownies Greta had before the party:
   \[
   \text{Total brownies} = \text{Brownies made} + \text{Brownies from office} + \text{Brownies from friends}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total brownies} = 12 + 6 + 48 = 66 \text{ brownies}
   \]

5. **Brownies eaten during the party:**
   During the party, 1 1/2 dozen brownies were eaten.
   \[
   1 \frac{1}{2} \text{ dozen} = \frac{3}{2} \text{ dozen} = \frac{3}{2} \times 12 = 18 \text{ brownies}
   \]

6. **Total brownies left after the party:**
   To find out how many brownies Greta had left after the party, we subtract the number of brownies eaten from the total number of brownies she had:
   \[
   \text{Brownies left} = \text{Total brownies} - \text{Brownies eaten}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Brownies left} = 66 - 18 = 48 \text{ brownies}
   \]

Thus, the final answer is that Greta had **48 individual brownies left over from the entire day**.
