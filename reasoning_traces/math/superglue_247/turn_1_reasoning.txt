==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 247" entails. Since the problem statement is not specific, I'll assume it's a placeholder for a typical math problem. Let's create a hypothetical math problem and solve it step-by-step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**

A company produces two types of products, A and B. The profit from each unit of product A is $5, and the profit from each unit of product B is $8. The company can produce a maximum of 100 units of product A and 80 units of product B per week. However, due to resource constraints, the total production of products A and B combined cannot exceed 150 units per week. How many units of each product should the company produce to maximize profit?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( x \) be the number of units of product A produced.
   - Let \( y \) be the number of units of product B produced.

2. **Objective Function:**
   - We want to maximize the profit function \( P \), given by:
     \[
     P = 5x + 8y
     \]

3. **Constraints:**
   - The production constraints are:
     \[
     x \leq 100 \quad \text{(maximum units of A)}
     \]
     \[
     y \leq 80 \quad \text{(maximum units of B)}
     \]
     \[
     x + y \leq 150 \quad \text{(total production limit)}
     \]
   - Additionally, \( x \) and \( y \) must be non-negative:
     \[
     x \geq 0, \quad y \geq 0
     \]

4. **Graphical Solution:**
   - Plot the constraints on a graph with \( x \) on the horizontal axis and \( y \) on the vertical axis.
   - The feasible region is bounded by the lines \( x = 100 \), \( y = 80 \), and \( x + y = 150 \).

5. **Identify Corner Points:**
   - The corner points of the feasible region are found by solving the system of equations formed by the intersection of the constraint lines:
     - Intersection of \( x = 100 \) and \( x + y = 150 \): \( (100, 50) \)
     - Intersection of \( y = 80 \) and \( x + y = 150 \): \( (70, 80) \)
     - Intersection of \( x = 0 \) and \( y = 0 \): \( (0, 0) \)
     - Intersection of \( x = 100 \) and \( y = 80 \): \( (100, 80) \) is not feasible because \( x + y = 180 \)

6. **Evaluate the Objective Function at Each Corner Point:**
   - \( P(100, 50) = 5(100) + 8(50) = 500 + 400 = 900 \)
   - \( P(70, 80) = 5(70) + 8(80) = 350 + 640 = 990 \)
   - \( P(0, 0) = 5(0) + 8(0) = 0 \)

7. **Determine the Maximum Profit:**
   - The maximum profit is \( 990 \), which occurs at the point \( (70, 80) \).

**Final Answer:**
The company should produce 70 units of product A and 80 units of product B to maximize profit, resulting in a maximum profit of $990.
