To find the total number of pieces of fruit in the crates and boxes, we need to calculate the number of oranges in the crates and the number of nectarines in the boxes separately, and then sum these two amounts.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of oranges in the crates.**

We know that:
- There are 12 crates.
- Each crate contains 150 oranges.

To find the total number of oranges, we multiply the number of crates by the number of oranges per crate:

\[
\text{Total oranges} = \text{Number of crates} \times \text{Oranges per crate}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\text{Total oranges} = 12 \times 150
\]

Now, we perform the multiplication:

\[
12 \times 150 = 1800
\]

So, there are 1800 oranges in total.

**Step 2: Calculate the total number of nectarines in the boxes.**

We know that:
- There are 16 boxes.
- Each box holds 30 nectarines.

To find the total number of nectarines, we multiply the number of boxes by the number of nectarines per box:

\[
\text{Total nectarines} = \text{Number of boxes} \times \text{Nectarines per box}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\text{Total nectarines} = 16 \times 30
\]

Now, we perform the multiplication:

\[
16 \times 30 = 480
\]

So, there are 480 nectarines in total.

**Step 3: Calculate the total number of pieces of fruit.**

Now we add the total number of oranges and the total number of nectarines together:

\[
\text{Total fruit} = \text{Total oranges} + \text{Total nectarines}
\]

Substituting the values we calculated:

\[
\text{Total fruit} = 1800 + 480
\]

Now, we perform the addition:

\[
1800 + 480 = 2280
\]

**Final Answer:**

The total number of pieces of fruit in the crates and boxes is \( \boxed{2280} \).
