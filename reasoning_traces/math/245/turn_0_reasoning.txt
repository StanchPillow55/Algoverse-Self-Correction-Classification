To solve the problem of finding the total number of pieces of fruit in the crates and boxes, we need to calculate the total number of oranges and nectarines separately and then add them together.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of oranges.**

We are given that there are 12 crates, and each crate contains 150 oranges. To find the total number of oranges, we multiply the number of crates by the number of oranges per crate:

\[
\text{Total number of oranges} = 12 \text{ crates} \times 150 \text{ oranges per crate}
\]

\[
= 12 \times 150
\]

To perform this multiplication, we can break it down:

\[
12 \times 150 = 12 \times (100 + 50) = 12 \times 100 + 12 \times 50
\]

Calculating each part:

\[
12 \times 100 = 1200
\]

\[
12 \times 50 = 600
\]

Adding these results together gives:

\[
1200 + 600 = 1800
\]

So, there are 1800 oranges in total.

**Step 2: Calculate the total number of nectarines.**

We are given that there are 16 boxes, and each box holds 30 nectarines. To find the total number of nectarines, we multiply the number of boxes by the number of nectarines per box:

\[
\text{Total number of nectarines} = 16 \text{ boxes} \times 30 \text{ nectarines per box}
\]

\[
= 16 \times 30
\]

To perform this multiplication, we can break it down:

\[
16 \times 30 = 16 \times (10 + 20) = 16 \times 10 + 16 \times 20
\]

Calculating each part:

\[
16 \times 10 = 160
\]

\[
16 \times 20 = 320
\]

Adding these results together gives:

\[
160 + 320 = 480
\]

So, there are 480 nectarines in total.

**Step 3: Calculate the total number of pieces of fruit.**

Now, we add the total number of oranges and nectarines to find the total number of pieces of fruit:

\[
\text{Total number of pieces of fruit} = 1800 \text{ oranges} + 480 \text{ nectarines}
\]

\[
= 1800 + 480
\]

Adding these numbers gives:

\[
1800 + 480 = 2280
\]

Therefore, the total number of pieces of fruit in the crates and boxes is \(\boxed{2280}\).
