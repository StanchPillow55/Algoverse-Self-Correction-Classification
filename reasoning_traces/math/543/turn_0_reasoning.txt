To determine how much more Jairus will earn than Jenny after completing 20 tasks each, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate Jairus's earnings**:
   - Jairus earns $0.8 for each task he completes.
   - He completed 20 tasks.
   - Therefore, his total earnings can be calculated as follows:
     \[
     \text{Jairus's earnings} = \text{Number of tasks} \times \text{Earnings per task}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Jairus's earnings} = 20 \times 0.8
     \]
     \[
     \text{Jairus's earnings} = 16.0
     \]

2. **Calculate Jenny's earnings**:
   - Jenny earns $0.5 for each task she completes.
   - She also completed 20 tasks.
   - Therefore, her total earnings can be calculated as follows:
     \[
     \text{Jenny's earnings} = \text{Number of tasks} \times \text{Earnings per task}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Jenny's earnings} = 20 \times 0.5
     \]
     \[
     \text{Jenny's earnings} = 10.0
     \]

3. **Calculate the difference in earnings**:
   - To find out how much more Jairus earned than Jenny, we subtract Jenny's earnings from Jairus's earnings:
     \[
     \text{Difference} = \text{Jairus's earnings} - \text{Jenny's earnings}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Difference} = 16.0 - 10.0
     \]
     \[
     \text{Difference} = 6.0
     \]

Thus, Jairus will earn $6.00 more than Jenny after completing 20 tasks each.

**Final Answer**: Jairus will get $6.00 more than Jenny.
