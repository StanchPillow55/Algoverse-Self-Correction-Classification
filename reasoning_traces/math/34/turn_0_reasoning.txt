==================================================

To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step.

1. **Identify the number of jewels Raymond has:**
   - According to the problem, Raymond has 40 jewels.

2. **Calculate the number of jewels Aaron has:**
   - The problem states that Aaron has 5 more jewels than half of Raymond's jewels.
   - First, we need to find half of Raymond's jewels:
     \[
     \text{Half of Raymond's jewels} = \frac{40}{2} = 20
     \]
   - Now, we add 5 to this amount to find out how many jewels Aaron has:
     \[
     \text{Aaron's jewels} = 20 + 5 = 25
     \]

3. **Calculate the number of jewels Siobhan has:**
   - The problem states that Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron.
   - Since we found that Aaron has 25 jewels, we subtract 2 from this amount:
     \[
     \text{Siobhan's jewels} = 25 - 2 = 23
     \]

4. **Final answer:**
   - Siobhan has 23 jewels.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{23}
\]
