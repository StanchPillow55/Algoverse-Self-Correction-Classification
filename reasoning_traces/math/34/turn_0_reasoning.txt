To solve the problem, we need to determine the total amount of money shared between Mr. Sam's two sons, Ken and Tony.

1. **Identify the amount Ken received**: 
   - According to the problem, Ken received $1750.

2. **Determine the amount Tony received**: 
   - The problem states that Tony received twice as much as Ken. Therefore, we can calculate Tony's amount as follows:
   \[
   \text{Tony's amount} = 2 \times \text{Ken's amount} = 2 \times 1750
   \]
   Now, we perform the multiplication:
   \[
   2 \times 1750 = 3500
   \]
   So, Tony received $3500.

3. **Calculate the total amount of money shared**: 
   - To find the total amount of money shared between Ken and Tony, we add the amounts they received:
   \[
   \text{Total amount} = \text{Ken's amount} + \text{Tony's amount} = 1750 + 3500
   \]
   Now, we perform the addition:
   \[
   1750 + 3500 = 5250
   \]

4. **Final answer**: 
   - Therefore, the total amount of money shared between Ken and Tony is:
   \[
   \boxed{5250}
   \]
