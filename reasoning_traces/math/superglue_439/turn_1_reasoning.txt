==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample reasoning question 439," we need to first understand what the question is asking. However, the problem statement is incomplete or unclear as it stands. Without specific details or context, it's challenging to provide a precise solution. 

Let's assume this is a placeholder for a typical math problem. To demonstrate a structured approach to problem-solving, I'll outline a generic process that can be applied to a variety of math problems:

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - Identify what is being asked.
   - Determine what information is given.
   - Clarify any terms or concepts that are not immediately clear.

2. **Devise a Plan:**
   - Consider possible strategies to solve the problem. This might include drawing a diagram, creating an equation, or breaking the problem into smaller parts.
   - Choose the most appropriate method based on the type of problem.

3. **Carry Out the Plan:**
   - Execute the chosen strategy step by step.
   - Perform calculations carefully, showing all work.
   - Keep track of units and ensure consistency throughout the process.

4. **Review/Check the Solution:**
   - Verify that the solution answers the question posed.
   - Check calculations for accuracy.
   - Consider whether the answer is reasonable given the context of the problem.

Since the problem statement is not specific, let's create a hypothetical math problem to illustrate this process:

**Hypothetical Problem:**
"Find the value of \( x \) if \( 2x + 3 = 11 \)."

**Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We need to solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).

2. **Devise a Plan:**
   - We can isolate \( x \) by performing algebraic operations to simplify the equation.

3. **Carry Out the Plan:**
   - Start with the equation: \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).
   - Subtract 3 from both sides to isolate the term with \( x \):
     \[
     2x + 3 - 3 = 11 - 3
     \]
     \[
     2x = 8
     \]
   - Divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( x \):
     \[
     \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{8}{2}
     \]
     \[
     x = 4
     \]

4. **Review/Check the Solution:**
   - Substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation to verify:
     \[
     2(4) + 3 = 8 + 3 = 11
     \]
   - The left side equals the right side, confirming our solution is correct.

**Final Answer:**
The value of \( x \) is 4.
