Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem effectively, we need to first understand the context and details of the question. However, the question provided, "Sample reasoning question 439," does not contain any specific mathematical problem or details to work through. It seems like a placeholder or reference to a specific problem that is not included in the text.

To proceed, I'll outline a general approach to solving a typical math problem, which involves understanding the problem, devising a plan, carrying out the plan, and then reviewing the solution.

### General Approach to Solving Math Problems:

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - Read the problem carefully.
   - Identify what is being asked.
   - Determine what information is given and what needs to be found.

2. **Devise a Plan:**
   - Consider possible strategies to solve the problem, such as drawing a diagram, creating an equation, or breaking the problem into smaller parts.
   - Choose the most appropriate strategy based on the problem type.

3. **Carry Out the Plan:**
   - Execute the chosen strategy step by step.
   - Perform calculations carefully and check each step for accuracy.
   - Keep track of units and ensure consistency throughout the solution.

4. **Review/Check the Solution:**
   - Verify that the solution answers the question posed.
   - Check calculations for errors.
   - Consider whether the answer is reasonable and makes sense in the context of the problem.

### Example Problem and Solution:

Since the original question lacks details, let's consider a simple example problem:

**Example Problem:**
Solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).

**Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We need to find the value of \( x \) that satisfies the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).

2. **Devise a Plan:**
   - We can solve for \( x \) by isolating it on one side of the equation.

3. **Carry Out the Plan:**
   - Start with the equation: \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).
   - Subtract 3 from both sides to isolate the term with \( x \):
     \[
     2x + 3 - 3 = 11 - 3
     \]
     \[
     2x = 8
     \]
   - Divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( x \):
     \[
     \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{8}{2}
     \]
     \[
     x = 4
     \]

4. **Review/Check the Solution:**
   - Substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation to verify:
     \[
     2(4) + 3 = 8 + 3 = 11
     \]
   - The left side equals the right side, confirming that \( x = 4 \) is correct.

**Final Answer:**
\( x = 4 \)
