Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem effectively, let's first understand what "Sample reasoning question 439" might entail. Since the problem statement is not specific, I'll assume it's a hypothetical math problem. Let's create a sample problem and solve it step by step.

**Sample Problem 439:**

A company produces two types of widgets: Type A and Type B. The company can produce a maximum of 100 widgets per day. Each Type A widget requires 2 hours of labor, and each Type B widget requires 3 hours of labor. The company has a maximum of 240 labor hours available per day. If the profit from each Type A widget is $50 and from each Type B widget is $70, how many of each type of widget should the company produce to maximize profit?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( x \) be the number of Type A widgets produced.
   - Let \( y \) be the number of Type B widgets produced.

2. **Set Up Constraints:**
   - The total number of widgets produced cannot exceed 100:
     \[
     x + y \leq 100
     \]
   - The total labor hours cannot exceed 240:
     \[
     2x + 3y \leq 240
     \]
   - Non-negativity constraints:
     \[
     x \geq 0, \quad y \geq 0
     \]

3. **Objective Function:**
   - The profit function to maximize is:
     \[
     P = 50x + 70y
     \]

4. **Graphical Solution Method:**
   - Plot the constraints on a graph to find the feasible region.
   - The line \( x + y = 100 \) intersects the axes at \( (100, 0) \) and \( (0, 100) \).
   - The line \( 2x + 3y = 240 \) intersects the axes at \( (120, 0) \) and \( (0, 80) \).

5. **Find Intersection Points:**
   - Solve the system of equations to find the intersection of \( x + y = 100 \) and \( 2x + 3y = 240 \):
     \[
     x + y = 100 \quad \text{(1)}
     \]
     \[
     2x + 3y = 240 \quad \text{(2)}
     \]
   - Multiply equation (1) by 2:
     \[
     2x + 2y = 200
     \]
   - Subtract from equation (2):
     \[
     (2x + 3y) - (2x + 2y) = 240 - 200
     \]
     \[
     y = 40
     \]
   - Substitute \( y = 40 \) back into equation (1):
     \[
     x + 40 = 100
     \]
     \[
     x = 60
     \]
   - Intersection point is \( (60, 40) \).

6. **Evaluate Objective Function at Vertices:**
   - Calculate profit at each vertex of the feasible region:
     - \( (0, 0) \): \( P = 50(0) + 70(0) = 0 \)
     - \( (100, 0) \): \( P = 50(100) + 70(0) = 5000 \)
     - \( (60, 40) \): \( P = 50(60) + 70(40) = 3000 + 2800 = 5800 \)
     - \( (0, 80) \): \( P = 50(0) + 70(80) = 5600 \)

7. **Conclusion:**
   - The maximum profit of $5800 occurs when the company produces 60 Type A widgets and 40 Type B widgets.

**Final Answer:**
The company should produce 60 Type A widgets and 40 Type B widgets to maximize profit, resulting in a maximum profit of $5800.
