==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 439" refers to. Since the question is not explicitly stated, I'll assume it involves a typical math problem-solving scenario. Let's create a hypothetical math problem and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**

"Calculate the area of a triangle with a base of 10 units and a height of 5 units."

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Formula:**
   The area \( A \) of a triangle can be calculated using the formula:
   \[
   A = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height}
   \]

2. **Identify the Given Values:**
   - Base (\( b \)) = 10 units
   - Height (\( h \)) = 5 units

3. **Substitute the Values into the Formula:**
   \[
   A = \frac{1}{2} \times 10 \times 5
   \]

4. **Perform the Multiplication:**
   First, multiply the base and the height:
   \[
   10 \times 5 = 50
   \]

5. **Calculate the Area:**
   Now, multiply the result by \(\frac{1}{2}\):
   \[
   A = \frac{1}{2} \times 50 = 25
   \]

6. **State the Final Answer:**
   The area of the triangle is 25 square units.

By following these steps, we have calculated the area of the triangle using the given dimensions. The key was to apply the correct formula and perform the arithmetic operations accurately.

**Final Answer:**
The area of the triangle is 25 square units.
