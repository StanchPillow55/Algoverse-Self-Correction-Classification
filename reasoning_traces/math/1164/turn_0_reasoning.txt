To solve the problem, we will first determine how many eggs were hidden, then calculate how many eggs each person found, and finally, we will find out how many eggs are still hidden.

1. **Calculate the total number of eggs hidden:**
   Cole hid 3 dozen eggs. Since 1 dozen equals 12, we calculate:
   \[
   3 \text{ dozen} = 3 \times 12 = 36 \text{ eggs}
   \]

2. **Determine how many eggs each person found:**
   - **Lamar finds 5 eggs.**
   - **Stacy finds twice as many as Lamar:**
     \[
     \text{Stacy's eggs} = 2 \times \text{Lamar's eggs} = 2 \times 5 = 10 \text{ eggs}
     \]
   - **Charlie finds 2 less than Stacy:**
     \[
     \text{Charlie's eggs} = \text{Stacy's eggs} - 2 = 10 - 2 = 8 \text{ eggs}
     \]
   - **Mei finds half as many as Charlie:**
     \[
     \text{Mei's eggs} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Charlie's eggs} = \frac{1}{2} \times 8 = 4 \text{ eggs}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total number of eggs found:**
   Now we add up the eggs found by each person:
   \[
   \text{Total eggs found} = \text{Lamar's eggs} + \text{Stacy's eggs} + \text{Charlie's eggs} + \text{Mei's eggs}
   \]
   Substituting the values we found:
   \[
   \text{Total eggs found} = 5 + 10 + 8 + 4 = 27 \text{ eggs}
   \]

4. **Determine how many eggs are still hidden:**
   To find the number of eggs still hidden, we subtract the total number of eggs found from the total number of eggs hidden:
   \[
   \text{Eggs still hidden} = \text{Total eggs hidden} - \text{Total eggs found}
   \]
   Substituting the values:
   \[
   \text{Eggs still hidden} = 36 - 27 = 9 \text{ eggs}
   \]

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{9}
\]
