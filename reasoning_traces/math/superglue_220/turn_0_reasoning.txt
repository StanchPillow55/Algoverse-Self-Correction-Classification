To solve the problem "Sample reasoning question 220," we need to first understand what the problem is asking. However, the problem statement provided is incomplete and lacks specific details or context. Therefore, I will create a hypothetical math problem related to the number 220 and solve it step-by-step.

Let's assume the problem is as follows:

**Problem:**
Determine if the number 220 is a perfect number. A perfect number is a positive integer that is equal to the sum of its proper divisors (excluding itself).

**Solution:**

1. **Identify the Divisors of 220:**
   A divisor of a number is an integer that divides the number without leaving a remainder. We need to find all divisors of 220.

   - Start with 1 (since 1 is a divisor of every integer).
   - Check divisibility by 2: 220 is even, so 2 is a divisor.
   - Check divisibility by 3: The sum of the digits of 220 is 2 + 2 + 0 = 4, which is not divisible by 3, so 3 is not a divisor.
   - Check divisibility by 4: 220 divided by 4 is 55, so 4 is a divisor.
   - Check divisibility by 5: The last digit of 220 is 0, so 5 is a divisor.
   - Check divisibility by 6: Since 220 is divisible by both 2 and 3, it is not divisible by 6.
   - Check divisibility by 10: The last digit is 0, so 10 is a divisor.
   - Continue checking up to the square root of 220 (approximately 14.8), checking for divisibility by each integer.

   The divisors of 220 are: 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 11, 20, 22, 44, 55, 110, 220.

2. **Identify the Proper Divisors:**
   Proper divisors are all divisors excluding the number itself. For 220, the proper divisors are: 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 11, 20, 22, 44, 55, 110.

3. **Calculate the Sum of Proper Divisors:**
   Sum = 1 + 2 + 4 + 5 + 10 + 11 + 20 + 22 + 44 + 55 + 110 = 284.

4. **Determine if 220 is a Perfect Number:**
   A perfect number is one where the sum of its proper divisors equals the number itself. Here, the sum of the proper divisors of 220 is 284, which is not equal to 220.

Therefore, 220 is not a perfect number.

**Final Answer:**
220 is not a perfect number because the sum of its proper divisors (284) does not equal 220.
