==================================================

To solve the problem effectively, let's first clarify the question. However, it seems like the question is not fully provided. The text "Sample reasoning question 220" does not contain enough information to identify a specific math problem or context. 

To proceed, let's assume a hypothetical math problem that could be labeled as "Sample reasoning question 220." I'll create a problem and solve it step by step.

### Hypothetical Problem:
**Question 220:** If a car travels at a constant speed of 60 miles per hour, how long will it take to travel 180 miles?

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Identify the Known Values:**
   - Speed of the car = 60 miles per hour
   - Distance to be traveled = 180 miles

2. **Identify the Unknown:**
   - Time taken to travel 180 miles

3. **Relevant Formula:**
   The formula to calculate time when distance and speed are known is:
   \[
   \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}}
   \]

4. **Substitute the Known Values into the Formula:**
   \[
   \text{Time} = \frac{180 \text{ miles}}{60 \text{ miles per hour}}
   \]

5. **Perform the Calculation:**
   \[
   \text{Time} = \frac{180}{60} = 3 \text{ hours}
   \]

6. **Interpret the Result:**
   The car will take 3 hours to travel 180 miles at a constant speed of 60 miles per hour.

### Final Answer:
The time it will take for the car to travel 180 miles is 3 hours.
