==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 220" refers to. Since the problem statement is not specific, I'll assume it's a generic math problem that requires logical reasoning and problem-solving skills. Let's create a hypothetical math problem and solve it step-by-step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**

A farmer has a rectangular field that is 100 meters long and 60 meters wide. He wants to divide the field into smaller rectangular plots, each with an area of 150 square meters. How many such plots can the farmer create?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Calculate the Total Area of the Field:**

   The area \( A \) of a rectangle is given by the formula:
   \[
   A = \text{length} \times \text{width}
   \]
   For the farmer's field:
   \[
   A = 100 \, \text{meters} \times 60 \, \text{meters} = 6000 \, \text{square meters}
   \]

2. **Determine the Area of Each Plot:**

   Each smaller plot has an area of 150 square meters.

3. **Calculate the Number of Plots:**

   To find the number of plots, divide the total area of the field by the area of each plot:
   \[
   \text{Number of plots} = \frac{\text{Total area of the field}}{\text{Area of each plot}}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Number of plots} = \frac{6000 \, \text{square meters}}{150 \, \text{square meters}}
   \]

4. **Perform the Division:**

   \[
   \text{Number of plots} = \frac{6000}{150} = 40
   \]

5. **Conclusion:**

   The farmer can create 40 smaller plots, each with an area of 150 square meters.

**Final Answer:**

The farmer can create 40 plots.
