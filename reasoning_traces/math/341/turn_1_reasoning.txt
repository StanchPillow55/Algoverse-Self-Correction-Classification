==================================================

Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Weight of the Pink Frog**: 
   - The problem states that the pink frog weighs 50 pounds.

2. **Weight of the Blue Beetle**: 
   - The blue beetle weighs the same as the pink frog, so it also weighs 50 pounds.

3. **Weight of the Green Toad**: 
   - The green toad also weighs the same as the pink frog, so it weighs 50 pounds.

4. **Weight of the Yellow Snake**: 
   - The pink frog weighs 10 pounds less than the yellow snake. Therefore, if the pink frog weighs 50 pounds, the yellow snake weighs:
     \[
     \text{Weight of Yellow Snake} = \text{Weight of Pink Frog} + 10 = 50 + 10 = 60 \text{ pounds}
     \]

5. **Weight of the Red Bird**: 
   - The pink frog weighs 20 pounds more than the red bird. Therefore, if the pink frog weighs 50 pounds, the red bird weighs:
     \[
     \text{Weight of Red Bird} = \text{Weight of Pink Frog} - 20 = 50 - 20 = 30 \text{ pounds}
     \]

6. **Total Weight of the Animals**: 
   - Now we can calculate the total weight of all the animals:
     \[
     \text{Total Weight of Animals} = \text{Weight of Pink Frog} + \text{Weight of Blue Beetle} + \text{Weight of Green Toad} + \text{Weight of Yellow Snake} + \text{Weight of Red Bird}
     \]
     \[
     = 50 + 50 + 50 + 60 + 30 = 240 \text{ pounds}
     \]

7. **Weight of the Container**: 
   - The container weighs 20 pounds.

8. **Total Weight of the Container and Animals**: 
   - Finally, we add the weight of the container to the total weight of the animals:
     \[
     \text{Total Weight} = \text{Total Weight of Animals} + \text{Weight of Container} = 240 + 20 = 260 \text{ pounds}
     \]

Thus, the total weight of the container carrying one of each animal is **260 pounds**. 

**Final Answer**: 260 pounds.
