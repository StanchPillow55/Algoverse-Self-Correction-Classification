==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to determine how many dust particles were on the porch before Samuel swept it. We know the following:

1. Samuel cleared nine-tenths of the dust particles from the porch.
2. After sweeping, there were 331 dust particles remaining on the porch.
3. After Samuel walked across the porch, he left 223 dust particles behind.

Let's denote the initial number of dust particles on the porch before Samuel swept it as \( x \).

### Step 1: Determine the number of dust particles left after sweeping

Since Samuel cleared nine-tenths of the dust particles, this means he left one-tenth of the dust particles on the porch after sweeping. Therefore, the number of dust particles left after sweeping can be expressed as:

\[
\text{Dust particles left after sweeping} = \frac{1}{10}x
\]

### Step 2: Set up the equation for dust particles after walking across

After Samuel walked across the porch, he left 223 dust particles behind. Thus, the total number of dust particles remaining on the porch after he walked across it is:

\[
\text{Dust particles after walking} = \text{Dust particles left after sweeping} + \text{Dust particles left behind}
\]

Substituting the known values, we have:

\[
331 = \frac{1}{10}x + 223
\]

### Step 3: Solve for \( x \)

Now, we can solve for \( x \):

1. Subtract 223 from both sides:

\[
331 - 223 = \frac{1}{10}x
\]

\[
108 = \frac{1}{10}x
\]

2. Multiply both sides by 10 to isolate \( x \):

\[
x = 108 \times 10
\]

\[
x = 1080
\]

### Conclusion

The initial number of dust particles on the porch before Samuel swept it was \( \boxed{1080} \).
