Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Identify the weight of the pink frog**: 
   We are given that the pink frog weighs 50 pounds.

2. **Determine the weight of the blue beetle**: 
   The problem states that the pink frog weighs the same as the blue beetle. Therefore, the weight of the blue beetle is also 50 pounds.

3. **Determine the weight of the green toad**: 
   Similarly, the pink frog weighs the same as the green toad. Thus, the weight of the green toad is also 50 pounds.

4. **Determine the weight of the yellow snake**: 
   The pink frog weighs 10 pounds less than the yellow snake. Since the pink frog weighs 50 pounds, we can set up the equation:
   \[
   \text{Weight of yellow snake} = \text{Weight of pink frog} + 10
   \]
   \[
   \text{Weight of yellow snake} = 50 + 10 = 60 \text{ pounds}
   \]

5. **Determine the weight of the red bird**: 
   The pink frog weighs 20 pounds more than the red bird. We can set up the equation:
   \[
   \text{Weight of red bird} = \text{Weight of pink frog} - 20
   \]
   \[
   \text{Weight of red bird} = 50 - 20 = 30 \text{ pounds}
   \]

6. **Calculate the total weight of the animals**: 
   Now we can sum the weights of all the animals:
   - Weight of pink frog: 50 pounds
   - Weight of blue beetle: 50 pounds
   - Weight of green toad: 50 pounds
   - Weight of yellow snake: 60 pounds
   - Weight of red bird: 30 pounds

   Total weight of the animals:
   \[
   \text{Total weight} = 50 + 50 + 50 + 60 + 30
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total weight} = 240 \text{ pounds}
   \]

7. **Add the weight of the container**: 
   The container weighs 20 pounds. Therefore, the total weight of the container carrying one of each animal is:
   \[
   \text{Total weight with container} = \text{Total weight of animals} + \text{Weight of container}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total weight with container} = 240 + 20 = 260 \text{ pounds}
   \]

Finally, the total weight of the container carrying one of each animal is **260 pounds**.
