To solve the problem, we need to determine how many dust particles were on the porch before Samuel swept it. We know the following:

1. Samuel cleared nine-tenths of the dust particles from the porch.
2. After sweeping, there were 331 dust particles remaining on the porch.
3. After Samuel walked across the porch, his shoes left 223 dust particles behind.

Let's denote the initial number of dust particles on the porch before Samuel swept it as \( x \).

### Step 1: Determine the number of dust particles left after sweeping

Since Samuel cleared nine-tenths of the dust particles, he left one-tenth of the dust particles on the porch. Therefore, the number of dust particles remaining after he swept can be expressed as:

\[
\text{Dust particles remaining after sweeping} = \frac{1}{10}x
\]

### Step 2: Set up the equation based on the remaining dust particles

According to the problem, after Samuel swept the porch, there were 331 dust particles left. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

\[
\frac{1}{10}x = 331
\]

### Step 3: Solve for \( x \)

To find \( x \), we can multiply both sides of the equation by 10:

\[
x = 331 \times 10
\]

Calculating this gives:

\[
x = 3310
\]

### Step 4: Verify the solution

Now, let's verify if this value makes sense with the information given in the problem. If there were initially 3310 dust particles:

- After sweeping, Samuel cleared nine-tenths of them, which means he left one-tenth:

\[
\frac{1}{10} \times 3310 = 331
\]

This matches the number of dust particles remaining after he swept.

### Step 5: Consider the dust particles left after walking

After Samuel walked across the porch, he left 223 dust particles behind. So, we need to check how many dust particles were there after he walked across:

\[
\text{Dust particles after walking} = \text{Dust particles remaining after sweeping} + \text{Dust particles left behind}
\]

Calculating this gives:

\[
331 + 223 = 554
\]

This is not directly relevant to finding the initial number of dust particles, but it confirms the process.

### Final Answer

Thus, the total number of dust particles on the porch before Samuel swept it is:

\[
\boxed{3310}
\]
