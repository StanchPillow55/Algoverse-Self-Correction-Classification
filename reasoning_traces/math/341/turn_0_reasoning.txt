To solve this problem, we need to determine the initial number of dust particles on the porch before Samuel swept it. Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - Samuel swept the porch and removed nine-tenths (or 90%) of the dust particles.
   - After sweeping, he walked across the porch and left 223 dust particles behind.
   - After he walked across, there were a total of 331 dust particles on the porch.

2. **Set Up the Equation:**
   - Let \( x \) be the initial number of dust particles on the porch before Samuel swept it.
   - After sweeping, Samuel removed nine-tenths of the dust particles, so one-tenth of the dust particles remained.
   - Therefore, the number of dust particles remaining after sweeping is \( \frac{1}{10}x \).

3. **Account for the Dust Left by Samuel's Shoes:**
   - Samuel's shoes added 223 dust particles to the porch.
   - Therefore, the total number of dust particles after he walked across the porch is the sum of the remaining dust particles after sweeping and the dust particles added by his shoes.
   - This can be expressed as:
     \[
     \frac{1}{10}x + 223 = 331
     \]

4. **Solve the Equation:**
   - First, isolate the term with \( x \) by subtracting 223 from both sides:
     \[
     \frac{1}{10}x = 331 - 223
     \]
   - Simplify the right side:
     \[
     \frac{1}{10}x = 108
     \]
   - To solve for \( x \), multiply both sides by 10:
     \[
     x = 108 \times 10
     \]
   - Calculate the result:
     \[
     x = 1080
     \]

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The initial number of dust particles on the porch before Samuel swept it was 1080.

Therefore, the final answer is that there were 1080 dust particles on the porch before Samuel swept it.
