==================================================

To solve the problem, we first need to understand what "Sample math problem 352" refers to. Since the problem itself is not provided, I'll assume this is a placeholder for a specific math problem. Without the actual problem, I can't provide a specific solution. However, I can guide you through a general approach to solving math problems.

### General Approach to Solving Math Problems:

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - Read the problem carefully.
   - Identify what is being asked.
   - Determine what information is given and what needs to be found.

2. **Devise a Plan:**
   - Think about the mathematical concepts that apply to the problem.
   - Consider similar problems you have solved before.
   - Decide on a strategy to solve the problem (e.g., algebraic manipulation, drawing a diagram, breaking the problem into smaller parts).

3. **Carry Out the Plan:**
   - Execute your strategy step by step.
   - Perform calculations carefully.
   - Keep track of your work to avoid mistakes.

4. **Review/Check Your Work:**
   - Verify each step of your solution.
   - Check if your final answer makes sense in the context of the problem.
   - Recalculate if necessary to ensure accuracy.

5. **State the Final Answer:**
   - Clearly write down your final answer.
   - Include units if applicable.

### Example Problem:

Since I don't have the specific "Sample math problem 352," I'll create a simple example problem to demonstrate the process:

**Example Problem:**
Solve for \( x \) in the equation: \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).

**Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We need to find the value of \( x \) that satisfies the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).

2. **Devise a Plan:**
   - We can solve this linear equation by isolating \( x \).

3. **Carry Out the Plan:**
   - Start with the equation: \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).
   - Subtract 3 from both sides to isolate the term with \( x \):
     \[
     2x + 3 - 3 = 11 - 3
     \]
     \[
     2x = 8
     \]
   - Divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( x \):
     \[
     \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{8}{2}
     \]
     \[
     x = 4
     \]

4. **Review/Check Your Work:**
   - Substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation to verify:
     \[
     2(4) + 3 = 8 + 3 = 11
     \]
   - The left side equals the right side, so our solution is correct.

5. **State the Final Answer:**
   - The solution to the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \) is \( x = 4 \).

If you have a specific math problem in mind, please provide the details so I can assist you further.
