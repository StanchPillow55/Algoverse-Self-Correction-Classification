==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 352," we first need to understand what the problem is asking. However, the problem statement "Sample math problem 352" is not specific, and it doesn't provide any details or context about what needs to be solved. Therefore, I will assume that "352" is a number related to a math problem, and I will create a problem involving this number for demonstration purposes.

Let's assume the problem is as follows:

**Problem:**  
Find the sum of the digits of the number 352.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Identify the digits of the number 352.**

   The number 352 consists of three digits: 3, 5, and 2.

2. **Add the digits together.**

   To find the sum of the digits, we add them together:
   \[
   3 + 5 + 2
   \]

3. **Perform the addition.**

   First, add the first two digits:
   \[
   3 + 5 = 8
   \]

   Then, add the result to the third digit:
   \[
   8 + 2 = 10
   \]
