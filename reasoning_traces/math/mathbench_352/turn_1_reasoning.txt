Question ID: mathbench_352
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 352," we need to first understand what the problem is asking. However, the problem statement "Sample math problem 352" is not specific enough for us to determine the exact mathematical question or context. Therefore, I will assume that "352" is a number related to a typical math problem, and I will create a problem involving this number for demonstration purposes.

Let's assume the problem is as follows:

**Problem:**
Find the sum of the digits of the number 352, and then determine if this sum is a prime number.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Identify the digits of the number 352:**
   - The number 352 consists of the digits 3, 5, and 2.

2. **Calculate the sum of the digits:**
   - Add the digits together: \(3 + 5 + 2\).

   \[
   3 + 5 = 8
   \]
   \[
   8 + 2 = 10
   \]

   So, the sum of the digits is 10.

3. **Determine if the sum is a prime number:**
   - A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.
   - The number 10 is greater than 1, but it is not a prime number because it has divisors other than 1 and itself. Specifically, 10 can be divided evenly by 2 and 5 (i.e., \(10 = 2 \times 5\)).

**Conclusion:**
The sum of the digits of the number 352 is 10, and 10 is not a prime number.

**Final Answer:**
The sum of the digits of 352 is 10, and it is not a prime number.
