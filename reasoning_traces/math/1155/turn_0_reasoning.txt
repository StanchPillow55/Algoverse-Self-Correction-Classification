==================================================

To find the total time of the cassette, we need to calculate the duration of both songs and then sum them up.

1. **Duration of the first song**: 
   - The first song is given as 5 minutes.

2. **Duration of the second song**: 
   - The second song is 60% longer than the first song. 
   - To find out how much longer that is, we first calculate 60% of the first song's duration:
     \[
     60\% \text{ of } 5 \text{ minutes} = 0.60 \times 5 = 3 \text{ minutes}
     \]
   - Now, we add this additional time to the duration of the first song to find the duration of the second song:
     \[
     \text{Duration of the second song} = 5 \text{ minutes} + 3 \text{ minutes} = 8 \text{ minutes}
     \]

3. **Total duration of the cassette**:
   - Now we add the durations of both songs together:
     \[
     \text{Total duration} = \text{Duration of the first song} + \text{Duration of the second song}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total duration} = 5 \text{ minutes} + 8 \text{ minutes} = 13 \text{ minutes}
     \]

Thus, the total time of the cassette is **13 minutes**. 

Final answer: **13 minutes**.
