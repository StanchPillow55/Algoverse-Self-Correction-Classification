==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 474" refers to. However, since the problem statement is not provided, I will demonstrate a general approach to solving a math problem by using a hypothetical example. Let's assume the problem is as follows:

**Problem:**  
A company sells two types of products: A and B. Product A sells for $50 each and Product B sells for $30 each. Last month, the company sold a total of 200 products and made $7,000 in revenue. How many of each product did the company sell?

**Step 1: Define Variables**  
Let \( x \) be the number of Product A sold.  
Let \( y \) be the number of Product B sold.

**Step 2: Set Up Equations**  
From the problem statement, we can set up the following equations:

1. Total products sold:  
   \[
   x + y = 200
   \]

2. Total revenue:  
   \[
   50x + 30y = 7000
   \]

**Step 3: Solve the System of Equations**  
We have the system of equations:
\[
\begin{align*}
x + y &= 200 \quad \text{(Equation 1)} \\
50x + 30y &= 7000 \quad \text{(Equation 2)}
\end{align*}
\]

First, solve Equation 1 for \( y \):
\[
y = 200 - x
\]

Substitute \( y = 200 - x \) into Equation 2:
\[
50x + 30(200 - x) = 7000
\]

Distribute the 30:
\[
50x + 6000 - 30x = 7000
\]

Combine like terms:
\[
20x + 6000 = 7000
\]

Subtract 6000 from both sides:
\[
20x = 1000
\]

Divide by 20:
\[
x = 50
\]

Now, substitute \( x = 50 \) back into the equation for \( y \):
\[
y = 200 - 50 = 150
\]

**Step 4: Verify the Solution**  
Check the solution with the revenue equation:
\[
50(50) + 30(150) = 2500 + 4500 = 7000
\]

Both equations are satisfied, so the solution is correct.

**Final Answer:**  
The company sold 50 units of Product A and 150 units of Product B.
