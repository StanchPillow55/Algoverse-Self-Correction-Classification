==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 474" entails. Since the problem statement is not explicitly provided, I'll demonstrate a general approach to solving a typical math problem by breaking it down into steps. Let's assume a sample math problem for demonstration purposes:

**Sample Problem:**
Calculate the value of \( x \) in the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We are given a linear equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).
   - Our goal is to solve for the variable \( x \).

2. **Isolate the Variable:**
   - To solve for \( x \), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation.
   - Start by eliminating the constant term on the left side of the equation.

3. **Subtract 3 from Both Sides:**
   \[
   2x + 3 - 3 = 11 - 3
   \]
   \[
   2x = 8
   \]
   - By subtracting 3 from both sides, we simplify the equation to \( 2x = 8 \).

4. **Divide by the Coefficient of \( x \):**
   - The coefficient of \( x \) is 2. To solve for \( x \), divide both sides of the equation by 2.
   \[
   \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{8}{2}
   \]
   \[
   x = 4
   \]

5. **Verify the Solution:**
   - Substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies the equation.
   \[
   2(4) + 3 = 11
   \]
   \[
   8 + 3 = 11
   \]
   \[
   11 = 11
   \]
   - The left side equals the right side, confirming that \( x = 4 \) is the correct solution.

6. **State the Final Answer:**
   - The value of \( x \) is \( \boxed{4} \).

This step-by-step approach demonstrates how to solve a linear equation by isolating the variable, performing arithmetic operations, and verifying the solution. If you have a specific problem or need further assistance, please provide additional details.
