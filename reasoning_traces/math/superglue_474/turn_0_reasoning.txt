==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 474" entails. Since the question is not explicitly stated, I'll assume it's a placeholder for a typical math problem. Let's create a sample problem and solve it step by step.

**Sample Problem:**

A company produces two types of products, A and B. The profit from each unit of product A is $3, and the profit from each unit of product B is $5. The company can produce a maximum of 100 units of product A and 80 units of product B per week. However, due to resource constraints, the total production of products A and B combined cannot exceed 150 units per week. How many units of each product should the company produce to maximize profit?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Define the Variables:**
   - Let \( x \) be the number of units of product A produced.
   - Let \( y \) be the number of units of product B produced.

2. **Write the Objective Function:**
   - The profit function \( P \) is given by:
     \[
     P = 3x + 5y
     \]
   - We want to maximize this profit function.

3. **Write the Constraints:**
   - The production constraints are:
     \[
     x \leq 100 \quad \text{(cannot produce more than 100 units of A)}
     \]
     \[
     y \leq 80 \quad \text{(cannot produce more than 80 units of B)}
     \]
     \[
     x + y \leq 150 \quad \text{(total production cannot exceed 150 units)}
     \]
   - Additionally, \( x \) and \( y \) must be non-negative:
     \[
     x \geq 0, \quad y \geq 0
     \]

4. **Graph the Constraints:**
   - Plot the lines \( x = 100 \), \( y = 80 \), and \( x + y = 150 \) on a graph.
   - Identify the feasible region that satisfies all constraints.

5. **Find the Corner Points:**
   - The feasible region is bounded by the lines and axes. The corner points are where the lines intersect:
     - Intersection of \( x = 100 \) and \( x + y = 150 \): \( (100, 50) \)
     - Intersection of \( y = 80 \) and \( x + y = 150 \): \( (70, 80) \)
     - Intersection of \( x = 0 \) and \( y = 80 \): \( (0, 80) \)
     - Intersection of \( y = 0 \) and \( x = 100 \): \( (100, 0) \)

6. **Evaluate the Objective Function at Each Corner Point:**
   - \( P(100, 50) = 3(100) + 5(50) = 300 + 250 = 550 \)
   - \( P(70, 80) = 3(70) + 5(80) = 210 + 400 = 610 \)
   - \( P(0, 80) = 3(0) + 5(80) = 0 + 400 = 400 \)
   - \( P(100, 0) = 3(100) + 5(0) = 300 + 0 = 300 \)

7. **Determine the Maximum Profit:**
   - The maximum profit is \( 610 \), which occurs at the point \( (70, 80) \).

**Final Answer:**
To maximize profit, the company should produce 70 units of product A and 80 units of product B, resulting in a maximum profit of $610.
