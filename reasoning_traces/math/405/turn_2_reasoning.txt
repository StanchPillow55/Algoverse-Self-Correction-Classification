Question ID: 405
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To determine how many boats can race in a river that is 42 feet across, we need to consider the width of each boat and the required spacing between the boats and the riverbank.

1. **Width of Each Boat**: Each boat is 3 feet wide.

2. **Required Spacing**: Each boat must have at least 2 feet of space between it and the next boat, as well as 2 feet of space between the boat and the riverbank.

3. **Total Space Required for Each Boat**: 
   - The space taken up by one boat is 3 feet.
   - The space required on either side of the boat is 2 feet (one side) + 2 feet (the other side) = 4 feet.
   - Therefore, the total space required for each boat is:
     \[
     \text{Total space per boat} = \text{Width of boat} + \text{Space on one side} + \text{Space on the other side}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total space per boat} = 3 \text{ feet} + 2 \text{ feet} + 2 \text{ feet} = 7 \text{ feet}
     \]

4. **Calculate the Number of Boats**: 
   - Now, we need to determine how many of these 7-foot segments can fit into the 42-foot width of the river.
   - We can find this by dividing the total width of the river by the total space required for each boat:
     \[
     \text{Number of boats} = \frac{\text{Width of river}}{\text{Total space per boat}} = \frac{42 \text{ feet}}{7 \text{ feet}} = 6
     \]

5. **Final Answer**: Therefore, the maximum number of boats that can race in the river is:
   \[
   \boxed{6}
   \]
