To determine how many boats can race in a river that is 42 feet across, we need to account for the width of each boat and the required spacing between the boats and the riverbank.

1. **Width of each boat**: Each boat is 3 feet wide.
2. **Required spacing**: There must be at least 2 feet of space between each boat and the riverbank, as well as between each boat.

### Step-by-step Calculation:

1. **Total width occupied by one boat and its required spacing**:
   - For one boat, the total width it occupies, including the space on one side, is:
     \[
     \text{Width of boat} + \text{Space on one side} = 3 \text{ feet} + 2 \text{ feet} = 5 \text{ feet}
     \]

2. **Total width for multiple boats**:
   - For \( n \) boats, we need to consider the space on both sides of the first boat and the space between each pair of boats. The total width occupied by \( n \) boats can be calculated as follows:
     \[
     \text{Total width} = 2 \text{ feet (space on one side of the first boat)} + n \times 3 \text{ feet (width of boats)} + (n - 1) \times 2 \text{ feet (space between boats)}
     \]
   - This simplifies to:
     \[
     \text{Total width} = 2 + 3n + 2(n - 1) = 2 + 3n + 2n - 2 = 5n
     \]

3. **Setting up the equation**:
   - We need the total width to be less than or equal to the width of the river:
     \[
     5n \leq 42
     \]

4. **Solving for \( n \)**:
   - Dividing both sides by 5 gives:
     \[
     n \leq \frac{42}{5} = 8.4
     \]
   - Since \( n \) must be a whole number (you can't have a fraction of a boat), we take the largest whole number less than or equal to 8.4, which is 8.

### Final Answer:
Thus, the maximum number of boats that can race in the river is \( \boxed{8} \).
