==================================================

To determine how many boats can race in a river that is 42 feet across, we need to consider the width of each boat and the required spacing between the boats and the riverbank.

1. **Width of Each Boat**: Each boat is 3 feet wide.

2. **Required Space Between Boats and Riverbank**: Each boat must have at least 2 feet of space between itself and the riverbank. Additionally, there must be at least 2 feet of space between adjacent boats.

3. **Total Space Required for Each Boat**: 
   - The space occupied by one boat is 3 feet.
   - The space required on one side of the boat is 2 feet (between the boat and the riverbank).
   - The space required on the other side of the boat is also 2 feet (between this boat and the next boat).
   
   Therefore, the total space required for one boat, including the required spacing, is:
   \[
   \text{Total space per boat} = \text{Width of boat} + \text{Space to riverbank} + \text{Space to next boat}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total space per boat} = 3 \text{ feet} + 2 \text{ feet} + 2 \text{ feet} = 7 \text{ feet}
   \]

4. **Calculating the Number of Boats**: 
   - The total width of the river is 42 feet.
   - To find out how many boats can fit, we divide the total width of the river by the total space required for each boat:
   \[
   \text{Number of boats} = \frac{\text{Total width of river}}{\text{Total space per boat}} = \frac{42 \text{ feet}}{7 \text{ feet}} = 6
   \]

5. **Final Answer**: Therefore, the maximum number of boats that can race in the river is:
\[
\boxed{6}
\]
