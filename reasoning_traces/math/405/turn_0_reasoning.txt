To determine how much Tyson will spend on meat and cheese for the muffaletta sandwiches, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the number of sandwiches needed**: 
   Each sandwich serves 4 people. Since there are 20 people in total, we can calculate the number of sandwiches required as follows:

   \[
   \text{Number of sandwiches} = \frac{\text{Total people}}{\text{People served per sandwich}} = \frac{20}{4} = 5 \text{ sandwiches}
   \]

2. **Calculate the total amount of meat and cheese needed**:
   Each sandwich requires 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese. Therefore, for 5 sandwiches, the total amount of meat and cheese needed is:

   \[
   \text{Total meat needed} = \text{Number of sandwiches} \times \text{Meat per sandwich} = 5 \times 1 = 5 \text{ pounds}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total cheese needed} = \text{Number of sandwiches} \times \text{Cheese per sandwich} = 5 \times 1 = 5 \text{ pounds}
   \]

3. **Calculate the cost of the meat**:
   The cost of meat is $7.00 per pound. Therefore, the total cost for the meat is:

   \[
   \text{Cost of meat} = \text{Total meat needed} \times \text{Cost per pound of meat} = 5 \times 7.00 = 35.00
   \]

4. **Calculate the cost of the cheese**:
   The cost of cheese is $3.00 per pound. Therefore, the total cost for the cheese is:

   \[
   \text{Cost of cheese} = \text{Total cheese needed} \times \text{Cost per pound of cheese} = 5 \times 3.00 = 15.00
   \]

5. **Calculate the total cost**:
   Now, we can find the total cost by adding the cost of the meat and the cost of the cheese:

   \[
   \text{Total cost} = \text{Cost of meat} + \text{Cost of cheese} = 35.00 + 15.00 = 50.00
   \]

Thus, the total amount of money Tyson would spend on the meat and cheese to make enough sandwiches to serve 20 people is:

\[
\boxed{50.00}
\]
