==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine how many boats can fit across a river that is 42 feet wide, given the constraints on spacing between the boats and the riverbanks.

### Step-by-step Solution:

1. **Understand the Constraints:**
   - Each boat is 3 feet wide.
   - There must be at least 2 feet of space between each boat.
   - There must be at least 2 feet of space between the outermost boats and the riverbanks.

2. **Calculate the Effective Width for Boats:**
   - Since there must be 2 feet of space between the outermost boats and the riverbanks, we need to subtract this space from the total width of the river.
   - Total space taken by the riverbanks: \(2 \text{ feet (left bank)} + 2 \text{ feet (right bank)} = 4 \text{ feet}\).
   - Effective width available for boats: \(42 \text{ feet} - 4 \text{ feet} = 38 \text{ feet}\).

3. **Determine the Space Required for Each Boat and the Space Between Boats:**
   - Each boat takes up 3 feet.
   - Each space between boats takes up 2 feet.

4. **Calculate the Number of Boats:**
   - Let's denote the number of boats as \( n \).
   - The total space required for \( n \) boats and the spaces between them is given by:
     \[
     3n + 2(n - 1)
     \]
   - The term \( 3n \) accounts for the width of the boats, and \( 2(n - 1) \) accounts for the spaces between the boats (note that there are \( n - 1 \) spaces between \( n \) boats).

5. **Set Up the Inequality:**
   - The total space used by the boats and spaces must be less than or equal to the effective width:
     \[
     3n + 2(n - 1) \leq 38
     \]

6. **Solve the Inequality:**
   \[
   3n + 2n - 2 \leq 38
   \]
   \[
   5n - 2 \leq 38
   \]
   \[
   5n \leq 40
   \]
   \[
   n \leq 8
   \]

7. **Conclusion:**
   - The maximum number of boats that can fit across the river, given the constraints, is 8.

### Final Answer:
8 boats can race in a river that is 42 feet across, with the given spacing constraints.
