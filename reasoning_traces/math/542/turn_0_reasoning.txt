==================================================

To find out how much change Verna received after buying the fruit, we need to calculate the total cost of the fruit she purchased and then subtract that from the amount she gave.

### Step 1: Calculate the cost of the apples
Verna bought 3 apples at $1.50 each. 
\[
\text{Cost of apples} = 3 \times 1.50 = 4.50
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the cost of the oranges
Verna bought 5 oranges at $0.80 each.
\[
\text{Cost of oranges} = 5 \times 0.80 = 4.00
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the cost of the peaches
Verna bought 6 peaches at $0.75 each.
\[
\text{Cost of peaches} = 6 \times 0.75 = 4.50
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the total cost of all the fruit
Now, we add the costs of the apples, oranges, and peaches together.
\[
\text{Total cost} = \text{Cost of apples} + \text{Cost of oranges} + \text{Cost of peaches}
\]
\[
\text{Total cost} = 4.50 + 4.00 + 4.50 = 13.00
\]

### Step 5: Calculate the change Verna received
Verna gave $20. To find out how much change she received, we subtract the total cost from the amount she gave.
\[
\text{Change} = \text{Amount given} - \text{Total cost}
\]
\[
\text{Change} = 20.00 - 13.00 = 7.00
\]

### Final Answer
Verna received **$7.00** in change.
