Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine how many hours Mark would need to jump rope to reach a total of 54,000 jumps, given that he can jump 3 times per second.

### Step-by-step Calculation:

1. **Determine the total number of jumps needed:**
   - The record is 54,000 jumps.

2. **Calculate the number of seconds needed to reach 54,000 jumps:**
   - Mark can jump 3 times per second.
   - To find out how many seconds it takes to reach 54,000 jumps, we divide the total number of jumps by the number of jumps per second:
     \[
     \text{Seconds needed} = \frac{54,000 \text{ jumps}}{3 \text{ jumps/second}} = 18,000 \text{ seconds}
     \]

3. **Convert seconds into hours:**
   - There are 60 seconds in a minute and 60 minutes in an hour. Therefore, there are \(60 \times 60 = 3,600\) seconds in an hour.
   - To convert seconds to hours, divide the total number of seconds by the number of seconds in an hour:
     \[
     \text{Hours needed} = \frac{18,000 \text{ seconds}}{3,600 \text{ seconds/hour}} = 5 \text{ hours}
     \]

### Conclusion:

Mark would need to jump rope for 5 hours to reach a total of 54,000 jumps at a rate of 3 jumps per second.

**Final Answer: 5 hours**
