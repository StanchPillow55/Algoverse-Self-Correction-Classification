==================================================

To determine how many hours Mark would need to jump rope to set the record of 54,000 consecutive jumps, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of seconds required to complete 54,000 jumps.**
   Since Mark can jump 3 times a second, we can find the total time in seconds by dividing the total jumps by the jumps per second:

   \[
   \text{Total time in seconds} = \frac{\text{Total jumps}}{\text{Jumps per second}} = \frac{54,000 \text{ jumps}}{3 \text{ jumps/second}} = 18,000 \text{ seconds}
   \]

2. **Convert seconds into hours.**
   There are 60 seconds in a minute and 60 minutes in an hour, which means there are:

   \[
   60 \text{ seconds/minute} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 3600 \text{ seconds/hour}
   \]

   To convert the total time from seconds to hours, we divide the total seconds by the number of seconds in an hour:

   \[
   \text{Total time in hours} = \frac{\text{Total time in seconds}}{\text{Seconds per hour}} = \frac{18,000 \text{ seconds}}{3600 \text{ seconds/hour}} = 5 \text{ hours}
   \]

3. **Final Answer:**
   Therefore, Mark would need to jump rope for **5 hours** to set the record of 54,000 consecutive jumps.

\[
\boxed{5}
\]
