==================================================

To determine how much money Sally has left after her purchases, we will calculate the total cost of her items step by step.

1. **Cost of Taffy:**
   - The sale states "Buy 1 pound at $3, get 1 pound 1/2 off."
   - The first pound costs $3.
   - The second pound is half off, which means it costs \( \frac{3}{2} = 1.50 \).
   - Therefore, the total cost for 2 pounds of taffy is:
     \[
     3 + 1.50 = 4.50
     \]

2. **Cost of Mixed Bag of Seashells:**
   - The mixed bag of seashells costs $1.50.

3. **Cost of Magnets:**
   - Each magnet costs $0.25, and Sally bought 4 magnets.
   - The total cost for the magnets is:
     \[
     4 \times 0.25 = 1.00
     \]

4. **Total Cost of All Items:**
   - Now we will sum the costs of all the items:
     \[
     \text{Total Cost} = \text{Cost of Taffy} + \text{Cost of Seashells} + \text{Cost of Magnets}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total Cost} = 4.50 + 1.50 + 1.00 = 7.00
     \]

5. **Calculating Remaining Money:**
   - Sally started with $10. To find out how much money she has left after her purchases, we subtract the total cost from her initial amount:
     \[
     \text{Remaining Money} = 10 - 7.00 = 3.00
     \]

Thus, after all her purchases, Sally has **$3.00** left.

Final answer: **$3.00**
