==================================================

To solve the problem, we start by determining how many hash browns can be made from one potato. 

1. **Calculate the number of hash browns per potato:**
   We know that 6 potatoes make 36 hash browns. To find out how many hash browns can be made from one potato, we divide the total number of hash browns by the number of potatoes:

   \[
   \text{Hash browns per potato} = \frac{36 \text{ hash browns}}{6 \text{ potatoes}} = 6 \text{ hash browns per potato}
   \]

2. **Calculate the total number of hash browns from 96 potatoes:**
   Now that we know each potato can produce 6 hash browns, we can find out how many hash browns can be made from 96 potatoes by multiplying the number of potatoes by the number of hash browns each potato produces:

   \[
   \text{Total hash browns} = 96 \text{ potatoes} \times 6 \text{ hash browns per potato}
   \]

   Performing the multiplication:

   \[
   96 \times 6 = 576
   \]

3. **Final answer:**
   Therefore, the total number of hash browns that can be made from 96 potatoes is:

   \[
   \boxed{576}
   \]
