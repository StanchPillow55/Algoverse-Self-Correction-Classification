==================================================

To find the total number of students participating in the different sports, we will break down the problem step by step.

1. **Identify the number of students playing tennis:**
   - The problem states that there are 6 students playing tennis.

2. **Identify the number of students playing volleyball:**
   - It is mentioned that there are twice the number of students playing volleyball compared to tennis. 
   - Therefore, the number of students playing volleyball is:
     \[
     2 \times 6 = 12
     \]

3. **Identify the number of students playing soccer:**
   - The problem states that there are 16 boys and 22 girls playing soccer.
   - To find the total number of students playing soccer, we add the number of boys and girls:
     \[
     16 + 22 = 38
     \]

4. **Calculate the total number of students:**
   - Now, we will add the number of students from each sport to find the total number of students:
     \[
     \text{Total students} = \text{Tennis students} + \text{Volleyball students} + \text{Soccer students}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total students} = 6 + 12 + 38
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total students} = 56
     \]

5. **Final answer:**
   - The total number of students participating in tennis, volleyball, and soccer is:
     \[
     \boxed{56}
     \]
