To find out how many tax reports the IRS received on Wednesday, we can start by breaking down the information given in the problem.

1. **Total Reports Received**: The IRS received a total of 5168 tax reports last week.

2. **Reports Received on Monday and Tuesday**: The total number of reports received on Monday and Tuesday is 1907.

3. **Reports Received on Thursday and Friday**: The total number of reports received on Thursday and Friday is 2136.

4. **Finding Reports Received on Wednesday**: We need to determine how many reports were received on Wednesday. 

To do this, we can use the following steps:

- First, we will add the reports received on Monday and Tuesday to the reports received on Thursday and Friday.
  
  \[
  \text{Reports on Monday and Tuesday} + \text{Reports on Thursday and Friday} = 1907 + 2136
  \]

- Now, let's calculate that sum:

  \[
  1907 + 2136 = 4043
  \]

- Next, we will subtract this sum from the total number of reports received during the week to find out how many reports were received on Wednesday:

  \[
  \text{Total Reports} - \text{Reports on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday} = 5168 - 4043
  \]

- Now, let's perform this subtraction:

  \[
  5168 - 4043 = 1125
  \]

Thus, the number of reports received on Wednesday is **1125**.

Finally, we can state the answer clearly:

**Final Answer**: The IRS received 1125 tax reports on Wednesday.
