==================================================

It seems like the problem statement "Sample math problem 56" is not clear or specific enough to provide a detailed solution. However, I can guide you through a generic approach to solving math problems, or if you have a specific type of problem in mind (e.g., algebra, geometry, calculus), please provide more details. 

For now, let's assume a generic math problem-solving approach:

### Step-by-Step Problem Solving Approach

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - Carefully read the problem statement.
   - Identify what is being asked.
   - Determine the information given and what needs to be found.

2. **Devise a Plan:**
   - Think about the strategies that could be used to solve the problem (e.g., algebraic manipulation, drawing a diagram, logical reasoning).
   - Consider similar problems you have solved before.

3. **Carry Out the Plan:**
   - Execute the chosen strategy step by step.
   - Perform calculations carefully.
   - Keep track of units and ensure consistency.

4. **Review/Check Your Work:**
   - Verify each step and calculation.
   - Check if the solution makes sense in the context of the problem.
   - Ensure that the final answer addresses the question.

### Example Problem

Let's create a simple example problem to demonstrate this approach:

**Problem:** Solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).

**Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We need to find the value of \( x \) that satisfies the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).

2. **Devise a Plan:**
   - We can isolate \( x \) by performing algebraic operations.

3. **Carry Out the Plan:**
   - Start with the equation: \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).
   - Subtract 3 from both sides to isolate the term with \( x \):
     \[
     2x + 3 - 3 = 11 - 3
     \]
     \[
     2x = 8
     \]
   - Divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( x \):
     \[
     \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{8}{2}
     \]
     \[
     x = 4
     \]

4. **Review/Check Your Work:**
   - Substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation to verify:
     \[
     2(4) + 3 = 8 + 3 = 11
     \]
   - The left-hand side equals the right-hand side, confirming our solution is correct.

**Final Answer:**
\( x = 4 \)

If you have a specific problem or topic in mind, please provide more details, and I would be happy to help!
