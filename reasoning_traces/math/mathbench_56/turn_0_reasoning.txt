It seems like the problem statement is incomplete or unclear. "Sample math problem 56" doesn't provide enough information for me to solve a specific problem. However, I can guide you through a generic math problem-solving process or help with a specific type of problem if you provide more details.

If you have a specific math problem in mind, please provide the full details. For now, I'll demonstrate how to solve a generic math problem by creating an example:

**Example Problem:**

Solve for \( x \) in the equation: \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We need to solve for \( x \) in the linear equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).

2. **Isolate the Variable:**
   - To solve for \( x \), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We start by eliminating the constant term on the left side.
   - Subtract 3 from both sides of the equation:
     \[
     2x + 3 - 3 = 11 - 3
     \]
   - Simplifying both sides gives:
     \[
     2x = 8
     \]

3. **Solve for \( x \):**
   - Now, divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( x \):
     \[
     \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{8}{2}
     \]
   - Simplifying both sides gives:
     \[
     x = 4
     \]

4. **Verify the Solution:**
   - Substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation to verify:
     \[
     2(4) + 3 = 11
     \]
   - Simplifying the left side gives:
     \[
     8 + 3 = 11
     \]
   - Since both sides of the equation are equal, our solution is verified.

**Final Answer:**

The solution to the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \) is \( x = 4 \).

If you have a specific problem or need help with a different type of math problem, please provide the details, and I'll be happy to help!
