==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 56," we need to first understand what the problem is asking. However, the problem statement is incomplete as it only says "Sample math problem 56" without providing any specific details or context. Therefore, I will assume that "Sample math problem 56" is a placeholder for a specific math problem that needs to be solved.

Since no specific details are provided, let's create a hypothetical math problem that could be labeled as "Sample math problem 56" and solve it step by step. Let's assume the problem is as follows:

**Problem Statement:**
Calculate the sum of the first 56 positive integers.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   We need to find the sum of the first 56 positive integers. The sequence of the first 56 positive integers is: 1, 2, 3, ..., 56.

2. **Identify the Formula:**
   The sum of the first \( n \) positive integers can be calculated using the formula:
   \[
   S = \frac{n(n + 1)}{2}
   \]
   where \( S \) is the sum and \( n \) is the number of terms.

3. **Substitute the Values:**
   In this problem, \( n = 56 \). Substitute 56 into the formula:
   \[
   S = \frac{56(56 + 1)}{2}
   \]

4. **Calculate the Sum:**
   First, calculate \( 56 + 1 \):
   \[
   56 + 1 = 57
   \]
   Now, substitute back into the formula:
   \[
   S = \frac{56 \times 57}{2}
   \]

5. **Perform the Multiplication:**
   Calculate \( 56 \times 57 \):
   \[
   56 \times 57 = 3192
   \]

6. **Divide by 2:**
   Now divide 3192 by 2 to find the sum:
   \[
   S = \frac{3192}{2} = 1596
   \]

7. **State the Final Answer:**
   The sum of the first 56 positive integers is 1596.

**Final Answer:**
The sum of the first 56 positive integers is 1596.
