==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 56," we need to first understand what the problem is asking. Since the problem is not specified, let's assume it involves basic arithmetic operations with the number 56. We will explore a few possible scenarios involving the number 56 and solve them step by step.

### Scenario 1: Basic Arithmetic Operations

1. **Addition**: Let's add 56 to another number, say 44.
   \[
   56 + 44 = 100
   \]
   **Reasoning**: We simply add the two numbers together. The sum of 56 and 44 is 100.

2. **Subtraction**: Let's subtract 30 from 56.
   \[
   56 - 30 = 26
   \]
   **Reasoning**: We subtract 30 from 56, which results in 26.

3. **Multiplication**: Let's multiply 56 by 3.
   \[
   56 \times 3 = 168
   \]
   **Reasoning**: We multiply 56 by 3. To do this, we can break it down as follows:
   \[
   56 \times 3 = (50 + 6) \times 3 = 50 \times 3 + 6 \times 3 = 150 + 18 = 168
   \]

4. **Division**: Let's divide 56 by 7.
   \[
   56 \div 7 = 8
   \]
   **Reasoning**: We divide 56 by 7. Since 56 is evenly divisible by 7, the result is 8.

### Scenario 2: Factorization

Let's factor the number 56.

1. **Prime Factorization**:
   - 56 is an even number, so it is divisible by 2.
   \[
   56 \div 2 = 28
   \]
   - 28 is also even, so divide by 2 again.
   \[
   28 \div 2 = 14
   \]
   - 14 is even, so divide by 2 once more.
   \[
   14 \div 2 = 7
   \]
   - 7 is a prime number.

   **Prime Factorization of 56**: \(2^3 \times 7\)

### Scenario 3: Solving an Equation

Let's solve a simple equation involving 56. Suppose we have the equation:
\[ 
x + 56 = 100 
\]

1. **Solve for \(x\)**:
   \[
   x + 56 = 100
   \]
   Subtract 56 from both sides:
   \[
   x = 100 - 56
   \]
   \[
   x = 44
   \]

**Reasoning**: We isolate \(x\) by subtracting 56 from both sides of the equation.

### Final Answer

Since the original problem "Sample math problem 56" was not specified, we explored various scenarios involving the number 56. Here are the final answers for each scenario:

1. **Addition**: 56 + 44 = 100
2. **Subtraction**: 56 - 30 = 26
3. **Multiplication**: 56 ร 3 = 168
4. **Division**: 56 รท 7 = 8
5. **Prime Factorization**: \(2^3 \times 7\)
6. **Equation Solution**: \(x = 44\) when \(x + 56 = 100\)

If you have a specific problem involving the number 56, please provide more details for a precise solution.
