==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 56," we need to first understand what the problem is asking. However, the phrase "Sample math problem 56" is not specific enough to identify a particular math problem. It seems like a placeholder or a reference to a specific problem that might be listed elsewhere.

Since there is no specific math problem provided, I will demonstrate how to solve a typical math problem that might be labeled as "Sample math problem 56" in a textbook or worksheet. Let's assume a common type of problem, such as solving a linear equation. Here's an example:

**Example Problem:**
Solve for \( x \) in the equation: \( 3x + 5 = 20 \).

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Equation:**
   The equation \( 3x + 5 = 20 \) is a linear equation where we need to find the value of \( x \) that makes the equation true.

2. **Isolate the Variable:**
   To solve for \( x \), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We can start by eliminating the constant term on the left side.

   Subtract 5 from both sides of the equation:
   \[
   3x + 5 - 5 = 20 - 5
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   3x = 15
   \]

3. **Solve for \( x \):**
   Now, divide both sides by 3 to solve for \( x \):
   \[
   \frac{3x}{3} = \frac{15}{3}
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   x = 5
   \]

4. **Verify the Solution:**
   Substitute \( x = 5 \) back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies the equation:
   \[
   3(5) + 5 = 20
   \]
   Simplifying the left side:
   \[
   15 + 5 = 20
   \]
   \[
   20 = 20
   \]
   Since both sides of the equation are equal, \( x = 5 \) is indeed the correct solution.

**Final Answer:**
The solution to the equation \( 3x + 5 = 20 \) is \( x = 5 \).
