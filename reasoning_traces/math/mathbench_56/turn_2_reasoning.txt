==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 56," we need to first understand what the problem is asking. However, the problem statement "Sample math problem 56" is not specific enough to determine what calculations or reasoning are required. Therefore, I will assume this is a placeholder for a typical math problem. Let's create a hypothetical math problem and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**
Calculate the sum of all even numbers from 1 to 56.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Identify the Even Numbers:**
   Even numbers are integers divisible by 2. From 1 to 56, the even numbers are: 2, 4, 6, ..., 56.

2. **Determine the Sequence:**
   This sequence of even numbers is an arithmetic sequence where the first term \( a_1 = 2 \) and the common difference \( d = 2 \).

3. **Find the Number of Terms:**
   To find the number of terms \( n \) in the sequence, use the formula for the \( n \)-th term of an arithmetic sequence:
   \[
   a_n = a_1 + (n-1) \cdot d
   \]
   Set \( a_n = 56 \) (the last term):
   \[
   56 = 2 + (n-1) \cdot 2
   \]
   \[
   56 = 2 + 2n - 2
   \]
   \[
   56 = 2n
   \]
   \[
   n = 28
   \]

4. **Calculate the Sum of the Sequence:**
   The sum \( S_n \) of the first \( n \) terms of an arithmetic sequence is given by:
   \[
   S_n = \frac{n}{2} \cdot (a_1 + a_n)
   \]
   Substitute the known values:
   \[
   S_{28} = \frac{28}{2} \cdot (2 + 56)
   \]
   \[
   S_{28} = 14 \cdot 58
   \]
   \[
   S_{28} = 812
   \]

**Final Answer:**
The sum of all even numbers from 1 to 56 is 812.
