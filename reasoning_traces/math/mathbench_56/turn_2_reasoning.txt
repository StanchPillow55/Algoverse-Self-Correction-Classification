Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we first need to understand what "Sample math problem 56" refers to. Since the problem is not explicitly stated, let's assume it involves a typical math problem that could be labeled as such. For the sake of this exercise, let's consider a problem involving basic algebra, as this is a common topic in math problems.

Let's assume the problem is as follows:

**Problem:** Solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Understand the Equation:**
   The equation given is \( 2x + 3 = 11 \). This is a linear equation in one variable, \( x \).

2. **Isolate the Variable:**
   To solve for \( x \), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We can do this by performing operations that will cancel out the other terms.

3. **Subtract 3 from Both Sides:**
   To eliminate the constant term on the left side, subtract 3 from both sides of the equation:
   \[
   2x + 3 - 3 = 11 - 3
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   2x = 8
   \]

4. **Divide by 2:**
   To solve for \( x \), divide both sides of the equation by 2:
   \[
   \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{8}{2}
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   x = 4
   \]

5. **Verify the Solution:**
   Substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies the equation:
   \[
   2(4) + 3 = 11
   \]
   Simplifying the left side gives:
   \[
   8 + 3 = 11
   \]
   Since both sides of the equation are equal, the solution \( x = 4 \) is verified.

### Final Answer:
The solution to the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \) is \( x = 4 \).
