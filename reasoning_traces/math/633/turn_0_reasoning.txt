==================================================

To determine how long it will take Tom to catch up with Bob, we can set up the problem using the concept of relative speed.

1. **Identify the distances and speeds**:
   - Bob is 75 miles ahead of Tom.
   - Bob's speed = 55 miles per hour.
   - Tom's speed = 70 miles per hour.

2. **Calculate the relative speed**:
   Since Tom is driving faster than Bob, we can find the relative speed at which Tom is closing the gap between them. The relative speed is the difference in their speeds:
   \[
   \text{Relative Speed} = \text{Tom's Speed} - \text{Bob's Speed} = 70 \text{ mph} - 55 \text{ mph} = 15 \text{ mph}
   \]

3. **Determine the time to catch up**:
   To find the time it takes for Tom to catch up with Bob, we can use the formula:
   \[
   \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}}
   \]
   Here, the distance is the initial gap between them (75 miles), and the speed is the relative speed (15 mph):
   \[
   \text{Time} = \frac{75 \text{ miles}}{15 \text{ mph}} = 5 \text{ hours}
   \]

4. **Conclusion**:
   It will take Tom 5 hours to catch up with Bob.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{5 \text{ hours}}
\]
