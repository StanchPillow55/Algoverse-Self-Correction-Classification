==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 70" refers to. However, since the problem statement is not clear or specific, I'll demonstrate a general approach to solving a typical math problem by creating a hypothetical example. Let's assume "Sample reasoning question 70" is a math problem involving algebra.

**Hypothetical Problem:**
Solve for \( x \) in the equation: \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Equation:**
   The given equation is \( 2x + 3 = 11 \). Our goal is to solve for the variable \( x \).

2. **Isolate the Variable:**
   To solve for \( x \), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We can start by eliminating the constant term on the left side of the equation.

3. **Subtract 3 from Both Sides:**
   \[
   2x + 3 - 3 = 11 - 3
   \]
   Simplifying both sides, we get:
   \[
   2x = 8
   \]

4. **Divide by the Coefficient of \( x \):**
   The next step is to divide both sides of the equation by 2, the coefficient of \( x \), to solve for \( x \).
   \[
   \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{8}{2}
   \]
   Simplifying, we find:
   \[
   x = 4
   \]

5. **Verify the Solution:**
   To ensure our solution is correct, we substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation:
   \[
   2(4) + 3 = 11
   \]
   Simplifying the left side:
   \[
   8 + 3 = 11
   \]
   Since both sides of the equation are equal, our solution \( x = 4 \) is verified.

**Final Answer:**
The solution to the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \) is \( x = 4 \).

This step-by-step approach demonstrates how to solve a basic algebraic equation. If "Sample reasoning question 70" refers to a different type of problem, please provide additional details or context for a more specific solution.
