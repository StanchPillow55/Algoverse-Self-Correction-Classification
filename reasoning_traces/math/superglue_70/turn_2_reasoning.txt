==================================================

To solve the problem effectively, let's first understand what is being asked. The question is labeled as "Sample reasoning question 70," but it doesn't provide any specific mathematical problem or context. Therefore, I'll assume this is a placeholder for a reasoning problem, and I'll create a hypothetical math problem to solve.

Let's assume the problem is as follows:

**Problem:**
A store sells two types of candies: chocolate and gummy bears. The price of a chocolate is $2, and the price of a gummy bear is $1.50. If a customer buys a total of 10 candies and spends $17, how many chocolates and gummy bears did the customer buy?

**Solution:**

To solve this problem, we need to set up a system of equations based on the information given.

1. **Define the variables:**
   - Let \( x \) be the number of chocolates.
   - Let \( y \) be the number of gummy bears.

2. **Set up the equations:**
   - The total number of candies is 10:
     \[
     x + y = 10
     \]
   - The total cost of the candies is $17:
     \[
     2x + 1.5y = 17
     \]

3. **Solve the system of equations:**

   We have the following system:
   \[
   \begin{align*}
   x + y &= 10 \quad \text{(Equation 1)} \\
   2x + 1.5y &= 17 \quad \text{(Equation 2)}
   \end{align*}
   \]

   From Equation 1, express \( y \) in terms of \( x \):
   \[
   y = 10 - x
   \]

   Substitute \( y = 10 - x \) into Equation 2:
   \[
   2x + 1.5(10 - x) = 17
   \]

   Simplify and solve for \( x \):
   \[
   2x + 15 - 1.5x = 17
   \]
   \[
   0.5x + 15 = 17
   \]
   \[
   0.5x = 2
   \]
   \[
   x = 4
   \]

   Substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the expression for \( y \):
   \[
   y = 10 - 4 = 6
   \]

4. **Verify the solution:**

   Check if the solution satisfies both original equations:
   - For Equation 1: \( x + y = 4 + 6 = 10 \), which is correct.
   - For Equation 2: \( 2x + 1.5y = 2(4) + 1.5(6) = 8 + 9 = 17 \), which is also correct.

Thus, the customer bought 4 chocolates and 6 gummy bears.

**Final Answer:**
The customer bought 4 chocolates and 6 gummy bears.
