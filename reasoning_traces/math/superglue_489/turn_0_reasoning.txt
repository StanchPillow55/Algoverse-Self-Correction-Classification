To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 489" entails. Since the question itself is not provided, I'll create a hypothetical math problem and solve it step-by-step.

Let's assume the problem is as follows:

**Problem:**
A company produces two types of widgets: Type A and Type B. The company sells Type A widgets for $50 each and Type B widgets for $70 each. The production cost for Type A is $30 per widget, and for Type B, it is $40 per widget. In a month, the company sold 200 Type A widgets and 150 Type B widgets. Calculate the total profit for the month.

**Solution:**

To find the total profit, we need to calculate the total revenue and the total cost, then subtract the total cost from the total revenue.

**Step 1: Calculate Total Revenue**

- Revenue from Type A widgets:
  \[
  \text{Revenue from Type A} = \text{Number of Type A widgets sold} \times \text{Selling price per Type A widget}
  \]
  \[
  \text{Revenue from Type A} = 200 \times 50 = 10,000
  \]

- Revenue from Type B widgets:
  \[
  \text{Revenue from Type B} = \text{Number of Type B widgets sold} \times \text{Selling price per Type B widget}
  \]
  \[
  \text{Revenue from Type B} = 150 \times 70 = 10,500
  \]

- Total Revenue:
  \[
  \text{Total Revenue} = \text{Revenue from Type A} + \text{Revenue from Type B}
  \]
  \[
  \text{Total Revenue} = 10,000 + 10,500 = 20,500
  \]

**Step 2: Calculate Total Cost**

- Cost for Type A widgets:
  \[
  \text{Cost for Type A} = \text{Number of Type A widgets produced} \times \text{Cost per Type A widget}
  \]
  \[
  \text{Cost for Type A} = 200 \times 30 = 6,000
  \]

- Cost for Type B widgets:
  \[
  \text{Cost for Type B} = \text{Number of Type B widgets produced} \times \text{Cost per Type B widget}
  \]
  \[
  \text{Cost for Type B} = 150 \times 40 = 6,000
  \]

- Total Cost:
  \[
  \text{Total Cost} = \text{Cost for Type A} + \text{Cost for Type B}
  \]
  \[
  \text{Total Cost} = 6,000 + 6,000 = 12,000
  \]

**Step 3: Calculate Total Profit**

- Total Profit:
  \[
  \text{Total Profit} = \text{Total Revenue} - \text{Total Cost}
  \]
  \[
  \text{Total Profit} = 20,500 - 12,000 = 8,500
  \]

**Final Answer:**
The total profit for the month is $8,500.
