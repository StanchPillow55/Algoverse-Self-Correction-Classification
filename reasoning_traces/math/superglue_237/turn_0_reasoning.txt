To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 237" entails. Since the question is not explicitly provided, I'll create a hypothetical math problem and solve it step by step.

Let's assume "Sample reasoning question 237" is as follows:

**Problem:**
A company produces two types of widgets: Type A and Type B. The production cost for Type A is $5 per widget, and for Type B, it is $8 per widget. The company sells Type A widgets for $10 each and Type B widgets for $15 each. Last month, the company sold a total of 500 widgets and made a total revenue of $6,500. How many of each type of widget did the company sell?

**Solution:**

To solve this problem, we need to determine how many Type A and Type B widgets were sold. Let's denote:
- \( x \) as the number of Type A widgets sold.
- \( y \) as the number of Type B widgets sold.

We have two key pieces of information:
1. The total number of widgets sold is 500.
2. The total revenue from selling these widgets is $6,500.

We can set up the following system of equations based on this information:

1. \( x + y = 500 \) (Equation 1: Total widgets sold)
2. \( 10x + 15y = 6500 \) (Equation 2: Total revenue)

Now, let's solve this system of equations.

**Step 1: Solve Equation 1 for one variable.**

From Equation 1:
\[ x + y = 500 \]
\[ x = 500 - y \]

**Step 2: Substitute the expression for \( x \) into Equation 2.**

Substitute \( x = 500 - y \) into Equation 2:
\[ 10(500 - y) + 15y = 6500 \]

**Step 3: Simplify and solve for \( y \).**

\[ 5000 - 10y + 15y = 6500 \]
\[ 5000 + 5y = 6500 \]
\[ 5y = 6500 - 5000 \]
\[ 5y = 1500 \]
\[ y = \frac{1500}{5} \]
\[ y = 300 \]

So, the company sold 300 Type B widgets.

**Step 4: Substitute \( y = 300 \) back into the expression for \( x \).**

\[ x = 500 - y \]
\[ x = 500 - 300 \]
\[ x = 200 \]

So, the company sold 200 Type A widgets.

**Final Answer:**
The company sold 200 Type A widgets and 300 Type B widgets.
