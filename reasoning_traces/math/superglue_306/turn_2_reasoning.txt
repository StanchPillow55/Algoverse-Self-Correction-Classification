==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 306" refers to. Since the problem statement is not explicitly provided, I'll assume that "Sample reasoning question 306" is a placeholder for a specific math problem. Without the actual content of the problem, I will demonstrate a general approach to solving a typical math problem by using a hypothetical example.

Let's assume "Sample reasoning question 306" is a math problem involving solving a quadratic equation. Here's how we would approach it:

**Hypothetical Problem:**
Solve the quadratic equation \(2x^2 - 4x - 6 = 0\).

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Identify the type of equation:**
   The given equation \(2x^2 - 4x - 6 = 0\) is a quadratic equation in the standard form \(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\), where \(a = 2\), \(b = -4\), and \(c = -6\).

2. **Check if the equation can be factored:**
   We look for two numbers that multiply to \(a \times c = 2 \times (-6) = -12\) and add to \(b = -4\). The numbers -6 and 2 satisfy these conditions because \(-6 \times 2 = -12\) and \(-6 + 2 = -4\).

3. **Rewrite the middle term using these numbers:**
   Rewrite \(-4x\) as \(-6x + 2x\):
   \[
   2x^2 - 6x + 2x - 6 = 0
   \]

4. **Factor by grouping:**
   Group the terms:
   \[
   (2x^2 - 6x) + (2x - 6) = 0
   \]
   Factor out the greatest common factor from each group:
   \[
   2x(x - 3) + 2(x - 3) = 0
   \]

5. **Factor out the common binomial factor:**
   \[
   (2x + 2)(x - 3) = 0
   \]

6. **Simplify the expression:**
   Factor out the common factor of 2:
   \[
   2(x + 1)(x - 3) = 0
   \]

7. **Apply the zero product property:**
   Set each factor equal to zero:
   \[
   x + 1 = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad x - 3 = 0
   \]

8. **Solve for \(x\):**
   \[
   x = -1 \quad \text{or} \quad x = 3
   \]

**Final Answer:**
The solutions to the quadratic equation \(2x^2 - 4x - 6 = 0\) are \(x = -1\) and \(x = 3\).

This is a demonstration of how to solve a quadratic equation using factoring. If "Sample reasoning question 306" refers to a different type of problem, please provide additional details or context so I can address it specifically.
