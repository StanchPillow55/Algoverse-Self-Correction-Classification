Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 306" refers to. Since the problem statement is not clear and does not provide any specific mathematical question or context, I'll assume that this is a placeholder for a typical math problem. 

Let's create a hypothetical math problem to solve:

**Problem:**
Calculate the sum of the first 306 positive integers.

**Solution:**

To find the sum of the first \( n \) positive integers, we can use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series:

\[
S_n = \frac{n(n + 1)}{2}
\]

where \( S_n \) is the sum of the first \( n \) integers.

In this case, \( n = 306 \). Plugging this value into the formula gives:

\[
S_{306} = \frac{306 \times (306 + 1)}{2}
\]

First, calculate \( 306 + 1 \):

\[
306 + 1 = 307
\]

Next, multiply 306 by 307:

\[
306 \times 307 = 93762
\]

Now, divide the product by 2 to find the sum:

\[
S_{306} = \frac{93762}{2} = 46881
\]

Therefore, the sum of the first 306 positive integers is \( 46881 \).

**Final Answer:**

The sum of the first 306 positive integers is \( 46881 \).
