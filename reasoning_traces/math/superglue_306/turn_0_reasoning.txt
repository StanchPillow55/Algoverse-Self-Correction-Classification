==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 306" refers to. Since the question is not explicitly provided, I'll assume it's a placeholder for a typical math problem. Let's create a sample math problem and solve it step by step.

**Sample Problem:**
A car travels from Town A to Town B, a distance of 150 miles. The car travels the first 90 miles at a speed of 60 miles per hour and the remaining distance at a speed of 50 miles per hour. How long does the entire trip take?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - Total distance from Town A to Town B = 150 miles.
   - Distance traveled at 60 mph = 90 miles.
   - Remaining distance = 150 miles - 90 miles = 60 miles.
   - Speed for the remaining distance = 50 mph.

2. **Calculate the Time for Each Segment:**
   - Time is calculated using the formula: \(\text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}}\).

   **First Segment:**
   - Distance = 90 miles
   - Speed = 60 mph
   - Time for the first segment = \(\frac{90 \text{ miles}}{60 \text{ mph}} = 1.5 \text{ hours}\).

   **Second Segment:**
   - Distance = 60 miles
   - Speed = 50 mph
   - Time for the second segment = \(\frac{60 \text{ miles}}{50 \text{ mph}} = 1.2 \text{ hours}\).

3. **Calculate the Total Time:**
   - Total time = Time for the first segment + Time for the second segment
   - Total time = 1.5 hours + 1.2 hours = 2.7 hours.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The entire trip takes 2.7 hours.

Therefore, the final answer is that the entire trip takes 2.7 hours.
