To solve the problem, we need to first understand what is being asked. However, the question "Sample reasoning question 434" does not provide specific details or context about what needs to be solved. Therefore, I will create a sample math problem and solve it step by step.

Let's assume the problem is as follows:

**Problem:**
A company produces two types of widgets: Type A and Type B. The company sells Type A widgets for $50 each and Type B widgets for $70 each. In one month, the company sold a total of 500 widgets and earned $30,000 in revenue. How many of each type of widget did the company sell?

**Solution:**

To solve this problem, we need to determine how many Type A and Type B widgets were sold. Let's use algebra to set up the equations.

1. **Define the variables:**
   - Let \( x \) be the number of Type A widgets sold.
   - Let \( y \) be the number of Type B widgets sold.

2. **Set up the equations based on the problem:**
   - The total number of widgets sold is 500:
     \[
     x + y = 500
     \]
   - The total revenue from selling the widgets is $30,000:
     \[
     50x + 70y = 30,000
     \]

3. **Solve the system of equations:**

   We have the following system of equations:
   \[
   \begin{align*}
   x + y &= 500 \quad \text{(Equation 1)} \\
   50x + 70y &= 30,000 \quad \text{(Equation 2)}
   \end{align*}
   \]

   First, solve Equation 1 for \( y \):
   \[
   y = 500 - x
   \]

   Substitute \( y = 500 - x \) into Equation 2:
   \[
   50x + 70(500 - x) = 30,000
   \]

   Simplify and solve for \( x \):
   \[
   50x + 35,000 - 70x = 30,000
   \]
   \[
   -20x + 35,000 = 30,000
   \]
   \[
   -20x = 30,000 - 35,000
   \]
   \[
   -20x = -5,000
   \]
   \[
   x = \frac{-5,000}{-20}
   \]
   \[
   x = 250
   \]

   Now, substitute \( x = 250 \) back into the equation for \( y \):
   \[
   y = 500 - 250
   \]
   \[
   y = 250
   \]

4. **Conclusion:**

   The company sold 250 Type A widgets and 250 Type B widgets.

**Final Answer:**
The company sold 250 Type A widgets and 250 Type B widgets.
