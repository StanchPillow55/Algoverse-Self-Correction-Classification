==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample math problem 152" refers to. Since the problem itself isn't provided, I'll create a hypothetical math problem labeled as "Sample math problem 152" and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**

Sample math problem 152: Solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 3x^2 - 12x + 9 = 0 \).

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Identify the type of equation:**
   The given equation \( 3x^2 - 12x + 9 = 0 \) is a quadratic equation in the standard form \( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \), where \( a = 3 \), \( b = -12 \), and \( c = 9 \).

2. **Simplify the equation:**
   First, check if the equation can be simplified by dividing all terms by the greatest common factor. Here, all coefficients are divisible by 3.

   \[
   \frac{3x^2}{3} - \frac{12x}{3} + \frac{9}{3} = 0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad x^2 - 4x + 3 = 0
   \]

3. **Factor the quadratic equation:**
   Next, we attempt to factor the simplified equation \( x^2 - 4x + 3 = 0 \).

   We look for two numbers whose product is \( c = 3 \) and whose sum is \( b = -4 \). These numbers are \(-1\) and \(-3\).

   \[
   x^2 - 4x + 3 = (x - 1)(x - 3) = 0
   \]

4. **Solve for \( x \):**
   Set each factor equal to zero and solve for \( x \).

   \[
   x - 1 = 0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad x = 1
   \]

   \[
   x - 3 = 0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad x = 3
   \]

5. **Verify the solutions:**
   Substitute \( x = 1 \) and \( x = 3 \) back into the original equation to ensure they satisfy it.

   For \( x = 1 \):
   \[
   3(1)^2 - 12(1) + 9 = 3 - 12 + 9 = 0
   \]

   For \( x = 3 \):
   \[
   3(3)^2 - 12(3) + 9 = 27 - 36 + 9 = 0
   \]

   Both solutions satisfy the original equation.

**Final Answer:**

The solutions to the equation \( 3x^2 - 12x + 9 = 0 \) are \( x = 1 \) and \( x = 3 \).
