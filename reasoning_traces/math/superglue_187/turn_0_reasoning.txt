To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 187" entails. Since the problem statement is not specific, I'll assume it's a generic math problem that requires logical reasoning and problem-solving skills. Let's create a hypothetical math problem and solve it step-by-step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**

A train travels from City A to City B, a distance of 300 miles. The train travels at a constant speed of 60 miles per hour. After reaching City B, the train immediately returns to City A at a speed of 40 miles per hour. What is the total time taken for the round trip?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - The train travels from City A to City B and back to City A.
   - The distance from City A to City B is 300 miles.
   - The speed from City A to City B is 60 miles per hour.
   - The speed from City B back to City A is 40 miles per hour.
   - We need to find the total time taken for the entire journey.

2. **Calculate the Time from City A to City B:**
   - Use the formula: \(\text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}}\).
   - Distance from City A to City B = 300 miles.
   - Speed from City A to City B = 60 miles per hour.
   - Time taken from City A to City B = \(\frac{300 \text{ miles}}{60 \text{ miles per hour}} = 5 \text{ hours}\).

3. **Calculate the Time from City B to City A:**
   - Distance from City B to City A = 300 miles (same as the distance from City A to City B).
   - Speed from City B to City A = 40 miles per hour.
   - Time taken from City B to City A = \(\frac{300 \text{ miles}}{40 \text{ miles per hour}} = 7.5 \text{ hours}\).

4. **Calculate the Total Time for the Round Trip:**
   - Total time = Time from City A to City B + Time from City B to City A.
   - Total time = 5 hours + 7.5 hours = 12.5 hours.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The total time taken for the round trip is 12.5 hours.

**Final Answer:**
The total time taken for the round trip is 12.5 hours.
