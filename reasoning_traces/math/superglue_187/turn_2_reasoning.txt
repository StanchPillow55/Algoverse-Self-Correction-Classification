Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to first understand what the question is asking. However, the question provided is "Sample reasoning question 187," which doesn't give us any specific mathematical problem to solve. Therefore, I will demonstrate a general approach to solving a typical math problem by creating a sample problem and solving it step by step.

**Sample Problem:**
Calculate the area of a triangle with a base of 10 units and a height of 5 units.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Formula:**
   The formula for the area of a triangle is:
   \[
   \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height}
   \]

2. **Identify the Given Values:**
   - Base (\(b\)) = 10 units
   - Height (\(h\)) = 5 units

3. **Substitute the Values into the Formula:**
   \[
   \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times 10 \times 5
   \]

4. **Perform the Multiplication:**
   First, multiply the base and the height:
   \[
   10 \times 5 = 50
   \]

5. **Calculate the Area:**
   Now, multiply the result by \(\frac{1}{2}\):
   \[
   \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times 50 = 25
   \]

6. **State the Final Answer:**
   The area of the triangle is 25 square units.

By following these steps, we have calculated the area of the triangle. This process involves understanding the problem, identifying the necessary formula, substituting the given values, performing the calculations, and stating the final answer. If you have a specific problem or question in mind, please provide more details, and I will be happy to help solve it.
