==================================================

To solve the problem, we first need to understand the context and details of "Sample reasoning question 187." Since the problem statement is not provided, I'll walk through a general approach to tackling reasoning questions, which often involve logical deduction, pattern recognition, or mathematical calculations.

### Step-by-Step Approach:

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - Carefully read the problem statement.
   - Identify what is being asked.
   - Note any given data or conditions.

2. **Identify the Type of Problem:**
   - Determine if it involves arithmetic, algebra, geometry, logic, or another area of mathematics.
   - Look for keywords that indicate specific operations or concepts.

3. **Plan a Strategy:**
   - Decide on a method to solve the problem based on its type.
   - Consider drawing diagrams, creating equations, or listing possibilities.

4. **Execute the Plan:**
   - Carry out calculations or logical deductions step by step.
   - Keep track of your work to avoid errors.

5. **Check Your Work:**
   - Review each step to ensure accuracy.
   - Verify that your solution satisfies all conditions of the problem.

6. **State the Final Answer:**
   - Clearly present your final answer, ensuring it addresses the question.

### Example Problem (Hypothetical):

**Problem Statement:**
A farmer has 100 meters of fencing and wants to enclose a rectangular area. What dimensions should the rectangle have to maximize the enclosed area?

**Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We need to maximize the area of a rectangle with a fixed perimeter of 100 meters.

2. **Identify the Type of Problem:**
   - This is an optimization problem involving geometry.

3. **Plan a Strategy:**
   - Use the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle: \( P = 2l + 2w = 100 \).
   - Use the formula for the area of a rectangle: \( A = l \times w \).
   - Express one variable in terms of the other using the perimeter equation.

4. **Execute the Plan:**
   - From \( 2l + 2w = 100 \), simplify to \( l + w = 50 \).
   - Express \( w \) in terms of \( l \): \( w = 50 - l \).
   - Substitute into the area formula: \( A = l \times (50 - l) = 50l - l^2 \).
   - This is a quadratic equation in the form \( A = -l^2 + 50l \).

5. **Maximize the Area:**
   - The maximum area for a quadratic equation \( ax^2 + bx + c \) occurs at \( x = -\frac{b}{2a} \).
   - Here, \( a = -1 \) and \( b = 50 \), so \( l = -\frac{50}{2(-1)} = 25 \).
   - Substitute back to find \( w \): \( w = 50 - 25 = 25 \).

6. **Check Your Work:**
   - The perimeter is \( 2(25) + 2(25) = 100 \), which is correct.
   - The area is \( 25 \times 25 = 625 \).

7. **State the Final Answer:**
   - The dimensions that maximize the area are 25 meters by 25 meters, forming a square.

This approach can be adapted to solve various types of reasoning and mathematical problems. If you have a specific problem statement, please provide it for a tailored solution.
