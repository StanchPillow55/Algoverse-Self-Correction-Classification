==================================================

To solve the problem effectively, I need to understand the context and details of "Sample reasoning question 17." Since the problem statement is not provided, I'll demonstrate a general approach to solving a reasoning-based math problem. This will include logical steps and calculations that one might use in a typical math reasoning question.

### General Approach to Solving a Math Reasoning Problem

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - Carefully read the problem statement.
   - Identify what is being asked.
   - Note any given data or conditions.

2. **Devise a Plan:**
   - Determine the mathematical concepts involved (e.g., algebra, geometry, probability).
   - Consider possible strategies (e.g., drawing a diagram, creating an equation).

3. **Carry Out the Plan:**
   - Execute the chosen strategy step by step.
   - Perform calculations carefully.
   - Keep track of units and ensure consistency.

4. **Check Your Work:**
   - Review each step for accuracy.
   - Verify that the solution meets all conditions of the problem.
   - Consider alternative methods to confirm the result.

5. **State the Final Answer:**
   - Clearly present the solution.
   - Include units if applicable.

### Example Problem and Solution

**Example Problem:**
A rectangle has a length that is twice its width. If the perimeter of the rectangle is 36 units, find the dimensions of the rectangle.

**Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We need to find the length and width of the rectangle.
   - The length is twice the width.
   - The perimeter is 36 units.

2. **Devise a Plan:**
   - Use the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle: \( P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width}) \).
   - Let the width be \( w \) and the length be \( 2w \).

3. **Carry Out the Plan:**
   - Substitute the expressions for length and width into the perimeter formula:
     \[
     36 = 2 \times (2w + w)
     \]
   - Simplify the equation:
     \[
     36 = 2 \times 3w
     \]
     \[
     36 = 6w
     \]
   - Solve for \( w \):
     \[
     w = \frac{36}{6} = 6
     \]
   - Find the length:
     \[
     \text{Length} = 2w = 2 \times 6 = 12
     \]

4. **Check Your Work:**
   - Verify the perimeter with the found dimensions:
     \[
     P = 2 \times (12 + 6) = 2 \times 18 = 36
     \]
   - The calculations are consistent with the given perimeter.

5. **State the Final Answer:**
   - The width of the rectangle is 6 units, and the length is 12 units.

This structured approach can be applied to a wide range of math reasoning problems. If you have a specific problem or additional details about "Sample reasoning question 17," please provide them, and I can offer a more tailored solution.
