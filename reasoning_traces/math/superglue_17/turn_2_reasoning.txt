==================================================

To solve the problem effectively, I need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 17" refers to. Since I don't have access to external databases or specific documents, I'll assume this is a hypothetical math problem. Without specific details, I'll create a sample math problem and solve it step-by-step.

**Sample Problem:**

A company produces two types of products, A and B. The profit from each unit of product A is $3, and the profit from each unit of product B is $5. The company can produce a maximum of 100 units of product A and 80 units of product B per week. However, due to resource constraints, the total production of both products cannot exceed 150 units per week. How many units of each product should the company produce to maximize profit?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( x \) be the number of units of product A produced.
   - Let \( y \) be the number of units of product B produced.

2. **Objective Function:**
   - The profit function \( P \) to be maximized is given by:
     \[
     P = 3x + 5y
     \]

3. **Constraints:**
   - The production constraints are:
     \[
     x \leq 100
     \]
     \[
     y \leq 80
     \]
     \[
     x + y \leq 150
     \]
   - Additionally, \( x \) and \( y \) must be non-negative:
     \[
     x \geq 0
     \]
     \[
     y \geq 0
     \]

4. **Graphical Solution Method:**
   - Plot the constraints on a graph with \( x \) on the horizontal axis and \( y \) on the vertical axis.
   - The feasible region is the area where all constraints overlap.

5. **Identify Corner Points:**
   - The corner points of the feasible region are where the lines intersect:
     - \( (0, 0) \)
     - \( (100, 0) \)
     - \( (70, 80) \) (intersection of \( x + y = 150 \) and \( y = 80 \))
     - \( (100, 50) \) (intersection of \( x = 100 \) and \( x + y = 150 \))

6. **Evaluate the Objective Function at Each Corner Point:**
   - \( P(0, 0) = 3(0) + 5(0) = 0 \)
   - \( P(100, 0) = 3(100) + 5(0) = 300 \)
   - \( P(70, 80) = 3(70) + 5(80) = 210 + 400 = 610 \)
   - \( P(100, 50) = 3(100) + 5(50) = 300 + 250 = 550 \)

7. **Determine the Maximum Profit:**
   - The maximum profit of 610 occurs at the point \( (70, 80) \).

**Final Answer:**
To maximize profit, the company should produce 70 units of product A and 80 units of product B, resulting in a maximum profit of $610.
