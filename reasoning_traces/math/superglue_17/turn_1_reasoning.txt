==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 17" entails. Since the problem statement is vague and doesn't provide specific details, I'll assume it's a hypothetical math problem that requires logical reasoning and problem-solving skills. 

Let's create a sample problem and solve it step-by-step:

**Sample Problem:**

A train travels from City A to City B, a distance of 300 miles. The train travels at a constant speed of 60 miles per hour. After reaching City B, the train takes a 30-minute break and then returns to City A at a speed of 50 miles per hour. Calculate the total time taken for the entire journey, including the break.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Calculate the time taken to travel from City A to City B:**

   - Distance from City A to City B = 300 miles
   - Speed of the train = 60 miles per hour

   \[
   \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{300 \text{ miles}}{60 \text{ miles per hour}} = 5 \text{ hours}
   \]

2. **Calculate the break time at City B:**

   - Break time = 30 minutes = 0.5 hours

3. **Calculate the time taken to travel from City B back to City A:**

   - Distance from City B to City A = 300 miles
   - Speed of the train = 50 miles per hour

   \[
   \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{300 \text{ miles}}{50 \text{ miles per hour}} = 6 \text{ hours}
   \]

4. **Calculate the total time for the entire journey:**

   - Time from City A to City B = 5 hours
   - Break time at City B = 0.5 hours
   - Time from City B to City A = 6 hours

   \[
   \text{Total time} = 5 \text{ hours} + 0.5 \text{ hours} + 6 \text{ hours} = 11.5 \text{ hours}
   \]

**Final Answer:**

The total time taken for the entire journey, including the break, is 11.5 hours.
