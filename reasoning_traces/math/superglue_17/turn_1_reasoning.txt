==================================================

To solve the problem effectively, I need to understand the context and details of "Sample reasoning question 17." However, since the question itself is not provided, I'll demonstrate a general approach to solving a typical math reasoning problem. Let's assume a sample problem and work through it step by step.

**Sample Problem:**
A train travels from City A to City B at a speed of 60 miles per hour. After reaching City B, it immediately returns to City A at a speed of 40 miles per hour. If the total travel time for the round trip is 5 hours, what is the distance between City A and City B?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( d \) be the distance between City A and City B in miles.

2. **Determine Time for Each Leg of the Trip:**
   - Time taken to travel from City A to City B at 60 mph is \( \frac{d}{60} \) hours.
   - Time taken to travel from City B to City A at 40 mph is \( \frac{d}{40} \) hours.

3. **Set Up the Equation for Total Time:**
   - The total travel time for the round trip is given as 5 hours.
   - Therefore, the equation is:
     \[
     \frac{d}{60} + \frac{d}{40} = 5
     \]

4. **Solve the Equation:**
   - Find a common denominator for the fractions, which is 120.
   - Rewrite the equation:
     \[
     \frac{2d}{120} + \frac{3d}{120} = 5
     \]
   - Combine the fractions:
     \[
     \frac{5d}{120} = 5
     \]
   - Simplify the equation by multiplying both sides by 120:
     \[
     5d = 600
     \]
   - Divide both sides by 5 to solve for \( d \):
     \[
     d = 120
     \]

5. **Verify the Solution:**
   - Calculate the time for each leg of the trip with \( d = 120 \) miles:
     - Time from City A to City B: \( \frac{120}{60} = 2 \) hours.
     - Time from City B to City A: \( \frac{120}{40} = 3 \) hours.
   - Total time: \( 2 + 3 = 5 \) hours, which matches the given total travel time.

**Final Answer:**
The distance between City A and City B is 120 miles.
