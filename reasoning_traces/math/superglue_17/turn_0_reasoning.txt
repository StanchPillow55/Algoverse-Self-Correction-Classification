==================================================

To solve the problem, I need more specific information about "Sample reasoning question 17." Since the question is not provided, I'll demonstrate how to approach a typical math reasoning problem step by step. Let's assume a sample problem:

**Sample Problem:**
A train travels from City A to City B at a speed of 60 miles per hour. It then returns from City B to City A at a speed of 40 miles per hour. The total travel time for the round trip is 5 hours. What is the distance between City A and City B?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( d \) be the distance between City A and City B in miles.

2. **Understand the Problem:**
   - The train travels from City A to City B at 60 mph and returns at 40 mph.
   - The total travel time for the round trip is 5 hours.

3. **Set Up Equations:**
   - Time taken to travel from City A to City B is \( \frac{d}{60} \) hours.
   - Time taken to travel from City B to City A is \( \frac{d}{40} \) hours.
   - The total travel time is the sum of these two times, which equals 5 hours.

4. **Equation for Total Time:**
   \[
   \frac{d}{60} + \frac{d}{40} = 5
   \]

5. **Solve the Equation:**
   - To solve for \( d \), first find a common denominator for the fractions, which is 120.
   - Rewrite the equation:
     \[
     \frac{2d}{120} + \frac{3d}{120} = 5
     \]
   - Combine the fractions:
     \[
     \frac{5d}{120} = 5
     \]
   - Simplify the equation:
     \[
     5d = 5 \times 120
     \]
     \[
     5d = 600
     \]
   - Divide both sides by 5:
     \[
     d = \frac{600}{5}
     \]
     \[
     d = 120
     \]

6. **Conclusion:**
   - The distance between City A and City B is 120 miles.

**Final Answer:**
The distance between City A and City B is 120 miles.
