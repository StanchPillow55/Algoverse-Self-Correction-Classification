==================================================

It seems like the problem statement is incomplete or unclear. "Sample reasoning question 17" doesn't provide enough information for me to solve a specific math problem. However, I can guide you through a general approach to solving math problems by using logical reasoning and step-by-step calculations. If you have a specific math problem in mind, please provide the details, and I'll be happy to help.

Here's a general approach to solving math problems:

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - Read the problem carefully.
   - Identify what is being asked.
   - Determine what information is given and what is unknown.

2. **Devise a Plan:**
   - Think about the strategies you can use to solve the problem. This could include drawing a diagram, creating an equation, or breaking the problem into smaller parts.

3. **Carry Out the Plan:**
   - Execute the steps you have planned.
   - Perform calculations carefully.
   - Keep track of units and ensure consistency.

4. **Check Your Work:**
   - Review each step to ensure there are no errors.
   - Verify that your solution makes sense in the context of the problem.
   - Consider whether there might be another method to solve the problem and compare results.

5. **State the Final Answer:**
   - Clearly present your final answer, including units if applicable.

If you provide a specific problem, I can apply this approach to give you a detailed solution.
