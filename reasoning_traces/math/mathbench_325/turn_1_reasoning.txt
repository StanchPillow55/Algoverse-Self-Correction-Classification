==================================================

To solve the problem, we first need to understand what "Sample math problem 325" refers to. Since this is not a standard problem description, I'll assume it's a placeholder for a typical math problem. Let's create a hypothetical problem based on the number 325 and solve it.

**Hypothetical Problem:**

"Find the prime factorization of the number 325."

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   We need to express the number 325 as a product of prime numbers.

2. **Check for Divisibility:**
   - First, check if 325 is divisible by the smallest prime number, 2. Since 325 is odd, it is not divisible by 2.
   - Next, check for divisibility by 3. The sum of the digits of 325 is \(3 + 2 + 5 = 10\), which is not divisible by 3. Therefore, 325 is not divisible by 3.
   - Check for divisibility by 5. The last digit of 325 is 5, which means it is divisible by 5.

3. **Divide by 5:**
   \[
   325 \div 5 = 65
   \]
   So, 325 can be expressed as \(5 \times 65\).

4. **Factor 65:**
   - Check if 65 is divisible by 5. Since the last digit is 5, it is divisible by 5.
   \[
   65 \div 5 = 13
   \]
   So, 65 can be expressed as \(5 \times 13\).

5. **Check if 13 is Prime:**
   The number 13 is a prime number because it has no divisors other than 1 and itself.

6. **Combine the Factors:**
   Now, we have the complete prime factorization of 325:
   \[
   325 = 5 \times 5 \times 13
   \]
   Or, using exponents:
   \[
   325 = 5^2 \times 13
   \]

**Final Answer:**

The prime factorization of 325 is \(5^2 \times 13\).
