==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample math problem 325" refers to. Since the problem is not explicitly stated, I'll assume it's a generic math problem that we can solve. Let's create a hypothetical math problem and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**

"Calculate the sum of all even numbers between 1 and 325."

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Identify the Range of Even Numbers:**
   - The even numbers between 1 and 325 start from 2 and go up to 324.

2. **Determine the Sequence of Even Numbers:**
   - The sequence of even numbers can be represented as: 2, 4, 6, ..., 324.

3. **Identify the Pattern:**
   - This is an arithmetic sequence where the first term \( a_1 = 2 \) and the common difference \( d = 2 \).

4. **Find the Number of Terms (n):**
   - The formula for the \( n \)-th term of an arithmetic sequence is given by:
     \[
     a_n = a_1 + (n-1) \cdot d
     \]
   - Setting \( a_n = 324 \), we solve for \( n \):
     \[
     324 = 2 + (n-1) \cdot 2
     \]
     \[
     324 = 2 + 2n - 2
     \]
     \[
     324 = 2n
     \]
     \[
     n = \frac{324}{2} = 162
     \]

5. **Calculate the Sum of the Sequence:**
   - The sum \( S_n \) of the first \( n \) terms of an arithmetic sequence is given by:
     \[
     S_n = \frac{n}{2} \cdot (a_1 + a_n)
     \]
   - Substituting the known values:
     \[
     S_{162} = \frac{162}{2} \cdot (2 + 324)
     \]
     \[
     S_{162} = 81 \cdot 326
     \]

6. **Perform the Multiplication:**
   - Calculate \( 81 \times 326 \):
     \[
     81 \times 326 = 81 \times (300 + 26) = 81 \times 300 + 81 \times 26
     \]
     \[
     81 \times 300 = 24300
     \]
     \[
     81 \times 26 = 81 \times (20 + 6) = 81 \times 20 + 81 \times 6
     \]
     \[
     81 \times 20 = 1620
     \]
     \[
     81 \times 6 = 486
     \]
     \[
     81 \times 26 = 1620 + 486 = 2106
     \]
     \[
     81 \times 326 = 24300 + 2106 = 26406
     \]

**Final Answer:**

The sum of all even numbers between 1 and 325 is \( \boxed{26406} \).
