Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 325," we need to first understand what the problem is asking. Since the problem is not explicitly stated, I'll assume it's a generic math problem involving the number 325. Let's consider a few possible interpretations and solve them step by step.

### Interpretation 1: Prime Factorization of 325

**Step 1: Check divisibility by 2.**
- 325 is an odd number, so it is not divisible by 2.

**Step 2: Check divisibility by 3.**
- Sum of the digits of 325 is \(3 + 2 + 5 = 10\).
- 10 is not divisible by 3, so 325 is not divisible by 3.

**Step 3: Check divisibility by 5.**
- The last digit of 325 is 5, so it is divisible by 5.
- \(325 \div 5 = 65\).

**Step 4: Factor 65.**
- 65 ends in 5, so it is divisible by 5.
- \(65 \div 5 = 13\).

**Step 5: Check if 13 is a prime number.**
- 13 is a prime number.

**Conclusion:**
- The prime factorization of 325 is \(5^2 \times 13\).

### Interpretation 2: Solve for x in the equation \(x + 325 = 0\)

**Step 1: Isolate x.**
- Subtract 325 from both sides of the equation:
  \[
  x + 325 - 325 = 0 - 325
  \]
  \[
  x = -325
  \]

**Conclusion:**
- The solution to the equation \(x + 325 = 0\) is \(x = -325\).

### Interpretation 3: Calculate the square root of 325

**Step 1: Estimate the square root.**
- \(18^2 = 324\) and \(19^2 = 361\).
- Therefore, \(\sqrt{325}\) is between 18 and 19.

**Step 2: Use a calculator for precision.**
- \(\sqrt{325} \approx 18.03\).

**Conclusion:**
- The square root of 325 is approximately 18.03.

### Final Answer

Since the problem "Sample math problem 325" is ambiguous, I've provided solutions for three possible interpretations:

1. Prime factorization of 325: \(5^2 \times 13\).
2. Solution to \(x + 325 = 0\): \(x = -325\).
3. Square root of 325: approximately 18.03.

If you have a specific problem involving 325, please provide more details for a precise solution.
