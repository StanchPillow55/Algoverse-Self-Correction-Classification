==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to first understand what "Sample math problem 325" refers to. Since the problem statement is not provided, I'll assume this is a placeholder for a typical math problem. Let's create a sample problem and solve it step by step.

**Sample Math Problem 325:**

Let's assume the problem is as follows:

"A car travels at a constant speed of 65 miles per hour. How long will it take the car to travel 325 miles?"

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We need to find the time it takes for a car to travel a certain distance at a constant speed.
   - Given:
     - Speed of the car = 65 miles per hour
     - Distance to be traveled = 325 miles

2. **Identify the Formula:**
   - The formula to find time when speed and distance are known is:
     \[
     \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}}
     \]

3. **Substitute the Given Values:**
   - Substitute the given values into the formula:
     \[
     \text{Time} = \frac{325 \text{ miles}}{65 \text{ miles per hour}}
     \]

4. **Perform the Calculation:**
   - Divide 325 by 65 to find the time:
     \[
     \text{Time} = \frac{325}{65} = 5 \text{ hours}
     \]

5. **Verify the Calculation:**
   - To ensure the calculation is correct, multiply the time by the speed to check if it equals the distance:
     \[
     5 \text{ hours} \times 65 \text{ miles per hour} = 325 \text{ miles}
     \]
   - The calculation is verified as correct.

6. **State the Final Answer:**
   - The car will take 5 hours to travel 325 miles at a constant speed of 65 miles per hour.

Therefore, the final answer is:

**5 hours**
