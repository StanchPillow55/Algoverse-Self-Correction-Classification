Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To find the total cost of Bill's new truck, we will calculate the cost of each feature and then sum them up with the base price.

1. **Base Price of the Truck**: 
   \[
   \text{Base Price} = 30,000 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Cost of the King Cab Upgrade**: 
   \[
   \text{King Cab Upgrade} = 7,500 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Cost of Leather Seats**: 
   The cost of leather seats is one-third the cost of the king cab upgrade:
   \[
   \text{Leather Seats} = \frac{1}{3} \times 7,500 = 2,500 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Cost of Running Boards**: 
   The cost of running boards is $500 less than the cost of leather seats:
   \[
   \text{Running Boards} = 2,500 - 500 = 2,000 \text{ dollars}
   \]

5. **Cost of Upgraded Exterior Light Package**: 
   \[
   \text{Upgraded Exterior Light Package} = 1,500 \text{ dollars}
   \]

6. **Total Cost Calculation**: 
   Now, we will sum all the costs:
   \[
   \text{Total Cost} = \text{Base Price} + \text{King Cab Upgrade} + \text{Leather Seats} + \text{Running Boards} + \text{Upgraded Exterior Light Package}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total Cost} = 30,000 + 7,500 + 2,500 + 2,000 + 1,500
   \]

   Let's calculate this step-by-step:
   - First, add the base price and the king cab upgrade:
     \[
     30,000 + 7,500 = 37,500
     \]
   - Next, add the leather seats:
     \[
     37,500 + 2,500 = 40,000
     \]
   - Then, add the running boards:
     \[
     40,000 + 2,000 = 42,000
     \]
   - Finally, add the upgraded exterior light package:
     \[
     42,000 + 1,500 = 43,500
     \]

Thus, the total cost of Bill's new truck is:
\[
\boxed{43,500} \text{ dollars}
\]
