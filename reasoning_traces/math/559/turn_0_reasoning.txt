==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to determine how much coffee Juan currently drinks and then find out how much he needs to reduce his intake to meet the doctor's recommendation.

1. **Determine Octavia's coffee intake:**
   - Let \( R \) be the daily recommended amount of coffee in cups.
   - According to the problem, Octavia drinks half of the daily recommended amount:
     \[
     \text{Octavia's coffee intake} = \frac{R}{2}
     \]

2. **Determine Juan's coffee intake:**
   - Juan drinks 10 times the amount of coffee that Octavia drinks:
     \[
     \text{Juan's coffee intake} = 10 \times \left(\frac{R}{2}\right) = 5R
     \]

3. **Determine the recommended coffee intake for Juan:**
   - Juan's doctor has recommended that he reduces his coffee intake to 4 cups:
     \[
     \text{Recommended coffee intake for Juan} = 4 \text{ cups}
     \]

4. **Calculate how much Juan needs to reduce his coffee intake:**
   - We need to find the difference between Juan's current intake and the recommended intake:
     \[
     \text{Reduction needed} = \text{Juan's current intake} - \text{Recommended intake}
     \]
   - Substituting the values we have:
     \[
     \text{Reduction needed} = 5R - 4
     \]

5. **Determine the value of \( R \):**
   - Since we do not have a specific value for \( R \), we can express the reduction in terms of \( R \). However, we can analyze the situation further:
   - If we assume \( R \) is the daily recommended amount of coffee, we can find the reduction needed for any value of \( R \).

6. **Final Calculation:**
   - To find out how much Juan needs to reduce his coffee intake, we can express it as:
     \[
     \text{Reduction needed} = 5R - 4
     \]
   - If we want to find the specific reduction for \( R = 4 \) (the recommended amount), we can substitute:
     \[
     \text{Reduction needed} = 5(4) - 4 = 20 - 4 = 16 \text{ cups}
     \]

Thus, Juan must reduce his daily coffee intake by \( 16 \) cups to meet the doctor's recommendation.

**Final Answer:**
Juan must reduce his daily coffee intake by \( 16 \) cups.
