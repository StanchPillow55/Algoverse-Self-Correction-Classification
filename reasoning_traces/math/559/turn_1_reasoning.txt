Question ID: 559
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to determine how much coffee Juan currently drinks and how much he needs to reduce that amount to meet the doctor's recommendation.

1. **Determine Octavia's coffee intake**:
   - Let \( R \) be the daily recommended cups of coffee. According to the problem, Octavia drinks half of this amount.
   - Therefore, Octavia's coffee intake is:
     \[
     \text{Octavia's intake} = \frac{R}{2}
     \]

2. **Determine Juan's coffee intake**:
   - Juan drinks 10 times the amount of coffee that Octavia drinks. Thus, Juan's coffee intake is:
     \[
     \text{Juan's intake} = 10 \times \text{Octavia's intake} = 10 \times \frac{R}{2} = 5R
     \]

3. **Determine the reduction needed**:
   - Juan's doctor has recommended that he reduce his coffee intake to 4 cups. Therefore, we need to find out how much Juan needs to reduce his intake from \( 5R \) to 4 cups.
   - The amount Juan needs to reduce is given by:
     \[
     \text{Reduction} = \text{Juan's intake} - \text{Recommended intake} = 5R - 4
     \]

4. **Find the value of \( R \)**:
   - We know from the problem statement that the recommended daily intake is 4 cups. Thus, we can set \( R = 4 \).
   - Substituting \( R \) into the equation for Juan's intake:
     \[
     \text{Juan's intake} = 5R = 5 \times 4 = 20 \text{ cups}
     \]

5. **Calculate the reduction**:
   - Now we can calculate how much Juan needs to reduce his intake:
     \[
     \text{Reduction} = 20 - 4 = 16 \text{ cups}
     \]

Thus, Juan must reduce his daily coffee intake by **16 cups**.

Final answer:
\[
\boxed{16}
\]
