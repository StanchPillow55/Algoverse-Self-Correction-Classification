To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the total number of students**:  
   The total enrollment at Brook Hills High School is given as 3000 students.

2. **Calculate the number of students over 16 years old**:  
   According to the problem, half of the students are over 16 years old.  
   \[
   \text{Students over 16} = \frac{3000}{2} = 1500
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of male students over 16 years old**:  
   One-fourth of the students over 16 years old are male.  
   \[
   \text{Male students over 16} = \frac{1500}{4} = 375
   \]

4. **Calculate the number of female students over 16 years old**:  
   To find the number of female students over 16, we subtract the number of male students over 16 from the total number of students over 16.  
   \[
   \text{Female students over 16} = 1500 - 375 = 1125
   \]

5. **Calculate the number of students under 16 years old**:  
   The remaining half of the students are under 16 years old.  
   \[
   \text{Students under 16} = \frac{3000}{2} = 1500
   \]

6. **Calculate the number of male students under 16 years old**:  
   One-half of the students under 16 are male.  
   \[
   \text{Male students under 16} = \frac{1500}{2} = 750
   \]

7. **Calculate the number of female students under 16 years old**:  
   To find the number of female students under 16, we subtract the number of male students under 16 from the total number of students under 16.  
   \[
   \text{Female students under 16} = 1500 - 750 = 750
   \]

8. **Calculate the total number of female students**:  
   Now, we add the number of female students over 16 and under 16 to find the total number of female students enrolled at the school.  
   \[
   \text{Total female students} = \text{Female students over 16} + \text{Female students under 16} = 1125 + 750 = 1875
   \]

Thus, the total number of female students enrolled at Brook Hills High School is \( \boxed{1875} \).
