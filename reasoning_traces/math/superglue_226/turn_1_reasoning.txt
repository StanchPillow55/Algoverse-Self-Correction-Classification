==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 226" entails. However, since the problem statement is not provided, I'll demonstrate a general approach to solving a typical math problem by creating a hypothetical example. Let's assume the problem is as follows:

**Problem:**
Calculate the sum of all even numbers between 1 and 100.

**Step-by-step Solution:**

1. **Identify the Sequence of Even Numbers:**
   - Even numbers between 1 and 100 are: 2, 4, 6, ..., 100.
   - This is an arithmetic sequence where the first term \( a_1 = 2 \) and the common difference \( d = 2 \).

2. **Determine the Number of Terms (n):**
   - The general formula for the \( n \)-th term of an arithmetic sequence is:
     \[
     a_n = a_1 + (n-1) \cdot d
     \]
   - We need to find \( n \) such that \( a_n = 100 \):
     \[
     100 = 2 + (n-1) \cdot 2
     \]
     \[
     100 = 2 + 2n - 2
     \]
     \[
     100 = 2n
     \]
     \[
     n = 50
     \]
   - There are 50 even numbers between 1 and 100.

3. **Calculate the Sum of the Sequence:**
   - The sum \( S_n \) of the first \( n \) terms of an arithmetic sequence is given by:
     \[
     S_n = \frac{n}{2} \cdot (a_1 + a_n)
     \]
   - Substitute the known values:
     \[
     S_{50} = \frac{50}{2} \cdot (2 + 100)
     \]
     \[
     S_{50} = 25 \cdot 102
     \]
     \[
     S_{50} = 2550
     \]

**Final Answer:**
The sum of all even numbers between 1 and 100 is 2550.

This solution demonstrates a clear, step-by-step approach to solving an arithmetic sequence problem, including identifying the sequence, determining the number of terms, and calculating the sum. If you have a specific problem or need further assistance, please provide more details.
