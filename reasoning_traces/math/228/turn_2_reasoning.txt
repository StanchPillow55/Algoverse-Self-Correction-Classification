Question ID: 228
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the number of employees who drive to work:**
   The company has a total of 200 employees, and 60% of them drive to work. We can calculate the number of employees who drive as follows:

   \[
   \text{Number of employees who drive} = 60\% \times 200
   \]

   Converting 60% to a decimal gives us 0.60. Now we can calculate:

   \[
   \text{Number of employees who drive} = 0.60 \times 200 = 120
   \]

   So, 120 employees drive to work.

2. **Determine the number of employees who do not drive to work:**
   To find out how many employees do not drive, we subtract the number of employees who drive from the total number of employees:

   \[
   \text{Number of employees who do not drive} = 200 - 120 = 80
   \]

   Therefore, 80 employees do not drive to work.

3. **Determine how many of the non-driving employees take public transportation:**
   According to the problem, half of the employees who do not drive take public transportation. We can calculate this as follows:

   \[
   \text{Number of employees who take public transportation} = \frac{1}{2} \times 80
   \]

   Performing the calculation gives us:

   \[
   \text{Number of employees who take public transportation} = 40
   \]

4. **Calculate how many more employees drive to work than take public transportation:**
   Now we need to find the difference between the number of employees who drive and those who take public transportation:

   \[
   \text{Difference} = \text{Number of employees who drive} - \text{Number of employees who take public transportation}
   \]

   Substituting the values we found:

   \[
   \text{Difference} = 120 - 40 = 80
   \]

5. **Final answer:**
   Therefore, the number of more employees who drive to work than take public transportation is:

   \[
   \boxed{80}
   \]
