To solve this problem, we need to determine how many employees drive to work and how many take public transportation. We will then find the difference between these two numbers.

**Step 1: Calculate the number of employees who drive to work.**

We know that 60% of the employees drive to work. The company has a total of 200 employees.

\[
\text{Number of employees who drive to work} = 60\% \times 200
\]

Convert the percentage to a decimal:

\[
60\% = 0.60
\]

Now, calculate the number of employees who drive:

\[
0.60 \times 200 = 120
\]

So, 120 employees drive to work.

**Step 2: Calculate the number of employees who do not drive to work.**

Since 60% of the employees drive to work, the remaining percentage of employees do not drive:

\[
100\% - 60\% = 40\%
\]

Convert this percentage to a decimal:

\[
40\% = 0.40
\]

Calculate the number of employees who do not drive:

\[
0.40 \times 200 = 80
\]

So, 80 employees do not drive to work.

**Step 3: Calculate the number of employees who take public transportation.**

We are told that half of the employees who do not drive take public transportation. Therefore, we need to find half of the 80 employees who do not drive:

\[
\text{Number of employees who take public transportation} = \frac{1}{2} \times 80
\]

Calculate this:

\[
\frac{1}{2} \times 80 = 40
\]

So, 40 employees take public transportation.

**Step 4: Calculate how many more employees drive to work than take public transportation.**

We need to find the difference between the number of employees who drive and those who take public transportation:

\[
\text{Difference} = \text{Number of employees who drive} - \text{Number of employees who take public transportation}
\]

Substitute the values we found:

\[
\text{Difference} = 120 - 40 = 80
\]

**Final Answer:**

There are 80 more employees who drive to work than take public transportation.
