To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step.

1. **Calculate the number of employees who drive to work:**
   The company has a total of 200 employees, and 60% of them drive to work.

   \[
   \text{Number of employees who drive} = 60\% \text{ of } 200
   \]

   To calculate 60% of 200, we convert the percentage to a decimal:

   \[
   60\% = \frac{60}{100} = 0.6
   \]

   Now, we multiply:

   \[
   \text{Number of employees who drive} = 0.6 \times 200 = 120
   \]

2. **Calculate the number of employees who do not drive to work:**
   To find the number of employees who do not drive, we subtract the number of employees who drive from the total number of employees:

   \[
   \text{Number of employees who do not drive} = 200 - 120 = 80
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of employees who take public transportation:**
   According to the problem, half of the employees who do not drive take public transportation. Therefore, we calculate half of the 80 employees who do not drive:

   \[
   \text{Number of employees who take public transportation} = \frac{1}{2} \times 80 = 40
   \]

4. **Determine how many more employees drive to work than take public transportation:**
   Now we need to find the difference between the number of employees who drive to work and those who take public transportation:

   \[
   \text{Difference} = \text{Number of employees who drive} - \text{Number of employees who take public transportation}
   \]

   Substituting the values we calculated:

   \[
   \text{Difference} = 120 - 40 = 80
   \]

5. **Final answer:**
   The number of more employees who drive to work than take public transportation is:

   \[
   \boxed{80}
   \]
