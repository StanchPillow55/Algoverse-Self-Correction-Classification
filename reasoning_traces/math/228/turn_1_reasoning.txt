Question ID: 228
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the number of employees who drive to work**:
   - The company has a total of 200 employees.
   - 60% of the employees drive to work.
   - To find the number of employees who drive, we calculate:
     \[
     \text{Number of employees who drive} = 60\% \times 200 = 0.60 \times 200 = 120
     \]

2. **Determine the number of employees who do not drive to work**:
   - To find the number of employees who do not drive, we subtract the number of employees who drive from the total number of employees:
     \[
     \text{Number of employees who do not drive} = 200 - 120 = 80
     \]

3. **Determine how many of the non-driving employees take public transportation**:
   - According to the problem, half of the employees who do not drive take public transportation.
   - Therefore, we calculate:
     \[
     \text{Number of employees who take public transportation} = \frac{1}{2} \times 80 = 40
     \]

4. **Calculate how many more employees drive to work than take public transportation**:
   - We need to find the difference between the number of employees who drive and those who take public transportation:
     \[
     \text{Difference} = \text{Number of employees who drive} - \text{Number of employees who take public transportation} = 120 - 40 = 80
     \]

5. **Final Answer**:
   - The number of employees who drive to work is 80 more than the number of employees who take public transportation.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{80}
\]
