==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 418" refers to. Since the question is not specific, I'll assume it's a generic math problem that involves logical reasoning and calculations. Let's create a hypothetical problem and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**

A company produces two types of widgets: Type A and Type B. The production cost for Type A is $5 per unit, and for Type B, it is $8 per unit. The company sells Type A widgets for $10 each and Type B widgets for $15 each. Last month, the company produced a total of 500 widgets and made a total profit of $2,500. How many of each type of widget did the company produce?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( x \) be the number of Type A widgets produced.
   - Let \( y \) be the number of Type B widgets produced.

2. **Set Up Equations:**
   - Total widgets produced: 
     \[
     x + y = 500
     \]
   - Profit equation:
     - Profit from Type A = Selling price - Cost price = $10 - $5 = $5 per unit.
     - Profit from Type B = Selling price - Cost price = $15 - $8 = $7 per unit.
     - Total profit equation:
     \[
     5x + 7y = 2500
     \]

3. **Solve the System of Equations:**

   We have the following system of equations:
   \[
   \begin{align*}
   x + y &= 500 \quad \text{(Equation 1)} \\
   5x + 7y &= 2500 \quad \text{(Equation 2)}
   \end{align*}
   \]

   - From Equation 1, express \( y \) in terms of \( x \):
     \[
     y = 500 - x
     \]

   - Substitute \( y = 500 - x \) into Equation 2:
     \[
     5x + 7(500 - x) = 2500
     \]

   - Simplify and solve for \( x \):
     \[
     5x + 3500 - 7x = 2500
     \]
     \[
     -2x + 3500 = 2500
     \]
     \[
     -2x = 2500 - 3500
     \]
     \[
     -2x = -1000
     \]
     \[
     x = 500
     \]

   - Substitute \( x = 500 \) back into Equation 1 to find \( y \):
     \[
     500 + y = 500
     \]
     \[
     y = 0
     \]

4. **Conclusion:**

   The company produced 500 Type A widgets and 0 Type B widgets.

**Final Answer:**

The company produced 500 Type A widgets and 0 Type B widgets.
