==================================================

To solve the problem, we need more information about "Sample reasoning question 418." Since the problem statement is not provided, I'll guide you through a generic approach to solving a math problem, which you can apply once you have the specific details of the question.

### Step-by-Step Approach to Solving Math Problems

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - Carefully read the problem statement.
   - Identify what is being asked.
   - Note down any given data or conditions.

2. **Devise a Plan:**
   - Think about the mathematical concepts that might apply (e.g., algebra, geometry, calculus).
   - Consider similar problems you have solved before.
   - Decide on a strategy to tackle the problem (e.g., drawing a diagram, creating an equation).

3. **Carry Out the Plan:**
   - Execute your chosen strategy step by step.
   - Perform calculations carefully.
   - Keep track of units and ensure consistency.

4. **Check Your Work:**
   - Review each step to ensure there are no errors.
   - Verify that your solution makes sense in the context of the problem.
   - If possible, use a different method to confirm your answer.

5. **State the Final Answer:**
   - Clearly write down the final answer.
   - Include units if applicable.

### Example Problem and Solution

Let's apply this approach to a sample problem:

**Problem:** Solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).

**Understanding the Problem:**
- We need to find the value of \( x \) that satisfies the equation.

**Devise a Plan:**
- This is a simple linear equation. We can solve it by isolating \( x \).

**Carry Out the Plan:**
1. Start with the equation: \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).
2. Subtract 3 from both sides to isolate the term with \( x \):
   \[
   2x + 3 - 3 = 11 - 3 \implies 2x = 8
   \]
3. Divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( x \):
   \[
   \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{8}{2} \implies x = 4
   \]

**Check Your Work:**
- Substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation to verify:
  \[
  2(4) + 3 = 8 + 3 = 11
  \]
- The left side equals the right side, confirming our solution is correct.

**State the Final Answer:**
- The solution to the equation is \( x = 4 \).

Once you have the specific details of "Sample reasoning question 418," you can apply this structured approach to find the solution.
