Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, I need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 418" refers to. Since the problem statement doesn't provide specific details or numbers, I'll assume this is a placeholder for a typical math problem. Let's create a hypothetical problem to solve:

**Hypothetical Problem:**

A train travels from City A to City B, a distance of 300 miles. The train travels at a constant speed of 60 miles per hour. How long does it take for the train to reach City B from City A?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We need to find the time it takes for the train to travel from City A to City B.
   - We know the distance between the two cities is 300 miles.
   - The train travels at a constant speed of 60 miles per hour.

2. **Identify the Formula:**
   - The formula to calculate time when distance and speed are known is:
     \[
     \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}}
     \]

3. **Substitute the Known Values:**
   - Distance = 300 miles
   - Speed = 60 miles per hour
   - Substitute these values into the formula:
     \[
     \text{Time} = \frac{300 \text{ miles}}{60 \text{ miles per hour}}
     \]

4. **Perform the Calculation:**
   - Divide 300 by 60:
     \[
     \text{Time} = \frac{300}{60} = 5 \text{ hours}
     \]

5. **Verify the Solution:**
   - To ensure the calculation is correct, consider the units:
     - Miles cancel out, leaving hours as the unit for time, which is correct.
   - Double-check the division: 300 divided by 60 equals 5, confirming the calculation.

6. **State the Final Answer:**
   - The train takes 5 hours to travel from City A to City B.

This completes the solution to the hypothetical problem based on the given structure. If "Sample reasoning question 418" refers to a specific problem, please provide additional details or context for a more accurate solution.
