==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 418" refers to. However, since the problem statement is not provided, I will demonstrate a general approach to solving a reasoning problem by creating a hypothetical example and solving it step-by-step.

Let's assume "Sample reasoning question 418" is a logic puzzle:

**Hypothetical Problem:**
Three friends, Alice, Bob, and Charlie, are sitting in a row. Each of them is wearing a hat that is either red or blue. They cannot see their own hat but can see the hats of the others. Alice says, "I can see two blue hats." Bob says, "I can see one red hat and one blue hat." Charlie says, "I can see two red hats." What color is each person's hat?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Analyze Alice's Statement:**
   - Alice sees two blue hats. This means Bob and Charlie are wearing blue hats.

2. **Analyze Bob's Statement:**
   - Bob sees one red hat and one blue hat. Since Alice sees Bob and Charlie wearing blue hats, Bob must be seeing Alice wearing a red hat and Charlie wearing a blue hat.

3. **Analyze Charlie's Statement:**
   - Charlie sees two red hats. This contradicts the previous statements if we assume Bob and Alice are wearing red hats. Therefore, Charlie's statement must be incorrect or based on a misunderstanding.

4. **Reconcile the Statements:**
   - If Alice sees two blue hats (Bob and Charlie), and Bob sees one red hat (Alice) and one blue hat (Charlie), then Charlie cannot be seeing two red hats. The only consistent scenario is:
     - Alice is wearing a red hat.
     - Bob is wearing a blue hat.
     - Charlie is wearing a blue hat.

5. **Verify the Solution:**
   - Alice sees Bob and Charlie wearing blue hats, which matches her statement.
   - Bob sees Alice wearing a red hat and Charlie wearing a blue hat, which matches his statement.
   - Charlie's statement is incorrect, but this does not affect the solution as it was based on a misunderstanding.

**Final Answer:**
- Alice is wearing a red hat.
- Bob is wearing a blue hat.
- Charlie is wearing a blue hat.

This hypothetical example demonstrates the process of logical reasoning and elimination to solve a problem. If you have a specific problem or context for "Sample reasoning question 418," please provide more details, and I can tailor the solution accordingly.
