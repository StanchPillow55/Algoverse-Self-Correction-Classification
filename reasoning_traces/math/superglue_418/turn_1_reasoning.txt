==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 418" refers to. However, since the problem statement is not explicitly provided, I'll demonstrate a general approach to solving a typical math problem by breaking it down into steps. Let's assume a hypothetical math problem and solve it step-by-step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**
Calculate the area of a right triangle with a base of 8 units and a height of 6 units.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We need to find the area of a right triangle.
   - The formula for the area of a triangle is: 
     \[
     \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height}
     \]

2. **Identify the Given Information:**
   - Base (\(b\)) = 8 units
   - Height (\(h\)) = 6 units

3. **Substitute the Values into the Formula:**
   - Plug the values of the base and height into the area formula:
     \[
     \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times 8 \times 6
     \]

4. **Perform the Calculations:**
   - First, multiply the base and height:
     \[
     8 \times 6 = 48
     \]
   - Then, multiply by \(\frac{1}{2}\):
     \[
     \frac{1}{2} \times 48 = 24
     \]

5. **State the Final Answer:**
   - The area of the right triangle is 24 square units.

By following these steps, we have solved the problem and arrived at the final answer. If you have a specific problem or question in mind, please provide the details, and I can work through that problem using a similar step-by-step approach.
