==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 418" refers to. However, since the problem statement is not clear or specific, I'll assume it's a placeholder for a typical math problem. Let's create a sample math problem and solve it step by step.

**Sample Problem:**

A car travels from City A to City B, a distance of 150 miles, at an average speed of 50 miles per hour. On the return trip, the car travels at an average speed of 60 miles per hour. What is the total time spent traveling?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Calculate the time taken to travel from City A to City B:**

   - Distance from City A to City B = 150 miles
   - Average speed from City A to City B = 50 miles per hour

   Using the formula for time, \( \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \):

   \[
   \text{Time from A to B} = \frac{150 \text{ miles}}{50 \text{ miles per hour}} = 3 \text{ hours}
   \]

2. **Calculate the time taken to travel from City B back to City A:**

   - Distance from City B to City A = 150 miles (same as the distance from A to B)
   - Average speed from City B to City A = 60 miles per hour

   Using the same formula for time:

   \[
   \text{Time from B to A} = \frac{150 \text{ miles}}{60 \text{ miles per hour}} = 2.5 \text{ hours}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total time spent traveling:**

   Add the time taken for both legs of the journey:

   \[
   \text{Total time} = \text{Time from A to B} + \text{Time from B to A} = 3 \text{ hours} + 2.5 \text{ hours} = 5.5 \text{ hours}
   \]

**Final Answer:**

The total time spent traveling is 5.5 hours.
