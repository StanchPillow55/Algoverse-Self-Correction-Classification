==================================================

To solve the sample math problem 441, we need to first understand what the problem is asking. However, the problem statement is incomplete as it only states "Sample math problem 441" without any specific details or question. 

Since there is no specific problem given, let's assume a hypothetical scenario where the number 441 is involved in a mathematical problem. One common type of problem involving numbers like 441 is finding its square root, determining its factors, or checking if it's a perfect square.

Let's explore these possibilities:

### 1. Checking if 441 is a Perfect Square

A perfect square is a number that can be expressed as the square of an integer. To check if 441 is a perfect square, we can try to find its square root.

#### Step 1: Estimate the Square Root
- 441 is close to 400, which is \(20^2\), and 441 is less than 500, which is \(25^2\).
- So, the square root of 441 should be between 20 and 25.

#### Step 2: Calculate the Square Root
- Let's try 21: \(21^2 = 441\).

Since \(21^2 = 441\), 441 is indeed a perfect square, and its square root is 21.

### 2. Finding the Factors of 441

To find the factors of 441, we can perform prime factorization.

#### Step 1: Divide by the Smallest Prime Number
- 441 is odd, so it is not divisible by 2.
- Sum of digits of 441 is \(4 + 4 + 1 = 9\), which is divisible by 3. So, 441 is divisible by 3.

\[ 441 \div 3 = 147 \]

#### Step 2: Continue Factoring 147
- Sum of digits of 147 is \(1 + 4 + 7 = 12\), which is divisible by 3.

\[ 147 \div 3 = 49 \]

#### Step 3: Factor 49
- 49 is \(7^2\).

Thus, the prime factorization of 441 is \(3^2 \times 7^2\).

#### Step 4: List All Factors
- Using the prime factorization \(3^2 \times 7^2\), we can list the factors:
  - \(1, 3, 7, 9, 21, 49, 63, 147, 441\).

### Conclusion

Based on the hypothetical exploration of the number 441, we have determined:
- 441 is a perfect square with a square root of 21.
- The prime factorization of 441 is \(3^2 \times 7^2\).
- The factors of 441 are \(1, 3, 7, 9, 21, 49, 63, 147, 441\).
