==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 441," we need to first understand what the problem is asking. However, the problem statement is not clear from the given text. It seems like "Sample math problem 441" is a placeholder or reference to a specific problem, but without the actual details of the problem, it's impossible to solve it directly.

Let's assume that "Sample math problem 441" refers to a specific type of problem or a problem from a textbook or resource. Since we don't have the actual problem, I'll walk through a hypothetical math problem that could be labeled as "Sample math problem 441." Let's assume it's a problem involving basic algebra, as an example.

**Hypothetical Problem:**
Solve for \( x \) in the equation: 
\[ 2x + 5 = 13 \]

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Equation:**
   The equation given is \( 2x + 5 = 13 \). Our goal is to solve for \( x \).

2. **Isolate the Variable:**
   To solve for \( x \), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We start by eliminating the constant term on the left side, which is 5.

3. **Subtract 5 from Both Sides:**
   \[
   2x + 5 - 5 = 13 - 5
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   2x = 8
   \]

4. **Solve for \( x \):**
   Now, we need to isolate \( x \) by dividing both sides by 2:
   \[
   \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{8}{2}
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   x = 4
   \]

5. **Verify the Solution:**
   Substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation to verify:
   \[
   2(4) + 5 = 13
   \]
   \[
   8 + 5 = 13
   \]
   \[
   13 = 13
   \]
   The left side equals the right side, confirming that our solution is correct.

**Final Answer:**
The solution to the equation \( 2x + 5 = 13 \) is \( x = 4 \).

If "Sample math problem 441" refers to a different problem, please provide the specific details or context of the problem so that I can assist you accurately.
