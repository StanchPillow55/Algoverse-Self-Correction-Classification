==================================================

To solve the problem labeled "Sample math problem 441," we need to first understand what the problem is asking. However, since the problem statement is not provided, I'll assume a generic math problem involving the number 441. Let's explore a few possibilities:

### Possibility 1: Find the Square Root of 441

1. **Understanding the Problem**: We need to find the square root of 441.
2. **Reasoning**: The square root of a number \( x \) is a number \( y \) such that \( y^2 = x \).
3. **Calculation**:
   - We know that \( 20^2 = 400 \) and \( 21^2 = 441 \).
   - Therefore, the square root of 441 is 21.
4. **Verification**: 
   - Calculate \( 21 \times 21 = 441 \).
   - Since the calculation holds true, the square root of 441 is indeed 21.

**Final Answer**: The square root of 441 is 21.

### Possibility 2: Determine if 441 is a Perfect Square

1. **Understanding the Problem**: We need to determine if 441 is a perfect square.
2. **Reasoning**: A perfect square is an integer that is the square of another integer.
3. **Calculation**:
   - From the previous calculation, we found that \( 21^2 = 441 \).
   - Since 21 is an integer, 441 is a perfect square.
4. **Verification**: 
   - Recalculate \( 21 \times 21 = 441 \) to confirm.
   - The calculation confirms that 441 is a perfect square.

**Final Answer**: Yes, 441 is a perfect square.

### Possibility 3: Factor 441 into Prime Factors

1. **Understanding the Problem**: We need to find the prime factorization of 441.
2. **Reasoning**: Prime factorization involves expressing a number as a product of prime numbers.
3. **Calculation**:
   - Start with the smallest prime number, 2. Since 441 is odd, it is not divisible by 2.
   - Check divisibility by 3: The sum of the digits of 441 is \( 4 + 4 + 1 = 9 \), which is divisible by 3.
   - Divide 441 by 3: \( 441 \div 3 = 147 \).
   - Check 147 for divisibility by 3: The sum of the digits of 147 is \( 1 + 4 + 7 = 12 \), which is divisible by 3.
   - Divide 147 by 3: \( 147 \div 3 = 49 \).
   - 49 is \( 7 \times 7 \) or \( 7^2 \).
   - Therefore, the prime factorization of 441 is \( 3^2 \times 7^2 \).
4. **Verification**: 
   - Calculate \( 3^2 \times 7^2 = 9 \times 49 = 441 \).
   - The calculation confirms the prime factorization.

**Final Answer**: The prime factorization of 441 is \( 3^2 \times 7^2 \).

### Conclusion

Without a specific problem statement, I explored three common mathematical tasks involving the number 441: finding its square root, determining if it is a perfect square, and finding its prime factorization. Each task was solved with detailed reasoning and calculations. If you have a specific problem in mind, please provide more details for a tailored solution.
