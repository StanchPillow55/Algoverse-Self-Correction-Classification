==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 441," we first need to understand what the problem is asking. However, the problem statement is not clear from the given text. Assuming "Sample math problem 441" refers to a specific math problem, let's consider a typical math problem that involves the number 441. 

One common problem involving the number 441 is finding its square root. Let's solve that:

**Problem:** Find the square root of 441.

**Step 1: Understand the Problem**
The problem asks us to find the square root of 441. The square root of a number \( x \) is a number \( y \) such that \( y^2 = x \).

**Step 2: Estimate the Square Root**
First, let's estimate the square root of 441. We know that:
- \( 20^2 = 400 \)
- \( 25^2 = 625 \)

Since 441 is between 400 and 625, the square root of 441 should be between 20 and 25.

**Step 3: Calculate the Exact Square Root**
Let's try to find the exact square root by checking perfect squares between 20 and 25.

- \( 21^2 = 21 \times 21 = 441 \)

Thus, the square root of 441 is 21.

**Step 4: Verify the Solution**
To verify, we can square 21 again to ensure it equals 441:
- \( 21 \times 21 = 441 \)

The calculation confirms that 21 is indeed the square root of 441.

**Final Answer:**
The square root of 441 is 21.
