==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 441," we need to first understand what the problem is asking. However, the phrase "Sample math problem 441" does not provide enough information about the problem itself. It seems to be a reference or a label rather than a description of a specific math problem.

To proceed, let's assume that "Sample math problem 441" refers to a common type of math problem. Since no specific details are given, I'll create a hypothetical math problem involving the number 441 and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**
Determine whether the number 441 is a perfect square. If it is, find the square root.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understanding Perfect Squares:**
   A perfect square is an integer that is the square of an integer. In other words, if \( n^2 = 441 \), then 441 is a perfect square, and \( n \) is the square root of 441.

2. **Estimate the Square Root:**
   To determine if 441 is a perfect square, we can start by estimating its square root. We know that \( 20^2 = 400 \) and \( 25^2 = 625 \). Since 441 is between 400 and 625, its square root should be between 20 and 25.

3. **Check Integer Values:**
   We will check the squares of integers between 20 and 25 to see if any of these equal 441.

   - \( 21^2 = 21 \times 21 = 441 \)

4. **Verification:**
   Since \( 21^2 = 441 \), 441 is indeed a perfect square, and the square root of 441 is 21.

5. **Conclusion:**
   We have verified through calculation that 441 is a perfect square, and its square root is 21.

**Final Answer:**
The number 441 is a perfect square, and its square root is 21.
