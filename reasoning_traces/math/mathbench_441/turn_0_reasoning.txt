==================================================

To solve the problem, we first need to understand what "Sample math problem 441" refers to. Since the problem itself is not provided, I'll assume it's a generic math problem involving the number 441. A common type of problem involving numbers is finding their square roots, factors, or solving equations. Let's explore these possibilities:

### 1. Finding the Square Root of 441

The square root of a number \( n \) is a value \( x \) such that \( x^2 = n \). Let's find the square root of 441.

1. **Estimate the Square Root:**
   - 441 is a perfect square because it ends in 1, which is a common ending for perfect squares (1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100, etc.).
   - We know \( 20^2 = 400 \) and \( 25^2 = 625 \). So, \( \sqrt{441} \) is between 20 and 25.

2. **Calculate the Exact Square Root:**
   - Try \( 21^2 \):
     \[
     21 \times 21 = 441
     \]
   - Therefore, \( \sqrt{441} = 21 \).

### 2. Finding the Factors of 441

Factors are numbers that divide 441 without leaving a remainder.

1. **Start with the Smallest Prime:**
   - 441 is odd, so it's not divisible by 2.
   - Sum of digits of 441 is \( 4 + 4 + 1 = 9 \), which is divisible by 3. Therefore, 441 is divisible by 3.
   - Divide 441 by 3:
     \[
     441 \div 3 = 147
     \]

2. **Continue Factoring 147:**
   - Sum of digits of 147 is \( 1 + 4 + 7 = 12 \), which is divisible by 3.
   - Divide 147 by 3:
     \[
     147 \div 3 = 49
     \]

3. **Factor 49:**
   - 49 is \( 7 \times 7 \).

4. **Compile the Factors:**
   - The prime factorization of 441 is \( 3 \times 3 \times 7 \times 7 \) or \( 3^2 \times 7^2 \).

5. **List All Factors:**
   - Factors are: 1, 3, 7, 9, 21, 49, 63, 147, 441.

### 3. Solving an Equation Involving 441

If we assume a simple equation like \( x^2 = 441 \), we already found that \( x = 21 \) or \( x = -21 \) since both \( 21^2 = 441 \) and \((-21)^2 = 441\).

### Final Answer

Based on the assumptions and calculations above, the final answers are:

- The square root of 441 is 21.
- The factors of 441 are 1, 3, 7, 9, 21, 49, 63, 147, and 441.
- If solving \( x^2 = 441 \), the solutions are \( x = 21 \) and \( x = -21 \).

If you have a specific problem in mind, please provide more details for a tailored solution.
