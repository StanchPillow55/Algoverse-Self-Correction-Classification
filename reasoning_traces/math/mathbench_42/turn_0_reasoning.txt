==================================================

It seems like the problem statement is incomplete or unclear. "Sample math problem 42" doesn't provide enough information to solve a specific math problem. However, I can guide you through a generic approach to solving math problems, or if you have a specific type of math problem in mind (e.g., algebra, calculus, geometry), feel free to provide more details, and I'll be happy to help.

Here's a general approach to solving math problems:

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - Carefully read the problem statement.
   - Identify what is being asked.
   - Determine what information is given and what needs to be found.

2. **Devise a Plan:**
   - Think about the strategies that could be used to solve the problem (e.g., drawing a diagram, creating an equation, using a formula).
   - Consider similar problems you have solved before.

3. **Carry Out the Plan:**
   - Execute the steps you have planned.
   - Perform calculations carefully.
   - Keep track of units and ensure consistency.

4. **Review/Check Your Work:**
   - Verify each step of your solution.
   - Check if your answer makes sense in the context of the problem.
   - Review calculations for any possible errors.

5. **State the Final Answer:**
   - Clearly write down the final answer.
   - Include units if applicable.

If you can provide more details or specify a particular math problem, I can offer a more tailored solution.
