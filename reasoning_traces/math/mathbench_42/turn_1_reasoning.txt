==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 42," we need to first understand what the problem is asking. However, the problem statement "Sample math problem 42" is not specific enough for us to determine the exact mathematical question or context. 

In a typical scenario, a math problem labeled with a number, such as "42," might refer to a specific problem in a textbook or a set of exercises. Without additional context or details, it's impossible to determine what calculations or reasoning are required.

To proceed, let's consider a hypothetical math problem involving the number 42. For example, let's solve a problem where we need to find the factors of 42.

**Step-by-step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We are tasked with finding all the factors of the number 42.

2. **Definition of Factors:**
   - A factor of a number is an integer that divides the number without leaving a remainder.

3. **Finding Factors:**
   - Start with the number 1 and test each integer up to 42 to see if it divides 42 evenly.

4. **Perform Division:**
   - \(42 \div 1 = 42\) (remainder 0, so 1 is a factor)
   - \(42 \div 2 = 21\) (remainder 0, so 2 is a factor)
   - \(42 \div 3 = 14\) (remainder 0, so 3 is a factor)
   - \(42 \div 4 = 10.5\) (not an integer, so 4 is not a factor)
   - \(42 \div 5 = 8.4\) (not an integer, so 5 is not a factor)
   - \(42 \div 6 = 7\) (remainder 0, so 6 is a factor)
   - \(42 \div 7 = 6\) (remainder 0, so 7 is a factor)
   - \(42 \div 8 = 5.25\) (not an integer, so 8 is not a factor)
   - Continue this process up to 42.

5. **List of Factors:**
   - The factors of 42 are: 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 14, 21, and 42.

6. **Verify:**
   - Multiply pairs of factors to verify they produce 42:
     - \(1 \times 42 = 42\)
     - \(2 \times 21 = 42\)
     - \(3 \times 14 = 42\)
     - \(6 \times 7 = 42\)

**Final Answer:**
The factors of 42 are 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 14, 21, and 42.
