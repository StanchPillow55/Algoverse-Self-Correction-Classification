Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem effectively, we need to first understand what "Sample math problem 448" refers to. Since the problem itself isn't specified in the prompt, I'll create a hypothetical math problem for demonstration purposes and solve it step-by-step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**

"Calculate the area of a triangle with a base of 10 units and a height of 5 units."

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Formula:**
   The area \( A \) of a triangle can be calculated using the formula:
   \[
   A = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height}
   \]

2. **Identify the Given Values:**
   - Base (\( b \)) = 10 units
   - Height (\( h \)) = 5 units

3. **Substitute the Values into the Formula:**
   \[
   A = \frac{1}{2} \times 10 \times 5
   \]

4. **Perform the Multiplication:**
   First, multiply the base and the height:
   \[
   10 \times 5 = 50
   \]

5. **Calculate the Area:**
   Now, take half of the product:
   \[
   A = \frac{1}{2} \times 50 = 25
   \]

6. **State the Final Answer:**
   The area of the triangle is 25 square units.

By following these steps, we have calculated the area of the triangle using the given base and height. This process demonstrates how to apply the formula for the area of a triangle and shows all calculations and reasoning clearly.
