To solve "Sample math problem 448," we need to first understand what the problem is asking. Since the problem statement is not provided, I'll create a sample math problem to solve.

**Sample Math Problem 448:**

A rectangular garden has a length that is 3 meters longer than its width. The area of the garden is 70 square meters. What are the dimensions of the garden?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( w \) be the width of the garden in meters.
   - Then the length of the garden is \( w + 3 \) meters.

2. **Write the Equation for Area:**
   - The area of a rectangle is given by the formula:
     \[
     \text{Area} = \text{Length} \times \text{Width}
     \]
   - Substituting the expressions for length and width, we have:
     \[
     (w + 3) \times w = 70
     \]

3. **Set Up the Equation:**
   - Expand the equation:
     \[
     w^2 + 3w = 70
     \]

4. **Rearrange the Equation:**
   - Move all terms to one side to form a quadratic equation:
     \[
     w^2 + 3w - 70 = 0
     \]

5. **Solve the Quadratic Equation:**
   - We can solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula:
     \[
     w = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
     \]
   - Here, \( a = 1 \), \( b = 3 \), and \( c = -70 \).

6. **Calculate the Discriminant:**
   - The discriminant (\( b^2 - 4ac \)) is:
     \[
     3^2 - 4 \times 1 \times (-70) = 9 + 280 = 289
     \]

7. **Find the Roots:**
   - Since the discriminant is a perfect square, we can find the roots:
     \[
     w = \frac{-3 \pm \sqrt{289}}{2 \times 1}
     \]
   - \(\sqrt{289} = 17\), so:
     \[
     w = \frac{-3 \pm 17}{2}
     \]

8. **Calculate the Possible Values for \( w \):**
   - First root:
     \[
     w = \frac{-3 + 17}{2} = \frac{14}{2} = 7
     \]
   - Second root:
     \[
     w = \frac{-3 - 17}{2} = \frac{-20}{2} = -10
     \]

9. **Select the Valid Solution:**
   - Since width cannot be negative, we discard \( w = -10 \).
   - Thus, \( w = 7 \).

10. **Find the Length:**
    - The length is \( w + 3 = 7 + 3 = 10 \).

**Final Answer:**

The dimensions of the garden are 7 meters in width and 10 meters in length.
