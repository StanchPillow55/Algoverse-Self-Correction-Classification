Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample math problem 448" refers to. Since the problem is not explicitly stated, I'll assume it involves a typical math problem that could be labeled as such. Let's consider a common type of math problem that might be labeled in this way, such as solving a quadratic equation.

Let's assume "Sample math problem 448" involves solving the quadratic equation:

\[ ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \]

For the sake of this example, let's use specific coefficients:
\[ 2x^2 + 3x - 2 = 0 \]

### Step 1: Identify the coefficients
The coefficients from the quadratic equation \( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \) are:
- \( a = 2 \)
- \( b = 3 \)
- \( c = -2 \)

### Step 2: Calculate the discriminant
The discriminant (\( \Delta \)) of a quadratic equation is given by:
\[ \Delta = b^2 - 4ac \]

Substitute the values of \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \):
\[ \Delta = 3^2 - 4 \times 2 \times (-2) \]
\[ \Delta = 9 + 16 \]
\[ \Delta = 25 \]

### Step 3: Determine the nature of the roots
Since the discriminant is positive (\( \Delta = 25 \)), the quadratic equation has two distinct real roots.

### Step 4: Use the quadratic formula to find the roots
The quadratic formula is:
\[ x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{\Delta}}{2a} \]

Substitute the values of \( b \), \( \Delta \), and \( a \):
\[ x = \frac{-3 \pm \sqrt{25}}{2 \times 2} \]
\[ x = \frac{-3 \pm 5}{4} \]

### Step 5: Calculate the roots
Calculate the two possible values for \( x \):

1. \( x_1 = \frac{-3 + 5}{4} \)
   \[ x_1 = \frac{2}{4} \]
   \[ x_1 = \frac{1}{2} \]

2. \( x_2 = \frac{-3 - 5}{4} \)
   \[ x_2 = \frac{-8}{4} \]
   \[ x_2 = -2 \]

### Final Answer
The solutions to the quadratic equation \( 2x^2 + 3x - 2 = 0 \) are:
\[ x = \frac{1}{2} \quad \text{and} \quad x = -2 \]

These are the roots of the equation.
