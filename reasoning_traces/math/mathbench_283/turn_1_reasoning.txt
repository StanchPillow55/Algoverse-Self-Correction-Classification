==================================================

To solve the problem, we first need to understand what "Sample math problem 283" refers to. Since this is not a standard math problem description, I'll assume it's a placeholder for a specific problem. Without the actual problem statement, I'll create a hypothetical math problem and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem 283:**

"Calculate the sum of the first 20 positive even numbers."

**Step-by-step Solution:**

1. **Identify the Sequence:**
   - The sequence of the first 20 positive even numbers is: 2, 4, 6, 8, ..., 40.

2. **Recognize the Pattern:**
   - This is an arithmetic sequence where the first term \( a_1 = 2 \) and the common difference \( d = 2 \).

3. **Formula for the Sum of an Arithmetic Sequence:**
   - The sum \( S_n \) of the first \( n \) terms of an arithmetic sequence is given by:
     \[
     S_n = \frac{n}{2} \times (a_1 + a_n)
     \]
   - Where \( n \) is the number of terms, \( a_1 \) is the first term, and \( a_n \) is the nth term.

4. **Find the 20th Term:**
   - The nth term \( a_n \) of an arithmetic sequence is given by:
     \[
     a_n = a_1 + (n-1) \times d
     \]
   - For the 20th term:
     \[
     a_{20} = 2 + (20-1) \times 2 = 2 + 38 = 40
     \]

5. **Calculate the Sum:**
   - Substitute the values into the sum formula:
     \[
     S_{20} = \frac{20}{2} \times (2 + 40) = 10 \times 42 = 420
     \]

6. **Conclusion:**
   - The sum of the first 20 positive even numbers is 420.

**Final Answer:**
The sum of the first 20 positive even numbers is 420.
