==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 283," I need more specific information about the problem itself. However, since the problem number "283" is mentioned without any context or details, I'll demonstrate how to approach a generic math problem by creating a sample problem and solving it step by step.

Let's assume "Sample math problem 283" is a typical algebra problem. Here's a hypothetical problem:

**Problem:** Solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 3x + 5 = 20 \).

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   We need to solve for \( x \) in the linear equation \( 3x + 5 = 20 \).

2. **Isolate the Variable:**
   To solve for \( x \), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. Start by eliminating the constant term on the left side.

   \[
   3x + 5 = 20
   \]

   Subtract 5 from both sides to remove the constant term from the left side:

   \[
   3x + 5 - 5 = 20 - 5
   \]

   Simplifying both sides gives:

   \[
   3x = 15
   \]

3. **Solve for \( x \):**
   Now, divide both sides by 3 to solve for \( x \):

   \[
   \frac{3x}{3} = \frac{15}{3}
   \]

   Simplifying both sides gives:

   \[
   x = 5
   \]

4. **Verify the Solution:**
   Substitute \( x = 5 \) back into the original equation to verify the solution:

   \[
   3(5) + 5 = 20
   \]

   Simplifying the left side:

   \[
   15 + 5 = 20
   \]

   \[
   20 = 20
   \]

   Since both sides of the equation are equal, the solution \( x = 5 \) is verified.

**Final Answer:**

The solution to the equation \( 3x + 5 = 20 \) is \( x = 5 \).
