==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 13" refers to. Unfortunately, without additional context or specific details about the problem, it's impossible to provide a direct solution. However, I can guide you through a general approach to solving reasoning problems.

### General Approach to Solving Reasoning Problems:

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - Carefully read the problem statement.
   - Identify what is being asked.
   - Note any specific conditions or constraints.

2. **Break Down the Problem:**
   - Divide the problem into smaller, manageable parts.
   - Consider any relevant formulas or principles that apply.

3. **Analyze the Information:**
   - Look for patterns or relationships.
   - Consider drawing diagrams or charts if applicable.

4. **Develop a Strategy:**
   - Decide on a method to solve the problem (e.g., algebraic manipulation, logical deduction, etc.).
   - Consider multiple approaches if the first one is not successful.

5. **Execute the Plan:**
   - Carry out the necessary calculations or logical steps.
   - Keep track of your work to avoid errors.

6. **Review and Verify:**
   - Double-check your calculations and reasoning.
   - Ensure that your solution satisfies all conditions of the problem.

7. **State the Final Answer:**
   - Clearly present your final answer.
   - Include units or labels if applicable.

### Example Problem:

Let's create a hypothetical reasoning problem to illustrate the process:

**Problem:** A farmer has 100 meters of fencing and wants to enclose a rectangular area. What dimensions should the rectangle have to maximize the enclosed area?

**Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We need to maximize the area of a rectangle with a fixed perimeter of 100 meters.

2. **Break Down the Problem:**
   - Let the length be \( L \) and the width be \( W \).
   - The perimeter is given by \( 2L + 2W = 100 \).

3. **Analyze the Information:**
   - Simplify the perimeter equation: \( L + W = 50 \).

4. **Develop a Strategy:**
   - Use the area formula \( A = L \times W \).
   - Express \( W \) in terms of \( L \): \( W = 50 - L \).
   - Substitute into the area formula: \( A = L(50 - L) = 50L - L^2 \).

5. **Execute the Plan:**
   - The area \( A = 50L - L^2 \) is a quadratic equation.
   - To find the maximum area, find the vertex of the parabola.
   - The vertex \( L \) is at \( L = -\frac{b}{2a} = -\frac{50}{-2} = 25 \).

6. **Review and Verify:**
   - If \( L = 25 \), then \( W = 50 - 25 = 25 \).
   - The rectangle is a square with sides of 25 meters.
   - The maximum area is \( 25 \times 25 = 625 \) square meters.

7. **State the Final Answer:**
   - The dimensions that maximize the area are 25 meters by 25 meters, forming a square.
