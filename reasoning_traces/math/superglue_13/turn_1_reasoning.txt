==================================================

To solve the problem effectively, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 13" entails. Since the problem statement is not provided, I'll demonstrate a general approach to solving a typical math reasoning problem. Let's assume a hypothetical problem and solve it step-by-step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**

A farmer has a rectangular field that is 100 meters long and 60 meters wide. He wants to divide the field into two equal parts by constructing a fence parallel to the shorter side. How long will the fence be?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We have a rectangular field with dimensions 100 meters (length) and 60 meters (width).
   - The task is to divide this field into two equal parts using a fence parallel to the shorter side (width).

2. **Visualize the Problem:**
   - Imagine the rectangle with the longer side as the base.
   - The fence will be parallel to the width, meaning it will run along the length of the field.

3. **Determine the Length of the Fence:**
   - Since the fence is parallel to the width, it will span the entire length of the field.
   - Therefore, the length of the fence will be equal to the length of the field.

4. **Calculate the Length of the Fence:**
   - The length of the field is given as 100 meters.
   - Hence, the length of the fence will also be 100 meters.

5. **Verify the Solution:**
   - Dividing the field into two equal parts means each part will have an area of half the total area of the field.
   - Total area of the field = Length × Width = 100 meters × 60 meters = 6000 square meters.
   - Area of each part = 6000 square meters / 2 = 3000 square meters.
   - Each part will have dimensions 100 meters (length) × 30 meters (width), confirming that the fence divides the field equally.

**Final Answer:**

The length of the fence required to divide the field into two equal parts is 100 meters.
