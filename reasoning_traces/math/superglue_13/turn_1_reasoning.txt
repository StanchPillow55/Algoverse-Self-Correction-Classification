==================================================

To solve a reasoning question, we need to carefully analyze the problem, identify the relevant information, and apply logical reasoning or mathematical operations to arrive at the solution. However, the question you've provided, "Sample reasoning question 13," lacks specific details or context. Therefore, I'll create a hypothetical reasoning problem and demonstrate how to solve it step-by-step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**

A farmer has a total of 100 animals consisting of chickens and cows. If the total number of legs is 280, how many chickens and how many cows does the farmer have?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Identify Variables:**
   - Let \( C \) represent the number of cows.
   - Let \( H \) represent the number of chickens.

2. **Set Up Equations:**
   - We know the total number of animals is 100:
     \[
     C + H = 100
     \]
   - Cows have 4 legs and chickens have 2 legs. The total number of legs is 280:
     \[
     4C + 2H = 280
     \]

3. **Solve the System of Equations:**

   - From the first equation, express \( H \) in terms of \( C \):
     \[
     H = 100 - C
     \]

   - Substitute \( H = 100 - C \) into the second equation:
     \[
     4C + 2(100 - C) = 280
     \]

   - Simplify and solve for \( C \):
     \[
     4C + 200 - 2C = 280
     \]
     \[
     2C + 200 = 280
     \]
     \[
     2C = 80
     \]
     \[
     C = 40
     \]

   - Substitute \( C = 40 \) back into the equation for \( H \):
     \[
     H = 100 - C = 100 - 40 = 60
     \]

4. **Verify the Solution:**

   - Check the total number of animals:
     \[
     C + H = 40 + 60 = 100
     \]
     - This is correct.

   - Check the total number of legs:
     \[
     4C + 2H = 4(40) + 2(60) = 160 + 120 = 280
     \]
     - This is also correct.

**Final Answer:**

The farmer has 40 cows and 60 chickens.
