==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 69," we need to first understand what the problem is asking. Since the problem statement is not fully clear, I'll assume it involves solving a mathematical equation or performing a calculation related to the number 69. Let's consider a few possibilities and solve them step by step.

### Possibility 1: Basic Arithmetic Problem
Let's assume the problem is to perform a basic arithmetic operation involving the number 69. For example, let's calculate the sum of 69 and another number, say 31.

**Step 1: Set up the problem**
\[ 69 + 31 \]

**Step 2: Perform the addition**
\[ 69 + 31 = 100 \]

**Conclusion for Possibility 1:**
The sum of 69 and 31 is 100.

### Possibility 2: Algebraic Equation
Let's assume the problem involves solving an algebraic equation where 69 is part of the equation. For example, solve for \( x \) in the equation:
\[ x + 69 = 100 \]

**Step 1: Set up the equation**
\[ x + 69 = 100 \]

**Step 2: Isolate \( x \) by subtracting 69 from both sides**
\[ x = 100 - 69 \]

**Step 3: Perform the subtraction**
\[ x = 31 \]

**Conclusion for Possibility 2:**
The solution to the equation \( x + 69 = 100 \) is \( x = 31 \).

### Possibility 3: Multiplication Problem
Let's assume the problem involves multiplying 69 by another number, say 2.

**Step 1: Set up the multiplication**
\[ 69 \times 2 \]

**Step 2: Perform the multiplication**
\[ 69 \times 2 = 138 \]

**Conclusion for Possibility 3:**
The product of 69 and 2 is 138.

### Final Answer
Since the original problem statement "Sample math problem 69" is ambiguous, I've explored several possibilities. Each possibility leads to a different answer:

1. If the problem is an addition problem: The sum of 69 and 31 is 100.
2. If the problem is an algebraic equation: The solution to \( x + 69 = 100 \) is \( x = 31 \).
3. If the problem is a multiplication problem: The product of 69 and 2 is 138.

Without additional context, any of these could be the intended problem and solution.
