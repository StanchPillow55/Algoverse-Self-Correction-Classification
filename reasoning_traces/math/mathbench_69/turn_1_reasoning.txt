Question ID: mathbench_69
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 69," we need to first understand what the problem is asking. However, the problem statement "Sample math problem 69" is not specific enough to provide any details or context. Therefore, I will assume that this is a placeholder for a specific math problem that you would like to solve.

Since I don't have the details of the specific problem, I'll demonstrate how to solve a generic math problem using a step-by-step approach. Let's assume a common type of math problem, such as solving a linear equation. I'll use the equation \(2x + 3 = 11\) as an example.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   We need to solve the equation \(2x + 3 = 11\) for the variable \(x\).

2. **Isolate the Variable:**
   To solve for \(x\), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We can do this by performing inverse operations.

3. **Subtract 3 from Both Sides:**
   \[
   2x + 3 - 3 = 11 - 3
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   2x = 8
   \]

4. **Divide Both Sides by 2:**
   \[
   \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{8}{2}
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   x = 4
   \]

5. **Check the Solution:**
   Substitute \(x = 4\) back into the original equation to verify:
   \[
   2(4) + 3 = 11
   \]
   \[
   8 + 3 = 11
   \]
   Since both sides of the equation are equal, \(x = 4\) is indeed the correct solution.

### Final Answer:
The solution to the equation \(2x + 3 = 11\) is \(x = 4\).

If you have a specific problem labeled as "Sample math problem 69," please provide the details of the problem so I can assist you with a tailored solution.
