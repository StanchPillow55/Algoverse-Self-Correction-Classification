Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 69," we need to first understand what the problem is asking. However, the problem statement "Sample math problem 69" is not specific enough for us to determine what the actual mathematical question is. It seems like a placeholder or a reference to a specific problem that isn't provided here.

To proceed, let's assume that "Sample math problem 69" refers to a common type of math problem. I'll create a hypothetical problem and solve it step by step. Let's assume the problem is:

**Problem:** Solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 2x + 3 = 15 \).

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Understand the Equation:**
   The equation given is \( 2x + 3 = 15 \). This is a linear equation in one variable, \( x \).

2. **Isolate the Variable:**
   To solve for \( x \), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We can do this by performing operations that will leave \( x \) by itself on one side.

3. **Subtract 3 from Both Sides:**
   First, we subtract 3 from both sides of the equation to get rid of the constant term on the left side:
   \[
   2x + 3 - 3 = 15 - 3
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   2x = 12
   \]

4. **Divide by 2:**
   Next, we divide both sides of the equation by 2 to solve for \( x \):
   \[
   \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{12}{2}
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   x = 6
   \]

5. **Verify the Solution:**
   To ensure our solution is correct, we substitute \( x = 6 \) back into the original equation:
   \[
   2(6) + 3 = 15
   \]
   Simplifying the left side gives:
   \[
   12 + 3 = 15
   \]
   \[
   15 = 15
   \]
   Since both sides of the equation are equal, our solution \( x = 6 \) is verified.

### Final Answer:
The solution to the equation \( 2x + 3 = 15 \) is \( x = 6 \).

If "Sample math problem 69" refers to a different problem, please provide the specific details or context of the problem so I can assist you accurately.
