==================================================

To solve the problem, we first need to understand what "Sample math problem 69" refers to. Since the problem statement is not explicitly given, I'll create a hypothetical math problem involving the number 69 and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**
Calculate the sum of all positive divisors of the number 69.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Identify the Divisors of 69:**
   - To find the divisors of 69, we need to determine which numbers divide 69 without leaving a remainder.
   - Start by checking divisibility with smaller prime numbers:
     - **2:** 69 is odd, so it is not divisible by 2.
     - **3:** Sum of the digits of 69 is 6 + 9 = 15, which is divisible by 3. Therefore, 69 is divisible by 3.
     - **5:** The last digit of 69 is not 0 or 5, so it is not divisible by 5.
     - **7:** Perform the division 69 รท 7 = 9.857, which is not an integer, so 69 is not divisible by 7.
     - **11:** Alternating sum of digits is 6 - 9 = -3, which is not divisible by 11.
   - Since 69 is not divisible by any prime numbers greater than 3 up to its square root (approximately 8.3), we conclude that 69 is a product of smaller primes.

2. **Prime Factorization of 69:**
   - From the above checks, we know 69 is divisible by 3. Perform the division: 69 รท 3 = 23.
   - Check if 23 is a prime number. It is only divisible by 1 and itself, confirming that 23 is prime.
   - Therefore, the prime factorization of 69 is \(3 \times 23\).

3. **List All Divisors:**
   - Using the prime factorization, the divisors of 69 are determined by taking all combinations of the prime factors raised to their respective powers:
     - \(1\) (no factors used)
     - \(3\) (using the factor 3)
     - \(23\) (using the factor 23)
     - \(3 \times 23 = 69\) (using both factors)
   - Thus, the divisors of 69 are: 1, 3, 23, and 69.

4. **Calculate the Sum of Divisors:**
   - Add up all the divisors: \(1 + 3 + 23 + 69\).
   - Perform the addition step by step:
     - \(1 + 3 = 4\)
     - \(4 + 23 = 27\)
     - \(27 + 69 = 96\)

**Final Answer:**
The sum of all positive divisors of 69 is 96.
