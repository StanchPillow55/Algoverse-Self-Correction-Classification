==================================================

To solve the sample math problem 426, we need to first understand what the problem is asking. However, the problem statement "Sample math problem 426" is not specific enough to determine the exact nature of the problem. Since no specific details or context are provided, I will assume this is a placeholder for a generic math problem. 

Let's consider a hypothetical math problem involving the number 426. We can create a problem such as finding the sum of the digits of 426, determining if 426 is a prime number, or finding the factors of 426. I will choose to find the sum of the digits of 426 and determine if it is a prime number.

### Problem 1: Sum of the Digits of 426

**Step 1: Identify the digits of 426.**

The number 426 consists of the digits 4, 2, and 6.

**Step 2: Calculate the sum of the digits.**

Sum = 4 + 2 + 6

**Step 3: Perform the addition.**

4 + 2 = 6

6 + 6 = 12

**Conclusion:**

The sum of the digits of 426 is 12.

### Problem 2: Determine if 426 is a Prime Number

A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.

**Step 1: Check divisibility by 2.**

426 is an even number (it ends in 6), so it is divisible by 2.

426 รท 2 = 213

Since 426 is divisible by 2, it is not a prime number.

**Conclusion:**

426 is not a prime number because it is divisible by 2.

### Final Answer:

1. The sum of the digits of 426 is 12.
2. 426 is not a prime number because it is divisible by 2.
