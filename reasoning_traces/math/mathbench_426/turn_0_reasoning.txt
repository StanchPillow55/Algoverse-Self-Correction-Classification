==================================================

It seems like the problem statement is incomplete or not specific enough. "Sample math problem 426" doesn't provide enough information to determine what the problem is asking. However, I can guide you through a general approach to solving math problems, or if you have a specific type of problem in mind (e.g., algebra, geometry, calculus), please provide more details or clarify the problem, and I'll be happy to help.

If you meant a specific type of math problem, such as solving an equation, finding the area of a shape, or something else, please let me know. Otherwise, here's a general approach to solving a math problem:

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - Read the problem carefully.
   - Identify what is being asked.
   - Determine what information is given and what needs to be found.

2. **Devise a Plan:**
   - Consider possible strategies to solve the problem, such as drawing a diagram, creating an equation, or using a formula.
   - Choose the most appropriate method based on the problem type.

3. **Carry Out the Plan:**
   - Execute the chosen strategy step by step.
   - Perform calculations carefully and check each step for accuracy.

4. **Review/Check the Solution:**
   - Verify that the solution answers the question posed in the problem.
   - Check calculations and reasoning to ensure they are correct.
   - Consider whether the answer is reasonable and makes sense in the context of the problem.

If you provide more details or specify the type of math problem, I can offer a more targeted solution.
