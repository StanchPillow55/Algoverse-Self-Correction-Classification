==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 426," we need more specific information about what the problem entails. Since "426" could refer to a variety of mathematical problems or concepts, I'll assume you want to explore a problem involving the number 426 itself. Let's consider a few different mathematical explorations involving this number:

### Exploration 1: Prime Factorization
Let's find the prime factorization of 426.

1. **Check divisibility by 2**: Since 426 is an even number, it is divisible by 2.
   \[
   426 \div 2 = 213
   \]

2. **Check divisibility of 213 by 3**: To check if 213 is divisible by 3, sum the digits: \(2 + 1 + 3 = 6\). Since 6 is divisible by 3, 213 is also divisible by 3.
   \[
   213 \div 3 = 71
   \]

3. **Check if 71 is a prime number**: To determine if 71 is prime, check divisibility by prime numbers less than \(\sqrt{71}\), which are 2, 3, 5, and 7.
   - 71 is not even, so not divisible by 2.
   - Sum of digits of 71 is \(7 + 1 = 8\), not divisible by 3.
   - 71 does not end in 0 or 5, so not divisible by 5.
   - Dividing 71 by 7 gives approximately 10.14, not an integer.

Since 71 is not divisible by any of these, it is a prime number.

Thus, the prime factorization of 426 is:
\[
426 = 2 \times 3 \times 71
\]

### Exploration 2: Divisors of 426
Using the prime factorization, we can find the divisors of 426.

The prime factorization is \(2^1 \times 3^1 \times 71^1\). The number of divisors is given by \((1+1)(1+1)(1+1) = 2 \times 2 \times 2 = 8\).

The divisors are:
- \(1\)
- \(2\)
- \(3\)
- \(6\) (since \(2 \times 3 = 6\))
- \(71\)
- \(142\) (since \(2 \times 71 = 142\))
- \(213\) (since \(3 \times 71 = 213\))
- \(426\) (since \(2 \times 3 \times 71 = 426\))

### Exploration 3: Properties of 426
- **Even or Odd**: 426 is an even number because it is divisible by 2.
- **Sum of Digits**: The sum of the digits of 426 is \(4 + 2 + 6 = 12\).
- **Divisibility by 9**: Since the sum of the digits (12) is not divisible by 9, 426 is not divisible by 9.

### Final Answer
The prime factorization of 426 is \(2 \times 3 \times 71\). The divisors of 426 are 1, 2, 3, 6, 71, 142, 213, and 426.
