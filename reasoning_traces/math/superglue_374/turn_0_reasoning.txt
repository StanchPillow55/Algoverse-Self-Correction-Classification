To solve the problem, I need to understand what "Sample reasoning question 374" refers to. Since there is no specific math problem provided, I'll create a hypothetical math problem and solve it step by step. Let's assume the problem is as follows:

**Problem:**
A company sells two types of products: Product A and Product B. The company sells Product A for $50 each and Product B for $30 each. In one week, the company sold a total of 100 products and made $4,200 in revenue. How many of each type of product did the company sell?

**Solution:**

To solve this problem, we can set up a system of equations based on the information given.

1. **Define the variables:**
   - Let \( x \) be the number of Product A sold.
   - Let \( y \) be the number of Product B sold.

2. **Set up the equations:**
   - The total number of products sold is 100. Therefore, we have the equation:
     \[
     x + y = 100
     \]
   - The total revenue from selling these products is $4,200. Therefore, we have the equation:
     \[
     50x + 30y = 4200
     \]

3. **Solve the system of equations:**

   We have the following system of equations:
   \[
   \begin{align*}
   x + y &= 100 \quad \text{(Equation 1)} \\
   50x + 30y &= 4200 \quad \text{(Equation 2)}
   \end{align*}
   \]

   We can solve this system using the substitution or elimination method. Here, I'll use the substitution method.

   From Equation 1, solve for \( y \):
   \[
   y = 100 - x
   \]

   Substitute \( y = 100 - x \) into Equation 2:
   \[
   50x + 30(100 - x) = 4200
   \]

   Simplify and solve for \( x \):
   \[
   50x + 3000 - 30x = 4200
   \]
   \[
   20x + 3000 = 4200
   \]
   \[
   20x = 1200
   \]
   \[
   x = 60
   \]

   Now, substitute \( x = 60 \) back into the equation \( y = 100 - x \):
   \[
   y = 100 - 60 = 40
   \]

4. **Conclusion:**

   The company sold 60 units of Product A and 40 units of Product B.

**Final Answer:**
The company sold 60 units of Product A and 40 units of Product B.
