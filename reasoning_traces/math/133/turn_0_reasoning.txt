==================================================

To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the number of students absent**:
   - There are 40 students in total.
   - If \( \frac{1}{10} \) of the students are absent, we calculate the number of absent students as follows:
     \[
     \text{Number of absent students} = \frac{1}{10} \times 40 = 4
     \]

2. **Calculate the number of students present**:
   - To find the number of students present, we subtract the number of absent students from the total number of students:
     \[
     \text{Number of present students} = 40 - 4 = 36
     \]

3. **Determine how many students are in the classroom**:
   - According to the problem, \( \frac{3}{4} \) of the students who are present are in the classroom. We calculate the number of students in the classroom as follows:
     \[
     \text{Number of students in the classroom} = \frac{3}{4} \times 36 = 27
     \]

4. **Calculate how many students are in the canteen**:
   - The remaining students who are present will be in the canteen. To find this, we subtract the number of students in the classroom from the total number of present students:
     \[
     \text{Number of students in the canteen} = \text{Number of present students} - \text{Number of students in the classroom}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Number of students in the canteen} = 36 - 27 = 9
     \]

5. **Final answer**:
   - Therefore, the number of students in the canteen is \( \boxed{9} \).
