==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine how many students are in the canteen based on the given conditions. Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Determine the number of absent students:**
   - The problem states that \( \frac{1}{10} \) of the students are absent.
   - There are 40 students in total.
   - Calculate the number of absent students:
     \[
     \text{Absent students} = \frac{1}{10} \times 40 = 4
     \]

2. **Determine the number of present students:**
   - Subtract the number of absent students from the total number of students to find the number of present students:
     \[
     \text{Present students} = 40 - 4 = 36
     \]

3. **Determine the number of students in the classroom:**
   - According to the problem, \( \frac{3}{4} \) of the present students are in the classroom.
   - Calculate the number of students in the classroom:
     \[
     \text{Students in classroom} = \frac{3}{4} \times 36 = 27
     \]

4. **Determine the number of students in the canteen:**
   - The rest of the present students are in the canteen.
   - Subtract the number of students in the classroom from the total number of present students to find the number of students in the canteen:
     \[
     \text{Students in canteen} = 36 - 27 = 9
     \]

Thus, the number of students in the canteen is \(\boxed{9}\).
