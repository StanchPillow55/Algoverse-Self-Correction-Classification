Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem effectively, let's first understand what "Sample reasoning question 468" might entail. Since the problem is not explicitly stated, I'll create a hypothetical math problem and solve it step by step. 

Let's assume the problem is as follows:

**Problem:**  
A company produces two types of gadgets: Gadget A and Gadget B. The company can produce a maximum of 100 gadgets per day. Each Gadget A requires 2 hours of labor, and each Gadget B requires 3 hours of labor. The company has a total of 240 labor hours available per day. If the profit from Gadget A is $50 and from Gadget B is $70, how many of each gadget should the company produce to maximize profit?

**Solution:**

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( x \) be the number of Gadget A produced per day.
   - Let \( y \) be the number of Gadget B produced per day.

2. **Set Up Constraints:**
   - The total number of gadgets produced cannot exceed 100:
     \[
     x + y \leq 100
     \]
   - The total labor hours cannot exceed 240:
     \[
     2x + 3y \leq 240
     \]
   - Non-negativity constraints:
     \[
     x \geq 0, \quad y \geq 0
     \]

3. **Objective Function:**
   - The profit function to maximize is:
     \[
     P = 50x + 70y
     \]

4. **Graphical Solution Method:**
   - Plot the constraints on a graph:
     - \( x + y = 100 \) is a line with intercepts (100, 0) and (0, 100).
     - \( 2x + 3y = 240 \) is a line with intercepts (120, 0) and (0, 80).
   - Identify the feasible region defined by the intersection of these constraints.

5. **Find Corner Points:**
   - Solve for intersection points of the lines:
     - Intersection of \( x + y = 100 \) and \( 2x + 3y = 240 \):
       \[
       x + y = 100 \quad \Rightarrow \quad y = 100 - x
       \]
       Substitute into the second equation:
       \[
       2x + 3(100 - x) = 240 \quad \Rightarrow \quad 2x + 300 - 3x = 240
       \]
       \[
       -x + 300 = 240 \quad \Rightarrow \quad x = 60, \quad y = 40
       \]
   - Other corner points are (0, 0), (0, 80), and (100, 0).

6. **Evaluate Objective Function at Each Corner Point:**
   - \( P(0, 0) = 50(0) + 70(0) = 0 \)
   - \( P(0, 80) = 50(0) + 70(80) = 5600 \)
   - \( P(100, 0) = 50(100) + 70(0) = 5000 \)
   - \( P(60, 40) = 50(60) + 70(40) = 3000 + 2800 = 5800 \)

7. **Determine Maximum Profit:**
   - The maximum profit is $5800 at the point (60, 40).

**Final Answer:**
To maximize profit, the company should produce 60 units of Gadget A and 40 units of Gadget B per day. The maximum profit is $5800.
