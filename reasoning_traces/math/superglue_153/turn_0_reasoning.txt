==================================================

To solve the problem effectively, I need more information about "Sample reasoning question 153." Without specific details or context, I can't provide a precise solution. However, I can guide you through a generic approach to solving a typical math reasoning problem.

Let's assume "Sample reasoning question 153" involves a common type of math problem, such as solving an equation, working with percentages, or analyzing a word problem. Here's a step-by-step approach to solving a generic math reasoning problem:

### Step 1: Understand the Problem
- **Read the problem carefully.** Identify what is being asked. Look for keywords that indicate mathematical operations, such as "sum," "difference," "product," or "quotient."
- **Identify the given information.** Write down all the numbers, variables, and conditions provided in the problem.

### Step 2: Devise a Plan
- **Choose a strategy.** Depending on the problem type, decide whether to use algebra, arithmetic, geometry, or another mathematical method.
- **Set up equations or expressions.** If applicable, translate the word problem into mathematical equations.

### Step 3: Carry Out the Plan
- **Perform calculations.** Solve the equations or perform the necessary arithmetic operations.
- **Show all work.** Write down each step to ensure clarity and accuracy.

### Step 4: Check Your Work
- **Verify the solution.** Substitute your answer back into the original problem to ensure it satisfies all conditions.
- **Consider alternative methods.** If time permits, solve the problem using a different approach to confirm the result.

### Step 5: State the Final Answer
- **Write the answer clearly.** Ensure it is in the correct units or format as required by the problem.

### Example Problem
Let's apply this approach to a simple example:

**Problem:** If 3 times a number is decreased by 4, the result is 11. What is the number?

#### Step 1: Understand the Problem
- We need to find a number such that 3 times this number minus 4 equals 11.

#### Step 2: Devise a Plan
- Let the unknown number be \( x \).
- Set up the equation: \( 3x - 4 = 11 \).

#### Step 3: Carry Out the Plan
- Solve for \( x \):
  \[
  3x - 4 = 11
  \]
  Add 4 to both sides:
  \[
  3x = 15
  \]
  Divide both sides by 3:
  \[
  x = 5
  \]

#### Step 4: Check Your Work
- Substitute \( x = 5 \) back into the original condition:
  \[
  3(5) - 4 = 15 - 4 = 11
  \]
  The condition is satisfied.

#### Step 5: State the Final Answer
- The number is \( 5 \).

If you provide the specific details of "Sample reasoning question 153," I can offer a more tailored solution.
