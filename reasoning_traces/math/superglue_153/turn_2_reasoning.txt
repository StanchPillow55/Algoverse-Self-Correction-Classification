Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem effectively, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 153" entails. Since the problem is not explicitly stated, I'll assume it's a hypothetical math problem that requires logical reasoning and problem-solving skills. Let's create a sample problem and solve it step by step.

### Sample Problem:
**Problem Statement:**  
A farmer has a rectangular field that is 100 meters long and 60 meters wide. He wants to divide the field into smaller rectangular plots, each with an area of 150 square meters. How many such plots can the farmer create?

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We have a rectangular field with dimensions 100 meters (length) and 60 meters (width).
   - The total area of the field is calculated by multiplying the length and width.

2. **Calculate the Total Area of the Field:**
   \[
   \text{Total Area} = \text{Length} \times \text{Width} = 100 \, \text{meters} \times 60 \, \text{meters} = 6000 \, \text{square meters}
   \]

3. **Determine the Area of Each Plot:**
   - Each plot has an area of 150 square meters.

4. **Calculate the Number of Plots:**
   - To find out how many plots of 150 square meters can fit into the total area, divide the total area by the area of one plot.
   \[
   \text{Number of Plots} = \frac{\text{Total Area}}{\text{Area of One Plot}} = \frac{6000 \, \text{square meters}}{150 \, \text{square meters}}
   \]

5. **Perform the Division:**
   \[
   \frac{6000}{150} = 40
   \]

6. **Conclusion:**
   - The farmer can create 40 plots, each with an area of 150 square meters, from the rectangular field.

### Final Answer:
The farmer can create 40 plots, each with an area of 150 square meters.
