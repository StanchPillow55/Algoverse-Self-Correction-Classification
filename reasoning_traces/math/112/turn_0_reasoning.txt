To solve the problem, we need to determine how many photos Lilah's family took during their trip to the Grand Canyon and then add those photos to the existing number of photos in the gallery.

1. **Determine the number of photos taken on the first day:**
   - The family has 400 photos in their gallery.
   - On the first day of the trip, they took half as many photos as they have in the gallery.
   - Therefore, the number of photos taken on the first day is:
     \[
     \text{Photos on first day} = \frac{400}{2} = 200
     \]

2. **Determine the number of photos taken on the second day:**
   - On the second day, they took 120 more photos than they took on the first day.
   - Thus, the number of photos taken on the second day is:
     \[
     \text{Photos on second day} = 200 + 120 = 320
     \]

3. **Calculate the total number of photos taken during the trip:**
   - To find the total number of photos taken over the two days, we add the photos taken on both days:
     \[
     \text{Total photos taken} = \text{Photos on first day} + \text{Photos on second day} = 200 + 320 = 520
     \]

4. **Calculate the new total number of photos in the gallery:**
   - To find the new total number of photos in the gallery after adding the photos taken during the trip, we add the total photos taken to the original number of photos in the gallery:
     \[
     \text{New total in gallery} = \text{Original photos} + \text{Total photos taken} = 400 + 520 = 920
     \]

Thus, the total number of photos in the gallery after the trip is:

\[
\boxed{920}
\]
