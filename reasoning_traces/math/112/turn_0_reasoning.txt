To solve this problem, we need to determine how many photos Lilah's family took during their two-day trip to the Grand Canyon and then add these photos to the existing photos in the family gallery.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Determine the number of photos taken on the first day:**

   The problem states that on the first day, they took half as many photos as they have in the family's gallery. The family gallery initially has 400 photos.

   \[
   \text{Photos on the first day} = \frac{1}{2} \times 400 = 200
   \]

2. **Determine the number of photos taken on the second day:**

   The problem states that on the second day, they took 120 more photos than they took on the first day.

   \[
   \text{Photos on the second day} = 200 + 120 = 320
   \]

3. **Calculate the total number of photos taken during the trip:**

   To find the total number of photos taken during the two-day trip, we add the photos taken on the first day and the second day.

   \[
   \text{Total photos taken} = 200 + 320 = 520
   \]

4. **Calculate the new total number of photos in the family gallery:**

   The total number of photos in the gallery after adding the photos from the trip is the sum of the initial number of photos in the gallery and the total number of photos taken during the trip.

   \[
   \text{New total in gallery} = 400 + 520 = 920
   \]

### Final Answer:

The total number of photos in the family gallery after adding the photos from the trip is \(\boxed{920}\).
