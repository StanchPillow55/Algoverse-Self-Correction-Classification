==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine how many photos Lilah's family took during their two-day trip to the Grand Canyon and then add these photos to the existing number of photos in the family gallery.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Determine the Number of Photos Taken on the First Day:**

   The problem states that on the first day, they took half as many photos as they have in the family's gallery. The family gallery initially has 400 photos.

   \[
   \text{Photos on the first day} = \frac{1}{2} \times 400 = 200
   \]

2. **Determine the Number of Photos Taken on the Second Day:**

   On the second day, they took 120 more photos than they took on the first day. We already calculated that they took 200 photos on the first day.

   \[
   \text{Photos on the second day} = 200 + 120 = 320
   \]

3. **Calculate the Total Number of Photos Taken During the Trip:**

   To find the total number of photos taken during the two-day trip, we add the number of photos taken on each day.

   \[
   \text{Total photos taken on the trip} = 200 + 320 = 520
   \]

4. **Calculate the New Total Number of Photos in the Gallery:**

   Finally, we add the total number of photos taken during the trip to the initial number of photos in the gallery.

   \[
   \text{New total number of photos in the gallery} = 400 + 520 = 920
   \]

### Conclusion:

After adding all the photos taken during the trip to the family gallery, the total number of photos in the gallery is **920**.

Thus, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{920}
\]
