To solve this problem, we need to determine how many photos Lilah's family took during their two-day trip to the Grand Canyon and then add these photos to the existing number of photos in the family gallery.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Determine the number of photos taken on the first day:**
   - The problem states that on the first day, they took half as many photos as they have in the family's gallery.
   - The family gallery initially has 400 photos.
   - Therefore, the number of photos taken on the first day is:
     \[
     \text{Photos on the first day} = \frac{1}{2} \times 400 = 200
     \]

2. **Determine the number of photos taken on the second day:**
   - The problem states that on the second day, they took 120 more photos than they took on the first day.
   - We already calculated that they took 200 photos on the first day.
   - Therefore, the number of photos taken on the second day is:
     \[
     \text{Photos on the second day} = 200 + 120 = 320
     \]

3. **Calculate the total number of photos taken during the trip:**
   - To find the total number of photos taken during the two-day trip, we add the photos from both days:
     \[
     \text{Total photos from the trip} = 200 + 320 = 520
     \]

4. **Calculate the new total number of photos in the family gallery:**
   - Initially, the family gallery had 400 photos.
   - They added the 520 photos taken during the trip to the gallery.
   - Therefore, the new total number of photos in the gallery is:
     \[
     \text{Total photos in the gallery} = 400 + 520 = 920
     \]

Thus, after adding the photos from the trip, the total number of photos in the family gallery is \(\boxed{920}\).
