==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine how many photos Lilah's family took during their two-day trip to the Grand Canyon and then add these to the existing number of photos in the family gallery.

**Step 1: Determine the number of photos taken on the first day.**

The problem states that on the first day, they took half as many photos as they have in the family's gallery. The family gallery initially has 400 photos.

\[
\text{Photos on the first day} = \frac{1}{2} \times 400 = 200
\]

**Step 2: Determine the number of photos taken on the second day.**

On the second day, they took 120 more photos than they did on the first day. We already calculated that they took 200 photos on the first day.

\[
\text{Photos on the second day} = 200 + 120 = 320
\]

**Step 3: Calculate the total number of photos taken during the trip.**

To find the total number of photos taken during the two-day trip, we add the number of photos taken on each day.

\[
\text{Total photos during the trip} = 200 + 320 = 520
\]

**Step 4: Calculate the new total number of photos in the family gallery.**

The family gallery initially had 400 photos. After adding the 520 photos taken during the trip, the new total number of photos in the gallery is:

\[
\text{New total in gallery} = 400 + 520 = 920
\]

**Final Answer:**

The total number of photos in the family gallery after adding the photos from the trip is 920.
