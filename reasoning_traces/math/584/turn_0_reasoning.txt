To solve the problem, we will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total cost of 2 boxes of contacts after the discount.**
2. **Determine the total number of contacts in 2 boxes.**
3. **Calculate the cost per pair of contacts.**

### Step 1: Calculate the total cost of 2 boxes of contacts after the discount.

The original price of one box of contacts is $100.00. Since there is a 10% discount, we first need to calculate the discount amount.

**Discount Calculation:**
\[
\text{Discount} = \text{Original Price} \times \text{Discount Rate} = 100 \times 0.10 = 10
\]

Now, we subtract the discount from the original price to find the sale price of one box.

**Sale Price Calculation:**
\[
\text{Sale Price} = \text{Original Price} - \text{Discount} = 100 - 10 = 90
\]

Now, we calculate the total cost for 2 boxes.

**Total Cost for 2 Boxes:**
\[
\text{Total Cost} = \text{Sale Price} \times 2 = 90 \times 2 = 180
\]

### Step 2: Determine the total number of contacts in 2 boxes.

Each box contains 90 single-use contacts. Therefore, for 2 boxes, the total number of contacts is:

**Total Contacts Calculation:**
\[
\text{Total Contacts} = 90 \times 2 = 180
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the cost per pair of contacts.

A pair of contacts consists of 2 contacts. To find the number of pairs in 180 contacts, we divide the total number of contacts by 2.

**Number of Pairs Calculation:**
\[
\text{Number of Pairs} = \frac{\text{Total Contacts}}{2} = \frac{180}{2} = 90
\]

Now, we can find the cost per pair of contacts by dividing the total cost by the number of pairs.

**Cost per Pair Calculation:**
\[
\text{Cost per Pair} = \frac{\text{Total Cost}}{\text{Number of Pairs}} = \frac{180}{90} = 2
\]

### Final Answer

The cost of each pair of contacts is **$2.00**.
