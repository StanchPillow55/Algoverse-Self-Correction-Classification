==================================================

To solve "Sample math problem 196," we first need to understand what the problem is asking. However, since the problem statement is not provided, I'll demonstrate a general approach to solving math problems by assuming a typical math problem scenario. Let's assume "Sample math problem 196" involves solving a quadratic equation, which is a common type of math problem.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

**Problem Statement:**
Solve the quadratic equation: \( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \).

For this example, let's assume the quadratic equation is:
\[ 2x^2 + 3x - 5 = 0 \]

**Step 1: Identify the coefficients.**
- \( a = 2 \)
- \( b = 3 \)
- \( c = -5 \)

**Step 2: Use the quadratic formula.**
The quadratic formula is given by:
\[ x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the discriminant.**
The discriminant (\( \Delta \)) is:
\[ \Delta = b^2 - 4ac \]
\[ \Delta = 3^2 - 4 \times 2 \times (-5) \]
\[ \Delta = 9 + 40 \]
\[ \Delta = 49 \]

**Step 4: Determine the nature of the roots.**
Since the discriminant is positive (\( \Delta = 49 \)), the quadratic equation has two distinct real roots.

**Step 5: Calculate the roots using the quadratic formula.**
\[ x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{\Delta}}{2a} \]
\[ x = \frac{-3 \pm \sqrt{49}}{4} \]
\[ x = \frac{-3 \pm 7}{4} \]

**Step 6: Solve for the two possible values of \( x \).**
1. \( x_1 = \frac{-3 + 7}{4} \)
   \[ x_1 = \frac{4}{4} \]
   \[ x_1 = 1 \]

2. \( x_2 = \frac{-3 - 7}{4} \)
   \[ x_2 = \frac{-10}{4} \]
   \[ x_2 = -\frac{5}{2} \]

**Final Answer:**
The solutions to the quadratic equation \( 2x^2 + 3x - 5 = 0 \) are \( x = 1 \) and \( x = -\frac{5}{2} \).

This is a complete solution to a typical quadratic equation problem. If "Sample math problem 196" refers to a different problem, please provide the specific details or context, and I'll be happy to solve it accordingly.
