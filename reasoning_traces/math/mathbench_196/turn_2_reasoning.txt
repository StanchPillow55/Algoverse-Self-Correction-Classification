Question ID: mathbench_196
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve "Sample math problem 196," we need to first understand what the problem entails. Since the problem is not explicitly stated, I'll assume a hypothetical math problem labeled as "Sample math problem 196" and solve it step by step.

Let's assume "Sample math problem 196" is as follows:

**Problem Statement:**
Calculate the sum of the first 196 positive integers.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   We need to find the sum of the first 196 positive integers. The sequence of the first 196 positive integers is: 1, 2, 3, ..., 196.

2. **Identify the Formula:**
   The sum of the first \( n \) positive integers can be calculated using the formula:
   \[
   S_n = \frac{n(n + 1)}{2}
   \]
   where \( S_n \) is the sum of the first \( n \) integers.

3. **Substitute the Given Value:**
   Here, \( n = 196 \). Substitute 196 into the formula:
   \[
   S_{196} = \frac{196(196 + 1)}{2}
   \]

4. **Perform the Calculations:**
   - First, calculate \( 196 + 1 \):
     \[
     196 + 1 = 197
     \]
   - Next, multiply 196 by 197:
     \[
     196 \times 197 = 38612
     \]
   - Finally, divide the product by 2 to find the sum:
     \[
     S_{196} = \frac{38612}{2} = 19306
     \]

5. **Conclusion:**
   The sum of the first 196 positive integers is 19,306.

**Final Answer:**
The sum of the first 196 positive integers is 19,306.
