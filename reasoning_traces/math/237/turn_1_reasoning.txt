==================================================

To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step and use algebra to represent the relationships between the number of eggs gathered by Tank and Emma.

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( T_1 \) be the number of eggs Tank gathered in the first round.
   - Let \( E_1 \) be the number of eggs Emma gathered in the first round.
   - Let \( T_2 \) be the number of eggs Tank gathered in the second round.
   - Let \( E_2 \) be the number of eggs Emma gathered in the second round.

2. **Set Up Equations Based on the Problem Statement:**
   - From the problem, we know:
     - In the first round, Tank gathered 10 more eggs than Emma:
       \[
       T_1 = E_1 + 10
       \]
     - In the second round, Emma gathered twice as many eggs as Tank:
       \[
       E_2 = 2T_2
       \]
     - Tank's total number of eggs in the second round was 20 less than the number Emma gathered in the first round:
       \[
       T_2 = E_1 - 20
       \]
     - We also know that Emma gathered 60 eggs in the second round:
       \[
       E_2 = 60
       \]

3. **Substituting Known Values:**
   - From \( E_2 = 60 \) and \( E_2 = 2T_2 \), we can find \( T_2 \):
     \[
     60 = 2T_2 \implies T_2 = \frac{60}{2} = 30
     \]

4. **Finding \( E_1 \):**
   - Now substitute \( T_2 = 30 \) into the equation \( T_2 = E_1 - 20 \):
     \[
     30 = E_1 - 20 \implies E_1 = 30 + 20 = 50
     \]

5. **Finding \( T_1 \):**
   - Now substitute \( E_1 = 50 \) into the equation \( T_1 = E_1 + 10 \):
     \[
     T_1 = 50 + 10 = 60
     \]

6. **Calculating Total Eggs Gathered by Tank and Emma:**
   - Total eggs gathered by Tank and Emma:
     \[
     \text{Total by Tank} = T_1 + T_2 = 60 + 30 = 90
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total by Emma} = E_1 + E_2 = 50 + 60 = 110
     \]
   - Total eggs gathered by Tank and Emma together:
     \[
     \text{Total by Tank and Emma} = 90 + 110 = 200
     \]

7. **Finding the Number of Eggs Collected by the 6 Other Egg Hunters:**
   - The total number of eggs collected by all participants (including Tank, Emma, and 6 others) is 400 eggs. Therefore, the number of eggs collected by the 6 other egg hunters is:
     \[
     \text{Eggs by 6 others} = 400 - \text{Total by Tank and Emma} = 400 - 200 = 200
     \]

8. **Final Answer:**
   - The number of eggs that the 6 other egg hunters collected is \( \boxed{200} \).
