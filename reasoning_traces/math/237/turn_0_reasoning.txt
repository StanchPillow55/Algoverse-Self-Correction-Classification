==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine how many eggs the 6 other egg hunters collected. We will use the information given to set up equations and solve for the unknowns.

Let's define the variables:
- Let \( T_1 \) be the number of eggs Tank collected in the first round.
- Let \( E_1 \) be the number of eggs Emma collected in the first round.
- Let \( T_2 \) be the number of eggs Tank collected in the second round.
- Let \( E_2 \) be the number of eggs Emma collected in the second round.

From the problem, we have the following information:
1. Tank gathered 10 more eggs than Emma in the first round:
   \[
   T_1 = E_1 + 10
   \]

2. Emma gathered twice as many eggs as Tank in the second round:
   \[
   E_2 = 2T_2
   \]

3. Tank's total number of eggs in the second round was 20 less than the number she had gathered in the first round:
   \[
   T_2 = T_1 - 20
   \]

4. Emma gathered 60 eggs in the second round:
   \[
   E_2 = 60
   \]

5. The total number of eggs collected by all 8 people (Tank, Emma, and 6 others) is 400:
   \[
   T_1 + E_1 + T_2 + E_2 + X = 400
   \]
   where \( X \) is the number of eggs collected by the 6 other egg hunters.

Now, let's solve these equations step by step:

From equation (4), we know:
\[
E_2 = 60
\]

Substitute \( E_2 = 60 \) into equation (2):
\[
60 = 2T_2 \implies T_2 = \frac{60}{2} = 30
\]

Now we know \( T_2 = 30 \). Substitute \( T_2 = 30 \) into equation (3):
\[
T_2 = T_1 - 20 \implies 30 = T_1 - 20 \implies T_1 = 30 + 20 = 50
\]

Now we know \( T_1 = 50 \). Substitute \( T_1 = 50 \) into equation (1):
\[
T_1 = E_1 + 10 \implies 50 = E_1 + 10 \implies E_1 = 50 - 10 = 40
\]

Now we have:
- \( T_1 = 50 \)
- \( E_1 = 40 \)
- \( T_2 = 30 \)
- \( E_2 = 60 \)

Substitute these values into the total equation:
\[
T_1 + E_1 + T_2 + E_2 + X = 400
\]
\[
50 + 40 + 30 + 60 + X = 400
\]
\[
180 + X = 400
\]
\[
X = 400 - 180 = 220
\]

Therefore, the number of eggs that the 6 other egg hunters collected is \(\boxed{220}\).
