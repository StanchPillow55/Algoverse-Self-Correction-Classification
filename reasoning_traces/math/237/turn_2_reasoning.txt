Question ID: 237
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we will break it down into parts and use algebra to represent the relationships between the number of eggs gathered by Tank and Emma.

1. **Define Variables**:
   - Let \( T_1 \) be the number of eggs Tank gathered in the first round.
   - Let \( E_1 \) be the number of eggs Emma gathered in the first round.
   - Let \( T_2 \) be the number of eggs Tank gathered in the second round.
   - Let \( E_2 \) be the number of eggs Emma gathered in the second round.

2. **Set Up Equations Based on the Problem Statement**:
   - From the problem, we know:
     - In the first round, Tank gathered 10 more eggs than Emma:
       \[
       T_1 = E_1 + 10 \quad \text{(1)}
       \]
     - In the second round, Emma gathered twice as many eggs as Tank:
       \[
       E_2 = 2T_2 \quad \text{(2)}
       \]
     - Tank's total number of eggs in the second round was 20 less than the number Emma gathered in the first round:
       \[
       T_2 = E_1 - 20 \quad \text{(3)}
       \]
     - We know from the problem that Emma gathered 60 eggs in the second round:
       \[
       E_2 = 60 \quad \text{(4)}
       \]

3. **Substituting Known Values**:
   - From equation (4), we can substitute \( E_2 \) into equation (2):
     \[
     60 = 2T_2 \implies T_2 = \frac{60}{2} = 30 \quad \text{(5)}
     \]

4. **Using Equation (5) in Equation (3)**:
   - Now we substitute \( T_2 \) from equation (5) into equation (3):
     \[
     30 = E_1 - 20 \implies E_1 = 30 + 20 = 50 \quad \text{(6)}
     \]

5. **Finding Tank's First Round Eggs**:
   - Now we can substitute \( E_1 \) from equation (6) into equation (1):
     \[
     T_1 = 50 + 10 = 60 \quad \text{(7)}
     \]

6. **Total Eggs Gathered by Tank and Emma**:
   - Now we have:
     - \( T_1 = 60 \)
     - \( E_1 = 50 \)
     - \( T_2 = 30 \)
     - \( E_2 = 60 \)

   - The total number of eggs gathered by Tank and Emma is:
     \[
     \text{Total by Tank} = T_1 + T_2 = 60 + 30 = 90
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total by Emma} = E_1 + E_2 = 50 + 60 = 110
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total by Tank and Emma} = 90 + 110 = 200
     \]

7. **Finding the Number of Eggs Collected by the Other 6 Hunters**:
   - The total number of eggs collected by all participants (including Tank, Emma, and 6 others) is 400 eggs.
   - Therefore, the number of eggs collected by the other 6 hunters is:
     \[
     \text{Total by 6 others} = 400 - 200 = 200
     \]

8. **Final Answer**:
   - The number of eggs that the 6 other egg hunters collected is \( \boxed{200} \).
