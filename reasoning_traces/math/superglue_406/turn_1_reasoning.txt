==================================================

To solve the problem, we first need to understand what "Sample reasoning question 406" entails. Since the problem statement is not explicitly provided, I'll demonstrate a general approach to solving a reasoning-based math problem by creating a hypothetical example and solving it step by step.

Let's assume "Sample reasoning question 406" involves a typical math reasoning problem, such as:

**Problem:**  
A train travels from City A to City B at a speed of 60 miles per hour. On the return trip from City B to City A, the train travels at a speed of 40 miles per hour. If the total travel time for the round trip is 5 hours, what is the distance between City A and City B?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( d \) be the distance between City A and City B in miles.
   - The time taken to travel from City A to City B is \( \frac{d}{60} \) hours.
   - The time taken to travel from City B to City A is \( \frac{d}{40} \) hours.

2. **Set Up the Equation:**
   - The total travel time for the round trip is given as 5 hours. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
     \[
     \frac{d}{60} + \frac{d}{40} = 5
     \]

3. **Find a Common Denominator:**
   - The common denominator for 60 and 40 is 120. Rewrite the equation with this common denominator:
     \[
     \frac{2d}{120} + \frac{3d}{120} = 5
     \]

4. **Combine the Fractions:**
   - Combine the fractions on the left side:
     \[
     \frac{2d + 3d}{120} = 5
     \]
     \[
     \frac{5d}{120} = 5
     \]

5. **Solve for \( d \):**
   - Multiply both sides by 120 to eliminate the fraction:
     \[
     5d = 5 \times 120
     \]
     \[
     5d = 600
     \]
   - Divide both sides by 5 to solve for \( d \):
     \[
     d = \frac{600}{5}
     \]
     \[
     d = 120
     \]

6. **Conclusion:**
   - The distance between City A and City B is 120 miles.

**Final Answer:**  
The distance between City A and City B is 120 miles.

This example illustrates how to approach a reasoning-based math problem by defining variables, setting up equations, and solving step by step. If "Sample reasoning question 406" refers to a different problem, please provide additional details for a more specific solution.
