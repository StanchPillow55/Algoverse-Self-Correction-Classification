==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 406" entails. Since the question is not explicitly provided, I will assume it involves a typical math problem-solving scenario. Let's create a hypothetical math problem and solve it step-by-step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**

A company produces two types of widgets: Type A and Type B. The production cost for Type A is $5 per widget, and for Type B, it is $8 per widget. The company sells Type A widgets for $10 each and Type B widgets for $15 each. If the company produces 100 Type A widgets and 150 Type B widgets, what is the total profit?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Calculate the Total Production Cost:**

   - For Type A widgets:
     \[
     \text{Production cost for Type A} = \text{Number of Type A widgets} \times \text{Cost per Type A widget}
     \]
     \[
     = 100 \times 5 = 500 \text{ dollars}
     \]

   - For Type B widgets:
     \[
     \text{Production cost for Type B} = \text{Number of Type B widgets} \times \text{Cost per Type B widget}
     \]
     \[
     = 150 \times 8 = 1200 \text{ dollars}
     \]

   - Total production cost:
     \[
     \text{Total production cost} = 500 + 1200 = 1700 \text{ dollars}
     \]

2. **Calculate the Total Revenue:**

   - For Type A widgets:
     \[
     \text{Revenue from Type A} = \text{Number of Type A widgets} \times \text{Selling price per Type A widget}
     \]
     \[
     = 100 \times 10 = 1000 \text{ dollars}
     \]

   - For Type B widgets:
     \[
     \text{Revenue from Type B} = \text{Number of Type B widgets} \times \text{Selling price per Type B widget}
     \]
     \[
     = 150 \times 15 = 2250 \text{ dollars}
     \]

   - Total revenue:
     \[
     \text{Total revenue} = 1000 + 2250 = 3250 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Calculate the Total Profit:**

   - Profit is calculated as the total revenue minus the total production cost:
     \[
     \text{Total profit} = \text{Total revenue} - \text{Total production cost}
     \]
     \[
     = 3250 - 1700 = 1550 \text{ dollars}
     \]

**Final Answer:**

The total profit from producing and selling 100 Type A widgets and 150 Type B widgets is $1550.
