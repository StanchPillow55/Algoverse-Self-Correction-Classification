==================================================

It seems like there might be a misunderstanding or a missing component in your question. "Sample reasoning question 406" does not provide enough information for me to solve a specific math problem. However, I can guide you through a general approach to solving math problems by using a structured reasoning process. If you have a specific math problem, please provide the details, and I'll be happy to help.

Here's a general approach to solving math problems:

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - Read the problem carefully.
   - Identify what is being asked.
   - Determine what information is given and what needs to be found.

2. **Devise a Plan:**
   - Consider possible strategies to solve the problem (e.g., drawing a diagram, creating an equation, using logical reasoning).
   - Choose the strategy that seems most appropriate for the problem.

3. **Carry Out the Plan:**
   - Execute the chosen strategy step by step.
   - Perform calculations carefully and check each step for accuracy.
   - Keep track of units and ensure consistency.

4. **Review/Check Your Work:**
   - Verify that the solution makes sense in the context of the problem.
   - Double-check calculations and logic.
   - Consider whether there is another method to solve the problem and compare results.

5. **State the Final Answer:**
   - Clearly write down the final answer, including units if applicable.
   - Ensure the answer addresses the question that was asked.

If you provide a specific math problem, I can apply this structured approach to solve it and show all the work and reasoning involved.
