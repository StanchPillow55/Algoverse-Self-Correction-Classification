To solve this problem, we need to determine how many dog cookies Basil consumes in one day and then calculate how many cookies she will need for 30 days. Finally, we will determine how many boxes of cookies are required.

**Step 1: Calculate the daily cookie consumption**

1. **Morning consumption:**
   Basil gets \( \frac{1}{2} \) of a cookie in the morning.

2. **Daytime consumption:**
   Basil gets 2 whole cookies during the day.

3. **Evening consumption:**
   Basil gets \( \frac{1}{2} \) of a cookie before bed.

Now, add up all the cookies Basil consumes in one day:
\[
\text{Total daily consumption} = \frac{1}{2} \text{ (morning)} + 2 \text{ (daytime)} + \frac{1}{2} \text{ (evening)}
\]

\[
= \frac{1}{2} + 2 + \frac{1}{2}
\]

\[
= \frac{1}{2} + \frac{4}{2} + \frac{1}{2}
\]

\[
= \frac{1 + 4 + 1}{2}
\]

\[
= \frac{6}{2}
\]

\[
= 3 \text{ cookies per day}
\]

**Step 2: Calculate the total cookie consumption for 30 days**

Now that we know Basil eats 3 cookies per day, we can calculate the total number of cookies she needs for 30 days:
\[
\text{Total cookies for 30 days} = 3 \text{ cookies/day} \times 30 \text{ days}
\]

\[
= 90 \text{ cookies}
\]

**Step 3: Determine how many boxes are needed**

Each box contains 45 cookies. To find out how many boxes are needed, we divide the total number of cookies by the number of cookies per box:
\[
\text{Number of boxes} = \frac{90 \text{ cookies}}{45 \text{ cookies/box}}
\]

\[
= 2 \text{ boxes}
\]

Therefore, Basil will need 2 boxes of cookies to last for 30 days.

**Final Answer:**
Basil will need 2 boxes of cookies to last for 30 days.
