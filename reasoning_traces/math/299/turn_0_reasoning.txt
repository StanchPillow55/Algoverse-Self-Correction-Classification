To determine how many boxes of cookies Basil will need to last her for 30 days, we first need to calculate the total number of cookies she consumes in a day.

1. **Calculate daily cookie consumption:**
   - In the morning, Basil gets \( \frac{1}{2} \) of a cookie.
   - Before bed, she gets another \( \frac{1}{2} \) of a cookie.
   - During the day, she gets 2 whole cookies.

   Now, let's add these amounts together:

   \[
   \text{Total cookies per day} = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2} + 2
   \]

   The two halves add up to 1:

   \[
   \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2} = 1
   \]

   Therefore, the total cookie consumption per day is:

   \[
   1 + 2 = 3 \text{ cookies}
   \]

2. **Calculate total cookie consumption for 30 days:**
   Now, we need to find out how many cookies Basil will consume over 30 days:

   \[
   \text{Total cookies in 30 days} = 3 \text{ cookies/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 90 \text{ cookies}
   \]

3. **Determine how many boxes are needed:**
   Each box contains 45 cookies. To find out how many boxes Basil needs, we divide the total number of cookies by the number of cookies per box:

   \[
   \text{Number of boxes needed} = \frac{90 \text{ cookies}}{45 \text{ cookies/box}} = 2
   \]

Thus, Basil will need **2 boxes** of cookies to last her for 30 days.

**Final Answer: 2 boxes**
