==================================================

To determine how much John pays for the driving service each year, we need to calculate both the cost of the mileage and the monthly bonus he gives to the driver. Let's break this down step by step.

### Step 1: Calculate the total distance traveled per day

John's work is 30 miles away, and he travels to work and back home each day. Therefore, the total distance traveled in one day is:

\[
\text{Total distance per day} = \text{Distance to work} + \text{Distance back home} = 30 \text{ miles} + 30 \text{ miles} = 60 \text{ miles}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the total distance traveled per week

John goes to work 5 days a week. Thus, the total distance traveled in one week is:

\[
\text{Total distance per week} = \text{Total distance per day} \times \text{Number of days per week} = 60 \text{ miles/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = 300 \text{ miles/week}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the total distance traveled per year

John works for 50 weeks a year. Therefore, the total distance traveled in one year is:

\[
\text{Total distance per year} = \text{Total distance per week} \times \text{Number of weeks per year} = 300 \text{ miles/week} \times 50 \text{ weeks/year} = 15,000 \text{ miles/year}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the cost of mileage per year

The driving service charges $2 per mile. To find the total cost for mileage in a year, we multiply the total distance traveled by the cost per mile:

\[
\text{Cost of mileage per year} = \text{Total distance per year} \times \text{Cost per mile} = 15,000 \text{ miles/year} \times 2 \text{ dollars/mile} = 30,000 \text{ dollars/year}
\]

### Step 5: Calculate the total bonus paid per year

John gives his driver a $150 bonus per month. To find the total bonus paid in a year, we multiply the monthly bonus by the number of months in a year (12):

\[
\text{Total bonus per year} = \text{Monthly bonus} \times \text{Number of months per year} = 150 \text{ dollars/month} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 1,800 \text{ dollars/year}
\]

### Step 6: Calculate the total cost for driving per year

Finally, we add the total cost of mileage and the total bonus to find the total amount John pays for driving in a year:

\[
\text{Total cost per year} = \text{Cost of mileage per year} + \text{Total bonus per year} = 30,000 \text{ dollars/year} + 1,800 \text{ dollars/year} = 31,800 \text{ dollars/year}
\]

### Final Answer

Thus, the total amount John pays for driving each year is:

\[
\boxed{31,800 \text{ dollars}}
\]
