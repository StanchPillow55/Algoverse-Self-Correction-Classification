==================================================

To determine how many boxes of dog cookies Basil will need for 30 days, we need to calculate the total number of cookies she consumes in one day and then extend that to 30 days. Finally, we will determine how many boxes are required based on the number of cookies per box.

**Step 1: Calculate the daily cookie consumption**

1. **Morning and Night Consumption:**
   - Basil gets \( \frac{1}{2} \) of a cookie in the morning.
   - Basil gets \( \frac{1}{2} \) of a cookie before bed.
   - Total for morning and night: 
     \[
     \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2} = 1 \text{ cookie}
     \]

2. **Daytime Consumption:**
   - Basil gets 2 whole cookies during the day.

3. **Total Daily Consumption:**
   - Total cookies per day:
     \[
     1 \text{ (morning and night)} + 2 \text{ (daytime)} = 3 \text{ cookies}
     \]

**Step 2: Calculate the total consumption for 30 days**

- Total cookies for 30 days:
  \[
  3 \text{ cookies/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 90 \text{ cookies}
  \]

**Step 3: Determine the number of boxes needed**

- Each box contains 45 cookies.
- Number of boxes needed:
  \[
  \frac{90 \text{ cookies}}{45 \text{ cookies/box}} = 2 \text{ boxes}
  \]

Therefore, Basil will need 2 boxes of cookies to last for 30 days.

**Final Answer:**
Basil will need 2 boxes of cookies to last for 30 days.
