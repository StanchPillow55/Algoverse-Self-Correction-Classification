To calculate how much John pays for the driving service each year, we need to break down the costs into two components: the cost per mile and the monthly bonus for the driver.

### Step 1: Calculate the total distance driven per day
John's work is 30 miles away, and he travels to work and back home each day. Therefore, the total distance driven per day is:

\[
\text{Total distance per day} = \text{Distance to work} + \text{Distance back home} = 30 \text{ miles} + 30 \text{ miles} = 60 \text{ miles}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the total distance driven per week
John goes to work 5 days a week, so the total distance driven per week is:

\[
\text{Total distance per week} = \text{Total distance per day} \times \text{Number of days per week} = 60 \text{ miles} \times 5 = 300 \text{ miles}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the total distance driven per year
John works for 50 weeks a year, so the total distance driven per year is:

\[
\text{Total distance per year} = \text{Total distance per week} \times \text{Number of weeks per year} = 300 \text{ miles} \times 50 = 15,000 \text{ miles}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the cost for the miles driven
The driving service charges $2 per mile. Therefore, the total cost for the miles driven per year is:

\[
\text{Cost for miles driven} = \text{Total distance per year} \times \text{Cost per mile} = 15,000 \text{ miles} \times 2 \text{ dollars/mile} = 30,000 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Step 5: Calculate the total bonus paid to the driver
John gives his driver a $150 bonus per month. To find the total bonus paid over the year, we need to multiply the monthly bonus by the number of months in a year (12):

\[
\text{Total bonus per year} = \text{Monthly bonus} \times \text{Number of months} = 150 \text{ dollars/month} \times 12 \text{ months} = 1,800 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Step 6: Calculate the total cost for driving per year
Now, we can find the total amount John pays for driving in a year by adding the cost for miles driven and the total bonus:

\[
\text{Total cost per year} = \text{Cost for miles driven} + \text{Total bonus per year} = 30,000 \text{ dollars} + 1,800 \text{ dollars} = 31,800 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Final Answer
Thus, the total amount John pays for driving each year is:

\[
\boxed{31,800 \text{ dollars}}
\]
