==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine how many dog cookies Basil consumes in one day and then calculate how many cookies she will need for 30 days. Finally, we'll determine how many boxes of cookies are required.

**Step 1: Calculate the daily cookie consumption.**

- In the morning, Basil gets \( \frac{1}{2} \) of a cookie.
- Before bed, she gets another \( \frac{1}{2} \) of a cookie.
- During the day, she gets 2 whole cookies.

Let's add these amounts together to find the total daily consumption:

\[
\text{Morning cookies} = \frac{1}{2}
\]
\[
\text{Evening cookies} = \frac{1}{2}
\]
\[
\text{Daytime cookies} = 2
\]

Total daily consumption:
\[
\frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{2} + 2 = 1 + 2 = 3 \text{ cookies per day}
\]

**Step 2: Calculate the total cookie consumption for 30 days.**

Now that we know Basil eats 3 cookies per day, we can calculate her consumption over 30 days:

\[
3 \text{ cookies/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 90 \text{ cookies}
\]

**Step 3: Determine how many boxes are needed.**

Each box contains 45 cookies. To find out how many boxes are needed for 90 cookies, we divide the total number of cookies by the number of cookies per box:

\[
\frac{90 \text{ cookies}}{45 \text{ cookies/box}} = 2 \text{ boxes}
\]

Therefore, Basil will need 2 boxes of cookies to last for 30 days.

**Final Answer:**
Basil will need 2 boxes of cookies to last for 30 days.
