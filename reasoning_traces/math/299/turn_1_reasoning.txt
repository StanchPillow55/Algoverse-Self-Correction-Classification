To determine how many boxes of dog cookies Basil will need to last for 30 days, we need to calculate her daily cookie consumption and then scale it up to 30 days. Finally, we'll determine how many boxes are required based on the number of cookies per box.

**Step 1: Calculate Basil's daily cookie consumption.**

- In the morning, Basil gets \( \frac{1}{2} \) of a cookie.
- Before bed, she gets another \( \frac{1}{2} \) of a cookie.
- During the day, she receives 2 whole cookies.

Let's add these amounts together to find the total number of cookies Basil consumes in one day:

\[
\frac{1}{2} \text{ (morning)} + \frac{1}{2} \text{ (before bed)} + 2 \text{ (during the day)} = 1 + 2 = 3 \text{ cookies per day}
\]

**Step 2: Calculate the total number of cookies needed for 30 days.**

Now that we know Basil eats 3 cookies per day, we can calculate her total consumption over 30 days:

\[
3 \text{ cookies/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 90 \text{ cookies}
\]

**Step 3: Determine how many boxes are needed.**

Basil's cookies are packaged with 45 cookies per box. To find out how many boxes are needed, we divide the total number of cookies by the number of cookies per box:

\[
\frac{90 \text{ cookies}}{45 \text{ cookies/box}} = 2 \text{ boxes}
\]

Thus, Basil will need 2 boxes of cookies to last for 30 days.

**Final Answer:**

Basil will need 2 boxes of cookies to last for 30 days.
