==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to calculate the total cost of the coffee and the donut that Roger buys.

1. **Calculate the cost of the more expensive coffee:**
   - The normal brand of coffee costs $5 per pound.
   - The more expensive brand costs 20% more than the normal brand.
   - First, we calculate 20% of $5:
     \[
     20\% \text{ of } 5 = 0.20 \times 5 = 1
     \]
   - Now, we add this amount to the normal price to find the cost of the more expensive coffee:
     \[
     \text{Cost of more expensive coffee} = 5 + 1 = 6 \text{ dollars per pound}
     \]

2. **Determine how much coffee Roger needs for a week:**
   - Roger uses 1 pound of coffee per day.
   - For a week (7 days), he needs:
     \[
     1 \text{ pound/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 7 \text{ pounds}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total cost of the coffee:**
   - Now we multiply the cost of the more expensive coffee by the amount he needs:
     \[
     \text{Total cost of coffee} = 7 \text{ pounds} \times 6 \text{ dollars/pound} = 42 \text{ dollars}
     \]

4. **Calculate the cost of the donut:**
   - The donut costs $2.

5. **Calculate the total cost of everything:**
   - We add the total cost of the coffee and the cost of the donut:
     \[
     \text{Total cost} = \text{Total cost of coffee} + \text{Cost of donut} = 42 + 2 = 44 \text{ dollars}
     \]

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{44}
\]
