Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To find the total cost of Roger's purchases, we will break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate the cost of the more expensive coffee:**
   - The normal brand of coffee costs $5 per pound.
   - The more expensive brand costs 20% more than the normal brand.
   - To find the cost of the more expensive brand, we calculate 20% of $5:
     \[
     20\% \text{ of } 5 = 0.20 \times 5 = 1
     \]
   - Therefore, the cost of the more expensive brand is:
     \[
     5 + 1 = 6 \text{ dollars per pound}
     \]

2. **Determine how much coffee Roger needs for a week:**
   - Roger uses 1 pound of coffee per day.
   - For a week (7 days), he needs:
     \[
     1 \text{ pound/day} \times 7 \text{ days} = 7 \text{ pounds}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total cost of the coffee:**
   - The cost for 7 pounds of the more expensive coffee is:
     \[
     7 \text{ pounds} \times 6 \text{ dollars/pound} = 42 \text{ dollars}
     \]

4. **Add the cost of the donut:**
   - The donut costs $2.
   - Therefore, the total cost for the coffee and the donut is:
     \[
     42 \text{ dollars} + 2 \text{ dollars} = 44 \text{ dollars}
     \]

5. **Final answer:**
   - The total cost of everything Roger bought is:
     \[
     \boxed{44} \text{ dollars}
     \]
