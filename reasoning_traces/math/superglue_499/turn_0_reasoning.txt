==================================================

To solve the problem, we first need to understand what "Sample reasoning question 499" entails. Since the problem statement is not specific, I'll assume it's a generic math problem that requires logical reasoning and problem-solving skills. Let's create a hypothetical problem and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**

A store sells apples and oranges. An apple costs $0.50, and an orange costs $0.70. A customer buys a total of 10 fruits, spending exactly $6.00. How many apples and oranges did the customer buy?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( x \) be the number of apples.
   - Let \( y \) be the number of oranges.

2. **Set Up Equations:**
   - The total number of fruits is 10: 
     \[
     x + y = 10
     \]
   - The total cost is $6.00:
     \[
     0.50x + 0.70y = 6.00
     \]

3. **Solve the System of Equations:**

   We have the following system of equations:
   \[
   \begin{align*}
   x + y &= 10 \quad \text{(Equation 1)} \\
   0.50x + 0.70y &= 6.00 \quad \text{(Equation 2)}
   \end{align*}
   \]

   From Equation 1, express \( y \) in terms of \( x \):
   \[
   y = 10 - x
   \]

   Substitute \( y = 10 - x \) into Equation 2:
   \[
   0.50x + 0.70(10 - x) = 6.00
   \]

   Simplify and solve for \( x \):
   \[
   0.50x + 7.00 - 0.70x = 6.00
   \]

   Combine like terms:
   \[
   -0.20x + 7.00 = 6.00
   \]

   Subtract 7.00 from both sides:
   \[
   -0.20x = -1.00
   \]

   Divide by -0.20:
   \[
   x = \frac{-1.00}{-0.20} = 5
   \]

4. **Find \( y \):**

   Substitute \( x = 5 \) back into Equation 1:
   \[
   5 + y = 10
   \]

   Solve for \( y \):
   \[
   y = 10 - 5 = 5
   \]

5. **Verify the Solution:**

   Check the total cost with \( x = 5 \) and \( y = 5 \):
   \[
   0.50(5) + 0.70(5) = 2.50 + 3.50 = 6.00
   \]

   The calculations are correct.

**Final Answer:**

The customer bought 5 apples and 5 oranges.
