Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem effectively, let's first understand what "Sample reasoning question 499" might entail. Since the problem statement is not specific, I'll assume it involves a typical math problem-solving scenario. I'll create a hypothetical math problem and solve it step-by-step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**
Calculate the value of \( x \) in the equation \( 3x + 7 = 22 \).

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Equation:**
   The equation given is \( 3x + 7 = 22 \). This is a linear equation in one variable, \( x \).

2. **Isolate the Variable:**
   To find the value of \( x \), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We start by eliminating the constant term on the left side of the equation.

   \[
   3x + 7 = 22
   \]

   Subtract 7 from both sides to remove the constant term:

   \[
   3x + 7 - 7 = 22 - 7
   \]

   Simplifying both sides gives:

   \[
   3x = 15
   \]

3. **Solve for \( x \):**
   Now, we need to solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides of the equation by the coefficient of \( x \), which is 3.

   \[
   \frac{3x}{3} = \frac{15}{3}
   \]

   Simplifying both sides gives:

   \[
   x = 5
   \]

4. **Verify the Solution:**
   To ensure the solution is correct, substitute \( x = 5 \) back into the original equation:

   \[
   3(5) + 7 = 22
   \]

   Simplifying the left side:

   \[
   15 + 7 = 22
   \]

   \[
   22 = 22
   \]

   Since both sides of the equation are equal, the solution \( x = 5 \) is verified.

**Final Answer:**
The value of \( x \) is 5.
