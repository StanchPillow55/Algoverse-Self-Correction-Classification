Question ID: superglue_499
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to understand what "Sample reasoning question 499" refers to. However, without additional context or specific details about the problem, it's challenging to provide a precise solution. Let's assume this is a hypothetical math problem and work through a general approach to solving a typical math problem.

### Step-by-Step Approach:

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - Since the problem is labeled as "Sample reasoning question 499," it might involve logical reasoning, pattern recognition, or mathematical calculations. Without specific details, we will assume it involves a sequence or pattern.

2. **Identify Known Information:**
   - We don't have specific numbers or a sequence provided, so let's assume a simple arithmetic sequence for demonstration purposes. An arithmetic sequence is a sequence of numbers with a constant difference between consecutive terms.

3. **Formulate a Hypothetical Problem:**
   - Let's assume the sequence is: 2, 5, 8, 11, ...
   - Here, the first term \( a_1 = 2 \) and the common difference \( d = 3 \).

4. **Determine the General Formula:**
   - The general formula for the \( n \)-th term of an arithmetic sequence is:
     \[
     a_n = a_1 + (n-1) \cdot d
     \]
   - Substituting the known values:
     \[
     a_n = 2 + (n-1) \cdot 3
     \]
     \[
     a_n = 2 + 3n - 3
     \]
     \[
     a_n = 3n - 1
     \]

5. **Solve for a Specific Term:**
   - Suppose we want to find the 10th term of the sequence.
   - Substitute \( n = 10 \) into the formula:
     \[
     a_{10} = 3 \cdot 10 - 1 = 30 - 1 = 29
     \]

6. **Verify the Solution:**
   - Check the first few terms to ensure the pattern holds:
     - \( a_1 = 3 \cdot 1 - 1 = 2 \)
     - \( a_2 = 3 \cdot 2 - 1 = 5 \)
     - \( a_3 = 3 \cdot 3 - 1 = 8 \)
     - \( a_4 = 3 \cdot 4 - 1 = 11 \)
   - The pattern is consistent with our assumption.

### Final Answer:
For the hypothetical arithmetic sequence 2, 5, 8, 11, ..., the 10th term is 29.

If "Sample reasoning question 499" refers to a different type of problem, please provide additional details or context for a more accurate solution.
