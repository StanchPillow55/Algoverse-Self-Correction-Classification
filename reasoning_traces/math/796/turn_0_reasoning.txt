To solve the problem, we need to calculate the total amount of money the company pays to its employees after three months, taking into account the initial number of employees and the new hires each month.

### Step 1: Determine the initial number of employees
The company starts with an initial workforce of:
\[
\text{Initial employees} = 200
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the number of new employees hired each month
The company hires:
\[
\text{New employees per month} = 20
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the total number of employees after each month
We will calculate the total number of employees at the end of each month for three months.

- **End of Month 1:**
  \[
  \text{Total employees after Month 1} = \text{Initial employees} + \text{New employees} = 200 + 20 = 220
  \]

- **End of Month 2:**
  \[
  \text{Total employees after Month 2} = \text{Total employees after Month 1} + \text{New employees} = 220 + 20 = 240
  \]

- **End of Month 3:**
  \[
  \text{Total employees after Month 3} = \text{Total employees after Month 2} + \text{New employees} = 240 + 20 = 260
  \]

### Step 4: Calculate the monthly salary for each employee
Each employee is paid a monthly salary of:
\[
\text{Salary per employee} = 4000
\]

### Step 5: Calculate the total salary paid each month
Now we will calculate the total salary paid to all employees at the end of each month.

- **Total salary at the end of Month 1:**
  \[
  \text{Total salary Month 1} = \text{Total employees after Month 1} \times \text{Salary per employee} = 220 \times 4000 = 880000
  \]

- **Total salary at the end of Month 2:**
  \[
  \text{Total salary Month 2} = \text{Total employees after Month 2} \times \text{Salary per employee} = 240 \times 4000 = 960000
  \]

- **Total salary at the end of Month 3:**
  \[
  \text{Total salary Month 3} = \text{Total employees after Month 3} \times \text{Salary per employee} = 260 \times 4000 = 1040000
  \]

### Step 6: Calculate the total salary paid over three months
Now we will sum the total salaries paid over the three months:
\[
\text{Total salary over 3 months} = \text{Total salary Month 1} + \text{Total salary Month 2} + \text{Total salary Month 3}
\]
\[
\text{Total salary over 3 months} = 880000 + 960000 + 1040000
\]
Calculating this step-by-step:
1. \(880000 + 960000 = 1840000\)
2. \(1840000 + 1040000 = 2880000\)

### Final Answer
The total amount of money the company pays to its employees after three months is:
\[
\boxed{2880000}
\]
