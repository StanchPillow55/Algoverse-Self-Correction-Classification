To solve the problem, we need to calculate the total amount of money the company pays to its employees after three months, taking into account the initial number of employees, the number of new hires each month, and the salary per employee.

### Step 1: Determine the initial number of employees
The company starts with an initial workforce of:
- **Initial employees = 200**

### Step 2: Calculate the number of new employees hired each month
The company hires:
- **New employees per month = 20**

### Step 3: Calculate the total number of employees after three months
We will calculate the total number of employees at the end of each month.

1. **End of Month 1:**
   - Total employees = Initial employees + New hires
   - Total employees = 200 + 20 = 220

2. **End of Month 2:**
   - Total employees = Employees at end of Month 1 + New hires
   - Total employees = 220 + 20 = 240

3. **End of Month 3:**
   - Total employees = Employees at end of Month 2 + New hires
   - Total employees = 240 + 20 = 260

### Step 4: Calculate the total salary paid each month
Each employee is paid a salary of:
- **Salary per employee = $4000**

Now, we will calculate the total salary paid to employees at the end of each month.

1. **Total salary at the end of Month 1:**
   - Total salary = Total employees × Salary per employee
   - Total salary = 220 × $4000 = $880,000

2. **Total salary at the end of Month 2:**
   - Total salary = Total employees × Salary per employee
   - Total salary = 240 × $4000 = $960,000

3. **Total salary at the end of Month 3:**
   - Total salary = Total employees × Salary per employee
   - Total salary = 260 × $4000 = $1,040,000

### Step 5: Calculate the total amount paid over three months
Now, we will sum the total salaries paid over the three months:
- Total amount paid = Total salary Month 1 + Total salary Month 2 + Total salary Month 3
- Total amount paid = $880,000 + $960,000 + $1,040,000

Calculating the total:
\[
Total amount paid = 880,000 + 960,000 + 1,040,000 = 2,880,000
\]

### Final Answer
The total amount of money the company pays to its employees after three months is **$2,880,000**.
