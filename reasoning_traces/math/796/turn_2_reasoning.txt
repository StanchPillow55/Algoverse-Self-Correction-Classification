Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we will calculate the total number of employees after three months and then determine the total salary paid to all employees during that time.

### Step 1: Calculate the total number of employees after three months.

1. **Initial number of employees**: 200
2. **Number of new employees hired each month**: 20
3. **Number of months**: 3

**Total number of new employees hired in three months**:
\[
\text{Total new employees} = \text{Number of new employees per month} \times \text{Number of months} = 20 \times 3 = 60
\]

**Total number of employees after three months**:
\[
\text{Total employees after 3 months} = \text{Initial employees} + \text{Total new employees} = 200 + 60 = 260
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the total salary paid to employees over three months.

1. **Salary per employee per month**: $4000
2. **Total number of employees after three months**: 260

**Total salary paid to all employees in one month**:
\[
\text{Total salary for one month} = \text{Total employees} \times \text{Salary per employee} = 260 \times 4000
\]
Calculating this:
\[
260 \times 4000 = 1,040,000
\]

**Total salary paid over three months**:
\[
\text{Total salary for three months} = \text{Total salary for one month} \times \text{Number of months} = 1,040,000 \times 3
\]
Calculating this:
\[
1,040,000 \times 3 = 3,120,000
\]

### Final Answer:
The total amount of money the company pays to its employees after three months is **$3,120,000**.
