To solve the problem, we need to translate the verbal statement into a mathematical equation. 

The problem states: "Eight more than four times the number of coffee mugs in the teacher’s lounge is 40."

Let's define a variable for the number of coffee mugs. We'll let \( x \) represent the number of coffee mugs in the teacher's lounge.

Now, we can break down the statement:

1. "Four times the number of coffee mugs" can be expressed as \( 4x \).
2. "Eight more than four times the number of coffee mugs" means we add 8 to \( 4x \), which gives us \( 4x + 8 \).
3. The phrase "is 40" indicates that this expression is equal to 40.

Putting this all together, we can write the equation:

\[
4x + 8 = 40
\]

Next, we will solve for \( x \):

1. First, we need to isolate \( 4x \). We can do this by subtracting 8 from both sides of the equation:

\[
4x + 8 - 8 = 40 - 8
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
4x = 32
\]

2. Now, we need to solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides by 4:

\[
x = \frac{32}{4}
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
x = 8
\]

Thus, the number of coffee mugs in the teacher's lounge is \( 8 \).

Finally, we can state our answer clearly:

The number of coffee mugs in the teacher’s lounge is \( \boxed{8} \).
