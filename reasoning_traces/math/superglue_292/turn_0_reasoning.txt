==================================================

To solve the problem, I need more specific information about "Sample reasoning question 292." Since I don't have the details of this particular question, I'll provide a general approach to solving a math problem step by step. If you have a specific math problem in mind, please provide the details, and I'll be happy to help with that.

### General Approach to Solving a Math Problem

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - Read the problem carefully.
   - Identify what is being asked.
   - Determine what information is given and what needs to be found.

2. **Devise a Plan:**
   - Think about the strategies that can be used to solve the problem. This could include drawing a diagram, creating an equation, or breaking the problem into smaller parts.

3. **Carry Out the Plan:**
   - Execute the chosen strategy step by step.
   - Perform calculations carefully.
   - Keep track of units and make sure each step logically follows from the previous one.

4. **Check Your Work:**
   - Review each step to ensure accuracy.
   - Verify that the solution makes sense in the context of the problem.
   - Check calculations for any arithmetic errors.

5. **State the Final Answer:**
   - Clearly write down the final answer.
   - Include units if applicable.

### Example Problem

Let's go through an example problem using this approach:

**Problem:**
A rectangle has a length that is twice its width. If the perimeter of the rectangle is 36 units, what are the dimensions of the rectangle?

**Step 1: Understand the Problem**
- We need to find the length and width of the rectangle.
- We know the perimeter is 36 units and the length is twice the width.

**Step 2: Devise a Plan**
- Use the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle: \( P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width}) \).
- Let the width be \( w \).
- Then the length is \( 2w \).
- Substitute these into the perimeter formula.

**Step 3: Carry Out the Plan**
- The perimeter is given by:
  \[
  36 = 2 \times (2w + w)
  \]
  \[
  36 = 2 \times 3w
  \]
  \[
  36 = 6w
  \]
- Solve for \( w \):
  \[
  w = \frac{36}{6} = 6
  \]
- Since the length is twice the width:
  \[
  \text{Length} = 2w = 2 \times 6 = 12
  \]

**Step 4: Check Your Work**
- Verify the perimeter with the found dimensions:
  \[
  P = 2 \times (12 + 6) = 2 \times 18 = 36
  \]
- The calculations are correct.

**Step 5: State the Final Answer**
- The width of the rectangle is 6 units, and the length is 12 units.
