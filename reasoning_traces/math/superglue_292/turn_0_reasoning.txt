==================================================

To solve the problem, I need more specific information about "Sample reasoning question 292." Since the question is not provided, I'll walk through a generic approach to solving a math problem, which you can apply to your specific question once you have it.

### Step-by-Step Approach to Solving a Math Problem:

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - Read the problem carefully.
   - Identify what is being asked.
   - Determine what information is given and what needs to be found.

2. **Devise a Plan:**
   - Think about the strategies that could be used to solve the problem. This could include:
     - Drawing a diagram.
     - Writing an equation.
     - Breaking the problem into smaller parts.
     - Looking for patterns.

3. **Carry Out the Plan:**
   - Execute the steps you have planned.
   - Perform calculations carefully.
   - Keep track of units and ensure consistency.

4. **Check Your Work:**
   - Review each step to ensure accuracy.
   - Verify that the solution makes sense in the context of the problem.
   - Check calculations for errors.

5. **State the Final Answer:**
   - Clearly write down the answer.
   - Include units if applicable.

### Example Problem:

**Problem:** Solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).

**Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We need to find the value of \( x \) that satisfies the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).

2. **Devise a Plan:**
   - Isolate \( x \) on one side of the equation.

3. **Carry Out the Plan:**
   - Subtract 3 from both sides of the equation:
     \[
     2x + 3 - 3 = 11 - 3
     \]
     \[
     2x = 8
     \]
   - Divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( x \):
     \[
     \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{8}{2}
     \]
     \[
     x = 4
     \]

4. **Check Your Work:**
   - Substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation to verify:
     \[
     2(4) + 3 = 8 + 3 = 11
     \]
   - The left side equals the right side, confirming the solution is correct.

5. **State the Final Answer:**
   - The solution to the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \) is \( x = 4 \).

If you provide the specific details of "Sample reasoning question 292," I can apply this structured approach to solve it.
