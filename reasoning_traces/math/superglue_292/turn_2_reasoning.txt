==================================================

To solve the problem effectively, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 292" entails. Since the problem statement is not provided, let's assume a hypothetical math problem and solve it step-by-step. 

Let's assume the problem is as follows:

**Problem:**  
A company produces two products, A and B. The profit from each unit of product A is $3, and the profit from each unit of product B is $5. The company can produce a maximum of 100 units of product A and 80 units of product B per day. However, due to resource constraints, the total production of products A and B combined cannot exceed 150 units per day. How many units of each product should the company produce to maximize profit?

**Solution:**

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( x \) be the number of units of product A produced.
   - Let \( y \) be the number of units of product B produced.

2. **Objective Function:**
   - The profit function \( P \) to be maximized is given by:
     \[
     P = 3x + 5y
     \]

3. **Constraints:**
   - The production constraints are:
     \[
     x \leq 100
     \]
     \[
     y \leq 80
     \]
     \[
     x + y \leq 150
     \]
   - Additionally, the non-negativity constraints are:
     \[
     x \geq 0
     \]
     \[
     y \geq 0
     \]

4. **Graphical Solution:**
   - Plot the constraints on a graph with \( x \) on the horizontal axis and \( y \) on the vertical axis.
   - The feasible region is the area where all constraints overlap.

5. **Identify Corner Points:**
   - The corner points of the feasible region are potential candidates for maximizing the profit function. These points can be found by solving the system of inequalities:
     - Intersection of \( x = 100 \) and \( x + y = 150 \): \( (100, 50) \)
     - Intersection of \( y = 80 \) and \( x + y = 150 \): \( (70, 80) \)
     - Intersection of \( x = 0 \) and \( y = 80 \): \( (0, 80) \)
     - Intersection of \( x = 100 \) and \( y = 0 \): \( (100, 0) \)

6. **Evaluate the Objective Function at Each Corner Point:**
   - \( P(100, 50) = 3(100) + 5(50) = 300 + 250 = 550 \)
   - \( P(70, 80) = 3(70) + 5(80) = 210 + 400 = 610 \)
   - \( P(0, 80) = 3(0) + 5(80) = 0 + 400 = 400 \)
   - \( P(100, 0) = 3(100) + 5(0) = 300 + 0 = 300 \)

7. **Determine the Maximum Profit:**
   - The maximum profit occurs at the point \( (70, 80) \) with a profit of $610.

**Final Answer:**
To maximize profit, the company should produce 70 units of product A and 80 units of product B, resulting in a maximum profit of $610.
