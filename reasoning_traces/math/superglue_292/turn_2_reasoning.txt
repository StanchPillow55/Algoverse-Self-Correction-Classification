==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 292" refers to. However, since the question itself is not provided, I'll demonstrate a general approach to solving a math problem by creating a hypothetical problem and solving it step by step.

Let's assume the problem is as follows:

**Problem:** Calculate the sum of all even numbers between 1 and 100.

**Step 1: Identify the even numbers between 1 and 100.**

Even numbers are integers that are divisible by 2. The even numbers between 1 and 100 are: 2, 4, 6, ..., 100.

**Step 2: Determine the sequence of even numbers.**

The sequence of even numbers from 2 to 100 is an arithmetic sequence where:
- The first term \( a_1 = 2 \)
- The common difference \( d = 2 \)
- The last term \( a_n = 100 \)

**Step 3: Find the number of terms in the sequence.**

To find the number of terms \( n \), we use the formula for the \( n \)-th term of an arithmetic sequence:
\[ a_n = a_1 + (n-1) \cdot d \]

Substitute the known values:
\[ 100 = 2 + (n-1) \cdot 2 \]

Solve for \( n \):
\[ 100 = 2 + 2n - 2 \]
\[ 100 = 2n \]
\[ n = 50 \]

There are 50 even numbers between 1 and 100.

**Step 4: Calculate the sum of the sequence.**

The sum \( S_n \) of the first \( n \) terms of an arithmetic sequence is given by:
\[ S_n = \frac{n}{2} \cdot (a_1 + a_n) \]

Substitute the known values:
\[ S_{50} = \frac{50}{2} \cdot (2 + 100) \]
\[ S_{50} = 25 \cdot 102 \]
\[ S_{50} = 2550 \]

**Final Answer:**

The sum of all even numbers between 1 and 100 is 2550.
