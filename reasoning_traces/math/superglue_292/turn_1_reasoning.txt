==================================================

To solve the problem effectively, let's first understand what "Sample reasoning question 292" might entail. Since the problem statement is not explicitly given, I'll assume it involves a typical math problem-solving scenario. I'll create a hypothetical problem and solve it step-by-step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**

A farmer has a rectangular field that is 100 meters long and 60 meters wide. He wants to divide the field into two equal parts by constructing a fence parallel to the shorter side. Calculate the length of the fence required and the area of each part after division.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - The field is rectangular with dimensions 100 meters (length) and 60 meters (width).
   - The farmer wants to divide the field into two equal parts by constructing a fence parallel to the shorter side (width).

2. **Visualize the Division:**
   - Since the fence is parallel to the shorter side, it will run along the length of the field.
   - This means the fence will be 100 meters long (the same as the length of the field).

3. **Calculate the Area of the Field:**
   - The total area of the field is given by the formula for the area of a rectangle: 
     \[
     \text{Area} = \text{Length} \times \text{Width} = 100 \, \text{m} \times 60 \, \text{m} = 6000 \, \text{m}^2
     \]

4. **Divide the Field into Two Equal Parts:**
   - Since the field is divided into two equal parts, each part will have half of the total area:
     \[
     \text{Area of each part} = \frac{6000 \, \text{m}^2}{2} = 3000 \, \text{m}^2
     \]

5. **Determine the Length of the Fence:**
   - As reasoned earlier, the fence will run along the length of the field, so the length of the fence required is 100 meters.

6. **Final Answer:**
   - The length of the fence required is 100 meters.
   - The area of each part after division is 3000 square meters.

**Conclusion:**

By dividing the field with a fence parallel to the shorter side, the farmer effectively creates two equal parts, each with an area of 3000 square meters. The fence required for this division is 100 meters long.
