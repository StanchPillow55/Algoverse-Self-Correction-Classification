To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample math problem 165" refers to. Since there is no specific problem statement provided, I'll create a sample math problem and solve it step by step.

**Sample Math Problem 165:**

**Problem:**
A rectangle has a length that is 3 times its width. If the perimeter of the rectangle is 48 units, find the dimensions of the rectangle.

**Solution:**

Let's denote the width of the rectangle as \( w \).

According to the problem, the length \( l \) is 3 times the width. Therefore, we can express the length as:
\[ l = 3w \]

The formula for the perimeter \( P \) of a rectangle is given by:
\[ P = 2l + 2w \]

We are told that the perimeter is 48 units. Substituting the known values into the perimeter formula, we have:
\[ 48 = 2(3w) + 2w \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ 48 = 6w + 2w \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 48 = 8w \]

To find the width \( w \), divide both sides of the equation by 8:
\[ w = \frac{48}{8} \]
\[ w = 6 \]

Now that we have the width, we can find the length using the relationship \( l = 3w \):
\[ l = 3 \times 6 \]
\[ l = 18 \]

**Conclusion:**

The dimensions of the rectangle are:
- Width: 6 units
- Length: 18 units

**Final Answer:**
The width of the rectangle is 6 units, and the length is 18 units.
