==================================================

To solve the problem, we first need to understand what "Sample math problem 165" refers to. Since the problem statement is not provided, I'll assume a generic math problem and solve it step by step. Let's assume the problem is as follows:

**Problem:**
Calculate the sum of all integers from 1 to 165.

**Solution:**

To find the sum of all integers from 1 to 165, we can use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series. The formula for the sum \( S \) of the first \( n \) natural numbers is:

\[
S = \frac{n(n + 1)}{2}
\]

In this problem, \( n = 165 \). Plugging this value into the formula gives:

\[
S = \frac{165(165 + 1)}{2}
\]

First, calculate \( 165 + 1 \):

\[
165 + 1 = 166
\]

Next, multiply 165 by 166:

\[
165 \times 166 = 27390
\]

Now, divide 27390 by 2 to find the sum:

\[
S = \frac{27390}{2} = 13695
\]

Therefore, the sum of all integers from 1 to 165 is 13,695.

**Final Answer:**
The sum of all integers from 1 to 165 is 13,695.
