Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 165," we first need to clarify what the problem entails. Since "Sample math problem 165" is not a standard or specific problem description, I will assume it is a placeholder for a typical math problem. Let's create a sample problem and solve it step by step.

**Sample Problem:**
Calculate the sum of the first 165 positive integers.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   We need to find the sum of the first 165 positive integers. The sequence of these integers is 1, 2, 3, ..., 165.

2. **Identify the Formula:**
   The sum of the first \( n \) positive integers can be calculated using the formula:
   \[
   S_n = \frac{n(n + 1)}{2}
   \]
   where \( S_n \) is the sum of the first \( n \) integers.

3. **Substitute the Values:**
   Here, \( n = 165 \). Substitute 165 into the formula:
   \[
   S_{165} = \frac{165(165 + 1)}{2}
   \]

4. **Calculate Step-by-Step:**
   - First, calculate \( 165 + 1 \):
     \[
     165 + 1 = 166
     \]
   - Next, calculate the product \( 165 \times 166 \):
     \[
     165 \times 166 = 27390
     \]
   - Finally, divide by 2 to find the sum:
     \[
     S_{165} = \frac{27390}{2} = 13695
     \]

5. **Conclusion:**
   The sum of the first 165 positive integers is 13,695.

**Final Answer:**
The sum of the first 165 positive integers is 13,695.
