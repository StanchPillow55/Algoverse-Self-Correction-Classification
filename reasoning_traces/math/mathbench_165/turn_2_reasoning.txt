==================================================

To solve the problem, we first need to understand what "Sample math problem 165" refers to. However, since there is no specific problem statement provided, I'll create a hypothetical math problem and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem 165:**

Calculate the sum of all even numbers between 1 and 165.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Identify the Range of Even Numbers:**
   - The even numbers between 1 and 165 start from 2 and go up to 164.

2. **Determine the Sequence of Even Numbers:**
   - The sequence of even numbers is: 2, 4, 6, ..., 164.

3. **Identify the Pattern:**
   - This is an arithmetic sequence where the first term \( a_1 = 2 \) and the common difference \( d = 2 \).

4. **Find the Number of Terms in the Sequence:**
   - The nth term of an arithmetic sequence can be found using the formula:
     \[
     a_n = a_1 + (n-1) \cdot d
     \]
   - We need to find \( n \) such that \( a_n = 164 \):
     \[
     164 = 2 + (n-1) \cdot 2
     \]
     \[
     164 = 2 + 2n - 2
     \]
     \[
     164 = 2n
     \]
     \[
     n = \frac{164}{2} = 82
     \]
   - There are 82 even numbers between 1 and 165.

5. **Calculate the Sum of the Sequence:**
   - The sum \( S_n \) of the first \( n \) terms of an arithmetic sequence is given by:
     \[
     S_n = \frac{n}{2} \cdot (a_1 + a_n)
     \]
   - Substitute the known values:
     \[
     S_{82} = \frac{82}{2} \cdot (2 + 164)
     \]
     \[
     S_{82} = 41 \cdot 166
     \]

6. **Perform the Multiplication:**
   - Calculate \( 41 \times 166 \):
     \[
     41 \times 166 = 41 \times (160 + 6) = 41 \times 160 + 41 \times 6
     \]
     \[
     41 \times 160 = 6560
     \]
     \[
     41 \times 6 = 246
     \]
     \[
     41 \times 166 = 6560 + 246 = 6806
     \]

7. **Final Answer:**
   - The sum of all even numbers between 1 and 165 is \( \boxed{6806} \).
