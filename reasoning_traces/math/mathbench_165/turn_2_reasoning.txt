==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 165," we first need to understand what the problem is asking. However, the problem statement "Sample math problem 165" is not specific enough to determine what the mathematical question is. It seems like a placeholder or reference to a specific problem that might be detailed elsewhere.

Since the problem is not explicitly stated, let's consider a hypothetical math problem involving the number 165. We can explore a few different types of problems that might involve this number, such as:

1. **Prime Factorization of 165:**
   - To find the prime factorization of 165, we start by dividing by the smallest prime number, which is 2. Since 165 is odd, it is not divisible by 2.
   - Next, we try dividing by 3. The sum of the digits of 165 is \(1 + 6 + 5 = 12\), which is divisible by 3. Therefore, 165 is divisible by 3.
   - Dividing 165 by 3 gives us \(165 \div 3 = 55\).
   - Now, we factor 55. It is not divisible by 3, so we try the next prime number, which is 5. The last digit of 55 is 5, so it is divisible by 5.
   - Dividing 55 by 5 gives us \(55 \div 5 = 11\).
   - Finally, 11 is a prime number.
   - Therefore, the prime factorization of 165 is \(3 \times 5 \times 11\).

2. **Finding the Sum of the Divisors of 165:**
   - The divisors of 165 can be found from its prime factorization: \(3 \times 5 \times 11\).
   - The divisors are: 1, 3, 5, 11, 15, 33, 55, and 165.
   - To find the sum of these divisors, we add them up: 
     \[
     1 + 3 + 5 + 11 + 15 + 33 + 55 + 165 = 288
     \]

3. **Checking if 165 is a Perfect Number:**
   - A perfect number is a number that is equal to the sum of its proper divisors (excluding itself).
   - The proper divisors of 165 are: 1, 3, 5, 11, 15, 33, and 55.
   - The sum of the proper divisors is:
     \[
     1 + 3 + 5 + 11 + 15 + 33 + 55 = 123
     \]
   - Since 123 is not equal to 165, 165 is not a perfect number.

4. **Solving a Simple Equation Involving 165:**
   - Suppose we have an equation such as \(x + 165 = 200\).
   - To solve for \(x\), we subtract 165 from both sides:
     \[
     x = 200 - 165 = 35
     \]

Since the original problem statement was not clear, I have provided several different mathematical explorations involving the number 165. If you have a specific problem in mind, please provide more details so I can assist you further.
