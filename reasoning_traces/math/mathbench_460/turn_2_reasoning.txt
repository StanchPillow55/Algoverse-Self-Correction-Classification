==================================================

To solve the problem, we first need to understand what "Sample math problem 460" refers to. Since there is no specific problem statement provided, I will create a hypothetical math problem and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem 460:**

Calculate the area of a triangle with vertices at the points A(2, 3), B(5, 11), and C(9, 7).

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   We need to find the area of a triangle given its vertices in a coordinate plane. The vertices are A(2, 3), B(5, 11), and C(9, 7).

2. **Formula for Area of a Triangle:**
   The area \( A \) of a triangle with vertices at \((x_1, y_1)\), \((x_2, y_2)\), and \((x_3, y_3)\) is given by the formula:
   \[
   A = \frac{1}{2} \left| x_1(y_2-y_3) + x_2(y_3-y_1) + x_3(y_1-y_2) \right|
   \]

3. **Substitute the Coordinates:**
   For our triangle, the coordinates are:
   - \( x_1 = 2, y_1 = 3 \)
   - \( x_2 = 5, y_2 = 11 \)
   - \( x_3 = 9, y_3 = 7 \)

   Substitute these into the formula:
   \[
   A = \frac{1}{2} \left| 2(11-7) + 5(7-3) + 9(3-11) \right|
   \]

4. **Calculate Each Term:**
   - \( 2(11-7) = 2 \times 4 = 8 \)
   - \( 5(7-3) = 5 \times 4 = 20 \)
   - \( 9(3-11) = 9 \times (-8) = -72 \)

5. **Sum the Terms:**
   \[
   8 + 20 - 72 = -44
   \]

6. **Calculate the Absolute Value:**
   \[
   \left| -44 \right| = 44
   \]

7. **Calculate the Area:**
   \[
   A = \frac{1}{2} \times 44 = 22
   \]

8. **Final Answer:**
   The area of the triangle with vertices A(2, 3), B(5, 11), and C(9, 7) is 22 square units.

This completes the solution to the hypothetical problem. If you have a specific "Sample math problem 460" in mind, please provide the details, and I can solve that problem for you.
