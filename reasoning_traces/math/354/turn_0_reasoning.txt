==================================================

Let's denote the number of boxes of oranges that Seth initially bought as \( x \).

1. **Seth gives a box to his mother**: After giving away one box to his mother, the number of boxes he has left is:
   \[
   x - 1
   \]

2. **Seth gives away half of the remaining boxes**: After giving away half of the remaining boxes, the number of boxes he gives away is:
   \[
   \frac{1}{2}(x - 1)
   \]
   Therefore, the number of boxes he has left after this is:
   \[
   (x - 1) - \frac{1}{2}(x - 1)
   \]

   To simplify this expression, we can factor out \( (x - 1) \):
   \[
   (x - 1) - \frac{1}{2}(x - 1) = \frac{1}{2}(x - 1)
   \]

3. **Seth has 4 boxes left**: According to the problem, after giving away half of the remaining boxes, Seth has 4 boxes left. Thus, we can set up the equation:
   \[
   \frac{1}{2}(x - 1) = 4
   \]

4. **Solving for \( x \)**: To solve for \( x \), we first multiply both sides of the equation by 2 to eliminate the fraction:
   \[
   x - 1 = 8
   \]

   Next, we add 1 to both sides:
   \[
   x = 9
   \]

Thus, the number of boxes of oranges that Seth initially bought is \( \boxed{9} \).

5. **Verification**: To ensure our solution is correct, we can verify:
   - Seth starts with 9 boxes.
   - He gives 1 box to his mother, leaving him with \( 9 - 1 = 8 \) boxes.
   - He then gives away half of the 8 boxes, which is \( \frac{1}{2} \times 8 = 4 \) boxes.
   - After giving away 4 boxes, he has \( 8 - 4 = 4 \) boxes left.

Since this matches the information given in the problem, our solution is confirmed. The final answer is \( \boxed{9} \).
