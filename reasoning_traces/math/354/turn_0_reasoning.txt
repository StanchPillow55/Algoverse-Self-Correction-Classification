==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine how many boxes of oranges Seth initially bought. Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Define the Variables:**
   - Let \( x \) be the total number of boxes Seth initially bought.

2. **Understand the Problem:**
   - Seth gave one box to his mother. Therefore, the number of boxes left after this action is \( x - 1 \).
   - Seth then gave away half of the remaining boxes. After giving away half, he is left with 4 boxes.

3. **Set Up the Equation:**
   - After giving one box to his mother, Seth has \( x - 1 \) boxes.
   - He gives away half of these remaining boxes, so he gives away \( \frac{x - 1}{2} \) boxes.
   - The number of boxes left after giving away half is 4.

   Therefore, we can set up the equation:
   \[
   \frac{x - 1}{2} = 4
   \]

4. **Solve the Equation:**
   - To eliminate the fraction, multiply both sides of the equation by 2:
     \[
     x - 1 = 8
     \]
   - Add 1 to both sides to solve for \( x \):
     \[
     x = 9
     \]

5. **Verify the Solution:**
   - If Seth initially bought 9 boxes, he gave one box to his mother, leaving him with 8 boxes.
   - He then gave away half of these 8 boxes, which is 4 boxes.
   - Therefore, he is left with 4 boxes, which matches the condition given in the problem.

Thus, the number of boxes Seth initially bought is \(\boxed{9}\).
