==================================================

To determine how many miles John drives in a month when visiting his parents, we will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the distance to his parents' house.**
   - We know that John drives for 2 hours at a speed of 70 mph to reach his parents.
   - The formula to calculate distance is:
     \[
     \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time}
     \]
   - Substituting the known values:
     \[
     \text{Distance} = 70 \, \text{mph} \times 2 \, \text{hours} = 140 \, \text{miles}
     \]
   - Therefore, the distance to his parents' house is 140 miles.

2. **Calculate the round trip distance.**
   - Since the trip is round trip, we need to double the one-way distance:
     \[
     \text{Round Trip Distance} = 2 \times 140 \, \text{miles} = 280 \, \text{miles}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total distance driven in a month.**
   - John visits his parents twice a month. Therefore, the total distance he drives in a month is:
     \[
     \text{Total Monthly Distance} = 2 \times 280 \, \text{miles} = 560 \, \text{miles}
     \]

Thus, the total distance John drives in a month when visiting his parents is:

\[
\boxed{560} \, \text{miles}
\]
