Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to calculate the total percentage of money James spends on food, accommodation, and entertainment. 

Food: 30%
Accommodation: 15%
Entertainment: 25%

Adding these percentages together, we get:

30% + 15% + 25% = 70%

This means that James spends 70% of his budget on food, accommodation, and entertainment. 

Since the total budget is 100%, and he spends 70% on food, accommodation, and entertainment, the remaining percentage that he spends on coursework materials is:

100% - 70% = 30%

So, James spends 30% of his budget on coursework materials. 

To find out how much money this is, we need to calculate 30% of his total budget. 

James's total budget is $1000, so:

$1000 * 30% = $300

Therefore, James spends $300 on coursework materials.
