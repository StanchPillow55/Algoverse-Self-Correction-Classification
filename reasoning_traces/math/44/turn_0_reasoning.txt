To find out how much money James spends on coursework materials, we first need to calculate how much he spends on food, accommodation, and entertainment based on his total budget of $1000. 

1. **Calculate spending on food:**
   - James spends 30% of his budget on food.
   - Calculation: 
     \[
     \text{Spending on food} = 30\% \times 1000 = 0.30 \times 1000 = 300
     \]
   - So, James spends **$300** on food.

2. **Calculate spending on accommodation:**
   - James spends 15% of his budget on accommodation.
   - Calculation:
     \[
     \text{Spending on accommodation} = 15\% \times 1000 = 0.15 \times 1000 = 150
     \]
   - So, James spends **$150** on accommodation.

3. **Calculate spending on entertainment:**
   - James spends 25% of his budget on entertainment.
   - Calculation:
     \[
     \text{Spending on entertainment} = 25\% \times 1000 = 0.25 \times 1000 = 250
     \]
   - So, James spends **$250** on entertainment.

4. **Calculate total spending on food, accommodation, and entertainment:**
   - We add the amounts spent on food, accommodation, and entertainment:
   \[
   \text{Total spending} = \text{Spending on food} + \text{Spending on accommodation} + \text{Spending on entertainment}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total spending} = 300 + 150 + 250 = 700
   \]

5. **Calculate spending on coursework materials:**
   - The remaining amount from his budget will be spent on coursework materials. We subtract the total spending from his total budget:
   \[
   \text{Spending on coursework materials} = \text{Total budget} - \text{Total spending}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Spending on coursework materials} = 1000 - 700 = 300
   \]

Thus, James spends **$300** on coursework materials.

**Final Answer: $300**
