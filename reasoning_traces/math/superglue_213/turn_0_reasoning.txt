==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 213" refers to. Since this is a generic placeholder and not a specific math problem, I'll create a hypothetical math problem to solve. Let's assume the problem is:

**Problem:**
A company sells two types of products: Product A and Product B. The company sells Product A for $50 each and Product B for $30 each. In one week, the company sold a total of 213 products and made $8,370 in revenue. How many of each product did the company sell?

**Solution:**

To solve this problem, we need to set up a system of equations based on the information given.

1. **Define the variables:**
   - Let \( x \) be the number of Product A sold.
   - Let \( y \) be the number of Product B sold.

2. **Set up the equations:**
   - The total number of products sold is 213:
     \[
     x + y = 213
     \]
   - The total revenue from selling these products is $8,370:
     \[
     50x + 30y = 8,370
     \]

3. **Solve the system of equations:**

   We have the following system of equations:
   \[
   \begin{align*}
   x + y &= 213 \quad \text{(Equation 1)} \\
   50x + 30y &= 8,370 \quad \text{(Equation 2)}
   \end{align*}
   \]

   We can solve this system using the substitution or elimination method. Here, we'll use the substitution method.

   From Equation 1, solve for \( y \):
   \[
   y = 213 - x
   \]

   Substitute \( y = 213 - x \) into Equation 2:
   \[
   50x + 30(213 - x) = 8,370
   \]

   Simplify and solve for \( x \):
   \[
   50x + 6,390 - 30x = 8,370
   \]
   \[
   20x + 6,390 = 8,370
   \]
   \[
   20x = 8,370 - 6,390
   \]
   \[
   20x = 1,980
   \]
   \[
   x = \frac{1,980}{20}
   \]
   \[
   x = 99
   \]

   Now, substitute \( x = 99 \) back into the equation for \( y \):
   \[
   y = 213 - 99
   \]
   \[
   y = 114
   \]

4. **Conclusion:**

   The company sold 99 units of Product A and 114 units of Product B.

**Final Answer:**
The company sold 99 units of Product A and 114 units of Product B.
