==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 213" refers to. Since the question is not explicitly stated, I'll assume it's a placeholder for a typical math problem. Let's create a sample math problem and solve it step by step.

**Sample Problem:**
Calculate the sum of all even numbers between 1 and 213.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Identify the Range of Even Numbers:**
   - The even numbers between 1 and 213 start from 2 and end at 212.

2. **Determine the Sequence of Even Numbers:**
   - The sequence of even numbers can be represented as: 2, 4, 6, ..., 212.

3. **Recognize the Sequence as an Arithmetic Series:**
   - This is an arithmetic sequence where the first term \( a_1 = 2 \) and the common difference \( d = 2 \).

4. **Find the Number of Terms in the Sequence:**
   - The general formula for the \( n \)-th term of an arithmetic sequence is given by:
     \[
     a_n = a_1 + (n-1) \cdot d
     \]
   - Set \( a_n = 212 \) to find \( n \):
     \[
     212 = 2 + (n-1) \cdot 2
     \]
     \[
     212 = 2 + 2n - 2
     \]
     \[
     212 = 2n
     \]
     \[
     n = \frac{212}{2} = 106
     \]
   - There are 106 even numbers between 1 and 213.

5. **Calculate the Sum of the Arithmetic Series:**
   - The sum \( S_n \) of the first \( n \) terms of an arithmetic sequence is given by:
     \[
     S_n = \frac{n}{2} \cdot (a_1 + a_n)
     \]
   - Substitute the known values:
     \[
     S_{106} = \frac{106}{2} \cdot (2 + 212)
     \]
     \[
     S_{106} = 53 \cdot 214
     \]

6. **Perform the Multiplication:**
   - Calculate \( 53 \times 214 \):
     \[
     53 \times 214 = 53 \times (200 + 14)
     \]
     \[
     = 53 \times 200 + 53 \times 14
     \]
     \[
     = 10600 + 742
     \]
     \[
     = 11342
     \]

**Final Answer:**
The sum of all even numbers between 1 and 213 is 11,342.
