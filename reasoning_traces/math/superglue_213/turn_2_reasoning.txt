==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 213" refers to. However, the question as presented is not clear or specific. It seems to be a placeholder or a reference to a specific problem that is not provided here. 

To proceed, let's assume that "Sample reasoning question 213" is a placeholder for a typical math problem. Since no specific details are given, I'll create a hypothetical math problem and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**

"Calculate the sum of all even numbers between 1 and 100."

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Identify the Even Numbers:**
   - Even numbers between 1 and 100 are 2, 4, 6, ..., 100.

2. **Determine the Sequence:**
   - This is an arithmetic sequence where the first term \( a_1 = 2 \) and the last term \( a_n = 100 \).
   - The common difference \( d = 2 \).

3. **Find the Number of Terms:**
   - The formula for the \( n \)-th term of an arithmetic sequence is:
     \[
     a_n = a_1 + (n-1) \cdot d
     \]
   - Plugging in the values:
     \[
     100 = 2 + (n-1) \cdot 2
     \]
   - Simplify and solve for \( n \):
     \[
     100 = 2 + 2n - 2
     \]
     \[
     100 = 2n
     \]
     \[
     n = 50
     \]

4. **Calculate the Sum of the Sequence:**
   - The sum \( S_n \) of an arithmetic sequence is given by:
     \[
     S_n = \frac{n}{2} \cdot (a_1 + a_n)
     \]
   - Substitute the known values:
     \[
     S_{50} = \frac{50}{2} \cdot (2 + 100)
     \]
     \[
     S_{50} = 25 \cdot 102
     \]
     \[
     S_{50} = 2550
     \]

**Final Answer:**

The sum of all even numbers between 1 and 100 is 2550.

This solution assumes a typical arithmetic sequence problem. If "Sample reasoning question 213" refers to a different problem, please provide additional details for a more accurate solution.
