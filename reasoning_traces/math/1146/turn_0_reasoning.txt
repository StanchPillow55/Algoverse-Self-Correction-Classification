To determine how much money Adam loses, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of rocks Adam can buy**:
   Adam has $100 and each rock costs $5. The number of rocks he can buy is calculated as follows:

   \[
   \text{Number of rocks} = \frac{\text{Total money}}{\text{Cost per rock}} = \frac{100}{5} = 20 \text{ rocks}
   \]

2. **Calculate the total revenue from selling 60% of the rocks**:
   Adam only sells 60% of his inventory. First, we need to find out how many rocks that is:

   \[
   \text{Rocks sold} = 0.6 \times \text{Total rocks} = 0.6 \times 20 = 12 \text{ rocks}
   \]

   Now, we calculate the revenue from selling these 12 rocks. Each rock is sold for $7:

   \[
   \text{Revenue} = \text{Rocks sold} \times \text{Selling price per rock} = 12 \times 7 = 84 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total cost of the rocks**:
   The total cost for the 20 rocks Adam bought is:

   \[
   \text{Total cost} = \text{Total rocks} \times \text{Cost per rock} = 20 \times 5 = 100 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Calculate Adam's loss**:
   To find out how much money Adam loses, we subtract the revenue from the total cost:

   \[
   \text{Loss} = \text{Total cost} - \text{Revenue} = 100 - 84 = 16 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Thus, Adam loses **$16**.

Final answer: Adam loses **$16**.
