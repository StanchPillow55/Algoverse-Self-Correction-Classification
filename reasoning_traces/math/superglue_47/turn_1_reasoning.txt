==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 47" refers to. Since the problem statement is not specific, I'll assume this is a placeholder for a typical math reasoning problem. Let's create a hypothetical math problem and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**

A farmer has a rectangular field that is 100 meters long and 60 meters wide. He wants to divide the field into two equal parts by building a fence parallel to one of the shorter sides. How long will the fence be?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We have a rectangular field with dimensions 100 meters (length) and 60 meters (width).
   - The field needs to be divided into two equal parts using a fence parallel to the shorter side (width).

2. **Visualize the Problem:**
   - Imagine the rectangle with the longer side (100 meters) as the base.
   - The shorter side (60 meters) is the width.
   - We need to place a fence parallel to the 60-meter side, dividing the field into two equal areas.

3. **Calculate the Area of the Field:**
   - The area of the rectangle is given by the formula:
     \[
     \text{Area} = \text{Length} \times \text{Width} = 100 \, \text{m} \times 60 \, \text{m} = 6000 \, \text{square meters}
     \]

4. **Determine the Area of Each Half:**
   - Since the field is divided into two equal parts, each part will have an area of:
     \[
     \text{Area of each half} = \frac{6000 \, \text{square meters}}{2} = 3000 \, \text{square meters}
     \]

5. **Determine the Dimensions of Each Half:**
   - Each half will still have a width of 60 meters (since the fence is parallel to the width).
   - Let \( x \) be the length of each half.
   - The area of each half is given by:
     \[
     x \times 60 \, \text{m} = 3000 \, \text{square meters}
     \]
   - Solve for \( x \):
     \[
     x = \frac{3000 \, \text{square meters}}{60 \, \text{m}} = 50 \, \text{meters}
     \]

6. **Length of the Fence:**
   - The fence, which divides the field into two equal parts, will be parallel to the 60-meter side and will span the length of each half, which is 50 meters.

**Final Answer:**

The length of the fence needed to divide the field into two equal parts is 50 meters.
