Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, I need more specific information about "Sample reasoning question 47." Since the question is not provided, I'll demonstrate how to approach a generic math problem by solving an example problem step by step.

Example Problem:
Calculate the area of a triangle with a base of 10 units and a height of 5 units.

Step 1: Understand the formula for the area of a triangle.
The area \( A \) of a triangle can be calculated using the formula:
\[ A = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height} \]

Step 2: Identify the given values.
In this problem, the base of the triangle is given as 10 units, and the height is given as 5 units.

Step 3: Substitute the given values into the formula.
\[ A = \frac{1}{2} \times 10 \times 5 \]

Step 4: Perform the multiplication.
First, multiply the base and the height:
\[ 10 \times 5 = 50 \]

Step 5: Multiply the result by \(\frac{1}{2}\).
\[ A = \frac{1}{2} \times 50 = 25 \]

Step 6: State the final answer.
The area of the triangle is 25 square units.

This is a complete solution to the example problem. If you have a specific question or problem (such as "Sample reasoning question 47"), please provide the details so I can assist you accurately.
