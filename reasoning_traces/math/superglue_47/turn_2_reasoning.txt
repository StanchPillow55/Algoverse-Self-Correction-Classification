Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, I need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 47" refers to. Unfortunately, without specific details or context about what "Sample reasoning question 47" entails, I cannot directly solve it. However, I can guide you on how to approach solving a typical math problem by showing a step-by-step process. 

Let's assume "Sample reasoning question 47" is a typical math problem. Hereâ€™s a general approach to solving a math problem:

### Step 1: Understand the Problem
- **Read the problem carefully.** Identify what is being asked and what information is provided.
- **Identify the type of problem.** Is it algebra, geometry, calculus, etc.?

### Step 2: Devise a Plan
- **Choose a strategy.** Common strategies include drawing a diagram, creating an equation, or breaking the problem into smaller parts.

### Step 3: Carry Out the Plan
- **Execute your chosen strategy.** Perform calculations carefully, and keep track of your work.
- **Check each step.** Ensure that each part of your solution follows logically from the previous one.

### Step 4: Look Back
- **Review your solution.** Check if the answer makes sense in the context of the problem.
- **Verify your calculations.** Double-check your math to ensure accuracy.

### Example Problem
Let's solve a simple algebra problem as an example:

**Problem:** Solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).

#### Step 1: Understand the Problem
We need to find the value of \( x \) that makes the equation true.

#### Step 2: Devise a Plan
We can solve for \( x \) by isolating it on one side of the equation.

#### Step 3: Carry Out the Plan
1. Start with the equation:  
   \[
   2x + 3 = 11
   \]
2. Subtract 3 from both sides to isolate the term with \( x \):  
   \[
   2x + 3 - 3 = 11 - 3
   \]
   \[
   2x = 8
   \]
3. Divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( x \):  
   \[
   \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{8}{2}
   \]
   \[
   x = 4
   \]

#### Step 4: Look Back
- **Verify the solution by substituting \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation:**
  \[
  2(4) + 3 = 8 + 3 = 11
  \]
  The left side equals the right side, confirming our solution is correct.

### Final Answer
The solution to the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \) is \( x = 4 \).

If you have specific details or context for "Sample reasoning question 47," please provide them, and I can tailor my solution to that particular problem.
