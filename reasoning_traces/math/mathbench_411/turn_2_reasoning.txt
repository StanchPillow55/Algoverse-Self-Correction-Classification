Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve "Sample math problem 411," we need to first understand what the problem is asking. However, the problem statement "Sample math problem 411" is not specific and does not provide any details or numbers to work with. Therefore, I will create a hypothetical math problem labeled as "411" and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem 411:**

Calculate the value of \( x \) in the equation \( 3x + 7 = 22 \).

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Equation:**
   The equation given is \( 3x + 7 = 22 \). This is a linear equation in one variable, \( x \).

2. **Isolate the Variable:**
   To find the value of \( x \), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We can do this by performing operations that will simplify the equation.

3. **Subtract 7 from Both Sides:**
   To eliminate the constant term on the left side, subtract 7 from both sides of the equation:
   \[
   3x + 7 - 7 = 22 - 7
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   3x = 15
   \]

4. **Divide Both Sides by 3:**
   To solve for \( x \), divide both sides of the equation by 3:
   \[
   \frac{3x}{3} = \frac{15}{3}
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   x = 5
   \]

5. **Verify the Solution:**
   Substitute \( x = 5 \) back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies the equation:
   \[
   3(5) + 7 = 22
   \]
   Simplifying the left side:
   \[
   15 + 7 = 22
   \]
   \[
   22 = 22
   \]
   Since both sides of the equation are equal, the solution \( x = 5 \) is correct.

**Final Answer:**

The value of \( x \) is 5.
