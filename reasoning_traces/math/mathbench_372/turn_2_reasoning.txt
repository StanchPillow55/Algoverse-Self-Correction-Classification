Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 372," we need to first understand what the problem is asking. However, the problem statement is incomplete as it only states "Sample math problem 372" without any specific details or question. Therefore, I will assume this is a placeholder for a specific math problem. 

Let's consider a hypothetical math problem for demonstration purposes:

**Hypothetical Problem 372:**
Calculate the sum of the first 372 positive integers.

To solve this problem, we can use the formula for the sum of the first \( n \) positive integers, which is given by:

\[
S = \frac{n(n + 1)}{2}
\]

In this case, \( n = 372 \). Plugging this value into the formula, we get:

\[
S = \frac{372 \times (372 + 1)}{2}
\]

\[
S = \frac{372 \times 373}{2}
\]

Now, we perform the multiplication:

\[
372 \times 373 = 138756
\]

Next, we divide the product by 2:

\[
S = \frac{138756}{2} = 69378
\]

Therefore, the sum of the first 372 positive integers is 69,378.

**Final Answer:**
The sum of the first 372 positive integers is 69,378.
