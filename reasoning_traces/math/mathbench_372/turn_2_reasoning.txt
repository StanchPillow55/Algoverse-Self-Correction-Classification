==================================================

To solve the sample math problem 372, let's first assume that "372" refers to a specific math problem number or identifier. Since no specific problem is provided, I'll create a problem involving the number 372 and solve it step by step.

**Problem:**
Find the sum of the digits of the number 372 and determine if this sum is a prime number.

**Step 1: Break down the number into its digits.**

The number 372 consists of the digits 3, 7, and 2.

**Step 2: Calculate the sum of the digits.**

To find the sum of the digits, add them together:

\[ 3 + 7 + 2 = 12 \]

**Step 3: Determine if the sum is a prime number.**

A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. Let's check if 12 is a prime number.

- The divisors of 12 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 12.
- Since 12 has divisors other than 1 and itself, it is not a prime number.

**Conclusion:**

The sum of the digits of 372 is 12, and 12 is not a prime number.

**Final Answer:**

The sum of the digits of 372 is 12, and it is not a prime number.
