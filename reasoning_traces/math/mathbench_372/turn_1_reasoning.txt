Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 372," we need to first understand what the problem is asking. However, the problem statement "Sample math problem 372" is not specific enough for me to determine the exact mathematical question or context. Therefore, I will assume that "372" is a number that we need to analyze or perform operations on. Let's explore a few possibilities of what the problem might involve:

### Possibility 1: Basic Operations
Let's perform some basic operations with the number 372.

1. **Prime Factorization:**
   - To find the prime factorization of 372, we start by dividing by the smallest prime number, 2:
     \[
     372 \div 2 = 186
     \]
   - Divide 186 by 2:
     \[
     186 \div 2 = 93
     \]
   - 93 is not divisible by 2, so we try the next prime number, 3:
     \[
     93 \div 3 = 31
     \]
   - 31 is a prime number.
   - Therefore, the prime factorization of 372 is:
     \[
     372 = 2^2 \times 3 \times 31
     \]

2. **Sum of Digits:**
   - The digits of 372 are 3, 7, and 2.
   - Sum of the digits:
     \[
     3 + 7 + 2 = 12
     \]

3. **Even or Odd:**
   - 372 is an even number because it ends in 2, which is an even digit.

### Possibility 2: Solving an Equation
If "Sample math problem 372" refers to solving an equation involving the number 372, let's consider a simple equation:

- Suppose we have the equation \( x + 372 = 500 \).
- To solve for \( x \), we subtract 372 from both sides:
  \[
  x = 500 - 372 = 128
  \]

### Possibility 3: Geometric Interpretation
If 372 refers to a geometric problem, such as finding the area or perimeter of a shape, we would need more information. For instance, if 372 is the perimeter of a square, we can find the side length:

- Let \( s \) be the side length of the square.
- The perimeter \( P \) of a square is given by \( P = 4s \).
- Setting \( P = 372 \):
  \[
  4s = 372
  \]
  \[
  s = \frac{372}{4} = 93
  \]

### Conclusion
Without a specific problem statement, I have explored several interpretations of "Sample math problem 372." If you have a specific context or problem in mind, please provide more details so I can give a more precise solution. Based on the assumptions made, here are the final answers for each scenario:

1. **Prime Factorization:** \( 372 = 2^2 \times 3 \times 31 \)
2. **Sum of Digits:** 12
3. **Equation Solution:** \( x = 128 \) for \( x + 372 = 500 \)
4. **Square Side Length:** 93 if 372 is the perimeter of a square.
