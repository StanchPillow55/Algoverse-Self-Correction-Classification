==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 372," we need to first understand what the problem is asking. However, the problem statement "Sample math problem 372" is not specific enough to determine the exact nature of the problem. Therefore, I'll assume this is a placeholder for a specific math problem, and I'll create a sample problem to solve.

Let's assume the problem is as follows:

**Problem:**  
Find the sum of all even numbers between 1 and 372.

**Solution:**

To solve this problem, we need to identify all even numbers between 1 and 372 and then find their sum.

1. **Identify the Even Numbers:**
   - Even numbers are integers divisible by 2.
   - The smallest even number greater than 1 is 2.
   - The largest even number less than or equal to 372 is 372 itself (since 372 is even).

2. **List the Even Numbers:**
   - The even numbers between 1 and 372 are: 2, 4, 6, ..., 372.
   - This sequence is an arithmetic sequence where the first term \( a_1 = 2 \) and the common difference \( d = 2 \).

3. **Determine the Number of Terms:**
   - The general formula for the \( n \)-th term of an arithmetic sequence is:
     \[
     a_n = a_1 + (n-1) \cdot d
     \]
   - We need to find \( n \) such that \( a_n = 372 \):
     \[
     372 = 2 + (n-1) \cdot 2
     \]
     \[
     372 = 2 + 2n - 2
     \]
     \[
     372 = 2n
     \]
     \[
     n = \frac{372}{2} = 186
     \]
   - There are 186 even numbers between 1 and 372.

4. **Calculate the Sum of the Sequence:**
   - The sum \( S_n \) of the first \( n \) terms of an arithmetic sequence is given by:
     \[
     S_n = \frac{n}{2} \cdot (a_1 + a_n)
     \]
   - Substituting the known values:
     \[
     S_{186} = \frac{186}{2} \cdot (2 + 372)
     \]
     \[
     S_{186} = 93 \cdot 374
     \]

5. **Perform the Multiplication:**
   - Calculate \( 93 \times 374 \):
     \[
     93 \times 374 = 93 \times (370 + 4) = 93 \times 370 + 93 \times 4
     \]
     \[
     93 \times 370 = 93 \times (37 \times 10) = (93 \times 37) \times 10
     \]
     - Calculate \( 93 \times 37 \):
       \[
       93 \times 37 = (90 + 3) \times 37 = 90 \times 37 + 3 \times 37
       \]
       \[
       90 \times 37 = 3330 \quad \text{(since \( 90 \times 37 = 90 \times (30 + 7) = 2700 + 630 \))}
       \]
       \[
       3 \times 37 = 111
       \]
       \[
       93 \times 37 = 3330 + 111 = 3441
       \]
     \[
     93 \times 370 = 3441 \times 10 = 34410
     \]
     \[
     93 \times 4 = 372
     \]
     \[
     93 \times 374 = 34410 + 372 = 34782
     \]

6. **Final Answer:**
   - The sum of all even numbers between 1 and 372 is \( \boxed{34782} \).
