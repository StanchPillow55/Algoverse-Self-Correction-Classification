To solve this problem, we need to calculate Adam's earnings after taxes for 30 days of work. Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Daily Earnings Before Taxes:**
   Adam earns $40 each day.

2. **Tax Deduction:**
   10% of Adam's daily earnings are deducted as taxes. To find out how much is deducted daily, we calculate 10% of $40.

   \[
   \text{Tax Deduction per Day} = 0.10 \times 40 = 4
   \]

   So, $4 is deducted from Adam's earnings each day as taxes.

3. **Daily Earnings After Taxes:**
   To find out how much Adam earns after taxes each day, we subtract the tax deduction from his daily earnings.

   \[
   \text{Daily Earnings After Taxes} = 40 - 4 = 36
   \]

   Adam earns $36 each day after taxes.

4. **Total Earnings After Taxes for 30 Days:**
   Adam works for 30 days, so we need to calculate his total earnings after taxes for this period. We do this by multiplying his daily earnings after taxes by the number of days he works.

   \[
   \text{Total Earnings After Taxes for 30 Days} = 36 \times 30
   \]

   \[
   = 1080
   \]

Therefore, after 30 days of work, Adam will have earned $1,080 after taxes.

**Final Answer:**
Adam will have earned $1,080 after taxes after 30 days of work.
