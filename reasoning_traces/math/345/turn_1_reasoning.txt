==================================================

To determine how much money Adam will have earned after taxes after 30 days of work, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate Adam's total earnings before taxes for 30 days:**
   Adam earns $40 daily. Therefore, for 30 days, his total earnings can be calculated as:
   \[
   \text{Total earnings} = \text{Daily earnings} \times \text{Number of days} = 40 \times 30
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total earnings} = 1200
   \]

2. **Calculate the amount deducted for taxes:**
   Adam has a tax deduction of 10% on his total earnings. We first need to find out how much 10% of his total earnings is:
   \[
   \text{Tax deduction} = 10\% \times \text{Total earnings} = 0.10 \times 1200
   \]
   \[
   \text{Tax deduction} = 120
   \]

3. **Calculate Adam's earnings after taxes:**
   To find out how much Adam will have after the tax deduction, we subtract the tax deduction from his total earnings:
   \[
   \text{Earnings after taxes} = \text{Total earnings} - \text{Tax deduction} = 1200 - 120
   \]
   \[
   \text{Earnings after taxes} = 1080
   \]

Thus, after working for 30 days and accounting for taxes, Adam will have earned **$1,080**.

Final answer: **$1,080**.
