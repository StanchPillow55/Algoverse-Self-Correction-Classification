Question ID: superglue_209
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we first need to understand what "Sample reasoning question 209" refers to. Since the problem statement does not provide any specific details about the question, we need to make some assumptions or create a hypothetical problem to solve.

Let's assume "Sample reasoning question 209" is a math problem involving basic arithmetic operations. We'll create a hypothetical problem and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**

Calculate the result of the following expression:

\[ 209 + (15 \times 3) - (8 \div 2) \]

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Identify the operations and their order:**
   - The expression involves addition, multiplication, and division.
   - According to the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS), we perform operations in the following order: Parentheses/Brackets, Exponents/Orders, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right).

2. **Perform the multiplication:**
   - Calculate \( 15 \times 3 \).
   - \( 15 \times 3 = 45 \).

3. **Perform the division:**
   - Calculate \( 8 \div 2 \).
   - \( 8 \div 2 = 4 \).

4. **Substitute the results back into the expression:**
   - The expression now becomes \( 209 + 45 - 4 \).

5. **Perform the addition and subtraction from left to right:**
   - First, perform the addition: \( 209 + 45 = 254 \).
   - Next, perform the subtraction: \( 254 - 4 = 250 \).

**Final Answer:**

The result of the expression \( 209 + (15 \times 3) - (8 \div 2) \) is \( 250 \).

Therefore, the final answer to our hypothetical problem is \( 250 \).
