==================================================

To solve the problem effectively, let's first clarify what "Sample reasoning question 209" might entail. Since the problem itself is not specified, I'll create a hypothetical math problem and solve it step-by-step. Let's assume the problem involves basic algebra and arithmetic reasoning.

**Problem:**

A store sells two types of candies: chocolate and gummy bears. The price of a chocolate candy is $0.50, and the price of a gummy bear is $0.30. If a customer buys a total of 20 candies and spends $8.00, how many of each type of candy did the customer buy?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( x \) be the number of chocolate candies.
   - Let \( y \) be the number of gummy bears.

2. **Set Up Equations:**
   - The total number of candies is 20: 
     \[
     x + y = 20
     \]
   - The total cost is $8.00:
     \[
     0.50x + 0.30y = 8.00
     \]

3. **Solve the System of Equations:**

   We have the system:
   \[
   \begin{align*}
   x + y &= 20 \quad \text{(Equation 1)} \\
   0.50x + 0.30y &= 8.00 \quad \text{(Equation 2)}
   \end{align*}
   \]

   **Step 1:** Solve Equation 1 for \( y \):
   \[
   y = 20 - x
   \]

   **Step 2:** Substitute \( y = 20 - x \) into Equation 2:
   \[
   0.50x + 0.30(20 - x) = 8.00
   \]

   **Step 3:** Simplify and solve for \( x \):
   \[
   0.50x + 6.00 - 0.30x = 8.00
   \]
   \[
   0.20x + 6.00 = 8.00
   \]
   \[
   0.20x = 2.00
   \]
   \[
   x = \frac{2.00}{0.20}
   \]
   \[
   x = 10
   \]

   **Step 4:** Substitute \( x = 10 \) back into Equation 1 to find \( y \):
   \[
   10 + y = 20
   \]
   \[
   y = 20 - 10
   \]
   \[
   y = 10
   \]

4. **Verify the Solution:**

   Check the total cost:
   \[
   0.50(10) + 0.30(10) = 5.00 + 3.00 = 8.00
   \]

   The calculations confirm the total cost is $8.00, matching the problem statement.

**Final Answer:**

The customer bought 10 chocolate candies and 10 gummy bears.
