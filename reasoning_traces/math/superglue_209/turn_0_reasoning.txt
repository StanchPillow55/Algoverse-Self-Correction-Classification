==================================================

It seems like the question you've provided, "Sample reasoning question 209," is not specific enough for me to provide a detailed solution. However, I can guide you through a general approach to solving math problems, which you can apply to a specific problem once you have it.

### General Approach to Solving Math Problems

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - Read the problem carefully.
   - Identify what is being asked.
   - Determine what information is given and what needs to be found.

2. **Devise a Plan:**
   - Think about the mathematical concepts that might be applicable.
   - Consider different strategies such as drawing a diagram, creating a table, or writing an equation.
   - Break the problem into smaller, more manageable parts if necessary.

3. **Carry Out the Plan:**
   - Execute the steps you have planned.
   - Perform calculations carefully.
   - Keep track of units and ensure consistency.

4. **Review/Check Your Work:**
   - Verify each step of your calculation.
   - Check if the answer makes sense in the context of the problem.
   - Review the problem to ensure all parts have been addressed.

5. **State the Final Answer:**
   - Clearly write down the final answer.
   - Include units if applicable.

### Example Problem

Let's apply this approach to a sample problem:

**Problem:** A rectangle has a length that is twice its width. If the perimeter of the rectangle is 36 units, find the dimensions of the rectangle.

**Step 1: Understand the Problem**
- We need to find the length and width of the rectangle.
- We know the perimeter is 36 units and the length is twice the width.

**Step 2: Devise a Plan**
- Use the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle: \( P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width}) \).
- Let the width be \( w \). Then the length is \( 2w \).

**Step 3: Carry Out the Plan**
- Substitute the expressions for length and width into the perimeter formula:
  \[
  36 = 2 \times (2w + w)
  \]
- Simplify and solve for \( w \):
  \[
  36 = 2 \times 3w
  \]
  \[
  36 = 6w
  \]
  \[
  w = \frac{36}{6} = 6
  \]
- Since the width \( w \) is 6, the length \( l \) is \( 2w = 12 \).

**Step 4: Review/Check Your Work**
- Check the calculations:
  - Width = 6, Length = 12
  - Perimeter = \( 2 \times (12 + 6) = 2 \times 18 = 36 \), which matches the given perimeter.

**Step 5: State the Final Answer**
- The dimensions of the rectangle are: Width = 6 units, Length = 12 units.
