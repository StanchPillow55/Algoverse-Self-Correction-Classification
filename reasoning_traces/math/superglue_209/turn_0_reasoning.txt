### General Approach to Solving a Math Reasoning Problem

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - Read the problem carefully.
   - Identify what is being asked.
   - Determine what information is given and what needs to be found.

2. **Devise a Plan:**
   - Consider possible strategies to solve the problem. This could include drawing a diagram, creating an equation, or breaking the problem into smaller parts.
   - Choose the most appropriate strategy based on the problem type.

3. **Carry Out the Plan:**
   - Execute the chosen strategy step by step.
   - Perform calculations carefully and check each step for accuracy.
   - Keep track of units and ensure consistency throughout the solution.

4. **Check Your Work:**
   - Review each step to ensure no mistakes were made.
   - Verify that the solution makes sense in the context of the problem.
   - Consider alternative methods to confirm the result.

5. **State the Final Answer:**
   - Clearly write the final answer, ensuring it addresses the question asked.
   - Include units if applicable.

### Example Problem and Solution

**Example Problem:**
A rectangle has a length that is twice its width. If the perimeter of the rectangle is 36 units, what are the dimensions of the rectangle?

**Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We need to find the length and width of the rectangle.
   - The perimeter is given as 36 units.
   - The length is twice the width.

2. **Devise a Plan:**
   - Let the width be \( w \).
   - Then the length is \( 2w \).
   - Use the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle: \( P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width}) \).

3. **Carry Out the Plan:**
   - Substitute the known values into the perimeter formula:
     \[
     36 = 2 \times (2w + w)
     \]
   - Simplify the equation:
     \[
     36 = 2 \times 3w
     \]
     \[
     36 = 6w
     \]
   - Solve for \( w \):
     \[
     w = \frac{36}{6} = 6
     \]
   - Find the length:
     \[
     \text{Length} = 2w = 2 \times 6 = 12
     \]

4. **Check Your Work:**
   - Verify the perimeter with the found dimensions:
     \[
     P = 2 \times (12 + 6) = 2 \times 18 = 36
     \]
   - The calculation is correct.

5. **State the Final Answer:**
   - The width of the rectangle is 6 units, and the length is 12 units.
