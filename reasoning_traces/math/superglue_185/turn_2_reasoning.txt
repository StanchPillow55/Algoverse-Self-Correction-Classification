Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem effectively, let's first clarify what "Sample reasoning question 185" might entail. Since the problem statement is not explicitly provided, I'll assume this is a placeholder for a typical math reasoning problem. Let's create a hypothetical problem and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**

A train travels from City A to City B, a distance of 300 miles. The train travels the first half of the distance at a speed of 60 miles per hour and the second half at a speed of 40 miles per hour. What is the average speed of the train for the entire journey?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - Total distance = 300 miles.
   - First half distance = 150 miles at 60 mph.
   - Second half distance = 150 miles at 40 mph.
   - We need to find the average speed for the entire journey.

2. **Calculate Time for Each Segment:**
   - Time = Distance / Speed.
   - Time for first half = 150 miles / 60 mph = 2.5 hours.
   - Time for second half = 150 miles / 40 mph = 3.75 hours.

3. **Calculate Total Time:**
   - Total time = Time for first half + Time for second half.
   - Total time = 2.5 hours + 3.75 hours = 6.25 hours.

4. **Calculate Average Speed:**
   - Average speed = Total distance / Total time.
   - Average speed = 300 miles / 6.25 hours = 48 mph.

5. **Verify the Solution:**
   - Check if the calculations are consistent with the given speeds and distances.
   - The total time calculated (6.25 hours) and the total distance (300 miles) should correctly yield the average speed when divided.

**Final Answer:**

The average speed of the train for the entire journey is 48 miles per hour.
