==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 185" refers to. Since no specific details or context are provided about this question, I'll demonstrate a general approach to solving a typical math problem, assuming it involves numerical reasoning or algebra.

Let's assume "Sample reasoning question 185" is a typical algebra problem. Here's a step-by-step approach to solving a hypothetical algebra problem:

**Hypothetical Problem:**
Solve for \( x \) in the equation: \( 3x + 5 = 20 \).

**Step 1: Understand the Problem**
The equation \( 3x + 5 = 20 \) is a linear equation in one variable. Our goal is to find the value of \( x \) that makes this equation true.

**Step 2: Isolate the Variable**
To solve for \( x \), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We can do this by performing inverse operations.

**Step 3: Perform Inverse Operations**
- First, subtract 5 from both sides of the equation to eliminate the constant term on the left side:
  \[
  3x + 5 - 5 = 20 - 5
  \]
  Simplifying both sides gives:
  \[
  3x = 15
  \]

- Next, divide both sides by 3 to solve for \( x \):
  \[
  \frac{3x}{3} = \frac{15}{3}
  \]
  Simplifying both sides gives:
  \[
  x = 5
  \]

**Step 4: Verify the Solution**
Substitute \( x = 5 \) back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies the equation:
\[
3(5) + 5 = 20
\]
Simplifying the left side gives:
\[
15 + 5 = 20
\]
\[
20 = 20
\]
Since both sides of the equation are equal, our solution \( x = 5 \) is verified.

**Final Answer:**
The solution to the equation \( 3x + 5 = 20 \) is \( x = 5 \).

This approach demonstrates a systematic method for solving a typical algebraic equation. If "Sample reasoning question 185" refers to a different type of problem, please provide more details or context for a specific solution.
