==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to determine how much Keenan spends per week on groceries, given that Madeline pays 60% of the total cost.

1. **Calculate the total monthly cost of groceries**: 
   The total cost of groceries per month is given as $400.

2. **Determine how much Madeline pays**:
   Since Madeline pays 60% of the total cost, we can calculate her share as follows:
   \[
   \text{Madeline's share} = 0.60 \times 400 = 240 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Calculate how much Keenan pays**:
   Since the total cost is $400 and Madeline pays $240, we can find out how much Keenan pays by subtracting Madeline's share from the total:
   \[
   \text{Keenan's share} = 400 - 240 = 160 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Determine how much Keenan spends per week**:
   Since the month is a four-week month, we can find out how much Keenan spends per week by dividing his total monthly share by the number of weeks:
   \[
   \text{Keenan's weekly spending} = \frac{160}{4} = 40 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Thus, Keenan spends **$40 per week** on groceries.

Final answer: **$40**
