Question ID: 870
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To find out how much Keenan spends per week on groceries, we can follow these steps:

1. **Determine the total amount Madeline pays**: Since Madeline pays 60% of the total grocery cost, we can calculate her contribution as follows:

   \[
   \text{Madeline's contribution} = 0.60 \times 400 = 240 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Calculate Keenan's contribution**: Since Madeline pays 60%, Keenan pays the remaining 40%. We can calculate his contribution as follows:

   \[
   \text{Keenan's contribution} = 0.40 \times 400 = 160 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Determine Keenan's weekly spending**: Since they spend $160 in total for the month, we need to find out how much Keenan spends per week. A four-week month means we divide his monthly contribution by 4:

   \[
   \text{Keenan's weekly spending} = \frac{160}{4} = 40 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Thus, Keenan spends **$40 per week** on groceries.

Final answer: **$40**
