==================================================

To determine how much John spent altogether, we need to consider all the expenses and how they are split among the people involved.

1. **Cost of Burgers:**
   - They buy 100 pounds of burgers at $3 per pound.
   - Total cost for burgers = 100 pounds ร $3/pound = $300.

2. **Cost of Condiments and Propane:**
   - The total cost for condiments and propane is $80.

3. **Total Shared Costs:**
   - The total shared costs (burgers + condiments and propane) = $300 + $80 = $380.

4. **Splitting the Shared Costs:**
   - The shared costs are split among John and 3 other people, making a total of 4 people.
   - Each person pays = $380 รท 4 = $95.

5. **Cost of Alcohol:**
   - John buys all the alcohol, which costs $200.

6. **Total Cost for John:**
   - John pays his share of the shared costs plus the full cost of the alcohol.
   - Total cost for John = $95 (his share of shared costs) + $200 (alcohol) = $295.

Therefore, John spent a total of $295 altogether.

**Final Answer:**
John spent $295 altogether.
