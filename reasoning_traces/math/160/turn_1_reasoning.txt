==================================================

To find out how much John spent altogether for the block party, we need to calculate the total costs of the burgers, condiments, propane, and alcohol.

1. **Calculate the cost of burgers:**
   - They bought 100 pounds of burgers at $3 per pound.
   \[
   \text{Cost of burgers} = 100 \text{ pounds} \times 3 \text{ dollars/pound} = 300 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Cost of condiments and propane:**
   - The total cost for condiments and propane is given as $80.
   \[
   \text{Cost of condiments and propane} = 80 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Cost of alcohol:**
   - John bought all the alcohol, which costs $200.
   \[
   \text{Cost of alcohol} = 200 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Calculate the total cost:**
   - Now, we add all the costs together to find the total amount spent by John.
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = \text{Cost of burgers} + \text{Cost of condiments and propane} + \text{Cost of alcohol}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = 300 \text{ dollars} + 80 \text{ dollars} + 200 \text{ dollars}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = 580 \text{ dollars}
   \]

5. **Final answer:**
   - Therefore, the total amount John spent altogether is **$580**.
