To determine how much John spent altogether for the block party, we need to calculate the total costs of the items purchased and then find out how much John contributed.

1. **Calculate the cost of the burgers:**
   - The cost per pound of burgers is $3.
   - They bought 100 pounds of burgers.
   - Total cost for burgers = Cost per pound Ã— Number of pounds
   \[
   \text{Total cost for burgers} = 3 \, \text{dollars/pound} \times 100 \, \text{pounds} = 300 \, \text{dollars}
   \]

2. **Calculate the cost of condiments and propane:**
   - The total cost for condiments and propane is given as $80.

3. **Calculate the cost of alcohol:**
   - The total cost for alcohol is given as $200.

4. **Calculate the total cost of the party:**
   - To find the total cost, we sum the costs of burgers, condiments, propane, and alcohol.
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = \text{Cost of burgers} + \text{Cost of condiments and propane} + \text{Cost of alcohol}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = 300 \, \text{dollars} + 80 \, \text{dollars} + 200 \, \text{dollars} = 580 \, \text{dollars}
   \]

5. **Determine John's total spending:**
   - John is responsible for the entire cost of the alcohol, which is $200.
   - The other costs (burgers and condiments/propane) are shared among John and the 3 other people, making a total of 4 people sharing these costs.

6. **Calculate the shared cost of burgers and condiments/propane:**
   - The combined cost of burgers and condiments/propane is:
   \[
   \text{Combined cost} = \text{Cost of burgers} + \text{Cost of condiments and propane} = 300 \, \text{dollars} + 80 \, \text{dollars} = 380 \, \text{dollars}
   \]
   - Since this cost is shared among 4 people, we divide by 4 to find out how much each person pays:
   \[
   \text{Shared cost per person} = \frac{380 \, \text{dollars}}{4} = 95 \, \text{dollars}
   \]

7. **Calculate John's total spending:**
   - John pays for his share of the burgers and condiments/propane, which is $95, plus the full cost of the alcohol, which is $200.
   \[
   \text{John's total spending} = \text{Shared cost} + \text{Cost of alcohol} = 95 \, \text{dollars} + 200 \, \text{dollars} = 295 \, \text{dollars}
   \]

Thus, the total amount John spent altogether is:
\[
\boxed{295 \, \text{dollars}}
\]
