==================================================

To solve the problem, we will follow the steps outlined in the question and perform the necessary calculations.

1. **Determine the water depth on Monday:**
   - The problem states that the depth of the water in the tank on Monday is 17 feet.

   \[
   \text{Depth on Monday} = 17 \text{ feet}
   \]

2. **Calculate the water depth on Tuesday:**
   - On Tuesday, the tank had 7 feet more water than it did on Monday. Therefore, we need to add 7 feet to the depth on Monday.

   \[
   \text{Depth on Tuesday} = \text{Depth on Monday} + 7 \text{ feet}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Depth on Tuesday} = 17 \text{ feet} + 7 \text{ feet} = 24 \text{ feet}
   \]

3. **Calculate the water depth on Wednesday:**
   - On Wednesday, the depth of the water is two-thirds of what it was on Tuesday. To find this, we will calculate two-thirds of the depth on Tuesday.

   \[
   \text{Depth on Wednesday} = \frac{2}{3} \times \text{Depth on Tuesday}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Depth on Wednesday} = \frac{2}{3} \times 24 \text{ feet}
   \]

   Now, we perform the multiplication:

   \[
   \text{Depth on Wednesday} = \frac{2 \times 24}{3} = \frac{48}{3} = 16 \text{ feet}
   \]

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The depth of the water in the tank on Wednesday is 16 feet.

Thus, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{16 \text{ feet}}
\]
