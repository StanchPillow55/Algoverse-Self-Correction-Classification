==================================================

To determine how much John spent altogether, we need to consider all the costs involved in the block party and how they are divided among John and the other people.

### Step 1: Calculate the Total Cost of Burgers
John and the others buy 100 pounds of burgers at $3 per pound. To find the total cost of the burgers, we multiply the number of pounds by the cost per pound:

\[
100 \text{ pounds} \times 3 \text{ dollars per pound} = 300 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the Total Cost of Condiments and Propane
The condiments and propane cost $80.

### Step 3: Calculate the Total Shared Cost
The total shared cost includes the cost of the burgers and the condiments and propane:

\[
300 \text{ dollars (burgers)} + 80 \text{ dollars (condiments and propane)} = 380 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Step 4: Divide the Shared Cost Among John and the 3 Others
The shared cost is split among John and 3 other people, which means there are 4 people sharing the cost.

\[
\frac{380 \text{ dollars}}{4 \text{ people}} = 95 \text{ dollars per person}
\]

This means John pays $95 as his share of the shared costs.

### Step 5: Calculate the Cost of Alcohol
John buys all the alcohol, which costs $200. This cost is not shared and is paid entirely by John.

### Step 6: Calculate John's Total Spending
To find out how much John spent altogether, we add his share of the shared costs to the cost of the alcohol:

\[
95 \text{ dollars (shared cost)} + 200 \text{ dollars (alcohol)} = 295 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Final Answer
John spent a total of $295 altogether.
