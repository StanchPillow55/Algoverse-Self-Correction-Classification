==================================================

To determine how much profit John makes in a year from subletting his apartment, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the Total Monthly Income from Subletting:**
   John sublets his apartment to 3 people, each paying $400 per month. Therefore, his total monthly income from subletting is calculated as follows:
   \[
   \text{Total Monthly Income} = 3 \times 400 = 1200 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Calculate John's Monthly Rent Expense:**
   John rents the apartment for $900 a month. This is his monthly expense.

3. **Calculate John's Monthly Profit:**
   To find the monthly profit, subtract the monthly rent expense from the total monthly income:
   \[
   \text{Monthly Profit} = \text{Total Monthly Income} - \text{Monthly Rent Expense} = 1200 - 900 = 300 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Calculate the Annual Profit:**
   Since the monthly profit is $300, we need to calculate the profit for a full year (12 months):
   \[
   \text{Annual Profit} = \text{Monthly Profit} \times 12 = 300 \times 12 = 3600 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Therefore, John makes a profit of $3,600 in a year from subletting his apartment.

**Final Answer:**
John makes a profit of $3,600 in a year.
