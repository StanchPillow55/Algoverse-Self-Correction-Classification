To determine John's profit from subletting his apartment, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total income from subletting:**
   John sublets his apartment to 3 people, and each person pays $400 per month. Therefore, the total income from subletting can be calculated as follows:

   \[
   \text{Total Income} = \text{Number of People} \times \text{Rent per Person}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total Income} = 3 \times 400 = 1200 \text{ dollars per month}
   \]

2. **Calculate the total expenses for renting the apartment:**
   John rents the apartment for $900 per month. Therefore, the total expenses for renting can be calculated as:

   \[
   \text{Total Expenses} = 900 \text{ dollars per month}
   \]

3. **Calculate the monthly profit:**
   The profit can be calculated by subtracting the total expenses from the total income:

   \[
   \text{Monthly Profit} = \text{Total Income} - \text{Total Expenses}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Monthly Profit} = 1200 - 900 = 300 \text{ dollars per month}
   \]

4. **Calculate the annual profit:**
   To find the annual profit, we multiply the monthly profit by the number of months in a year (12):

   \[
   \text{Annual Profit} = \text{Monthly Profit} \times 12
   \]
   \[
   \text{Annual Profit} = 300 \times 12 = 3600 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Thus, John's profit from subletting his apartment for a year is:

\[
\boxed{3600} \text{ dollars}
\]
