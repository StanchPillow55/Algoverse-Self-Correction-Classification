==================================================

To find the total number of messages James delivers, we need to calculate the number of messages he delivers to Mr. Yu based on the information given about Ms. Thompson.

1. **Messages to Ms. Thompson**: James delivers 66 messages to Ms. Thompson.

2. **Messages to Mr. Yu**: The problem states that James delivers 1/3 as many messages to Mr. Yu as he does to Ms. Thompson. To find the number of messages to Mr. Yu, we calculate:
   \[
   \text{Messages to Mr. Yu} = \frac{1}{3} \times \text{Messages to Ms. Thompson}
   \]
   Substituting the number of messages to Ms. Thompson:
   \[
   \text{Messages to Mr. Yu} = \frac{1}{3} \times 66
   \]

3. **Calculating Messages to Mr. Yu**:
   \[
   \text{Messages to Mr. Yu} = \frac{66}{3} = 22
   \]

4. **Total Messages Delivered**: Now, we need to find the total number of messages delivered by adding the messages delivered to both teachers:
   \[
   \text{Total Messages} = \text{Messages to Ms. Thompson} + \text{Messages to Mr. Yu}
   \]
   Substituting the values we have:
   \[
   \text{Total Messages} = 66 + 22
   \]

5. **Calculating Total Messages**:
   \[
   \text{Total Messages} = 88
   \]

Thus, the total number of messages James delivers is \( \boxed{88} \).
