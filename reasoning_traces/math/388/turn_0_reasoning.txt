To determine how much profit John makes in a year from subletting his apartment, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total monthly income from subletting:**
   John sublets his apartment to 3 people, and each person pays $400 per month. Therefore, the total monthly income from subletting is calculated as follows:
   \[
   \text{Total monthly income} = 3 \times 400 = 1200 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Calculate the monthly rent John pays:**
   John rents the apartment for $900 a month.

3. **Calculate the monthly profit:**
   The monthly profit is the difference between the total monthly income from subletting and the monthly rent John pays. Therefore, the monthly profit is:
   \[
   \text{Monthly profit} = \text{Total monthly income} - \text{Monthly rent}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Monthly profit} = 1200 - 900 = 300 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Calculate the annual profit:**
   Since the monthly profit is $300, to find the annual profit, we multiply the monthly profit by the number of months in a year (12 months):
   \[
   \text{Annual profit} = \text{Monthly profit} \times 12
   \]
   \[
   \text{Annual profit} = 300 \times 12 = 3600 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Therefore, John makes a profit of $3600 in a year from subletting his apartment.

**Final Answer:**
John makes a profit of $3600 in a year.
