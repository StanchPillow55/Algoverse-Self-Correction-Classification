==================================================

To determine how much profit John makes in a year from subletting his apartment, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total monthly income from subletting:**
   - John sublets his apartment to 3 people.
   - Each person pays $400 per month.
   - Therefore, the total monthly income from subletting is:
     \[
     \text{Total Monthly Income} = 3 \times 400 = 1200 \text{ dollars}
     \]

2. **Calculate John's monthly rent expense:**
   - John rents the apartment for $900 a month.

3. **Calculate John's monthly profit:**
   - Profit is calculated as the total income minus the expenses.
   - Therefore, John's monthly profit is:
     \[
     \text{Monthly Profit} = \text{Total Monthly Income} - \text{Monthly Rent Expense} = 1200 - 900 = 300 \text{ dollars}
     \]

4. **Calculate John's annual profit:**
   - Since the monthly profit is $300, to find the annual profit, we multiply the monthly profit by the number of months in a year (12):
     \[
     \text{Annual Profit} = \text{Monthly Profit} \times 12 = 300 \times 12 = 3600 \text{ dollars}
     \]

Thus, John makes a profit of $3,600 in a year from subletting his apartment.

**Final Answer:**
John makes a profit of $3,600 in a year.
