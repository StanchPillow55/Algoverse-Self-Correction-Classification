==================================================

To solve the problem, we first need to understand what "Sample math problem 243" refers to. Since the problem itself isn't specified, I'll assume it's a generic math problem involving the number 243. Let's explore a few possibilities:

### Possibility 1: Prime Factorization of 243

Let's find the prime factorization of 243.

1. **Identify if 243 is divisible by 2:**  
   243 is an odd number, so it's not divisible by 2.

2. **Check divisibility by 3:**  
   The sum of the digits of 243 is \(2 + 4 + 3 = 9\), which is divisible by 3. Therefore, 243 is divisible by 3.

3. **Divide 243 by 3:**  
   \[
   243 \div 3 = 81
   \]

4. **Repeat the process for 81:**  
   The sum of the digits of 81 is \(8 + 1 = 9\), which is divisible by 3.

5. **Divide 81 by 3:**  
   \[
   81 \div 3 = 27
   \]

6. **Repeat the process for 27:**  
   The sum of the digits of 27 is \(2 + 7 = 9\), which is divisible by 3.

7. **Divide 27 by 3:**  
   \[
   27 \div 3 = 9
   \]

8. **Repeat the process for 9:**  
   The sum of the digits of 9 is \(9\), which is divisible by 3.

9. **Divide 9 by 3:**  
   \[
   9 \div 3 = 3
   \]

10. **Divide 3 by 3:**  
    \[
    3 \div 3 = 1
    \]

The prime factorization of 243 is \(3^5\).

### Possibility 2: Calculating the Cube Root of 243

Let's calculate the cube root of 243.

1. **Estimate the cube root:**  
   Since \(5^3 = 125\) and \(6^3 = 216\), and \(7^3 = 343\), the cube root of 243 is between 6 and 7.

2. **Check 6.5:**  
   \[
   6.5^3 = 6.5 \times 6.5 \times 6.5 = 42.25 \times 6.5 = 274.625
   \]
   This is greater than 243.

3. **Check 6.3:**  
   \[
   6.3^3 = 6.3 \times 6.3 \times 6.3 = 39.69 \times 6.3 = 250.047
   \]
   This is still greater than 243.

4. **Check 6.2:**  
   \[
   6.2^3 = 6.2 \times 6.2 \times 6.2 = 38.44 \times 6.2 = 238.328
   \]
   This is less than 243.

5. **Refine between 6.2 and 6.3:**  
   Since \(6.2^3 < 243 < 6.3^3\), the cube root of 243 is approximately 6.2.

### Final Answer

Since the problem was not specified, I explored two possibilities involving the number 243. The prime factorization of 243 is \(3^5\), and the approximate cube root of 243 is 6.2. If you have a specific problem in mind, please provide more details for a precise solution.
