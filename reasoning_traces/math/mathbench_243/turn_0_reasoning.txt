==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what the problem is asking. Since the problem statement is "Sample math problem 243," it seems like there might be some missing information or context. However, let's assume that "243" is the number we need to work with, and I'll demonstrate a few mathematical operations and concepts involving the number 243.

### Step 1: Prime Factorization of 243

To find the prime factorization of 243, we start by dividing it by the smallest prime number, which is 2. Since 243 is odd, it is not divisible by 2. We move to the next smallest prime number, which is 3.

1. Divide 243 by 3:
   \[
   243 \div 3 = 81
   \]

2. Divide 81 by 3:
   \[
   81 \div 3 = 27
   \]

3. Divide 27 by 3:
   \[
   27 \div 3 = 9
   \]

4. Divide 9 by 3:
   \[
   9 \div 3 = 3
   \]

5. Divide 3 by 3:
   \[
   3 \div 3 = 1
   \]

The division process ends when we reach 1. Therefore, the prime factorization of 243 is:
\[
243 = 3^5
\]

### Step 2: Check if 243 is a Perfect Power

A perfect power is a number that can be expressed as \(a^b\), where \(a\) and \(b\) are integers greater than 1. From the prime factorization, we see that 243 is \(3^5\), which is a perfect power.

### Step 3: Calculate the Square Root of 243

To find the square root of 243, we can use its prime factorization:
\[
\sqrt{243} = \sqrt{3^5} = \sqrt{(3^2)^2 \times 3} = 3^2 \times \sqrt{3} = 9\sqrt{3}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the Cube Root of 243

To find the cube root of 243, we use its prime factorization:
\[
\sqrt[3]{243} = \sqrt[3]{3^5} = \sqrt[3]{(3^3) \times 3^2} = 3 \times \sqrt[3]{3^2} = 3 \times \sqrt[3]{9}
\]

### Conclusion

Based on the operations and analysis performed, we have:

- The prime factorization of 243 is \(3^5\).
- 243 is a perfect power, specifically \(3^5\).
- The square root of 243 is \(9\sqrt{3}\).
- The cube root of 243 is \(3 \times \sqrt[3]{9}\).

If the problem required a specific operation or context involving the number 243, please provide additional details. Otherwise, the above steps cover various mathematical aspects of the number 243.
