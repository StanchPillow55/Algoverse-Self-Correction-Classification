To solve the problem, we first need to understand what "Sample math problem 243" refers to. Since there is no specific problem statement provided, I will assume that you are asking for a solution to a generic math problem involving the number 243. Let's consider a few possibilities and solve them:

### Problem 1: Find the Prime Factorization of 243

**Step 1: Check divisibility by the smallest prime number, 2.**

243 is an odd number, so it is not divisible by 2.

**Step 2: Check divisibility by the next smallest prime number, 3.**

To check divisibility by 3, sum the digits of 243:  
\(2 + 4 + 3 = 9\).  
Since 9 is divisible by 3, 243 is also divisible by 3.

**Step 3: Divide 243 by 3.**

\[ 243 \div 3 = 81 \]

**Step 4: Repeat the process for 81.**

Sum the digits of 81:  
\(8 + 1 = 9\).  
Since 9 is divisible by 3, 81 is also divisible by 3.

**Step 5: Divide 81 by 3.**

\[ 81 \div 3 = 27 \]

**Step 6: Repeat the process for 27.**

Sum the digits of 27:  
\(2 + 7 = 9\).  
Since 9 is divisible by 3, 27 is also divisible by 3.

**Step 7: Divide 27 by 3.**

\[ 27 \div 3 = 9 \]

**Step 8: Repeat the process for 9.**

Sum the digits of 9:  
\(9\).  
Since 9 is divisible by 3, 9 is also divisible by 3.

**Step 9: Divide 9 by 3.**

\[ 9 \div 3 = 3 \]

**Step 10: Divide 3 by 3.**

\[ 3 \div 3 = 1 \]

Now, we have completely factored 243 into prime factors. The prime factorization of 243 is:

\[ 243 = 3^5 \]

### Problem 2: Calculate the Square Root of 243

**Step 1: Use the prime factorization to simplify the square root.**

From the previous problem, we know that \(243 = 3^5\).

**Step 2: Simplify the square root using the prime factorization.**

\[ \sqrt{243} = \sqrt{3^5} \]

We can express \(3^5\) as \(3^4 \times 3^1\), which is \((3^2)^2 \times 3\).

\[ \sqrt{243} = \sqrt{(3^2)^2 \times 3} = 3^2 \times \sqrt{3} = 9\sqrt{3} \]

### Final Answers

1. The prime factorization of 243 is \(3^5\).
2. The square root of 243 is \(9\sqrt{3}\).
