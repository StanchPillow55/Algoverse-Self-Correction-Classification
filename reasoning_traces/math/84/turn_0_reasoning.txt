==================================================

To determine how many different rooms Hans could be checked into, we need to analyze the situation step by step.

1. **Understanding the Hotel Structure**: 
   - The hotel has a total of 10 floors.
   - Each floor has 10 identical rooms.

2. **Identifying the Unavailable Floor**:
   - Due to an accident, the last floor (10th floor) is unavailable for guests. This means Hans cannot be checked into any room on the 10th floor.

3. **Calculating Available Floors**:
   - Since the 10th floor is unavailable, we only have the first 9 floors available for guests.

4. **Calculating Total Rooms**:
   - Each of the 9 available floors has 10 rooms.
   - Therefore, the total number of available rooms can be calculated as follows:
     \[
     \text{Total available rooms} = \text{Number of floors} \times \text{Number of rooms per floor}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total available rooms} = 9 \text{ floors} \times 10 \text{ rooms/floor} = 90 \text{ rooms}
     \]

5. **Conclusion**:
   - Since there are 90 rooms available for Hans to be checked into, we conclude that the total number of different rooms he could be assigned to is 90.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{90}
\]
