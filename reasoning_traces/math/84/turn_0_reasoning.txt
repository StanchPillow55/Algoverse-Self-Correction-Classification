Question ID: 84
Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

The hotel has 10 floors with 10 rooms on each floor, which means there are a total of 10*10 = 100 rooms in the hotel.

However, the last floor is unavailable for guests. Since each floor has 10 rooms, this means there are 10 rooms that are unavailable.

So, the number of rooms available for Hans to check into is the total number of rooms in the hotel minus the number of unavailable rooms. 

This is calculated as 100 total rooms - 10 unavailable rooms = 90 available rooms.

Therefore, Hans could be checked into 90 different rooms.
