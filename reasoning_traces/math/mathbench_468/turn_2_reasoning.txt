==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 468," we first need to understand what the problem is asking. However, the problem statement "Sample math problem 468" is not specific and does not provide any details or context about what needs to be solved. Therefore, I will create a hypothetical math problem based on the number 468 and solve it step by step.

Let's assume the problem is as follows:

**Problem:**  
Find the prime factorization of the number 468.

**Solution:**

Step 1: **Identify if 468 is divisible by the smallest prime number, which is 2.**

Since 468 is an even number, it is divisible by 2. We divide 468 by 2:

\[ 468 \div 2 = 234 \]

So, 468 = 2 × 234.

Step 2: **Check if 234 is divisible by 2.**

234 is also an even number, so it is divisible by 2. We divide 234 by 2:

\[ 234 \div 2 = 117 \]

So, 234 = 2 × 117, and thus 468 = 2 × 2 × 117.

Step 3: **Check if 117 is divisible by 2.**

117 is not an even number, so it is not divisible by 2. We move to the next smallest prime number, which is 3.

Step 4: **Check if 117 is divisible by 3.**

To check divisibility by 3, we sum the digits of 117:  
1 + 1 + 7 = 9

Since 9 is divisible by 3, 117 is also divisible by 3. We divide 117 by 3:

\[ 117 \div 3 = 39 \]

So, 117 = 3 × 39, and thus 468 = 2 × 2 × 3 × 39.

Step 5: **Check if 39 is divisible by 3.**

Sum the digits of 39:  
3 + 9 = 12

Since 12 is divisible by 3, 39 is also divisible by 3. We divide 39 by 3:

\[ 39 \div 3 = 13 \]

So, 39 = 3 × 13, and thus 468 = 2 × 2 × 3 × 3 × 13.

Step 6: **Check if 13 is a prime number.**

13 is a prime number because it is only divisible by 1 and itself.

Therefore, the prime factorization of 468 is:

\[ 468 = 2^2 \times 3^2 \times 13 \]

**Final Answer:**  
The prime factorization of 468 is \( 2^2 \times 3^2 \times 13 \).
