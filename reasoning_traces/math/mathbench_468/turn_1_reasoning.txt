Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 468," we need to first understand what the problem entails. However, the problem statement "Sample math problem 468" is not specific, and it doesn't provide any details or context about what kind of math problem it is. Therefore, I will assume that "468" refers to a number that we need to analyze or perform operations on. Let's explore a few possibilities of what the problem could involve:

### Possibility 1: Prime Factorization
One common type of math problem involving a number is to find its prime factorization. Let's find the prime factorization of 468.

1. **Divide by the smallest prime number, 2:**
   - 468 is even, so divide by 2:
   \[
   468 \div 2 = 234
   \]

2. **Divide 234 by 2 again:**
   - 234 is also even, so divide by 2:
   \[
   234 \div 2 = 117
   \]

3. **Divide 117 by the next smallest prime number, 3:**
   - Sum of digits of 117 is \(1 + 1 + 7 = 9\), which is divisible by 3. So, divide by 3:
   \[
   117 \div 3 = 39
   \]

4. **Divide 39 by 3 again:**
   - Sum of digits of 39 is \(3 + 9 = 12\), which is divisible by 3. So, divide by 3:
   \[
   39 \div 3 = 13
   \]

5. **Check if 13 is a prime number:**
   - 13 is a prime number.

Thus, the prime factorization of 468 is:
\[
468 = 2^2 \times 3^2 \times 13
\]

### Possibility 2: Sum of Digits
Another common problem might involve finding the sum of the digits of 468.

- The digits of 468 are 4, 6, and 8.
- Sum of the digits:
  \[
  4 + 6 + 8 = 18
  \]

### Possibility 3: Divisibility Check
We could also check if 468 is divisible by certain numbers, such as 9 or 11.

- **Divisibility by 9:**
  - A number is divisible by 9 if the sum of its digits is divisible by 9.
  - Sum of digits is 18, which is divisible by 9.
  - Therefore, 468 is divisible by 9.

- **Divisibility by 11:**
  - A number is divisible by 11 if the difference between the sum of the digits in odd positions and the sum of the digits in even positions is a multiple of 11.
  - For 468, the sum of digits in odd positions (4 and 8) is \(4 + 8 = 12\).
  - The sum of digits in even positions (6) is 6.
  - Difference is \(12 - 6 = 6\), which is not divisible by 11.
  - Therefore, 468 is not divisible by 11.

### Final Answer
Since the problem statement was not specific, I explored several possibilities. Here are the results:

1. **Prime Factorization:** \(468 = 2^2 \times 3^2 \times 13\)
2. **Sum of Digits:** 18
3. **Divisibility:**
   - Divisible by 9
   - Not divisible by 11

If you have a specific type of problem in mind regarding the number 468, please provide additional details, and I can address that specific problem.
