==================================================

To solve the problem labeled "Sample math problem 468," we need to first understand what the problem is asking. However, since the problem statement is not provided, I'll demonstrate how to approach a typical math problem by creating a hypothetical example.

Let's assume the problem is as follows:

**Problem Statement:**
A rectangle has a length that is 3 times its width. If the perimeter of the rectangle is 48 units, find the dimensions of the rectangle.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We have a rectangle with a length (L) and width (W).
   - The length is 3 times the width: \( L = 3W \).
   - The perimeter of the rectangle is 48 units.

2. **Recall the Formula for Perimeter:**
   - The perimeter (P) of a rectangle is given by the formula:
     \[
     P = 2L + 2W
     \]

3. **Substitute the Known Values:**
   - We know the perimeter is 48 units, so:
     \[
     48 = 2L + 2W
     \]

4. **Substitute the Expression for L:**
   - Since \( L = 3W \), substitute this into the perimeter equation:
     \[
     48 = 2(3W) + 2W
     \]

5. **Simplify the Equation:**
   - Simplify the equation:
     \[
     48 = 6W + 2W
     \]
     \[
     48 = 8W
     \]

6. **Solve for W:**
   - Divide both sides by 8 to solve for W:
     \[
     W = \frac{48}{8} = 6
     \]

7. **Find the Length L:**
   - Since \( L = 3W \), substitute W = 6 into the equation for L:
     \[
     L = 3 \times 6 = 18
     \]

8. **Verify the Solution:**
   - Check the perimeter with the found dimensions:
     \[
     P = 2L + 2W = 2(18) + 2(6) = 36 + 12 = 48
     \]
   - The calculated perimeter matches the given perimeter, confirming our solution is correct.

**Final Answer:**
The dimensions of the rectangle are:
- Width (W) = 6 units
- Length (L) = 18 units

This is a complete solution to the hypothetical problem based on the given instructions. If you have a specific problem labeled "Sample math problem 468," please provide the details so I can solve it accurately.
