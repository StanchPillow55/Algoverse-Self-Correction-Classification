==================================================

To solve the problem, we first need to understand what "Sample math problem 468" refers to. Since no specific details are provided about the problem, I'll create a hypothetical math problem involving the number 468 and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**
Find the prime factorization of the number 468 and determine if it is a perfect square.

**Step 1: Prime Factorization of 468**

To find the prime factorization, we divide 468 by the smallest prime number and continue the process with the quotient until we reach 1.

1. **Divide by 2 (smallest prime number):**
   \[
   468 \div 2 = 234
   \]
   So, 468 = 2 × 234.

2. **Divide 234 by 2:**
   \[
   234 \div 2 = 117
   \]
   So, 234 = 2 × 117, and therefore 468 = 2 × 2 × 117.

3. **Divide 117 by 3 (next smallest prime number):**
   \[
   117 \div 3 = 39
   \]
   So, 117 = 3 × 39, and therefore 468 = 2 × 2 × 3 × 39.

4. **Divide 39 by 3:**
   \[
   39 \div 3 = 13
   \]
   So, 39 = 3 × 13, and therefore 468 = 2 × 2 × 3 × 3 × 13.

5. **13 is a prime number, so we stop here.**

Thus, the prime factorization of 468 is:
\[
468 = 2^2 \times 3^2 \times 13
\]

**Step 2: Determine if 468 is a Perfect Square**

A number is a perfect square if all the exponents in its prime factorization are even.

From the prime factorization:
\[
468 = 2^2 \times 3^2 \times 13^1
\]

- The exponents of 2 and 3 are even (2), but the exponent of 13 is 1, which is odd.

Since not all exponents are even, 468 is not a perfect square.

**Final Answer:**

The prime factorization of 468 is \(2^2 \times 3^2 \times 13\). The number 468 is not a perfect square.
