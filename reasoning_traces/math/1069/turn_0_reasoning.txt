Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we will follow these steps:

1. **Determine the total number of trucks dispatched.**
   - Mr. Hezekiah had 20 trucks.

2. **Determine the amount of fertiliser each truck carries.**
   - Each truck carries 20 tons of fertiliser.

3. **Calculate the total amount of fertiliser dispatched.**
   - Total fertiliser = Number of trucks × Amount of fertiliser per truck
   \[
   \text{Total fertiliser} = 20 \text{ trucks} \times 20 \text{ tons/truck} = 400 \text{ tons}
   \]

4. **Determine the number of trucks that experienced mechanical failures.**
   - A quarter of the trucks had mechanical failures. 
   - Number of trucks with mechanical failures = \( \frac{1}{4} \times 20 \)
   \[
   \text{Trucks with mechanical failures} = 5 \text{ trucks}
   \]

5. **Calculate the number of trucks that successfully delivered the fertiliser.**
   - Successful deliveries = Total trucks - Trucks with mechanical failures
   \[
   \text{Successful deliveries} = 20 \text{ trucks} - 5 \text{ trucks} = 15 \text{ trucks}
   \]

6. **Calculate the total amount of fertiliser that reached the farmers.**
   - Total fertiliser delivered = Successful deliveries × Amount of fertiliser per truck
   \[
   \text{Total fertiliser delivered} = 15 \text{ trucks} \times 20 \text{ tons/truck} = 300 \text{ tons}
   \]

Finally, the total number of tons of fertiliser that reached the farmers that day is **300 tons**. 

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{300}
\]
