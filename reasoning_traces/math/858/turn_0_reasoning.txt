==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to track the number of infected people over the course of three days, given that each infected person infects six others each day.

### Step 1: Initial Condition
We start with 10 infected people on Day 0.

### Step 2: Daily Infections
Each infected person infects 6 new people each day. Therefore, we can calculate the number of new infections each day based on the number of infected people from the previous day.

### Day-by-Day Breakdown

#### Day 1:
- **Initial infected**: 10
- **New infections**: Each of the 10 infected people infects 6 others.
  
  \[
  \text{New infections} = 10 \times 6 = 60
  \]

- **Total infected by the end of Day 1**:
  
  \[
  \text{Total infected} = \text{Initial infected} + \text{New infections} = 10 + 60 = 70
  \]

#### Day 2:
- **Initial infected**: 70 (from the end of Day 1)
- **New infections**: Each of the 70 infected people infects 6 others.
  
  \[
  \text{New infections} = 70 \times 6 = 420
  \]

- **Total infected by the end of Day 2**:
  
  \[
  \text{Total infected} = 70 + 420 = 490
  \]

#### Day 3:
- **Initial infected**: 490 (from the end of Day 2)
- **New infections**: Each of the 490 infected people infects 6 others.
  
  \[
  \text{New infections} = 490 \times 6 = 2940
  \]

- **Total infected by the end of Day 3**:
  
  \[
  \text{Total infected} = 490 + 2940 = 3430
  \]

### Final Answer
After three days, the total number of infected people is:

\[
\boxed{3430}
\]
