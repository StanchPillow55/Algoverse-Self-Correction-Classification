==================================================

To find out how far Hadley walked in total, we need to break down the distances he walked to each location and then sum them up.

1. **Distance to the grocery store**: 
   Hadley walked 2 miles to the grocery store.

2. **Distance to the pet store**: 
   He walked "1 less than two miles" to the pet store. 
   - To calculate this, we take 2 miles and subtract 1 mile:
   \[
   2 - 1 = 1 \text{ mile}
   \]

3. **Distance back home**: 
   He walked "one less than four miles" back home.
   - To calculate this, we take 4 miles and subtract 1 mile:
   \[
   4 - 1 = 3 \text{ miles}
   \]

Now we have the distances for each leg of his journey:
- Grocery store: 2 miles
- Pet store: 1 mile
- Back home: 3 miles

Next, we sum these distances to find the total distance Hadley walked:
\[
\text{Total distance} = \text{Distance to grocery store} + \text{Distance to pet store} + \text{Distance back home}
\]
\[
\text{Total distance} = 2 + 1 + 3
\]
\[
\text{Total distance} = 6 \text{ miles}
\]

Thus, the total distance Hadley walked in his boots is \( \boxed{6} \) miles.
