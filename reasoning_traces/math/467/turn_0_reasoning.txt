Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total distance Hadley walked in his cowboy boots by adding up the distances for each segment of his journey.

1. **Walking to the Grocery Store:**
   - Hadley walked 2 miles to the grocery store.
   - Distance = 2 miles

2. **Walking to the Pet Store:**
   - He then walked 1 less than two miles to the pet store.
   - To find this distance, we calculate \(2 - 1 = 1\) mile.
   - Distance = 1 mile

3. **Walking Back Home:**
   - Finally, Hadley walked one less than four miles back home.
   - To find this distance, we calculate \(4 - 1 = 3\) miles.
   - Distance = 3 miles

Now, we add up all the distances to find the total distance Hadley walked:

\[
\text{Total Distance} = 2 \text{ miles} + 1 \text{ mile} + 3 \text{ miles}
\]

\[
\text{Total Distance} = 6 \text{ miles}
\]

Therefore, Hadley walked a total of 6 miles in his cowboy boots.

**Final Answer: 6 miles**
