==================================================

To solve the problem, I'll first need to understand what "Sample math problem 176" refers to. Since I don't have access to external databases or specific problem sets, I'll create a hypothetical math problem that could be labeled as "Sample math problem 176" and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem 176:**

*Problem Statement:*
A rectangle has a length that is 3 times its width. If the perimeter of the rectangle is 64 units, find the dimensions of the rectangle.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( w \) be the width of the rectangle.
   - Since the length is 3 times the width, the length \( l \) can be expressed as \( l = 3w \).

2. **Perimeter of a Rectangle:**
   - The formula for the perimeter \( P \) of a rectangle is given by:
     \[
     P = 2l + 2w
     \]
   - According to the problem, the perimeter is 64 units. Therefore, we have:
     \[
     2l + 2w = 64
     \]

3. **Substitute the Expression for Length:**
   - Substitute \( l = 3w \) into the perimeter equation:
     \[
     2(3w) + 2w = 64
     \]

4. **Simplify the Equation:**
   - Simplify the equation:
     \[
     6w + 2w = 64
     \]
     \[
     8w = 64
     \]

5. **Solve for Width:**
   - Divide both sides by 8 to solve for \( w \):
     \[
     w = \frac{64}{8} = 8
     \]

6. **Find the Length:**
   - Use the expression for length \( l = 3w \) to find \( l \):
     \[
     l = 3 \times 8 = 24
     \]

7. **Verify the Solution:**
   - Check the perimeter with the found dimensions:
     \[
     P = 2l + 2w = 2(24) + 2(8) = 48 + 16 = 64
     \]
   - The calculated perimeter matches the given perimeter, confirming the solution is correct.

**Final Answer:**
The dimensions of the rectangle are:
- Width: 8 units
- Length: 24 units
