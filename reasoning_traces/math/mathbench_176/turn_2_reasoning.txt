Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem effectively, I need to first understand what "Sample math problem 176" refers to. Since I don't have access to external databases or specific problem sets, I'll create a hypothetical math problem and solve it step by step. 

Let's assume "Sample math problem 176" is the following:

**Problem:**
Solve for \( x \) in the equation:
\[ 3x + 5 = 2x + 11 \]

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Equation:**
   The given equation is a linear equation in one variable, \( x \). Our goal is to isolate \( x \) on one side of the equation to find its value.

2. **Simplify the Equation:**
   Start by getting all terms involving \( x \) on one side and constant terms on the other side. We can do this by subtracting \( 2x \) from both sides of the equation:

   \[
   3x + 5 - 2x = 2x + 11 - 2x
   \]

   Simplifying both sides gives:

   \[
   x + 5 = 11
   \]

3. **Isolate \( x \):**
   Next, we need to isolate \( x \) by removing the constant term on the left side. Subtract 5 from both sides:

   \[
   x + 5 - 5 = 11 - 5
   \]

   Simplifying both sides results in:

   \[
   x = 6
   \]

4. **Verify the Solution:**
   Substitute \( x = 6 \) back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies the equation:

   \[
   3(6) + 5 = 2(6) + 11
   \]

   Calculate both sides:

   \[
   18 + 5 = 12 + 11
   \]

   \[
   23 = 23
   \]

   Since both sides of the equation are equal, our solution is verified.

**Final Answer:**
The solution to the equation \( 3x + 5 = 2x + 11 \) is \( x = 6 \).
