Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem effectively, I need to understand the context and details of "Sample reasoning question 218." However, since the question itself is not provided, I'll demonstrate a general approach to solving a typical math problem by creating a sample problem and solving it step-by-step.

**Sample Problem:**
A farmer has a rectangular field that is 100 meters long and 60 meters wide. He wants to build a fence around the entire field and also divide the field into two equal smaller rectangles by adding a fence parallel to the shorter side. Calculate the total length of the fence needed.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We have a rectangular field with dimensions 100 meters (length) and 60 meters (width).
   - We need to calculate the total length of the fence required to enclose the entire field and divide it into two equal smaller rectangles.

2. **Calculate the Perimeter of the Field:**
   - The perimeter \( P \) of a rectangle is given by the formula:
     \[
     P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width})
     \]
   - Substitute the given dimensions:
     \[
     P = 2 \times (100 + 60) = 2 \times 160 = 320 \text{ meters}
     \]
   - This is the length of the fence needed to enclose the entire field.

3. **Calculate the Length of the Dividing Fence:**
   - The field is divided into two equal smaller rectangles by a fence parallel to the shorter side (width).
   - The length of this dividing fence is equal to the length of the field, which is 100 meters.

4. **Calculate the Total Length of the Fence:**
   - Add the perimeter of the field and the length of the dividing fence:
     \[
     \text{Total length of the fence} = 320 + 100 = 420 \text{ meters}
     \]

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The total length of the fence needed is 420 meters.

**Final Answer:**
The total length of the fence required is 420 meters.
