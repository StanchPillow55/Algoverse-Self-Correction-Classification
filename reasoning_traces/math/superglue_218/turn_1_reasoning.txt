==================================================

To solve the problem effectively, let's first clarify what "Sample reasoning question 218" entails. Since the problem statement is not explicitly provided, I'll demonstrate a structured approach to solving a generic math problem, assuming it involves typical reasoning and calculation steps.

### Step-by-Step Approach:

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - Identify what is being asked.
   - Determine the known variables and the unknowns.
   - Look for keywords that indicate mathematical operations (e.g., sum, difference, product, quotient).

2. **Devise a Plan:**
   - Choose an appropriate strategy to solve the problem. This could involve algebraic manipulation, drawing diagrams, or breaking the problem into smaller parts.

3. **Carry Out the Plan:**
   - Execute the chosen strategy step by step.
   - Perform calculations carefully, showing all work.
   - Keep track of units and ensure consistency.

4. **Check Your Work:**
   - Verify each step for accuracy.
   - Ensure the solution makes sense in the context of the problem.
   - Recalculate if necessary to confirm results.

5. **State the Final Answer:**
   - Clearly present the solution, ensuring it answers the question posed.

### Example Problem:

Let's assume "Sample reasoning question 218" is a problem involving basic algebra:

**Problem:** Solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).

#### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We need to find the value of \( x \) that satisfies the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).

2. **Devise a Plan:**
   - Isolate \( x \) by performing inverse operations.

3. **Carry Out the Plan:**
   - Start with the equation: \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).
   - Subtract 3 from both sides to isolate the term with \( x \):
     \[
     2x + 3 - 3 = 11 - 3
     \]
     \[
     2x = 8
     \]
   - Divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( x \):
     \[
     \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{8}{2}
     \]
     \[
     x = 4
     \]

4. **Check Your Work:**
   - Substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation to verify:
     \[
     2(4) + 3 = 8 + 3 = 11
     \]
   - The left side equals the right side, confirming our solution is correct.

5. **State the Final Answer:**
   - The solution to the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \) is \( x = 4 \).

By following this structured approach, we ensure that our reasoning is clear and our calculations are accurate. If "Sample reasoning question 218" refers to a specific problem, please provide additional details for a tailored solution.
