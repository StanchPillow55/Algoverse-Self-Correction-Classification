==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 218" refers to. However, since the problem statement does not provide any specific details or context about "Sample reasoning question 218," I will assume that this is a placeholder for a typical math problem. Without specific details, I will create a hypothetical math problem and solve it step by step.

Let's assume "Sample reasoning question 218" is a basic algebra problem:

**Problem:**
Solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 3x + 5 = 20 \).

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Equation:**
   The equation given is \( 3x + 5 = 20 \). Our goal is to solve for \( x \).

2. **Isolate the Variable:**
   To solve for \( x \), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We start by eliminating the constant term on the left side of the equation.

   \[
   3x + 5 = 20
   \]

   Subtract 5 from both sides:

   \[
   3x + 5 - 5 = 20 - 5
   \]

   Simplifying both sides gives:

   \[
   3x = 15
   \]

3. **Solve for \( x \):**
   Now, we need to solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides of the equation by 3.

   \[
   \frac{3x}{3} = \frac{15}{3}
   \]

   Simplifying both sides gives:

   \[
   x = 5
   \]

4. **Verify the Solution:**
   To ensure our solution is correct, we substitute \( x = 5 \) back into the original equation to verify:

   \[
   3(5) + 5 = 20
   \]

   Simplifying the left side:

   \[
   15 + 5 = 20
   \]

   \[
   20 = 20
   \]

   Since both sides of the equation are equal, our solution \( x = 5 \) is verified.

**Final Answer:**
The solution to the equation \( 3x + 5 = 20 \) is \( x = 5 \).
