==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 218" refers to. However, since the question is not explicitly provided, I will demonstrate a general approach to solving a typical math reasoning problem. Let's assume a hypothetical math problem and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**

A farmer has a rectangular field with a length that is twice its width. The perimeter of the field is 300 meters. What are the dimensions of the field?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We have a rectangular field.
   - Let the width of the field be \( w \) meters.
   - The length of the field is twice the width, so the length is \( 2w \) meters.
   - The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula: 
     \[
     P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width})
     \]
   - We know the perimeter is 300 meters.

2. **Set Up the Equation:**
   - Substitute the known values into the perimeter formula:
     \[
     300 = 2 \times (2w + w)
     \]

3. **Simplify the Equation:**
   - Simplify inside the parentheses:
     \[
     300 = 2 \times (3w)
     \]
   - Simplify further:
     \[
     300 = 6w
     \]

4. **Solve for \( w \):**
   - Divide both sides of the equation by 6 to solve for \( w \):
     \[
     w = \frac{300}{6} = 50
     \]

5. **Find the Length:**
   - Since the length is twice the width:
     \[
     \text{Length} = 2w = 2 \times 50 = 100
     \]

6. **Verify the Solution:**
   - Check the perimeter with the found dimensions:
     \[
     P = 2 \times (100 + 50) = 2 \times 150 = 300
     \]
   - The calculated perimeter matches the given perimeter, confirming our solution is correct.

7. **State the Final Answer:**
   - The dimensions of the field are 50 meters in width and 100 meters in length.

This step-by-step approach demonstrates how to solve a typical math reasoning problem involving algebra and geometry. If you have a specific problem labeled as "Sample reasoning question 218," please provide the details, and I can work through that specific problem for you.
