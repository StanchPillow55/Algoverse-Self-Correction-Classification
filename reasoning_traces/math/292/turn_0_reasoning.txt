To solve this problem, we need to determine how many scarves May can knit using the yarns she has purchased. We know from the problem statement that May can knit 3 scarves using one yarn. We are also given the number of yarns she bought in different colors: red, blue, and yellow.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Determine the total number of yarns May has:**

   - Red yarns: 2
   - Blue yarns: 6
   - Yellow yarns: 4

   To find the total number of yarns, we add these quantities together:

   \[
   \text{Total yarns} = 2 \, (\text{red}) + 6 \, (\text{blue}) + 4 \, (\text{yellow}) = 12 \, \text{yarns}
   \]

2. **Calculate the total number of scarves May can knit:**

   Since May can knit 3 scarves with each yarn, we multiply the total number of yarns by the number of scarves per yarn:

   \[
   \text{Total scarves} = 12 \, \text{yarns} \times 3 \, \text{scarves per yarn} = 36 \, \text{scarves}
   \]

Therefore, May will be able to make a total of 36 scarves using the yarns she bought.

**Final Answer: 36 scarves**
