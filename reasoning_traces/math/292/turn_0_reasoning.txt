To determine how many scarves May can knit in total, we first need to calculate how many scarves she can make with each color of yarn she has purchased.

1. **Identify the number of scarves per yarn**: 
   May can knit 3 scarves using one yarn.

2. **Determine the total number of yarns for each color**:
   - Red yarns: 2
   - Blue yarns: 6
   - Yellow yarns: 4

3. **Calculate the total number of scarves for each color of yarn**:
   - For red yarns:
     \[
     \text{Scarves from red yarn} = 2 \text{ yarns} \times 3 \text{ scarves/yarn} = 6 \text{ scarves}
     \]
   - For blue yarns:
     \[
     \text{Scarves from blue yarn} = 6 \text{ yarns} \times 3 \text{ scarves/yarn} = 18 \text{ scarves}
     \]
   - For yellow yarns:
     \[
     \text{Scarves from yellow yarn} = 4 \text{ yarns} \times 3 \text{ scarves/yarn} = 12 \text{ scarves}
     \]

4. **Sum the total number of scarves from all colors**:
   \[
   \text{Total scarves} = \text{Scarves from red} + \text{Scarves from blue} + \text{Scarves from yellow}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total scarves} = 6 + 18 + 12 = 36
   \]

Thus, May will be able to make a total of **36 scarves**.

Final answer: **36 scarves**.
