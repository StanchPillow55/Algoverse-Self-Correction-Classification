Question ID: 866
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

Let's define the number of books each person has:

- Let \( A \) be the number of books Anne has.
- Sofie has 25 more books than Anne, so we can express Sofie's books as \( S = A + 25 \).
- Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn, so we can express Fawn's books as \( F = A + 12 \).

According to the problem, the total number of books they have together is 85. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[
S + A + F = 85
\]

Substituting the expressions for \( S \) and \( F \) in terms of \( A \):

\[
(A + 25) + A + (A + 12) = 85
\]

Now, combine like terms:

\[
3A + 37 = 85
\]

Next, we will isolate \( A \) by subtracting 37 from both sides:

\[
3A = 85 - 37
\]
\[
3A = 48
\]

Now, divide both sides by 3 to solve for \( A \):

\[
A = \frac{48}{3} = 16
\]

Now that we have the number of books Anne has, we can find the number of books Fawn has:

\[
F = A + 12 = 16 + 12 = 28
\]

Thus, Fawn has 28 books.

Finally, we can summarize our findings:

- Anne has 16 books.
- Sofie has \( 16 + 25 = 41 \) books.
- Fawn has 28 books.

To verify, we check the total:

\[
S + A + F = 41 + 16 + 28 = 85
\]

The calculations are correct. Therefore, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{28}
\]
