==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to set up equations based on the information given about the number of books each person has.

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( S \) be the number of books Sofie has.
   - Let \( A \) be the number of books Anne has.
   - Let \( F \) be the number of books Fawn has.

2. **Set Up the Equations:**
   - From the problem, we know that together they have 85 books:
     \[
     S + A + F = 85
     \]
   - We also know that Sofie has 25 more books than Anne:
     \[
     S = A + 25
     \]
   - Additionally, Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn:
     \[
     A = F - 12
     \]

3. **Substitute Variables:**
   - We can substitute the expressions for \( S \) and \( A \) into the first equation. First, substitute \( A \) from the third equation into the second equation to express everything in terms of \( F \):
     \[
     A = F - 12
     \]
     \[
     S = (F - 12) + 25 = F + 13
     \]

4. **Substitute into the Total Books Equation:**
   - Now substitute \( S \) and \( A \) into the total books equation:
     \[
     (F + 13) + (F - 12) + F = 85
     \]

5. **Combine Like Terms:**
   - Combine the terms:
     \[
     F + 13 + F - 12 + F = 85
     \]
     \[
     3F + 1 = 85
     \]

6. **Solve for \( F \):**
   - Subtract 1 from both sides:
     \[
     3F = 84
     \]
   - Divide by 3:
     \[
     F = 28
     \]

7. **Final Answer:**
   - Fawn has \( \boxed{28} \) books.

8. **Verification:**
   - Now let's verify our solution by calculating the number of books Sofie and Anne have:
     - If \( F = 28 \), then:
       \[
       A = F - 12 = 28 - 12 = 16
       \]
       \[
       S = A + 25 = 16 + 25 = 41
       \]
   - Now check the total:
     \[
     S + A + F = 41 + 16 + 28 = 85
     \]
   - The total is correct, confirming that our solution is accurate. 

Thus, Fawn has \( \boxed{28} \) books.
