Question ID: 1017
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to determine how many pictures Olivia uploaded in total and how they are distributed among the different types of albums.

1. **Total Pictures**: Olivia uploaded a total of 72 pictures.

2. **Number of Albums**: She organized these pictures into 8 albums.

3. **Pictures per Album**: Since she put the same number of pictures into each album, we can find out how many pictures are in each album by dividing the total number of pictures by the number of albums:
   \[
   \text{Pictures per album} = \frac{\text{Total Pictures}}{\text{Number of Albums}} = \frac{72}{8} = 9
   \]
   So, each album contains 9 pictures.

4. **Types of Albums**: We know that:
   - 3 of the albums are selfies only.
   - 2 of the albums are portraits.

5. **Calculating Selfies**: Since there are 3 albums of selfies and each album contains 9 pictures, the total number of selfies is:
   \[
   \text{Total Selfies} = \text{Number of Selfie Albums} \times \text{Pictures per Album} = 3 \times 9 = 27
   \]

6. **Calculating Portraits**: Similarly, for the 2 portrait albums:
   \[
   \text{Total Portraits} = \text{Number of Portrait Albums} \times \text{Pictures per Album} = 2 \times 9 = 18
   \]

7. **Calculating Remaining Albums**: Since there are 8 albums in total and we have accounted for 5 (3 selfies + 2 portraits), there are 3 albums left. We need to determine how many pictures are in these remaining albums. Since each of these albums also contains 9 pictures, the total number of pictures in these 3 albums is:
   \[
   \text{Total Pictures in Remaining Albums} = 3 \times 9 = 27
   \]

8. **Final Count**: Now we can summarize:
   - Total Selfies: 27
   - Total Portraits: 18
   - Pictures in Remaining Albums: 27

9. **Verification**: To ensure our calculations are correct, we can add all the pictures together:
   \[
   \text{Total Pictures} = \text{Total Selfies} + \text{Total Portraits} + \text{Total Pictures in Remaining Albums} = 27 + 18 + 27 = 72
   \]
   This matches the original total of 72 pictures.

Thus, the final answer is:
- Olivia has **27 selfies** and **18 portraits**.
