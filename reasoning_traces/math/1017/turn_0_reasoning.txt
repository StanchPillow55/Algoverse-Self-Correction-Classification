Question ID: 1017
Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to determine how many pictures Olivia uploaded in total, how many pictures she placed in each album, and then how many of those pictures were selfies and how many were portraits.

1. **Total Pictures**: Olivia uploaded a total of 72 pictures.

2. **Number of Albums**: She organized these pictures into 8 albums.

3. **Pictures per Album**: Since she put the same number of pictures into each album, we can find out how many pictures are in each album by dividing the total number of pictures by the number of albums:
   \[
   \text{Pictures per album} = \frac{\text{Total pictures}}{\text{Number of albums}} = \frac{72}{8} = 9
   \]
   So, each album contains 9 pictures.

4. **Types of Albums**: According to the problem, 3 of the albums are selfies only, and 2 of the albums are portraits. This means:
   - Selfies: 3 albums
   - Portraits: 2 albums
   - The remaining albums (8 - 3 - 2 = 3) could be a mix of other types or could also contain selfies or portraits.

5. **Calculating Selfies and Portraits**:
   - Since each album contains 9 pictures, we can calculate the total number of selfies and portraits:
   - Total selfies in 3 albums:
     \[
     \text{Total selfies} = 3 \text{ albums} \times 9 \text{ pictures/album} = 27 \text{ selfies}
     \]
   - Total portraits in 2 albums:
     \[
     \text{Total portraits} = 2 \text{ albums} \times 9 \text{ pictures/album} = 18 \text{ portraits}
     \]

6. **Remaining Albums**: We have 3 remaining albums. Since we already accounted for 27 selfies and 18 portraits, we can calculate the total number of pictures accounted for so far:
   \[
   \text{Total accounted for} = 27 \text{ selfies} + 18 \text{ portraits} = 45 \text{ pictures}
   \]
   This means there are:
   \[
   \text{Remaining pictures} = 72 - 45 = 27 \text{ pictures}
   \]
   These remaining pictures could be a mix of selfies, portraits, or other types.

7. **Final Counts**: 
   - Total selfies: 27
   - Total portraits: 18
   - Remaining pictures: 27 (not specified in the problem)

Thus, the final answer is:
- **Total selfies**: 27
- **Total portraits**: 18

Final answer:
- Olivia has **27 selfies** and **18 portraits**.
