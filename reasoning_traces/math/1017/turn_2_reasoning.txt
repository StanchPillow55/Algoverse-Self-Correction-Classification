Question ID: 1017
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we start by determining how many pictures Olivia put in each album.

1. **Total Pictures and Albums**: Olivia uploaded a total of 72 pictures and divided them into 8 albums.

2. **Pictures per Album**: To find out how many pictures are in each album, we divide the total number of pictures by the number of albums:
   \[
   \text{Pictures per album} = \frac{72 \text{ pictures}}{8 \text{ albums}} = 9 \text{ pictures per album}
   \]

3. **Types of Albums**: We know that:
   - 3 albums are selfies only.
   - 2 albums are portraits.
   - The remaining 3 albums must contain other types of pictures (not specified in the problem).

4. **Calculating Selfies and Portraits**:
   - Since each album contains 9 pictures, we can calculate the total number of selfies and portraits:
   - **Total Selfies**: 
     \[
     \text{Total selfies} = 3 \text{ albums} \times 9 \text{ pictures per album} = 27 \text{ selfies}
     \]
   - **Total Portraits**: 
     \[
     \text{Total portraits} = 2 \text{ albums} \times 9 \text{ pictures per album} = 18 \text{ portraits}
     \]

5. **Final Count**: 
   - We have calculated that Olivia has 27 selfies and 18 portraits.

6. **Verification**: 
   - To ensure the calculations are correct, we can add the selfies and portraits together along with the pictures in the remaining albums:
   - Total pictures accounted for:
   \[
   27 \text{ selfies} + 18 \text{ portraits} + (3 \text{ albums} \times 9 \text{ pictures per album}) = 27 + 18 + 27 = 72 \text{ pictures}
   \]
   - This confirms that our calculations are consistent with the total number of pictures.

**Final Answer**: Olivia has 27 selfies and 18 portraits.
