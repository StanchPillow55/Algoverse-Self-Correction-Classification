Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we first need to understand what "Sample math problem 229" refers to. Since the problem is not explicitly stated, I'll assume a generic math problem and solve it step by step. Let's assume the problem is as follows:

**Problem:**  
Solve for \( x \) in the equation:  
\[ 3x + 5 = 20 \]

**Step 1: Isolate the variable term.**  
To solve for \( x \), we need to isolate the term that contains \( x \) on one side of the equation. We start by eliminating the constant term on the left side of the equation.

Subtract 5 from both sides:  
\[ 3x + 5 - 5 = 20 - 5 \]  
\[ 3x = 15 \]

**Step 2: Solve for the variable.**  
Now that we have isolated the term with \( x \), we need to solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides by the coefficient of \( x \).

Divide both sides by 3:  
\[ \frac{3x}{3} = \frac{15}{3} \]  
\[ x = 5 \]

**Step 3: Verify the solution.**  
To ensure our solution is correct, we substitute \( x = 5 \) back into the original equation and check if both sides are equal.

Substitute \( x = 5 \) into the original equation:  
\[ 3(5) + 5 = 20 \]  
\[ 15 + 5 = 20 \]  
\[ 20 = 20 \]

Since both sides of the equation are equal, our solution is verified.

**Final Answer:**  
The solution to the equation \( 3x + 5 = 20 \) is \( x = 5 \).
