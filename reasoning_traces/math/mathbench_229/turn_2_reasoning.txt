==================================================

To solve the problem effectively, I need to know the specific details of "Sample math problem 229." Since the problem isn't provided, I'll demonstrate how to approach a generic math problem by outlining a step-by-step method. If you have a specific problem in mind, please provide the details, and I'll be happy to solve it for you.

Let's assume a sample math problem for demonstration purposes:

**Problem:** Solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We are given a linear equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).
   - Our goal is to solve for the variable \( x \).

2. **Isolate the Variable:**
   - To solve for \( x \), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation.

3. **Subtract 3 from Both Sides:**
   - Start by eliminating the constant term on the left side.
   - Subtract 3 from both sides of the equation:
     \[
     2x + 3 - 3 = 11 - 3
     \]
   - Simplify:
     \[
     2x = 8
     \]

4. **Divide by the Coefficient of \( x \):**
   - The coefficient of \( x \) is 2. Divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( x \):
     \[
     \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{8}{2}
     \]
   - Simplify:
     \[
     x = 4
     \]

5. **Verify the Solution:**
   - Substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies the equation:
     \[
     2(4) + 3 = 11
     \]
   - Simplify:
     \[
     8 + 3 = 11
     \]
   - Since both sides of the equation are equal, \( x = 4 \) is indeed the correct solution.

### Final Answer:
The solution to the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \) is \( x = 4 \).
