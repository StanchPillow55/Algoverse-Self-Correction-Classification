==================================================

To determine how much money Milly will lose, we need to calculate the total shipping cost and the refund she will receive from Amazon. Then, we can find the difference between what she spent on the book and what she gets back after shipping costs.

### Step 1: Calculate the shipping cost

The shipping cost consists of two components:
1. Cost per pound
2. Cost per mile

**Cost per pound:**
- The book weighs 4 pounds.
- The shipping company charges $0.35 per pound.

\[
\text{Cost per pound} = 4 \text{ pounds} \times 0.35 \text{ dollars/pound} = 1.40 \text{ dollars}
\]

**Cost per mile:**
- The distribution center is 20 miles away.
- The shipping company charges $0.08 per mile.

\[
\text{Cost per mile} = 20 \text{ miles} \times 0.08 \text{ dollars/mile} = 1.60 \text{ dollars}
\]

**Total shipping cost:**
Now, we add the cost per pound and the cost per mile to get the total shipping cost.

\[
\text{Total shipping cost} = \text{Cost per pound} + \text{Cost per mile} = 1.40 \text{ dollars} + 1.60 \text{ dollars} = 3.00 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the refund from Amazon

Milly paid $32 for the book, but Amazon will only refund 75% of the purchase price.

\[
\text{Refund} = 32 \text{ dollars} \times 0.75 = 24 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate Milly's total loss

To find out how much money Milly will lose, we need to subtract the refund she receives from the total amount she spent, which includes the cost of the book and the shipping cost.

**Total amount spent:**
\[
\text{Total amount spent} = \text{Cost of the book} + \text{Total shipping cost} = 32 \text{ dollars} + 3.00 \text{ dollars} = 35.00 \text{ dollars}
\]

**Total loss:**
\[
\text{Total loss} = \text{Total amount spent} - \text{Refund} = 35.00 \text{ dollars} - 24.00 \text{ dollars} = 11.00 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Final Answer
Milly will lose **$11.00**.
