To solve the problem, we need to determine how many students in Miss Albert's class are not on varsity. We will follow these steps:

1. **Identify the total number of students in the class.**
   - There are 12 boys and 12 girls.
   - Total students = Number of boys + Number of girls = 12 + 12 = 24 students.

2. **Calculate the number of girls on varsity.**
   - One-third of the girls are on varsity.
   - Number of girls on varsity = (1/3) * Number of girls = (1/3) * 12 = 4 girls.

3. **Calculate the number of boys on varsity.**
   - One-fourth of the boys are on varsity.
   - Number of boys on varsity = (1/4) * Number of boys = (1/4) * 12 = 3 boys.

4. **Calculate the total number of students on varsity.**
   - Total students on varsity = Number of girls on varsity + Number of boys on varsity = 4 + 3 = 7 students.

5. **Calculate the number of students not on varsity.**
   - Students not on varsity = Total students - Total students on varsity = 24 - 7 = 17 students.

Now, we can summarize our findings:

- Total students in the class: 24
- Students on varsity: 7
- Students not on varsity: 17

Thus, the final answer is:

**17 students are not on varsity.**
