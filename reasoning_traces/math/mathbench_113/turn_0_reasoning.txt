==================================================

To solve the problem, I need more specific information about "Sample math problem 113." Since I don't have access to external databases or specific problem sets, I'll demonstrate how to solve a generic math problem. If you provide more details or context about the specific problem, I can tailor the solution accordingly.

Let's assume "Sample math problem 113" involves solving a quadratic equation. Here's how you might approach solving a quadratic equation step by step:

### Problem:
Solve the quadratic equation: \( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \).

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Identify the coefficients**: 
   - The standard form of a quadratic equation is \( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \).
   - Identify \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \) from the equation.

2. **Calculate the discriminant**:
   - The discriminant \( D \) is given by the formula \( D = b^2 - 4ac \).
   - The discriminant helps determine the nature of the roots:
     - If \( D > 0 \), the equation has two distinct real roots.
     - If \( D = 0 \), the equation has exactly one real root (a repeated root).
     - If \( D < 0 \), the equation has two complex roots.

3. **Solve for the roots using the quadratic formula**:
   - The quadratic formula is \( x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{D}}{2a} \).
   - Substitute the values of \( a \), \( b \), and \( D \) into the formula to find the roots.

### Example:

Let's solve the quadratic equation \( 2x^2 - 4x - 6 = 0 \).

1. **Identify the coefficients**:
   - \( a = 2 \), \( b = -4 \), \( c = -6 \).

2. **Calculate the discriminant**:
   \[
   D = (-4)^2 - 4 \times 2 \times (-6) = 16 + 48 = 64
   \]

3. **Solve for the roots using the quadratic formula**:
   \[
   x = \frac{-(-4) \pm \sqrt{64}}{2 \times 2} = \frac{4 \pm 8}{4}
   \]

   - Calculate the two possible values for \( x \):
     - \( x_1 = \frac{4 + 8}{4} = \frac{12}{4} = 3 \)
     - \( x_2 = \frac{4 - 8}{4} = \frac{-4}{4} = -1 \)

### Final Answer:
The solutions to the quadratic equation \( 2x^2 - 4x - 6 = 0 \) are \( x = 3 \) and \( x = -1 \).
