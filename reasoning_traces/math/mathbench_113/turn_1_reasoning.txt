==================================================

To solve the problem, we first need to understand what "Sample math problem 113" refers to. Since no specific details about the problem are provided, I'll create a hypothetical math problem and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem 113:**

Calculate the area of a triangle with vertices at points A(1, 2), B(4, 6), and C(6, 2).

**Step-by-step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   We need to find the area of a triangle given its vertices in a coordinate plane.

2. **Formula for the Area of a Triangle:**
   The area \( A \) of a triangle with vertices at \((x_1, y_1)\), \((x_2, y_2)\), and \((x_3, y_3)\) can be calculated using the formula:
   \[
   A = \frac{1}{2} \left| x_1(y_2-y_3) + x_2(y_3-y_1) + x_3(y_1-y_2) \right|
   \]

3. **Substitute the Coordinates:**
   For vertices A(1, 2), B(4, 6), and C(6, 2), substitute into the formula:
   \[
   A = \frac{1}{2} \left| 1(6-2) + 4(2-2) + 6(2-6) \right|
   \]

4. **Calculate Each Term:**
   - \( 1(6-2) = 1 \times 4 = 4 \)
   - \( 4(2-2) = 4 \times 0 = 0 \)
   - \( 6(2-6) = 6 \times (-4) = -24 \)

5. **Sum the Terms:**
   \[
   A = \frac{1}{2} \left| 4 + 0 - 24 \right| = \frac{1}{2} \left| -20 \right|
   \]

6. **Calculate the Absolute Value:**
   \[
   \left| -20 \right| = 20
   \]

7. **Calculate the Area:**
   \[
   A = \frac{1}{2} \times 20 = 10
   \]

8. **Conclusion:**
   The area of the triangle with vertices at A(1, 2), B(4, 6), and C(6, 2) is 10 square units.

**Final Answer:**
The area of the triangle is 10 square units.
