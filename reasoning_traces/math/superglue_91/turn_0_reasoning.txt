==================================================

To solve this problem, I need more information about "Sample reasoning question 91" as it is not provided in the prompt. However, I can guide you through a general approach to solving math problems by breaking down the steps involved in reasoning through a typical math question.

### General Approach to Solving Math Problems

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - Carefully read the problem statement.
   - Identify what is being asked.
   - Determine what information is given and what needs to be found.

2. **Devise a Plan:**
   - Consider possible strategies to solve the problem, such as:
     - Drawing a diagram
     - Creating an equation
     - Using logical reasoning
     - Breaking the problem into smaller parts

3. **Carry Out the Plan:**
   - Execute the chosen strategy step by step.
   - Perform calculations carefully.
   - Keep track of units and ensure consistency.

4. **Review/Check the Solution:**
   - Verify each step of the calculation.
   - Check if the solution makes sense in the context of the problem.
   - Ensure that the final answer addresses the question asked.

5. **State the Final Answer:**
   - Clearly present the final answer, including units if applicable.

### Example Problem

Let's apply this approach to a sample math problem:

**Problem:**
A rectangle has a length that is twice its width. If the perimeter of the rectangle is 36 units, find the dimensions of the rectangle.

**Step 1: Understand the Problem**
- We need to find the length and width of the rectangle.
- Given: Length \( L = 2W \) (where \( W \) is the width), and the perimeter \( P = 36 \).

**Step 2: Devise a Plan**
- Use the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle: \( P = 2L + 2W \).

**Step 3: Carry Out the Plan**
1. Substitute the given relationship \( L = 2W \) into the perimeter formula:
   \[
   36 = 2(2W) + 2W
   \]
2. Simplify the equation:
   \[
   36 = 4W + 2W
   \]
   \[
   36 = 6W
   \]
3. Solve for \( W \):
   \[
   W = \frac{36}{6} = 6
   \]
4. Find \( L \) using \( L = 2W \):
   \[
   L = 2 \times 6 = 12
   \]

**Step 4: Review/Check the Solution**
- Check the perimeter with the found dimensions:
  \[
  P = 2L + 2W = 2(12) + 2(6) = 24 + 12 = 36
  \]
- The calculations are correct.

**Step 5: State the Final Answer**
- The dimensions of the rectangle are: Length = 12 units, Width = 6 units.
