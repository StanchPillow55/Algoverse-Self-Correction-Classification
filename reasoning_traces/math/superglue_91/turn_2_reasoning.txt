==================================================

To solve the problem effectively, I need to understand the specific details of "Sample reasoning question 91." However, since the problem details are not provided, I'll demonstrate a general approach to solving a reasoning-based math problem. 

Let's assume a hypothetical problem for illustration:

**Problem:**
A train travels from City A to City B at a speed of 60 km/h and returns from City B to City A at a speed of 40 km/h. What is the average speed of the train for the entire journey?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - The train travels two legs of a journey: from City A to City B and back from City B to City A.
   - The speeds for the two legs are different: 60 km/h and 40 km/h.

2. **Identify What is Being Asked:**
   - We need to find the average speed for the entire journey.

3. **Recall the Formula for Average Speed:**
   - Average speed is defined as the total distance traveled divided by the total time taken.

4. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( d \) be the distance between City A and City B.

5. **Calculate the Time for Each Leg of the Journey:**
   - Time from City A to City B: \( t_1 = \frac{d}{60} \) hours.
   - Time from City B to City A: \( t_2 = \frac{d}{40} \) hours.

6. **Calculate the Total Distance:**
   - Total distance = \( d + d = 2d \).

7. **Calculate the Total Time:**
   - Total time = \( t_1 + t_2 = \frac{d}{60} + \frac{d}{40} \).

8. **Find a Common Denominator to Add the Times:**
   - The common denominator of 60 and 40 is 120.
   - Convert the times: 
     \[
     \frac{d}{60} = \frac{2d}{120}, \quad \frac{d}{40} = \frac{3d}{120}
     \]
   - Total time = \( \frac{2d}{120} + \frac{3d}{120} = \frac{5d}{120} = \frac{d}{24} \).

9. **Calculate the Average Speed:**
   - Average speed = \(\frac{\text{Total distance}}{\text{Total time}} = \frac{2d}{\frac{d}{24}} = 2d \times \frac{24}{d} = 48 \) km/h.

10. **State the Final Answer:**
    - The average speed of the train for the entire journey is 48 km/h.

This structured approach ensures that all aspects of the problem are considered and solved systematically. If you have a specific problem or need further assistance, please provide more details.
