==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 91" entails. Since the problem statement doesn't provide specific details about the question, I'll assume it's a generic math problem that requires logical reasoning and step-by-step calculations. Let's create a hypothetical math problem and solve it.

**Hypothetical Problem:**

A company produces two types of widgets: Type A and Type B. The company sells Type A widgets for $50 each and Type B widgets for $70 each. Last month, the company sold a total of 500 widgets and earned $28,000 in revenue. How many of each type of widget did the company sell?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( x \) be the number of Type A widgets sold.
   - Let \( y \) be the number of Type B widgets sold.

2. **Set Up Equations:**
   - The total number of widgets sold is 500:
     \[
     x + y = 500
     \]
   - The total revenue from selling the widgets is $28,000:
     \[
     50x + 70y = 28,000
     \]

3. **Solve the System of Equations:**

   We have the following system of equations:
   \[
   \begin{align*}
   x + y &= 500 \quad \text{(Equation 1)} \\
   50x + 70y &= 28,000 \quad \text{(Equation 2)}
   \end{align*}
   \]

   **Substitution Method:**

   - Solve Equation 1 for \( y \):
     \[
     y = 500 - x
     \]

   - Substitute \( y = 500 - x \) into Equation 2:
     \[
     50x + 70(500 - x) = 28,000
     \]

   - Simplify and solve for \( x \):
     \[
     50x + 35,000 - 70x = 28,000
     \]
     \[
     -20x + 35,000 = 28,000
     \]
     \[
     -20x = 28,000 - 35,000
     \]
     \[
     -20x = -7,000
     \]
     \[
     x = \frac{-7,000}{-20}
     \]
     \[
     x = 350
     \]

   - Substitute \( x = 350 \) back into Equation 1 to find \( y \):
     \[
     350 + y = 500
     \]
     \[
     y = 500 - 350
     \]
     \[
     y = 150
     \]

4. **Verify the Solution:**

   - Check the total number of widgets:
     \[
     x + y = 350 + 150 = 500
     \]
   - Check the total revenue:
     \[
     50(350) + 70(150) = 17,500 + 10,500 = 28,000
     \]

Both conditions are satisfied, confirming the solution is correct.

**Final Answer:**

The company sold 350 Type A widgets and 150 Type B widgets.
