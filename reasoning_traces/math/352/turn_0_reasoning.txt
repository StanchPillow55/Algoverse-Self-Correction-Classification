==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to determine how much money Andrea saved before spending some of it on a sweater and giving some to her brother.

1. **Identify the total amount Andrea had initially**: 
   - Andrea started with $36.

2. **Identify the expenses**:
   - She bought a sweater for $11.
   - She gave her brother $4.

3. **Calculate the total amount spent**:
   - Total spent = Cost of sweater + Amount given to brother
   - Total spent = $11 + $4 = $15

4. **Calculate the remaining amount after spending**:
   - Remaining amount = Initial amount - Total spent
   - Remaining amount = $36 - $15 = $21

5. **Determine how much Andrea saved**:
   - Since we know the remaining amount after her expenses is $21, we can conclude that this is the amount she had after saving some money. 
   - To find out how much she saved, we need to consider that the remaining amount ($21) is what she had left after spending the money she saved.

6. **Calculate the amount saved**:
   - Let \( S \) be the amount Andrea saved. 
   - The equation can be set up as follows:
     \[
     S + 15 = 36
     \]
   - Rearranging gives:
     \[
     S = 36 - 15
     \]
   - Therefore:
     \[
     S = 21
     \]

Thus, Andrea saved **$21**.

**Final Answer**: Andrea saved $21.
