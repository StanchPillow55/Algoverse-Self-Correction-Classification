To solve this problem, we need to determine how many pages Punger needs to buy to store all of his baseball cards. Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Calculate the Total Number of Cards:**
   - Punger buys 60 packs of baseball cards.
   - Each pack contains 7 cards.
   - To find the total number of cards, multiply the number of packs by the number of cards per pack:
     \[
     \text{Total number of cards} = 60 \text{ packs} \times 7 \text{ cards per pack} = 420 \text{ cards}
     \]

2. **Determine How Many Pages Are Needed:**
   - Each page can hold 10 cards.
   - To find out how many pages are needed, divide the total number of cards by the number of cards each page can hold:
     \[
     \text{Number of pages needed} = \frac{420 \text{ cards}}{10 \text{ cards per page}} = 42 \text{ pages}
     \]

Since the division results in a whole number, Punger needs exactly 42 pages to store all of his baseball cards.

**Final Answer:**
Punger needs to buy 42 pages to store all of his baseball cards.
