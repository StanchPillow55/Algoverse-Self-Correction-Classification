To determine how many pages Punger needs to buy to store his baseball cards, we will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of baseball cards Punger has.**
   - Punger buys 60 packs of baseball cards.
   - Each pack contains 7 cards.
   - Therefore, the total number of cards can be calculated by multiplying the number of packs by the number of cards per pack:

   \[
   \text{Total cards} = \text{Number of packs} \times \text{Cards per pack} = 60 \times 7
   \]

   Now, let's perform the multiplication:

   \[
   60 \times 7 = 420
   \]

   So, Punger has a total of 420 baseball cards.

2. **Determine how many pages are needed to store these cards.**
   - Each page can hold 10 cards.
   - To find out how many pages are needed, we divide the total number of cards by the number of cards each page can hold:

   \[
   \text{Number of pages needed} = \frac{\text{Total cards}}{\text{Cards per page}} = \frac{420}{10}
   \]

   Performing the division:

   \[
   \frac{420}{10} = 42
   \]

   Therefore, Punger needs 42 pages to store all of his baseball cards.

3. **Final Answer:**
   - Punger needs to buy **42 pages** to store his 420 baseball cards.
