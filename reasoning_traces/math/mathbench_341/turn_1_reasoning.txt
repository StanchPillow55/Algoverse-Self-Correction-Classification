==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample math problem 341" refers to. Since the problem itself is not provided, I'll create a hypothetical math problem with the number 341 and solve it step by step.

Let's assume the problem is as follows:

**Problem:**  
Find the prime factorization of the number 341.

**Step-by-step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   We need to express the number 341 as a product of prime numbers.

2. **Check if 341 is a Prime Number:**
   A prime number is a number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. To determine if 341 is prime, we need to check if it is divisible by any prime numbers up to the square root of 341.

3. **Calculate the Square Root of 341:**
   \[
   \sqrt{341} \approx 18.47
   \]
   We need to check divisibility by prime numbers less than or equal to 18.

4. **Check Divisibility:**
   - **Divisibility by 2:** 341 is odd, so it is not divisible by 2.
   - **Divisibility by 3:** Sum of digits of 341 is \(3 + 4 + 1 = 8\). Since 8 is not divisible by 3, 341 is not divisible by 3.
   - **Divisibility by 5:** 341 does not end in 0 or 5, so it is not divisible by 5.
   - **Divisibility by 7:** Perform division: \(341 \div 7 \approx 48.71\). Since this is not an integer, 341 is not divisible by 7.
   - **Divisibility by 11:** Alternate sum of digits: \(3 - 4 + 1 = 0\). Since 0 is divisible by 11, 341 is divisible by 11.

5. **Divide 341 by 11:**
   \[
   341 \div 11 = 31
   \]

6. **Check if 31 is Prime:**
   31 is a prime number because it is not divisible by any prime numbers less than its square root (\(\sqrt{31} \approx 5.57\)), which are 2, 3, and 5.

7. **Conclusion:**
   The prime factorization of 341 is \(11 \times 31\).

**Final Answer:**
The prime factorization of 341 is \(11 \times 31\).
