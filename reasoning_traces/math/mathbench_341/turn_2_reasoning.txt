==================================================

Certainly! Let's tackle the problem step by step. However, it seems like "Sample math problem 341" is not a standard math problem statement. To proceed, I'll need to make some assumptions or create a hypothetical math problem based on typical math problem types. Let's assume "Sample math problem 341" is a placeholder for a specific problem. I'll create a hypothetical problem and solve it.

**Hypothetical Problem:**

Let's assume the problem is about solving a quadratic equation:

"Find the roots of the quadratic equation \(2x^2 - 4x - 6 = 0\)."

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Identify the coefficients:**

   The given quadratic equation is \(2x^2 - 4x - 6 = 0\).

   Here, the coefficients are:
   - \(a = 2\)
   - \(b = -4\)
   - \(c = -6\)

2. **Use the quadratic formula:**

   The quadratic formula to find the roots of \(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\) is:

   \[
   x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
   \]

3. **Calculate the discriminant:**

   The discriminant \(\Delta\) is given by \(b^2 - 4ac\).

   \[
   \Delta = (-4)^2 - 4 \times 2 \times (-6) = 16 + 48 = 64
   \]

4. **Determine the roots:**

   Since the discriminant is positive (\(\Delta = 64\)), there are two distinct real roots.

   Substitute the values into the quadratic formula:

   \[
   x = \frac{-(-4) \pm \sqrt{64}}{2 \times 2}
   \]

   \[
   x = \frac{4 \pm 8}{4}
   \]

   Calculate the two possible values for \(x\):

   - For \(x_1\):

     \[
     x_1 = \frac{4 + 8}{4} = \frac{12}{4} = 3
     \]

   - For \(x_2\):

     \[
     x_2 = \frac{4 - 8}{4} = \frac{-4}{4} = -1
     \]

5. **Conclusion:**

   The roots of the quadratic equation \(2x^2 - 4x - 6 = 0\) are \(x = 3\) and \(x = -1\).

**Final Answer:**

The roots of the equation are \(x = 3\) and \(x = -1\).
