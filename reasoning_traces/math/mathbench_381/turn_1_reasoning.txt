==================================================

To solve the problem, we first need to understand what "Sample math problem 381" refers to. Since the problem itself isn't specified, I'll assume it's a generic math problem that requires a step-by-step solution. Let's create a hypothetical problem and solve it.

**Hypothetical Problem 381:**

Calculate the value of \( x \) in the equation:

\[ 3x + 5 = 20 \]

**Step-by-step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Equation:**
   The equation given is a simple linear equation in one variable, \( x \). The goal is to isolate \( x \) on one side of the equation to find its value.

2. **Isolate the Variable:**
   To isolate \( x \), we need to perform operations that will get \( x \) by itself on one side of the equation.

3. **Subtract 5 from Both Sides:**
   Start by eliminating the constant term on the left side of the equation. Subtract 5 from both sides:

   \[
   3x + 5 - 5 = 20 - 5
   \]

   Simplifying both sides gives:

   \[
   3x = 15
   \]

4. **Divide by 3:**
   Now, divide both sides by 3 to solve for \( x \):

   \[
   \frac{3x}{3} = \frac{15}{3}
   \]

   Simplifying both sides gives:

   \[
   x = 5
   \]

5. **Verify the Solution:**
   Substitute \( x = 5 \) back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies the equation:

   \[
   3(5) + 5 = 20
   \]

   Simplifying the left side:

   \[
   15 + 5 = 20
   \]

   Since both sides of the equation are equal, the solution \( x = 5 \) is verified.

**Final Answer:**

The value of \( x \) is \( 5 \).
