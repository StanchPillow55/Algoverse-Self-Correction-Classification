Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, I need to first understand what "Sample math problem 381" refers to. Since I don't have access to external databases or specific problem sets, I'll assume this is a placeholder for a typical math problem. Without specific details, I'll create a sample math problem and solve it step by step.

**Sample Math Problem 381:**

**Problem:**  
Solve for \( x \) in the equation:  
\[ 3x + 5 = 20 \]

**Step-by-step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Equation:**
   The equation given is a linear equation in one variable, \( x \). The goal is to isolate \( x \) on one side of the equation.

2. **Subtract 5 from Both Sides:**
   To begin isolating \( x \), subtract 5 from both sides of the equation to eliminate the constant term on the left side.
   \[
   3x + 5 - 5 = 20 - 5
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   3x = 15
   \]

3. **Divide Both Sides by 3:**
   Now, divide both sides of the equation by 3 to solve for \( x \).
   \[
   \frac{3x}{3} = \frac{15}{3}
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   x = 5
   \]

4. **Verify the Solution:**
   Substitute \( x = 5 \) back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies the equation.
   \[
   3(5) + 5 = 20
   \]
   Simplifying the left side:
   \[
   15 + 5 = 20
   \]
   \[
   20 = 20
   \]
   Since both sides of the equation are equal, the solution \( x = 5 \) is verified.

**Final Answer:**
\[ x = 5 \]

This completes the solution to the sample math problem. If "Sample math problem 381" refers to a specific problem, please provide the details of the problem for an accurate solution.
