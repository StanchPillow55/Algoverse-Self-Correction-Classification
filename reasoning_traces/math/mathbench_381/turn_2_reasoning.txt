Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we first need to understand what "Sample math problem 381" refers to. Since the problem is not explicitly stated, I'll assume it's a placeholder for a typical math problem. Let's create a hypothetical math problem and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**

Solve for \( x \) in the equation:

\[ 3x + 5 = 20 \]

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Equation:**
   The equation \( 3x + 5 = 20 \) is a linear equation in one variable, \( x \). Our goal is to isolate \( x \) on one side of the equation.

2. **Subtract 5 from Both Sides:**
   To begin isolating \( x \), we first eliminate the constant term on the left side by subtracting 5 from both sides of the equation:

   \[
   3x + 5 - 5 = 20 - 5
   \]

   Simplifying both sides gives:

   \[
   3x = 15
   \]

3. **Divide Both Sides by 3:**
   Next, we need to solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides of the equation by 3:

   \[
   \frac{3x}{3} = \frac{15}{3}
   \]

   Simplifying both sides results in:

   \[
   x = 5
   \]

4. **Verify the Solution:**
   To ensure our solution is correct, we substitute \( x = 5 \) back into the original equation:

   \[
   3(5) + 5 = 20
   \]

   Simplifying the left side:

   \[
   15 + 5 = 20
   \]

   \[
   20 = 20
   \]

   Since both sides of the equation are equal, our solution \( x = 5 \) is verified.

**Final Answer:**

The solution to the equation \( 3x + 5 = 20 \) is \( x = 5 \).
