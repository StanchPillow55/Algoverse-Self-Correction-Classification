Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step.

1. **Identify the number of snowflake stamps**:
   Bella bought 11 snowflake stamps. We can denote this as:
   \[
   \text{Snowflake stamps} = 11
   \]

2. **Determine the number of truck stamps**:
   Bella bought 9 more truck stamps than snowflake stamps. Therefore, we can calculate the number of truck stamps as follows:
   \[
   \text{Truck stamps} = \text{Snowflake stamps} + 9 = 11 + 9 = 20
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of rose stamps**:
   Bella bought 13 fewer rose stamps than truck stamps. Thus, we can find the number of rose stamps using the number of truck stamps:
   \[
   \text{Rose stamps} = \text{Truck stamps} - 13 = 20 - 13 = 7
   \]

4. **Calculate the total number of stamps**:
   Now we can find the total number of stamps Bella bought by adding the number of snowflake, truck, and rose stamps together:
   \[
   \text{Total stamps} = \text{Snowflake stamps} + \text{Truck stamps} + \text{Rose stamps}
   \]
   Substituting the values we found:
   \[
   \text{Total stamps} = 11 + 20 + 7
   \]
   Performing the addition:
   \[
   \text{Total stamps} = 38
   \]

Therefore, the total number of stamps Bella bought is \(\boxed{38}\).
