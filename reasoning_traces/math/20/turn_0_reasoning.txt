Question ID: 20
Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

Bella bought 11 snowflake stamps.

She bought 9 more truck stamps than snowflake stamps, so she bought 11 + 9 = <<11+9=20>>20 truck stamps.

She bought 13 fewer rose stamps than truck stamps, so she bought 20 - 13 = <<20-13=7>>7 rose stamps.

In total, Bella bought 11 snowflake stamps + 20 truck stamps + 7 rose stamps = <<11+20+7=38>>38 stamps.

So, Bella bought 38 stamps in all.
