==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to determine how many marbles Mazie gave to Darla after giving a total of 52 marbles to both twins, Dallas and Darla.

1. **Understanding the problem**: 
   - Mazie has a total of 52 marbles.
   - After giving some to Dallas, he ends up with 21 marbles, but this includes the fact that he dropped 4 marbles in the playground.

2. **Calculating how many marbles Dallas originally had**:
   - Since Dallas has 21 marbles after dropping 4, we can find out how many he had before dropping them.
   - To find the original number of marbles Dallas had, we add the 4 marbles he dropped back to the 21 marbles he currently has:
     \[
     \text{Original marbles Dallas had} = 21 + 4 = 25
     \]

3. **Finding out how many marbles Darla received**:
   - Since Mazie gave a total of 52 marbles to both twins, we can find out how many marbles Darla received by subtracting the number of marbles Dallas received from the total number of marbles:
     \[
     \text{Marbles given to Darla} = \text{Total marbles} - \text{Marbles given to Dallas}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Marbles given to Darla} = 52 - 25 = 27
     \]

4. **Final answer**:
   - Therefore, the number of marbles Mazie gave to Darla is \( \boxed{27} \).
