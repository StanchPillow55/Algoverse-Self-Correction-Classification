==================================================

To solve the problem effectively, I need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 301" entails. Since the problem statement is not explicitly provided, I will assume a generic approach to solving a typical math problem. I will demonstrate a step-by-step reasoning process using a hypothetical math problem. Let's assume the problem is as follows:

**Problem:**
A store sells apples at $2 each and oranges at $3 each. If a customer buys a total of 10 fruits consisting of apples and oranges and spends $25, how many apples and how many oranges did the customer buy?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( x \) be the number of apples.
   - Let \( y \) be the number of oranges.

2. **Set Up Equations:**
   - The total number of fruits is 10: 
     \[
     x + y = 10
     \]
   - The total cost of the fruits is $25:
     \[
     2x + 3y = 25
     \]

3. **Solve the System of Equations:**
   - We have the system:
     \[
     \begin{align*}
     x + y &= 10 \quad \text{(Equation 1)} \\
     2x + 3y &= 25 \quad \text{(Equation 2)}
     \end{align*}
     \]

4. **Substitute to Solve:**
   - From Equation 1, express \( y \) in terms of \( x \):
     \[
     y = 10 - x
     \]
   - Substitute \( y = 10 - x \) into Equation 2:
     \[
     2x + 3(10 - x) = 25
     \]
   - Simplify and solve for \( x \):
     \[
     2x + 30 - 3x = 25
     \]
     \[
     -x + 30 = 25
     \]
     \[
     -x = 25 - 30
     \]
     \[
     -x = -5
     \]
     \[
     x = 5
     \]

5. **Find \( y \):**
   - Substitute \( x = 5 \) back into the expression for \( y \):
     \[
     y = 10 - x = 10 - 5 = 5
     \]

6. **Verify the Solution:**
   - Check the total number of fruits:
     \[
     x + y = 5 + 5 = 10 \quad \text{(Correct)}
     \]
   - Check the total cost:
     \[
     2x + 3y = 2(5) + 3(5) = 10 + 15 = 25 \quad \text{(Correct)}
     \]

**Final Answer:**
The customer bought 5 apples and 5 oranges.
