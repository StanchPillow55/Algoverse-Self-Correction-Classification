Question ID: superglue_301
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 301" entails. Since the problem does not provide specific details, we will assume it is a hypothetical math problem that requires a structured approach to solve.

Let's assume "Sample reasoning question 301" involves solving a mathematical equation or problem. Hereâ€™s how we can approach it step by step:

### Step 1: Understand the Problem
Without specific details, we will create a hypothetical problem. Let's assume the problem is to solve the following equation for \( x \):

\[ 2x + 3 = 11 \]

### Step 2: Isolate the Variable
To solve for \( x \), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We can do this by performing inverse operations.

1. **Subtract 3 from both sides**: This will help us eliminate the constant term on the left side of the equation.

   \[
   2x + 3 - 3 = 11 - 3
   \]

   Simplifying both sides gives:

   \[
   2x = 8
   \]

2. **Divide both sides by 2**: This will isolate \( x \).

   \[
   \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{8}{2}
   \]

   Simplifying both sides gives:

   \[
   x = 4
   \]

### Step 3: Verify the Solution
To ensure our solution is correct, we substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation:

\[ 2(4) + 3 = 11 \]

Simplifying the left side:

\[ 8 + 3 = 11 \]

Since both sides of the equation are equal, our solution is verified.

### Step 4: State the Final Answer
The solution to the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \) is:

\[ x = 4 \]

This completes our reasoning and solution process for the hypothetical "Sample reasoning question 301." If the actual problem differs, please provide more details for a specific solution.
