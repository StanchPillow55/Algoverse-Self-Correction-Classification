==================================================

To solve the problem effectively, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 301" entails. However, since the problem statement is not explicitly provided, I will demonstrate a general approach to solving a typical math reasoning problem. Let's assume a hypothetical problem and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**
A train travels from City A to City B, a distance of 300 miles, at a constant speed. On the return trip, the train travels at a speed that is 20 miles per hour faster and takes 1 hour less than the initial trip. What is the speed of the train from City A to City B?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( x \) be the speed of the train from City A to City B in miles per hour.
   - The speed on the return trip is \( x + 20 \) miles per hour.

2. **Set Up Equations:**
   - The time taken to travel from City A to City B is given by the formula:
     \[
     \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{300}{x}
     \]
   - The time taken for the return trip is:
     \[
     \frac{300}{x + 20}
     \]
   - According to the problem, the return trip takes 1 hour less than the initial trip. Therefore, we have the equation:
     \[
     \frac{300}{x} - \frac{300}{x + 20} = 1
     \]

3. **Solve the Equation:**
   - To eliminate the fractions, multiply the entire equation by \( x(x + 20) \):
     \[
     300(x + 20) - 300x = x(x + 20)
     \]
   - Simplify the equation:
     \[
     300x + 6000 - 300x = x^2 + 20x
     \]
     \[
     6000 = x^2 + 20x
     \]
   - Rearrange to form a quadratic equation:
     \[
     x^2 + 20x - 6000 = 0
     \]

4. **Solve the Quadratic Equation:**
   - Use the quadratic formula \( x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \), where \( a = 1 \), \( b = 20 \), and \( c = -6000 \):
     \[
     x = \frac{-20 \pm \sqrt{20^2 - 4 \times 1 \times (-6000)}}{2 \times 1}
     \]
     \[
     x = \frac{-20 \pm \sqrt{400 + 24000}}{2}
     \]
     \[
     x = \frac{-20 \pm \sqrt{24400}}{2}
     \]
     \[
     x = \frac{-20 \pm 156.2}{2}
     \]
   - Calculate the two possible solutions:
     \[
     x = \frac{-20 + 156.2}{2} = \frac{136.2}{2} = 68.1
     \]
     \[
     x = \frac{-20 - 156.2}{2} = \frac{-176.2}{2} = -88.1
     \]
   - Since speed cannot be negative, the speed of the train from City A to City B is 68.1 miles per hour.

**Final Answer:**
The speed of the train from City A to City B is 68.1 miles per hour.
