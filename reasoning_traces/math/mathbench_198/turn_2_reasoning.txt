Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample math problem 198" refers to. Since the problem itself is not provided, I'll assume it's a placeholder for a typical math problem. Let's create a hypothetical problem to solve:

**Hypothetical Problem 198:**

"Calculate the area of a triangle with a base of 10 units and a height of 5 units."

Let's solve this problem step by step:

### Step 1: Understand the Formula for the Area of a Triangle

The area \( A \) of a triangle can be calculated using the formula:

\[
A = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height}
\]

### Step 2: Identify the Given Values

From the problem, we know:
- The base of the triangle is 10 units.
- The height of the triangle is 5 units.

### Step 3: Substitute the Values into the Formula

Substitute the given values for the base and height into the area formula:

\[
A = \frac{1}{2} \times 10 \times 5
\]

### Step 4: Perform the Calculations

First, multiply the base and height:

\[
10 \times 5 = 50
\]

Next, multiply the result by \(\frac{1}{2}\):

\[
A = \frac{1}{2} \times 50 = 25
\]

### Step 5: State the Final Answer

The area of the triangle is 25 square units.

Thus, the final answer is:

**25 square units**
