==================================================

To solve the problem, we first need to understand what "Sample math problem 198" refers to. Since no specific details about the problem are provided, I'll assume it's a placeholder for a generic math problem. Let's create a sample problem and solve it step by step.

**Sample Math Problem 198:**

**Problem:**
A rectangle has a length that is twice its width. The perimeter of the rectangle is 54 units. Find the dimensions of the rectangle.

**Solution:**

Step 1: Define Variables
- Let \( w \) be the width of the rectangle.
- Since the length is twice the width, the length \( l \) is \( 2w \).

Step 2: Write the Perimeter Formula
- The formula for the perimeter \( P \) of a rectangle is given by:
  \[
  P = 2l + 2w
  \]

Step 3: Substitute Known Values
- We know the perimeter is 54 units, so:
  \[
  54 = 2(2w) + 2w
  \]

Step 4: Simplify the Equation
- Simplify the expression:
  \[
  54 = 4w + 2w
  \]
  \[
  54 = 6w
  \]

Step 5: Solve for \( w \)
- Divide both sides by 6 to solve for \( w \):
  \[
  w = \frac{54}{6} = 9
  \]

Step 6: Find the Length
- Since the length \( l \) is twice the width:
  \[
  l = 2w = 2 \times 9 = 18
  \]

Step 7: Verify the Solution
- Check the perimeter with the found dimensions:
  \[
  P = 2l + 2w = 2(18) + 2(9) = 36 + 18 = 54
  \]
- The calculated perimeter matches the given perimeter, confirming our solution is correct.

**Final Answer:**
The dimensions of the rectangle are:
- Width = 9 units
- Length = 18 units
