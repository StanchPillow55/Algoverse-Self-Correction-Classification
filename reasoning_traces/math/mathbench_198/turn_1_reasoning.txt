==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 198," we need to first understand what the problem is asking. However, the problem statement is incomplete as it only says "Sample math problem 198" without providing any specific details or context. 

To proceed, I'll assume that "Sample math problem 198" refers to a specific problem from a textbook or a set of problems, and I'll create a hypothetical math problem to solve. Let's assume the problem is as follows:

**Problem 198:**
Solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 3x + 5 = 20 \).

Let's solve this step-by-step:

1. **Understand the Equation:**
   The equation given is \( 3x + 5 = 20 \). This is a linear equation in one variable, \( x \).

2. **Isolate the Variable:**
   To solve for \( x \), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We can do this by performing operations that will leave \( x \) by itself.

3. **Subtract 5 from Both Sides:**
   To remove the 5 from the left side, subtract 5 from both sides of the equation:
   \[
   3x + 5 - 5 = 20 - 5
   \]
   Simplifying both sides, we get:
   \[
   3x = 15
   \]

4. **Divide by 3:**
   Now, divide both sides by 3 to solve for \( x \):
   \[
   \frac{3x}{3} = \frac{15}{3}
   \]
   Simplifying both sides, we find:
   \[
   x = 5
   \]

5. **Verify the Solution:**
   To ensure our solution is correct, substitute \( x = 5 \) back into the original equation:
   \[
   3(5) + 5 = 20
   \]
   Simplifying the left side, we get:
   \[
   15 + 5 = 20
   \]
   \[
   20 = 20
   \]
   Since both sides of the equation are equal, our solution is verified.

**Final Answer:**
The solution to the equation \( 3x + 5 = 20 \) is \( x = 5 \).
