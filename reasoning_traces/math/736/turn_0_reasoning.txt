==================================================

To solve the problem, we will follow these steps:

1. **Determine how many apples Beck has initially.**
2. **Calculate how many apples Boris has after giving 10 apples to Beck.**
3. **Calculate how many apples Beck has after receiving 10 apples from Boris.**
4. **Find the difference in the number of apples between Boris and Beck after the transaction.**

### Step 1: Determine how many apples Beck has initially.

Boris has 100 apples. According to the problem, Beck has 23 fewer apples than Boris.

\[
\text{Beck's initial apples} = \text{Boris's apples} - 23 = 100 - 23 = 77
\]

So, Beck initially has 77 apples.

### Step 2: Calculate how many apples Boris has after giving 10 apples to Beck.

Boris gives Beck 10 apples. Therefore, we need to subtract 10 from Boris's initial amount.

\[
\text{Boris's apples after giving 10} = 100 - 10 = 90
\]

Now, Boris has 90 apples.

### Step 3: Calculate how many apples Beck has after receiving 10 apples from Boris.

Beck receives 10 apples from Boris. We need to add 10 to Beck's initial amount.

\[
\text{Beck's apples after receiving 10} = 77 + 10 = 87
\]

Now, Beck has 87 apples.

### Step 4: Find the difference in the number of apples between Boris and Beck after the transaction.

Now we need to find out how many fewer apples Beck has than Boris.

\[
\text{Difference} = \text{Boris's apples} - \text{Beck's apples} = 90 - 87 = 3
\]

### Final Answer

Beck has 3 fewer apples than Boris after the transaction. 

Thus, the final answer is:

**3**
