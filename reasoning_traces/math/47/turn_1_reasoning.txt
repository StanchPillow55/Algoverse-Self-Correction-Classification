Question ID: 47
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to calculate how long it takes to download the first 60 megabytes at a rate of 5 megabytes per second. We do this by dividing the size of the file by the download rate:

60 megabytes / 5 megabytes per second = 12 seconds

Next, we need to calculate how much of the file is left to download after the first 60 megabytes. We do this by subtracting 60 from the total size of the file:

90 megabytes - 60 megabytes = 30 megabytes

Then, we calculate how long it takes to download the remaining 30 megabytes at a rate of 10 megabytes per second:

30 megabytes / 10 megabytes per second = 3 seconds

Finally, we add the time it took to download the first 60 megabytes to the time it took to download the remaining 30 megabytes to get the total download time:

12 seconds + 3 seconds = 15 seconds

So, it takes 15 seconds to download the entire 90 megabyte file.
