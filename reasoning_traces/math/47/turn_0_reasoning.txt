Dataset Type: math
==================================================

The file is 90 megabytes in size. The first 60 megabytes download at a rate of 5 megabytes per second, and the remaining 30 megabytes download at a rate of 10 megabytes per second.

First, let's calculate how long it takes to download the first 60 megabytes. 

The time it takes to download something is equal to the size of the file divided by the download rate. So, for the first 60 megabytes, we have:

60 megabytes รท 5 megabytes/second = 12 seconds

Next, let's calculate how long it takes to download the remaining 30 megabytes. 

Again, the time it takes to download something is equal to the size of the file divided by the download rate. So, for the remaining 30 megabytes, we have:

30 megabytes รท 10 megabytes/second = 3 seconds

To find the total time it takes to download the entire file, we add the time it takes to download the first 60 megabytes to the time it takes to download the remaining 30 megabytes:

12 seconds + 3 seconds = 15 seconds

So, it takes 15 seconds to download the entire 90 megabyte file.
