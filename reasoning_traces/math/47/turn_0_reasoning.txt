To determine how long it takes to download a file of 90 megabytes (MB) at varying download speeds, we can break the problem into two parts based on the given download rates.

1. **First 60 MB at 5 MB/s:**
   - The download speed for the first 60 MB is 5 MB per second.
   - We can calculate the time taken to download the first 60 MB using the formula:
     \[
     \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Size}}{\text{Speed}}
     \]
   - Substituting the values:
     \[
     \text{Time for first 60 MB} = \frac{60 \text{ MB}}{5 \text{ MB/s}} = 12 \text{ seconds}
     \]

2. **Remaining 30 MB at 10 MB/s:**
   - After downloading the first 60 MB, there are 30 MB left to download.
   - The download speed for the remaining 30 MB is 10 MB per second.
   - We can calculate the time taken to download the remaining 30 MB using the same formula:
     \[
     \text{Time for remaining 30 MB} = \frac{30 \text{ MB}}{10 \text{ MB/s}} = 3 \text{ seconds}
     \]

3. **Total Download Time:**
   - To find the total download time, we add the time taken for both parts:
     \[
     \text{Total Time} = \text{Time for first 60 MB} + \text{Time for remaining 30 MB}
     \]
   - Substituting the calculated times:
     \[
     \text{Total Time} = 12 \text{ seconds} + 3 \text{ seconds} = 15 \text{ seconds}
     \]

Thus, the total time taken to download the entire 90 MB file is **15 seconds**.

Final answer: **15 seconds**.
