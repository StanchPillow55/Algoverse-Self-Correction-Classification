To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the number of blue ties John bought:**
   - John spent $200 on blue ties, and each blue tie costs $40.
   - To find the number of blue ties, we can use the formula:
     \[
     \text{Number of blue ties} = \frac{\text{Total spent on blue ties}}{\text{Cost per blue tie}} = \frac{200}{40} = 5
     \]
   - So, John bought 5 blue ties.

2. **Determine the number of red ties John bought:**
   - According to the problem, John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties.
   - Therefore, the number of red ties is:
     \[
     \text{Number of red ties} = 2 \times \text{Number of blue ties} = 2 \times 5 = 10
     \]
   - So, John bought 10 red ties.

3. **Determine the cost of the red ties:**
   - The problem states that red ties cost 50% more than blue ties.
   - The cost of a blue tie is $40, so the cost of a red tie can be calculated as follows:
     \[
     \text{Cost of red tie} = \text{Cost of blue tie} + 0.5 \times \text{Cost of blue tie} = 40 + 0.5 \times 40 = 40 + 20 = 60
     \]
   - Therefore, each red tie costs $60.

4. **Calculate the total cost of the red ties:**
   - Now that we know the cost of each red tie, we can find the total cost for the red ties:
     \[
     \text{Total cost of red ties} = \text{Number of red ties} \times \text{Cost of red tie} = 10 \times 60 = 600
     \]

5. **Calculate the total amount John spent on ties:**
   - Finally, we need to add the total cost of blue ties and the total cost of red ties to find out how much John spent in total:
     \[
     \text{Total spent on ties} = \text{Total spent on blue ties} + \text{Total spent on red ties} = 200 + 600 = 800
     \]

Thus, the total amount John spent on ties is \(\boxed{800}\).
