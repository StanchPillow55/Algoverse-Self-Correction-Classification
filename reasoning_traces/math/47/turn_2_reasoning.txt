Question ID: 47
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

The file is 90 megabytes in size. The first 60 megabytes download at a rate of 5 megabytes per second. To find out how long this takes, we divide the size of the file by the download rate:

60 megabytes รท 5 megabytes/second = 12 seconds

The remaining 30 megabytes (90 megabytes - 60 megabytes) download at a rate of 10 megabytes per second. Again, we divide the size of the file by the download rate:

30 megabytes รท 10 megabytes/second = 3 seconds

Adding these two times together gives us the total time to download the file:

12 seconds + 3 seconds = 15 seconds

So, it takes 15 seconds to download the file entirely.
