==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 487" refers to. Since the problem statement is not specific, let's assume it is a placeholder for a typical math problem. Without specific details, I'll create a hypothetical math problem and solve it step-by-step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**

"Calculate the sum of all even numbers between 1 and 100."

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Identify the Even Numbers:**
   - Even numbers between 1 and 100 are numbers divisible by 2.
   - The sequence of even numbers in this range is: 2, 4, 6, ..., 100.

2. **Determine the Sequence:**
   - This is an arithmetic sequence where the first term \( a_1 = 2 \) and the common difference \( d = 2 \).

3. **Find the Number of Terms (n):**
   - The nth term of an arithmetic sequence is given by the formula:
     \[
     a_n = a_1 + (n-1) \cdot d
     \]
   - We need to find \( n \) such that \( a_n = 100 \):
     \[
     100 = 2 + (n-1) \cdot 2
     \]
     \[
     100 = 2 + 2n - 2
     \]
     \[
     100 = 2n
     \]
     \[
     n = 50
     \]
   - There are 50 even numbers between 1 and 100.

4. **Calculate the Sum of the Sequence:**
   - The sum \( S_n \) of the first \( n \) terms of an arithmetic sequence is given by:
     \[
     S_n = \frac{n}{2} \cdot (a_1 + a_n)
     \]
   - Substitute the known values:
     \[
     S_{50} = \frac{50}{2} \cdot (2 + 100)
     \]
     \[
     S_{50} = 25 \cdot 102
     \]
     \[
     S_{50} = 2550
     \]

**Final Answer:**

The sum of all even numbers between 1 and 100 is 2550.
