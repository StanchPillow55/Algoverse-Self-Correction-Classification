To find out how much money Charlie will make for the day, we need to calculate the earnings from both types of lessons: the standard lessons and the lessons with a veteran.

1. **Calculate the earnings from standard lessons:**
   - Charlie has 4 lessons at his standard rate of $80 per hour.
   - The total earnings from these lessons can be calculated as follows:
     \[
     \text{Earnings from standard lessons} = \text{Number of lessons} \times \text{Standard rate}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Earnings from standard lessons} = 4 \times 80 = 320 \text{ dollars}
     \]

2. **Calculate the reduced rate for veteran lessons:**
   - Charlie reduces his standard rate by 25% for lessons with a veteran.
   - First, we need to find out what 25% of the standard rate is:
     \[
     25\% \text{ of } 80 = 0.25 \times 80 = 20 \text{ dollars}
     \]
   - Now, we subtract this amount from the standard rate to find the reduced rate:
     \[
     \text{Reduced rate} = \text{Standard rate} - 25\% \text{ of Standard rate}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Reduced rate} = 80 - 20 = 60 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Calculate the earnings from veteran lessons:**
   - Charlie has 2 lessons with a veteran at the reduced rate of $60 per hour.
   - The total earnings from these lessons can be calculated as follows:
     \[
     \text{Earnings from veteran lessons} = \text{Number of lessons} \times \text{Reduced rate}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Earnings from veteran lessons} = 2 \times 60 = 120 \text{ dollars}
     \]

4. **Calculate the total earnings for the day:**
   - Now, we add the earnings from standard lessons and veteran lessons to find the total earnings:
     \[
     \text{Total earnings} = \text{Earnings from standard lessons} + \text{Earnings from veteran lessons}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total earnings} = 320 + 120 = 440 \text{ dollars}
     \]

Thus, the total amount of money Charlie will make for the day is \(\boxed{440}\) dollars.
