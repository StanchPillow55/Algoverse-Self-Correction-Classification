To solve this problem, we need to determine how many judges in Rhode Island are over 50 years old based on the given percentages.

1. **Total Number of Judges:**
   - We are given that there are 40 judges in total.

2. **Judges Under 30 Years Old:**
   - 10 percent of the judges are under 30 years old.
   - Calculate the number of judges under 30:
     \[
     0.10 \times 40 = 4
     \]
   - Therefore, there are 4 judges under 30 years old.

3. **Judges Aged 30-50 Years Old:**
   - 60 percent of the judges are between 30 and 50 years old.
   - Calculate the number of judges aged 30-50:
     \[
     0.60 \times 40 = 24
     \]
   - Therefore, there are 24 judges aged 30-50 years old.

4. **Judges Over 50 Years Old:**
   - The rest of the judges are over 50 years old.
   - First, calculate the total number of judges accounted for by the other two age groups:
     \[
     4 \text{ (under 30)} + 24 \text{ (30-50)} = 28
     \]
   - Subtract this from the total number of judges to find the number of judges over 50:
     \[
     40 - 28 = 12
     \]

Thus, the number of judges over 50 years old is \(\boxed{12}\).
