To solve the problem, we need to determine the total amount Sally spends on the pizzas.

1. **Identify the cost of the small pizza**: 
   - The problem states that the small pizza costs $8.

2. **Calculate the cost of the family-size pizza**: 
   - The family-size pizza costs 3 times as much as the small pizza. 
   - Therefore, we calculate the cost of the family-size pizza as follows:
     \[
     \text{Cost of family-size pizza} = 3 \times \text{Cost of small pizza} = 3 \times 8 = 24
     \]
   - So, the family-size pizza costs $24.

3. **Calculate the total cost**: 
   - Now, we need to find the total amount Sally spends by adding the cost of the small pizza and the cost of the family-size pizza:
     \[
     \text{Total cost} = \text{Cost of small pizza} + \text{Cost of family-size pizza} = 8 + 24
     \]
   - Performing the addition:
     \[
     8 + 24 = 32
     \]

4. **Final answer**: 
   - Therefore, the total amount Sally spends on the pizzas is $32.

In conclusion, Sally spends a total of **$32**.
