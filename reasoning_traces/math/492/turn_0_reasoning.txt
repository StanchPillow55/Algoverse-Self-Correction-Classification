==================================================

To find out how many judges are over 50 years old in Rhode Island, we will follow these steps:

1. **Determine the total number of judges**: 
   We know that there are a total of 40 judges in Rhode Island.

2. **Calculate the number of judges under 30 years old**:
   We are given that 10 percent of the judges are under 30 years old. To find this number, we calculate:
   \[
   \text{Number of judges under 30} = 10\% \times 40 = 0.10 \times 40 = 4
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of judges aged 30-50 years old**:
   We are also told that 60 percent of the judges are aged between 30 and 50 years old. To find this number, we calculate:
   \[
   \text{Number of judges aged 30-50} = 60\% \times 40 = 0.60 \times 40 = 24
   \]

4. **Calculate the number of judges over 50 years old**:
   To find the number of judges over 50 years old, we first need to find out how many judges are accounted for by the other two age groups (under 30 and 30-50). We add the number of judges in these two age groups:
   \[
   \text{Total judges under 30 and 30-50} = 4 + 24 = 28
   \]
   Now, we subtract this total from the overall number of judges to find the number of judges over 50:
   \[
   \text{Number of judges over 50} = \text{Total judges} - \text{Total judges under 30 and 30-50} = 40 - 28 = 12
   \]

5. **Final answer**:
   Therefore, the number of judges over 50 years old is:
   \[
   \boxed{12}
   \]
