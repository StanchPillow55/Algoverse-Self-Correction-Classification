It seems like the problem statement is incomplete or unclear. "Sample reasoning question 255" does not provide enough information to solve a specific math problem. However, I can guide you through a general approach to solving math problems by outlining a step-by-step process. If you have a specific math problem in mind, please provide the details, and I'll be happy to help solve it.

### General Approach to Solving Math Problems

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - Read the problem carefully.
   - Identify what is being asked.
   - Determine what information is given.

2. **Devise a Plan:**
   - Think about the strategies that might be useful for solving the problem. This could include:
     - Drawing a diagram.
     - Writing an equation.
     - Breaking the problem into smaller parts.
     - Looking for patterns.

3. **Carry Out the Plan:**
   - Execute the steps you have planned.
   - Perform calculations carefully.
   - Keep track of units and ensure consistency.

4. **Check Your Work:**
   - Review each step to ensure accuracy.
   - Verify that your solution makes sense in the context of the problem.
   - Check calculations for errors.

5. **State the Final Answer:**
   - Clearly write down the final answer.
   - Include units if applicable.

### Example Problem

Let's apply this approach to a simple example problem:

**Problem:** A rectangle has a length of 10 units and a width of 5 units. What is the area of the rectangle?

**Step 1: Understand the Problem**
- We need to find the area of a rectangle.
- Given: Length = 10 units, Width = 5 units.

**Step 2: Devise a Plan**
- The area of a rectangle is calculated using the formula: Area = Length Ã— Width.

**Step 3: Carry Out the Plan**
- Substitute the given values into the formula:
  \[
  \text{Area} = 10 \, \text{units} \times 5 \, \text{units} = 50 \, \text{square units}
  \]

**Step 4: Check Your Work**
- Recalculate to ensure there are no errors:
  \[
  10 \times 5 = 50
  \]
- The calculation is correct.

**Step 5: State the Final Answer**
- The area of the rectangle is 50 square units.

If you have a specific problem or additional details, please provide them, and I can offer a more targeted solution.
