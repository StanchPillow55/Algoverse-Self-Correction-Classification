==================================================

To solve the problem, we first need to understand what "Sample reasoning question 255" refers to. Since the problem statement is not clear, let's assume it is a placeholder for a specific math problem. Without the actual content of "Sample reasoning question 255," I will demonstrate a general approach to solving a typical math problem, such as solving an algebraic equation.

Let's assume the problem is to solve the following algebraic equation for \( x \):

\[ 2x + 3 = 11 \]

**Step 1: Understand the Problem**

The goal is to find the value of \( x \) that satisfies the equation. The equation is linear, meaning it has the form \( ax + b = c \), where \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \) are constants.

**Step 2: Isolate the Variable**

To solve for \( x \), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We can do this by performing operations that will simplify the equation step by step.

**Step 3: Subtract 3 from Both Sides**

To eliminate the constant term on the left side, subtract 3 from both sides of the equation:

\[ 2x + 3 - 3 = 11 - 3 \]

This simplifies to:

\[ 2x = 8 \]

**Step 4: Divide Both Sides by 2**

Now, divide both sides of the equation by 2 to solve for \( x \):

\[ \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{8}{2} \]

This simplifies to:

\[ x = 4 \]

**Step 5: Verify the Solution**

To ensure the solution is correct, substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation:

\[ 2(4) + 3 = 11 \]

Calculate the left side:

\[ 8 + 3 = 11 \]

Since both sides of the equation are equal, the solution \( x = 4 \) is verified.

**Final Answer**

The solution to the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \) is \( x = 4 \).

If "Sample reasoning question 255" refers to a different problem, please provide the specific details or context so I can address it accurately.
