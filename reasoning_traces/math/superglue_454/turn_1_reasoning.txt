==================================================

To solve the problem effectively, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 454" entails. Since the problem statement is not explicitly provided, I'll demonstrate a general approach to solving a typical math problem by breaking it down into steps. Let's assume a hypothetical math problem and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**
Calculate the value of \( x \) in the equation \( 3x + 5 = 20 \).

**Step 1: Understand the Problem**
We have a linear equation in one variable, \( x \). Our goal is to solve for \( x \).

**Step 2: Isolate the Variable**
To solve for \( x \), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. The equation is:

\[ 3x + 5 = 20 \]

First, subtract 5 from both sides to eliminate the constant term on the left side:

\[ 3x + 5 - 5 = 20 - 5 \]

This simplifies to:

\[ 3x = 15 \]

**Step 3: Solve for the Variable**
Now, divide both sides by 3 to solve for \( x \):

\[ \frac{3x}{3} = \frac{15}{3} \]

This simplifies to:

\[ x = 5 \]

**Step 4: Verify the Solution**
To ensure our solution is correct, substitute \( x = 5 \) back into the original equation:

\[ 3(5) + 5 = 20 \]

Calculate the left side:

\[ 15 + 5 = 20 \]

Since both sides of the equation are equal, our solution is verified.

**Final Answer:**
The value of \( x \) is 5.

This step-by-step approach can be applied to a wide range of math problems, ensuring that each step is logically sound and that the final answer is verified. If you have a specific problem or need further assistance, please provide more details.
