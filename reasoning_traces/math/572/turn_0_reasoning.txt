To solve the problem, we need to determine how many roses Ford grows in a month and how many roses he needs to supply to the flower shops in that same time period. Then, we will find out how many roses he lacks.

### Step 1: Calculate the total number of roses Ford grows in a month.

Ford grows 40 roses every week. There are 4 weeks in a month (assuming a standard month for simplicity).

\[
\text{Total roses grown in a month} = \text{roses per week} \times \text{number of weeks}
\]
\[
\text{Total roses grown in a month} = 40 \text{ roses/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 160 \text{ roses}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the total number of roses ordered by the flower shops in a month.

Now, we need to find out how many roses each flower shop orders in a week and then multiply that by the number of weeks in a month.

- First flower shop orders: 20 roses/week
- Second flower shop orders: 15 roses/week
- Third flower shop orders: 30 roses/week

Now, we calculate the total weekly orders:

\[
\text{Total weekly orders} = 20 + 15 + 30 = 65 \text{ roses/week}
\]

Next, we calculate the total orders for the month:

\[
\text{Total orders in a month} = \text{Total weekly orders} \times \text{number of weeks}
\]
\[
\text{Total orders in a month} = 65 \text{ roses/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 260 \text{ roses}
\]

### Step 3: Determine how many roses Ford lacks.

Now we need to find out how many roses Ford lacks to meet the total orders.

\[
\text{Roses lacking} = \text{Total orders in a month} - \text{Total roses grown in a month}
\]
\[
\text{Roses lacking} = 260 \text{ roses} - 160 \text{ roses} = 100 \text{ roses}
\]

### Final Answer

Ford lacks **100 roses** to supply all the flower shops every month.
