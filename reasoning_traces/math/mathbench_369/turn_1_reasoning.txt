==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 369," we need to first understand what the problem is asking. However, the problem statement is not clear or complete. It seems like "Sample math problem 369" is a placeholder or reference to a specific problem that is not provided here. 

To proceed, let's assume a hypothetical math problem related to the number 369. We can create a problem involving basic arithmetic operations, factors, or properties of the number 369. Let's explore a few possibilities:

### Hypothetical Problem 1: Prime Factorization
**Problem:** Find the prime factorization of 369.

**Solution:**
1. **Check divisibility by 2:** 
   - 369 is an odd number, so it is not divisible by 2.

2. **Check divisibility by 3:** 
   - Sum of digits of 369 is \(3 + 6 + 9 = 18\).
   - 18 is divisible by 3, so 369 is divisible by 3.
   - Divide 369 by 3: \(369 \div 3 = 123\).

3. **Factor 123:**
   - Sum of digits of 123 is \(1 + 2 + 3 = 6\).
   - 6 is divisible by 3, so 123 is divisible by 3.
   - Divide 123 by 3: \(123 \div 3 = 41\).

4. **Check if 41 is a prime number:**
   - 41 is not divisible by 2, 3, or 5 (all primes less than \(\sqrt{41}\)).
   - Therefore, 41 is a prime number.

5. **Prime factorization of 369:**
   - The prime factors of 369 are 3, 3, and 41.
   - Therefore, the prime factorization is \(3^2 \times 41\).

**Final Answer:** The prime factorization of 369 is \(3^2 \times 41\).

### Hypothetical Problem 2: Sum of Digits
**Problem:** What is the sum of the digits of 369?

**Solution:**
1. Identify the digits of 369: 3, 6, and 9.
2. Calculate the sum of these digits: \(3 + 6 + 9 = 18\).

**Final Answer:** The sum of the digits of 369 is 18.

### Hypothetical Problem 3: Divisibility Check
**Problem:** Is 369 divisible by 9?

**Solution:**
1. **Sum of digits:** Calculate the sum of the digits of 369: \(3 + 6 + 9 = 18\).
2. **Check divisibility by 9:** 
   - A number is divisible by 9 if the sum of its digits is divisible by 9.
   - 18 is divisible by 9.

**Final Answer:** Yes, 369 is divisible by 9.

Since the original problem statement was not provided, these hypothetical problems demonstrate different mathematical properties and operations involving the number 369. If you have a specific problem in mind, please provide more details for a precise solution.
