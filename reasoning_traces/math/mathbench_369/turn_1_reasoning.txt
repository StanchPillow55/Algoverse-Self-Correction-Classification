==================================================

To solve the problem, we first need to understand what "Sample math problem 369" refers to. Since the problem is not explicitly stated, I'll assume it's a placeholder for a typical math problem. Let's create a sample problem involving the number 369 and solve it step by step.

**Sample Problem:**

Calculate the sum of the digits of the number 369, and then multiply the result by 3.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Identify the digits of the number 369:**
   - The number 369 consists of the digits 3, 6, and 9.

2. **Calculate the sum of the digits:**
   - Add the digits together: \(3 + 6 + 9\).

   \[
   3 + 6 = 9
   \]
   \[
   9 + 9 = 18
   \]

   So, the sum of the digits is 18.

3. **Multiply the sum by 3:**
   - Take the sum from the previous step and multiply it by 3: \(18 \times 3\).

   \[
   18 \times 3 = 54
   \]

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The result of multiplying the sum of the digits of 369 by 3 is 54.

Therefore, the final answer to the sample problem is 54.
