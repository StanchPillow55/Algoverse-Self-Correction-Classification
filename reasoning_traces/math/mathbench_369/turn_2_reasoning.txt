Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample math problem 369" refers to. Since this is not a standard math problem description, I will assume it is a placeholder for a specific math problem. Without additional context or details, I will create a hypothetical math problem involving the number 369 and solve it step by step.

Let's assume the problem is as follows:

**Problem:** Find the sum of the digits of the number 369, and then determine if this sum is a prime number.

**Step 1: Find the sum of the digits of 369.**

The number 369 consists of three digits: 3, 6, and 9. To find the sum of these digits, we add them together:

\[ 3 + 6 + 9 = 18 \]

**Step 2: Determine if the sum (18) is a prime number.**

A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. To determine if 18 is a prime number, we need to check if it has any divisors other than 1 and 18.

- 18 is divisible by 2 (since it is even).
- 18 is divisible by 3 (since \(1 + 8 = 9\), and 9 is divisible by 3).

Since 18 has divisors other than 1 and itself (specifically, 2 and 3), it is not a prime number.

**Conclusion:**

The sum of the digits of 369 is 18, and 18 is not a prime number.

**Final Answer:**

The sum of the digits of 369 is 18, and it is not a prime number.
