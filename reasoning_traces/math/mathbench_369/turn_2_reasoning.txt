==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 369," we first need to understand what the problem is asking. However, the problem statement "Sample math problem 369" is not specific and does not provide any details about what needs to be solved. 

Since there is no specific mathematical question or context provided, I will demonstrate a general approach to solving a typical math problem by creating an example problem related to the number 369. Let's consider a problem involving basic arithmetic operations with the number 369.

Example Problem:
Calculate the sum of the digits of the number 369, and then multiply the result by 3.

Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Identify the digits of the number 369**:
   - The number 369 consists of three digits: 3, 6, and 9.

2. **Calculate the sum of the digits**:
   - Add the digits together: \(3 + 6 + 9\).

3. **Perform the addition**:
   - \(3 + 6 = 9\).
   - \(9 + 9 = 18\).
   - Therefore, the sum of the digits is 18.

4. **Multiply the sum by 3**:
   - Take the sum of the digits (18) and multiply it by 3: \(18 \times 3\).

5. **Perform the multiplication**:
   - \(18 \times 3 = 54\).

6. **Final Answer**:
   - The result of multiplying the sum of the digits of 369 by 3 is 54.

Therefore, the final answer to the example problem is 54.
