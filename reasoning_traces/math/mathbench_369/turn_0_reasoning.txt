   \[
   3 + 6 + 9 = 18
   \]
   Final answer: 18

2. **Multiplication**: If the problem involves multiplying digits of 369:
   \[
   3 \times 6 \times 9 = 162
   \]
   Final answer: 162

3. **Subtraction**: If the problem involves subtracting digits of 369 in sequence:
   \[
   3 - 6 - 9 = -12
   \]
   Final answer: -12

4. **Division**: If the problem involves dividing digits of 369 in sequence:
   \[
   \frac{3}{6} = 0.5, \quad \frac{0.5}{9} \approx 0.0556
   \]
   Final answer: Approximately 0.0556

### Possibility 2: Number Properties

1. **Sum of Digits**: The sum of the digits of 369 is:
   \[
   3 + 6 + 9 = 18
   \]
   Final answer: 18

2. **Product of Digits**: The product of the digits of 369 is:
   \[
   3 \times 6 \times 9 = 162
   \]
   Final answer: 162

3. **Reversing the Number**: If the problem involves reversing the digits of 369:
   \[
   963
   \]
   Final answer: 963

### Possibility 3: Divisibility

1. **Divisibility by 3**: A number is divisible by 3 if the sum of its digits is divisible by 3. For 369:
   \[
   3 + 6 + 9 = 18 \quad (\text{which is divisible by 3})
   \]
   Therefore, 369 is divisible by 3.

2. **Divisibility by 9**: A number is divisible by 9 if the sum of its digits is divisible by 9. For 369:
   \[
   3 + 6 + 9 = 18 \quad (\text{which is divisible by 9})
   \]
   Therefore, 369 is divisible by 9.

### Conclusion
