==================================================

It seems like the problem statement "Sample math problem 369" is not a complete math problem. It appears to be a placeholder or reference to a specific problem that might be listed elsewhere. To solve a math problem, I need the full details of the problem, including any numbers, equations, or specific questions that need to be addressed.

If you have a specific math problem in mind, please provide the full details, and I'll be happy to help you solve it step by step.
