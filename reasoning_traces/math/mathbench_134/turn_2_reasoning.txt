==================================================

To solve the problem, we first need to understand what "Sample math problem 134" refers to. Since the problem itself is not provided, I will assume a generic math problem and demonstrate how to solve it step by step. Let's consider a common type of math problem: solving a quadratic equation.

**Sample Math Problem 134:**
Solve the quadratic equation \(2x^2 - 4x - 6 = 0\).

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Identify the coefficients:**
   The given quadratic equation is in the standard form \(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\), where:
   - \(a = 2\)
   - \(b = -4\)
   - \(c = -6\)

2. **Use the quadratic formula:**
   The quadratic formula is given by:
   \[
   x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
   \]

3. **Calculate the discriminant:**
   The discriminant (\(\Delta\)) is the part under the square root in the quadratic formula:
   \[
   \Delta = b^2 - 4ac
   \]
   Substituting the values of \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\):
   \[
   \Delta = (-4)^2 - 4 \times 2 \times (-6) = 16 + 48 = 64
   \]

4. **Evaluate the square root of the discriminant:**
   Since \(\Delta = 64\), we find the square root:
   \[
   \sqrt{64} = 8
   \]

5. **Substitute into the quadratic formula:**
   Now substitute \(b\), \(\sqrt{\Delta}\), and \(a\) into the quadratic formula:
   \[
   x = \frac{-(-4) \pm 8}{2 \times 2} = \frac{4 \pm 8}{4}
   \]

6. **Calculate the two possible solutions:**
   - For the positive case (\(+\)):
     \[
     x = \frac{4 + 8}{4} = \frac{12}{4} = 3
     \]
   - For the negative case (\(-\)):
     \[
     x = \frac{4 - 8}{4} = \frac{-4}{4} = -1
     \]

7. **State the final answer:**
   The solutions to the quadratic equation \(2x^2 - 4x - 6 = 0\) are \(x = 3\) and \(x = -1\).

**Final Answer:**
\(x = 3\) and \(x = -1\)
