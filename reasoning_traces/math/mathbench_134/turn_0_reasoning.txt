==================================================

It seems like you've referenced a "Sample math problem 134," but without specific details or context about what the problem entails, I can't provide a solution. However, I can guide you through a generic approach to solving math problems. If you provide more details about the problem, I can give a more tailored solution. Here's a general approach:

### Step-by-Step Approach to Solving Math Problems

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - Read the problem carefully.
   - Identify what is being asked.
   - Note down the given information and any constraints.

2. **Devise a Plan:**
   - Think about the mathematical concepts that might apply (e.g., algebra, geometry, calculus).
   - Consider similar problems you've solved before.
   - Decide on a strategy to tackle the problem (e.g., drawing a diagram, creating an equation).

3. **Carry Out the Plan:**
   - Execute your strategy step by step.
   - Perform calculations carefully.
   - Keep track of units and ensure consistency.

4. **Check Your Work:**
   - Review each step to ensure there are no errors.
   - Verify that your solution makes sense in the context of the problem.
   - Check if there is another method to solve the problem for confirmation.

5. **State the Final Answer:**
   - Clearly write down the final answer.
   - Include units if applicable.

### Example Problem

Since I don't have the specifics of "Sample math problem 134," let's consider a generic example:

**Problem:** Solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).

**Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We need to find the value of \( x \) that satisfies the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).

2. **Devise a Plan:**
   - We can isolate \( x \) by performing algebraic operations.

3. **Carry Out the Plan:**
   - Subtract 3 from both sides of the equation:
     \[
     2x + 3 - 3 = 11 - 3
     \]
     \[
     2x = 8
     \]
   - Divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( x \):
     \[
     \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{8}{2}
     \]
     \[
     x = 4
     \]

4. **Check Your Work:**
   - Substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation to verify:
     \[
     2(4) + 3 = 8 + 3 = 11
     \]
   - The left side equals the right side, confirming our solution is correct.

5. **State the Final Answer:**
   - The solution to the equation is \( x = 4 \).

If you provide the specific details of "Sample math problem 134," I can offer a more precise solution.
