==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample math problem 479" refers to. Since the problem isn't explicitly stated, I'll create a sample math problem labeled as "479" and solve it step by step.

**Sample Math Problem 479:**

Calculate the value of \( x \) in the equation:

\[ 3x + 7 = 4x - 5 \]

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Equation:**

   We have a linear equation in one variable, \( x \). The goal is to find the value of \( x \) that satisfies the equation.

2. **Isolate the Variable:**

   To solve for \( x \), we need to get all terms involving \( x \) on one side of the equation and constant terms on the other side.

   Start by subtracting \( 3x \) from both sides of the equation to move the \( x \)-terms to one side:

   \[
   3x + 7 - 3x = 4x - 5 - 3x
   \]

   Simplifying both sides gives:

   \[
   7 = x - 5
   \]

3. **Solve for \( x \):**

   Next, add 5 to both sides to isolate \( x \):

   \[
   7 + 5 = x - 5 + 5
   \]

   Simplifying both sides gives:

   \[
   12 = x
   \]

4. **Verify the Solution:**

   Substitute \( x = 12 \) back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies the equation:

   Original equation: \( 3x + 7 = 4x - 5 \)

   Substitute \( x = 12 \):

   Left side: \( 3(12) + 7 = 36 + 7 = 43 \)

   Right side: \( 4(12) - 5 = 48 - 5 = 43 \)

   Since both sides are equal, \( x = 12 \) is indeed the correct solution.

**Final Answer:**

The value of \( x \) is \( \boxed{12} \).
