==================================================

To solve the problem, we first need to understand what "Sample math problem 479" refers to. Since the problem itself is not provided, I'll create a hypothetical math problem that could be labeled as "Sample math problem 479" and solve it step by step.

Let's assume "Sample math problem 479" is the following:

**Problem:**
A rectangle has a length that is 3 times its width. If the perimeter of the rectangle is 48 units, find the dimensions of the rectangle.

**Solution:**

Step 1: Understand the problem.
- We have a rectangle with a length (L) and a width (W).
- The length is 3 times the width: \( L = 3W \).
- The perimeter of the rectangle is 48 units.

Step 2: Recall the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle.
- The perimeter (P) of a rectangle is given by the formula: 
  \[
  P = 2L + 2W
  \]

Step 3: Substitute the known values into the perimeter formula.
- We know \( P = 48 \) and \( L = 3W \).
- Substitute these into the perimeter formula:
  \[
  48 = 2(3W) + 2W
  \]

Step 4: Simplify the equation.
- Simplify the terms inside the equation:
  \[
  48 = 6W + 2W
  \]
- Combine like terms:
  \[
  48 = 8W
  \]

Step 5: Solve for W.
- Divide both sides of the equation by 8 to solve for W:
  \[
  W = \frac{48}{8} = 6
  \]

Step 6: Find the length using the relationship between length and width.
- Since \( L = 3W \), substitute \( W = 6 \) into the equation for L:
  \[
  L = 3 \times 6 = 18
  \]

Step 7: Verify the solution.
- Check that the dimensions satisfy the perimeter condition:
  \[
  P = 2L + 2W = 2(18) + 2(6) = 36 + 12 = 48
  \]
- The calculated perimeter matches the given perimeter, confirming our solution is correct.

**Final Answer:**
The dimensions of the rectangle are a width of 6 units and a length of 18 units.
