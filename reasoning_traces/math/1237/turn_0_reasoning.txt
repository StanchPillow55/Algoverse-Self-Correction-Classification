To determine how many teachers were at Rydell Elementary School last Friday, we need to consider the total number of teachers, the number of teachers who were sick, and the number of substitute teachers who were called in.

1. **Total number of teachers**: There are 82 teachers at Rydell Elementary School.

2. **Number of sick teachers**: Out of the 82 teachers, 13 were sick.

3. **Calculating the number of teachers who were present**:
   - To find out how many teachers were present, we subtract the number of sick teachers from the total number of teachers:
   \[
   \text{Number of present teachers} = \text{Total teachers} - \text{Sick teachers}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Number of present teachers} = 82 - 13 = 69
   \]

4. **Number of substitute teachers**: There were 9 substitute teachers called in to help.

5. **Calculating the total number of teachers at school that day**:
   - To find the total number of teachers at school, we add the number of present teachers to the number of substitute teachers:
   \[
   \text{Total teachers at school} = \text{Present teachers} + \text{Substitute teachers}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total teachers at school} = 69 + 9 = 78
   \]

Thus, the total number of teachers at Rydell Elementary School last Friday was **78**.

Final answer: **78 teachers were at school that day.**
