Dataset Type: math
==================================================

It seems like the question provided is incomplete or lacks specific details about the math problem you want to solve. However, I will demonstrate how to approach a sample math problem step by step. Let's create a sample problem and solve it.

### Sample Problem:
Calculate the sum of the first 10 positive integers.

### Step 1: Identify the integers
The first 10 positive integers are:
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10

### Step 2: Use the formula for the sum of the first n integers
The formula for the sum of the first \( n \) positive integers is given by:
\[
S_n = \frac{n(n + 1)}{2}
\]
where \( n \) is the last integer in the series.

### Step 3: Substitute \( n = 10 \) into the formula
Here, \( n = 10 \):
\[
S_{10} = \frac{10(10 + 1)}{2}
\]

### Step 4: Perform the calculations
1. Calculate \( 10 + 1 \):
   \[
   10 + 1 = 11
   \]
2. Multiply \( 10 \) by \( 11 \):
   \[
   10 \times 11 = 110
   \]
3. Divide by \( 2 \):
   \[
   \frac{110}{2} = 55
   \]

### Final Answer
The sum of the first 10 positive integers is \( 55 \).

If you have a specific math problem in mind, please provide the details, and I will be happy to help you solve it step by step!
