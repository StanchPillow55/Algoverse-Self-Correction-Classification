==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample math problem 450" refers to. Since the problem is not explicitly stated, I'll assume "450" is the number we need to work with, and I'll create a math problem around it. Let's consider a problem involving the number 450:

**Problem:**
Determine the prime factorization of 450 and calculate the sum of its prime factors.

**Step-by-step Solution:**

1. **Prime Factorization:**
   - Start by dividing 450 by the smallest prime number, which is 2. Since 450 is even, it is divisible by 2.
     \[
     450 \div 2 = 225
     \]
   - Next, check if 225 is divisible by 2. Since 225 is odd, it is not divisible by 2. Move to the next smallest prime number, which is 3.
   - Check divisibility by 3. The sum of the digits of 225 is \(2 + 2 + 5 = 9\), which is divisible by 3. Therefore, 225 is divisible by 3.
     \[
     225 \div 3 = 75
     \]
   - Check if 75 is divisible by 3. The sum of the digits of 75 is \(7 + 5 = 12\), which is divisible by 3.
     \[
     75 \div 3 = 25
     \]
   - Now, check if 25 is divisible by 3. The sum of the digits of 25 is \(2 + 5 = 7\), which is not divisible by 3. Move to the next smallest prime number, which is 5.
   - 25 ends in 5, so it is divisible by 5.
     \[
     25 \div 5 = 5
     \]
   - Finally, 5 is a prime number, and dividing it by itself gives:
     \[
     5 \div 5 = 1
     \]

2. **Prime Factorization Result:**
   - The prime factorization of 450 is \(2 \times 3^2 \times 5^2\).

3. **Sum of Prime Factors:**
   - The distinct prime factors of 450 are 2, 3, and 5.
   - Sum these prime factors:
     \[
     2 + 3 + 5 = 10
     \]

**Final Answer:**
The sum of the prime factors of 450 is 10.
