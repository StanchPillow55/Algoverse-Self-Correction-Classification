==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample math problem 450" refers to. Since there is no specific problem statement provided, I'll assume this is a placeholder for a generic math problem. Let's create a sample math problem and solve it step by step.

**Sample Math Problem:**

Let's assume the problem is as follows:

"Calculate the sum of the first 450 positive integers."

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   We need to find the sum of the first 450 positive integers. The sequence of the first 450 positive integers is: 1, 2, 3, ..., 450.

2. **Identify the Formula:**
   The sum of the first \( n \) positive integers can be calculated using the formula:
   \[
   S_n = \frac{n(n + 1)}{2}
   \]
   where \( S_n \) is the sum of the first \( n \) integers.

3. **Substitute the Values:**
   In this problem, \( n = 450 \). Substitute 450 into the formula:
   \[
   S_{450} = \frac{450(450 + 1)}{2}
   \]

4. **Calculate the Sum:**
   First, calculate \( 450 + 1 \):
   \[
   450 + 1 = 451
   \]

   Next, multiply 450 by 451:
   \[
   450 \times 451 = 203,850
   \]

   Finally, divide the product by 2 to find the sum:
   \[
   S_{450} = \frac{203,850}{2} = 101,925
   \]

5. **Verify the Calculation:**
   To ensure accuracy, let's verify the calculation:
   - Recalculate \( 450 \times 451 \):
     \[
     450 \times 451 = 203,850
     \]
   - Divide by 2:
     \[
     \frac{203,850}{2} = 101,925
     \]

   The calculations are consistent and correct.

**Final Answer:**

The sum of the first 450 positive integers is \( 101,925 \).
