Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

It seems like the problem statement is incomplete or unclear. However, I will interpret "Sample math problem 450" as a request to solve a math problem that could be labeled as "450." Since no specific math problem is provided, I will create a sample math problem and solve it step by step.

**Sample Math Problem:**
Calculate the sum of the first 10 positive integers.

**Step 1: Identify the first 10 positive integers.**
The first 10 positive integers are:
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10

**Step 2: Use the formula for the sum of the first n positive integers.**
The formula for the sum \( S \) of the first \( n \) positive integers is given by:
\[
S = \frac{n(n + 1)}{2}
\]
where \( n \) is the number of terms.

**Step 3: Substitute \( n = 10 \) into the formula.**
\[
S = \frac{10(10 + 1)}{2}
\]
\[
S = \frac{10 \times 11}{2}
\]

**Step 4: Perform the multiplication.**
\[
10 \times 11 = 110
\]

**Step 5: Divide by 2.**
\[
S = \frac{110}{2} = 55
\]

**Final Answer:**
The sum of the first 10 positive integers is \( 55 \).

If you have a specific math problem in mind labeled as "450," please provide the details, and I will solve that problem step by step.
