==================================================

It seems like the question you've provided is a bit vague, as "Sample math problem 450" does not specify a particular math problem to solve. However, I can create a sample math problem and solve it step by step for you. 

Let's consider a sample math problem involving basic arithmetic and algebra:

**Problem:**
A store sells pencils for $0.50 each and erasers for $0.75 each. If a student buys a total of 10 items (pencils and erasers) and spends $6.00, how many pencils and how many erasers did the student buy?

**Step 1: Define Variables**
Let:
- \( p \) = number of pencils
- \( e \) = number of erasers

**Step 2: Set Up Equations**
From the problem, we can set up the following equations based on the information given:

1. The total number of items (pencils and erasers) is 10:
   \[
   p + e = 10
   \]

2. The total cost of the items is $6.00:
   \[
   0.50p + 0.75e = 6.00
   \]

**Step 3: Solve the First Equation for One Variable**
We can solve the first equation for \( p \):
\[
p = 10 - e
\]

**Step 4: Substitute into the Second Equation**
Now, we substitute \( p \) in the second equation:
\[
0.50(10 - e) + 0.75e = 6.00
\]

**Step 5: Distribute and Simplify**
Distributing \( 0.50 \):
\[
5 - 0.50e + 0.75e = 6.00
\]
Combine like terms:
\[
5 + 0.25e = 6.00
\]

**Step 6: Isolate \( e \)**
Subtract 5 from both sides:
\[
0.25e = 1.00
\]
Now, divide by 0.25:
\[
e = \frac{1.00}{0.25} = 4
\]

**Step 7: Find \( p \)**
Now that we have \( e \), we can find \( p \):
\[
p = 10 - e = 10 - 4 = 6
\]

**Step 8: Conclusion**
The student bought 6 pencils and 4 erasers.

**Final Answer:**
The student bought 6 pencils and 4 erasers.
