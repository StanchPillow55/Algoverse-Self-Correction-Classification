==================================================

It seems like the problem statement "Sample math problem 450" is not providing enough information to solve a specific math problem. It appears to be a placeholder or reference to a specific problem that might be listed elsewhere. To assist you effectively, I would need more details or context about the problem you are referring to.

However, I can create a sample math problem and solve it step by step for you. Let's consider a problem involving basic algebra:

**Sample Problem:**

Solve for \( x \) in the equation:

\[ 3x + 5 = 20 \]

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Equation:**
   The equation given is \( 3x + 5 = 20 \). Our goal is to solve for \( x \).

2. **Isolate the Variable:**
   To isolate \( x \), we need to get rid of the constant term on the left side of the equation. We can do this by subtracting 5 from both sides of the equation.

   \[
   3x + 5 - 5 = 20 - 5
   \]

   Simplifying both sides gives:

   \[
   3x = 15
   \]

3. **Solve for \( x \):**
   Now, we need to solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides of the equation by 3.

   \[
   \frac{3x}{3} = \frac{15}{3}
   \]

   Simplifying both sides gives:

   \[
   x = 5
   \]

4. **Verify the Solution:**
   To ensure our solution is correct, we can substitute \( x = 5 \) back into the original equation and check if both sides are equal.

   Substitute \( x = 5 \) into \( 3x + 5 \):

   \[
   3(5) + 5 = 15 + 5 = 20
   \]

   Since both sides of the equation are equal, our solution is verified.

**Final Answer:**

The solution to the equation \( 3x + 5 = 20 \) is \( x = 5 \).
