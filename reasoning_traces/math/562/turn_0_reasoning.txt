==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to determine the angle between the ground and the sun after it has moved for 10 hours, starting from the tip of the pyramid.

1. **Initial Angle of the Pyramid**: The angle of the pyramid from the ground is given as 32 degrees.

2. **Sun's Movement**: The sun moves at a rate of 5 degrees per hour. 

3. **Total Movement of the Sun**: Over a period of 10 hours, the total movement of the sun can be calculated as follows:
   \[
   \text{Total movement} = \text{Rate of movement} \times \text{Time} = 5 \text{ degrees/hour} \times 10 \text{ hours} = 50 \text{ degrees}
   \]

4. **Final Angle of the Sun**: The sun starts at the tip of the pyramid, which is at an angle of 32 degrees from the ground. After moving for 10 hours, we need to add the total movement of the sun to the initial angle of the pyramid:
   \[
   \text{Final angle} = \text{Initial angle} + \text{Total movement} = 32 \text{ degrees} + 50 \text{ degrees} = 82 \text{ degrees}
   \]

5. **Conclusion**: Therefore, after 10 hours, the angle from the ground to the sun will be:
   \[
   \boxed{82 \text{ degrees}}
   \]
