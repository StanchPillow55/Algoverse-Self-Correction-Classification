==================================================

To solve the problem, we start by defining the variables based on the given ratio of popsicles that Betty and Sam have.

1. **Understanding the Ratio**: The ratio of popsicles that Betty and Sam have is given as 5:6. This means that for every 5 popsicles Betty has, Sam has 6 popsicles.

2. **Defining Variables**: We can express the number of popsicles Betty has as \( 5x \) and the number of popsicles Sam has as \( 6x \), where \( x \) is a common multiplier.

3. **Setting Up the Equation**: According to the problem, the total number of popsicles they have together is 165. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:
   \[
   5x + 6x = 165
   \]

4. **Combining Like Terms**: Combine the terms on the left side of the equation:
   \[
   11x = 165
   \]

5. **Solving for \( x \)**: To find \( x \), divide both sides of the equation by 11:
   \[
   x = \frac{165}{11} = 15
   \]

6. **Calculating the Number of Popsicles**:
   - Now that we have \( x \), we can find the number of popsicles each person has:
     - Betty's popsicles: 
       \[
       5x = 5 \times 15 = 75
       \]
     - Sam's popsicles: 
       \[
       6x = 6 \times 15 = 90
       \]

7. **Finding the Difference**: To find how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty, we subtract the number of popsicles Betty has from the number Sam has:
   \[
   90 - 75 = 15
   \]

8. **Final Answer**: Therefore, Sam has 15 more popsicles than Betty.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{15}
\]
