To determine the total number of years Tony spent in school to become an astronaut, we need to add up the years he spent obtaining each of his degrees. Let's break down the information given in the problem:

1. **First Degree in Science:**
   - Tony spent 4 years in college to obtain his first degree in science.

2. **Two Additional Degrees:**
   - Tony pursued 2 more degrees, each taking the same period of time as his first degree. Since his first degree took 4 years, each of these additional degrees also took 4 years.
   - Therefore, for the two additional degrees, he spent \(2 \times 4 = 8\) years.

3. **Graduate Degree in Physics:**
   - Tony spent an additional 2 years to obtain a graduate degree in physics.

Now, we will sum up all the years Tony spent in school:

- Years for the first degree: 4 years
- Years for the two additional degrees: 8 years
- Years for the graduate degree: 2 years

Adding these together gives us the total number of years Tony spent in school:

\[
4 \text{ years} + 8 \text{ years} + 2 \text{ years} = 14 \text{ years}
\]

Therefore, Tony spent a total of 14 years in school to become an astronaut.

**Final Answer: 14 years**
