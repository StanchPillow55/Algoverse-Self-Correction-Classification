==================================================

To determine how many years Tony went to school to become an astronaut, we will break down the information provided step by step.

1. **Undergraduate Degree in Science**:
   - Tony attended college for **4 years** to get his degree in science.

2. **Additional Degrees**:
   - Tony then pursued **2 more degrees** in other fields, each taking the same amount of time as his first degree. Since each of these degrees also took **4 years**, we calculate the total time for these degrees:
     \[
     2 \text{ degrees} \times 4 \text{ years/degree} = 8 \text{ years}
     \]

3. **Graduate Degree in Physics**:
   - After obtaining his undergraduate and additional degrees, Tony pursued a graduate degree in physics, which took **2 years**.

Now, we will sum all the years spent in school:

- Years for the undergraduate degree: **4 years**
- Years for the additional degrees: **8 years**
- Years for the graduate degree: **2 years**

Adding these together:
\[
4 \text{ years} + 8 \text{ years} + 2 \text{ years} = 14 \text{ years}
\]

Thus, the total number of years Tony went to school to become an astronaut is **14 years**.

Final answer: **14 years**.
