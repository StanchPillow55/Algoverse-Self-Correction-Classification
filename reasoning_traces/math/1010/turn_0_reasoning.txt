Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we will first determine how many laps each person can run based on the information provided.

1. **Determine Bethany's laps:**
   - Bethany can run 10 laps in one hour.

   \[
   \text{Bethany's laps} = 10
   \]

2. **Determine Trey's laps:**
   - Trey can run 4 more laps than Bethany.

   \[
   \text{Trey's laps} = \text{Bethany's laps} + 4 = 10 + 4 = 14
   \]

3. **Determine Shaelyn's laps:**
   - Shaelyn can run half as many laps as Trey.

   \[
   \text{Shaelyn's laps} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Trey's laps} = \frac{1}{2} \times 14 = 7
   \]

4. **Determine Quinn's laps:**
   - Quinn can run 2 fewer laps than Shaelyn.

   \[
   \text{Quinn's laps} = \text{Shaelyn's laps} - 2 = 7 - 2 = 5
   \]

5. **Calculate how many more laps Bethany can run compared to Quinn:**
   - We need to find the difference between the number of laps Bethany can run and the number of laps Quinn can run.

   \[
   \text{Difference} = \text{Bethany's laps} - \text{Quinn's laps} = 10 - 5 = 5
   \]

Thus, Bethany can run **5 more laps** than Quinn.

Final answer:

\[
\text{Bethany can run 5 more laps compared to Quinn.}
\]
