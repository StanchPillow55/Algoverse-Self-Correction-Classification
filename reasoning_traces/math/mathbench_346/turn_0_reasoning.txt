==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 346," we need to first understand what the problem is asking. Since the problem statement is not explicitly given, I'll assume this is a placeholder for a specific math problem. Let's create a hypothetical math problem with the number 346 and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**
Calculate the sum of the digits of the number 346 and then multiply the result by 3.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Identify the digits of the number 346:**
   - The number 346 consists of the digits 3, 4, and 6.

2. **Calculate the sum of these digits:**
   - Sum = 3 + 4 + 6

3. **Perform the addition:**
   - First, add 3 and 4:
     \[
     3 + 4 = 7
     \]
   - Then, add the result to 6:
     \[
     7 + 6 = 13
     \]

4. **Multiply the sum by 3:**
   - Multiply the sum (13) by 3:
     \[
     13 \times 3 = 39
     \]

5. **Final Answer:**
   - The final result after multiplying the sum of the digits by 3 is 39.

Therefore, the solution to the hypothetical problem is 39.
