To solve the problem, we need to determine how many marshmallows are left after John and DeSean make their S'mores and after accounting for the marshmallows that were dropped.

1. **Initial Count of Marshmallows**: 
   - The bag contains 35 marshmallows.

2. **Marshmallows Used for S'mores**:
   - John makes 9 S'mores, which uses 9 marshmallows.
   - DeSean also makes 9 S'mores, which uses another 9 marshmallows.
   - Total marshmallows used for S'mores = 9 (John) + 9 (DeSean) = 18 marshmallows.

3. **Marshmallows Dropped**:
   - They dropped 3 marshmallows on the ground.

4. **Total Marshmallows Used**:
   - Total marshmallows used = marshmallows for S'mores + marshmallows dropped = 18 + 3 = 21 marshmallows.

5. **Marshmallows Remaining**:
   - To find out how many marshmallows are left in the bag, we subtract the total marshmallows used from the initial count:
   \[
   \text{Marshmallows remaining} = \text{Initial marshmallows} - \text{Total marshmallows used} = 35 - 21 = 14 \text{ marshmallows}.
   \]

6. **Making More S'mores**:
   - Each S'more requires 1 marshmallow. Therefore, with the 14 marshmallows remaining, they can make:
   \[
   \text{Total S'mores possible} = 14 \text{ S'mores}.
   \]

7. **Distributing the Remaining Marshmallows**:
   - If John and DeSean want to share the remaining marshmallows equally, we divide the remaining marshmallows by 2:
   \[
   \text{S'mores each can have} = \frac{14}{2} = 7 \text{ S'mores}.
   \]

Thus, each kid can have **7 S'mores** with the marshmallows left in the bag.

**Final Answer**: Each kid can have 7 S'mores.
