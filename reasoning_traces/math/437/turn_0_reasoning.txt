To solve the problem, we need to determine how many chickens Lao sold based on the profit he made. We will break down the problem step by step.

1. **Understanding the Profit**: 
   Lao makes a profit of $65 from selling chickens. Profit is calculated as the total revenue from sales minus the total costs (expenses).

2. **Revenue from Selling Chickens**: 
   Each chicken is sold for $1.50. If we let \( n \) be the number of chickens sold, then the total revenue from selling the chickens can be expressed as:
   \[
   \text{Total Revenue} = 1.50n
   \]

3. **Cost of Chicken Feed**: 
   Each chicken requires 2 pounds of feed. Therefore, the total amount of feed needed for \( n \) chickens is:
   \[
   \text{Total Feed Needed} = 2n \text{ pounds}
   \]

   Since a bag of chicken feed weighs 20 pounds and costs $2, we first need to determine how many bags of feed are required for \( 2n \) pounds. The number of bags needed is:
   \[
   \text{Number of Bags} = \frac{2n}{20} = \frac{n}{10}
   \]

   The cost of the feed can then be calculated as:
   \[
   \text{Cost of Feed} = 2 \times \text{Number of Bags} = 2 \times \frac{n}{10} = \frac{n}{5}
   \]

4. **Calculating Profit**: 
   The profit can be expressed as:
   \[
   \text{Profit} = \text{Total Revenue} - \text{Cost of Feed}
   \]
   Substituting the expressions we derived:
   \[
   65 = 1.50n - \frac{n}{5}
   \]

5. **Combining Terms**: 
   To combine the terms on the right side, we need a common denominator. The common denominator for 1.50 (which is \( \frac{3}{2} \)) and \( \frac{n}{5} \) is 10. We can rewrite \( 1.50n \) as:
   \[
   1.50n = \frac{3}{2}n = \frac{15}{10}n
   \]
   Now we can rewrite the equation:
   \[
   65 = \frac{15}{10}n - \frac{2}{10}n
   \]
   This simplifies to:
   \[
   65 = \frac{15n - 2n}{10} = \frac{13n}{10}
   \]

6. **Solving for \( n \)**: 
   To eliminate the fraction, we multiply both sides by 10:
   \[
   650 = 13n
   \]
   Now, divide both sides by 13:
   \[
   n = \frac{650}{13} = 50
   \]

7. **Final Answer**: 
   Lao sold **50 chickens**.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{50}
\]
