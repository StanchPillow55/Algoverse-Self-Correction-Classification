==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine how many chickens Lao sold to make a $65 profit. Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Step 1: Determine the Cost of Feeding Each Chicken
Each chicken requires 2 pounds of feed. A bag of chicken feed weighs 20 pounds and costs $2. Therefore, the cost per pound of feed is:

\[
\text{Cost per pound of feed} = \frac{\$2}{20 \text{ pounds}} = \$0.10 \text{ per pound}
\]

Since each chicken needs 2 pounds of feed, the cost to feed one chicken is:

\[
\text{Cost to feed one chicken} = 2 \text{ pounds} \times \$0.10/\text{pound} = \$0.20
\]

### Step 2: Determine the Revenue from Selling Each Chicken
Lao sells each chicken for $1.50. Therefore, the revenue from selling one chicken is:

\[
\text{Revenue per chicken} = \$1.50
\]

### Step 3: Determine the Profit from Selling Each Chicken
The profit from selling one chicken is the revenue minus the cost of feeding it:

\[
\text{Profit per chicken} = \text{Revenue per chicken} - \text{Cost to feed one chicken} = \$1.50 - \$0.20 = \$1.30
\]

### Step 4: Determine How Many Chickens Were Sold for a $65 Profit
Lao's total profit is $65. We need to find out how many chickens he sold to achieve this profit. Let \( x \) be the number of chickens sold. The total profit from selling \( x \) chickens is:

\[
\text{Total profit} = x \times \text{Profit per chicken} = x \times \$1.30
\]

We set this equal to the total profit of $65:

\[
x \times \$1.30 = \$65
\]

To find \( x \), divide both sides by $1.30:

\[
x = \frac{\$65}{\$1.30} = 50
\]

### Conclusion
Lao sold 50 chickens to make a $65 profit. Therefore, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{50}
\]
