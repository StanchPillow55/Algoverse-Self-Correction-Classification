Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of oranges Sitti and Juris have.**
   - Sitti has 34 oranges.
   - Juris has 22 oranges.
   - Total oranges = Sitti's oranges + Juris's oranges
   \[
   \text{Total oranges} = 34 + 22 = 56
   \]

2. **Determine how many people will share the oranges.**
   - Sitti and Juris are sharing the oranges with their 6 other friends.
   - This means there are a total of:
   \[
   \text{Total people} = 2 \text{ (Sitti and Juris)} + 6 \text{ (friends)} = 8 \text{ people}
   \]

3. **Calculate how many oranges each person will get.**
   - To find out how many oranges each person gets, we divide the total number of oranges by the total number of people:
   \[
   \text{Oranges per person} = \frac{\text{Total oranges}}{\text{Total people}} = \frac{56}{8}
   \]
   - Performing the division:
   \[
   \text{Oranges per person} = 7
   \]

4. **State the final answer.**
   - Each person will receive 7 oranges.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\text{Each person gets } 7 \text{ oranges.}
\]
