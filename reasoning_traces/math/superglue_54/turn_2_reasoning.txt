==================================================

To solve the problem effectively, I need to first understand the context and details of "Sample reasoning question 54." However, since the specific content of the question isn't provided, I'll demonstrate a general approach to solving a typical math reasoning problem. 

Let's assume "Sample reasoning question 54" involves a common type of math problem, such as solving an algebraic equation, analyzing a geometric figure, or working through a word problem. I'll create a hypothetical problem and solve it step by step.

### Hypothetical Problem:
**Question:** A rectangle has a length that is twice its width. If the perimeter of the rectangle is 36 units, what are the dimensions of the rectangle?

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We have a rectangle with a length (L) and a width (W).
   - The length is twice the width: \( L = 2W \).
   - The perimeter of the rectangle is 36 units.

2. **Recall the Formula for Perimeter:**
   - The perimeter (P) of a rectangle is given by the formula: 
     \[
     P = 2L + 2W
     \]

3. **Substitute Known Values:**
   - Substitute \( L = 2W \) into the perimeter formula:
     \[
     36 = 2(2W) + 2W
     \]

4. **Simplify the Equation:**
   - Simplify the expression:
     \[
     36 = 4W + 2W
     \]
     \[
     36 = 6W
     \]

5. **Solve for W (Width):**
   - Divide both sides by 6 to solve for W:
     \[
     W = \frac{36}{6} = 6
     \]

6. **Find L (Length):**
   - Use the relationship \( L = 2W \) to find the length:
     \[
     L = 2 \times 6 = 12
     \]

7. **Verify the Solution:**
   - Check the perimeter with the found dimensions:
     \[
     P = 2L + 2W = 2(12) + 2(6) = 24 + 12 = 36
     \]
   - The calculated perimeter matches the given perimeter, confirming the solution is correct.

### Final Answer:
The dimensions of the rectangle are:
- Width (W) = 6 units
- Length (L) = 12 units

This approach demonstrates a structured method to solve a math reasoning problem by understanding the problem, applying relevant formulas, substituting known values, solving the equations, and verifying the solution.
