Question ID: superglue_54
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, I'll need more specific information or details about "Sample reasoning question 54." Since the question isn't provided, I'll demonstrate how to approach a typical math reasoning problem by creating a hypothetical example.

**Hypothetical Problem:**

A train travels from City A to City B, a distance of 300 miles. The train travels at a constant speed of 60 miles per hour. How long does the journey take?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We need to find the time it takes for the train to travel from City A to City B.
   - We know the distance is 300 miles and the speed is 60 miles per hour.

2. **Identify the Formula:**
   - The formula to find time when distance and speed are known is:
     \[
     \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}}
     \]

3. **Substitute the Known Values:**
   - Distance = 300 miles
   - Speed = 60 miles per hour
   - Substitute these values into the formula:
     \[
     \text{Time} = \frac{300 \text{ miles}}{60 \text{ miles per hour}}
     \]

4. **Perform the Calculation:**
   - Divide 300 by 60:
     \[
     \text{Time} = \frac{300}{60} = 5 \text{ hours}
     \]

5. **Verify the Solution:**
   - To ensure the calculation is correct, consider the units:
     - Miles cancel out, leaving hours as the unit for time, which is appropriate.
   - Recalculate to double-check:
     \[
     60 \times 5 = 300 \text{ miles}
     \]
   - The calculation checks out, confirming the solution is correct.

6. **State the Final Answer:**
   - The journey takes 5 hours.

This is a complete step-by-step solution to the hypothetical problem. If you have a specific problem or additional details for "Sample reasoning question 54," please provide them, and I'll be happy to assist further!
