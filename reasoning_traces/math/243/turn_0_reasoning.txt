To determine how many hours Mckenna stays at work, we need to break down her schedule and calculate the total time spent at each activity.

1. **Morning Office Work:**
   - Mckenna starts her day at 8:00 a.m. and works in her office until 11:00 a.m.
   - To find the duration of this period, we subtract the start time from the end time:
     \[
     11:00 \, \text{a.m.} - 8:00 \, \text{a.m.} = 3 \, \text{hours}
     \]
   - Therefore, Mckenna works in her office for 3 hours in the morning.

2. **Conference Room Meeting:**
   - After working in her office, Mckenna joins her team in the conference room from 11:00 a.m. to 1:00 p.m. (13:00).
   - To find the duration of this meeting, we subtract the start time from the end time:
     \[
     13:00 - 11:00 = 2 \, \text{hours}
     \]
   - Thus, the meeting lasts for 2 hours.

3. **Afternoon Work:**
   - After the meeting, Mckenna works for another two hours before heading home.
   - This is explicitly stated as 2 hours of work.

Now, we add up all the hours Mckenna spends at work:

- Morning office work: 3 hours
- Conference room meeting: 2 hours
- Afternoon work: 2 hours

The total time Mckenna stays at work is the sum of these durations:
\[
3 \, \text{hours} + 2 \, \text{hours} + 2 \, \text{hours} = 7 \, \text{hours}
\]

Therefore, Mckenna stays at work for a total of 7 hours.

**Final Answer: 7 hours**
