To determine how many minutes Jason has left for the month, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total minutes used for daily calls with his boss.**
   - Jason has a 15-minute call with his boss every day.
   - The month has 30 days.
   - Total minutes used for calls with his boss = 15 minutes/day Ã— 30 days = 450 minutes.

2. **Add the extra minutes used for calls to other people.**
   - Jason has used an additional 300 minutes for calls to other people.
   - Total minutes used = Minutes for boss + Extra minutes = 450 minutes + 300 minutes = 750 minutes.

3. **Determine the total minutes available in his phone plan.**
   - Jason's phone plan allows for 1000 minutes per month.

4. **Calculate the remaining minutes.**
   - Remaining minutes = Total minutes in plan - Total minutes used = 1000 minutes - 750 minutes = 250 minutes.

Now, let's summarize the calculations:

- Total minutes used for calls with boss: 450 minutes
- Total extra minutes used: 300 minutes
- Total minutes used: 450 + 300 = 750 minutes
- Total minutes in plan: 1000 minutes
- Remaining minutes: 1000 - 750 = 250 minutes

Thus, the final answer is:

**Jason has 250 minutes left for the month.**
