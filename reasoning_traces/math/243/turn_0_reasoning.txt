To determine how many hours Mckenna stays at work, we will break down her schedule step by step.

1. **Morning Work Hours**:
   - Mckenna starts her day at 8:00 a.m. and works until 11:00 a.m.
   - To find the duration of this work period, we calculate the time from 8:00 a.m. to 11:00 a.m.
   - The calculation is:
     \[
     11:00 \text{ a.m.} - 8:00 \text{ a.m.} = 3 \text{ hours}
     \]
   - So, Mckenna works for **3 hours** in the morning.

2. **Team Meeting**:
   - After working in her office, Mckenna joins her team at 11:00 a.m. and talks about projects until 1:00 p.m.
   - We calculate the duration of this meeting:
     \[
     1:00 \text{ p.m.} - 11:00 \text{ a.m.} = 2 \text{ hours}
     \]
   - Thus, Mckenna spends **2 hours** in the team meeting.

3. **Afternoon Work Hours**:
   - After the meeting, Mckenna works for another 2 hours.
   - We need to determine when she starts this work. Since the meeting ends at 1:00 p.m., she starts working again at that time.
   - The calculation for her work duration is:
     \[
     1:00 \text{ p.m.} + 2 \text{ hours} = 3:00 \text{ p.m.}
     \]
   - Therefore, she works for **2 hours** in the afternoon.

4. **Total Hours at Work**:
   - Now, we sum all the hours Mckenna spent at work:
     \[
     \text{Morning Work} + \text{Team Meeting} + \text{Afternoon Work} = 3 \text{ hours} + 2 \text{ hours} + 2 \text{ hours}
     \]
   - Performing the addition:
     \[
     3 + 2 + 2 = 7 \text{ hours}
     \]

Thus, Mckenna stays at work for a total of **7 hours**.

Final answer: **7 hours**.
