==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 107" entails. Since the problem statement is not provided, I'll demonstrate a general approach to solving a hypothetical math problem. Let's assume the problem involves solving a quadratic equation, as this is a common type of math problem.

### Problem:
Solve the quadratic equation: \(2x^2 - 4x - 6 = 0\).

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Identify the Standard Form**:
   A quadratic equation is typically in the form \(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\). Here, \(a = 2\), \(b = -4\), and \(c = -6\).

2. **Calculate the Discriminant**:
   The discriminant (\(\Delta\)) of a quadratic equation \(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\) is given by the formula:
   \[
   \Delta = b^2 - 4ac
   \]
   Substituting the values from our equation:
   \[
   \Delta = (-4)^2 - 4 \times 2 \times (-6) = 16 + 48 = 64
   \]

3. **Determine the Nature of the Roots**:
   Since the discriminant is positive (\(\Delta = 64\)), the quadratic equation has two distinct real roots.

4. **Use the Quadratic Formula**:
   The roots of the quadratic equation can be found using the quadratic formula:
   \[
   x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{\Delta}}{2a}
   \]
   Substituting the known values:
   \[
   x = \frac{-(-4) \pm \sqrt{64}}{2 \times 2} = \frac{4 \pm 8}{4}
   \]

5. **Calculate the Roots**:
   - First root:
     \[
     x_1 = \frac{4 + 8}{4} = \frac{12}{4} = 3
     \]
   - Second root:
     \[
     x_2 = \frac{4 - 8}{4} = \frac{-4}{4} = -1
     \]

### Final Answer:
The solutions to the quadratic equation \(2x^2 - 4x - 6 = 0\) are \(x = 3\) and \(x = -1\).

This step-by-step approach demonstrates how to solve a quadratic equation using the quadratic formula, ensuring all calculations and reasoning are clearly shown.
