==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to understand what "Sample reasoning question 107" entails. Since the problem statement is not specific, I'll assume it's a hypothetical math problem. Let's create a sample math problem and solve it step by step.

**Sample Problem:**
A store sells apples at $2 each and oranges at $3 each. If a customer buys a total of 10 fruits consisting of apples and oranges and spends $25, how many apples and how many oranges did the customer buy?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( a \) be the number of apples.
   - Let \( o \) be the number of oranges.

2. **Set Up Equations:**
   - The total number of fruits is 10: 
     \[
     a + o = 10
     \]
   - The total cost is $25:
     \[
     2a + 3o = 25
     \]

3. **Solve the System of Equations:**

   We have the system:
   \[
   \begin{align*}
   a + o &= 10 \quad \text{(Equation 1)} \\
   2a + 3o &= 25 \quad \text{(Equation 2)}
   \end{align*}
   \]

   **Substitution Method:**

   From Equation 1, express \( a \) in terms of \( o \):
   \[
   a = 10 - o
   \]

   Substitute \( a = 10 - o \) into Equation 2:
   \[
   2(10 - o) + 3o = 25
   \]

   Simplify and solve for \( o \):
   \[
   20 - 2o + 3o = 25
   \]
   \[
   20 + o = 25
   \]
   \[
   o = 25 - 20
   \]
   \[
   o = 5
   \]

   Substitute \( o = 5 \) back into Equation 1 to find \( a \):
   \[
   a + 5 = 10
   \]
   \[
   a = 10 - 5
   \]
   \[
   a = 5
   \]

4. **Verify the Solution:**

   Check the solution in both equations:
   - Equation 1: \( a + o = 5 + 5 = 10 \) (True)
   - Equation 2: \( 2a + 3o = 2(5) + 3(5) = 10 + 15 = 25 \) (True)

Both equations are satisfied, confirming our solution is correct.

**Final Answer:**
The customer bought 5 apples and 5 oranges.
