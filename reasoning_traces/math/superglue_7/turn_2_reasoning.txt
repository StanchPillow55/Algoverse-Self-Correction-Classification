==================================================

To solve the problem effectively, I'll need more specific information about "Sample reasoning question 7" as it appears to be a placeholder or reference to a specific problem that isn't provided here. However, I can guide you through a general approach to solving a reasoning-based math problem by outlining the steps typically involved:

### Step-by-Step Approach:

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - Carefully read the problem statement to identify what is being asked.
   - Determine the type of problem (e.g., algebra, geometry, probability).

2. **Identify Known and Unknown Variables:**
   - List out the information given in the problem.
   - Identify what you need to find or solve for.

3. **Develop a Plan:**
   - Consider different strategies to tackle the problem (e.g., drawing a diagram, creating an equation, using logical reasoning).
   - Choose the most efficient method based on the problem type.

4. **Execute the Plan:**
   - Carry out the calculations or logical steps needed to solve the problem.
   - Ensure each step follows logically from the previous one.

5. **Check Your Work:**
   - Verify each step to ensure there are no errors.
   - Confirm that the solution answers the question posed in the problem.

6. **State the Final Answer:**
   - Clearly present the final answer, ensuring it is in the correct form or units as required by the problem.

### Example Problem:

Let's consider a hypothetical reasoning problem:

**Problem:** A train travels from City A to City B at a speed of 60 km/h and returns at a speed of 40 km/h. What is the average speed for the entire journey?

**Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We need to find the average speed for the round trip.

2. **Identify Known and Unknown Variables:**
   - Speed from A to B = 60 km/h
   - Speed from B to A = 40 km/h
   - Distance (d) is the same for both trips, but not given.

3. **Develop a Plan:**
   - Use the formula for average speed: 
     \[
     \text{Average Speed} = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Total Time}}
     \]

4. **Execute the Plan:**
   - Let the distance from A to B (and B to A) be \( d \).
   - Time from A to B = \( \frac{d}{60} \) hours
   - Time from B to A = \( \frac{d}{40} \) hours
   - Total distance = \( 2d \)
   - Total time = \( \frac{d}{60} + \frac{d}{40} \)
   - Find a common denominator for the time calculation:
     \[
     \frac{d}{60} + \frac{d}{40} = \frac{2d}{120} + \frac{3d}{120} = \frac{5d}{120} = \frac{d}{24}
     \]
   - Average speed = 
     \[
     \frac{2d}{\frac{d}{24}} = 2d \times \frac{24}{d} = 48 \text{ km/h}
     \]

5. **Check Your Work:**
   - Ensure calculations are correct and logical.
   - Verify that the units and method are appropriate.

6. **State the Final Answer:**
   - The average speed for the entire journey is 48 km/h.
