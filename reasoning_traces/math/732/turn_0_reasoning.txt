To solve the problem, we need to determine the ages of Dora, her father, and her mother based on the information provided.

1. **Identify Dora's Age**:
   - We know that Dora is 15 years old.

2. **Calculate Dora's Father's Age**:
   - According to the problem, Dora's father's age is eight more than twice Dora's age.
   - We can express this mathematically as:
     \[
     \text{Father's Age} = 2 \times \text{Dora's Age} + 8
     \]
   - Substituting Dora's age into the equation:
     \[
     \text{Father's Age} = 2 \times 15 + 8
     \]
   - Calculating this step-by-step:
     \[
     2 \times 15 = 30
     \]
     \[
     30 + 8 = 38
     \]
   - Therefore, Dora's father is 38 years old.

3. **Calculate Dora's Mother's Age**:
   - The problem states that Dora's mother is four years younger than Dora's father.
   - We can express this mathematically as:
     \[
     \text{Mother's Age} = \text{Father's Age} - 4
     \]
   - Substituting the father's age into the equation:
     \[
     \text{Mother's Age} = 38 - 4
     \]
   - Calculating this:
     \[
     38 - 4 = 34
     \]
   - Therefore, Dora's mother is 34 years old.

4. **Calculate the Total Combined Age**:
   - Now we need to find the total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother:
     \[
     \text{Total Age} = \text{Dora's Age} + \text{Father's Age} + \text{Mother's Age}
     \]
   - Substituting the ages we found:
     \[
     \text{Total Age} = 15 + 38 + 34
     \]
   - Calculating this step-by-step:
     \[
     15 + 38 = 53
     \]
     \[
     53 + 34 = 87
     \]
   - Therefore, the total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother is 87 years.

5. **Final Answer**:
   - The total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother is **87 years**.
