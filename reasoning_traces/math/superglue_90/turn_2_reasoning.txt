==================================================

To solve the problem effectively, let's first understand what "Sample reasoning question 90" might entail. Since the problem statement is not explicitly given, I'll create a hypothetical reasoning problem and solve it step by step. 

Let's assume the problem is as follows:

**Problem:**
A company has three departments: A, B, and C. The total number of employees in the company is 90. Department A has 10 more employees than Department B, and Department C has twice as many employees as Department A. How many employees are there in each department?

**Solution:**

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( x \) be the number of employees in Department B.
   - Then, Department A has \( x + 10 \) employees.
   - Department C has \( 2(x + 10) \) employees.

2. **Set Up the Equation:**
   The total number of employees in the company is 90. Therefore, we can write the equation:
   \[
   x + (x + 10) + 2(x + 10) = 90
   \]

3. **Simplify the Equation:**
   \[
   x + x + 10 + 2x + 20 = 90
   \]
   \[
   4x + 30 = 90
   \]

4. **Solve for \( x \):**
   Subtract 30 from both sides:
   \[
   4x = 60
   \]
   Divide both sides by 4:
   \[
   x = 15
   \]

5. **Find the Number of Employees in Each Department:**
   - Department B has \( x = 15 \) employees.
   - Department A has \( x + 10 = 15 + 10 = 25 \) employees.
   - Department C has \( 2(x + 10) = 2 \times 25 = 50 \) employees.

6. **Verify the Solution:**
   Check if the total number of employees adds up to 90:
   \[
   15 + 25 + 50 = 90
   \]
   The calculation is correct.

**Final Answer:**
- Department A has 25 employees.
- Department B has 15 employees.
- Department C has 50 employees.
