Question ID: superglue_90
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 90" refers to. Since the problem statement is not specific and doesn't provide any details about the question itself, we need to make some assumptions or ask for clarification. However, given the instruction "devils_advocate_v1," let's assume this is a hypothetical or abstract problem that requires us to demonstrate reasoning skills rather than solve a specific mathematical question.

In this context, let's consider a generic reasoning problem and demonstrate how we would approach solving it step by step. We'll create a sample problem for demonstration purposes:

**Sample Problem:**
A train travels from City A to City B, a distance of 300 miles. The train travels at a constant speed of 60 miles per hour. How long does it take for the train to reach City B from City A?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Identify the Given Information:**
   - Distance from City A to City B: 300 miles
   - Speed of the train: 60 miles per hour

2. **Determine What is Being Asked:**
   - We need to find the time it takes for the train to travel from City A to City B.

3. **Recall the Relevant Formula:**
   - The formula to calculate time when distance and speed are known is:
     \[
     \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}}
     \]

4. **Substitute the Given Values into the Formula:**
   - Using the formula, we substitute the given values:
     \[
     \text{Time} = \frac{300 \text{ miles}}{60 \text{ miles per hour}}
     \]

5. **Perform the Calculation:**
   - Divide 300 by 60:
     \[
     \text{Time} = \frac{300}{60} = 5 \text{ hours}
     \]

6. **Verify the Solution:**
   - To ensure the calculation is correct, we can check by multiplying the time by the speed to see if we get the original distance:
     \[
     5 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ miles per hour} = 300 \text{ miles}
     \]
   - The calculation checks out, confirming our solution is correct.

7. **State the Final Answer:**
   - The train takes 5 hours to travel from City A to City B.

By following these steps, we have demonstrated a clear and logical approach to solving a reasoning problem involving distance, speed, and time. This method can be applied to similar problems by identifying the relevant information, using appropriate formulas, performing calculations, and verifying the results.
