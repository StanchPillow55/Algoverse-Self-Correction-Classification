==================================================

It seems like the question "Sample reasoning question 90" is not fully clear or specific. To provide a complete solution, I need more details or context about the problem. However, I can guide you through a general approach to solving math problems by reasoning through a hypothetical example. Let's assume a sample math problem and solve it step by step.

### Sample Problem:
**Problem:** If a car travels at a constant speed of 60 miles per hour, how long will it take to travel 180 miles?

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We need to find the time it takes for a car to travel 180 miles at a constant speed of 60 miles per hour.

2. **Identify the Formula:**
   - The formula to calculate time when distance and speed are known is:
     \[
     \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}}
     \]

3. **Substitute the Given Values:**
   - Distance = 180 miles
   - Speed = 60 miles per hour
   - Substitute these values into the formula:
     \[
     \text{Time} = \frac{180 \text{ miles}}{60 \text{ miles per hour}}
     \]

4. **Perform the Calculation:**
   - Divide 180 by 60:
     \[
     \text{Time} = \frac{180}{60} = 3 \text{ hours}
     \]

5. **Verify the Solution:**
   - To ensure the solution is correct, check the units and the logic:
     - The units of miles cancel out, leaving hours, which is the correct unit for time.
     - The calculation logically follows from the formula and given values.

6. **State the Final Answer:**
   - It will take the car 3 hours to travel 180 miles at a constant speed of 60 miles per hour.

### Conclusion:
By following these steps, we have solved the problem using clear reasoning and calculations. If you have a specific problem or need further assistance, please provide more details, and I'll be happy to help!
