Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 90" refers to. Since the problem doesn't provide specific details or context, I'll assume it's a hypothetical reasoning question that requires logical thinking and mathematical problem-solving skills.

Let's break down the process of solving a typical reasoning question:

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - Without specific details, let's assume this is a numerical reasoning question involving basic arithmetic or algebra.

2. **Identify Known Information:**
   - Since no specific numbers or equations are given, let's create a hypothetical scenario. For example, let's assume the problem involves finding the value of \( x \) in a simple equation.

3. **Formulate the Equation:**
   - Suppose the problem is: "If 3 times a number plus 5 equals 20, what is the number?"
   - In mathematical terms, this can be written as: \( 3x + 5 = 20 \).

4. **Solve the Equation:**
   - To find \( x \), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation.
   - Start by subtracting 5 from both sides: 
     \[
     3x + 5 - 5 = 20 - 5
     \]
     \[
     3x = 15
     \]
   - Next, divide both sides by 3 to solve for \( x \):
     \[
     \frac{3x}{3} = \frac{15}{3}
     \]
     \[
     x = 5
     \]

5. **Verify the Solution:**
   - Substitute \( x = 5 \) back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies the condition:
     \[
     3(5) + 5 = 15 + 5 = 20
     \]
   - Since both sides of the equation are equal, \( x = 5 \) is indeed the correct solution.

6. **State the Final Answer:**
   - The number is \( x = 5 \).

Since the original problem statement was vague, this example demonstrates a typical approach to solving a reasoning question involving basic algebra. If "Sample reasoning question 90" refers to a specific problem, please provide additional details for a more accurate solution.
