==================================================

To solve the problem labeled "Sample reasoning question 90," we need to first understand what the problem is asking. However, the problem statement provided is incomplete, as it only states "Sample reasoning question 90" without any specific details or numbers to work with.

In the absence of a specific problem, let's consider a hypothetical reasoning problem that involves mathematical calculations. I'll create a sample problem and solve it step by step.

**Sample Problem:**

A train travels from City A to City B, a distance of 180 miles. The train travels at a constant speed of 60 miles per hour. After reaching City B, the train immediately returns to City A at a speed of 90 miles per hour. What is the average speed of the train for the entire round trip?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Determine the time taken for each leg of the trip:**

   - **From City A to City B:**
     \[
     \text{Distance} = 180 \text{ miles}, \quad \text{Speed} = 60 \text{ miles per hour}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{180}{60} = 3 \text{ hours}
     \]

   - **From City B to City A:**
     \[
     \text{Distance} = 180 \text{ miles}, \quad \text{Speed} = 90 \text{ miles per hour}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{180}{90} = 2 \text{ hours}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total time for the round trip:**

   \[
   \text{Total Time} = 3 \text{ hours} + 2 \text{ hours} = 5 \text{ hours}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total distance for the round trip:**

   \[
   \text{Total Distance} = 180 \text{ miles} + 180 \text{ miles} = 360 \text{ miles}
   \]

4. **Calculate the average speed for the round trip:**

   The average speed is given by the total distance divided by the total time:
   \[
   \text{Average Speed} = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Total Time}} = \frac{360 \text{ miles}}{5 \text{ hours}} = 72 \text{ miles per hour}
   \]

**Final Answer:**

The average speed of the train for the entire round trip is 72 miles per hour.
