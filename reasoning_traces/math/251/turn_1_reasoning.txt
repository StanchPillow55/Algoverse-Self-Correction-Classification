To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total revenue the bakery makes from selling the pies and then subtract the total cost of making those pies to find the profit.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of pie pieces produced in one hour.**

- Each pie is divided into 3 pieces.
- The bakery can make 12 pies in one hour.

\[ \text{Total number of pieces} = 12 \text{ pies} \times 3 \text{ pieces per pie} = 36 \text{ pieces} \]

**Step 2: Calculate the total revenue from selling the pie pieces.**

- Each piece of pie is sold for $4.

\[ \text{Total revenue} = 36 \text{ pieces} \times \$4 \text{ per piece} = \$144 \]

**Step 3: Calculate the total cost of making the pies.**

- The cost to create one pie is $0.5.
- The bakery makes 12 pies in one hour.

\[ \text{Total cost} = 12 \text{ pies} \times \$0.5 \text{ per pie} = \$6 \]

**Step 4: Calculate the profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue.**

\[ \text{Profit} = \text{Total revenue} - \text{Total cost} = \$144 - \$6 = \$138 \]

Therefore, the bakery would make a profit of $138 in one hour if it sells all the pie pieces.

**Final Answer: The bakery would make $138 in profit.**
