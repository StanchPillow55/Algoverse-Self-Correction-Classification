==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine the total revenue the bakery makes from selling the pies and then subtract the total cost of creating the pies to find the profit.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Determine the Revenue from Selling Pies:**

   - Each pie is divided into 3 pieces.
   - Each piece is sold for $4.
   - Therefore, the revenue from selling one pie is:
     \[
     \text{Revenue per pie} = 3 \text{ pieces} \times \$4/\text{piece} = \$12/\text{pie}
     \]

2. **Calculate the Total Revenue for One Hour:**

   - The bakery can make 12 pies in one hour.
   - Therefore, the total revenue from selling all the pies made in one hour is:
     \[
     \text{Total Revenue} = 12 \text{ pies} \times \$12/\text{pie} = \$144
     \]

3. **Determine the Cost of Creating Pies:**

   - The cost to create one pie is $0.5.
   - Therefore, the total cost to create 12 pies is:
     \[
     \text{Total Cost} = 12 \text{ pies} \times \$0.5/\text{pie} = \$6
     \]

4. **Calculate the Profit:**

   - Profit is calculated by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue.
   - Therefore, the profit is:
     \[
     \text{Profit} = \text{Total Revenue} - \text{Total Cost} = \$144 - \$6 = \$138
     \]

### Final Answer:

The bakery would make a profit of \$138 in one hour by selling all the pie pieces.
