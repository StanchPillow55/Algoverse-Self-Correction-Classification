To solve the problem, we need to calculate the total revenue the bakery makes from selling the pie pieces and then subtract the costs to find the profit.

### Step 1: Calculate the total number of pieces produced in one hour.

Each pie has 3 pieces, and the bakery can make 12 pies in one hour.

\[
\text{Total pieces} = \text{Number of pies} \times \text{Pieces per pie}
\]
\[
\text{Total pieces} = 12 \text{ pies} \times 3 \text{ pieces/pie} = 36 \text{ pieces}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the total revenue from selling the pieces.

Each piece is sold for $4. Therefore, the total revenue from selling all the pieces is:

\[
\text{Total revenue} = \text{Total pieces} \times \text{Price per piece}
\]
\[
\text{Total revenue} = 36 \text{ pieces} \times 4 \text{ dollars/piece} = 144 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the total cost of producing the pies.

The cost to create one pie is $0.5. Therefore, the total cost for making 12 pies is:

\[
\text{Total cost} = \text{Number of pies} \times \text{Cost per pie}
\]
\[
\text{Total cost} = 12 \text{ pies} \times 0.5 \text{ dollars/pie} = 6 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the profit.

Profit is calculated by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue:

\[
\text{Profit} = \text{Total revenue} - \text{Total cost}
\]
\[
\text{Profit} = 144 \text{ dollars} - 6 \text{ dollars} = 138 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Final Answer

The bakery would make a profit of **$138**.
