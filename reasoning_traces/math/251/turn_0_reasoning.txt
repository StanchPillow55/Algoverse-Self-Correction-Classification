To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total revenue the bakery makes from selling the pie pieces and then subtract the cost of making the pies to find the net profit.

### Step 1: Calculate the Total Revenue

1. **Determine the number of pie pieces sold in one hour:**
   - Each pie has 3 pieces.
   - The bakery makes 12 pies in one hour.
   - Therefore, the total number of pie pieces made in one hour is:
     \[
     12 \text{ pies} \times 3 \text{ pieces per pie} = 36 \text{ pieces}
     \]

2. **Calculate the revenue from selling these pieces:**
   - Each piece is sold for $4.
   - Therefore, the total revenue from selling 36 pieces is:
     \[
     36 \text{ pieces} \times 4 \text{ dollars per piece} = 144 \text{ dollars}
     \]

### Step 2: Calculate the Total Cost

1. **Determine the cost of making 12 pies:**
   - The cost to make one pie is $0.5.
   - Therefore, the total cost to make 12 pies is:
     \[
     12 \text{ pies} \times 0.5 \text{ dollars per pie} = 6 \text{ dollars}
     \]

### Step 3: Calculate the Net Profit

1. **Subtract the total cost from the total revenue to find the net profit:**
   \[
   \text{Net Profit} = \text{Total Revenue} - \text{Total Cost} = 144 \text{ dollars} - 6 \text{ dollars} = 138 \text{ dollars}
   \]

### Final Answer

The bakery would make a net profit of $138 in one hour by selling all the pie pieces.
