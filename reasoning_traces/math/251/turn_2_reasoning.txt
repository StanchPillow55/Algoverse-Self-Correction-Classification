Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine the total revenue the bakery makes from selling the pies and then subtract the total cost of making those pies to find the profit.

### Step 1: Determine the Total Revenue

1. **Number of Pies Made in One Hour:**
   - The bakery can make 12 pies in one hour.

2. **Number of Pieces per Pie:**
   - Each pie is divided into 3 pieces.

3. **Total Number of Pieces Made in One Hour:**
   \[
   \text{Total pieces} = 12 \text{ pies} \times 3 \text{ pieces per pie} = 36 \text{ pieces}
   \]

4. **Price per Piece:**
   - Each piece is sold for $4.

5. **Total Revenue from Selling All Pieces:**
   \[
   \text{Total revenue} = 36 \text{ pieces} \times \$4 \text{ per piece} = \$144
   \]

### Step 2: Determine the Total Cost

1. **Cost to Make One Pie:**
   - It costs the bakery $0.5 to make one pie.

2. **Total Cost to Make 12 Pies:**
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = 12 \text{ pies} \times \$0.5 \text{ per pie} = \$6
   \]

### Step 3: Calculate the Profit

1. **Profit Calculation:**
   \[
   \text{Profit} = \text{Total revenue} - \text{Total cost} = \$144 - \$6 = \$138
   \]

### Conclusion

The bakery would make a profit of $138 in one hour if it sells all the pie pieces.

**Final Answer:**
The bakery would make $138 in profit.
