==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total revenue the bakery makes from selling the pie pieces and then subtract the total cost of making the pies to find the net profit.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Determine the number of pie pieces produced in one hour:**

   - Each pie is divided into 3 pieces.
   - The bakery makes 12 pies in one hour.

   \[
   \text{Total pieces in one hour} = 12 \text{ pies} \times 3 \text{ pieces per pie} = 36 \text{ pieces}
   \]

2. **Calculate the total revenue from selling the pie pieces:**

   - Each piece is sold for $4.

   \[
   \text{Total revenue} = 36 \text{ pieces} \times \$4 \text{ per piece} = \$144
   \]

3. **Calculate the total cost of making the pies:**

   - The cost to make one pie is $0.5.
   - The bakery makes 12 pies in one hour.

   \[
   \text{Total cost} = 12 \text{ pies} \times \$0.5 \text{ per pie} = \$6
   \]

4. **Calculate the net profit:**

   - Net profit is the total revenue minus the total cost.

   \[
   \text{Net profit} = \$144 \text{ (total revenue)} - \$6 \text{ (total cost)} = \$138
   \]

### Final Answer:

The bakery would make a net profit of \$138 in one hour by selling all the pie pieces.
