==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 498," we need to first understand what the problem is asking. However, the problem statement "Sample math problem 498" is not specific and does not provide any details or context about what needs to be solved. Therefore, I will assume that "498" is a number that we need to perform some mathematical operations on. 

Let's explore a few possibilities of what a typical math problem involving the number 498 might entail:

### Possibility 1: Basic Arithmetic Operations
Let's perform some basic arithmetic operations on the number 498.

1. **Addition**: Add 2 to 498.
   \[
   498 + 2 = 500
   \]

2. **Subtraction**: Subtract 2 from 498.
   \[
   498 - 2 = 496
   \]

3. **Multiplication**: Multiply 498 by 2.
   \[
   498 \times 2 = 996
   \]

4. **Division**: Divide 498 by 2.
   \[
   498 \div 2 = 249
   \]

### Possibility 2: Prime Factorization
Let's find the prime factorization of 498.

1. Check divisibility by 2 (since 498 is even):
   \[
   498 \div 2 = 249
   \]

2. Check divisibility of 249 by 3 (sum of digits \(2 + 4 + 9 = 15\), which is divisible by 3):
   \[
   249 \div 3 = 83
   \]

3. Check if 83 is a prime number. It is not divisible by 2, 3, 5, or 7 (since \( \sqrt{83} \approx 9.11\)).

Thus, the prime factorization of 498 is:
\[
498 = 2 \times 3 \times 83
\]

### Possibility 3: Solving an Equation
Suppose we have an equation involving 498, such as solving for \( x \) in the equation \( x + 498 = 1000 \).

1. Subtract 498 from both sides:
   \[
   x + 498 - 498 = 1000 - 498
   \]
   \[
   x = 502
   \]

### Conclusion
Since the problem statement "Sample math problem 498" is not specific, I have explored a few different mathematical operations and scenarios involving the number 498. Without additional context or details, these are some reasonable interpretations of what the problem might involve.

If you have a specific question or context in mind for "Sample math problem 498," please provide more details, and I would be happy to help further.
