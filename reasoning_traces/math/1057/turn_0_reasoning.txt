To solve the problem, we need to determine how many movies Jill and her friends watch over the course of 4 weekends.

1. **Determine the number of movies watched on Saturday:**
   - Jill and her friends watch 4 movies every Saturday.

2. **Determine the number of movies watched on Sunday:**
   - They watch half the number of movies on Sunday than on Saturday. 
   - Since they watch 4 movies on Saturday, the number of movies watched on Sunday is:
     \[
     \text{Movies on Sunday} = \frac{4}{2} = 2
     \]

3. **Calculate the total number of movies watched in one weekend:**
   - The total number of movies watched in one weekend (Saturday + Sunday) is:
     \[
     \text{Total movies in one weekend} = \text{Movies on Saturday} + \text{Movies on Sunday} = 4 + 2 = 6
     \]

4. **Calculate the total number of movies watched in 4 weekends:**
   - Since they watch 6 movies every weekend, over 4 weekends, the total number of movies watched is:
     \[
     \text{Total movies in 4 weekends} = 6 \times 4 = 24
     \]

Thus, the total number of movies that Jill and her friends can watch in 4 weeks is \( \boxed{24} \).
