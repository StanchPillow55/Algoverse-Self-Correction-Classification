Question ID: 126
Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to determine how many roommates John has based on the information given about Bob's roommates.

1. **Identify the number of roommates Bob has**: 
   According to the problem, Bob has 10 roommates.

2. **Calculate twice the number of Bob's roommates**: 
   We need to find out what twice the number of Bob's roommates is:
   \[
   2 \times \text{(number of Bob's roommates)} = 2 \times 10 = 20
   \]

3. **Determine how many more roommates John has compared to twice Bob's roommates**: 
   The problem states that John has five more roommates than twice the number of Bob's roommates. Therefore, we add 5 to the result we calculated in the previous step:
   \[
   \text{Number of John's roommates} = 20 + 5 = 25
   \]

4. **Final answer**: 
   After performing the calculations, we find that John has 25 roommates.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\text{John has } 25 \text{ roommates.}
\]
