==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to determine the total number of sausages Dylan bought, which includes both chicken sausages and fish sausages.

1. **Identify the number of chicken sausages**:
   - According to the problem, Dylan bought 38 chicken sausages.

2. **Determine the number of fish sausages**:
   - The problem states that Dylan bought 6 more fish sausages than chicken sausages. 
   - Since he bought 38 chicken sausages, we can calculate the number of fish sausages as follows:
     \[
     \text{Number of fish sausages} = \text{Number of chicken sausages} + 6
     \]
     \[
     \text{Number of fish sausages} = 38 + 6 = 44
     \]

3. **Calculate the total number of sausages**:
   - Now that we have the number of chicken sausages (38) and the number of fish sausages (44), we can find the total number of sausages by adding these two amounts together:
     \[
     \text{Total number of sausages} = \text{Number of chicken sausages} + \text{Number of fish sausages}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total number of sausages} = 38 + 44 = 82
     \]

4. **Final answer**:
   - Therefore, the total number of sausages Dylan bought is \( \boxed{82} \).
