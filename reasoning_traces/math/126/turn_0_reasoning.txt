==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to determine how many roommates John has based on the information given about Bob's roommates.

1. **Identify the number of roommates Bob has:**
   - According to the problem, Bob has 10 roommates.

2. **Translate the relationship between John's and Bob's roommates into a mathematical expression:**
   - The problem states that John has five more roommates than twice as many as Bob.
   - Let's break this down:
     - "Twice as many as Bob" means we take the number of Bob's roommates and multiply it by 2.
     - "Five more than" means we add 5 to the result of the previous step.

3. **Formulate the expression for John's roommates:**
   - First, calculate twice the number of Bob's roommates:
     \[
     2 \times 10 = 20
     \]
   - Then, add 5 to this result to find the number of John's roommates:
     \[
     20 + 5 = 25
     \]

4. **Conclusion:**
   - John has 25 roommates.

Therefore, the final answer is that John has 25 roommates.
