==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 379" entails. Since the problem statement is not specific, I'll assume it's a generic math problem. Let's create a hypothetical problem and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**

A company produces two types of widgets: Type A and Type B. The company can produce a maximum of 100 widgets per day. The profit from selling one Type A widget is $5, and the profit from selling one Type B widget is $8. The company must produce at least 20 Type A widgets and at least 10 Type B widgets each day. How many of each type of widget should the company produce to maximize profit?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( x \) be the number of Type A widgets produced.
   - Let \( y \) be the number of Type B widgets produced.

2. **Constraints:**
   - The total number of widgets produced per day cannot exceed 100: 
     \[
     x + y \leq 100
     \]
   - At least 20 Type A widgets must be produced:
     \[
     x \geq 20
     \]
   - At least 10 Type B widgets must be produced:
     \[
     y \geq 10
     \]

3. **Objective Function:**
   - The profit function \( P \) is given by:
     \[
     P = 5x + 8y
     \]
   - We want to maximize \( P \).

4. **Graphical Solution:**
   - Plot the constraints on a graph:
     - \( x + y = 100 \)
     - \( x = 20 \)
     - \( y = 10 \)

5. **Identify Feasible Region:**
   - The feasible region is bounded by the lines \( x + y = 100 \), \( x = 20 \), and \( y = 10 \), and is in the first quadrant where both \( x \) and \( y \) are non-negative.

6. **Vertices of the Feasible Region:**
   - The intersection points (vertices) of the feasible region are:
     - \( (20, 10) \)
     - \( (20, 80) \) (from \( x = 20 \) and \( x + y = 100 \))
     - \( (90, 10) \) (from \( y = 10 \) and \( x + y = 100 \))

7. **Evaluate the Objective Function at Each Vertex:**
   - \( P(20, 10) = 5(20) + 8(10) = 100 + 80 = 180 \)
   - \( P(20, 80) = 5(20) + 8(80) = 100 + 640 = 740 \)
   - \( P(90, 10) = 5(90) + 8(10) = 450 + 80 = 530 \)

8. **Determine the Maximum Profit:**
   - The maximum profit occurs at the vertex \( (20, 80) \) with a profit of 740.

**Final Answer:**
The company should produce 20 Type A widgets and 80 Type B widgets to maximize profit, resulting in a maximum profit of $740.
