==================================================

It seems like the problem statement is incomplete or unclear. To provide a thorough solution, I need a specific math problem or question to work through. However, I can guide you on how to approach solving a math problem by explaining a general process:

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - Read the problem carefully.
   - Identify what is being asked.
   - Determine what information is given and what needs to be found.

2. **Devise a Plan:**
   - Think about the mathematical concepts that might apply.
   - Consider drawing a diagram or making a table if applicable.
   - Decide on a strategy to solve the problem (e.g., algebraic manipulation, using formulas, logical reasoning).

3. **Carry Out the Plan:**
   - Execute the steps youâ€™ve planned.
   - Perform calculations carefully.
   - Keep track of units and ensure consistency.

4. **Check Your Work:**
   - Verify each step of your calculations.
   - Check if the answer makes sense in the context of the problem.
   - Review the problem to ensure all parts have been addressed.

5. **State the Final Answer:**
   - Clearly write down the final answer.
   - Include units if applicable.

If you provide a specific math problem, I can demonstrate this process with detailed calculations and reasoning.
