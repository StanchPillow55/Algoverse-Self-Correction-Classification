==================================================

To solve the problem effectively, we need to first understand what is being asked. However, the question provided, "Sample reasoning question 379," is not specific enough to determine the exact nature of the problem. It seems to be a placeholder or reference to a specific problem that is not included in the text. 

To proceed, let's assume that "Sample reasoning question 379" refers to a typical math problem that involves logical reasoning or numerical calculations. Since the problem is not explicitly stated, I'll create a hypothetical problem and solve it step by step.

### Hypothetical Problem:
Let's assume "Sample reasoning question 379" is a logic puzzle involving numbers. Here's a possible problem:

**Problem:** 
You have a sequence of numbers: 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, ... What is the 10th number in this sequence?

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Identify the Pattern:**
   - The sequence given is 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, ...
   - Observing the sequence, each number is obtained by multiplying the previous number by 2.
   - This is a geometric sequence where the first term \( a_1 = 2 \) and the common ratio \( r = 2 \).

2. **Formula for the nth Term of a Geometric Sequence:**
   - The formula for the nth term of a geometric sequence is:
     \[
     a_n = a_1 \times r^{(n-1)}
     \]
   - Here, \( a_1 = 2 \) and \( r = 2 \).

3. **Calculate the 10th Term:**
   - Substitute the values into the formula to find the 10th term (\( n = 10 \)):
     \[
     a_{10} = 2 \times 2^{(10-1)}
     \]
     \[
     a_{10} = 2 \times 2^9
     \]
     \[
     a_{10} = 2 \times 512
     \]
     \[
     a_{10} = 1024
     \]

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The 10th number in the sequence is 1024.

### Final Answer:
The 10th number in the sequence is 1024.

This solution assumes a specific type of problem based on the limited information provided. If the original question "Sample reasoning question 379" refers to a different problem, please provide additional details or context for a more accurate solution.
