==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to follow a structured approach. However, the problem statement "Sample reasoning question 379" does not provide specific details or numbers to work with. Therefore, I'll demonstrate a general approach to solving a reasoning problem by creating a hypothetical math problem and solving it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**

A train travels from City A to City B, a distance of 120 miles, at a constant speed. On the return trip, the train travels at a speed that is 20 miles per hour faster and takes 1 hour less to complete the journey. What is the speed of the train on the way to City B?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( x \) be the speed of the train from City A to City B in miles per hour.
   - The speed on the return trip from City B to City A is \( x + 20 \) miles per hour.

2. **Set Up Equations:**
   - The time taken to travel from City A to City B is given by the formula: 
     \[
     \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{120}{x}
     \]
   - The time taken for the return trip from City B to City A is:
     \[
     \frac{120}{x + 20}
     \]
   - According to the problem, the return trip takes 1 hour less than the trip to City B:
     \[
     \frac{120}{x} - \frac{120}{x + 20} = 1
     \]

3. **Solve the Equation:**
   - To solve the equation, first find a common denominator and simplify:
     \[
     \frac{120(x + 20) - 120x}{x(x + 20)} = 1
     \]
     \[
     \frac{120x + 2400 - 120x}{x(x + 20)} = 1
     \]
     \[
     \frac{2400}{x(x + 20)} = 1
     \]
   - Cross-multiply to eliminate the fraction:
     \[
     2400 = x(x + 20)
     \]
     \[
     2400 = x^2 + 20x
     \]
   - Rearrange the equation into standard quadratic form:
     \[
     x^2 + 20x - 2400 = 0
     \]

4. **Solve the Quadratic Equation:**
   - Use the quadratic formula \( x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \), where \( a = 1 \), \( b = 20 \), and \( c = -2400 \):
     \[
     x = \frac{-20 \pm \sqrt{20^2 - 4 \times 1 \times (-2400)}}{2 \times 1}
     \]
     \[
     x = \frac{-20 \pm \sqrt{400 + 9600}}{2}
     \]
     \[
     x = \frac{-20 \pm \sqrt{10000}}{2}
     \]
     \[
     x = \frac{-20 \pm 100}{2}
     \]
   - Calculate the two possible solutions:
     \[
     x = \frac{80}{2} = 40 \quad \text{(valid speed)}
     \]
     \[
     x = \frac{-120}{2} = -60 \quad \text{(not valid, as speed cannot be negative)}
     \]

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The speed of the train on the way to City B is 40 miles per hour.

**Final Answer:**
The speed of the train on the way to City B is 40 miles per hour.
