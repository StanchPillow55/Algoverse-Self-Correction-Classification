To determine the cost of the High Jump sneakers, we need to calculate Joey's total earnings from all his activities and then sum them up.

1. **Earnings from mowing lawns:**
   Joey mows 3 neighbors' lawns, and he earns $8 for each lawn. Therefore, his earnings from mowing lawns can be calculated as follows:
   \[
   \text{Earnings from lawns} = 3 \text{ lawns} \times 8 \text{ dollars per lawn} = 24 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Earnings from selling collectible figures:**
   Joey sells 2 collectible figures, and he earns $9 for each figure. Therefore, his earnings from selling the figures can be calculated as follows:
   \[
   \text{Earnings from figures} = 2 \text{ figures} \times 9 \text{ dollars per figure} = 18 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Earnings from the after-school job:**
   Joey works 10 hours at his after-school job, and he earns $5 per hour. Therefore, his earnings from the job can be calculated as follows:
   \[
   \text{Earnings from job} = 10 \text{ hours} \times 5 \text{ dollars per hour} = 50 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Total earnings:**
   To find Joey's total earnings, we sum up his earnings from all activities:
   \[
   \text{Total earnings} = \text{Earnings from lawns} + \text{Earnings from figures} + \text{Earnings from job}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total earnings} = 24 \text{ dollars} + 18 \text{ dollars} + 50 \text{ dollars} = 92 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Since Joey's total earnings just cover the price of the High Jump sneakers, the cost of the sneakers is equal to his total earnings.

**Final Answer:**
The High Jump sneakers cost $92.
