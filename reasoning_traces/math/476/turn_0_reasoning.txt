To determine how much the High Jump basketball sneakers cost, we need to calculate Joey's total earnings from mowing lawns, selling collectible figures, and working his after-school job.

**Step 1: Calculate earnings from mowing lawns.**
Joey mows 3 neighbors' lawns, and he earns $8 for each lawn.

\[
\text{Earnings from mowing lawns} = \text{Number of lawns} \times \text{Earnings per lawn}
\]
\[
\text{Earnings from mowing lawns} = 3 \times 8 = 24 \text{ dollars}
\]

**Step 2: Calculate earnings from selling collectible figures.**
Joey sells 2 collectible figures for $9 each.

\[
\text{Earnings from selling figures} = \text{Number of figures} \times \text{Earnings per figure}
\]
\[
\text{Earnings from selling figures} = 2 \times 9 = 18 \text{ dollars}
\]

**Step 3: Calculate earnings from his after-school job.**
Joey works for 10 hours at a rate of $5 per hour.

\[
\text{Earnings from after-school job} = \text{Number of hours} \times \text{Earnings per hour}
\]
\[
\text{Earnings from after-school job} = 10 \times 5 = 50 \text{ dollars}
\]

**Step 4: Calculate total earnings.**
Now we add up all of Joey's earnings from the three activities.

\[
\text{Total earnings} = \text{Earnings from mowing lawns} + \text{Earnings from selling figures} + \text{Earnings from after-school job}
\]
\[
\text{Total earnings} = 24 + 18 + 50
\]
\[
\text{Total earnings} = 92 \text{ dollars}
\]

**Conclusion:**
If Joey's total earnings just cover the price of the High Jump sneakers, then the cost of the sneakers is equal to his total earnings.

\[
\text{Cost of the High Jump sneakers} = 92 \text{ dollars}
\]

Thus, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{92}
\]
