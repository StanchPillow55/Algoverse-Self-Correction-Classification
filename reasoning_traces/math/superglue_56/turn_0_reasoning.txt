==================================================

To solve the problem, I need more information about "Sample reasoning question 56." Since the question is not provided, I'll demonstrate how to approach a generic math problem step by step. Let's assume we have a sample problem:

**Problem:**
A car travels 150 miles in 3 hours. What is the average speed of the car in miles per hour?

**Step-by-step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We need to find the average speed of the car.
   - The formula for average speed is:
     \[
     \text{Average Speed} = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Total Time}}
     \]

2. **Identify the Given Information:**
   - Total Distance = 150 miles
   - Total Time = 3 hours

3. **Substitute the Given Values into the Formula:**
   \[
   \text{Average Speed} = \frac{150 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ hours}}
   \]

4. **Perform the Calculation:**
   - Divide 150 by 3:
     \[
     \text{Average Speed} = 50 \text{ miles per hour}
     \]

5. **Verify the Solution:**
   - Check if the units are correct: We have miles per hour, which is appropriate for speed.
   - Ensure the calculation is logical: Traveling 150 miles in 3 hours at 50 miles per hour makes sense.

6. **State the Final Answer:**
   - The average speed of the car is 50 miles per hour.

This is how you would solve a typical math problem involving average speed. If you have a specific question or need help with a different type of problem, please provide the details, and I'll be happy to assist!
