==================================================

To solve the problem, I'll need more specific information about "Sample reasoning question 56" as it seems to refer to a specific question from a source I don't have access to. However, I can guide you through a general approach to solving reasoning problems, especially if they involve mathematical reasoning or logic.

### General Approach to Solving Reasoning Problems:

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - Carefully read the question to understand what is being asked.
   - Identify the type of problem (e.g., algebra, geometry, logic puzzle).

2. **Identify Known and Unknown Information:**
   - List out the information given in the problem.
   - Determine what you need to find (the unknowns).

3. **Develop a Plan:**
   - Think about the strategies or formulas that might be applicable.
   - Consider breaking the problem into smaller, more manageable parts.

4. **Execute the Plan:**
   - Carry out calculations or logical deductions step by step.
   - Keep track of your work to ensure accuracy.

5. **Check Your Work:**
   - Review each step to ensure there are no errors.
   - Verify that your solution makes sense in the context of the problem.

6. **State the Final Answer:**
   - Clearly present your final answer, ensuring it addresses the question.

### Example Problem:

Let's create a hypothetical reasoning problem to demonstrate the process:

**Problem:** A train travels from City A to City B at a speed of 60 km/h. On the return trip, it travels at 40 km/h. If the total travel time is 5 hours, what is the distance between City A and City B?

**Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We need to find the distance between City A and City B.

2. **Identify Known and Unknown Information:**
   - Speed from A to B = 60 km/h
   - Speed from B to A = 40 km/h
   - Total travel time = 5 hours
   - Distance = ?

3. **Develop a Plan:**
   - Let the distance between City A and City B be \( d \) km.
   - Time taken from A to B = \( \frac{d}{60} \) hours
   - Time taken from B to A = \( \frac{d}{40} \) hours
   - Total time = Time from A to B + Time from B to A

4. **Execute the Plan:**
   \[
   \frac{d}{60} + \frac{d}{40} = 5
   \]
   - Find a common denominator for the fractions: 120.
   \[
   \frac{2d}{120} + \frac{3d}{120} = 5
   \]
   \[
   \frac{5d}{120} = 5
   \]
   - Multiply both sides by 120 to clear the fraction:
   \[
   5d = 600
   \]
   - Divide both sides by 5:
   \[
   d = 120
   \]

5. **Check Your Work:**
   - Time from A to B = \( \frac{120}{60} = 2 \) hours
   - Time from B to A = \( \frac{120}{40} = 3 \) hours
   - Total time = 2 + 3 = 5 hours, which matches the given total time.

6. **State the Final Answer:**
   - The distance between City A and City B is 120 km.
