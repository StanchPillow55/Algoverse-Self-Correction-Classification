==================================================

To solve the problem effectively, I need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 56" refers to. However, since I don't have access to specific external content like a particular set of questions labeled "Sample reasoning question 56," I'll provide a general approach to solving a math problem with complete reasoning and work.

Let's assume "Sample reasoning question 56" is a typical math problem. I'll create a hypothetical problem and solve it step by step.

### Hypothetical Problem:
**Question:** A car travels from Town A to Town B at a speed of 60 km/h and returns from Town B to Town A at a speed of 40 km/h. What is the average speed for the entire journey?

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - The car travels two legs of a journey: from Town A to Town B and back.
   - The speeds for the two legs are different: 60 km/h and 40 km/h.
   - We need to find the average speed for the entire journey.

2. **Define Average Speed:**
   - Average speed is defined as the total distance traveled divided by the total time taken.

3. **Assume a Distance:**
   - To simplify calculations, assume the distance between Town A and Town B is \( D \) kilometers.

4. **Calculate Time for Each Leg:**
   - **Time from A to B:** 
     \[
     \text{Time}_{A \to B} = \frac{D}{60} \text{ hours}
     \]
   - **Time from B to A:**
     \[
     \text{Time}_{B \to A} = \frac{D}{40} \text{ hours}
     \]

5. **Calculate Total Distance and Total Time:**
   - **Total Distance:** 
     \[
     \text{Total Distance} = D + D = 2D \text{ kilometers}
     \]
   - **Total Time:**
     \[
     \text{Total Time} = \frac{D}{60} + \frac{D}{40}
     \]

6. **Simplify Total Time:**
   - Find a common denominator for the fractions:
     \[
     \frac{D}{60} + \frac{D}{40} = \frac{2D}{120} + \frac{3D}{120} = \frac{5D}{120} = \frac{D}{24} \text{ hours}
     \]

7. **Calculate Average Speed:**
   - Use the formula for average speed:
     \[
     \text{Average Speed} = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Total Time}} = \frac{2D}{\frac{D}{24}} = 2D \times \frac{24}{D} = 48 \text{ km/h}
     \]

8. **Final Answer:**
   - The average speed for the entire journey is 48 km/h.

This solution demonstrates a structured approach to solving a problem by breaking it down into manageable steps, making assumptions where necessary, and applying relevant mathematical formulas.
