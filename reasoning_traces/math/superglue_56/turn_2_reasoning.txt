Question ID: superglue_56
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 56" entails. Since the problem statement is not explicitly provided, I'll demonstrate a general approach to solving a reasoning problem, which typically involves logical deduction, pattern recognition, or mathematical calculations.

### Step-by-Step Approach:

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - Since the problem is not explicitly stated, let's assume it involves a common type of reasoning question, such as identifying a pattern or solving a logic puzzle.

2. **Identify the Type of Problem:**
   - Reasoning questions can involve sequences, logical deductions, or mathematical operations. Without specific details, I'll assume a sequence problem, which is common in reasoning tests.

3. **Example Problem:**
   - Let's consider a sequence problem: "What is the next number in the sequence: 2, 4, 8, 16, ...?"

4. **Analyze the Sequence:**
   - Look for a pattern in the sequence. Here, each number is double the previous one.
   - \(2 \times 2 = 4\)
   - \(4 \times 2 = 8\)
   - \(8 \times 2 = 16\)

5. **Determine the Rule:**
   - The rule for this sequence is to multiply the previous number by 2.

6. **Apply the Rule:**
   - To find the next number, apply the rule to the last number in the sequence.
   - \(16 \times 2 = 32\)

7. **Verify the Pattern:**
   - Check if the rule consistently applies to all numbers in the sequence.
   - Yes, each number is indeed double the previous one.

8. **State the Final Answer:**
   - The next number in the sequence is 32.

### Conclusion:

Without the specific details of "Sample reasoning question 56," I demonstrated a general approach to solving a reasoning problem using a sequence example. The key steps involved identifying the pattern, determining the rule, applying it, and verifying consistency.

**Final Answer:** For the example sequence provided, the next number is 32.
