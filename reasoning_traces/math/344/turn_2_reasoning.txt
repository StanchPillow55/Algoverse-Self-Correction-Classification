==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to determine the prices of Juice Box B and Juice Box C based on the price of Juice Box A, and then find out how much more Juice Box C costs compared to Juice Box B.

1. **Identify the price of Juice Box A:**
   - Juice Box A costs $4.

2. **Calculate the price of Juice Box B:**
   - Juice Box B is $5 more than Juice Box A.
   - Price of Juice Box B = Price of Juice Box A + $5
   - Price of Juice Box B = $4 + $5 = $9.

3. **Calculate the price of Juice Box C:**
   - Juice Box C is $7 more than Juice Box A.
   - Price of Juice Box C = Price of Juice Box A + $7
   - Price of Juice Box C = $4 + $7 = $11.

4. **Determine how much more Juice Box C is than Juice Box B:**
   - Difference = Price of Juice Box C - Price of Juice Box B
   - Difference = $11 - $9 = $2.

Thus, Juice Box C is $2 more than Juice Box B.

**Final Answer: Juice Box C is $2 more than Juice Box B.**
