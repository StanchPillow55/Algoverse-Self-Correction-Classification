Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to determine the prices of Juice Box A, Juice Box B, and Juice Box C, and then find out how much more Juice Box C costs compared to Juice Box B.

1. **Price of Juice Box A**:  
   Juice Box A costs $4.

2. **Price of Juice Box B**:  
   Juice Box B is $5 more than Juice Box A.  
   Therefore, the price of Juice Box B is:  
   \[
   \text{Price of Juice Box B} = \text{Price of Juice Box A} + 5 = 4 + 5 = 9 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Price of Juice Box C**:  
   Juice Box C is $7 more than Juice Box A.  
   Therefore, the price of Juice Box C is:  
   \[
   \text{Price of Juice Box C} = \text{Price of Juice Box A} + 7 = 4 + 7 = 11 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Difference in price between Juice Box C and Juice Box B**:  
   To find out how much more Juice Box C costs than Juice Box B, we subtract the price of Juice Box B from the price of Juice Box C:  
   \[
   \text{Difference} = \text{Price of Juice Box C} - \text{Price of Juice Box B} = 11 - 9 = 2 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Thus, Juice Box C is **$2 more** than Juice Box B.

**Final Answer**: Juice Box C is $2 more than Juice Box B.
