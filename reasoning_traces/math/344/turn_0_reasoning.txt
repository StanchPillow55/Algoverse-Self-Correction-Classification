==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to work backwards from the information given. Let's denote the initial number of marbles Archie had as \( x \).

1. **Understanding the Losses:**
   - Archie loses 60% of his marbles into the street. This means he retains 40% of his marbles after this loss.
   - Of the marbles he retains, he loses half down a sewer.

2. **Setting Up the Equations:**
   - After losing 60% of his marbles, Archie has 40% of his original marbles left. This can be expressed as:
     \[
     0.4x
     \]
   - He then loses half of these remaining marbles down a sewer. Therefore, he retains half of the 40% he had left:
     \[
     \frac{1}{2} \times 0.4x = 0.2x
     \]
   - We know that after all these losses, Archie has 20 marbles left. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
     \[
     0.2x = 20
     \]

3. **Solving the Equation:**
   - To find the initial number of marbles \( x \), we solve the equation:
     \[
     0.2x = 20
     \]
   - Divide both sides by 0.2 to isolate \( x \):
     \[
     x = \frac{20}{0.2}
     \]
   - Calculate the division:
     \[
     x = 100
     \]

4. **Verification:**
   - Let's verify the solution by working through the problem with \( x = 100 \):
     - Initially, Archie has 100 marbles.
     - He loses 60% of 100 marbles, which is 60 marbles. So, he has:
       \[
       100 - 60 = 40 \text{ marbles left}
       \]
     - He then loses half of these 40 marbles down a sewer, which is 20 marbles. So, he has:
       \[
       40 - 20 = 20 \text{ marbles left}
       \]
   - This matches the given condition that Archie has 20 marbles left after all losses.

Therefore, the initial number of marbles Archie started with is \(\boxed{100}\).
