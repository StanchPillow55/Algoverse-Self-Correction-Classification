==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to work backwards from the information given about the number of marbles Archie has left after losing some.

1. **Identify the final amount of marbles**: 
   Archie has 20 marbles left after losing some.

2. **Determine how many marbles he had before losing half down the sewer**:
   Since he lost half of the remaining marbles down the sewer, we can denote the number of marbles he had before losing them down the sewer as \( x \). According to the problem, half of \( x \) was lost, leaving him with 20 marbles. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
   \[
   \frac{x}{2} = 20
   \]
   To find \( x \), we multiply both sides by 2:
   \[
   x = 20 \times 2 = 40
   \]
   So, before losing the marbles down the sewer, Archie had 40 marbles.

3. **Determine how many marbles he started with**:
   Now we need to find out how many marbles he started with before losing 60% of them into the street. Let \( y \) be the number of marbles he started with. According to the problem, he lost 60% of his marbles, which means he retained 40% of them. Therefore, the relationship can be expressed as:
   \[
   0.4y = 40
   \]
   To find \( y \), we divide both sides by 0.4:
   \[
   y = \frac{40}{0.4} = 100
   \]

4. **Final answer**:
   Therefore, the number of marbles Archie started with is \( \boxed{100} \).
