To solve the problem, we need to determine the prices of Juice Box A, Juice Box B, and Juice Box C, and then find out how much more Juice Box C costs compared to Juice Box B.

1. **Identify the price of Juice Box A**:
   - Juice Box A costs 4 dollars.
   \[
   \text{Price of Juice Box A} = 4 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Calculate the price of Juice Box B**:
   - Juice Box B is 5 dollars more than Juice Box A.
   \[
   \text{Price of Juice Box B} = \text{Price of Juice Box A} + 5
   \]
   Substituting the price of Juice Box A:
   \[
   \text{Price of Juice Box B} = 4 + 5 = 9 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Calculate the price of Juice Box C**:
   - Juice Box C is 7 dollars more than Juice Box A.
   \[
   \text{Price of Juice Box C} = \text{Price of Juice Box A} + 7
   \]
   Substituting the price of Juice Box A:
   \[
   \text{Price of Juice Box C} = 4 + 7 = 11 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Determine how much more Juice Box C is than Juice Box B**:
   - We need to find the difference in price between Juice Box C and Juice Box B.
   \[
   \text{Difference} = \text{Price of Juice Box C} - \text{Price of Juice Box B}
   \]
   Substituting the prices we calculated:
   \[
   \text{Difference} = 11 - 9 = 2 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Therefore, Juice Box C is 2 dollars more than Juice Box B.

**Final Answer**: Juice Box C is 2 dollars more than Juice Box B.
