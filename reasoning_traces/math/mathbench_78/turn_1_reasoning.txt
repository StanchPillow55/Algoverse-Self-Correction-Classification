Question ID: mathbench_78
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 78," we first need to understand what the problem is asking. However, the problem statement "Sample math problem 78" is not specific enough for us to determine what the actual mathematical question is. 

In a typical scenario, a math problem labeled with a number like "78" would refer to a specific problem in a textbook or worksheet. Without additional context or details, it's impossible to solve the problem accurately. 

However, let's assume that "Sample math problem 78" is a placeholder for a typical math problem. I'll create a hypothetical problem and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem 78:**

"Calculate the sum of the first 78 positive integers."

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   We need to find the sum of the first 78 positive integers. The sequence of the first 78 positive integers is: 1, 2, 3, ..., 78.

2. **Identify the Formula:**
   The sum of the first \( n \) positive integers can be calculated using the formula:
   \[
   S = \frac{n(n + 1)}{2}
   \]
   where \( S \) is the sum and \( n \) is the number of terms.

3. **Substitute the Values:**
   Here, \( n = 78 \). Plug this value into the formula:
   \[
   S = \frac{78 \times (78 + 1)}{2}
   \]

4. **Calculate the Sum:**
   \[
   S = \frac{78 \times 79}{2}
   \]
   First, calculate \( 78 \times 79 \):
   \[
   78 \times 79 = 6162
   \]
   Now, divide by 2:
   \[
   S = \frac{6162}{2} = 3081
   \]

5. **Conclusion:**
   The sum of the first 78 positive integers is 3081.

**Final Answer:**
The sum of the first 78 positive integers is 3081.
