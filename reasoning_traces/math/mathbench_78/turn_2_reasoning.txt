==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 78," we first need to understand what the problem is asking. However, the problem statement is incomplete as it only says "Sample math problem 78" without providing any specific details or context. 

To proceed, let's assume that "Sample math problem 78" refers to a typical math problem that might be found in a textbook or exam. Since we don't have the actual problem, I'll create a hypothetical math problem that could be labeled as "78" in a sequence of problems. Let's assume it's a problem involving basic algebra, which is common in math textbooks.

**Hypothetical Problem 78:**
Solve for \( x \) in the equation: 
\[ 3x + 5 = 20 \]

**Step-by-step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Equation:**
   The equation given is \( 3x + 5 = 20 \). This is a linear equation in one variable, \( x \).

2. **Isolate the Variable:**
   To solve for \( x \), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We start by eliminating the constant term on the left side.

   Subtract 5 from both sides:
   \[
   3x + 5 - 5 = 20 - 5
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   3x = 15
   \]

3. **Solve for \( x \):**
   Now, divide both sides by 3 to solve for \( x \):
   \[
   \frac{3x}{3} = \frac{15}{3}
   \]
   Simplifying gives:
   \[
   x = 5
   \]

4. **Verify the Solution:**
   Substitute \( x = 5 \) back into the original equation to verify:
   \[
   3(5) + 5 = 20
   \]
   Simplifying the left side:
   \[
   15 + 5 = 20
   \]
   \[
   20 = 20
   \]
   The left side equals the right side, confirming that our solution is correct.

**Final Answer:**
The solution to the equation \( 3x + 5 = 20 \) is \( x = 5 \).

If "Sample math problem 78" refers to a different problem, please provide the specific details or context, and I will be happy to solve it accordingly.
