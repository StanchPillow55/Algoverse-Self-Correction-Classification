==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to determine how many pages Solo needs to read in total, how many pages he has already read, and then find out how many pages he has left to read. Finally, we will calculate the average number of pages he needs to read per day over the remaining days.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of pages Solo needs to read.**

- Pages from Science textbook: 4 pages
- Pages from Social Studies textbook: 20 pages
- Pages from History textbook: 7 pages
- Pages from Geography textbook: 8 pages

Now, we sum these pages:

\[
\text{Total pages} = 4 + 20 + 7 + 8
\]

Calculating this:

\[
4 + 20 = 24
\]
\[
24 + 7 = 31
\]
\[
31 + 8 = 39
\]

So, the total number of pages Solo needs to read is **39 pages**.

**Step 2: Determine how many pages Solo has already read.**

Solo read 15 pages on Monday. Therefore, we subtract the pages he has read from the total pages:

\[
\text{Pages left to read} = \text{Total pages} - \text{Pages read}
\]
\[
\text{Pages left to read} = 39 - 15
\]

Calculating this:

\[
39 - 15 = 24
\]

So, Solo has **24 pages** left to read.

**Step 3: Calculate the average number of pages he needs to read per day over the remaining days.**

Solo has 4 more days to complete his reading. We need to find out how many pages he needs to read each day on average:

\[
\text{Average pages per day} = \frac{\text{Pages left to read}}{\text{Remaining days}}
\]
\[
\text{Average pages per day} = \frac{24}{4}
\]

Calculating this:

\[
\frac{24}{4} = 6
\]

Thus, Solo needs to read an average of **6 pages per day** over the next 4 days.

**Final Answer:**
Solo needs to read an average of **6 pages per day**.
