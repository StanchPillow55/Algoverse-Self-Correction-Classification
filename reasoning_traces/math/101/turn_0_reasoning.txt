To solve this problem, we need to determine how many people Marcy can apply makeup to with the lip gloss she is bringing.

Let's break down the information given:

1. **Lip Gloss Capacity**: Each tube of lip gloss is enough for 3 people.

2. **Lip Gloss Supply**: Marcy is bringing 6 tubs of lip gloss, and each tub contains 2 tubes of lip gloss.

First, we need to calculate the total number of tubes of lip gloss Marcy is bringing:

- Each tub contains 2 tubes.
- Marcy is bringing 6 tubs.

To find the total number of tubes, we multiply the number of tubs by the number of tubes per tub:

\[
6 \text{ tubs} \times 2 \text{ tubes per tub} = 12 \text{ tubes}
\]

Now, we know Marcy has 12 tubes of lip gloss. Since each tube can cover 3 people, we need to calculate how many people can be covered by 12 tubes:

- Each tube covers 3 people.
- Marcy has 12 tubes.

To find the total number of people that can be covered, we multiply the number of tubes by the number of people each tube can cover:

\[
12 \text{ tubes} \times 3 \text{ people per tube} = 36 \text{ people}
\]

Therefore, Marcy can apply makeup to 36 people with the lip gloss she is bringing.

**Final Answer: 36 people**
