To solve the problem, we need to determine how many people Marcy can do makeup for based on the amount of lip gloss she has.

1. **Understanding the makeup supply**:
   - Each tube of lip gloss can be used for 3 people's makeup.
   - Marcy has 6 tubs of lip gloss.
   - Each tub holds 2 tubes of lip gloss.

2. **Calculating the total number of tubes of lip gloss**:
   - Since each tub holds 2 tubes and Marcy has 6 tubs, we can calculate the total number of tubes as follows:
     \[
     \text{Total tubes} = \text{Number of tubs} \times \text{Tubes per tub} = 6 \times 2 = 12 \text{ tubes}
     \]

3. **Calculating how many people can be served**:
   - Each tube of lip gloss serves 3 people. Therefore, we can find out how many people can be served with the total number of tubes:
     \[
     \text{Total people served} = \text{Total tubes} \times \text{People per tube} = 12 \times 3 = 36 \text{ people}
     \]

4. **Final answer**:
   - Marcy can do makeup for **36 people**.

Thus, the final answer is that Marcy is painting makeup for **36 people**.
