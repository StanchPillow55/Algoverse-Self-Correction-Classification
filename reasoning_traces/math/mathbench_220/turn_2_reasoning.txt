==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 220," we need to first understand what the problem is asking. However, the problem statement "Sample math problem 220" is not clear or specific. It seems to be a placeholder or a reference to a specific problem that is not provided here. 

To proceed, let's assume a hypothetical math problem related to the number 220, such as finding its factors, checking if it's a perfect number, or solving an equation involving 220. I'll choose to explore whether 220 is a perfect number, as this is a classic type of problem involving specific numbers.

### Problem: Is 220 a perfect number?

A perfect number is a positive integer that is equal to the sum of its proper divisors, excluding itself. Let's determine if 220 is a perfect number by following these steps:

1. **Find the divisors of 220:**
   - Start with 1 (since 1 is a divisor of every integer).
   - Check divisibility by numbers up to the square root of 220. The square root of 220 is approximately 14.83, so we check divisibility up to 14.
   - List the divisors:
     - 1 (220 ÷ 1 = 220)
     - 2 (220 ÷ 2 = 110)
     - 4 (220 ÷ 4 = 55)
     - 5 (220 ÷ 5 = 44)
     - 10 (220 ÷ 10 = 22)
     - 11 (220 ÷ 11 = 20)
   - The complete list of divisors of 220 (excluding 220 itself) is: 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 11, 20, 22, 44, 55, 110.

2. **Calculate the sum of the proper divisors:**
   \[
   1 + 2 + 4 + 5 + 10 + 11 + 20 + 22 + 44 + 55 + 110 = 284
   \]

3. **Determine if 220 is a perfect number:**
   - A perfect number is equal to the sum of its proper divisors. Since 220 is not equal to 284, 220 is not a perfect number.

### Final Answer:
220 is not a perfect number because the sum of its proper divisors (284) is not equal to 220.
