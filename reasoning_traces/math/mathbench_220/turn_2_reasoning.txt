==================================================

To solve "Sample math problem 220," we need to first understand what the problem is asking. However, since "Sample math problem 220" is not a standard reference to a specific math problem, I'll create a hypothetical problem based on common math topics. Let's assume the problem is as follows:

**Problem:**
A rectangle has a length that is 3 times its width. If the perimeter of the rectangle is 220 units, find the dimensions of the rectangle.

**Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We need to find the length and width of a rectangle.
   - The length \( L \) is 3 times the width \( W \).
   - The perimeter \( P \) of the rectangle is 220 units.

2. **Set Up the Equations:**
   - The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is:
     \[
     P = 2L + 2W
     \]
   - We know \( L = 3W \).
   - Substitute \( L = 3W \) into the perimeter formula:
     \[
     220 = 2(3W) + 2W
     \]

3. **Simplify and Solve for \( W \):**
   - Simplify the equation:
     \[
     220 = 6W + 2W
     \]
     \[
     220 = 8W
     \]
   - Solve for \( W \):
     \[
     W = \frac{220}{8}
     \]
     \[
     W = 27.5
     \]

4. **Find the Length \( L \):**
   - Since \( L = 3W \):
     \[
     L = 3 \times 27.5
     \]
     \[
     L = 82.5
     \]

5. **Verify the Solution:**
   - Check the perimeter with these dimensions:
     \[
     P = 2L + 2W = 2(82.5) + 2(27.5)
     \]
     \[
     P = 165 + 55 = 220
     \]
   - The calculated perimeter matches the given perimeter, confirming our solution is correct.

**Final Answer:**
The dimensions of the rectangle are:
- Width \( W = 27.5 \) units
- Length \( L = 82.5 \) units
