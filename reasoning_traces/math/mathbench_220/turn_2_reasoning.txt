==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 220," I need more specific details about the problem itself. Since the problem is not explicitly stated, I'll create a hypothetical math problem involving the number 220 and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**
Determine if the number 220 is a perfect number. A perfect number is a positive integer that is equal to the sum of its proper divisors, excluding itself.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Identify the Proper Divisors of 220:**
   - A proper divisor of a number is a divisor that is not the number itself.
   - To find the divisors of 220, we check each integer from 1 up to \(\sqrt{220}\) to see if it divides 220 without leaving a remainder.

   - \(220 \div 1 = 220\) (1 is a divisor)
   - \(220 \div 2 = 110\) (2 is a divisor)
   - \(220 \div 4 = 55\) (4 is a divisor)
   - \(220 \div 5 = 44\) (5 is a divisor)
   - \(220 \div 10 = 22\) (10 is a divisor)
   - \(220 \div 11 = 20\) (11 is a divisor)
   - \(220 \div 20 = 11\) (20 is a divisor)
   - \(220 \div 22 = 10\) (22 is a divisor)
   - \(220 \div 44 = 5\) (44 is a divisor)
   - \(220 \div 55 = 4\) (55 is a divisor)
   - \(220 \div 110 = 2\) (110 is a divisor)

   The proper divisors of 220 are: 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 11, 20, 22, 44, 55, and 110.

2. **Calculate the Sum of the Proper Divisors:**
   - Sum = \(1 + 2 + 4 + 5 + 10 + 11 + 20 + 22 + 44 + 55 + 110\)

   - First, add smaller numbers: \(1 + 2 + 4 + 5 = 12\)
   - Add the next set: \(12 + 10 + 11 = 33\)
   - Add more: \(33 + 20 + 22 = 75\)
   - Add the larger numbers: \(75 + 44 = 119\)
   - Continue adding: \(119 + 55 = 174\)
   - Finally, add the largest: \(174 + 110 = 284\)

3. **Determine if 220 is a Perfect Number:**
   - A perfect number is one where the sum of its proper divisors equals the number itself.
   - Here, the sum of the proper divisors of 220 is 284, which is not equal to 220.

**Conclusion:**
220 is not a perfect number because the sum of its proper divisors (284) is not equal to 220.

**Final Answer:**
220 is not a perfect number.
