==================================================

To solve the problem, "Sample math problem 220," we first need to understand what the problem is asking. Since the problem is not explicitly stated, I'll assume a hypothetical math problem involving the number 220. Let's consider a problem related to the properties of the number 220.

### Problem:
Determine if 220 is a perfect number, and if not, identify its classification (deficient, perfect, or abundant).

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Understanding Perfect Numbers:**
   - A perfect number is a positive integer that is equal to the sum of its proper divisors, excluding itself.
   - Proper divisors of a number are all divisors excluding the number itself.

2. **Finding the Divisors of 220:**
   - To find the divisors, we need to check all numbers up to the square root of 220.
   - The square root of 220 is approximately 14.83, so we check divisors up to 14.

3. **Calculating Divisors:**
   - Start with 1, which is a divisor of every integer.
   - Check divisibility for numbers from 2 to 14.
   - Divisors of 220: 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 11, 20, 22, 44, 55, 110, 220.

4. **Proper Divisors:**
   - Exclude 220 itself from the list of divisors.
   - Proper divisors of 220: 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 11, 20, 22, 44, 55, 110.

5. **Sum of Proper Divisors:**
   - Calculate the sum: 
     \[
     1 + 2 + 4 + 5 + 10 + 11 + 20 + 22 + 44 + 55 + 110 = 284
     \]

6. **Classification:**
   - Compare the sum of proper divisors (284) to the original number (220).
   - Since 284 > 220, 220 is classified as an **abundant number**.

### Conclusion:
220 is not a perfect number. It is an abundant number because the sum of its proper divisors (284) is greater than the number itself (220).

**Final Answer:**
220 is an abundant number.
