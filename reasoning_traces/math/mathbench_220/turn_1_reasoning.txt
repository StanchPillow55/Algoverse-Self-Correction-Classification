==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 220," we first need to understand what the problem is asking. However, the problem statement is not clear or complete. Since "Sample math problem 220" does not provide specific details, numbers, or context, I will assume this is a placeholder or a reference to a specific problem that should be provided.

To proceed, I'll demonstrate how to solve a generic math problem, such as solving a simple algebraic equation. If you have a specific problem in mind, please provide the details, and I'll be happy to help with that.

Let's solve the following sample algebra problem:

**Problem:** Solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 3x + 5 = 20 \).

**Step-by-step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Equation:**
   The equation given is \( 3x + 5 = 20 \). We need to find the value of \( x \) that makes this equation true.

2. **Isolate the Variable:**
   To solve for \( x \), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We start by eliminating the constant term on the left side.

   Subtract 5 from both sides of the equation:
   \[
   3x + 5 - 5 = 20 - 5
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   3x = 15
   \]

3. **Solve for \( x \):**
   Now, we need to solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides by the coefficient of \( x \), which is 3.

   Divide both sides by 3:
   \[
   \frac{3x}{3} = \frac{15}{3}
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   x = 5
   \]

4. **Verify the Solution:**
   To ensure our solution is correct, we substitute \( x = 5 \) back into the original equation and check if both sides are equal.

   Substitute \( x = 5 \) into the original equation:
   \[
   3(5) + 5 = 20
   \]
   Simplify the left side:
   \[
   15 + 5 = 20
   \]
   \[
   20 = 20
   \]
   Since both sides of the equation are equal, our solution is verified.

**Final Answer:**
The solution to the equation \( 3x + 5 = 20 \) is \( x = 5 \).

If you have a specific problem labeled as "Sample math problem 220," please provide the details, and I will solve it accordingly.
