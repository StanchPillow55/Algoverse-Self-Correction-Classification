==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 220," we need to first understand what the problem is asking. However, the problem statement "Sample math problem 220" is not specific enough to determine what the actual question is. It seems like a placeholder or a reference to a specific problem that isn't provided here.

Since there is no specific math problem given, I will demonstrate how to solve a generic math problem step by step. Let's assume a sample math problem for demonstration purposes:

**Sample Math Problem:**
Solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Equation:**
   The equation given is \( 2x + 3 = 11 \). This is a linear equation in one variable, \( x \).

2. **Isolate the Variable:**
   To solve for \( x \), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We can do this by performing operations that will leave \( x \) alone on one side.

3. **Subtract 3 from Both Sides:**
   To eliminate the constant term on the left side, subtract 3 from both sides of the equation:
   \[
   2x + 3 - 3 = 11 - 3
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   2x = 8
   \]

4. **Divide by 2:**
   Now, divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( x \):
   \[
   \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{8}{2}
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   x = 4
   \]

5. **Verify the Solution:**
   Substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation to verify:
   \[
   2(4) + 3 = 11
   \]
   \[
   8 + 3 = 11
   \]
   \[
   11 = 11
   \]
   The left side equals the right side, confirming that \( x = 4 \) is the correct solution.

**Final Answer:**
The solution to the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \) is \( x = 4 \).
