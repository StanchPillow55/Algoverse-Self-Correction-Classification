To solve this problem, we need to determine the heights of Anne's sister and Bella, and then find the difference between Bella's height and Anne's sister's height.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Determine Anne's Sister's Height:**
   - We know from the problem that Anne is 2 times as tall as her sister.
   - Let \( x \) represent the height of Anne's sister.
   - According to the problem, Anne's height is 2 times her sister's height, so we can write the equation:
     \[
     \text{Anne's height} = 2 \times \text{Sister's height}
     \]
   - We are given that Anne is 80 cm tall, so:
     \[
     80 = 2x
     \]
   - To find \( x \), divide both sides of the equation by 2:
     \[
     x = \frac{80}{2} = 40
     \]
   - Therefore, Anne's sister is 40 cm tall.

2. **Determine Bella's Height:**
   - The problem states that Bella is 3 times as tall as Anne.
   - Let \( y \) represent Bella's height.
   - We can write the equation:
     \[
     \text{Bella's height} = 3 \times \text{Anne's height}
     \]
   - Since Anne is 80 cm tall:
     \[
     y = 3 \times 80 = 240
     \]
   - Therefore, Bella is 240 cm tall.

3. **Calculate the Height Difference:**
   - Now, we need to find the difference between Bella's height and Anne's sister's height:
     \[
     \text{Height difference} = \text{Bella's height} - \text{Sister's height}
     \]
   - Substitute the known values:
     \[
     \text{Height difference} = 240 - 40 = 200
     \]

Thus, the height difference between Bella and Anne's sister is 200 cm.

**Final Answer:**
The height difference between Bella and Anne's sister is 200 cm.
