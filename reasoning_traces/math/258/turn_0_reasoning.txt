To find out how much Nancy has to pay for her overdue books, we will break down the problem into two parts: the cost for the overdue books and the flat fee for having overdue books.

1. **Calculate the cost for the overdue books:**
   - Nancy has 8 overdue books.
   - The fine for each book is $0.50.
   - To find the total cost for the overdue books, we multiply the number of books by the fine per book:

   \[
   \text{Total cost for overdue books} = \text{Number of books} \times \text{Fine per book}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total cost for overdue books} = 8 \times 0.50 = 4.00
   \]

   So, Nancy owes $4.00 for the overdue books.

2. **Add the flat fee:**
   - Nancy also has to pay a flat fee of $2.00 for having at least one book that is over a week overdue.
   - We simply add this flat fee to the total cost for the overdue books:

   \[
   \text{Total amount owed} = \text{Total cost for overdue books} + \text{Flat fee}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total amount owed} = 4.00 + 2.00 = 6.00
   \]

3. **Final answer:**
   - Therefore, the total amount Nancy has to pay is **$6.00**.

In conclusion, after calculating the fines for the overdue books and adding the flat fee, Nancy owes a total of **$6.00**.
