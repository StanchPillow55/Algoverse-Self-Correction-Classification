==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to determine the heights of Anne's sister and Bella based on the information given about Anne's height.

1. **Identify Anne's height**: 
   We know that Anne is 80 cm tall.

2. **Determine Anne's sister's height**: 
   The problem states that Anne is 2 times as tall as her sister. We can denote Anne's sister's height as \( S \). Therefore, we can set up the equation:
   \[
   \text{Anne's height} = 2 \times \text{Sister's height}
   \]
   Substituting the known value:
   \[
   80 \text{ cm} = 2 \times S
   \]
   To find \( S \), we divide both sides by 2:
   \[
   S = \frac{80 \text{ cm}}{2} = 40 \text{ cm}
   \]
   So, Anne's sister is 40 cm tall.

3. **Determine Bella's height**: 
   The problem states that Bella is 3 times as tall as Anne. We can denote Bella's height as \( B \). Therefore, we can set up the equation:
   \[
   \text{Bella's height} = 3 \times \text{Anne's height}
   \]
   Substituting the known value:
   \[
   B = 3 \times 80 \text{ cm} = 240 \text{ cm}
   \]
   So, Bella is 240 cm tall.

4. **Calculate the height difference between Bella and Anne's sister**: 
   We need to find the difference in height between Bella and Anne's sister. The height difference \( D \) can be calculated as:
   \[
   D = \text{Bella's height} - \text{Sister's height}
   \]
   Substituting the values we found:
   \[
   D = 240 \text{ cm} - 40 \text{ cm} = 200 \text{ cm}
   \]

5. **Final answer**: 
   The height difference between Bella and Anne's sister is \( \boxed{200} \) cm.
