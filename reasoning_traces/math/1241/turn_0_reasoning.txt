To find Rose's profit, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total cost of the eggs.**
2. **Determine how many eggs Rose has.**
3. **Calculate the total revenue from selling the eggs.**
4. **Calculate the profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue.**

### Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the eggs

Rose bought five dozens of eggs, and the cost per dozen is $2.40. 

First, we calculate the total cost:
\[
\text{Total Cost} = \text{Number of dozens} \times \text{Cost per dozen}
\]
\[
\text{Total Cost} = 5 \times 2.40 = 12.00
\]

So, the total cost of the eggs is **$12.00**.

### Step 2: Determine how many eggs Rose has

Since one dozen contains 12 eggs, we can calculate the total number of eggs:
\[
\text{Total Eggs} = \text{Number of dozens} \times \text{Eggs per dozen}
\]
\[
\text{Total Eggs} = 5 \times 12 = 60
\]

So, Rose has **60 eggs**.

### Step 3: Calculate the total revenue from selling the eggs

Rose sells the eggs for $1 for every 3 eggs. To find out how much she makes from selling all 60 eggs, we first determine how many groups of 3 eggs are in 60:
\[
\text{Number of groups of 3 eggs} = \frac{\text{Total Eggs}}{3} = \frac{60}{3} = 20
\]

Since she sells each group of 3 eggs for $1, the total revenue is:
\[
\text{Total Revenue} = \text{Number of groups} \times \text{Price per group}
\]
\[
\text{Total Revenue} = 20 \times 1 = 20
\]

So, the total revenue from selling the eggs is **$20.00**.

### Step 4: Calculate the profit

Profit is calculated as the total revenue minus the total cost:
\[
\text{Profit} = \text{Total Revenue} - \text{Total Cost}
\]
\[
\text{Profit} = 20 - 12 = 8
\]

Thus, Rose's profit is **$8.00**.

### Final Answer

Rose's profit is **$8.00**.
