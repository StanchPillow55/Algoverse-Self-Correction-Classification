==================================================

To solve a math problem effectively, it's important to understand the problem, identify what is being asked, and then work through the solution step by step. However, the question you've provided, "Sample reasoning question 223," lacks specific details or context. Therefore, I'll demonstrate a general approach to solving a math problem by creating a hypothetical problem and solving it.

**Hypothetical Problem:**

A farmer has a rectangular field that is 100 meters long and 60 meters wide. He wants to build a fence around the entire field and also wants to divide the field into two equal parts with a fence parallel to the shorter side. Calculate the total length of the fence required.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We have a rectangular field with dimensions 100 meters (length) and 60 meters (width).
   - We need to calculate the total length of the fence required to enclose the field and divide it into two equal parts.

2. **Calculate the Perimeter of the Field:**
   - The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula:
     \[
     P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width})
     \]
   - Substitute the given values:
     \[
     P = 2 \times (100 + 60) = 2 \times 160 = 320 \text{ meters}
     \]

3. **Divide the Field into Two Equal Parts:**
   - To divide the field into two equal parts with a fence parallel to the shorter side (width), the fence will run along the length of the field.
   - The length of this dividing fence will be equal to the length of the field, which is 100 meters.

4. **Calculate the Total Length of the Fence Required:**
   - The total length of the fence is the sum of the perimeter and the dividing fence:
     \[
     \text{Total Fence Length} = \text{Perimeter} + \text{Dividing Fence Length}
     \]
   - Substitute the calculated values:
     \[
     \text{Total Fence Length} = 320 + 100 = 420 \text{ meters}
     \]

5. **Final Answer:**
   - The total length of the fence required is 420 meters.

By following these steps, we have calculated the total length of the fence needed for the farmer's field. This approach can be applied to a wide range of math problems by carefully understanding the problem, applying relevant formulas, and performing calculations step by step.
