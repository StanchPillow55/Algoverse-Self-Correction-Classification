==================================================

Let the number of chicken nuggets Alyssa ate be represented by \( x \).

According to the problem, Keely and Kendall each ate twice as many nuggets as Alyssa. Therefore, the number of nuggets Keely ate is \( 2x \) and the number of nuggets Kendall ate is also \( 2x \).

Now, we can set up an equation to represent the total number of chicken nuggets eaten by all three:

\[
x + 2x + 2x = 100
\]

Combining the terms on the left side gives:

\[
x + 4x = 100
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
5x = 100
\]

Next, we solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides of the equation by 5:

\[
x = \frac{100}{5} = 20
\]

Thus, Alyssa ate \( 20 \) chicken nuggets.

To verify, we can calculate how many nuggets Keely and Kendall ate:

- Keely ate \( 2x = 2 \times 20 = 40 \) nuggets.
- Kendall also ate \( 2x = 2 \times 20 = 40 \) nuggets.

Now we check the total:

\[
20 + 40 + 40 = 100
\]

Since the total is correct, we conclude that our solution is verified.

Therefore, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{20}
\]
