==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine how many chicken nuggets Alyssa ate, given that Keely and Kendall each ate twice as many as Alyssa, and the total number of nuggets eaten by all three is 100.

Let's define the variables:
- Let \( A \) represent the number of nuggets Alyssa ate.
- Since Keely ate twice as many as Alyssa, Keely ate \( 2A \) nuggets.
- Similarly, Kendall also ate twice as many as Alyssa, so Kendall ate \( 2A \) nuggets as well.

According to the problem, the total number of nuggets eaten by Alyssa, Keely, and Kendall is 100. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[
A + 2A + 2A = 100
\]

Simplify the equation by combining like terms:

\[
5A = 100
\]

To find the value of \( A \), divide both sides of the equation by 5:

\[
A = \frac{100}{5} = 20
\]

Thus, Alyssa ate 20 chicken nuggets.

To verify, we can check the total number of nuggets eaten:
- Alyssa ate 20 nuggets.
- Keely ate \( 2 \times 20 = 40 \) nuggets.
- Kendall ate \( 2 \times 20 = 40 \) nuggets.

Adding these amounts together gives:

\[
20 + 40 + 40 = 100
\]

This confirms that our solution is correct. Therefore, the final answer is:

Alyssa ate 20 chicken nuggets.
