Question ID: 109
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine how many chicken nuggets Alyssa ate, given that Keely and Kendall each ate twice as many nuggets as Alyssa, and the total number of nuggets consumed by all three is 100.

Let's define the variables:
- Let \( A \) represent the number of nuggets Alyssa ate.
- Since Keely ate twice as many as Alyssa, Keely ate \( 2A \) nuggets.
- Similarly, Kendall also ate twice as many as Alyssa, so Kendall ate \( 2A \) nuggets.

The total number of nuggets eaten by Alyssa, Keely, and Kendall is given as 100. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[
A + 2A + 2A = 100
\]

Simplify the equation by combining like terms:

\[
5A = 100
\]

To find the value of \( A \), divide both sides of the equation by 5:

\[
A = \frac{100}{5} = 20
\]

Thus, Alyssa ate 20 chicken nuggets.

Final Answer: Alyssa ate 20 chicken nuggets.
