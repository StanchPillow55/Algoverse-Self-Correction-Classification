Question ID: 109
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

Let the number of chicken nuggets Alyssa ate be represented by \( x \).

According to the problem, Keely and Kendall each ate twice as many nuggets as Alyssa. Therefore, the number of nuggets Keely ate is \( 2x \) and the number of nuggets Kendall ate is also \( 2x \).

Now, we can set up the equation based on the total number of chicken nuggets ordered:

\[
x + 2x + 2x = 100
\]

Combining like terms, we have:

\[
x + 4x = 100
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
5x = 100
\]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides by 5:

\[
x = \frac{100}{5} = 20
\]

Thus, Alyssa ate \( 20 \) chicken nuggets.

To verify, we can calculate how many nuggets Keely and Kendall ate:

- Keely ate \( 2x = 2 \times 20 = 40 \) nuggets.
- Kendall also ate \( 2x = 2 \times 20 = 40 \) nuggets.

Now, we can check the total:

\[
20 + 40 + 40 = 100
\]

The total is indeed 100, confirming our solution is correct.

Therefore, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{20}
\]
