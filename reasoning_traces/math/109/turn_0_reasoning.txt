To solve the problem, we need to calculate the total cost of purchasing 10 gallons of gas at the price of $3.00 per gallon and then determine the cashback amount that will be received.

**Step 1: Calculate the total cost of gas without cashback.**

The price of gas is $3.00 per gallon. If someone buys 10 gallons, we can calculate the total cost as follows:

\[
\text{Total Cost} = \text{Price per gallon} \times \text{Number of gallons}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\text{Total Cost} = 3.00 \, \text{dollars/gallon} \times 10 \, \text{gallons} = 30.00 \, \text{dollars}
\]

**Step 2: Calculate the cashback amount.**

The app company offers $0.20 cashback for each gallon purchased. Therefore, for 10 gallons, the cashback can be calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Cashback} = \text{Cashback per gallon} \times \text{Number of gallons}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\text{Cashback} = 0.20 \, \text{dollars/gallon} \times 10 \, \text{gallons} = 2.00 \, \text{dollars}
\]

**Step 3: Calculate the final cost after applying the cashback.**

To find the final amount paid after receiving the cashback, we subtract the cashback from the total cost of the gas:

\[
\text{Final Cost} = \text{Total Cost} - \text{Cashback}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\text{Final Cost} = 30.00 \, \text{dollars} - 2.00 \, \text{dollars} = 28.00 \, \text{dollars}
\]

**Final Answer:**

The total cost of the gas after applying the cashback rewards is **$28.00**.
