==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine how many chicken nuggets Alyssa ate, given that Keely and Kendall each ate twice as many as Alyssa, and the total number of chicken nuggets is 100.

Let's define a variable to represent the number of chicken nuggets Alyssa ate:

- Let \( x \) be the number of chicken nuggets Alyssa ate.

According to the problem, Keely and Kendall each ate twice as many nuggets as Alyssa. Therefore, we can express the number of nuggets Keely and Kendall ate in terms of \( x \):

- Keely ate \( 2x \) nuggets.
- Kendall ate \( 2x \) nuggets.

The total number of chicken nuggets eaten by Alyssa, Keely, and Kendall is 100. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[
x + 2x + 2x = 100
\]

Simplify the equation by combining like terms:

\[
x + 2x + 2x = 5x
\]

So, the equation becomes:

\[
5x = 100
\]

To find the value of \( x \), divide both sides of the equation by 5:

\[
x = \frac{100}{5}
\]

\[
x = 20
\]

Thus, Alyssa ate 20 chicken nuggets.

To verify, let's check the total number of nuggets eaten:

- Alyssa ate \( x = 20 \) nuggets.
- Keely ate \( 2x = 2 \times 20 = 40 \) nuggets.
- Kendall ate \( 2x = 2 \times 20 = 40 \) nuggets.

Adding these amounts gives:

\[
20 + 40 + 40 = 100
\]

The total is indeed 100, confirming our solution is correct.

Final Answer: Alyssa ate 20 chicken nuggets.
