==================================================

Let \( x \) represent the number of chicken nuggets that Alyssa ate. According to the problem, Keely and Kendall each ate twice as many chicken nuggets as Alyssa. Therefore, we can express the number of chicken nuggets eaten by Keely and Kendall as follows:

- Keely ate \( 2x \)
- Kendall ate \( 2x \)

Now, we can set up an equation to represent the total number of chicken nuggets eaten by all three individuals. The total number of chicken nuggets is given as 100. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[
x + 2x + 2x = 100
\]

Now, combine the terms on the left side:

\[
x + 2x + 2x = 5x
\]

So the equation simplifies to:

\[
5x = 100
\]

Next, we solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides of the equation by 5:

\[
x = \frac{100}{5} = 20
\]

Thus, Alyssa ate \( 20 \) chicken nuggets.

To verify, we can calculate how many Keely and Kendall ate:

- Keely ate \( 2x = 2 \times 20 = 40 \)
- Kendall ate \( 2x = 2 \times 20 = 40 \)

Now, we can check the total:

\[
20 + 40 + 40 = 100
\]

Since the total is indeed 100, our calculations are correct.

Therefore, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{20}
\]
