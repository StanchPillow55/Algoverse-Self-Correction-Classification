To solve the problem, we will calculate the number of cloud puffs Alice sees each day from Monday to Friday, starting with the number of puffs she counts on Monday and doubling that number each subsequent day.

1. **Monday**: Alice counts 3 puffs of clouds.
   \[
   \text{Monday} = 3
   \]

2. **Tuesday**: She sees double the number of clouds from Monday.
   \[
   \text{Tuesday} = 2 \times \text{Monday} = 2 \times 3 = 6
   \]

3. **Wednesday**: She sees double the number of clouds from Tuesday.
   \[
   \text{Wednesday} = 2 \times \text{Tuesday} = 2 \times 6 = 12
   \]

4. **Thursday**: She sees double the number of clouds from Wednesday.
   \[
   \text{Thursday} = 2 \times \text{Wednesday} = 2 \times 12 = 24
   \]

5. **Friday**: She sees double the number of clouds from Thursday.
   \[
   \text{Friday} = 2 \times \text{Thursday} = 2 \times 24 = 48
   \]

Now, we will sum the number of clouds counted from Monday to Friday to find the total number of clouds Alice has counted throughout the week.

\[
\text{Total clouds} = \text{Monday} + \text{Tuesday} + \text{Wednesday} + \text{Thursday} + \text{Friday}
\]
\[
\text{Total clouds} = 3 + 6 + 12 + 24 + 48
\]

Now, we will perform the addition step by step:

- First, add Monday and Tuesday:
  \[
  3 + 6 = 9
  \]

- Next, add the result to Wednesday:
  \[
  9 + 12 = 21
  \]

- Then, add the result to Thursday:
  \[
  21 + 24 = 45
  \]

- Finally, add the result to Friday:
  \[
  45 + 48 = 93
  \]

Thus, the total number of clouds Alice has counted from Monday to Friday is:

\[
\boxed{93}
\]
