==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to determine how long Miriam spent cleaning her room. We know the total time she spent on various tasks and the time spent on each task.

1. **Convert the total time from hours to minutes**: 
   Miriam spent a total of 2 hours. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we convert hours to minutes:
   \[
   2 \text{ hours} = 2 \times 60 \text{ minutes} = 120 \text{ minutes}
   \]

2. **List the time spent on each task**:
   - Laundry: 30 minutes
   - Cleaning the bathroom: 15 minutes
   - Cleaning her room: \( x \) minutes (this is what we need to find)
   - Homework: 40 minutes

3. **Set up the equation**: 
   The total time spent on all tasks is equal to the sum of the time spent on each task:
   \[
   30 + 15 + x + 40 = 120
   \]

4. **Combine the known times**:
   First, we add the times for laundry, cleaning the bathroom, and homework:
   \[
   30 + 15 = 45
   \]
   \[
   45 + 40 = 85
   \]
   So, the equation simplifies to:
   \[
   85 + x = 120
   \]

5. **Solve for \( x \)**:
   To find \( x \), we subtract 85 from both sides of the equation:
   \[
   x = 120 - 85
   \]
   \[
   x = 35
   \]

6. **Conclusion**: 
   Miriam spent 35 minutes cleaning her room.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{35}
\]
