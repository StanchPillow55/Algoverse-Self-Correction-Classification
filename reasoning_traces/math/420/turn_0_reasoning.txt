==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine how much time Miriam spent cleaning her room. We know the total time she spent on all tasks and the time spent on each of the other tasks. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Convert Total Time to Minutes:**
   - Miriam spent a total of 2 hours on all tasks.
   - Since 1 hour is equal to 60 minutes, 2 hours is equal to:
     \[
     2 \times 60 = 120 \text{ minutes}
     \]

2. **List Known Times for Each Task:**
   - Laundry: 30 minutes
   - Cleaning the bathroom: 15 minutes
   - Homework: 40 minutes

3. **Calculate Total Time Spent on Known Tasks:**
   - Add the time spent on laundry, cleaning the bathroom, and homework:
     \[
     30 + 15 + 40 = 85 \text{ minutes}
     \]

4. **Determine Time Spent Cleaning Her Room:**
   - Subtract the total time spent on known tasks from the total time:
     \[
     120 - 85 = 35 \text{ minutes}
     \]

Therefore, Miriam spent 35 minutes cleaning her room.

**Final Answer:**
Miriam spent 35 minutes cleaning her room.
