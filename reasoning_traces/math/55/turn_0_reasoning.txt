Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To find the percentage of flowers that are not roses in the garden, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of flowers in the garden.**
   - We have:
     - Roses = 25
     - Tulips = 40
     - Daisies = 35
   - Total flowers = Roses + Tulips + Daisies
   \[
   \text{Total flowers} = 25 + 40 + 35
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total flowers} = 100
   \]

2. **Calculate the number of flowers that are not roses.**
   - To find the number of flowers that are not roses, we subtract the number of roses from the total number of flowers.
   \[
   \text{Flowers not roses} = \text{Total flowers} - \text{Roses}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Flowers not roses} = 100 - 25
   \]
   \[
   \text{Flowers not roses} = 75
   \]

3. **Calculate the percentage of flowers that are not roses.**
   - The percentage of flowers that are not roses can be calculated using the formula:
   \[
   \text{Percentage not roses} = \left( \frac{\text{Flowers not roses}}{\text{Total flowers}} \right) \times 100
   \]
   \[
   \text{Percentage not roses} = \left( \frac{75}{100} \right) \times 100
   \]
   \[
   \text{Percentage not roses} = 75\%
   \]

Thus, the percentage of flowers that are not roses is \( \boxed{75\%} \).
