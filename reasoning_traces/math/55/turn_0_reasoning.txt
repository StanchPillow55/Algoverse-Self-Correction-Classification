Question ID: 55
Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to find the total number of flowers in the garden. We do this by adding the number of roses, tulips, and daisies together:

25 roses + 40 tulips + 35 daisies = 100 flowers

Next, we need to find out how many flowers are not roses. We do this by subtracting the number of roses from the total number of flowers:

100 flowers - 25 roses = 75 flowers are not roses

Now, we need to find out what percentage of the total number of flowers are not roses. We do this by dividing the number of flowers that are not roses by the total number of flowers, and then multiplying by 100 to get the percentage:

(75 flowers / 100 flowers) * 100 = 75%

So, 75% of the flowers in the garden are not roses.
