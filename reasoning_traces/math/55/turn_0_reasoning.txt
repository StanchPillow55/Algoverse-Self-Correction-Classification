==================================================

To solve the problem, we will follow these steps:

1. **Determine the number of lollipops Jean has after eating some.**
   - Jean starts with 30 lollipops.
   - Jean eats 2 lollipops.
   - We calculate the remaining lollipops:
     \[
     \text{Remaining lollipops} = \text{Initial lollipops} - \text{Lollipops eaten} = 30 - 2 = 28
     \]

2. **Determine how many bags Jean can fill with the remaining lollipops.**
   - Jean wants to package 2 lollipops in each bag.
   - We need to find out how many bags can be filled with 28 lollipops.
   - We calculate the number of bags by dividing the remaining lollipops by the number of lollipops per bag:
     \[
     \text{Number of bags} = \frac{\text{Remaining lollipops}}{\text{Lollipops per bag}} = \frac{28}{2}
     \]

3. **Perform the division:**
   \[
   \frac{28}{2} = 14
   \]

Thus, Jean can fill **14 bags** with the remaining lollipops.

Finally, the answer is:
\[
\boxed{14}
\]
