To determine how much more expensive the deal at the grocery store is per can compared to the bulk warehouse, we need to calculate the cost per can at both locations and then find the difference.

**Step 1: Calculate the cost per can at the bulk warehouse.**

The bulk warehouse offers 48 cans for $12.00. To find the cost per can, we divide the total cost by the number of cans:

\[
\text{Cost per can at warehouse} = \frac{\text{Total cost}}{\text{Number of cans}} = \frac{12.00}{48}
\]

Perform the division:

\[
\frac{12.00}{48} = 0.25
\]

So, the cost per can at the warehouse is $0.25, or 25 cents.

**Step 2: Calculate the cost per can at the grocery store.**

The grocery store offers 12 cans for $6.00. Similarly, we divide the total cost by the number of cans to find the cost per can:

\[
\text{Cost per can at grocery store} = \frac{\text{Total cost}}{\text{Number of cans}} = \frac{6.00}{12}
\]

Perform the division:

\[
\frac{6.00}{12} = 0.50
\]

So, the cost per can at the grocery store is $0.50, or 50 cents.

**Step 3: Calculate the difference in cost per can.**

To find how much more expensive the grocery store is per can, subtract the cost per can at the warehouse from the cost per can at the grocery store:

\[
\text{Difference in cost per can} = 50 \text{ cents} - 25 \text{ cents} = 25 \text{ cents}
\]

Thus, the deal at the grocery store is 25 cents more expensive per can than the deal at the bulk warehouse.

**Final Answer:**

The deal at the grocery store is 25 cents more expensive per can.
