To determine how much more expensive the deal at the grocery store is per can, we need to calculate the price per can for both the warehouse and the grocery store, and then find the difference between these two prices.

**Step 1: Calculate the price per can at the warehouse.**

The warehouse offers 48 cans for $12.00. To find the price per can, we divide the total price by the number of cans:

\[
\text{Price per can at the warehouse} = \frac{\text{Total price}}{\text{Number of cans}} = \frac{12.00}{48}
\]

\[
\text{Price per can at the warehouse} = 0.25
\]

So, the price per can at the warehouse is $0.25, or 25 cents.

**Step 2: Calculate the price per can at the grocery store.**

The grocery store offers 12 cans for $6.00. Similarly, we divide the total price by the number of cans to find the price per can:

\[
\text{Price per can at the grocery store} = \frac{\text{Total price}}{\text{Number of cans}} = \frac{6.00}{12}
\]

\[
\text{Price per can at the grocery store} = 0.50
\]

So, the price per can at the grocery store is $0.50, or 50 cents.

**Step 3: Calculate the difference in price per can.**

Now, we find the difference between the price per can at the grocery store and the price per can at the warehouse:

\[
\text{Difference in price per can} = \text{Price per can at the grocery store} - \text{Price per can at the warehouse}
\]

\[
\text{Difference in price per can} = 0.50 - 0.25
\]

\[
\text{Difference in price per can} = 0.25
\]

The difference in price per can is $0.25, or 25 cents.

**Final Answer:**

The deal at the grocery store is 25 cents more expensive per can than the deal at the warehouse.
