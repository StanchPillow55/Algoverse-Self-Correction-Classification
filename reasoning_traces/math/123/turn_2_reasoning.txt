==================================================

To determine how much more expensive, per can, the deal at the grocery store is compared to the bulk warehouse, we need to calculate the price per can at both locations and then find the difference.

**Step 1: Calculate the price per can at the bulk warehouse.**

- The bulk warehouse offers 48 cans for $12.00.
- To find the price per can, divide the total price by the number of cans:

\[
\text{Price per can at warehouse} = \frac{12.00}{48}
\]

- Perform the division:

\[
\frac{12.00}{48} = 0.25
\]

- Therefore, the price per can at the bulk warehouse is $0.25, or 25 cents.

**Step 2: Calculate the price per can at the grocery store.**

- The grocery store offers 12 cans for $6.00.
- To find the price per can, divide the total price by the number of cans:

\[
\text{Price per can at grocery store} = \frac{6.00}{12}
\]

- Perform the division:

\[
\frac{6.00}{12} = 0.50
\]

- Therefore, the price per can at the grocery store is $0.50, or 50 cents.

**Step 3: Calculate the difference in price per can.**

- Subtract the price per can at the bulk warehouse from the price per can at the grocery store:

\[
\text{Difference in price per can} = 0.50 - 0.25
\]

- Perform the subtraction:

\[
0.50 - 0.25 = 0.25
\]

- The difference in price per can is $0.25, or 25 cents.

**Final Answer:**

The deal at the grocery store is 25 cents more expensive per can compared to the bulk warehouse.
