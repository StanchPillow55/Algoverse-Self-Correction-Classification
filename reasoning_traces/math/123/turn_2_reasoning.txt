==================================================

To determine how much more expensive the grocery store's sparkling water is per can compared to the bulk warehouse's offer, we will first calculate the price per can for both the bulk warehouse and the grocery store.

### Step 1: Calculate the price per can at the bulk warehouse.

The bulk warehouse offers 48 cans for $12.00. 

To find the price per can, we divide the total price by the number of cans:

\[
\text{Price per can at bulk warehouse} = \frac{\text{Total Price}}{\text{Number of Cans}} = \frac{12.00}{48}
\]

Calculating this gives:

\[
\frac{12.00}{48} = 0.25
\]

So, the price per can at the bulk warehouse is $0.25.

### Step 2: Calculate the price per can at the grocery store.

The grocery store offers 12 cans for $6.00. 

Similarly, we calculate the price per can:

\[
\text{Price per can at grocery store} = \frac{\text{Total Price}}{\text{Number of Cans}} = \frac{6.00}{12}
\]

Calculating this gives:

\[
\frac{6.00}{12} = 0.50
\]

So, the price per can at the grocery store is $0.50.

### Step 3: Compare the prices per can.

Now we need to find out how much more expensive the grocery store's price is compared to the bulk warehouse's price:

\[
\text{Difference in price per can} = \text{Price per can at grocery store} - \text{Price per can at bulk warehouse}
\]

Substituting the values we calculated:

\[
\text{Difference in price per can} = 0.50 - 0.25 = 0.25
\]

### Step 4: Convert the difference to cents.

Since the problem asks for the difference in cents, we convert dollars to cents by multiplying by 100:

\[
\text{Difference in cents} = 0.25 \times 100 = 25 \text{ cents}
\]

### Final Answer

The grocery store's sparkling water is **25 cents more expensive per can** than the bulk warehouse's sparkling water.
