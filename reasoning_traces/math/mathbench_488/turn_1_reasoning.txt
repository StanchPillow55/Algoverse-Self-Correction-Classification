Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample math problem 488" refers to. Since the problem itself is not provided, I'll assume a generic math problem with the number 488 involved. Let's create a problem involving the number 488 and solve it.

**Problem:**
Find the sum of the digits of the number 488 and determine if the sum is a prime number.

**Step 1: Find the sum of the digits of 488.**

The number 488 consists of three digits: 4, 8, and 8.

Calculate the sum of these digits:
\[ 4 + 8 + 8 = 20 \]

**Step 2: Determine if the sum (20) is a prime number.**

A prime number is a number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.

Let's check the divisibility of 20:
- 20 is divisible by 1 and 20 (trivially).
- 20 is also divisible by 2 (since it is even).
- 20 is divisible by 4 and 5 (since \( 4 \times 5 = 20 \)).

Since 20 has divisors other than 1 and itself, it is not a prime number.

**Final Answer:**
The sum of the digits of 488 is 20, and 20 is not a prime number.
