Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve "Sample math problem 488," we need to first understand what the problem entails. Since the problem is not explicitly stated, I'll assume a generic math problem and solve it step by step. Let's assume the problem involves solving a quadratic equation, which is a common type of math problem.

### Problem:
Solve the quadratic equation: \( 2x^2 - 4x - 6 = 0 \).

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Identify the coefficients**: 
   The given quadratic equation is in the standard form \( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \), where:
   - \( a = 2 \)
   - \( b = -4 \)
   - \( c = -6 \)

2. **Calculate the discriminant**:
   The discriminant \( D \) of a quadratic equation \( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \) is given by the formula:
   \[
   D = b^2 - 4ac
   \]
   Substituting the values of \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \):
   \[
   D = (-4)^2 - 4 \times 2 \times (-6) = 16 + 48 = 64
   \]

3. **Determine the nature of the roots**:
   Since the discriminant \( D = 64 \) is positive, the quadratic equation has two distinct real roots.

4. **Use the quadratic formula**:
   The roots of the quadratic equation can be found using the quadratic formula:
   \[
   x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{D}}{2a}
   \]
   Substituting the values of \( b \), \( D \), and \( a \):
   \[
   x = \frac{-(-4) \pm \sqrt{64}}{2 \times 2} = \frac{4 \pm 8}{4}
   \]

5. **Calculate the roots**:
   - First root:
     \[
     x_1 = \frac{4 + 8}{4} = \frac{12}{4} = 3
     \]
   - Second root:
     \[
     x_2 = \frac{4 - 8}{4} = \frac{-4}{4} = -1
     \]

### Final Answer:
The solutions to the quadratic equation \( 2x^2 - 4x - 6 = 0 \) are \( x = 3 \) and \( x = -1 \).
