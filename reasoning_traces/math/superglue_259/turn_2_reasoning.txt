Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we first need to understand what "Sample reasoning question 259" refers to. Since the problem statement is not specific, let's assume it is a hypothetical math problem that requires logical reasoning and mathematical calculations. I will create a sample problem and solve it step by step.

**Sample Problem:**
A farmer has a rectangular field that is 100 meters long and 60 meters wide. He wants to divide the field into smaller rectangular plots, each with an area of 150 square meters. How many such plots can the farmer create?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We have a rectangular field with dimensions 100 meters (length) and 60 meters (width).
   - The area of the field is calculated as:
     \[
     \text{Area of the field} = \text{Length} \times \text{Width} = 100 \, \text{m} \times 60 \, \text{m} = 6000 \, \text{m}^2
     \]
   - Each smaller plot should have an area of 150 square meters.

2. **Calculate the Number of Plots:**
   - To find out how many plots of 150 square meters can fit into the 6000 square meters, we divide the total area of the field by the area of one plot:
     \[
     \text{Number of plots} = \frac{\text{Total area of the field}}{\text{Area of one plot}} = \frac{6000 \, \text{m}^2}{150 \, \text{m}^2}
     \]
   - Perform the division:
     \[
     \frac{6000}{150} = 40
     \]

3. **Conclusion:**
   - The farmer can create 40 plots, each with an area of 150 square meters, from the field.

**Final Answer:**
The farmer can create 40 plots of 150 square meters each from the field.
