==================================================

To solve the problem, I need more information about "Sample reasoning question 259" as it doesn't provide any specific details or context. However, I can guide you through a generic approach to solving a typical math problem by breaking it down into steps. If you have a specific math problem, please provide the details, and I'll be happy to help.

Here's a general approach to solving a math problem:

### Step 1: Understand the Problem
- **Read the problem carefully.** Make sure you understand what is being asked.
- **Identify the given information.** What data or numbers are provided?
- **Determine what you need to find.** What is the problem asking you to solve?

### Step 2: Devise a Plan
- **Choose a strategy.** This could involve setting up an equation, drawing a diagram, or breaking the problem into smaller parts.
- **Consider similar problems.** Think about how you have solved similar problems in the past.

### Step 3: Carry Out the Plan
- **Execute your strategy.** Perform calculations or logical steps as needed.
- **Show all work.** Write down each step clearly to avoid mistakes and to make it easier to review.

### Step 4: Review/Check Your Work
- **Verify your solution.** Check if your answer makes sense in the context of the problem.
- **Recalculate if necessary.** If something seems off, go through your calculations again.

### Example Problem
Let's apply this approach to a simple example problem:

**Problem:** Solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).

#### Step 1: Understand the Problem
- We need to find the value of \( x \) that satisfies the equation.

#### Step 2: Devise a Plan
- We can solve this linear equation by isolating \( x \).

#### Step 3: Carry Out the Plan
1. Start with the equation: \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).
2. Subtract 3 from both sides to isolate the term with \( x \):
   \[
   2x + 3 - 3 = 11 - 3
   \]
   \[
   2x = 8
   \]
3. Divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( x \):
   \[
   \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{8}{2}
   \]
   \[
   x = 4
   \]

#### Step 4: Review/Check Your Work
- Substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation to verify:
  \[
  2(4) + 3 = 8 + 3 = 11
  \]
- The left side equals the right side, confirming our solution is correct.

### Final Answer
The solution to the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \) is \( x = 4 \).

If you provide the specific details of "Sample reasoning question 259," I can give a more tailored solution.
