To solve this problem, we need to determine the length and cost of Janet's newest movie based on the information given about her previous movie.

1. **Determine the length of the previous movie:**
   - The previous movie is 2 hours long.
   - Convert hours to minutes since the cost is given per minute: 
     \[
     2 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 120 \text{ minutes}
     \]

2. **Calculate the length of the newest movie:**
   - The newest movie is 60% longer than the previous movie.
   - Calculate 60% of the previous movie's length:
     \[
     0.60 \times 120 \text{ minutes} = 72 \text{ minutes}
     \]
   - Add this to the original length to find the total length of the newest movie:
     \[
     120 \text{ minutes} + 72 \text{ minutes} = 192 \text{ minutes}
     \]

3. **Determine the cost per minute of the newest movie:**
   - The previous movie cost $50 per minute.
   - The newest movie costs twice as much per minute:
     \[
     2 \times 50 \text{ dollars/minute} = 100 \text{ dollars/minute}
     \]

4. **Calculate the total cost to film the newest movie:**
   - Multiply the length of the newest movie by the cost per minute:
     \[
     192 \text{ minutes} \times 100 \text{ dollars/minute} = 19,200 \text{ dollars}
     \]

Therefore, the total amount of money required to film Janet's entire newest film is \(\boxed{19,200}\) dollars.
