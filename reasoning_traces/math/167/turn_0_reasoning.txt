To solve the problem, we will break it down into several steps:

1. **Determine the length of the new movie**:
   - Janet's previous movie is 2 hours long. We need to convert this into minutes because the cost is given per minute.
   - 2 hours = 2 Ã— 60 minutes = 120 minutes.
   - The new movie is 60% longer than the previous movie. To find the length of the new movie, we calculate 60% of 120 minutes:
     \[
     60\% \text{ of } 120 = 0.60 \times 120 = 72 \text{ minutes}.
     \]
   - Now, we add this to the original length of the previous movie to find the total length of the new movie:
     \[
     \text{Length of new movie} = 120 \text{ minutes} + 72 \text{ minutes} = 192 \text{ minutes}.
     \]

2. **Determine the cost per minute of the new movie**:
   - The cost to film the previous movie was $50 per minute.
   - The new movie costs twice as much per minute as the previous movie:
     \[
     \text{Cost per minute of new movie} = 2 \times 50 = 100 \text{ dollars per minute}.
     \]

3. **Calculate the total cost to film the new movie**:
   - To find the total cost, we multiply the length of the new movie by the cost per minute:
     \[
     \text{Total cost} = \text{Length of new movie} \times \text{Cost per minute of new movie} = 192 \text{ minutes} \times 100 \text{ dollars per minute}.
     \]
   - Performing the multiplication:
     \[
     192 \times 100 = 19200 \text{ dollars}.
     \]

4. **Final answer**:
   - The total amount of money required to film Janet's entire newest film is:
     \[
     \boxed{19200} \text{ dollars}.
     \]
