==================================================

To solve the problem, we will define variables for the ages of Seth and Brooke, set up equations based on the information given, and then solve for their ages.

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( S \) be Seth's current age.
   - Let \( B \) be Brooke's current age.

2. **Set Up the Equations:**
   - According to the problem, Seth is twice as old as Brooke. This gives us our first equation:
     \[
     S = 2B
     \]
   - The problem also states that in 2 years, the sum of their ages will be 28. In 2 years, Seth's age will be \( S + 2 \) and Brooke's age will be \( B + 2 \). Therefore, we can write our second equation as:
     \[
     (S + 2) + (B + 2) = 28
     \]
   - Simplifying this equation:
     \[
     S + B + 4 = 28
     \]
     \[
     S + B = 28 - 4
     \]
     \[
     S + B = 24
     \]

3. **Substitute the First Equation into the Second:**
   - We have two equations now:
     1. \( S = 2B \)
     2. \( S + B = 24 \)

   - We can substitute \( S \) from the first equation into the second equation:
     \[
     2B + B = 24
     \]
     \[
     3B = 24
     \]

4. **Solve for Brooke's Age:**
   - Dividing both sides by 3:
     \[
     B = \frac{24}{3} = 8
     \]

5. **Find Seth's Age:**
   - Now that we have Brooke's age, we can find Seth's age using the first equation:
     \[
     S = 2B = 2 \times 8 = 16
     \]

6. **Final Answer:**
   - Seth is \( \boxed{16} \) years old.

7. **Verification:**
   - Let's verify the solution:
     - If Brooke is 8 years old, then Seth is indeed \( 2 \times 8 = 16 \).
     - In 2 years, Brooke will be \( 8 + 2 = 10 \) and Seth will be \( 16 + 2 = 18 \).
     - The sum of their ages in 2 years will be \( 10 + 18 = 28 \), which matches the condition given in the problem.

Thus, the solution is confirmed, and Seth is \( \boxed{16} \) years old.
