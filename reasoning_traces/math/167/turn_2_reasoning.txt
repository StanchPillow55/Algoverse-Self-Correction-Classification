Question ID: 167
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the length of the new movie**:
   - Janet's previous movie is 2 hours long. We need to convert this into minutes since the cost is given per minute.
   \[
   2 \text{ hours} = 2 \times 60 \text{ minutes} = 120 \text{ minutes}
   \]
   - The new movie is 60% longer than the previous movie. To find the length of the new movie, we calculate 60% of the previous movie's length and then add that to the original length.
   \[
   60\% \text{ of } 120 \text{ minutes} = 0.60 \times 120 = 72 \text{ minutes}
   \]
   - Therefore, the length of the new movie is:
   \[
   120 \text{ minutes} + 72 \text{ minutes} = 192 \text{ minutes}
   \]

2. **Determine the cost per minute for the new movie**:
   - The previous movie cost $50 per minute to film. The new movie costs twice as much per minute.
   \[
   \text{Cost per minute for the new movie} = 2 \times 50 = 100 \text{ dollars per minute}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total cost to film the new movie**:
   - Now that we know the length of the new movie (192 minutes) and the cost per minute ($100), we can calculate the total cost.
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = \text{Length of new movie} \times \text{Cost per minute}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = 192 \text{ minutes} \times 100 \text{ dollars per minute} = 19200 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Final answer**:
   - The total amount of money required to film Janet's entire newest film is:
   \[
   \boxed{19200} \text{ dollars}
   \]
