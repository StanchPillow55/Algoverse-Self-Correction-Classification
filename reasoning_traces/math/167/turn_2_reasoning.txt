==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine the total cost of filming Janet's newest movie. We'll break down the problem step by step.

### Step 1: Determine the Length of the New Movie

1. **Length of Previous Movie:**  
   Janet's previous movie was 2 hours long.  
   Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, the previous movie was:  
   \[
   2 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 120 \text{ minutes}
   \]

2. **Length of New Movie:**  
   The new movie is 60% longer than the previous movie.  
   To find 60% of the previous movie's length:  
   \[
   0.60 \times 120 \text{ minutes} = 72 \text{ minutes}
   \]  
   Therefore, the total length of the new movie is:  
   \[
   120 \text{ minutes} + 72 \text{ minutes} = 192 \text{ minutes}
   \]

### Step 2: Determine the Cost per Minute of the New Movie

1. **Cost per Minute of Previous Movie:**  
   The previous movie cost $50 per minute to film.

2. **Cost per Minute of New Movie:**  
   The new movie cost twice as much per minute as the previous movie:  
   \[
   2 \times 50 \text{ dollars/minute} = 100 \text{ dollars/minute}
   \]

### Step 3: Calculate the Total Cost of the New Movie

To find the total cost of filming the new movie, multiply the length of the new movie by the cost per minute:  
\[
192 \text{ minutes} \times 100 \text{ dollars/minute} = 19,200 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Final Answer

The total amount of money required to film Janet's entire newest film is **$19,200**.
