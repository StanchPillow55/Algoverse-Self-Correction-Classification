==================================================

To solve the problem, we will follow these steps:

1. **Determine the length of the new movie**: 
   Janet's previous movie is 2 hours long. We need to convert this into minutes since the cost is given per minute. 

   \[
   \text{Length of previous movie in minutes} = 2 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 120 \text{ minutes}
   \]

   The new movie is 60% longer than the previous movie. To find the length of the new movie, we calculate 60% of 120 minutes and then add that to the original length.

   \[
   \text{Increase in length} = 0.60 \times 120 \text{ minutes} = 72 \text{ minutes}
   \]

   Now, we add this increase to the original length:

   \[
   \text{Length of new movie} = 120 \text{ minutes} + 72 \text{ minutes} = 192 \text{ minutes}
   \]

2. **Determine the cost per minute for the new movie**:
   The cost to film the previous movie is $50 per minute. The new movie costs twice as much per minute.

   \[
   \text{Cost per minute for new movie} = 2 \times 50 = 100 \text{ dollars/minute}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total cost to film the new movie**:
   Now that we know the length of the new movie and the cost per minute, we can find the total cost by multiplying the length of the new movie by the cost per minute.

   \[
   \text{Total cost} = \text{Length of new movie} \times \text{Cost per minute for new movie}
   \]

   Substituting the values we found:

   \[
   \text{Total cost} = 192 \text{ minutes} \times 100 \text{ dollars/minute} = 19200 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Thus, the total amount of money required to film Janet's entire newest film is:

\[
\boxed{19200} \text{ dollars}
\]
