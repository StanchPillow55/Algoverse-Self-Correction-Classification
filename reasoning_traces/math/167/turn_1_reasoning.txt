Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine the total cost of filming Janet's newest movie. We'll break down the problem into steps and calculate each part systematically.

### Step 1: Determine the Length of the New Movie

1. **Length of the Previous Movie:**
   - The previous movie was 2 hours long.
   - Convert hours to minutes: \(2 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 120 \text{ minutes}\).

2. **Length of the New Movie:**
   - The new movie is 60% longer than the previous movie.
   - Calculate 60% of the previous movie's length: \(0.60 \times 120 \text{ minutes} = 72 \text{ minutes}\).
   - Add this to the original length to find the total length of the new movie: 
     \[
     120 \text{ minutes} + 72 \text{ minutes} = 192 \text{ minutes}
     \]

### Step 2: Determine the Cost per Minute of the New Movie

1. **Cost per Minute of the Previous Movie:**
   - The previous movie cost $50 per minute to film.

2. **Cost per Minute of the New Movie:**
   - The new movie cost twice as much per minute as the previous movie.
   - Calculate the cost per minute for the new movie: 
     \[
     2 \times 50 \text{ dollars/minute} = 100 \text{ dollars/minute}
     \]

### Step 3: Calculate the Total Cost of the New Movie

1. **Total Cost Calculation:**
   - Multiply the length of the new movie by the cost per minute:
     \[
     192 \text{ minutes} \times 100 \text{ dollars/minute} = 19,200 \text{ dollars}
     \]

### Final Answer

The total amount of money required to film Janet's entire newest film is \(\boxed{19,200}\) dollars.
