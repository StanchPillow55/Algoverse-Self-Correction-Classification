Question ID: 94
Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to find out how many pages are in all 3 books. Since each book is 400 pages, we multiply 400 by 3:

400 pages/book * 3 books = 1200 pages

Next, we need to find out how many days it will take John to write all 1200 pages. Since John writes 20 pages a day, we divide 1200 by 20:

1200 pages / 20 pages/day = 60 days

So, it will take John 60 days to write 3 books that are 400 pages each.
