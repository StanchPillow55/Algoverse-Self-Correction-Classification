==================================================

To determine how long it will take John to write 3 books that are each 400 pages long, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of pages John needs to write**:
   Since each book has 400 pages and there are 3 books, we can calculate the total number of pages as follows:
   \[
   \text{Total pages} = \text{Number of books} \times \text{Pages per book} = 3 \times 400 = 1200 \text{ pages}
   \]

2. **Determine how many pages John writes per day**:
   According to the problem, John writes 20 pages a day.

3. **Calculate the number of days it will take John to write the total number of pages**:
   To find out how many days it will take John to write 1200 pages, we divide the total number of pages by the number of pages he writes per day:
   \[
   \text{Days required} = \frac{\text{Total pages}}{\text{Pages per day}} = \frac{1200}{20}
   \]

4. **Perform the division**:
   \[
   \frac{1200}{20} = 60
   \]

Thus, it will take John **60 days** to write 3 books that are each 400 pages long.

**Final Answer**: 60 days
