Question ID: 94
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to find out the total number of pages John needs to write. Since each book is 400 pages and he needs to write 3 books, we multiply 400 by 3. 

400 pages/book * 3 books = 1200 pages

Next, we need to find out how many days it will take John to write all these pages. Since he writes 20 pages a day, we divide the total number of pages by 20.

1200 pages รท 20 pages/day = 60 days

So, it will take John 60 days to write 3 books that are 400 pages each.
