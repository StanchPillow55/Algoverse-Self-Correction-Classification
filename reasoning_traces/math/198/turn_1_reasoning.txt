==================================================

To determine how many minutes Rosie should run on Friday to reach her goal of 20 miles for the week, we need to calculate the total distance she has already run from Monday to Thursday and then find out how much more she needs to run on Friday.

**Step 1: Calculate the distance run each day.**

- **Monday:** Rosie runs for 1 hour at 6 miles per hour.
  \[
  \text{Distance on Monday} = 6 \text{ miles/hour} \times 1 \text{ hour} = 6 \text{ miles}
  \]

- **Tuesday:** Rosie runs for 30 minutes. Since 30 minutes is 0.5 hours:
  \[
  \text{Distance on Tuesday} = 6 \text{ miles/hour} \times 0.5 \text{ hours} = 3 \text{ miles}
  \]

- **Wednesday:** Rosie runs for 1 hour.
  \[
  \text{Distance on Wednesday} = 6 \text{ miles/hour} \times 1 \text{ hour} = 6 \text{ miles}
  \]

- **Thursday:** Rosie runs for 20 minutes. Since 20 minutes is \(\frac{1}{3}\) of an hour:
  \[
  \text{Distance on Thursday} = 6 \text{ miles/hour} \times \frac{1}{3} \text{ hours} = 2 \text{ miles}
  \]

**Step 2: Calculate the total distance run from Monday to Thursday.**

\[
\text{Total distance} = 6 \text{ miles} + 3 \text{ miles} + 6 \text{ miles} + 2 \text{ miles} = 17 \text{ miles}
\]

**Step 3: Determine how many more miles Rosie needs to run.**

Rosie's goal is to run 20 miles for the week. She has already run 17 miles, so she needs to run:
\[
20 \text{ miles} - 17 \text{ miles} = 3 \text{ miles}
\]

**Step 4: Calculate the time needed to run the remaining distance on Friday.**

Rosie runs at a speed of 6 miles per hour. To find out how long it takes to run 3 miles:
\[
\text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{3 \text{ miles}}{6 \text{ miles/hour}} = 0.5 \text{ hours}
\]

**Step 5: Convert the time from hours to minutes.**

Since 0.5 hours is equivalent to 30 minutes:
\[
0.5 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 30 \text{ minutes}
\]

Therefore, Rosie should run for **30 minutes on Friday** to reach her goal of 20 miles for the week.
