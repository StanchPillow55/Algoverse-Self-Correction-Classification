==================================================

To determine how many minutes Rosie should run on Friday to meet her weekly goal of 20 miles, we first need to calculate how many miles she has already run from Monday to Thursday.

**Step 1: Calculate the distance run each day.**

- **Monday:** Rosie runs for 1 hour at 6 miles per hour.
  \[
  \text{Distance on Monday} = 6 \text{ miles/hour} \times 1 \text{ hour} = 6 \text{ miles}
  \]

- **Tuesday:** Rosie runs for 30 minutes (0.5 hours) at 6 miles per hour.
  \[
  \text{Distance on Tuesday} = 6 \text{ miles/hour} \times 0.5 \text{ hours} = 3 \text{ miles}
  \]

- **Wednesday:** Rosie runs for 1 hour at 6 miles per hour.
  \[
  \text{Distance on Wednesday} = 6 \text{ miles/hour} \times 1 \text{ hour} = 6 \text{ miles}
  \]

- **Thursday:** Rosie runs for 20 minutes (1/3 hour) at 6 miles per hour.
  \[
  \text{Distance on Thursday} = 6 \text{ miles/hour} \times \frac{1}{3} \text{ hour} = 2 \text{ miles}
  \]

**Step 2: Calculate the total distance run from Monday to Thursday.**

\[
\text{Total distance} = 6 \text{ miles} + 3 \text{ miles} + 6 \text{ miles} + 2 \text{ miles} = 17 \text{ miles}
\]

**Step 3: Determine how many more miles Rosie needs to run to reach her goal.**

Rosie's goal is to run 20 miles for the week. She has already run 17 miles.

\[
\text{Miles remaining} = 20 \text{ miles} - 17 \text{ miles} = 3 \text{ miles}
\]

**Step 4: Calculate how long Rosie needs to run on Friday to cover the remaining 3 miles.**

Since Rosie runs at a speed of 6 miles per hour, we need to find the time it takes to run 3 miles.

\[
\text{Time required} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{3 \text{ miles}}{6 \text{ miles/hour}} = 0.5 \text{ hours}
\]

**Step 5: Convert the time from hours to minutes.**

Since 1 hour is 60 minutes, 0.5 hours is:

\[
0.5 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 30 \text{ minutes}
\]

Therefore, Rosie should run for **30 minutes** on Friday to meet her weekly goal of 20 miles.
