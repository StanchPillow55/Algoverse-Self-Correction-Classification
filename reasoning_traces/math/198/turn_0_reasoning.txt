To determine how many minutes Rosie should run on Friday to reach her goal of 20 miles for the week, we first need to calculate the total distance she has already run from Monday to Thursday.

1. **Calculate the distance run each day:**
   - **Monday:** Rosie runs for 1 hour at a speed of 6 miles per hour.
     \[
     \text{Distance on Monday} = 6 \text{ miles/hour} \times 1 \text{ hour} = 6 \text{ miles}
     \]

   - **Tuesday:** Rosie runs for 30 minutes. Since 30 minutes is half an hour, we convert it to hours:
     \[
     30 \text{ minutes} = 0.5 \text{ hours}
     \]
     Now we calculate the distance:
     \[
     \text{Distance on Tuesday} = 6 \text{ miles/hour} \times 0.5 \text{ hours} = 3 \text{ miles}
     \]

   - **Wednesday:** Rosie runs for 1 hour.
     \[
     \text{Distance on Wednesday} = 6 \text{ miles/hour} \times 1 \text{ hour} = 6 \text{ miles}
     \]

   - **Thursday:** Rosie runs for 20 minutes. We convert 20 minutes to hours:
     \[
     20 \text{ minutes} = \frac{20}{60} \text{ hours} = \frac{1}{3} \text{ hours}
     \]
     Now we calculate the distance:
     \[
     \text{Distance on Thursday} = 6 \text{ miles/hour} \times \frac{1}{3} \text{ hours} = 2 \text{ miles}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total distance run from Monday to Thursday:**
   \[
   \text{Total distance} = \text{Distance on Monday} + \text{Distance on Tuesday} + \text{Distance on Wednesday} + \text{Distance on Thursday}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total distance} = 6 \text{ miles} + 3 \text{ miles} + 6 \text{ miles} + 2 \text{ miles} = 17 \text{ miles}
   \]

3. **Determine the distance Rosie still needs to run on Friday:**
   Rosie wants to run a total of 20 miles for the week. Therefore, the distance she needs to run on Friday is:
   \[
   \text{Distance needed on Friday} = 20 \text{ miles} - 17 \text{ miles} = 3 \text{ miles}
   \]

4. **Calculate how long Rosie needs to run on Friday to cover 3 miles:**
   Since Rosie runs at a speed of 6 miles per hour, we can find the time required to run 3 miles using the formula:
   \[
   \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Time on Friday} = \frac{3 \text{ miles}}{6 \text{ miles/hour}} = 0.5 \text{ hours}
   \]

5. **Convert the time from hours to minutes:**
   \[
   0.5 \text{ hours} = 0.5 \times 60 \text{ minutes} = 30 \text{ minutes}
   \]

Thus, Rosie should run for **30 minutes** on Friday to reach her goal of 20 miles for the week.

**Final Answer: 30 minutes**
