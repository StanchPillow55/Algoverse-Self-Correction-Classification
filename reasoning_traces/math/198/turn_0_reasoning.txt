To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step, calculating the number of Pokémon cards Elaine has after each month.

1. **Initial Number of Cards**:
   Elaine starts with 20 Pokémon cards.

   \[
   \text{Initial cards} = 20
   \]

2. **Cards Collected in the First Month**:
   After a month, she collects three times the initial number of cards.

   \[
   \text{Cards collected in the first month} = 3 \times 20 = 60
   \]

3. **Total Cards After the First Month**:
   We add the cards collected in the first month to her initial number of cards.

   \[
   \text{Total after first month} = 20 + 60 = 80
   \]

4. **Cards Collected in the Second Month**:
   In the second month, she collects 20 fewer cards than those she collected in the first month.

   \[
   \text{Cards collected in the second month} = 60 - 20 = 40
   \]

5. **Total Cards After the Second Month**:
   We add the cards collected in the second month to the total after the first month.

   \[
   \text{Total after second month} = 80 + 40 = 120
   \]

6. **Cards Collected in the Third Month**:
   In the third month, she collects twice the combined number of Pokémon cards she collected in the first and second months. First, we need to find the total cards collected in the first and second months.

   \[
   \text{Total collected in first and second months} = 60 + 40 = 100
   \]

   Now, we calculate the cards collected in the third month.

   \[
   \text{Cards collected in the third month} = 2 \times 100 = 200
   \]

7. **Total Cards After the Third Month**:
   Finally, we add the cards collected in the third month to the total after the second month.

   \[
   \text{Total after third month} = 120 + 200 = 320
   \]

Thus, the total number of Pokémon cards Elaine has now is:

\[
\boxed{320}
\]
