To solve this problem, we need to calculate how many miles Rosie has already run from Monday to Thursday and then determine how many more miles she needs to run on Friday to reach a total of 20 miles for the week. We will then convert the required distance on Friday into time, given her running speed.

**Step 1: Calculate the distance Rosie runs each day from Monday to Thursday.**

- **Monday:** Rosie runs for 1 hour at a speed of 6 miles per hour.
  \[
  \text{Distance on Monday} = 6 \text{ miles/hour} \times 1 \text{ hour} = 6 \text{ miles}
  \]

- **Tuesday:** Rosie runs for 30 minutes. Since 30 minutes is 0.5 hours, we calculate:
  \[
  \text{Distance on Tuesday} = 6 \text{ miles/hour} \times 0.5 \text{ hours} = 3 \text{ miles}
  \]

- **Wednesday:** Rosie runs for 1 hour.
  \[
  \text{Distance on Wednesday} = 6 \text{ miles/hour} \times 1 \text{ hour} = 6 \text{ miles}
  \]

- **Thursday:** Rosie runs for 20 minutes. Since 20 minutes is \(\frac{1}{3}\) of an hour (20/60), we calculate:
  \[
  \text{Distance on Thursday} = 6 \text{ miles/hour} \times \frac{1}{3} \text{ hours} = 2 \text{ miles}
  \]

**Step 2: Calculate the total distance run from Monday to Thursday.**

Add up the distances from each day:
\[
\text{Total distance from Monday to Thursday} = 6 + 3 + 6 + 2 = 17 \text{ miles}
\]

**Step 3: Determine how many more miles Rosie needs to run to reach 20 miles.**

\[
\text{Miles needed on Friday} = 20 \text{ miles} - 17 \text{ miles} = 3 \text{ miles}
\]

**Step 4: Calculate the time Rosie needs to run on Friday to cover 3 miles.**

Since Rosie runs at a speed of 6 miles per hour, we use the formula:
\[
\text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{3 \text{ miles}}{6 \text{ miles/hour}} = 0.5 \text{ hours}
\]

**Step 5: Convert the time from hours to minutes.**

0.5 hours is equivalent to:
\[
0.5 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 30 \text{ minutes}
\]

Therefore, Rosie should run for **30 minutes** on Friday to reach her goal of 20 miles for the week.

**Final Answer:**
Rosie should run for 30 minutes on Friday.
