Question ID: 701
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to determine how many people are in Aiden's group, how many drinks and snacks they buy, and the total cost of those drinks and snacks.

### Step 1: Calculate the total number of people

Aiden has 12 friends and meets up with 7 more friends. Therefore, the total number of people in the group is:

\[
\text{Total people} = 1 \text{ (Aiden)} + 12 \text{ (friends)} + 7 \text{ (more friends)} = 20 \text{ people}
\]

### Step 2: Determine the number of drinks and snacks per person

According to the problem, each seat can hold:
- 1 person
- 2 drinks
- 3 snacks

### Step 3: Calculate the total number of drinks and snacks for the group

**Total drinks:**
Each person buys 2 drinks, so for 20 people, the total number of drinks is:

\[
\text{Total drinks} = 20 \text{ people} \times 2 \text{ drinks/person} = 40 \text{ drinks}
\]

**Total snacks:**
Each person buys 3 snacks, so for 20 people, the total number of snacks is:

\[
\text{Total snacks} = 20 \text{ people} \times 3 \text{ snacks/person} = 60 \text{ snacks}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the total cost of drinks and snacks

The cost of each drink and snack is $2. Therefore, we can calculate the total cost for drinks and snacks separately and then sum them up.

**Cost of drinks:**
\[
\text{Cost of drinks} = 40 \text{ drinks} \times 2 \text{ dollars/drink} = 80 \text{ dollars}
\]

**Cost of snacks:**
\[
\text{Cost of snacks} = 60 \text{ snacks} \times 2 \text{ dollars/snack} = 120 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Step 5: Calculate the overall total cost

Now, we add the total cost of drinks and snacks together:

\[
\text{Total cost} = \text{Cost of drinks} + \text{Cost of snacks} = 80 \text{ dollars} + 120 \text{ dollars} = 200 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Final Answer

The group has spent a total of **$200** on snacks and drinks.
