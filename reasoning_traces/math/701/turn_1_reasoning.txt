Question ID: 701
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we will follow these steps:

1. **Determine the total number of people in the group.**
2. **Calculate the total number of drinks and snacks needed.**
3. **Calculate the total cost of the drinks and snacks.**

### Step 1: Determine the total number of people

Aiden has 12 friends and meets 7 more friends at the cinema. Therefore, the total number of people in the group can be calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Total people} = 1 \text{ (Aiden)} + 12 \text{ (friends)} + 7 \text{ (more friends)} = 20
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the total number of drinks and snacks needed

Each person has a seat that can hold:
- 2 drinks
- 3 snacks

Now, we will calculate the total number of drinks and snacks for the entire group.

**Total drinks:**
\[
\text{Total drinks} = \text{Total people} \times \text{drinks per person} = 20 \times 2 = 40 \text{ drinks}
\]

**Total snacks:**
\[
\text{Total snacks} = \text{Total people} \times \text{snacks per person} = 20 \times 3 = 60 \text{ snacks}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the total cost of the drinks and snacks

The cost of each drink and each snack is $2. Therefore, we can calculate the total cost for drinks and snacks separately and then sum them up.

**Total cost for drinks:**
\[
\text{Total cost for drinks} = \text{Total drinks} \times \text{cost per drink} = 40 \times 2 = 80 \text{ dollars}
\]

**Total cost for snacks:**
\[
\text{Total cost for snacks} = \text{Total snacks} \times \text{cost per snack} = 60 \times 2 = 120 \text{ dollars}
\]

**Total cost for drinks and snacks:**
\[
\text{Total cost} = \text{Total cost for drinks} + \text{Total cost for snacks} = 80 + 120 = 200 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Final Answer

The group has spent a total of **200 dollars** on snacks and drinks.
