==================================================

To solve the problem, we will follow these steps:

1. **Determine the total number of people in the group.**
2. **Calculate the total number of drinks and snacks needed.**
3. **Calculate the total cost of the drinks and snacks.**

### Step 1: Determine the total number of people in the group.

Aiden has 12 friends, and they meet up with 7 more friends at the cinema. 

- Aiden: 1
- Friends: 12
- Additional friends: 7

Total number of people:
\[
1 + 12 + 7 = 20
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the total number of drinks and snacks needed.

Each person has a seat that can hold:
- 2 drinks
- 3 snacks

Now, we calculate the total number of drinks and snacks for 20 people.

**Total drinks:**
\[
20 \text{ people} \times 2 \text{ drinks/person} = 40 \text{ drinks}
\]

**Total snacks:**
\[
20 \text{ people} \times 3 \text{ snacks/person} = 60 \text{ snacks}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the total cost of the drinks and snacks.

The cost of each drink and each snack is $2.

**Total cost for drinks:**
\[
40 \text{ drinks} \times 2 \text{ dollars/drink} = 80 \text{ dollars}
\]

**Total cost for snacks:**
\[
60 \text{ snacks} \times 2 \text{ dollars/snack} = 120 \text{ dollars}
\]

Now, we add the total costs of drinks and snacks to find the overall expenditure.

**Total cost overall:**
\[
80 \text{ dollars (drinks)} + 120 \text{ dollars (snacks)} = 200 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Final Answer

The total amount of money the group has spent overall on snacks and drinks is:
\[
\boxed{200}
\]
