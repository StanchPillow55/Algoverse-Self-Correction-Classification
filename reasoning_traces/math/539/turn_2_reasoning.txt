Question ID: 539
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to break it down into steps:

1. **Determine the total dinner bill**: The dinner bill is given as $50.

2. **Calculate the tip**: The problem states that I need to pay an additional 20% tip on the dinner bill. To find the tip amount, we can use the formula:
   \[
   \text{Tip} = \text{Dinner Bill} \times \text{Tip Percentage}
   \]
   Here, the dinner bill is $50 and the tip percentage is 20%, which can be expressed as a decimal (0.20).

   So, we calculate the tip:
   \[
   \text{Tip} = 50 \times 0.20 = 10
   \]

3. **Calculate the total amount I will pay**: The total amount I will pay includes both the dinner bill and the tip. We can find this by adding the dinner bill and the tip together:
   \[
   \text{Total Amount Paid} = \text{Dinner Bill} + \text{Tip}
   \]
   Substituting the values we have:
   \[
   \text{Total Amount Paid} = 50 + 10 = 60
   \]

4. **Determine how much my wife pays**: Since my wife wants to evenly split the check, we need to divide the total amount paid by 2:
   \[
   \text{Wife's Share} = \frac{\text{Total Amount Paid}}{2} = \frac{60}{2} = 30
   \]

5. **Final Calculation**: Since I am paying the total amount of $60, we can summarize:
   - Dinner Bill: $50
   - Tip: $10
   - Total Amount Paid: $60
   - My Wife's Share: $30

Thus, the total amount I ended up paying is:
\[
\boxed{60}
\]
