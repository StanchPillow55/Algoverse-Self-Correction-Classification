==================================================

To determine how much you ended up paying for the dinner, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total dinner bill**: The dinner bill is given as $50.

2. **Calculate the tip**: Your wife wants you to pay an additional 20% tip on the dinner bill. To find the amount of the tip, we can use the formula for calculating a percentage:
   \[
   \text{Tip} = \text{Dinner Bill} \times \text{Tip Percentage}
   \]
   Here, the tip percentage is 20%, which can be expressed as a decimal (0.20). Therefore:
   \[
   \text{Tip} = 50 \times 0.20 = 10
   \]

3. **Calculate the total amount paid**: Now, we need to add the tip to the original dinner bill to find the total amount you will pay:
   \[
   \text{Total Amount Paid} = \text{Dinner Bill} + \text{Tip}
   \]
   Substituting the values we have:
   \[
   \text{Total Amount Paid} = 50 + 10 = 60
   \]

4. **Evenly split the check**: Since your wife wants to evenly split the check, we can find out how much each of you would pay. However, since you are the one paying the entire amount including the tip, you will pay the total amount calculated above.

Thus, the final amount you end up paying is:
\[
\text{Final Amount Paid} = 60
\]

Therefore, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{60}
\]
