==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to break it down into clear steps. 

1. **Determine the total dinner bill**: The dinner bill is given as $50.

2. **Calculate the tip**: Your wife wants you to pay an additional 20% tip on the dinner bill. To find the amount of the tip, we can use the formula for calculating a percentage:

   \[
   \text{Tip} = \text{Dinner Bill} \times \text{Tip Percentage}
   \]

   Here, the tip percentage is 20%, which can be expressed as a decimal (0.20). Therefore, we calculate the tip as follows:

   \[
   \text{Tip} = 50 \times 0.20 = 10
   \]

3. **Calculate the total amount you will pay**: Now that we have the tip amount, we need to find the total amount you will pay, which includes the dinner bill plus the tip:

   \[
   \text{Total Amount Paid} = \text{Dinner Bill} + \text{Tip}
   \]

   Substituting the values we have:

   \[
   \text{Total Amount Paid} = 50 + 10 = 60
   \]

4. **Determine how much your wife pays**: Since your wife wants to evenly split the check, we need to divide the total amount paid by 2:

   \[
   \text{Wife's Share} = \frac{\text{Total Amount Paid}}{2} = \frac{60}{2} = 30
   \]

5. **Final Calculation**: Since you are paying the entire bill plus the tip, the total amount you end up paying is:

   \[
   \text{Your Total Payment} = 60
   \]

Thus, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{60}
\] 

You ended up paying $60 in total for the dinner and the tip.
