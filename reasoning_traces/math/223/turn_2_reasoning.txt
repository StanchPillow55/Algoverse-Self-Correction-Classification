==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine the cost of Bob's fruit drink. We know that Andy and Bob spent the same amount of money, so we can set up an equation based on their purchases.

**Step 1: Calculate Andy's total spending.**

Andy bought:
- 1 can of soda at $1
- 2 hamburgers at $2 each

Let's calculate the total cost for Andy:
- Cost of soda = $1
- Cost of hamburgers = 2 hamburgers × $2/hamburger = $4

Total cost for Andy = Cost of soda + Cost of hamburgers  
Total cost for Andy = $1 + $4 = $5

**Step 2: Set up the equation for Bob's spending.**

Bob bought:
- 2 sandwiches at $3 each
- 1 can of fruit drink (unknown cost)

Let's denote the cost of the fruit drink as \( x \).

The total cost for Bob is:
- Cost of sandwiches = 2 sandwiches × $3/sandwich = $6
- Cost of fruit drink = \( x \)

Total cost for Bob = Cost of sandwiches + Cost of fruit drink  
Total cost for Bob = $6 + \( x \)

**Step 3: Set up the equation based on the information that Andy and Bob spent the same amount.**

Since Andy and Bob spent the same amount, we can set their total costs equal to each other:
\[ 5 = 6 + x \]

**Step 4: Solve for \( x \).**

To find the value of \( x \), we solve the equation:
\[ 5 = 6 + x \]

Subtract 6 from both sides to isolate \( x \):
\[ 5 - 6 = x \]

\[ -1 = x \]

This result, \( x = -1 \), suggests that the cost of Bob's fruit drink is negative, which is not possible in a real-world scenario. Let's re-evaluate the problem to ensure there are no errors in the setup.

Upon reviewing the problem, all calculations and logic appear correct. The negative result indicates that there might be an error in the problem statement or assumptions. In a real-world context, the cost of an item cannot be negative, so the problem as presented may not have a feasible solution based on the given information.

**Final Answer:**
The problem as stated leads to an impossible scenario where the cost of Bob's fruit drink would be negative. Therefore, there is likely an error in the problem setup or assumptions.
