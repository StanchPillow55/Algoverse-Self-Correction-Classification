Question ID: 223
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to determine how much Bob's fruit drink cost, given that Andy and Bob spent the same total amount at the canteen.

### Step 1: Calculate Andy's Total Spending
Andy bought:
- 1 can of soda for $1
- 2 hamburgers at $2 each

First, we calculate the cost of the hamburgers:
\[
\text{Cost of hamburgers} = 2 \times 2 = 4 \text{ dollars}
\]

Now, we add the cost of the soda to the total cost of the hamburgers:
\[
\text{Total cost for Andy} = \text{Cost of soda} + \text{Cost of hamburgers} = 1 + 4 = 5 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Step 2: Set Up the Equation for Bob's Spending
Bob bought:
- 2 sandwiches for $3 each
- 1 can of fruit drink (let's denote the cost of the fruit drink as \( x \))

First, we calculate the cost of the sandwiches:
\[
\text{Cost of sandwiches} = 2 \times 3 = 6 \text{ dollars}
\]

Now, we can express Bob's total spending as:
\[
\text{Total cost for Bob} = \text{Cost of sandwiches} + \text{Cost of fruit drink} = 6 + x
\]

### Step 3: Set the Total Costs Equal
Since Andy and Bob spent the same amount, we can set their total costs equal to each other:
\[
5 = 6 + x
\]

### Step 4: Solve for \( x \)
To find \( x \), we rearrange the equation:
\[
x = 5 - 6
\]
\[
x = -1
\]

### Step 5: Interpret the Result
The result \( x = -1 \) indicates that there is a contradiction in the problem, as the cost of an item cannot be negative. This suggests that there might be an error in the assumptions or the problem setup.

### Conclusion
Given the calculations, it appears that Bob's fruit drink cannot have a valid positive cost under the current assumptions. Therefore, we conclude that there is no valid solution for the cost of Bob's fruit drink based on the provided information.

Final answer: The cost of Bob's fruit drink cannot be determined as a valid positive amount based on the given conditions.
