Turn: 1

==================================================

To find out how much Bob's fruit drink cost, we first need to calculate how much Andy spent on his snacks.

1. **Calculate Andy's total expenditure:**
   - Andy bought:
     - 1 can of soda for $1
     - 2 hamburgers at $2 each

   The cost of the hamburgers can be calculated as follows:
   \[
   \text{Cost of hamburgers} = 2 \times 2 = 4 \text{ dollars}
   \]

   Now, we can find Andy's total spending:
   \[
   \text{Total spent by Andy} = \text{Cost of soda} + \text{Cost of hamburgers} = 1 + 4 = 5 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Determine Bob's total expenditure:**
   - Bob bought:
     - 2 sandwiches for $3 each
     - 1 can of fruit drink (which we need to find out the cost of)

   The cost of the sandwiches can be calculated as follows:
   \[
   \text{Cost of sandwiches} = 2 \times 3 = 6 \text{ dollars}
   \]

   Let \( x \) be the cost of the fruit drink. Therefore, Bob's total expenditure can be expressed as:
   \[
   \text{Total spent by Bob} = \text{Cost of sandwiches} + \text{Cost of fruit drink} = 6 + x
   \]

3. **Set up the equation:**
   Since Andy and Bob spent the same amount, we can set their total expenditures equal to each other:
   \[
   5 = 6 + x
   \]

4. **Solve for \( x \):**
   To isolate \( x \), we subtract 6 from both sides:
   \[
   5 - 6 = x \implies -1 = x
   \]

   This means:
   \[
   x = -1
   \]

However, a negative cost does not make sense in this context. Let's re-evaluate the problem step by step to ensure we haven't made any mistakes.

- Andy's total: \( 1 + 4 = 5 \)
- Bob's total: \( 6 + x \)

Setting them equal:
\[
5 = 6 + x
\]
Subtracting 6 from both sides gives:
\[
5 - 6 = x \implies -1 = x
\]

This indicates that there is an inconsistency in the problem as stated. 

Since the calculations are correct based on the information given, we conclude that Bob's fruit drink cannot have a negative cost. 

Thus, the problem may have an error in the provided costs or quantities. 

**Final Answer:**
Bob's fruit drink cost is not valid based on the given information, as it results in a negative value.
