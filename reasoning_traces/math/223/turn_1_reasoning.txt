==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine the cost of Bob's fruit drink. We know that Andy and Bob spent the same amount of money, so we can set up an equation based on their purchases.

**Step 1: Calculate Andy's total spending.**

Andy bought:
- 1 can of soda at $1
- 2 hamburgers at $2 each

The total cost for Andy is calculated as follows:
\[
\text{Cost of soda} = 1 \times 1 = 1 \text{ dollar}
\]
\[
\text{Cost of hamburgers} = 2 \times 2 = 4 \text{ dollars}
\]
\[
\text{Total cost for Andy} = 1 + 4 = 5 \text{ dollars}
\]

**Step 2: Set up the equation for Bob's spending.**

Bob bought:
- 2 sandwiches at $3 each
- 1 can of fruit drink (cost unknown, let's call it \( x \))

The total cost for Bob is:
\[
\text{Cost of sandwiches} = 2 \times 3 = 6 \text{ dollars}
\]
\[
\text{Total cost for Bob} = 6 + x \text{ dollars}
\]

**Step 3: Set up the equation based on the fact that Andy and Bob spent the same amount.**

Since Andy and Bob spent the same amount, we have:
\[
5 = 6 + x
\]

**Step 4: Solve for \( x \).**

To find the cost of the fruit drink, solve the equation:
\[
5 = 6 + x
\]
Subtract 6 from both sides to isolate \( x \):
\[
5 - 6 = x
\]
\[
x = -1
\]

**Step 5: Analyze the result.**

The result \( x = -1 \) suggests that there might be an error in the problem setup or assumptions, as a cost cannot be negative. Let's re-evaluate the problem:

- Andy's total spending was calculated correctly as $5.
- Bob's total spending was calculated as \( 6 + x \).

Given that Andy and Bob spent the same amount, the equation \( 5 = 6 + x \) should hold true. However, the negative result indicates a contradiction.

**Conclusion:**

Upon reviewing the problem, the negative result suggests that there might be a mistake in the problem statement or assumptions. If the problem is stated correctly, then the only logical conclusion is that the cost of Bob's fruit drink is indeed negative, which is not possible in a real-world scenario. Therefore, the problem as stated does not have a valid solution under normal circumstances.

Final Answer: The problem as stated does not have a valid solution.
