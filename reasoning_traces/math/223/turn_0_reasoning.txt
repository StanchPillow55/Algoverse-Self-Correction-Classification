To solve this problem, we need to determine the cost of Bob's fruit drink, given that Andy and Bob spent the same amount of money.

First, let's calculate how much Andy spent:

1. Andy bought a can of soda for $1.
2. Andy also bought two hamburgers, each costing $2. Therefore, the total cost for the hamburgers is:
   \[
   2 \text{ hamburgers} \times \$2/\text{hamburger} = \$4
   \]

Adding these together, the total amount Andy spent is:
\[
\$1 + \$4 = \$5
\]

Next, let's calculate how much Bob spent. We know that Bob spent the same amount as Andy, which is $5.

1. Bob bought two sandwiches, each costing $3. Therefore, the total cost for the sandwiches is:
   \[
   2 \text{ sandwiches} \times \$3/\text{sandwich} = \$6
   \]

2. Bob also bought a can of fruit drink, which we will denote as \( x \) dollars.

Since Andy and Bob spent the same amount, we can set up the equation for Bob's total spending:
\[
6 + x = 5
\]

Now, solve for \( x \) to find the cost of the fruit drink:
\[
6 + x = 5
\]

Subtract 6 from both sides to isolate \( x \):
\[
x = 5 - 6
\]
\[
x = -1
\]

However, a negative cost does not make sense in this context. Let's re-evaluate the setup:

Upon reviewing, we see that the equation should reflect the fact that Bob's total spending (sandwiches plus the drink) equals Andy's total spending. Since Andy spent $5, and Bob's sandwiches alone cost $6, there is an inconsistency. This indicates that there might be an error in the problem statement or assumptions, as the cost of the fruit drink cannot be negative or zero.

Given the problem constraints, if we assume the problem is correct, the only logical conclusion is that the fruit drink cost is $0, which would make Bob's total spending $6, not matching Andy's $5. Therefore, the problem as stated seems to have an inconsistency.

Thus, based on the given information and assuming the problem setup is correct, the cost of Bob's fruit drink should be:
\[
\boxed{-1}
\]

However, this result indicates an error in the problem setup, as a negative cost is not feasible.
