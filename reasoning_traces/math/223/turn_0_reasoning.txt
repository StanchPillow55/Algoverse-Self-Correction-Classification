==================================================

To find out how much Bob's fruit drink cost, we first need to calculate how much Andy spent on his snacks.

1. **Calculate Andy's total expenditure:**
   - Andy bought:
     - 1 can of soda for $1
     - 2 hamburgers at $2 each

   We can calculate the total cost of the hamburgers:
   \[
   \text{Cost of hamburgers} = 2 \text{ hamburgers} \times 2 \text{ dollars/hamburger} = 4 \text{ dollars}
   \]

   Now, we can find Andy's total expenditure by adding the cost of the soda and the hamburgers:
   \[
   \text{Total cost for Andy} = \text{Cost of soda} + \text{Cost of hamburgers} = 1 \text{ dollar} + 4 \text{ dollars} = 5 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Determine Bob's total expenditure:**
   - Bob ordered:
     - 2 sandwiches for $3 each
     - 1 can of fruit drink (cost unknown)

   First, we calculate the total cost of the sandwiches:
   \[
   \text{Cost of sandwiches} = 2 \text{ sandwiches} \times 3 \text{ dollars/sandwich} = 6 \text{ dollars}
   \]

   Let \( x \) be the cost of Bob's fruit drink. Therefore, Bob's total expenditure can be expressed as:
   \[
   \text{Total cost for Bob} = \text{Cost of sandwiches} + \text{Cost of fruit drink} = 6 \text{ dollars} + x
   \]

3. **Set up the equation:**
   Since Andy and Bob spent the same amount, we can set their total expenditures equal to each other:
   \[
   5 \text{ dollars} = 6 \text{ dollars} + x
   \]

4. **Solve for \( x \):**
   To find \( x \), we can rearrange the equation:
   \[
   x = 5 \text{ dollars} - 6 \text{ dollars}
   \]
   \[
   x = -1 \text{ dollar}
   \]

Since a negative cost does not make sense in this context, we must have made an error in our assumption. Let's re-evaluate the situation.

5. **Reassess the problem:**
   We know that Bob's total expenditure must equal Andy's total expenditure of $5. Therefore, we should set up the equation correctly:
   \[
   6 + x = 5
   \]
   Rearranging gives:
   \[
   x = 5 - 6
   \]
   \[
   x = -1
   \]

This indicates that Bob's fruit drink cannot be negative, which suggests that the total cost of Bob's items must be less than Andy's total expenditure. 

6. **Conclusion:**
   Since Bob's total expenditure must equal Andy's, and we found that the cost of the fruit drink would need to be negative to balance the equation, it implies that there is an inconsistency in the problem as stated. 

Thus, the only logical conclusion is that Bob's fruit drink must have been free or that there was an error in the problem setup. 

Final answer: Bob's fruit drink cost **$0** (it was free).
