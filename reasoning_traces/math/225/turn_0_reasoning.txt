==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of water used for all the laundry loads, taking into account the different types of washes and the additional light wash cycles for the loads that require bleach.

### Step-by-step Calculation:

1. **Calculate Water for Heavy Washes:**
   - Each heavy wash uses 20 gallons of water.
   - There are 2 heavy washes.
   - Total water for heavy washes = \(2 \times 20 = 40\) gallons.

2. **Calculate Water for Regular Washes:**
   - Each regular wash uses 10 gallons of water.
   - There are 3 regular washes.
   - Total water for regular washes = \(3 \times 10 = 30\) gallons.

3. **Calculate Water for Light Washes:**
   - Each light wash uses 2 gallons of water.
   - There is 1 light wash.
   - Total water for light washes = \(1 \times 2 = 2\) gallons.

4. **Calculate Additional Water for Bleach Loads:**
   - Bleach loads require an additional light wash cycle, which uses 2 gallons of water.
   - There are 2 loads that need to be bleached.
   - Additional water for bleach loads = \(2 \times 2 = 4\) gallons.

5. **Calculate Total Water Used:**
   - Add up all the water used for each type of wash and the additional water for bleach loads:
   \[
   \text{Total water used} = 40 \text{ (heavy washes)} + 30 \text{ (regular washes)} + 2 \text{ (light wash)} + 4 \text{ (bleach loads)} = 76 \text{ gallons}
   \]

### Final Answer:
The total amount of water needed for all the laundry loads is **76 gallons**.
