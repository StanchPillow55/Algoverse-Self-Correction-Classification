To solve the problem, we need to determine the total number of days Andrew will spend traveling to Rochester by bus and returning by car.

1. **Traveling to Rochester by Bus:**
   - According to the problem, it takes Andrew 6 days to travel from New Jersey to Rochester by bus.

2. **Traveling back from Rochester by Car:**
   - The problem states that it takes half as many days to travel by car as it does by bus. Since it takes 6 days by bus, we calculate the time taken by car as follows:
     \[
     \text{Days by car} = \frac{6 \text{ days}}{2} = 3 \text{ days}
     \]

3. **Total Travel Days:**
   - Now, we need to find the total number of days Andrew will spend traveling. This is the sum of the days spent traveling to Rochester by bus and the days spent returning by car:
     \[
     \text{Total days} = \text{Days by bus} + \text{Days by car} = 6 \text{ days} + 3 \text{ days} = 9 \text{ days}
     \]

Thus, the total number of days Andrew will travel is:

\[
\boxed{9}
\]
