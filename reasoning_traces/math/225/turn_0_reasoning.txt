To determine the total amount of water needed for the laundry loads, we will break down the problem step by step, calculating the water usage for each type of wash and accounting for the additional rinse cycles required when bleach is used.

### Step 1: Calculate the water usage for each type of wash

1. **Heavy Wash**: 
   - Water used per heavy wash = 20 gallons
   - Number of heavy washes = 2
   - Total water for heavy washes = \( 20 \, \text{gallons} \times 2 = 40 \, \text{gallons} \)

2. **Regular Wash**: 
   - Water used per regular wash = 10 gallons
   - Number of regular washes = 3
   - Total water for regular washes = \( 10 \, \text{gallons} \times 3 = 30 \, \text{gallons} \)

3. **Light Wash**: 
   - Water used per light wash = 2 gallons
   - Number of light washes = 1
   - Total water for light washes = \( 2 \, \text{gallons} \times 1 = 2 \, \text{gallons} \)

### Step 2: Calculate the total water usage without bleach

Now, we will sum the total water usage for all the washes without considering the bleach yet:

\[
\text{Total water without bleach} = \text{Total heavy washes} + \text{Total regular washes} + \text{Total light washes}
\]
\[
\text{Total water without bleach} = 40 \, \text{gallons} + 30 \, \text{gallons} + 2 \, \text{gallons} = 72 \, \text{gallons}
\]

### Step 3: Account for the bleach usage

Since two of the loads need to be bleached, we need to add an extra light wash cycle for each of these loads. Each light wash uses 2 gallons of water.

- Number of additional light washes due to bleach = 2 (one for each of the two bleached loads)
- Total water for additional light washes = \( 2 \, \text{gallons} \times 2 = 4 \, \text{gallons} \)

### Step 4: Calculate the total water usage including bleach

Now we will add the water used for the additional light washes to the total water used without bleach:

\[
\text{Total water with bleach} = \text{Total water without bleach} + \text{Total water for additional light washes}
\]
\[
\text{Total water with bleach} = 72 \, \text{gallons} + 4 \, \text{gallons} = 76 \, \text{gallons}
\]

### Final Answer

The total amount of water needed for all the laundry loads, including the additional rinses for the bleached loads, is:

\[
\boxed{76} \, \text{gallons}
\]
