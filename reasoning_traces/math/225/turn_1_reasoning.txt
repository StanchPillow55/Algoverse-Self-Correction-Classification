==================================================

To find the total amount of water needed for the washing machine loads, we will break down the problem step by step.

### Step 1: Determine the water usage for each type of wash.

- **Heavy wash**: 20 gallons
- **Regular wash**: 10 gallons
- **Light wash**: 2 gallons

### Step 2: Calculate the water needed for the specified loads.

We have:
- **2 heavy washes**
- **3 regular washes**
- **1 light wash**

Let's calculate the total water usage for these loads without considering the bleach first.

1. **Water for heavy washes**:
   \[
   \text{Water for heavy washes} = 2 \text{ loads} \times 20 \text{ gallons/load} = 40 \text{ gallons}
   \]

2. **Water for regular washes**:
   \[
   \text{Water for regular washes} = 3 \text{ loads} \times 10 \text{ gallons/load} = 30 \text{ gallons}
   \]

3. **Water for light wash**:
   \[
   \text{Water for light wash} = 1 \text{ load} \times 2 \text{ gallons/load} = 2 \text{ gallons}
   \]

### Step 3: Calculate the total water usage without bleach.

Now, we add the water usage from all the loads:
\[
\text{Total water without bleach} = 40 \text{ gallons} + 30 \text{ gallons} + 2 \text{ gallons} = 72 \text{ gallons}
\]

### Step 4: Consider the additional light wash due to bleach.

Since two of the loads need to be bleached, each of these loads will require an additional light wash cycle. Therefore, we need to account for 2 extra light washes.

1. **Water for additional light washes**:
   \[
   \text{Water for additional light washes} = 2 \text{ loads} \times 2 \text{ gallons/load} = 4 \text{ gallons}
   \]

### Step 5: Calculate the total water usage including bleach.

Now, we add the water needed for the additional light washes to the total water calculated earlier:
\[
\text{Total water with bleach} = 72 \text{ gallons} + 4 \text{ gallons} = 76 \text{ gallons}
\]

### Final Answer

The total amount of water needed for all the washes, including the additional light washes due to bleach, is:
\[
\boxed{76} \text{ gallons}
\]
