==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 72," we need to first understand what the problem is asking. However, the phrase "Sample math problem 72" is not a complete math problem by itself. It seems like a placeholder or a reference to a specific problem that isn't fully described here.

Since the problem isn't explicitly stated, I'll demonstrate how to solve a hypothetical math problem involving the number 72. Let's assume the problem is as follows:

**Problem:** Find the prime factorization of 72.

**Step-by-step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   We need to express 72 as a product of prime numbers. Prime factorization involves breaking down a composite number into its prime factors.

2. **Start with the Smallest Prime:**
   Begin with the smallest prime number, which is 2. Check if 72 is divisible by 2.

   \[
   72 \div 2 = 36
   \]

   Since 72 is divisible by 2, we write:

   \[
   72 = 2 \times 36
   \]

3. **Continue Factoring 36:**
   Now, factor 36, starting again with the smallest prime number, 2.

   \[
   36 \div 2 = 18
   \]

   So, we have:

   \[
   36 = 2 \times 18
   \]

   Therefore, substituting back, we get:

   \[
   72 = 2 \times 2 \times 18
   \]

4. **Factor 18:**
   Continue factoring 18 by 2.

   \[
   18 \div 2 = 9
   \]

   So, we have:

   \[
   18 = 2 \times 9
   \]

   Substituting back, we get:

   \[
   72 = 2 \times 2 \times 2 \times 9
   \]

5. **Factor 9:**
   Now, factor 9. The smallest prime number that divides 9 is 3.

   \[
   9 \div 3 = 3
   \]

   So, we have:

   \[
   9 = 3 \times 3
   \]

   Substituting back, we get:

   \[
   72 = 2 \times 2 \times 2 \times 3 \times 3
   \]

6. **Write the Prime Factorization:**
   The prime factorization of 72 is:

   \[
   72 = 2^3 \times 3^2
   \]

**Final Answer:**
The prime factorization of 72 is \(2^3 \times 3^2\).
