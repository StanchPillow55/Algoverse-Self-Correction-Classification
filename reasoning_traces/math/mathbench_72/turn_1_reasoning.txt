==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample math problem 72" refers to. Since there is no specific problem statement provided, I'll assume that "Sample math problem 72" is a placeholder for a typical math problem. Let's create a sample math problem involving the number 72 and solve it step by step.

**Sample Math Problem:**

Find the prime factorization of 72, and then determine the number of positive divisors of 72.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Prime Factorization of 72:**

   To find the prime factorization of 72, we start by dividing 72 by the smallest prime number, which is 2, and continue dividing the quotient by 2 until it is no longer divisible by 2. Then, we move to the next smallest prime number.

   - \(72 \div 2 = 36\)
   - \(36 \div 2 = 18\)
   - \(18 \div 2 = 9\)

   At this point, 9 is not divisible by 2, so we move to the next smallest prime number, which is 3.

   - \(9 \div 3 = 3\)
   - \(3 \div 3 = 1\)

   Now, we have reached 1, and the division process stops. The prime factorization of 72 is the product of all the prime numbers we used to divide:

   \[
   72 = 2^3 \times 3^2
   \]

2. **Finding the Number of Positive Divisors:**

   To find the number of positive divisors of a number given its prime factorization, we use the formula that involves adding 1 to each of the exponents in the prime factorization and then multiplying the results.

   The prime factorization of 72 is \(2^3 \times 3^2\).

   - The exponent of 2 is 3, so we add 1 to get 4.
   - The exponent of 3 is 2, so we add 1 to get 3.

   Multiply these results together to find the total number of divisors:

   \[
   (3 + 1) \times (2 + 1) = 4 \times 3 = 12
   \]

   Therefore, 72 has 12 positive divisors.

**Final Answer:**

The prime factorization of 72 is \(2^3 \times 3^2\), and the number of positive divisors of 72 is 12.
