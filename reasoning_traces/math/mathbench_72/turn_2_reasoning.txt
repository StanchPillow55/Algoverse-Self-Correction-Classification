Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we first need to understand what "Sample math problem 72" refers to. Since the problem isn't explicitly stated, I'll assume it's a generic math problem involving the number 72. Let's consider a few possibilities and solve them:

### Problem 1: Find the Prime Factorization of 72

**Step 1: Divide by the smallest prime number, 2.**

72 is an even number, so we start by dividing by 2:

\[ 72 \div 2 = 36 \]

**Step 2: Continue dividing by 2.**

36 is also even, so we divide by 2 again:

\[ 36 \div 2 = 18 \]

18 is even, so we divide by 2 once more:

\[ 18 \div 2 = 9 \]

**Step 3: Divide by the next smallest prime number, 3.**

9 is not divisible by 2, so we try the next smallest prime number, which is 3:

\[ 9 \div 3 = 3 \]

3 is a prime number, so we divide by 3 one last time:

\[ 3 \div 3 = 1 \]

**Step 4: Write the prime factorization.**

The prime factorization of 72 is:

\[ 72 = 2^3 \times 3^2 \]

### Problem 2: Calculate the Sum of the Divisors of 72

**Step 1: List the divisors.**

Using the prime factorization \( 72 = 2^3 \times 3^2 \), we can find the divisors by considering all combinations of these factors:

- \( 2^0 \times 3^0 = 1 \)
- \( 2^1 \times 3^0 = 2 \)
- \( 2^2 \times 3^0 = 4 \)
- \( 2^3 \times 3^0 = 8 \)
- \( 2^0 \times 3^1 = 3 \)
- \( 2^1 \times 3^1 = 6 \)
- \( 2^2 \times 3^1 = 12 \)
- \( 2^3 \times 3^1 = 24 \)
- \( 2^0 \times 3^2 = 9 \)
- \( 2^1 \times 3^2 = 18 \)
- \( 2^2 \times 3^2 = 36 \)
- \( 2^3 \times 3^2 = 72 \)

The divisors of 72 are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 12, 18, 24, 36, 72.

**Step 2: Sum the divisors.**

Add up all the divisors:

\[ 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 6 + 8 + 9 + 12 + 18 + 24 + 36 + 72 = 195 \]

### Final Answer

For Problem 1, the prime factorization of 72 is \( 2^3 \times 3^2 \).

For Problem 2, the sum of the divisors of 72 is 195.
