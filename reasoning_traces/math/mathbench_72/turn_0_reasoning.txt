==================================================

To solve the problem, we first need to understand what "Sample math problem 72" refers to. Since there is no specific problem provided, I'll assume it might be a placeholder for a typical math problem. Let's create a sample problem involving the number 72 and solve it step by step.

**Sample Problem:**
Find the prime factorization of 72, and then determine the least common multiple (LCM) of 72 and another number, say 48.

**Step 1: Prime Factorization of 72**

To find the prime factorization of 72, we start by dividing it by the smallest prime number, which is 2, and continue dividing by prime numbers until we reach 1.

1. \( 72 \div 2 = 36 \)
2. \( 36 \div 2 = 18 \)
3. \( 18 \div 2 = 9 \)
4. \( 9 \div 3 = 3 \)
5. \( 3 \div 3 = 1 \)

So, the prime factorization of 72 is \( 2^3 \times 3^2 \).

**Step 2: Prime Factorization of 48**

Similarly, we find the prime factorization of 48.

1. \( 48 \div 2 = 24 \)
2. \( 24 \div 2 = 12 \)
3. \( 12 \div 2 = 6 \)
4. \( 6 \div 2 = 3 \)
5. \( 3 \div 3 = 1 \)

So, the prime factorization of 48 is \( 2^4 \times 3^1 \).

**Step 3: Find the Least Common Multiple (LCM)**

To find the LCM of 72 and 48, we take the highest power of each prime number that appears in their factorizations.

- For the prime number 2, the highest power is \( 2^4 \) (from 48).
- For the prime number 3, the highest power is \( 3^2 \) (from 72).

Thus, the LCM is:

\[
LCM = 2^4 \times 3^2 = 16 \times 9 = 144
\]

**Final Answer:**

The least common multiple of 72 and 48 is 144.
