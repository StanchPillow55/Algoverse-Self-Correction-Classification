It seems like the problem statement "Sample math problem 72" is not clear or complete. To provide a thorough solution, I need a specific math problem or question to work on. However, I can create a sample math problem involving the number 72 and solve it step by step. Let's consider the following problem:

**Problem:**
Find the prime factorization of 72 and use it to determine the number of divisors of 72.

**Solution:**

**Step 1: Prime Factorization of 72**

To find the prime factorization of 72, we start by dividing 72 by the smallest prime number, which is 2.

1. \( 72 \div 2 = 36 \)

Since 36 is also even, we continue dividing by 2.

2. \( 36 \div 2 = 18 \)

18 is still even, so we divide by 2 again.

3. \( 18 \div 2 = 9 \)

Now, 9 is not divisible by 2, so we move to the next smallest prime number, which is 3.

4. \( 9 \div 3 = 3 \)

Finally, 3 is divisible by 3.

5. \( 3 \div 3 = 1 \)

Now we have reached 1, so the division process stops here. The prime factorization of 72 is:

\[ 72 = 2^3 \times 3^2 \]

**Step 2: Determine the Number of Divisors**

To find the number of divisors of a number using its prime factorization, we use the formula:

If the prime factorization of a number \( n \) is \( p_1^{a_1} \times p_2^{a_2} \times \ldots \times p_k^{a_k} \), then the number of divisors \( D(n) \) is given by:

\[ D(n) = (a_1 + 1)(a_2 + 1) \ldots (a_k + 1) \]

For 72, the prime factorization is \( 2^3 \times 3^2 \).

- The exponent of 2 is 3, so \( a_1 = 3 \).
- The exponent of 3 is 2, so \( a_2 = 2 \).

Applying the formula:

\[ D(72) = (3 + 1)(2 + 1) = 4 \times 3 = 12 \]

**Final Answer:**

The prime factorization of 72 is \( 2^3 \times 3^2 \), and the number of divisors of 72 is 12.
