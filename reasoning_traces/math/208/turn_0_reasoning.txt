To solve this problem, we need to calculate how much money John saved in his piggy bank over the 2-year period and then subtract the amount he spent on car repairs.

**Step 1: Calculate the total savings over 2 years.**

John saves $25 every month. There are 12 months in a year, so over 2 years, the total number of months is:

\[ 2 \text{ years} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 24 \text{ months} \]

Now, calculate the total amount saved over these 24 months:

\[ 25 \text{ dollars/month} \times 24 \text{ months} = 600 \text{ dollars} \]

**Step 2: Subtract the amount spent on car repairs.**

John spent $400 on car repairs. We need to subtract this amount from his total savings:

\[ 600 \text{ dollars (total savings)} - 400 \text{ dollars (spent on car repairs)} = 200 \text{ dollars} \]

**Final Answer:**

After spending $400 on car repairs, John has $200 left in his piggy bank.
