==================================================

To determine how much money John has left in his piggy bank after saving for 2 years and spending $400, we can break the problem down into a few steps.

### Step 1: Calculate Total Savings Over 2 Years

John saves $25 every month. To find out how much he saves in 2 years, we first need to calculate the total number of months in 2 years.

\[
\text{Number of months in 2 years} = 2 \text{ years} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 24 \text{ months}
\]

Now, we can calculate the total amount saved over these 24 months:

\[
\text{Total savings} = \text{Monthly savings} \times \text{Number of months}
\]
\[
\text{Total savings} = 25 \text{ dollars/month} \times 24 \text{ months} = 600 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Step 2: Subtract the Amount Spent

John spent $400 from his savings to repair his car. We need to subtract this amount from his total savings to find out how much he has left.

\[
\text{Amount left} = \text{Total savings} - \text{Amount spent}
\]
\[
\text{Amount left} = 600 \text{ dollars} - 400 \text{ dollars} = 200 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Final Answer

After saving for 2 years and spending $400, John has **$200** left in his piggy bank.
