==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to calculate how much money John has saved in his piggy bank over the 2-year period, and then subtract the amount he spent on car repairs. Let's break it down step by step:

### Step 1: Calculate Total Savings Over 2 Years

1. **Monthly Savings**: John saves $25 every month.
2. **Duration**: He saves for 2 years.

Since there are 12 months in a year, the total number of months over 2 years is:
\[ 2 \text{ years} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 24 \text{ months} \]

3. **Total Savings Calculation**:
   \[
   \text{Total savings} = \text{Monthly savings} \times \text{Number of months}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total savings} = 25 \text{ dollars/month} \times 24 \text{ months} = 600 \text{ dollars}
   \]

### Step 2: Subtract the Amount Spent on Car Repairs

John spent $400 from his savings to repair his car. We need to subtract this amount from his total savings:

\[
\text{Remaining savings} = \text{Total savings} - \text{Amount spent on car repairs}
\]
\[
\text{Remaining savings} = 600 \text{ dollars} - 400 \text{ dollars} = 200 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Final Answer

After spending $400 on car repairs, John has $200 left in his piggy bank.

\[
\boxed{200 \text{ dollars}}
\]
