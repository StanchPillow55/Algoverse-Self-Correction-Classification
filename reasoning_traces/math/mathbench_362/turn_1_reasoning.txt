==================================================

To solve the problem, we first need to understand what "Sample math problem 362" refers to. Since there is no specific problem statement provided, I'll assume this is a placeholder for a generic math problem. Let's create a sample problem and solve it step by step.

**Sample Math Problem 362:**

**Problem Statement:**
Solve for \( x \) in the equation: 
\[ 3x + 5 = 20 \]

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Equation:**
   The equation given is a linear equation in one variable, \( x \). Our goal is to isolate \( x \) on one side of the equation to find its value.

2. **Isolate the Variable:**
   To isolate \( x \), we need to perform operations that will leave \( x \) by itself on one side of the equation.

   - Start with the equation:
     \[ 3x + 5 = 20 \]

   - Subtract 5 from both sides to eliminate the constant term on the left side:
     \[ 3x + 5 - 5 = 20 - 5 \]
     \[ 3x = 15 \]

3. **Solve for \( x \):**
   Now, we need to solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides of the equation by 3, which is the coefficient of \( x \).

   - Divide both sides by 3:
     \[ \frac{3x}{3} = \frac{15}{3} \]
     \[ x = 5 \]

4. **Verify the Solution:**
   Substitute \( x = 5 \) back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies the equation.

   - Substitute \( x = 5 \) into \( 3x + 5 = 20 \):
     \[ 3(5) + 5 = 20 \]
     \[ 15 + 5 = 20 \]
     \[ 20 = 20 \]

   The left side equals the right side, confirming that our solution is correct.

**Final Answer:**
The solution to the equation \( 3x + 5 = 20 \) is \( x = 5 \).
