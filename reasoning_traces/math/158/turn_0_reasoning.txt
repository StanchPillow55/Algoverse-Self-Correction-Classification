To determine how long Jerome will ride on the 13th day to complete his 150-mile bicycle trip, we can break down the problem step by step.

1. **Calculate the total distance Jerome plans to ride in the first 12 days:**
   Jerome plans to ride 12 miles each day for 12 days. We can calculate the total distance he will ride in those 12 days as follows:

   \[
   \text{Total distance in 12 days} = \text{miles per day} \times \text{number of days} = 12 \text{ miles/day} \times 12 \text{ days}
   \]

   \[
   \text{Total distance in 12 days} = 144 \text{ miles}
   \]

2. **Calculate the remaining distance to reach his goal:**
   Jerome's goal is to complete a 150-mile trip. After riding 144 miles in the first 12 days, we can find out how much distance he has left to ride on the 13th day:

   \[
   \text{Remaining distance} = \text{Total goal} - \text{Distance ridden in 12 days} = 150 \text{ miles} - 144 \text{ miles}
   \]

   \[
   \text{Remaining distance} = 6 \text{ miles}
   \]

3. **Determine how long Jerome will ride on the 13th day:**
   Since the remaining distance is 6 miles, Jerome will need to ride this distance on the 13th day to complete his trip.

Thus, the final answer is:

\[
\text{Jerome will ride } 6 \text{ miles on the 13th day.}
\]
