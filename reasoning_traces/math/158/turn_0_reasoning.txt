==================================================

To find out how much Raphael spent on school supplies, we will calculate the total cost for each type of item he bought and then sum those amounts.

1. **Calculate the cost of the pens:**
   - Raphael bought 4 pens.
   - The cost of each pen is $1.5.
   - To find the total cost for the pens, we multiply the number of pens by the cost per pen:
     \[
     \text{Total cost of pens} = 4 \text{ pens} \times 1.5 \text{ dollars/pen} = 6 \text{ dollars}
     \]

2. **Calculate the cost of the notebooks:**
   - Raphael bought 2 notebooks.
   - The cost of each notebook is $4.
   - To find the total cost for the notebooks, we multiply the number of notebooks by the cost per notebook:
     \[
     \text{Total cost of notebooks} = 2 \text{ notebooks} \times 4 \text{ dollars/notebook} = 8 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Calculate the cost of the rim of bond paper:**
   - The cost of the rim of bond paper is $20.
   - Since he only bought one rim, the total cost for the bond paper is simply:
     \[
     \text{Total cost of bond paper} = 20 \text{ dollars}
     \]

4. **Sum all the costs to find the total amount spent:**
   - Now we add the total costs of the pens, notebooks, and bond paper:
     \[
     \text{Total amount spent} = \text{Total cost of pens} + \text{Total cost of notebooks} + \text{Total cost of bond paper}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total amount spent} = 6 \text{ dollars} + 8 \text{ dollars} + 20 \text{ dollars}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total amount spent} = 34 \text{ dollars}
     \]

Therefore, Raphael spent a total of **$34** on everything. 

Final answer: **$34**
