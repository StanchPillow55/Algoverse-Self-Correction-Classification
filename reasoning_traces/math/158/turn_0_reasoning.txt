To solve this problem, we need to determine how many miles Jerome will have left to ride on the 13th day to complete his 150-mile bicycle trip.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Calculate the Total Miles Jerome Plans to Ride in 12 Days:**

   Jerome plans to ride 12 miles each day for 12 days. We can calculate the total distance he will cover in these 12 days by multiplying the daily distance by the number of days:

   \[
   \text{Total miles in 12 days} = 12 \, \text{miles/day} \times 12 \, \text{days} = 144 \, \text{miles}
   \]

2. **Determine the Remaining Miles for the 13th Day:**

   Jerome's total trip is 150 miles. After riding for 12 days, he will have covered 144 miles. To find out how many miles he needs to ride on the 13th day, we subtract the miles he has already ridden from the total trip distance:

   \[
   \text{Remaining miles} = 150 \, \text{miles} - 144 \, \text{miles} = 6 \, \text{miles}
   \]

3. **Conclusion:**

   Jerome needs to ride 6 miles on the 13th day to complete his 150-mile bicycle trip.

### Final Answer:

Jerome will ride **6 miles** on the 13th day to finish his goal.
