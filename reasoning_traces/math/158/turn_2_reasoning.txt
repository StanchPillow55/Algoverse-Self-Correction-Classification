Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To find out how much Raphael spent on school supplies, we will calculate the total cost of each item he bought and then sum those amounts.

1. **Calculate the cost of the pens:**
   - Raphael bought 4 pens, each costing $1.5.
   - Total cost for pens = Number of pens × Cost per pen
   \[
   \text{Total cost for pens} = 4 \times 1.5 = 6.0
   \]

2. **Calculate the cost of the notebooks:**
   - Raphael bought 2 notebooks, each costing $4.
   - Total cost for notebooks = Number of notebooks × Cost per notebook
   \[
   \text{Total cost for notebooks} = 2 \times 4 = 8.0
   \]

3. **Calculate the cost of the bond paper:**
   - The rim of bond paper costs $20.
   - Total cost for bond paper = $20 (no calculation needed as it's a single item).

4. **Sum all the costs:**
   - Total cost = Total cost for pens + Total cost for notebooks + Total cost for bond paper
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = 6.0 + 8.0 + 20.0 = 34.0
   \]

Therefore, the total amount Raphael spent on everything is **$34.00**. 

Final answer: **$34.00**.
