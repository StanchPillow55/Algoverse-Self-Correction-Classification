Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine how many miles Jerome will have left to ride on the 13th day after riding for 12 days.

1. **Calculate the total distance Jerome plans to ride in 12 days:**

   Jerome rides 12 miles each day for 12 days. Therefore, the total distance covered in 12 days is calculated as follows:
   \[
   \text{Distance in 12 days} = 12 \, \text{miles/day} \times 12 \, \text{days} = 144 \, \text{miles}
   \]

2. **Determine the remaining distance for the 13th day:**

   Jerome's total trip is 150 miles. After riding 144 miles in 12 days, we need to find out how many miles are left for him to ride on the 13th day:
   \[
   \text{Remaining distance} = 150 \, \text{miles} - 144 \, \text{miles} = 6 \, \text{miles}
   \]

3. **Conclusion:**

   Jerome will need to ride 6 miles on the 13th day to complete his 150-mile bicycle trip.

Therefore, the final answer is that Jerome will ride **6 miles** on the 13th day.
