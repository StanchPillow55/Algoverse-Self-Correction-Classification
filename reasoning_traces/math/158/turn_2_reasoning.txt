Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine how many miles Jerome will need to ride on the 13th day to complete his 150-mile bicycle trip.

1. **Calculate the total distance Jerome plans to ride in the first 12 days:**

   Jerome rides 12 miles each day for 12 days. Therefore, the total distance he rides in the first 12 days is calculated as follows:

   \[
   \text{Total distance in 12 days} = 12 \, \text{miles/day} \times 12 \, \text{days} = 144 \, \text{miles}
   \]

2. **Determine the remaining distance to reach his goal:**

   Jerome's goal is to complete a 150-mile trip. After riding 144 miles in the first 12 days, we need to find out how many more miles he needs to ride to reach 150 miles.

   \[
   \text{Remaining distance} = 150 \, \text{miles} - 144 \, \text{miles} = 6 \, \text{miles}
   \]

3. **Conclusion:**

   Jerome needs to ride 6 miles on the 13th day to complete his 150-mile bicycle trip.

Therefore, the final answer is that Jerome will ride **6 miles** on the 13th day.
