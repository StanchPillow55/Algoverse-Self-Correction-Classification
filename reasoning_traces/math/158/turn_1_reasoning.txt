==================================================

To determine how long Jerome will ride on the 13th day to finish his 150-mile bicycle trip, we can break the problem down step by step.

1. **Calculate the total distance Jerome plans to ride in the first 12 days:**
   - Jerome rides 12 miles each day for 12 days.
   - Total distance for the first 12 days = 12 miles/day Ã— 12 days = 144 miles.

2. **Determine how much distance remains after 12 days:**
   - Total trip distance = 150 miles.
   - Distance ridden in the first 12 days = 144 miles.
   - Remaining distance = Total trip distance - Distance ridden = 150 miles - 144 miles = 6 miles.

3. **Calculate how long Jerome needs to ride on the 13th day:**
   - To finish his goal, Jerome needs to ride the remaining 6 miles on the 13th day.

Thus, Jerome will ride **6 miles** on the 13th day to complete his 150-mile trip.

Final answer: **6 miles**.
