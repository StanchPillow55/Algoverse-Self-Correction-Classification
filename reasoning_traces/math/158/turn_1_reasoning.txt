==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine how many miles Jerome will have left to ride on the 13th day after riding for 12 days.

**Step 1: Calculate the total distance Jerome will ride in the first 12 days.**

Jerome plans to ride 12 miles each day for 12 days. We can calculate the total distance he will cover in these 12 days by multiplying the number of miles per day by the number of days:

\[
\text{Total miles in 12 days} = 12 \, \text{miles/day} \times 12 \, \text{days} = 144 \, \text{miles}
\]

**Step 2: Determine the remaining distance Jerome needs to ride to complete his 150-mile goal.**

Jerome's total goal is to ride 150 miles. After riding 144 miles in the first 12 days, we need to find out how many miles he has left to ride:

\[
\text{Remaining miles} = 150 \, \text{miles} - 144 \, \text{miles} = 6 \, \text{miles}
\]

**Step 3: Determine how long Jerome will ride on the 13th day.**

Since Jerome has 6 miles left to reach his goal after the first 12 days, he will need to ride 6 miles on the 13th day.

**Final Answer:**

Jerome will ride 6 miles on the 13th day to finish his 150-mile bicycle trip.
