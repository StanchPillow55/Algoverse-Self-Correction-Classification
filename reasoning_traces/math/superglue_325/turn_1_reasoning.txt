==================================================

To solve the problem effectively, I need to understand what "Sample reasoning question 325" refers to. Since the problem statement is not explicitly provided, I'll demonstrate a general approach to solving a math problem by assuming a typical problem-solving scenario. Let's assume a problem involving algebra, as it's a common topic.

**Problem Assumption:**
Let's assume the problem is: "Solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \)."

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We are given the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).
   - Our goal is to find the value of \( x \) that makes this equation true.

2. **Isolate the Variable:**
   - To solve for \( x \), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation.
   - Start by eliminating the constant term on the left side. We do this by subtracting 3 from both sides of the equation:

     \[
     2x + 3 - 3 = 11 - 3
     \]

   - Simplifying both sides gives:

     \[
     2x = 8
     \]

3. **Solve for \( x \):**
   - Now, we need to solve for \( x \) by getting rid of the coefficient 2. We do this by dividing both sides of the equation by 2:

     \[
     \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{8}{2}
     \]

   - Simplifying both sides gives:

     \[
     x = 4
     \]

4. **Verify the Solution:**
   - Substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies the equation:

     \[
     2(4) + 3 = 11
     \]

   - Simplifying the left side:

     \[
     8 + 3 = 11
     \]

   - Since both sides of the equation are equal, \( x = 4 \) is indeed the correct solution.

5. **State the Final Answer:**
   - The solution to the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \) is \( x = 4 \).

This approach demonstrates a systematic method for solving a basic algebraic equation. If "Sample reasoning question 325" refers to a different problem, please provide the specific details or context, and I can adjust the solution accordingly.
