==================================================

It seems like there might be a misunderstanding or a missing part of the question, as "Sample reasoning question 325" doesn't provide specific details or numbers to work with. However, I can guide you through a general approach to solving a math problem by breaking it down into steps. If you have a specific math problem in mind, please provide the details, and I'll be happy to help solve it.

Here's a general approach to solving a math problem:

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - Read the problem carefully.
   - Identify what is being asked.
   - Determine what information is given and what needs to be found.

2. **Devise a Plan:**
   - Think about the strategies that could be used to solve the problem (e.g., algebraic manipulation, drawing a diagram, logical reasoning).
   - Consider similar problems you have solved before.

3. **Carry Out the Plan:**
   - Execute the steps you have planned.
   - Perform calculations carefully.
   - Keep track of units and ensure consistency.

4. **Check Your Work:**
   - Review each step to ensure accuracy.
   - Verify that the solution makes sense in the context of the problem.
   - Double-check calculations and logic.

5. **State the Final Answer:**
   - Clearly present the solution.
   - Include units if applicable.

If you provide a specific math problem, I can apply this approach to solve it and show all the work and reasoning involved.
