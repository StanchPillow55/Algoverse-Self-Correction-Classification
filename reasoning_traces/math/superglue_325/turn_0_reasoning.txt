==================================================

It seems like the question "Sample reasoning question 325" is not fully clear or specific. To provide a thorough solution, I would need more details about the problem itself. However, I can guide you on how to approach a typical math problem by breaking it down into steps. If you have a specific math problem in mind, please provide the details, and I can assist you further.

Here's a general approach to solving a math problem:

### Step 1: Understand the Problem
- **Read the problem carefully.** Make sure you understand what is being asked. Identify the key information and what you need to find.
- **Identify the type of problem.** Is it algebra, geometry, calculus, statistics, etc.?

### Step 2: Devise a Plan
- **Choose a strategy.** Depending on the problem, you might use algebraic manipulation, draw a diagram, use a formula, or apply a theorem.
- **Consider similar problems.** Think about how you have solved similar problems in the past.

### Step 3: Carry Out the Plan
- **Execute your strategy.** Perform calculations step by step, showing all your work.
- **Be organized.** Keep your work neat to avoid mistakes and make it easier to follow your reasoning.

### Step 4: Review/Check Your Work
- **Verify your solution.** Check your calculations and ensure that your solution makes sense in the context of the problem.
- **Consider alternative methods.** Sometimes a different approach can confirm your solution or provide additional insights.

### Example Problem
Let's solve a simple algebra problem as an example:

**Problem:** Solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).

**Step 1: Understand the Problem**
We need to find the value of \( x \) that makes the equation true.

**Step 2: Devise a Plan**
We can solve for \( x \) by isolating it on one side of the equation.

**Step 3: Carry Out the Plan**
1. Start with the equation: \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).
2. Subtract 3 from both sides to isolate the term with \( x \):
   \[
   2x + 3 - 3 = 11 - 3
   \]
   \[
   2x = 8
   \]
3. Divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( x \):
   \[
   \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{8}{2}
   \]
   \[
   x = 4
   \]

**Step 4: Review/Check Your Work**
- Substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation to verify:
  \[
  2(4) + 3 = 8 + 3 = 11
  \]
- The left side equals the right side, confirming our solution is correct.

**Final Answer:** \( x = 4 \)
