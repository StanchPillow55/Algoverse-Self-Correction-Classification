Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem labeled "Sample reasoning question 325," we need to first understand what the problem is asking. However, since the problem statement itself is missing, I will demonstrate a general approach to solving a typical math problem by creating a hypothetical problem and solving it step by step.

Let's assume the problem is as follows:

**Problem Statement:**
A car travels from City A to City B at a constant speed of 60 miles per hour. The distance between City A and City B is 180 miles. How long does it take for the car to travel from City A to City B?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Identify the Given Information:**
   - Speed of the car = 60 miles per hour
   - Distance between City A and City B = 180 miles

2. **Identify What Needs to be Found:**
   - We need to find the time it takes for the car to travel from City A to City B.

3. **Use the Formula for Time:**
   The formula to calculate time when distance and speed are known is:
   \[
   \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}}
   \]

4. **Substitute the Given Values into the Formula:**
   \[
   \text{Time} = \frac{180 \text{ miles}}{60 \text{ miles per hour}}
   \]

5. **Perform the Calculation:**
   \[
   \text{Time} = \frac{180}{60} = 3 \text{ hours}
   \]

6. **Interpret the Result:**
   The car takes 3 hours to travel from City A to City B at a constant speed of 60 miles per hour.

**Final Answer:**
The car takes 3 hours to travel from City A to City B.

This approach demonstrates how to solve a typical distance-speed-time problem by identifying the given information, using the appropriate formula, substituting the values, performing the calculation, and interpreting the result. If you have a specific problem labeled "Sample reasoning question 325," please provide the details, and I will be happy to solve it accordingly.
