Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem labeled "Sample math problem 478," we first need to understand what the problem is asking. However, the problem statement is not provided here, so I will demonstrate how to approach a generic math problem by creating a sample problem and solving it step by step.

### Sample Math Problem:
**Problem:** Calculate the sum of all even numbers between 1 and 100.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Identify the Even Numbers:**
   - Even numbers are integers divisible by 2.
   - Between 1 and 100, the even numbers are 2, 4, 6, ..., 100.

2. **Determine the Sequence:**
   - This sequence of even numbers is an arithmetic sequence where the first term \( a_1 = 2 \) and the common difference \( d = 2 \).

3. **Find the Number of Terms:**
   - The last term \( a_n = 100 \).
   - The formula for the \( n \)-th term of an arithmetic sequence is:
     \[
     a_n = a_1 + (n-1) \cdot d
     \]
   - Plugging in the known values:
     \[
     100 = 2 + (n-1) \cdot 2
     \]
     \[
     100 = 2 + 2n - 2
     \]
     \[
     100 = 2n
     \]
     \[
     n = 50
     \]
   - There are 50 even numbers between 1 and 100.

4. **Calculate the Sum of the Sequence:**
   - The sum \( S_n \) of the first \( n \) terms of an arithmetic sequence is given by:
     \[
     S_n = \frac{n}{2} \cdot (a_1 + a_n)
     \]
   - Substituting the known values:
     \[
     S_{50} = \frac{50}{2} \cdot (2 + 100)
     \]
     \[
     S_{50} = 25 \cdot 102
     \]
     \[
     S_{50} = 2550
     \]

### Final Answer:
The sum of all even numbers between 1 and 100 is 2550.

This approach demonstrates how to solve a typical arithmetic sequence problem by identifying the sequence, determining the number of terms, and using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic sequence. If you have a specific problem labeled "Sample math problem 478," please provide the details, and I will solve it accordingly.
