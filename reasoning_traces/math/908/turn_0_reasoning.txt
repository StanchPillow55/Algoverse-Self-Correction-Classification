To solve the problem, we need to determine how many marbles Dean has left after giving some to Jamie and Donald.

1. **Calculate the number of marbles given to Jamie:**
   Dean gives \( \frac{1}{5} \) of his 30 marbles to Jamie. To find out how many marbles that is, we perform the following calculation:

   \[
   \text{Marbles given to Jamie} = \frac{1}{5} \times 30
   \]

   Now, we calculate \( \frac{1}{5} \times 30 \):

   \[
   \frac{1}{5} \times 30 = \frac{30}{5} = 6
   \]

   So, Dean gives 6 marbles to Jamie.

2. **Calculate the number of marbles given to Donald:**
   Dean gives 10 marbles to Donald. 

3. **Calculate the total number of marbles given away:**
   Now, we need to find the total number of marbles Dean has given away. This is the sum of the marbles given to Jamie and Donald:

   \[
   \text{Total marbles given away} = \text{Marbles to Jamie} + \text{Marbles to Donald}
   \]

   Substituting the values we found:

   \[
   \text{Total marbles given away} = 6 + 10 = 16
   \]

4. **Calculate the number of marbles left for Dean:**
   To find out how many marbles Dean has left, we subtract the total number of marbles given away from the original number of marbles he had:

   \[
   \text{Marbles left for Dean} = \text{Original marbles} - \text{Total marbles given away}
   \]

   Substituting the values:

   \[
   \text{Marbles left for Dean} = 30 - 16 = 14
   \]

Thus, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{14}
\] 

Dean has 14 marbles left after giving some to Jamie and Donald.
