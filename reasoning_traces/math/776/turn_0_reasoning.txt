To find out how much you have to pay for a laptop that costs $1000 after a 20% discount, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the amount of the discount**: 
   The discount is 20% of the original price. To find the discount amount, we can use the formula:
   \[
   \text{Discount Amount} = \text{Original Price} \times \left(\frac{\text{Discount Percentage}}{100}\right)
   \]
   Substituting the values:
   \[
   \text{Discount Amount} = 1000 \times \left(\frac{20}{100}\right)
   \]

2. **Perform the calculation**:
   \[
   \text{Discount Amount} = 1000 \times 0.20 = 200
   \]
   So, the discount amount is $200.

3. **Calculate the final price after the discount**:
   To find the final price, we subtract the discount amount from the original price:
   \[
   \text{Final Price} = \text{Original Price} - \text{Discount Amount}
   \]
   Substituting the values:
   \[
   \text{Final Price} = 1000 - 200
   \]

4. **Perform the subtraction**:
   \[
   \text{Final Price} = 800
   \]

Thus, after applying the 20% discount, the amount you have to pay for the laptop is **$800**.

**Final Answer**: $800
