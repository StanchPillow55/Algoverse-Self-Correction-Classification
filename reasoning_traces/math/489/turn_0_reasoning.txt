To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total earnings from the sales of each book and then find the difference between these earnings.

### Step 1: Calculate Earnings from "TOP" Books

The cost of one "TOP" book is $8. According to the problem, 13 "TOP" books were sold last week. To find the total earnings from the "TOP" books, we multiply the number of books sold by the cost per book:

\[
\text{Earnings from "TOP" books} = 13 \times 8
\]

Calculating this gives:

\[
13 \times 8 = 104
\]

So, the earnings from the "TOP" books are $104.

### Step 2: Calculate Earnings from "ABC" Books

The cost of one "ABC" book is $23. According to the problem, 4 "ABC" books were sold last week. To find the total earnings from the "ABC" books, we multiply the number of books sold by the cost per book:

\[
\text{Earnings from "ABC" books} = 4 \times 23
\]

Calculating this gives:

\[
4 \times 23 = 92
\]

So, the earnings from the "ABC" books are $92.

### Step 3: Calculate the Difference in Earnings

Now, we need to find the difference in earnings between the "TOP" books and the "ABC" books. We subtract the earnings from the "ABC" books from the earnings from the "TOP" books:

\[
\text{Difference in earnings} = 104 - 92
\]

Calculating this gives:

\[
104 - 92 = 12
\]

### Final Answer

The difference in the bookstore's earnings on these two books last week is $12.
