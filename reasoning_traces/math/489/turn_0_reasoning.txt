To find the difference in the bookstore's earnings from the two books, we need to calculate the total earnings from each book and then find the difference between those totals.

1. **Calculate the earnings from the "TOP" books:**
   - The cost of one "TOP" book is $8.
   - The number of "TOP" books sold is 13.
   - To find the total earnings from "TOP" books, we multiply the number of books sold by the price per book:
     \[
     \text{Total earnings from "TOP"} = \text{Number of "TOP" books sold} \times \text{Price of one "TOP" book}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total earnings from "TOP"} = 13 \times 8
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total earnings from "TOP"} = 104
     \]

2. **Calculate the earnings from the "ABC" books:**
   - The cost of one "ABC" book is $23.
   - The number of "ABC" books sold is 4.
   - To find the total earnings from "ABC" books, we multiply the number of books sold by the price per book:
     \[
     \text{Total earnings from "ABC"} = \text{Number of "ABC" books sold} \times \text{Price of one "ABC" book}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total earnings from "ABC"} = 4 \times 23
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total earnings from "ABC"} = 92
     \]

3. **Find the difference in earnings:**
   - Now we need to find the difference between the total earnings from "TOP" books and "ABC" books:
     \[
     \text{Difference} = \text{Total earnings from "TOP"} - \text{Total earnings from "ABC"}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Difference} = 104 - 92
     \]
     \[
     \text{Difference} = 12
     \]

Thus, the difference in the bookstore's earnings on these two books last week is **$12**.

Final Answer: **$12**
