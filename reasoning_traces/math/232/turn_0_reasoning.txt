==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine the age of Jolene and Phil's fourth child based on the information provided about the birth dates of their children.

1. **First Child:**
   - The first child was born exactly 15 years ago.

2. **Second Child:**
   - The second child was born exactly one year after the first child.
   - Therefore, the second child was born 15 - 1 = 14 years ago.

3. **Third Child:**
   - The third child was born on the fourth birthday of the second child.
   - Since the second child was born 14 years ago, their fourth birthday would have been 14 - 4 = 10 years ago.
   - Therefore, the third child was born 10 years ago.

4. **Fourth Child:**
   - The fourth child was born two years after the birth of the third child.
   - Since the third child was born 10 years ago, the fourth child was born 10 - 2 = 8 years ago.

Thus, the fourth child is currently 8 years old.

**Final Answer:**
The fourth child is 8 years old.
