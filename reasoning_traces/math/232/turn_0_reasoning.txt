==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to determine the total number of insects in the garden, which includes both ants and bugs.

1. **Identify the number of ants**: 
   The problem states that there are 50 ants in the garden.

   \[
   \text{Number of ants} = 50
   \]

2. **Determine the number of bugs**: 
   According to the problem, there are half as many bugs as there are ants. To find the number of bugs, we take half of the number of ants.

   \[
   \text{Number of bugs} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Number of ants} = \frac{1}{2} \times 50
   \]

   Now, we perform the calculation:

   \[
   \text{Number of bugs} = \frac{50}{2} = 25
   \]

3. **Calculate the total number of insects**: 
   The total number of insects in the garden is the sum of the number of ants and the number of bugs.

   \[
   \text{Total number of insects} = \text{Number of ants} + \text{Number of bugs}
   \]

   Substituting the values we found:

   \[
   \text{Total number of insects} = 50 + 25
   \]

   Now, we perform the addition:

   \[
   \text{Total number of insects} = 75
   \]

4. **Final answer**: 
   The total number of insects in the garden is 

   \[
   \boxed{75}
   \]
