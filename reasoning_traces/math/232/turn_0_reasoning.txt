To determine the age of Jolene and Phil's fourth child, we will analyze the timeline of the births of their children step by step.

1. **First Child**: 
   - Jolene and Phil had their first child 15 years ago. 
   - Therefore, the age of the first child is 15 years.

2. **Second Child**: 
   - They had their second child one year after the first child. 
   - This means the second child was born 15 years ago + 1 year = 14 years ago.
   - Therefore, the age of the second child is 14 years.

3. **Third Child**: 
   - They had their third child on the fourth birthday of their second child.
   - The second child is currently 14 years old, so they turned 4 years old 14 - 4 = 10 years ago.
   - Thus, the third child was born 10 years ago.
   - Therefore, the age of the third child is 10 years.

4. **Fourth Child**: 
   - They had their fourth child two years after the birth of their third child.
   - Since the third child was born 10 years ago, the fourth child was born 10 years ago + 2 years = 8 years ago.
   - Therefore, the age of the fourth child is 8 years.

Now, we can summarize the ages of all the children:
- First child: 15 years old
- Second child: 14 years old
- Third child: 10 years old
- Fourth child: 8 years old

Finally, the age of the fourth child is:

\[
\boxed{8}
\]
