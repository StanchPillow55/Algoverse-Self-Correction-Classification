==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 254" refers to. Since the problem statement is not explicitly provided, I'll assume this is a placeholder for a typical math problem. Let's create a sample problem and solve it step-by-step.

**Sample Problem:**

A rectangle has a length that is twice its width. If the perimeter of the rectangle is 54 units, what are the dimensions of the rectangle?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We have a rectangle with a length (L) and a width (W).
   - The length is twice the width: \( L = 2W \).
   - The perimeter of the rectangle is 54 units.

2. **Recall the Formula for Perimeter:**
   - The perimeter (P) of a rectangle is given by the formula:
     \[
     P = 2L + 2W
     \]

3. **Substitute the Known Values:**
   - We know the perimeter is 54 units, so:
     \[
     2L + 2W = 54
     \]

4. **Substitute the Expression for Length:**
   - Since \( L = 2W \), substitute \( L \) in the perimeter equation:
     \[
     2(2W) + 2W = 54
     \]

5. **Simplify the Equation:**
   - Simplify the left side:
     \[
     4W + 2W = 54
     \]
   - Combine like terms:
     \[
     6W = 54
     \]

6. **Solve for Width (W):**
   - Divide both sides by 6 to solve for \( W \):
     \[
     W = \frac{54}{6} = 9
     \]

7. **Find the Length (L):**
   - Since \( L = 2W \), substitute \( W = 9 \) into the expression for \( L \):
     \[
     L = 2 \times 9 = 18
     \]

8. **Verify the Solution:**
   - Check if the dimensions satisfy the perimeter condition:
     \[
     2L + 2W = 2(18) + 2(9) = 36 + 18 = 54
     \]
   - The calculated perimeter matches the given perimeter, confirming our solution is correct.

**Final Answer:**

The dimensions of the rectangle are:
- Width (W) = 9 units
- Length (L) = 18 units
