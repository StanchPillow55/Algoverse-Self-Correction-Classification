Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we first need to understand what "Sample math problem 272" refers to. Since the problem is not explicitly stated, I'll assume a generic math problem and solve it step by step. Let's assume "Sample math problem 272" involves solving a quadratic equation, as this is a common type of math problem.

Let's consider the quadratic equation:

\[ ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \]

For simplicity, let's use specific values for \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \):

\[ 2x^2 + 3x - 5 = 0 \]

We will solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula:

\[ x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \]

**Step 1: Identify the coefficients**

From the equation \( 2x^2 + 3x - 5 = 0 \), we identify:
- \( a = 2 \)
- \( b = 3 \)
- \( c = -5 \)

**Step 2: Calculate the discriminant**

The discriminant \( \Delta \) is given by:

\[ \Delta = b^2 - 4ac \]

Substitute the values of \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \):

\[ \Delta = 3^2 - 4 \cdot 2 \cdot (-5) \]
\[ \Delta = 9 + 40 \]
\[ \Delta = 49 \]

**Step 3: Apply the quadratic formula**

Since the discriminant is positive (\( \Delta = 49 \)), there are two real and distinct solutions. We use the quadratic formula:

\[ x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{\Delta}}{2a} \]

Substitute the values of \( b \), \( \Delta \), and \( a \):

\[ x = \frac{-3 \pm \sqrt{49}}{2 \cdot 2} \]
\[ x = \frac{-3 \pm 7}{4} \]

**Step 4: Calculate the two solutions**

1. First solution (\( x_1 \)):

\[ x_1 = \frac{-3 + 7}{4} \]
\[ x_1 = \frac{4}{4} \]
\[ x_1 = 1 \]

2. Second solution (\( x_2 \)):

\[ x_2 = \frac{-3 - 7}{4} \]
\[ x_2 = \frac{-10}{4} \]
\[ x_2 = -\frac{5}{2} \]

**Final Answer:**

The solutions to the quadratic equation \( 2x^2 + 3x - 5 = 0 \) are:

\[ x = 1 \quad \text{and} \quad x = -\frac{5}{2} \]
