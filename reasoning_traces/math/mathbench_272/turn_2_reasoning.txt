Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, I need to first understand what "Sample math problem 272" refers to. Since I don't have access to external databases or specific problem sets, I'll need to create a hypothetical math problem and solve it step-by-step. Let's assume "Sample math problem 272" is a typical algebra problem. Here's an example problem and its solution:

**Problem:**
Solve for \( x \) in the equation: 
\[ 3x + 5 = 2x - 7 \]

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Identify the Equation:**
   We start with the equation:
   \[
   3x + 5 = 2x - 7
   \]

2. **Isolate the Variable:**
   To solve for \( x \), we need to get all terms involving \( x \) on one side of the equation and constant terms on the other side. Let's move the \( 2x \) from the right side to the left side by subtracting \( 2x \) from both sides:
   \[
   3x + 5 - 2x = 2x - 7 - 2x
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   x + 5 = -7
   \]

3. **Solve for \( x \):**
   Next, we need to isolate \( x \) by removing the constant term on the left side. Subtract 5 from both sides:
   \[
   x + 5 - 5 = -7 - 5
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   x = -12
   \]

4. **Verify the Solution:**
   To ensure our solution is correct, substitute \( x = -12 \) back into the original equation:
   \[
   3(-12) + 5 = 2(-12) - 7
   \]
   Calculate each side:
   \[
   -36 + 5 = -24 - 7
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   -31 = -31
   \]
   Since both sides are equal, our solution is verified.

**Final Answer:**
The solution to the equation \( 3x + 5 = 2x - 7 \) is \( x = -12 \).
