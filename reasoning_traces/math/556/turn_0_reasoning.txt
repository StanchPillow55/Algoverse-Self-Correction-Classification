==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to determine the cost of the six-inch cold-cut combo sub based on the information provided about the foot-long fish sub.

1. **Identify the cost of the foot-long fish sub**:
   - The problem states that the cost of the foot-long fish sub is $40.

2. **Determine the cost of the six-inch cold-cut combo sub**:
   - According to the problem, the cost of the six-inch cold-cut combo sub is three times the cost of the foot-long fish sub.
   - Therefore, we can calculate the cost of the six-inch cold-cut combo sub as follows:
     \[
     \text{Cost of six-inch cold-cut combo} = 3 \times \text{Cost of foot-long fish sub}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Cost of six-inch cold-cut combo} = 3 \times 40
     \]
     \[
     \text{Cost of six-inch cold-cut combo} = 120
     \]

3. **Calculate the total cost for lunch**:
   - Now, we need to find the total cost for lunch, which includes both the foot-long fish sub and the six-inch cold-cut combo sub.
   - We can calculate the total cost as follows:
     \[
     \text{Total cost} = \text{Cost of foot-long fish sub} + \text{Cost of six-inch cold-cut combo}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total cost} = 40 + 120
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total cost} = 160
     \]

4. **Final answer**:
   - The total cost for lunch today at Subway is **$160**.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{160}
\]
