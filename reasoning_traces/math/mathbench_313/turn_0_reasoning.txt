==================================================

To solve "Sample math problem 313," I need more specific information about the problem itself. Since the problem isn't provided, I'll create a sample math problem and solve it step-by-step. Let's assume the problem is as follows:

**Problem:**

Solve for \( x \) in the equation:

\[ 3x + 5 = 2x + 9 \]

**Step-by-step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Equation:**
   The equation given is a linear equation in one variable, \( x \). Our goal is to isolate \( x \) on one side of the equation to find its value.

2. **Simplify the Equation:**
   Start by getting all terms involving \( x \) on one side of the equation and constant terms on the other side. We can do this by subtracting \( 2x \) from both sides:

   \[
   3x + 5 - 2x = 2x + 9 - 2x
   \]

   Simplifying both sides gives:

   \[
   x + 5 = 9
   \]

3. **Isolate \( x \):**
   Next, we need to isolate \( x \) by removing the constant term on the left side. We do this by subtracting 5 from both sides:

   \[
   x + 5 - 5 = 9 - 5
   \]

   Simplifying both sides gives:

   \[
   x = 4
   \]

4. **Verify the Solution:**
   To ensure our solution is correct, substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation and check if both sides are equal:

   Original equation: \( 3x + 5 = 2x + 9 \)

   Substitute \( x = 4 \):

   Left side: \( 3(4) + 5 = 12 + 5 = 17 \)

   Right side: \( 2(4) + 9 = 8 + 9 = 17 \)

   Since both sides are equal, our solution is verified.

**Final Answer:**

The solution to the equation \( 3x + 5 = 2x + 9 \) is \( x = 4 \).
