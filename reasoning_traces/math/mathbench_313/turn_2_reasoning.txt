Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, I need to first understand what "Sample math problem 313" refers to. Since I don't have the specific details of this problem, I'll create a hypothetical math problem and solve it step-by-step. Let's assume "Sample math problem 313" is a problem involving solving a quadratic equation. Here's how I would approach it:

**Problem:**
Solve the quadratic equation: \(2x^2 - 4x - 6 = 0\).

**Step 1: Identify the coefficients.**
The standard form of a quadratic equation is \(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\).
For the equation \(2x^2 - 4x - 6 = 0\), the coefficients are:
- \(a = 2\)
- \(b = -4\)
- \(c = -6\)

**Step 2: Calculate the discriminant.**
The discriminant (\(\Delta\)) of a quadratic equation is given by the formula:
\[
\Delta = b^2 - 4ac
\]
Substitute the values of \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\):
\[
\Delta = (-4)^2 - 4 \times 2 \times (-6) = 16 + 48 = 64
\]

**Step 3: Determine the nature of the roots.**
Since the discriminant is positive (\(\Delta = 64\)), the quadratic equation has two distinct real roots.

**Step 4: Use the quadratic formula to find the roots.**
The quadratic formula is:
\[
x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{\Delta}}{2a}
\]
Substitute the values of \(b\), \(\Delta\), and \(a\):
\[
x = \frac{-(-4) \pm \sqrt{64}}{2 \times 2} = \frac{4 \pm 8}{4}
\]

**Step 5: Calculate the two roots.**
1. First root:
\[
x_1 = \frac{4 + 8}{4} = \frac{12}{4} = 3
\]

2. Second root:
\[
x_2 = \frac{4 - 8}{4} = \frac{-4}{4} = -1
\]

**Final Answer:**
The solutions to the quadratic equation \(2x^2 - 4x - 6 = 0\) are \(x = 3\) and \(x = -1\).

This is a complete solution to the hypothetical problem I created based on the prompt. If "Sample math problem 313" refers to a different problem, please provide the specific details so I can solve it accurately.
