==================================================

It seems like you've referenced "Sample reasoning question 24" without providing the actual content of the question. To assist you effectively, I'll need the specific details or numbers involved in the problem. 

However, I can guide you on how to approach a typical math problem by outlining a general problem-solving strategy. If you provide the specific details of the question, I can apply this strategy to solve it.

### General Problem-Solving Strategy:

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - Read the problem carefully.
   - Identify what is being asked.
   - Note down the given information and any constraints.

2. **Devise a Plan:**
   - Think about the mathematical concepts that might apply (e.g., algebra, geometry, calculus).
   - Consider similar problems you have solved before.
   - Decide on a strategy (e.g., drawing a diagram, creating an equation).

3. **Carry Out the Plan:**
   - Execute your strategy step by step.
   - Perform calculations carefully.
   - Keep track of your work to avoid mistakes.

4. **Review/Check Your Work:**
   - Verify each step of your solution.
   - Check if your final answer makes sense in the context of the problem.
   - Consider alternative methods to confirm your result.

5. **State the Final Answer:**
   - Clearly write down the final answer.
   - Ensure it answers the question posed.

### Example Problem:

**Problem:** Solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).

**Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We need to find the value of \( x \) that satisfies the equation.

2. **Devise a Plan:**
   - This is a simple linear equation. We can isolate \( x \) by performing basic algebraic operations.

3. **Carry Out the Plan:**
   - Start with the equation: \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).
   - Subtract 3 from both sides to isolate the term with \( x \):
     \[
     2x + 3 - 3 = 11 - 3 \implies 2x = 8
     \]
   - Divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( x \):
     \[
     \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{8}{2} \implies x = 4
     \]

4. **Review/Check Your Work:**
   - Substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation to verify:
     \[
     2(4) + 3 = 8 + 3 = 11
     \]
   - The left-hand side equals the right-hand side, confirming our solution is correct.

5. **State the Final Answer:**
   - The solution to the equation is \( x = 4 \).
