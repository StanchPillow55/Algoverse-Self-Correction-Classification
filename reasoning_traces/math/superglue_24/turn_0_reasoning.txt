==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 24" refers to. Since there is no specific problem statement provided, I'll create a hypothetical math problem and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**

A company produces two types of widgets: Type A and Type B. The company can produce a maximum of 100 widgets per day. Each Type A widget requires 2 hours of labor, and each Type B widget requires 3 hours of labor. The company has a maximum of 240 labor hours available per day. If the profit from each Type A widget is $5 and from each Type B widget is $7, how many of each type of widget should the company produce to maximize profit?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( x \) be the number of Type A widgets produced.
   - Let \( y \) be the number of Type B widgets produced.

2. **Set Up Constraints:**
   - The total number of widgets produced cannot exceed 100:
     \[
     x + y \leq 100
     \]
   - The total labor hours cannot exceed 240:
     \[
     2x + 3y \leq 240
     \]
   - Non-negativity constraints:
     \[
     x \geq 0, \quad y \geq 0
     \]

3. **Objective Function:**
   - The profit function to maximize is:
     \[
     P = 5x + 7y
     \]

4. **Graphical Solution Method:**
   - Plot the constraints on a graph:
     - \( x + y = 100 \) is a line with intercepts at (100, 0) and (0, 100).
     - \( 2x + 3y = 240 \) is a line with intercepts at (120, 0) and (0, 80).

5. **Find Feasible Region:**
   - The feasible region is a polygon bounded by the lines \( x + y = 100 \), \( 2x + 3y = 240 \), and the axes \( x = 0 \) and \( y = 0 \).

6. **Identify Corner Points:**
   - Solve the system of equations to find intersection points:
     - Intersection of \( x + y = 100 \) and \( 2x + 3y = 240 \):
       \[
       x + y = 100 \quad \Rightarrow \quad y = 100 - x
       \]
       Substitute into the second equation:
       \[
       2x + 3(100 - x) = 240 \quad \Rightarrow \quad 2x + 300 - 3x = 240
       \]
       \[
       -x + 300 = 240 \quad \Rightarrow \quad x = 60, \quad y = 40
       \]
     - Other corner points are (0, 0), (0, 80), and (100, 0).

7. **Evaluate Objective Function at Each Corner Point:**
   - \( P(0, 0) = 5(0) + 7(0) = 0 \)
   - \( P(0, 80) = 5(0) + 7(80) = 560 \)
   - \( P(100, 0) = 5(100) + 7(0) = 500 \)
   - \( P(60, 40) = 5(60) + 7(40) = 300 + 280 = 580 \)

8. **Determine Maximum Profit:**
   - The maximum profit is \( 580 \) at the point \( (60, 40) \).

**Final Answer:**
To maximize profit, the company should produce 60 Type A widgets and 40 Type B widgets per day, resulting in a maximum profit of $580.
