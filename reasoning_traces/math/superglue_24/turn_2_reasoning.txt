==================================================

To solve the problem, we first need to understand what "Sample reasoning question 24" refers to. Since the problem statement is not explicitly provided, I'll demonstrate a general approach to solving a typical math problem by breaking it down into steps. Let's assume a hypothetical math problem and solve it step-by-step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**
Calculate the value of \( x \) in the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).

**Step 1: Understand the Problem**
The equation given is \( 2x + 3 = 11 \). We need to find the value of \( x \) that satisfies this equation.

**Step 2: Isolate the Variable**
To solve for \( x \), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We can do this by performing inverse operations.

1. **Subtract 3 from both sides**: 
   \[
   2x + 3 - 3 = 11 - 3
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   2x = 8
   \]

2. **Divide both sides by 2**:
   \[
   \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{8}{2}
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   x = 4
   \]

**Step 3: Verify the Solution**
Substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies the equation:
\[
2(4) + 3 = 11
\]
Calculate the left side:
\[
8 + 3 = 11
\]
Since both sides of the equation are equal, \( x = 4 \) is indeed the correct solution.

**Final Answer:**
The value of \( x \) is 4.

This approach demonstrates how to solve a simple linear equation by isolating the variable and verifying the solution. If you have a specific problem or context for "Sample reasoning question 24," please provide more details, and I can tailor the solution accordingly.
