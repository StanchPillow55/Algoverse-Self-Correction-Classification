Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 24" refers to. However, without additional context or specific details about the question, it's impossible to provide a precise solution. Instead, I'll outline a general approach to solving a typical math problem, which you can adapt to your specific question once you have more details.

### General Approach to Solving Math Problems

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - Read the problem carefully.
   - Identify what is being asked.
   - Determine what information is given and what needs to be found.

2. **Devise a Plan:**
   - Consider possible strategies to solve the problem. This could include drawing a diagram, creating an equation, or breaking the problem into smaller parts.
   - Choose the most appropriate strategy based on the problem type.

3. **Carry Out the Plan:**
   - Execute the chosen strategy step by step.
   - Perform calculations carefully and keep track of your work.
   - If the problem involves multiple steps, solve each part systematically.

4. **Check Your Work:**
   - Review each step to ensure accuracy.
   - Verify that the solution makes sense in the context of the problem.
   - Double-check calculations and logic.

5. **State the Final Answer:**
   - Clearly present the final solution.
   - Include units if applicable and ensure the answer addresses the question.

### Example Problem and Solution

Let's consider a hypothetical example to illustrate this approach:

**Example Problem:**
A rectangle has a length that is twice its width. If the perimeter of the rectangle is 36 units, what are the dimensions of the rectangle?

**Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We need to find the length and width of the rectangle.
   - Given: The perimeter is 36 units, and the length is twice the width.

2. **Devise a Plan:**
   - Use the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle: \( P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width}) \).
   - Let the width be \( w \). Then the length is \( 2w \).

3. **Carry Out the Plan:**
   - Substitute the expressions for length and width into the perimeter formula:
     \[
     36 = 2 \times (2w + w)
     \]
   - Simplify and solve for \( w \):
     \[
     36 = 2 \times 3w
     \]
     \[
     36 = 6w
     \]
     \[
     w = \frac{36}{6} = 6
     \]
   - Find the length:
     \[
     \text{Length} = 2w = 2 \times 6 = 12
     \]

4. **Check Your Work:**
   - Verify the perimeter with the found dimensions:
     \[
     P = 2 \times (12 + 6) = 2 \times 18 = 36
     \]
   - The calculations are correct.

5. **State the Final Answer:**
   - The width of the rectangle is 6 units, and the length is 12 units.

By following this structured approach, you can solve a wide range of math problems. Once you have the specific details of "Sample reasoning question 24," you can apply this method to find the solution.
