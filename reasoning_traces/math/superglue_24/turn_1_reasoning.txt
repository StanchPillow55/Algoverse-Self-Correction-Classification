Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem effectively, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 24" entails. Since the question itself is not provided, I will assume a generic approach to solving a reasoning-based math problem. Let's break down the steps typically involved in solving such problems:

### Step 1: Understand the Problem
- **Identify what is being asked**: Without specific details, let's assume the problem involves basic arithmetic or algebraic reasoning.
- **Determine the knowns and unknowns**: Usually, a problem will provide certain known values and ask you to find an unknown.

### Step 2: Develop a Plan
- **Choose a strategy**: Common strategies include drawing a diagram, creating an equation, or breaking the problem into smaller parts.

### Step 3: Execute the Plan
- **Perform calculations**: Use the chosen strategy to find the solution.
- **Check each step for accuracy**: Ensure calculations are correct and logical.

### Step 4: Review and Conclude
- **Verify the solution**: Check if the solution makes sense in the context of the problem.
- **State the final answer clearly**.

Since the problem specifics are missing, let's create a hypothetical problem to illustrate the process:

**Hypothetical Problem**: "If 3 times a number plus 5 equals 20, what is the number?"

#### Step 1: Understand the Problem
- We need to find the unknown number.
- The equation based on the problem statement is: \(3x + 5 = 20\).

#### Step 2: Develop a Plan
- We will solve the equation for \(x\).

#### Step 3: Execute the Plan
1. **Subtract 5 from both sides**:
   \[
   3x + 5 - 5 = 20 - 5
   \]
   \[
   3x = 15
   \]

2. **Divide both sides by 3**:
   \[
   \frac{3x}{3} = \frac{15}{3}
   \]
   \[
   x = 5
   \]

#### Step 4: Review and Conclude
- **Verify**: Substitute \(x = 5\) back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies the condition.
  \[
  3(5) + 5 = 15 + 5 = 20
  \]
- The solution is correct.

**Final Answer**: The number is 5.

This example illustrates the process of solving a reasoning-based math problem. If you have a specific problem or more details, feel free to provide them for a tailored solution.
