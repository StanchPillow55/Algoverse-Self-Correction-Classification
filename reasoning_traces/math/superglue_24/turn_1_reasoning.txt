==================================================

To solve the problem effectively, I need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 24" refers to. Since the problem statement is not explicitly provided, I'll demonstrate how to approach a typical reasoning problem step by step. Let's assume a hypothetical reasoning problem and work through it.

### Hypothetical Problem:
**Problem Statement:**  
A train travels from Station A to Station B at a speed of 60 km/h and returns from Station B to Station A at a speed of 40 km/h. What is the average speed of the train for the entire journey?

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - The train travels two legs: from A to B and back from B to A.
   - We need to find the average speed for the entire journey.

2. **Define the Variables:**
   - Let the distance between Station A and Station B be \( d \) km.

3. **Calculate the Time for Each Leg:**
   - **Time from A to B:**  
     \[
     \text{Time}_{AB} = \frac{d}{60} \text{ hours}
     \]
   - **Time from B to A:**  
     \[
     \text{Time}_{BA} = \frac{d}{40} \text{ hours}
     \]

4. **Calculate the Total Time for the Journey:**
   \[
   \text{Total Time} = \text{Time}_{AB} + \text{Time}_{BA} = \frac{d}{60} + \frac{d}{40}
   \]

5. **Find a Common Denominator and Simplify:**
   - The common denominator for 60 and 40 is 120.
   \[
   \frac{d}{60} = \frac{2d}{120}, \quad \frac{d}{40} = \frac{3d}{120}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total Time} = \frac{2d}{120} + \frac{3d}{120} = \frac{5d}{120} = \frac{d}{24} \text{ hours}
   \]

6. **Calculate the Total Distance:**
   - The total distance for the round trip is \( 2d \).

7. **Calculate the Average Speed:**
   - Average speed is defined as the total distance divided by the total time.
   \[
   \text{Average Speed} = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Total Time}} = \frac{2d}{\frac{d}{24}} = 2d \times \frac{24}{d} = 48 \text{ km/h}
   \]

### Final Answer:
The average speed of the train for the entire journey is 48 km/h.

This step-by-step approach demonstrates how to tackle a reasoning problem by breaking it down into manageable parts, performing calculations, and arriving at a logical conclusion. If you have a specific "Sample reasoning question 24" in mind, please provide the details, and I can work through that problem specifically.
