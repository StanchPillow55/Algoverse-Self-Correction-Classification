==================================================

Certainly! Let's work through the problem step by step. However, the problem statement "Sample math problem 64" is not specific enough to determine what exactly needs to be solved. Since the problem is not clearly defined, I'll assume you want to explore the number 64 in a mathematical context. Let's explore some interesting mathematical properties and problems related to the number 64.

### Exploring the Number 64

1. **Basic Properties:**
   - 64 is a positive integer.
   - It is an even number.
   - It is a perfect square since \( 8^2 = 64 \).
   - It is a perfect cube since \( 4^3 = 64 \).

2. **Prime Factorization:**
   - To find the prime factorization of 64, we can divide it by the smallest prime number, which is 2.
   - \( 64 \div 2 = 32 \)
   - \( 32 \div 2 = 16 \)
   - \( 16 \div 2 = 8 \)
   - \( 8 \div 2 = 4 \)
   - \( 4 \div 2 = 2 \)
   - \( 2 \div 2 = 1 \)
   - Therefore, the prime factorization of 64 is \( 2^6 \).

3. **Properties as a Power:**
   - As mentioned, 64 is both a perfect square and a perfect cube:
     - \( 64 = 8^2 \)
     - \( 64 = 4^3 \)
   - It can also be expressed as a power of 2: \( 64 = 2^6 \).

4. **Divisors:**
   - To find the divisors of 64, we consider all combinations of its prime factors:
   - The divisors are: 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, and 64.

5. **Sum of Divisors:**
   - The sum of the divisors of 64 is calculated as follows:
   - \( 1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + 16 + 32 + 64 = 127 \).

6. **Binary Representation:**
   - In binary, 64 is represented as \( 1000000_2 \).

7. **Applications:**
   - In computer science, 64 is significant because it represents a power of 2, which is commonly used in computing for memory addressing and data representation.

### Conclusion

Since the problem statement was not specific, we explored various mathematical aspects of the number 64. If you have a specific problem or context involving the number 64, please provide more details, and I can assist you further.

**Final Answer:**
The number 64 is a perfect square, a perfect cube, and can be expressed as \( 2^6 \). Its divisors are 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, and 64, and the sum of its divisors is 127.
