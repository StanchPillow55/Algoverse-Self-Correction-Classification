==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample math problem 64" refers to. Since the problem is not explicitly stated, I'll assume it involves the number 64 in some mathematical context. Let's explore a few possibilities and solve them:

### Possibility 1: Square Root Problem
One common problem involving the number 64 is finding its square root.

**Step 1: Understand the Problem**
We need to find the square root of 64.

**Step 2: Recall the Definition**
The square root of a number \( x \) is a number \( y \) such that \( y^2 = x \).

**Step 3: Calculate the Square Root**
We know that:
\[ 8 \times 8 = 64 \]

Therefore, the square root of 64 is 8.

**Final Answer:**
The square root of 64 is 8.

### Possibility 2: Exponentiation Problem
Another common problem could involve expressing 64 as a power of another number.

**Step 1: Understand the Problem**
Express 64 as a power of 2.

**Step 2: Recall the Definition**
We need to find \( n \) such that \( 2^n = 64 \).

**Step 3: Calculate the Exponent**
We know that:
\[ 2^6 = 64 \]

**Final Answer:**
64 can be expressed as \( 2^6 \).

### Possibility 3: Factorization Problem
Another possibility is to factor 64 into its prime factors.

**Step 1: Understand the Problem**
Factor 64 into its prime factors.

**Step 2: Recall the Definition**
Prime factorization involves expressing a number as a product of prime numbers.

**Step 3: Perform the Factorization**
64 is an even number, so we start dividing by 2:
\[ 64 \div 2 = 32 \]
\[ 32 \div 2 = 16 \]
\[ 16 \div 2 = 8 \]
\[ 8 \div 2 = 4 \]
\[ 4 \div 2 = 2 \]
\[ 2 \div 2 = 1 \]

So, the prime factorization of 64 is:
\[ 64 = 2 \times 2 \times 2 \times 2 \times 2 \times 2 = 2^6 \]

**Final Answer:**
The prime factorization of 64 is \( 2^6 \).

### Conclusion
Without a specific problem statement, I explored several common mathematical problems involving the number 64. If you have a specific problem in mind, please provide more details for a precise solution.
