==================================================

To solve the problem, we first need to understand what "Sample math problem 64" refers to. Since the problem statement is not fully clear, I will assume it involves the number 64 and explore a few common mathematical problems related to this number. Let's consider a few possibilities:

### Possibility 1: Square Root Problem
One common problem involving the number 64 is finding its square root.

**Step 1: Understanding the Problem**
The square root of a number \( x \) is a number \( y \) such that \( y^2 = x \).

**Step 2: Solving the Problem**
We need to find \( \sqrt{64} \).

**Step 3: Calculation**
\[ \sqrt{64} = 8 \]
This is because \( 8 \times 8 = 64 \).

**Step 4: Conclusion**
The square root of 64 is 8.

### Possibility 2: Exponentiation Problem
Another common problem is expressing 64 as a power of another number.

**Step 1: Understanding the Problem**
We want to express 64 as \( a^b \) where \( a \) and \( b \) are integers.

**Step 2: Solving the Problem**
64 can be expressed as a power of 2.

**Step 3: Calculation**
\[ 64 = 2^6 \]
This is because \( 2 \times 2 \times 2 \times 2 \times 2 \times 2 = 64 \).

**Step 4: Conclusion**
64 can be expressed as \( 2^6 \).

### Possibility 3: Factorization Problem
Another possibility is to factor the number 64.

**Step 1: Understanding the Problem**
We want to find the prime factorization of 64.

**Step 2: Solving the Problem**
We repeatedly divide by the smallest prime number, which is 2.

**Step 3: Calculation**
\[ 64 \div 2 = 32 \]
\[ 32 \div 2 = 16 \]
\[ 16 \div 2 = 8 \]
\[ 8 \div 2 = 4 \]
\[ 4 \div 2 = 2 \]
\[ 2 \div 2 = 1 \]

So, the prime factorization of 64 is \( 2^6 \).

**Step 4: Conclusion**
The prime factorization of 64 is \( 2^6 \).

### Final Answer
Since the problem statement "Sample math problem 64" is ambiguous, I have explored several common mathematical problems involving the number 64. Here are the conclusions for each possibility:

1. The square root of 64 is 8.
2. 64 can be expressed as \( 2^6 \).
3. The prime factorization of 64 is \( 2^6 \).

If you have a specific problem in mind involving the number 64, please provide more details for a precise solution.
