==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to understand what "Sample math problem 64" refers to. Since the problem statement is not fully clear, I'll assume that "64" is the main focus of the problem. Let's explore various mathematical contexts involving the number 64 and solve a problem related to it.

### Problem Contexts Involving 64

1. **Square Numbers**: 64 is a perfect square.
2. **Powers of 2**: 64 is a power of 2.
3. **Cube Numbers**: 64 is a perfect cube.

Given these contexts, let's explore each one:

#### 1. Square Numbers
64 is a perfect square because:
\[ 64 = 8^2 \]
This means that 8 multiplied by itself equals 64.

#### 2. Powers of 2
64 is a power of 2:
\[ 64 = 2^6 \]
This means that 2 multiplied by itself 6 times equals 64.

#### 3. Cube Numbers
64 is also a perfect cube:
\[ 64 = 4^3 \]
This means that 4 multiplied by itself twice (4 * 4 * 4) equals 64.

### Solving a Problem Involving 64

Let's solve a problem involving one of these contexts. We'll choose the context of powers of 2:

**Problem**: What is the value of \( 2^6 \)?

**Solution**:
To find the value of \( 2^6 \), we multiply 2 by itself 6 times:

\[
2^6 = 2 \times 2 \times 2 \times 2 \times 2 \times 2
\]

Let's calculate step by step:

1. \( 2 \times 2 = 4 \)
2. \( 4 \times 2 = 8 \)
3. \( 8 \times 2 = 16 \)
4. \( 16 \times 2 = 32 \)
5. \( 32 \times 2 = 64 \)

Thus, \( 2^6 = 64 \).

### Final Answer
The value of \( 2^6 \) is 64.
