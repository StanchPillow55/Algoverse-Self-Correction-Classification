Question ID: mathbench_64
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

Certainly! Let's work through the problem step by step.

The problem is: \( \sqrt{64} \).

### Step 1: Understand the Problem
The problem asks us to find the square root of 64. The square root of a number \( x \) is a number \( y \) such that \( y^2 = x \).

### Step 2: Identify Perfect Squares
First, we need to determine if 64 is a perfect square. A perfect square is an integer that is the square of another integer.

### Step 3: Calculate the Square Root
To find the square root of 64, we need to determine which integer squared equals 64.

- Start with smaller integers:
  - \( 1^2 = 1 \)
  - \( 2^2 = 4 \)
  - \( 3^2 = 9 \)
  - \( 4^2 = 16 \)
  - \( 5^2 = 25 \)
  - \( 6^2 = 36 \)
  - \( 7^2 = 49 \)
  - \( 8^2 = 64 \)

We find that \( 8^2 = 64 \).

### Step 4: Verify the Calculation
To ensure accuracy, let's verify:
- \( 8 \times 8 = 64 \)

The calculation confirms that 8 is indeed the square root of 64.

### Final Answer
The square root of 64 is \( \boxed{8} \).
