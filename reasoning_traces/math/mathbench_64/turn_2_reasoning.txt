==================================================

To solve the sample math problem "64," we need to first understand what the problem is asking. Since the problem is not fully specified, I'll assume it involves basic operations or properties related to the number 64. Let's explore a few possibilities:

### Possibility 1: Square Root
One common question involving the number 64 is finding its square root.

1. **Identify the problem**: Find the square root of 64.
2. **Recall the definition**: The square root of a number \( x \) is a number \( y \) such that \( y^2 = x \).
3. **Calculate**: We need to find \( y \) such that \( y^2 = 64 \).
   \[
   8^2 = 64
   \]
   Therefore, the square root of 64 is 8.

### Possibility 2: Powers of 2
Another common question might involve expressing 64 as a power of 2.

1. **Identify the problem**: Express 64 as a power of 2.
2. **Recall powers of 2**: \( 2^1 = 2 \), \( 2^2 = 4 \), \( 2^3 = 8 \), \( 2^4 = 16 \), \( 2^5 = 32 \), \( 2^6 = 64 \).
3. **Conclusion**: 
   \[
   64 = 2^6
   \]

### Possibility 3: Factorization
We might also be asked to factor 64 into its prime factors.

1. **Identify the problem**: Factor 64 into prime factors.
2. **Start dividing by the smallest prime**: 
   \[
   64 \div 2 = 32 \\
   32 \div 2 = 16 \\
   16 \div 2 = 8 \\
   8 \div 2 = 4 \\
   4 \div 2 = 2 \\
   2 \div 2 = 1
   \]
3. **Conclusion**: The prime factorization of 64 is \( 2^6 \).

### Possibility 4: Cube Root
Another interesting question could be finding the cube root of 64.

1. **Identify the problem**: Find the cube root of 64.
2. **Recall the definition**: The cube root of a number \( x \) is a number \( y \) such that \( y^3 = x \).
3. **Calculate**: We need to find \( y \) such that \( y^3 = 64 \).
   \[
   4^3 = 64
   \]
   Therefore, the cube root of 64 is 4.

### Final Answer
Since the problem "64" is not specified, I've explored several common mathematical operations involving the number 64. Here are the final answers for each possibility:

1. **Square root of 64**: 8
2. **64 as a power of 2**: \( 2^6 \)
3. **Prime factorization of 64**: \( 2^6 \)
4. **Cube root of 64**: 4
