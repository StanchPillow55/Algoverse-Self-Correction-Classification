Question ID: 282
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To determine how much Maddy will spend on pizza, we need to calculate the total number of people attending the soccer game and then find out how many pizzas are needed.

1. **Calculate the total number of attendees:**
   - There are 12 team members.
   - Each team member brings 2 guests, so the total number of guests is:
     \[
     12 \text{ team members} \times 2 \text{ guests/team member} = 24 \text{ guests}
     \]
   - There are also 3 coaches.
   - Therefore, the total number of attendees is:
     \[
     12 \text{ team members} + 24 \text{ guests} + 3 \text{ coaches} = 39 \text{ attendees}
     \]

2. **Determine how many pizzas are needed:**
   - Each pizza serves 3 people. To find out how many pizzas are needed, we divide the total number of attendees by the number of people each pizza serves:
     \[
     \text{Number of pizzas} = \frac{39 \text{ attendees}}{3 \text{ people/pizza}} = 13 \text{ pizzas}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total cost of the pizzas:**
   - Each pizza costs $15. Therefore, the total cost for 13 pizzas is:
     \[
     \text{Total cost} = 13 \text{ pizzas} \times 15 \text{ dollars/pizza} = 195 \text{ dollars}
     \]

Finally, Maddy will spend **$195** on pizza.
