==================================================

To find out how many stickers Riku has, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Identify the number of stickers Kristoff has**: According to the problem, Kristoff has 85 stickers.

2. **Determine how many times more stickers Riku has compared to Kristoff**: The problem states that Riku has 25 times more stickers than Kristoff.

3. **Calculate the number of stickers Riku has**: To find Riku's total number of stickers, we multiply the number of stickers Kristoff has by 25.

   \[
   \text{Number of stickers Riku has} = 25 \times \text{Number of stickers Kristoff has}
   \]

   Substituting the value we have:

   \[
   \text{Number of stickers Riku has} = 25 \times 85
   \]

4. **Perform the multiplication**:

   \[
   25 \times 85 = 2125
   \]

5. **Conclusion**: Riku has 2125 stickers.
