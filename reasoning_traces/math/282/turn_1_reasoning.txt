==================================================

To solve the problem of determining how many stickers Riku has, given that he has 25 times more stickers than Kristoff, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We know that Kristoff has 85 stickers.
   - Riku has 25 times more stickers than Kristoff.

2. **Translate the Problem into a Mathematical Expression:**
   - If Kristoff has 85 stickers, and Riku has 25 times more than Kristoff, we can express the number of stickers Riku has as:
     \[
     \text{Riku's stickers} = 25 \times \text{Kristoff's stickers}
     \]

3. **Substitute the Known Value:**
   - We know Kristoff's stickers = 85.
   - Substitute this value into the expression:
     \[
     \text{Riku's stickers} = 25 \times 85
     \]

4. **Perform the Calculation:**
   - To find the product of 25 and 85, we can break it down:
     \[
     25 \times 85 = 25 \times (80 + 5)
     \]
   - Use the distributive property:
     \[
     25 \times 85 = (25 \times 80) + (25 \times 5)
     \]
   - Calculate each part:
     \[
     25 \times 80 = 2000
     \]
     \[
     25 \times 5 = 125
     \]
   - Add the results:
     \[
     2000 + 125 = 2125
     \]

5. **Conclusion:**
   - Therefore, Riku has 2125 stickers.

The final answer is that Riku has 2125 stickers.
