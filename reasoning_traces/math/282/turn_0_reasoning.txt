==================================================

To determine how much Maddy will spend on pizzas for the soccer game, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of people attending:**
   - There are 12 team members.
   - Each team member brings 2 guests, so the total number of guests is:
     \[
     12 \text{ team members} \times 2 \text{ guests/team member} = 24 \text{ guests}
     \]
   - In addition to the team members and their guests, there are also 3 coaches.
   - Therefore, the total number of people is:
     \[
     12 \text{ team members} + 24 \text{ guests} + 3 \text{ coaches} = 39 \text{ people}
     \]

2. **Determine how many pizzas are needed:**
   - Each pizza serves 3 people. To find out how many pizzas are needed for 39 people, we divide the total number of people by the number of people each pizza serves:
     \[
     \frac{39 \text{ people}}{3 \text{ people/pizza}} = 13 \text{ pizzas}
     \]
   - Since we cannot order a fraction of a pizza, we round up to the nearest whole number. However, in this case, 39 is exactly divisible by 3, so we need exactly 13 pizzas.

3. **Calculate the total cost of the pizzas:**
   - Each pizza costs $15. Therefore, the total cost for 13 pizzas is:
     \[
     13 \text{ pizzas} \times 15 \text{ dollars/pizza} = 195 \text{ dollars}
     \]

4. **Final answer:**
   - Maddy will spend a total of **$195** on pizzas for the soccer game.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{195}
\]
