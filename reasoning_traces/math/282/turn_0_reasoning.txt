To solve the problem, we need to determine how many stickers Riku has, given that he has 25 times more stickers than Kristoff. We know that Kristoff has 85 stickers.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Understand the relationship**: The problem states that Riku has 25 times more stickers than Kristoff. This means that the number of stickers Riku has is 25 times the number of stickers Kristoff has.

2. **Identify the known quantity**: Kristoff has 85 stickers.

3. **Set up the equation**: To find the number of stickers Riku has, we can set up the following equation based on the relationship:

   \[
   \text{Number of stickers Riku has} = 25 \times \text{Number of stickers Kristoff has}
   \]

4. **Substitute the known value**: We know Kristoff has 85 stickers, so we substitute 85 into the equation:

   \[
   \text{Number of stickers Riku has} = 25 \times 85
   \]

5. **Perform the multiplication**: Now, we calculate the product of 25 and 85.

   \[
   25 \times 85 = 2125
   \]

   To verify this calculation, we can break it down further:

   - First, multiply 25 by 80:
     \[
     25 \times 80 = 2000
     \]

   - Next, multiply 25 by 5:
     \[
     25 \times 5 = 125
     \]

   - Add the two results together:
     \[
     2000 + 125 = 2125
     \]

6. **Conclusion**: Therefore, Riku has 2125 stickers.

The final answer is that Riku has 2125 stickers.
