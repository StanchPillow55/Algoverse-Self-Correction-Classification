==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to determine how many stickers Riku has based on the information given about Kristoff's stickers.

1. **Identify the number of stickers Kristoff has**: 
   - Kristoff has 85 stickers.

2. **Understand the relationship between Riku's and Kristoff's stickers**: 
   - The problem states that Riku has 25 times more stickers than Kristoff. This means we need to multiply the number of stickers Kristoff has by 25 to find out how many stickers Riku has.

3. **Set up the calculation**:
   - Let \( K \) represent the number of stickers Kristoff has, which is 85.
   - Let \( R \) represent the number of stickers Riku has.
   - According to the problem, we can express Riku's stickers as:
     \[
     R = 25 \times K
     \]

4. **Substitute the value of \( K \)**:
   - Now we substitute \( K \) with 85:
     \[
     R = 25 \times 85
     \]

5. **Perform the multiplication**:
   - We calculate \( 25 \times 85 \):
     \[
     25 \times 85 = 2125
     \]

6. **Conclusion**:
   - Therefore, Riku has 2125 stickers.

The final answer is:
\[
\text{Riku has } 2125 \text{ stickers.}
\]
