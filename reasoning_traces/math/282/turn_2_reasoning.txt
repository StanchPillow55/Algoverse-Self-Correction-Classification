Question ID: 282
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To find out how many stickers Riku has, we start by understanding the relationship between the number of stickers Riku has and the number of stickers Kristoff has.

1. **Identify the number of stickers Kristoff has**: 
   Kristoff has 85 stickers.

2. **Understand the relationship**: 
   The problem states that Riku has 25 times more stickers than Kristoff. This means we need to multiply the number of stickers Kristoff has by 25 to find out how many stickers Riku has.

3. **Set up the calculation**: 
   We can express the number of stickers Riku has (let's call it \( R \)) as:
   \[
   R = 25 \times \text{(number of stickers Kristoff has)}
   \]

4. **Substitute the value for Kristoff's stickers**: 
   Now we substitute the number of stickers Kristoff has into the equation:
   \[
   R = 25 \times 85
   \]

5. **Perform the multiplication**: 
   Now we calculate \( 25 \times 85 \):
   \[
   25 \times 85 = 2125
   \]

6. **Conclusion**: 
   Therefore, Riku has 2125 stickers.

Final answer:
Riku has **2125 stickers**.
