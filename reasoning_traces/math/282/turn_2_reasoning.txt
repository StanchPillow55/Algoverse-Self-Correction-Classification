==================================================

To solve the problem of determining how many stickers Riku has, given that he has 25 times more stickers than Kristoff, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Understand the Problem Statement:**
   - Kristoff has 85 stickers.
   - Riku has 25 times more stickers than Kristoff.

2. **Clarify the Meaning of "25 Times More":**
   - The phrase "25 times more" can sometimes be interpreted in different ways. However, in most mathematical contexts, "25 times more" means Riku has 25 times the amount Kristoff has, not Kristoff's amount plus 25 times Kristoff's amount.
   - Therefore, Riku's number of stickers is calculated as 25 times the number of stickers Kristoff has.

3. **Set Up the Calculation:**
   - Let \( K \) represent the number of stickers Kristoff has. So, \( K = 85 \).
   - Riku's stickers, \( R \), can be calculated as:
     \[
     R = 25 \times K
     \]

4. **Perform the Calculation:**
   - Substitute the value of \( K \) into the equation:
     \[
     R = 25 \times 85
     \]

5. **Calculate the Product:**
   - To find \( 25 \times 85 \), we can break it down:
     \[
     25 \times 85 = 25 \times (80 + 5) = (25 \times 80) + (25 \times 5)
     \]
   - Calculate each part:
     \[
     25 \times 80 = 2000
     \]
     \[
     25 \times 5 = 125
     \]
   - Add the results:
     \[
     2000 + 125 = 2125
     \]

6. **Conclusion:**
   - Riku has 2125 stickers.

Therefore, the final answer is that Riku has 2125 stickers.
