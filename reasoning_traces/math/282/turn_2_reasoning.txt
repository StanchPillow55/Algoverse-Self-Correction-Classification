Question ID: 282
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To determine how much Maddy will spend on pizza, we need to calculate the total number of people she needs to feed and then find out how many pizzas are required.

1. **Calculate the total number of people:**
   - There are 12 team members.
   - Each team member brings 2 guests, so the total number of guests is:
     \[
     12 \text{ team members} \times 2 \text{ guests/team member} = 24 \text{ guests}
     \]
   - There are also 3 coaches.
   - Therefore, the total number of people is:
     \[
     12 \text{ team members} + 24 \text{ guests} + 3 \text{ coaches} = 39 \text{ people}
     \]

2. **Determine how many pizzas are needed:**
   - Each pizza serves 3 people. To find out how many pizzas are needed, we divide the total number of people by the number of people each pizza serves:
     \[
     \text{Number of pizzas} = \frac{39 \text{ people}}{3 \text{ people/pizza}} = 13 \text{ pizzas}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total cost:**
   - Each pizza costs $15. Therefore, the total cost for 13 pizzas is:
     \[
     \text{Total cost} = 13 \text{ pizzas} \times 15 \text{ dollars/pizza} = 195 \text{ dollars}
     \]

Finally, Maddy will spend **$195** on pizza.
