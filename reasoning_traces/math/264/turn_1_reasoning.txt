==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total earnings of the Italian restaurant over the course of a month. We will break down the problem step by step.

### Step 1: Understand the Earnings Pattern
- The restaurant earns $600 every weekday.
- On weekends, the restaurant earns twice as much as on weekdays.

### Step 2: Determine the Number of Weekdays and Weekends in a Month
A typical month can have:
- 4 weeks (28 days) or 4 weeks and a few extra days (29, 30, or 31 days).
- Each week consists of 5 weekdays and 2 weekend days.

For simplicity, let's assume a month with 30 days. This is a common scenario and will help us illustrate the calculation process.

### Step 3: Calculate Earnings for a 30-Day Month
1. **Calculate the number of complete weeks:**
   \[
   \text{Number of complete weeks} = \frac{30}{7} \approx 4 \text{ weeks (with 2 extra days)}
   \]

2. **Calculate the number of weekdays and weekend days:**
   - In 4 complete weeks, there are:
     - \(4 \times 5 = 20\) weekdays
     - \(4 \times 2 = 8\) weekend days
   - The remaining 2 days can either be both weekdays, both weekend days, or one of each. For simplicity, let's assume they are one weekday and one weekend day (a common scenario).

   Therefore, for a 30-day month:
   - Total weekdays = \(20 + 1 = 21\)
   - Total weekend days = \(8 + 1 = 9\)

### Step 4: Calculate Total Earnings
1. **Earnings from weekdays:**
   \[
   \text{Weekday earnings} = 21 \times 600 = 12,600
   \]

2. **Earnings from weekends:**
   - Weekend earnings per day = \(2 \times 600 = 1,200\)
   \[
   \text{Weekend earnings} = 9 \times 1,200 = 10,800
   \]

3. **Total earnings for the month:**
   \[
   \text{Total earnings} = 12,600 + 10,800 = 23,400
   \]

### Final Answer
The Italian restaurant earns $23,400 by the end of a 30-day month.
