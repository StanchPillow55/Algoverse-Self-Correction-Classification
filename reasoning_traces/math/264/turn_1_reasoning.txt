To solve the problem, we need to calculate the total earnings of the Italian restaurant for a month, taking into account the different earnings on weekdays and weekends.

### Step 1: Identify the earnings on weekdays and weekends
- The restaurant earns **$600** every weekday.
- On weekends, it earns **twice as much** as on weekdays. Therefore, the weekend earnings are:
  \[
  2 \times 600 = 1200 \text{ dollars}
  \]

### Step 2: Determine the number of weekdays and weekends in a month
A typical month has about:
- **4 weeks** (which is 28 days) plus a few extra days (up to 3 days).
- Each week has **5 weekdays** (Monday to Friday) and **2 weekend days** (Saturday and Sunday).

To calculate the total number of weekdays and weekends in a month, we can break it down as follows:

1. **Weekdays in 4 weeks**:
   \[
   4 \text{ weeks} \times 5 \text{ weekdays/week} = 20 \text{ weekdays}
   \]

2. **Weekends in 4 weeks**:
   \[
   4 \text{ weeks} \times 2 \text{ weekend days/week} = 8 \text{ weekend days}
   \]

3. **Extra days**: Depending on the month, there can be 0 to 3 extra days. For simplicity, let's assume we are considering a month with 30 days. This means there are 2 extra days. We need to determine if these extra days are weekdays or weekends. 

   - If the month starts on a weekday, the extra days will be weekdays.
   - If the month starts on a weekend, the extra days will be weekends.

Assuming the month starts on a weekday, we can add 2 more weekdays:
- Total weekdays = \(20 + 2 = 22\)
- Total weekends = \(8\)

### Step 3: Calculate total earnings
Now we can calculate the total earnings for the month:

1. **Total earnings from weekdays**:
   \[
   22 \text{ weekdays} \times 600 \text{ dollars/weekday} = 13200 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Total earnings from weekends**:
   \[
   8 \text{ weekend days} \times 1200 \text{ dollars/weekend day} = 9600 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Total earnings for the month**:
   \[
   13200 \text{ dollars} + 9600 \text{ dollars} = 22800 \text{ dollars}
   \]

### Final Answer
The total earnings of the Italian restaurant by the end of the month is:
\[
\boxed{22800} \text{ dollars}
\]
