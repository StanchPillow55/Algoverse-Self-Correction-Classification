To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total earnings of the Italian restaurant for a month, considering its earnings on weekdays and weekends.

### Step-by-Step Calculation:

1. **Identify the Earnings:**
   - Weekday earnings: $600 per day
   - Weekend earnings: Twice the weekday earnings, so \(2 \times 600 = 1200\) per day

2. **Determine the Number of Days in a Month:**
   - A typical month can have 28, 30, or 31 days. For this problem, let's assume a 30-day month, which is a common scenario.

3. **Calculate the Number of Weekdays and Weekends:**
   - In a 30-day month, there are typically 4 weeks and 2 extra days.
   - Each week has 5 weekdays and 2 weekend days.
   - Total weekdays in 4 weeks: \(4 \times 5 = 20\)
   - Total weekend days in 4 weeks: \(4 \times 2 = 8\)
   - The 2 extra days can either be both weekdays, both weekend days, or one of each. For simplicity, let's assume they are one weekday and one weekend day (a common scenario in a 30-day month).

   Therefore, total weekdays = \(20 + 1 = 21\)  
   Total weekend days = \(8 + 1 = 9\)

4. **Calculate Total Earnings:**
   - Total earnings from weekdays: \(21 \times 600 = 12,600\)
   - Total earnings from weekend days: \(9 \times 1200 = 10,800\)

5. **Calculate Total Monthly Earnings:**
   - Total earnings = Earnings from weekdays + Earnings from weekends  
   \[
   12,600 + 10,800 = 23,400
   \]

### Final Answer:
The Italian restaurant earns $23,400 by the end of the month.
