==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to determine how much money each girl has and then find the total amount they have combined.

1. **Determine how much Carmen has:**
   - According to the problem, Carmen has $100.

2. **Determine how much Samantha has:**
   - The problem states that Samantha has $25 more than Carmen. 
   - Since Carmen has $100, we can calculate Samantha's amount as follows:
     \[
     \text{Samantha's amount} = \text{Carmen's amount} + 25 = 100 + 25 = 125
     \]
   - Therefore, Samantha has $125.

3. **Determine how much Daisy has:**
   - The problem states that Daisy has $50 more than Samantha.
   - Since Samantha has $125, we can calculate Daisy's amount as follows:
     \[
     \text{Daisy's amount} = \text{Samantha's amount} + 50 = 125 + 50 = 175
     \]
   - Therefore, Daisy has $175.

4. **Calculate the total amount of money all three girls have combined:**
   - Now we need to add the amounts that Carmen, Samantha, and Daisy have:
     \[
     \text{Total amount} = \text{Carmen's amount} + \text{Samantha's amount} + \text{Daisy's amount}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total amount} = 100 + 125 + 175
     \]

5. **Perform the addition:**
   - First, add Carmen's and Samantha's amounts:
     \[
     100 + 125 = 225
     \]
   - Next, add Daisy's amount to the result:
     \[
     225 + 175 = 400
     \]

Thus, the total amount of money that all three girls have combined is **$400**.

Final answer: **$400**.
