To solve the problem, we need to calculate the total earnings of the Italian restaurant over the course of a month, taking into account the different earnings on weekdays and weekends.

1. **Identify the earnings on weekdays and weekends:**
   - The restaurant earns $600 every weekday.
   - On weekends, it earns twice as much, which is \( 2 \times 600 = 1200 \) dollars.

2. **Determine the number of weekdays and weekends in a month:**
   - A typical month has about 30 days. 
   - In a week, there are 5 weekdays (Monday to Friday) and 2 weekend days (Saturday and Sunday).
   - To find the number of weekdays and weekends in a month, we can calculate:
     - Number of weeks in a month: \( \frac{30 \text{ days}}{7 \text{ days/week}} \approx 4.29 \) weeks.
     - Therefore, in 4 full weeks, there are:
       - Weekdays: \( 4 \text{ weeks} \times 5 \text{ weekdays/week} = 20 \text{ weekdays} \)
       - Weekends: \( 4 \text{ weeks} \times 2 \text{ weekend days/week} = 8 \text{ weekend days} \)
     - For the remaining 2 days (30 - 28 = 2), we need to determine if they are weekdays or weekends. Assuming the month starts on a weekday, the 29th and 30th days will also be weekdays. Thus, we add 2 more weekdays.

   - Total weekdays in the month: \( 20 + 2 = 22 \)
   - Total weekends in the month: \( 8 \)

3. **Calculate total earnings for weekdays and weekends:**
   - Total earnings from weekdays:
     \[
     \text{Total weekday earnings} = \text{Number of weekdays} \times \text{Earnings per weekday} = 22 \times 600 = 13200 \text{ dollars}
     \]
   - Total earnings from weekends:
     \[
     \text{Total weekend earnings} = \text{Number of weekend days} \times \text{Earnings per weekend day} = 8 \times 1200 = 9600 \text{ dollars}
     \]

4. **Calculate total earnings for the month:**
   - Total earnings for the month:
     \[
     \text{Total earnings} = \text{Total weekday earnings} + \text{Total weekend earnings} = 13200 + 9600 = 22800 \text{ dollars}
     \]

5. **Final answer:**
   The Italian restaurant earns a total of **$22,800** by the end of the month.
