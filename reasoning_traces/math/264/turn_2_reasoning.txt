==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to calculate the total earnings of the restaurant for a month, taking into account the different earnings on weekdays and weekends.

### Step 1: Determine the earnings on weekdays and weekends.

1. **Earnings on weekdays**: The restaurant earns $600 every weekday.
2. **Earnings on weekends**: The restaurant earns twice as much on the weekend, which is:
   \[
   2 \times 600 = 1200 \text{ dollars}
   \]

### Step 2: Determine the number of weekdays and weekends in a month.

A typical month has about 30 days. We can break this down into weekdays and weekends.

1. **Weekdays**: There are 5 weekdays in a week (Monday to Friday).
2. **Weekends**: There are 2 weekend days in a week (Saturday and Sunday).

In a 30-day month, we can calculate the number of weeks:
\[
\text{Number of weeks} = \frac{30 \text{ days}}{7 \text{ days/week}} \approx 4.29 \text{ weeks}
\]
This means there are approximately 4 full weeks and a few extra days.

### Step 3: Calculate the number of weekdays and weekends.

1. **Full weeks**: In 4 full weeks, there are:
   - Weekdays: \(4 \text{ weeks} \times 5 \text{ weekdays/week} = 20 \text{ weekdays}\)
   - Weekends: \(4 \text{ weeks} \times 2 \text{ weekend days/week} = 8 \text{ weekend days}\)

2. **Extra days**: The remaining 2 days in a 30-day month can be either weekdays or weekends. Assuming the month starts on a Monday, the extra days would be Monday and Tuesday, which are both weekdays. Thus:
   - Extra weekdays: 2
   - Extra weekends: 0

### Step 4: Total weekdays and weekends.

Now we can sum up the total weekdays and weekends:
- Total weekdays: \(20 + 2 = 22\)
- Total weekends: \(8 + 0 = 8\)

### Step 5: Calculate total earnings.

1. **Total earnings from weekdays**:
   \[
   \text{Earnings from weekdays} = 22 \text{ weekdays} \times 600 \text{ dollars/weekday} = 13200 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Total earnings from weekends**:
   \[
   \text{Earnings from weekends} = 8 \text{ weekend days} \times 1200 \text{ dollars/weekend day} = 9600 \text{ dollars}
   \]

### Step 6: Total earnings for the month.

Finally, we add the earnings from weekdays and weekends:
\[
\text{Total earnings} = 13200 \text{ dollars} + 9600 \text{ dollars} = 22800 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Final Answer:
The restaurant earns **$22,800** by the end of the month.
