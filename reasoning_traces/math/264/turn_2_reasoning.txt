Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total earnings of the Italian restaurant over the course of a month, taking into account the different earnings on weekdays and weekends.

### Step-by-Step Calculation:

1. **Identify the Earnings:**
   - Weekday earnings: $600 per day
   - Weekend earnings: Twice the weekday earnings, so \(2 \times 600 = 1200\) dollars per day

2. **Determine the Number of Days in a Month:**
   - A typical month can have 28, 30, or 31 days. For this problem, let's assume a 30-day month, which is a common scenario.

3. **Calculate the Number of Weekdays and Weekends:**
   - In a 30-day month, there are typically 4 weeks and 2 extra days.
   - Each week has 5 weekdays and 2 weekend days.
   - Therefore, in 4 weeks, there are:
     - \(4 \times 5 = 20\) weekdays
     - \(4 \times 2 = 8\) weekend days
   - The 2 extra days can either be both weekdays, both weekend days, or one of each. For simplicity, let's assume they are one weekday and one weekend day (a common scenario).

4. **Total Days Calculation:**
   - Total weekdays = 20 (from 4 weeks) + 1 (extra day) = 21 weekdays
   - Total weekend days = 8 (from 4 weeks) + 1 (extra day) = 9 weekend days

5. **Calculate Total Earnings:**
   - Total earnings from weekdays = \(21 \times 600 = 12,600\) dollars
   - Total earnings from weekends = \(9 \times 1200 = 10,800\) dollars

6. **Calculate Total Monthly Earnings:**
   - Total earnings for the month = Earnings from weekdays + Earnings from weekends
   - Total earnings = \(12,600 + 10,800 = 23,400\) dollars

### Final Answer:
The Italian restaurant earns $23,400 by the end of the month.
