==================================================

To solve the problem, we first need to understand what "Sample math problem 487" refers to. Since the problem statement is not provided, I'll assume it involves a typical math problem scenario. Let's create a hypothetical math problem and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**

"487 people attended a concert. If each ticket costs $15, how much total revenue was generated from ticket sales?"

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Identify the Given Information:**
   - Number of attendees: 487
   - Cost per ticket: $15

2. **Determine What Needs to be Calculated:**
   - We need to calculate the total revenue generated from ticket sales.

3. **Set Up the Calculation:**
   - Total revenue can be calculated by multiplying the number of attendees by the cost per ticket.

4. **Perform the Calculation:**
   \[
   \text{Total Revenue} = \text{Number of Attendees} \times \text{Cost per Ticket}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total Revenue} = 487 \times 15
   \]

5. **Calculate the Product:**
   - To multiply 487 by 15, we can use the standard multiplication method:
     \[
     487 \times 15 = 487 \times (10 + 5) = 487 \times 10 + 487 \times 5
     \]

   - First, calculate \(487 \times 10\):
     \[
     487 \times 10 = 4870
     \]

   - Next, calculate \(487 \times 5\):
     \[
     487 \times 5 = (400 + 80 + 7) \times 5 = 400 \times 5 + 80 \times 5 + 7 \times 5
     \]
     \[
     400 \times 5 = 2000
     \]
     \[
     80 \times 5 = 400
     \]
     \[
     7 \times 5 = 35
     \]
     \[
     487 \times 5 = 2000 + 400 + 35 = 2435
     \]

   - Add the two results together:
     \[
     4870 + 2435 = 7305
     \]

6. **Conclusion:**
   - The total revenue generated from ticket sales is $7305.

**Final Answer:**
The total revenue generated from ticket sales is $7305.
