==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 487," we first need to understand what the problem is asking. However, the problem statement "Sample math problem 487" is not specific, and it does not provide any details or context about what the problem entails. Therefore, I will assume that "487" might refer to a specific math problem number in a textbook or a collection of problems, but without additional information, I cannot determine what the problem is.

To proceed, let's consider a hypothetical math problem involving the number 487. We can create a problem and solve it step by step. Let's assume the problem is as follows:

**Problem:** Find the sum of the digits of the number 487.

**Step-by-step Solution:**

1. **Identify the digits of the number 487:**
   - The number 487 consists of three digits: 4, 8, and 7.

2. **Add the digits together:**
   - Sum = 4 + 8 + 7

3. **Perform the addition:**
   - First, add 4 and 8:
     \[
     4 + 8 = 12
     \]
   - Next, add the result to 7:
     \[
     12 + 7 = 19
     \]

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The sum of the digits of the number 487 is 19.

Therefore, if the problem was to find the sum of the digits of 487, the final answer would be 19. If you have a specific math problem in mind, please provide more details so I can assist you further.
