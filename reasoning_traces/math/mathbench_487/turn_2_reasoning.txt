==================================================

To solve the problem, I need to first understand what "Sample math problem 487" refers to. Since I don't have access to external databases or specific problem sets, I'll assume this is a placeholder for a typical math problem. Let's create a sample math problem and solve it step by step.

**Sample Math Problem 487:**

"Calculate the value of \( x \) in the equation \( 3x + 7 = 22 \)."

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Equation:**
   The equation given is \( 3x + 7 = 22 \). This is a linear equation in one variable, \( x \).

2. **Isolate the Variable:**
   To find the value of \( x \), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We can start by eliminating the constant term on the left side.

   \[
   3x + 7 = 22
   \]

   Subtract 7 from both sides to remove the constant term:

   \[
   3x + 7 - 7 = 22 - 7
   \]

   Simplifying both sides gives:

   \[
   3x = 15
   \]

3. **Solve for \( x \):**
   Now, we need to solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides of the equation by the coefficient of \( x \), which is 3.

   \[
   \frac{3x}{3} = \frac{15}{3}
   \]

   Simplifying both sides gives:

   \[
   x = 5
   \]

4. **Verify the Solution:**
   To ensure our solution is correct, we can substitute \( x = 5 \) back into the original equation and check if both sides are equal.

   Substitute \( x = 5 \) into \( 3x + 7 = 22 \):

   \[
   3(5) + 7 = 22
   \]

   Simplifying the left side:

   \[
   15 + 7 = 22
   \]

   \[
   22 = 22
   \]

   Since both sides of the equation are equal, our solution is verified.

**Final Answer:**

The value of \( x \) is \( 5 \).
