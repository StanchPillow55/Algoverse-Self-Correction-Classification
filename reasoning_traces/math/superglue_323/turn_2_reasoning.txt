Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we first need to understand what "Sample reasoning question 323" refers to. Since the question doesn't provide specific details, I'll assume it's a placeholder for a typical math problem. Let's create a hypothetical problem and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**

"Calculate the area of a triangle with a base of 10 units and a height of 5 units."

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Identify the Formula:**
   The formula for the area of a triangle is:
   \[
   \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height}
   \]

2. **Substitute the Given Values:**
   We are given the base as 10 units and the height as 5 units. Substitute these values into the formula:
   \[
   \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times 10 \times 5
   \]

3. **Perform the Multiplication:**
   First, multiply the base and the height:
   \[
   10 \times 5 = 50
   \]

4. **Calculate the Area:**
   Now, multiply the result by \(\frac{1}{2}\):
   \[
   \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times 50 = 25
   \]

5. **Final Answer:**
   The area of the triangle is 25 square units.

By following these steps, we have calculated the area of the triangle using the given base and height. The final answer is 25 square units.
