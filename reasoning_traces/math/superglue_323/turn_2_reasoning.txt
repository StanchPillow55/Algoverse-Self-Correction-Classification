Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem effectively, I need more specific information about "Sample reasoning question 323" as it is not provided in the prompt. However, I can guide you through a general approach to solving a reasoning or math problem by breaking it down into steps. Here's a generic framework:

### Step 1: Understand the Problem
- **Read the problem carefully**: Identify what is being asked. Look for keywords that indicate mathematical operations or logical reasoning.
- **Identify knowns and unknowns**: Determine what information is given and what needs to be found.

### Step 2: Plan a Strategy
- **Choose a method**: Depending on the problem, decide whether to use algebra, geometry, logic, or another area of mathematics.
- **Consider similar problems**: Think about how similar problems were solved and if those methods can be applied here.

### Step 3: Execute the Plan
- **Carry out calculations**: Perform any necessary calculations step by step. Show all work to avoid mistakes.
- **Use logical reasoning**: If the problem involves logic, carefully consider each step and ensure it follows logically from the previous one.

### Step 4: Review and Conclude
- **Check your work**: Verify each step to ensure there are no errors in calculations or logic.
- **State the final answer**: Clearly write down the final answer, ensuring it addresses the question asked.

### Example Problem
Since I don't have the specifics of "Sample reasoning question 323," let's consider a simple example:

**Problem**: Solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).

#### Step 1: Understand the Problem
- We need to find the value of \( x \) that satisfies the equation.

#### Step 2: Plan a Strategy
- This is a basic algebra problem. We can isolate \( x \) by performing inverse operations.

#### Step 3: Execute the Plan
1. **Subtract 3 from both sides**:  
   \[
   2x + 3 - 3 = 11 - 3
   \]
   \[
   2x = 8
   \]

2. **Divide both sides by 2**:  
   \[
   \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{8}{2}
   \]
   \[
   x = 4
   \]

#### Step 4: Review and Conclude
- **Check the solution**: Substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation to verify:
  \[
  2(4) + 3 = 8 + 3 = 11
  \]
  The left side equals the right side, confirming the solution is correct.

- **Final Answer**: \( x = 4 \)
