==================================================

To solve the problem effectively, let's first understand what "Sample reasoning question 323" might entail. Since the problem statement is not explicitly given, I'll assume it's a generic math problem that requires logical reasoning and step-by-step calculations. I'll create a hypothetical problem and solve it accordingly.

**Hypothetical Problem:**

A company produces two types of widgets: Type A and Type B. The company sells Type A widgets for $50 each and Type B widgets for $70 each. Last month, the company sold a total of 500 widgets and earned $30,000 in revenue. How many of each type of widget did the company sell?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( x \) be the number of Type A widgets sold.
   - Let \( y \) be the number of Type B widgets sold.

2. **Set Up Equations:**
   - The total number of widgets sold is 500:
     \[
     x + y = 500
     \]
   - The total revenue from selling the widgets is $30,000:
     \[
     50x + 70y = 30,000
     \]

3. **Solve the System of Equations:**

   We have the following system of equations:
   \[
   \begin{align*}
   x + y &= 500 \quad \text{(Equation 1)} \\
   50x + 70y &= 30,000 \quad \text{(Equation 2)}
   \end{align*}
   \]

   **Substitution Method:**

   From Equation 1, express \( y \) in terms of \( x \):
   \[
   y = 500 - x
   \]

   Substitute \( y = 500 - x \) into Equation 2:
   \[
   50x + 70(500 - x) = 30,000
   \]

   Simplify and solve for \( x \):
   \[
   50x + 35,000 - 70x = 30,000
   \]
   \[
   -20x + 35,000 = 30,000
   \]
   \[
   -20x = 30,000 - 35,000
   \]
   \[
   -20x = -5,000
   \]
   \[
   x = \frac{-5,000}{-20}
   \]
   \[
   x = 250
   \]

   Substitute \( x = 250 \) back into the expression for \( y \):
   \[
   y = 500 - 250
   \]
   \[
   y = 250
   \]

4. **Conclusion:**

   The company sold 250 Type A widgets and 250 Type B widgets.

**Final Answer:**
The company sold 250 Type A widgets and 250 Type B widgets.
