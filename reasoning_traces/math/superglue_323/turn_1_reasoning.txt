To solve this problem, I need more information about what "Sample reasoning question 323" entails. Since the problem statement is not provided, I will demonstrate how to approach a generic math problem by outlining the steps typically involved in solving a math problem.

### Step-by-Step Approach to Solving a Math Problem

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - Carefully read the problem statement.
   - Identify what is being asked.
   - Determine what information is given and what needs to be found.

2. **Devise a Plan:**
   - Consider possible strategies to solve the problem. This could include:
     - Drawing a diagram.
     - Writing an equation.
     - Breaking the problem into smaller parts.
     - Looking for patterns.

   - Execute the chosen strategy.
   - Perform calculations carefully.
   - Keep track of units and ensure consistency.
   - Show all steps clearly.

4. **Check Your Work:**
   - Verify each step of your solution.
   - Check calculations for errors.
   - Ensure the solution makes sense in the context of the problem.
   - Consider alternative methods to confirm the result.

5. **State the Final Answer:**
   - Clearly write the final answer.
   - Include units if applicable.
   - Ensure the answer addresses the question asked.

### Example Problem

Let's apply this approach to a simple example problem:

**Problem:** Solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).

**Step 1: Understand the Problem**
- We need to find the value of \( x \) that satisfies the equation.

**Step 2: Devise a Plan**
- We can isolate \( x \) by performing algebraic operations.

**Step 3: Carry Out the Plan**
- Start with the equation: \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).
- Subtract 3 from both sides to isolate the term with \( x \):
  \[
  2x + 3 - 3 = 11 - 3
  \]
  \[
  2x = 8
  \]
- Divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( x \):
  \[
  x = \frac{8}{2}
  \]
  \[
  x = 4
  \]

**Step 4: Check Your Work**
- Substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation to verify:
  \[
  2(4) + 3 = 11
  \]
  \[
  8 + 3 = 11
  \]
  - The left side equals the right side, confirming the solution is correct.

**Step 5: State the Final Answer**
- The solution to the equation is \( x = 4 \).
