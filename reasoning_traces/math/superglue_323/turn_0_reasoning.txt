==================================================

To solve the problem, I need more specific details about "Sample reasoning question 323." Since the question isn't provided, I'll demonstrate how to approach a typical math problem by creating an example problem and solving it step by step.

### Example Problem:
**Question:** A car travels 150 miles in 3 hours. What is the average speed of the car in miles per hour?

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We need to find the average speed of the car.
   - We know the total distance traveled is 150 miles.
   - The total time taken is 3 hours.

2. **Identify the Formula:**
   - Average speed is calculated using the formula:
     \[
     \text{Average Speed} = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Total Time}}
     \]

3. **Substitute the Known Values:**
   - Total Distance = 150 miles
   - Total Time = 3 hours
   - Substitute these values into the formula:
     \[
     \text{Average Speed} = \frac{150 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ hours}}
     \]

4. **Perform the Calculation:**
   - Divide 150 by 3:
     \[
     \text{Average Speed} = 50 \text{ miles per hour}
     \]

5. **Verify the Solution:**
   - Check if the units are correct: We have miles per hour, which is appropriate for speed.
   - Ensure the calculation makes sense: Traveling 150 miles in 3 hours at 50 miles per hour is reasonable.

6. **State the Final Answer:**
   - The average speed of the car is 50 miles per hour.

This is how you would solve a typical math problem by breaking it down into steps, performing calculations, and verifying the solution. If you have a specific problem or question, please provide the details, and I can work through that particular problem for you.
