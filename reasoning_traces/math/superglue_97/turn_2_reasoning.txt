==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 97" entails. Since the problem statement is not explicitly provided, I'll approach this as a hypothetical reasoning problem and demonstrate how to solve it step by step.

Let's assume "Sample reasoning question 97" is a typical math problem involving basic arithmetic or algebra. I'll create a sample problem and solve it:

**Sample Problem:**
A store sells apples at $2 each and oranges at $3 each. If a customer buys a total of 10 fruits consisting of apples and oranges and spends $25, how many apples and how many oranges did the customer buy?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( a \) be the number of apples.
   - Let \( o \) be the number of oranges.

2. **Set Up Equations:**
   - We know the total number of fruits is 10: 
     \[
     a + o = 10
     \]
   - We also know the total cost is $25:
     \[
     2a + 3o = 25
     \]

3. **Solve the System of Equations:**
   - From the first equation, express \( o \) in terms of \( a \):
     \[
     o = 10 - a
     \]
   - Substitute \( o = 10 - a \) into the second equation:
     \[
     2a + 3(10 - a) = 25
     \]
   - Simplify and solve for \( a \):
     \[
     2a + 30 - 3a = 25
     \]
     \[
     -a + 30 = 25
     \]
     \[
     -a = 25 - 30
     \]
     \[
     -a = -5
     \]
     \[
     a = 5
     \]

4. **Find the Number of Oranges:**
   - Substitute \( a = 5 \) back into the equation for \( o \):
     \[
     o = 10 - a = 10 - 5 = 5
     \]

5. **Verify the Solution:**
   - Check the total number of fruits:
     \[
     a + o = 5 + 5 = 10
     \]
   - Check the total cost:
     \[
     2a + 3o = 2(5) + 3(5) = 10 + 15 = 25
     \]

Both conditions are satisfied, confirming our solution is correct.

**Final Answer:**
The customer bought 5 apples and 5 oranges.
