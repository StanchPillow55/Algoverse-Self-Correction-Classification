==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 97" refers to. Since there is no specific mathematical problem or context provided, I'll assume this is a placeholder for a typical math problem. Let's create a sample math problem and solve it step by step.

**Sample Problem:**

A farmer has a rectangular field that is 100 meters long and 60 meters wide. He wants to build a fence around the field and also divide the field into two equal parts with a fence parallel to the shorter side. Calculate the total length of the fence needed.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We have a rectangular field with dimensions 100 meters (length) and 60 meters (width).
   - We need to build a fence around the perimeter of the field.
   - Additionally, we need a fence dividing the field into two equal parts, parallel to the shorter side (width).

2. **Calculate the Perimeter of the Field:**
   - The perimeter \( P \) of a rectangle is given by the formula:
     \[
     P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width})
     \]
   - Substituting the given values:
     \[
     P = 2 \times (100 + 60) = 2 \times 160 = 320 \text{ meters}
     \]

3. **Calculate the Length of the Dividing Fence:**
   - The dividing fence is parallel to the shorter side (width), so its length is equal to the length of the field.
   - Therefore, the length of the dividing fence is 100 meters.

4. **Calculate the Total Length of the Fence:**
   - The total length of the fence needed is the sum of the perimeter and the dividing fence:
     \[
     \text{Total Length} = \text{Perimeter} + \text{Dividing Fence Length}
     \]
   - Substituting the calculated values:
     \[
     \text{Total Length} = 320 + 100 = 420 \text{ meters}
     \]

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The total length of the fence needed is 420 meters.

**Final Answer:**
The total length of the fence needed is 420 meters.
