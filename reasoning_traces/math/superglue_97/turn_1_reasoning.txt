Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 97" refers to. Since the problem statement is not explicitly provided, I'll assume this is a placeholder for a typical reasoning or math problem. Let's create a hypothetical problem and solve it step-by-step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**

A train travels from City A to City B, a distance of 180 miles. The train travels the first half of the distance at a speed of 60 miles per hour and the second half at a speed of 90 miles per hour. What is the average speed of the train for the entire journey?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - Total distance = 180 miles.
   - First half distance = 180/2 = 90 miles.
   - Second half distance = 90 miles.
   - Speed for the first half = 60 mph.
   - Speed for the second half = 90 mph.

2. **Calculate Time for Each Half:**
   - Time for the first half = Distance / Speed = 90 miles / 60 mph = 1.5 hours.
   - Time for the second half = Distance / Speed = 90 miles / 90 mph = 1 hour.

3. **Calculate Total Time:**
   - Total time = Time for first half + Time for second half = 1.5 hours + 1 hour = 2.5 hours.

4. **Calculate Average Speed:**
   - Average speed is defined as the total distance traveled divided by the total time taken.
   - Average speed = Total distance / Total time = 180 miles / 2.5 hours = 72 mph.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The average speed of the train for the entire journey is 72 miles per hour.

**Final Answer:**
The average speed of the train for the entire journey is 72 miles per hour.
