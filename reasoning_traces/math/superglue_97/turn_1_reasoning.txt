==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 97" refers to. Since the question is not explicitly provided, I'll assume it's a placeholder for a typical math problem. Let's create a hypothetical math problem and solve it step-by-step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**

A farmer has a rectangular field that is 150 meters long and 100 meters wide. He wants to divide the field into two equal parts by constructing a fence parallel to the shorter side. Calculate the length of the fence needed and the area of each part after the division.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We have a rectangular field with dimensions 150 meters (length) and 100 meters (width).
   - The field needs to be divided into two equal parts by a fence parallel to the shorter side (width).

2. **Determine the Orientation of the Fence:**
   - Since the fence is parallel to the shorter side (100 meters), it will run along the length of the field.

3. **Calculate the Length of the Fence:**
   - The fence will be as long as the length of the field, which is 150 meters.

4. **Calculate the Area of the Entire Field:**
   - Area of the rectangle = length × width = 150 meters × 100 meters = 15,000 square meters.

5. **Calculate the Area of Each Part After Division:**
   - Since the field is divided into two equal parts, each part will have half the area of the entire field.
   - Area of each part = Total area / 2 = 15,000 square meters / 2 = 7,500 square meters.

6. **Verify the Division:**
   - Each part is a rectangle with dimensions 150 meters (length) and 50 meters (width).
   - Area of each part = 150 meters × 50 meters = 7,500 square meters, which matches our calculation.

**Final Answer:**
- The length of the fence needed is 150 meters.
- The area of each part after the division is 7,500 square meters.
