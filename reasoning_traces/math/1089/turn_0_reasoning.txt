To solve the problem, we need to determine how high the bouncy ball goes on its second bounce after being dropped from the third-floor balcony.

### Step 1: Calculate the initial height from which the ball is dropped.

Each story of the building is 24 feet high, and Nathan drops the ball from the third floor. Therefore, the initial height \( h_0 \) from which the ball is dropped is:

\[
h_0 = 3 \text{ stories} \times 24 \text{ feet/story} = 72 \text{ feet}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the height after the first bounce.

The ball bounces to \( \frac{2}{3} \) of its previous height with each bounce. After the first bounce, the height \( h_1 \) can be calculated as follows:

\[
h_1 = h_0 \times \frac{2}{3}
\]

Substituting the initial height:

\[
h_1 = 72 \text{ feet} \times \frac{2}{3}
\]

Calculating this gives:

\[
h_1 = 72 \times \frac{2}{3} = 72 \times 0.6667 = 48 \text{ feet}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the height after the second bounce.

Now, we need to find the height after the second bounce \( h_2 \). This height is \( \frac{2}{3} \) of the height after the first bounce:

\[
h_2 = h_1 \times \frac{2}{3}
\]

Substituting the height after the first bounce:

\[
h_2 = 48 \text{ feet} \times \frac{2}{3}
\]

Calculating this gives:

\[
h_2 = 48 \times \frac{2}{3} = 48 \times 0.6667 = 32 \text{ feet}
\]

### Conclusion

The height the ball reaches on its second bounce is:

\[
\boxed{32 \text{ feet}}
\]
