==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of Silvia's order before the discount, determine if the order qualifies for the discount, and then apply the discount if applicable.

**Step 1: Calculate the cost of each item in the order.**

- **Quiches:** Silvia orders 2 quiches at $15.00 each.
  \[
  \text{Cost of quiches} = 2 \times 15.00 = 30.00
  \]

- **Croissants:** Silvia orders 6 croissants at $3.00 each.
  \[
  \text{Cost of croissants} = 6 \times 3.00 = 18.00
  \]

- **Buttermilk biscuits:** Silvia orders 6 buttermilk biscuits at $2.00 each.
  \[
  \text{Cost of biscuits} = 6 \times 2.00 = 12.00
  \]

**Step 2: Calculate the total cost of the order before the discount.**

Add the costs of all the items together:
\[
\text{Total cost before discount} = 30.00 + 18.00 + 12.00 = 60.00
\]

**Step 3: Determine if the order qualifies for the discount.**

The discount is applicable for orders over $50.00. Since Silvia's total order is $60.00, it qualifies for the discount.

**Step 4: Calculate the discount amount.**

The discount is 10% of the total order cost. Calculate 10% of $60.00:
\[
\text{Discount amount} = 0.10 \times 60.00 = 6.00
\]

**Step 5: Calculate the total cost after applying the discount.**

Subtract the discount amount from the total cost before the discount:
\[
\text{Total cost after discount} = 60.00 - 6.00 = 54.00
\]

**Final Answer:**

Silvia's order will cost $54.00 after applying the 10% discount.
