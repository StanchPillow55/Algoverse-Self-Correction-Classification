==================================================

To determine the total cost of Silvia's bakery order and apply the discount, we will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the cost of each item:**
   - **Quiches:** Silvia orders 2 quiches at $15.00 each.
     \[
     \text{Cost of quiches} = 2 \times 15.00 = 30.00
     \]
   - **Croissants:** She orders 6 croissants at $3.00 each.
     \[
     \text{Cost of croissants} = 6 \times 3.00 = 18.00
     \]
   - **Buttermilk biscuits:** She orders 6 buttermilk biscuits at $2.00 each.
     \[
     \text{Cost of buttermilk biscuits} = 6 \times 2.00 = 12.00
     \]

2. **Calculate the total cost before discount:**
   Now, we will sum the costs of all the items:
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = \text{Cost of quiches} + \text{Cost of croissants} + \text{Cost of buttermilk biscuits}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = 30.00 + 18.00 + 12.00 = 60.00
   \]

3. **Check if the total qualifies for a discount:**
   Silvia's total order is $60.00, which is over $50.00. Therefore, she qualifies for a 10% discount.

4. **Calculate the discount amount:**
   The discount is 10% of the total cost:
   \[
   \text{Discount} = 0.10 \times \text{Total cost} = 0.10 \times 60.00 = 6.00
   \]

5. **Calculate the final cost after applying the discount:**
   We subtract the discount from the total cost:
   \[
   \text{Final cost} = \text{Total cost} - \text{Discount} = 60.00 - 6.00 = 54.00
   \]

Thus, the final amount Silvia will pay after applying the discount is:

\[
\boxed{54.00}
\]
