==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to determine how much money Jimmy has based on the information provided about Ethel's money.

1. **Identify the amount of money Ethel has**: 
   According to the problem, Ethel has $8.

2. **Understand the relationship between Jimmy's and Ethel's money**: 
   The problem states that Jimmy has $2 more than twice the amount of money Ethel has. We can express this relationship mathematically.

3. **Calculate twice the amount of money Ethel has**: 
   Since Ethel has $8, we calculate twice that amount:
   \[
   2 \times 8 = 16
   \]

4. **Add $2 to twice Ethel's amount**: 
   Now, we need to find out how much Jimmy has by adding $2 to the result we just calculated:
   \[
   16 + 2 = 18
   \]

5. **Conclusion**: 
   Therefore, Jimmy has $18.

Putting it all together, we can summarize the steps:
- Ethel has $8.
- Twice Ethel's amount is $16.
- Adding $2 gives us Jimmy's total: $18.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\text{Jimmy has } \$18.
\]
