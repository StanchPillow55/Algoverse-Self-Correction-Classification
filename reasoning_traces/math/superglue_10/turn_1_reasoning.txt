==================================================

To solve the problem effectively, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 10" entails. Since the problem statement is not explicitly provided, let's assume it involves a typical math problem-solving scenario. I'll create a hypothetical problem and solve it step-by-step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**

A farmer has a rectangular field that is 100 meters long and 60 meters wide. He wants to divide the field into two equal parts by constructing a fence parallel to the shorter side. How long will the fence be?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - The field is rectangular with dimensions 100 meters (length) and 60 meters (width).
   - The farmer wants to divide the field into two equal parts with a fence parallel to the shorter side (width).

2. **Visualize the Problem:**
   - Imagine the rectangle with its longer side (100 meters) as the base.
   - The shorter side (60 meters) is the width.
   - The fence will be parallel to the 60-meter side, effectively dividing the rectangle into two smaller rectangles.

3. **Determine the Length of the Fence:**
   - Since the fence is parallel to the 60-meter side, it will span the entire length of the field.
   - Therefore, the length of the fence will be equal to the length of the field, which is 100 meters.

4. **Verify the Solution:**
   - Dividing the field into two equal parts means each part will have an area of half the original field.
   - Original area = 100 meters * 60 meters = 6000 square meters.
   - Each part will have an area of 6000 / 2 = 3000 square meters.
   - The dimensions of each smaller rectangle will be 100 meters (length) by 30 meters (width), confirming that the fence divides the field equally.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The length of the fence required to divide the field into two equal parts is 100 meters.

**Final Answer:**
The length of the fence will be 100 meters.
