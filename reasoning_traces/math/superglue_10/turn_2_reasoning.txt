==================================================

To solve the problem effectively, let's first clarify what the question is asking. Unfortunately, the question "Sample reasoning question 10" is not specific enough for me to provide a detailed solution. However, I can guide you through a general approach to solving a math problem using logical reasoning. 

Let's assume that "Sample reasoning question 10" refers to a typical math problem that involves logical reasoning. Here's how we might approach solving such a problem:

### Step 1: Understand the Problem
- **Read the problem carefully**: Make sure you understand what is being asked. Identify the key pieces of information and what the problem is asking you to find.
- **Identify knowns and unknowns**: Determine what information is given and what you need to find.

### Step 2: Devise a Plan
- **Choose a strategy**: Depending on the type of problem, decide on a strategy to solve it. Common strategies include:
  - Drawing a diagram
  - Creating a table
  - Writing an equation
  - Logical reasoning
  - Working backwards

### Step 3: Carry Out the Plan
- **Execute your strategy**: Follow the steps of your chosen strategy carefully. Make sure to perform calculations accurately and keep track of your work.
- **Check each step**: As you work through the problem, verify that each step logically follows from the previous one.

### Step 4: Review/Check Your Work
- **Verify your solution**: Once you have a solution, check it against the problem to ensure it makes sense.
- **Consider alternative methods**: Think about whether there is another way to solve the problem that might be more efficient or insightful.

### Example Problem
Let's illustrate this process with a simple example problem:

**Problem**: A farmer has chickens and cows. There are 20 animals in total, and the animals have 56 legs altogether. How many chickens and how many cows are there?

#### Step 1: Understand the Problem
- Total animals = 20
- Total legs = 56
- Chickens have 2 legs, cows have 4 legs.

#### Step 2: Devise a Plan
- Let \( x \) be the number of chickens and \( y \) be the number of cows.
- We have two equations:
  1. \( x + y = 20 \) (total animals)
  2. \( 2x + 4y = 56 \) (total legs)

#### Step 3: Carry Out the Plan
- Solve the system of equations:
  1. From equation 1: \( y = 20 - x \)
  2. Substitute into equation 2: 
     \[
     2x + 4(20 - x) = 56
     \]
     \[
     2x + 80 - 4x = 56
     \]
     \[
     -2x + 80 = 56
     \]
     \[
     -2x = 56 - 80
     \]
     \[
     -2x = -24
     \]
     \[
     x = 12
     \]
  3. Substitute \( x = 12 \) back into equation 1:
     \[
     12 + y = 20
     \]
     \[
     y = 8
     \]

#### Step 4: Review/Check Your Work
- Check the solution:
  - Total animals: \( 12 + 8 = 20 \) ✔️
  - Total legs: \( 2(12) + 4(8) = 24 + 32 = 56 \) ✔️

### Final Answer
- There are 12 chickens and 8 cows.

This structured approach can be applied to a wide range of math problems, ensuring a thorough and logical solution process. If you have a specific problem or need further assistance, please provide more details!
