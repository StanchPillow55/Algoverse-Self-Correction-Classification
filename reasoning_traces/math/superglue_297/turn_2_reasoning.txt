==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 297" entails. Since the problem statement is not explicitly given, I'll assume it's a placeholder for a typical math problem. Let's create a hypothetical problem and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**
A car travels from City A to City B, a distance of 297 miles. The car travels at an average speed of 55 miles per hour. How long does it take for the car to reach City B?

**Step-by-step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We need to find the time it takes for the car to travel 297 miles at a speed of 55 miles per hour.

2. **Identify the Formula:**
   - The formula to calculate time when distance and speed are known is:
     \[
     \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}}
     \]

3. **Substitute the Known Values:**
   - Distance = 297 miles
   - Speed = 55 miles per hour
   - Substitute these values into the formula:
     \[
     \text{Time} = \frac{297 \text{ miles}}{55 \text{ miles per hour}}
     \]

4. **Perform the Calculation:**
   - Divide 297 by 55:
     \[
     \text{Time} = \frac{297}{55} \approx 5.4 \text{ hours}
     \]

5. **Interpret the Result:**
   - The car takes approximately 5.4 hours to travel from City A to City B.

6. **Convert Decimal to Minutes (if needed):**
   - The decimal 0.4 hours can be converted to minutes by multiplying by 60 (since 1 hour = 60 minutes):
     \[
     0.4 \times 60 = 24 \text{ minutes}
     \]

7. **Final Answer:**
   - The car takes approximately 5 hours and 24 minutes to reach City B.

Thus, the complete solution to the hypothetical problem is that the car takes approximately 5 hours and 24 minutes to travel from City A to City B at an average speed of 55 miles per hour.
