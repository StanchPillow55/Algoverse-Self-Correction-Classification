==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 297" refers to. Since the question is not specified, I'll assume it's a placeholder for a generic math problem. Let's create a sample math problem and solve it step by step.

**Sample Problem:**

A farmer has a rectangular field with a length that is twice its width. The perimeter of the field is 300 meters. What are the dimensions of the field?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We have a rectangular field.
   - Let the width of the field be \( w \) meters.
   - The length of the field is twice the width, so the length is \( 2w \) meters.
   - The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula:
     \[
     \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (\text{Length} + \text{Width})
     \]
   - We know the perimeter is 300 meters.

2. **Set Up the Equation:**
   - Substitute the known values into the perimeter formula:
     \[
     300 = 2 \times (2w + w)
     \]
   - Simplify the expression inside the parentheses:
     \[
     300 = 2 \times (3w)
     \]
   - Simplify further:
     \[
     300 = 6w
     \]

3. **Solve for \( w \):**
   - Divide both sides of the equation by 6 to solve for \( w \):
     \[
     w = \frac{300}{6}
     \]
   - Calculate the division:
     \[
     w = 50
     \]

4. **Find the Length:**
   - Since the length is twice the width, calculate the length:
     \[
     \text{Length} = 2w = 2 \times 50 = 100
     \]

5. **Verify the Solution:**
   - Check the perimeter with the calculated dimensions:
     \[
     \text{Perimeter} = 2 \times (100 + 50) = 2 \times 150 = 300
     \]
   - The calculated perimeter matches the given perimeter, confirming our solution is correct.

**Final Answer:**

The dimensions of the field are 50 meters in width and 100 meters in length.
