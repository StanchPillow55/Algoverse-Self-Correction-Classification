To solve the problem, we need to understand what "Sample reasoning question 297" refers to. Since this is not a standard math problem, I'll assume it's a placeholder for a specific math problem that involves reasoning. Let's create a hypothetical problem and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**

A company produces two types of widgets: Type A and Type B. The company can produce a maximum of 100 widgets per day. The profit from selling one Type A widget is $3, and the profit from selling one Type B widget is $5. The company wants to maximize its profit. However, due to a contract, the company must produce at least 20 Type A widgets per day. How many of each type of widget should the company produce to maximize profit?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( x \) be the number of Type A widgets produced per day.
   - Let \( y \) be the number of Type B widgets produced per day.

2. **Set Up Constraints:**
   - The total number of widgets produced per day cannot exceed 100:
     \[
     x + y \leq 100
     \]
   - The company must produce at least 20 Type A widgets per day:
     \[
     x \geq 20
     \]
   - The number of widgets cannot be negative:
     \[
     x \geq 0, \quad y \geq 0
     \]

3. **Objective Function:**
   - The profit function \( P \) is given by:
     \[
     P = 3x + 5y
     \]
   - We want to maximize \( P \).

4. **Graph the Constraints:**
   - Plot the line \( x + y = 100 \).
   - Shade the region below this line, as it represents \( x + y \leq 100 \).
   - Plot the vertical line \( x = 20 \).
   - The feasible region is bounded by \( x = 20 \), \( x + y = 100 \), \( x \geq 0 \), and \( y \geq 0 \).

5. **Find the Vertices of the Feasible Region:**
   - The vertices are points of intersection of the constraint lines:
     - Intersection of \( x = 20 \) and \( x + y = 100 \):
       \[
       20 + y = 100 \implies y = 80 \quad \Rightarrow \quad (20, 80)
       \]
     - Intersection of \( x = 20 \) and \( y = 0 \):
       \[
       (20, 0)
       \]
     - Intersection of \( x + y = 100 \) and \( y = 0 \):
       \[
       x = 100 \quad \Rightarrow \quad (100, 0)
       \]

6. **Evaluate the Objective Function at Each Vertex:**
   - At \( (20, 80) \):
     \[
     P = 3(20) + 5(80) = 60 + 400 = 460
     \]
   - At \( (20, 0) \):
     \[
     P = 3(20) + 5(0) = 60
     \]
   - At \( (100, 0) \):
     \[
     P = 3(100) + 5(0) = 300
     \]

7. **Determine the Maximum Profit:**
   - The maximum profit is \( 460 \), which occurs at the vertex \( (20, 80) \).

**Final Answer:**
To maximize profit, the company should produce 20 Type A widgets and 80 Type B widgets per day, resulting in a maximum profit of $460.
