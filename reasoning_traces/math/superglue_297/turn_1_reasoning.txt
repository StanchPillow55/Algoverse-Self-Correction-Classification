==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 297" refers to. Since the problem statement is not explicitly given, I'll assume this is a placeholder for a specific math problem. Without the actual content of "Sample reasoning question 297," I will demonstrate how to approach a generic math problem step by step.

Let's assume "Sample reasoning question 297" is a math problem involving solving a quadratic equation. Here's how we would approach it:

**Problem:** Solve the quadratic equation \( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \).

**Step 1: Identify the coefficients.**
- Let's assume the quadratic equation is \( 2x^2 + 3x - 5 = 0 \).
- Here, \( a = 2 \), \( b = 3 \), and \( c = -5 \).

**Step 2: Use the quadratic formula.**
- The quadratic formula is given by:
  \[
  x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
  \]

**Step 3: Calculate the discriminant.**
- The discriminant \( D \) is \( b^2 - 4ac \).
- Substitute the values of \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \):
  \[
  D = 3^2 - 4 \times 2 \times (-5) = 9 + 40 = 49
  \]

**Step 4: Determine the nature of the roots.**
- Since the discriminant \( D = 49 \) is positive, the quadratic equation has two distinct real roots.

**Step 5: Calculate the roots using the quadratic formula.**
- Substitute \( a = 2 \), \( b = 3 \), and \( D = 49 \) into the quadratic formula:
  \[
  x = \frac{-3 \pm \sqrt{49}}{4}
  \]
- Simplify the expression:
  \[
  x = \frac{-3 \pm 7}{4}
  \]

**Step 6: Solve for the two possible values of \( x \).**
- First root:
  \[
  x_1 = \frac{-3 + 7}{4} = \frac{4}{4} = 1
  \]
- Second root:
  \[
  x_2 = \frac{-3 - 7}{4} = \frac{-10}{4} = -2.5
  \]

**Final Answer:**
The solutions to the quadratic equation \( 2x^2 + 3x - 5 = 0 \) are \( x = 1 \) and \( x = -2.5 \).

This is a demonstration of how to solve a quadratic equation step by step. If "Sample reasoning question 297" refers to a different type of problem, please provide the specific details or context, and I can adjust the solution accordingly.
