==================================================

It seems like there is a misunderstanding or missing information in your request. "Sample math problem 335" does not provide enough details for me to solve a specific math problem. However, I can guide you through a generic math problem-solving process or help with a specific type of math problem if you provide more details.

To illustrate how I would solve a math problem, let's consider a sample problem:

**Sample Problem:**

Solve for \( x \) in the equation: \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We need to find the value of \( x \) that makes the equation true.

2. **Isolate the Variable:**
   - The equation is \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).
   - Our goal is to isolate \( x \) on one side of the equation.

3. **Subtract 3 from Both Sides:**
   - To remove the 3 from the left side, subtract 3 from both sides:
   \[
   2x + 3 - 3 = 11 - 3
   \]
   - Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   2x = 8
   \]

4. **Divide Both Sides by 2:**
   - To solve for \( x \), divide both sides by 2:
   \[
   \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{8}{2}
   \]
   - Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   x = 4
   \]

5. **Check the Solution:**
   - Substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation to verify:
   \[
   2(4) + 3 = 11
   \]
   - Simplifying the left side:
   \[
   8 + 3 = 11
   \]
   - Since both sides of the equation are equal, \( x = 4 \) is the correct solution.

**Final Answer:**

The solution to the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \) is \( x = 4 \).

If you have a specific problem or a different type of math problem in mind, please provide more details, and I'll be happy to help!
