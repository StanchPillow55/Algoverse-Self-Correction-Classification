Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 439," we first need to understand what the problem is asking. However, the problem statement "Sample math problem 439" is not specific and does not provide any details about what needs to be solved. Therefore, I will assume that this is a placeholder for a specific math problem, and I will create a sample math problem to solve.

Let's assume the problem is as follows:

**Problem:**
Solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 2x + 5 = 13 \).

**Step-by-step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Equation:**
   The equation given is a linear equation in one variable, \( x \). Our goal is to isolate \( x \) on one side of the equation to find its value.

2. **Subtract 5 from Both Sides:**
   To isolate the term with \( x \), we first need to eliminate the constant term on the left side of the equation. We do this by subtracting 5 from both sides of the equation:

   \[
   2x + 5 - 5 = 13 - 5
   \]

   Simplifying both sides gives:

   \[
   2x = 8
   \]

3. **Divide Both Sides by 2:**
   Now, we need to solve for \( x \) by getting rid of the coefficient of \( x \), which is 2. We do this by dividing both sides of the equation by 2:

   \[
   \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{8}{2}
   \]

   Simplifying both sides gives:

   \[
   x = 4
   \]

4. **Verify the Solution:**
   To ensure our solution is correct, we substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation:

   \[
   2(4) + 5 = 13
   \]

   Simplifying the left side gives:

   \[
   8 + 5 = 13
   \]

   Since both sides of the equation are equal, our solution is verified.

**Final Answer:**
The solution to the equation \( 2x + 5 = 13 \) is \( x = 4 \).
