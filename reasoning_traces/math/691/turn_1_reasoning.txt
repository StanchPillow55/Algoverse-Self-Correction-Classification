Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to calculate the total cost of the vet visit, which includes the cost of the vaccines and the heartworm check. Then, we will determine how much money John has left after paying the bill.

### Step 1: Calculate the cost of the vaccines
John's dog needs 2 vaccines, and each vaccine costs $20. 

\[
\text{Cost of vaccines} = \text{Number of vaccines} \times \text{Cost per vaccine}
\]
\[
\text{Cost of vaccines} = 2 \times 20 = 40
\]

### Step 2: Define the total bill
Let \( x \) be the total bill. According to the problem, the heartworm check is 60% of the total bill. Therefore, we can express the cost of the heartworm check as:

\[
\text{Cost of heartworm check} = 0.6x
\]

### Step 3: Set up the equation for the total bill
The total bill consists of the cost of the vaccines plus the cost of the heartworm check:

\[
x = \text{Cost of vaccines} + \text{Cost of heartworm check}
\]
Substituting the values we have:

\[
x = 40 + 0.6x
\]

### Step 4: Solve for \( x \)
To isolate \( x \), we can rearrange the equation:

\[
x - 0.6x = 40
\]
\[
0.4x = 40
\]

Now, divide both sides by 0.4:

\[
x = \frac{40}{0.4} = 100
\]

### Step 5: Calculate the cost of the heartworm check
Now that we have the total bill, we can find the cost of the heartworm check:

\[
\text{Cost of heartworm check} = 0.6x = 0.6 \times 100 = 60
\]

### Step 6: Verify the total bill
Now we can verify the total bill by adding the costs:

\[
\text{Total bill} = \text{Cost of vaccines} + \text{Cost of heartworm check} = 40 + 60 = 100
\]

### Step 7: Calculate how much money John has left
John brought $125 with him. To find out how much he has left after paying the bill, we subtract the total bill from the amount he brought:

\[
\text{Amount left} = \text{Amount brought} - \text{Total bill}
\]
\[
\text{Amount left} = 125 - 100 = 25
\]

### Final Answer
John leaves the vet with **$25**.
