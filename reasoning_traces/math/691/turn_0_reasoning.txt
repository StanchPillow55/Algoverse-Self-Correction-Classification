To solve the problem, we need to calculate the total cost of the vet visit, which includes the cost of the vaccines and the heartworm check. Then, we will determine how much money John has left after paying the bill.

1. **Calculate the cost of the vaccines:**
   - John needs 2 vaccines, and each vaccine costs $20.
   - Total cost of vaccines = Number of vaccines Ã— Cost per vaccine
   \[
   \text{Total cost of vaccines} = 2 \times 20 = 40 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Let \( x \) be the total bill.** 
   - According to the problem, the heartworm check costs 60% of the total bill.
   - Therefore, we can express the cost of the heartworm check as:
   \[
   \text{Cost of heartworm check} = 0.6x
   \]

3. **Set up the equation for the total bill:**
   - The total bill consists of the cost of the vaccines plus the cost of the heartworm check:
   \[
   x = \text{Cost of vaccines} + \text{Cost of heartworm check}
   \]
   Substituting the known values:
   \[
   x = 40 + 0.6x
   \]

4. **Solve for \( x \):**
   - Rearranging the equation:
   \[
   x - 0.6x = 40
   \]
   \[
   0.4x = 40
   \]
   - Now, divide both sides by 0.4 to find \( x \):
   \[
   x = \frac{40}{0.4} = 100 \text{ dollars}
   \]

5. **Calculate the amount John leaves with:**
   - John brought $125 with him. After paying the total bill of $100, the amount he leaves with is:
   \[
   \text{Amount left} = \text{Amount brought} - \text{Total bill}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Amount left} = 125 - 100 = 25 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Thus, after paying for the vet visit, John leaves with **$25**.

Final answer: **$25**
