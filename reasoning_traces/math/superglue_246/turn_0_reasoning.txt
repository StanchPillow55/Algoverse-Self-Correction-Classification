==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 246" entails. Since the problem statement is not specific, I'll assume it's a generic math problem that requires a step-by-step approach. Let's create a hypothetical math problem and solve it.

**Hypothetical Problem:**

"Calculate the sum of all even numbers between 1 and 100."

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Identify the Even Numbers:**
   - Even numbers are integers divisible by 2.
   - Between 1 and 100, the even numbers start from 2 and end at 100.

2. **List the Even Numbers:**
   - The sequence of even numbers is: 2, 4, 6, ..., 100.

3. **Determine the Number of Terms:**
   - This sequence is an arithmetic sequence where the first term \( a = 2 \) and the last term \( l = 100 \).
   - The common difference \( d = 2 \).
   - The formula for the \( n \)-th term of an arithmetic sequence is:
     \[
     a_n = a + (n-1) \cdot d
     \]
   - Set \( a_n = 100 \) to find \( n \):
     \[
     100 = 2 + (n-1) \cdot 2
     \]
     \[
     100 = 2 + 2n - 2
     \]
     \[
     100 = 2n
     \]
     \[
     n = 50
     \]
   - There are 50 even numbers between 1 and 100.

4. **Calculate the Sum of the Sequence:**
   - The sum \( S_n \) of an arithmetic sequence is given by:
     \[
     S_n = \frac{n}{2} \cdot (a + l)
     \]
   - Substitute the known values:
     \[
     S_{50} = \frac{50}{2} \cdot (2 + 100)
     \]
     \[
     S_{50} = 25 \cdot 102
     \]
     \[
     S_{50} = 2550
     \]

5. **Final Answer:**
   - The sum of all even numbers between 1 and 100 is 2550.

Therefore, the complete solution to the hypothetical problem is that the sum of all even numbers between 1 and 100 is 2550.
