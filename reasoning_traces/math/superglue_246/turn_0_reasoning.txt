==================================================

It seems like there might be some confusion with the question "Sample reasoning question 246." It doesn't provide specific details or numbers to work with. However, I can guide you through a general approach to solving a typical math problem by demonstrating a step-by-step process. Let's consider a sample math problem and solve it:

**Sample Problem:**

A store sells apples at $0.50 each and oranges at $0.75 each. If a customer buys a total of 10 fruits consisting of apples and oranges and spends $6.50, how many apples and how many oranges did the customer buy?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( a \) be the number of apples.
   - Let \( o \) be the number of oranges.

2. **Set Up Equations:**
   - From the problem, we know the total number of fruits is 10:
     \[
     a + o = 10
     \]
   - We also know the total cost is $6.50:
     \[
     0.50a + 0.75o = 6.50
     \]

3. **Solve the System of Equations:**

   We have the system:
   \[
   \begin{align*}
   a + o &= 10 \quad \text{(Equation 1)} \\
   0.50a + 0.75o &= 6.50 \quad \text{(Equation 2)}
   \end{align*}
   \]

   **Step 1: Solve Equation 1 for one variable:**
   \[
   a = 10 - o
   \]

   **Step 2: Substitute into Equation 2:**
   \[
   0.50(10 - o) + 0.75o = 6.50
   \]

   **Step 3: Distribute and simplify:**
   \[
   5 - 0.50o + 0.75o = 6.50
   \]

   \[
   5 + 0.25o = 6.50
   \]

   **Step 4: Solve for \( o \):**
   \[
   0.25o = 6.50 - 5
   \]

   \[
   0.25o = 1.50
   \]

   \[
   o = \frac{1.50}{0.25} = 6
   \]

   **Step 5: Substitute back to find \( a \):**
   \[
   a = 10 - o = 10 - 6 = 4
   \]

4. **Verify the Solution:**

   - Check the total number of fruits:
     \[
     a + o = 4 + 6 = 10
     \]
   - Check the total cost:
     \[
     0.50 \times 4 + 0.75 \times 6 = 2.00 + 4.50 = 6.50
     \]

Both conditions are satisfied, confirming our solution is correct.

**Final Answer:**

The customer bought 4 apples and 6 oranges.
