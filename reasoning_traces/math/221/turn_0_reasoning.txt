==================================================

To solve the problem, we will follow these steps:

1. **Determine the initial amount of water in the tank.**
   The problem states that the tank is filled with 120 liters of water.

2. **Calculate the amount of water left after Celine used some.**
   Celine used 90 liters of water from the tank. We can find the remaining water by subtracting the amount used from the initial amount:
   \[
   \text{Remaining water} = \text{Initial water} - \text{Water used} = 120 \text{ liters} - 90 \text{ liters} = 30 \text{ liters}
   \]

3. **Calculate the amount of rainwater collected.**
   The problem states that Celine was able to collect rainwater that is twice as much as what was left in the tank. Since there are 30 liters left, the amount of rainwater collected is:
   \[
   \text{Rainwater collected} = 2 \times \text{Remaining water} = 2 \times 30 \text{ liters} = 60 \text{ liters}
   \]

4. **Calculate the total amount of water in the tank now.**
   To find the total amount of water in the tank after collecting the rainwater, we add the remaining water to the rainwater collected:
   \[
   \text{Total water now} = \text{Remaining water} + \text{Rainwater collected} = 30 \text{ liters} + 60 \text{ liters} = 90 \text{ liters}
   \]

Thus, the final answer is that there are **90 liters of water in the tank now**.
