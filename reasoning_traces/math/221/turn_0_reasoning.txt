==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine how many miles Mira jogs in total over the course of five days, given her jogging speed and the time she jogs each day.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Determine Mira's daily jogging distance:**
   - Mira jogs at a speed of 5 miles per hour.
   - She jogs for 2 hours each morning.
   - To find out how many miles she jogs in one day, we use the formula for distance:
     \[
     \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time}
     \]
   - Plug in the values:
     \[
     \text{Distance per day} = 5 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 2 \, \text{hours} = 10 \, \text{miles}
     \]
   - Therefore, Mira jogs 10 miles each day.

2. **Calculate the total distance jogged over five days:**
   - Mira jogs 10 miles each day.
   - We need to find the total distance for five days:
     \[
     \text{Total distance for five days} = \text{Distance per day} \times \text{Number of days}
     \]
   - Plug in the values:
     \[
     \text{Total distance for five days} = 10 \, \text{miles/day} \times 5 \, \text{days} = 50 \, \text{miles}
     \]

### Final Answer:
Mira can jog a total of 50 miles over the course of five days.
