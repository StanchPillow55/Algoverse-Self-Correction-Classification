To solve the problem, we need to determine how many miles Mira jogs in total over five days, given her jogging speed and the duration of her jog each day.

1. **Identify the speed and time**:
   - Mira jogs at a speed of 5 miles per hour.
   - She jogs for 2 hours each morning.

2. **Calculate the distance jogged in one day**:
   The distance jogged can be calculated using the formula:
   \[
   \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time}
   \]
   Plugging in the values:
   \[
   \text{Distance} = 5 \text{ miles/hour} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 10 \text{ miles}
   \]
   So, Mira jogs 10 miles each morning.

3. **Calculate the total distance jogged over five days**:
   To find the total distance jogged over five days, we multiply the distance jogged in one day by the number of days:
   \[
   \text{Total Distance} = \text{Distance per day} \times \text{Number of days}
   \]
   Substituting the known values:
   \[
   \text{Total Distance} = 10 \text{ miles/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 50 \text{ miles}
   \]

4. **Final answer**:
   Therefore, the total distance Mira can jog over five days is:
   \[
   \boxed{50} \text{ miles}
   \]
