==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine how many miles Mira jogs in total over the course of five days, given her jogging speed and the duration of her jogs each day.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Determine Mira's daily jogging distance:**
   - Mira jogs at a speed of 5 miles per hour.
   - She jogs for 2 hours each morning.
   - To find out how many miles she jogs in one day, we use the formula for distance:
     \[
     \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time}
     \]
   - Plugging in the values:
     \[
     \text{Distance per day} = 5 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 2 \, \text{hours} = 10 \, \text{miles}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total distance jogged over five days:**
   - Mira jogs 10 miles each day.
   - We need to find out how many miles she jogs over five days.
   - Multiply the daily distance by the number of days:
     \[
     \text{Total distance over five days} = 10 \, \text{miles/day} \times 5 \, \text{days} = 50 \, \text{miles}
     \]

3. **Conclusion:**
   - Mira jogs a total of 50 miles over the course of five days.

Therefore, the final answer is that Mira can jog **50 miles** in five days.
