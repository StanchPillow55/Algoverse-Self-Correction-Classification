==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to calculate Tina's earnings for a week where she works 10 hours each day for 5 days, considering both regular and overtime pay.

### Step-by-Step Calculation:

1. **Determine Regular and Overtime Hours per Day:**
   - Tina works 10 hours each day.
   - Regular hours per day = 8 hours.
   - Overtime hours per day = Total hours - Regular hours = 10 - 8 = 2 hours.

2. **Calculate Regular Pay per Day:**
   - Regular hourly wage = $18.00.
   - Regular pay for 8 hours = 8 hours × $18.00/hour = $144.00.

3. **Calculate Overtime Pay per Hour:**
   - Overtime pay rate = Regular hourly wage + 1/2 of regular hourly wage.
   - Overtime pay rate = $18.00 + ($18.00 × 0.5) = $18.00 + $9.00 = $27.00.

4. **Calculate Overtime Pay per Day:**
   - Overtime pay for 2 hours = 2 hours × $27.00/hour = $54.00.

5. **Calculate Total Pay per Day:**
   - Total pay per day = Regular pay + Overtime pay = $144.00 + $54.00 = $198.00.

6. **Calculate Total Pay for 5 Days:**
   - Total pay for 5 days = 5 days × $198.00/day = $990.00.

### Final Answer:
Tina makes $990.00 for working 10 hours every day for 5 days.
