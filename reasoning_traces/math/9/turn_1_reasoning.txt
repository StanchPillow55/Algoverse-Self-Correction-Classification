Question ID: 9
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To calculate Eliza's earnings for the week, we need to break down her work hours into regular hours and overtime hours.

1. **Identify Regular and Overtime Hours:**
   - Eliza's regular hours: 40 hours
   - Total hours worked: 45 hours
   - Overtime hours: Total hours - Regular hours = 45 hours - 40 hours = 5 hours

2. **Calculate Regular Pay:**
   - Regular hourly rate: $10
   - Regular pay for 40 hours: 
     \[
     \text{Regular Pay} = \text{Regular Hours} \times \text{Regular Rate} = 40 \text{ hours} \times 10 \text{ dollars/hour} = 400 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Calculate Overtime Pay:**
   - Overtime rate: 1.2 times the regular hourly rate
   - Overtime hourly rate: 
     \[
     \text{Overtime Rate} = 1.2 \times 10 \text{ dollars/hour} = 12 \text{ dollars/hour}
     \]
   - Overtime pay for 5 hours:
     \[
     \text{Overtime Pay} = \text{Overtime Hours} \times \text{Overtime Rate} = 5 \text{ hours} \times 12 \text{ dollars/hour} = 60 \text{ dollars}
     \]

4. **Calculate Total Earnings:**
   - Total earnings = Regular pay + Overtime pay
   \[
   \text{Total Earnings} = 400 \text{ dollars} + 60 \text{ dollars} = 460 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Thus, Eliza's earnings for this week are **$460**.
