Question ID: 9
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to calculate Tina's earnings based on her regular and overtime hours. Here's the step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Determine Regular and Overtime Hours:**
   - Tina works 10 hours each day.
   - Regular hours per day are 8 hours.
   - Overtime hours per day are the total hours worked minus regular hours: \(10 - 8 = 2\) hours of overtime per day.

2. **Calculate Regular Pay:**
   - Tina's regular hourly wage is $18.00.
   - Regular pay per day for 8 hours is: 
     \[
     8 \text{ hours} \times \$18.00/\text{hour} = \$144.00
     \]

3. **Calculate Overtime Pay:**
   - Overtime pay rate is 1.5 times the regular hourly wage.
   - Overtime pay rate is: 
     \[
     \$18.00 + \frac{1}{2} \times \$18.00 = \$18.00 + \$9.00 = \$27.00/\text{hour}
     \]
   - Overtime pay per day for 2 hours is:
     \[
     2 \text{ hours} \times \$27.00/\text{hour} = \$54.00
     \]

4. **Calculate Total Pay Per Day:**
   - Total pay per day is the sum of regular pay and overtime pay:
     \[
     \$144.00 + \$54.00 = \$198.00
     \]

5. **Calculate Total Pay for 5 Days:**
   - Tina works 5 days, so her total earnings for the week are:
     \[
     5 \text{ days} \times \$198.00/\text{day} = \$990.00
     \]

Therefore, Tina makes a total of \$990.00 for working 10 hours every day for 5 days. 

**Final Answer:** \$990.00
