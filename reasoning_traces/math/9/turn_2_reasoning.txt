Question ID: 9
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To calculate Eliza's earnings for the week, we need to break down her regular hours and overtime hours, then calculate her pay accordingly.

1. **Identify Regular and Overtime Hours**:
   - Eliza works a total of 45 hours this week.
   - The first 40 hours are considered regular hours.
   - The hours beyond 40 are considered overtime hours.
   - Therefore, her regular hours = 40 hours and her overtime hours = 45 - 40 = 5 hours.

2. **Calculate Regular Pay**:
   - Eliza's regular hourly rate is $10.
   - For 40 regular hours, her earnings are:
     \[
     \text{Regular Pay} = \text{Regular Hours} \times \text{Regular Rate} = 40 \, \text{hours} \times 10 \, \text{dollars/hour} = 400 \, \text{dollars}
     \]

3. **Calculate Overtime Pay**:
   - Eliza's overtime pay rate is 1.2 times her regular hourly rate.
   - Overtime rate = \( 1.2 \times 10 \, \text{dollars/hour} = 12 \, \text{dollars/hour} \).
   - For 5 overtime hours, her earnings are:
     \[
     \text{Overtime Pay} = \text{Overtime Hours} \times \text{Overtime Rate} = 5 \, \text{hours} \times 12 \, \text{dollars/hour} = 60 \, \text{dollars}
     \]

4. **Calculate Total Earnings**:
   - Total earnings for the week = Regular Pay + Overtime Pay:
     \[
     \text{Total Earnings} = 400 \, \text{dollars} + 60 \, \text{dollars} = 460 \, \text{dollars}
     \]

Thus, Eliza's total earnings for this week are **$460**.
