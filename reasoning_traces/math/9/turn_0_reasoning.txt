To determine how much money Tina makes in a week, we need to calculate her earnings based on her hourly wage, regular hours, and overtime hours.

1. **Identify Tina's hourly wage**: 
   - Tina makes $18.00 per hour.

2. **Determine the number of hours she works in a week**: 
   - Tina works 10 hours each day for 5 days.
   - Total hours worked = 10 hours/day × 5 days = 50 hours.

3. **Identify regular and overtime hours**: 
   - Regular hours are the first 8 hours of each day.
   - Overtime hours are any hours worked beyond 8 hours in a day.
   - Since Tina works 10 hours each day, she works 2 hours of overtime each day.
   - Total regular hours in a week = 8 hours/day × 5 days = 40 hours.
   - Total overtime hours in a week = 2 hours/day × 5 days = 10 hours.

4. **Calculate regular pay**: 
   - Regular pay = Regular hours × Hourly wage
   - Regular pay = 40 hours × $18.00/hour = $720.00.

5. **Calculate overtime pay**: 
   - Overtime pay is calculated at a rate of hourly wage + 1/2 hourly wage.
   - Overtime rate = $18.00 + ($18.00 / 2) = $18.00 + $9.00 = $27.00/hour.
   - Overtime pay = Overtime hours × Overtime rate
   - Overtime pay = 10 hours × $27.00/hour = $270.00.

6. **Calculate total earnings for the week**: 
   - Total earnings = Regular pay + Overtime pay
   - Total earnings = $720.00 + $270.00 = $990.00.

Thus, Tina makes a total of **$990.00** for the week. 

Final answer: **$990.00**.
