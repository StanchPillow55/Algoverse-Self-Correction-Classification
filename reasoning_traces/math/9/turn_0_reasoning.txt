To calculate Eliza's earnings for the week, we need to break down her work hours into regular hours and overtime hours, and then apply the appropriate rates for each.

1. **Identify Regular and Overtime Hours:**
   - Eliza's regular hours are the first 40 hours she works each week.
   - Any hours worked beyond 40 hours are considered overtime.
   - In this case, Eliza worked a total of 45 hours.

   Therefore:
   - Regular hours = 40 hours
   - Overtime hours = Total hours worked - Regular hours
   - Overtime hours = 45 hours - 40 hours = 5 hours

2. **Calculate Regular Earnings:**
   - Eliza's regular hourly rate is $10.
   - To find her earnings from regular hours, we multiply her regular hours by her hourly rate:
   \[
   \text{Regular Earnings} = \text{Regular Hours} \times \text{Hourly Rate}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Regular Earnings} = 40 \, \text{hours} \times 10 \, \text{dollars/hour} = 400 \, \text{dollars}
   \]

3. **Calculate Overtime Earnings:**
   - Eliza's overtime pay is 1.2 times her regular hourly rate.
   - First, we calculate her overtime rate:
   \[
   \text{Overtime Rate} = 1.2 \times \text{Regular Hourly Rate} = 1.2 \times 10 \, \text{dollars/hour} = 12 \, \text{dollars/hour}
   \]
   - Now, we calculate her earnings from overtime hours:
   \[
   \text{Overtime Earnings} = \text{Overtime Hours} \times \text{Overtime Rate}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Overtime Earnings} = 5 \, \text{hours} \times 12 \, \text{dollars/hour} = 60 \, \text{dollars}
   \]

4. **Calculate Total Earnings:**
   - Finally, we add her regular earnings and overtime earnings to find her total earnings for the week:
   \[
   \text{Total Earnings} = \text{Regular Earnings} + \text{Overtime Earnings}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total Earnings} = 400 \, \text{dollars} + 60 \, \text{dollars} = 460 \, \text{dollars}
   \]

Thus, Eliza's total earnings for the week are **$460**.
