==================================================

To solve the problem effectively, let's first understand what is being asked. The problem is labeled as "Sample reasoning question 411," but without specific details or numbers, it's not clear what the exact mathematical problem is. However, I will demonstrate a general approach to solving a typical math problem by reasoning through a hypothetical example.

Let's assume the problem is as follows:

**Problem:** A store sells apples at $2 each and oranges at $3 each. If a customer buys a total of 10 fruits consisting of apples and oranges and spends a total of $25, how many apples and how many oranges did the customer buy?

**Step-by-step Solution:**

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( x \) be the number of apples.
   - Let \( y \) be the number of oranges.

2. **Set Up Equations:**
   - From the problem, we know the total number of fruits is 10:
     \[
     x + y = 10
     \]
   - We also know the total cost is $25:
     \[
     2x + 3y = 25
     \]

3. **Solve the System of Equations:**
   - We have two equations:
     1. \( x + y = 10 \)
     2. \( 2x + 3y = 25 \)

   - Solve the first equation for one variable, say \( x \):
     \[
     x = 10 - y
     \]

   - Substitute \( x = 10 - y \) into the second equation:
     \[
     2(10 - y) + 3y = 25
     \]

   - Simplify and solve for \( y \):
     \[
     20 - 2y + 3y = 25
     \]
     \[
     20 + y = 25
     \]
     \[
     y = 5
     \]

   - Substitute \( y = 5 \) back into the equation \( x = 10 - y \):
     \[
     x = 10 - 5 = 5
     \]

4. **Verify the Solution:**
   - Check the total number of fruits:
     \[
     x + y = 5 + 5 = 10
     \]
   - Check the total cost:
     \[
     2x + 3y = 2(5) + 3(5) = 10 + 15 = 25
     \]

Both conditions are satisfied, confirming our solution is correct.

**Final Answer:**
The customer bought 5 apples and 5 oranges.
