==================================================

To solve the problem, I need more information about "Sample reasoning question 411." Since the problem statement is not provided, I will demonstrate how to approach a typical math problem by solving an example problem. If you have a specific problem in mind, please provide the details.

Example Problem:
A train travels from City A to City B, a distance of 300 miles, at a speed of 60 miles per hour. How long does the journey take?

Step-by-step Solution:

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   We need to find out how long it takes for the train to travel from City A to City B. We know the distance between the cities is 300 miles, and the train travels at a constant speed of 60 miles per hour.

2. **Identify the Formula:**
   To find the time taken for a journey, we can use the formula:
   \[
   \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}}
   \]

3. **Substitute the Known Values:**
   We have the distance as 300 miles and the speed as 60 miles per hour. Substituting these values into the formula gives:
   \[
   \text{Time} = \frac{300 \text{ miles}}{60 \text{ miles per hour}}
   \]

4. **Perform the Calculation:**
   Divide 300 by 60 to find the time:
   \[
   \text{Time} = 5 \text{ hours}
   \]

5. **Verify the Calculation:**
   To ensure the calculation is correct, consider the units. The distance is in miles, and the speed is in miles per hour. Dividing miles by miles per hour results in hours, which is the correct unit for time.

6. **State the Final Answer:**
   The journey from City A to City B takes 5 hours.

If you have a specific problem or need further assistance, please provide the details, and I will be happy to help!
