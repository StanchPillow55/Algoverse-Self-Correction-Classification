==================================================

To solve this problem, I need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 411" refers to. Since this is a generic placeholder and doesn't provide specific details about the problem, I'll approach this by creating a hypothetical math problem and solving it step by step. 

Let's assume "Sample reasoning question 411" is a math problem involving basic algebra. Here's a hypothetical problem:

**Problem:**
Solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).

**Step-by-step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Equation:**
   The given equation is \( 2x + 3 = 11 \). This is a linear equation in one variable, \( x \).

2. **Isolate the Variable:**
   To solve for \( x \), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We start by eliminating the constant term on the left side.

   \[
   2x + 3 = 11
   \]

   Subtract 3 from both sides to get:

   \[
   2x + 3 - 3 = 11 - 3
   \]

   Simplifying both sides gives:

   \[
   2x = 8
   \]

3. **Solve for \( x \):**
   Now, divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( x \).

   \[
   \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{8}{2}
   \]

   Simplifying both sides gives:

   \[
   x = 4
   \]

4. **Verify the Solution:**
   Substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation to verify:

   \[
   2(4) + 3 = 11
   \]

   Simplifying the left side:

   \[
   8 + 3 = 11
   \]

   Since both sides of the equation are equal, our solution \( x = 4 \) is correct.

**Final Answer:**
The solution to the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \) is \( x = 4 \).

This completes the problem-solving process for this hypothetical question. If "Sample reasoning question 411" refers to a different problem, please provide additional details or context so I can assist you more accurately.
