==================================================

Certainly! Let's tackle the problem step by step. However, it seems like "Sample math problem 413" is a placeholder or an incomplete reference to a specific math problem. Without additional context or details, I can't provide a specific solution. 

To proceed, let's assume a generic math problem and solve it. If you have a specific problem in mind, please provide the details. For now, I'll create a sample problem and solve it:

**Sample Math Problem:**

Solve for \( x \) in the equation:
\[ 2x + 3 = 11 \]

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Equation:**
   The equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \) is a linear equation in one variable, \( x \).

2. **Isolate the Variable:**
   To solve for \( x \), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We start by eliminating the constant term on the left side.

3. **Subtract 3 from Both Sides:**
   \[
   2x + 3 - 3 = 11 - 3
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   2x = 8
   \]

4. **Divide by the Coefficient of \( x \):**
   To solve for \( x \), divide both sides by 2:
   \[
   \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{8}{2}
   \]
   Simplifying gives:
   \[
   x = 4
   \]

5. **Verify the Solution:**
   Substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies the equation:
   \[
   2(4) + 3 = 11
   \]
   Simplifying the left side:
   \[
   8 + 3 = 11
   \]
   Since both sides are equal, the solution \( x = 4 \) is correct.

**Final Answer:**
\[ x = 4 \]

If you have a specific problem or need assistance with a different type of math problem, please provide the details, and I'll be happy to help!
