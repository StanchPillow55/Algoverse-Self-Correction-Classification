Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 492," we need to first understand what the problem entails. However, since "Sample math problem 492" is not a specific problem statement, I'll create a hypothetical math problem labeled as "492" and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem 492:**

"Calculate the sum of the first 20 positive even numbers."

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Identify the Sequence:**
   - The sequence of the first 20 positive even numbers is: 2, 4, 6, 8, ..., 40.

2. **Recognize the Pattern:**
   - This sequence is an arithmetic sequence where the first term \( a_1 = 2 \) and the common difference \( d = 2 \).

3. **Find the Last Term:**
   - The last term \( a_{20} \) can be found using the formula for the \( n \)-th term of an arithmetic sequence:
     \[
     a_n = a_1 + (n-1) \cdot d
     \]
   - For the 20th term:
     \[
     a_{20} = 2 + (20-1) \cdot 2 = 2 + 38 = 40
     \]

4. **Sum of an Arithmetic Sequence:**
   - The sum \( S_n \) of the first \( n \) terms of an arithmetic sequence is given by:
     \[
     S_n = \frac{n}{2} \cdot (a_1 + a_n)
     \]
   - Substitute the known values:
     \[
     S_{20} = \frac{20}{2} \cdot (2 + 40) = 10 \cdot 42 = 420
     \]

5. **Final Answer:**
   - The sum of the first 20 positive even numbers is \( \boxed{420} \).

This solution involves identifying the sequence, recognizing it as an arithmetic sequence, and using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic sequence to find the answer.
