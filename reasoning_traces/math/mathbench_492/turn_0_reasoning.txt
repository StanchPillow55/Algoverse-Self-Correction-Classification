==================================================

To solve "Sample math problem 492," we first need to understand what the problem entails. Since the problem statement is not provided, I'll create a hypothetical math problem labeled as "492" and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem 492:**

"Calculate the value of \( x \) in the equation \( 3x + 5 = 20 \)."

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Equation:**
   The equation given is \( 3x + 5 = 20 \). This is a linear equation in one variable, \( x \).

2. **Isolate the Variable:**
   To find the value of \( x \), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We start by eliminating the constant term on the left side.

   \[
   3x + 5 = 20
   \]

   Subtract 5 from both sides to remove the constant term from the left side:

   \[
   3x + 5 - 5 = 20 - 5
   \]

   Simplifying both sides gives:

   \[
   3x = 15
   \]

3. **Solve for \( x \):**
   Now, divide both sides by 3 to solve for \( x \):

   \[
   \frac{3x}{3} = \frac{15}{3}
   \]

   Simplifying both sides results in:

   \[
   x = 5
   \]

4. **Verify the Solution:**
   To ensure our solution is correct, substitute \( x = 5 \) back into the original equation:

   \[
   3(5) + 5 = 20
   \]

   Calculate the left side:

   \[
   15 + 5 = 20
   \]

   Since both sides of the equation are equal, our solution is verified.

**Final Answer:**

The value of \( x \) is \( 5 \).
