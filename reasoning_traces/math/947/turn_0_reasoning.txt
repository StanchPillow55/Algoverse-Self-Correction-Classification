==================================================

To find out how many stickers Jasmine has at the end, we will follow these steps:

1. **Start with the initial number of stickers**: Jasmine begins with 15 stickers for participating in class.

   \[
   \text{Initial stickers} = 15
   \]

2. **Subtract the stickers she lost**: During playtime, Jasmine lost 7 stickers. We need to subtract this number from her initial stickers.

   \[
   \text{Stickers after losing some} = 15 - 7
   \]

   Performing the subtraction:

   \[
   15 - 7 = 8
   \]

   So, after losing 7 stickers, Jasmine has 8 stickers.

3. **Add the stickers she received for helping classmates**: Jasmine received an additional 5 stickers for helping her classmates. We will add this to the number of stickers she currently has.

   \[
   \text{Final stickers} = 8 + 5
   \]

   Performing the addition:

   \[
   8 + 5 = 13
   \]

4. **Conclusion**: After all the calculations, we find that Jasmine has a total of 13 stickers at the end.

Thus, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{13}
\]
