Question ID: 1244
Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To determine how many questions Audrey needs to answer correctly on her second test to pass to the 7th grade, we will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of questions across both tests.**
   - The first test has 70 questions.
   - The second test has 40 questions.
   - Total questions = 70 + 40 = 110 questions.

2. **Determine how many questions Audrey needs to answer correctly to pass.**
   - Audrey needs to correctly answer 70% of the total questions.
   - To find 70% of 110 questions, we calculate:
     \[
     0.70 \times 110 = 77 \text{ questions}
     \]
   - Therefore, Audrey needs to answer at least 77 questions correctly in total to pass.

3. **Calculate how many questions Audrey got correct on the first test.**
   - She answered 60% of the 70 questions correctly.
   - To find out how many questions that is, we calculate:
     \[
     0.60 \times 70 = 42 \text{ questions}
     \]
   - So, Audrey got 42 questions correct on the first test.

4. **Determine how many questions she needs to get correct on the second test.**
   - Let \( x \) be the number of questions Audrey needs to get correct on the second test.
   - The total number of correct answers she needs is 77, and she already has 42 correct from the first test. Thus, we set up the equation:
     \[
     42 + x = 77
     \]
   - To find \( x \), we solve the equation:
     \[
     x = 77 - 42 = 35
     \]

5. **Conclusion:**
   - Audrey needs to answer **35 questions correctly** on the second test to move on to the 7th grade.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{35}
\]
