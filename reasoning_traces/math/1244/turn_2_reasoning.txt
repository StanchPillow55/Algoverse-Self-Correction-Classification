Question ID: 1244
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To determine how many questions Audrey needs to answer correctly on her second test to pass to 7th grade, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of questions across both tests:**
   - First test: 70 questions
   - Second test: 40 questions
   - Total questions = 70 + 40 = 110 questions

2. **Determine the number of correct answers needed to pass:**
   - Audrey needs to correctly answer 70% of the total questions.
   - Required correct answers = 70% of 110
   - Calculation: 
     \[
     0.70 \times 110 = 77 \text{ correct answers}
     \]

3. **Calculate how many questions Audrey got correct on the first test:**
   - She answered 60% of the first test correctly.
   - Correct answers on the first test = 60% of 70
   - Calculation:
     \[
     0.60 \times 70 = 42 \text{ correct answers}
     \]

4. **Determine how many more correct answers she needs from the second test:**
   - Total correct answers needed = 77
   - Correct answers she already has = 42
   - Correct answers needed from the second test = 77 - 42
   - Calculation:
     \[
     77 - 42 = 35 \text{ correct answers needed}
     \]

5. **Conclusion:**
   - Audrey needs to answer **35 questions correctly** on the second test to pass to 7th grade.

Final answer: **35**
