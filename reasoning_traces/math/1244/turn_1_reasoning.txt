Question ID: 1244
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To determine how many questions Audrey needs to get right on her second test to pass to 7th grade, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of questions across both tests:**
   - First test: 70 questions
   - Second test: 40 questions
   - Total questions = 70 + 40 = 110 questions

2. **Determine the number of questions Audrey needs to answer correctly to pass:**
   - Audrey needs to correctly answer 70% of the total questions.
   - 70% of 110 questions = 0.70 × 110 = 77 questions

3. **Calculate how many questions Audrey got correct on the first test:**
   - She answered 60% of the first test correctly.
   - Correct answers on the first test = 60% of 70 = 0.60 × 70 = 42 questions

4. **Determine how many questions she needs to get right on the second test:**
   - Let \( x \) be the number of questions she needs to get right on the second test.
   - The total correct answers needed to pass is 77.
   - Therefore, the equation is:
     \[
     42 + x = 77
     \]
   - Solving for \( x \):
     \[
     x = 77 - 42 = 35
     \]

5. **Conclusion:**
   - Audrey needs to get **35 questions** correct on the second test to move on to the 7th grade.

Final answer: **35 questions**.
