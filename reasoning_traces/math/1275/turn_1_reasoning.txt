==================================================

To find the force needed to push John's car, we first need to calculate the total weight of the car, luggage, and children. Then, we will determine what 1% of that total weight is, as that is the force required to move the car.

### Step 1: Calculate the total weight

1. **Weight of the car**: 1200 pounds
2. **Weight of the luggage**: 250 pounds
3. **Weight of the children**: 75 pounds each, and there are 2 children.

First, we calculate the total weight of the children:
\[
\text{Weight of children} = 75 \text{ pounds} \times 2 = 150 \text{ pounds}
\]

Now, we can find the total weight by adding the weight of the car, luggage, and children:
\[
\text{Total weight} = \text{Weight of car} + \text{Weight of luggage} + \text{Weight of children}
\]
\[
\text{Total weight} = 1200 \text{ pounds} + 250 \text{ pounds} + 150 \text{ pounds}
\]
\[
\text{Total weight} = 1200 + 250 + 150 = 1600 \text{ pounds}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the force needed to move the car

The problem states that the force required to move the car is 1% of the total weight. We can calculate this as follows:
\[
\text{Force} = 1\% \text{ of Total weight} = 0.01 \times \text{Total weight}
\]
Substituting the total weight we calculated:
\[
\text{Force} = 0.01 \times 1600 \text{ pounds}
\]
\[
\text{Force} = 16 \text{ pounds}
\]

### Final Answer
The force needed to push the car is **16 pounds**.
