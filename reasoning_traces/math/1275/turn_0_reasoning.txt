==================================================

To determine how much force John needs to push his car, we first need to calculate the total weight of the car, luggage, and children. Then, we will find 1% of that total weight, as the problem states that the force required to move the car is 1% of its total weight.

### Step 1: Calculate the total weight

1. **Weight of the car**: 1200 pounds
2. **Weight of the luggage**: 250 pounds
3. **Weight of the two children**: Each child weighs 75 pounds, so for two children:
   \[
   2 \times 75 = 150 \text{ pounds}
   \]

Now, we can add these weights together to find the total weight:
\[
\text{Total weight} = \text{Weight of the car} + \text{Weight of the luggage} + \text{Weight of the children}
\]
\[
\text{Total weight} = 1200 + 250 + 150
\]
\[
\text{Total weight} = 1200 + 250 = 1450
\]
\[
\text{Total weight} = 1450 + 150 = 1600 \text{ pounds}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate 1% of the total weight

Next, we need to find 1% of the total weight:
\[
\text{Force needed} = 1\% \text{ of Total weight}
\]
To calculate 1%, we can multiply the total weight by 0.01:
\[
\text{Force needed} = 0.01 \times 1600
\]
\[
\text{Force needed} = 16 \text{ pounds}
\]

### Final Answer

Thus, the force John needs to push the car is:
\[
\boxed{16} \text{ pounds}
\]
