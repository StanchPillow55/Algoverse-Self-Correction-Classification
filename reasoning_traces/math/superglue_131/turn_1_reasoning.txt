==================================================

To solve the problem effectively, let's first clarify what "Sample reasoning question 131" entails. Since the problem statement is not explicitly provided, I'll demonstrate a general approach to solving a typical math reasoning problem. I'll assume it's a numerical or algebraic problem, as these are common in reasoning tests.

### Step-by-Step Approach:

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - Without a specific problem, let's assume a typical algebraic reasoning problem: "Solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \)."

2. **Identify What is Given:**
   - We have the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).

3. **Identify What is Required:**
   - We need to find the value of \( x \).

4. **Plan a Solution:**
   - To isolate \( x \), we need to perform operations that will leave \( x \) on one side of the equation.

5. **Execute the Plan:**
   - **Step 1:** Subtract 3 from both sides to eliminate the constant term on the left side.
     \[
     2x + 3 - 3 = 11 - 3
     \]
     \[
     2x = 8
     \]

   - **Step 2:** Divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( x \).
     \[
     \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{8}{2}
     \]
     \[
     x = 4
     \]

6. **Verify the Solution:**
   - Substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies the equation.
     \[
     2(4) + 3 = 11
     \]
     \[
     8 + 3 = 11
     \]
   - The left side equals the right side, confirming that \( x = 4 \) is correct.

7. **State the Final Answer:**
   - The solution to the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \) is \( x = 4 \).

This step-by-step approach can be adapted to various types of reasoning problems by adjusting the operations and logic according to the specific problem details. If you have a specific "Sample reasoning question 131," please provide the details, and I can tailor the solution accordingly.
