==================================================

To solve a math problem effectively, it's important to follow a structured approach. However, the problem statement you've provided, "Sample reasoning question 131," is not specific enough for me to determine the exact nature of the problem. Typically, a math problem would include specific details or numbers to work with.

Since the problem is not clearly defined, I'll outline a general approach to solving math problems, which you can apply to any specific problem you encounter:

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - Read the problem carefully.
   - Identify what is being asked.
   - Determine what information is given and what needs to be found.

2. **Devise a Plan:**
   - Consider possible strategies to solve the problem. This could include:
     - Drawing a diagram.
     - Writing an equation.
     - Breaking the problem into smaller parts.
     - Looking for patterns.
     - Using logical reasoning.

3. **Carry Out the Plan:**
   - Execute the steps youâ€™ve planned.
   - Perform calculations carefully.
   - Keep track of units and ensure consistency.

4. **Check Your Work:**
   - Review each step to ensure accuracy.
   - Verify that the solution makes sense in the context of the problem.
   - Double-check calculations and logic.

5. **State the Final Answer:**
   - Clearly write down the final answer.
   - Include units if applicable.

If you have a specific math problem in mind, please provide the details, and I will be happy to work through it step by step.
