==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 131" refers to. Since the problem statement is not clear or specific, I will assume it is a placeholder for a typical math problem. Let's create a hypothetical problem and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**

A train travels from City A to City B, a distance of 300 miles. The train travels at a constant speed of 60 miles per hour. How long does it take for the train to reach City B from City A?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Identify the Given Information:**
   - Distance from City A to City B = 300 miles
   - Speed of the train = 60 miles per hour

2. **Determine What We Need to Find:**
   - We need to find the time it takes for the train to travel from City A to City B.

3. **Use the Formula for Time:**
   The formula to calculate time when distance and speed are known is:
   \[
   \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}}
   \]

4. **Substitute the Given Values into the Formula:**
   \[
   \text{Time} = \frac{300 \text{ miles}}{60 \text{ miles per hour}}
   \]

5. **Perform the Calculation:**
   \[
   \text{Time} = \frac{300}{60} = 5 \text{ hours}
   \]

6. **Interpret the Result:**
   The train takes 5 hours to travel from City A to City B at a constant speed of 60 miles per hour.

**Final Answer:**
The train takes 5 hours to reach City B from City A.
