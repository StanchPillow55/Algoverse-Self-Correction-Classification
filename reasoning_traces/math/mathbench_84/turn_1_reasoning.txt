Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the sample math problem 84, we need to first understand what the problem is asking. However, since "Sample math problem 84" is not a specific problem statement, I'll create a hypothetical math problem labeled as "Sample math problem 84" and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem Statement:**

"Sample math problem 84: If 3 times a number is decreased by 7, the result is 20. What is the number?"

**Step-by-step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We need to find a number such that when it is multiplied by 3 and then decreased by 7, the result is 20.

2. **Translate the Problem into an Equation:**
   - Let the unknown number be \( x \).
   - According to the problem, 3 times the number decreased by 7 equals 20. This can be written as:
     \[
     3x - 7 = 20
     \]

3. **Solve the Equation:**
   - To find \( x \), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation.
   - Start by adding 7 to both sides to eliminate the -7 on the left side:
     \[
     3x - 7 + 7 = 20 + 7
     \]
     \[
     3x = 27
     \]

   - Next, divide both sides by 3 to solve for \( x \):
     \[
     \frac{3x}{3} = \frac{27}{3}
     \]
     \[
     x = 9
     \]

4. **Verify the Solution:**
   - Substitute \( x = 9 \) back into the original condition to ensure it satisfies the problem:
     \[
     3(9) - 7 = 27 - 7 = 20
     \]
   - The left side equals 20, which matches the right side of the equation, confirming that our solution is correct.

5. **State the Final Answer:**
   - The number is \( \boxed{9} \).

This completes the solution to the hypothetical "Sample math problem 84." If you have a specific problem labeled as "Sample math problem 84," please provide the details, and I will solve it accordingly.
