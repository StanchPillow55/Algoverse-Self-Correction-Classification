Question ID: 26
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to understand that 20% of the seawater is salt. This means that 20% of the 2 liters of seawater Jack collected is salt.

We can calculate the amount of salt in the seawater by multiplying the total volume of the seawater by the percentage of salt. 

The calculation is as follows:

2 liters * 20% = 0.4 liters

However, the question asks for the answer in milliliters, not liters. We know that 1 liter is equal to 1000 milliliters, so we can convert the volume of salt from liters to milliliters by multiplying by 1000.

The calculation is as follows:

0.4 liters * 1000 = 400 milliliters

So, when all the water evaporates, Jack will get 400 milliliters of salt.
