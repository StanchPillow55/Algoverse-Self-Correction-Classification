==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine how much salt is present in the 2 liters of seawater that Jack collects. We know that the seawater is 20% salt. Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - Jack collects 2 liters of seawater.
   - The seawater is 20% salt.
   - We need to find out how many milliliters (ml) of salt Jack will have when all the water evaporates.

2. **Convert Liters to Milliliters:**
   - Since 1 liter is equal to 1000 milliliters, 2 liters is equal to:
     \[
     2 \, \text{liters} \times 1000 \, \text{ml/liter} = 2000 \, \text{ml}
     \]

3. **Calculate the Amount of Salt:**
   - The seawater is 20% salt, which means that 20% of the total volume of the seawater is salt.
   - To find the volume of salt in milliliters, we calculate 20% of 2000 ml:
     \[
     \text{Salt volume} = 0.20 \times 2000 \, \text{ml} = 400 \, \text{ml}
     \]

4. **Conclusion:**
   - When all the water evaporates, Jack will be left with 400 ml of salt.

Therefore, the final answer is that Jack will get 400 ml of salt when all the water evaporates.
