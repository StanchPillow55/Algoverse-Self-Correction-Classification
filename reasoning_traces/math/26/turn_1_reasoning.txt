==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to find out how much salt is in 2 liters of seawater. Given that the seawater is 20% salt, we can calculate the amount of salt by taking 20% of the total volume of the seawater.

First, we need to convert the volume of seawater from liters to milliliters because the final answer needs to be in milliliters. We know that 1 liter is equal to 1000 milliliters, so 2 liters is equal to 2000 milliliters.

Next, we calculate 20% of 2000 milliliters. We can do this by multiplying 2000 by 20% (or 0.20 in decimal form).

2000 ml * 0.20 = 400 ml

So, Jack will get 400 ml of salt when all the water evaporates.
