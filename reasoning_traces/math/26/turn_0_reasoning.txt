==================================================

First, we need to understand that 20% of the seawater is salt. This means that 20% of the 2 liters of seawater Jack collected is salt.

To find out how much salt is in the seawater, we need to calculate 20% of 2 liters. 

We know that 1 liter is equal to 1000 milliliters (ml). Therefore, 2 liters is equal to 2000 ml.

Now, we calculate 20% of 2000 ml. 

To do this, we multiply 2000 ml by 20% (or 0.20 in decimal form):

2000 ml * 0.20 = 400 ml

So, when all the water evaporates, Jack will be left with 400 ml of salt. 

Final Answer: Jack will get 400 ml of salt.
