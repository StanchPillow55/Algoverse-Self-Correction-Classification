==================================================

To determine how much salt Jack will get when all the water evaporates from the seawater he collected, we can follow these steps:

1. **Understand the composition of seawater**: The problem states that the seawater is 20% salt. This means that for every 100 parts of seawater, 20 parts are salt.

2. **Calculate the amount of salt in the seawater**: 
   - Jack collected 2 liters of seawater. 
   - To find out how much of that is salt, we can use the percentage given (20%).

   First, we convert liters to milliliters since the final answer needs to be in milliliters. 
   - 1 liter = 1000 milliliters, so:
   \[
   2 \text{ liters} = 2 \times 1000 \text{ ml} = 2000 \text{ ml}
   \]

3. **Calculate the amount of salt**:
   - Since the seawater is 20% salt, we can calculate the amount of salt in 2000 ml of seawater as follows:
   \[
   \text{Amount of salt} = \text{Total volume of seawater} \times \text{Percentage of salt}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Amount of salt} = 2000 \text{ ml} \times 0.20 = 400 \text{ ml}
   \]

4. **Final answer**: When all the water evaporates, Jack will be left with 400 ml of salt.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{400 \text{ ml}}
\]
