To find out how much Mishka spent on all the clothing items, we need to calculate the total cost for each type of clothing item and then sum those amounts.

1. **Calculate the total cost of the shorts:**
   - Mishka bought 3 pairs of shorts.
   - The cost of one pair of shorts is $16.50.
   - Total cost for shorts = Number of pairs × Cost per pair
   \[
   \text{Total cost for shorts} = 3 \times 16.50 = 49.50
   \]

2. **Calculate the total cost of the pants:**
   - Mishka bought 3 pairs of pants.
   - The cost of one pair of pants is $22.50.
   - Total cost for pants = Number of pairs × Cost per pair
   \[
   \text{Total cost for pants} = 3 \times 22.50 = 67.50
   \]

3. **Calculate the total cost of the shoes:**
   - Mishka bought 3 pairs of shoes.
   - The cost of one pair of shoes is $42.00.
   - Total cost for shoes = Number of pairs × Cost per pair
   \[
   \text{Total cost for shoes} = 3 \times 42.00 = 126.00
   \]

4. **Calculate the total amount spent on all clothing items:**
   - Now we sum the total costs of shorts, pants, and shoes.
   \[
   \text{Total amount spent} = \text{Total cost for shorts} + \text{Total cost for pants} + \text{Total cost for shoes}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total amount spent} = 49.50 + 67.50 + 126.00
   \]

5. **Perform the addition:**
   - First, add the cost of shorts and pants:
   \[
   49.50 + 67.50 = 117.00
   \]
   - Now, add this result to the cost of shoes:
   \[
   117.00 + 126.00 = 243.00
   \]

Thus, the total amount Mishka spent on all the clothing items is \(\boxed{243.00}\) dollars.
