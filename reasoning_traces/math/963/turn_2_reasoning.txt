==================================================

Let's denote the number of Pokémon caught by Alex, Stan, and Adelwolfe as \( A \), \( S \), and \( D \) respectively.

From the problem, we have the following information:

1. The total number of Pokémon caught by all three is:
   \[
   A + S + D = 339
   \]

2. Alex has caught 5 more than Stan:
   \[
   A = S + 5
   \]

3. Stan has caught 13 less than 4 times what Adelwolfe has caught:
   \[
   S = 4D - 13
   \]

Now, we can substitute the expressions for \( A \) and \( S \) into the total equation.

First, substitute \( A \) into the total equation:
\[
(S + 5) + S + D = 339
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
2S + D + 5 = 339
\]
Subtract 5 from both sides:
\[
2S + D = 334 \quad \text{(Equation 1)}
\]

Next, substitute \( S \) from the third equation into Equation 1:
\[
2(4D - 13) + D = 334
\]
Distributing the 2:
\[
8D - 26 + D = 334
\]
Combine like terms:
\[
9D - 26 = 334
\]
Add 26 to both sides:
\[
9D = 360
\]
Now, divide by 9:
\[
D = 40
\]

Now that we have \( D \), we can find \( S \):
\[
S = 4D - 13 = 4(40) - 13 = 160 - 13 = 147
\]

Finally, we can find \( A \):
\[
A = S + 5 = 147 + 5 = 152
\]

Now, let's verify:
- Total Pokémon: \( A + S + D = 152 + 147 + 40 = 339 \) (correct)
- Alex has 5 more than Stan: \( 152 = 147 + 5 \) (correct)
- Stan has 13 less than 4 times Adelwolfe: \( 147 = 4(40) - 13 \) (correct)

Thus, the number of Pokémon Stan has caught is:
\[
\boxed{147}
\]
