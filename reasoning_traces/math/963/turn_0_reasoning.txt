==================================================

Let's define the number of Pokémon caught by each person using variables:

- Let \( A \) be the number of Pokémon caught by Alex.
- Let \( S \) be the number of Pokémon caught by Stan.
- Let \( D \) be the number of Pokémon caught by Adelwolfe.

From the problem, we have the following information:

1. Together, they have caught 339 Pokémon:
   \[
   A + S + D = 339
   \]

2. Alex has caught 5 more than Stan:
   \[
   A = S + 5
   \]

3. Stan has caught 13 less than 4 times as many as Adelwolfe has caught:
   \[
   S = 4D - 13
   \]

Now, we can substitute the expressions for \( A \) and \( S \) into the first equation.

First, substitute \( A \) from the second equation into the first equation:
\[
(S + 5) + S + D = 339
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
2S + D + 5 = 339
\]
Subtract 5 from both sides:
\[
2S + D = 334 \quad \text{(Equation 1)}
\]

Next, substitute \( S \) from the third equation into Equation 1. We can express \( D \) in terms of \( S \):
\[
D = \frac{334 - 2S}{1} \quad \text{(from Equation 1)}
\]

Now, substitute this expression for \( D \) into the equation for \( S \):
\[
S = 4D - 13
\]
Substituting \( D \):
\[
S = 4\left(\frac{334 - 2S}{1}\right) - 13
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
S = 1336 - 8S - 13
\]
Combine like terms:
\[
S + 8S = 1336 - 13
\]
\[
9S = 1323
\]
Now, divide both sides by 9:
\[
S = \frac{1323}{9} = 147
\]

Now that we have \( S \), we can find \( A \) and \( D \).

Using \( S = 147 \) to find \( A \):
\[
A = S + 5 = 147 + 5 = 152
\]

Now, using \( S \) to find \( D \):
\[
D = \frac{334 - 2S}{1} = \frac{334 - 2(147)}{1} = \frac{334 - 294}{1} = 40
\]

Now, let's verify that the total number of Pokémon caught is correct:
\[
A + S + D = 152 + 147 + 40 = 339
\]

Thus, the calculations are consistent with the problem statement.

Finally, the number of Pokémon caught by Stan is:
\[
\boxed{147}
\]
