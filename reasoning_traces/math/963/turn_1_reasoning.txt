==================================================

Let's define the variables for the number of Pokémon each person has caught:

- Let \( A \) be the number of Pokémon Alex has caught.
- Let \( S \) be the number of Pokémon Stan has caught.
- Let \( D \) be the number of Pokémon Adelwolfe has caught.

From the problem, we have the following information:

1. Together, they have caught 339 Pokémon:
   \[
   A + S + D = 339
   \]

2. Alex has caught 5 more than Stan:
   \[
   A = S + 5
   \]

3. Stan has caught 13 less than 4 times as many as Adelwolfe has caught:
   \[
   S = 4D - 13
   \]

Now, we can substitute the expressions for \( A \) and \( S \) into the first equation.

First, substitute \( A \) into the total equation:
\[
(S + 5) + S + D = 339
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
2S + D + 5 = 339
\]
Subtracting 5 from both sides gives:
\[
2S + D = 334 \quad \text{(Equation 1)}
\]

Next, substitute \( S \) from the third equation into Equation 1. We know:
\[
S = 4D - 13
\]
Substituting this into Equation 1:
\[
2(4D - 13) + D = 334
\]
Expanding this gives:
\[
8D - 26 + D = 334
\]
Combining like terms results in:
\[
9D - 26 = 334
\]
Adding 26 to both sides:
\[
9D = 360
\]
Dividing by 9:
\[
D = 40
\]

Now that we have \( D \), we can find \( S \):
\[
S = 4D - 13 = 4(40) - 13 = 160 - 13 = 147
\]

Finally, we can find \( A \):
\[
A = S + 5 = 147 + 5 = 152
\]

Now, let's verify that the total is correct:
\[
A + S + D = 152 + 147 + 40 = 339
\]
This confirms our calculations are correct.

Thus, the number of Pokémon Stan has caught is:
\[
\boxed{147}
\]
