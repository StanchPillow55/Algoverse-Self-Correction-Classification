Let \( x \) be the initial charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park. We will calculate the remaining charge after the specified time intervals and percentages of loss.

1. **First 5 hours**: The power bank loses 9% of its total capacity each hour. Therefore, after 5 hours, the total percentage of charge lost can be calculated as follows:
   \[
   \text{Charge lost in 5 hours} = 5 \times 9\% = 45\%
   \]
   Thus, the remaining charge after 5 hours is:
   \[
   \text{Remaining charge after 5 hours} = x - 0.45x = 0.55x
   \]

2. **Next 3 hours**: After the first 5 hours, the power bank starts losing 7% of its total capacity each hour for the next 3 hours. The total percentage of charge lost during this period is:
   \[
   \text{Charge lost in 3 hours} = 3 \times 7\% = 21\%
   \]
   Therefore, the remaining charge after these 3 hours is:
   \[
   \text{Remaining charge after 3 more hours} = 0.55x - 0.21x = 0.34x
   \]

3. **Final charge**: We know that the final charge remaining in the power bank is 28%. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
   \[
   0.34x = 28\%
   \]

4. **Solving for \( x \)**:
   To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 0.34:
   \[
   x = \frac{28\%}{0.34}
   \]

   Performing the division:
   \[
   x = \frac{28}{0.34} \approx 82.35\%
   \]

Thus, the initial charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park was approximately **82.35%**. 

Final answer:
\[
\boxed{82.35\%}
\]
