To find the initial charge of Maria's power bank when she went out to the park, we can set up the problem step by step.

Let \( x \) be the initial charge of the power bank in percentage.

1. **First 5 hours**: The power bank loses 9% of its total capacity each hour. Therefore, after 5 hours, the total percentage lost is:
   \[
   5 \text{ hours} \times 9\% = 45\%
   \]
   The remaining charge after 5 hours is:
   \[
   x - 45\%
   \]

2. **Next 3 hours**: After 5 hours, the power bank starts losing 7% of its total capacity each hour. Therefore, over the next 3 hours, the total percentage lost is:
   \[
   3 \text{ hours} \times 7\% = 21\%
   \]
   The remaining charge after these 3 hours is:
   \[
   (x - 45\%) - 21\% = x - 66\%
   \]

3. **Final charge**: We know that the final charge remaining is 28%. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
   \[
   x - 66\% = 28\%
   \]

4. **Solving for \( x \)**:
   \[
   x = 28\% + 66\%
   \]
   \[
   x = 94\%
   \]

Thus, the initial charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park was **94%**. 

Final answer:
\[
\boxed{94\%}
\]
