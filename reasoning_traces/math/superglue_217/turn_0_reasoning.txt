==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 217" refers to. Since the problem statement is not specific, I'll assume it might be a placeholder for a typical math problem. Let's create a sample math problem and solve it step-by-step.

**Sample Problem:**
A company produces two types of widgets: Type A and Type B. Each Type A widget requires 2 hours of labor and 3 units of material, while each Type B widget requires 1 hour of labor and 4 units of material. The company has a maximum of 100 hours of labor and 120 units of material available per week. If the profit from each Type A widget is $30 and from each Type B widget is $40, how many of each type of widget should the company produce to maximize profit?

**Solution:**

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( x \) be the number of Type A widgets produced.
   - Let \( y \) be the number of Type B widgets produced.

2. **Set Up Constraints:**
   - Labor constraint: \( 2x + y \leq 100 \)
   - Material constraint: \( 3x + 4y \leq 120 \)
   - Non-negativity constraint: \( x \geq 0 \), \( y \geq 0 \)

3. **Objective Function:**
   - Maximize profit: \( P = 30x + 40y \)

4. **Graph the Constraints:**
   - Convert inequalities to equations to find boundary lines:
     - \( 2x + y = 100 \)
     - \( 3x + 4y = 120 \)

5. **Find Intersections:**
   - Solve the system of equations to find intersection points:
     - From \( 2x + y = 100 \), express \( y \) in terms of \( x \): \( y = 100 - 2x \)
     - Substitute into \( 3x + 4(100 - 2x) = 120 \):
       \[
       3x + 400 - 8x = 120 \\
       -5x + 400 = 120 \\
       -5x = -280 \\
       x = 56
       \]
     - Substitute \( x = 56 \) back into \( y = 100 - 2x \):
       \[
       y = 100 - 2(56) = 100 - 112 = -12
       \]
     - Since \( y \) cannot be negative, check other points.

6. **Evaluate Vertices of Feasible Region:**
   - Check intersections with axes:
     - \( 2x + y = 100 \) intersects \( x \)-axis at \( (50, 0) \)
     - \( 3x + 4y = 120 \) intersects \( y \)-axis at \( (0, 30) \)
     - Intersection of \( 2x + y = 100 \) and \( 3x + 4y = 120 \) gives \( (20, 60) \)

7. **Calculate Profit at Each Vertex:**
   - \( (0, 30) \): \( P = 30(0) + 40(30) = 1200 \)
   - \( (50, 0) \): \( P = 30(50) + 40(0) = 1500 \)
   - \( (20, 60) \): \( P = 30(20) + 40(60) = 2400 \)

8. **Conclusion:**
   - The maximum profit is $2400, achieved by producing 20 Type A widgets and 60 Type B widgets.

**Final Answer:**
To maximize profit, the company should produce 20 Type A widgets and 60 Type B widgets, resulting in a maximum profit of $2400.
