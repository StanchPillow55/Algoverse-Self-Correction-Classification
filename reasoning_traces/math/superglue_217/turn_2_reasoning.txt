==================================================

To solve the problem effectively, let's first clarify the context and details of the question. However, it seems like the question "Sample reasoning question 217" is not providing specific mathematical details or context. Therefore, I'll demonstrate a general approach to solving a typical math problem by creating a sample problem and solving it step-by-step.

### Sample Problem:
**Question:** A rectangle has a length that is 3 times its width. If the perimeter of the rectangle is 48 units, find the dimensions of the rectangle.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We need to find the length and width of a rectangle.
   - The length is 3 times the width.
   - The perimeter of the rectangle is given as 48 units.

2. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( w \) be the width of the rectangle.
   - Then the length \( l \) can be expressed as \( l = 3w \).

3. **Use the Perimeter Formula:**
   - The formula for the perimeter \( P \) of a rectangle is:
     \[
     P = 2l + 2w
     \]
   - Substitute the given perimeter and the expression for the length:
     \[
     48 = 2(3w) + 2w
     \]

4. **Simplify and Solve the Equation:**
   - Simplify the equation:
     \[
     48 = 6w + 2w
     \]
     \[
     48 = 8w
     \]
   - Solve for \( w \):
     \[
     w = \frac{48}{8} = 6
     \]

5. **Find the Length:**
   - Since \( l = 3w \), substitute \( w = 6 \):
     \[
     l = 3 \times 6 = 18
     \]

6. **Verify the Solution:**
   - Check the perimeter with the found dimensions:
     \[
     P = 2l + 2w = 2(18) + 2(6) = 36 + 12 = 48
     \]
   - The calculated perimeter matches the given perimeter, confirming our solution is correct.

### Final Answer:
The dimensions of the rectangle are:
- Width = 6 units
- Length = 18 units

This approach demonstrates how to systematically solve a math problem by defining variables, using given formulas, solving equations, and verifying the solution. If you have a specific problem or context in mind, please provide more details for a tailored solution.
