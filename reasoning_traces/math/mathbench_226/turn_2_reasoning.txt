Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we first need to understand what "Sample math problem 226" refers to. Since the problem itself is not explicitly stated, I'll assume a typical math problem that might be labeled as "226" in a sequence of problems. Let's consider a common type of math problem, such as solving a quadratic equation, which is often encountered in math courses.

**Problem Assumption:**
Solve the quadratic equation: \( x^2 - 5x + 6 = 0 \).

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Identify the quadratic equation:**
   The given equation is \( x^2 - 5x + 6 = 0 \).

2. **Factor the quadratic equation:**
   To factor the quadratic equation, we look for two numbers that multiply to the constant term (6) and add to the linear coefficient (-5).

   The factors of 6 are: 1 and 6, 2 and 3. We need a pair that adds up to -5. The pair that satisfies this is -2 and -3 because:
   \[
   (-2) \times (-3) = 6 \quad \text{and} \quad (-2) + (-3) = -5
   \]

3. **Write the factored form:**
   Using the numbers found, we can write the factored form of the quadratic equation:
   \[
   (x - 2)(x - 3) = 0
   \]

4. **Solve for the roots:**
   Set each factor equal to zero and solve for \( x \):
   \[
   x - 2 = 0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad x = 2
   \]
   \[
   x - 3 = 0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad x = 3
   \]

5. **Verify the solutions:**
   Substitute \( x = 2 \) and \( x = 3 \) back into the original equation to ensure they satisfy it:
   - For \( x = 2 \):
     \[
     (2)^2 - 5(2) + 6 = 4 - 10 + 6 = 0
     \]
   - For \( x = 3 \):
     \[
     (3)^2 - 5(3) + 6 = 9 - 15 + 6 = 0
     \]

   Both solutions satisfy the original equation.

**Final Answer:**
The solutions to the quadratic equation \( x^2 - 5x + 6 = 0 \) are \( x = 2 \) and \( x = 3 \).
