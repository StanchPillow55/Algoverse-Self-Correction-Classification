To solve the problem, we need to determine how many people were on the ship that the monster ate in the first hundred years, given that the number of people on each successive ship doubles.

Let's denote the number of people on the ship in the first hundred years as \( x \).

According to the problem, the monster rises every hundred years and consumes a ship. Over three hundred years, it has consumed three ships, one in each century. The number of people on the ships for each century can be expressed as follows:

1. **First century (0-100 years)**: \( x \) people
2. **Second century (100-200 years)**: \( 2x \) people (the ship has twice as many people)
3. **Third century (200-300 years)**: \( 4x \) people (the ship has twice as many people as the second ship)

Now, we can calculate the total number of people consumed over the three centuries:

\[
\text{Total people consumed} = x + 2x + 4x
\]

Combining the terms:

\[
x + 2x + 4x = 7x
\]

According to the problem, the monster has consumed a total of 847 people over these three centuries. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

\[
7x = 847
\]

To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 7:

\[
x = \frac{847}{7}
\]

Calculating the division:

\[
x = 121
\]

Thus, the number of people on the ship that the monster ate in the first hundred years is \( \boxed{121} \).
