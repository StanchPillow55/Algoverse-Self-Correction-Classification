==================================================

Let's denote the number of people on the first ship as x. 

According to the problem, each new ship has twice as many people as the last ship. So, the number of people on the second ship is 2x and the number of people on the third ship is 2*2x = 4x.

The total number of people eaten by the monster over three hundred years is 847, which is the sum of the people on all three ships. So, we can write the equation:

x + 2x + 4x = 847

This simplifies to:

7x = 847

To find the value of x, we divide both sides of the equation by 7:

x = 847 / 7 = 121

So, there were 121 people on the ship the monster ate in the first hundred years.
