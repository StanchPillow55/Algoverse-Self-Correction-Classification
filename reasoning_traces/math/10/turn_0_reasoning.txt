To solve the problem, we need to determine how many people were on the ship that the monster ate in the first hundred years, given that the number of people on each subsequent ship doubles.

Let's break down the information provided:

1. The monster rises every 100 years and has been active for 300 years, which means it has risen three times (once every 100 years).
2. Over these three occurrences, the monster has consumed a total of 847 people.
3. The number of people on each ship doubles with each subsequent occurrence.

Let's denote the number of people on the first ship (the ship eaten in the first hundred years) as \( x \).

According to the problem, the number of people on the second ship (the ship eaten in the second hundred years) would be \( 2x \) (since it doubles), and the number of people on the third ship (the ship eaten in the third hundred years) would be \( 4x \) (since it doubles again).

Now we can set up an equation to represent the total number of people consumed by the monster over the three occurrences:

\[
x + 2x + 4x = 847
\]

Now, let's simplify the left side of the equation:

\[
x + 2x + 4x = 7x
\]

So, we have:

\[
7x = 847
\]

Next, we solve for \( x \):

\[
x = \frac{847}{7}
\]

Calculating \( \frac{847}{7} \):

\[
x = 121
\]

Thus, the number of people on the ship that the monster ate in the first hundred years is \( 121 \).

To verify, we can calculate the number of people on the subsequent ships:

- First ship: \( x = 121 \)
- Second ship: \( 2x = 2 \times 121 = 242 \)
- Third ship: \( 4x = 4 \times 121 = 484 \)

Now, let's check the total:

\[
121 + 242 + 484 = 847
\]

This confirms our calculations are correct.

Therefore, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{121}
\]
