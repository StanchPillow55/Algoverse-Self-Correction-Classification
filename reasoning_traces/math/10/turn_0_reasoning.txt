To solve the problem, we will calculate the number of downloads for each month step by step and then find the total downloads over the three months.

1. **First Month Downloads**:
   - The problem states that there were 60 downloads in the first month.
   \[
   \text{Downloads in Month 1} = 60
   \]

2. **Second Month Downloads**:
   - The number of downloads in the second month is three times the downloads in the first month.
   \[
   \text{Downloads in Month 2} = 3 \times \text{Downloads in Month 1} = 3 \times 60 = 180
   \]

3. **Third Month Downloads**:
   - The downloads in the third month are reduced by 30% from the second month. First, we need to calculate 30% of the second month's downloads.
   \[
   30\% \text{ of Month 2} = 0.30 \times 180 = 54
   \]
   - Now, we subtract this amount from the second month's downloads to find the third month's downloads.
   \[
   \text{Downloads in Month 3} = \text{Downloads in Month 2} - 30\% \text{ of Month 2} = 180 - 54 = 126
   \]

4. **Total Downloads Over Three Months**:
   - Now we will add the downloads from all three months together.
   \[
   \text{Total Downloads} = \text{Downloads in Month 1} + \text{Downloads in Month 2} + \text{Downloads in Month 3}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total Downloads} = 60 + 180 + 126
   \]
   - Performing the addition:
   \[
   60 + 180 = 240
   \]
   \[
   240 + 126 = 366
   \]

Thus, the total number of downloads over the three months is:
\[
\boxed{366}
\]
