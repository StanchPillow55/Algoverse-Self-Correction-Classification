==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine how many apples each person picked and then find out how many more apples Suraya picked than Kayla.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Determine how many apples Caleb picked:**
   - We know from the problem that Caleb picked 5 apples less than Kayla.
   - Kayla picked 20 apples.
   - Therefore, the number of apples Caleb picked is:
     \[
     \text{Caleb's apples} = \text{Kayla's apples} - 5 = 20 - 5 = 15
     \]

2. **Determine how many apples Suraya picked:**
   - The problem states that Suraya picked 12 apples more than Caleb.
   - We already calculated that Caleb picked 15 apples.
   - Therefore, the number of apples Suraya picked is:
     \[
     \text{Suraya's apples} = \text{Caleb's apples} + 12 = 15 + 12 = 27
     \]

3. **Calculate how many more apples Suraya picked than Kayla:**
   - We need to find the difference between the number of apples Suraya picked and the number of apples Kayla picked.
   - Suraya picked 27 apples, and Kayla picked 20 apples.
   - The difference is:
     \[
     \text{Difference} = \text{Suraya's apples} - \text{Kayla's apples} = 27 - 20 = 7
     \]

Therefore, Suraya picked 7 more apples than Kayla.

**Final Answer: Suraya picked 7 more apples than Kayla.**
