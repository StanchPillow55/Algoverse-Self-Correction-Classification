==================================================

To solve the problem, we will follow these steps:

1. **Determine the number of pupils who like blue.**
2. **Calculate the number of pupils remaining after accounting for those who like blue.**
3. **Find out how many of the remaining pupils like green.**
4. **Calculate how many pupils like yellow.**

### Step 1: Determine the number of pupils who like blue.

The total number of pupils in the class is 40. According to the problem, half of the class likes blue.

\[
\text{Number of pupils who like blue} = \frac{1}{2} \times 40 = 20
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the number of pupils remaining after accounting for those who like blue.

Now, we subtract the number of pupils who like blue from the total number of pupils.

\[
\text{Number of pupils remaining} = 40 - 20 = 20
\]

### Step 3: Find out how many of the remaining pupils like green.

One-fourth of the remaining pupils like green. We need to calculate one-fourth of the remaining 20 pupils.

\[
\text{Number of pupils who like green} = \frac{1}{4} \times 20 = 5
\]

### Step 4: Calculate how many pupils like yellow.

Now, we need to find out how many pupils like yellow. We do this by subtracting the number of pupils who like blue and green from the total number of pupils.

\[
\text{Number of pupils who like yellow} = \text{Total pupils} - (\text{Pupils who like blue} + \text{Pupils who like green})
\]

Substituting the values we have:

\[
\text{Number of pupils who like yellow} = 40 - (20 + 5) = 40 - 25 = 15
\]

### Final Answer

The number of pupils who like the color yellow is \( \boxed{15} \).
