==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to establish the relationships between the number of apples picked by Suraya, Caleb, and Kayla.

1. **Identify the number of apples Kayla picked**: 
   According to the problem, Kayla picked 20 apples.

   \[
   \text{Kayla's apples} = 20
   \]

2. **Determine how many apples Caleb picked**: 
   The problem states that Caleb picked 5 apples less than Kayla. Therefore, we can calculate the number of apples Caleb picked by subtracting 5 from the number of apples Kayla picked.

   \[
   \text{Caleb's apples} = \text{Kayla's apples} - 5 = 20 - 5 = 15
   \]

3. **Calculate how many apples Suraya picked**: 
   The problem also states that Suraya picked 12 apples more than Caleb. We can find the number of apples Suraya picked by adding 12 to the number of apples Caleb picked.

   \[
   \text{Suraya's apples} = \text{Caleb's apples} + 12 = 15 + 12 = 27
   \]

4. **Determine how many more apples Suraya picked than Kayla**: 
   Finally, we need to find out how many more apples Suraya picked than Kayla. We do this by subtracting the number of apples Kayla picked from the number of apples Suraya picked.

   \[
   \text{Difference} = \text{Suraya's apples} - \text{Kayla's apples} = 27 - 20 = 7
   \]

Thus, Suraya picked 7 more apples than Kayla.

**Final Answer**: Suraya picked 7 more apples than Kayla.
