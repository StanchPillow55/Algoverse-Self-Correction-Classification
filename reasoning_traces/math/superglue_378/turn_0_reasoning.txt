==================================================

To solve this problem, I'll need more information about what "Sample reasoning question 378" entails. Since I don't have access to external databases or specific problem sets, I'll guide you through a general approach to solving a typical math reasoning problem. If you have specific details or numbers from the problem, please provide them, and I'll tailor the solution accordingly.

Let's assume "Sample reasoning question 378" is a typical math problem involving logical reasoning or arithmetic. Here's a step-by-step approach to solving such problems:

### Step 1: Understand the Problem
- **Read the problem carefully.** Identify what is being asked. Are you solving for a number, proving a statement, or finding a pattern?
- **Identify the given information.** What data or conditions are provided?

### Step 2: Devise a Plan
- **Choose a strategy.** Depending on the problem, you might use algebra, geometry, arithmetic, or logical reasoning.
- **Consider similar problems.** Have you solved a similar problem before? What methods did you use?

### Step 3: Carry Out the Plan
- **Execute your chosen strategy.** Perform calculations or logical steps methodically.
- **Show all work.** Write down each step to avoid mistakes and make your reasoning clear.

### Step 4: Review/Check Your Work
- **Verify each step.** Ensure calculations are correct and logical steps are valid.
- **Check the final answer.** Does it make sense in the context of the problem?

### Example Problem
Let's create a sample problem to illustrate this process:

**Problem:** A store sells apples at $2 each and bananas at $1.50 each. If a customer buys 3 apples and 4 bananas, how much do they spend in total?

#### Step 1: Understand the Problem
- We need to calculate the total cost of 3 apples and 4 bananas.

#### Step 2: Devise a Plan
- We'll multiply the number of apples by the price per apple and the number of bananas by the price per banana, then add the two amounts.

#### Step 3: Carry Out the Plan
1. **Calculate the cost of apples:**
   \[
   \text{Cost of apples} = 3 \times 2 = 6 \text{ dollars}
   \]
2. **Calculate the cost of bananas:**
   \[
   \text{Cost of bananas} = 4 \times 1.50 = 6 \text{ dollars}
   \]
3. **Calculate the total cost:**
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = 6 + 6 = 12 \text{ dollars}
   \]

#### Step 4: Review/Check Your Work
- The calculations are straightforward and correct. The total cost of 3 apples and 4 bananas is $12.

### Final Answer
The customer spends a total of $12.

If you provide specific details or numbers from "Sample reasoning question 378," I can offer a more tailored solution.
