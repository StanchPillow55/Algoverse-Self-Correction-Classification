Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 378" entails. Since the problem statement does not provide specific details about the question, I'll demonstrate a general approach to solving a typical math problem by outlining the steps and reasoning involved.

### Step-by-Step Approach:

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - Identify what is being asked. Since the problem is not specified, let's assume it involves solving an equation or finding a value.
   - Determine what information is given and what needs to be found.

2. **Devise a Plan:**
   - Choose a strategy to solve the problem. Common strategies include:
     - Solving equations
     - Using algebraic manipulation
     - Applying formulas
     - Logical reasoning

3. **Carry Out the Plan:**
   - Execute the chosen strategy step by step.
   - Perform calculations carefully and check each step for accuracy.

4. **Review/Check the Solution:**
   - Verify that the solution is correct and that it answers the question.
   - Check the calculations and reasoning for any errors.

### Example Problem:

Let's assume "Sample reasoning question 378" is a simple algebra problem:

**Problem:** Solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).

#### Step 1: Understand the Problem
- We need to find the value of \( x \) that satisfies the equation.

#### Step 2: Devise a Plan
- Use algebraic manipulation to isolate \( x \).

#### Step 3: Carry Out the Plan
1. Start with the equation:  
   \[
   2x + 3 = 11
   \]

2. Subtract 3 from both sides to isolate the term with \( x \):  
   \[
   2x + 3 - 3 = 11 - 3
   \]
   \[
   2x = 8
   \]

3. Divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( x \):  
   \[
   \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{8}{2}
   \]
   \[
   x = 4
   \]

#### Step 4: Review/Check the Solution
- Substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation to verify:  
  \[
  2(4) + 3 = 8 + 3 = 11
  \]
- The left side equals the right side, confirming that \( x = 4 \) is correct.

### Final Answer:
The solution to the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \) is \( x = 4 \).

This example demonstrates a structured approach to solving a math problem. If "Sample reasoning question 378" refers to a different type of problem, please provide more details for a tailored solution.
