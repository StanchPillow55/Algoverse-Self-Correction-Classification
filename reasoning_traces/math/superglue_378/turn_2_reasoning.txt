Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 378" refers to. Since the problem statement is not specific, I'll assume it's a placeholder for a generic math problem. Let's create a sample math problem and solve it step by step.

**Sample Problem:**
Calculate the sum of the first 10 positive integers.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Identify the Sequence:**
   The first 10 positive integers are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.

2. **Understand the Formula:**
   The sum of the first \( n \) positive integers can be calculated using the formula:
   \[
   S = \frac{n(n + 1)}{2}
   \]
   where \( n \) is the number of terms.

3. **Substitute the Values:**
   Here, \( n = 10 \). Substitute 10 into the formula:
   \[
   S = \frac{10(10 + 1)}{2}
   \]

4. **Perform the Calculations:**
   - Calculate \( 10 + 1 = 11 \).
   - Multiply 10 by 11 to get 110.
   - Divide 110 by 2 to get 55.

5. **Verify the Calculation:**
   To ensure the calculation is correct, let's add the numbers directly:
   \[
   1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 10
   \]
   - Pair the numbers from the start and end: \( (1+10), (2+9), (3+8), (4+7), (5+6) \).
   - Each pair sums to 11, and there are 5 pairs.
   - Therefore, the total sum is \( 5 \times 11 = 55 \).

6. **Conclusion:**
   Both methods give the same result, confirming the calculation is correct.

**Final Answer:**
The sum of the first 10 positive integers is 55.
