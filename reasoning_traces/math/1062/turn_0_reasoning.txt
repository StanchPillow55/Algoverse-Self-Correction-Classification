To find the total cost of Hannah's doctor's visit, we need to calculate each component of the expenses and then sum them up. Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Cost of the cast**: 
   - The doctor charges $200 for the cast.
   - Cost of the cast = $200.

2. **Cost of the doctor's visit**:
   - The doctor charges $300 per hour for the visit.
   - Since the visit lasts for 30 minutes, we need to convert this time into hours. 
   - 30 minutes is half an hour, which is \(0.5\) hours.
   - Therefore, the cost for the visit is:
     \[
     \text{Cost of visit} = 300 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 0.5 \, \text{hours} = 150 \, \text{dollars}.
     \]

3. **Cost of painkillers**:
   - The doctor charges $4 per pill for painkillers.
   - Hannah needs 30 painkillers.
   - Therefore, the cost for the painkillers is:
     \[
     \text{Cost of painkillers} = 4 \, \text{dollars/pill} \times 30 \, \text{pills} = 120 \, \text{dollars}.
     \]

4. **Cost of parking**:
   - The doctor charges $6 per hour for parking.
   - There is a mandatory minimum of 2 hours of parking.
   - Therefore, the cost for parking is:
     \[
     \text{Cost of parking} = 6 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 2 \, \text{hours} = 12 \, \text{dollars}.
     \]

5. **Total cost**:
   - Now we sum all the costs calculated:
     \[
     \text{Total cost} = \text{Cost of cast} + \text{Cost of visit} + \text{Cost of painkillers} + \text{Cost of parking}.
     \]
   - Plugging in the values:
     \[
     \text{Total cost} = 200 + 150 + 120 + 12.
     \]
   - Performing the addition step-by-step:
     \[
     200 + 150 = 350,
     \]
     \[
     350 + 120 = 470,
     \]
     \[
     470 + 12 = 482.
     \]

Thus, the total cost of Hannah's doctor's visit is **$482**.

Final answer: **$482**.
