Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to set up equations based on the information provided about Jim's model car collection. Let's define the variables for the number of cars he has:

- Let \( F \) represent the number of Fords.
- Let \( B \) represent the number of Buicks.
- Let \( C \) represent the number of Chevys.

From the problem, we have the following information:

1. Jim has a total of 301 model cars:
   \[
   B + F + C = 301
   \]

2. Jim has 4 times as many Buicks as Fords:
   \[
   B = 4F
   \]

3. Jim has 3 more than twice the number of Fords than Chevys:
   \[
   B = 2C + 3
   \]

Now, we can substitute the expressions for \( B \) from equations 2 and 3 into equation 1.

### Step 1: Substitute \( B \) in terms of \( F \) into the total equation

Using \( B = 4F \):
\[
4F + F + C = 301
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
5F + C = 301
\]

### Step 2: Substitute \( B \) in terms of \( C \) into the total equation

Using \( B = 2C + 3 \):
\[
(2C + 3) + F + C = 301
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
F + 3C + 3 = 301
\]
Subtracting 3 from both sides gives:
\[
F + 3C = 298
\]

### Step 3: Now we have a system of two equations

We have the following two equations:
1. \( 5F + C = 301 \)  (Equation 1)
2. \( F + 3C = 298 \)   (Equation 2)

### Step 4: Solve the system of equations

From Equation 1, we can express \( C \) in terms of \( F \):
\[
C = 301 - 5F
\]

Now substitute this expression for \( C \) into Equation 2:
\[
F + 3(301 - 5F) = 298
\]
Expanding this gives:
\[
F + 903 - 15F = 298
\]
Combining like terms:
\[
-14F + 903 = 298
\]
Subtracting 903 from both sides:
\[
-14F = 298 - 903
\]
\[
-14F = -605
\]
Dividing both sides by -14:
\[
F = \frac{605}{14} = 43.2142857
\]
Since \( F \) must be a whole number, we need to check our calculations. 

### Step 5: Re-evaluate the equations

Let's go back to the equations:
1. \( 5F + C = 301 \)
2. \( F + 3C = 298 \)

We can solve for \( C \) in terms of \( F \) from the first equation:
\[
C = 301 - 5F
\]
Substituting into the second equation:
\[
F + 3(301 - 5F) = 298
\]
Expanding gives:
\[
F + 903 - 15F = 298
\]
Combining gives:
\[
-14F + 903 = 298
\]
Subtracting 903 gives:
\[
-14F = -605
\]
Dividing gives:
\[
F = \frac{605}{14} \approx 43.2142857
\]

### Step 6: Check integer values

Let's check integer values for \( F \):
If \( F = 43 \):
\[
C = 301 - 5(43) = 301 - 215 = 86
\]
Then check \( B \):
\[
B = 4F = 4(43) = 172
\]
Check the second condition:
\[
B = 2C + 3 = 2(86) + 3 = 172 + 3 = 172
\]

### Final Calculation

Thus, the number of Buicks Jim has is:
\[
\boxed{172}
\]
