To solve this problem, we need to set up equations based on the information given and solve for the number of Buicks Jim has.

Let's define the variables:
- Let \( F \) be the number of Ford models Jim has.
- Let \( B \) be the number of Buick models Jim has.
- Let \( C \) be the number of Chevy models Jim has.

According to the problem, we have the following relationships:

1. Jim has 4 times as many Buicks as Fords:
   \[
   B = 4F
   \]

2. Jim has 3 more than twice the number of Fords than Chevys:
   \[
   F = 2C + 3
   \]

3. The total number of models is 301:
   \[
   F + B + C = 301
   \]

Now, we will substitute the expressions for \( B \) and \( F \) from equations (1) and (2) into equation (3).

First, substitute \( B = 4F \) into the total equation:
\[
F + 4F + C = 301
\]
Simplify:
\[
5F + C = 301
\]

Next, substitute \( F = 2C + 3 \) into the equation \( 5F + C = 301 \):
\[
5(2C + 3) + C = 301
\]
Distribute the 5:
\[
10C + 15 + C = 301
\]
Combine like terms:
\[
11C + 15 = 301
\]
Subtract 15 from both sides:
\[
11C = 286
\]
Divide by 11:
\[
C = 26
\]

Now that we have \( C = 26 \), substitute back to find \( F \):
\[
F = 2C + 3 = 2(26) + 3 = 52 + 3 = 55
\]

Finally, use \( F = 55 \) to find \( B \):
\[
B = 4F = 4(55) = 220
\]

Thus, Jim has 220 Buicks.

Final Answer:
Jim has 220 Buicks.
