==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to determine the time it takes for the car in the slow lane to cover the same distance of 480 miles, given that it travels at half the speed of the car in the fast lane.

### Step 1: Determine the speed of the slow lane car
The car in the fast lane is traveling at 60 miles per hour. The speed of the car in the slow lane is half of that speed:

\[
\text{Speed of slow lane car} = \frac{60 \text{ miles/hour}}{2} = 30 \text{ miles/hour}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the time taken by the slow lane car to cover 480 miles
To find the time taken to cover a certain distance, we can use the formula:

\[
\text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}}
\]

In this case, the distance is 480 miles and the speed of the slow lane car is 30 miles per hour. Plugging in these values:

\[
\text{Time} = \frac{480 \text{ miles}}{30 \text{ miles/hour}}
\]

### Step 3: Perform the calculation
Now, we perform the division:

\[
\text{Time} = \frac{480}{30} = 16 \text{ hours}
\]

### Final Answer
The time the car in the slow lane took to cover the same distance of 480 miles is:

\[
\boxed{16 \text{ hours}}
\]
