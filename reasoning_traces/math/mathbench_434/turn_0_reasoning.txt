==================================================

To solve the problem, I need more information about what "Sample math problem 434" entails. Since the problem isn't specified, I'll create a sample math problem and solve it step by step. Let's assume the problem is as follows:

**Problem:**
Solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 3x + 5 = 20 \).

**Solution:**

Step 1: Understand the equation.
The equation given is a linear equation in one variable, \( x \). The goal is to isolate \( x \) on one side of the equation to find its value.

Step 2: Isolate the term with \( x \).
To isolate the term with \( x \), subtract 5 from both sides of the equation to eliminate the constant term on the left side.

\[
3x + 5 - 5 = 20 - 5
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
3x = 15
\]

Step 3: Solve for \( x \).
Now, divide both sides of the equation by 3 to solve for \( x \).

\[
\frac{3x}{3} = \frac{15}{3}
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
x = 5
\]

Step 4: Verify the solution.
Substitute \( x = 5 \) back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies the equation.

Original equation: \( 3x + 5 = 20 \)

Substitute \( x = 5 \):

\[
3(5) + 5 = 20
\]

Calculate the left side:

\[
15 + 5 = 20
\]

Since both sides of the equation are equal, the solution \( x = 5 \) is verified.

**Final Answer:**
\( x = 5 \)
