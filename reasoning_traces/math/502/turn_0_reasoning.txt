To find the total number of gifts Cherrie bought, we will break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the number of gifts for the first group of friends:**
   - Cherrie has 2 friends who each want 5 gifts.
   - The total number of gifts for these 2 friends can be calculated as follows:
     \[
     \text{Gifts for first group} = 2 \text{ friends} \times 5 \text{ gifts per friend} = 10 \text{ gifts}
     \]

2. **Determine the number of gifts for the second group of friends:**
   - Cherrie has 3 friends who each want 2 gifts.
   - The total number of gifts for these 3 friends can be calculated as follows:
     \[
     \text{Gifts for second group} = 3 \text{ friends} \times 2 \text{ gifts per friend} = 6 \text{ gifts}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total number of gifts for all friends:**
   - Now, we add the gifts from both groups:
     \[
     \text{Total gifts for friends} = \text{Gifts for first group} + \text{Gifts for second group} = 10 \text{ gifts} + 6 \text{ gifts} = 16 \text{ gifts}
     \]

4. **Add the additional random gifts:**
   - Cherrie decides to buy 10 more random gifts.
   - We add these random gifts to the total number of gifts for her friends:
     \[
     \text{Total gifts} = \text{Total gifts for friends} + \text{Random gifts} = 16 \text{ gifts} + 10 \text{ gifts} = 26 \text{ gifts}
     \]

5. **Final answer:**
   - Therefore, the total number of gifts that Cherrie bought is:
     \[
     \boxed{26}
     \]
