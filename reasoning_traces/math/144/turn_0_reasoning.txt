To solve the problem, we need to determine how many packages of ground beef were delivered by the third butcher, given that the total weight of all the beef delivered is 100 pounds.

1. **Identify the weight of each package**: Each package of ground beef weighs 4 pounds.

2. **Calculate the total weight delivered by the first butcher**:
   - The first butcher delivered 10 packages.
   - Weight from the first butcher = Number of packages × Weight per package
   - Weight from the first butcher = 10 packages × 4 pounds/package = 40 pounds.

3. **Calculate the total weight delivered by the second butcher**:
   - The second butcher delivered 7 packages.
   - Weight from the second butcher = Number of packages × Weight per package
   - Weight from the second butcher = 7 packages × 4 pounds/package = 28 pounds.

4. **Calculate the total weight delivered by the first and second butchers**:
   - Total weight from the first and second butchers = Weight from the first butcher + Weight from the second butcher
   - Total weight from the first and second butchers = 40 pounds + 28 pounds = 68 pounds.

5. **Determine the total weight delivered by the third butcher**:
   - We know that the total weight of all deliveries is 100 pounds.
   - Let \( x \) be the total weight delivered by the third butcher.
   - Therefore, we can set up the equation:
     \[
     68 \text{ pounds} + x = 100 \text{ pounds}
     \]
   - Solving for \( x \):
     \[
     x = 100 \text{ pounds} - 68 \text{ pounds} = 32 \text{ pounds}.
     \]

6. **Calculate the number of packages delivered by the third butcher**:
   - Since each package weighs 4 pounds, we can find the number of packages delivered by the third butcher by dividing the total weight delivered by the third butcher by the weight of each package:
   - Number of packages from the third butcher = Total weight from the third butcher / Weight per package
   - Number of packages from the third butcher = 32 pounds / 4 pounds/package = 8 packages.

Thus, the third butcher delivered **8 packages** of ground beef.

Final answer: **8 packages**.
