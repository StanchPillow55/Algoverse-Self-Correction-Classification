To solve this problem, we need to determine how many packages of ground beef the third butcher delivered. We know the following:

1. Each package of ground beef weighs 4 pounds.
2. The first butcher delivered 10 packages.
3. The second butcher delivered 7 packages.
4. The total weight of all the ground beef delivered by the three butchers is 100 pounds.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

**Step 1: Calculate the total weight of the packages delivered by the first and second butchers.**

- The first butcher delivered 10 packages. Since each package weighs 4 pounds, the total weight from the first butcher is:
  \[
  10 \text{ packages} \times 4 \text{ pounds/package} = 40 \text{ pounds}
  \]

- The second butcher delivered 7 packages. Similarly, the total weight from the second butcher is:
  \[
  7 \text{ packages} \times 4 \text{ pounds/package} = 28 \text{ pounds}
  \]

**Step 2: Calculate the combined weight of the packages from the first and second butchers.**

- Add the weights from the first and second butchers:
  \[
  40 \text{ pounds} + 28 \text{ pounds} = 68 \text{ pounds}
  \]

**Step 3: Determine the weight of the packages delivered by the third butcher.**

- The total weight of all the ground beef is 100 pounds. Therefore, the weight of the packages delivered by the third butcher is:
  \[
  100 \text{ pounds} - 68 \text{ pounds} = 32 \text{ pounds}
  \]

**Step 4: Calculate the number of packages delivered by the third butcher.**

- Since each package weighs 4 pounds, the number of packages delivered by the third butcher is:
  \[
  \frac{32 \text{ pounds}}{4 \text{ pounds/package}} = 8 \text{ packages}
  \]

Thus, the third butcher delivered 8 packages.

**Final Answer:**
The third butcher delivered 8 packages.
