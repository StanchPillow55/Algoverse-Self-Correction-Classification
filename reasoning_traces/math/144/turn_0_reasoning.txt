To calculate Kim's weekly profit, we need to determine both his total income and total expenses.

1. **Determine the total number of clients:**
   - Kim currently has 3 clients.
   - He is in talks with 5 potential clients.
   - Therefore, the total number of clients he expects to have is:
     \[
     3 + 5 = 8 \text{ clients}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total expenses for cleaning supplies:**
   - Each client requires:
     - 2 bottles of bleach
     - 1 pack of cloths
   - The costs are:
     - Each bottle of bleach costs $2.
     - Each pack of cloths costs $5.

   **Calculate the cost for one client:**
   - Cost of bleach for one client:
     \[
     2 \text{ bottles} \times 2 \text{ dollars/bottle} = 4 \text{ dollars}
     \]
   - Cost of cloths for one client:
     \[
     1 \text{ pack} \times 5 \text{ dollars/pack} = 5 \text{ dollars}
     \]
   - Total cost for one client:
     \[
     4 \text{ dollars} + 5 \text{ dollars} = 9 \text{ dollars}
     \]

   **Calculate the total expenses for all clients:**
   - Total expenses for 8 clients:
     \[
     8 \text{ clients} \times 9 \text{ dollars/client} = 72 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Determine total income:**
   - Kim's total income each week is given as $92.

4. **Calculate profit:**
   - Profit is calculated as:
     \[
     \text{Profit} = \text{Total Income} - \text{Total Expenses}
     \]
   - Substituting the values we have:
     \[
     \text{Profit} = 92 \text{ dollars} - 72 \text{ dollars} = 20 \text{ dollars}
     \]

Thus, Kim will make a profit of **$20** each week.

Final answer:
\[
\boxed{20}
\]
