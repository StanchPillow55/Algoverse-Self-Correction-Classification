Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to determine the cost of both the red car and the blue car based on the information provided.

1. **Identify the price of the blue car**: 
   The problem states that the price of the blue car is $100.

2. **Calculate the price of the red car**: 
   The red car is 40% cheaper than the blue car. To find the price of the red car, we first need to calculate what 40% of the blue car's price is.

   \[
   \text{40% of the blue car's price} = 0.40 \times 100 = 40
   \]

3. **Determine the price of the red car**: 
   Since the red car is 40% cheaper than the blue car, we subtract the amount we just calculated from the blue car's price.

   \[
   \text{Price of the red car} = \text{Price of the blue car} - \text{40% of the blue car's price}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Price of the red car} = 100 - 40 = 60
   \]

4. **Summarize the costs**: 
   - The price of the blue car is $100.
   - The price of the red car is $60.

5. **Final answer**: 
   The cost of the blue car is $100, and the cost of the red car is $60.

Thus, the final answer is:
- Blue car: $100
- Red car: $60
