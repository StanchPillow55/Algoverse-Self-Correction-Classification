==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 389," we need to first understand what the problem is asking. However, the problem statement "Sample math problem 389" is not specific and does not provide any details about the mathematical operations or concepts involved. Therefore, I will assume that "389" refers to a number and create a sample math problem involving this number.

Let's create a problem involving the number 389 and solve it:

**Problem:**
Calculate the sum of the digits of the number 389 and determine if the sum is a prime number.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Identify the digits of the number 389:**
   - The number 389 consists of three digits: 3, 8, and 9.

2. **Calculate the sum of the digits:**
   - Sum = 3 + 8 + 9

3. **Perform the addition:**
   - First, add 3 and 8:
     \[
     3 + 8 = 11
     \]
   - Then, add the result to 9:
     \[
     11 + 9 = 20
     \]

4. **Determine if the sum (20) is a prime number:**
   - A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.
   - Check the divisibility of 20:
     - 20 is divisible by 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, and 20.
   - Since 20 has divisors other than 1 and itself, it is not a prime number.

**Conclusion:**
The sum of the digits of the number 389 is 20, and 20 is not a prime number.

**Final Answer:**
The sum of the digits of 389 is 20, which is not a prime number.
