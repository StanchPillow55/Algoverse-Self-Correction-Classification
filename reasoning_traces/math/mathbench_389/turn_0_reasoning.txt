==================================================

To solve the problem, I need to first understand what "Sample math problem 389" refers to. Since the problem statement is not provided, I'll assume this is a placeholder for a specific math problem. Without the actual content of "Sample math problem 389," I can't solve it directly. However, I can guide you on how to approach solving a typical math problem by outlining a general problem-solving strategy.

### General Problem-Solving Strategy:

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - Read the problem carefully.
   - Identify what is being asked.
   - Note down the given information and any constraints.

2. **Devise a Plan:**
   - Think about the mathematical concepts that might apply (e.g., algebra, geometry, calculus).
   - Consider similar problems you've solved before.
   - Decide on a strategy to tackle the problem (e.g., drawing a diagram, creating an equation).

3. **Carry Out the Plan:**
   - Execute your strategy step by step.
   - Perform calculations carefully.
   - Keep track of your work to ensure accuracy.

4. **Review/Check Your Work:**
   - Verify each step of your solution.
   - Check if your final answer makes sense in the context of the problem.
   - Re-calculate if necessary to confirm your results.

5. **State the Final Answer:**
   - Clearly write down the final answer.
   - Ensure it answers the question posed in the problem.

### Example Problem:

Let's create an example problem to illustrate this process:

**Problem:** Solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).

**Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We need to find the value of \( x \) that satisfies the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).

2. **Devise a Plan:**
   - We can solve this linear equation by isolating \( x \).

3. **Carry Out the Plan:**
   - Start by subtracting 3 from both sides of the equation:
     \[
     2x + 3 - 3 = 11 - 3
     \]
     \[
     2x = 8
     \]
   - Next, divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( x \):
     \[
     \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{8}{2}
     \]
     \[
     x = 4
     \]

4. **Review/Check Your Work:**
   - Substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation to verify:
     \[
     2(4) + 3 = 8 + 3 = 11
     \]
   - The left-hand side equals the right-hand side, confirming our solution is correct.

5. **State the Final Answer:**
   - The solution to the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \) is \( x = 4 \).
