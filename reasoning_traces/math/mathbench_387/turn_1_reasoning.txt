Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we first need to understand what "Sample math problem 387" refers to. Since the problem is not explicitly stated, I'll assume it's a placeholder for a typical math problem. Let's create a hypothetical math problem and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem 387:**

"Calculate the sum of the first 20 positive integers."

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   We need to find the sum of the first 20 positive integers. The sequence of the first 20 positive integers is: 1, 2, 3, ..., 20.

2. **Identify the Formula:**
   The sum of the first \( n \) positive integers can be calculated using the formula:
   \[
   S_n = \frac{n(n + 1)}{2}
   \]
   where \( S_n \) is the sum of the first \( n \) integers.

3. **Substitute the Values:**
   Here, \( n = 20 \). Substitute 20 into the formula:
   \[
   S_{20} = \frac{20(20 + 1)}{2}
   \]

4. **Calculate the Expression:**
   - First, calculate \( 20 + 1 \):
     \[
     20 + 1 = 21
     \]
   - Then, multiply 20 by 21:
     \[
     20 \times 21 = 420
     \]
   - Finally, divide 420 by 2:
     \[
     \frac{420}{2} = 210
     \]

5. **Conclusion:**
   The sum of the first 20 positive integers is 210.

**Final Answer:**
The sum of the first 20 positive integers is 210.
