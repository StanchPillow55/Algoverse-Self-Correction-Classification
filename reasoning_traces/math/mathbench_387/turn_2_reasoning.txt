==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 387," I need more context or details about what the problem entails. Since the problem is not specified, I will create a hypothetical math problem involving the number 387 and solve it step by step. Let's assume the problem is:

**Problem:**
Find the sum of the digits of the number 387, and then determine if this sum is a prime number.

**Step 1: Break down the number 387 into its digits.**
- The number 387 consists of the digits 3, 8, and 7.

**Step 2: Calculate the sum of the digits.**
- Sum = 3 + 8 + 7

**Step 3: Perform the addition.**
- 3 + 8 = 11
- 11 + 7 = 18

So, the sum of the digits of 387 is 18.

**Step 4: Determine if the sum (18) is a prime number.**
- A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.
- Check the divisibility of 18:
  - 18 is divisible by 2 (since it is even).
  - 18 is also divisible by 3 (since 1 + 8 = 9, and 9 is divisible by 3).

Since 18 has divisors other than 1 and itself, it is not a prime number.

**Final Answer:**
The sum of the digits of 387 is 18, and 18 is not a prime number.
