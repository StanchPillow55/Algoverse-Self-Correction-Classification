==================================================

To solve the problem, "Sample math problem 387," we need to first understand what the problem is asking. However, the problem statement "Sample math problem 387" is not specific, and it doesn't provide any details or context about what needs to be solved. 

To proceed, let's assume that "387" is a number involved in a mathematical problem, and I'll create a problem based on this number. Let's consider a few different types of problems that could involve the number 387.

### Problem 1: Basic Arithmetic
**Problem:** What is the sum of the digits of the number 387?

**Solution:**
1. Identify the digits of the number 387: 3, 8, and 7.
2. Add the digits together: 
   \[
   3 + 8 + 7 = 18
   \]

**Final Answer:** The sum of the digits of 387 is 18.

### Problem 2: Multiplication
**Problem:** What is 387 multiplied by 2?

**Solution:**
1. Multiply 387 by 2:
   \[
   387 \times 2 = 774
   \]

**Final Answer:** 387 multiplied by 2 is 774.

### Problem 3: Division
**Problem:** What is 387 divided by 3?

**Solution:**
1. Divide 387 by 3:
   \[
   387 \div 3 = 129
   \]

**Final Answer:** 387 divided by 3 is 129.

### Problem 4: Prime Factorization
**Problem:** What is the prime factorization of 387?

**Solution:**
1. Check if 387 is divisible by 2. It is not, since 387 is odd.
2. Check if 387 is divisible by 3. Sum of digits is 18, which is divisible by 3, so 387 is divisible by 3.
3. Divide 387 by 3:
   \[
   387 \div 3 = 129
   \]
4. Check if 129 is divisible by 3. Sum of digits is 12, which is divisible by 3, so 129 is divisible by 3.
5. Divide 129 by 3:
   \[
   129 \div 3 = 43
   \]
6. Check if 43 is a prime number. It is not divisible by 2, 3, or 5. Therefore, 43 is a prime number.

Thus, the prime factorization of 387 is:
\[
387 = 3^2 \times 43
\]

**Final Answer:** The prime factorization of 387 is \(3^2 \times 43\).

### Conclusion
Since the original problem statement was not specific, I created several potential problems involving the number 387 and solved them. If you have a specific problem related to 387, please provide more details, and I will be happy to solve it.
