Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 387," we need to first understand what the problem is asking. However, since "Sample math problem 387" is not a specific question, I'll create a hypothetical math problem with the number 387 and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**
Find the sum of the digits of the number 387 and determine if the sum is a prime number.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Identify the digits of the number 387:**
   - The number 387 consists of three digits: 3, 8, and 7.

2. **Calculate the sum of the digits:**
   - Add the digits together: \(3 + 8 + 7\).

   \[
   3 + 8 = 11
   \]

   \[
   11 + 7 = 18
   \]

   So, the sum of the digits is 18.

3. **Determine if the sum (18) is a prime number:**
   - A prime number is a number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.
   - Check the divisibility of 18:
     - 18 is divisible by 2 (since it is even).
     - 18 is also divisible by 3 (since \(1 + 8 = 9\), and 9 is divisible by 3).
   - Since 18 has divisors other than 1 and itself, it is not a prime number.

**Conclusion:**

The sum of the digits of the number 387 is 18, and 18 is not a prime number.

**Final Answer:**
The sum of the digits of 387 is 18, which is not a prime number.
