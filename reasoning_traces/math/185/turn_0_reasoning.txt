==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to determine how many apples Jenna picked based on the information given about her mother.

1. **Identify the number of apples picked by Jenna's mother**: 
   - According to the problem, Jenna's mother picked 20 apples.

2. **Determine how many apples Jenna picked**: 
   - The problem states that Jenna picked half as many apples as her mother. 
   - Since her mother picked 20 apples, we can calculate the number of apples Jenna picked as follows:
     \[
     \text{Jenna's apples} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Mother's apples}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Jenna's apples} = \frac{1}{2} \times 20 = 10
     \]

3. **Calculate the total number of apples picked by both Jenna and her mother**: 
   - Now that we know Jenna picked 10 apples and her mother picked 20 apples, we can find the total number of apples picked by adding the two amounts together:
     \[
     \text{Total apples} = \text{Jenna's apples} + \text{Mother's apples}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total apples} = 10 + 20 = 30
     \]

4. **Final answer**: 
   - Therefore, the total number of apples picked by Jenna and her mother is \( \boxed{30} \).
