==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to determine how many trouts Caleb's dad caught and then find out how many more trouts he caught compared to Caleb.

1. **Identify how many trouts Caleb caught:**
   - Caleb caught 2 trouts.

2. **Determine how many trouts Caleb's dad caught:**
   - According to the problem, Caleb's dad caught three times as much as Caleb.
   - Therefore, we calculate the number of trouts his dad caught as follows:
     \[
     \text{Dad's trouts} = 3 \times \text{Caleb's trouts} = 3 \times 2 = 6
     \]
   - So, Caleb's dad caught 6 trouts.

3. **Calculate how many more trouts Caleb's dad caught compared to Caleb:**
   - To find out how many more trouts his dad caught than Caleb, we subtract the number of trouts Caleb caught from the number of trouts his dad caught:
     \[
     \text{Difference} = \text{Dad's trouts} - \text{Caleb's trouts} = 6 - 2 = 4
     \]

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Caleb's dad caught 4 more trouts than Caleb.

Thus, the final answer is that Caleb's dad caught **4 more trouts** than Caleb.
