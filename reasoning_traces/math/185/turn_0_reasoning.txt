To solve this problem, we need to determine how many trouts Caleb's dad caught and then find out how many more trouts his dad caught compared to Caleb.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the number of trouts Caleb caught:**
   - Caleb caught 2 trouts.

2. **Determine how many trouts Caleb's dad caught:**
   - The problem states that Caleb's dad caught three times as many trouts as Caleb.
   - Since Caleb caught 2 trouts, we calculate the number of trouts his dad caught by multiplying the number of trouts Caleb caught by 3:
     \[
     \text{Number of trouts Caleb's dad caught} = 3 \times 2 = 6
     \]

3. **Calculate how many more trouts Caleb's dad caught compared to Caleb:**
   - To find out how many more trouts Caleb's dad caught than Caleb, we subtract the number of trouts Caleb caught from the number of trouts his dad caught:
     \[
     \text{Difference in number of trouts} = 6 - 2 = 4
     \]

Therefore, Caleb's dad caught 4 more trouts than Caleb.

**Final Answer:**
Caleb's dad caught 4 more trouts than Caleb.
