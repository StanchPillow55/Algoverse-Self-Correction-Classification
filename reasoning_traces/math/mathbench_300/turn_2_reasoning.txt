==================================================

It seems like the question is labeled as "Sample math problem 300," but there is no specific math problem provided. To assist you effectively, I will create a sample math problem and solve it step by step.

**Sample Math Problem:**
Calculate the area of a triangle with a base of 10 units and a height of 5 units.

**Step 1: Understand the formula for the area of a triangle.**
The formula for the area \( A \) of a triangle is given by:

\[
A = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height}
\]

**Step 2: Identify the values for the base and height.**
From the problem, we have:
- Base = 10 units
- Height = 5 units

**Step 3: Substitute the values into the formula.**
Now we will substitute the base and height into the area formula:

\[
A = \frac{1}{2} \times 10 \times 5
\]

**Step 4: Perform the multiplication.**
First, calculate \( 10 \times 5 \):

\[
10 \times 5 = 50
\]

Now substitute this back into the equation:

\[
A = \frac{1}{2} \times 50
\]

**Step 5: Divide by 2.**
Now, divide 50 by 2:

\[
A = 25
\]

**Final Answer:**
The area of the triangle is \( 25 \) square units.

If you have a specific math problem in mind, please provide the details, and I will be happy to solve it step by step!
