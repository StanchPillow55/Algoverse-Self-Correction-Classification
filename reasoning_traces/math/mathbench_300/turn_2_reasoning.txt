==================================================

Certainly! Let's tackle the problem step by step. However, it seems like the problem statement is incomplete or unclear as it only says "Sample math problem 300." I'll assume this is a placeholder and create a sample math problem involving the number 300. Let's solve the following problem:

**Problem:**
If 300 is divided by a number, the result is 25. What is the number?

**Step-by-step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We are given that when 300 is divided by a certain number, the result is 25.
   - We need to find this unknown number.

2. **Set Up the Equation:**
   - Let the unknown number be \( x \).
   - According to the problem, dividing 300 by \( x \) gives 25. This can be written as:
     \[
     \frac{300}{x} = 25
     \]

3. **Solve for \( x \):**
   - To find \( x \), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We can do this by multiplying both sides of the equation by \( x \) to get rid of the fraction:
     \[
     300 = 25x
     \]
   - Next, solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides by 25:
     \[
     x = \frac{300}{25}
     \]

4. **Perform the Division:**
   - Calculate \( \frac{300}{25} \):
     \[
     x = 12
     \]

5. **Verify the Solution:**
   - To ensure our solution is correct, we can substitute \( x = 12 \) back into the original condition:
     \[
     \frac{300}{12} = 25
     \]
   - Calculate \( \frac{300}{12} \):
     \[
     300 \div 12 = 25
     \]
   - Since both sides of the equation are equal, our solution is verified.

**Final Answer:**
The number is \( 12 \).
