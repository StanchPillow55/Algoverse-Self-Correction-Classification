==================================================

To solve the problem, we first need to understand what "Sample math problem 300" refers to. Since the problem statement is not specific, I'll assume that "Sample math problem 300" is a placeholder for a typical math problem. Without specific details, I'll create a sample math problem and solve it step by step.

Let's assume the problem is:

**Problem:**
Calculate the sum of all integers from 1 to 300.

**Solution:**

To find the sum of all integers from 1 to 300, we can use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series. The formula for the sum \( S \) of the first \( n \) natural numbers is:

\[
S = \frac{n}{2} \times (a + l)
\]

where:
- \( n \) is the number of terms,
- \( a \) is the first term,
- \( l \) is the last term.

In this case:
- The first term \( a = 1 \),
- The last term \( l = 300 \),
- The number of terms \( n = 300 \).

Substituting these values into the formula gives:

\[
S = \frac{300}{2} \times (1 + 300)
\]

First, calculate the sum inside the parentheses:

\[
1 + 300 = 301
\]

Next, calculate the number of terms divided by 2:

\[
\frac{300}{2} = 150
\]

Now, multiply these results together:

\[
S = 150 \times 301
\]

To perform the multiplication:

\[
150 \times 301 = 150 \times (300 + 1) = 150 \times 300 + 150 \times 1
\]

Calculate each part:

\[
150 \times 300 = 45000
\]
\[
150 \times 1 = 150
\]

Add these results together:

\[
45000 + 150 = 45150
\]

Therefore, the sum of all integers from 1 to 300 is \( 45150 \).

**Final Answer:**
The sum of all integers from 1 to 300 is 45150.
