==================================================

It seems that the question you provided is somewhat vague, as "Sample math problem 300" does not specify a particular math problem to solve. To assist you effectively, I will create a sample math problem and solve it step by step. 

Let's consider the following problem:

**Problem:**
A rectangle has a length that is 3 times its width. If the perimeter of the rectangle is 48 meters, what are the dimensions of the rectangle?

**Step 1: Define the variables.**
Let:
- \( w \) = width of the rectangle (in meters)
- \( l \) = length of the rectangle (in meters)

According to the problem, the length is 3 times the width:
\[ l = 3w \]

**Step 2: Write the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle.**
The perimeter \( P \) of a rectangle is given by the formula:
\[ P = 2l + 2w \]

**Step 3: Substitute the known perimeter and the expression for length into the perimeter formula.**
We know the perimeter is 48 meters:
\[ 48 = 2l + 2w \]

Now, substitute \( l = 3w \) into the perimeter equation:
\[ 48 = 2(3w) + 2w \]

**Step 4: Simplify the equation.**
\[ 48 = 6w + 2w \]
\[ 48 = 8w \]

**Step 5: Solve for \( w \).**
To find \( w \), divide both sides by 8:
\[ w = \frac{48}{8} \]
\[ w = 6 \text{ meters} \]

**Step 6: Find the length \( l \).**
Now that we have the width, we can find the length using the relationship \( l = 3w \):
\[ l = 3(6) \]
\[ l = 18 \text{ meters} \]

**Step 7: State the final answer.**
The dimensions of the rectangle are:
- Width: 6 meters
- Length: 18 meters

Thus, the final answer is:
**Width: 6 meters, Length: 18 meters.**
