==================================================

To solve the sample math problem "300," we need to first understand what the problem is asking. Since the problem statement is incomplete, I'll assume that we are tasked with performing some basic operations or analysis on the number 300. Let's explore a few possibilities:

### 1. Prime Factorization of 300

Prime factorization involves breaking down a number into its prime number components. Let's find the prime factors of 300.

1. **Divide by 2 (the smallest prime number):**
   \[
   300 \div 2 = 150
   \]
   So, 2 is a prime factor.

2. **Divide 150 by 2 again:**
   \[
   150 \div 2 = 75
   \]
   So, another 2 is a prime factor.

3. **Divide 75 by 3 (the next smallest prime number):**
   \[
   75 \div 3 = 25
   \]
   So, 3 is a prime factor.

4. **Divide 25 by 5 (the next smallest prime number):**
   \[
   25 \div 5 = 5
   \]
   So, 5 is a prime factor.

5. **Divide 5 by 5:**
   \[
   5 \div 5 = 1
   \]
   So, another 5 is a prime factor.

The prime factorization of 300 is:
\[
300 = 2^2 \times 3^1 \times 5^2
\]

### 2. Sum of the Digits of 300

Another simple operation could be to find the sum of the digits of 300.

- The digits of 300 are 3, 0, and 0.
- Sum of the digits: \(3 + 0 + 0 = 3\).

### 3. Divisors of 300

Let's find all the divisors of 300. A divisor is a number that divides 300 without leaving a remainder.

Using the prime factorization \(300 = 2^2 \times 3^1 \times 5^2\), we can find the divisors by considering all combinations of these factors.

- \(2^0, 2^1, 2^2\)
- \(3^0, 3^1\)
- \(5^0, 5^1, 5^2\)

The total number of divisors is given by multiplying the number of choices for each prime factor (including the zero power):

\[
(2+1)(1+1)(2+1) = 3 \times 2 \times 3 = 18
\]

The divisors are:
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10, 12, 15, 20, 25, 30, 50, 60, 75, 100, 150, 300.

### Conclusion

Since the problem statement was not specific, I explored several mathematical properties of the number 300. Here are the results:

- **Prime Factorization:** \(300 = 2^2 \times 3^1 \times 5^2\)
- **Sum of Digits:** 3
- **Divisors:** 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10, 12, 15, 20, 25, 30, 50, 60, 75, 100, 150, 300

If you have a specific operation or question in mind regarding the number 300, please provide more details!
