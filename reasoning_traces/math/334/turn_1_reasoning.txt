Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of the ingredients required to make 1 quart of strawberry ice cream and 1 quart of raspberry ice cream.

**Step 1: Determine the ingredients needed for each type of ice cream.**

- For 1 quart of strawberry ice cream:
  - 4 cups of strawberries
  - 2 cups of heavy cream

- For 1 quart of raspberry ice cream:
  - 4 cups of raspberries
  - 2 cups of heavy cream

**Step 2: Calculate the total amount of each ingredient needed.**

- Total strawberries needed: 4 cups
- Total raspberries needed: 4 cups
- Total heavy cream needed: 2 cups (for strawberry) + 2 cups (for raspberry) = 4 cups

**Step 3: Determine the cost of each ingredient.**

- Strawberries: The strawberries are sold in 2 cup packages for $3.00 each. Since Martha needs 4 cups, she will need 2 packages.
  - Cost for strawberries = 2 packages × $3.00/package = $6.00

- Raspberries: The raspberries are sold in 2 cup packages for $5.00 each. Since Martha needs 4 cups, she will need 2 packages.
  - Cost for raspberries = 2 packages × $5.00/package = $10.00

- Heavy cream: The heavy cream is sold in a 4 cup container for $4.00. Since Martha needs 4 cups, she will need 1 container.
  - Cost for heavy cream = 1 container × $4.00/container = $4.00

**Step 4: Calculate the total cost.**

Total cost = Cost of strawberries + Cost of raspberries + Cost of heavy cream  
Total cost = $6.00 (strawberries) + $10.00 (raspberries) + $4.00 (heavy cream)  
Total cost = $20.00

**Final Answer:**

The total cost for Martha to make 1 quart of strawberry ice cream and 1 quart of raspberry ice cream is $20.00.
