Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To determine the total cost for Martha to make 1 quart of strawberry ice cream and 1 quart of raspberry ice cream, we will break down the ingredients needed for each type of ice cream and their respective costs.

### Ingredients Needed
For 1 quart of ice cream (both strawberry and raspberry), Martha needs:
- 4 cups of berries (2 cups for each quart)
- 2 cups of heavy cream

### Cost of Ingredients
1. **Strawberries**:
   - Martha needs 4 cups of strawberries for 1 quart of strawberry ice cream.
   - Since strawberries are sold in 2 cup packages, she will need:
     \[
     \text{Number of packages} = \frac{4 \text{ cups}}{2 \text{ cups/package}} = 2 \text{ packages}
     \]
   - The cost for strawberries is:
     \[
     \text{Cost of strawberries} = 2 \text{ packages} \times 3.00 \text{ dollars/package} = 6.00 \text{ dollars}
     \]

2. **Raspberries**:
   - Martha needs 4 cups of raspberries for 1 quart of raspberry ice cream.
   - Similarly, she will need:
     \[
     \text{Number of packages} = \frac{4 \text{ cups}}{2 \text{ cups/package}} = 2 \text{ packages}
     \]
   - The cost for raspberries is:
     \[
     \text{Cost of raspberries} = 2 \text{ packages} \times 5.00 \text{ dollars/package} = 10.00 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Heavy Cream**:
   - For both quarts of ice cream, Martha needs a total of:
     \[
     \text{Total heavy cream needed} = 2 \text{ quarts} \times 2 \text{ cups/quart} = 4 \text{ cups}
     \]
   - Heavy cream is sold in 4 cup containers, so she needs:
     \[
     \text{Number of containers} = \frac{4 \text{ cups}}{4 \text{ cups/container}} = 1 \text{ container}
     \]
   - The cost for heavy cream is:
     \[
     \text{Cost of heavy cream} = 1 \text{ container} \times 4.00 \text{ dollars/container} = 4.00 \text{ dollars}
     \]

### Total Cost Calculation
Now, we can sum up the costs of all the ingredients:
\[
\text{Total cost} = \text{Cost of strawberries} + \text{Cost of raspberries} + \text{Cost of heavy cream}
\]
\[
\text{Total cost} = 6.00 \text{ dollars} + 10.00 \text{ dollars} + 4.00 \text{ dollars} = 20.00 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Final Answer
Martha will spend a total of **$20.00** to make 1 quart of strawberry ice cream and 1 quart of raspberry ice cream.
