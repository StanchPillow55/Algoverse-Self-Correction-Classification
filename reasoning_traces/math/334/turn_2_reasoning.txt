Question ID: 334
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To determine the total cost for Martha to make 1 quart of strawberry ice cream and 1 quart of raspberry ice cream, we need to calculate the cost of the ingredients for each type of ice cream separately and then sum them up.

### Step 1: Calculate the ingredients needed for each ice cream

**For 1 quart of strawberry ice cream:**
- Berries needed: 4 cups of strawberries
- Heavy cream needed: 2 cups

**For 1 quart of raspberry ice cream:**
- Berries needed: 4 cups of raspberries
- Heavy cream needed: 2 cups

### Step 2: Calculate the total ingredients needed

**Total for both ice creams:**
- Total berries needed: 4 cups (strawberries) + 4 cups (raspberries) = 8 cups of berries
- Total heavy cream needed: 2 cups (strawberries) + 2 cups (raspberries) = 4 cups of heavy cream

### Step 3: Determine the cost of the berries

**Strawberries:**
- Each 2 cup package costs $3.00.
- To get 4 cups, Martha needs 2 packages of strawberries.
- Cost for strawberries: 2 packages × $3.00/package = $6.00

**Raspberries:**
- Each 2 cup package costs $5.00.
- To get 4 cups, Martha needs 2 packages of raspberries.
- Cost for raspberries: 2 packages × $5.00/package = $10.00

### Step 4: Calculate the total cost for berries

Total cost for berries = Cost of strawberries + Cost of raspberries
- Total cost for berries = $6.00 + $10.00 = $16.00

### Step 5: Determine the cost of the heavy cream

- Heavy cream is sold for $4.00 for a 4 cup container.
- Since Martha needs exactly 4 cups of heavy cream, she will buy 1 container.

Cost for heavy cream = $4.00

### Step 6: Calculate the total cost for making the ice cream

Total cost = Total cost for berries + Cost for heavy cream
- Total cost = $16.00 + $4.00 = $20.00

### Final Answer

Martha will spend a total of **$20.00** to make 1 quart of strawberry ice cream and 1 quart of raspberry ice cream.
