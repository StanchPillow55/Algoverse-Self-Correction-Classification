To determine the total cost for Martha to make 1 quart of strawberry ice cream and 1 quart of raspberry ice cream, we need to calculate the cost of the berries and the heavy cream separately for each type of ice cream.

### Step 1: Calculate the cost of strawberries for 1 quart of strawberry ice cream.

- **Berries needed for 1 quart of strawberry ice cream:** 4 cups
- **Package size of strawberries:** 2 cups
- **Cost per package of strawberries:** $3.00

To find out how many packages of strawberries are needed:
\[ \text{Packages needed} = \frac{4 \text{ cups}}{2 \text{ cups/package}} = 2 \text{ packages} \]

The cost for the strawberries:
\[ \text{Cost for strawberries} = 2 \text{ packages} \times \$3.00/\text{package} = \$6.00 \]

### Step 2: Calculate the cost of raspberries for 1 quart of raspberry ice cream.

- **Berries needed for 1 quart of raspberry ice cream:** 4 cups
- **Package size of raspberries:** 2 cups
- **Cost per package of raspberries:** $5.00

To find out how many packages of raspberries are needed:
\[ \text{Packages needed} = \frac{4 \text{ cups}}{2 \text{ cups/package}} = 2 \text{ packages} \]

The cost for the raspberries:
\[ \text{Cost for raspberries} = 2 \text{ packages} \times \$5.00/\text{package} = \$10.00 \]

### Step 3: Calculate the cost of heavy cream for both ice creams.

- **Heavy cream needed for 1 quart of ice cream:** 2 cups
- **Total heavy cream needed for 2 quarts (1 quart of each ice cream):** 2 cups + 2 cups = 4 cups
- **Cost for a 4 cup container of heavy cream:** $4.00

Since 4 cups of heavy cream are needed and it matches exactly with the container size:
\[ \text{Cost for heavy cream} = \$4.00 \]

### Step 4: Calculate the total cost.

Add the costs for strawberries, raspberries, and heavy cream:
\[ \text{Total cost} = \$6.00 \text{ (strawberries)} + \$10.00 \text{ (raspberries)} + \$4.00 \text{ (heavy cream)} \]

\[ \text{Total cost} = \$20.00 \]

Thus, the total cost for Martha to make 1 quart of strawberry ice cream and 1 quart of raspberry ice cream is \(\boxed{\$20.00}\).
