To determine the total cost for Martha to make 1 quart of strawberry ice cream and 1 quart of raspberry ice cream, we will break down the ingredients needed for each type of ice cream and their respective costs.

### Step 1: Calculate the ingredients needed for each type of ice cream.

**For 1 quart of strawberry ice cream:**
- Berries: 4 cups of strawberries
- Heavy cream: 2 cups

**For 1 quart of raspberry ice cream:**
- Berries: 4 cups of raspberries
- Heavy cream: 2 cups

### Step 2: Total ingredients needed for both types of ice cream.

**Total ingredients:**
- Strawberries: 4 cups
- Raspberries: 4 cups
- Heavy cream: 2 cups + 2 cups = 4 cups

### Step 3: Determine the cost of strawberries and raspberries.

**Strawberries:**
- Martha needs 4 cups of strawberries.
- Since strawberries are sold in 2 cup packages, she needs:
  \[
  \text{Number of packages of strawberries} = \frac{4 \text{ cups}}{2 \text{ cups/package}} = 2 \text{ packages}
  \]
- The cost for strawberries is:
  \[
  \text{Cost of strawberries} = 2 \text{ packages} \times 3.00 \text{ dollars/package} = 6.00 \text{ dollars}
  \]

**Raspberries:**
- Martha needs 4 cups of raspberries.
- Since raspberries are also sold in 2 cup packages, she needs:
  \[
  \text{Number of packages of raspberries} = \frac{4 \text{ cups}}{2 \text{ cups/package}} = 2 \text{ packages}
  \]
- The cost for raspberries is:
  \[
  \text{Cost of raspberries} = 2 \text{ packages} \times 5.00 \text{ dollars/package} = 10.00 \text{ dollars}
  \]

### Step 4: Determine the cost of heavy cream.

- Martha needs a total of 4 cups of heavy cream.
- Heavy cream is sold in 4 cup containers, so she needs:
  \[
  \text{Number of containers of heavy cream} = \frac{4 \text{ cups}}{4 \text{ cups/container}} = 1 \text{ container}
  \]
- The cost for heavy cream is:
  \[
  \text{Cost of heavy cream} = 1 \text{ container} \times 4.00 \text{ dollars/container} = 4.00 \text{ dollars}
  \]

### Step 5: Calculate the total cost.

Now, we will sum up the costs of all the ingredients:
\[
\text{Total cost} = \text{Cost of strawberries} + \text{Cost of raspberries} + \text{Cost of heavy cream}
\]
\[
\text{Total cost} = 6.00 \text{ dollars} + 10.00 \text{ dollars} + 4.00 \text{ dollars} = 20.00 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Final Answer:
Martha will spend a total of **$20.00** to make 1 quart of strawberry ice cream and 1 quart of raspberry ice cream.
