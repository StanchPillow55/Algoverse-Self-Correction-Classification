Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To determine the total price of the property, we need to calculate the cost of both the house and the barn based on their respective square footage and the price per square foot.

1. **Identify the price per square foot**: 
   The price of the home is given as $98 per square foot.

2. **Calculate the cost of the house**:
   The house has a total area of 2,400 square feet. To find the total cost of the house, we multiply the area of the house by the price per square foot:
   \[
   \text{Cost of the house} = \text{Area of the house} \times \text{Price per square foot}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Cost of the house} = 2,400 \, \text{sq ft} \times 98 \, \text{USD/sq ft}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Cost of the house} = 235,200 \, \text{USD}
   \]

3. **Calculate the cost of the barn**:
   The barn has a total area of 1,000 square feet. Similarly, we calculate the total cost of the barn:
   \[
   \text{Cost of the barn} = \text{Area of the barn} \times \text{Price per square foot}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Cost of the barn} = 1,000 \, \text{sq ft} \times 98 \, \text{USD/sq ft}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Cost of the barn} = 98,000 \, \text{USD}
   \]

4. **Calculate the total cost of the property**:
   Now, we add the cost of the house and the cost of the barn to find the total cost of the property:
   \[
   \text{Total cost of the property} = \text{Cost of the house} + \text{Cost of the barn}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total cost of the property} = 235,200 \, \text{USD} + 98,000 \, \text{USD}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total cost of the property} = 333,200 \, \text{USD}
   \]

Thus, the final answer is that the total cost of the property is **$333,200**.
