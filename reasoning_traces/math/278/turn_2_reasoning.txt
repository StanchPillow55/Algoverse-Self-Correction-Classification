==================================================

To determine the total price of the property, we need to calculate the cost of both the house and the barn separately, and then add them together. The price per square foot for both the house and the barn is given as $98.

**Step 1: Calculate the cost of the house.**

- The house is 2,400 square feet.
- The price per square foot is $98.

\[ \text{Cost of the house} = \text{Area of the house} \times \text{Price per square foot} \]

\[ \text{Cost of the house} = 2,400 \, \text{sq ft} \times 98 \, \text{\$/sq ft} \]

\[ \text{Cost of the house} = 235,200 \, \text{\$} \]

**Step 2: Calculate the cost of the barn.**

- The barn is 1,000 square feet.
- The price per square foot is $98.

\[ \text{Cost of the barn} = \text{Area of the barn} \times \text{Price per square foot} \]

\[ \text{Cost of the barn} = 1,000 \, \text{sq ft} \times 98 \, \text{\$/sq ft} \]

\[ \text{Cost of the barn} = 98,000 \, \text{\$} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the total cost of the property.**

- Add the cost of the house and the cost of the barn.

\[ \text{Total cost of the property} = \text{Cost of the house} + \text{Cost of the barn} \]

\[ \text{Total cost of the property} = 235,200 \, \text{\$} + 98,000 \, \text{\$} \]

\[ \text{Total cost of the property} = 333,200 \, \text{\$} \]

Therefore, the total cost of the property is **$333,200**.
