To determine the total price of the property, we need to calculate the cost of both the house and the barn separately, and then add these two amounts together.

**Step 1: Calculate the cost of the house.**

The house is 2,400 square feet, and the price per square foot is $98. To find the total cost of the house, we multiply the square footage of the house by the price per square foot:

\[
\text{Cost of the house} = 2,400 \, \text{sq ft} \times 98 \, \text{dollars/sq ft}
\]

\[
\text{Cost of the house} = 235,200 \, \text{dollars}
\]

**Step 2: Calculate the cost of the barn.**

The barn is 1,000 square feet, and the price per square foot is the same, $98. To find the total cost of the barn, we multiply the square footage of the barn by the price per square foot:

\[
\text{Cost of the barn} = 1,000 \, \text{sq ft} \times 98 \, \text{dollars/sq ft}
\]

\[
\text{Cost of the barn} = 98,000 \, \text{dollars}
\]

**Step 3: Calculate the total cost of the property.**

Now, we add the cost of the house and the cost of the barn to find the total cost of the property:

\[
\text{Total cost of the property} = \text{Cost of the house} + \text{Cost of the barn}
\]

\[
\text{Total cost of the property} = 235,200 \, \text{dollars} + 98,000 \, \text{dollars}
\]

\[
\text{Total cost of the property} = 333,200 \, \text{dollars}
\]

Therefore, the total cost of the property is \(\boxed{333,200}\) dollars.
