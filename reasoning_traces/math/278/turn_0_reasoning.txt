To find the total price of the property, we need to calculate the cost of both the house and the barn based on their respective square footage and the price per square foot.

1. **Calculate the cost of the house:**
   - The house is 2,400 square feet.
   - The price per square foot is $98.
   - To find the total cost of the house, we multiply the square footage of the house by the price per square foot:

   \[
   \text{Cost of the house} = \text{Square footage of the house} \times \text{Price per square foot}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Cost of the house} = 2,400 \, \text{sq ft} \times 98 \, \text{USD/sq ft}
   \]

   Now, performing the multiplication:

   \[
   \text{Cost of the house} = 2,400 \times 98
   \]

   Breaking it down:

   \[
   2,400 \times 98 = 2,400 \times (100 - 2) = 2,400 \times 100 - 2,400 \times 2
   \]
   \[
   = 240,000 - 4,800 = 235,200
   \]

   So, the cost of the house is **$235,200**.

2. **Calculate the cost of the barn:**
   - The barn is 1,000 square feet.
   - The price per square foot is still $98.
   - To find the total cost of the barn, we multiply the square footage of the barn by the price per square foot:

   \[
   \text{Cost of the barn} = \text{Square footage of the barn} \times \text{Price per square foot}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Cost of the barn} = 1,000 \, \text{sq ft} \times 98 \, \text{USD/sq ft}
   \]

   Performing the multiplication:

   \[
   \text{Cost of the barn} = 1,000 \times 98 = 98,000
   \]

   So, the cost of the barn is **$98,000**.

3. **Calculate the total cost of the property:**
   - Now, we add the cost of the house and the cost of the barn to find the total property cost:

   \[
   \text{Total cost of the property} = \text{Cost of the house} + \text{Cost of the barn}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total cost of the property} = 235,200 + 98,000
   \]

   Performing the addition:

   \[
   \text{Total cost of the property} = 333,200
   \]

Thus, the total cost of the property is **$333,200**. 

Final answer: **$333,200**.
