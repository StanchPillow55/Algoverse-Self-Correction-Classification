==================================================

To determine the total price of the property, we need to calculate the cost of both the house and the barn separately and then sum these amounts.

### Step 1: Calculate the cost of the house
The house is 2,400 square feet, and the price per square foot is $98.

\[
\text{Cost of the house} = \text{Area of the house} \times \text{Price per square foot}
\]

\[
\text{Cost of the house} = 2,400 \, \text{sq ft} \times 98 \, \text{dollars/sq ft}
\]

\[
\text{Cost of the house} = 235,200 \, \text{dollars}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the cost of the barn
The barn is 1,000 square feet, and the price per square foot is also $98.

\[
\text{Cost of the barn} = \text{Area of the barn} \times \text{Price per square foot}
\]

\[
\text{Cost of the barn} = 1,000 \, \text{sq ft} \times 98 \, \text{dollars/sq ft}
\]

\[
\text{Cost of the barn} = 98,000 \, \text{dollars}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the total cost of the property
To find the total cost of the property, we add the cost of the house and the cost of the barn.

\[
\text{Total cost of the property} = \text{Cost of the house} + \text{Cost of the barn}
\]

\[
\text{Total cost of the property} = 235,200 \, \text{dollars} + 98,000 \, \text{dollars}
\]

\[
\text{Total cost of the property} = 333,200 \, \text{dollars}
\]

### Final Answer
The total cost of the property, including both the house and the barn, is **$333,200**.
