==================================================

To determine the total price of the property, we need to calculate the price of both the house and the barn based on their respective square footage and the price per square foot.

### Step 1: Calculate the price of the house

1. **Identify the square footage of the house**: 
   - The house is 2,400 sq ft.

2. **Identify the price per square foot**: 
   - The price is $98 per sq ft.

3. **Calculate the total price of the house**:
   \[
   \text{Price of the house} = \text{Square footage of the house} \times \text{Price per square foot}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Price of the house} = 2,400 \, \text{sq ft} \times 98 \, \text{dollars/sq ft}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Price of the house} = 235,200 \, \text{dollars}
   \]

### Step 2: Calculate the price of the barn

1. **Identify the square footage of the barn**: 
   - The barn is 1,000 sq ft.

2. **Use the same price per square foot**: 
   - The price is still $98 per sq ft.

3. **Calculate the total price of the barn**:
   \[
   \text{Price of the barn} = \text{Square footage of the barn} \times \text{Price per square foot}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Price of the barn} = 1,000 \, \text{sq ft} \times 98 \, \text{dollars/sq ft}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Price of the barn} = 98,000 \, \text{dollars}
   \]

### Step 3: Calculate the total price of the property

1. **Add the price of the house and the barn**:
   \[
   \text{Total price of the property} = \text{Price of the house} + \text{Price of the barn}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total price of the property} = 235,200 \, \text{dollars} + 98,000 \, \text{dollars}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total price of the property} = 333,200 \, \text{dollars}
   \]

### Final Answer

The total price of the property, which includes both the house and the barn, is **$333,200**.
