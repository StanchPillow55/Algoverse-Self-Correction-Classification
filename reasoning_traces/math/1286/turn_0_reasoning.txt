==================================================

To find out how much money James has in total, we need to calculate the value of each type of coin he found and then sum them up.

1. **Identify the coins and their values:**
   - A quarter is worth 25 cents.
   - A nickel is worth 5 cents.
   - A dime is worth 10 cents.

2. **Calculate the total value of each type of coin:**
   - **For the quarter:**
     - James found 1 quarter.
     - Value of quarters = 1 quarter × 25 cents/quarter = 25 cents.

   - **For the nickels:**
     - James found 2 nickels.
     - Value of nickels = 2 nickels × 5 cents/nickel = 10 cents.

   - **For the dimes:**
     - James found 7 dimes.
     - Value of dimes = 7 dimes × 10 cents/dime = 70 cents.

3. **Add the values of all the coins together:**
   - Total value = Value of quarters + Value of nickels + Value of dimes
   - Total value = 25 cents + 10 cents + 70 cents

4. **Perform the addition:**
   - 25 + 10 = 35
   - 35 + 70 = 105

Therefore, the total amount of money James has is **105 cents**.

Final answer: **105 cents**.
