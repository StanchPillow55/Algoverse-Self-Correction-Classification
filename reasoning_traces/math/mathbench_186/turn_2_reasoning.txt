Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we first need to understand what "Sample math problem 186" refers to. Since the problem is not explicitly provided, I'll assume a generic math problem and solve it step by step. Let's consider a typical algebra problem:

**Problem:** Solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 3x + 5 = 20 \).

**Step 1: Understand the Equation**

The equation given is \( 3x + 5 = 20 \). This is a linear equation in one variable, \( x \). Our goal is to isolate \( x \) on one side of the equation to find its value.

**Step 2: Isolate the Variable**

To isolate \( x \), we need to perform operations that will get \( x \) by itself on one side of the equation.

1. **Subtract 5 from both sides:**  
   \[
   3x + 5 - 5 = 20 - 5
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   3x = 15
   \]

2. **Divide both sides by 3:**  
   \[
   \frac{3x}{3} = \frac{15}{3}
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   x = 5
   \]

**Step 3: Verify the Solution**

To ensure our solution is correct, we substitute \( x = 5 \) back into the original equation:

\[
3(5) + 5 = 20
\]

Simplifying the left side:
\[
15 + 5 = 20
\]

Since both sides of the equation are equal, our solution \( x = 5 \) is verified.

**Final Answer:**

The solution to the equation \( 3x + 5 = 20 \) is \( x = 5 \).
