==================================================

To solve the problem, we first need to understand what "Sample math problem 186" refers to. Since the problem itself isn't provided, I'll create a hypothetical math problem and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem 186:**

*Calculate the sum of the first 20 positive even numbers.*

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Identify the Sequence:**
   - The sequence of the first 20 positive even numbers is: 2, 4, 6, 8, ..., 40.

2. **Recognize the Pattern:**
   - This is an arithmetic sequence where the first term \( a_1 = 2 \) and the common difference \( d = 2 \).

3. **Use the Formula for the Sum of an Arithmetic Sequence:**
   - The formula for the sum \( S_n \) of the first \( n \) terms of an arithmetic sequence is:
     \[
     S_n = \frac{n}{2} \times (a_1 + a_n)
     \]
   - Here, \( n = 20 \), \( a_1 = 2 \), and the last term \( a_n = 40 \).

4. **Calculate the Sum:**
   - Substitute the known values into the formula:
     \[
     S_{20} = \frac{20}{2} \times (2 + 40)
     \]
   - Simplify the expression:
     \[
     S_{20} = 10 \times 42
     \]
     \[
     S_{20} = 420
     \]

5. **Verify the Calculation:**
   - As a check, let's calculate the sum using another method, such as listing and adding:
     - Pair the numbers: (2 + 40), (4 + 38), (6 + 36), ..., (20 + 22).
     - Each pair sums to 42, and there are 10 such pairs.
     - Total sum = 10 pairs Ã— 42 = 420.

**Final Answer:**

The sum of the first 20 positive even numbers is 420.
