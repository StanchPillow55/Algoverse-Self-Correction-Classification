==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 290" refers to. Since the problem statement does not provide specific details or context, I'll assume that "Sample reasoning question 290" is a placeholder for a typical math problem. Without specific details, I'll create a hypothetical math problem and solve it step by step.

Let's assume "Sample reasoning question 290" is a problem involving algebra, specifically solving a linear equation. Here's a hypothetical problem:

**Problem:**
Solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 3x + 5 = 20 \).

**Step-by-step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Equation:**
   The given equation is \( 3x + 5 = 20 \). This is a linear equation in one variable, \( x \).

2. **Isolate the Variable:**
   To solve for \( x \), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We start by eliminating the constant term on the left side.

   \[
   3x + 5 = 20
   \]

   Subtract 5 from both sides to get:

   \[
   3x + 5 - 5 = 20 - 5
   \]

   Simplifying both sides gives:

   \[
   3x = 15
   \]

3. **Solve for \( x \):**
   Now, divide both sides by 3 to solve for \( x \).

   \[
   \frac{3x}{3} = \frac{15}{3}
   \]

   Simplifying both sides gives:

   \[
   x = 5
   \]

4. **Verify the Solution:**
   To ensure our solution is correct, substitute \( x = 5 \) back into the original equation:

   \[
   3(5) + 5 = 20
   \]

   Simplifying the left side:

   \[
   15 + 5 = 20
   \]

   \[
   20 = 20
   \]

   The left side equals the right side, confirming that our solution is correct.

**Final Answer:**
The solution to the equation \( 3x + 5 = 20 \) is \( x = 5 \).

This is a complete solution to the hypothetical problem based on the placeholder "Sample reasoning question 290." If you have a specific problem or context in mind, please provide more details, and I can tailor the solution accordingly.
