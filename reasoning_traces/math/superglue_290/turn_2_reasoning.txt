==================================================

To solve the problem effectively, let's first clarify the question. The question is labeled as "Sample reasoning question 290," but it doesn't provide specific details or numbers to work with. Therefore, I'll create a hypothetical math problem to demonstrate the process of solving it step by step.

Let's assume the problem is as follows:

**Problem:**
A store sells two types of candies: chocolate and gummy bears. The chocolate costs $2 per piece, and the gummy bears cost $1.50 per piece. If a customer buys a total of 20 pieces of candy and spends $32, how many pieces of each type of candy did they buy?

**Solution:**

To solve this problem, we need to set up a system of equations based on the information given.

1. **Define the Variables:**
   - Let \( x \) be the number of chocolate pieces.
   - Let \( y \) be the number of gummy bear pieces.

2. **Set Up the Equations:**
   - The first equation comes from the total number of candies:
     \[
     x + y = 20
     \]
   - The second equation comes from the total cost:
     \[
     2x + 1.5y = 32
     \]

3. **Solve the System of Equations:**

   We can use the substitution or elimination method. Here, we'll use substitution.

   - From the first equation, solve for \( y \):
     \[
     y = 20 - x
     \]

   - Substitute \( y = 20 - x \) into the second equation:
     \[
     2x + 1.5(20 - x) = 32
     \]

   - Simplify and solve for \( x \):
     \[
     2x + 30 - 1.5x = 32
     \]
     \[
     0.5x + 30 = 32
     \]
     \[
     0.5x = 2
     \]
     \[
     x = 4
     \]

   - Substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the equation for \( y \):
     \[
     y = 20 - 4 = 16
     \]

4. **Verify the Solution:**

   - Check the total number of candies:
     \[
     x + y = 4 + 16 = 20
     \]
   - Check the total cost:
     \[
     2x + 1.5y = 2(4) + 1.5(16) = 8 + 24 = 32
     \]

Both conditions are satisfied, confirming our solution is correct.

**Final Answer:**
The customer bought 4 pieces of chocolate and 16 pieces of gummy bears.
