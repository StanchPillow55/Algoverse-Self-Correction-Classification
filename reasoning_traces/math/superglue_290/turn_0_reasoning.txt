To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 290" refers to. Since the question itself is not provided, I will assume it is a placeholder for a typical math problem. Let's create a sample math problem and solve it step by step.

**Sample Problem:**

A company sells two types of products: Product A and Product B. The company sells Product A for $50 each and Product B for $30 each. In one week, the company sold a total of 100 products and made $4000 in revenue. How many of each product did the company sell?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( x \) be the number of Product A sold.
   - Let \( y \) be the number of Product B sold.

2. **Set Up Equations:**
   - We know the total number of products sold is 100. Therefore, the first equation is:
     \[
     x + y = 100
     \]
   - We also know the total revenue is $4000. The revenue from Product A is \( 50x \) and from Product B is \( 30y \). Therefore, the second equation is:
     \[
     50x + 30y = 4000
     \]

3. **Solve the System of Equations:**
   - We have the system:
     \[
     \begin{align*}
     x + y &= 100 \\
     50x + 30y &= 4000
     \end{align*}
     \]

   - From the first equation, express \( y \) in terms of \( x \):
     \[
     y = 100 - x
     \]

   - Substitute \( y = 100 - x \) into the second equation:
     \[
     50x + 30(100 - x) = 4000
     \]

   - Simplify and solve for \( x \):
     \[
     50x + 3000 - 30x = 4000
     \]
     \[
     20x + 3000 = 4000
     \]
     \[
     20x = 1000
     \]
     \[
     x = 50
     \]

   - Substitute \( x = 50 \) back into the equation for \( y \):
     \[
     y = 100 - 50 = 50
     \]

4. **Verify the Solution:**
   - Check the total number of products:
     \[
     x + y = 50 + 50 = 100
     \]
   - Check the total revenue:
     \[
     50(50) + 30(50) = 2500 + 1500 = 4000
     \]

Both conditions are satisfied, confirming our solution is correct.

**Final Answer:**
The company sold 50 units of Product A and 50 units of Product B.
