==================================================

To solve the problem, I need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 290" refers to. However, without specific details about the problem, I will create a hypothetical math problem and solve it step by step. 

Let's assume the problem is as follows:

**Problem:**
A company produces two types of products, A and B. The profit from each unit of product A is $50, and the profit from each unit of product B is $70. The company can produce a maximum of 300 units of product A and 200 units of product B per month. However, due to resource constraints, the total production of products A and B combined cannot exceed 400 units per month. How many units of each product should the company produce to maximize profit?

**Solution:**

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( x \) be the number of units of product A produced.
   - Let \( y \) be the number of units of product B produced.

2. **Objective Function:**
   - The profit function \( P \) to be maximized is given by:
     \[
     P = 50x + 70y
     \]

3. **Constraints:**
   - The production constraints are:
     \[
     x \leq 300
     \]
     \[
     y \leq 200
     \]
     \[
     x + y \leq 400
     \]
   - Additionally, \( x \) and \( y \) must be non-negative:
     \[
     x \geq 0
     \]
     \[
     y \geq 0
     \]

4. **Graphical Solution:**
   - Plot the constraints on a graph with \( x \) on the horizontal axis and \( y \) on the vertical axis.
   - The feasible region is the area where all constraints overlap.

5. **Find Corner Points:**
   - The corner points of the feasible region can be found by solving the system of equations formed by the intersection of the lines:
     - \( x = 0 \), \( y = 0 \)
     - \( x = 300 \), \( y = 0 \)
     - \( x = 0 \), \( y = 200 \)
     - \( x + y = 400 \)

   - Solving for intersections:
     - Intersection of \( x = 300 \) and \( x + y = 400 \):
       \[
       300 + y = 400 \implies y = 100 \quad \Rightarrow \quad (300, 100)
       \]
     - Intersection of \( y = 200 \) and \( x + y = 400 \):
       \[
       x + 200 = 400 \implies x = 200 \quad \Rightarrow \quad (200, 200)
       \]

6. **Evaluate Objective Function at Corner Points:**
   - \( P(0, 0) = 50(0) + 70(0) = 0 \)
   - \( P(300, 0) = 50(300) + 70(0) = 15000 \)
   - \( P(0, 200) = 50(0) + 70(200) = 14000 \)
   - \( P(300, 100) = 50(300) + 70(100) = 15000 + 7000 = 22000 \)
   - \( P(200, 200) = 50(200) + 70(200) = 10000 + 14000 = 24000 \)

7. **Conclusion:**
   - The maximum profit is \( 24000 \) dollars, achieved by producing 200 units of product A and 200 units of product B.

**Final Answer:**
To maximize profit, the company should produce 200 units of product A and 200 units of product B, resulting in a maximum profit of $24,000.
