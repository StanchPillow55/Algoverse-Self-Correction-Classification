==================================================

To solve the sample math problem "420," let's assume that the problem is asking us to analyze or perform calculations related to the number 420. Since the problem statement is not specific, I'll explore several mathematical aspects of the number 420.

### Step 1: Prime Factorization
First, let's find the prime factorization of 420.

1. **Divide by 2** (the smallest prime number):
   \[
   420 \div 2 = 210
   \]
2. **Divide by 2** again:
   \[
   210 \div 2 = 105
   \]
3. **Divide by 3** (the next smallest prime number):
   \[
   105 \div 3 = 35
   \]
4. **Divide by 5** (the next smallest prime number):
   \[
   35 \div 5 = 7
   \]
5. **Divide by 7** (the next smallest prime number):
   \[
   7 \div 7 = 1
   \]

Thus, the prime factorization of 420 is:
\[
420 = 2^2 \times 3^1 \times 5^1 \times 7^1
\]

### Step 2: Number of Divisors
To find the number of divisors of 420, use the formula for the number of divisors based on its prime factorization. If a number \( n \) has the prime factorization \( p_1^{a_1} \times p_2^{a_2} \times \ldots \times p_k^{a_k} \), then the number of divisors \( D(n) \) is:
\[
D(n) = (a_1 + 1)(a_2 + 1) \ldots (a_k + 1)
\]

For 420:
\[
D(420) = (2 + 1)(1 + 1)(1 + 1)(1 + 1) = 3 \times 2 \times 2 \times 2 = 24
\]

### Step 3: Sum of Divisors
To find the sum of the divisors, use the formula for the sum of divisors based on its prime factorization:
\[
\sigma(n) = (1 + p_1 + p_1^2 + \ldots + p_1^{a_1})(1 + p_2 + \ldots + p_2^{a_2}) \ldots (1 + p_k + \ldots + p_k^{a_k})
\]

For 420:
\[
\sigma(420) = (1 + 2 + 4)(1 + 3)(1 + 5)(1 + 7)
\]

Calculating each term:
- \(1 + 2 + 4 = 7\)
- \(1 + 3 = 4\)
- \(1 + 5 = 6\)
- \(1 + 7 = 8\)

Thus:
\[
\sigma(420) = 7 \times 4 \times 6 \times 8
\]

Calculating step-by-step:
- \(7 \times 4 = 28\)
- \(28 \times 6 = 168\)
- \(168 \times 8 = 1344\)

### Final Answer
The prime factorization of 420 is \(2^2 \times 3 \times 5 \times 7\). It has 24 divisors, and the sum of its divisors is 1344.
