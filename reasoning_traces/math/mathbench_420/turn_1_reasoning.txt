==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 420," we first need to understand what the problem is asking. However, the statement "Sample math problem 420" is vague and does not provide specific details about the problem. Without additional context or details, it's challenging to determine what calculations or reasoning are required.

To proceed, let's assume that "Sample math problem 420" refers to a generic math problem involving the number 420. A common type of problem involving numbers is to find their factors, prime factorization, or solve equations involving the number.

Let's explore a few possibilities:

### 1. Prime Factorization of 420

Prime factorization involves breaking down a number into its prime number components. Let's find the prime factorization of 420:

1. **Divide by 2 (the smallest prime number):**
   \[
   420 \div 2 = 210
   \]
   So, 420 = 2 × 210.

2. **Divide 210 by 2 again:**
   \[
   210 \div 2 = 105
   \]
   So, 210 = 2 × 105, and 420 = 2 × 2 × 105.

3. **Divide 105 by 3 (the next smallest prime number):**
   \[
   105 \div 3 = 35
   \]
   So, 105 = 3 × 35, and 420 = 2 × 2 × 3 × 35.

4. **Divide 35 by 5 (the next smallest prime number):**
   \[
   35 \div 5 = 7
   \]
   So, 35 = 5 × 7, and 420 = 2 × 2 × 3 × 5 × 7.

Thus, the prime factorization of 420 is:
\[
420 = 2^2 \times 3 \times 5 \times 7
\]

### 2. Finding Factors of 420

Factors of a number are integers that divide the number without leaving a remainder. Using the prime factorization, we can find all factors of 420 by considering all combinations of its prime factors.

The prime factorization of 420 is \(2^2 \times 3 \times 5 \times 7\). To find all factors, consider all combinations of these factors:

- \(1\)
- \(2, 4\) (from \(2^2\))
- \(3\)
- \(5\)
- \(7\)
- \(2 \times 3 = 6\)
- \(2 \times 5 = 10\)
- \(2 \times 7 = 14\)
- \(3 \times 5 = 15\)
- \(3 \times 7 = 21\)
- \(5 \times 7 = 35\)
- \(2^2 \times 3 = 12\)
- \(2^2 \times 5 = 20\)
- \(2^2 \times 7 = 28\)
- \(2 \times 3 \times 5 = 30\)
- \(2 \times 3 \times 7 = 42\)
- \(2 \times 5 \times 7 = 70\)
- \(3 \times 5 \times 7 = 105\)
- \(2^2 \times 3 \times 5 = 60\)
- \(2^2 \times 3 \times 7 = 84\)
- \(2^2 \times 5 \times 7 = 140\)
- \(2 \times 3 \times 5 \times 7 = 210\)
- \(2^2 \times 3 \times 5 \times 7 = 420\)

Thus, the factors of 420 are:
\[ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 10, 12, 14, 15, 20, 21, 28, 30, 35, 42, 60, 70, 84, 105, 140, 210, 420 \]

### Conclusion

Without a specific problem statement, we explored the prime factorization and factors of 420. If the problem involves something else, please provide additional details for a more targeted solution.

Final Answer:
- Prime Factorization of 420: \(2^2 \times 3 \times 5 \times 7\)
- Factors of 420: \(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 10, 12, 14, 15, 20, 21, 28, 30, 35, 42, 60, 70, 84, 105, 140, 210, 420\)
