To solve the problem, we first need to understand what "Sample math problem 420" refers to. Since there is no specific problem statement provided, I'll assume this is a placeholder for a generic math problem. Let's create a sample problem involving the number 420 and solve it step by step.

**Sample Problem:**
Find the prime factorization of 420 and use it to determine the number of divisors of 420.

**Step 1: Prime Factorization of 420**

To find the prime factorization, we divide 420 by the smallest prime number and continue the process with the quotient until we reach 1.

1. **Divide by 2** (the smallest prime number):
   \[
   420 \div 2 = 210
   \]
   So, 420 = 2 × 210.

2. **Divide 210 by 2**:
   \[
   210 \div 2 = 105
   \]
   So, 210 = 2 × 105, and thus 420 = 2 × 2 × 105.

3. **Divide 105 by 3** (the next smallest prime number):
   \[
   105 \div 3 = 35
   \]
   So, 105 = 3 × 35, and thus 420 = 2 × 2 × 3 × 35.

4. **Divide 35 by 5** (the next smallest prime number):
   \[
   35 \div 5 = 7
   \]
   So, 35 = 5 × 7, and thus 420 = 2 × 2 × 3 × 5 × 7.

Now, we have the prime factorization of 420:
\[
420 = 2^2 \times 3^1 \times 5^1 \times 7^1
\]

**Step 2: Determine the Number of Divisors**

To find the number of divisors of a number, use the formula based on its prime factorization. If a number \( n \) has the prime factorization \( p_1^{a_1} \times p_2^{a_2} \times \ldots \times p_k^{a_k} \), then the number of divisors \( D(n) \) is given by:
\[
D(n) = (a_1 + 1)(a_2 + 1) \ldots (a_k + 1)
\]

For 420, with the prime factorization \( 2^2 \times 3^1 \times 5^1 \times 7^1 \), the exponents are 2, 1, 1, and 1. Therefore, the number of divisors is:
\[
D(420) = (2 + 1)(1 + 1)(1 + 1)(1 + 1) = 3 \times 2 \times 2 \times 2
\]

Calculating this gives:
\[
3 \times 2 = 6 \\
6 \times 2 = 12 \\
12 \times 2 = 24
\]

Thus, the number of divisors of 420 is 24.

**Final Answer:**
The prime factorization of 420 is \( 2^2 \times 3^1 \times 5^1 \times 7^1 \), and the number of divisors of 420 is 24.
