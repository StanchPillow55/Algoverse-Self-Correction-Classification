==================================================

It seems like your question is a bit unclear, as "Sample math problem 420" does not specify a particular math problem to solve. However, I can demonstrate how to solve a sample math problem involving the number 420. 

Let's consider a problem where we need to find the prime factorization of 420.

### Step 1: Start with the number 420
We want to break down 420 into its prime factors.

### Step 2: Divide by the smallest prime number
The smallest prime number is 2. We check if 420 is divisible by 2:
- 420 is even, so it is divisible by 2.

Now, we divide:
\[ 
420 \div 2 = 210 
\]

### Step 3: Continue factoring
Next, we take 210 and check if it is divisible by 2:
- 210 is also even, so we divide by 2 again.

\[ 
210 \div 2 = 105 
\]

### Step 4: Check the next smallest prime number
Now we have 105. It is not even, so we check the next smallest prime number, which is 3:
- To check divisibility by 3, we can sum the digits of 105: \(1 + 0 + 5 = 6\), which is divisible by 3.

Now, we divide:
\[ 
105 \div 3 = 35 
\]

### Step 5: Factor 35
Next, we take 35 and check for divisibility by the next smallest prime number, which is 5:
- 35 ends in 5, so it is divisible by 5.

Now, we divide:
\[ 
35 \div 5 = 7 
\]

### Step 6: Identify the last factor
Now we have 7, which is a prime number itself.

### Step 7: Compile the prime factors
Putting it all together, we have:
- From 420, we divided by 2 twice, then by 3, then by 5, and finally we reached 7.

Thus, the prime factorization of 420 is:
\[ 
420 = 2^2 \times 3^1 \times 5^1 \times 7^1 
\]

### Final Answer
The prime factorization of 420 is:
\[
\boxed{2^2 \times 3^1 \times 5^1 \times 7^1}
\]
