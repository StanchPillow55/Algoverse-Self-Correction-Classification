==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample math problem 420" refers to. Since this is not a standard math problem description, I'll assume it might be a placeholder or a reference to a specific problem type. For the sake of this exercise, let's create a hypothetical math problem involving the number 420 and solve it.

**Problem:**
Calculate the sum of all positive divisors of 420.

**Solution:**

1. **Find the prime factorization of 420:**

   To find the prime factorization, we start by dividing 420 by the smallest prime number, which is 2:

   \[
   420 \div 2 = 210
   \]

   Continuing with 210:

   \[
   210 \div 2 = 105
   \]

   105 is not divisible by 2, so we move to the next smallest prime, which is 3:

   \[
   105 \div 3 = 35
   \]

   35 is not divisible by 3, so we try the next prime, which is 5:

   \[
   35 \div 5 = 7
   \]

   Finally, 7 is a prime number.

   Thus, the prime factorization of 420 is:

   \[
   420 = 2^2 \times 3^1 \times 5^1 \times 7^1
   \]

2. **Use the formula for the sum of divisors:**

   The sum of the divisors of a number \( n = p_1^{k_1} \times p_2^{k_2} \times \ldots \times p_m^{k_m} \) is given by:

   \[
   \sigma(n) = (1 + p_1 + p_1^2 + \ldots + p_1^{k_1})(1 + p_2 + \ldots + p_2^{k_2}) \ldots (1 + p_m + \ldots + p_m^{k_m})
   \]

   Applying this to 420:

   \[
   \sigma(420) = (1 + 2 + 2^2)(1 + 3)(1 + 5)(1 + 7)
   \]

   Calculate each term separately:

   - \( 1 + 2 + 2^2 = 1 + 2 + 4 = 7 \)
   - \( 1 + 3 = 4 \)
   - \( 1 + 5 = 6 \)
   - \( 1 + 7 = 8 \)

   Now, multiply these results:

   \[
   \sigma(420) = 7 \times 4 \times 6 \times 8
   \]

   Calculate step by step:

   - \( 7 \times 4 = 28 \)
   - \( 28 \times 6 = 168 \)
   - \( 168 \times 8 = 1344 \)

3. **Conclusion:**

   The sum of all positive divisors of 420 is 1344.

**Final Answer:**

The sum of all positive divisors of 420 is 1344.
