To determine Tim's profit from selling 10 jars of his special honey and jam mix, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the cost of ingredients for one jar.**
2. **Calculate the total cost for 10 jars.**
3. **Calculate the total revenue from selling 10 jars.**
4. **Calculate the profit by subtracting total costs from total revenue.**

### Step 1: Calculate the cost of ingredients for one jar

- **Passion Fruit:**
  - Amount needed: 2 pounds
  - Cost per pound: $6
  - Total cost for passion fruit: 
    \[
    2 \text{ pounds} \times 6 \text{ dollars/pound} = 12 \text{ dollars}
    \]

- **Jackfruit:**
  - Amount needed: 1.5 pounds
  - Cost per pound: $8
  - Total cost for jackfruit: 
    \[
    1.5 \text{ pounds} \times 8 \text{ dollars/pound} = 12 \text{ dollars}
    \]

- **Special Honey:**
  - Amount needed: 2 pounds
  - Cost per pound: $10
  - Total cost for honey: 
    \[
    2 \text{ pounds} \times 10 \text{ dollars/pound} = 20 \text{ dollars}
    \]

Now, we can sum up the costs of all ingredients for one jar:
\[
\text{Total cost for one jar} = \text{Cost of passion fruit} + \text{Cost of jackfruit} + \text{Cost of honey}
\]
\[
\text{Total cost for one jar} = 12 \text{ dollars} + 12 \text{ dollars} + 20 \text{ dollars} = 44 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the total cost for 10 jars

To find the total cost for 10 jars, we multiply the cost of one jar by 10:
\[
\text{Total cost for 10 jars} = 44 \text{ dollars/jar} \times 10 \text{ jars} = 440 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the total revenue from selling 10 jars

Tim sells each jar for $50. Therefore, the total revenue from selling 10 jars is:
\[
\text{Total revenue} = 50 \text{ dollars/jar} \times 10 \text{ jars} = 500 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the profit

Profit is calculated by subtracting the total costs from the total revenue:
\[
\text{Profit} = \text{Total revenue} - \text{Total cost}
\]
\[
\text{Profit} = 500 \text{ dollars} - 440 \text{ dollars} = 60 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Final Answer

Tim makes a profit of **$60** by selling 10 jars of his special honey and jam mix.
