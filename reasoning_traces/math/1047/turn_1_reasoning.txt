==================================================

Let's define the number of tennis balls Rory retrieved in each set:

- Let \( x \) be the number of tennis balls retrieved in the second set.
- According to the problem:
  - In the first set, he retrieved \( x + 4 \) balls (four more than in the second set).
  - In the third set, he retrieved \( \frac{x}{2} \) balls (half as many as in the second set).

Now, we can express the total number of tennis balls retrieved in all three sets:

\[
(x + 4) + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19
\]

Next, we will combine the terms on the left side of the equation. First, we need to express all terms with a common denominator. The common denominator for \( x \) and \( \frac{x}{2} \) is 2. Thus, we rewrite \( x \) as \( \frac{2x}{2} \):

\[
(x + 4) + \frac{2x}{2} + \frac{x}{2} = 19
\]

Now, we can rewrite the equation:

\[
(x + 4) + \frac{3x}{2} = 19
\]

Next, we simplify \( x + 4 \) by converting it into a fraction with a denominator of 2:

\[
\frac{2(x + 4)}{2} + \frac{3x}{2} = 19
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
\frac{2x + 8 + 3x}{2} = 19
\]

Combining the \( x \) terms gives:

\[
\frac{5x + 8}{2} = 19
\]

To eliminate the fraction, we multiply both sides by 2:

\[
5x + 8 = 38
\]

Now, we solve for \( x \) by subtracting 8 from both sides:

\[
5x = 30
\]

Dividing both sides by 5 gives:

\[
x = 6
\]

Now that we have \( x \), we can find the number of tennis balls retrieved in each set:

1. Second set: \( x = 6 \)
2. First set: \( x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10 \)
3. Third set: \( \frac{x}{2} = \frac{6}{2} = 3 \)

Finally, we can verify the total:

\[
10 + 6 + 3 = 19
\]

The calculations are correct. Therefore, the number of tennis balls Rory retrieved in the first set is:

\[
\boxed{10}
\]
