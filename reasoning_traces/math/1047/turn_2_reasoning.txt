Let \( x \) be the number of tennis balls Rory retrieved in the second set.

According to the problem:

1. In the first set, he retrieved \( x + 4 \) balls (four more than in the second set).
2. In the third set, he retrieved \( \frac{x}{2} \) balls (half as many as in the second set).

The total number of tennis balls retrieved in all three sets is given as 19. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[
(x + 4) + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19
\]

Now, let's simplify this equation step by step.

1. Combine like terms:
   \[
   x + 4 + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19
   \]
   This simplifies to:
   \[
   2x + 4 + \frac{x}{2} = 19
   \]

2. To eliminate the fraction, multiply the entire equation by 2:
   \[
   2(2x + 4) + 2\left(\frac{x}{2}\right) = 2 \cdot 19
   \]
   This gives:
   \[
   4x + 8 + x = 38
   \]

3. Combine the \( x \) terms:
   \[
   5x + 8 = 38
   \]

4. Subtract 8 from both sides:
   \[
   5x = 30
   \]

5. Divide by 5:
   \[
   x = 6
   \]

Now that we have \( x \), we can find the number of balls retrieved in each set:

- Second set: \( x = 6 \)
- First set: \( x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10 \)
- Third set: \( \frac{x}{2} = \frac{6}{2} = 3 \)

Finally, let's verify the total:
\[
10 + 6 + 3 = 19
\]

The calculations are correct. Therefore, the number of tennis balls Rory retrieved in the first set is:

\[
\boxed{10}
\]
