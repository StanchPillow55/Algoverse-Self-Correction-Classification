Let's define the number of tennis balls Rory retrieved in the second set as \( x \).

According to the problem:

1. In the first set, Rory retrieved four more balls than in the second set. Therefore, the number of balls he retrieved in the first set can be expressed as:
   \[
   x + 4
   \]

2. In the third set, he retrieved half as many balls as in the second set. Thus, the number of balls he retrieved in the third set can be expressed as:
   \[
   \frac{x}{2}
   \]

3. The total number of tennis balls retrieved across all three sets is given as 19. We can write the equation for the total number of balls retrieved as:
   \[
   (x + 4) + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19
   \]

Now, let's simplify this equation step by step.

First, combine the terms on the left side:
\[
x + 4 + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
2x + 4 + \frac{x}{2} = 19
\]

Next, to eliminate the fraction, we can multiply the entire equation by 2 (the least common multiple of the denominators):
\[
2(2x + 4 + \frac{x}{2}) = 2 \cdot 19
\]
This results in:
\[
4x + 8 + x = 38
\]

Now, combine like terms:
\[
5x + 8 = 38
\]

Next, isolate \( x \) by subtracting 8 from both sides:
\[
5x = 38 - 8
\]
\[
5x = 30
\]

Now, divide both sides by 5 to solve for \( x \):
\[
x = \frac{30}{5} = 6
\]

Now that we have \( x \), we can find the number of balls retrieved in each set:

- Second set: \( x = 6 \)
- First set: \( x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10 \)
- Third set: \( \frac{x}{2} = \frac{6}{2} = 3 \)

Finally, let's verify the total:
\[
10 \text{ (first set)} + 6 \text{ (second set)} + 3 \text{ (third set)} = 19
\]

The calculations are correct. Therefore, the number of tennis balls Rory retrieved in the first set of the match is:
\[
\boxed{10}
\]
