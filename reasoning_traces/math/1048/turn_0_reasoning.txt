To find the price of the car in the year 2010, we need to calculate the depreciation of the car's value over the years from 2007 to 2010. The car depreciates at a constant rate of 21% per year.

### Step 1: Understand the depreciation formula
The value of an asset after depreciation can be calculated using the formula:
\[
V = P(1 - r)^t
\]
where:
- \( V \) is the value of the asset after \( t \) years,
- \( P \) is the initial price of the asset,
- \( r \) is the depreciation rate (as a decimal),
- \( t \) is the number of years.

### Step 2: Identify the variables
From the problem:
- Initial price \( P = 20000 \) dollars,
- Depreciation rate \( r = 21\% = 0.21 \),
- Time \( t = 2010 - 2007 = 3 \) years.

### Step 3: Substitute the values into the formula
Now we substitute the values into the depreciation formula:
\[
V = 20000(1 - 0.21)^3
\]

### Step 4: Calculate \( (1 - 0.21) \)
First, we calculate \( 1 - 0.21 \):
\[
1 - 0.21 = 0.79
\]

### Step 5: Raise \( 0.79 \) to the power of 3
Next, we calculate \( 0.79^3 \):
\[
0.79^3 = 0.79 \times 0.79 \times 0.79
\]
Calculating step-by-step:
- \( 0.79 \times 0.79 = 0.6241 \)
- \( 0.6241 \times 0.79 \approx 0.492039 \)

### Step 6: Multiply by the initial price
Now we multiply this result by the initial price:
\[
V = 20000 \times 0.492039 \approx 9840.78
\]

### Final Answer
The price of the car in the year 2010 is approximately **$9840.78**.
