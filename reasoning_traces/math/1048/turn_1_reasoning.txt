==================================================

To find the price of the car in the year 2010, we need to calculate the depreciation of the car's value over the years from 2007 to 2010. The car depreciates at a constant rate of 21% per year.

### Step 1: Understand the depreciation formula
The value of the car after each year can be calculated using the formula for exponential decay:
\[
V = P(1 - r)^t
\]
where:
- \( V \) is the value of the car after \( t \) years,
- \( P \) is the initial price of the car,
- \( r \) is the depreciation rate (as a decimal),
- \( t \) is the number of years.

### Step 2: Identify the variables
From the problem:
- \( P = 20000 \) (the initial price of the car),
- \( r = 0.21 \) (the depreciation rate of 21%),
- \( t = 2010 - 2007 = 3 \) (the number of years from 2007 to 2010).

### Step 3: Substitute the values into the formula
Now we can substitute the values into the formula:
\[
V = 20000(1 - 0.21)^3
\]
Calculating \( 1 - 0.21 \):
\[
1 - 0.21 = 0.79
\]
Now, we raise \( 0.79 \) to the power of 3:
\[
0.79^3 = 0.79 \times 0.79 \times 0.79
\]
Calculating \( 0.79 \times 0.79 \):
\[
0.79 \times 0.79 = 0.6241
\]
Now, multiplying by \( 0.79 \) again:
\[
0.6241 \times 0.79 \approx 0.492039
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the final value
Now we can substitute back into the formula:
\[
V = 20000 \times 0.492039 \approx 9840.78
\]

### Final Answer
The price of the car in the year 2010 is approximately **$9840.78**.
