==================================================

To solve the problem, I need more specific information about "Sample reasoning question 293." Since the problem statement is not provided, I'll guide you through a general approach to solving math problems, which you can apply once you have the specific details of the question.

### General Approach to Solving Math Problems:

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - Read the problem carefully.
   - Identify what is being asked.
   - Determine what information is given and what needs to be found.

2. **Devise a Plan:**
   - Think about the strategies that could be used to solve the problem. This could include:
     - Drawing a diagram.
     - Writing an equation.
     - Looking for patterns.
     - Breaking the problem into smaller parts.

3. **Carry Out the Plan:**
   - Execute the steps you have planned.
   - Perform calculations carefully.
   - Keep track of units and ensure consistency.

4. **Check Your Work:**
   - Review each step to ensure there are no errors.
   - Verify that the solution makes sense in the context of the problem.
   - Check if there is another way to solve the problem to confirm your answer.

5. **State the Final Answer:**
   - Clearly write down the final answer.
   - Include units if applicable.

### Example Problem:

Let's apply this approach to a sample math problem:

**Problem:** Solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).

**Step 1: Understand the Problem**
- We need to find the value of \( x \) that makes the equation true.

**Step 2: Devise a Plan**
- We can isolate \( x \) by performing algebraic operations.

**Step 3: Carry Out the Plan**
- Start by subtracting 3 from both sides of the equation:
  \[
  2x + 3 - 3 = 11 - 3
  \]
  \[
  2x = 8
  \]
- Next, divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( x \):
  \[
  \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{8}{2}
  \]
  \[
  x = 4
  \]

**Step 4: Check Your Work**
- Substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation to verify:
  \[
  2(4) + 3 = 11
  \]
  \[
  8 + 3 = 11
  \]
- The left side equals the right side, confirming our solution is correct.

**Step 5: State the Final Answer**
- The solution to the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \) is \( x = 4 \).

If you provide the specific details of "Sample reasoning question 293," I can apply this structured approach to solve it.
