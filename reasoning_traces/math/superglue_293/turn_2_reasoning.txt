Question ID: superglue_293
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, let's first understand what "Sample reasoning question 293" might entail. Since the problem is not explicitly stated, I'll assume it involves a typical math problem-solving scenario. I'll create a hypothetical problem and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**

Let's assume the problem is as follows:

"Calculate the sum of the first 50 positive even numbers."

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Identify the Sequence:**
   - The sequence of the first 50 positive even numbers is: 2, 4, 6, ..., 100.
   - This is an arithmetic sequence where the first term \( a_1 = 2 \) and the common difference \( d = 2 \).

2. **Find the Last Term:**
   - The nth term of an arithmetic sequence is given by the formula:
     \[
     a_n = a_1 + (n-1) \cdot d
     \]
   - For the 50th term:
     \[
     a_{50} = 2 + (50-1) \cdot 2 = 2 + 98 = 100
     \]

3. **Sum of an Arithmetic Sequence:**
   - The sum \( S_n \) of the first \( n \) terms of an arithmetic sequence is given by:
     \[
     S_n = \frac{n}{2} \cdot (a_1 + a_n)
     \]
   - Substituting the known values:
     \[
     S_{50} = \frac{50}{2} \cdot (2 + 100) = 25 \cdot 102 = 2550
     \]

4. **Verification:**
   - To verify, consider the sum of the first \( n \) even numbers is given by \( n(n+1) \).
   - For \( n = 50 \):
     \[
     50 \cdot 51 = 2550
     \]
   - This matches our previous calculation.

**Final Answer:**

The sum of the first 50 positive even numbers is 2550.
