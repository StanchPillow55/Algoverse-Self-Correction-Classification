To solve the problem, we need to determine how many nights Chad can have his peanut butter sandwiches using the crackers from 5 boxes. We will break this down step by step.

### Step 1: Calculate the total number of crackers in one box.

Each box contains 4 sleeves, and each sleeve holds 28 crackers. Therefore, the total number of crackers in one box is calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Total crackers in one box} = \text{Number of sleeves} \times \text{Crackers per sleeve} = 4 \times 28
\]

Calculating this gives:

\[
4 \times 28 = 112 \text{ crackers}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the total number of crackers in 5 boxes.

Now, since Chad has 5 boxes of crackers, we can find the total number of crackers in 5 boxes:

\[
\text{Total crackers in 5 boxes} = \text{Total crackers in one box} \times 5 = 112 \times 5
\]

Calculating this gives:

\[
112 \times 5 = 560 \text{ crackers}
\]

### Step 3: Determine how many crackers Chad uses each night.

Chad sandwiches 2 crackers with a scoop of peanut butter each night. Therefore, the number of crackers he uses per night is:

\[
\text{Crackers used per night} = 2
\]

### Step 4: Calculate how many nights the total number of crackers will last.

To find out how many nights the 560 crackers will last, we divide the total number of crackers by the number of crackers used each night:

\[
\text{Number of nights} = \frac{\text{Total crackers}}{\text{Crackers used per night}} = \frac{560}{2}
\]

Calculating this gives:

\[
\frac{560}{2} = 280 \text{ nights}
\]

### Final Answer

Thus, the total number of nights that 5 boxes of crackers will last Chad is:

\[
\boxed{280}
\]
