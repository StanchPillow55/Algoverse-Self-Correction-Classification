To solve this problem, we need to determine how many nights Chad can make his peanut butter cracker sandwiches with 5 boxes of crackers.

### Step-by-step Solution:

1. **Determine the number of crackers Chad uses per night:**
   - Chad makes sandwiches using 2 crackers per sandwich.
   - He has 5 sandwiches each night.
   - Therefore, the number of crackers he uses per night is:
     \[
     2 \text{ crackers/sandwich} \times 5 \text{ sandwiches/night} = 10 \text{ crackers/night}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total number of crackers in one box:**
   - Each box contains 4 sleeves.
   - Each sleeve contains 28 crackers.
   - Therefore, the total number of crackers in one box is:
     \[
     4 \text{ sleeves/box} \times 28 \text{ crackers/sleeve} = 112 \text{ crackers/box}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total number of crackers in 5 boxes:**
   - Since one box has 112 crackers, 5 boxes will have:
     \[
     5 \text{ boxes} \times 112 \text{ crackers/box} = 560 \text{ crackers}
     \]

4. **Determine how many nights the 560 crackers will last:**
   - Chad uses 10 crackers per night.
   - Therefore, the number of nights the crackers will last is:
     \[
     \frac{560 \text{ crackers}}{10 \text{ crackers/night}} = 56 \text{ nights}
     \]

### Final Answer:
Chad's 5 boxes of crackers will last him 56 nights.
