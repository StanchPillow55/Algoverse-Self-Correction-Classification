==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to determine how many books Wendy wants to place in her shelving system based on the information given.

1. **Understanding the shelving system**: 
   The shelving system has 6 rows and 6 columns. To find the total number of spaces available for books, we multiply the number of rows by the number of columns:
   \[
   \text{Total spaces} = \text{Number of rows} \times \text{Number of columns} = 6 \times 6 = 36
   \]

2. **Setting up the equation**:
   According to the problem, Wendy wants to place "20 more than double the number of books." Let's denote the number of books she wants to place as \( x \). The phrase "20 more than double the number of books" can be expressed mathematically as:
   \[
   2x + 20
   \]

3. **Finding the number of books**:
   We need to find out how many books Wendy wants to place, which should not exceed the total spaces available in the shelving system. Therefore, we set up the inequality:
   \[
   2x + 20 \leq 36
   \]

4. **Solving the inequality**:
   To solve for \( x \), we first subtract 20 from both sides:
   \[
   2x \leq 36 - 20
   \]
   \[
   2x \leq 16
   \]

   Next, we divide both sides by 2:
   \[
   x \leq \frac{16}{2}
   \]
   \[
   x \leq 8
   \]

5. **Calculating the total number of books**:
   Now that we have \( x \leq 8 \), we can find the total number of books Wendy wants to place using the expression \( 2x + 20 \). Since \( x \) can be at most 8, we calculate:
   \[
   \text{Total books} = 2(8) + 20 = 16 + 20 = 36
   \]

6. **Conclusion**:
   Wendy can carry up to 36 books to fill the shelving system completely, as this is the maximum number of books she can place according to the condition given in the problem.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{36}
\]
