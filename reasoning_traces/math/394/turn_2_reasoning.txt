Question ID: 394
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to determine how many books Wendy wants to place in her shelving system based on the information given.

1. **Understanding the shelving system**: 
   The shelving system has 6 rows and 6 columns. To find the total capacity of the shelving system, we multiply the number of rows by the number of columns:
   \[
   \text{Total capacity} = \text{Number of rows} \times \text{Number of columns} = 6 \times 6 = 36 \text{ books}
   \]

2. **Understanding Wendy's requirement**:
   Wendy wants to place "20 more than double the number of books." We need to define what "the number of books" refers to. Since the problem does not specify a particular number of books, we can denote the number of books as \( x \).

   According to the problem:
   \[
   \text{Books Wendy wants to place} = 2x + 20
   \]

3. **Setting up the equation**:
   We know that the total capacity of the shelving system is 36 books. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
   \[
   2x + 20 = 36
   \]

4. **Solving for \( x \)**:
   To find \( x \), we will isolate it in the equation:
   - First, subtract 20 from both sides:
   \[
   2x + 20 - 20 = 36 - 20
   \]
   \[
   2x = 16
   \]
   - Next, divide both sides by 2:
   \[
   x = \frac{16}{2} = 8
   \]

5. **Calculating the number of books Wendy wants to place**:
   Now that we have \( x = 8 \), we can calculate how many books Wendy wants to place:
   \[
   \text{Books Wendy wants to place} = 2(8) + 20 = 16 + 20 = 36
   \]

6. **Final answer**:
   Wendy needs to carry 36 books to complete her task.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{36}
\]
