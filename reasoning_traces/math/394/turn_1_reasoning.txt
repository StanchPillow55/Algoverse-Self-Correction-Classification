==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine how many nights Chad can make his peanut butter cracker sandwiches with 5 boxes of crackers. Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Step 1: Determine the number of crackers Chad uses per night

Chad makes a sandwich with 2 crackers and has 5 of these sandwiches each night. Therefore, the number of crackers he uses per night is calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Crackers per sandwich} = 2
\]
\[
\text{Sandwiches per night} = 5
\]
\[
\text{Crackers per night} = 2 \times 5 = 10
\]

Chad uses 10 crackers each night.

### Step 2: Determine the total number of crackers in one box

Each box of crackers contains 4 sleeves, and each sleeve holds 28 crackers. Therefore, the total number of crackers in one box is calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Sleeves per box} = 4
\]
\[
\text{Crackers per sleeve} = 28
\]
\[
\text{Crackers per box} = 4 \times 28 = 112
\]

Each box contains 112 crackers.

### Step 3: Determine the total number of crackers in 5 boxes

Since each box contains 112 crackers, the total number of crackers in 5 boxes is:

\[
\text{Crackers in 5 boxes} = 5 \times 112 = 560
\]

There are 560 crackers in 5 boxes.

### Step 4: Determine how many nights the crackers will last

Now, we need to find out how many nights Chad can use these crackers if he uses 10 crackers per night. We do this by dividing the total number of crackers by the number of crackers used per night:

\[
\text{Crackers per night} = 10
\]
\[
\text{Total nights} = \frac{560}{10} = 56
\]

Chad can make his peanut butter cracker sandwiches for 56 nights with 5 boxes of crackers.

### Final Answer

Chad's 5 boxes of crackers will last him for 56 nights.
