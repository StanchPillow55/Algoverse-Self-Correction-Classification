Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to determine how many books Wendy wants to place in her shelving system based on the information provided.

1. **Understanding the shelving system**: 
   - The shelving system has 6 rows and 6 columns. 
   - To find the total capacity of the shelving system, we multiply the number of rows by the number of columns:
     \[
     \text{Total capacity} = \text{Number of rows} \times \text{Number of columns} = 6 \times 6 = 36
     \]
   - Therefore, the shelving system can hold a total of 36 books.

2. **Understanding Wendy's requirement**:
   - Wendy wants to place "20 more than double the number of books." 
   - Let's denote the number of books she wants to place as \( x \).
   - According to the problem, Wendy's requirement can be expressed mathematically as:
     \[
     x = 2x + 20
     \]

3. **Setting up the equation**:
   - We can rearrange the equation to isolate \( x \):
     \[
     x - 2x = 20
     \]
     \[
     -x = 20
     \]
     \[
     x = -20
     \]
   - However, this result does not make sense in the context of the problem, as the number of books cannot be negative.

4. **Revisiting the problem**:
   - The phrase "20 more than double the number of books" can be interpreted differently. It seems we need to find the total number of books Wendy wants, which is not directly related to the capacity of the shelving system.
   - Let's denote the number of books she currently has as \( b \). Then, the expression for the number of books she wants to place becomes:
     \[
     \text{Books Wendy wants} = 2b + 20
     \]

5. **Finding the total number of books**:
   - Since we do not have a specific value for \( b \) (the number of books she currently has), we can express the total number of books she needs in terms of \( b \):
     \[
     \text{Total books needed} = 2b + 20
     \]

6. **Conclusion**:
   - Without additional information about how many books Wendy currently has, we cannot determine a specific numerical answer. However, we can express the number of books she needs as a function of the number of books she currently has.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\text{Wendy needs } 2b + 20 \text{ books, where } b \text{ is the number of books she currently has.}
\]
