Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To determine how many nights Chad's 5 boxes of crackers will last him, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of crackers in one box**:
   - Each box has 4 sleeves.
   - Each sleeve contains 28 crackers.
   - Therefore, the total number of crackers in one box is:
     \[
     4 \text{ sleeves} \times 28 \text{ crackers/sleeve} = 112 \text{ crackers/box}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total number of crackers in 5 boxes**:
   - Since each box contains 112 crackers, the total number of crackers in 5 boxes is:
     \[
     5 \text{ boxes} \times 112 \text{ crackers/box} = 560 \text{ crackers}
     \]

3. **Determine how many crackers Chad uses each night**:
   - Chad sandwiches 2 crackers with a scoop of peanut butter, which means he uses 2 crackers per sandwich.
   - He has 5 sandwiches each night, so the total number of crackers he uses per night is:
     \[
     5 \text{ sandwiches} \times 2 \text{ crackers/sandwich} = 10 \text{ crackers/night}
     \]

4. **Calculate how many nights the crackers will last**:
   - To find out how many nights the total number of crackers will last, we divide the total number of crackers by the number of crackers he uses each night:
     \[
     \frac{560 \text{ crackers}}{10 \text{ crackers/night}} = 56 \text{ nights}
     \]

Thus, the final answer is that Chad's 5 boxes of crackers will last him **56 nights**.
