Question ID: 40
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost Mr. Benson paid for the 12 concert tickets, taking into account the discount he received for the tickets that exceeded 10.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Determine the Cost of Tickets Without Discount:**

   The cost of one ticket is $40. Mr. Benson bought 12 tickets in total. Therefore, the total cost without any discount would be:

   \[
   \text{Total cost without discount} = 12 \times 40 = 480 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Identify the Number of Discounted Tickets:**

   Mr. Benson receives a 5% discount on every ticket bought that exceeds 10. He bought 12 tickets, so the number of tickets that qualify for the discount is:

   \[
   \text{Number of discounted tickets} = 12 - 10 = 2
   \]

3. **Calculate the Discount per Ticket:**

   The discount per ticket is 5% of the ticket price. Therefore, the discount on one ticket is:

   \[
   \text{Discount per ticket} = 0.05 \times 40 = 2 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Calculate the Total Discount:**

   Since 2 tickets are eligible for the discount, the total discount Mr. Benson receives is:

   \[
   \text{Total discount} = 2 \times 2 = 4 \text{ dollars}
   \]

5. **Calculate the Total Cost After Discount:**

   To find the total amount Mr. Benson paid, subtract the total discount from the total cost without discount:

   \[
   \text{Total cost after discount} = 480 - 4 = 476 \text{ dollars}
   \]

### Final Answer:

Mr. Benson paid a total of $476 for the 12 concert tickets after applying the discount.
