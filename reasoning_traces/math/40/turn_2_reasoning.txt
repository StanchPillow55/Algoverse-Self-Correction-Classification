Question ID: 40
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost Mr. Benson paid for 12 concert tickets, considering the discount applied to tickets exceeding 10.

1. **Determine the cost of the first 10 tickets:**
   - Each ticket costs $40.
   - For the first 10 tickets, there is no discount.
   - Cost for 10 tickets = 10 tickets × $40/ticket = $400.

2. **Determine the cost of the additional tickets:**
   - Mr. Benson bought 12 tickets in total, so he bought 12 - 10 = 2 additional tickets.
   - These additional tickets receive a 5% discount.

3. **Calculate the discount for the additional tickets:**
   - The original cost of each additional ticket is $40.
   - The discount on each additional ticket is 5% of $40.
   - Discount per ticket = 0.05 × $40 = $2.

4. **Calculate the discounted price for each additional ticket:**
   - Discounted price per additional ticket = $40 - $2 = $38.

5. **Calculate the total cost for the additional tickets:**
   - Total cost for 2 additional tickets = 2 tickets × $38/ticket = $76.

6. **Calculate the total amount Mr. Benson paid:**
   - Total cost = Cost of first 10 tickets + Cost of additional tickets
   - Total cost = $400 + $76 = $476.

Therefore, Mr. Benson paid a total of $476 for the 12 concert tickets.

**Final Answer:** Mr. Benson paid $476 in all.
