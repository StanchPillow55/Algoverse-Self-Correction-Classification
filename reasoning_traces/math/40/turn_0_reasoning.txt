To determine how much Mr. Benson paid for the concert tickets, we will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total cost without discount**: 
   The cost of one ticket is $40. Mr. Benson bought 12 tickets. Therefore, the total cost without any discount can be calculated as follows:

   \[
   \text{Total cost without discount} = \text{Number of tickets} \times \text{Cost per ticket}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total cost without discount} = 12 \times 40 = 480
   \]

2. **Determine the number of tickets eligible for discount**:
   The discount applies to tickets bought that exceed 10. Since Mr. Benson bought 12 tickets, the number of tickets eligible for the discount is:

   \[
   \text{Number of tickets eligible for discount} = 12 - 10 = 2
   \]

3. **Calculate the discount per ticket**:
   The discount is 5% of the ticket price. We can calculate the discount amount for one ticket as follows:

   \[
   \text{Discount per ticket} = 0.05 \times \text{Cost per ticket}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Discount per ticket} = 0.05 \times 40 = 2
   \]

4. **Calculate the total discount for the eligible tickets**:
   Since there are 2 tickets eligible for the discount, the total discount can be calculated as follows:

   \[
   \text{Total discount} = \text{Number of discounted tickets} \times \text{Discount per ticket}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total discount} = 2 \times 2 = 4
   \]

5. **Calculate the final total cost after applying the discount**:
   To find the final amount Mr. Benson paid, we subtract the total discount from the total cost without discount:

   \[
   \text{Final total cost} = \text{Total cost without discount} - \text{Total discount}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Final total cost} = 480 - 4 = 476
   \]

Thus, the total amount Mr. Benson paid for the concert tickets is:

\[
\boxed{476}
\]
