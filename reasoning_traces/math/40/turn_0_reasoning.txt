Question ID: 40
Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

Mr. Benson bought 12 tickets, so the first 10 tickets cost $40 each, and the last 2 tickets have a 5% discount.

First, let's calculate the cost of the first 10 tickets:
10 tickets * $40/ticket = $400

Next, let's calculate the cost of the last 2 tickets with the discount:
The original price of each of these tickets is $40, so a 5% discount means he pays 95% of the original price:
$40 * 0.95 = $38

So the cost of the last 2 tickets is:
2 tickets * $38/ticket = $76

Finally, let's add the cost of the first 10 tickets and the last 2 tickets to find the total cost:
$400 + $76 = $476

So, Mr. Benson paid $476 in all.
