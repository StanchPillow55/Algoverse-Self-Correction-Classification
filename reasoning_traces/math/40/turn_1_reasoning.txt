Question ID: 40
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of the concert tickets Mr. Benson bought, taking into account the discount he received for the tickets that exceeded 10.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Determine the number of tickets purchased:**
   - Mr. Benson bought a total of 12 tickets.

2. **Identify the number of tickets eligible for a discount:**
   - The discount applies to every ticket bought that exceeds 10.
   - Therefore, the number of tickets eligible for a discount is \(12 - 10 = 2\).

3. **Calculate the cost of the tickets without a discount:**
   - The first 10 tickets are not eligible for a discount.
   - The cost of these 10 tickets is \(10 \times 40 = 400\) dollars.

4. **Calculate the discount on the additional tickets:**
   - Each of the 2 additional tickets receives a 5% discount.
   - The original price of each ticket is $40.
   - The discount on one ticket is \(5\% \times 40 = 0.05 \times 40 = 2\) dollars.
   - Therefore, the discounted price of one ticket is \(40 - 2 = 38\) dollars.

5. **Calculate the total cost of the discounted tickets:**
   - The total cost for the 2 discounted tickets is \(2 \times 38 = 76\) dollars.

6. **Calculate the total amount Mr. Benson paid:**
   - Add the cost of the 10 non-discounted tickets to the cost of the 2 discounted tickets:
   \[
   400 + 76 = 476
   \]

### Final Answer:
Mr. Benson paid a total of $476 for the 12 concert tickets.
