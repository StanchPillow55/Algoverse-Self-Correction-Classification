Question ID: 40
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of the concert tickets Mr. Benson bought, taking into account the discount he received for buying more than 10 tickets.

1. **Determine the number of tickets eligible for a discount:**
   - Mr. Benson bought a total of 12 tickets.
   - The discount applies to tickets bought in excess of 10.
   - Therefore, the number of tickets eligible for a discount is \(12 - 10 = 2\).

2. **Calculate the cost of the tickets without a discount:**
   - The first 10 tickets are not eligible for a discount.
   - Each ticket costs $40.
   - The cost for these 10 tickets is \(10 \times 40 = 400\) dollars.

3. **Calculate the discount on the additional tickets:**
   - The discount is 5% per ticket for the 2 additional tickets.
   - The original cost of these 2 tickets without a discount is \(2 \times 40 = 80\) dollars.
   - The discount per ticket is \(5\%\) of $40, which is \(0.05 \times 40 = 2\) dollars.
   - Therefore, the total discount for 2 tickets is \(2 \times 2 = 4\) dollars.

4. **Calculate the cost of the additional tickets after the discount:**
   - The cost of the 2 additional tickets after applying the discount is \(80 - 4 = 76\) dollars.

5. **Calculate the total cost Mr. Benson paid:**
   - Add the cost of the first 10 tickets to the cost of the additional 2 tickets after the discount.
   - Total cost = \(400 + 76 = 476\) dollars.

Therefore, Mr. Benson paid a total of $476 for the 12 concert tickets.

**Final Answer:**
Mr. Benson paid $476 in all.
