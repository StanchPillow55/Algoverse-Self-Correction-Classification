==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample reasoning question 450," we need to first understand what the problem is asking. However, the problem statement provided is incomplete and lacks specific details or context. Therefore, I will demonstrate a general approach to solving a typical math problem by using a hypothetical example.

Let's assume the problem is as follows:

**Problem:** Calculate the sum of all even numbers between 1 and 450.

**Step-by-step Solution:**

1. **Identify the Sequence of Even Numbers:**
   - Even numbers between 1 and 450 start from 2 and end at 450.
   - The sequence of even numbers is: 2, 4, 6, ..., 450.

2. **Determine the Number of Terms:**
   - The sequence of even numbers can be expressed as an arithmetic sequence where the first term \( a_1 = 2 \) and the common difference \( d = 2 \).
   - The general formula for the \( n \)-th term of an arithmetic sequence is:
     \[
     a_n = a_1 + (n-1) \cdot d
     \]
   - Set \( a_n = 450 \) to find the number of terms \( n \):
     \[
     450 = 2 + (n-1) \cdot 2
     \]
     \[
     450 = 2 + 2n - 2
     \]
     \[
     450 = 2n
     \]
     \[
     n = \frac{450}{2} = 225
     \]
   - There are 225 even numbers between 1 and 450.

3. **Calculate the Sum of the Sequence:**
   - The sum \( S_n \) of the first \( n \) terms of an arithmetic sequence is given by:
     \[
     S_n = \frac{n}{2} \cdot (a_1 + a_n)
     \]
   - Substitute the known values:
     \[
     S_{225} = \frac{225}{2} \cdot (2 + 450)
     \]
     \[
     S_{225} = \frac{225}{2} \cdot 452
     \]
     \[
     S_{225} = 112.5 \cdot 452
     \]
     \[
     S_{225} = 50850
     \]

**Final Answer:**
The sum of all even numbers between 1 and 450 is 50,850.

This solution demonstrates a logical approach to solving a problem involving arithmetic sequences, including identifying the sequence, determining the number of terms, and calculating the sum. If the original problem "Sample reasoning question 450" has different specifics, please provide additional details for a tailored solution.
