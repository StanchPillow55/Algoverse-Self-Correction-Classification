==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample reasoning question 450," we need to first understand what the problem is asking. However, the problem statement provided is incomplete and lacks specific details or context. Therefore, I will demonstrate a general approach to solving a typical math problem by assuming a hypothetical problem related to the number 450.

Let's assume the problem is as follows:

**Problem:** What is the prime factorization of 450?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   We need to find the prime factors of the number 450. Prime factorization involves expressing a number as a product of its prime factors.

2. **Start with the Smallest Prime Number:**
   Begin dividing 450 by the smallest prime number, which is 2.

   \[
   450 \div 2 = 225
   \]

   Since 450 is even, it is divisible by 2. We have one factor of 2.

3. **Proceed to the Next Prime Number:**
   Now, check if 225 is divisible by 2. Since 225 is odd, it is not divisible by 2. Move to the next prime number, which is 3.

   \[
   225 \div 3 = 75
   \]

   225 is divisible by 3. We have one factor of 3.

4. **Continue Factoring:**
   Check if 75 is divisible by 3.

   \[
   75 \div 3 = 25
   \]

   75 is divisible by 3. We have another factor of 3.

5. **Move to the Next Prime Number:**
   Now, check if 25 is divisible by 3. It is not, so move to the next prime number, which is 5.

   \[
   25 \div 5 = 5
   \]

   25 is divisible by 5. We have one factor of 5.

6. **Complete the Factorization:**
   Finally, divide 5 by 5.

   \[
   5 \div 5 = 1
   \]

   We have another factor of 5.

7. **Compile the Prime Factors:**
   The prime factorization of 450 is the product of all the prime factors we found:

   \[
   450 = 2 \times 3 \times 3 \times 5 \times 5
   \]

   This can be written using exponents as:

   \[
   450 = 2^1 \times 3^2 \times 5^2
   \]

**Final Answer:**
The prime factorization of 450 is \(2^1 \times 3^2 \times 5^2\).
