To solve the problem, we will first calculate the total number of male and female fishes in Tate's garden pond before and after he buys additional fishes. Then, we will find the difference between the number of female fishes and male fishes.

### Step 1: Calculate the initial number of male and female fishes

**Initial counts:**
- Male guppies: 4
- Female guppies: 7
- Male goldfishes: 3
- Female goldfishes: 5

**Total male fishes:**
\[
\text{Total male fishes} = \text{Male guppies} + \text{Male goldfishes} = 4 + 3 = 7
\]

**Total female fishes:**
\[
\text{Total female fishes} = \text{Female guppies} + \text{Female goldfishes} = 7 + 5 = 12
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the number of fishes after Tate buys more

**Fishes bought:**
- Male guppies: 2
- Female guppies: 1
- Male goldfishes: 2
- Female goldfishes: 3

**Total male fishes after purchase:**
\[
\text{Total male fishes after purchase} = \text{Initial male fishes} + \text{Male guppies bought} + \text{Male goldfishes bought}
\]
\[
= 7 + 2 + 2 = 11
\]

**Total female fishes after purchase:**
\[
\text{Total female fishes after purchase} = \text{Initial female fishes} + \text{Female guppies bought} + \text{Female goldfishes bought}
\]
\[
= 12 + 1 + 3 = 16
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the difference between female and male fishes

Now we need to find how many more female fishes than male fishes there are:
\[
\text{Difference} = \text{Total female fishes} - \text{Total male fishes}
\]
\[
= 16 - 11 = 5
\]

### Final Answer
Tate has **5 more female fishes than male fishes**.
