To find out how much each top cost, we need to break down Ann's total spending and calculate the cost of the tops based on the information given.

1. **Calculate the total cost of the shorts:**
   - Ann bought 5 pairs of shorts at $7 each.
   - Total cost of shorts = Number of shorts × Price per short
   \[
   \text{Total cost of shorts} = 5 \times 7 = 35 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Calculate the total cost of the shoes:**
   - Ann bought 2 pairs of shoes at $10 each.
   - Total cost of shoes = Number of shoes × Price per shoe
   \[
   \text{Total cost of shoes} = 2 \times 10 = 20 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total cost of shorts and shoes combined:**
   \[
   \text{Total cost of shorts and shoes} = \text{Total cost of shorts} + \text{Total cost of shoes}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total cost of shorts and shoes} = 35 + 20 = 55 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Determine how much Ann spent on the tops:**
   - Ann spent a total of $75.
   - The amount spent on tops = Total amount spent - Total cost of shorts and shoes
   \[
   \text{Amount spent on tops} = 75 - 55 = 20 \text{ dollars}
   \]

5. **Calculate the cost of each top:**
   - Ann bought 4 tops, all at the same price.
   - Cost per top = Amount spent on tops / Number of tops
   \[
   \text{Cost per top} = \frac{20}{4} = 5 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Thus, the cost of each top is \( \boxed{5} \) dollars.
