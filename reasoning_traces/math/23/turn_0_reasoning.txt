==================================================

To determine how many centimeters shorter the candle will be after burning from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total time the candle burns**: 
   - The time from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM is 4 hours. 
   - This is calculated as follows:
     \[
     5:00 \text{ PM} - 1:00 \text{ PM} = 4 \text{ hours}
     \]

2. **Determine the rate at which the candle melts**: 
   - The problem states that the candle melts by 2 centimeters every hour.

3. **Calculate the total amount the candle melts over the 4 hours**:
   - Since the candle melts 2 centimeters each hour, we can calculate the total melting over 4 hours by multiplying the melting rate by the number of hours:
     \[
     \text{Total melting} = \text{melting rate} \times \text{time} = 2 \text{ cm/hour} \times 4 \text{ hours}
     \]
   - Performing the multiplication:
     \[
     \text{Total melting} = 2 \times 4 = 8 \text{ cm}
     \]

4. **State the final answer**:
   - After burning from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM, the candle will be **8 centimeters shorter**.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{8 \text{ cm}}
\]
