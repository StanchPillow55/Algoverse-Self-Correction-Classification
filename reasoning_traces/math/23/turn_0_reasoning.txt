==================================================

First, let's calculate how much Ann spent on shorts and shoes.

She bought 5 pairs of shorts for $7 each, so she spent 5 * $7 = $<<5*7=35>>35 on shorts.

She bought 2 pairs of shoes for $10 each, so she spent 2 * $10 = $<<2*10=20>>20 on shoes.

So, the total amount she spent on shorts and shoes is $35 + $20 = $<<35+20=55>>55.

Ann spent $75 in total, and we know that $55 was spent on shorts and shoes. Therefore, the rest of the money, which is $75 - $55 = $<<75-55=20>>20, was spent on tops.

Ann bought 4 tops, all at the same price. So, to find the price of each top, we divide the total amount spent on tops by the number of tops. That is $20 / 4 = $<<20/4=5>>5.

So, each top cost $5. 

Final Answer: Each top cost $5.
