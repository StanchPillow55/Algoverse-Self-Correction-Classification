==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine how many books Roselyn had initially before giving any away. Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the number of books given to Rebecca:**
   - Rebecca received 40 books.

2. **Determine the number of books given to Mara:**
   - Roselyn gives Mara three times as many books as she gives Rebecca. Since Rebecca received 40 books, Mara receives:
     \[
     3 \times 40 = 120 \text{ books}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total number of books given away:**
   - The total number of books given to both Mara and Rebecca is the sum of the books each received:
     \[
     40 \text{ (to Rebecca)} + 120 \text{ (to Mara)} = 160 \text{ books}
     \]

4. **Determine the number of books Roselyn had initially:**
   - We know that after giving away books to Mara and Rebecca, Roselyn remains with 60 books. Therefore, the total number of books she had initially is the sum of the books she gave away and the books she has left:
     \[
     160 \text{ (books given away)} + 60 \text{ (books remaining)} = 220 \text{ books}
     \]

Thus, Roselyn initially had 220 books.

**Final Answer:**
Roselyn had 220 books before giving any away.
