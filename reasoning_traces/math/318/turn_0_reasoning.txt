To solve the problem, we need to determine how many books Roselyn had before giving some away. Let's break down the information given step by step.

1. **Identify the variables**:
   - Let \( R \) be the number of books Roselyn gives to Rebecca.
   - Let \( M \) be the number of books Roselyn gives to Mara.
   - Let \( B \) be the total number of books Roselyn had before giving any away.

2. **Information from the problem**:
   - We know that Rebecca received 40 books, so \( R = 40 \).
   - Roselyn gives Mara three times as many books as she gives Rebecca, so:
     \[
     M = 3R = 3 \times 40 = 120
     \]
   - After giving away the books, Roselyn has 60 books left.

3. **Calculate the total number of books given away**:
   - The total number of books given away by Roselyn is the sum of the books given to Rebecca and Mara:
     \[
     \text{Total given away} = R + M = 40 + 120 = 160
     \]

4. **Set up the equation for the total number of books**:
   - If Roselyn had \( B \) books initially and gave away 160 books, then the number of books she has left is:
     \[
     B - 160 = 60
     \]

5. **Solve for \( B \)**:
   - Rearranging the equation gives:
     \[
     B = 60 + 160 = 220
     \]

Thus, Roselyn had **220 books** before giving any away.

**Final Answer**: Roselyn had 220 books before.
