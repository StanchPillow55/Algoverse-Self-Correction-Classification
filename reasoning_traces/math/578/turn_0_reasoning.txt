Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step.

1. **Identify the starting value**: Diane gave the number train a starting value of 20.

2. **Define the number**: Letâ€™s denote the number as \( x \). According to the problem, the starting value is 20, so we can write:
   \[
   x = 20
   \]

3. **Calculate half of the number**: We need to find half of the number \( x \):
   \[
   \text{Half of } x = \frac{x}{2} = \frac{20}{2} = 10
   \]

4. **Add the starting value to half the number**: Now we add the starting value (20) to half of the number (10):
   \[
   \text{Starting value} + \text{Half of the number} = 20 + 10 = 30
   \]

5. **Divide the result by 5**: Next, we divide this sum by 5:
   \[
   \frac{30}{5} = 6
   \]

6. **Calculate the starting value minus 12**: Now we need to find the starting value minus 12:
   \[
   \text{Starting value} - 12 = 20 - 12 = 8
   \]

7. **Multiply the result from step 5 by the result from step 6**: Finally, we multiply the result from step 5 (which is 6) by the result from step 6 (which is 8):
   \[
   6 \times 8 = 48
   \]

Thus, the final value of the number train is:
\[
\boxed{48}
\]
