==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 440," we need to first understand what the problem is asking. However, the problem statement "Sample math problem 440" is not specific enough for us to determine the exact nature of the problem. It seems like a placeholder or reference to a specific problem that is not fully described here.

To proceed, let's assume that "Sample math problem 440" refers to a generic math problem that we need to solve. Since no specific details are given, I'll create a sample math problem and solve it step by step.

**Sample Math Problem:**

Let's assume "Sample math problem 440" is the following:

"Calculate the sum of the first 440 positive integers."

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   We need to find the sum of the first 440 positive integers. The first positive integer is 1, and the 440th positive integer is 440.

2. **Use the Formula for the Sum of an Arithmetic Series:**
   The sum \( S_n \) of the first \( n \) positive integers can be calculated using the formula:
   \[
   S_n = \frac{n(n + 1)}{2}
   \]
   where \( n \) is the number of terms.

3. **Substitute the Given Value:**
   In this problem, \( n = 440 \). Substitute 440 into the formula:
   \[
   S_{440} = \frac{440(440 + 1)}{2}
   \]

4. **Calculate the Sum:**
   First, calculate \( 440 + 1 \):
   \[
   440 + 1 = 441
   \]

   Next, multiply 440 by 441:
   \[
   440 \times 441 = 194040
   \]

   Finally, divide by 2 to find the sum:
   \[
   S_{440} = \frac{194040}{2} = 97020
   \]

5. **Conclusion:**
   The sum of the first 440 positive integers is 97,020.

**Final Answer:**
The sum of the first 440 positive integers is 97,020.
