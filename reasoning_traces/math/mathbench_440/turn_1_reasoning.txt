==================================================

To solve the problem, we first need to understand what "Sample math problem 440" refers to. Since the problem is not explicitly stated, I'll assume it involves a typical math problem that could be labeled as such. Let's create a hypothetical problem and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**
"Calculate the sum of the first 440 positive integers."

To solve this problem, we can use the formula for the sum of the first \( n \) positive integers:

\[
S_n = \frac{n(n + 1)}{2}
\]

where \( n \) is the number of terms. In this case, \( n = 440 \).

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Identify the formula:** We use the formula for the sum of the first \( n \) positive integers, which is \( S_n = \frac{n(n + 1)}{2} \).

2. **Substitute \( n = 440 \) into the formula:**

   \[
   S_{440} = \frac{440(440 + 1)}{2}
   \]

3. **Calculate \( 440 + 1 \):**

   \[
   440 + 1 = 441
   \]

4. **Multiply 440 by 441:**

   \[
   440 \times 441 = 194040
   \]

   To verify this multiplication, break it down:
   \[
   440 \times 441 = 440 \times (440 + 1) = 440 \times 440 + 440 \times 1
   \]
   \[
   440 \times 440 = 193600 \quad \text{(since } 440^2 = 193600\text{)}
   \]
   \[
   440 \times 1 = 440
   \]
   \[
   193600 + 440 = 194040
   \]

5. **Divide the product by 2:**

   \[
   S_{440} = \frac{194040}{2} = 97020
   \]

**Final Answer:**

The sum of the first 440 positive integers is \( 97020 \).

This solution follows a logical sequence of steps using a well-known mathematical formula to arrive at the final answer.
