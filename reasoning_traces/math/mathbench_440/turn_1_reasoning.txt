==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 440," we need to first understand what the problem is asking. However, the problem statement "Sample math problem 440" is not specific enough for us to determine what calculations or reasoning are required. It seems like a placeholder or reference to a specific problem that is not provided here.

To proceed, let's assume that "Sample math problem 440" refers to a hypothetical math problem. Since no specific details are given, I'll create a sample math problem and solve it step by step.

**Sample Math Problem:**
Let's assume "Sample math problem 440" is the following:

**Problem:** Solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 2x + 5 = 13 \).

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Equation:**
   The equation given is \( 2x + 5 = 13 \). This is a linear equation in one variable, \( x \).

2. **Isolate the Variable:**
   To solve for \( x \), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We can do this by performing the same operation on both sides of the equation.

3. **Subtract 5 from Both Sides:**
   \[
   2x + 5 - 5 = 13 - 5
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   2x = 8
   \]

4. **Divide Both Sides by 2:**
   \[
   \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{8}{2}
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   x = 4
   \]

5. **Verify the Solution:**
   Substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies the equation:
   \[
   2(4) + 5 = 13
   \]
   Simplifying the left side gives:
   \[
   8 + 5 = 13
   \]
   \[
   13 = 13
   \]
   Since both sides of the equation are equal, our solution \( x = 4 \) is correct.

**Final Answer:**
The solution to the equation \( 2x + 5 = 13 \) is \( x = 4 \).

If "Sample math problem 440" refers to a different problem, please provide the specific details or context of the problem so that I can assist you accurately.
