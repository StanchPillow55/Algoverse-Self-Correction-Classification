To solve the problem, we need to determine how much chocolate Boris produces in the fourth week based on the production amounts from the first three weeks.

1. **First Week Production**:
   - Boris produces 8,000 bars of chocolate in the first week.

2. **Second Week Production**:
   - In the second week, Boris produces half as much as the first week.
   - Calculation: 
     \[
     \text{Second Week Production} = \frac{1}{2} \times 8,000 = 4,000 \text{ bars}
     \]

3. **Third Week Production**:
   - In the third week, Boris produces three times as much as the first week.
   - Calculation:
     \[
     \text{Third Week Production} = 3 \times 8,000 = 24,000 \text{ bars}
     \]

4. **Total Production for the First Three Weeks**:
   - Now, we can calculate the total production for the first three weeks:
   \[
   \text{Total Production (Weeks 1-3)} = 8,000 + 4,000 + 24,000
   \]
   - Calculation:
   \[
   \text{Total Production (Weeks 1-3)} = 36,000 \text{ bars}
   \]

5. **Total Monthly Production**:
   - Boris produces a total of 50,000 bars of chocolate each month. We need to find out how much he produces in the fourth week.
   - To find the fourth week production, we subtract the total production of the first three weeks from the total monthly production:
   \[
   \text{Fourth Week Production} = 50,000 - 36,000
   \]
   - Calculation:
   \[
   \text{Fourth Week Production} = 14,000 \text{ bars}
   \]

Thus, the amount of chocolate Boris produces in the fourth week is **14,000 bars**.

Final answer: **14,000 bars**.
