==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to determine how many chocolate bars Boris produces in the fourth week based on the production in the first three weeks.

1. **Production in the First Week**:
   - Boris produces 8,000 bars in the first week.

2. **Production in the Second Week**:
   - In the second week, Boris produces half as much as the first week.
   - Calculation: 
     \[
     \text{Production in the second week} = \frac{1}{2} \times 8,000 = 4,000 \text{ bars}
     \]

3. **Production in the Third Week**:
   - In the third week, Boris produces three times as much as the first week.
   - Calculation:
     \[
     \text{Production in the third week} = 3 \times 8,000 = 24,000 \text{ bars}
     \]

4. **Total Production for the First Three Weeks**:
   - Now, we can calculate the total production for the first three weeks:
   \[
   \text{Total production} = \text{Production in the first week} + \text{Production in the second week} + \text{Production in the third week}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total production} = 8,000 + 4,000 + 24,000 = 36,000 \text{ bars}
   \]

5. **Total Monthly Production**:
   - Boris produces a total of 50,000 bars each month. We need to find out how much he produces in the fourth week.
   - Calculation for the fourth week:
   \[
   \text{Production in the fourth week} = \text{Total monthly production} - \text{Total production for the first three weeks}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Production in the fourth week} = 50,000 - 36,000 = 14,000 \text{ bars}
   \]

Thus, the amount Boris produces in the fourth week is **14,000 bars**.

**Final Answer**: 14,000 bars.
