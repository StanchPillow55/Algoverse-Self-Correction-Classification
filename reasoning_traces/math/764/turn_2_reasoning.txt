Question ID: 764
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To find out how much Leila, Jack, and Chase spent together on their ingredients for the salad, we will calculate the total cost for each person and then sum those amounts.

1. **Leila's Cost:**
   - Leila buys 3 cucumbers.
   - The cost of each cucumber is $2.
   - Total cost for cucumbers = Number of cucumbers × Cost per cucumber
   \[
   \text{Total cost for cucumbers} = 3 \times 2 = 6 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Jack's Cost:**
   - Jack buys 5 tomatoes.
   - The cost of each tomato is $1.
   - Total cost for tomatoes = Number of tomatoes × Cost per tomato
   \[
   \text{Total cost for tomatoes} = 5 \times 1 = 5 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Chase's Cost:**
   - Chase buys 1 head of lettuce.
   - The cost of each head of lettuce is $3.
   - Total cost for lettuce = Number of heads of lettuce × Cost per head of lettuce
   \[
   \text{Total cost for lettuce} = 1 \times 3 = 3 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Total Cost:**
   - Now, we add the total costs for Leila, Jack, and Chase.
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = \text{Total cost for cucumbers} + \text{Total cost for tomatoes} + \text{Total cost for lettuce}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = 6 + 5 + 3 = 14 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Thus, the total amount spent by Leila, Jack, and Chase together to make a salad for the potluck is **$14**.
