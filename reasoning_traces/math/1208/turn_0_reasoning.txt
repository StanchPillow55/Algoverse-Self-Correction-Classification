To determine Trinity's profit from selling the magazines, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the Selling Price**: 
   Trinity sells the magazines at \( \frac{11}{8} \) of the price she bought them for. She bought the magazines for $72.

   To find the selling price, we calculate:
   \[
   \text{Selling Price} = \frac{11}{8} \times \text{Cost Price}
   \]
   Substituting the cost price:
   \[
   \text{Selling Price} = \frac{11}{8} \times 72
   \]

   Now, we perform the multiplication:
   \[
   \frac{11}{8} \times 72 = \frac{11 \times 72}{8}
   \]

   First, we simplify \( \frac{72}{8} \):
   \[
   \frac{72}{8} = 9
   \]

   Now, we multiply:
   \[
   11 \times 9 = 99
   \]

   Therefore, the selling price of the magazines is $99.

2. **Calculate the Profit**:
   Profit is calculated as the difference between the selling price and the cost price:
   \[
   \text{Profit} = \text{Selling Price} - \text{Cost Price}
   \]
   Substituting the values we found:
   \[
   \text{Profit} = 99 - 72
   \]

   Now, we perform the subtraction:
   \[
   99 - 72 = 27
   \]

3. **Final Answer**:
   Trinity's profit from selling the magazines is \( \boxed{27} \).
