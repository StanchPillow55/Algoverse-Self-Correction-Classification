To determine the total amount of oil Ellie needs to fix the bicycle, we need to consider the oil required for each part of the bike separately and then sum these amounts.

1. **Oil needed for the wheels:**
   - The bicycle has two wheels.
   - Ellie needs 10 ml of oil for each wheel.
   - Therefore, the total oil needed for the wheels is calculated as follows:
     \[
     \text{Oil for wheels} = 10 \, \text{ml/wheel} \times 2 \, \text{wheels} = 20 \, \text{ml}
     \]

2. **Oil needed for the rest of the bike:**
   - Ellie needs an additional 5 ml of oil for the rest of the bike.
   - Therefore, the oil needed for the rest of the bike is:
     \[
     \text{Oil for rest of the bike} = 5 \, \text{ml}
     \]

3. **Total oil needed:**
   - To find the total amount of oil needed, we add the oil required for the wheels and the oil required for the rest of the bike:
     \[
     \text{Total oil needed} = \text{Oil for wheels} + \text{Oil for rest of the bike} = 20 \, \text{ml} + 5 \, \text{ml} = 25 \, \text{ml}
     \]

Therefore, Ellie needs a total of 25 ml of oil to fix the bicycle.

**Final Answer: 25 ml**
