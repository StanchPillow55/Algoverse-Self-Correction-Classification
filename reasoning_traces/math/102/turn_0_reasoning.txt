To determine how many glasses of water John drinks in a week, we need to break down his drinking habits for both weekdays and weekends.

### Step 1: Calculate water consumption on weekdays

John drinks water with:
- Breakfast
- Lunch
- Dinner
- Before bed

This means he drinks water **4 times a day** on weekdays.

Since there are **5 weekdays** (Monday to Friday), we can calculate the total glasses of water he drinks during the weekdays as follows:

\[
\text{Glasses of water on weekdays} = \text{Glasses per day} \times \text{Number of weekdays}
\]
\[
\text{Glasses of water on weekdays} = 4 \text{ glasses/day} \times 5 \text{ days} = 20 \text{ glasses}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate water consumption on weekends

On weekends (Saturday and Sunday), John does not drink water with dinner; instead, he has soda. However, he still drinks water with breakfast, lunch, and before bed.

This means he drinks water **3 times a day** on weekends.

Since there are **2 weekend days**, we can calculate the total glasses of water he drinks during the weekends as follows:

\[
\text{Glasses of water on weekends} = \text{Glasses per day} \times \text{Number of weekend days}
\]
\[
\text{Glasses of water on weekends} = 3 \text{ glasses/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 6 \text{ glasses}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate total water consumption for the week

Now, we can find the total glasses of water John drinks in a week by adding the glasses consumed on weekdays and weekends:

\[
\text{Total glasses of water in a week} = \text{Glasses on weekdays} + \text{Glasses on weekends}
\]
\[
\text{Total glasses of water in a week} = 20 \text{ glasses} + 6 \text{ glasses} = 26 \text{ glasses}
\]

### Final Answer

John drinks a total of **26 glasses of water in a week**.
