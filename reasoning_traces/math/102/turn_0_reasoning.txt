To determine the total amount of oil Ellie needs to fix the bicycle, we will break down the problem step by step.

1. **Identify the components that need oil:**
   - The bicycle has 2 wheels.
   - Each wheel requires 10 ml of oil.
   - In addition to the wheels, the rest of the bike requires another 5 ml of oil.

2. **Calculate the oil needed for the wheels:**
   - Since there are 2 wheels and each wheel requires 10 ml of oil, we can calculate the total oil needed for the wheels as follows:
   \[
   \text{Oil for wheels} = \text{Number of wheels} \times \text{Oil per wheel} = 2 \times 10 \text{ ml} = 20 \text{ ml}
   \]

3. **Add the oil needed for the rest of the bike:**
   - The rest of the bike requires an additional 5 ml of oil. Therefore, we add this to the oil needed for the wheels:
   \[
   \text{Total oil needed} = \text{Oil for wheels} + \text{Oil for the rest of the bike} = 20 \text{ ml} + 5 \text{ ml} = 25 \text{ ml}
   \]

4. **Final Calculation:**
   - After performing the calculations, we find that Ellie needs a total of 25 ml of oil to fix the entire bicycle.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\text{Total oil needed} = 25 \text{ ml}
\]
