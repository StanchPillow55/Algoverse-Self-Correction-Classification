To solve the problem, we need to determine how many butterscotch candies Dale still needs to sell in order to sell all of his candy.

1. **Initial Order**: Dale initially ordered 100 butterscotch candies.

2. **Sales Made**: Dale sold 150 butterscotch candies. This means he has already sold more than he initially ordered.

3. **Additional Order**: After selling 150 candies, Dale ordered an additional 100 candies.

Now, let's calculate the total number of candies Dale has:

- **Total Candies Ordered**: 
  - Initial order: 100 candies
  - Additional order: 100 candies
  - Total = 100 + 100 = 200 candies

4. **Candies Sold**: Dale has sold 150 candies.

5. **Candies Remaining**: To find out how many candies Dale has left to sell, we subtract the number of candies sold from the total number of candies he has:

\[
\text{Candies Remaining} = \text{Total Candies} - \text{Candies Sold}
\]
\[
\text{Candies Remaining} = 200 - 150 = 50
\]

Thus, Dale still needs to sell **50 butterscotch candies** to sell all of his candy.

**Final Answer**: Dale still needs to sell 50 butterscotch candies.
