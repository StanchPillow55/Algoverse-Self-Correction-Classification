To solve the problem, we need to determine how many loaves of bread the bakers at the Beverly Hills Bakery had left after selling some and receiving some back from a grocery store.

1. **Initial Number of Loaves**: 
   The bakers started with 200 loaves of bread.

2. **Loaves Sold in the Morning**: 
   They sold 93 loaves in the morning.

3. **Loaves Sold in the Afternoon**: 
   They sold 39 loaves in the afternoon.

4. **Total Loaves Sold**: 
   To find the total number of loaves sold, we add the loaves sold in the morning and the afternoon:
   \[
   \text{Total Loaves Sold} = \text{Morning Sales} + \text{Afternoon Sales} = 93 + 39
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total Loaves Sold} = 132
   \]

5. **Loaves Returned by Grocery Store**: 
   The grocery store returned 6 unsold loaves.

6. **Calculating Remaining Loaves**: 
   To find out how many loaves are left, we start with the initial number of loaves, subtract the total loaves sold, and then add the loaves returned:
   \[
   \text{Remaining Loaves} = \text{Initial Loaves} - \text{Total Loaves Sold} + \text{Loaves Returned}
   \]
   Substituting the values we have:
   \[
   \text{Remaining Loaves} = 200 - 132 + 6
   \]

7. **Performing the Calculation**:
   First, we calculate \(200 - 132\):
   \[
   200 - 132 = 68
   \]
   Now, we add the loaves returned:
   \[
   68 + 6 = 74
   \]

Thus, the bakers at the Beverly Hills Bakery had **74 loaves of bread left** after the sales and returns.

**Final Answer**: 74 loaves of bread.
