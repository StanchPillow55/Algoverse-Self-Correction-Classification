==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to determine how long it will take Emily to peel and cook 90 shrimp. We will break this down into two parts: peeling the shrimp and cooking the shrimp.

### Step 1: Calculate the time to peel 90 shrimp

Emily can peel 6 shrimp per minute. To find out how long it takes her to peel 90 shrimp, we can use the formula:

\[
\text{Time to peel} = \frac{\text{Number of shrimp}}{\text{Shrimp peeled per minute}}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\text{Time to peel} = \frac{90 \text{ shrimp}}{6 \text{ shrimp/minute}} = 15 \text{ minutes}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the time to cook 90 shrimp

Emily can saut√© 30 shrimp in 10 minutes. To find out how long it takes her to cook 90 shrimp, we first determine the cooking rate:

\[
\text{Cooking rate} = \frac{30 \text{ shrimp}}{10 \text{ minutes}} = 3 \text{ shrimp/minute}
\]

Now, we can use this rate to find the time it takes to cook 90 shrimp:

\[
\text{Time to cook} = \frac{\text{Number of shrimp}}{\text{Shrimp cooked per minute}}
\]

Substituting the values:

\[
\text{Time to cook} = \frac{90 \text{ shrimp}}{3 \text{ shrimp/minute}} = 30 \text{ minutes}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the total time

Now, we add the time it takes to peel the shrimp and the time it takes to cook the shrimp:

\[
\text{Total time} = \text{Time to peel} + \text{Time to cook}
\]

Substituting the values we calculated:

\[
\text{Total time} = 15 \text{ minutes} + 30 \text{ minutes} = 45 \text{ minutes}
\]

### Final Answer

It will take Emily a total of **45 minutes** to peel and cook 90 shrimp.
