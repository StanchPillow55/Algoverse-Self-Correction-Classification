Question ID: superglue_436
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 436" refers to. Since the question itself is not provided, I'll demonstrate a general approach to solving a typical math problem by breaking down the steps involved in reasoning through a problem.

Let's assume "Sample reasoning question 436" is a math problem involving algebraic expressions. Hereâ€™s how we might approach solving it:

### Step 1: Understand the Problem
- **Read the problem carefully**: Ensure you understand what is being asked. Identify the knowns and unknowns.
- **Identify the type of problem**: Is it an equation to solve, an expression to simplify, or a word problem to translate into mathematical terms?

### Step 2: Develop a Plan
- **Choose a strategy**: Depending on the problem, decide whether to use algebraic manipulation, substitution, elimination, or another method.
- **Write down what you know**: List any formulas or properties that might be useful.

### Step 3: Execute the Plan
- **Perform calculations**: Carefully carry out the necessary algebraic steps.
- **Check each step**: Ensure each manipulation follows logically from the previous one.

### Step 4: Review and Conclude
- **Verify the solution**: Check if the solution makes sense in the context of the problem.
- **State the final answer**: Clearly write down the solution.

### Example Problem
Let's create a hypothetical problem to illustrate these steps:

**Problem**: Solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).

#### Step 1: Understand the Problem
- We need to find the value of \( x \) that makes the equation true.

#### Step 2: Develop a Plan
- We will isolate \( x \) by performing algebraic operations.

#### Step 3: Execute the Plan
1. Start with the equation:  
   \[
   2x + 3 = 11
   \]
2. Subtract 3 from both sides to isolate the term with \( x \):  
   \[
   2x + 3 - 3 = 11 - 3
   \]
   \[
   2x = 8
   \]
3. Divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( x \):  
   \[
   \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{8}{2}
   \]
   \[
   x = 4
   \]

#### Step 4: Review and Conclude
- **Verify**: Substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation to check:  
  \[
  2(4) + 3 = 8 + 3 = 11
  \]
  The left side equals the right side, so our solution is correct.
- **Final Answer**: \( x = 4 \)

This structured approach ensures that we systematically solve the problem and verify our solution. If "Sample reasoning question 436" refers to a specific problem, please provide the details, and I can apply this method to solve it.
