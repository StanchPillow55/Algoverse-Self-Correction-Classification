==================================================

To solve the problem, let's first understand what "Sample reasoning question 436" might entail. Since the problem statement is not specific, I'll assume it's a placeholder for a typical math problem. Let's consider a common type of math problem and solve it step by step.

**Problem:**
Let's assume the problem is to solve the quadratic equation: \( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \).

**Step 1: Identify the coefficients.**
For this example, let's assume:
- \( a = 1 \)
- \( b = -3 \)
- \( c = 2 \)

So, the equation becomes:
\[ x^2 - 3x + 2 = 0 \]

**Step 2: Factor the quadratic equation.**
We need to find two numbers that multiply to \( ac = 1 \times 2 = 2 \) and add to \( b = -3 \).

The numbers that satisfy these conditions are -1 and -2 because:
- \((-1) \times (-2) = 2\)
- \((-1) + (-2) = -3\)

**Step 3: Write the equation in factored form.**
Using the numbers found, we can write the equation as:
\[ (x - 1)(x - 2) = 0 \]

**Step 4: Solve for \( x \).**
Set each factor equal to zero and solve for \( x \):
1. \( x - 1 = 0 \) gives \( x = 1 \)
2. \( x - 2 = 0 \) gives \( x = 2 \)

**Step 5: Verify the solutions.**
Substitute \( x = 1 \) and \( x = 2 \) back into the original equation to ensure they satisfy it.

For \( x = 1 \):
\[ 1^2 - 3(1) + 2 = 1 - 3 + 2 = 0 \]

For \( x = 2 \):
\[ 2^2 - 3(2) + 2 = 4 - 6 + 2 = 0 \]

Both solutions satisfy the original equation.

**Final Answer:**
The solutions to the quadratic equation \( x^2 - 3x + 2 = 0 \) are \( x = 1 \) and \( x = 2 \).
