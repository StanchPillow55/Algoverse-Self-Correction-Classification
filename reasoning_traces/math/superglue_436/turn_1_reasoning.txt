==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 436" refers to. Since the problem statement is not specific, I'll assume it's a generic math problem that requires logical reasoning and step-by-step calculations. Let's create a hypothetical math problem and solve it.

**Hypothetical Problem:**

A company produces two types of widgets: Type A and Type B. The company sells Type A widgets for $50 each and Type B widgets for $70 each. Last month, the company sold a total of 200 widgets and made $11,000 in revenue. How many of each type of widget did the company sell?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( x \) be the number of Type A widgets sold.
   - Let \( y \) be the number of Type B widgets sold.

2. **Set Up Equations:**
   - From the problem, we know the total number of widgets sold is 200. Therefore, we have the equation:
     \[
     x + y = 200
     \]
   - We also know the total revenue from selling these widgets is $11,000. Therefore, we have the equation:
     \[
     50x + 70y = 11,000
     \]

3. **Solve the System of Equations:**
   - We have the system of equations:
     \[
     \begin{align*}
     x + y &= 200 \quad \text{(Equation 1)} \\
     50x + 70y &= 11,000 \quad \text{(Equation 2)}
     \end{align*}
     \]

   - Solve Equation 1 for \( y \):
     \[
     y = 200 - x
     \]

   - Substitute \( y = 200 - x \) into Equation 2:
     \[
     50x + 70(200 - x) = 11,000
     \]

   - Simplify and solve for \( x \):
     \[
     50x + 14,000 - 70x = 11,000
     \]
     \[
     -20x + 14,000 = 11,000
     \]
     \[
     -20x = 11,000 - 14,000
     \]
     \[
     -20x = -3,000
     \]
     \[
     x = \frac{-3,000}{-20}
     \]
     \[
     x = 150
     \]

   - Substitute \( x = 150 \) back into Equation 1 to find \( y \):
     \[
     150 + y = 200
     \]
     \[
     y = 200 - 150
     \]
     \[
     y = 50
     \]

4. **Verify the Solution:**
   - Check the total number of widgets:
     \[
     x + y = 150 + 50 = 200 \quad \text{(Correct)}
     \]
   - Check the total revenue:
     \[
     50(150) + 70(50) = 7,500 + 3,500 = 11,000 \quad \text{(Correct)}
     \]

**Final Answer:**

The company sold 150 Type A widgets and 50 Type B widgets.
