Question ID: 749
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to analyze the information given step by step.

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We have a total of 54 students.
   - These students are to be separated into 6 groups of equal size.
   - The activity requires 12 groups in total.

2. **Calculating the Size of Each Group:**
   - First, we need to determine how many students will be in each of the 6 groups.
   - To find the size of each group, we divide the total number of students by the number of groups:
     \[
     \text{Size of each group} = \frac{\text{Total students}}{\text{Number of groups}} = \frac{54}{6} = 9
     \]
   - Therefore, each of the 6 groups will have 9 students.

3. **Determining the Number of Groups Required:**
   - The problem states that the activity requires 12 groups.
   - We already have 6 groups formed from the 54 students.

4. **Calculating Additional Groups Needed:**
   - To find out how many more groups are needed, we subtract the number of groups we currently have from the number of groups required:
     \[
     \text{Additional groups needed} = \text{Required groups} - \text{Current groups} = 12 - 6 = 6
     \]

5. **Final Answer:**
   - Therefore, the number of additional groups needed to form is:
     \[
     \boxed{6}
     \] 

This concludes the solution, showing all calculations and reasoning clearly.
