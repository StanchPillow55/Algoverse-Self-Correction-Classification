==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to determine how many groups are needed to accommodate fifty-four students when they are separated into groups of equal size.

1. **Determine the size of each group**:
   We have 54 students and we want to separate them into 6 groups of equal size. To find the size of each group, we divide the total number of students by the number of groups:

   \[
   \text{Size of each group} = \frac{\text{Total students}}{\text{Number of groups}} = \frac{54}{6} = 9
   \]

   So, each group will have 9 students.

2. **Determine the number of groups needed for the activity**:
   The problem states that the activity requires 12 groups. We need to find out how many more groups are needed beyond the 6 groups we initially calculated.

3. **Calculate the total number of groups needed**:
   Since the activity requires 12 groups, we need to compare this with the 6 groups we can form with the 54 students.

4. **Calculate the difference**:
   To find out how many more groups are needed, we subtract the number of groups we can form from the number of groups required:

   \[
   \text{Additional groups needed} = \text{Required groups} - \text{Current groups} = 12 - 6 = 6
   \]

Thus, we need 6 more groups to meet the requirement of 12 groups.

**Final Answer**: 6 more groups are needed.
