Question ID: 749
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to analyze the information given step by step.

1. **Understanding the number of students and groups**:
   - We have a total of 54 students.
   - We want to separate these students into groups of equal size.
   - The problem states that we need to form 12 groups.

2. **Calculating the size of each group**:
   - If we are to form 12 groups with 54 students, we can calculate the size of each group by dividing the total number of students by the number of groups:
     \[
     \text{Size of each group} = \frac{\text{Total students}}{\text{Number of groups}} = \frac{54}{12}
     \]
   - Performing the division:
     \[
     \frac{54}{12} = 4.5
     \]
   - This means that if we were to form 12 groups, each group would have 4.5 students, which is not possible since we cannot have half a student in a group.

3. **Finding the maximum number of groups that can be formed**:
   - Since we cannot have half students in a group, we need to determine how many groups can be formed with whole students.
   - To find the maximum number of groups with equal whole students, we can divide the total number of students by a whole number:
     - If we try 6 groups (as mentioned in the problem):
       \[
       \text{Size of each group} = \frac{54}{6} = 9
       \]
     - This works because each group can have 9 students.

4. **Determining how many more groups are needed**:
   - The problem states that we need 12 groups.
   - We already have the capacity to form 6 groups with 54 students.
   - To find out how many more groups are needed, we subtract the number of groups we can currently form from the number of groups required:
     \[
     \text{Additional groups needed} = \text{Required groups} - \text{Current groups} = 12 - 6 = 6
     \]

5. **Final answer**:
   - Therefore, the number of additional groups needed to reach a total of 12 groups is 6.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{6}
\]
