==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to determine how many bottles of water John drinks while he is solving an extreme sudoku puzzle.

1. **Determine the time taken for an extreme sudoku puzzle:**
   - A normal sudoku takes 45 minutes.
   - An extreme sudoku takes 4 times as long as a normal sudoku.
   - Therefore, the time taken for an extreme sudoku is:
     \[
     4 \times 45 \text{ minutes} = 180 \text{ minutes}
     \]

2. **Calculate how many bottles of water John drinks in that time:**
   - John drinks a bottle of water every half hour (30 minutes).
   - To find out how many half-hour intervals are in 180 minutes, we divide 180 by 30:
     \[
     \frac{180 \text{ minutes}}{30 \text{ minutes/bottle}} = 6 \text{ bottles}
     \]

3. **Final answer:**
   - Therefore, the total number of bottles of water John drinks while solving an extreme sudoku puzzle is:
     \[
     \boxed{6}
     \]
