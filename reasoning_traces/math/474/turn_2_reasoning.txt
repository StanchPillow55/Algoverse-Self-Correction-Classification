Question ID: 474
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine how many members ordered orange juice. We'll break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the number of members who ordered lemon juice:**

   The problem states that two-fifths of the club members ordered lemon juice. The club has 30 members in total.

   \[
   \text{Number of members who ordered lemon juice} = \frac{2}{5} \times 30 = 12
   \]

2. **Calculate the remaining members after lemon juice orders:**

   After accounting for the members who ordered lemon juice, we subtract this number from the total number of members.

   \[
   \text{Remaining members} = 30 - 12 = 18
   \]

3. **Determine the number of members who ordered mango juice:**

   One-third of the remaining members ordered mango juice. We have 18 remaining members.

   \[
   \text{Number of members who ordered mango juice} = \frac{1}{3} \times 18 = 6
   \]

4. **Calculate the number of members who ordered orange juice:**

   The rest of the members ordered orange juice. We subtract the number of members who ordered mango juice from the remaining members.

   \[
   \text{Number of members who ordered orange juice} = 18 - 6 = 12
   \]

Therefore, the number of members who ordered orange juice is 12.

**Final Answer: 12 members ordered orange juice.**
