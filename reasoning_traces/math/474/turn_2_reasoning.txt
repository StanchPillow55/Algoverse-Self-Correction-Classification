Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine how many members ordered orange juice based on the given conditions. Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the number of members who ordered lemon juice:**

   The problem states that two-fifths of the club members ordered lemon juice. The club has 30 members in total.

   \[
   \text{Number of members who ordered lemon juice} = \frac{2}{5} \times 30 = 12
   \]

2. **Calculate the remaining members after lemon juice orders:**

   After accounting for the members who ordered lemon juice, we subtract this number from the total number of members.

   \[
   \text{Remaining members} = 30 - 12 = 18
   \]

3. **Determine the number of members who ordered mango juice:**

   One-third of the remaining members ordered mango juice. We have 18 members remaining after the lemon juice orders.

   \[
   \text{Number of members who ordered mango juice} = \frac{1}{3} \times 18 = 6
   \]

4. **Calculate the number of members who ordered orange juice:**

   The rest of the members, after accounting for those who ordered lemon and mango juices, ordered orange juice. We subtract the number of members who ordered mango juice from the remaining members.

   \[
   \text{Number of members who ordered orange juice} = 18 - 6 = 12
   \]

Thus, the number of members who ordered orange juice is 12.

**Final Answer: 12 members ordered orange juice.**
