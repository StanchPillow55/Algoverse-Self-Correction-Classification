To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the number of members who ordered lemon juice:**
   The total number of members in the club is 30. According to the problem, two-fifths of them ordered lemon juice.

   \[
   \text{Number of members who ordered lemon juice} = \frac{2}{5} \times 30
   \]

   Calculating this:

   \[
   \frac{2}{5} \times 30 = \frac{60}{5} = 12
   \]

   So, 12 members ordered lemon juice.

2. **Calculate the remaining members after lemon juice orders:**
   To find out how many members are left after the lemon juice orders, we subtract the number of members who ordered lemon juice from the total number of members.

   \[
   \text{Remaining members} = 30 - 12 = 18
   \]

   Therefore, there are 18 members remaining who did not order lemon juice.

3. **Determine the number of members who ordered mango juice:**
   One-third of the remaining members ordered mango juice. We need to calculate one-third of the 18 remaining members.

   \[
   \text{Number of members who ordered mango juice} = \frac{1}{3} \times 18
   \]

   Calculating this:

   \[
   \frac{1}{3} \times 18 = 6
   \]

   So, 6 members ordered mango juice.

4. **Calculate the number of members who ordered orange juice:**
   Now, we need to find out how many members ordered orange juice. We do this by subtracting the number of members who ordered lemon juice and mango juice from the total number of members.

   \[
   \text{Number of members who ordered orange juice} = \text{Total members} - (\text{Members who ordered lemon juice} + \text{Members who ordered mango juice})
   \]

   Plugging in the numbers:

   \[
   \text{Number of members who ordered orange juice} = 30 - (12 + 6)
   \]

   Simplifying this:

   \[
   \text{Number of members who ordered orange juice} = 30 - 18 = 12
   \]

5. **Final answer:**
   Therefore, the number of members who ordered orange juice is \( \boxed{12} \).
