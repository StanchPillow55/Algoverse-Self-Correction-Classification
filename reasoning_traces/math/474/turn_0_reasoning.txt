To solve this problem, we need to determine how many members of the club ordered orange juice. We'll break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the number of members who ordered lemon juice:**

   The problem states that two-fifths of the 30 members ordered lemon juice. To find this number, we calculate:

   \[
   \frac{2}{5} \times 30 = \frac{60}{5} = 12
   \]

   So, 12 members ordered lemon juice.

2. **Find the number of remaining members after lemon juice orders:**

   Since 12 members ordered lemon juice, we subtract this from the total number of members to find out how many members are left:

   \[
   30 - 12 = 18
   \]

   Thus, 18 members did not order lemon juice.

3. **Determine the number of members who ordered mango juice:**

   One-third of the remaining 18 members ordered mango juice. We calculate this as follows:

   \[
   \frac{1}{3} \times 18 = \frac{18}{3} = 6
   \]

   So, 6 members ordered mango juice.

4. **Find the number of members who ordered orange juice:**

   The rest of the members, after accounting for those who ordered lemon and mango juices, ordered orange juice. We subtract the number of members who ordered mango juice from the remaining members:

   \[
   18 - 6 = 12
   \]

   Therefore, 12 members ordered orange juice.

**Final Answer:**

12 members ordered orange juice.
