==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to determine the total number of students at a certain grade level given that three-fourths of them have desktop computers and that 20 students do not have desktop computers.

Let's denote the total number of students at that grade level as \( x \).

According to the problem, three-fourths of the students have desktop computers. This means that the number of students who have desktop computers can be expressed as:

\[
\frac{3}{4}x
\]

Since we know that 20 students do not have desktop computers, we can express the number of students without desktop computers as:

\[
x - \frac{3}{4}x
\]

Now, simplifying the expression for students without desktop computers:

\[
x - \frac{3}{4}x = \frac{1}{4}x
\]

We are given that the number of students without desktop computers is 20. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

\[
\frac{1}{4}x = 20
\]

To solve for \( x \), we can multiply both sides of the equation by 4:

\[
x = 20 \times 4
\]

Calculating the right side:

\[
x = 80
\]

Thus, the total number of students at that grade level is \( \boxed{80} \).

To verify, we can check the calculations:
- If there are 80 students in total, then the number of students with desktop computers is:

\[
\frac{3}{4} \times 80 = 60
\]

- The number of students without desktop computers is:

\[
80 - 60 = 20
\]

This matches the information given in the problem. Therefore, the solution is confirmed, and the final answer is \( \boxed{80} \).
