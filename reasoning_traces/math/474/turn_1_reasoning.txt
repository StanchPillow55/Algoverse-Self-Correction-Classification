==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine how many members of the club ordered orange juice. Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine how many members ordered lemon juice:**

   The problem states that two-fifths of the 30 members ordered lemon juice. To find this number, we calculate:

   \[
   \frac{2}{5} \times 30 = 12
   \]

   So, 12 members ordered lemon juice.

2. **Calculate the remaining members after lemon juice orders:**

   Since 12 members ordered lemon juice, we subtract this from the total number of members to find out how many members are left:

   \[
   30 - 12 = 18
   \]

   Therefore, 18 members did not order lemon juice.

3. **Determine how many of the remaining members ordered mango juice:**

   According to the problem, one-third of the remaining members ordered mango juice. We calculate:

   \[
   \frac{1}{3} \times 18 = 6
   \]

   So, 6 members ordered mango juice.

4. **Calculate the remaining members after mango juice orders:**

   After accounting for those who ordered mango juice, we subtract this number from the remaining members:

   \[
   18 - 6 = 12
   \]

   Therefore, 12 members ordered orange juice.

5. **Conclusion:**

   The number of members who ordered orange juice is 12.

Thus, the final answer is that 12 members ordered orange juice.
