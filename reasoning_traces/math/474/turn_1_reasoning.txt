==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine how many members of the club ordered orange juice. Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the number of members who ordered lemon juice:**
   - The club has 30 members in total.
   - Two-fifths of the members ordered lemon juice.
   - Calculate the number of members who ordered lemon juice:
     \[
     \frac{2}{5} \times 30 = \frac{60}{5} = 12
     \]
   - So, 12 members ordered lemon juice.

2. **Calculate the remaining members after those who ordered lemon juice:**
   - Subtract the number of members who ordered lemon juice from the total number of members:
     \[
     30 - 12 = 18
     \]
   - Therefore, 18 members did not order lemon juice.

3. **Determine the number of members who ordered mango juice:**
   - One-third of the remaining members ordered mango juice.
   - Calculate the number of members who ordered mango juice:
     \[
     \frac{1}{3} \times 18 = \frac{18}{3} = 6
     \]
   - So, 6 members ordered mango juice.

4. **Calculate the number of members who ordered orange juice:**
   - The rest of the members ordered orange juice.
   - Subtract the number of members who ordered mango juice from the remaining members:
     \[
     18 - 6 = 12
     \]
   - Therefore, 12 members ordered orange juice.

**Final Answer:**
12 members ordered orange juice.
