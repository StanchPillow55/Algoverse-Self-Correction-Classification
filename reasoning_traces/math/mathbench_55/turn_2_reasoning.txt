==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 55," we need to first understand what the problem is asking. However, the problem statement "Sample math problem 55" is not specific and does not provide any details or context. Therefore, I will assume that this is a placeholder for a specific math problem that you would like to solve.

Since the problem is not defined, I will create a hypothetical math problem involving the number 55 and solve it step by step. Let's assume the problem is as follows:

**Problem:**
Calculate the sum of all even numbers from 1 to 55.

**Solution:**

To solve this problem, we need to identify all even numbers between 1 and 55 and then calculate their sum.

**Step 1: Identify the even numbers between 1 and 55.**

Even numbers are integers that are divisible by 2. The even numbers between 1 and 55 are:
2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, 24, 26, 28, 30, 32, 34, 36, 38, 40, 42, 44, 46, 48, 50, 52, 54.

**Step 2: Count the number of even numbers.**

The sequence of even numbers from 2 to 54 is an arithmetic sequence where the first term \(a_1 = 2\) and the common difference \(d = 2\).

The last term \(a_n = 54\).

To find the number of terms \(n\), we use the formula for the \(n\)-th term of an arithmetic sequence:
\[ a_n = a_1 + (n-1) \cdot d \]

Substitute the known values:
\[ 54 = 2 + (n-1) \cdot 2 \]

Solve for \(n\):
\[ 54 = 2 + 2n - 2 \]
\[ 54 = 2n \]
\[ n = \frac{54}{2} = 27 \]

There are 27 even numbers between 1 and 55.

**Step 3: Calculate the sum of the even numbers.**

The sum \(S_n\) of the first \(n\) terms of an arithmetic sequence is given by:
\[ S_n = \frac{n}{2} \cdot (a_1 + a_n) \]

Substitute the known values:
\[ S_{27} = \frac{27}{2} \cdot (2 + 54) \]
\[ S_{27} = \frac{27}{2} \cdot 56 \]
\[ S_{27} = 27 \cdot 28 \]
\[ S_{27} = 756 \]

**Final Answer:**

The sum of all even numbers from 1 to 55 is 756.
