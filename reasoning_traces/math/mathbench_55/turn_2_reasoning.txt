Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 55," we need to first understand what the problem is asking. However, the problem statement is incomplete as it stands. Let's assume that "Sample math problem 55" refers to a specific math problem that involves basic arithmetic or algebraic operations. Since the problem is not explicitly stated, I'll create a hypothetical problem based on common math problem types.

**Hypothetical Problem:**
"Calculate the sum of the first 55 positive integers."

To solve this problem, we can use the formula for the sum of the first \( n \) positive integers, which is given by:

\[
S_n = \frac{n(n + 1)}{2}
\]

where \( n \) is the number of terms. In this case, \( n = 55 \).

**Step-by-step Solution:**

1. **Identify the formula:**
   The formula for the sum of the first \( n \) positive integers is:
   \[
   S_n = \frac{n(n + 1)}{2}
   \]

2. **Substitute \( n = 55 \) into the formula:**
   \[
   S_{55} = \frac{55(55 + 1)}{2}
   \]

3. **Calculate \( 55 + 1 \):**
   \[
   55 + 1 = 56
   \]

4. **Substitute back into the formula:**
   \[
   S_{55} = \frac{55 \times 56}{2}
   \]

5. **Calculate \( 55 \times 56 \):**
   \[
   55 \times 56 = 3080
   \]

6. **Divide by 2 to find the sum:**
   \[
   S_{55} = \frac{3080}{2} = 1540
   \]

Therefore, the sum of the first 55 positive integers is \( 1540 \).

**Final Answer:**
The sum of the first 55 positive integers is \( 1540 \).
