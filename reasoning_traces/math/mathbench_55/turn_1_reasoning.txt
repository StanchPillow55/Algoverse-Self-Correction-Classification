==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 55," we first need to understand what the problem is asking. However, the phrase "Sample math problem 55" does not provide specific details about the problem itself. It seems like a placeholder or reference to a specific problem that is not fully described here.

To proceed, I'll assume that "Sample math problem 55" refers to a typical math problem that might involve basic arithmetic, algebra, geometry, or another area of mathematics. Since I don't have the specific details of the problem, I'll create a hypothetical problem and solve it step by step.

### Hypothetical Problem:
Let's assume "Sample math problem 55" is an algebra problem that asks us to solve the following equation for \( x \):

\[ 3x + 5 = 20 \]

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Understand the Equation:**
   The equation \( 3x + 5 = 20 \) is a linear equation in one variable, \( x \). Our goal is to isolate \( x \) on one side of the equation.

2. **Subtract 5 from Both Sides:**
   To begin isolating \( x \), we first eliminate the constant term on the left side by subtracting 5 from both sides of the equation:

   \[
   3x + 5 - 5 = 20 - 5
   \]

   Simplifying both sides gives:

   \[
   3x = 15
   \]

3. **Divide Both Sides by 3:**
   Next, we divide both sides of the equation by 3 to solve for \( x \):

   \[
   \frac{3x}{3} = \frac{15}{3}
   \]

   Simplifying both sides gives:

   \[
   x = 5
   \]

4. **Verify the Solution:**
   To ensure our solution is correct, we substitute \( x = 5 \) back into the original equation:

   \[
   3(5) + 5 = 20
   \]

   Simplifying the left side:

   \[
   15 + 5 = 20
   \]

   Since both sides of the equation are equal, our solution \( x = 5 \) is verified.

### Final Answer:
The solution to the equation \( 3x + 5 = 20 \) is \( x = 5 \).

If "Sample math problem 55" refers to a different problem, please provide the specific details or context, and I will be happy to solve it accordingly.
