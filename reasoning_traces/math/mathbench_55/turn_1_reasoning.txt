Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 55," we need to first understand what the problem is asking. However, the problem statement is not clear from the given text. It seems like "Sample math problem 55" is a placeholder or a reference to a specific problem that is not provided here. 

To proceed, let's assume a hypothetical math problem that involves the number 55. For example, let's solve a problem involving basic arithmetic operations with the number 55.

**Hypothetical Problem:**
Calculate the result of the following expression: \( 55 + 45 - 30 \times 2 \div 5 \).

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Identify the Order of Operations:**
   According to the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS), we need to perform calculations in the following order:
   - Parentheses/Brackets
   - Exponents/Orders (i.e., powers and roots, etc.)
   - Multiplication and Division (from left to right)
   - Addition and Subtraction (from left to right)

2. **Perform Multiplication and Division:**
   The expression is \( 55 + 45 - 30 \times 2 \div 5 \).

   - First, perform the multiplication: \( 30 \times 2 = 60 \).
   - Next, perform the division: \( 60 \div 5 = 12 \).

   Now, the expression simplifies to: \( 55 + 45 - 12 \).

3. **Perform Addition and Subtraction:**
   - First, perform the addition: \( 55 + 45 = 100 \).
   - Next, perform the subtraction: \( 100 - 12 = 88 \).

**Final Answer:**
The result of the expression \( 55 + 45 - 30 \times 2 \div 5 \) is \( 88 \).

This hypothetical problem demonstrates the process of solving a math problem involving the number 55 with basic arithmetic operations. If you have a specific problem labeled as "Sample math problem 55," please provide the details so I can solve it accurately.
