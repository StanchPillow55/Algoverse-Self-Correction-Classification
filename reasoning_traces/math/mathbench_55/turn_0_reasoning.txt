==================================================

It seems like the problem statement is incomplete. "Sample math problem 55" doesn't provide enough information to solve a specific math problem. However, I can guide you through a generic approach to solving a math problem if you provide more details or context. 

For now, let's assume a hypothetical math problem and solve it step by step:

**Hypothetical Problem:**
Solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   We need to solve for the variable \( x \) in the linear equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).

2. **Isolate the Variable:**
   To solve for \( x \), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We can do this by performing operations that will leave \( x \) by itself.

3. **Subtract 3 from Both Sides:**
   \[
   2x + 3 - 3 = 11 - 3
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   2x = 8
   \]

4. **Divide Both Sides by 2:**
   \[
   \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{8}{2}
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   x = 4
   \]

5. **Verify the Solution:**
   Substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies the equation:
   \[
   2(4) + 3 = 11
   \]
   Simplifying the left side gives:
   \[
   8 + 3 = 11
   \]
   \[
   11 = 11
   \]
   Since both sides of the equation are equal, our solution \( x = 4 \) is correct.

**Final Answer:**
The solution to the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \) is \( x = 4 \).

If you have a specific problem in mind, please provide the details, and I will be happy to solve it for you!
