==================================================

To solve the problem, we first need to understand what "Sample math problem 55" refers to. Since there is no specific problem statement provided, I'll assume this is a placeholder for a typical math problem. Let's create a sample problem based on common math topics and solve it step by step.

**Sample Problem:**

Calculate the sum of the first 55 positive integers.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   We need to find the sum of the first 55 positive integers. The sequence of the first 55 positive integers is: 1, 2, 3, ..., 55.

2. **Identify the Formula:**
   The sum of the first \( n \) positive integers can be calculated using the formula:
   \[
   S_n = \frac{n(n + 1)}{2}
   \]
   where \( S_n \) is the sum of the first \( n \) integers.

3. **Substitute the Values:**
   Here, \( n = 55 \). Substitute 55 into the formula:
   \[
   S_{55} = \frac{55(55 + 1)}{2}
   \]

4. **Calculate Inside the Parentheses:**
   First, calculate \( 55 + 1 \):
   \[
   55 + 1 = 56
   \]

5. **Multiply the Terms:**
   Next, multiply 55 by 56:
   \[
   55 \times 56 = 3080
   \]

6. **Divide by 2:**
   Finally, divide the product by 2 to find the sum:
   \[
   \frac{3080}{2} = 1540
   \]

7. **Conclusion:**
   The sum of the first 55 positive integers is 1540.

**Final Answer:**

The sum of the first 55 positive integers is 1540.
