==================================================

To solve the problem, we will follow these steps:

1. **Determine the initial number of pencils and pens**: 
   Catherine has an equal number of pencils and pens. We know she has 60 pens. Therefore, she also has 60 pencils.

   \[
   \text{Number of pens} = 60
   \]
   \[
   \text{Number of pencils} = 60
   \]

2. **Calculate the total number of pens and pencils given away**:
   Catherine gives away 8 pens and 6 pencils to each of her 7 friends. We need to calculate the total number of pens and pencils given away.

   - Total pens given away:
   \[
   \text{Total pens given away} = 8 \text{ pens/friend} \times 7 \text{ friends} = 56 \text{ pens}
   \]

   - Total pencils given away:
   \[
   \text{Total pencils given away} = 6 \text{ pencils/friend} \times 7 \text{ friends} = 42 \text{ pencils}
   \]

3. **Calculate the remaining number of pens and pencils**:
   Now we will subtract the total number of pens and pencils given away from the initial amounts.

   - Remaining pens:
   \[
   \text{Remaining pens} = \text{Initial pens} - \text{Total pens given away} = 60 - 56 = 4 \text{ pens}
   \]

   - Remaining pencils:
   \[
   \text{Remaining pencils} = \text{Initial pencils} - \text{Total pencils given away} = 60 - 42 = 18 \text{ pencils}
   \]

4. **Final answer**:
   Catherine has 4 pens and 18 pencils left.

Thus, the final answer is:
- **Pens left**: 4
- **Pencils left**: 18

In conclusion, Catherine has **4 pens and 18 pencils left**.
