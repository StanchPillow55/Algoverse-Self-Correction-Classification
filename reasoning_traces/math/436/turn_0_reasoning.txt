==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine how many pens and pencils Catherine has left after giving some to her friends.

**Step 1: Determine the initial number of pens and pencils.**

Catherine had an equal number of pencils and pens. We know she had 60 pens, so she also had 60 pencils initially.

**Step 2: Calculate the total number of pens and pencils given away.**

Catherine gave 8 pens and 6 pencils to each of her 7 friends. We need to calculate the total number of pens and pencils given away:

- Pens given away: \(8 \text{ pens/friend} \times 7 \text{ friends} = 56 \text{ pens}\)
- Pencils given away: \(6 \text{ pencils/friend} \times 7 \text{ friends} = 42 \text{ pencils}\)

**Step 3: Calculate the number of pens and pencils Catherine has left.**

Now, subtract the number of pens and pencils given away from the initial amount:

- Pens left: \(60 \text{ initial pens} - 56 \text{ pens given away} = 4 \text{ pens left}\)
- Pencils left: \(60 \text{ initial pencils} - 42 \text{ pencils given away} = 18 \text{ pencils left}\)

**Final Answer:**

Catherine has 4 pens and 18 pencils left.
