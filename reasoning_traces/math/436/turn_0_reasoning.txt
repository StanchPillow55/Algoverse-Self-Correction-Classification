To solve the problem, we need to determine how much cake remains after Rory and her mom each take a piece from the original cake.

1. **Determine the weight of the original cake**: 
   The cake weighs 20 ounces.

2. **Determine the number of pieces cut**: 
   Rory cuts the cake into 8 pieces.

3. **Calculate the weight of each piece**: 
   To find the weight of each piece, we divide the total weight of the cake by the number of pieces:
   \[
   \text{Weight of each piece} = \frac{\text{Total weight of cake}}{\text{Number of pieces}} = \frac{20 \text{ ounces}}{8} = 2.5 \text{ ounces}
   \]

4. **Determine how many pieces are taken**: 
   Rory and her mom each take one piece, so together they take:
   \[
   \text{Total pieces taken} = 2 \text{ pieces}
   \]

5. **Calculate the total weight of the pieces taken**: 
   To find the total weight of the pieces taken, we multiply the weight of each piece by the number of pieces taken:
   \[
   \text{Total weight of pieces taken} = \text{Weight of each piece} \times \text{Total pieces taken} = 2.5 \text{ ounces} \times 2 = 5 \text{ ounces}
   \]

6. **Calculate the remaining weight of the cake**: 
   To find the remaining weight of the cake, we subtract the total weight of the pieces taken from the original weight of the cake:
   \[
   \text{Remaining weight of cake} = \text{Total weight of cake} - \text{Total weight of pieces taken} = 20 \text{ ounces} - 5 \text{ ounces} = 15 \text{ ounces}
   \]

Thus, the remaining cake weighs **15 ounces**.

Final answer: **15 ounces**.
