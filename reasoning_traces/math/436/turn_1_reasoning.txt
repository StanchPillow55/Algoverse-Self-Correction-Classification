==================================================

Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial Count of Pens and Pencils**:
   - Catherine has an equal number of pencils and pens.
   - She has 60 pens.
   - Therefore, she also has 60 pencils.

2. **Total Number of Friends**:
   - Catherine has 7 friends.

3. **Items Given to Each Friend**:
   - She gives each friend 8 pens and 6 pencils.

4. **Total Items Given to All Friends**:
   - Total pens given to friends:
     \[
     8 \text{ pens/friend} \times 7 \text{ friends} = 56 \text{ pens}
     \]
   - Total pencils given to friends:
     \[
     6 \text{ pencils/friend} \times 7 \text{ friends} = 42 \text{ pencils}
     \]

5. **Calculating Remaining Pens and Pencils**:
   - Remaining pens:
     \[
     60 \text{ pens} - 56 \text{ pens} = 4 \text{ pens}
     \]
   - Remaining pencils:
     \[
     60 \text{ pencils} - 42 \text{ pencils} = 18 \text{ pencils}
     \]

6. **Final Count**:
   - Catherine has 4 pens left and 18 pencils left.

Thus, the final answer is:
- **Pens left**: 4
- **Pencils left**: 18

In conclusion, Catherine has **4 pens and 18 pencils left**.
