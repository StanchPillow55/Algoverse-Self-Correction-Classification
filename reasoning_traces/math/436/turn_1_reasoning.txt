Question ID: 436
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine how many pens and pencils Catherine has left after giving some to her friends. Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Step 1: Determine Initial Quantities
Catherine had an equal number of pencils and pens. We know she had 60 pens, so she also had 60 pencils.

- Initial number of pens = 60
- Initial number of pencils = 60

### Step 2: Calculate the Number of Pens and Pencils Given Away
Catherine gave 8 pens and 6 pencils to each of her 7 friends.

- Number of pens given to each friend = 8
- Number of pencils given to each friend = 6
- Number of friends = 7

Calculate the total number of pens given away:
\[ \text{Total pens given} = 8 \times 7 = 56 \]

Calculate the total number of pencils given away:
\[ \text{Total pencils given} = 6 \times 7 = 42 \]

### Step 3: Calculate the Remaining Pens and Pencils
Subtract the total number of pens and pencils given away from the initial quantities to find out how many are left.

- Remaining pens:
  \[ \text{Remaining pens} = 60 - 56 = 4 \]

- Remaining pencils:
  \[ \text{Remaining pencils} = 60 - 42 = 18 \]

### Conclusion
After giving away pens and pencils to her friends, Catherine has 4 pens and 18 pencils left.

### Final Answer
Catherine has 4 pens and 18 pencils left.
