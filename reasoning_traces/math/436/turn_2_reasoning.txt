Question ID: 436
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine how many pens and pencils Catherine has left after giving some to her friends.

### Step 1: Determine Initial Quantities
Catherine had an equal number of pencils and pens. We know she had 60 pens, so she also had 60 pencils.

### Step 2: Calculate the Total Number of Items Given Away
Catherine gave 8 pens and 6 pencils to each of her 7 friends.

- **Pens given away**: 
  \[
  8 \text{ pens/friend} \times 7 \text{ friends} = 56 \text{ pens}
  \]

- **Pencils given away**: 
  \[
  6 \text{ pencils/friend} \times 7 \text{ friends} = 42 \text{ pencils}
  \]

### Step 3: Calculate the Remaining Items
Now, we subtract the number of pens and pencils given away from the initial quantities.

- **Pens remaining**:
  \[
  60 \text{ initial pens} - 56 \text{ pens given away} = 4 \text{ pens remaining}
  \]

- **Pencils remaining**:
  \[
  60 \text{ initial pencils} - 42 \text{ pencils given away} = 18 \text{ pencils remaining}
  \]

### Conclusion
Catherine has 4 pens and 18 pencils left after giving some to her friends.

Thus, the final answer is:
- **Pens left**: 4
- **Pencils left**: 18
