Question ID: 436
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we will follow these steps:

1. **Determine the initial number of pencils and pens**:
   - Catherine has an equal number of pencils and pens.
   - She has 60 pens.
   - Therefore, she also has 60 pencils.

2. **Calculate the total number of pens and pencils given away**:
   - Catherine gives away 8 pens and 6 pencils to each of her 7 friends.
   - First, we calculate the total number of pens given away:
     \[
     \text{Total pens given away} = 8 \text{ pens/friend} \times 7 \text{ friends} = 56 \text{ pens}
     \]
   - Next, we calculate the total number of pencils given away:
     \[
     \text{Total pencils given away} = 6 \text{ pencils/friend} \times 7 \text{ friends} = 42 \text{ pencils}
     \]

3. **Calculate the remaining number of pens and pencils**:
   - Now we subtract the total given away from the initial amounts:
   - Remaining pens:
     \[
     \text{Remaining pens} = \text{Initial pens} - \text{Total pens given away} = 60 - 56 = 4 \text{ pens}
     \]
   - Remaining pencils:
     \[
     \text{Remaining pencils} = \text{Initial pencils} - \text{Total pencils given away} = 60 - 42 = 18 \text{ pencils}
     \]

4. **Final answer**:
   - Catherine has 4 pens and 18 pencils left.

Thus, the final answer is:
- **Catherine has 4 pens and 18 pencils left.**
