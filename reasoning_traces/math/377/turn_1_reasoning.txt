Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine the total length of the three CDs that James buys. Let's break down the information given and calculate the total length step by step.

1. **Identify the lengths of the CDs:**
   - We know that James buys 3 CDs.
   - Two of the CDs are each 1.5 hours long.
   - The last CD is twice as long as one of the 1.5-hour CDs.

2. **Calculate the length of the last CD:**
   - Since the last CD is twice as long as one of the 1.5-hour CDs, we calculate its length as follows:
     \[
     \text{Length of the last CD} = 2 \times 1.5 \text{ hours} = 3 \text{ hours}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total length of all CDs:**
   - We have two CDs that are each 1.5 hours long, so their combined length is:
     \[
     2 \times 1.5 \text{ hours} = 3 \text{ hours}
     \]
   - Adding the length of the last CD, which is 3 hours, we find the total length:
     \[
     \text{Total length} = 3 \text{ hours (from the first two CDs)} + 3 \text{ hours (from the last CD)} = 6 \text{ hours}
     \]

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The combined length of the CDs is 6 hours.

Therefore, the combined length of the CDs is \(\boxed{6}\) hours.
