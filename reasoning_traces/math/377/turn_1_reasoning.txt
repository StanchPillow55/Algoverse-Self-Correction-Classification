Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to determine the total length of the three CDs that James buys. Let's break down the information given and calculate step by step.

1. **Identify the lengths of the CDs:**
   - James buys 3 CDs.
   - Two of the CDs are each 1.5 hours long.
   - The third CD is twice as long as each of the first two CDs.

2. **Calculate the length of the third CD:**
   - Since each of the first two CDs is 1.5 hours long, the length of the third CD is twice that length.
   - To find the length of the third CD, we multiply 1.5 hours by 2:
     \[
     \text{Length of third CD} = 1.5 \times 2 = 3 \text{ hours}
     \]

3. **Calculate the combined length of all three CDs:**
   - We have two CDs that are each 1.5 hours long, and one CD that is 3 hours long.
   - First, calculate the total length of the two 1.5-hour CDs:
     \[
     \text{Total length of two 1.5-hour CDs} = 1.5 + 1.5 = 3 \text{ hours}
     \]
   - Now, add the length of the third CD to this total:
     \[
     \text{Combined length of all CDs} = 3 \text{ (from the first two CDs)} + 3 \text{ (third CD)} = 6 \text{ hours}
     \]

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The combined length of the three CDs is 6 hours.

Therefore, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{6 \text{ hours}}
\]
