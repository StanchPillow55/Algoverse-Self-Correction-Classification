==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine the total length of the three CDs that James buys. We are given the lengths of two of the CDs and information about the third CD.

1. **Identify the lengths of the first two CDs:**
   - The first CD is 1.5 hours long.
   - The second CD is also 1.5 hours long.

2. **Determine the length of the third CD:**
   - We are told that the third CD is twice as long as one of the first two CDs.
   - Since each of the first two CDs is 1.5 hours long, the third CD is twice 1.5 hours.
   - To calculate this, we multiply 1.5 hours by 2:
     \[
     1.5 \times 2 = 3 \text{ hours}
     \]
   - Therefore, the third CD is 3 hours long.

3. **Calculate the combined length of all three CDs:**
   - We add the lengths of the three CDs together:
     \[
     1.5 + 1.5 + 3 = 6 \text{ hours}
     \]

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The combined length of the three CDs is 6 hours.

Therefore, the final answer is that the combined length of the CDs is 6 hours.
