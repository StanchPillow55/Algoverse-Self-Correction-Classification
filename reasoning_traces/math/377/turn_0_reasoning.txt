To find the combined length of the CDs that James buys, we will follow these steps:

1. **Identify the lengths of the CDs**:
   - James buys 3 CDs.
   - Two of the CDs are each 1.5 hours long.
   - The last CD is twice as long as one of the first two CDs.

2. **Calculate the length of the last CD**:
   - Since the last CD is twice the length of one of the first two CDs, we calculate it as follows:
     \[
     \text{Length of the last CD} = 2 \times 1.5 \text{ hours} = 3 \text{ hours}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total length of all CDs**:
   - Now we have the lengths of all three CDs:
     - First CD: 1.5 hours
     - Second CD: 1.5 hours
     - Last CD: 3 hours
   - To find the total length, we sum these lengths:
     \[
     \text{Total length} = 1.5 \text{ hours} + 1.5 \text{ hours} + 3 \text{ hours}
     \]

4. **Perform the addition**:
   - First, add the lengths of the first two CDs:
     \[
     1.5 + 1.5 = 3 \text{ hours}
     \]
   - Now, add the length of the last CD:
     \[
     3 \text{ hours} + 3 \text{ hours} = 6 \text{ hours}
     \]

5. **State the final answer**:
   - The combined length of the CDs is:
     \[
     \boxed{6 \text{ hours}}
     \]
