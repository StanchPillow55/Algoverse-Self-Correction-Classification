==================================================

To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the number of apples sold on Monday**:
   Lucy sells apples at $4 each. We know she made $56 from selling the apples on Monday. We can find out how many apples she sold by dividing the total amount of money she made by the price per apple.

   \[
   \text{Number of apples sold on Monday} = \frac{\text{Total money made}}{\text{Price per apple}} = \frac{56}{4} = 14
   \]

   So, Lucy sold 14 apples on Monday.

2. **Calculate the number of apples picked on Tuesday**:
   According to the problem, Lucy picked 12 apples on Tuesday.

3. **Calculate the number of apples picked on Wednesday**:
   The problem states that on Wednesday, Lucy picked double the number of apples she picked on Tuesday. Since she picked 12 apples on Tuesday, we can calculate the number of apples picked on Wednesday as follows:

   \[
   \text{Number of apples picked on Wednesday} = 2 \times \text{Number of apples picked on Tuesday} = 2 \times 12 = 24
   \]

4. **Calculate the total number of apples picked over the three days**:
   Now, we will add the number of apples picked on each day to find the total:

   \[
   \text{Total apples picked} = \text{Apples picked on Monday} + \text{Apples picked on Tuesday} + \text{Apples picked on Wednesday}
   \]

   Since Lucy sold all the apples she picked on Monday, we can consider the apples picked on Monday as the same number she sold, which is 14.

   Therefore, we have:

   \[
   \text{Total apples picked} = 14 + 12 + 24
   \]

   Now, we perform the addition:

   \[
   14 + 12 = 26
   \]
   \[
   26 + 24 = 50
   \]

5. **Final answer**:
   The total number of apples Lucy picked over the three days is \( \boxed{50} \).
