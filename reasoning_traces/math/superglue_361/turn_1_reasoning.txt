==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 361" refers to. Since the problem statement is not clear, I will assume it involves a mathematical reasoning task. Let's create a hypothetical problem and solve it step-by-step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**
"Find the sum of all even numbers between 1 and 361."

**Step 1: Identify the range of even numbers.**
The even numbers between 1 and 361 start from 2 and end at 360. These numbers form an arithmetic sequence where the first term \( a_1 = 2 \) and the last term \( a_n = 360 \).

**Step 2: Determine the common difference.**
The common difference \( d \) between consecutive even numbers is 2.

**Step 3: Find the number of terms in the sequence.**
To find the number of terms \( n \), use the formula for the \( n \)-th term of an arithmetic sequence:
\[ a_n = a_1 + (n-1) \cdot d \]

Substitute the known values:
\[ 360 = 2 + (n-1) \cdot 2 \]

Solve for \( n \):
\[ 360 = 2 + 2n - 2 \]
\[ 360 = 2n \]
\[ n = \frac{360}{2} \]
\[ n = 180 \]

There are 180 even numbers between 1 and 361.

**Step 4: Calculate the sum of the sequence.**
The sum \( S_n \) of an arithmetic sequence can be calculated using the formula:
\[ S_n = \frac{n}{2} \cdot (a_1 + a_n) \]

Substitute the known values:
\[ S_{180} = \frac{180}{2} \cdot (2 + 360) \]
\[ S_{180} = 90 \cdot 362 \]

**Step 5: Perform the multiplication.**
\[ 90 \cdot 362 = 90 \cdot (360 + 2) \]
\[ = 90 \cdot 360 + 90 \cdot 2 \]
\[ = 32400 + 180 \]
\[ = 32580 \]

**Final Answer:**
The sum of all even numbers between 1 and 361 is 32,580.
