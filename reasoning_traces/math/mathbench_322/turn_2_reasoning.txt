==================================================

To solve "Sample math problem 322," we need to first understand what the problem is asking. Since the problem is not explicitly stated, let's assume it's a hypothetical math problem that requires a step-by-step solution. I'll create a sample problem and solve it.

**Sample Math Problem 322:**

*Problem Statement:*
A rectangle has a length that is 3 times its width. If the perimeter of the rectangle is 64 units, find the dimensions of the rectangle.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We have a rectangle with a length (L) and a width (W).
   - The length is 3 times the width: \( L = 3W \).
   - The perimeter of the rectangle is 64 units.

2. **Recall the Formula for Perimeter:**
   - The perimeter (P) of a rectangle is given by the formula:
     \[
     P = 2L + 2W
     \]

3. **Substitute the Known Values:**
   - We know \( P = 64 \) and \( L = 3W \).
   - Substitute \( L = 3W \) into the perimeter formula:
     \[
     64 = 2(3W) + 2W
     \]

4. **Simplify the Equation:**
   - Simplify the expression:
     \[
     64 = 6W + 2W
     \]
   - Combine like terms:
     \[
     64 = 8W
     \]

5. **Solve for W:**
   - Divide both sides by 8 to solve for W:
     \[
     W = \frac{64}{8} = 8
     \]

6. **Find the Length (L):**
   - Since \( L = 3W \), substitute \( W = 8 \) into the equation for L:
     \[
     L = 3 \times 8 = 24
     \]

7. **Verify the Solution:**
   - Check the perimeter with the found dimensions:
     \[
     P = 2L + 2W = 2(24) + 2(8) = 48 + 16 = 64
     \]
   - The calculated perimeter matches the given perimeter, confirming our solution is correct.

**Final Answer:**
The dimensions of the rectangle are:
- Width (W) = 8 units
- Length (L) = 24 units
