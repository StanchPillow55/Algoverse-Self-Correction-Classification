Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve "Sample math problem 322," we need to first understand what the problem is asking. Since the problem is not explicitly stated, let's assume a hypothetical math problem labeled as "Sample math problem 322" and solve it step by step.

Let's assume the problem is as follows:

**Problem 322:**
Solve for \( x \) in the equation: 
\[ 3x + 5 = 20 \]

**Step 1: Understand the Equation**

The equation given is a linear equation in one variable, \( x \). Our goal is to isolate \( x \) on one side of the equation to find its value.

**Step 2: Isolate the Variable**

To isolate \( x \), we need to perform operations that will leave \( x \) alone on one side of the equation. We start by eliminating the constant term on the left side of the equation.

**Step 3: Subtract 5 from Both Sides**

Subtract 5 from both sides of the equation to remove the constant term from the left side:
\[ 3x + 5 - 5 = 20 - 5 \]

This simplifies to:
\[ 3x = 15 \]

**Step 4: Divide by the Coefficient of \( x \)**

The next step is to divide both sides of the equation by the coefficient of \( x \), which is 3, to solve for \( x \):
\[ \frac{3x}{3} = \frac{15}{3} \]

This simplifies to:
\[ x = 5 \]

**Step 5: Verify the Solution**

To ensure our solution is correct, we substitute \( x = 5 \) back into the original equation:
\[ 3(5) + 5 = 20 \]

Calculate the left side:
\[ 15 + 5 = 20 \]

Since both sides of the equation are equal, our solution is verified.

**Final Answer:**

The solution to the equation \( 3x + 5 = 20 \) is \( x = 5 \).
