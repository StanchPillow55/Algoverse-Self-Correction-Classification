==================================================

To solve the problem, we first need to understand what "Sample math problem 322" refers to. Since the problem itself is not provided, I'll create a hypothetical math problem labeled as "Sample math problem 322" and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem 322:**

*Problem Statement:*

A rectangle has a length that is 3 times its width. If the perimeter of the rectangle is 64 units, find the dimensions of the rectangle.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We have a rectangle with a length (L) and a width (W).
   - The length is 3 times the width: \( L = 3W \).
   - The perimeter of the rectangle is 64 units.

2. **Recall the Formula for Perimeter:**
   - The perimeter \( P \) of a rectangle is given by the formula:
     \[
     P = 2L + 2W
     \]

3. **Substitute the Given Values:**
   - We know \( P = 64 \) and \( L = 3W \).
   - Substitute \( L = 3W \) into the perimeter formula:
     \[
     64 = 2(3W) + 2W
     \]

4. **Simplify the Equation:**
   - Simplify the expression:
     \[
     64 = 6W + 2W
     \]
   - Combine like terms:
     \[
     64 = 8W
     \]

5. **Solve for W:**
   - Divide both sides by 8 to solve for \( W \):
     \[
     W = \frac{64}{8} = 8
     \]

6. **Find the Length L:**
   - Since \( L = 3W \), substitute \( W = 8 \) into the equation for \( L \):
     \[
     L = 3 \times 8 = 24
     \]

7. **Verify the Solution:**
   - Check if the dimensions satisfy the perimeter condition:
     \[
     P = 2L + 2W = 2(24) + 2(8) = 48 + 16 = 64
     \]
   - The calculated perimeter matches the given perimeter, confirming our solution is correct.

**Final Answer:**

The dimensions of the rectangle are:
- Width \( W = 8 \) units
- Length \( L = 24 \) units
