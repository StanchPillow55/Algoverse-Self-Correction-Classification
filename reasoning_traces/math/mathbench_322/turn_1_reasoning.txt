==================================================

To solve "Sample math problem 322," we first need to understand what the problem is asking. However, since "Sample math problem 322" is not a specific problem, I'll create a hypothetical math problem and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**

A rectangular garden has a length that is 3 meters longer than its width. The area of the garden is 70 square meters. What are the dimensions of the garden?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( w \) be the width of the garden in meters.
   - Then the length of the garden is \( w + 3 \) meters.

2. **Write the Equation for Area:**
   - The area \( A \) of a rectangle is given by the formula:
     \[
     A = \text{length} \times \text{width}
     \]
   - Substituting the known values, we have:
     \[
     70 = (w + 3) \times w
     \]

3. **Expand and Rearrange the Equation:**
   - Expand the equation:
     \[
     70 = w^2 + 3w
     \]
   - Rearrange it into a standard quadratic equation form:
     \[
     w^2 + 3w - 70 = 0
     \]

4. **Solve the Quadratic Equation:**
   - We will use the quadratic formula, where \( a = 1 \), \( b = 3 \), and \( c = -70 \):
     \[
     w = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
     \]
   - Calculate the discriminant:
     \[
     b^2 - 4ac = 3^2 - 4 \times 1 \times (-70) = 9 + 280 = 289
     \]
   - Since the discriminant is a perfect square, we can proceed:
     \[
     w = \frac{-3 \pm \sqrt{289}}{2 \times 1}
     \]
     \[
     w = \frac{-3 \pm 17}{2}
     \]

5. **Find the Possible Values for \( w \):**
   - Calculate the two possible solutions:
     \[
     w = \frac{-3 + 17}{2} = \frac{14}{2} = 7
     \]
     \[
     w = \frac{-3 - 17}{2} = \frac{-20}{2} = -10
     \]

6. **Select the Valid Solution:**
   - Since a width cannot be negative, we discard \( w = -10 \).
   - Thus, \( w = 7 \).

7. **Find the Length:**
   - Substitute \( w = 7 \) back into the expression for the length:
     \[
     \text{Length} = w + 3 = 7 + 3 = 10
     \]

8. **Conclusion:**
   - The dimensions of the garden are:
     - Width: 7 meters
     - Length: 10 meters

**Final Answer:**
The dimensions of the garden are 7 meters by 10 meters.
