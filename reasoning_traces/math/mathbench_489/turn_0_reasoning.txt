==================================================

To solve the problem, "Sample math problem 489," we need to first understand what the problem is asking. However, since "Sample math problem 489" is not a specific math problem, I'll create a sample math problem and solve it step by step.

Let's assume the problem is:

**Problem:** Solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 3x + 5 = 20 \).

**Step 1: Isolate the variable term.**

We want to solve for \( x \), so we need to isolate the term that contains \( x \). The equation is:

\[ 3x + 5 = 20 \]

To isolate \( 3x \), we need to get rid of the constant term on the left side, which is \( 5 \). We can do this by subtracting \( 5 \) from both sides of the equation:

\[ 3x + 5 - 5 = 20 - 5 \]

This simplifies to:

\[ 3x = 15 \]

**Step 2: Solve for the variable.**

Now that we have \( 3x = 15 \), we need to solve for \( x \). Since \( 3x \) means \( 3 \times x \), we can solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides of the equation by \( 3 \):

\[ \frac{3x}{3} = \frac{15}{3} \]

This simplifies to:

\[ x = 5 \]

**Step 3: Verify the solution.**

To ensure our solution is correct, we can substitute \( x = 5 \) back into the original equation and check if both sides are equal:

Original equation: \( 3x + 5 = 20 \)

Substitute \( x = 5 \):

\[ 3(5) + 5 = 20 \]

Calculate the left side:

\[ 15 + 5 = 20 \]

Since both sides of the equation are equal, our solution is verified.

**Final Answer:**

The solution to the equation \( 3x + 5 = 20 \) is \( x = 5 \).
