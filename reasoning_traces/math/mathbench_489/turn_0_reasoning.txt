==================================================

To solve the problem, we first need to understand what "Sample math problem 489" refers to. Since no specific details are provided about this problem, I'll create a hypothetical math problem and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem 489:**

Calculate the sum of the first 20 positive even numbers.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Identify the Sequence:**
   The sequence of the first 20 positive even numbers is: 2, 4, 6, 8, ..., 40.

2. **Recognize the Pattern:**
   This sequence is an arithmetic sequence where the first term \( a_1 = 2 \) and the common difference \( d = 2 \).

3. **Find the Last Term:**
   The last term \( a_{20} \) can be found using the formula for the \( n \)-th term of an arithmetic sequence:
   \[
   a_n = a_1 + (n-1) \cdot d
   \]
   Substituting the known values:
   \[
   a_{20} = 2 + (20-1) \cdot 2 = 2 + 38 = 40
   \]

4. **Sum of an Arithmetic Sequence:**
   The sum \( S_n \) of the first \( n \) terms of an arithmetic sequence is given by:
   \[
   S_n = \frac{n}{2} \cdot (a_1 + a_n)
   \]
   Substituting the known values:
   \[
   S_{20} = \frac{20}{2} \cdot (2 + 40) = 10 \cdot 42 = 420
   \]

5. **Conclusion:**
   The sum of the first 20 positive even numbers is 420.

**Final Answer:**

The sum of the first 20 positive even numbers is 420.
