Question ID: mathbench_489
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we first need to understand what "Sample math problem 489" refers to. Since the problem itself is not explicitly stated, I'll assume it's a hypothetical math problem labeled as "489." Without specific details, I'll create a sample math problem and solve it step-by-step.

Let's assume "Sample math problem 489" is the following:

**Problem 489:**
Solve for \( x \) in the equation: 
\[ 3x + 7 = 22 \]

**Step-by-step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Equation:**
   The equation given is a linear equation in one variable, \( x \). Our goal is to isolate \( x \) on one side of the equation.

2. **Subtract 7 from Both Sides:**
   To isolate the term with \( x \), we first need to eliminate the constant term on the left side of the equation. We do this by subtracting 7 from both sides:
   \[
   3x + 7 - 7 = 22 - 7
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   3x = 15
   \]

3. **Divide Both Sides by 3:**
   Now, to solve for \( x \), we need to divide both sides of the equation by 3:
   \[
   \frac{3x}{3} = \frac{15}{3}
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   x = 5
   \]

4. **Verify the Solution:**
   To ensure our solution is correct, we substitute \( x = 5 \) back into the original equation:
   \[
   3(5) + 7 = 22
   \]
   Simplifying the left side:
   \[
   15 + 7 = 22
   \]
   \[
   22 = 22
   \]
   Since both sides of the equation are equal, our solution is verified.

**Final Answer:**
The solution to the equation \( 3x + 7 = 22 \) is \( x = 5 \).
