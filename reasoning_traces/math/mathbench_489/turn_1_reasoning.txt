==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample math problem 489" refers to. Since the problem is not explicitly stated, I will assume it is a placeholder for a specific math problem. Without the actual details of the problem, I will create a hypothetical math problem labeled as "Sample math problem 489" and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem 489:**

*Problem Statement:*

Solve for \( x \) in the equation:

\[ 3x + 5 = 2x + 9 \]

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Equation:**
   The equation given is a linear equation in one variable, \( x \). Our goal is to isolate \( x \) on one side of the equation to find its value.

2. **Simplify the Equation:**
   Start by getting all terms involving \( x \) on one side of the equation and constant terms on the other side.

   \[
   3x + 5 = 2x + 9
   \]

   Subtract \( 2x \) from both sides to move the \( x \)-terms to one side:

   \[
   3x - 2x + 5 = 9
   \]

   Simplify the left side:

   \[
   x + 5 = 9
   \]

3. **Isolate \( x \):**
   Subtract 5 from both sides to isolate \( x \):

   \[
   x + 5 - 5 = 9 - 5
   \]

   Simplify:

   \[
   x = 4
   \]

4. **Verify the Solution:**
   Substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies the equation:

   Original equation:

   \[
   3x + 5 = 2x + 9
   \]

   Substitute \( x = 4 \):

   \[
   3(4) + 5 = 2(4) + 9
   \]

   Calculate both sides:

   Left side: \( 12 + 5 = 17 \)

   Right side: \( 8 + 9 = 17 \)

   Since both sides are equal, \( x = 4 \) is indeed the correct solution.

**Final Answer:**

The solution to the equation \( 3x + 5 = 2x + 9 \) is \( x = 4 \).
