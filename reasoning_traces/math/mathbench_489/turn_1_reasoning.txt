==================================================

To solve the problem, we first need to understand what "Sample math problem 489" refers to. Since this is a generic placeholder, I'll create a hypothetical math problem with the number 489 and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**

Calculate the sum of the digits of the number 489 and determine if the sum is a prime number.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Identify the digits of the number 489:**
   - The number 489 consists of three digits: 4, 8, and 9.

2. **Calculate the sum of these digits:**
   - Sum = 4 + 8 + 9

3. **Perform the addition:**
   - First, add 4 and 8:
     \[
     4 + 8 = 12
     \]
   - Then, add the result to 9:
     \[
     12 + 9 = 21
     \]

4. **Determine if the sum (21) is a prime number:**
   - A prime number is a number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.
   - Check the divisibility of 21:
     - 21 is divisible by 1 and 21 (trivially true for any number).
     - Check divisibility by 2: 21 is odd, so it is not divisible by 2.
     - Check divisibility by 3: Sum of the digits of 21 is 2 + 1 = 3, which is divisible by 3. Therefore, 21 is divisible by 3.
     - Since 21 is divisible by 3, it is not a prime number.

**Conclusion:**

The sum of the digits of the number 489 is 21, and 21 is not a prime number.

**Final Answer:**

The sum of the digits of 489 is 21, which is not a prime number.
