==================================================

To determine how many more cupcakes Paul needs to buy, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of cupcakes Paul currently has**:
   - Paul has 8 chocolate cupcakes and 40 toffee cupcakes.
   - We add these two amounts together:
     \[
     \text{Total cupcakes} = \text{Chocolate cupcakes} + \text{Toffee cupcakes} = 8 + 40
     \]
   - Performing the addition:
     \[
     \text{Total cupcakes} = 48
     \]

2. **Determine how many more cupcakes Paul needs**:
   - Paul needs a total of 63 cupcakes for the party.
   - To find out how many more cupcakes he needs to buy, we subtract the number of cupcakes he currently has from the total he needs:
     \[
     \text{Cupcakes needed} = \text{Total needed} - \text{Total currently has} = 63 - 48
     \]
   - Performing the subtraction:
     \[
     \text{Cupcakes needed} = 15
     \]

3. **Conclusion**:
   - Paul needs to buy 15 more cupcakes to have enough for the birthday party.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{15}
\]
