==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to determine the cost of the house given that the total cost of the house and the lot is $120,000, and that the house costs three times as much as the lot.

Let's define the variables:

- Let \( x \) be the cost of the lot.
- Then, the cost of the house will be \( 3x \) (since the house costs three times as much as the lot).

According to the problem, the total cost of the house and the lot is $120,000. We can set up the following equation:

\[
x + 3x = 120,000
\]

Now, we can combine like terms on the left side:

\[
4x = 120,000
\]

Next, we will solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides of the equation by 4:

\[
x = \frac{120,000}{4}
\]

Calculating the right side:

\[
x = 30,000
\]

Now that we have the cost of the lot, we can find the cost of the house. Since the house costs three times as much as the lot, we calculate:

\[
\text{Cost of the house} = 3x = 3 \times 30,000
\]

Calculating this gives:

\[
\text{Cost of the house} = 90,000
\]

Thus, the cost of the house is \( \boxed{90,000} \).
