Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to set up equations based on the information given.

1. **Define the variables:**
   - Let \( L \) represent the cost of the lot.
   - Let \( H \) represent the cost of the house.

2. **Set up the equations based on the problem statement:**
   - We know that the total cost of the house and the lot is $120,000. This gives us our first equation:
     \[
     H + L = 120,000
     \]
   - We also know that the house costs three times as much as the lot. This gives us our second equation:
     \[
     H = 3L
     \]

3. **Substitute the second equation into the first equation:**
   - We can substitute \( H \) in the first equation with \( 3L \):
     \[
     3L + L = 120,000
     \]

4. **Combine like terms:**
   - This simplifies to:
     \[
     4L = 120,000
     \]

5. **Solve for \( L \):**
   - Divide both sides by 4:
     \[
     L = \frac{120,000}{4} = 30,000
     \]

6. **Now, find \( H \):**
   - Using the second equation \( H = 3L \):
     \[
     H = 3 \times 30,000 = 90,000
     \]

7. **Final answer:**
   - The cost of the house is \( \boxed{90,000} \).

To summarize, we defined the variables, set up equations based on the relationships given in the problem, substituted to solve for one variable, and then found the other variable. The house costs $90,000.
