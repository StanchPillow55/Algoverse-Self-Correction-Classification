Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to set up equations based on the information given.

1. **Define Variables**:
   - Let \( L \) represent the cost of the lot.
   - Let \( H \) represent the cost of the house.

2. **Set Up Equations**:
   - According to the problem, the total cost of the house and the lot is $120,000. This can be expressed as:
     \[
     H + L = 120,000
     \]
   - We are also told that the house costs three times as much as the lot. This can be expressed as:
     \[
     H = 3L
     \]

3. **Substitute**:
   - We can substitute the expression for \( H \) from the second equation into the first equation. This gives us:
     \[
     3L + L = 120,000
     \]

4. **Combine Like Terms**:
   - Combine the terms on the left side:
     \[
     4L = 120,000
     \]

5. **Solve for \( L \)**:
   - Divide both sides by 4 to find the cost of the lot:
     \[
     L = \frac{120,000}{4} = 30,000
     \]

6. **Find \( H \)**:
   - Now that we have the cost of the lot, we can find the cost of the house using the equation \( H = 3L \):
     \[
     H = 3 \times 30,000 = 90,000
     \]

7. **Final Answer**:
   - The cost of the house is \( \boxed{90,000} \).

To summarize, we defined the costs of the house and lot, set up equations based on the problem's conditions, solved for the cost of the lot, and then used that to find the cost of the house. The final answer is that the house costs $90,000.
