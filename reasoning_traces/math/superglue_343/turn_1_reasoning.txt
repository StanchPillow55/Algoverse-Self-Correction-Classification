Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 343" refers to. Since the question itself is not provided, I'll demonstrate a general approach to solving a typical math problem, assuming it involves some basic operations or concepts. 

Let's assume "Sample reasoning question 343" is a math problem that involves solving an equation or performing a calculation. Here's a step-by-step approach to solving a hypothetical math problem:

### Hypothetical Problem:
**Solve for \( x \) in the equation:**
\[ 2x + 3 = 11 \]

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Understand the Equation:**
   The equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \) is a linear equation in one variable, \( x \). Our goal is to isolate \( x \) on one side of the equation.

2. **Isolate the Variable:**
   To isolate \( x \), we need to perform operations that will leave \( x \) by itself on one side of the equation.

3. **Subtract 3 from Both Sides:**
   \[
   2x + 3 - 3 = 11 - 3
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   2x = 8
   \]

4. **Divide Both Sides by 2:**
   \[
   \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{8}{2}
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   x = 4
   \]

5. **Verify the Solution:**
   Substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies the equation:
   \[
   2(4) + 3 = 11
   \]
   Simplifying the left side gives:
   \[
   8 + 3 = 11
   \]
   Since both sides of the equation are equal, \( x = 4 \) is indeed the correct solution.

### Final Answer:
The solution to the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \) is \( x = 4 \).

This approach demonstrates a clear and logical method to solve a linear equation. If "Sample reasoning question 343" refers to a different type of problem, please provide additional details or context so I can tailor the solution accordingly.
