==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample math problem 234" refers to. Since the problem is not explicitly stated, I'll assume it's a placeholder for a specific math problem. However, without the actual problem, I can't provide a specific solution. Instead, I'll demonstrate how to approach a generic math problem step-by-step.

Let's assume "Sample math problem 234" is a typical algebra problem. Here's an example problem and how to solve it:

**Example Problem:**
Solve for \( x \) in the equation: \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   The equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \) is a linear equation in one variable, \( x \). Our goal is to find the value of \( x \) that makes this equation true.

2. **Isolate the Variable:**
   To solve for \( x \), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We start by eliminating the constant term on the left side.

   \[
   2x + 3 = 11
   \]

   Subtract 3 from both sides to remove the constant term from the left side:

   \[
   2x + 3 - 3 = 11 - 3
   \]

   Simplifying both sides gives:

   \[
   2x = 8
   \]

3. **Solve for \( x \):**
   Now, divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( x \):

   \[
   \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{8}{2}
   \]

   Simplifying both sides gives:

   \[
   x = 4
   \]

4. **Verify the Solution:**
   Substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies the equation:

   \[
   2(4) + 3 = 11
   \]

   Simplifying the left side:

   \[
   8 + 3 = 11
   \]

   Since both sides of the equation are equal, \( x = 4 \) is indeed the correct solution.

5. **State the Final Answer:**
   The solution to the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \) is \( x = 4 \).

This is a basic example of how to approach solving a linear equation. If "Sample math problem 234" refers to a different type of problem, please provide more details so I can assist you accordingly.
