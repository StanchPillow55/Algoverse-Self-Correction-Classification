==================================================

To solve the problem effectively, let's first clarify what "Sample math problem 234" refers to. Since the problem is not explicitly stated, I'll assume a hypothetical math problem for demonstration purposes. Let's consider a typical math problem involving basic arithmetic operations:

**Problem:**  
Calculate the sum of 234 and 567, then subtract 123 from the result.

**Step-by-step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We need to first add two numbers: 234 and 567.
   - Then, we need to subtract 123 from the result of the addition.

2. **Perform the Addition:**
   - Add 234 and 567.
   - Align the numbers by their place values and add each column starting from the right (units place).

   \[
   \begin{array}{c}
     \phantom{+}234 \\
   + 567 \\
   \hline
   \end{array}
   \]

   - Units place: \(4 + 7 = 11\). Write 1 and carry over 1.
   - Tens place: \(3 + 6 = 9\), plus the carry over 1 gives 10. Write 0 and carry over 1.
   - Hundreds place: \(2 + 5 = 7\), plus the carry over 1 gives 8.

   \[
   \begin{array}{c}
     \phantom{+}234 \\
   + 567 \\
   \hline
     801 \\
   \end{array}
   \]

   The sum of 234 and 567 is 801.

3. **Perform the Subtraction:**
   - Subtract 123 from 801.
   - Align the numbers by their place values and subtract each column starting from the right.

   \[
   \begin{array}{c}
     \phantom{-}801 \\
   - 123 \\
   \hline
   \end{array}
   \]

   - Units place: \(1 - 3\) is not possible, so borrow 1 from the tens place.
   - Tens place: Now \(0 - 2\) is not possible, so borrow 1 from the hundreds place.
   - Hundreds place: \(8 - 1 = 7\).

   After borrowing, the subtraction becomes:

   \[
   \begin{array}{c}
     \phantom{-}7\cancel{0}9 \\
   - 123 \\
   \hline
     678 \\
   \end{array}
   \]

   The result of subtracting 123 from 801 is 678.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The final result after performing the operations is 678.

Therefore, the final answer to the problem is 678.
