==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 234," we need to first understand what the problem is asking. However, the problem statement "Sample math problem 234" is not clear or specific. It seems like a placeholder or an incomplete problem. Therefore, I will assume that "234" might be a number involved in a mathematical operation or problem. 

Since there is no specific operation or context provided, I will explore a few possible interpretations and solve them:

### Interpretation 1: Basic Operations with 234

1. **Addition**: Suppose we need to add 234 to another number, say 100.
   \[
   234 + 100 = 334
   \]

2. **Subtraction**: Suppose we need to subtract 50 from 234.
   \[
   234 - 50 = 184
   \]

3. **Multiplication**: Suppose we need to multiply 234 by 2.
   \[
   234 \times 2 = 468
   \]

4. **Division**: Suppose we need to divide 234 by 3.
   \[
   234 \div 3 = 78
   \]

### Interpretation 2: Factorization of 234

Let's factorize 234 into its prime factors.

1. **Check divisibility by 2**: 234 is even, so it is divisible by 2.
   \[
   234 \div 2 = 117
   \]

2. **Check divisibility of 117 by 3**: The sum of the digits of 117 is \(1 + 1 + 7 = 9\), which is divisible by 3.
   \[
   117 \div 3 = 39
   \]

3. **Check divisibility of 39 by 3**: The sum of the digits of 39 is \(3 + 9 = 12\), which is divisible by 3.
   \[
   39 \div 3 = 13
   \]

4. **Check divisibility of 13**: 13 is a prime number.

Thus, the prime factorization of 234 is:
\[
234 = 2 \times 3^2 \times 13
\]

### Interpretation 3: Solving an Equation Involving 234

Suppose we have an equation \(x + 234 = 500\). We need to solve for \(x\).

1. **Subtract 234 from both sides**:
   \[
   x + 234 - 234 = 500 - 234
   \]
   \[
   x = 266
   \]

### Conclusion

Without a specific problem statement, I explored several interpretations involving the number 234. If you have a specific problem or context in mind, please provide more details so I can assist you more accurately. Based on the interpretations above, here are some possible final answers:

- For basic operations: \(234 + 100 = 334\), \(234 - 50 = 184\), \(234 \times 2 = 468\), \(234 \div 3 = 78\).
- For factorization: \(234 = 2 \times 3^2 \times 13\).
- For solving the equation: \(x = 266\) when \(x + 234 = 500\).

Please provide additional details if you have a specific problem in mind.
