Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 425" refers to. Since the question is not explicitly stated, I'll assume that "Sample reasoning question 425" is a placeholder for a specific math problem. Without the actual problem, I can't provide a detailed solution. However, I can demonstrate how to approach a typical math problem by using a hypothetical example.

Let's consider a sample math problem:

**Problem:** Solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).

**Step 1: Understand the Problem**
We need to find the value of \( x \) that makes the equation true.

**Step 2: Isolate the Variable**
To solve for \( x \), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We start by eliminating the constant term on the left side of the equation.

\[
2x + 3 = 11
\]

Subtract 3 from both sides:

\[
2x + 3 - 3 = 11 - 3
\]

Simplify:

\[
2x = 8
\]

**Step 3: Solve for \( x \)**
Now, divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( x \):

\[
\frac{2x}{2} = \frac{8}{2}
\]

Simplify:

\[
x = 4
\]

**Step 4: Verify the Solution**
Substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies the equation:

\[
2(4) + 3 = 11
\]

Calculate:

\[
8 + 3 = 11
\]

Since both sides of the equation are equal, \( x = 4 \) is indeed the correct solution.

**Final Answer:**
The solution to the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \) is \( x = 4 \).
