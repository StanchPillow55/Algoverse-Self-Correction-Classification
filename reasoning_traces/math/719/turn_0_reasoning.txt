Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to determine how many kilograms of rice Goldy gave to her cousin and brother after buying 20 sacks of rice.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of sacks given away.**

Goldy gave:
- 3 sacks to her cousin
- 4 sacks to her brother

Total sacks given away = 3 sacks + 4 sacks = 7 sacks

**Step 2: Calculate the total weight of the rice given away.**

We know that each sack of rice weighs 25 kilograms. Therefore, to find the total weight of the rice given away, we multiply the total number of sacks given away by the weight per sack.

Total weight given away = Total sacks given away × Weight per sack
Total weight given away = 7 sacks × 25 kg/sack

Now, we perform the multiplication:

Total weight given away = 7 × 25 = 175 kg

**Final Answer:**

Goldy gave a total of 175 kilograms of rice to her cousin and brother.
