Question ID: 1046
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To find out how many hours of work each painter put in, we can follow these steps:

1. **Determine the total number of days worked**:
   - The team worked for 3 weeks. Since there are 7 days in a week, the total number of days is:
     \[
     3 \text{ weeks} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 21 \text{ days}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total hours worked by the team**:
   - The team worked for \( \frac{3}{8} \) of a day each day. Therefore, the total hours worked by the team over 21 days is:
     \[
     21 \text{ days} \times \frac{3}{8} \text{ day/day} = \frac{63}{8} \text{ days}
     \]

3. **Convert days to hours**:
   - Since there are 24 hours in a day, we convert the total days worked into hours:
     \[
     \frac{63}{8} \text{ days} \times 24 \text{ hours/day} = \frac{63 \times 24}{8} \text{ hours}
     \]
   - Simplifying this:
     \[
     \frac{63 \times 24}{8} = \frac{1512}{8} = 189 \text{ hours}
     \]

4. **Determine the hours worked by each painter**:
   - Since there are 4 painters, we divide the total hours worked by the number of painters:
     \[
     \frac{189 \text{ hours}}{4 \text{ painters}} = 47.25 \text{ hours/painter}
     \]

Thus, each painter worked a total of **47.25 hours**.

Final answer:
\[
\text{Each painter put in } 47.25 \text{ hours of work.}
\]
