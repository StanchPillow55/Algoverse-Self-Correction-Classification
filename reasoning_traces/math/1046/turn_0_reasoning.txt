To solve the problem, we need to determine how many hours each painter worked over the course of 3 weeks, given that they worked for \( \frac{3}{8} \) of a day each day.

### Step 1: Determine the total number of days worked

First, we need to find out how many days are in 3 weeks. Since there are 7 days in a week:

\[
\text{Total days} = 3 \text{ weeks} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 21 \text{ days}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the total hours worked by the team

Next, we know that the team worked \( \frac{3}{8} \) of a day each day. To find the total hours worked by the team over 21 days, we first need to determine how many hours are in a day. Typically, a day is considered to have 24 hours.

Now, we calculate the total hours worked by the team:

\[
\text{Hours worked per day} = \frac{3}{8} \text{ of a day} \times 24 \text{ hours/day}
\]

Calculating \( \frac{3}{8} \times 24 \):

\[
\frac{3}{8} \times 24 = \frac{3 \times 24}{8} = \frac{72}{8} = 9 \text{ hours/day}
\]

Now, we multiply the hours worked per day by the total number of days:

\[
\text{Total hours worked by the team} = 9 \text{ hours/day} \times 21 \text{ days} = 189 \text{ hours}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the hours worked by each painter

Since there are 4 painters on the team, we need to divide the total hours worked by the number of painters to find out how many hours each painter worked:

\[
\text{Hours worked by each painter} = \frac{\text{Total hours worked by the team}}{\text{Number of painters}} = \frac{189 \text{ hours}}{4}
\]

Calculating \( \frac{189}{4} \):

\[
\frac{189}{4} = 47.25 \text{ hours}
\]

### Final Answer

Each painter worked a total of \( 47.25 \) hours over the 3 weeks.

Thus, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{47.25}
\]
