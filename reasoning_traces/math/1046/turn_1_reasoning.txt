Question ID: 1046
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to determine how many hours each painter worked in total over the 3-week period.

### Step 1: Calculate the total number of days worked
The problem states that the painters worked for 3 weeks. We first need to convert weeks into days.

1 week = 7 days  
So, 3 weeks = 3 Ã— 7 = 21 days

### Step 2: Calculate the total hours worked by the team
The team of 4 painters worked for \( \frac{3}{8} \) of a day each day. 

To find the total hours worked by the team over the 21 days, we first need to convert \( \frac{3}{8} \) of a day into hours. 

1 day = 24 hours  
So, \( \frac{3}{8} \) of a day in hours is:
\[
\frac{3}{8} \times 24 = \frac{72}{8} = 9 \text{ hours}
\]

Now, we calculate the total hours worked by the team over the 21 days:
\[
\text{Total hours worked by the team} = 9 \text{ hours/day} \times 21 \text{ days} = 189 \text{ hours}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the hours worked by each painter
Since there are 4 painters working together, we need to divide the total hours worked by the number of painters to find out how many hours each painter worked.

\[
\text{Hours worked by each painter} = \frac{189 \text{ hours}}{4 \text{ painters}} = 47.25 \text{ hours}
\]

### Final Answer
Each painter put in a total of **47.25 hours** of work.
