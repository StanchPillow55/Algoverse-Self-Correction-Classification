Let's denote the number of insects found by Lily, David, and Bodhi as \( L \), \( D \), and \( B \) respectively.

From the problem, we have the following information:

1. Together, they collected a total of 43 insects:
   \[
   L + D + B = 43
   \]

2. Lily found 7 more insects than David:
   \[
   L = D + 7
   \]

3. David found half of what Bodhi found:
   \[
   D = \frac{1}{2} B
   \]

Now, we can substitute the expressions for \( L \) and \( D \) into the first equation.

First, substitute \( D \) from the third equation into the second equation:
\[
L = \left(\frac{1}{2} B\right) + 7
\]

Now we have expressions for \( L \) and \( D \) in terms of \( B \):
- \( D = \frac{1}{2} B \)
- \( L = \frac{1}{2} B + 7 \)

Next, substitute these expressions into the total insects equation:
\[
\left(\frac{1}{2} B + 7\right) + \left(\frac{1}{2} B\right) + B = 43
\]

Combine like terms:
\[
\frac{1}{2} B + \frac{1}{2} B + B + 7 = 43
\]
\[
2B + 7 = 43
\]

Now, isolate \( B \) by subtracting 7 from both sides:
\[
2B = 43 - 7
\]
\[
2B = 36
\]

Now, divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( B \):
\[
B = 18
\]

Now that we have \( B \), we can find \( D \):
\[
D = \frac{1}{2} B = \frac{1}{2} \times 18 = 9
\]

Next, we can find \( L \):
\[
L = D + 7 = 9 + 7 = 16
\]

Now we have:
- \( L = 16 \)
- \( D = 9 \)
- \( B = 18 \)

Finally, we can check our work by verifying that the total is correct:
\[
L + D + B = 16 + 9 + 18 = 43
\]

Since this is correct, we conclude that the number of insects Lily found is:
\[
\boxed{16}
\]
