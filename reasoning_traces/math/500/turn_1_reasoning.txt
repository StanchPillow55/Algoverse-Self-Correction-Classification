==================================================

Let's define the number of insects found by each person with variables:

- Let \( D \) be the number of insects David found.
- Since Lily found 7 more than David, we can express the number of insects Lily found as \( L = D + 7 \).
- Let \( B \) be the number of insects Bodhi found. According to the problem, David found half of what Bodhi found, so we can express David's count as \( D = \frac{1}{2}B \).

Now, we know the total number of insects collected by Lily, David, and Bodhi is 43. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

\[
L + D + B = 43
\]

Substituting the expressions for \( L \) and \( D \) into the equation gives:

\[
(D + 7) + D + B = 43
\]

Now, substituting \( D = \frac{1}{2}B \) into the equation:

1. Replace \( D \) in the equation:
   \[
   \left(\frac{1}{2}B + 7\right) + \frac{1}{2}B + B = 43
   \]

2. Combine like terms:
   \[
   \frac{1}{2}B + \frac{1}{2}B + B + 7 = 43
   \]
   \[
   2B + 7 = 43
   \]

3. Subtract 7 from both sides:
   \[
   2B = 36
   \]

4. Divide by 2:
   \[
   B = 18
   \]

Now that we have \( B \), we can find \( D \):

\[
D = \frac{1}{2}B = \frac{1}{2} \times 18 = 9
\]

Next, we can find \( L \):

\[
L = D + 7 = 9 + 7 = 16
\]

Finally, we can summarize our findings:

- Lily found \( L = 16 \) insects.
- David found \( D = 9 \) insects.
- Bodhi found \( B = 18 \) insects.

To verify, we check the total:

\[
L + D + B = 16 + 9 + 18 = 43
\]

This confirms our calculations are correct.

Thus, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{16}
\]
