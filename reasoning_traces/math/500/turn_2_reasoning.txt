Dataset Type: math
==================================================

Let's define the number of insects found by each person:

- Let \( D \) be the number of insects David found.
- Since Lily found 7 more than David, we can express the number of insects Lily found as \( L = D + 7 \).
- Let \( B \) be the number of insects Bodhi found. According to the problem, David found half of what Bodhi found, so we can express this relationship as \( D = \frac{1}{2}B \).

Now, we know the total number of insects collected by Lily, David, and Bodhi is 43. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[
L + D + B = 43
\]

Substituting the expressions for \( L \) and \( D \) into the total equation:

\[
(D + 7) + D + B = 43
\]

Now, substituting \( D = \frac{1}{2}B \) into the equation:

\[
\left(\frac{1}{2}B + 7\right) + \frac{1}{2}B + B = 43
\]

Combining like terms:

\[
\frac{1}{2}B + \frac{1}{2}B + B + 7 = 43
\]

This simplifies to:

\[
2B + 7 = 43
\]

Now, subtract 7 from both sides:

\[
2B = 36
\]

Dividing both sides by 2 gives:

\[
B = 18
\]

Now that we have \( B \), we can find \( D \):

\[
D = \frac{1}{2}B = \frac{1}{2} \times 18 = 9
\]

Finally, we can find \( L \):

\[
L = D + 7 = 9 + 7 = 16
\]

Thus, the number of insects Lily found is:

\[
\boxed{16}
\]
