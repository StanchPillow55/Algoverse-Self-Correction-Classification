==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 123" entails. However, since "Sample reasoning question 123" does not provide specific details or context, I'll create a hypothetical math problem to demonstrate how to solve it step by step.

Let's assume the problem is as follows:

**Problem:**
Calculate the sum of all even numbers between 1 and 123.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Identify the Even Numbers:**
   - Even numbers are integers divisible by 2.
   - Between 1 and 123, the smallest even number is 2, and the largest even number is 122.

2. **Determine the Sequence of Even Numbers:**
   - The sequence of even numbers between 1 and 123 is: 2, 4, 6, ..., 122.
   - This sequence is an arithmetic sequence where the first term \( a_1 = 2 \) and the common difference \( d = 2 \).

3. **Find the Number of Terms in the Sequence:**
   - The general formula for the \( n \)-th term of an arithmetic sequence is:
     \[
     a_n = a_1 + (n-1) \cdot d
     \]
   - Set \( a_n = 122 \) to find \( n \):
     \[
     122 = 2 + (n-1) \cdot 2
     \]
     \[
     122 = 2 + 2n - 2
     \]
     \[
     122 = 2n
     \]
     \[
     n = \frac{122}{2} = 61
     \]
   - There are 61 even numbers between 1 and 123.

4. **Calculate the Sum of the Sequence:**
   - The sum \( S_n \) of the first \( n \) terms of an arithmetic sequence is given by:
     \[
     S_n = \frac{n}{2} \cdot (a_1 + a_n)
     \]
   - Substitute the known values:
     \[
     S_{61} = \frac{61}{2} \cdot (2 + 122)
     \]
     \[
     S_{61} = \frac{61}{2} \cdot 124
     \]
     \[
     S_{61} = 61 \cdot 62
     \]
     \[
     S_{61} = 3782
     \]

**Final Answer:**
The sum of all even numbers between 1 and 123 is 3782.
