==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample reasoning question 123," I will need more specific details about the question itself. However, I can guide you through a general approach to solving math problems, which you can apply to your specific question once you provide more details.

### General Approach to Solving Math Problems

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - Carefully read the problem statement.
   - Identify what is being asked.
   - Determine what information is given and what needs to be found.

2. **Devise a Plan:**
   - Consider possible strategies to solve the problem. This could include drawing diagrams, creating equations, or breaking the problem into smaller parts.
   - Choose the most appropriate method based on the information given.

3. **Carry Out the Plan:**
   - Execute the chosen strategy step by step.
   - Perform calculations carefully, showing all work.
   - Keep track of units and ensure consistency throughout the calculations.

4. **Check Your Work:**
   - Review each step to ensure accuracy.
   - Verify that the solution makes sense in the context of the problem.
   - Check calculations for any arithmetic errors.

5. **State the Final Answer:**
   - Clearly write the final answer, ensuring it answers the question posed.
   - Include units if applicable.

### Example Problem

Since the original question "Sample reasoning question 123" lacks specifics, let's consider a simple example problem to illustrate the approach:

**Example Problem:**
Find the sum of the first 10 positive integers.

**Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We need to find the sum of the first 10 positive integers: 1, 2, 3, ..., 10.

2. **Devise a Plan:**
   - Use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series: \( S_n = \frac{n}{2} \times (a + l) \)
     - Where \( n \) is the number of terms, \( a \) is the first term, and \( l \) is the last term.

3. **Carry Out the Plan:**
   - Here, \( n = 10 \), \( a = 1 \), and \( l = 10 \).
   - Substitute these values into the formula:
     \[
     S_{10} = \frac{10}{2} \times (1 + 10) = 5 \times 11 = 55
     \]

4. **Check Your Work:**
   - Verify by manually adding the numbers: \( 1 + 2 + 3 + \ldots + 10 = 55 \).
   - The calculation is consistent with the formula.

5. **State the Final Answer:**
   - The sum of the first 10 positive integers is 55.

If you provide the specific details of "Sample reasoning question 123," I can apply this structured approach to solve it.
