Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, let's first understand what is being asked. The question is "Sample reasoning question 123." Since this is not a standard math problem, it seems to be a placeholder or an example of a reasoning question. However, I will demonstrate how to approach a typical reasoning problem step by step.

Let's assume the problem involves basic arithmetic reasoning. For example, suppose the question was:

"Calculate the sum of the first 123 positive integers."

To solve this, we can use the formula for the sum of the first \( n \) positive integers:

\[
S = \frac{n(n + 1)}{2}
\]

where \( n \) is the number of terms. In this case, \( n = 123 \).

Substitute \( n = 123 \) into the formula:

\[
S = \frac{123(123 + 1)}{2}
\]

Calculate \( 123 + 1 \):

\[
123 + 1 = 124
\]

Now substitute back into the formula:

\[
S = \frac{123 \times 124}{2}
\]

Calculate \( 123 \times 124 \):

\[
123 \times 124 = 15252
\]

Now divide by 2 to find the sum:

\[
S = \frac{15252}{2} = 7626
\]

Thus, the sum of the first 123 positive integers is 7626.

Final Answer: 7626

This is a demonstration of how to approach a reasoning problem involving arithmetic. If the original question had a different context or specific details, please provide more information for a tailored solution.
