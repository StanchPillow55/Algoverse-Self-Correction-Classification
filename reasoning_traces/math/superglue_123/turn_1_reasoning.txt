Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To tackle this problem, let's first clarify what "Sample reasoning question 123" might entail. Since the question is not explicitly defined, I'll create a hypothetical math problem and solve it step by step. Let's assume the problem is as follows:

**Problem:**  
Calculate the value of \( x \) in the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).

**Step 1: Understand the Equation**  
The equation given is a simple linear equation in one variable, \( x \). Our goal is to isolate \( x \) on one side of the equation to find its value.

**Step 2: Isolate the Variable**  
To isolate \( x \), we need to perform operations that will leave \( x \) alone on one side of the equation. We start with the equation:

\[ 2x + 3 = 11 \]

**Step 3: Eliminate the Constant Term**  
Subtract 3 from both sides of the equation to eliminate the constant term on the left side:

\[ 2x + 3 - 3 = 11 - 3 \]

This simplifies to:

\[ 2x = 8 \]

**Step 4: Solve for \( x \)**  
Now, divide both sides of the equation by 2 to solve for \( x \):

\[ \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{8}{2} \]

This simplifies to:

\[ x = 4 \]

**Step 5: Verify the Solution**  
To ensure our solution is correct, substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation:

\[ 2(4) + 3 = 11 \]

Calculate the left side:

\[ 8 + 3 = 11 \]

Since both sides of the equation are equal, our solution \( x = 4 \) is correct.

**Final Answer:**  
The value of \( x \) is 4.
