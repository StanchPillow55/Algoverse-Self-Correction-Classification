Dataset Type: math
==================================================

Certainly! Let's tackle this problem step by step, even though the question "Sample reasoning question 123" is not specific. I'll assume it's a placeholder and create a hypothetical math problem to demonstrate the process of solving it.

**Hypothetical Problem:**
Calculate the sum of the first 123 positive integers.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find the sum of the first 123 positive integers. This is a classic problem that can be solved using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series.

2. **Formula for the Sum of an Arithmetic Series:**
   - The sum \( S \) of the first \( n \) positive integers is given by the formula:
     \[
     S = \frac{n(n + 1)}{2}
     \]
   - Here, \( n = 123 \).

3. **Substitute the Value of \( n \):**
   - Plug \( n = 123 \) into the formula:
     \[
     S = \frac{123(123 + 1)}{2}
     \]

4. **Calculate Inside the Parentheses:**
   - First, calculate \( 123 + 1 \):
     \[
     123 + 1 = 124
     \]

5. **Multiply 123 by 124:**
   - Next, calculate \( 123 \times 124 \):
     \[
     123 \times 124 = 15252
     \]

6. **Divide by 2:**
   - Finally, divide the product by 2 to find the sum:
     \[
     S = \frac{15252}{2} = 7626
     \]

7. **Conclusion:**
   - The sum of the first 123 positive integers is 7626.

**Final Answer:**
The sum of the first 123 positive integers is 7626.
