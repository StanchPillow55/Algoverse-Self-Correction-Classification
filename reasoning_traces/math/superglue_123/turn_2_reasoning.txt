Question ID: superglue_123
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To address the problem "Sample reasoning question 123," let's break it down step by step, even though the question itself is not explicitly defined. I'll assume that this is a placeholder for a typical math problem, and I'll demonstrate a structured approach to solving a generic math problem.

### Step 1: Understand the Problem
First, we need to clearly understand what the problem is asking. Since "Sample reasoning question 123" is not specific, let's assume a typical math problem scenario. For example, let's say the problem is:

**Example Problem:** "If a car travels at a constant speed of 60 miles per hour, how far will it travel in 3 hours?"

### Step 2: Identify Known and Unknown Variables
- **Known Variables:**
  - Speed of the car = 60 miles per hour
  - Time traveled = 3 hours

- **Unknown Variable:**
  - Distance traveled = ?

### Step 3: Determine the Formula
To find the distance traveled, we can use the formula for distance in terms of speed and time:
\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]

### Step 4: Substitute Known Values into the Formula
Substitute the known values into the formula:
\[ \text{Distance} = 60 \, \text{miles per hour} \times 3 \, \text{hours} \]

### Step 5: Perform the Calculation
Calculate the distance:
\[ \text{Distance} = 60 \times 3 = 180 \, \text{miles} \]

### Step 6: Verify the Solution
Check if the solution makes sense. The car travels at 60 miles per hour for 3 hours, so it should cover 180 miles, which is consistent with our calculation.

### Step 7: State the Final Answer
The final answer to the example problem is:
- The car will travel 180 miles in 3 hours.

This structured approach can be applied to any math problem by identifying the knowns and unknowns, selecting the appropriate formula, substituting values, performing calculations, and verifying the solution. If you have a specific problem in mind, please provide more details, and I can apply this method to solve it.
