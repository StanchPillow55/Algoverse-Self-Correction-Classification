==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine how much money Marvin and Tina each made from selling candy bars and then find the difference between the two amounts.

**Step 1: Determine the number of candy bars Tina sold.**

Marvin sold 35 candy bars. According to the problem, Tina sold three times the number of candy bars as Marvin. Therefore, the number of candy bars Tina sold is calculated as follows:

\[ \text{Number of candy bars Tina sold} = 3 \times 35 = 105 \]

**Step 2: Calculate the money Marvin made.**

Each candy bar costs $2. Marvin sold 35 candy bars, so the total money Marvin made is:

\[ \text{Money Marvin made} = 35 \times 2 = 70 \text{ dollars} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the money Tina made.**

Tina sold 105 candy bars, and each candy bar costs $2. Therefore, the total money Tina made is:

\[ \text{Money Tina made} = 105 \times 2 = 210 \text{ dollars} \]

**Step 4: Determine how much more money Tina made compared to Marvin.**

To find out how much more money Tina made than Marvin, subtract the amount Marvin made from the amount Tina made:

\[ \text{Difference} = 210 - 70 = 140 \text{ dollars} \]

**Final Answer:**

Tina made $140 more than Marvin by selling candy bars.
