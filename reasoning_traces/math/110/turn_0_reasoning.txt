==================================================

To find out how many fruit roll-ups Marcell and Beatrice ate in total and then calculate the average, we will first determine the total number of roll-ups each person consumed.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of roll-ups for Beatrice.**

Beatrice's roll-ups are described as being 2 roll-ups wide and 24 roll-ups long. To find the total number of roll-ups, we multiply the width by the length:

\[
\text{Total roll-ups for Beatrice} = \text{Width} \times \text{Length} = 2 \times 24
\]

Calculating this gives:

\[
2 \times 24 = 48
\]

So, Beatrice ate **48 roll-ups**.

**Step 2: Calculate the total number of roll-ups for Marcell.**

Marcell's roll-ups are described as being 3 roll-ups wide and 14 roll-ups long. Similarly, we multiply the width by the length:

\[
\text{Total roll-ups for Marcell} = \text{Width} \times \text{Length} = 3 \times 14
\]

Calculating this gives:

\[
3 \times 14 = 42
\]

So, Marcell ate **42 roll-ups**.

**Step 3: Calculate the total number of roll-ups eaten by both.**

Now we add the total roll-ups eaten by Beatrice and Marcell:

\[
\text{Total roll-ups eaten} = \text{Beatrice's roll-ups} + \text{Marcell's roll-ups} = 48 + 42
\]

Calculating this gives:

\[
48 + 42 = 90
\]

**Step 4: Calculate the average number of roll-ups eaten.**

To find the average, we divide the total number of roll-ups eaten by the number of participants (which is 2):

\[
\text{Average} = \frac{\text{Total roll-ups eaten}}{\text{Number of participants}} = \frac{90}{2}
\]

Calculating this gives:

\[
\frac{90}{2} = 45
\]

**Final Answer:**

The average number of fruit roll-ups eaten by Marcell and Beatrice is **45**.
