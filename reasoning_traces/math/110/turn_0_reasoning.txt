To solve the problem, we need to calculate how much money Marvin and Tina made from selling candy bars and then find the difference between their earnings.

1. **Calculate Marvin's Earnings:**
   - Marvin sold 35 candy bars.
   - Each candy bar costs $2.
   - To find Marvin's total earnings, we multiply the number of candy bars he sold by the price per candy bar:
     \[
     \text{Marvin's Earnings} = \text{Number of Candy Bars Sold} \times \text{Price per Candy Bar}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Marvin's Earnings} = 35 \times 2 = 70
     \]
   - Therefore, Marvin made $70.

2. **Calculate Tina's Sales:**
   - Tina sold three times the number of candy bars as Marvin.
   - Since Marvin sold 35 candy bars, we calculate Tina's sales:
     \[
     \text{Tina's Candy Bars Sold} = 3 \times \text{Marvin's Candy Bars Sold}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Tina's Candy Bars Sold} = 3 \times 35 = 105
     \]

3. **Calculate Tina's Earnings:**
   - Now we calculate how much money Tina made:
     \[
     \text{Tina's Earnings} = \text{Number of Candy Bars Sold} \times \text{Price per Candy Bar}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Tina's Earnings} = 105 \times 2 = 210
     \]
   - Therefore, Tina made $210.

4. **Calculate the Difference in Earnings:**
   - To find out how much more money Tina made compared to Marvin, we subtract Marvin's earnings from Tina's earnings:
     \[
     \text{Difference} = \text{Tina's Earnings} - \text{Marvin's Earnings}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Difference} = 210 - 70 = 140
     \]

5. **Final Answer:**
   - Tina made $140 more than Marvin from selling candy bars.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{140}
\]
