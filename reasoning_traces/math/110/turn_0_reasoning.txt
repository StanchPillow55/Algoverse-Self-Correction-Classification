To solve this problem, we need to determine how much money Marvin and Tina each made from selling candy bars and then find the difference between their earnings.

**Step 1: Determine the number of candy bars Tina sold.**

Marvin sold 35 candy bars. According to the problem, Tina sold three times the number of candy bars as Marvin. Therefore, we calculate the number of candy bars Tina sold as follows:

\[
\text{Number of candy bars Tina sold} = 3 \times \text{Number of candy bars Marvin sold} = 3 \times 35 = 105
\]

**Step 2: Calculate the money Marvin made.**

Each candy bar costs $2. Marvin sold 35 candy bars, so the total money Marvin made is:

\[
\text{Money Marvin made} = \text{Number of candy bars Marvin sold} \times \text{Cost per candy bar} = 35 \times 2 = 70
\]

**Step 3: Calculate the money Tina made.**

Tina sold 105 candy bars, and each candy bar also costs $2. Therefore, the total money Tina made is:

\[
\text{Money Tina made} = \text{Number of candy bars Tina sold} \times \text{Cost per candy bar} = 105 \times 2 = 210
\]

**Step 4: Determine how much more money Tina made compared to Marvin.**

To find out how much more money Tina made than Marvin, we subtract the amount Marvin made from the amount Tina made:

\[
\text{Difference in money made} = \text{Money Tina made} - \text{Money Marvin made} = 210 - 70 = 140
\]

**Final Answer:**

Tina made $140 more than Marvin for the class trip by selling candy bars.
