==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample reasoning question 375," let's first break down the information given and identify what is being asked. However, it seems that the problem statement is incomplete or unclear as it stands. Without specific details or numbers, it's challenging to provide a precise solution. 

Let's assume this is a hypothetical math problem involving reasoning and calculations. I'll create a sample problem based on typical reasoning questions and solve it step-by-step.

**Sample Problem:**
A train travels from City A to City B, a distance of 375 miles. If the train travels at an average speed of 75 miles per hour, how long will it take to reach City B?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Identify the Known Values:**
   - Distance between City A and City B = 375 miles
   - Average speed of the train = 75 miles per hour

2. **Identify What Needs to be Found:**
   - The time it takes for the train to travel from City A to City B.

3. **Use the Formula for Time:**
   The formula to calculate time when distance and speed are known is:
   \[
   \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}}
   \]

4. **Substitute the Known Values into the Formula:**
   \[
   \text{Time} = \frac{375 \text{ miles}}{75 \text{ miles per hour}}
   \]

5. **Perform the Calculation:**
   \[
   \text{Time} = \frac{375}{75} = 5 \text{ hours}
   \]

6. **Interpret the Result:**
   The train will take 5 hours to travel from City A to City B at an average speed of 75 miles per hour.

**Final Answer:**
The train will take 5 hours to reach City B.

If you have a specific problem or additional details, please provide them, and I can adjust the solution accordingly.
