==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 375" refers to. Since the question is not explicitly stated, I'll assume it's a placeholder for a typical math problem. Let's create a hypothetical problem and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**

A company produces two types of widgets: Type A and Type B. The production cost for Type A is $5 per unit, and for Type B, it is $8 per unit. The company sells Type A widgets for $10 each and Type B widgets for $15 each. Last month, the company produced a total of 500 widgets and made a total profit of $2,500. How many of each type of widget did the company produce?

**Step-by-step Solution:**

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( x \) be the number of Type A widgets produced.
   - Let \( y \) be the number of Type B widgets produced.

2. **Set Up Equations:**
   - Total widgets produced: 
     \[
     x + y = 500
     \]
   - Profit equation: 
     \[
     \text{Profit from Type A} = (10 - 5)x = 5x
     \]
     \[
     \text{Profit from Type B} = (15 - 8)y = 7y
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total Profit} = 5x + 7y = 2500
     \]

3. **Solve the System of Equations:**
   - We have the system:
     \[
     x + y = 500
     \]
     \[
     5x + 7y = 2500
     \]

   - Solve the first equation for \( x \):
     \[
     x = 500 - y
     \]

   - Substitute \( x = 500 - y \) into the second equation:
     \[
     5(500 - y) + 7y = 2500
     \]
     \[
     2500 - 5y + 7y = 2500
     \]
     \[
     2y = 0
     \]
     \[
     y = 0
     \]

   - Substitute \( y = 0 \) back into the equation for \( x \):
     \[
     x + 0 = 500
     \]
     \[
     x = 500
     \]

4. **Verify the Solution:**
   - Number of Type A widgets: \( x = 500 \)
   - Number of Type B widgets: \( y = 0 \)
   - Total widgets: \( x + y = 500 \) (Correct)
   - Total profit: 
     \[
     5(500) + 7(0) = 2500
     \]
     (Correct)

**Final Answer:**

The company produced 500 Type A widgets and 0 Type B widgets.
