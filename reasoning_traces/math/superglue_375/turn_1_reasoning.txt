Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, I need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 375" refers to. However, without specific details or context about what "Sample reasoning question 375" entails, I will need to make some assumptions. Since the problem is not explicitly stated, I will demonstrate a general approach to solving a typical math problem involving reasoning.

Let's assume "Sample reasoning question 375" is a math problem involving basic arithmetic operations. I will create a hypothetical problem and solve it step-by-step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**
Calculate the sum of the first 10 positive integers and determine if the sum is greater than 50.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Identify the first 10 positive integers:**
   The first 10 positive integers are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10.

2. **Calculate the sum of these integers:**
   To find the sum, we add all the numbers together:
   \[
   1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 10
   \]

3. **Perform the addition:**
   - Start by adding the first two numbers: \(1 + 2 = 3\)
   - Add the next number: \(3 + 3 = 6\)
   - Continue this process:
     - \(6 + 4 = 10\)
     - \(10 + 5 = 15\)
     - \(15 + 6 = 21\)
     - \(21 + 7 = 28\)
     - \(28 + 8 = 36\)
     - \(36 + 9 = 45\)
     - \(45 + 10 = 55\)

4. **Verify the sum:**
   The sum of the first 10 positive integers is 55.

5. **Determine if the sum is greater than 50:**
   Since 55 is greater than 50, the condition is satisfied.

**Final Answer:**
The sum of the first 10 positive integers is 55, and it is greater than 50.

This solution demonstrates a structured approach to solving a math problem by breaking it down into smaller, manageable steps, performing calculations, and verifying the results. If you have a specific problem or context for "Sample reasoning question 375," please provide more details so I can assist you accurately.
