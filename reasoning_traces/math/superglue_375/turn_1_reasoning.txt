==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample reasoning question 375," we need to first understand what the question is asking. However, the question as presented is not clear or specific. It seems to be a placeholder or an incomplete statement. Therefore, I will demonstrate a general approach to solving a typical math problem, which involves understanding the problem, devising a plan, carrying out the plan, and then reviewing the solution.

### Step 1: Understand the Problem
Since the problem is not specified, let's assume a hypothetical math problem. For example, let's solve the following problem:

**Problem:** Solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).

### Step 2: Devise a Plan
To solve the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \), we need to isolate the variable \( x \). This involves performing operations that will get \( x \) by itself on one side of the equation.

### Step 3: Carry Out the Plan
1. **Subtract 3 from both sides**: This will help eliminate the constant term on the left side of the equation.
   \[
   2x + 3 - 3 = 11 - 3
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   2x = 8
   \]

2. **Divide both sides by 2**: This will isolate \( x \).
   \[
   \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{8}{2}
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   x = 4
   \]

### Step 4: Review the Solution
To ensure the solution is correct, substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation to verify:
\[
2(4) + 3 = 11
\]
\[
8 + 3 = 11
\]
\[
11 = 11
\]
The left side equals the right side, confirming that \( x = 4 \) is indeed the correct solution.

### Final Answer
The solution to the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \) is \( x = 4 \).
