To solve the problem, we first need to understand what "Sample math problem 259" refers to. Since no specific problem details are provided, I'll create a sample math problem involving the number 259 and solve it step by step.

**Sample Math Problem:**

Calculate the sum of the digits of the number 259, then multiply the result by 3. Finally, subtract 7 from the product.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Identify the digits of the number 259:**
   - The number 259 consists of the digits 2, 5, and 9.

2. **Calculate the sum of the digits:**
   - Sum = 2 + 5 + 9

   Let's calculate this:
   \[
   2 + 5 = 7
   \]
   \[
   7 + 9 = 16
   \]

   So, the sum of the digits is 16.

3. **Multiply the sum by 3:**
   - Product = 16 \times 3

   Let's calculate this:
   \[
   16 \times 3 = 48
   \]

   So, the product is 48.

4. **Subtract 7 from the product:**
   - Result = 48 - 7

   Let's calculate this:
   \[
   48 - 7 = 41
   \]

   So, the final result is 41.

**Final Answer:**

The final result after performing all the operations is 41.
