To solve the problem, we first need to understand what "Sample math problem 259" refers to. Since the problem is not explicitly stated, I'll create a hypothetical math problem labeled as "Sample math problem 259" and solve it step by step.

Let's assume "Sample math problem 259" is the following:

**Problem:**
Calculate the sum of all even numbers between 1 and 100.

**Solution:**

Step 1: Identify the even numbers between 1 and 100.
- Even numbers are integers divisible by 2.
- The smallest even number greater than 1 is 2.
- The largest even number less than or equal to 100 is 100.

Step 2: List the even numbers between 1 and 100.
- The even numbers are: 2, 4, 6, ..., 98, 100.

Step 3: Determine the sequence of even numbers.
- This is an arithmetic sequence where the first term \( a_1 = 2 \) and the common difference \( d = 2 \).

Step 4: Find the number of terms in the sequence.
- The general formula for the \( n \)-th term of an arithmetic sequence is:
  \[
  a_n = a_1 + (n-1) \cdot d
  \]
- We need to find \( n \) such that \( a_n = 100 \):
  \[
  100 = 2 + (n-1) \cdot 2
  \]
  \[
  100 = 2 + 2n - 2
  \]
  \[
  100 = 2n
  \]
  \[
  n = 50
  \]

Step 5: Calculate the sum of the sequence.
- The sum \( S_n \) of the first \( n \) terms of an arithmetic sequence is given by:
  \[
  S_n = \frac{n}{2} \cdot (a_1 + a_n)
  \]
- Substitute the known values:
  \[
  S_{50} = \frac{50}{2} \cdot (2 + 100)
  \]
  \[
  S_{50} = 25 \cdot 102
  \]
  \[
  S_{50} = 2550
  \]

**Final Answer:**
The sum of all even numbers between 1 and 100 is 2550.
