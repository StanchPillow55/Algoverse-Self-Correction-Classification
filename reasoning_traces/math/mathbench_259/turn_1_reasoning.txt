==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 259," we need to first understand what the problem is asking. However, since "Sample math problem 259" is not a specific math problem, I'll create a hypothetical math problem for demonstration purposes and solve it step by step.

Let's assume "Sample math problem 259" is as follows:

**Problem:**
Calculate the value of \( x \) in the equation \( 3x + 5 = 20 \).

**Solution:**

Step 1: Understand the equation.
The equation given is \( 3x + 5 = 20 \). This is a linear equation in one variable, \( x \).

Step 2: Isolate the variable \( x \).
To solve for \( x \), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We can do this by performing inverse operations.

Step 3: Subtract 5 from both sides.
To eliminate the constant term on the left side, subtract 5 from both sides of the equation:
\[
3x + 5 - 5 = 20 - 5
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
3x = 15
\]

Step 4: Divide both sides by 3.
To solve for \( x \), divide both sides of the equation by 3:
\[
\frac{3x}{3} = \frac{15}{3}
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
x = 5
\]

Step 5: Verify the solution.
Substitute \( x = 5 \) back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies the equation:
\[
3(5) + 5 = 20
\]
Calculate the left side:
\[
15 + 5 = 20
\]
Since both sides of the equation are equal, the solution \( x = 5 \) is correct.

**Final Answer:**
The value of \( x \) is 5.
