==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 259," we first need to understand what the problem is asking. However, the problem statement "Sample math problem 259" is not specific enough for us to determine what the actual math problem is. It seems like a placeholder or a reference to a specific problem that might be found in a textbook or a set of problems.

Since we don't have the actual details of the problem, let's consider a hypothetical math problem that could be labeled as "Sample math problem 259." Let's assume it's a typical algebra problem involving solving an equation. Here's an example problem we can work through:

**Example Problem:**
Solve the equation for \( x \):
\[ 3x + 5 = 20 \]

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Equation:**
   The equation given is \( 3x + 5 = 20 \). Our goal is to solve for \( x \).

2. **Isolate the Variable:**
   To solve for \( x \), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We start by eliminating the constant term on the left side of the equation.

3. **Subtract 5 from Both Sides:**
   \[
   3x + 5 - 5 = 20 - 5
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   3x = 15
   \]

4. **Divide by 3:**
   To solve for \( x \), divide both sides of the equation by 3:
   \[
   \frac{3x}{3} = \frac{15}{3}
   \]
   Simplifying gives:
   \[
   x = 5
   \]

5. **Verify the Solution:**
   Substitute \( x = 5 \) back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies the equation:
   \[
   3(5) + 5 = 20
   \]
   Simplifying the left side gives:
   \[
   15 + 5 = 20
   \]
   \[
   20 = 20
   \]
   The left side equals the right side, confirming that our solution is correct.

**Final Answer:**
The solution to the equation \( 3x + 5 = 20 \) is \( x = 5 \).

If you have a specific problem labeled as "Sample math problem 259," please provide the details, and I will be happy to solve it for you.
