==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to break it down step by step.

1. **Understanding the total number of eggs**: The family prepared 3 dozen boiled eggs. Since 1 dozen equals 12, we calculate the total number of eggs:
   \[
   3 \text{ dozen} = 3 \times 12 = 36 \text{ eggs}
   \]

2. **Calculating the number of eggs given to adults**: There are 3 adults, and each adult received 3 eggs. Therefore, the total number of eggs given to the adults is:
   \[
   3 \text{ adults} \times 3 \text{ eggs/adult} = 9 \text{ eggs}
   \]

3. **Calculating the remaining eggs for children**: We subtract the number of eggs given to adults from the total number of eggs to find out how many eggs are left for the children:
   \[
   36 \text{ eggs} - 9 \text{ eggs} = 27 \text{ eggs}
   \]

4. **Understanding the distribution of eggs among children**: We know that there are 7 girls, and each girl received 1 egg. Therefore, the total number of eggs given to the girls is:
   \[
   7 \text{ girls} \times 1 \text{ egg/girl} = 7 \text{ eggs}
   \]

5. **Calculating the remaining eggs for boys**: We subtract the number of eggs given to the girls from the remaining eggs to find out how many eggs are left for the boys:
   \[
   27 \text{ eggs} - 7 \text{ eggs} = 20 \text{ eggs}
   \]

6. **Understanding the distribution of eggs among boys**: According to the problem, each boy received 1 more egg than each girl. Since each girl received 1 egg, each boy received:
   \[
   1 \text{ egg} + 1 \text{ egg} = 2 \text{ eggs}
   \]

7. **Calculating the number of boys**: Let \( b \) be the number of boys. Since each boy receives 2 eggs, the total number of eggs given to the boys can be expressed as:
   \[
   2b \text{ eggs}
   \]
   We know from our previous calculation that there are 20 eggs for the boys, so we set up the equation:
   \[
   2b = 20
   \]

8. **Solving for \( b \)**: To find the number of boys, we divide both sides of the equation by 2:
   \[
   b = \frac{20}{2} = 10
   \]

Thus, the number of boys who went on the trip is \( \boxed{10} \).
