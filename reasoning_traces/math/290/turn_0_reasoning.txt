To solve this problem, we need to determine how many boys went on the trip given the distribution of eggs among the family members.

First, let's summarize the information given:

1. There are 3 adults.
2. There are 7 girls.
3. The total number of eggs prepared is 3 dozen, which is \(3 \times 12 = 36\) eggs.
4. Each adult receives 3 eggs.
5. Each girl receives 1 egg.
6. Each boy receives 1 more egg than each girl, so each boy receives \(1 + 1 = 2\) eggs.

Let's calculate the total number of eggs distributed to the adults and the girls:

- The 3 adults each receive 3 eggs, so the total number of eggs for the adults is:
  \[
  3 \text{ adults} \times 3 \text{ eggs/adult} = 9 \text{ eggs}
  \]

- The 7 girls each receive 1 egg, so the total number of eggs for the girls is:
  \[
  7 \text{ girls} \times 1 \text{ egg/girl} = 7 \text{ eggs}
  \]

Now, let's calculate the total number of eggs distributed to the adults and the girls combined:
\[
9 \text{ eggs (adults)} + 7 \text{ eggs (girls)} = 16 \text{ eggs}
\]

Since there are 36 eggs in total, the number of eggs left for the boys is:
\[
36 \text{ total eggs} - 16 \text{ eggs (adults and girls)} = 20 \text{ eggs}
\]

Each boy receives 2 eggs. Let \(b\) represent the number of boys. The total number of eggs received by the boys is:
\[
2b \text{ eggs}
\]

Since the boys receive 20 eggs in total, we can set up the equation:
\[
2b = 20
\]

Solving for \(b\), we divide both sides by 2:
\[
b = \frac{20}{2} = 10
\]

Therefore, the number of boys who went on the trip is \(\boxed{10}\).
