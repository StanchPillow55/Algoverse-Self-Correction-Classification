==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to determine how many medals have been given out for counting based on the information provided about Ali and Izzy.

1. **Determine the number of medals Izzy has:**
   - Ali has won 22 medals.
   - Izzy has 5 less medals than Ali.
   - Therefore, the number of medals Izzy has is:
     \[
     \text{Izzy's medals} = \text{Ali's medals} - 5 = 22 - 5 = 17
     \]

2. **Calculate the total number of medals Ali and Izzy have together:**
   - To find the total number of medals they have together, we add the medals of Ali and Izzy:
     \[
     \text{Total medals} = \text{Ali's medals} + \text{Izzy's medals} = 22 + 17 = 39
     \]

3. **Determine the total number of medals given out for counting:**
   - According to the problem, together they have 10 times less medals than the total number of medals given out for counting. This means that the total number of medals given out for counting is 10 times the total number of medals that Ali and Izzy have together.
   - Therefore, we calculate the total number of medals given out:
     \[
     \text{Total medals given out} = 10 \times \text{Total medals} = 10 \times 39 = 390
     \]

4. **Final answer:**
   - The total number of medals that have been given out for counting is:
     \[
     \boxed{390}
     \]
