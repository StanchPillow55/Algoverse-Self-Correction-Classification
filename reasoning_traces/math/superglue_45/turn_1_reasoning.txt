==================================================

To solve the problem effectively, I need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 45" refers to. However, without specific details or context about what "Sample reasoning question 45" entails, I can't directly solve it. Instead, I'll provide a general approach to solving a typical math reasoning problem, which you can adapt to your specific question.

### General Approach to Solving Math Reasoning Problems:

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - Carefully read the problem statement.
   - Identify what is being asked.
   - Note any given data or conditions.

2. **Devise a Plan:**
   - Consider possible strategies to solve the problem. This could include drawing diagrams, creating equations, or breaking the problem into smaller parts.

3. **Carry Out the Plan:**
   - Execute the chosen strategy step by step.
   - Perform calculations carefully.
   - Keep track of units and ensure consistency.

4. **Check Your Work:**
   - Review each step to ensure accuracy.
   - Verify that the solution meets all conditions of the problem.
   - Consider alternative methods to confirm the result.

5. **State the Final Answer:**
   - Clearly present the solution.
   - Include units if applicable.

### Example Problem and Solution:

**Problem:**
A rectangle has a length that is twice its width. If the perimeter of the rectangle is 36 units, what are the dimensions of the rectangle?

**Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We need to find the length and width of the rectangle.
   - Given: Length = 2 Ã— Width, Perimeter = 36 units.

2. **Devise a Plan:**
   - Use the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle: \( P = 2 \times (\text{Length} + \text{Width}) \).

3. **Carry Out the Plan:**
   - Let the width be \( w \).
   - Then the length is \( 2w \).
   - Substitute into the perimeter formula:
     \[
     36 = 2 \times (2w + w)
     \]
   - Simplify and solve for \( w \):
     \[
     36 = 2 \times 3w
     \]
     \[
     36 = 6w
     \]
     \[
     w = 6
     \]
   - Find the length:
     \[
     \text{Length} = 2w = 2 \times 6 = 12
     \]

4. **Check Your Work:**
   - Verify the perimeter with the found dimensions:
     \[
     P = 2 \times (12 + 6) = 2 \times 18 = 36
     \]
   - The calculations are consistent with the given perimeter.

5. **State the Final Answer:**
   - The width of the rectangle is 6 units, and the length is 12 units.

If you provide specific details or context for "Sample reasoning question 45," I can tailor this approach to solve that particular problem.
