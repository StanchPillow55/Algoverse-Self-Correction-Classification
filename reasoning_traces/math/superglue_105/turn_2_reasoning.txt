Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample reasoning question 105," we need to first understand what the question is asking. However, the question as presented is not clear or specific. It appears to be a placeholder or an incomplete problem statement. Without additional context or details, it's impossible to provide a specific solution.

However, I can demonstrate how to approach a typical math problem by creating a hypothetical example and solving it step by step. Let's assume "Sample reasoning question 105" is a math problem involving basic arithmetic operations. Here's an example problem:

**Example Problem:**
Calculate the sum of the first 105 positive integers.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   We need to find the sum of the first 105 positive integers. The sequence of these integers is: 1, 2, 3, ..., 105.

2. **Identify the Formula:**
   The sum of the first \( n \) positive integers can be calculated using the formula:
   \[
   S = \frac{n(n + 1)}{2}
   \]
   where \( S \) is the sum and \( n \) is the number of terms.

3. **Substitute the Values:**
   In this problem, \( n = 105 \). Substitute 105 into the formula:
   \[
   S = \frac{105(105 + 1)}{2}
   \]

4. **Perform the Calculations:**
   - Calculate \( 105 + 1 = 106 \).
   - Multiply 105 by 106:
     \[
     105 \times 106 = 11130
     \]
   - Divide the result by 2:
     \[
     S = \frac{11130}{2} = 5565
     \]

5. **State the Final Answer:**
   The sum of the first 105 positive integers is 5565.

This example demonstrates a structured approach to solving a math problem by understanding the problem, identifying the appropriate formula, substituting values, performing calculations, and stating the final answer. If you have a specific problem or additional details, please provide them, and I can offer a more tailored solution.
