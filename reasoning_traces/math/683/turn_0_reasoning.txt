To solve the problem, we first need to determine the mowing speeds of Chris's lawn mower in both "turtle" and "rabbit" modes.

1. **Determine the mowing speeds:**
   - In "turtle" mode, Chris can mow the entire lawn in 1 hour. Since 1 hour is 60 minutes, his speed in turtle mode is:
     \[
     \text{Speed in turtle mode} = \frac{1 \text{ lawn}}{60 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1}{60} \text{ lawns per minute}
     \]

   - In "rabbit" mode, Chris can mow the entire lawn in 40 minutes. Therefore, his speed in rabbit mode is:
     \[
     \text{Speed in rabbit mode} = \frac{1 \text{ lawn}}{40 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1}{40} \text{ lawns per minute}
     \]

2. **Calculate the time taken to mow half the lawn in each mode:**
   - Since Chris mows half the lawn in turtle mode, he needs to mow \( \frac{1}{2} \) of the lawn. The time taken to mow half the lawn in turtle mode is calculated as follows:
     \[
     \text{Time in turtle mode} = \frac{\text{Amount of lawn}}{\text{Speed in turtle mode}} = \frac{\frac{1}{2} \text{ lawn}}{\frac{1}{60} \text{ lawns per minute}} = \frac{1}{2} \times 60 = 30 \text{ minutes}
     \]

   - Next, Chris mows the other half of the lawn in rabbit mode. The time taken to mow half the lawn in rabbit mode is:
     \[
     \text{Time in rabbit mode} = \frac{\frac{1}{2} \text{ lawn}}{\frac{1}{40} \text{ lawns per minute}} = \frac{1}{2} \times 40 = 20 \text{ minutes}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total time taken to mow the entire lawn:**
   - Now, we add the time taken in both modes to find the total time:
     \[
     \text{Total time} = \text{Time in turtle mode} + \text{Time in rabbit mode} = 30 \text{ minutes} + 20 \text{ minutes} = 50 \text{ minutes}
     \]

Thus, the total time it took Chris to mow the lawn is **50 minutes**.

Final answer:
\[
\boxed{50}
\]
