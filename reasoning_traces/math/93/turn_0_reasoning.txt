Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, let's calculate the cost of the beef. John orders 1000 pounds of beef at $8 per pound. So, the total cost of the beef is 1000 pounds * $8/pound = $8000.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the chicken. John orders twice as much chicken as beef, so he orders 2 * 1000 pounds = 2000 pounds of chicken. The chicken costs $3 per pound, so the total cost of the chicken is 2000 pounds * $3/pound = $6000.

Finally, let's add the cost of the beef and the chicken to find the total cost of everything. The total cost is $8000 (for the beef) + $6000 (for the chicken) = $14000.

So, everything cost $14000.
