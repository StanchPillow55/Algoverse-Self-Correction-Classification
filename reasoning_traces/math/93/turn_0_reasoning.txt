To find the total cost of the food that John ordered, we need to calculate the cost of the beef and the cost of the chicken separately, and then add those two amounts together.

**Step 1: Calculate the cost of the beef.**

John orders 1000 pounds of beef at a price of $8 per pound. 

To find the total cost of the beef, we use the formula:
\[
\text{Total Cost of Beef} = \text{Weight of Beef} \times \text{Price per Pound of Beef}
\]
Substituting in the values:
\[
\text{Total Cost of Beef} = 1000 \, \text{pounds} \times 8 \, \text{dollars/pound} = 8000 \, \text{dollars}
\]

**Step 2: Calculate the amount of chicken ordered.**

John orders twice as much chicken as beef. Since he ordered 1000 pounds of beef, the amount of chicken ordered is:
\[
\text{Weight of Chicken} = 2 \times 1000 \, \text{pounds} = 2000 \, \text{pounds}
\]

**Step 3: Calculate the cost of the chicken.**

The chicken costs $3 per pound. We can find the total cost of the chicken using the same formula:
\[
\text{Total Cost of Chicken} = \text{Weight of Chicken} \times \text{Price per Pound of Chicken}
\]
Substituting in the values:
\[
\text{Total Cost of Chicken} = 2000 \, \text{pounds} \times 3 \, \text{dollars/pound} = 6000 \, \text{dollars}
\]

**Step 4: Calculate the total cost of all food.**

Now we add the total cost of the beef and the total cost of the chicken:
\[
\text{Total Cost} = \text{Total Cost of Beef} + \text{Total Cost of Chicken}
\]
Substituting in the values we calculated:
\[
\text{Total Cost} = 8000 \, \text{dollars} + 6000 \, \text{dollars} = 14000 \, \text{dollars}
\]

**Final Answer:**
The total cost of everything John ordered is \(\boxed{14000}\) dollars.
