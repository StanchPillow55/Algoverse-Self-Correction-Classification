==================================================

To solve the problem, we will follow these steps:

1. **Determine Gerald's original time to run the 400-meter hurdles.**
2. **Calculate the time improvement for Gerald after his diet change.**
3. **Provide the final answer.**

### Step 1: Determine Gerald's Original Time

We know that Lee runs the 400-meter hurdles in 38 seconds. According to the problem, Lee is 2 seconds faster than Gerald. Therefore, we can express Gerald's time as:

\[
\text{Gerald's time} = \text{Lee's time} + 2 \text{ seconds}
\]

Substituting Lee's time:

\[
\text{Gerald's time} = 38 \text{ seconds} + 2 \text{ seconds} = 40 \text{ seconds}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate Gerald's Improved Time

Gerald improved his speed by 10%. To find out how much faster he can run, we first need to calculate 10% of his original time (40 seconds) and then subtract that from his original time.

First, calculate 10% of 40 seconds:

\[
10\% \text{ of } 40 \text{ seconds} = 0.10 \times 40 = 4 \text{ seconds}
\]

Now, we subtract this improvement from Gerald's original time:

\[
\text{Gerald's improved time} = \text{Gerald's original time} - \text{improvement}
\]

Substituting the values we have:

\[
\text{Gerald's improved time} = 40 \text{ seconds} - 4 \text{ seconds} = 36 \text{ seconds}
\]

### Final Answer

Gerald, with his improved diet, can run the 400-meter hurdles in:

\[
\boxed{36} \text{ seconds}
\]
