To solve the problem, we need to break it down step by step.

1. **Understanding the fruit distribution**:
   - You bought a total of 36 fruits, which are evenly split between oranges, apples, and watermelons.
   - Since there are three types of fruits, we can divide the total number of fruits by 3:
     \[
     \text{Number of each type of fruit} = \frac{36}{3} = 12
     \]
   - Therefore, you bought 12 oranges, 12 apples, and 12 watermelons.

2. **Calculating the cost of oranges**:
   - The price of 1 orange is $0.50.
   - The total cost for 12 oranges is:
     \[
     \text{Cost of oranges} = 12 \times 0.50 = 6 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Calculating the total cost of apples and watermelons**:
   - The total bill was $66, and we already calculated the cost of oranges to be $6. Thus, the combined cost of apples and watermelons is:
     \[
     \text{Cost of apples and watermelons} = 66 - 6 = 60 \text{ dollars}
     \]

4. **Setting up the cost relationship**:
   - Let \( p \) be the price of 1 apple. According to the problem, the price of 4 apples is equal to the price of 1 watermelon. Therefore, the price of 1 watermelon can be expressed as:
     \[
     \text{Price of 1 watermelon} = 4p
     \]

5. **Calculating the total cost of apples and watermelons**:
   - Since you bought 12 apples and 12 watermelons, the total cost can be expressed as:
     \[
     \text{Total cost} = 12p + 12(4p) = 12p + 48p = 60p
     \]
   - We know from step 3 that this total cost equals $60:
     \[
     60p = 60
     \]

6. **Solving for the price of 1 apple**:
   - To find \( p \), we divide both sides of the equation by 60:
     \[
     p = \frac{60}{60} = 1
     \]

Thus, the price of 1 apple is **$1**.

**Final Answer**: The cost of 1 apple is $1.
