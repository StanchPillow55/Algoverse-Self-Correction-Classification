==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine the cost of one apple given the conditions. Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Step 1: Define Variables
- Let \( a \) be the number of apples.
- Let \( w \) be the number of watermelons.
- Let \( o \) be the number of oranges.

### Step 2: Set Up Equations Based on the Problem
1. **Total Number of Fruits:**
   \[
   a + w + o = 36
   \]
   Since the fruits are evenly split, we have:
   \[
   a = w = o = \frac{36}{3} = 12
   \]

2. **Price Relationships:**
   - The price of 4 apples is equal to the price of 1 watermelon.
   - Let \( x \) be the price of 1 apple. Then the price of 1 watermelon is \( 4x \).
   - The price of 1 orange is $0.50.

### Step 3: Calculate the Total Cost
The total cost of the fruits is given as $66. We can express this total cost in terms of \( x \):

- **Cost of Apples:**
  \[
  \text{Cost of apples} = 12 \times x = 12x
  \]

- **Cost of Watermelons:**
  \[
  \text{Cost of watermelons} = 12 \times 4x = 48x
  \]

- **Cost of Oranges:**
  \[
  \text{Cost of oranges} = 12 \times 0.50 = 6
  \]

The total cost equation is:
\[
12x + 48x + 6 = 66
\]

### Step 4: Solve for \( x \)
Combine the terms involving \( x \):
\[
60x + 6 = 66
\]

Subtract 6 from both sides:
\[
60x = 60
\]

Divide both sides by 60:
\[
x = 1
\]

### Conclusion
The price of one apple is \( \boxed{1} \) dollar.
