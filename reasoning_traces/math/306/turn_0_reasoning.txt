==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine the heights of Parker, Daisy, and Reese, and then calculate their average height.

1. **Determine Reese's Height:**
   - We are given that Reese is 60 inches tall.

2. **Determine Daisy's Height:**
   - We know that Daisy is 8 inches taller than Reese.
   - Therefore, Daisy's height is:
     \[
     \text{Daisy's height} = \text{Reese's height} + 8 = 60 + 8 = 68 \text{ inches}
     \]

3. **Determine Parker's Height:**
   - We know that Parker is 4 inches shorter than Daisy.
   - Therefore, Parker's height is:
     \[
     \text{Parker's height} = \text{Daisy's height} - 4 = 68 - 4 = 64 \text{ inches}
     \]

4. **Calculate the Average Height:**
   - Now that we have the heights of all three individuals, we can calculate the average height.
   - The formula for the average is:
     \[
     \text{Average height} = \frac{\text{Sum of all heights}}{\text{Number of individuals}}
     \]
   - Sum of all heights:
     \[
     \text{Sum of heights} = \text{Reese's height} + \text{Daisy's height} + \text{Parker's height} = 60 + 68 + 64 = 192 \text{ inches}
     \]
   - Number of individuals = 3
   - Therefore, the average height is:
     \[
     \text{Average height} = \frac{192}{3} = 64 \text{ inches}
     \]

Thus, the average height for Parker, Daisy, and Reese is \(\boxed{64}\) inches.
