To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step.

1. **Total loaves produced**: The bakery produces a total of 60 loaves of bread each day.

2. **Loaves sold in the morning**: According to the problem, two-thirds of the loaves are sold in the morning. We can calculate the number of loaves sold in the morning as follows:
   \[
   \text{Loaves sold in the morning} = \frac{2}{3} \times 60 = 40 \text{ loaves}
   \]

3. **Loaves left after the morning**: After selling 40 loaves in the morning, we need to find out how many loaves are left:
   \[
   \text{Loaves left} = 60 - 40 = 20 \text{ loaves}
   \]

4. **Loaves sold in the afternoon and evening**: The problem states that half of what is left (20 loaves) is sold equally in the afternoon and evening. First, we calculate half of the remaining loaves:
   \[
   \text{Half of loaves left} = \frac{1}{2} \times 20 = 10 \text{ loaves}
   \]

5. **Loaves sold in the afternoon**: Since the 10 loaves are sold equally in the afternoon and evening, we divide this amount by 2 to find out how many loaves are sold in the afternoon:
   \[
   \text{Loaves sold in the afternoon} = \frac{10}{2} = 5 \text{ loaves}
   \]

Now we have completed all the calculations. 

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{5}
\] 

Thus, 5 loaves of bread are sold in the afternoon.
