To solve the problem, we will first determine the heights of Parker, Daisy, and Reese based on the information provided. Then, we will calculate the average height of the three individuals.

1. **Identify Reese's height**:
   - We know that Reese is 60 inches tall.

2. **Calculate Daisy's height**:
   - The problem states that Daisy is 8 inches taller than Reese.
   - Therefore, we can calculate Daisy's height as follows:
     \[
     \text{Daisy's height} = \text{Reese's height} + 8 \text{ inches}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Daisy's height} = 60 \text{ inches} + 8 \text{ inches} = 68 \text{ inches}
     \]

3. **Calculate Parker's height**:
   - The problem states that Parker is 4 inches shorter than Daisy.
   - Therefore, we can calculate Parker's height as follows:
     \[
     \text{Parker's height} = \text{Daisy's height} - 4 \text{ inches}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Parker's height} = 68 \text{ inches} - 4 \text{ inches} = 64 \text{ inches}
     \]

4. **Summarize the heights**:
   - Reese's height: 60 inches
   - Daisy's height: 68 inches
   - Parker's height: 64 inches

5. **Calculate the average height**:
   - To find the average height of the three individuals, we will sum their heights and divide by the number of individuals (which is 3).
   - The sum of their heights is:
     \[
     \text{Total height} = \text{Reese's height} + \text{Daisy's height} + \text{Parker's height}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total height} = 60 \text{ inches} + 68 \text{ inches} + 64 \text{ inches} = 192 \text{ inches}
     \]
   - Now, we calculate the average height:
     \[
     \text{Average height} = \frac{\text{Total height}}{3}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Average height} = \frac{192 \text{ inches}}{3} = 64 \text{ inches}
     \]

6. **Final answer**:
   - The average height for Parker, Daisy, and Reese is **64 inches**.
