Question ID: 306
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the total number of loaves produced**: 
   The bakery produces 60 loaves of bread each day.

2. **Calculate the number of loaves sold in the morning**: 
   According to the problem, two-thirds of the loaves are sold in the morning. 
   \[
   \text{Loaves sold in the morning} = \frac{2}{3} \times 60 = 40 \text{ loaves}
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of loaves left after the morning sales**: 
   After selling 40 loaves in the morning, we need to find out how many loaves are left.
   \[
   \text{Loaves left} = 60 - 40 = 20 \text{ loaves}
   \]

4. **Determine how many loaves are sold in the afternoon and evening**: 
   The problem states that half of what is left (20 loaves) is sold equally in the afternoon and evening. First, we calculate half of the remaining loaves.
   \[
   \text{Loaves sold in the afternoon and evening} = \frac{1}{2} \times 20 = 10 \text{ loaves}
   \]

5. **Calculate the number of loaves sold in the afternoon**: 
   Since the loaves sold in the afternoon and evening are equal, we divide the 10 loaves equally between the two times.
   \[
   \text{Loaves sold in the afternoon} = \frac{10}{2} = 5 \text{ loaves}
   \]

Finally, we conclude that the number of loaves of bread sold in the afternoon is:
\[
\boxed{5}
\]
