Question ID: 306
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine the heights of Parker, Daisy, and Reese, and then calculate their average height.

1. **Determine Reese's Height:**
   - We are given that Reese is 60 inches tall.

2. **Determine Daisy's Height:**
   - The problem states that Daisy is 8 inches taller than Reese.
   - Therefore, Daisy's height is calculated as follows:
     \[
     \text{Daisy's height} = \text{Reese's height} + 8 = 60 + 8 = 68 \text{ inches}
     \]

3. **Determine Parker's Height:**
   - Parker is 4 inches shorter than Daisy.
   - Therefore, Parker's height is calculated as follows:
     \[
     \text{Parker's height} = \text{Daisy's height} - 4 = 68 - 4 = 64 \text{ inches}
     \]

4. **Calculate the Average Height:**
   - To find the average height of Parker, Daisy, and Reese, we sum their heights and divide by 3.
   - Sum of their heights:
     \[
     \text{Total height} = \text{Parker's height} + \text{Daisy's height} + \text{Reese's height} = 64 + 68 + 60 = 192 \text{ inches}
     \]
   - Calculate the average:
     \[
     \text{Average height} = \frac{\text{Total height}}{3} = \frac{192}{3} = 64 \text{ inches}
     \]

Thus, the average height for Parker, Daisy, and Reese is \( \boxed{64} \) inches.
