Question ID: 306
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the total number of loaves produced each day:**
   The bakery produces 60 loaves of bread each day.

2. **Calculate the number of loaves sold in the morning:**
   According to the problem, two-thirds of the loaves are sold in the morning. We can calculate this as follows:
   \[
   \text{Loaves sold in the morning} = \frac{2}{3} \times 60
   \]
   Performing the calculation:
   \[
   \frac{2}{3} \times 60 = 40
   \]
   So, 40 loaves are sold in the morning.

3. **Determine the number of loaves left after the morning sales:**
   To find out how many loaves are left after the morning sales, we subtract the number of loaves sold in the morning from the total number of loaves produced:
   \[
   \text{Loaves left} = 60 - 40 = 20
   \]

4. **Calculate the number of loaves sold in the afternoon:**
   The problem states that half of what is left (after the morning sales) is sold equally in the afternoon and evening. First, we need to find half of the remaining loaves:
   \[
   \text{Half of loaves left} = \frac{1}{2} \times 20 = 10
   \]
   Since this amount is sold equally in the afternoon and evening, we divide this number by 2 to find out how many loaves are sold in the afternoon:
   \[
   \text{Loaves sold in the afternoon} = \frac{10}{2} = 5
   \]

5. **Final Answer:**
   The number of loaves of bread sold in the afternoon is \( \boxed{5} \).
