Question ID: 285
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To determine how many hours John needs to watch each day to finish the show in 5 days, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the Total Viewing Time:**
   - There are 20 episodes.
   - Each episode is 30 minutes long.
   - Total viewing time in minutes = Number of episodes ร Duration of each episode
   \[
   20 \text{ episodes} \times 30 \text{ minutes/episode} = 600 \text{ minutes}
   \]

2. **Convert Total Viewing Time to Hours:**
   - There are 60 minutes in an hour.
   - Total viewing time in hours = Total viewing time in minutes รท 60
   \[
   600 \text{ minutes} \div 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 10 \text{ hours}
   \]

3. **Determine the Daily Viewing Time:**
   - John wants to finish watching in 5 days.
   - Daily viewing time in hours = Total viewing time in hours รท Number of days
   \[
   10 \text{ hours} \div 5 \text{ days} = 2 \text{ hours/day}
   \]

Therefore, John needs to watch **2 hours** of the show each day to finish in 5 days.
