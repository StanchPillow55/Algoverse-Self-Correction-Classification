==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine how many hours John needs to watch the show each day to finish all 20 episodes in 5 days. Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Step 1: Calculate the Total Viewing Time

Each episode is 30 minutes long, and there are 20 episodes in total. To find the total viewing time, we multiply the number of episodes by the length of each episode:

\[
20 \text{ episodes} \times 30 \text{ minutes per episode} = 600 \text{ minutes}
\]

So, John needs to watch a total of 600 minutes of the show.

### Step 2: Convert Total Minutes to Hours

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we convert the total viewing time from minutes to hours:

\[
600 \text{ minutes} \div 60 \text{ minutes per hour} = 10 \text{ hours}
\]

John needs to watch a total of 10 hours of the show.

### Step 3: Determine the Daily Viewing Requirement

John wants to finish the show in 5 days. To find out how many hours he needs to watch each day, we divide the total hours by the number of days:

\[
10 \text{ hours} \div 5 \text{ days} = 2 \text{ hours per day}
\]

Therefore, John needs to watch 2 hours of the show each day to finish all 20 episodes in 5 days.

### Final Answer

John has to watch **2 hours** a day to finish the show in 5 days.
