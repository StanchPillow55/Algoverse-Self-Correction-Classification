==================================================

To determine how many hours John needs to watch each day to finish the show in 5 days, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total time required to watch all episodes**:
   - There are 20 episodes, and each episode is 30 minutes long.
   - Total time in minutes = Number of episodes Ã— Duration of each episode
   \[
   \text{Total time in minutes} = 20 \text{ episodes} \times 30 \text{ minutes/episode} = 600 \text{ minutes}
   \]

2. **Convert total time from minutes to hours**:
   - Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we convert the total time into hours.
   \[
   \text{Total time in hours} = \frac{600 \text{ minutes}}{60 \text{ minutes/hour}} = 10 \text{ hours}
   \]

3. **Determine how many hours John needs to watch each day**:
   - John wants to finish watching in 5 days, so we divide the total hours by the number of days.
   \[
   \text{Hours per day} = \frac{\text{Total time in hours}}{\text{Number of days}} = \frac{10 \text{ hours}}{5 \text{ days}} = 2 \text{ hours/day}
   \]

Thus, John needs to watch **2 hours per day** to finish the show in 5 days.

**Final Answer**: John has to watch **2 hours** each day.
