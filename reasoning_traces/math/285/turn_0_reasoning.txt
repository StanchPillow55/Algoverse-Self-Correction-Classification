To solve the problem, we need to determine the current age of Ann's brother and then calculate how old he will be in 3 years.

1. **Identify Ann's current age**: 
   - Ann is currently 9 years old.

2. **Determine her brother's current age**:
   - The problem states that her brother is twice Ann's age. 
   - Therefore, we calculate her brother's age as follows:
     \[
     \text{Brother's age} = 2 \times \text{Ann's age} = 2 \times 9 = 18 \text{ years old}
     \]

3. **Calculate how old her brother will be in 3 years**:
   - To find out how old her brother will be in 3 years, we add 3 years to his current age:
     \[
     \text{Brother's age in 3 years} = \text{Brother's current age} + 3 = 18 + 3 = 21 \text{ years old}
     \]

4. **Final answer**:
   - Therefore, Ann's brother will be 21 years old in 3 years.

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{21}
\]
