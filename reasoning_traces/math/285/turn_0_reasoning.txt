==================================================

To determine how many hours John needs to watch each day to finish the show in 5 days, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total time required to watch all episodes:**

   - There are 20 episodes.
   - Each episode is 30 minutes long.

   Therefore, the total time in minutes is:
   \[
   20 \text{ episodes} \times 30 \text{ minutes per episode} = 600 \text{ minutes}
   \]

2. **Convert the total time from minutes to hours:**

   Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we convert 600 minutes to hours by dividing by 60:
   \[
   \frac{600 \text{ minutes}}{60 \text{ minutes per hour}} = 10 \text{ hours}
   \]

3. **Determine how many hours John needs to watch per day:**

   John wants to finish the show in 5 days. Therefore, we divide the total hours by the number of days:
   \[
   \frac{10 \text{ hours}}{5 \text{ days}} = 2 \text{ hours per day}
   \]

Thus, John needs to watch **2 hours per day** to finish the show in 5 days.

**Final Answer:**
John needs to watch 2 hours per day.
