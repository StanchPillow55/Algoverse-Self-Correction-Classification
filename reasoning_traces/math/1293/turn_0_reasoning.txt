To find out how much money the company will receive for selling chocolate bars during two weeks, we can break the problem down into several steps.

1. **Determine the daily production of chocolate bars**: 
   The problem states that the company produces 5000 bars in one day.

2. **Calculate the total production over two weeks**:
   There are 7 days in a week, so in two weeks, there are:
   \[
   2 \text{ weeks} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 14 \text{ days}
   \]
   The total number of bars produced in two weeks is:
   \[
   5000 \text{ bars/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 70000 \text{ bars}
   \]

3. **Determine the selling price per bar**:
   The company sells each bar for $2.

4. **Calculate the total revenue from selling the bars**:
   To find the total revenue, we multiply the total number of bars produced by the selling price per bar:
   \[
   70000 \text{ bars} \times 2 \text{ dollars/bar} = 140000 \text{ dollars}
   \]

5. **Final answer**:
   The total amount of money the company will receive for selling the produced chocolate bars during two weeks is:
   \[
   \boxed{140000} \text{ dollars}
   \]
