==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to determine how many minutes Matt worked on Tuesday and then compare that to the number of minutes he worked on Wednesday.

1. **Calculate the minutes worked on Tuesday:**
   - On Monday, Matt worked for 450 minutes.
   - On Tuesday, he worked half the number of minutes he worked on Monday.
   - To find half of 450 minutes, we perform the calculation:
     \[
     \text{Minutes on Tuesday} = \frac{450}{2} = 225 \text{ minutes}
     \]

2. **Minutes worked on Wednesday:**
   - According to the problem, Matt worked for 300 minutes on Wednesday.

3. **Calculate how many more minutes he worked on Wednesday than on Tuesday:**
   - We need to find the difference between the minutes worked on Wednesday and the minutes worked on Tuesday:
   \[
   \text{Difference} = \text{Minutes on Wednesday} - \text{Minutes on Tuesday}
   \]
   - Substituting the values we calculated:
   \[
   \text{Difference} = 300 - 225 = 75 \text{ minutes}
   \]

Thus, Matt worked **75 more minutes on Wednesday than on Tuesday**.

Final answer: **75 minutes**.
