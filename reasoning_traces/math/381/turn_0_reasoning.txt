==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine how many minutes Matt worked on Tuesday and then compare that to the number of minutes he worked on Wednesday.

1. **Calculate the number of minutes Matt worked on Tuesday:**

   We know that on Tuesday, Matt worked half the number of minutes he worked on Monday. On Monday, Matt worked for 450 minutes.

   \[
   \text{Minutes worked on Tuesday} = \frac{450}{2} = 225 \text{ minutes}
   \]

2. **Determine the number of minutes Matt worked on Wednesday:**

   According to the problem, Matt worked for 300 minutes on Wednesday.

3. **Calculate the difference in minutes between Wednesday and Tuesday:**

   We need to find out how many more minutes Matt worked on Wednesday than on Tuesday. This can be calculated by subtracting the minutes worked on Tuesday from the minutes worked on Wednesday.

   \[
   \text{Difference} = \text{Minutes on Wednesday} - \text{Minutes on Tuesday} = 300 - 225 = 75 \text{ minutes}
   \]

Therefore, Matt worked 75 more minutes on Wednesday than he did on Tuesday.

**Final Answer: 75 minutes**
