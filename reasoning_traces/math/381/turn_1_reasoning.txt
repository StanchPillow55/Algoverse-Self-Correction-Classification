Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine how many minutes Matt worked on Tuesday and then compare that to the number of minutes he worked on Wednesday. Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Determine the number of minutes Matt worked on Tuesday:**

   We know from the problem statement that on Tuesday, Matt worked half the number of minutes he worked on Monday. On Monday, Matt worked for 450 minutes. Therefore, to find out how many minutes he worked on Tuesday, we need to calculate half of 450 minutes.

   \[
   \text{Minutes worked on Tuesday} = \frac{450}{2} = 225 \text{ minutes}
   \]

2. **Determine the number of minutes Matt worked on Wednesday:**

   The problem states that Matt worked for 300 minutes on Wednesday.

3. **Calculate how many more minutes Matt worked on Wednesday than on Tuesday:**

   To find out how many more minutes Matt worked on Wednesday compared to Tuesday, we subtract the number of minutes he worked on Tuesday from the number of minutes he worked on Wednesday.

   \[
   \text{Difference in minutes} = \text{Minutes on Wednesday} - \text{Minutes on Tuesday} = 300 - 225 = 75 \text{ minutes}
   \]

Therefore, Matt worked 75 more minutes on Wednesday than he did on Tuesday.

**Final Answer: 75 minutes**
