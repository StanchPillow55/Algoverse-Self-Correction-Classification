Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we first need to understand what "Sample reasoning question 314" refers to. However, since the question is not explicitly stated, I'll demonstrate a general approach to solving a math problem by considering a hypothetical example. Let's assume "Sample reasoning question 314" is a typical math problem involving algebra. Here's how we might approach it:

### Hypothetical Problem:
Solve for \( x \) in the equation: 
\[ 2x + 3 = 11 \]

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We need to find the value of \( x \) that satisfies the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).

2. **Isolate the Variable:**
   - To solve for \( x \), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We start by eliminating the constant term on the left side.
   - Subtract 3 from both sides of the equation:
     \[
     2x + 3 - 3 = 11 - 3
     \]
   - Simplifying both sides gives:
     \[
     2x = 8
     \]

3. **Solve for \( x \):**
   - Now, divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( x \):
     \[
     \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{8}{2}
     \]
   - Simplifying gives:
     \[
     x = 4
     \]

4. **Verify the Solution:**
   - Substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies the equation:
     \[
     2(4) + 3 = 11
     \]
   - Simplifying the left side:
     \[
     8 + 3 = 11
     \]
   - Since both sides of the equation are equal, \( x = 4 \) is indeed the correct solution.

### Final Answer:
The solution to the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \) is \( x = 4 \).

This step-by-step approach demonstrates how to solve a basic algebraic equation by isolating the variable, performing arithmetic operations, and verifying the solution. If "Sample reasoning question 314" refers to a different problem, please provide the specific details or context so I can address it accurately.
