==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 314" entails. Since the question is not explicitly stated, I'll assume it's a placeholder for a typical math problem. Let's create a sample math problem and solve it step by step.

**Sample Problem:**

A rectangle has a length that is twice its width. If the perimeter of the rectangle is 48 units, what are the dimensions of the rectangle?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We have a rectangle.
   - Let the width of the rectangle be \( w \).
   - The length of the rectangle is twice the width, so the length is \( 2w \).
   - The perimeter of the rectangle is given as 48 units.

2. **Recall the Formula for Perimeter:**
   - The perimeter \( P \) of a rectangle is given by the formula:
     \[
     P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width})
     \]

3. **Substitute the Known Values:**
   - Substitute the expressions for length and width into the perimeter formula:
     \[
     48 = 2 \times (2w + w)
     \]

4. **Simplify the Equation:**
   - Simplify the expression inside the parentheses:
     \[
     48 = 2 \times (3w)
     \]
   - Simplify further:
     \[
     48 = 6w
     \]

5. **Solve for \( w \):**
   - Divide both sides of the equation by 6 to solve for \( w \):
     \[
     w = \frac{48}{6} = 8
     \]

6. **Find the Length:**
   - Since the length is twice the width, calculate the length:
     \[
     \text{Length} = 2w = 2 \times 8 = 16
     \]

7. **Verify the Solution:**
   - Check that the dimensions satisfy the perimeter condition:
     \[
     P = 2 \times (16 + 8) = 2 \times 24 = 48
     \]
   - The calculated perimeter matches the given perimeter, confirming our solution is correct.

**Final Answer:**

The dimensions of the rectangle are:
- Width = 8 units
- Length = 16 units
