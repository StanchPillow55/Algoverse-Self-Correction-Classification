==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample math problem 368" refers to. Since the problem itself is not provided, I'll create a hypothetical math problem labeled as "Sample math problem 368" and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem 368:**

*Calculate the sum of the first 20 positive even numbers.*

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Identify the Sequence:**
   - The sequence of the first 20 positive even numbers is: 2, 4, 6, 8, ..., 40.

2. **Recognize the Pattern:**
   - This sequence is an arithmetic sequence where the first term \( a_1 = 2 \) and the common difference \( d = 2 \).

3. **Find the nth Term:**
   - The nth term of an arithmetic sequence can be found using the formula:
     \[
     a_n = a_1 + (n-1) \cdot d
     \]
   - For the 20th term:
     \[
     a_{20} = 2 + (20-1) \cdot 2 = 2 + 38 = 40
     \]

4. **Sum of the Sequence:**
   - The sum \( S_n \) of the first \( n \) terms of an arithmetic sequence is given by:
     \[
     S_n = \frac{n}{2} \cdot (a_1 + a_n)
     \]
   - Substituting the known values:
     \[
     S_{20} = \frac{20}{2} \cdot (2 + 40) = 10 \cdot 42 = 420
     \]

5. **Verify the Calculation:**
   - To ensure accuracy, let's verify by calculating the sum directly:
     \[
     2 + 4 + 6 + \ldots + 40
     \]
   - Pair the numbers from the start and end:
     \[
     (2 + 40), (4 + 38), (6 + 36), \ldots, (20 + 22)
     \]
   - Each pair sums to 42, and there are 10 such pairs:
     \[
     10 \cdot 42 = 420
     \]

**Final Answer:**

The sum of the first 20 positive even numbers is \( \boxed{420} \).
