To determine how long it will take Bob to dig the hole, we first need to calculate the volume of the hole he wants to dig. The volume of a rectangular prism (which is the shape of the hole) can be calculated using the formula:

\[
\text{Volume} = \text{Length} \times \text{Width} \times \text{Depth}
\]

Given the dimensions of the hole:
- Length = 6 feet
- Width = 4 feet
- Depth = 3 feet

We can substitute these values into the formula:

\[
\text{Volume} = 6 \, \text{feet} \times 4 \, \text{feet} \times 3 \, \text{feet}
\]

Now, we perform the multiplication step-by-step:

1. First, multiply the length and width:
   \[
   6 \times 4 = 24 \, \text{square feet}
   \]

2. Next, multiply the result by the depth:
   \[
   24 \, \text{square feet} \times 3 \, \text{feet} = 72 \, \text{cubic feet}
   \]

So, the volume of the hole is \(72\) cubic feet.

Next, we need to determine how long it will take Bob to dig out this volume of earth. We know that it takes Bob 3 seconds to shovel 1 cubic foot of earth. Therefore, to find the total time required to dig out 72 cubic feet, we multiply the volume by the time per cubic foot:

\[
\text{Total time} = \text{Volume} \times \text{Time per cubic foot}
\]

Substituting the known values:

\[
\text{Total time} = 72 \, \text{cubic feet} \times 3 \, \text{seconds per cubic foot}
\]

Now, we perform the multiplication:

\[
\text{Total time} = 72 \times 3 = 216 \, \text{seconds}
\]

Finally, we can convert seconds into minutes if needed, but since the question asks for the total time in seconds, we will state our final answer in seconds.

Thus, the total time it will take Bob to dig the hole is:

\[
\boxed{216} \text{ seconds}
\]
