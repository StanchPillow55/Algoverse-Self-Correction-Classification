==================================================

To solve "Sample math problem 208," we first need to understand what the problem entails. Since the problem itself isn't specified, I'll create a hypothetical math problem and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem 208:**

Calculate the value of \( x \) in the equation:

\[ 3x + 5 = 2x + 15 \]

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Equation:**
   - We have a linear equation in one variable, \( x \).

2. **Isolate the Variable:**
   - To solve for \( x \), we need to get all terms involving \( x \) on one side of the equation and constant terms on the other side.

3. **Subtract \( 2x \) from Both Sides:**
   \[
   3x + 5 - 2x = 2x + 15 - 2x
   \]
   - This simplifies to:
   \[
   x + 5 = 15
   \]

4. **Subtract 5 from Both Sides:**
   \[
   x + 5 - 5 = 15 - 5
   \]
   - This simplifies to:
   \[
   x = 10
   \]

5. **Verify the Solution:**
   - Substitute \( x = 10 \) back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies the equation:
   \[
   3(10) + 5 = 2(10) + 15
   \]
   - Simplify both sides:
   \[
   30 + 5 = 20 + 15
   \]
   \[
   35 = 35
   \]
   - Since both sides of the equation are equal, our solution \( x = 10 \) is correct.

**Final Answer:**

The value of \( x \) is \( 10 \).
