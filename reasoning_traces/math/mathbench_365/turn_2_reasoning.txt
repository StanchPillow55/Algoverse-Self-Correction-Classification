Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we first need to understand what "Sample math problem 365" refers to. Since the problem is not explicitly stated, let's assume a common mathematical problem involving the number 365. A typical problem might involve calculating something related to the number of days in a year, which is 365.

Let's consider a problem involving the calculation of the number of weeks and days in a year:

**Problem:** How many weeks and additional days are there in a standard year of 365 days?

**Step-by-step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We need to determine how many full weeks are in 365 days and how many days are left over.

2. **Recall Basic Facts:**
   - A week consists of 7 days.

3. **Perform the Division:**
   - To find out how many full weeks are in 365 days, we divide 365 by 7.

   \[
   365 \div 7 = 52 \text{ weeks with a remainder}
   \]

4. **Calculate the Remainder:**
   - To find the remainder, we can use the division process:
     - \( 7 \times 52 = 364 \)
     - Subtract 364 from 365 to find the leftover days:
     \[
     365 - 364 = 1
     \]

5. **Interpret the Result:**
   - The division tells us that there are 52 full weeks in 365 days.
   - The remainder tells us there is 1 additional day beyond these 52 weeks.

6. **Conclusion:**
   - There are 52 weeks and 1 additional day in a standard year of 365 days.

**Final Answer:**
In a standard year of 365 days, there are 52 weeks and 1 additional day.
