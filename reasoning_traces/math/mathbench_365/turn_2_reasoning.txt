Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we first need to understand what "Sample math problem 365" refers to. Since no specific problem is given, let's assume it is a generic math problem involving the number 365. A common problem involving this number could be related to the number of days in a year. Let's create a problem based on this context:

**Problem:**
If a person saves $1 on the first day of the year, $2 on the second day, $3 on the third day, and continues this pattern of saving an additional dollar each day, how much money will they have saved by the end of the year (assuming a non-leap year with 365 days)?

**Solution:**

To solve this problem, we need to find the sum of the first 365 natural numbers. The formula for the sum of the first \( n \) natural numbers is:

\[
S = \frac{n(n + 1)}{2}
\]

In this case, \( n = 365 \). Plugging this into the formula gives:

\[
S = \frac{365 \times (365 + 1)}{2}
\]

First, calculate \( 365 + 1 \):

\[
365 + 1 = 366
\]

Next, multiply 365 by 366:

\[
365 \times 366 = 133590
\]

Now, divide the product by 2 to find the sum:

\[
S = \frac{133590}{2} = 66795
\]

Therefore, by the end of the year, the person will have saved a total of $66,795.

**Final Answer:**
The person will have saved $66,795 by the end of the year.
