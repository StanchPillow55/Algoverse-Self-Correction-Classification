==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 365," we need to first understand what the problem is asking. However, the problem statement is incomplete as it only states "Sample math problem 365" without any specific details or context. Therefore, I will assume that this is a placeholder for a typical math problem that involves the number 365 in some way. 

Let's consider a common problem involving the number 365, such as calculating the number of days in a year. We can create a problem based on this context:

**Problem:** If a year has 365 days, how many weeks and days are there in a year?

**Step-by-step Solution:**

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We know that a week consists of 7 days.
   - We need to determine how many full weeks and additional days are in 365 days.

2. **Calculating the Number of Full Weeks:**
   - To find the number of full weeks in 365 days, we divide 365 by 7.
   \[
   \text{Number of weeks} = \frac{365}{7} = 52 \text{ weeks with a remainder}
   \]

3. **Calculating the Remainder Days:**
   - After dividing, we find the remainder to determine the extra days beyond the full weeks.
   \[
   365 \div 7 = 52 \text{ R } 1
   \]
   - This means there are 52 full weeks and 1 extra day.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - In a year with 365 days, there are 52 weeks and 1 additional day.

**Final Answer:**
A year with 365 days consists of 52 weeks and 1 day.

This solution assumes a typical non-leap year scenario. If you have a different problem involving the number 365, please provide more details so I can assist you accurately.
