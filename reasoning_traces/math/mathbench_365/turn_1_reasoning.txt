==================================================

To solve the problem labeled "Sample math problem 365," we need to first understand what the problem is asking. Since the problem statement is not provided, I'll assume a generic math problem involving the number 365. Let's consider a problem involving basic arithmetic operations with the number 365.

**Problem:** What is the sum of the digits of the number 365, and what is the result when you multiply this sum by 3?

**Step-by-step Solution:**

1. **Identify the digits of the number 365:**
   - The number 365 consists of three digits: 3, 6, and 5.

2. **Calculate the sum of the digits:**
   - Add the digits together: \(3 + 6 + 5\).
   - Perform the addition:
     \[
     3 + 6 = 9
     \]
     \[
     9 + 5 = 14
     \]
   - The sum of the digits is 14.

3. **Multiply the sum by 3:**
   - Take the sum of the digits, which is 14, and multiply it by 3:
     \[
     14 \times 3 = 42
     \]

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The sum of the digits of 365 is 14, and when this sum is multiplied by 3, the result is 42.

Therefore, the final answer to the problem is 42.
