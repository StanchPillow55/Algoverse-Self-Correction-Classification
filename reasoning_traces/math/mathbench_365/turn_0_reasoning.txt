==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample math problem 365" refers to. Since this is not a standard problem statement, I'll assume it's a placeholder for a specific math problem. Let's create a hypothetical problem based on common math topics and solve it step-by-step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**

Calculate the sum of all integers from 1 to 365.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

To find the sum of all integers from 1 to 365, we can use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series. The formula for the sum \( S \) of the first \( n \) integers is:

\[
S = \frac{n(n + 1)}{2}
\]

where \( n \) is the last integer in the series. In this case, \( n = 365 \).

**Step 1: Identify \( n \)**

Here, \( n = 365 \).

**Step 2: Apply the formula**

Substitute \( n = 365 \) into the formula:

\[
S = \frac{365(365 + 1)}{2}
\]

**Step 3: Simplify the expression**

First, calculate \( 365 + 1 \):

\[
365 + 1 = 366
\]

Now substitute back into the formula:

\[
S = \frac{365 \times 366}{2}
\]

**Step 4: Perform the multiplication**

Calculate \( 365 \times 366 \):

\[
365 \times 366 = 133590
\]

**Step 5: Divide by 2**

Now divide the product by 2 to find the sum:

\[
S = \frac{133590}{2} = 66795
\]

**Final Answer:**

The sum of all integers from 1 to 365 is \( 66795 \).

Thus, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{66795}
\]
