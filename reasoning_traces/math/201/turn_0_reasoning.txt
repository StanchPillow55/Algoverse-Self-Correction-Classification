To find out how much money John made that year, we need to consider both the monetary reward from the award and the increase in his salary due to the raise.

### Step 1: Calculate John's annual salary before the raise

John makes $2000 a week. To find his annual salary before the raise, we multiply his weekly salary by the number of weeks in a year:

\[
\text{Annual Salary} = \text{Weekly Salary} \times \text{Number of Weeks in a Year}
\]

\[
\text{Annual Salary} = 2000 \times 52 = 104000
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the raise

John receives a 5% raise on his salary. To find the amount of the raise, we calculate 5% of his current annual salary:

\[
\text{Raise} = \text{Annual Salary} \times 0.05
\]

\[
\text{Raise} = 104000 \times 0.05 = 5200
\]

### Step 3: Calculate John's new annual salary after the raise

Now, we add the raise to his original annual salary to find his new salary:

\[
\text{New Annual Salary} = \text{Annual Salary} + \text{Raise}
\]

\[
\text{New Annual Salary} = 104000 + 5200 = 109200
\]

### Step 4: Calculate total earnings for the year

John also receives a one-time monetary reward of $5000. To find his total earnings for the year, we add this reward to his new annual salary:

\[
\text{Total Earnings} = \text{New Annual Salary} + \text{Monetary Reward}
\]

\[
\text{Total Earnings} = 109200 + 5000 = 114200
\]

### Final Answer

Thus, the total amount of money John made that year is:

\[
\boxed{114200}
\]
