To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step and calculate the total number of apples Archibald eats over the 7 weeks, then find the average per week.

### Step 1: Calculate the number of apples eaten in the first two weeks.

Archibald eats 1 apple a day for two weeks. 

- Number of days in two weeks = 2 weeks × 7 days/week = 14 days.
- Apples eaten in the first two weeks = 1 apple/day × 14 days = 14 apples.

### Step 2: Calculate the number of apples eaten in the next three weeks.

In the next three weeks, he eats the same number of apples as he did in the first two weeks, which is 14 apples.

- Apples eaten in the next three weeks = 14 apples.

### Step 3: Calculate the number of apples eaten in the following two weeks.

In the last two weeks, Archibald eats 3 apples a day.

- Number of days in two weeks = 2 weeks × 7 days/week = 14 days.
- Apples eaten in the last two weeks = 3 apples/day × 14 days = 42 apples.

### Step 4: Calculate the total number of apples eaten over the 7 weeks.

Now we will sum the apples eaten in all the weeks:

- Total apples = Apples from first two weeks + Apples from next three weeks + Apples from last two weeks
- Total apples = 14 apples + 14 apples + 42 apples
- Total apples = 70 apples.

### Step 5: Calculate the average number of apples eaten per week.

To find the average number of apples eaten per week, we divide the total number of apples by the total number of weeks.

- Total number of weeks = 7 weeks.
- Average apples per week = Total apples / Total weeks = 70 apples / 7 weeks = 10 apples/week.

### Final Answer

The average number of apples Archibald eats per week over the 7 weeks is **10 apples**.
