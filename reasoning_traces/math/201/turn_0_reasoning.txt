To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of apples Archibald eats over the 7 weeks and then find the average number of apples he eats per week.

### Step 1: Calculate the number of apples eaten in the first two weeks.

Archibald eats 1 apple a day for two weeks. There are 7 days in a week, so in two weeks, there are:
\[ 2 \times 7 = 14 \text{ days} \]

Since he eats 1 apple per day, the total number of apples eaten in the first two weeks is:
\[ 1 \text{ apple/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 14 \text{ apples} \]

### Step 2: Calculate the number of apples eaten in the next three weeks.

Over the next three weeks, Archibald eats the same number of apples as he did in the first two weeks. From Step 1, we know he ate 14 apples in the first two weeks. Therefore, in the next three weeks, he also eats:
\[ 14 \text{ apples} \]

### Step 3: Calculate the number of apples eaten in the last two weeks.

In the last two weeks, Archibald eats 3 apples a day. Again, there are 14 days in two weeks:
\[ 3 \text{ apples/day} \times 14 \text{ days} = 42 \text{ apples} \]

### Step 4: Calculate the total number of apples eaten over the 7 weeks.

Now, we add up the apples eaten in each period:
- First two weeks: 14 apples
- Next three weeks: 14 apples
- Last two weeks: 42 apples

Total apples eaten:
\[ 14 + 14 + 42 = 70 \text{ apples} \]

### Step 5: Calculate the average number of apples eaten per week.

The total number of weeks is 7. To find the average number of apples eaten per week, we divide the total number of apples by the total number of weeks:
\[ \text{Average apples per week} = \frac{70 \text{ apples}}{7 \text{ weeks}} = 10 \text{ apples/week} \]

Therefore, Archibald averages \(\boxed{10}\) apples per week over the 7 weeks.
