==================================================

To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the number of fish with red stripes:**
   - We know there are a total of 66 fish in the tank.
   - One-third of the fish have red stripes. To find this, we calculate:
     \[
     \text{Number of fish with red stripes} = \frac{1}{3} \times 66 = 22
     \]

2. **Calculate the remaining fish after accounting for those with red stripes:**
   - To find the remaining fish, we subtract the number of fish with red stripes from the total number of fish:
     \[
     \text{Remaining fish} = 66 - 22 = 44
     \]

3. **Determine the number of fish with blue stripes:**
   - We are told that \( \frac{5}{11} \) of the remaining fish have blue stripes. We need to calculate this:
     \[
     \text{Number of fish with blue stripes} = \frac{5}{11} \times 44
     \]
   - First, we simplify \( \frac{5}{11} \times 44 \):
     \[
     \frac{5 \times 44}{11} = \frac{220}{11} = 20
     \]

4. **Calculate the total number of fish with red and blue stripes:**
   - Now, we add the number of fish with red stripes and the number of fish with blue stripes:
     \[
     \text{Total fish with red and blue stripes} = 22 + 20 = 42
     \]

5. **Final answer:**
   - Therefore, the total number of fish that have red stripes and blue stripes is:
     \[
     \boxed{42}
     \]
