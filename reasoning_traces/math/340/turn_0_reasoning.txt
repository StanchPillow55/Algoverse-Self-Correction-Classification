To solve the problem, we need to determine how many balls Josh is juggling when he walks on stage for the talent show, taking into account the number of balls he practices with and the number of balls he loses during his performance.

1. **Determine the number of balls Josh practices with each week:**
   - Josh starts practicing with 3 balls.
   - He adds 1 ball to his juggling act each week.
   - We need to calculate how many balls he will be juggling at the end of each week for 4 weeks.

   - **Week 1:** 3 balls (initial)
   - **Week 2:** 3 + 1 = 4 balls
   - **Week 3:** 4 + 1 = 5 balls
   - **Week 4:** 5 + 1 = 6 balls

   After 4 weeks, Josh is practicing with **6 balls**.

2. **Determine how many balls he has after slipping on stage:**
   - When Josh walks on stage, he has 6 balls.
   - He slips and drops 3 balls.
   - Out of the 3 dropped balls, 2 are caught by people in the crowd, and 1 is lost completely.

   Therefore, the number of balls he retains after the incident is calculated as follows:
   - Initial number of balls: 6
   - Balls dropped: 3
   - Balls caught: 2
   - Balls lost: 1

   The number of balls he has after the incident:
   \[
   \text{Balls remaining} = \text{Initial balls} - \text{Balls dropped} + \text{Balls caught}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Balls remaining} = 6 - 3 + 2 = 5
   \]

3. **Final count of balls Josh is juggling on stage:**
   - After accounting for the balls he dropped and those that were caught, Josh is left with **5 balls**.

Thus, the final answer is that Josh starts to juggle on stage with **5 balls**.
