To solve this problem, we need to determine how many pieces of 20-foot rope Tom needs to buy in order to lower a rope down 6 stories, considering the loss due to lashing them together.

### Step-by-step Solution:

1. **Calculate the Total Length of Rope Needed:**
   - Each story is 10 feet.
   - Tom needs to lower the rope down 6 stories.
   - Therefore, the total length of rope needed is:
     \[
     6 \text{ stories} \times 10 \text{ feet/story} = 60 \text{ feet}
     \]

2. **Understand the Rope Loss Due to Lashing:**
   - Each piece of rope is 20 feet long.
   - When two pieces are lashed together, 25% of one piece is lost.
   - 25% of a 20-foot piece is:
     \[
     0.25 \times 20 \text{ feet} = 5 \text{ feet}
     \]
   - Therefore, when two pieces are lashed together, the effective length of the two pieces is:
     \[
     20 \text{ feet} + 20 \text{ feet} - 5 \text{ feet} = 35 \text{ feet}
     \]

3. **Determine the Number of Pieces Needed:**
   - We need to find how many 20-foot pieces, when lashed together, will provide at least 60 feet of effective rope.
   - Let's calculate the effective length for different numbers of pieces:
     - **1 piece**: 20 feet (not enough)
     - **2 pieces**: 35 feet (not enough)
     - **3 pieces**: 
       - First lashing: 35 feet (from 2 pieces)
       - Add 1 more piece: 35 feet + 20 feet - 5 feet (for lashing) = 50 feet (not enough)
     - **4 pieces**:
       - First lashing: 35 feet (from 2 pieces)
       - Second lashing: 35 feet + 35 feet - 5 feet (for lashing) = 65 feet (enough)

4. **Conclusion:**
   - With 4 pieces of 20-foot rope, after accounting for the loss due to lashing, Tom will have 65 feet of effective rope, which is sufficient to cover the 60 feet needed.

Therefore, Tom needs to buy **4 pieces** of 20-foot rope.
