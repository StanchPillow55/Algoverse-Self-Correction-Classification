To determine how many pieces of rope Tom needs to buy, we can break the problem down into several steps.

### Step 1: Calculate the total height Tom needs to lower the rope.

Tom needs to lower the rope down 6 stories, and each story is 10 feet high. Therefore, the total height \( H \) that Tom needs to cover is:

\[
H = \text{number of stories} \times \text{height of each story}
\]
\[
H = 6 \times 10 = 60 \text{ feet}
\]

### Step 2: Determine the effective length of rope when lashing them together.

Each piece of rope is 20 feet long, but when lashing them together, 25% of the total length is lost. First, we need to calculate how much length is lost when two pieces of rope are lashed together.

The length lost when lashing two pieces together is:

\[
\text{Length lost} = 0.25 \times \text{total length of two ropes}
\]
\[
\text{Total length of two ropes} = 20 + 20 = 40 \text{ feet}
\]
\[
\text{Length lost} = 0.25 \times 40 = 10 \text{ feet}
\]

Now, we can find the effective length of the two ropes when lashed together:

\[
\text{Effective length} = \text{Total length of two ropes} - \text{Length lost}
\]
\[
\text{Effective length} = 40 - 10 = 30 \text{ feet}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate how many pieces of rope are needed.

Now we need to determine how many pieces of 20-foot rope are required to cover the total height of 60 feet. 

Let \( n \) be the number of pieces of rope needed. The effective length of \( n \) pieces of rope can be calculated as follows:

1. If \( n = 1 \), the effective length is 20 feet (no lashing).
2. If \( n = 2 \), the effective length is 30 feet (after lashing).
3. If \( n = 3 \), the effective length is:
   - Total length = \( 3 \times 20 = 60 \) feet
   - Length lost = \( 0.25 \times 60 = 15 \) feet
   - Effective length = \( 60 - 15 = 45 \) feet
4. If \( n = 4 \), the effective length is:
   - Total length = \( 4 \times 20 = 80 \) feet
   - Length lost = \( 0.25 \times 80 = 20 \) feet
   - Effective length = \( 80 - 20 = 60 \) feet

From the calculations above, we can see that:

- With 3 pieces of rope, the effective length is 45 feet, which is not enough to cover 60 feet.
- With 4 pieces of rope, the effective length is exactly 60 feet, which is sufficient.

### Final Answer

Thus, Tom needs to buy **4 pieces of rope** to lower the rope down 6 stories.
