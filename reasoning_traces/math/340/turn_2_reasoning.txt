Question ID: 340
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Practice**: Josh starts practicing juggling with 3 balls.

2. **Weekly Progression**: He adds 1 ball to his juggling act each week. Therefore, we can calculate how many balls he will be juggling at the end of each week:
   - **Week 1**: 3 balls (initial)
   - **Week 2**: 3 + 1 = 4 balls
   - **Week 3**: 4 + 1 = 5 balls
   - **Week 4**: 5 + 1 = 6 balls

   So, at the end of the fourth week, Josh is juggling 6 balls.

3. **Talent Show Incident**: When Josh walks on stage, he slips and drops 3 of his balls. 

4. **Balls Caught and Lost**: Out of the 3 balls he dropped:
   - 2 balls are caught by people in the crowd.
   - 1 ball gets lost completely.

5. **Calculating Remaining Balls**: Initially, Josh had 6 balls. After dropping 3 balls, we calculate how many he has left:
   - Balls dropped: 3
   - Balls remaining after the drop: 6 - 3 = 3 balls

6. **Final Count**: Since 2 of the dropped balls were caught and 1 was lost, we need to consider only the balls that Josh still has:
   - He has 3 balls left after the drop.

Thus, when Josh starts juggling on stage, he is juggling with **3 balls**.

**Final Answer**: 3 balls.
