==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to determine how many pieces of 20-foot rope Tom needs to buy in order to lower a rope down 6 stories, given that one story is 10 feet tall. We also need to account for the loss of length when lashing the ropes together.

### Step 1: Calculate the total height Tom needs to lower the rope.

Since one story is 10 feet and Tom needs to lower the rope down 6 stories, we can calculate the total height as follows:

\[
\text{Total height} = \text{Number of stories} \times \text{Height per story} = 6 \times 10 \text{ feet} = 60 \text{ feet}
\]

### Step 2: Determine the effective length of rope when lashing together.

Each piece of rope is 20 feet long, but when lashing them together, Tom loses 25% of the total length. First, we need to calculate how much length is lost when two pieces of rope are lashed together.

The loss when lashing two pieces together is calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Length loss} = 25\% \text{ of } (20 \text{ feet} + 20 \text{ feet}) = 0.25 \times 40 \text{ feet} = 10 \text{ feet}
\]

Thus, the effective length of two lashed pieces of rope is:

\[
\text{Effective length} = (20 \text{ feet} + 20 \text{ feet}) - \text{Length loss} = 40 \text{ feet} - 10 \text{ feet} = 30 \text{ feet}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate how many pieces of rope are needed.

Now, we need to find out how many pieces of 20-foot rope are required to reach the total height of 60 feet. We can denote the number of pieces of rope needed as \( n \).

When \( n \) pieces of rope are lashed together, the effective length can be calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Effective length of } n \text{ pieces} = n \times 20 \text{ feet} - \text{Length loss}
\]

The length loss when \( n \) pieces are lashed together is:

\[
\text{Length loss} = 25\% \text{ of } (n \times 20 \text{ feet}) = 0.25 \times (n \times 20 \text{ feet}) = 5n \text{ feet}
\]

Thus, the effective length becomes:

\[
\text{Effective length} = n \times 20 \text{ feet} - 5n \text{ feet} = 15n \text{ feet}
\]

We need this effective length to be at least 60 feet:

\[
15n \geq 60
\]

### Step 4: Solve for \( n \).

To find \( n \), we divide both sides of the inequality by 15:

\[
n \geq \frac{60}{15} = 4
\]

### Conclusion

Tom needs to buy at least 4 pieces of 20-foot rope to ensure that he can lower the rope down 6 stories effectively. 

Thus, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{4}
\]
