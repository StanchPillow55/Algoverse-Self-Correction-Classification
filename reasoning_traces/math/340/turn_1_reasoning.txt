Question ID: 340
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to follow Josh's juggling practice and the events that occur during the talent show step by step.

1. **Initial Practice**: 
   - Josh starts practicing with 3 balls.

2. **Weekly Progression**:
   - Each week, Josh adds 1 ball to his juggling routine.
   - Let's calculate how many balls he is juggling at the end of each week:
     - **Week 1**: 3 balls (initial)
     - **Week 2**: 3 + 1 = 4 balls
     - **Week 3**: 4 + 1 = 5 balls
     - **Week 4**: 5 + 1 = 6 balls

   After 4 weeks of practice, Josh is able to juggle **6 balls**.

3. **Event at the Talent Show**:
   - When Josh walks on stage, he slips and drops 3 of his balls.
   - Out of the 3 balls he drops:
     - 2 balls are caught by people in the crowd.
     - 1 ball is lost completely.

4. **Calculating Remaining Balls**:
   - Initially, Josh had 6 balls.
   - He drops 3 balls, so we subtract these from the total:
     \[
     6 - 3 = 3 \text{ balls remaining}
     \]
   - Since 2 of the dropped balls are caught, they are no longer with him, leaving him with:
     \[
     3 \text{ balls remaining} - 2 \text{ caught} = 1 \text{ ball remaining}
     \]
   - The 1 ball that is lost is not counted in his remaining balls.

5. **Final Count**:
   - Therefore, when Josh starts to juggle on stage, he has **1 ball** left.

In conclusion, after considering all the events and calculations, Josh starts to juggle on stage with **1 ball**.

**Final Answer**: 1 ball
