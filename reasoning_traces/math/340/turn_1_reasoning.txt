Question ID: 340
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine how many 20-foot pieces of rope Tom needs to buy to cover the total distance of 60 feet (6 stories, with each story being 10 feet).

### Step 1: Determine the Total Length of Rope Needed
Tom needs to lower a rope down 6 stories, and each story is 10 feet. Therefore, the total length of rope needed is:
\[ 6 \text{ stories} \times 10 \text{ feet/story} = 60 \text{ feet} \]

### Step 2: Calculate the Effective Length of Each 20-foot Rope
When two pieces of rope are lashed together, 25% of the rope is lost. Therefore, the effective length of each 20-foot rope after lashing is:
\[ 20 \text{ feet} \times (1 - 0.25) = 20 \text{ feet} \times 0.75 = 15 \text{ feet} \]

### Step 3: Determine How Many 15-foot Effective Lengths are Needed
To cover 60 feet with ropes that effectively provide 15 feet each, we calculate:
\[ \frac{60 \text{ feet}}{15 \text{ feet/piece}} = 4 \text{ pieces} \]

### Step 4: Verify the Calculation
Each 20-foot rope effectively provides 15 feet after lashing. If Tom buys 4 pieces, the total effective length is:
\[ 4 \text{ pieces} \times 15 \text{ feet/piece} = 60 \text{ feet} \]

This matches the total length needed, confirming that 4 pieces are sufficient.

### Conclusion
Tom needs to buy 4 pieces of 20-foot rope to cover the 60-foot distance after accounting for the 25% loss due to lashing.

**Final Answer: Tom needs to buy 4 pieces of rope.**
