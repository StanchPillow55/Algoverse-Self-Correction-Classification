Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To determine how many pieces of rope Tom needs to buy, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total height Tom needs to lower the rope**:
   - Each story is 10 feet.
   - Tom needs to lower the rope down 6 stories.
   \[
   \text{Total height} = 6 \text{ stories} \times 10 \text{ feet/story} = 60 \text{ feet}
   \]

2. **Determine the effective length of each piece of rope after lashing**:
   - Each piece of rope is 20 feet long.
   - When lashing two pieces together, 25% of the total length is lost.
   - First, calculate the length lost when lashing two pieces together:
   \[
   \text{Length lost} = 25\% \text{ of } (20 \text{ feet} + 20 \text{ feet}) = 0.25 \times 40 \text{ feet} = 10 \text{ feet}
   \]
   - Now, calculate the effective length after lashing:
   \[
   \text{Effective length} = 40 \text{ feet} - 10 \text{ feet} = 30 \text{ feet}
   \]

3. **Calculate how many pieces of rope are needed**:
   - Each piece of rope is 20 feet long, and two pieces together provide an effective length of 30 feet.
   - To find out how many effective lengths are needed to cover 60 feet:
   \[
   \text{Number of effective lengths needed} = \frac{60 \text{ feet}}{30 \text{ feet}} = 2
   \]
   - Since each effective length requires 2 pieces of rope, the total number of pieces of rope needed is:
   \[
   \text{Total pieces of rope} = 2 \text{ effective lengths} \times 2 \text{ pieces/length} = 4 \text{ pieces}
   \]

Thus, Tom needs to buy **4 pieces of rope**. 

Final answer: **4 pieces of rope**.
