==================================================

To solve the problem, we first need to understand what "Sample math problem 435" refers to. Since there is no specific problem statement provided, I'll create a hypothetical math problem with the number 435 and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**
Find the sum of the digits of the number 435 and determine if the sum is a prime number.

**Step-by-step Solution:**

1. **Identify the digits of the number 435:**
   - The number 435 consists of the digits 4, 3, and 5.

2. **Calculate the sum of the digits:**
   - Sum = 4 + 3 + 5

3. **Perform the addition:**
   - 4 + 3 = 7
   - 7 + 5 = 12

   Therefore, the sum of the digits is 12.

4. **Determine if the sum (12) is a prime number:**
   - A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.
   - Check the divisibility of 12:
     - 12 is divisible by 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 12.
     - Since 12 has divisors other than 1 and itself, it is not a prime number.

**Conclusion:**
The sum of the digits of the number 435 is 12, and 12 is not a prime number.

**Final Answer:**
The sum of the digits of 435 is 12, and it is not a prime number.
