Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample math problem 435" refers to. Since there is no specific problem statement provided, I'll create a hypothetical math problem labeled as "Sample math problem 435" and solve it step by step.

**Sample Math Problem 435:**

"Calculate the sum of the first 20 positive even numbers."

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Identify the Sequence:**
   - The sequence of the first 20 positive even numbers is: 2, 4, 6, 8, ..., 40.

2. **Recognize the Pattern:**
   - This sequence is an arithmetic sequence where the first term \( a_1 = 2 \) and the common difference \( d = 2 \).

3. **Use the Formula for the Sum of an Arithmetic Sequence:**
   - The formula for the sum \( S_n \) of the first \( n \) terms of an arithmetic sequence is:
     \[
     S_n = \frac{n}{2} \times (a_1 + a_n)
     \]
   - Here, \( n = 20 \), \( a_1 = 2 \), and \( a_n = 40 \) (since the 20th even number is 40).

4. **Calculate the Sum:**
   - Substitute the known values into the formula:
     \[
     S_{20} = \frac{20}{2} \times (2 + 40)
     \]
   - Simplify the expression:
     \[
     S_{20} = 10 \times 42
     \]
     \[
     S_{20} = 420
     \]

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The sum of the first 20 positive even numbers is 420.

**Final Answer:**

The sum of the first 20 positive even numbers is 420.
