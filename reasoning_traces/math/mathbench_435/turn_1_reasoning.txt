==================================================

To solve the sample math problem 435, we need to first understand what the problem is asking. Since the problem statement is not fully provided, let's assume a hypothetical math problem labeled as "435" and solve it step by step. 

Let's assume the problem is as follows:

**Problem 435:**
Solve for \( x \) in the equation: 
\[ 3x + 5 = 20 \]

**Step-by-step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Equation:**
   The equation given is a simple linear equation in one variable, \( x \). Our goal is to isolate \( x \) on one side of the equation to find its value.

2. **Isolate the Variable:**
   To isolate \( x \), we need to perform operations that will leave \( x \) alone on one side of the equation.

   - Start with the equation:
     \[ 3x + 5 = 20 \]

   - Subtract 5 from both sides to eliminate the constant term on the left side:
     \[ 3x + 5 - 5 = 20 - 5 \]
     \[ 3x = 15 \]

3. **Solve for \( x \):**
   Now, we need to solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides of the equation by 3, which is the coefficient of \( x \).

   - Divide both sides by 3:
     \[ \frac{3x}{3} = \frac{15}{3} \]
     \[ x = 5 \]

4. **Verify the Solution:**
   It's always a good practice to verify the solution by substituting the value of \( x \) back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies the equation.

   - Substitute \( x = 5 \) back into the original equation:
     \[ 3(5) + 5 = 20 \]
     \[ 15 + 5 = 20 \]
     \[ 20 = 20 \]

   The left side equals the right side, confirming that our solution is correct.

**Final Answer:**
The solution to the equation \( 3x + 5 = 20 \) is \( x = 5 \).
