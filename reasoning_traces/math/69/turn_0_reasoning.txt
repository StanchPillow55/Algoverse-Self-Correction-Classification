==================================================

First, let's calculate the total number of arms for the starfish Carly collected. Since each starfish has 5 arms and Carly collected 7 starfish, we multiply 5 by 7 to get the total number of arms for the starfish. 

5 arms/starfish * 7 starfish = 35 arms

Next, we add the number of arms from the seastar Carly collected. The seastar has 14 arms. 

35 arms (from starfish) + 14 arms (from seastar) = 49 arms

So, the total number of arms from the animals Carly collected is 49.
