To find the total number of arms that Carly collected from the starfish and the seastar, we can break the problem down into two parts: calculating the total arms from the starfish and then adding the arms from the seastar.

1. **Calculate the total arms from the starfish:**
   - Carly collected 7 starfish.
   - Each starfish has 5 arms.
   - To find the total number of arms from the starfish, we multiply the number of starfish by the number of arms each starfish has:

   \[
   \text{Total arms from starfish} = \text{Number of starfish} \times \text{Arms per starfish}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total arms from starfish} = 7 \times 5 = 35
   \]

2. **Calculate the total arms from the seastar:**
   - Carly collected 1 seastar.
   - The seastar has 14 arms.
   - The total number of arms from the seastar is simply the number of arms it has:

   \[
   \text{Total arms from seastar} = 14
   \]

3. **Add the total arms from the starfish and the seastar:**
   - Now we add the total arms from the starfish and the seastar to find the overall total:

   \[
   \text{Total arms} = \text{Total arms from starfish} + \text{Total arms from seastar}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total arms} = 35 + 14 = 49
   \]

Thus, the total number of arms that the animals Carly collected have in total is:

\[
\boxed{49}
\]
