Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of arms from the starfish and the seastar that Carly collected. Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Calculate the total number of arms from the starfish:**
   - Carly collected 7 starfish.
   - Each starfish has 5 arms.
   - To find the total number of arms from the starfish, we multiply the number of starfish by the number of arms each starfish has:
     \[
     7 \text{ starfish} \times 5 \text{ arms/starfish} = 35 \text{ arms}
     \]

2. **Calculate the number of arms from the seastar:**
   - Carly collected 1 seastar.
   - The seastar has 14 arms.
   - Since there is only one seastar, the total number of arms from the seastar is simply 14.

3. **Calculate the total number of arms from all the animals:**
   - We add the total number of arms from the starfish to the total number of arms from the seastar:
     \[
     35 \text{ arms (from starfish)} + 14 \text{ arms (from seastar)} = 49 \text{ arms}
     \]

Therefore, the total number of arms from all the animals Carly collected is 49.

**Final Answer: 49 arms**
