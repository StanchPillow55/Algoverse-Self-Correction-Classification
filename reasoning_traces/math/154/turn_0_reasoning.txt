To solve the problem, we need to determine how much money Ariella has in her son's savings account after two years, given that she has $200 more than Daniella, and that her account earns simple interest at a rate of 10% per annum.

### Step 1: Determine Daniella's Savings
Daniella has $400 in her son's savings account.

### Step 2: Calculate Ariella's Savings
Since Ariella has $200 more than Daniella, we can calculate the amount in Ariella's account as follows:

\[
\text{Ariella's Savings} = \text{Daniella's Savings} + 200
\]
\[
\text{Ariella's Savings} = 400 + 200 = 600
\]

### Step 3: Calculate Simple Interest for Ariella's Account
Ariella's account earns simple interest at a rate of 10% per annum. The formula for calculating simple interest is:

\[
\text{Simple Interest} = P \times r \times t
\]

Where:
- \( P \) is the principal amount (initial amount of money),
- \( r \) is the rate of interest (as a decimal),
- \( t \) is the time in years.

In this case:
- \( P = 600 \) (Ariella's initial savings),
- \( r = 0.10 \) (10% as a decimal),
- \( t = 2 \) (the time period in years).

Now we can calculate the simple interest:

\[
\text{Simple Interest} = 600 \times 0.10 \times 2
\]
\[
\text{Simple Interest} = 600 \times 0.10 = 60
\]
\[
\text{Simple Interest} = 60 \times 2 = 120
\]

### Step 4: Calculate Total Amount in Ariella's Account After 2 Years
To find the total amount in Ariella's account after 2 years, we add the simple interest to the principal amount:

\[
\text{Total Amount} = P + \text{Simple Interest}
\]
\[
\text{Total Amount} = 600 + 120 = 720
\]

### Final Answer
After two years, Ariella will have **$720** in her son's savings account.
