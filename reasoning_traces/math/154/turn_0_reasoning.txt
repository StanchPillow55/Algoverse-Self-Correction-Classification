To find out how many hours Kimo spends attending classes in one semester, we need to break down his schedule and calculate the total hours for each type of day he attends classes.

### Step 1: Calculate hours for Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays

Kimo has three 1-hour classes on each of these days. 

- **Number of classes per day**: 3
- **Duration of each class**: 1 hour
- **Total hours per day**: 
  \[
  3 \text{ classes} \times 1 \text{ hour/class} = 3 \text{ hours}
  \]

Kimo attends classes on these days three times a week (Monday, Wednesday, and Friday).

- **Total hours per week for these days**:
  \[
  3 \text{ hours/day} \times 3 \text{ days/week} = 9 \text{ hours/week}
  \]

### Step 2: Calculate hours for Tuesdays and Thursdays

On Tuesdays and Thursdays, Kimo has two 2-hour classes each day.

- **Number of classes per day**: 2
- **Duration of each class**: 2 hours
- **Total hours per day**:
  \[
  2 \text{ classes} \times 2 \text{ hours/class} = 4 \text{ hours}
  \]

Kimo attends classes on these days two times a week (Tuesday and Thursday).

- **Total hours per week for these days**:
  \[
  4 \text{ hours/day} \times 2 \text{ days/week} = 8 \text{ hours/week}
  \]

### Step 3: Calculate total hours per week

Now we can find the total hours Kimo spends in classes each week by adding the hours from both types of days:

- **Total hours per week**:
  \[
  9 \text{ hours/week (Mon, Wed, Fri)} + 8 \text{ hours/week (Tue, Thu)} = 17 \text{ hours/week}
  \]

### Step 4: Calculate total hours for the semester

The semester lasts for 16 weeks. To find the total hours Kimo spends in classes during the semester, we multiply the total hours per week by the number of weeks:

- **Total hours for the semester**:
  \[
  17 \text{ hours/week} \times 16 \text{ weeks} = 272 \text{ hours}
  \]

### Final Answer

Kimo spends a total of **272 hours** attending classes in one semester.
