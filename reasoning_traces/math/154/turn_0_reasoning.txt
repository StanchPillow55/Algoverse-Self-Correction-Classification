==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine how much money Ariella has in her son's savings account, and then calculate the amount she will have after two years, given that the account earns simple interest at a rate of 10% per annum.

### Step 1: Determine Ariella's Initial Amount

1. **Daniella's Initial Amount:**
   - Daniella has $400 in her son's savings account.

2. **Ariella's Initial Amount:**
   - Ariella has $200 more than Daniella.
   - Therefore, Ariella's initial amount is:
     \[
     400 + 200 = 600
     \]
   - Ariella has $600 in her son's savings account initially.

### Step 2: Calculate Simple Interest for Two Years

Simple interest is calculated using the formula:
\[
I = P \times r \times t
\]
where:
- \( I \) is the interest earned,
- \( P \) is the principal amount (initial amount),
- \( r \) is the annual interest rate (as a decimal),
- \( t \) is the time in years.

3. **Substitute the Known Values:**
   - \( P = 600 \) (Ariella's initial amount),
   - \( r = 0.10 \) (10% interest rate as a decimal),
   - \( t = 2 \) (time in years).

4. **Calculate the Interest:**
   \[
   I = 600 \times 0.10 \times 2 = 600 \times 0.20 = 120
   \]
   - The interest earned over two years is $120.

### Step 3: Calculate the Total Amount After Two Years

5. **Total Amount After Two Years:**
   - The total amount in Ariella's account after two years is the sum of the initial amount and the interest earned:
   \[
   \text{Total Amount} = P + I = 600 + 120 = 720
   \]

### Final Answer

After two years, Ariella will have $720 in her son's savings account.
