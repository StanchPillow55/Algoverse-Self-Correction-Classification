==================================================

To find out how many hours Kimo spends attending classes in one semester, we will break down his schedule by day and then calculate the total hours for the entire semester.

### Step 1: Calculate weekly class hours

**Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays:**
- Kimo has 3 classes each day.
- Each class is 1 hour long.
- Total hours for one day (Monday, Wednesday, or Friday):
  \[
  3 \text{ classes} \times 1 \text{ hour/class} = 3 \text{ hours}
  \]
- Total hours for three days (Monday, Wednesday, and Friday):
  \[
  3 \text{ hours/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 9 \text{ hours}
  \]

**Tuesdays and Thursdays:**
- Kimo has 2 classes each day.
- Each class is 2 hours long.
- Total hours for one day (Tuesday or Thursday):
  \[
  2 \text{ classes} \times 2 \text{ hours/class} = 4 \text{ hours}
  \]
- Total hours for two days (Tuesday and Thursday):
  \[
  4 \text{ hours/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 8 \text{ hours}
  \]

### Step 2: Calculate total weekly hours

Now, we add the total hours from both parts of the week:
\[
9 \text{ hours (Mon, Wed, Fri)} + 8 \text{ hours (Tue, Thu)} = 17 \text{ hours/week}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate total hours for the semester

The semester lasts for 16 weeks. Therefore, the total hours Kimo spends attending classes in one semester is:
\[
17 \text{ hours/week} \times 16 \text{ weeks} = 272 \text{ hours}
\]

### Final Answer
Kimo spends a total of **272 hours** attending classes in one semester.
