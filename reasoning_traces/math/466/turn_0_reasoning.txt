To solve the problem, we need to determine how many sick days and vacation days Mark has left after using half of his allotment for the year. 

1. **Determine the total number of sick and vacation days:**
   - Each employee gets 10 sick days and 10 vacation days per year.
   - Therefore, Mark has:
     - Sick days: 10
     - Vacation days: 10

2. **Calculate how many days Mark uses:**
   - Mark uses half of his sick days:
     \[
     \text{Sick days used} = \frac{10}{2} = 5 \text{ sick days}
     \]
   - Mark uses half of his vacation days:
     \[
     \text{Vacation days used} = \frac{10}{2} = 5 \text{ vacation days}
     \]

3. **Determine how many days Mark has left:**
   - Sick days left:
     \[
     \text{Sick days left} = 10 - 5 = 5 \text{ sick days}
     \]
   - Vacation days left:
     \[
     \text{Vacation days left} = 10 - 5 = 5 \text{ vacation days}
     \]

4. **Calculate the total number of days left:**
   - Total days left (sick + vacation):
     \[
     \text{Total days left} = 5 \text{ sick days} + 5 \text{ vacation days} = 10 \text{ days}
     \]

5. **Convert the total days left into hours:**
   - Each day covers an 8-hour workday, so:
     \[
     \text{Total hours left} = 10 \text{ days} \times 8 \text{ hours/day} = 80 \text{ hours}
     \]

Thus, after using half of his sick and vacation days, Mark has a total of 80 hours' worth of days left.

**Final Answer: 80 hours**
