To determine how much more Kelly paid than Becky, we will calculate the total cost for each person and then find the difference.

### Step 1: Calculate Becky's total cost

1. **Cost per apple for Becky**: 45 cents
2. **Number of apples Becky bought**: 20
3. **Total cost before discount**:
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = \text{Cost per apple} \times \text{Number of apples} = 0.45 \times 20 = 9.00 \text{ dollars}
   \]
4. **Discount received by Becky**: $1
5. **Total cost after discount**:
   \[
   \text{Total cost after discount} = \text{Total cost} - \text{Discount} = 9.00 - 1.00 = 8.00 \text{ dollars}
   \]

### Step 2: Calculate Kelly's total cost

1. **Cost per apple for Kelly**: 50 cents
2. **Number of apples Kelly bought**: 20
3. **Total cost before discount**:
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = \text{Cost per apple} \times \text{Number of apples} = 0.50 \times 20 = 10.00 \text{ dollars}
   \]
4. **Discount percentage for Kelly**: 10%
5. **Amount of discount**:
   \[
   \text{Discount amount} = \text{Total cost} \times \left(\frac{\text{Discount percentage}}{100}\right) = 10.00 \times 0.10 = 1.00 \text{ dollars}
   \]
6. **Total cost after discount**:
   \[
   \text{Total cost after discount} = \text{Total cost} - \text{Discount amount} = 10.00 - 1.00 = 9.00 \text{ dollars}
   \]

### Step 3: Calculate the difference in total costs

Now we will find out how much more Kelly paid than Becky:
\[
\text{Difference} = \text{Kelly's total cost} - \text{Becky's total cost} = 9.00 - 8.00 = 1.00 \text{ dollar}
\]

### Final Answer
Kelly paid **$1.00** more than Becky.
