To solve this problem, we need to determine how many hours' worth of sick and vacation days Mark has left after using half of his allotment for each type of day.

1. **Determine the total number of sick and vacation days Mark has per year:**
   - Sick days: 10 days
   - Vacation days: 10 days

2. **Calculate how many days Mark uses:**
   - Since Mark uses half of his sick days, he uses:
     \[
     \frac{1}{2} \times 10 = 5 \text{ sick days}
     \]
   - Since Mark uses half of his vacation days, he uses:
     \[
     \frac{1}{2} \times 10 = 5 \text{ vacation days}
     \]

3. **Calculate how many days Mark has left:**
   - Sick days remaining:
     \[
     10 - 5 = 5 \text{ sick days remaining}
     \]
   - Vacation days remaining:
     \[
     10 - 5 = 5 \text{ vacation days remaining}
     \]

4. **Calculate the total number of days Mark has left:**
   - Total days remaining:
     \[
     5 \text{ sick days} + 5 \text{ vacation days} = 10 \text{ days remaining}
     \]

5. **Convert the remaining days into hours:**
   - Each day is an 8-hour workday, so the total hours remaining is:
     \[
     10 \text{ days} \times 8 \text{ hours/day} = 80 \text{ hours}
     \]

Therefore, Mark has 80 hours' worth of sick and vacation days left.

**Final Answer:**
Mark has 80 hours' worth of days left.
