==================================================

To solve a problem effectively, it's important to understand the question and break it down into manageable steps. However, the question you've provided, "Sample reasoning question 471," lacks specific details or context. Therefore, I'll create a hypothetical math problem and demonstrate how to solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**

A farmer has a rectangular field with a length that is 20 meters longer than its width. The area of the field is 1120 square meters. What are the dimensions of the field?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( w \) be the width of the field in meters.
   - Then the length of the field is \( w + 20 \) meters.

2. **Write the Equation for Area:**
   - The area of a rectangle is given by the formula:
     \[
     \text{Area} = \text{Length} \times \text{Width}
     \]
   - Substituting the known values, we have:
     \[
     1120 = (w + 20) \times w
     \]

3. **Expand and Simplify the Equation:**
   - Expand the right side of the equation:
     \[
     1120 = w^2 + 20w
     \]

4. **Rearrange the Equation:**
   - Move all terms to one side to form a quadratic equation:
     \[
     w^2 + 20w - 1120 = 0
     \]

5. **Solve the Quadratic Equation:**
   - To solve the quadratic equation, we can use the quadratic formula:
     \[
     w = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
     \]
   - Here, \( a = 1 \), \( b = 20 \), and \( c = -1120 \).

6. **Calculate the Discriminant:**
   - The discriminant (\( b^2 - 4ac \)) is:
     \[
     20^2 - 4 \times 1 \times (-1120) = 400 + 4480 = 4880
     \]

7. **Find the Roots:**
   - Substitute the values into the quadratic formula:
     \[
     w = \frac{-20 \pm \sqrt{4880}}{2}
     \]
   - Calculate \( \sqrt{4880} \). Approximating, we find:
     \[
     \sqrt{4880} \approx 69.83
     \]
   - Therefore, the roots are:
     \[
     w = \frac{-20 + 69.83}{2} \quad \text{or} \quad w = \frac{-20 - 69.83}{2}
     \]
   - Simplifying, we get:
     \[
     w \approx \frac{49.83}{2} = 24.915 \quad \text{or} \quad w \approx \frac{-89.83}{2} = -44.915
     \]

8. **Select the Valid Solution:**
   - Since width cannot be negative, we choose \( w \approx 24.915 \).

9. **Calculate the Length:**
   - The length is \( w + 20 \):
     \[
     \text{Length} \approx 24.915 + 20 = 44.915
     \]

10. **Conclusion:**
    - The dimensions of the field are approximately 24.915 meters by 44.915 meters.

**Final Answer:**
The width of the field is approximately 24.915 meters, and the length is approximately 44.915 meters.
