==================================================

To solve a problem effectively, it's crucial to understand the problem statement and identify what is being asked. However, the question you've provided, "Sample reasoning question 471," lacks specific details or context. Therefore, I'll guide you through a generic approach to solving a reasoning problem, which you can apply to various types of reasoning questions.

### Step-by-Step Approach to Solving a Reasoning Problem

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - Carefully read the problem statement.
   - Identify the key information given.
   - Determine what is being asked.

2. **Identify the Type of Reasoning:**
   - Is it a logical reasoning problem, mathematical reasoning, or another type?
   - Common types include pattern recognition, sequence solving, logical deduction, etc.

3. **Gather Information:**
   - List out all the known variables and information.
   - Note any constraints or conditions provided in the problem.

4. **Develop a Strategy:**
   - Based on the type of problem, decide on a method to solve it.
   - For logical reasoning, consider using diagrams or tables.
   - For mathematical reasoning, set up equations or inequalities.

5. **Execute the Plan:**
   - Carry out the calculations or logical steps needed.
   - Ensure each step follows logically from the previous one.
   - Double-check calculations for accuracy.

6. **Review and Conclude:**
   - Review each step to ensure no information was overlooked.
   - Ensure the solution answers the question posed.
   - If applicable, verify the solution by substituting it back into the original problem.

7. **State the Final Answer:**
   - Clearly state the final answer, ensuring it is in the correct format.

### Example Application

Since the problem "Sample reasoning question 471" is not specific, let's consider a generic example:

**Example Problem:**
"Find the next number in the sequence: 2, 4, 8, 16, ..."

**Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We are given a sequence of numbers and need to find the next number.

2. **Identify the Type of Reasoning:**
   - This is a pattern recognition problem involving a sequence.

3. **Gather Information:**
   - The sequence is: 2, 4, 8, 16.

4. **Develop a Strategy:**
   - Look for a pattern in the sequence.
   - Notice that each number is double the previous number.

5. **Execute the Plan:**
   - The pattern is: \(2 \times 2 = 4\), \(4 \times 2 = 8\), \(8 \times 2 = 16\).
   - Therefore, the next number should be \(16 \times 2 = 32\).

6. **Review and Conclude:**
   - The pattern of multiplying by 2 holds for the entire sequence.
   - The next number, 32, fits this pattern.

7. **State the Final Answer:**
   - The next number in the sequence is 32.

This structured approach can be adapted to various reasoning problems, ensuring a thorough and logical solution process. If you have a specific reasoning problem in mind, please provide more details, and I can tailor the solution to that problem.
