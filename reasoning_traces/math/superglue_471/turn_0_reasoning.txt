To solve the problem, I need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 471" refers to. Since this is not a standard math problem or a commonly known problem, I'll need more context or details to provide a specific solution. However, I can guide you through a general approach to solving math problems using logical reasoning and step-by-step calculations.

Let's assume "Sample reasoning question 471" is a placeholder for a typical math problem. I'll create a sample problem and solve it to demonstrate the process:

**Sample Problem:**
A farmer has a rectangular field that is 100 meters long and 60 meters wide. He wants to build a fence around the field and also divide the field into two equal parts with a fence parallel to the shorter side. Calculate the total length of the fence required.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - The field is rectangular with dimensions 100 meters (length) and 60 meters (width).
   - We need to calculate the total length of the fence required to enclose the field and divide it into two equal parts.

2. **Calculate the Perimeter of the Field:**
   - The perimeter of a rectangle is given by the formula: 
     \[
     P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width})
     \]
   - Substitute the given dimensions:
     \[
     P = 2 \times (100 + 60) = 2 \times 160 = 320 \text{ meters}
     \]
   - This is the length of the fence required to enclose the field.

3. **Calculate the Length of the Dividing Fence:**
   - The field is divided into two equal parts with a fence parallel to the shorter side (width).
   - The dividing fence will be along the length of the field, which is 100 meters.

4. **Calculate the Total Length of the Fence:**
   - Total length of the fence required is the sum of the perimeter and the dividing fence:
     \[
     \text{Total fence length} = \text{Perimeter} + \text{Dividing fence length}
     \]
   - Substitute the calculated values:
     \[
     \text{Total fence length} = 320 + 100 = 420 \text{ meters}
     \]

5. **Final Answer:**
   - The total length of the fence required is 420 meters.

In this example, I demonstrated how to break down a problem into smaller parts, perform calculations, and arrive at a final answer. If you have a specific problem or more details about "Sample reasoning question 471," please provide them, and I can offer a more tailored solution.
