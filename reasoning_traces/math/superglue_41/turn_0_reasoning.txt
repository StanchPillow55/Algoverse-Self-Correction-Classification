### General Problem-Solving Strategy

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - Read the problem carefully.
   - Identify what is being asked.
   - Determine what information is given and what needs to be found.

2. **Devise a Plan:**
   - Consider possible strategies to solve the problem (e.g., drawing a diagram, creating an equation, using a formula, etc.).
   - Choose the strategy that seems most appropriate for the problem.

3. **Carry Out the Plan:**
   - Execute the chosen strategy step by step.
   - Perform calculations carefully and check each step for accuracy.
   - Keep track of units and ensure consistency.

4. **Review/Check Your Work:**
   - Verify that the solution makes sense in the context of the problem.
   - Check calculations for errors.
   - Ensure that the final answer addresses the question asked.

5. **State the Final Answer:**
   - Clearly present the final answer, including units if applicable.

### Example Problem and Solution

Let's consider a simple example:

**Problem:**
A rectangle has a length of 10 units and a width of 5 units. What is the area of the rectangle?

**Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We need to find the area of a rectangle.
   - The formula for the area of a rectangle is: Area = Length Ã— Width.

2. **Devise a Plan:**
   - Use the formula for the area of a rectangle.

3. **Carry Out the Plan:**
   - Substitute the given values into the formula:
     \[
     \text{Area} = 10 \, \text{units} \times 5 \, \text{units} = 50 \, \text{square units}
     \]

4. **Review/Check Your Work:**
   - The calculation is straightforward, and the units are consistent.
   - The area of a rectangle with the given dimensions should indeed be 50 square units.

5. **State the Final Answer:**
   - The area of the rectangle is 50 square units.
