To solve the problem effectively, I need more specific information or details about "Sample reasoning question 41." Since the question is not provided, I'll demonstrate how to approach a generic math problem by showing all steps and reasoning.

Let's consider a sample math problem:

**Problem:**
A rectangle has a length that is twice its width. If the perimeter of the rectangle is 36 units, what are the dimensions of the rectangle?

**Solution:**

1. **Understand the problem:**
   - We need to find the dimensions (length and width) of a rectangle.
   - We know the perimeter of the rectangle is 36 units.
   - The length is twice the width.

2. **Define variables:**
   - Let \( w \) be the width of the rectangle.
   - Then the length \( l \) is \( 2w \).

3. **Use the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle:**
   - The perimeter \( P \) of a rectangle is given by the formula:
     \[
     P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width})
     \]
   - Substitute the known values into the formula:
     \[
     36 = 2 \times (2w + w)
     \]

4. **Simplify and solve the equation:**
   - Simplify inside the parentheses:
     \[
     36 = 2 \times (3w)
     \]
   - Simplify further:
     \[
     36 = 6w
     \]
   - Solve for \( w \) by dividing both sides by 6:
     \[
     w = \frac{36}{6} = 6
     \]

5. **Find the length:**
   - Since the length \( l \) is twice the width:
     \[
     l = 2w = 2 \times 6 = 12
     \]

6. **Verify the solution:**
   - Check if the perimeter is indeed 36 units with these dimensions:
     \[
     P = 2 \times (l + w) = 2 \times (12 + 6) = 2 \times 18 = 36
     \]
   - The calculations confirm the perimeter is correct.

7. **State the final answer:**
   - The dimensions of the rectangle are: width = 6 units, length = 12 units.

This is how you would approach solving a math problem step by step, showing all calculations and reasoning. If you have a specific problem or question in mind, please provide the details, and I can work through that problem specifically.
