Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, I need more information about "Sample reasoning question 41" as it is not provided in your request. However, I can guide you on how to approach a typical math problem by explaining a general process.

Let's assume we have a sample math problem:

**Problem:** Calculate the area of a rectangle with a length of 8 units and a width of 5 units.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We need to find the area of a rectangle.
   - The formula for the area of a rectangle is: 
     \[
     \text{Area} = \text{Length} \times \text{Width}
     \]

2. **Identify the Given Information:**
   - Length (\(L\)) = 8 units
   - Width (\(W\)) = 5 units

3. **Substitute the Values into the Formula:**
   - Plug the given values into the area formula:
     \[
     \text{Area} = 8 \times 5
     \]

4. **Perform the Calculation:**
   - Multiply the length by the width:
     \[
     \text{Area} = 40 \text{ square units}
     \]

5. **Verify the Solution:**
   - Double-check the multiplication to ensure accuracy.
   - Confirm that the units are consistent and correctly labeled as square units.

6. **State the Final Answer:**
   - The area of the rectangle is 40 square units.
