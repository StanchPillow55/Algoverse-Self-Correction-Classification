==================================================

To solve the problem effectively, I need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 41" entails. However, since I don't have access to external databases or specific documents, I will demonstrate a general approach to solving a reasoning-based math problem. If you have a specific problem in mind, please provide the details, and I will tailor my response accordingly.

Let's assume a hypothetical reasoning problem:

**Problem:**
A farmer has a certain number of chickens and cows. There are a total of 30 heads and 100 legs on the farm. How many chickens and how many cows does the farmer have?

**Step-by-step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We need to find the number of chickens and cows.
   - Chickens have 1 head and 2 legs.
   - Cows have 1 head and 4 legs.
   - Total heads = 30
   - Total legs = 100

2. **Set Up Equations:**
   - Let \( c \) be the number of chickens.
   - Let \( w \) be the number of cows.
   - From the problem, we have two equations:
     1. \( c + w = 30 \) (since each animal has one head)
     2. \( 2c + 4w = 100 \) (accounting for the legs)

3. **Solve the System of Equations:**
   - From equation 1: \( c + w = 30 \)
     \[
     c = 30 - w
     \]
   - Substitute \( c = 30 - w \) into equation 2:
     \[
     2(30 - w) + 4w = 100
     \]
     \[
     60 - 2w + 4w = 100
     \]
     \[
     2w = 40
     \]
     \[
     w = 20
     \]
   - Substitute \( w = 20 \) back into \( c = 30 - w \):
     \[
     c = 30 - 20 = 10
     \]

4. **Verify the Solution:**
   - Check the number of heads: \( c + w = 10 + 20 = 30 \) (correct)
   - Check the number of legs: \( 2c + 4w = 2(10) + 4(20) = 20 + 80 = 100 \) (correct)

5. **State the Final Answer:**
   - The farmer has 10 chickens and 20 cows.

This approach demonstrates how to systematically solve a reasoning-based math problem by setting up equations based on the given conditions, solving the system of equations, and verifying the solution. If you have a specific problem in mind, please provide the details for a tailored solution.
