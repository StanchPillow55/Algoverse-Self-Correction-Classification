==================================================

To solve the problem effectively, I need to understand the context and details of "Sample reasoning question 41." However, since the question itself is not provided, I'll demonstrate how to approach a typical math problem by outlining a general problem-solving strategy. If you have a specific question, please provide the details, and I'll be happy to assist with that.

Here's a general approach to solving a math problem:

### Step 1: Understand the Problem
- **Read the Problem Carefully**: Ensure you understand what is being asked. Identify the key information and what the problem is asking you to find.
- **Identify Known and Unknown Variables**: Determine what information is given and what you need to find.

### Step 2: Devise a Plan
- **Choose a Strategy**: Decide on the best method to solve the problem. This could involve algebraic manipulation, drawing a diagram, creating a table, or using a formula.
- **Consider Similar Problems**: Think about similar problems you have solved before and how they might inform your approach.

### Step 3: Carry Out the Plan
- **Execute Your Strategy**: Carefully perform the calculations or logical steps you have planned.
- **Show All Work**: Write down each step clearly to avoid mistakes and to make it easier to review your work.

### Step 4: Review and Check
- **Verify Your Solution**: Check your calculations and ensure your solution makes sense in the context of the problem.
- **Consider Alternative Methods**: Sometimes, solving the problem in a different way can confirm your solution or provide additional insights.

### Example Problem
Let's apply this strategy to a simple example problem:

**Problem**: Solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).

#### Step 1: Understand the Problem
- We need to find the value of \( x \) that satisfies the equation.

#### Step 2: Devise a Plan
- We can solve for \( x \) by isolating it on one side of the equation.

#### Step 3: Carry Out the Plan
1. Start with the equation:  
   \[
   2x + 3 = 11
   \]
2. Subtract 3 from both sides to isolate the term with \( x \):  
   \[
   2x = 11 - 3
   \]
   \[
   2x = 8
   \]
3. Divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( x \):  
   \[
   x = \frac{8}{2}
   \]
   \[
   x = 4
   \]

#### Step 4: Review and Check
- Substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation to verify:  
  \[
  2(4) + 3 = 8 + 3 = 11
  \]
- The left side equals the right side, confirming our solution is correct.

### Final Answer
The solution to the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \) is \( x = 4 \).
