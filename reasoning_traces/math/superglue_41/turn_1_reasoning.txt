==================================================

To solve the problem effectively, I need to first understand the context and details of "Sample reasoning question 41." However, since the specific content of this question is not provided, I'll demonstrate a general approach to solving a typical math reasoning problem. 

Let's assume a sample math reasoning problem:

**Problem:**
A farmer has a rectangular field that is 100 meters long and 60 meters wide. He wants to divide the field into two equal parts by building a fence parallel to the shorter side. How long will the fence be?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We have a rectangular field with dimensions 100 meters (length) and 60 meters (width).
   - The task is to divide the field into two equal parts using a fence parallel to the shorter side (width).

2. **Visualize the Problem:**
   - The field is a rectangle with the longer side as the length (100 meters) and the shorter side as the width (60 meters).
   - To divide the field into two equal parts, the fence should be parallel to the width (60 meters).

3. **Determine the Placement of the Fence:**
   - Since the fence is parallel to the width, it will run along the length of the field.
   - This means the fence will be placed along the 100-meter side.

4. **Calculate the Length of the Fence:**
   - Since the fence is parallel to the width and runs along the length, the length of the fence will be equal to the length of the field.
   - Therefore, the length of the fence is 100 meters.

5. **Verify the Solution:**
   - Dividing the field into two equal parts means each part will have an area of half the total area of the field.
   - Total area of the field = Length × Width = 100 meters × 60 meters = 6000 square meters.
   - Area of each part after division = 6000 square meters / 2 = 3000 square meters.
   - Each part will have dimensions 100 meters (length) × 30 meters (width), confirming that the fence divides the field equally.

**Final Answer:**
The length of the fence required to divide the field into two equal parts is 100 meters.
