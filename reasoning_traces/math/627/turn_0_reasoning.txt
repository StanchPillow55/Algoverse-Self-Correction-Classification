==================================================

To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step.

1. **Identify the number of days in the week**: 
   A week has 7 days.

2. **Calculate the number of cars towed in the first three days**:
   According to the problem, the tow truck towed 10 cars each day for the first three days. 
   \[
   \text{Cars towed in first three days} = 10 \text{ cars/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 30 \text{ cars}
   \]

3. **Determine the number of cars towed on the remaining days**:
   The remaining days in the week are:
   \[
   7 \text{ days} - 3 \text{ days} = 4 \text{ days}
   \]
   The problem states that the tow truck towed 4 fewer cars on each of these remaining days compared to the first three days. Since it towed 10 cars each day in the first three days, the number of cars towed each day in the remaining days is:
   \[
   10 \text{ cars} - 4 \text{ cars} = 6 \text{ cars}
   \]

4. **Calculate the number of cars towed in the remaining four days**:
   Now we can calculate the total number of cars towed during the remaining four days:
   \[
   \text{Cars towed in remaining four days} = 6 \text{ cars/day} \times 4 \text{ days} = 24 \text{ cars}
   \]

5. **Calculate the total number of cars towed for the week**:
   Finally, we add the number of cars towed in the first three days to the number of cars towed in the remaining four days:
   \[
   \text{Total cars towed} = \text{Cars towed in first three days} + \text{Cars towed in remaining four days}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total cars towed} = 30 \text{ cars} + 24 \text{ cars} = 54 \text{ cars}
   \]

Thus, the total number of cars towed by the tow truck that week is \( \boxed{54} \).
