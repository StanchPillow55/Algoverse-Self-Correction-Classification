Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To determine how many years it will take for Carlos to start earning money from his lemon tree, we need to analyze the costs and revenues associated with planting and maintaining the tree.

### Step 1: Calculate the initial cost
The initial cost to plant the lemon tree is given as:
- **Cost to plant the tree**: $90

### Step 2: Calculate annual revenue from lemons
Each year, the tree produces 7 lemons, and each lemon can be sold for $1.5. Therefore, the annual revenue from selling lemons can be calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Annual Revenue} = \text{Number of lemons} \times \text{Price per lemon}
\]
\[
\text{Annual Revenue} = 7 \text{ lemons} \times 1.5 \text{ dollars/lemon} = 10.5 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate annual costs
In addition to the initial planting cost, Carlos incurs an annual cost to water and feed the tree, which is given as:
- **Annual cost to water and feed the tree**: $3

### Step 4: Calculate annual profit
To find the annual profit, we subtract the annual costs from the annual revenue:

\[
\text{Annual Profit} = \text{Annual Revenue} - \text{Annual Costs}
\]
\[
\text{Annual Profit} = 10.5 \text{ dollars} - 3 \text{ dollars} = 7.5 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Step 5: Calculate the number of years to break even
Now, we need to determine how many years it will take for Carlos to recover his initial investment of $90 through his annual profit of $7.5. We can set up the equation:

\[
\text{Number of years} = \frac{\text{Initial Cost}}{\text{Annual Profit}}
\]
\[
\text{Number of years} = \frac{90 \text{ dollars}}{7.5 \text{ dollars/year}} = 12
\]

### Conclusion
Carlos will start earning money from the lemon tree after 12 years. 

Thus, the final answer is:

**12 years**
