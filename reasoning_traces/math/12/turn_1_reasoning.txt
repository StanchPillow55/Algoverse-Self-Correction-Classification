Question ID: 12
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To determine how many years it will take for Carlos to start earning money from his lemon tree, we need to analyze the costs and revenues associated with planting and maintaining the tree.

### Step 1: Calculate the initial cost
The initial cost to plant the lemon tree is given as:
- **Initial cost** = $90

### Step 2: Calculate annual revenue from lemons
Each year, the tree produces 7 lemons, and each lemon can be sold for $1.5. Therefore, the annual revenue from selling lemons can be calculated as follows:
\[
\text{Annual Revenue} = \text{Number of lemons} \times \text{Price per lemon}
\]
\[
\text{Annual Revenue} = 7 \text{ lemons} \times 1.5 \text{ dollars/lemon} = 10.5 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate annual costs
In addition to the initial planting cost, Carlos incurs an annual cost of $3 for watering and feeding the tree. Therefore, the total annual cost is:
\[
\text{Annual Cost} = \text{Cost of watering and feeding} = 3 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate annual profit
To find the annual profit, we subtract the annual costs from the annual revenue:
\[
\text{Annual Profit} = \text{Annual Revenue} - \text{Annual Cost}
\]
\[
\text{Annual Profit} = 10.5 \text{ dollars} - 3 \text{ dollars} = 7.5 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Step 5: Calculate the number of years to break even
To find out how many years it will take for Carlos to recover his initial investment of $90, we divide the initial cost by the annual profit:
\[
\text{Number of years to break even} = \frac{\text{Initial Cost}}{\text{Annual Profit}}
\]
\[
\text{Number of years to break even} = \frac{90 \text{ dollars}}{7.5 \text{ dollars/year}} = 12 \text{ years}
\]

### Conclusion
Carlos will start earning money from his lemon tree after **12 years**. 

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{12}
\]
