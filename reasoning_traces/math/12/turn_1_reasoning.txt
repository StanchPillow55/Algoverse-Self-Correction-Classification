Question ID: 12
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of coconut trees Randy has and then add that to the number of mango trees to find the total number of trees on his farm.

**Step 1: Determine the number of coconut trees.**

1. We know Randy has 60 mango trees.
2. The problem states that he has 5 less than half as many coconut trees as mango trees.
3. First, calculate half the number of mango trees:
   \[
   \frac{60}{2} = 30
   \]
4. Then, subtract 5 from this result to find the number of coconut trees:
   \[
   30 - 5 = 25
   \]

So, Randy has 25 coconut trees.

**Step 2: Calculate the total number of trees.**

1. Add the number of mango trees and coconut trees together:
   \[
   60 + 25 = 85
   \]

Therefore, Randy has a total of 85 trees on his farm.

**Final Answer:**
Randy has 85 trees in all on his farm.
