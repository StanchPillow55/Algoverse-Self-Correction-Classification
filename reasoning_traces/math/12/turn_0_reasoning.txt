==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to determine the total number of trees Randy has on his farm, which includes both mango trees and coconut trees.

1. **Identify the number of mango trees:**
   Randy has 60 mango trees.

2. **Determine the number of coconut trees:**
   The problem states that Randy has "5 less than half as many coconut trees as mango trees." 
   - First, we need to find half of the number of mango trees:
     \[
     \text{Half of mango trees} = \frac{60}{2} = 30
     \]
   - Next, we subtract 5 from this amount to find the number of coconut trees:
     \[
     \text{Number of coconut trees} = 30 - 5 = 25
     \]

3. **Calculate the total number of trees:**
   Now that we have the number of mango trees and coconut trees, we can find the total number of trees by adding these two amounts together:
   \[
   \text{Total number of trees} = \text{Number of mango trees} + \text{Number of coconut trees} = 60 + 25
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total number of trees} = 85
   \]

4. **Final answer:**
   Therefore, the total number of trees that Randy has on his farm is \( \boxed{85} \).
