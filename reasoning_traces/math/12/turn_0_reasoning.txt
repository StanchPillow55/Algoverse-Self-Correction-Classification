Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to find out how many coconut trees Randy has. We know that he has 5 less than half as many coconut trees as mango trees. 

To find half of the number of mango trees, we divide the number of mango trees by 2:

60 mango trees รท 2 = 30 trees

So, half the number of mango trees is 30. But Randy has 5 less than this number of coconut trees. So, we subtract 5 from 30:

30 trees - 5 trees = 25 trees

So, Randy has 25 coconut trees.

To find the total number of trees Randy has, we add the number of mango trees to the number of coconut trees:

60 mango trees + 25 coconut trees = 85 trees

So, Randy has 85 trees in total on his farm.
