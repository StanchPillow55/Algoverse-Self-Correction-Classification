To determine how many years it will take for Carlos to start earning money from his lemon tree, we need to analyze the costs and revenues associated with planting and maintaining the tree.

### Step 1: Calculate the annual revenue from the lemons.

Each year, the tree produces 7 lemons, and each lemon can be sold for $1.5. Therefore, the annual revenue from selling the lemons can be calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Annual Revenue} = \text{Number of Lemons} \times \text{Price per Lemon}
\]
\[
\text{Annual Revenue} = 7 \times 1.5 = 10.5 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the annual costs.

The costs associated with the tree include the annual watering and feeding costs. According to the problem, this cost is $3 per year. 

### Step 3: Calculate the net annual profit.

To find the net annual profit, we subtract the annual costs from the annual revenue:

\[
\text{Net Annual Profit} = \text{Annual Revenue} - \text{Annual Costs}
\]
\[
\text{Net Annual Profit} = 10.5 - 3 = 7.5 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the initial investment.

Carlos has an initial cost of planting the tree, which is $90.

### Step 5: Determine how many years it will take to recover the initial investment.

To find out how many years it will take for Carlos to recover his initial investment of $90 through his net annual profit of $7.5, we can set up the following equation:

\[
\text{Years} = \frac{\text{Initial Investment}}{\text{Net Annual Profit}}
\]
\[
\text{Years} = \frac{90}{7.5}
\]

Now, we perform the division:

\[
\text{Years} = 12
\]

### Conclusion

It will take Carlos **12 years** to start earning money from his lemon tree, as this is the time required to recover his initial investment of $90 through the net annual profit of $7.5.

Thus, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{12}
\]
