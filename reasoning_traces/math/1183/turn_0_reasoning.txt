Let's break down the problem step by step, keeping track of the number of apples at each stage.

1. **Initial Apples**: 
   - Two apples fell from the tree.
   - Total apples = 2.

2. **Newton's Actions**:
   - Newton picks up the two apples.
   - He puts one apple in his pocket and throws the other apple into the tree.
   - After this action, he has:
     - In his pocket: 1 apple
     - Thrown into the tree: 1 apple
   - Total apples still in play (including the one thrown): 2.

3. **Apples Falling from the Tree**:
   - Throwing the apple into the tree causes 5 more apples to fall out.
   - Total apples now = 2 (initial) + 5 (newly fallen) = 7 apples.

4. **Newton's Next Actions**:
   - Newton picks up these 5 fallen apples.
   - He puts all but one of these 5 apples in his pocket. This means he puts 4 apples in his pocket and keeps 1 apple in his hand.
   - Now, he has:
     - In his pocket: 1 (from the first action) + 4 (newly picked) = 5 apples
     - In his hand: 1 apple (the one he kept out).
   - Total apples now = 5 (in pocket) + 1 (in hand) = 6 apples.

5. **Throwing Another Apple**:
   - Newton throws the remaining apple (the one he kept in his hand) at the tree.
   - This causes another 6 apples to fall out of the tree.
   - Total apples now = 6 (previous total) + 6 (newly fallen) = 12 apples.

6. **Final Actions**:
   - Newton picks up all the remaining apples (which are the 6 newly fallen apples).
   - He now has:
     - In his pocket: 5 apples (from previous actions)
     - Plus the 6 new apples he just picked up.
   - Total apples = 5 (in pocket) + 6 (newly picked) = 11 apples.

7. **Conclusion**:
   - Newton goes home with a total of 11 apples.

Thus, the final answer is:

**11 apples**.
