==================================================

Let's break down the problem step by step to determine how many apples Newton brought home.

1. **Initial Apples**: 
   - Two apples fell out of the tree. 
   - Newton picked up both apples. 
   - At this point, he has 2 apples.

2. **First Action**: 
   - Newton puts one apple in his pocket and throws the other apple into the tree.
   - After this action, he has 1 apple in his pocket and 1 apple thrown into the tree.

3. **Apples Falling from the Tree**: 
   - Throwing the apple into the tree causes 5 more apples to fall out.
   - Now, the total number of apples Newton has is:
     - 1 apple in his pocket + 5 apples that fell = 6 apples.

4. **Second Action**: 
   - Newton puts all but one apple in his pocket. 
   - This means he keeps 1 apple out of the 6 apples.
   - He puts 5 apples in his pocket.
   - Now, he has 5 apples in his pocket and 1 apple that he is holding.

5. **Throwing Another Apple**: 
   - Newton throws the remaining apple at the tree.
   - This action causes another 6 apples to fall out of the tree.
   - Now, the total number of apples Newton has is:
     - 5 apples in his pocket + 6 apples that fell = 11 apples.

6. **Final Collection**: 
   - Newton picks up all the remaining apples (which are the 6 that fell).
   - He already has 5 apples in his pocket, so he adds the 6 apples to his pocket.
   - Therefore, the total number of apples he has now is:
     - 5 apples (in pocket) + 6 apples (picked up) = 11 apples.

7. **Conclusion**: 
   - Newton goes home with a total of 11 apples.

Thus, the final answer is:

**Newton brought home 11 apples.**
