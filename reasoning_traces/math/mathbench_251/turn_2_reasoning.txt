Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 251," we need to first understand what the problem is asking. However, the problem statement "Sample math problem 251" is not specific and does not provide any details or context about what needs to be solved. 

Since there is no specific math problem given, I will demonstrate how to approach a generic math problem by creating a sample problem and solving it step by step.

**Sample Problem:**
Calculate the value of \( x \) in the equation \( 3x + 5 = 20 \).

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Equation:**
   The equation given is \( 3x + 5 = 20 \). This is a linear equation in one variable, \( x \).

2. **Isolate the Variable:**
   To solve for \( x \), we need to isolate \( x \) on one side of the equation. We can do this by performing operations that will simplify the equation.

3. **Subtract 5 from Both Sides:**
   \[
   3x + 5 - 5 = 20 - 5
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   3x = 15
   \]

4. **Divide Both Sides by 3:**
   \[
   \frac{3x}{3} = \frac{15}{3}
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   x = 5
   \]

5. **Verify the Solution:**
   Substitute \( x = 5 \) back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies the equation:
   \[
   3(5) + 5 = 20
   \]
   \[
   15 + 5 = 20
   \]
   \[
   20 = 20
   \]
   The left-hand side equals the right-hand side, confirming that \( x = 5 \) is the correct solution.

**Final Answer:**
The value of \( x \) is 5.

This is a demonstration of how to approach and solve a linear equation. If you have a specific math problem labeled as "Sample math problem 251," please provide the details of the problem so I can assist you further.
