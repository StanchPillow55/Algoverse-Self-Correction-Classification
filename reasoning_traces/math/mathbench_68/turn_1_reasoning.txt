Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 68," we first need to understand what the problem is asking. However, the problem statement "Sample math problem 68" is not specific enough for us to determine the exact nature of the problem. It could refer to a problem from a textbook, a worksheet, or another source where "68" is a problem number.

Since the problem is not explicitly stated, let's consider a hypothetical math problem involving the number 68. We can create a problem and solve it step by step. Let's assume the problem is as follows:

**Problem:** What is the sum of the digits of the number 68, and what is the result when this sum is multiplied by 3?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Identify the digits of the number 68:**
   - The number 68 consists of two digits: 6 and 8.

2. **Calculate the sum of the digits:**
   - Sum = 6 + 8

   \[
   \text{Sum} = 6 + 8 = 14
   \]

3. **Multiply the sum by 3:**
   - Result = 14 Ã— 3

   \[
   \text{Result} = 14 \times 3 = 42
   \]

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The sum of the digits of 68 is 14, and when this sum is multiplied by 3, the result is 42.

Therefore, the final answer to our hypothetical problem is 42.
