==================================================

To solve the problem, we first need to understand what "Sample math problem 68" refers to. Since the problem itself isn't provided, I'll create a hypothetical math problem with the number 68 and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**

Calculate the sum of all even numbers from 1 to 68.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Identify the Even Numbers:**
   - Even numbers are integers divisible by 2.
   - From 1 to 68, the even numbers are 2, 4, 6, ..., 68.

2. **Determine the Sequence:**
   - This is an arithmetic sequence where the first term \( a_1 = 2 \) and the common difference \( d = 2 \).

3. **Find the Number of Terms:**
   - The general formula for the \( n \)-th term of an arithmetic sequence is:
     \[
     a_n = a_1 + (n-1) \cdot d
     \]
   - We need to find \( n \) such that \( a_n = 68 \):
     \[
     68 = 2 + (n-1) \cdot 2
     \]
     \[
     68 = 2 + 2n - 2
     \]
     \[
     68 = 2n
     \]
     \[
     n = \frac{68}{2} = 34
     \]
   - There are 34 even numbers from 1 to 68.

4. **Calculate the Sum of the Sequence:**
   - The sum \( S_n \) of the first \( n \) terms of an arithmetic sequence is given by:
     \[
     S_n = \frac{n}{2} \cdot (a_1 + a_n)
     \]
   - Substitute the known values:
     \[
     S_{34} = \frac{34}{2} \cdot (2 + 68)
     \]
     \[
     S_{34} = 17 \cdot 70
     \]
     \[
     S_{34} = 1190
     \]

**Final Answer:**

The sum of all even numbers from 1 to 68 is 1190.
