==================================================

It seems like there's a misunderstanding in the question you've provided. "Sample math problem 68" doesn't specify a particular math problem to solve. It might be a reference to a problem from a textbook or a specific set of problems, but without additional context or details, it's not possible to determine what the problem is.

To help you effectively, I need more information about the specific math problem you want to solve. Please provide the details or the actual math problem, and I'll be happy to work through it step by step and provide a solution.
