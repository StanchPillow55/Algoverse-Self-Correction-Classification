==================================================

To solve "Sample math problem 68," we need to first understand what the problem is asking. Since the problem is not explicitly stated, I'll create a hypothetical math problem involving the number 68 and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**
Calculate the sum of all even numbers from 1 to 68.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Identify the Even Numbers:**
   Even numbers are integers divisible by 2. From 1 to 68, the even numbers are 2, 4, 6, ..., 68.

2. **Determine the Sequence:**
   The sequence of even numbers from 1 to 68 is an arithmetic sequence where the first term \( a_1 = 2 \) and the common difference \( d = 2 \).

3. **Find the Number of Terms:**
   To find the number of terms \( n \) in the sequence, use the formula for the \( n \)-th term of an arithmetic sequence:
   \[
   a_n = a_1 + (n-1) \cdot d
   \]
   Set \( a_n = 68 \) (the last term):
   \[
   68 = 2 + (n-1) \cdot 2
   \]
   \[
   68 = 2 + 2n - 2
   \]
   \[
   68 = 2n
   \]
   \[
   n = \frac{68}{2} = 34
   \]
   So, there are 34 even numbers from 1 to 68.

4. **Calculate the Sum of the Sequence:**
   The sum \( S_n \) of an arithmetic sequence can be calculated using the formula:
   \[
   S_n = \frac{n}{2} \cdot (a_1 + a_n)
   \]
   Substitute the known values:
   \[
   S_{34} = \frac{34}{2} \cdot (2 + 68)
   \]
   \[
   S_{34} = 17 \cdot 70
   \]
   \[
   S_{34} = 1190
   \]

**Final Answer:**
The sum of all even numbers from 1 to 68 is 1190.
