==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 349" entails. Since the problem statement is not explicitly given, I'll assume that we need to demonstrate a general approach to solving a math problem by reasoning through a hypothetical example.

Let's consider a sample math problem:

**Problem:** Calculate the sum of all even numbers between 1 and 100.

**Step 1: Identify the even numbers between 1 and 100.**

Even numbers are integers that are divisible by 2. The smallest even number greater than 1 is 2, and the largest even number less than or equal to 100 is 100. Therefore, the even numbers between 1 and 100 are 2, 4, 6, ..., 100.

**Step 2: Determine the sequence of even numbers.**

The sequence of even numbers from 2 to 100 is an arithmetic sequence where the first term \( a_1 = 2 \) and the common difference \( d = 2 \).

**Step 3: Find the number of terms in the sequence.**

To find the number of terms \( n \) in the sequence, we use the formula for the \( n \)-th term of an arithmetic sequence:

\[
a_n = a_1 + (n-1) \cdot d
\]

Setting \( a_n = 100 \), we solve for \( n \):

\[
100 = 2 + (n-1) \cdot 2
\]

\[
100 = 2 + 2n - 2
\]

\[
100 = 2n
\]

\[
n = \frac{100}{2} = 50
\]

There are 50 even numbers between 1 and 100.

**Step 4: Calculate the sum of the sequence.**

The sum \( S_n \) of the first \( n \) terms of an arithmetic sequence is given by:

\[
S_n = \frac{n}{2} \cdot (a_1 + a_n)
\]

Substituting the known values:

\[
S_{50} = \frac{50}{2} \cdot (2 + 100)
\]

\[
S_{50} = 25 \cdot 102
\]

\[
S_{50} = 2550
\]

**Final Answer:**

The sum of all even numbers between 1 and 100 is 2550.
