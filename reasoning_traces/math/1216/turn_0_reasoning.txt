==================================================

To solve the problem, we will go through each step carefully, keeping track of the number of passengers on the bus at each stage.

1. **Initial Number of Passengers:**
   The bus starts with 20 people.

   \[
   \text{Initial passengers} = 20
   \]

2. **First Stop:**
   At the first stop, 40 people enter the bus.

   \[
   \text{Passengers after first stop} = 20 + 40 = 60
   \]

3. **Second Stop:**
   At the second stop, \( \frac{3}{4} \) of the total number of people who entered the bus at the first stop (which is 40) enter the bus.

   \[
   \text{Number of people entering at second stop} = \frac{3}{4} \times 40 = 30
   \]

   Now we add these 30 people to the current number of passengers.

   \[
   \text{Passengers after second stop} = 60 + 30 = 90
   \]

4. **Third Stop:**
   At the third stop, the number of passengers on the bus doubles.

   \[
   \text{Passengers after third stop} = 90 \times 2 = 180
   \]

5. **Bus Capacity:**
   The bus has a total capacity of 200 people. We need to find out how many more people are needed to fill the bus to its capacity.

   \[
   \text{Remaining spaces on the bus} = 200 - 180 = 20
   \]

Thus, the total number of people required to fill the remaining spaces on the bus is:

\[
\boxed{20}
\]
