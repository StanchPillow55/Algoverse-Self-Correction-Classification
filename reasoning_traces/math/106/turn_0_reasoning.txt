To solve this problem, we need to determine how many uncommon cards John gets from the 10 packs of magic cards he buys. Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Determine the Total Number of Cards:**
   John buys 10 packs of magic cards, and each pack contains 20 cards. To find the total number of cards, we multiply the number of packs by the number of cards per pack:

   \[
   \text{Total number of cards} = 10 \text{ packs} \times 20 \text{ cards per pack} = 200 \text{ cards}
   \]

2. **Determine the Fraction of Uncommon Cards:**
   According to the problem, 1/4 of the cards in each pack are uncommon. To find the number of uncommon cards, we need to calculate 1/4 of the total number of cards.

3. **Calculate the Number of Uncommon Cards:**
   We take 1/4 of the total 200 cards to find out how many are uncommon:

   \[
   \text{Number of uncommon cards} = \frac{1}{4} \times 200 = 50
   \]

Thus, John gets 50 uncommon cards from the 10 packs of magic cards.

**Final Answer:**
John gets 50 uncommon cards.
