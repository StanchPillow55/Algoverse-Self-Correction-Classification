To find out how many uncommon cards John got, we can follow these steps:

1. **Determine the total number of cards John bought**:
   John buys 10 packs of magic cards, and each pack contains 20 cards. To find the total number of cards, we multiply the number of packs by the number of cards per pack:

   \[
   \text{Total cards} = \text{Number of packs} \times \text{Cards per pack}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total cards} = 10 \times 20 = 200
   \]

   So, John has a total of 200 cards.

2. **Calculate the number of uncommon cards**:
   We know that 1/4 of the total cards are uncommon. To find the number of uncommon cards, we multiply the total number of cards by 1/4:

   \[
   \text{Uncommon cards} = \frac{1}{4} \times \text{Total cards}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Uncommon cards} = \frac{1}{4} \times 200
   \]

   Now, we perform the multiplication:

   \[
   \text{Uncommon cards} = 50
   \]

Thus, John got a total of **50 uncommon cards**.

**Final Answer**: 50
