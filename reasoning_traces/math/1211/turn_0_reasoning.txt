==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to determine the total volume of medicine Saanvi uses for one dosage and then calculate the total volume for 8 doses.

### Step 1: Calculate the amount of the second medicine

Saanvi combines 14 mL of the first medicine with 3 times that amount of the second medicine. 

First, we calculate the amount of the second medicine:
\[
\text{Amount of second medicine} = 3 \times \text{Amount of first medicine} = 3 \times 14 \, \text{mL}
\]
Calculating this gives:
\[
3 \times 14 = 42 \, \text{mL}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the total volume for one dosage

Now, we need to find the total volume of medicine in one dosage by adding the amounts of both medicines:
\[
\text{Total volume for one dosage} = \text{Amount of first medicine} + \text{Amount of second medicine}
\]
Substituting the values we calculated:
\[
\text{Total volume for one dosage} = 14 \, \text{mL} + 42 \, \text{mL} = 56 \, \text{mL}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the total volume for 8 doses

Now that we know the total volume for one dosage, we can find the total volume for 8 doses:
\[
\text{Total volume for 8 doses} = 8 \times \text{Total volume for one dosage}
\]
Substituting the value we found:
\[
\text{Total volume for 8 doses} = 8 \times 56 \, \text{mL}
\]
Calculating this gives:
\[
8 \times 56 = 448 \, \text{mL}
\]

### Final Answer

Thus, the total volume of medicine in 8 doses is:
\[
\boxed{448 \, \text{mL}}
\]
