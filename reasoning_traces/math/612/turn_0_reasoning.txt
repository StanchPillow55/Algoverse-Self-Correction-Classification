To determine the total amount of meat consumed by the basketball team, we will calculate the amount of meat each player ate and then sum these amounts.

1. **First Player:**
   - The first player ate a 6-ounce steak.
   - Amount of meat consumed by the first player = 6 ounces.

2. **Second Player:**
   - The second player ate beef tips, with each beef tip weighing 1 ounce. There were 8 beef tips.
   - Amount of meat consumed by the second player = 8 beef tips × 1 ounce/beef tip = 8 ounces.

3. **Third Player:**
   - The third player ate a one-pound steak. We need to convert pounds to ounces. There are 16 ounces in a pound.
   - Amount of meat consumed by the third player = 1 pound × 16 ounces/pound = 16 ounces.

4. **Fourth and Fifth Players:**
   - The fourth and fifth players ordered vegetarian meals, which means they did not consume any meat.
   - Amount of meat consumed by the fourth player = 0 ounces.
   - Amount of meat consumed by the fifth player = 0 ounces.

Now, we will sum the amounts of meat consumed by all players:

\[
\text{Total meat consumed} = (\text{First Player}) + (\text{Second Player}) + (\text{Third Player}) + (\text{Fourth Player}) + (\text{Fifth Player})
\]

Substituting the values we calculated:

\[
\text{Total meat consumed} = 6 \text{ ounces} + 8 \text{ ounces} + 16 \text{ ounces} + 0 \text{ ounces} + 0 \text{ ounces}
\]

Calculating the total:

\[
\text{Total meat consumed} = 6 + 8 + 16 + 0 + 0 = 30 \text{ ounces}
\]

Thus, the total amount of meat consumed by the team is:

\[
\boxed{30} \text{ ounces}
\]
