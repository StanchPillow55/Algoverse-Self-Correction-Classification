==================================================

To solve the problem, we will follow these steps:

1. **Determine the amount of water in the tank.**
2. **Calculate the total amount of water used from the tank over 6 days.**
3. **Subtract the total amount of water used from the initial amount in the tank to find the remaining water.**

### Step 1: Determine the amount of water in the tank

The problem states that Anthony and his father fill a tank with half the amount of water in the pool. The pool contains 10,000 gallons of water.

\[
\text{Amount of water in the tank} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Amount of water in the pool}
\]
\[
\text{Amount of water in the tank} = \frac{1}{2} \times 10,000 = 5,000 \text{ gallons}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the total amount of water used from the tank over 6 days

The tank is emptied at a rate of 500 gallons of water per day. To find out how much water is used in 6 days, we multiply the daily usage by the number of days.

\[
\text{Total water used in 6 days} = \text{Daily usage} \times \text{Number of days}
\]
\[
\text{Total water used in 6 days} = 500 \text{ gallons/day} \times 6 \text{ days} = 3,000 \text{ gallons}
\]

### Step 3: Subtract the total amount of water used from the initial amount in the tank

Now, we will subtract the total amount of water used from the initial amount of water in the tank to find out how much water remains.

\[
\text{Remaining water in the tank} = \text{Initial amount in the tank} - \text{Total water used}
\]
\[
\text{Remaining water in the tank} = 5,000 \text{ gallons} - 3,000 \text{ gallons} = 2,000 \text{ gallons}
\]

### Final Answer

After 6 days, the amount of water remaining in the tank is:

\[
\boxed{2000} \text{ gallons}
\]
