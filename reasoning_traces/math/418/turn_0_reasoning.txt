==================================================

To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step.

1. **Identify the total number of pencils Ken had**: 
   Ken started with 50 pencils.

2. **Determine how many pencils Ken gave to Manny**: 
   According to the problem, Ken gave 10 pencils to Manny.

3. **Determine how many pencils Ken gave to Nilo**: 
   The problem states that Ken gave 10 more pencils to Nilo than he gave to Manny. Since Manny received 10 pencils, we can calculate how many pencils Nilo received:
   \[
   \text{Pencils given to Nilo} = \text{Pencils given to Manny} + 10 = 10 + 10 = 20
   \]

4. **Calculate the total number of pencils given away**: 
   Now we will add the number of pencils given to Manny and Nilo:
   \[
   \text{Total pencils given away} = \text{Pencils given to Manny} + \text{Pencils given to Nilo} = 10 + 20 = 30
   \]

5. **Determine how many pencils Ken kept**: 
   To find out how many pencils Ken kept, we subtract the total number of pencils given away from the total number of pencils he originally had:
   \[
   \text{Pencils kept by Ken} = \text{Total pencils} - \text{Total pencils given away} = 50 - 30 = 20
   \]

6. **Final answer**: 
   Ken kept 20 pencils.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{20}
\]
