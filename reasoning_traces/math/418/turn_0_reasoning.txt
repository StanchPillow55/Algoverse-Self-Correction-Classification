To solve the problem, we need to establish the relationships between the sizes of the lockers based on the information provided.

1. **Identify the sizes of the lockers:**
   - Let \( T \) represent the size of Timothy's locker in cubic inches.
   - According to the problem, Zack's locker is half as big as Timothy's locker. Therefore, we can express the size of Zack's locker \( Z \) as:
     \[
     Z = \frac{1}{2} T
     \]
   - Peter's locker is 1/4 the size of Zack's locker. Thus, we can express the size of Peter's locker \( P \) as:
     \[
     P = \frac{1}{4} Z
     \]

2. **Substituting the expression for Zack's locker into Peter's locker:**
   - We already have \( Z = \frac{1}{2} T \). Now we substitute this into the equation for Peter's locker:
     \[
     P = \frac{1}{4} Z = \frac{1}{4} \left(\frac{1}{2} T\right)
     \]
   - Simplifying this gives:
     \[
     P = \frac{1}{4} \cdot \frac{1}{2} T = \frac{1}{8} T
     \]

3. **Using the information about Peter's locker:**
   - We know from the problem statement that Peter's locker is 5 cubic inches. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
     \[
     \frac{1}{8} T = 5
     \]

4. **Solving for Timothy's locker size \( T \):**
   - To find \( T \), we multiply both sides of the equation by 8:
     \[
     T = 5 \times 8
     \]
   - Calculating this gives:
     \[
     T = 40
     \]

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The size of Timothy's locker is \( 40 \) cubic inches.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{40}
\]
