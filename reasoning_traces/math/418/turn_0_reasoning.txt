==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine how many pencils Ken kept after giving some to his friends Manny and Nilo.

1. **Identify the total number of pencils Ken initially had:**
   - Ken started with 50 pencils.

2. **Determine how many pencils Ken gave to Manny:**
   - Ken gave 10 pencils to Manny.

3. **Determine how many pencils Ken gave to Nilo:**
   - Ken gave 10 more pencils to Nilo than he gave to Manny.
   - Since Ken gave 10 pencils to Manny, he gave \(10 + 10 = 20\) pencils to Nilo.

4. **Calculate the total number of pencils given away:**
   - Ken gave 10 pencils to Manny and 20 pencils to Nilo.
   - Total pencils given away = 10 (to Manny) + 20 (to Nilo) = 30 pencils.

5. **Calculate how many pencils Ken kept:**
   - Ken initially had 50 pencils and gave away 30 pencils.
   - The number of pencils Ken kept = 50 (initial pencils) - 30 (pencils given away) = 20 pencils.

Therefore, Ken kept 20 pencils.

**Final Answer: Ken kept 20 pencils.**
