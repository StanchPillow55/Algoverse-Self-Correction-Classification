Question ID: 212
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To determine how many hours a day Randy needs to practice to become a piano expert before he turns 20, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total time available for practice**:
   - Randy is currently 12 years old and wants to become an expert before he turns 20. This gives him a total of \(20 - 12 = 8\) years to practice.

2. **Calculate the total number of days available for practice**:
   - In 8 years, there are \(8 \times 365 = 2920\) days.
   - However, Randy takes 2 weeks off each year for vacation. In 2 weeks, there are \(2 \times 7 = 14\) days.
   - Over 8 years, the total number of vacation days is \(8 \times 14 = 112\) days.
   - Therefore, the total number of practice days is:
     \[
     2920 - 112 = 2808 \text{ days}
     \]

3. **Calculate the daily practice hours needed**:
   - According to the 10,000-hour rule, Randy needs to practice a total of 10,000 hours.
   - To find out how many hours he needs to practice each day, we divide the total hours by the number of practice days:
     \[
     \text{Hours per day} = \frac{10,000 \text{ hours}}{2808 \text{ days}} \approx 3.56 \text{ hours/day}
     \]

4. **Final answer**:
   - Randy needs to practice approximately **3.56 hours per day** from Monday to Friday to become a piano expert before he turns 20. 

Thus, the final answer is that Randy needs to practice about **3.56 hours each day**.
