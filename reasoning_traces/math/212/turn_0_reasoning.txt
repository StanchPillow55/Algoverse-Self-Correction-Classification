Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine how many hours per day Randy needs to practice to reach 10,000 hours before he turns 20. Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Step 1: Determine the Time Frame
Randy is currently 12 years old and wants to become an expert by the time he is 20. Therefore, he has:

\[ 20 - 12 = 8 \text{ years} \]

### Step 2: Calculate the Total Number of Practice Days
Randy practices every day from Monday to Friday and takes two weeks off for vacation each year. Let's calculate the number of practice days per year.

1. **Total weeks in a year:** 52 weeks
2. **Weeks off for vacation:** 2 weeks
3. **Weeks available for practice:** \( 52 - 2 = 50 \text{ weeks} \)

Randy practices 5 days a week (Monday to Friday), so the number of practice days per year is:

\[ 50 \text{ weeks} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = 250 \text{ days/year} \]

### Step 3: Calculate the Total Number of Practice Days Over 8 Years
Now, we calculate the total number of practice days over the 8 years:

\[ 250 \text{ days/year} \times 8 \text{ years} = 2000 \text{ days} \]

### Step 4: Determine the Required Daily Practice Hours
Randy needs to accumulate 10,000 hours of practice over these 2000 days. To find out how many hours he needs to practice each day, we divide the total hours by the total number of practice days:

\[ \frac{10,000 \text{ hours}}{2000 \text{ days}} = 5 \text{ hours/day} \]

### Conclusion
Randy needs to practice 5 hours each day, Monday through Friday, to reach 10,000 hours of practice before he turns 20, assuming he takes two weeks off for vacation each year.

**Final Answer:** Randy needs to practice 5 hours per day.
