==================================================

To determine how many hours per day Randy needs to practice the piano to reach 10,000 hours before he turns 20, we will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of years Randy has to practice**: 
   - Randy is currently 12 years old and wants to become an expert before he turns 20.
   - Therefore, he has \(20 - 12 = 8\) years to practice.

2. **Calculate the total number of days Randy will practice each year**:
   - Randy practices every day from Monday to Friday, which means he practices 5 days a week.
   - There are 52 weeks in a year, so the total number of weekdays in a year is:
     \[
     5 \text{ days/week} \times 52 \text{ weeks/year} = 260 \text{ days/year}
     \]
   - However, Randy takes 2 weeks off for vacation each year. This means he will not practice for:
     \[
     5 \text{ days/week} \times 2 \text{ weeks} = 10 \text{ days}
     \]
   - Therefore, the total number of days he will practice in a year is:
     \[
     260 \text{ days/year} - 10 \text{ days} = 250 \text{ days/year}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total number of days Randy will practice over 8 years**:
   - Over 8 years, the total number of practice days will be:
     \[
     250 \text{ days/year} \times 8 \text{ years} = 2000 \text{ days}
     \]

4. **Determine how many hours per day Randy needs to practice**:
   - To become an expert, Randy needs to accumulate 10,000 hours of practice. We can find out how many hours he needs to practice each day by dividing the total hours by the total number of practice days:
     \[
     \text{Hours per day} = \frac{10,000 \text{ hours}}{2000 \text{ days}} = 5 \text{ hours/day}
     \]

Thus, Randy needs to practice **5 hours per day** on weekdays to reach 10,000 hours of practice before he turns 20.

**Final Answer**: Randy needs to practice **5 hours per day**.
