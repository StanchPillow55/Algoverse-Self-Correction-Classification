==================================================

To solve the problem, we will break it down into parts and calculate the total time from starting the oil to having cooked chicken.

1. **Time to heat oil to 300 degrees**: 
   - Given that it takes 20 minutes to heat the oil to 300 degrees.

2. **Time to heat oil to 400 degrees**: 
   - It takes 40% longer than the time taken to heat to 300 degrees.
   - First, we calculate 40% of 20 minutes:
     \[
     0.40 \times 20 = 8 \text{ minutes}
     \]
   - Therefore, the total time to heat the oil to 400 degrees is:
     \[
     20 \text{ minutes} + 8 \text{ minutes} = 28 \text{ minutes}
     \]

3. **Total time to heat the oil**:
   - The total time taken to heat the oil from the start to 400 degrees is:
     \[
     28 \text{ minutes}
     \]

4. **Time to cook the chicken**:
   - It takes 5 minutes less time to cook than it took to warm up the oil.
   - Since it took 28 minutes to heat the oil to 400 degrees, the cooking time is:
     \[
     28 \text{ minutes} - 5 \text{ minutes} = 23 \text{ minutes}
     \]

5. **Total time from starting the oil to having cooked chicken**:
   - We add the time taken to heat the oil and the time taken to cook the chicken:
     \[
     28 \text{ minutes} + 23 \text{ minutes} = 51 \text{ minutes}
     \]

Thus, the total time that passes from starting the oil to having cooked chicken is:

\[
\boxed{51 \text{ minutes}}
\]
