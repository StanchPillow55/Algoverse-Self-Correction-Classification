To solve this problem, we need to determine how many pizzas Jimmy can make with the flour he has left after selling pizzas at the carnival for 7 hours.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of pizzas Jimmy can make in 7 hours.**

- Jimmy takes 10 minutes to make one pizza.
- There are 60 minutes in an hour, so in 7 hours, there are:
  \[
  7 \times 60 = 420 \text{ minutes}
  \]

- Since each pizza takes 10 minutes to make, the number of pizzas he can make in 7 hours is:
  \[
  \frac{420}{10} = 42 \text{ pizzas}
  \]

**Step 2: Calculate the amount of flour used to make these 42 pizzas.**

- Each pizza requires 0.5 kg of flour.
- Therefore, the total amount of flour used for 42 pizzas is:
  \[
  42 \times 0.5 = 21 \text{ kg}
  \]

**Step 3: Determine the amount of flour left after making 42 pizzas.**

- Jimmy started with a 22 kg sack of flour.
- After making 42 pizzas, he used 21 kg of flour.
- The amount of flour left is:
  \[
  22 - 21 = 1 \text{ kg}
  \]

**Step 4: Calculate how many additional pizzas can be made with the remaining flour.**

- Each pizza requires 0.5 kg of flour.
- With 1 kg of flour left, the number of additional pizzas he can make is:
  \[
  \frac{1}{0.5} = 2 \text{ pizzas}
  \]

Therefore, with the flour left, Jimmy can make 2 additional pizzas to bring home.

**Final Answer:**
Jimmy can make 2 pizzas with the flour left after the carnival.
