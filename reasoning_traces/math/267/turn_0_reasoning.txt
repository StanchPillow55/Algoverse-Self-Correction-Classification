==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to determine how many pizzas Jimmy can make with the flour he has and how much time he has available to make those pizzas.

### Step 1: Calculate the total time available in minutes
Jimmy has 7 hours to sell pizzas. We need to convert this time into minutes:

\[
7 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 420 \text{ minutes}
\]

### Step 2: Determine how many pizzas he can make in that time
Jimmy takes 10 minutes to make each pizza. To find out how many pizzas he can make in 420 minutes, we divide the total time by the time taken per pizza:

\[
\text{Number of pizzas} = \frac{420 \text{ minutes}}{10 \text{ minutes/pizza}} = 42 \text{ pizzas}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the total amount of flour needed for 42 pizzas
Each pizza requires 0.5 kg of flour. Therefore, the total amount of flour needed for 42 pizzas is:

\[
\text{Flour needed} = 42 \text{ pizzas} \times 0.5 \text{ kg/pizza} = 21 \text{ kg}
\]

### Step 4: Determine how much flour is left after making the pizzas
Jimmy started with a 22 kg sack of flour. After making 42 pizzas, the amount of flour left is:

\[
\text{Flour left} = 22 \text{ kg} - 21 \text{ kg} = 1 \text{ kg}
\]

### Conclusion
Jimmy can make a total of **42 pizzas** and will have **1 kg of flour left** after making them.

Thus, the final answer is:

**42 pizzas with 1 kg of flour left.**
