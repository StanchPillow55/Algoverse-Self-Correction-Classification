Question ID: 267
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to determine how many pizzas Jimmy can make with the flour he has, given the time constraints and the amount of flour each pizza requires. Let's break this down step by step.

### Step 1: Calculate Total Time Available
Jimmy has 7 hours to sell pizzas. We need to convert this time into minutes since the time to make each pizza is given in minutes.

\[
7 \text{ hours} = 7 \times 60 \text{ minutes} = 420 \text{ minutes}
\]

### Step 2: Determine Time Per Pizza
Jimmy takes 10 minutes to make each pizza. We can calculate how many pizzas he can make in the total time available.

\[
\text{Number of pizzas} = \frac{\text{Total time available}}{\text{Time per pizza}} = \frac{420 \text{ minutes}}{10 \text{ minutes/pizza}} = 42 \text{ pizzas}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate Flour Required for 42 Pizzas
Each pizza requires 0.5 kg of flour. We can calculate the total amount of flour needed to make 42 pizzas.

\[
\text{Flour needed} = \text{Number of pizzas} \times \text{Flour per pizza} = 42 \text{ pizzas} \times 0.5 \text{ kg/pizza} = 21 \text{ kg}
\]

### Step 4: Determine Flour Left
Jimmy started with a 22 kg sack of flour. After making 42 pizzas, we can find out how much flour he has left.

\[
\text{Flour left} = \text{Initial flour} - \text{Flour used} = 22 \text{ kg} - 21 \text{ kg} = 1 \text{ kg}
\]

### Step 5: Conclusion
At the end of the 7 hours, after making 42 pizzas, Jimmy will have 1 kg of flour left. 

Thus, the final answer is:

**Jimmy can make 42 pizzas and will have 1 kg of flour left.**
