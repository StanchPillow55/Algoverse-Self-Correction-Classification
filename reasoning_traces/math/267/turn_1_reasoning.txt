Question ID: 267
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to determine how many pizzas Jimmy can make with the flour he has, given the time constraints and the amount of flour required for each pizza.

### Step 1: Calculate the total time available in minutes
Jimmy has 7 hours to sell pizzas. We need to convert this time into minutes:
\[
7 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 420 \text{ minutes}
\]

### Step 2: Determine how many pizzas he can make in that time
Jimmy takes 10 minutes to make each pizza. To find out how many pizzas he can make in 420 minutes, we divide the total time by the time it takes to make one pizza:
\[
\frac{420 \text{ minutes}}{10 \text{ minutes/pizza}} = 42 \text{ pizzas}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the total amount of flour needed for 42 pizzas
Each pizza requires 0.5 kg of flour. Therefore, the total amount of flour needed for 42 pizzas is:
\[
42 \text{ pizzas} \times 0.5 \text{ kg/pizza} = 21 \text{ kg}
\]

### Step 4: Determine how much flour is left after making 42 pizzas
Jimmy started with a 22 kg sack of flour. After making 42 pizzas, the amount of flour left is:
\[
22 \text{ kg} - 21 \text{ kg} = 1 \text{ kg}
\]

### Step 5: Conclusion
Since Jimmy has 1 kg of flour left after making 42 pizzas, he can indeed make 42 pizzas and still have some flour remaining.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\text{Jimmy can make } 42 \text{ pizzas and bring home } 1 \text{ kg of flour left.}
\]
