==================================================

To solve the problem, we will break it down into parts and calculate the total time taken from starting the oil to having cooked chicken.

1. **Heating the oil to 300 degrees:**
   - The time taken to heat the oil to 300 degrees is given as **20 minutes**.

2. **Heating the oil to 400 degrees:**
   - It takes **40% longer** to heat the oil from 300 degrees to 400 degrees.
   - First, we need to calculate 40% of the time it took to heat to 300 degrees:
     \[
     40\% \text{ of } 20 \text{ minutes} = 0.40 \times 20 = 8 \text{ minutes}
     \]
   - Therefore, the time taken to heat the oil to 400 degrees is:
     \[
     20 \text{ minutes} + 8 \text{ minutes} = 28 \text{ minutes}
     \]

3. **Total time to heat the oil:**
   - The total time taken to heat the oil from the start to 400 degrees is:
     \[
     20 \text{ minutes} + 28 \text{ minutes} = 48 \text{ minutes}
     \]

4. **Cooking the chicken:**
   - After warming the oil, it takes **5 minutes less time to cook** than it took to warm up the oil.
   - The time taken to warm up the oil is **48 minutes**, so the cooking time is:
     \[
     48 \text{ minutes} - 5 \text{ minutes} = 43 \text{ minutes}
     \]

5. **Total time from starting the oil to having cooked chicken:**
   - Finally, we add the total heating time and the cooking time:
     \[
     48 \text{ minutes} + 43 \text{ minutes} = 91 \text{ minutes}
     \]

Thus, the total time that passes from starting the oil to having cooked chicken is **91 minutes**.

**Final Answer: 91 minutes**
