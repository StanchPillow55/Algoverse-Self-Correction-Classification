==================================================

It seems like there might be some confusion with the problem statement "Sample math problem 38." This doesn't provide specific details about the math problem you're referring to. However, I can guide you through a generic approach to solving a math problem, or if you have a specific problem in mind, please provide the details, and I'll be happy to help.

For now, let's assume a generic math problem and solve it step by step:

**Example Problem:**
Solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We need to find the value of \( x \) that makes the equation true.

2. **Isolate the Variable:**
   - The equation is \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).
   - To isolate \( x \), we first need to get rid of the constant term on the left side of the equation.

3. **Subtract 3 from Both Sides:**
   \[
   2x + 3 - 3 = 11 - 3
   \]
   \[
   2x = 8
   \]

4. **Divide Both Sides by 2:**
   \[
   \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{8}{2}
   \]
   \[
   x = 4
   \]

5. **Verify the Solution:**
   - Substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies the equation.
   \[
   2(4) + 3 = 11
   \]
   \[
   8 + 3 = 11
   \]
   - Since both sides of the equation are equal, \( x = 4 \) is indeed the correct solution.

**Final Answer:**
\( x = 4 \)

If you have a specific problem or need assistance with a different type of math problem, please provide the details, and I'll be glad to help you solve it.
