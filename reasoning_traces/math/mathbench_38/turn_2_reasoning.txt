==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 38," we need to first understand what the problem is asking. Since the problem statement is not provided, let's assume a generic math problem and solve it step by step. 

Let's assume the problem is:

**Problem 38:** Solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 3x + 5 = 20 \).

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Understand the Equation:**
   The equation given is \( 3x + 5 = 20 \). This is a linear equation in one variable, \( x \).

2. **Isolate the Variable:**
   To solve for \( x \), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We start by eliminating the constant term on the left side.

   \[
   3x + 5 = 20
   \]

   Subtract 5 from both sides to remove the constant term from the left side:

   \[
   3x + 5 - 5 = 20 - 5
   \]

   Simplifying both sides gives:

   \[
   3x = 15
   \]

3. **Solve for \( x \):**
   Now, we need to solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides of the equation by the coefficient of \( x \), which is 3.

   \[
   \frac{3x}{3} = \frac{15}{3}
   \]

   Simplifying both sides gives:

   \[
   x = 5
   \]

4. **Verify the Solution:**
   To ensure our solution is correct, we substitute \( x = 5 \) back into the original equation to check if both sides are equal.

   Substitute \( x = 5 \) into \( 3x + 5 \):

   \[
   3(5) + 5 = 15 + 5 = 20
   \]

   The left side equals the right side of the original equation, confirming that our solution is correct.

### Final Answer:

The solution to the equation \( 3x + 5 = 20 \) is \( x = 5 \).
