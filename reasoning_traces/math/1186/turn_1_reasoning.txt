Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To find out how many miles Sam ran this week, we need to break down the distances he ran each day and then sum them up.

1. **Identify the distances Sam ran each day:**
   - **Monday:** 3 miles
   - **Tuesday:** 5 miles
   - **Wednesday:** 3 miles
   - **Thursday:** 5 miles
   - **Friday:** 3 miles

2. **Calculate the total distance for each type of day:**
   - For the days Sam ran 3 miles (Monday, Wednesday, and Friday):
     - There are 3 days where he ran 3 miles.
     - Total distance for these days = 3 miles/day × 3 days = 9 miles.
   
   - For the days Sam ran 5 miles (Tuesday and Thursday):
     - There are 2 days where he ran 5 miles.
     - Total distance for these days = 5 miles/day × 2 days = 10 miles.

3. **Add the total distances from both types of days:**
   - Total distance for the week = Distance from 3-mile days + Distance from 5-mile days
   - Total distance for the week = 9 miles + 10 miles = 19 miles.

4. **Final Answer:**
   - Sam ran a total of **19 miles** this week.

Thus, the final answer is **19 miles**.
