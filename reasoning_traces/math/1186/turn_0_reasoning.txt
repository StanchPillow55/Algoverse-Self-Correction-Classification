==================================================

To find out how many miles Sam ran this week, we need to break down the distances he ran each day and then sum them up.

1. **Identify the distances run on each day:**
   - **Monday:** 3 miles
   - **Tuesday:** 5 miles
   - **Wednesday:** 3 miles
   - **Thursday:** 5 miles
   - **Friday:** 3 miles

2. **Calculate the total distance for each type of day:**
   - For the days Sam ran 3 miles (Monday, Wednesday, and Friday):
     - Number of days = 3
     - Distance per day = 3 miles
     - Total distance for these days = \(3 \text{ miles/day} \times 3 \text{ days} = 9 \text{ miles}\)

   - For the days Sam ran 5 miles (Tuesday and Thursday):
     - Number of days = 2
     - Distance per day = 5 miles
     - Total distance for these days = \(5 \text{ miles/day} \times 2 \text{ days} = 10 \text{ miles}\)

3. **Add the total distances from both types of days:**
   - Total distance for the week = Total distance on 3-mile days + Total distance on 5-mile days
   - Total distance for the week = \(9 \text{ miles} + 10 \text{ miles} = 19 \text{ miles}\)

4. **Final answer:**
   - Sam ran a total of **19 miles** this week.

Thus, the final answer is **19 miles**.
