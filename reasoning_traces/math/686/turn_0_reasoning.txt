==================================================

To solve the problem, we will follow these steps:

1. **Determine how many cookies Celinda bakes.**
   - Greta bakes 30 cookies.
   - Celinda bakes twice as many as Greta. Therefore, we calculate:
     \[
     \text{Cookies Celinda bakes} = 2 \times \text{Cookies Greta bakes} = 2 \times 30 = 60
     \]

2. **Calculate the total number of cookies baked by both Greta and Celinda.**
   - We add the number of cookies baked by Greta and Celinda:
     \[
     \text{Total cookies} = \text{Cookies Greta bakes} + \text{Cookies Celinda bakes} = 30 + 60 = 90
     \]

3. **Determine how many cookies they eat while cooling.**
   - They eat 10 cookies. 

4. **Calculate the number of cookies that go into the box.**
   - To find out how many cookies are left after they eat some, we subtract the number of cookies they ate from the total number of cookies:
     \[
     \text{Cookies in the box} = \text{Total cookies} - \text{Cookies eaten} = 90 - 10 = 80
     \]

5. **State the final answer.**
   - The number of cookies in the box is:
     \[
     \boxed{80}
     \] 

Thus, there are 80 cookies in the box after Greta and Celinda eat 10 of them.
