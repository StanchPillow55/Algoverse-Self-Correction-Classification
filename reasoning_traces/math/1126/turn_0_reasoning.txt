To determine how many days it will take Alfie the albatross to fly a distance equal to half of the way around the Earth, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate Half the Circumference of the Earth**:
   The circumference of the Earth is given as 40,000 kilometers. To find half of this distance, we divide by 2:
   \[
   \text{Half of the circumference} = \frac{40,000 \text{ km}}{2} = 20,000 \text{ km}
   \]

2. **Determine Alfie's Daily Flight Distance**:
   Alfie flies 400 kilometers every day.

3. **Calculate the Number of Days Required**:
   To find out how many days it will take Alfie to fly 20,000 kilometers, we divide the total distance (20,000 km) by the distance he flies each day (400 km):
   \[
   \text{Number of days} = \frac{20,000 \text{ km}}{400 \text{ km/day}} 
   \]

   Performing the division:
   \[
   \text{Number of days} = 50
   \]

Thus, it will take Alfie 50 days to fly a distance equal to half of the way around the Earth.

**Final Answer**: 50 days
