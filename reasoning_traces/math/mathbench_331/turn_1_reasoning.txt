Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the sample math problem 331, we need to first understand what the problem is asking. However, since "Sample math problem 331" is not a standard problem statement, let's assume this is a placeholder for a specific math problem. For the sake of this exercise, let's create a hypothetical math problem and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem 331:**

"Find the value of \( x \) in the equation \( 2x + 5 = 17 \)."

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Equation:**
   The equation given is \( 2x + 5 = 17 \). This is a linear equation in one variable, \( x \).

2. **Isolate the Variable:**
   To solve for \( x \), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We can do this by performing operations that will leave \( x \) alone on one side.

3. **Subtract 5 from Both Sides:**
   To begin isolating \( x \), subtract 5 from both sides of the equation to eliminate the constant term on the left side.
   \[
   2x + 5 - 5 = 17 - 5
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   2x = 12
   \]

4. **Divide Both Sides by 2:**
   Now, divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( x \).
   \[
   \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{12}{2}
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   x = 6
   \]

5. **Verify the Solution:**
   Substitute \( x = 6 \) back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies the equation.
   \[
   2(6) + 5 = 17
   \]
   Simplifying the left side:
   \[
   12 + 5 = 17
   \]
   \[
   17 = 17
   \]
   The left side equals the right side, confirming that our solution is correct.

**Final Answer:**

The value of \( x \) is \( 6 \).
