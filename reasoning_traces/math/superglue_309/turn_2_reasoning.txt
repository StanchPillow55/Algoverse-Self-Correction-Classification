Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, let's first break down the information given in the question. However, it appears that the question is labeled as "Sample reasoning question 309" without any specific mathematical problem or context provided. Therefore, I will assume this is a placeholder or an incomplete question.

Since there is no specific mathematical problem to solve, I will demonstrate a general approach to solving a typical math problem by using a hypothetical example. Let's consider a common type of math problem: solving a linear equation.

**Example Problem:**
Solve the equation \(2x + 3 = 11\).

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   The goal is to find the value of \(x\) that makes the equation true.

2. **Isolate the Variable:**
   To solve for \(x\), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We start by eliminating the constant term on the left side.

   \[
   2x + 3 = 11
   \]

   Subtract 3 from both sides to get:

   \[
   2x + 3 - 3 = 11 - 3
   \]

   Simplifying both sides gives:

   \[
   2x = 8
   \]

3. **Solve for the Variable:**
   Now, divide both sides by 2 to solve for \(x\).

   \[
   \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{8}{2}
   \]

   Simplifying both sides gives:

   \[
   x = 4
   \]

4. **Check the Solution:**
   Substitute \(x = 4\) back into the original equation to verify the solution.

   \[
   2(4) + 3 = 11
   \]

   Simplifying the left side gives:

   \[
   8 + 3 = 11
   \]

   Since both sides of the equation are equal, the solution \(x = 4\) is correct.

**Final Answer:**
The solution to the equation \(2x + 3 = 11\) is \(x = 4\).
