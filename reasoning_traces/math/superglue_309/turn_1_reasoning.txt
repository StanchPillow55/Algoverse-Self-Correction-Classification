Question ID: superglue_309
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, I need more specific information about "Sample reasoning question 309." Since the question is not provided, I'll demonstrate how to approach a typical math problem step by step. Let's assume a sample math problem and solve it:

**Sample Problem:**
Calculate the area of a triangle with a base of 10 units and a height of 5 units.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We need to find the area of a triangle.
   - We are given the base (b) = 10 units and the height (h) = 5 units.

2. **Recall the Formula for the Area of a Triangle:**
   \[
   \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height}
   \]

3. **Substitute the Given Values into the Formula:**
   \[
   \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times 10 \times 5
   \]

4. **Perform the Multiplication:**
   - First, multiply the base and the height:
     \[
     10 \times 5 = 50
     \]
   - Then, multiply by \(\frac{1}{2}\):
     \[
     \frac{1}{2} \times 50 = 25
     \]

5. **State the Final Answer:**
   - The area of the triangle is 25 square units.

This is how you would solve a typical math problem by breaking it down into understandable steps, applying the appropriate formula, and performing the necessary calculations to arrive at the final answer. If you have a specific problem or question number 309, please provide the details, and I can work through that specific problem for you.
