==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine the cost of each small storage tub. We are given the following information:

1. Alison bought 3 large tubs and 6 small tubs for a total of $48.
2. Each large tub costs $6.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

### Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the large tubs.
Since each large tub costs $6 and Alison bought 3 large tubs, we can calculate the total cost of the large tubs as follows:

\[
\text{Total cost of large tubs} = \text{Number of large tubs} \times \text{Cost per large tub} = 3 \times 6 = 18
\]

### Step 2: Determine the remaining cost for the small tubs.
The total amount Alison spent on all the tubs is $48. We have already calculated that $18 was spent on the large tubs. Therefore, the remaining amount spent on the small tubs is:

\[
\text{Total cost of small tubs} = \text{Total cost of all tubs} - \text{Total cost of large tubs} = 48 - 18 = 30
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the cost of each small tub.
Alison bought 6 small tubs, and the total cost for these small tubs is $30. To find the cost of each small tub, we divide the total cost of the small tubs by the number of small tubs:

\[
\text{Cost per small tub} = \frac{\text{Total cost of small tubs}}{\text{Number of small tubs}} = \frac{30}{6} = 5
\]

### Conclusion:
Each small storage tub costs $5.

Therefore, the final answer is that the small tubs cost $5 each.
