==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to determine the cost of the small storage tubs that Alison bought. We know the following information:

1. Alison bought 3 large storage tubs and 6 small storage tubs.
2. The total cost for all the tubs was $48.
3. Each large tub costs $6.

Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the large tubs

Since each large tub costs $6 and Alison bought 3 large tubs, we can calculate the total cost of the large tubs as follows:

\[
\text{Total cost of large tubs} = \text{Number of large tubs} \times \text{Cost per large tub}
\]
\[
\text{Total cost of large tubs} = 3 \times 6 = 18
\]

### Step 2: Determine the remaining amount for the small tubs

Now that we know the total cost of the large tubs, we can find out how much money was spent on the small tubs. We subtract the cost of the large tubs from the total amount spent:

\[
\text{Remaining amount for small tubs} = \text{Total cost} - \text{Total cost of large tubs}
\]
\[
\text{Remaining amount for small tubs} = 48 - 18 = 30
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the cost of each small tub

Alison bought 6 small tubs for a total of $30. To find the cost of each small tub, we divide the total cost for the small tubs by the number of small tubs:

\[
\text{Cost per small tub} = \frac{\text{Remaining amount for small tubs}}{\text{Number of small tubs}}
\]
\[
\text{Cost per small tub} = \frac{30}{6} = 5
\]

### Final Answer

The cost of each small storage tub is **$5**.
