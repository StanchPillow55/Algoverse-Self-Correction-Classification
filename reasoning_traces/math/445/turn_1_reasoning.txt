==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine how much Carla spent on the two bags of mini peanut butter cups after the discount was applied. Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Determine the Original Price of One Bag:**
   Each bag originally costs $6.00.

2. **Calculate the Discount Amount:**
   The bags are on clearance with a 75% discount. To find the discount amount for one bag, we calculate 75% of $6.00.

   \[
   \text{Discount per bag} = 75\% \times 6.00 = 0.75 \times 6.00 = 4.50
   \]

3. **Calculate the Sale Price of One Bag:**
   To find the sale price of one bag, subtract the discount from the original price.

   \[
   \text{Sale price per bag} = 6.00 - 4.50 = 1.50
   \]

4. **Calculate the Total Cost for Two Bags:**
   Since Carla bought two bags, we need to multiply the sale price of one bag by 2.

   \[
   \text{Total cost for two bags} = 2 \times 1.50 = 3.00
   \]

Therefore, Carla spent a total of $3.00 on the two bags of candy.

**Final Answer:**
Carla spent $3.00 on 2 bags of mini peanut butter cups.
