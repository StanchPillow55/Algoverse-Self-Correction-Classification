Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To determine how much Carla spent on the two bags of mini peanut butter cups, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the Discounted Price of One Bag:**
   - The original price of one bag is $6.00.
   - The discount is 75% off. To find the discount amount, we calculate 75% of $6.00.
   - Convert the percentage to a decimal: 75% = 0.75.
   - Calculate the discount: 
     \[
     \text{Discount} = 0.75 \times 6.00 = 4.50
     \]
   - Subtract the discount from the original price to find the sale price:
     \[
     \text{Sale Price of One Bag} = 6.00 - 4.50 = 1.50
     \]

2. **Calculate the Total Cost for Two Bags:**
   - Since each bag costs $1.50 after the discount, for two bags, the total cost is:
     \[
     \text{Total Cost for Two Bags} = 2 \times 1.50 = 3.00
     \]

Therefore, Carla spent a total of $3.00 on the two bags of mini peanut butter cups.

**Final Answer: Carla spent $3.00 on 2 bags of candy.**
