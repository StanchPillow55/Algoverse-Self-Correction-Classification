==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine how much Carla spent on the two bags of mini peanut butter cups after applying the 75% discount.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Determine the Original Price of One Bag:**
   Each bag originally costs $6.00.

2. **Calculate the Discount Amount:**
   Since the bags are on clearance for 75% off, we need to calculate how much 75% of $6.00 is.
   
   \[
   \text{Discount per bag} = 75\% \times 6.00 = 0.75 \times 6.00
   \]

   \[
   \text{Discount per bag} = 4.50
   \]

3. **Calculate the Sale Price of One Bag:**
   Subtract the discount from the original price to find the sale price of one bag.
   
   \[
   \text{Sale price per bag} = \text{Original price} - \text{Discount per bag}
   \]

   \[
   \text{Sale price per bag} = 6.00 - 4.50 = 1.50
   \]

4. **Calculate the Total Cost for Two Bags:**
   Since Carla bought two bags, we multiply the sale price of one bag by 2.
   
   \[
   \text{Total cost for 2 bags} = 2 \times \text{Sale price per bag}
   \]

   \[
   \text{Total cost for 2 bags} = 2 \times 1.50 = 3.00
   \]

### Final Answer:

Carla spent a total of $3.00 on the two bags of mini peanut butter cups.
