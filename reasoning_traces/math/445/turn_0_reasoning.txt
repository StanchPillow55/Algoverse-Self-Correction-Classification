==================================================

To determine how much Carla spent on the 2 bags of mini peanut butter cups, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the original price of one bag**: 
   The original price of one bag is given as $6.00.

2. **Calculate the discount**: 
   The bags are 75% off. To find out how much the discount is in dollars, we calculate 75% of the original price:
   \[
   \text{Discount} = 75\% \times \text{Original Price} = 0.75 \times 6.00
   \]
   \[
   \text{Discount} = 0.75 \times 6.00 = 4.50
   \]

3. **Calculate the sale price of one bag**: 
   To find the sale price after applying the discount, we subtract the discount from the original price:
   \[
   \text{Sale Price} = \text{Original Price} - \text{Discount} = 6.00 - 4.50
   \]
   \[
   \text{Sale Price} = 1.50
   \]

4. **Calculate the total cost for 2 bags**: 
   Now that we know the sale price of one bag is $1.50, we can find the total cost for 2 bags:
   \[
   \text{Total Cost} = \text{Sale Price} \times \text{Number of Bags} = 1.50 \times 2
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total Cost} = 3.00
   \]

Thus, Carla spent a total of $3.00 on the 2 bags of mini peanut butter cups.

**Final Answer**: $3.00
