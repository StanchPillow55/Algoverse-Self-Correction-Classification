==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the distance the horse runs in 30 minutes at 32 MPH.**
2. **Determine how much hay is needed for that distance.**
3. **Calculate the total cost of the hay.**
4. **Determine how much money Michael has and how much change he has after buying the hay.**

### Step 1: Calculate the distance

The horse runs for 30 minutes at a speed of 32 miles per hour (MPH). First, we convert 30 minutes into hours:

\[
30 \text{ minutes} = \frac{30}{60} \text{ hours} = 0.5 \text{ hours}
\]

Now, we can calculate the distance:

\[
\text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 32 \text{ MPH} \times 0.5 \text{ hours} = 16 \text{ miles}
\]

### Step 2: Determine how much hay is needed

According to the problem, the horse eats \( \frac{1}{2} \) a bail of hay for every mile it runs. Therefore, for 16 miles, the amount of hay needed is:

\[
\text{Hay needed} = 16 \text{ miles} \times \frac{1}{2} \text{ bail/mile} = 8 \text{ bails of hay}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the total cost of the hay

Each bail of hay costs $3. Therefore, the total cost for 8 bails is:

\[
\text{Total cost} = 8 \text{ bails} \times 3 \text{ dollars/bail} = 24 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Step 4: Determine how much money Michael has and how much change he has

Michael has six $5 bills. Therefore, the total amount of money he has is:

\[
\text{Total money} = 6 \text{ bills} \times 5 \text{ dollars/bill} = 30 \text{ dollars}
\]

Now, we can find out how much change he has after buying the hay:

\[
\text{Change} = \text{Total money} - \text{Total cost} = 30 \text{ dollars} - 24 \text{ dollars} = 6 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Final Answer

Michael has **$6** in change after he buys the hay.
