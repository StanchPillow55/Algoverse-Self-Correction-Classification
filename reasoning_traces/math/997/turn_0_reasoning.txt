To determine how much Walter's lawyer is going to contribute, we need to follow the steps outlined in the problem and calculate the total amount donated by others before the lawyer's contribution.

1. **Calculate the total amount collected from neighbors and online fund:**
   - Walter collects $500 from his neighbors.
   - Walter collects $1500 from the online fund.

   We can find the total amount collected from these two sources by adding them together:

   \[
   \text{Total from neighbors and online fund} = 500 + 1500 = 2000
   \]

2. **Add the contribution from Walter's friend:**
   - Walter's friend gives him $200.

   Now, we add this amount to the total collected so far:

   \[
   \text{Total amount before lawyer's contribution} = 2000 + 200 = 2200
   \]

3. **Calculate the lawyer's contribution:**
   - Walter's lawyer offers to donate three times as much as everyone else has donated. 

   Since the total amount collected from neighbors, the online fund, and Walter's friend is $2200, we can calculate the lawyer's contribution as follows:

   \[
   \text{Lawyer's contribution} = 3 \times \text{Total amount before lawyer's contribution} = 3 \times 2200
   \]

   Now, we perform the multiplication:

   \[
   \text{Lawyer's contribution} = 3 \times 2200 = 6600
   \]

4. **Final answer:**
   Therefore, Walter's lawyer is going to contribute **$6600**.

In conclusion, the total amount that Walter's lawyer will contribute is **$6600**.
