To determine how much Alicia spends on dry-cleaning in 5 weeks, we first need to calculate her weekly dry-cleaning costs based on the number of items she sends to the cleaners and their respective prices.

1. **Identify the number of items and their costs:**
   - Blouses: 5 blouses at $5.00 each
   - Pants: 2 pairs at $8.00 each
   - Skirt: 1 skirt at $6.00 each

2. **Calculate the cost for each type of clothing:**
   - **Cost for blouses:**
     \[
     \text{Cost for blouses} = \text{Number of blouses} \times \text{Cost per blouse} = 5 \times 5.00 = 25.00
     \]

   - **Cost for pants:**
     \[
     \text{Cost for pants} = \text{Number of pants} \times \text{Cost per pair of pants} = 2 \times 8.00 = 16.00
     \]

   - **Cost for skirt:**
     \[
     \text{Cost for skirt} = \text{Number of skirts} \times \text{Cost per skirt} = 1 \times 6.00 = 6.00
     \]

3. **Calculate the total weekly cost:**
   Now, we add up the costs for all the items:
   \[
   \text{Total weekly cost} = \text{Cost for blouses} + \text{Cost for pants} + \text{Cost for skirt}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total weekly cost} = 25.00 + 16.00 + 6.00 = 47.00
   \]

4. **Calculate the total cost for 5 weeks:**
   To find out how much Alicia spends on dry-cleaning in 5 weeks, we multiply the total weekly cost by the number of weeks:
   \[
   \text{Total cost for 5 weeks} = \text{Total weekly cost} \times 5
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total cost for 5 weeks} = 47.00 \times 5 = 235.00
   \]

5. **Final answer:**
   Therefore, the total amount Alicia spends on dry-cleaning in 5 weeks is:
   \[
   \boxed{235.00}
   \]
