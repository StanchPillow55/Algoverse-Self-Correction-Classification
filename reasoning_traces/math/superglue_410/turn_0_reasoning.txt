==================================================

To solve the problem, I need more specific information about "Sample reasoning question 410." Since the question is not provided, I'll guide you through a general approach to solving math problems that involve reasoning. If you have a specific problem in mind, please provide the details, and I'll be happy to assist you with that.

### General Approach to Solving Math Problems:

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - Read the problem carefully.
   - Identify what is being asked.
   - Determine what information is given and what needs to be found.

2. **Devise a Plan:**
   - Think about the strategies that could be used to solve the problem. This could include drawing a diagram, creating an equation, or breaking the problem into smaller parts.

3. **Carry Out the Plan:**
   - Execute the steps you have planned.
   - Perform calculations carefully and keep track of your work.
   - If one approach doesnâ€™t work, try another strategy.

4. **Review/Check Your Work:**
   - Once you have a solution, check your work to ensure it is correct.
   - Verify that your solution makes sense in the context of the problem.
   - Consider whether there is another way to arrive at the solution or if there is a simpler solution.

5. **State the Final Answer:**
   - Clearly state the final answer, ensuring it answers the question posed.

### Example Problem:

Let's consider a simple example to illustrate this process:

**Problem:** A rectangle has a length that is twice its width. If the perimeter of the rectangle is 36 units, what are the dimensions of the rectangle?

**Step 1: Understand the Problem**
- We need to find the length and width of the rectangle.
- We know the perimeter is 36 units and the length is twice the width.

**Step 2: Devise a Plan**
- Use the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle: \( P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width}) \).
- Let the width be \( w \). Then the length is \( 2w \).

**Step 3: Carry Out the Plan**
- Substitute the expressions for length and width into the perimeter formula:
  \[
  36 = 2 \times (2w + w)
  \]
- Simplify and solve for \( w \):
  \[
  36 = 2 \times 3w
  \]
  \[
  36 = 6w
  \]
  \[
  w = \frac{36}{6} = 6
  \]
- Since the width \( w \) is 6, the length \( l \) is \( 2w = 12 \).

**Step 4: Review/Check Your Work**
- Check the perimeter with these dimensions:
  \[
  P = 2 \times (12 + 6) = 2 \times 18 = 36
  \]
- The calculations are correct.

**Step 5: State the Final Answer**
- The dimensions of the rectangle are: width = 6 units, length = 12 units.

If you have a specific problem or question, please provide the details, and I can offer a more tailored solution.
