==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 410" entails. Since the question is not explicitly defined, I'll create a hypothetical math problem that could be labeled as "Sample reasoning question 410" and solve it step by step.

Let's assume "Sample reasoning question 410" is the following problem:

**Problem:**
A company produces two types of widgets: Type A and Type B. The profit from each Type A widget is $5, and the profit from each Type B widget is $8. The company can produce a maximum of 100 widgets per day due to resource constraints. Additionally, the company has a contract that requires it to produce at least 20 Type A widgets per day. How many of each type of widget should the company produce to maximize its profit?

**Solution:**

To solve this problem, we need to set up a system of equations and inequalities based on the given constraints and then find the optimal solution.

1. **Define the Variables:**
   - Let \( x \) be the number of Type A widgets produced per day.
   - Let \( y \) be the number of Type B widgets produced per day.

2. **Objective Function:**
   - The profit function \( P \) is given by:
     \[
     P = 5x + 8y
     \]
   - We want to maximize \( P \).

3. **Constraints:**
   - The company can produce a maximum of 100 widgets per day:
     \[
     x + y \leq 100
     \]
   - The company must produce at least 20 Type A widgets per day:
     \[
     x \geq 20
     \]
   - Non-negativity constraints (since negative production is not possible):
     \[
     x \geq 0, \quad y \geq 0
     \]

4. **Graphical Solution:**
   - We will graph the constraints on the xy-plane and find the feasible region.
   - The line \( x + y = 100 \) intersects the axes at \( (100, 0) \) and \( (0, 100) \).
   - The line \( x = 20 \) is a vertical line passing through \( (20, 0) \).

5. **Feasible Region:**
   - The feasible region is bounded by the lines \( x + y = 100 \), \( x = 20 \), \( x = 0 \), and \( y = 0 \).
   - The vertices of the feasible region are \( (20, 0) \), \( (20, 80) \), and \( (100, 0) \).

6. **Evaluate the Objective Function at Each Vertex:**
   - At \( (20, 0) \): \( P = 5(20) + 8(0) = 100 \)
   - At \( (20, 80) \): \( P = 5(20) + 8(80) = 100 + 640 = 740 \)
   - At \( (100, 0) \): \( P = 5(100) + 8(0) = 500 \)

7. **Conclusion:**
   - The maximum profit is \( 740 \) dollars, which occurs when the company produces 20 Type A widgets and 80 Type B widgets.

**Final Answer:**
To maximize profit, the company should produce 20 Type A widgets and 80 Type B widgets per day, resulting in a maximum profit of $740.
