==================================================

To solve the problem effectively, I need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 410" refers to. Since the problem statement is not explicitly provided, I'll demonstrate a general approach to solving a reasoning-based math problem. I'll assume it involves logical reasoning and mathematical calculations.

Let's consider a hypothetical reasoning problem:

**Problem:**
A farmer has a certain number of chickens and cows. Together, they have 56 heads and 152 legs. How many chickens and how many cows does the farmer have?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Identify Variables:**
   - Let \( C \) represent the number of chickens.
   - Let \( W \) represent the number of cows.

2. **Set Up Equations:**
   - Each chicken has 1 head and 2 legs.
   - Each cow has 1 head and 4 legs.
   - Total number of heads: \( C + W = 56 \)
   - Total number of legs: \( 2C + 4W = 152 \)

3. **Solve the System of Equations:**
   - From the first equation: \( C + W = 56 \)
   - Solve for one variable: \( C = 56 - W \)

4. **Substitute into the Second Equation:**
   - Substitute \( C = 56 - W \) into \( 2C + 4W = 152 \):
   \[
   2(56 - W) + 4W = 152
   \]
   \[
   112 - 2W + 4W = 152
   \]
   \[
   112 + 2W = 152
   \]

5. **Solve for W:**
   \[
   2W = 152 - 112
   \]
   \[
   2W = 40
   \]
   \[
   W = 20
   \]

6. **Find C Using the Value of W:**
   - Substitute \( W = 20 \) back into \( C = 56 - W \):
   \[
   C = 56 - 20
   \]
   \[
   C = 36
   \]

7. **Verify the Solution:**
   - Check the total number of legs:
   \[
   2C + 4W = 2(36) + 4(20) = 72 + 80 = 152
   \]
   - The calculations are correct.

**Final Answer:**
The farmer has 36 chickens and 20 cows.

This approach demonstrates how to solve a reasoning problem involving systems of equations. If "Sample reasoning question 410" is different, please provide more details or context for a specific solution.
