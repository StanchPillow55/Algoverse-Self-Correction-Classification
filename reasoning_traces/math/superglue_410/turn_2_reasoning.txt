==================================================

To solve this problem, let's first clarify what "Sample reasoning question 410" might entail. Since the problem statement is not explicitly given, I'll assume it's a hypothetical math problem that requires logical reasoning and problem-solving skills. Let's create a sample problem and solve it step by step.

**Sample Problem:**

A company produces two types of widgets: Type A and Type B. The production cost for Type A is $5 per widget, and for Type B, it is $8 per widget. The company sells Type A widgets for $10 each and Type B widgets for $15 each. Last month, the company produced a total of 1,000 widgets and made a total profit of $6,000. How many of each type of widget did the company produce?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( x \) be the number of Type A widgets produced.
   - Let \( y \) be the number of Type B widgets produced.

2. **Set Up Equations:**
   - The total number of widgets produced is 1,000:
     \[
     x + y = 1000
     \]

   - The profit from selling the widgets is calculated as the difference between the selling price and the production cost. The profit for Type A is \( (10 - 5) = 5 \) dollars per widget, and for Type B, it is \( (15 - 8) = 7 \) dollars per widget. The total profit is $6,000:
     \[
     5x + 7y = 6000
     \]

3. **Solve the System of Equations:**

   We have the following system of equations:
   \[
   \begin{align*}
   x + y &= 1000 \quad \text{(Equation 1)} \\
   5x + 7y &= 6000 \quad \text{(Equation 2)}
   \end{align*}
   \]

   - From Equation 1, express \( y \) in terms of \( x \):
     \[
     y = 1000 - x
     \]

   - Substitute \( y = 1000 - x \) into Equation 2:
     \[
     5x + 7(1000 - x) = 6000
     \]

   - Simplify and solve for \( x \):
     \[
     5x + 7000 - 7x = 6000
     \]
     \[
     -2x + 7000 = 6000
     \]
     \[
     -2x = 6000 - 7000
     \]
     \[
     -2x = -1000
     \]
     \[
     x = 500
     \]

   - Substitute \( x = 500 \) back into the expression for \( y \):
     \[
     y = 1000 - 500 = 500
     \]

4. **Verify the Solution:**

   - Check the total number of widgets:
     \[
     x + y = 500 + 500 = 1000
     \]

   - Check the total profit:
     \[
     5x + 7y = 5(500) + 7(500) = 2500 + 3500 = 6000
     \]

   Both conditions are satisfied, confirming the solution is correct.

**Final Answer:**

The company produced 500 Type A widgets and 500 Type B widgets.
