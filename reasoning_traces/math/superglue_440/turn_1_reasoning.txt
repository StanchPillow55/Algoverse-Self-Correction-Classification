==================================================

To solve the problem, we first need to understand what "Sample reasoning question 440" refers to. Since the problem statement is not clear, I'll assume it is a placeholder for a specific math problem. Let's create a hypothetical math problem and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**

A company produces two types of widgets: A and B. Each widget A requires 2 hours of labor and 3 units of material, while each widget B requires 1 hour of labor and 4 units of material. The company has a total of 100 hours of labor and 120 units of material available. The profit from each widget A is $5, and from each widget B is $4. How many of each type of widget should the company produce to maximize profit?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( x \) be the number of widget A produced.
   - Let \( y \) be the number of widget B produced.

2. **Set Up Constraints:**
   - Labor Constraint: \( 2x + y \leq 100 \) (since each A requires 2 hours and each B requires 1 hour)
   - Material Constraint: \( 3x + 4y \leq 120 \) (since each A requires 3 units and each B requires 4 units)
   - Non-negativity Constraints: \( x \geq 0 \), \( y \geq 0 \)

3. **Objective Function:**
   - Maximize Profit: \( P = 5x + 4y \)

4. **Graph the Constraints:**
   - Plot the line \( 2x + y = 100 \).
   - Plot the line \( 3x + 4y = 120 \).
   - Identify the feasible region that satisfies all constraints.

5. **Find Corner Points:**
   - Solve for intersections of the lines and axes:
     - Intersection of \( 2x + y = 100 \) and \( 3x + 4y = 120 \):
       \[
       2x + y = 100 \quad \text{(1)}
       \]
       \[
       3x + 4y = 120 \quad \text{(2)}
       \]
       Multiply (1) by 4:
       \[
       8x + 4y = 400
       \]
       Subtract (2) from this:
       \[
       8x + 4y - 3x - 4y = 400 - 120
       \]
       \[
       5x = 280 \implies x = 56
       \]
       Substitute \( x = 56 \) into (1):
       \[
       2(56) + y = 100 \implies 112 + y = 100 \implies y = -12
       \]
       Since \( y \) cannot be negative, this point is not feasible.

     - Intersection with axes:
       - \( x = 0 \): \( y = 100 \) from \( 2x + y = 100 \)
       - \( y = 0 \): \( x = 50 \) from \( 2x + y = 100 \)
       - \( x = 0 \): \( y = 30 \) from \( 3x + 4y = 120 \)
       - \( y = 0 \): \( x = 40 \) from \( 3x + 4y = 120 \)

6. **Evaluate Objective Function at Feasible Points:**
   - \( (0, 30) \): \( P = 5(0) + 4(30) = 120 \)
   - \( (50, 0) \): \( P = 5(50) + 4(0) = 250 \)
   - \( (40, 0) \): \( P = 5(40) + 4(0) = 200 \)

7. **Determine Maximum Profit:**
   - The maximum profit is $250 at the point \( (50, 0) \).

**Final Answer:**
The company should produce 50 widgets of type A and 0 widgets of type B to maximize profit, resulting in a maximum profit of $250.
