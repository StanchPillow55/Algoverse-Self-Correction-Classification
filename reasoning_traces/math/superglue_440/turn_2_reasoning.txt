==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 440" refers to. Since the problem statement is not clear, I'll assume it's a placeholder for a mathematical problem. Let's create a hypothetical math problem and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**
A company produces two types of widgets: Type A and Type B. The company can produce a maximum of 100 widgets per day. The profit from selling one Type A widget is $3, and the profit from selling one Type B widget is $5. The company wants to maximize its profit, but it must produce at least 20 Type A widgets and at least 10 Type B widgets each day. How many of each type of widget should the company produce to maximize its profit?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( x \) be the number of Type A widgets produced.
   - Let \( y \) be the number of Type B widgets produced.

2. **Set Up the Constraints:**
   - The total number of widgets produced cannot exceed 100:
     \[
     x + y \leq 100
     \]
   - At least 20 Type A widgets must be produced:
     \[
     x \geq 20
     \]
   - At least 10 Type B widgets must be produced:
     \[
     y \geq 10
     \]

3. **Objective Function:**
   - The profit function \( P \) is given by:
     \[
     P = 3x + 5y
     \]
   - We want to maximize \( P \).

4. **Graph the Constraints:**
   - Plot the line \( x + y = 100 \).
   - Shade the region below this line (since \( x + y \leq 100 \)).
   - Plot the vertical line \( x = 20 \) and shade to the right.
   - Plot the horizontal line \( y = 10 \) and shade above.

5. **Identify the Feasible Region:**
   - The feasible region is the intersection of all shaded areas, bounded by the lines \( x = 20 \), \( y = 10 \), and \( x + y = 100 \).

6. **Find the Vertices of the Feasible Region:**
   - The vertices are points where the boundary lines intersect:
     - Intersection of \( x = 20 \) and \( y = 10 \): \( (20, 10) \)
     - Intersection of \( x = 20 \) and \( x + y = 100 \): \( (20, 80) \)
     - Intersection of \( y = 10 \) and \( x + y = 100 \): \( (90, 10) \)

7. **Evaluate the Objective Function at Each Vertex:**
   - \( P(20, 10) = 3(20) + 5(10) = 60 + 50 = 110 \)
   - \( P(20, 80) = 3(20) + 5(80) = 60 + 400 = 460 \)
   - \( P(90, 10) = 3(90) + 5(10) = 270 + 50 = 320 \)

8. **Determine the Maximum Profit:**
   - The maximum profit occurs at the vertex \( (20, 80) \) with a profit of $460.

**Final Answer:**
To maximize profit, the company should produce 20 Type A widgets and 80 Type B widgets per day, resulting in a maximum profit of $460.
