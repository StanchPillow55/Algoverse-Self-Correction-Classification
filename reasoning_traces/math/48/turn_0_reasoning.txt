Dataset Type: math
==================================================

Let's denote the number of digits Carlos memorized as C. According to the problem, Mina memorized six times as many digits as Carlos, so we can write this as:

Mina = 6C

We know from the problem that Mina memorized 24 digits, so we can substitute this into the equation:

24 = 6C

To solve for C, we divide both sides of the equation by 6:

C = 24 / 6 = 4

So, Carlos memorized 4 digits of pi.

The problem also tells us that Sam memorized six more digits of pi than Carlos. So, we can write this as:

Sam = C + 6

Substituting the value of C we found earlier:

Sam = 4 + 6 = 10

So, Sam memorized 10 digits of pi.
