Question ID: 48
Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to define some variables based on the information given.

Let \( C \) represent the number of digits of pi that Carlos memorized.

According to the problem:
1. Sam memorized six more digits than Carlos. Therefore, we can express the number of digits Sam memorized as:
   \[
   S = C + 6
   \]
   where \( S \) is the number of digits Sam memorized.

2. Mina memorized six times as many digits as Carlos. The number of digits Mina memorized can be expressed as:
   \[
   M = 6C
   \]
   where \( M \) is the number of digits Mina memorized.

3. We are given that Mina memorized 24 digits of pi. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
   \[
   6C = 24
   \]

Now, we will solve for \( C \):
\[
C = \frac{24}{6} = 4
\]

Now that we know Carlos memorized 4 digits of pi, we can find out how many digits Sam memorized using the equation we established earlier:
\[
S = C + 6 = 4 + 6 = 10
\]

Thus, Sam memorized 10 digits of pi.

To summarize:
- Carlos memorized \( C = 4 \) digits.
- Sam memorized \( S = 10 \) digits.
- Mina memorized \( M = 24 \) digits.

Finally, the answer to the question is:
\[
\boxed{10}
\]
