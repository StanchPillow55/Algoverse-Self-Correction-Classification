==================================================

To determine how many skeins of wool Martha needs to buy for her 3 grandchildren, we will first calculate the total amount of wool required for one child and then multiply that by the number of grandchildren.

### Step 1: Calculate the wool needed for one child

1. **Hat**: 
   - Wool needed = 2 skeins

2. **Scarf**: 
   - Wool needed = 4 skeins

3. **Sweater**: 
   - Wool needed = 12 skeins

4. **Mittens**: 
   - Wool needed = 1 skein

5. **Socks**: 
   - Wool needed = 2 skeins

Now, we will sum these amounts to find the total wool needed for one child:

\[
\text{Total wool for one child} = \text{Hat} + \text{Scarf} + \text{Sweater} + \text{Mittens} + \text{Socks}
\]

\[
\text{Total wool for one child} = 2 + 4 + 12 + 1 + 2
\]

Calculating this step-by-step:

- \(2 + 4 = 6\)
- \(6 + 12 = 18\)
- \(18 + 1 = 19\)
- \(19 + 2 = 21\)

Thus, the total wool needed for one child is **21 skeins**.

### Step 2: Calculate the wool needed for three children

Since Martha has 3 grandchildren, we need to multiply the total wool needed for one child by 3:

\[
\text{Total wool for three children} = 21 \times 3
\]

Calculating this:

\[
21 \times 3 = 63
\]

### Final Answer

Martha will need to buy a total of **63 skeins of wool** to make the winter wear for her 3 grandchildren.
