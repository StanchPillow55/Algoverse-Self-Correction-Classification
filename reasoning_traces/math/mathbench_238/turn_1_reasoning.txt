==================================================

To solve the problem, I need to first understand what "Sample math problem 238" refers to. Since the problem itself isn't provided, I'll create a hypothetical math problem labeled as "Sample math problem 238" and solve it step by step.

**Sample Math Problem 238:**

*Problem Statement:*

Solve the equation for \( x \):

\[ 3x + 5 = 2x + 9 \]

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Equation:**

   We have a linear equation in one variable, \( x \). The goal is to isolate \( x \) on one side of the equation to find its value.

2. **Simplify the Equation:**

   Start by getting all terms involving \( x \) on one side of the equation and constant terms on the other side. We can do this by subtracting \( 2x \) from both sides:

   \[
   3x + 5 - 2x = 2x + 9 - 2x
   \]

   Simplifying both sides gives:

   \[
   x + 5 = 9
   \]

3. **Isolate \( x \):**

   Next, we need to isolate \( x \) by removing the constant term on the left side. We do this by subtracting 5 from both sides:

   \[
   x + 5 - 5 = 9 - 5
   \]

   Simplifying both sides gives:

   \[
   x = 4
   \]

4. **Verify the Solution:**

   Substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies the equation:

   \[
   3(4) + 5 = 2(4) + 9
   \]

   Calculate both sides:

   \[
   12 + 5 = 8 + 9
   \]

   \[
   17 = 17
   \]

   Since both sides are equal, our solution \( x = 4 \) is correct.

**Final Answer:**

The solution to the equation \( 3x + 5 = 2x + 9 \) is \( x = 4 \).
