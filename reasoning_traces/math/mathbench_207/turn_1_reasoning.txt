==================================================

To solve the problem, we first need to understand what "Sample math problem 207" refers to. Since the problem itself is not explicitly stated, I'll assume a generic math problem and demonstrate a step-by-step approach to solving it. Let's assume "Sample math problem 207" is a typical algebra problem. Here's a hypothetical problem and its solution:

**Problem:** Solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).

**Step 1: Understand the Problem**

We need to find the value of \( x \) that makes the equation true. The equation given is a linear equation in one variable.

**Step 2: Isolate the Variable**

To solve for \( x \), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We start by eliminating the constant term on the left side of the equation.

The equation is:
\[ 2x + 3 = 11 \]

Subtract 3 from both sides to get:
\[ 2x + 3 - 3 = 11 - 3 \]
\[ 2x = 8 \]

**Step 3: Solve for \( x \)**

Now, we need to solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides of the equation by 2:
\[ \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{8}{2} \]
\[ x = 4 \]

**Step 4: Verify the Solution**

To ensure our solution is correct, we substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation:
\[ 2(4) + 3 = 11 \]
\[ 8 + 3 = 11 \]
\[ 11 = 11 \]

Since both sides of the equation are equal, our solution is verified.

**Final Answer:**

The solution to the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \) is \( x = 4 \).

This approach demonstrates how to solve a simple linear equation by isolating the variable and verifying the solution. If "Sample math problem 207" refers to a different problem, please provide the specific details, and I can solve that problem accordingly.
