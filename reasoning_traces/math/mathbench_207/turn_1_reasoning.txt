==================================================

To solve "Sample math problem 207," we need to first understand what the problem is asking. Since the problem statement is not provided, I'll create a hypothetical math problem labeled as "Sample math problem 207" and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem 207:**

*Calculate the area of a triangle with a base of 10 units and a height of 5 units.*

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Formula:**
   The area \( A \) of a triangle can be calculated using the formula:
   \[
   A = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height}
   \]

2. **Identify the Given Values:**
   - Base (\( b \)) = 10 units
   - Height (\( h \)) = 5 units

3. **Substitute the Values into the Formula:**
   \[
   A = \frac{1}{2} \times 10 \times 5
   \]

4. **Perform the Multiplication:**
   - First, multiply the base and the height:
     \[
     10 \times 5 = 50
     \]
   - Then, multiply by \(\frac{1}{2}\):
     \[
     \frac{1}{2} \times 50 = 25
     \]

5. **Calculate the Area:**
   The area of the triangle is 25 square units.

6. **Final Answer:**
   The area of the triangle is 25 square units.

This solution demonstrates the process of calculating the area of a triangle using the given base and height. If "Sample math problem 207" refers to a different problem, please provide the specific details, and I will solve it accordingly.
