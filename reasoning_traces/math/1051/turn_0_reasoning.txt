To determine how many gallons of water Ingrid drinks in 30 days, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of cups of water Ingrid drinks in 30 days.**
   - Ingrid drinks 8 cups of water each day.
   - Over 30 days, the total amount of water she drinks can be calculated as follows:
     \[
     \text{Total cups in 30 days} = \text{Cups per day} \times \text{Number of days}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total cups in 30 days} = 8 \, \text{cups/day} \times 30 \, \text{days} = 240 \, \text{cups}
     \]

2. **Convert cups to gallons.**
   - We know that there are 16 cups in a gallon.
   - To find out how many gallons are in 240 cups, we can use the following formula:
     \[
     \text{Total gallons} = \frac{\text{Total cups}}{\text{Cups per gallon}}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total gallons} = \frac{240 \, \text{cups}}{16 \, \text{cups/gallon}} = 15 \, \text{gallons}
     \]

3. **Final answer.**
   - Therefore, the total amount of water Ingrid drinks in 30 days is:
     \[
     \boxed{15} \, \text{gallons}
     \]
