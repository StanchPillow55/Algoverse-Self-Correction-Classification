==================================================

It seems like the problem statement "Sample math problem 124" is not providing specific details or numbers to work with. However, I can guide you through a generic approach to solving a math problem, assuming it involves basic arithmetic or algebra. If you have a specific problem or more details, please provide them. For now, I'll create a sample math problem and solve it step-by-step.

### Sample Math Problem:

**Problem:** Solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We are given a linear equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).
   - Our goal is to solve for the variable \( x \).

2. **Isolate the Variable:**
   - To solve for \( x \), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation.
   - Start by eliminating the constant term on the left side. We do this by subtracting 3 from both sides of the equation.

   \[
   2x + 3 - 3 = 11 - 3
   \]

   Simplifying both sides gives:

   \[
   2x = 8
   \]

3. **Solve for \( x \):**
   - Now, we need to solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides of the equation by 2.

   \[
   \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{8}{2}
   \]

   Simplifying both sides gives:

   \[
   x = 4
   \]

4. **Verify the Solution:**
   - Substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies the equation.

   \[
   2(4) + 3 = 11
   \]

   Simplifying the left side:

   \[
   8 + 3 = 11
   \]

   Since both sides of the equation are equal, our solution is verified.

### Final Answer:

The solution to the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \) is \( x = 4 \).

If you have a specific problem labeled "Sample math problem 124," please provide the details, and I will be happy to solve it for you.
