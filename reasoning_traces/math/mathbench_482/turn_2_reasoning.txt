Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample math problem 482" refers to. Since the problem itself is not provided, I'll assume a hypothetical math problem with the number 482 involved. Let's create a problem involving the number 482 and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**
Calculate the sum of the digits of the number 482, then multiply the result by 3. What is the final result?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Identify the digits of the number 482:**
   - The number 482 consists of the digits 4, 8, and 2.

2. **Calculate the sum of the digits:**
   - Add the digits together: \(4 + 8 + 2\).

   \[
   4 + 8 = 12
   \]
   \[
   12 + 2 = 14
   \]

   So, the sum of the digits is 14.

3. **Multiply the sum by 3:**
   - Take the sum of the digits (14) and multiply it by 3.

   \[
   14 \times 3 = 42
   \]

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The final result after multiplying the sum of the digits by 3 is 42.

Therefore, the final answer to the hypothetical problem is 42.
