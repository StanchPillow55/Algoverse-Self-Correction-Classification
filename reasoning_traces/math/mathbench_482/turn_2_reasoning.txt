==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 482," we need to first understand what the problem is asking. However, the problem statement "Sample math problem 482" is not specific, and without additional context or details, it's impossible to determine what the problem entails.

To proceed, let's assume that "Sample math problem 482" is a placeholder for a specific math problem. Since no details are provided, I'll create a hypothetical math problem and solve it step-by-step. Let's assume the problem is as follows:

**Hypothetical Problem:**
Calculate the sum of all even numbers between 1 and 100.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Identify the Even Numbers:**
   Even numbers between 1 and 100 are numbers like 2, 4, 6, ..., 100. These numbers can be represented as an arithmetic sequence where the first term \( a_1 = 2 \) and the common difference \( d = 2 \).

2. **Determine the Number of Terms:**
   To find the number of terms in this sequence, we use the formula for the \( n \)-th term of an arithmetic sequence:
   \[
   a_n = a_1 + (n-1) \cdot d
   \]
   Set \( a_n = 100 \) (the last term), \( a_1 = 2 \), and \( d = 2 \):
   \[
   100 = 2 + (n-1) \cdot 2
   \]
   \[
   100 = 2 + 2n - 2
   \]
   \[
   100 = 2n
   \]
   \[
   n = 50
   \]
   So, there are 50 even numbers between 1 and 100.

3. **Calculate the Sum:**
   The sum \( S_n \) of the first \( n \) terms of an arithmetic sequence is given by:
   \[
   S_n = \frac{n}{2} \cdot (a_1 + a_n)
   \]
   Substituting the known values:
   \[
   S_{50} = \frac{50}{2} \cdot (2 + 100)
   \]
   \[
   S_{50} = 25 \cdot 102
   \]
   \[
   S_{50} = 2550
   \]

**Final Answer:**
The sum of all even numbers between 1 and 100 is 2550.

This solution demonstrates how to approach and solve a typical arithmetic sequence problem. If you have a specific "Sample math problem 482" in mind, please provide the details, and I can offer a tailored solution.
