==================================================

To solve the problem, we first need to understand what "Sample math problem 482" refers to. Since the problem itself is not provided, I'll create a hypothetical math problem labeled as "Sample math problem 482" and solve it step by step.

**Sample Math Problem 482:**

A rectangular garden has a length that is 4 meters longer than its width. The area of the garden is 96 square meters. Find the dimensions of the garden.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( w \) be the width of the garden in meters.
   - Then the length of the garden is \( w + 4 \) meters, since it is 4 meters longer than the width.

2. **Write the Equation for Area:**
   - The area \( A \) of a rectangle is given by the formula:
     \[
     A = \text{length} \times \text{width}
     \]
   - Substituting the known values, we have:
     \[
     96 = (w + 4) \times w
     \]

3. **Expand and Simplify the Equation:**
   - Expand the right side:
     \[
     96 = w^2 + 4w
     \]

4. **Rearrange the Equation:**
   - Move all terms to one side to form a quadratic equation:
     \[
     w^2 + 4w - 96 = 0
     \]

5. **Solve the Quadratic Equation:**
   - We can solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula:
     \[
     w = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
     \]
   - Here, \( a = 1 \), \( b = 4 \), and \( c = -96 \).

6. **Calculate the Discriminant:**
   - The discriminant \( \Delta \) is:
     \[
     \Delta = b^2 - 4ac = 4^2 - 4 \times 1 \times (-96) = 16 + 384 = 400
     \]

7. **Find the Roots:**
   - Since the discriminant is positive, there are two real roots:
     \[
     w = \frac{-4 \pm \sqrt{400}}{2 \times 1}
     \]
   - Calculate the square root of 400:
     \[
     \sqrt{400} = 20
     \]
   - So the roots are:
     \[
     w = \frac{-4 + 20}{2} = \frac{16}{2} = 8
     \]
     \[
     w = \frac{-4 - 20}{2} = \frac{-24}{2} = -12
     \]

8. **Select the Valid Solution:**
   - Since width cannot be negative, we take \( w = 8 \).

9. **Find the Length:**
   - The length is \( w + 4 = 8 + 4 = 12 \).

**Final Answer:**

The dimensions of the garden are 8 meters in width and 12 meters in length.
