Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, "Sample math problem 293," we need to first understand what the problem is asking. Since the problem statement is not provided, I'll assume a generic math problem and solve it step by step. Let's assume the problem is as follows:

**Problem:** Solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 2x + 5 = 13 \).

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Understand the Equation:**
   The equation given is \( 2x + 5 = 13 \). This is a simple linear equation in one variable, \( x \).

2. **Isolate the Variable:**
   To solve for \( x \), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We can do this by performing operations that will leave \( x \) alone on one side.

3. **Subtract 5 from Both Sides:**
   To eliminate the constant term on the left side, subtract 5 from both sides of the equation:
   \[
   2x + 5 - 5 = 13 - 5
   \]
   Simplifying both sides, we get:
   \[
   2x = 8
   \]

4. **Divide by 2:**
   Now, divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( x \):
   \[
   \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{8}{2}
   \]
   Simplifying, we find:
   \[
   x = 4
   \]

5. **Verify the Solution:**
   Substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies the equation:
   \[
   2(4) + 5 = 13
   \]
   Simplifying the left side:
   \[
   8 + 5 = 13
   \]
   Since both sides of the equation are equal, \( x = 4 \) is indeed the correct solution.

### Final Answer:
The solution to the equation \( 2x + 5 = 13 \) is \( x = 4 \).
