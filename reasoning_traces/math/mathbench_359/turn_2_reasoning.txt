==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample math problem 359" refers to. Since there is no specific problem statement provided, I'll assume this is a placeholder for a generic math problem. Let's create a sample math problem and solve it step by step.

**Sample Math Problem 359:**

Let's assume the problem is as follows:

"Calculate the value of \( x \) in the equation \( 3x + 5 = 20 \)."

**Step-by-step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Equation:**
   The given equation is \( 3x + 5 = 20 \). This is a linear equation in one variable, \( x \).

2. **Isolate the Variable:**
   To solve for \( x \), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We can do this by performing operations that will simplify the equation.

3. **Subtract 5 from Both Sides:**
   To remove the constant term on the left side, subtract 5 from both sides of the equation:
   \[
   3x + 5 - 5 = 20 - 5
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   3x = 15
   \]

4. **Divide by 3:**
   Now, divide both sides by 3 to solve for \( x \):
   \[
   \frac{3x}{3} = \frac{15}{3}
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   x = 5
   \]

5. **Verify the Solution:**
   Substitute \( x = 5 \) back into the original equation to verify:
   \[
   3(5) + 5 = 20
   \]
   \[
   15 + 5 = 20
   \]
   \[
   20 = 20
   \]
   The left side equals the right side, confirming that our solution is correct.

**Final Answer:**

The value of \( x \) in the equation \( 3x + 5 = 20 \) is \( x = 5 \).
