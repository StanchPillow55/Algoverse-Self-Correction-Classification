Question ID: 41
Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to find out how much Sara spent in total. 

Sara spent $50 on shoes and $200 on a dress. 

So, Sara's total spending is $50 (for shoes) + $200 (for dress) = $250.

Rachel wants to spend twice as much as what Sara spent. 

So, Rachel's budget should be 2 * Sara's total spending.

That is, Rachel's budget should be 2 * $250 = $500.

So, Rachel should budget $500 if she wants to spend twice as much as what Sara spent on the pair of shoes and dress.

Final Answer: Rachel should budget $500.
