==================================================

To determine how much Rachel should budget, we first need to calculate how much Sara spent on her pair of shoes and dress.

1. **Calculate Sara's total expenditure:**
   - Cost of shoes: $50
   - Cost of dress: $200

   To find the total amount Sara spent, we add the cost of the shoes and the dress:

   \[
   \text{Total spent by Sara} = \text{Cost of shoes} + \text{Cost of dress}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total spent by Sara} = 50 + 200 = 250
   \]

   So, Sara spent a total of $250.

2. **Determine how much Rachel wants to budget:**
   Rachel wants to spend twice as much as what Sara spent. Therefore, we need to multiply Sara's total expenditure by 2:

   \[
   \text{Amount Rachel should budget} = 2 \times \text{Total spent by Sara}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Amount Rachel should budget} = 2 \times 250 = 500
   \]

Thus, Rachel should budget **$500**.

3. **Final answer:**
   \[
   \text{Rachel should budget} = \boxed{500}
   \]
