To solve the problem, we need to determine how far Polly can stand from the dragon while still being able to hit it with the gold javelin when she is holding the sapphire gemstone.

1. **Distance Polly can throw without the gemstone**: 
   Polly can throw the gold javelin a distance of 400 feet without the gemstone.

2. **Distance Polly can throw with the gemstone**: 
   When Polly holds the sapphire gemstone, she can throw the javelin three times farther than she can without it. Therefore, we calculate the distance she can throw with the gemstone as follows:

   \[
   \text{Distance with gemstone} = 3 \times \text{Distance without gemstone} = 3 \times 400 \text{ feet} = 1200 \text{ feet}
   \]

3. **Dragon's reach**: 
   The dragon can breathe fire on anything within a distance of 1000 feet. This means that if Polly is within 1000 feet of the dragon, she is in danger from the dragon's flames.

4. **Calculating the safe distance**: 
   To find out how far outside of the dragon's reach Polly can stand while still being able to hit the dragon, we need to consider the distance she can throw the javelin with the gemstone (1200 feet) and the dragon's reach (1000 feet).

   Since Polly can throw the javelin 1200 feet, we need to find the distance from the dragon where she can still hit it. This can be calculated as follows:

   \[
   \text{Distance from the dragon} = \text{Distance she can throw with gemstone} - \text{Dragon's reach}
   \]

   Substituting the values we have:

   \[
   \text{Distance from the dragon} = 1200 \text{ feet} - 1000 \text{ feet} = 200 \text{ feet}
   \]

5. **Final answer**: 
   Therefore, when holding the sapphire gemstone, Polly can stand **200 feet outside of the reach of the dragon's flames** and still hit the dragon with the gold javelin.

Thus, the final answer is:

**200 feet**.
