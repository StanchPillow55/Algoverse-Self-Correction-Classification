==================================================

To solve a math problem effectively, it's important to follow a structured approach. However, since "Sample reasoning question 232" is not a specific math problem, I'll demonstrate how to solve a generic math problem using a step-by-step approach. Let's assume a sample problem:

**Problem:** Solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).

**Step 1: Understand the Problem**
The equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \) is a linear equation in one variable. Our goal is to find the value of \( x \) that makes this equation true.

**Step 2: Isolate the Variable**
To solve for \( x \), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We can do this by performing operations that will simplify the equation.

**Step 3: Perform Operations**
1. **Subtract 3 from both sides**: This will help to eliminate the constant term on the left side of the equation.
   \[
   2x + 3 - 3 = 11 - 3
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   2x = 8
   \]

2. **Divide both sides by 2**: This will isolate \( x \) by removing the coefficient of 2.
   \[
   \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{8}{2}
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   x = 4
   \]

**Step 4: Verify the Solution**
To ensure our solution is correct, we substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation:
\[
2(4) + 3 = 11
\]
Simplifying the left side:
\[
8 + 3 = 11
\]
Since both sides of the equation are equal, our solution \( x = 4 \) is correct.

**Final Answer**
The solution to the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \) is \( x = 4 \).
