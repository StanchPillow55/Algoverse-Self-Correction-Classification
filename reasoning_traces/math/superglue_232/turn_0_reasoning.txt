==================================================

To solve a math problem, I need a clear and specific question or problem statement to work through. The phrase "Sample reasoning question 232" does not provide enough information or context to identify the problem or its requirements. 

If you have a specific math problem or question, please provide the details, and I will be happy to work through it step by step, showing all calculations and reasoning to arrive at the final answer.
