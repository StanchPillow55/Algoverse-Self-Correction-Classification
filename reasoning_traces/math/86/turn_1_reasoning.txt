Question ID: 86
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to determine how much money Peter spent on the soda. We know he started with $2 and ended with $.50, so we subtract $.50 from $2 to find out how much he spent. 

$2.00 - $0.50 = $1.50

So, Peter spent $1.50 on soda.

Next, we need to figure out how many ounces of soda Peter was able to buy with $1.50. We know that the soda costs $.25 per ounce. To find out how many ounces he bought, we divide the total amount he spent by the cost per ounce.

$1.50 รท $0.25 = 6 ounces

So, Peter bought 6 ounces of soda.
