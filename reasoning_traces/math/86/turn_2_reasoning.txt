Question ID: 86
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we first need to determine how much money Peter spent on the soda. We know that he started with $2 and ended with $.50, so we subtract the ending amount from the starting amount to find the total spent.

$2 - $.50 = $1.50

So, Peter spent $1.50 on the soda.

Next, we need to determine how many ounces of soda Peter was able to buy with $1.50. We know that the soda costs $.25 per ounce, so we divide the total spent by the cost per ounce to find the total ounces.

$1.50 รท $.25 = 6 ounces

Therefore, Peter bought 6 ounces of soda.
