To determine how many ounces of soda Peter bought, we can follow these steps:

1. **Identify the total amount of money Peter had initially and how much he left with**:
   - Initial amount: $2.00
   - Amount left after purchase: $0.50

2. **Calculate the amount of money Peter spent on soda**:
   \[
   \text{Amount spent} = \text{Initial amount} - \text{Amount left}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Amount spent} = 2.00 - 0.50 = 1.50
   \]

3. **Determine the cost of soda per ounce**:
   - Cost per ounce of soda: $0.25

4. **Calculate the number of ounces of soda purchased**:
   To find the number of ounces, we divide the total amount spent by the cost per ounce:
   \[
   \text{Number of ounces} = \frac{\text{Amount spent}}{\text{Cost per ounce}}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Number of ounces} = \frac{1.50}{0.25}
   \]

5. **Perform the division**:
   \[
   \frac{1.50}{0.25} = 6
   \]

Thus, Peter bought **6 ounces of soda**.

**Final Answer**: Peter bought 6 ounces of soda.
