==================================================

First, we need to determine how much money Peter spent on the soda. We can do this by subtracting the amount of money he left with from the amount of money he brought with him. 

Peter brought $2 and left with $.50. 

$2.00 - $0.50 = $1.50

So, Peter spent $1.50 on soda.

Next, we need to determine how many ounces of soda Peter bought. We know that the soda costs $.25 an ounce. 

To find out how many ounces of soda Peter bought, we divide the total amount of money he spent by the cost per ounce.

$1.50 รท $0.25 = 6 ounces

So, Peter bought 6 ounces of soda.
