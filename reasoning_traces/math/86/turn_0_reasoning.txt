==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to determine how many times the alarm rang in total throughout the day based on the information given about each of the three times it went off.

1. **First Alarm Ringing**:
   - The problem states that the first time the alarm went off, it rang **4 times**.

2. **Second Alarm Ringing**:
   - The second time the alarm went off, it rang for **three times as long as the first time**. 
   - Since the first time it rang 4 times, the second time it rang:
     \[
     3 \times 4 = 12 \text{ times}
     \]

3. **Third Alarm Ringing**:
   - The third time the alarm went off, it rang for **half as long as the second time**.
   - Since the second time it rang 12 times, the third time it rang:
     \[
     \frac{12}{2} = 6 \text{ times}
     \]

4. **Total Alarm Rings**:
   - Now, we need to add the number of times the alarm rang for each of the three instances:
     \[
     \text{Total Rings} = \text{First} + \text{Second} + \text{Third}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total Rings} = 4 + 12 + 6
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total Rings} = 22
     \]

Thus, the total number of times the alarm rang in all is **22**.

Final answer: **22**.
