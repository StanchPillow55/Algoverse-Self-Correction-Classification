==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to determine how many customers Julie and Jewel process in a week, given that Julie operates the cash register twice as fast as Jewel and that Jewel processes 50 customers daily.

### Step 1: Determine Jewel's Daily Production
Jewel processes 50 customers each day.

### Step 2: Determine Julie's Daily Production
Since Julie operates twice as fast as Jewel, we can calculate her daily production as follows:

\[
\text{Julie's daily production} = 2 \times \text{Jewel's daily production}
\]
\[
\text{Julie's daily production} = 2 \times 50 = 100 \text{ customers}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate Total Daily Production
Now, we can find the total daily production for both Jewel and Julie:

\[
\text{Total daily production} = \text{Jewel's daily production} + \text{Julie's daily production}
\]
\[
\text{Total daily production} = 50 + 100 = 150 \text{ customers}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate Weekly Production
Since they work every day of the week, we need to calculate the total weekly production by multiplying the total daily production by the number of days in a week (7 days):

\[
\text{Total weekly production} = \text{Total daily production} \times 7
\]
\[
\text{Total weekly production} = 150 \times 7 = 1050 \text{ customers}
\]

### Final Answer
The total weekly production for Julie and Jewel is **1050 customers**.
