==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to determine how many customers Julie processes in a day and then calculate the total weekly production for both Julie and Jewel.

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - Jewel processes 50 customers in a day.
   - Julie operates the cash register twice as fast as Jewel.

2. **Calculating Julie's Daily Production**:
   Since Julie works twice as fast as Jewel, we can calculate how many customers Julie processes in a day:
   \[
   \text{Julie's daily production} = 2 \times \text{Jewel's daily production}
   \]
   Substituting Jewel's daily production:
   \[
   \text{Julie's daily production} = 2 \times 50 = 100 \text{ customers}
   \]

3. **Calculating Total Daily Production**:
   Now, we can find the total number of customers processed by both Julie and Jewel in one day:
   \[
   \text{Total daily production} = \text{Julie's daily production} + \text{Jewel's daily production}
   \]
   Substituting the values we calculated:
   \[
   \text{Total daily production} = 100 + 50 = 150 \text{ customers}
   \]

4. **Calculating Total Weekly Production**:
   Since they work every day of the week (7 days), we can calculate the total weekly production:
   \[
   \text{Total weekly production} = \text{Total daily production} \times 7
   \]
   Substituting the total daily production:
   \[
   \text{Total weekly production} = 150 \times 7 = 1050 \text{ customers}
   \]

5. **Final Answer**:
   The total weekly production for Julie and Jewel is:
   \[
   \boxed{1050} \text{ customers}
   \]
