Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, I need more information about "Sample math problem 463" as it is not specified in your request. However, I can guide you through a generic approach to solving math problems by outlining a step-by-step process. If you provide the specific details of the problem, I can tailor the solution to that particular problem.

### Generic Approach to Solving Math Problems

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - Read the problem carefully.
   - Identify what is being asked.
   - Determine what information is given and what needs to be found.

2. **Devise a Plan:**
   - Consider possible strategies to solve the problem (e.g., algebraic manipulation, drawing a diagram, using a formula, etc.).
   - Choose the most appropriate method based on the problem type.

3. **Carry Out the Plan:**
   - Execute the chosen strategy step by step.
   - Perform calculations carefully and check each step for accuracy.
   - Keep track of units and conversion factors if applicable.

4. **Review/Check the Solution:**
   - Verify that the solution answers the question posed.
   - Check calculations and logic for any errors.
   - Consider whether the answer is reasonable and makes sense in the context of the problem.

5. **State the Final Answer:**
   - Clearly write down the final answer, including units if necessary.
   - Ensure that the answer is presented in the required format.

### Example Problem and Solution

**Example Problem:**
Solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).

**Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We need to find the value of \( x \) that satisfies the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).

2. **Devise a Plan:**
   - We can solve this linear equation by isolating \( x \).

3. **Carry Out the Plan:**
   - Start with the equation: \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).
   - Subtract 3 from both sides to isolate the term with \( x \):
     \[
     2x + 3 - 3 = 11 - 3 \Rightarrow 2x = 8
     \]
   - Divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( x \):
     \[
     \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{8}{2} \Rightarrow x = 4
     \]

4. **Review/Check the Solution:**
   - Substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation to verify:
     \[
     2(4) + 3 = 8 + 3 = 11
     \]
   - The left-hand side equals the right-hand side, confirming the solution is correct.

5. **State the Final Answer:**
   - The solution to the equation is \( x = 4 \).
