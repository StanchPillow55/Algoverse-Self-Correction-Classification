Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we first need to understand what "Sample math problem 463" entails. Since the problem is not explicitly stated, I'll create a hypothetical math problem and solve it step by step.

Let's assume "Sample math problem 463" is the following:

**Problem:**
Solve for \( x \) in the equation:
\[ 3x + 5 = 2x + 11 \]

**Step-by-step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Equation:**
   The equation given is a linear equation in one variable, \( x \). Our goal is to isolate \( x \) on one side of the equation.

2. **Simplify the Equation:**
   Start by getting all terms involving \( x \) on one side of the equation and constant terms on the other side.

   \[
   3x + 5 = 2x + 11
   \]

   Subtract \( 2x \) from both sides to get:
   \[
   3x - 2x + 5 = 11
   \]

   Simplify the left side:
   \[
   x + 5 = 11
   \]

3. **Isolate \( x \):**
   Subtract 5 from both sides to solve for \( x \):
   \[
   x + 5 - 5 = 11 - 5
   \]

   Simplify:
   \[
   x = 6
   \]

4. **Verify the Solution:**
   Substitute \( x = 6 \) back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies the equation:
   \[
   3(6) + 5 = 2(6) + 11
   \]

   Calculate both sides:
   \[
   18 + 5 = 12 + 11
   \]

   \[
   23 = 23
   \]

   Since both sides are equal, \( x = 6 \) is indeed the correct solution.

**Final Answer:**
The solution to the equation \( 3x + 5 = 2x + 11 \) is \( x = 6 \).
