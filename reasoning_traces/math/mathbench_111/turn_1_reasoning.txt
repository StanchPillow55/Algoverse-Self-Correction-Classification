Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 111," we need to first understand what the problem is asking. However, since "Sample math problem 111" is not a specific math problem, I'll create a hypothetical problem based on the number 111 and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**
Calculate the sum of the digits of the number 111, and then multiply the result by 3. What is the final result?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Identify the digits of the number 111:**
   - The number 111 consists of three digits: 1, 1, and 1.

2. **Calculate the sum of the digits:**
   - Sum = 1 + 1 + 1
   - Sum = 3

3. **Multiply the sum by 3:**
   - Result = 3 * 3
   - Result = 9

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The final result after multiplying the sum of the digits of 111 by 3 is 9.

Therefore, the final answer to the hypothetical problem is 9.
