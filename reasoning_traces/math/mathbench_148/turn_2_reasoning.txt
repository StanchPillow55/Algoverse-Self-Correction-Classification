==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 148," I need more specific information about the problem itself. Since the problem isn't provided, I'll demonstrate how to approach a generic math problem by creating an example and solving it step-by-step.

Let's assume "Sample math problem 148" is a problem involving solving a quadratic equation. Here's an example problem:

**Problem:** Solve the quadratic equation \(2x^2 - 4x - 6 = 0\).

### Step 1: Identify the coefficients
The standard form of a quadratic equation is \(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\). For the equation \(2x^2 - 4x - 6 = 0\), the coefficients are:
- \(a = 2\)
- \(b = -4\)
- \(c = -6\)

### Step 2: Use the quadratic formula
The quadratic formula is given by:
\[
x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the discriminant
The discriminant (\(D\)) is the part under the square root in the quadratic formula: \(b^2 - 4ac\).
\[
D = (-4)^2 - 4 \times 2 \times (-6) = 16 + 48 = 64
\]

### Step 4: Determine the roots
Since the discriminant is positive (\(D = 64\)), there are two distinct real roots. Substitute the values into the quadratic formula:
\[
x = \frac{-(-4) \pm \sqrt{64}}{2 \times 2}
\]
\[
x = \frac{4 \pm 8}{4}
\]

### Step 5: Solve for the roots
Calculate the two possible values for \(x\):
1. \(x = \frac{4 + 8}{4} = \frac{12}{4} = 3\)
2. \(x = \frac{4 - 8}{4} = \frac{-4}{4} = -1\)

### Final Answer
The solutions to the quadratic equation \(2x^2 - 4x - 6 = 0\) are \(x = 3\) and \(x = -1\).

If you have a specific "Sample math problem 148" in mind, please provide the details, and I can solve that particular problem for you.
