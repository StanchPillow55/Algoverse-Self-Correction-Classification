Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we first need to understand what "Sample reasoning question 414" refers to. Since the problem statement does not provide specific details about the question, I'll assume this is a placeholder for a generic math problem. Let's create a sample math problem to solve:

**Sample Problem:**
Calculate the sum of the first 10 positive integers.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Identify the Sequence:**
   The first 10 positive integers are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.

2. **Understand the Formula:**
   The sum of the first \( n \) positive integers can be calculated using the formula:
   \[
   S = \frac{n(n + 1)}{2}
   \]
   where \( S \) is the sum and \( n \) is the number of terms.

3. **Substitute the Values:**
   Here, \( n = 10 \). Substitute 10 into the formula:
   \[
   S = \frac{10(10 + 1)}{2}
   \]

4. **Calculate the Sum:**
   \[
   S = \frac{10 \times 11}{2} = \frac{110}{2} = 55
   \]

5. **Verify by Direct Addition:**
   To ensure the formula is applied correctly, let's add the numbers directly:
   \[
   1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 10 = 55
   \]

   Breaking it down:
   \[
   (1 + 10) + (2 + 9) + (3 + 8) + (4 + 7) + (5 + 6) = 11 + 11 + 11 + 11 + 11 = 55
   \]

**Final Answer:**
The sum of the first 10 positive integers is 55.
