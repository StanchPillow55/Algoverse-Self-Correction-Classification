==================================================

To solve the problem effectively, it's important to first understand what the question is asking. However, the question provided, "Sample reasoning question 414," is not specific and lacks details about what needs to be solved. Therefore, I will demonstrate a general approach to solving a typical math problem by creating a hypothetical problem and solving it step by step.

### Hypothetical Problem:
**Question:** A farmer has a rectangular field that is 50 meters long and 30 meters wide. He wants to build a fence around the field and also divide the field into two equal smaller rectangles by adding a fence parallel to the shorter side. Calculate the total length of the fence required.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We have a rectangular field with dimensions 50 meters (length) and 30 meters (width).
   - We need to calculate the total length of the fence required to enclose the field and divide it into two equal smaller rectangles.

2. **Calculate the Perimeter of the Field:**
   - The perimeter \( P \) of a rectangle is given by the formula:
     \[
     P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width})
     \]
   - Substitute the given values:
     \[
     P = 2 \times (50 + 30) = 2 \times 80 = 160 \text{ meters}
     \]

3. **Divide the Field:**
   - To divide the field into two equal smaller rectangles, a fence parallel to the shorter side (width) is added.
   - This additional fence will be equal to the length of the field, which is 50 meters.

4. **Calculate the Total Length of the Fence:**
   - The total length of the fence required is the perimeter of the field plus the additional dividing fence:
     \[
     \text{Total Fence Length} = 160 + 50 = 210 \text{ meters}
     \]

5. **Final Answer:**
   - The total length of the fence required is **210 meters**.

By following these steps, we have calculated the total length of the fence needed to enclose and divide the field. This approach demonstrates how to break down a problem, apply relevant formulas, and logically arrive at a solution.
