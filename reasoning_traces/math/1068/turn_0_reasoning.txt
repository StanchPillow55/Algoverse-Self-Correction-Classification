To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step.

1. **Determine how many meatball sub sandwiches Sidney ordered:**
   - Sidney ordered 3 less than ten meatball sub sandwiches.
   - Ten meatball sub sandwiches is 10.
   - Therefore, Sidney ordered:
     \[
     10 - 3 = 7 \text{ meatball sub sandwiches}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total number of meatballs in Sidney's original order:**
   - Each meatball sub sandwich contains 4 meatballs.
   - Since Sidney ordered 7 sandwiches, the total number of meatballs is:
     \[
     7 \text{ sandwiches} \times 4 \text{ meatballs/sandwich} = 28 \text{ meatballs}
     \]

3. **Determine how many sandwiches Mark ate:**
   - Mark ate 4 of Sidney's meatball sub sandwiches.

4. **Calculate how many sandwiches Sidney has left after Mark ate some:**
   - Sidney originally had 7 sandwiches and Mark ate 4.
   - The number of sandwiches remaining is:
     \[
     7 - 4 = 3 \text{ sandwiches}
     \]

5. **Sidney ordered another three sub sandwiches:**
   - After Mark ate 4 sandwiches, Sidney ordered 3 more sandwiches.
   - So now, the total number of sandwiches Sidney has is:
     \[
     3 \text{ remaining sandwiches} + 3 \text{ new sandwiches} = 6 \text{ sandwiches}
     \]

6. **Calculate the total number of meatballs in the remaining sandwiches:**
   - Each of the 6 sandwiches contains 4 meatballs.
   - Therefore, the total number of meatballs in the remaining sandwiches is:
     \[
     6 \text{ sandwiches} \times 4 \text{ meatballs/sandwich} = 24 \text{ meatballs}
     \]

Finally, the total number of meatballs in the sub sandwiches that remained is:
\[
\boxed{24}
\]
