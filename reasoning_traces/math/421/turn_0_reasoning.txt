To determine how much of her savings Mrs. Wilsborough has left after buying the concert tickets, we will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total cost of the VIP tickets.**
   - Mrs. Wilsborough bought 2 VIP tickets at $100 each.
   - The total cost for the VIP tickets can be calculated as follows:
     \[
     \text{Total cost of VIP tickets} = \text{Number of VIP tickets} \times \text{Cost per VIP ticket}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total cost of VIP tickets} = 2 \times 100 = 200
     \]

2. **Calculate the total cost of the regular tickets.**
   - Mrs. Wilsborough bought 3 regular tickets at $50 each.
   - The total cost for the regular tickets can be calculated as follows:
     \[
     \text{Total cost of regular tickets} = \text{Number of regular tickets} \times \text{Cost per regular ticket}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total cost of regular tickets} = 3 \times 50 = 150
     \]

3. **Calculate the total cost of all tickets.**
   - Now, we add the total cost of the VIP tickets and the total cost of the regular tickets to find the total cost of all tickets:
     \[
     \text{Total cost of all tickets} = \text{Total cost of VIP tickets} + \text{Total cost of regular tickets}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total cost of all tickets} = 200 + 150 = 350
     \]

4. **Calculate the remaining savings after buying the tickets.**
   - Mrs. Wilsborough initially saved $500. To find out how much she has left after purchasing the tickets, we subtract the total cost of the tickets from her initial savings:
     \[
     \text{Remaining savings} = \text{Initial savings} - \text{Total cost of all tickets}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Remaining savings} = 500 - 350 = 150
     \]

Thus, after buying the tickets, Mrs. Wilsborough has $150 left from her savings.

**Final Answer: $150**
