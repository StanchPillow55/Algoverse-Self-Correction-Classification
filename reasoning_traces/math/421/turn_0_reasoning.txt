To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of the concert tickets that Mrs. Wilsborough bought and then subtract that amount from her initial savings to find out how much money she has left.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the cost of each type of ticket:**
   - VIP tickets cost $100 each.
   - Regular tickets cost $50 each.

2. **Calculate the total cost of the VIP tickets:**
   - Mrs. Wilsborough bought 2 VIP tickets.
   - The cost for 2 VIP tickets is calculated as follows:
     \[
     \text{Cost of VIP tickets} = 2 \times 100 = 200
     \]

3. **Calculate the total cost of the regular tickets:**
   - Mrs. Wilsborough bought 3 regular tickets.
   - The cost for 3 regular tickets is calculated as follows:
     \[
     \text{Cost of regular tickets} = 3 \times 50 = 150
     \]

4. **Calculate the total cost of all the tickets:**
   - Add the cost of the VIP tickets and the regular tickets:
     \[
     \text{Total cost of tickets} = 200 + 150 = 350
     \]

5. **Calculate the remaining savings:**
   - Mrs. Wilsborough initially saved $500.
   - Subtract the total cost of the tickets from her savings:
     \[
     \text{Remaining savings} = 500 - 350 = 150
     \]

Therefore, after purchasing the tickets, Mrs. Wilsborough has $150 left from her savings.

**Final Answer:**
Mrs. Wilsborough has $150 remaining after buying the concert tickets.
