To determine how many minutes of advertising are in the half-hour newscast, we first need to calculate the total duration of the newscast in minutes and then subtract the time allocated to the various segments of the news.

1. **Total Duration of the Newscast**:
   The newscast is a half-hour long. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert half an hour into minutes:
   \[
   \text{Total Duration} = \frac{1}{2} \times 60 = 30 \text{ minutes}
   \]

2. **Time Allocated to Each Segment**:
   Next, we will sum up the time allocated to each segment of the newscast:
   - National news: 12 minutes
   - International news: 5 minutes
   - Sports: 5 minutes
   - Weather forecasts: 2 minutes

   Now, we add these times together:
   \[
   \text{Total News Time} = 12 + 5 + 5 + 2
   \]

   Performing the addition step-by-step:
   - First, add the national news and international news:
     \[
     12 + 5 = 17 \text{ minutes}
     \]
   - Next, add the sports segment:
     \[
     17 + 5 = 22 \text{ minutes}
     \]
   - Finally, add the weather forecast:
     \[
     22 + 2 = 24 \text{ minutes}
     \]

   So, the total time allocated to news segments is:
   \[
   \text{Total News Time} = 24 \text{ minutes}
   \]

3. **Calculating the Time for Advertisements**:
   To find the time allocated for advertisements, we subtract the total news time from the total duration of the newscast:
   \[
   \text{Time for Advertisements} = \text{Total Duration} - \text{Total News Time}
   \]
   Substituting the values we calculated:
   \[
   \text{Time for Advertisements} = 30 - 24 = 6 \text{ minutes}
   \]

4. **Final Answer**:
   Therefore, the total time allocated for advertisements in the newscast is:
   \[
   \boxed{6} \text{ minutes}
   \]
