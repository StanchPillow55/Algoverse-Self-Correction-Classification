To solve this problem, we need to determine how many minutes of a half-hour newscast are dedicated to advertising. We are given the breakdown of the newscast into different segments: national news, international news, sports, and weather forecasts. The rest of the time is allocated to advertisements.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Understand the total time of the newscast:**
   - A half-hour newscast is 30 minutes long.

2. **Identify the time allocated to each segment:**
   - National news: 12 minutes
   - International news: 5 minutes
   - Sports: 5 minutes
   - Weather forecasts: 2 minutes

3. **Calculate the total time spent on news segments:**
   - Add the time for each segment:
     \[
     12 \text{ minutes (national news)} + 5 \text{ minutes (international news)} + 5 \text{ minutes (sports)} + 2 \text{ minutes (weather forecasts)} = 24 \text{ minutes}
     \]

4. **Determine the time left for advertisements:**
   - Subtract the total time spent on news segments from the total time of the newscast:
     \[
     30 \text{ minutes (total newscast)} - 24 \text{ minutes (news segments)} = 6 \text{ minutes}
     \]

Thus, there are 6 minutes of advertising in the newscast.

**Final Answer:**
There are 6 minutes of advertising in the newscast.
