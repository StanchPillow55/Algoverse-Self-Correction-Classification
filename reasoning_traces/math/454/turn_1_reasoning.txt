To solve the problem of how many apples Marin and Nancy eat in 30 days, we can break it down into a few simple steps.

1. **Determine the daily apple consumption for both Marin and Nancy**:
   - Marin eats 4 apples a day.
   - Nancy also eats 4 apples a day.
   - Therefore, the total number of apples they eat together in one day is:
     \[
     \text{Total daily consumption} = \text{Marin's consumption} + \text{Nancy's consumption} = 4 + 4 = 8 \text{ apples}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total apple consumption over 30 days**:
   - Since they eat 8 apples together each day, we can find out how many apples they eat in 30 days by multiplying their daily consumption by the number of days:
     \[
     \text{Total consumption in 30 days} = \text{Total daily consumption} \times \text{Number of days} = 8 \text{ apples/day} \times 30 \text{ days}
     \]

3. **Perform the multiplication**:
   \[
   8 \times 30 = 240
   \]

Thus, Marin and Nancy together eat a total of 240 apples in 30 days.

**Final Answer**: Marin and Nancy eat 240 apples in 30 days.
