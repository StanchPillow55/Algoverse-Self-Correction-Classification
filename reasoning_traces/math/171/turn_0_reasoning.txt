==================================================

To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step.

1. **Identify the number of plants per tree**: 
   James has 2 trees, and each tree has 20 plants. Therefore, the total number of plants is calculated as follows:
   \[
   \text{Total plants} = \text{Number of trees} \times \text{Plants per tree} = 2 \times 20 = 40 \text{ plants}
   \]

2. **Determine the number of seeds**: 
   Each plant has 1 seed. Since there are 40 plants, the total number of seeds is:
   \[
   \text{Total seeds} = \text{Total plants} = 40 \text{ seeds}
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of seeds James plants**: 
   James plants 60% of the seeds. To find out how many seeds he plants, we calculate 60% of 40:
   \[
   \text{Seeds planted} = 0.60 \times \text{Total seeds} = 0.60 \times 40 = 24 \text{ seeds}
   \]

4. **Determine the number of trees planted**: 
   Each seed can grow into a new tree. Therefore, if James plants 24 seeds, he will end up with 24 new trees. 

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\text{James planted} = 24 \text{ trees}
\]

In conclusion, James planted **24 trees**.
