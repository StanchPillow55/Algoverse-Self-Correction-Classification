To find the total number of legs that Jake sees in the Museum of Entomology, we will calculate the number of legs for each type of creature separately and then sum them up.

1. **Calculate the total number of legs from spiders:**
   - Jake sees 80 spiders.
   - Each spider has 8 legs.
   - Therefore, the total number of legs from spiders can be calculated as follows:
     \[
     \text{Total legs from spiders} = \text{Number of spiders} \times \text{Legs per spider} = 80 \times 8
     \]
     \[
     80 \times 8 = 640
     \]

2. **Calculate the total number of legs from insects:**
   - Jake sees 90 insects.
   - Each insect has 6 legs.
   - Therefore, the total number of legs from insects can be calculated as follows:
     \[
     \text{Total legs from insects} = \text{Number of insects} \times \text{Legs per insect} = 90 \times 6
     \]
     \[
     90 \times 6 = 540
     \]

3. **Calculate the total number of legs from rare mutant invertebrates:**
   - Jake sees 3 rare mutant invertebrates.
   - Each rare mutant invertebrate has 10 legs.
   - Therefore, the total number of legs from rare mutant invertebrates can be calculated as follows:
     \[
     \text{Total legs from rare mutant invertebrates} = \text{Number of invertebrates} \times \text{Legs per invertebrate} = 3 \times 10
     \]
     \[
     3 \times 10 = 30
     \]

4. **Sum all the legs together:**
   - Now we will add the total legs from spiders, insects, and rare mutant invertebrates:
     \[
     \text{Total legs} = \text{Total legs from spiders} + \text{Total legs from insects} + \text{Total legs from rare mutant invertebrates}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total legs} = 640 + 540 + 30
     \]
     \[
     640 + 540 = 1180
     \]
     \[
     1180 + 30 = 1210
     \]

Thus, the total number of legs that Jake sees in the museum is **1210**.

Final answer: **1210** legs.
