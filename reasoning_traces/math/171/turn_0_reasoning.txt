==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the total number of plants James has from his trees.**

   James has 2 trees, and each tree has 20 plants. Therefore, the total number of plants is calculated as follows:

   \[
   \text{Total number of plants} = 2 \times 20 = 40
   \]

2. **Determine the total number of seeds James collects.**

   According to the problem, each plant has 1 seed. Therefore, the total number of seeds is equal to the total number of plants:

   \[
   \text{Total number of seeds} = 40
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of seeds James plants.**

   James plants 60% of the seeds he collects. To find out how many seeds he plants, we calculate 60% of the total number of seeds:

   \[
   \text{Number of seeds planted} = 0.60 \times 40 = 24
   \]

4. **Determine how many trees James planted.**

   Since each seed grows into one tree, the number of seeds planted is equal to the number of trees James planted:

   \[
   \text{Number of trees planted} = 24
   \]

Therefore, the final answer is that James planted 24 trees.
