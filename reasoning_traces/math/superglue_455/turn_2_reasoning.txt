==================================================

To solve the problem, let's first clarify what "Sample reasoning question 455" might entail. Since the problem statement is not explicitly provided, I'll create a hypothetical math problem and solve it step by step. Let's assume the problem is as follows:

**Problem:**  
A company produces two types of widgets: A and B. The production cost for widget A is $5 per unit, and for widget B, it is $8 per unit. The company sells widget A for $10 per unit and widget B for $15 per unit. The company has a production budget of $800 and wants to maximize its profit. How many units of each widget should the company produce to maximize profit, assuming all produced widgets are sold?

**Solution:**

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( x \) be the number of widget A produced.
   - Let \( y \) be the number of widget B produced.

2. **Cost Constraints:**
   - The cost to produce \( x \) units of widget A is \( 5x \).
   - The cost to produce \( y \) units of widget B is \( 8y \).
   - The total production cost should not exceed $800:
     \[
     5x + 8y \leq 800
     \]

3. **Profit Calculation:**
   - The profit from selling widget A is \( (10 - 5)x = 5x \).
   - The profit from selling widget B is \( (15 - 8)y = 7y \).
   - Total profit \( P \) is given by:
     \[
     P = 5x + 7y
     \]

4. **Objective:**
   - Maximize \( P = 5x + 7y \) subject to the constraint \( 5x + 8y \leq 800 \).

5. **Graphical Solution:**
   - Plot the line \( 5x + 8y = 800 \) on a graph.
   - The intercepts are:
     - \( x \)-intercept: Set \( y = 0 \), then \( 5x = 800 \) gives \( x = 160 \).
     - \( y \)-intercept: Set \( x = 0 \), then \( 8y = 800 \) gives \( y = 100 \).
   - The feasible region is the area under and including the line \( 5x + 8y = 800 \) in the first quadrant.

6. **Evaluate Profit at Vertices:**
   - Check the profit at the intercepts and the origin:
     - At \( (0, 0) \): \( P = 5(0) + 7(0) = 0 \).
     - At \( (160, 0) \): \( P = 5(160) + 7(0) = 800 \).
     - At \( (0, 100) \): \( P = 5(0) + 7(100) = 700 \).

7. **Conclusion:**
   - The maximum profit is $800, achieved by producing 160 units of widget A and 0 units of widget B.

**Final Answer:**
To maximize profit, the company should produce 160 units of widget A and 0 units of widget B, resulting in a maximum profit of $800.
