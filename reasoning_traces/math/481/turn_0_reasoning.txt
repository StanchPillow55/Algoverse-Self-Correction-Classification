To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of tickets for Julia's family members attending the show. We are given the ticket prices and the number of family members attending, so we can break down the problem as follows:

1. **Identify the number of adults and children attending:**
   - Adults: Julia's mom, dad, and grandma are attending. This makes a total of 3 adults.
   - Children: Julia has three little sisters attending. This makes a total of 3 children.

2. **Determine the cost of tickets for adults:**
   - The ticket price for each adult is $12.
   - Since there are 3 adults, we calculate the total cost for adult tickets as follows:
     \[
     \text{Total cost for adults} = 3 \times 12 = 36
     \]
   - Therefore, the total cost for the adult tickets is $36.

3. **Determine the cost of tickets for children:**
   - The ticket price for each child is $10.
   - Since there are 3 children, we calculate the total cost for children tickets as follows:
     \[
     \text{Total cost for children} = 3 \times 10 = 30
     \]
   - Therefore, the total cost for the children tickets is $30.

4. **Calculate the total cost for all tickets:**
   - To find the total cost for all the tickets, we add the total cost for adults and the total cost for children:
     \[
     \text{Total cost} = \text{Total cost for adults} + \text{Total cost for children} = 36 + 30 = 66
     \]

Thus, the total cost for Julia's family to attend the show is $66.

**Final Answer:**
The total cost for the tickets is $66.
