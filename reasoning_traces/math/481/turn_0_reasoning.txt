==================================================

To find the total cost of the tickets for Julia's family, we first need to identify how many adults and how many children will be attending the show.

1. **Identify the family members:**
   - Mom (1 adult)
   - Dad (1 adult)
   - Grandma (1 adult)
   - Three little sisters (3 children)

2. **Count the number of adults and children:**
   - Total adults = 3 (Mom + Dad + Grandma)
   - Total children = 3 (Three little sisters)

3. **Determine the ticket prices:**
   - Adult ticket price = $12
   - Child ticket price = $10

4. **Calculate the total cost for adults:**
   \[
   \text{Total cost for adults} = \text{Number of adults} \times \text{Price per adult ticket}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total cost for adults} = 3 \times 12 = 36
   \]

5. **Calculate the total cost for children:**
   \[
   \text{Total cost for children} = \text{Number of children} \times \text{Price per child ticket}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total cost for children} = 3 \times 10 = 30
   \]

6. **Calculate the total cost for all tickets:**
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = \text{Total cost for adults} + \text{Total cost for children}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = 36 + 30 = 66
   \]

Therefore, the total cost for Julia's family's tickets is **$66**.

Final answer: **$66**
