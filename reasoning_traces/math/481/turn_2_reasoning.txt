Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to determine the weight of both the 2010 penny and the 1959 penny, and then find their combined weight.

1. **Identify the weight of the 1959 penny**:
   The problem states that the 1959 penny weighs 48 grains.

   \[
   \text{Weight of 1959 penny} = 48 \text{ grains}
   \]

2. **Determine the weight of the 2010 penny**:
   The problem states that the 2010 penny is three-quarters of the weight of the 1959 penny. To find the weight of the 2010 penny, we can calculate:

   \[
   \text{Weight of 2010 penny} = \frac{3}{4} \times \text{Weight of 1959 penny}
   \]

   Substituting the weight of the 1959 penny:

   \[
   \text{Weight of 2010 penny} = \frac{3}{4} \times 48 \text{ grains}
   \]

   Now, we perform the multiplication:

   \[
   \text{Weight of 2010 penny} = \frac{3 \times 48}{4} = \frac{144}{4} = 36 \text{ grains}
   \]

3. **Calculate the combined weight of both pennies**:
   Now that we have the weights of both pennies, we can find their combined weight:

   \[
   \text{Combined weight} = \text{Weight of 1959 penny} + \text{Weight of 2010 penny}
   \]

   Substituting the weights we found:

   \[
   \text{Combined weight} = 48 \text{ grains} + 36 \text{ grains}
   \]

   Performing the addition:

   \[
   \text{Combined weight} = 84 \text{ grains}
   \]

4. **Final answer**:
   The combined weight of the two pennies is 

   \[
   \boxed{84} \text{ grains}
   \]
