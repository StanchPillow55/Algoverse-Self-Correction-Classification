Question ID: 1199
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

Let's solve the problem step by step.

1. **Initial Amount of Root Beer**: Fred made 24 gallons of root beer on the first day.

2. **Children's Consumption**: Later that evening, Fred's children drank 4 gallons.
   \[
   \text{Remaining root beer after children} = 24 - 4 = 20 \text{ gallons}
   \]

3. **Wife's Spill**: On the second day, Fred's wife Barbie spilled 7 gallons.
   \[
   \text{Remaining root beer after spill} = 20 - 7 = 13 \text{ gallons}
   \]

4. **Friend's Consumption**: On the third day, Fred's friend Ronnie drank 5 gallons.
   \[
   \text{Remaining root beer after friend's consumption} = 13 - 5 = 8 \text{ gallons}
   \]

5. **Party Day**: On the fourth day, 3 people showed up for the party (including Fred).
   \[
   \text{Total people} = 3
   \]

6. **Root Beer per Person**: The remaining root beer (8 gallons) is shared equally among the 3 people.
   \[
   \text{Root beer per person} = \frac{8 \text{ gallons}}{3} \approx 2.67 \text{ gallons}
   \]

Thus, each person can drink approximately 2.67 gallons of root beer during the party.

**Final Answer**: Each person can drink approximately 2.67 gallons of root beer.
