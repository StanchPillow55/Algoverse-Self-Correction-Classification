Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To determine how much root beer each person can drink at the party, we will follow the events step by step and calculate the remaining amount of root beer after each incident.

1. **Initial Amount**: Fred made 24 gallons of root beer on the first day.

   \[
   \text{Initial amount} = 24 \text{ gallons}
   \]

2. **Children's Consumption**: Later that evening, Fred's children drank 4 gallons.

   \[
   \text{Remaining after children} = 24 - 4 = 20 \text{ gallons}
   \]

3. **Wife's Spill**: On the second day, Fred's wife Barbie accidentally spilled 7 gallons.

   \[
   \text{Remaining after spill} = 20 - 7 = 13 \text{ gallons}
   \]

4. **Friend's Consumption**: On the third day, Fred's friend Ronnie drank 5 gallons.

   \[
   \text{Remaining after friend} = 13 - 5 = 8 \text{ gallons}
   \]

5. **Party Day**: On the fourth day, 3 people showed up for the party (including Fred).

   \[
   \text{Total people} = 3
   \]

6. **Sharing the Remaining Root Beer**: The remaining 8 gallons will be shared equally among the 3 people.

   \[
   \text{Amount per person} = \frac{8 \text{ gallons}}{3} \approx 2.67 \text{ gallons}
   \]

Thus, each person can drink approximately 2.67 gallons of root beer during the party.

**Final Answer**: Each person can drink approximately 2.67 gallons of root beer.
