==================================================

To solve the problem, we will go through each day step by step, calculating the amount of root beer remaining after each incident.

1. **Initial Amount of Root Beer:**
   - Fred made 24 gallons of root beer on the first day.

   \[
   \text{Initial amount} = 24 \text{ gallons}
   \]

2. **After the Children Drank Some:**
   - Later that evening, Fred's children drank 4 gallons.

   \[
   \text{Remaining after children} = 24 - 4 = 20 \text{ gallons}
   \]

3. **After Barbie Spilled Some:**
   - On the second day, Fred's wife Barbie accidentally spilled 7 gallons.

   \[
   \text{Remaining after Barbie} = 20 - 7 = 13 \text{ gallons}
   \]

4. **After Ronnie Took Some:**
   - On the third day, Fred's friend Ronnie drank 5 gallons.

   \[
   \text{Remaining after Ronnie} = 13 - 5 = 8 \text{ gallons}
   \]

5. **Dividing Among Party Attendees:**
   - On the fourth day, 3 people showed up for the party (including Fred). Therefore, there are 4 people in total.

   \[
   \text{Total people} = 4
   \]

   Now we will divide the remaining root beer equally among the 4 people.

   \[
   \text{Amount per person} = \frac{8 \text{ gallons}}{4} = 2 \text{ gallons}
   \]

Thus, each person can drink **2 gallons** of root beer during the party.

**Final Answer:**
Each person can drink **2 gallons** of root beer.
