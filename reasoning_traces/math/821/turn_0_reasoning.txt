To solve the problem, we will break it down step by step.

1. **Initial Count of Cars**: 
   Hunter counted 50 cars when he first entered the parking lot.

   \[
   \text{Initial count of cars} = 50
   \]

2. **Count of Additional Cars During Break**: 
   During the first break, he counted 20 more cars. We need to add this to the initial count.

   \[
   \text{Count of additional cars} = 20
   \]

   Now, we calculate the total number of cars after the first break:

   \[
   \text{Total cars after first break} = \text{Initial count} + \text{Count of additional cars} = 50 + 20 = 70
   \]

3. **Cars Leaving the Parking Lot**: 
   When Hunter got out of class for the lunch break, he realized that half of the cars in the parking lot had left. We need to find out how many cars left.

   \[
   \text{Cars that left} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Total cars after first break} = \frac{1}{2} \times 70 = 35
   \]

4. **Calculating Remaining Cars**: 
   To find out how many cars are left in the parking lot after half of them left, we subtract the number of cars that left from the total number of cars after the first break.

   \[
   \text{Remaining cars} = \text{Total cars after first break} - \text{Cars that left} = 70 - 35 = 35
   \]

5. **Final Count of Cars During Lunch Break**: 
   The total number of cars Hunter counted during the lunch break is the number of cars remaining in the parking lot.

   \[
   \text{Total number of cars during lunch break} = 35
   \]

Thus, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{35}
\]
