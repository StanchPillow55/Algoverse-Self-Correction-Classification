==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 40," we need to first understand what the problem is asking. However, the problem statement "Sample math problem 40" is not specific enough to determine the exact nature of the problem. Therefore, I will assume that this is a placeholder for a typical math problem that involves the number 40 in some way. 

Let's consider a few possible interpretations of "Sample math problem 40" and solve them:

### Interpretation 1: Basic Arithmetic Problem
**Problem:** What is 40 plus 10?

**Solution:**
1. Start with the number 40.
2. Add 10 to 40.

\[ 40 + 10 = 50 \]

**Final Answer:** 50

### Interpretation 2: Multiplication Problem
**Problem:** What is 40 times 2?

**Solution:**
1. Start with the number 40.
2. Multiply 40 by 2.

\[ 40 \times 2 = 80 \]

**Final Answer:** 80

### Interpretation 3: Division Problem
**Problem:** What is 40 divided by 5?

**Solution:**
1. Start with the number 40.
2. Divide 40 by 5.

\[ 40 \div 5 = 8 \]

**Final Answer:** 8

### Interpretation 4: Algebraic Problem
**Problem:** Solve for \( x \) if \( 2x = 40 \).

**Solution:**
1. Start with the equation \( 2x = 40 \).
2. Divide both sides of the equation by 2 to solve for \( x \).

\[ x = \frac{40}{2} = 20 \]

**Final Answer:** \( x = 20 \)

### Interpretation 5: Percentage Problem
**Problem:** What is 40% of 100?

**Solution:**
1. Convert 40% to a decimal by dividing by 100: \( 0.40 \).
2. Multiply 0.40 by 100.

\[ 0.40 \times 100 = 40 \]

**Final Answer:** 40

### Conclusion
Without a specific problem statement, I have provided solutions to several possible interpretations of "Sample math problem 40." Each interpretation involves the number 40 in a different mathematical context. If you have a specific problem in mind, please provide more details so I can give a more precise solution.
