It seems like the problem statement is incomplete or unclear. However, I'll assume you want me to solve a math problem involving the number 40. Let's create a problem involving the number 40 and solve it step by step.

**Problem:**
Calculate the sum of all even numbers from 1 to 40.

**Solution:**

To solve this problem, we need to identify all even numbers between 1 and 40 and then find their sum.

**Step 1: Identify the even numbers from 1 to 40.**

Even numbers are integers that are divisible by 2. The even numbers between 1 and 40 are:
\[ 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, 24, 26, 28, 30, 32, 34, 36, 38, 40 \]

**Step 2: Count the number of even numbers.**

The sequence of even numbers from 2 to 40 is an arithmetic sequence where the first term \( a_1 = 2 \) and the common difference \( d = 2 \).

To find the number of terms \( n \) in this sequence, we use the formula for the \( n \)-th term of an arithmetic sequence:
\[ a_n = a_1 + (n-1) \cdot d \]

Setting \( a_n = 40 \), we solve for \( n \):
\[ 40 = 2 + (n-1) \cdot 2 \]
\[ 40 = 2 + 2n - 2 \]
\[ 40 = 2n \]
\[ n = 20 \]

There are 20 even numbers from 1 to 40.

**Step 3: Calculate the sum of the even numbers.**

The sum \( S_n \) of the first \( n \) terms of an arithmetic sequence is given by the formula:
\[ S_n = \frac{n}{2} \cdot (a_1 + a_n) \]

Substituting the known values:
\[ S_{20} = \frac{20}{2} \cdot (2 + 40) \]
\[ S_{20} = 10 \cdot 42 \]
\[ S_{20} = 420 \]

Therefore, the sum of all even numbers from 1 to 40 is 420.

**Final Answer:**
The sum of all even numbers from 1 to 40 is 420.
