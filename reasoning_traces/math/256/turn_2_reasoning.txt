Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to determine the actual distance between the towns of Pence and Hillcrest based on the scale provided by the map.

**Step 1: Understand the scale of the map.**

The map scale is given as 1/4 inch representing 8 miles. This means that for every 1/4 inch on the map, the actual distance is 8 miles.

**Step 2: Determine the distance on the map.**

The distance between Pence and Hillcrest on the map is given as 3 3/8 inches. To work with this, we first convert the mixed number into an improper fraction:

\[ 
3 \frac{3}{8} = \frac{3 \times 8 + 3}{8} = \frac{24 + 3}{8} = \frac{27}{8} \text{ inches}
\]

**Step 3: Calculate the actual distance.**

Since 1/4 inch on the map corresponds to 8 miles, we need to find out how many 1/4 inch segments fit into 3 3/8 inches. To do this, divide the map distance by the scale:

\[ 
\frac{27}{8} \text{ inches} \div \frac{1}{4} \text{ inch} = \frac{27}{8} \times \frac{4}{1} = \frac{27 \times 4}{8} = \frac{108}{8} = 13.5
\]

This result, 13.5, represents how many 1/4 inch segments fit into the 3 3/8 inches.

**Step 4: Convert the number of segments to miles.**

Since each 1/4 inch segment represents 8 miles, multiply the number of segments by 8 to find the actual distance:

\[ 
13.5 \times 8 = 108 \text{ miles}
\]

**Final Answer:**

The actual distance between the towns of Pence and Hillcrest is 108 miles.
