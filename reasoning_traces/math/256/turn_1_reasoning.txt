To solve the problem of finding the actual distance between the towns of Pence and Hillcrest, we need to use the scale provided by the map. Let's break down the problem step by step:

### Step 1: Understand the Scale
The map scale is given as \( \frac{1}{4} \) inch representing 8 miles. This means that for every \( \frac{1}{4} \) inch on the map, the actual distance is 8 miles.

### Step 2: Determine the Map Distance
The distance between Pence and Hillcrest on the map is given as \( 3 \frac{3}{8} \) inches. First, we need to convert this mixed number into an improper fraction for easier calculations.

\[ 
3 \frac{3}{8} = \frac{3 \times 8 + 3}{8} = \frac{24 + 3}{8} = \frac{27}{8} \text{ inches}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the Actual Distance
To find the actual distance, we need to determine how many \( \frac{1}{4} \) inch segments fit into \( \frac{27}{8} \) inches. We do this by dividing the map distance by the scale:

\[ 
\text{Number of } \frac{1}{4} \text{ inch segments} = \frac{\frac{27}{8}}{\frac{1}{4}} 
\]

To divide by a fraction, we multiply by its reciprocal:

\[ 
\frac{27}{8} \div \frac{1}{4} = \frac{27}{8} \times \frac{4}{1} = \frac{27 \times 4}{8} = \frac{108}{8} 
\]

Simplify \( \frac{108}{8} \):

\[ 
\frac{108}{8} = \frac{108 \div 4}{8 \div 4} = \frac{27}{2} 
\]

This means there are \( \frac{27}{2} \) segments of \( \frac{1}{4} \) inch in \( \frac{27}{8} \) inches.

### Step 4: Convert Segments to Miles
Since each \( \frac{1}{4} \) inch segment represents 8 miles, the actual distance in miles is:

\[ 
\text{Actual distance} = \frac{27}{2} \times 8 
\]

Calculate the multiplication:

\[ 
\frac{27}{2} \times 8 = \frac{27 \times 8}{2} = \frac{216}{2} = 108 \text{ miles}
\]

### Final Answer
The actual distance between the towns of Pence and Hillcrest is 108 miles.
