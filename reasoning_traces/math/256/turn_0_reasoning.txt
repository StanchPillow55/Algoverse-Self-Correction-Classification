To find out how much money Brady has in his piggy bank, we will calculate the total value of each type of coin and bill he has, and then sum them up.

1. **Calculate the value of the pennies:**
   - Brady has 100 pennies.
   - The value of one penny is $0.01.
   - Therefore, the total value of the pennies is:
     \[
     100 \text{ pennies} \times 0.01 \text{ dollars/penny} = 1.00 \text{ dollar}
     \]

2. **Calculate the value of the nickels:**
   - Brady has 40 nickels.
   - The value of one nickel is $0.05.
   - Therefore, the total value of the nickels is:
     \[
     40 \text{ nickels} \times 0.05 \text{ dollars/nickel} = 2.00 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Calculate the value of the dimes:**
   - Brady has 20 dimes.
   - The value of one dime is $0.10.
   - Therefore, the total value of the dimes is:
     \[
     20 \text{ dimes} \times 0.10 \text{ dollars/dime} = 2.00 \text{ dollars}
     \]

4. **Calculate the value of the dollar bills:**
   - Brady has 40 dollar bills.
   - The value of one dollar bill is $1.00.
   - Therefore, the total value of the dollar bills is:
     \[
     40 \text{ dollar bills} \times 1.00 \text{ dollar/bill} = 40.00 \text{ dollars}
     \]

5. **Sum up all the values:**
   - Now we add the total values of all the coins and bills:
     \[
     1.00 \text{ (pennies)} + 2.00 \text{ (nickels)} + 2.00 \text{ (dimes)} + 40.00 \text{ (dollar bills)} = 45.00 \text{ dollars}
     \]

Thus, the total amount of money Brady has in his piggy bank is:

\[
\boxed{45.00} \text{ dollars}
\]
