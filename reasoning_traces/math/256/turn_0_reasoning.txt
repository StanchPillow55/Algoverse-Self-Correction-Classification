==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine the actual distance between the towns of Pence and Hillcrest based on the scale provided by the map. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the solution:

### Step 1: Understand the Scale
The map scale is given as \( \frac{1}{4} \) inch representing 8 miles. This means that for every \( \frac{1}{4} \) inch on the map, the actual distance is 8 miles.

### Step 2: Convert the Map Distance to Actual Distance
The distance between Pence and Hillcrest on the map is given as \( 3 \frac{3}{8} \) inches. First, we need to convert this mixed number into an improper fraction for easier calculations.

\[ 
3 \frac{3}{8} = \frac{3 \times 8 + 3}{8} = \frac{24 + 3}{8} = \frac{27}{8} \text{ inches}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the Actual Distance
Since \( \frac{1}{4} \) inch represents 8 miles, we need to determine how many \( \frac{1}{4} \) inch segments are in \( \frac{27}{8} \) inches.

To find this, divide \( \frac{27}{8} \) by \( \frac{1}{4} \):

\[
\frac{27}{8} \div \frac{1}{4} = \frac{27}{8} \times \frac{4}{1} = \frac{27 \times 4}{8 \times 1} = \frac{108}{8} = 13.5
\]

This means there are 13.5 segments of \( \frac{1}{4} \) inch in \( \frac{27}{8} \) inches.

### Step 4: Calculate the Total Miles
Since each \( \frac{1}{4} \) inch represents 8 miles, the actual distance in miles is:

\[
13.5 \times 8 = 108 \text{ miles}
\]

### Final Answer
The actual distance between the towns of Pence and Hillcrest is 108 miles.
