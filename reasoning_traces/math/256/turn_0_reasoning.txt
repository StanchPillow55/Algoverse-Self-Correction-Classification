To find the actual distance between the towns of Pence and Hillcrest based on their representation on the map, we can follow these steps:

1. **Understand the scale of the map**: The problem states that \( \frac{1}{4} \) inch on the map represents 8 miles of actual distance. 

2. **Convert the map distance to a fraction of an inch**: The distance between Pence and Hillcrest is given as \( 3 \frac{3}{8} \) inches. We can convert this mixed number into an improper fraction for easier calculations:
   \[
   3 \frac{3}{8} = \frac{3 \times 8 + 3}{8} = \frac{24 + 3}{8} = \frac{27}{8} \text{ inches}
   \]

3. **Determine how many \( \frac{1}{4} \) inch segments are in \( \frac{27}{8} \) inches**: Since \( \frac{1}{4} \) inch represents 8 miles, we need to find out how many \( \frac{1}{4} \) inch segments fit into \( \frac{27}{8} \) inches. To do this, we divide \( \frac{27}{8} \) by \( \frac{1}{4} \):
   \[
   \frac{27}{8} \div \frac{1}{4} = \frac{27}{8} \times \frac{4}{1} = \frac{27 \times 4}{8 \times 1} = \frac{108}{8} = \frac{27}{2}
   \]
   This means there are \( \frac{27}{2} \) segments of \( \frac{1}{4} \) inch in \( 3 \frac{3}{8} \) inches.

4. **Calculate the actual distance**: Since each \( \frac{1}{4} \) inch represents 8 miles, we multiply the number of segments by the distance each segment represents:
   \[
   \text{Actual distance} = \frac{27}{2} \times 8 = \frac{27 \times 8}{2} = \frac{216}{2} = 108 \text{ miles}
   \]

Thus, the actual distance between the towns of Pence and Hillcrest is \( \boxed{108} \) miles.
