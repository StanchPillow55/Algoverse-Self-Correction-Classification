==================================================

To solve a problem effectively, it's important to first understand the question and identify what is being asked. However, the question provided, "Sample reasoning question 104," does not contain any specific mathematical problem or context to work through. It seems to be a placeholder or reference to a problem that hasn't been fully described.

To proceed, I would need more details or a specific mathematical problem to solve. If you have a particular math problem in mind, please provide the details, and I'll be happy to work through it step by step.

If this is a hypothetical scenario where I need to demonstrate how to solve a typical math problem, I can create an example problem and solve it. Here's a simple example:

**Example Problem:**

Calculate the sum of the first 10 positive integers.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We need to find the sum of the first 10 positive integers: 1, 2, 3, ..., 10.

2. **Identify the Formula:**
   - The sum of the first \( n \) positive integers can be calculated using the formula:
     \[
     S = \frac{n(n + 1)}{2}
     \]
   - For this problem, \( n = 10 \).

3. **Substitute the Values:**
   - Substitute \( n = 10 \) into the formula:
     \[
     S = \frac{10(10 + 1)}{2}
     \]

4. **Perform the Calculations:**
   - Calculate the expression inside the parentheses:
     \[
     10 + 1 = 11
     \]
   - Multiply 10 by 11:
     \[
     10 \times 11 = 110
     \]
   - Divide by 2:
     \[
     \frac{110}{2} = 55
     \]

5. **State the Final Answer:**
   - The sum of the first 10 positive integers is 55.

If you have a specific problem or need further assistance, please provide more information, and I'll be glad to help!
