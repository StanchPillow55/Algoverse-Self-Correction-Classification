==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 104" refers to. Since this is not a standard math problem description, I'll assume it's a placeholder for a specific type of reasoning or math problem. Without specific details, I'll create a generic example of a reasoning problem and solve it step by step.

Let's assume "Sample reasoning question 104" is a logic puzzle involving numbers. Here's a hypothetical problem:

**Problem:**
You have a sequence of numbers: 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, ... What is the 10th number in this sequence?

**Solution:**

1. **Identify the Pattern:**
   - Look at the sequence: 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, ...
   - Notice that each number is double the previous number.
   - This is a geometric sequence where each term is multiplied by 2 to get the next term.

2. **Define the Sequence Mathematically:**
   - The first term (a_1) is 2.
   - The common ratio (r) is 2.
   - The nth term of a geometric sequence can be found using the formula:
     \[
     a_n = a_1 \times r^{(n-1)}
     \]

3. **Calculate the 10th Term:**
   - Substitute the known values into the formula:
     \[
     a_{10} = 2 \times 2^{(10-1)}
     \]
   - Simplify the exponent:
     \[
     a_{10} = 2 \times 2^9
     \]
   - Calculate \(2^9\):
     \[
     2^9 = 512
     \]
   - Multiply by the first term:
     \[
     a_{10} = 2 \times 512 = 1024
     \]

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The 10th number in the sequence is 1024.

**Final Answer:**
The 10th number in the sequence is 1024.

This example illustrates how to approach a reasoning problem by identifying patterns, using mathematical formulas, and performing calculations step by step. If you have a specific problem or need further assistance, please provide more details!
