==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 104" entails. Since the problem statement is not specific, I'll assume it's a generic math problem that requires logical reasoning and problem-solving skills. Let's create a hypothetical problem and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**

A farmer has a rectangular field that is 150 meters long and 100 meters wide. He wants to divide this field into smaller rectangular plots, each with an area of 500 square meters. How many such plots can the farmer create?

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We have a rectangular field with dimensions 150 meters by 100 meters.
   - The total area of the field is calculated by multiplying the length by the width.

2. **Calculate the Total Area of the Field:**
   \[
   \text{Total Area} = \text{Length} \times \text{Width} = 150 \, \text{meters} \times 100 \, \text{meters} = 15,000 \, \text{square meters}
   \]

3. **Determine the Area of Each Plot:**
   - Each plot should have an area of 500 square meters.

4. **Calculate the Number of Plots:**
   - To find out how many plots of 500 square meters can fit into the total area, divide the total area by the area of one plot.
   \[
   \text{Number of Plots} = \frac{\text{Total Area}}{\text{Area of One Plot}} = \frac{15,000 \, \text{square meters}}{500 \, \text{square meters}}
   \]

5. **Perform the Division:**
   \[
   \text{Number of Plots} = \frac{15,000}{500} = 30
   \]

6. **Conclusion:**
   - The farmer can create 30 plots, each with an area of 500 square meters, from the field.

**Final Answer:**
The farmer can create 30 plots, each with an area of 500 square meters.
