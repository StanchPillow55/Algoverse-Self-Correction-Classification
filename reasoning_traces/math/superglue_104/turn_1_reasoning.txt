==================================================

To solve the problem effectively, I need to understand what "Sample reasoning question 104" entails. Since the problem statement is not provided, I'll demonstrate a general approach to solving a typical math problem by breaking it down step by step. If you have a specific problem in mind, please provide the details, and I can tailor the solution accordingly.

Let's assume a sample problem for demonstration purposes:

**Problem:**  
Calculate the area of a triangle with a base of 10 units and a height of 5 units.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We need to find the area of a triangle.
   - The formula for the area of a triangle is:  
     \[
     \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height}
     \]

2. **Identify Given Values:**
   - Base (\(b\)) = 10 units
   - Height (\(h\)) = 5 units

3. **Substitute the Values into the Formula:**
   - Plug the given values into the area formula:  
     \[
     \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times 10 \times 5
     \]

4. **Perform the Calculations:**
   - First, multiply the base and height:  
     \[
     10 \times 5 = 50
     \]
   - Then, multiply by \(\frac{1}{2}\):  
     \[
     \frac{1}{2} \times 50 = 25
     \]

5. **State the Final Answer:**
   - The area of the triangle is 25 square units.

**Final Answer:**  
The area of the triangle is 25 square units.

This structured approach ensures that each step is clear and logical, leading to the correct solution. If you have a specific problem or need further assistance, please provide more details.
