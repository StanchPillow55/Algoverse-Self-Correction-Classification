To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample math problem 270" refers to. Since the problem statement is not clear, let's assume it is a placeholder for a specific math problem. Without additional context, I'll create a hypothetical math problem involving the number 270 and solve it step-by-step.

**Problem:**  
Find the prime factorization of 270 and determine the number of positive divisors it has.

**Step 1: Prime Factorization of 270**

To find the prime factorization, we start by dividing 270 by the smallest prime number, which is 2, and continue dividing by prime numbers until we reach 1.

1. **Divide by 2:**  
   270 is even, so divide by 2:  
   \( 270 \div 2 = 135 \)  
   So, 270 = \( 2 \times 135 \).

2. **Divide by 3:**  
   135 is divisible by 3 (since the sum of its digits, 1 + 3 + 5 = 9, is divisible by 3):  
   \( 135 \div 3 = 45 \)  
   So, 135 = \( 3 \times 45 \).

3. **Divide by 3 again:**  
   45 is also divisible by 3 (since 4 + 5 = 9 is divisible by 3):  
   \( 45 \div 3 = 15 \)  
   So, 45 = \( 3 \times 15 \).

4. **Divide by 3 once more:**  
   15 is divisible by 3 (since 1 + 5 = 6 is divisible by 3):  
   \( 15 \div 3 = 5 \)  
   So, 15 = \( 3 \times 5 \).

5. **Divide by 5:**  
   5 is a prime number, so divide by 5:  
   \( 5 \div 5 = 1 \)  
   So, 5 = \( 5 \times 1 \).

Thus, the prime factorization of 270 is:  
\[ 270 = 2 \times 3^3 \times 5 \]

**Step 2: Determine the Number of Positive Divisors**

To find the number of positive divisors, use the formula for the divisors of a number given its prime factorization. If a number \( n \) has the prime factorization \( p_1^{a_1} \times p_2^{a_2} \times \ldots \times p_k^{a_k} \), then the number of positive divisors \( D(n) \) is given by:  
\[ D(n) = (a_1 + 1)(a_2 + 1) \ldots (a_k + 1) \]

For 270, the prime factorization is \( 2^1 \times 3^3 \times 5^1 \). Therefore, the number of divisors is:  
\[ D(270) = (1 + 1)(3 + 1)(1 + 1) = 2 \times 4 \times 2 = 16 \]

**Final Answer:**  
The prime factorization of 270 is \( 2 \times 3^3 \times 5 \), and it has 16 positive divisors.
