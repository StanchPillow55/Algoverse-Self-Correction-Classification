==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 270," we need to first understand what the problem is asking. However, the problem statement "Sample math problem 270" is not specific enough to determine the exact nature of the problem. It seems like a placeholder or reference to a specific problem that might be found in a textbook or a collection of problems.

Since the problem is not explicitly stated, let's assume a hypothetical math problem related to the number 270. We can explore several mathematical concepts involving the number 270, such as its factors, prime factorization, or properties.

### Exploring the Number 270

1. **Prime Factorization:**
   - To find the prime factorization of 270, we start by dividing it by the smallest prime number, which is 2.
   - \( 270 \div 2 = 135 \)
   - Next, we divide 135 by the next smallest prime number, which is 3.
   - \( 135 \div 3 = 45 \)
   - We continue dividing by 3.
   - \( 45 \div 3 = 15 \)
   - Again, divide by 3.
   - \( 15 \div 3 = 5 \)
   - Finally, 5 is a prime number.
   - Therefore, the prime factorization of 270 is \( 2 \times 3^3 \times 5 \).

2. **Factors of 270:**
   - Using the prime factorization, we can determine the factors of 270.
   - The factors are all the products of the prime factors taken at different powers.
   - Factors of 270 include: 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 9, 10, 15, 18, 27, 30, 45, 54, 90, 135, and 270.

3. **Properties of 270:**
   - 270 is an even number because it is divisible by 2.
   - It is also divisible by 3 and 5, making it a composite number.
   - The sum of its digits is \( 2 + 7 + 0 = 9 \), which is divisible by 3, confirming its divisibility by 3.

4. **Divisibility:**
   - 270 is divisible by 2, 3, 5, 9, and 10, among others, due to its prime factorization.

### Conclusion

Since the original problem statement "Sample math problem 270" does not specify a particular question, we explored various mathematical aspects of the number 270. If there is a specific problem you intended to ask about, please provide more details or clarify the question.

If this exploration satisfies your inquiry, the final answer is the prime factorization of 270:

**Final Answer:**
The prime factorization of 270 is \( 2 \times 3^3 \times 5 \).
