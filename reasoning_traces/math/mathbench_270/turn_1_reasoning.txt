==================================================

To solve the sample math problem 270, let's first understand what the problem is asking. Since the problem statement is not fully clear, I'll assume "270" refers to a number that we need to analyze or solve a problem related to it. I'll explore a few possibilities:

### Possibility 1: Prime Factorization of 270
Let's find the prime factorization of 270.

1. **Divide by 2 (the smallest prime number):**
   \[
   270 \div 2 = 135
   \]
   So, 270 = 2 × 135.

2. **Divide 135 by 3 (the next smallest prime number):**
   \[
   135 \div 3 = 45
   \]
   So, 135 = 3 × 45, and therefore 270 = 2 × 3 × 45.

3. **Divide 45 by 3 again:**
   \[
   45 \div 3 = 15
   \]
   So, 45 = 3 × 15, and therefore 270 = 2 × 3 × 3 × 15.

4. **Divide 15 by 3:**
   \[
   15 \div 3 = 5
   \]
   So, 15 = 3 × 5, and therefore 270 = 2 × 3 × 3 × 3 × 5.

Thus, the prime factorization of 270 is:
\[
270 = 2 \times 3^3 \times 5
\]

### Possibility 2: Sum of Digits of 270
Let's calculate the sum of the digits of 270.

- The digits of 270 are 2, 7, and 0.
- Sum of the digits = 2 + 7 + 0 = 9.

### Possibility 3: Check if 270 is a Perfect Square
A perfect square is a number that can be expressed as the square of an integer. Let's check if 270 is a perfect square.

- Calculate the square root of 270:
  \[
  \sqrt{270} \approx 16.43
  \]
- Since 16.43 is not an integer, 270 is not a perfect square.

### Possibility 4: Check if 270 is a Perfect Cube
A perfect cube is a number that can be expressed as the cube of an integer. Let's check if 270 is a perfect cube.

- Calculate the cube root of 270:
  \[
  \sqrt[3]{270} \approx 6.49
  \]
- Since 6.49 is not an integer, 270 is not a perfect cube.

### Conclusion
Without a specific question related to the number 270, I've explored several mathematical aspects of the number:

1. **Prime Factorization:** \(270 = 2 \times 3^3 \times 5\)
2. **Sum of Digits:** 9
3. **Not a Perfect Square**
4. **Not a Perfect Cube**

If there is a specific question or context related to the number 270, please provide more details for a more targeted solution.
