==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 270," we need to first understand what the problem is asking. However, the problem statement "Sample math problem 270" is not specific enough to provide a clear question or context. Therefore, I will assume that "Sample math problem 270" refers to a typical math problem involving the number 270. Let's create a problem involving the number 270 and solve it.

**Problem:**
Find the prime factorization of the number 270 and determine the number of divisors it has.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Prime Factorization:**
   - Start by dividing 270 by the smallest prime number, which is 2.
   - \( 270 \div 2 = 135 \)
   - 135 is not divisible by 2, so we move to the next smallest prime number, which is 3.
   - \( 135 \div 3 = 45 \)
   - 45 is divisible by 3 again.
   - \( 45 \div 3 = 15 \)
   - 15 is divisible by 3 once more.
   - \( 15 \div 3 = 5 \)
   - 5 is a prime number.

   Therefore, the prime factorization of 270 is:
   \[
   270 = 2 \times 3^3 \times 5
   \]

2. **Finding the Number of Divisors:**
   - To find the number of divisors of a number, use its prime factorization. If a number \( n \) has the prime factorization \( p_1^{a_1} \times p_2^{a_2} \times \ldots \times p_k^{a_k} \), then the number of divisors \( D(n) \) is given by:
   \[
   D(n) = (a_1 + 1)(a_2 + 1) \ldots (a_k + 1)
   \]
   - For 270, with the prime factorization \( 2^1 \times 3^3 \times 5^1 \), the number of divisors is:
   \[
   D(270) = (1 + 1)(3 + 1)(1 + 1) = 2 \times 4 \times 2 = 16
   \]

**Final Answer:**
The prime factorization of 270 is \( 2 \times 3^3 \times 5 \), and it has 16 divisors.
