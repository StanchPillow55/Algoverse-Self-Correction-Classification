==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample math problem 270" refers to. Since the problem statement is not explicitly provided, I'll assume it's a placeholder for a typical math problem. Let's create a sample math problem and solve it step by step.

**Sample Math Problem:**

"Calculate the sum of all even numbers between 1 and 270."

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Identify the Sequence of Even Numbers:**
   - The even numbers between 1 and 270 start from 2 and go up to 270.
   - This sequence is: 2, 4, 6, ..., 268, 270.

2. **Determine the Number of Terms in the Sequence:**
   - This is an arithmetic sequence where the first term \( a_1 = 2 \) and the last term \( a_n = 270 \), with a common difference \( d = 2 \).
   - The formula for the \( n \)-th term of an arithmetic sequence is:
     \[
     a_n = a_1 + (n-1) \cdot d
     \]
   - Plugging in the values, we have:
     \[
     270 = 2 + (n-1) \cdot 2
     \]
     \[
     270 = 2 + 2n - 2
     \]
     \[
     270 = 2n
     \]
     \[
     n = \frac{270}{2} = 135
     \]
   - So, there are 135 even numbers between 1 and 270.

3. **Calculate the Sum of the Sequence:**
   - The sum \( S_n \) of the first \( n \) terms of an arithmetic sequence is given by:
     \[
     S_n = \frac{n}{2} \cdot (a_1 + a_n)
     \]
   - Substituting the known values:
     \[
     S_{135} = \frac{135}{2} \cdot (2 + 270)
     \]
     \[
     S_{135} = \frac{135}{2} \cdot 272
     \]
     \[
     S_{135} = 135 \cdot 136
     \]
     \[
     S_{135} = 18360
     \]

**Final Answer:**

The sum of all even numbers between 1 and 270 is 18,360.
