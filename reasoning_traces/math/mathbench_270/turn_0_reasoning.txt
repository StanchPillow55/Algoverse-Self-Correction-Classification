To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample math problem 270" refers to. Since there is no specific problem statement provided, I'll assume a generic math problem involving the number 270. Let's consider a problem where we need to find the prime factorization of 270 and then use it to solve a related question.

**Problem:**
Find the prime factorization of 270 and determine the number of divisors it has.

**Step 1: Prime Factorization of 270**

To find the prime factorization, we start by dividing 270 by the smallest prime number, which is 2, and continue dividing by prime numbers until we reach 1.

1. \( 270 \div 2 = 135 \)  
   Since 270 is even, it is divisible by 2.

2. \( 135 \div 3 = 45 \)  
   The sum of the digits of 135 is \( 1 + 3 + 5 = 9 \), which is divisible by 3.

3. \( 45 \div 3 = 15 \)  
   The sum of the digits of 45 is \( 4 + 5 = 9 \), which is divisible by 3.

4. \( 15 \div 3 = 5 \)  
   The sum of the digits of 15 is \( 1 + 5 = 6 \), which is divisible by 3.

5. \( 5 \div 5 = 1 \)  
   5 is a prime number.

Thus, the prime factorization of 270 is \( 2 \times 3^3 \times 5 \).

**Step 2: Determine the Number of Divisors**

To find the number of divisors of a number, we use its prime factorization. If a number \( n \) has the prime factorization \( p_1^{a_1} \times p_2^{a_2} \times \ldots \times p_k^{a_k} \), then the number of divisors \( D(n) \) is given by:

\[
D(n) = (a_1 + 1)(a_2 + 1) \ldots (a_k + 1)
\]

For 270, the prime factorization is \( 2^1 \times 3^3 \times 5^1 \). Therefore, the number of divisors is:

\[
D(270) = (1 + 1)(3 + 1)(1 + 1) = 2 \times 4 \times 2 = 16
\]

**Final Answer:**

The prime factorization of 270 is \( 2 \times 3^3 \times 5 \), and it has 16 divisors.
