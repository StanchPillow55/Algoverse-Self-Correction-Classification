==================================================

To determine how much money Craig has left after his purchases, we will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate Craig's initial amount of money.**
   Craig has 2 twenty dollar bills. Therefore, his initial amount of money is:
   \[
   2 \times 20 = 40 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Calculate the total cost of the squirt guns.**
   Craig buys 6 squirt guns, each costing $2. The total cost for the squirt guns is:
   \[
   6 \times 2 = 12 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total cost of the water balloons.**
   Craig buys 3 packs of water balloons, each costing $3. The total cost for the water balloons is:
   \[
   3 \times 3 = 9 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Calculate the total cost of all items purchased.**
   Now, we add the total costs of the squirt guns and the water balloons:
   \[
   12 + 9 = 21 \text{ dollars}
   \]

5. **Calculate how much money Craig has left.**
   To find out how much money Craig has left after his purchases, we subtract the total cost of the items from his initial amount of money:
   \[
   40 - 21 = 19 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Thus, after making his purchases, Craig has **19 dollars** left.

Final answer:
\[
\boxed{19}
\]
