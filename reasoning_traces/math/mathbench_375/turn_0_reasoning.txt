==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to understand what "Sample math problem 375" refers to. Since there is no specific problem statement provided, I will assume this is a placeholder for a generic math problem. Let's create a sample math problem involving the number 375 and solve it step by step.

**Sample Problem:**
Find the sum of the digits of the number 375 and determine if this sum is a prime number.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Identify the digits of the number 375:**
   - The number 375 consists of three digits: 3, 7, and 5.

2. **Calculate the sum of the digits:**
   - Add the digits together: \(3 + 7 + 5\).

   \[
   3 + 7 = 10
   \]

   \[
   10 + 5 = 15
   \]

   So, the sum of the digits is 15.

3. **Determine if the sum (15) is a prime number:**
   - A prime number is a number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.
   - Check the divisibility of 15:
     - 15 is divisible by 1 and 15 (trivially).
     - Check divisibility by 2: 15 is odd, so it is not divisible by 2.
     - Check divisibility by 3: The sum of the digits of 15 is \(1 + 5 = 6\), which is divisible by 3. Therefore, 15 is divisible by 3.
     - Since 15 is divisible by 3, it is not a prime number.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The sum of the digits of 375 is 15.
   - 15 is not a prime number because it has divisors other than 1 and itself (specifically, it is divisible by 3 and 5).

**Final Answer:**
The sum of the digits of 375 is 15, and 15 is not a prime number.
