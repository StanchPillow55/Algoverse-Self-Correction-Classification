It seems like you've mentioned "Sample math problem 375" without providing the specific details of the problem. To help you effectively, I need the exact math problem you're referring to. However, I can create a sample math problem involving the number 375 and solve it step by step for you. Let's consider the following problem:

**Problem:**
Find the sum of the digits of the number 375 and determine if this sum is a prime number.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Identify the digits of the number 375:**
   - The number 375 consists of three digits: 3, 7, and 5.

2. **Calculate the sum of the digits:**
   - Add the digits together: \(3 + 7 + 5\).

   \[
   3 + 7 = 10
   \]
   \[
   10 + 5 = 15
   \]

   So, the sum of the digits is 15.

3. **Determine if the sum (15) is a prime number:**
   - A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.
   - Check the divisibility of 15:
     - 15 is divisible by 1, 3, 5, and 15.
     - Since 15 has divisors other than 1 and itself, it is not a prime number.

**Conclusion:**
The sum of the digits of the number 375 is 15, and 15 is not a prime number.

**Final Answer:**
The sum of the digits of 375 is 15, and it is not a prime number.
