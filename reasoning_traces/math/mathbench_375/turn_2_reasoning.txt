==================================================

To solve the sample math problem "375," let's first clarify what the problem is asking. Since "375" is just a number, we need to assume a mathematical operation or context to work with. For the sake of this exercise, let's assume we need to perform some basic operations or analysis on the number 375. Here are a few possibilities:

### 1. Prime Factorization of 375
Let's find the prime factorization of the number 375.

**Step 1: Divide by the smallest prime number (2)**
- 375 is an odd number, so it is not divisible by 2.

**Step 2: Divide by the next smallest prime number (3)**
- Sum of the digits of 375 is \(3 + 7 + 5 = 15\), which is divisible by 3.
- Divide 375 by 3: 
  \[
  375 \div 3 = 125
  \]

**Step 3: Continue with 125**
- 125 is not divisible by 3 (since \(1 + 2 + 5 = 8\) is not divisible by 3).
- 125 is not divisible by 5 (since it ends in 5, it is divisible by 5).
- Divide 125 by 5:
  \[
  125 \div 5 = 25
  \]

**Step 4: Continue with 25**
- 25 is divisible by 5 (since it ends in 5).
- Divide 25 by 5:
  \[
  25 \div 5 = 5
  \]

**Step 5: Continue with 5**
- 5 is a prime number and is divisible by itself.
- Divide 5 by 5:
  \[
  5 \div 5 = 1
  \]

The prime factorization of 375 is \(3 \times 5^3\).

### 2. Determine if 375 is a Perfect Square
A perfect square is a number that can be expressed as the square of an integer.

- The prime factorization of 375 is \(3 \times 5^3\).
- For a number to be a perfect square, all primes in its factorization must have even exponents.
- In \(3 \times 5^3\), the exponents are 1 (for 3) and 3 (for 5), which are not all even.

Therefore, 375 is not a perfect square.

### 3. Calculate the Square Root of 375
To find the square root of 375, we can approximate it:

- Since 375 is not a perfect square, its square root will be an irrational number.
- We know that \(19^2 = 361\) and \(20^2 = 400\).
- Therefore, \(\sqrt{375}\) is between 19 and 20.

Using a calculator, \(\sqrt{375} \approx 19.3649\).

### Final Answer
The prime factorization of 375 is \(3 \times 5^3\). It is not a perfect square, and its approximate square root is 19.3649.
