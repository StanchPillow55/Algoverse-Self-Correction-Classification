==================================================

To solve the sample math problem 375, we need to first understand what the problem is asking. Since the problem is simply stated as "375," it appears that we might be dealing with a specific type of problem related to the number 375. Without additional context, I'll explore a few mathematical aspects of the number 375, such as its factors, properties, and any interesting characteristics.

### Step 1: Prime Factorization
First, let's find the prime factorization of 375.

1. **Divide by 3**: 
   - 375 is divisible by 3 because the sum of its digits (3 + 7 + 5 = 15) is divisible by 3.
   - \( 375 \div 3 = 125 \)

2. **Divide by 5**: 
   - 125 is divisible by 5 because it ends in 5.
   - \( 125 \div 5 = 25 \)

3. **Divide by 5 again**:
   - 25 is divisible by 5.
   - \( 25 \div 5 = 5 \)

4. **Divide by 5 once more**:
   - 5 is a prime number.
   - \( 5 \div 5 = 1 \)

Thus, the prime factorization of 375 is \( 3 \times 5^3 \).

### Step 2: Factors of 375
Using the prime factorization, we can determine all the factors of 375. The factors are combinations of the prime factors raised to their respective powers:

- \( 3^0 \times 5^0 = 1 \)
- \( 3^1 \times 5^0 = 3 \)
- \( 3^0 \times 5^1 = 5 \)
- \( 3^1 \times 5^1 = 15 \)
- \( 3^0 \times 5^2 = 25 \)
- \( 3^1 \times 5^2 = 75 \)
- \( 3^0 \times 5^3 = 125 \)
- \( 3^1 \times 5^3 = 375 \)

So, the factors of 375 are 1, 3, 5, 15, 25, 75, 125, and 375.

### Step 3: Properties of 375
- **Odd Number**: 375 is an odd number because it does not end in an even digit.
- **Composite Number**: 375 is a composite number because it has factors other than 1 and itself.
- **Sum of Digits**: The sum of the digits of 375 is 15.
- **Divisibility**: As we saw, 375 is divisible by 3 and 5.

### Step 4: Interesting Characteristics
- **Perfect Cube**: 375 is not a perfect cube, but it includes a cube in its factorization (\(5^3\)).
- **Arithmetic Properties**: The number 375 can be expressed as a sum of consecutive numbers: \( 124 + 125 + 126 = 375 \).

### Conclusion
Since the problem statement was simply "375," without additional context, we've explored various mathematical properties and characteristics of the number 375. If there was a specific question or operation intended with the number 375, please provide more details. However, based on the exploration above, we have thoroughly analyzed the number 375.

**Final Answer**: The number 375 has the prime factorization \(3 \times 5^3\) and its factors are 1, 3, 5, 15, 25, 75, 125, and 375.
