==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 375," we first need to understand what the problem is asking. However, the problem statement "Sample math problem 375" is not specific enough to determine the exact nature of the problem. Therefore, I'll assume this is a placeholder for a specific math problem that involves the number 375. 

Let's consider a few potential math problems involving the number 375 and solve them:

### Problem 1: Find the Prime Factorization of 375

**Step 1: Divide by the smallest prime number.**

- 375 is an odd number, so it is not divisible by 2.
- The sum of the digits of 375 is \(3 + 7 + 5 = 15\), which is divisible by 3. Therefore, 375 is divisible by 3.

\[ 375 \div 3 = 125 \]

**Step 2: Factor 125.**

- 125 ends in 5, so it is divisible by 5.

\[ 125 \div 5 = 25 \]

- 25 is also divisible by 5.

\[ 25 \div 5 = 5 \]

- Finally, 5 is a prime number.

**Step 3: Write the prime factorization.**

The prime factorization of 375 is:

\[ 375 = 3 \times 5 \times 5 \times 5 = 3 \times 5^3 \]

### Problem 2: Calculate the Sum of the Digits of 375

**Step 1: Identify the digits.**

The digits of 375 are 3, 7, and 5.

**Step 2: Calculate the sum.**

\[ 3 + 7 + 5 = 15 \]

### Problem 3: Determine if 375 is a Perfect Square

**Step 1: Estimate the square root.**

- The square root of 375 is approximately between 19 and 20 because \(19^2 = 361\) and \(20^2 = 400\).

**Step 2: Check perfect square status.**

- Since 375 is not an integer square of any whole number, it is not a perfect square.

### Problem 4: Convert 375 to Binary

**Step 1: Divide by 2 and record remainders.**

- 375 divided by 2 is 187 with a remainder of 1.
- 187 divided by 2 is 93 with a remainder of 1.
- 93 divided by 2 is 46 with a remainder of 1.
- 46 divided by 2 is 23 with a remainder of 0.
- 23 divided by 2 is 11 with a remainder of 1.
- 11 divided by 2 is 5 with a remainder of 1.
- 5 divided by 2 is 2 with a remainder of 1.
- 2 divided by 2 is 1 with a remainder of 0.
- 1 divided by 2 is 0 with a remainder of 1.

**Step 2: Read the binary number from bottom to top.**

The binary representation of 375 is \(101110111\).

### Final Answer

Since the original problem was not specified, I have solved several potential problems involving the number 375. Here are the answers:

1. Prime Factorization: \(3 \times 5^3\)
2. Sum of Digits: 15
3. Perfect Square: No, 375 is not a perfect square.
4. Binary Representation: \(101110111\)

If you have a specific problem involving 375, please provide more details so I can address it directly.
