==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 375," we first need to clarify what the problem is asking. Since "Sample math problem 375" is not a specific question, I'll assume this is a placeholder for a math problem. Let's create a hypothetical problem involving the number 375 and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**
Calculate the sum of the digits of the number 375, then multiply the result by 3. Finally, subtract 15 from the product.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Identify the digits of the number 375:**
   - The number 375 consists of the digits 3, 7, and 5.

2. **Calculate the sum of the digits:**
   - Add the digits together: \(3 + 7 + 5\).
   - Perform the addition: \(3 + 7 = 10\).
   - Add the next digit: \(10 + 5 = 15\).

3. **Multiply the sum by 3:**
   - Take the sum of the digits, which is 15, and multiply it by 3.
   - Perform the multiplication: \(15 \times 3 = 45\).

4. **Subtract 15 from the product:**
   - Take the product, which is 45, and subtract 15.
   - Perform the subtraction: \(45 - 15 = 30\).

**Final Answer:**
The final result after performing all the operations is 30.
