==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample math problem 375," we need to first understand what the problem is asking. However, the problem statement "Sample math problem 375" is not specific enough to determine the exact nature of the problem. Therefore, I will assume that the problem involves performing some mathematical operations on the number 375. Let's explore a few possibilities:

### Possibility 1: Basic Arithmetic Operations

1. **Addition**: Let's add the digits of 375.
   \[
   3 + 7 + 5 = 15
   \]
   The sum of the digits is 15.

2. **Multiplication**: Let's multiply the digits of 375.
   \[
   3 \times 7 \times 5 = 105
   \]
   The product of the digits is 105.

3. **Subtraction**: Let's subtract the digits in sequence.
   \[
   3 - 7 - 5 = -9
   \]
   The result of subtracting the digits in sequence is -9.

4. **Division**: Let's divide the number by one of its digits.
   \[
   375 \div 5 = 75
   \]
   Dividing 375 by 5 gives 75.

### Possibility 2: Factorization

Let's factorize 375 into its prime factors.

1. **Divide by 3**: Since the sum of the digits (3 + 7 + 5 = 15) is divisible by 3, 375 is divisible by 3.
   \[
   375 \div 3 = 125
   \]

2. **Factor 125**: 125 is a power of 5.
   \[
   125 = 5 \times 5 \times 5 = 5^3
   \]

Thus, the prime factorization of 375 is:
\[
375 = 3 \times 5^3
\]

### Possibility 3: Check for Divisibility

Let's check if 375 is divisible by some common numbers.

1. **Divisibility by 2**: 375 is not divisible by 2 because it is odd.

2. **Divisibility by 3**: As calculated earlier, 375 is divisible by 3.

3. **Divisibility by 5**: 375 ends in 5, so it is divisible by 5.

### Conclusion

Without a specific problem statement, we explored various mathematical operations and properties related to the number 375. Here are the key findings:

- The sum of the digits of 375 is 15.
- The product of the digits of 375 is 105.
- The prime factorization of 375 is \(3 \times 5^3\).
- 375 is divisible by 3 and 5.
