Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the sample math problem "375," let's first identify what the problem might be asking. Since "375" is just a number, we need to assume a context or a specific question related to this number. Here are a few possibilities:

1. **Factorization**: Find the prime factorization of 375.
2. **Divisibility**: Determine if 375 is divisible by certain numbers.
3. **Arithmetic Operations**: Perform operations involving 375.
4. **Properties**: Explore properties such as whether 375 is a perfect square, etc.

Let's assume the problem is to find the prime factorization of 375.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

**Step 1: Check for divisibility by 2.**

375 is an odd number, so it is not divisible by 2.

**Step 2: Check for divisibility by 3.**

A number is divisible by 3 if the sum of its digits is divisible by 3. The sum of the digits of 375 is:
\[ 3 + 7 + 5 = 15 \]
Since 15 is divisible by 3, 375 is also divisible by 3.

**Step 3: Divide 375 by 3.**

\[ 375 \div 3 = 125 \]

**Step 4: Check for divisibility of 125 by 5.**

A number is divisible by 5 if it ends in 0 or 5. Since 125 ends in 5, it is divisible by 5.

**Step 5: Divide 125 by 5.**

\[ 125 \div 5 = 25 \]

**Step 6: Check for divisibility of 25 by 5.**

Since 25 ends in 5, it is divisible by 5.

**Step 7: Divide 25 by 5.**

\[ 25 \div 5 = 5 \]

**Step 8: Divide 5 by 5.**

\[ 5 \div 5 = 1 \]

Now, we have completely factored 375 into prime numbers.

### Prime Factorization:

The prime factorization of 375 is:
\[ 375 = 3 \times 5 \times 5 \times 5 \]
or
\[ 375 = 3 \times 5^3 \]

### Final Answer:

The prime factorization of 375 is \( 3 \times 5^3 \).
