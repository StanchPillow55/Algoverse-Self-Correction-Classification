==================================================

To solve the problem "Sample reasoning question 412," we need to first understand what the problem is asking. However, the problem statement provided is not clear or complete. It seems to be a placeholder or a reference to a specific question that is not fully described here.

Since there is no specific mathematical problem or context given, I will demonstrate a general approach to solving a typical math problem by creating an example problem and solving it step by step.

### Example Problem:
Let's assume the problem is as follows:

**Problem:** A company produces 412 widgets in a day. Each widget sells for $15. The cost to produce each widget is $9. Calculate the company's profit for one day.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We need to calculate the profit made by the company in one day.
   - Profit is calculated as the difference between total revenue and total cost.

2. **Identify the Given Information:**
   - Number of widgets produced and sold in a day = 412
   - Selling price per widget = $15
   - Cost price per widget = $9

3. **Calculate Total Revenue:**
   - Total revenue is the total amount of money earned from selling the widgets.
   - Total Revenue = Number of widgets sold × Selling price per widget
   - Total Revenue = 412 × $15

   \[
   \text{Total Revenue} = 412 \times 15 = 6180
   \]

4. **Calculate Total Cost:**
   - Total cost is the total amount of money spent to produce the widgets.
   - Total Cost = Number of widgets produced × Cost price per widget
   - Total Cost = 412 × $9

   \[
   \text{Total Cost} = 412 \times 9 = 3708
   \]

5. **Calculate Profit:**
   - Profit is the difference between total revenue and total cost.
   - Profit = Total Revenue - Total Cost

   \[
   \text{Profit} = 6180 - 3708 = 2472
   \]

6. **State the Final Answer:**
   - The company's profit for one day is $2,472.

This example demonstrates how to approach a typical math problem involving basic arithmetic operations and profit calculation. If you have a specific problem or context for "Sample reasoning question 412," please provide more details, and I will be happy to assist further.
