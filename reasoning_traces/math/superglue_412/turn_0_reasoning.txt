==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 412" entails. Since the problem doesn't provide specific details, I'll create a hypothetical math problem that could be labeled as "Sample reasoning question 412" and solve it step by step.

Let's assume "Sample reasoning question 412" is as follows:

**Problem:**
A company produces two types of widgets: Type A and Type B. The company can produce a maximum of 100 widgets per day. The profit from selling one Type A widget is $5, and the profit from selling one Type B widget is $8. The company wants to maximize its profit. However, due to resource constraints, the production of Type A widgets cannot exceed 60 units per day, and the production of Type B widgets cannot exceed 50 units per day. How many of each type of widget should the company produce to maximize profit?

**Solution:**

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( x \) be the number of Type A widgets produced per day.
   - Let \( y \) be the number of Type B widgets produced per day.

2. **Objective Function:**
   - The profit \( P \) is given by the equation:
     \[
     P = 5x + 8y
     \]
   - We want to maximize \( P \).

3. **Constraints:**
   - The total production cannot exceed 100 widgets:
     \[
     x + y \leq 100
     \]
   - The production of Type A widgets cannot exceed 60:
     \[
     x \leq 60
     \]
   - The production of Type B widgets cannot exceed 50:
     \[
     y \leq 50
     \]
   - Non-negativity constraints:
     \[
     x \geq 0, \quad y \geq 0
     \]

4. **Graphical Solution:**
   - Plot the constraints on a graph with \( x \) on the horizontal axis and \( y \) on the vertical axis.
   - The feasible region is bounded by the lines \( x + y = 100 \), \( x = 60 \), and \( y = 50 \).

5. **Identify Corner Points:**
   - The corner points of the feasible region are found by solving the system of equations formed by the intersection of the constraint lines:
     - Intersection of \( x + y = 100 \) and \( x = 60 \):
       \[
       60 + y = 100 \implies y = 40 \quad \Rightarrow \quad (60, 40)
       \]
     - Intersection of \( x + y = 100 \) and \( y = 50 \):
       \[
       x + 50 = 100 \implies x = 50 \quad \Rightarrow \quad (50, 50)
       \]
     - Intersection of \( x = 60 \) and \( y = 0 \):
       \[
       (60, 0)
       \]
     - Intersection of \( y = 50 \) and \( x = 0 \):
       \[
       (0, 50)
       \]

6. **Evaluate Objective Function at Each Corner Point:**
   - \( P(60, 40) = 5(60) + 8(40) = 300 + 320 = 620 \)
   - \( P(50, 50) = 5(50) + 8(50) = 250 + 400 = 650 \)
   - \( P(60, 0) = 5(60) + 8(0) = 300 \)
   - \( P(0, 50) = 5(0) + 8(50) = 400 \)

7. **Determine Maximum Profit:**
   - The maximum profit is \( 650 \), which occurs at the point \( (50, 50) \).

**Final Answer:**
The company should produce 50 Type A widgets and 50 Type B widgets per day to maximize its profit, resulting in a maximum profit of $650.
