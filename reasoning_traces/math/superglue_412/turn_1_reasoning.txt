==================================================

It seems like there might be a misunderstanding or a placeholder text in your question. "Sample reasoning question 412" doesn't provide specific details about the math problem you're asking for help with. However, I can guide you through a generic approach to solving math problems by explaining the steps typically involved in problem-solving. If you have a specific math problem in mind, please provide the details, and I'll be happy to help with that.

### Generic Math Problem-Solving Approach

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - Read the problem carefully.
   - Identify what is being asked.
   - Determine what information is given and what is missing.

2. **Devise a Plan:**
   - Consider possible strategies to solve the problem (e.g., drawing a diagram, creating an equation, using a formula).
   - Choose the most appropriate method based on the problem type.

3. **Carry Out the Plan:**
   - Execute the chosen strategy step by step.
   - Perform calculations carefully.
   - Keep track of units and ensure consistency.

4. **Check Your Work:**
   - Review each step to ensure accuracy.
   - Verify that the solution makes sense in the context of the problem.
   - Check calculations for errors.

5. **State the Final Answer:**
   - Clearly present the solution.
   - Include units if applicable.
   - Ensure the answer addresses the question asked.

### Example Problem

Let's consider a simple example to illustrate these steps:

**Problem:** Solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).

**Step 1: Understand the Problem**
- We need to find the value of \( x \) that satisfies the equation.

**Step 2: Devise a Plan**
- We can solve this linear equation by isolating \( x \).

**Step 3: Carry Out the Plan**
- Start by subtracting 3 from both sides of the equation:
  \[
  2x + 3 - 3 = 11 - 3
  \]
  \[
  2x = 8
  \]
- Next, divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( x \):
  \[
  x = \frac{8}{2}
  \]
  \[
  x = 4
  \]

**Step 4: Check Your Work**
- Substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation to verify:
  \[
  2(4) + 3 = 11
  \]
  \[
  8 + 3 = 11
  \]
  - The left side equals the right side, confirming our solution is correct.

**Step 5: State the Final Answer**
- The solution to the equation is \( x = 4 \).

If you have a specific problem or need further assistance, please provide more details, and I'll be glad to help!
