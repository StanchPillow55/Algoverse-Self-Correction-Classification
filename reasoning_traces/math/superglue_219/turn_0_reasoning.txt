==================================================

To solve a math problem, it's important to first understand the problem statement. However, the question you've provided, "Sample reasoning question 219," is not specific enough for me to determine what the problem is. It seems like a placeholder or reference to a specific problem that hasn't been fully described here.

To proceed, I need more information about the problem. For example, if "Sample reasoning question 219" refers to a specific math problem in a textbook or a test, please provide the full text of the problem. This might include details such as:

- The type of math problem (e.g., algebra, geometry, calculus, etc.)
- Any given numbers, equations, or figures
- What specifically you are being asked to find or solve

Once you provide the full details of the problem, I can work through it step by step, showing all calculations and reasoning, and provide a final answer.
