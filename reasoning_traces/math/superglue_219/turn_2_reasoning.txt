==================================================

To solve the problem effectively, I need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 219" entails. However, since the problem statement is not provided, I'll demonstrate a general approach to solving a typical math problem by outlining the steps and reasoning involved. 

Let's assume a hypothetical math problem for demonstration purposes:

**Problem:**
Solve for \( x \) in the equation: \( 3x + 5 = 20 \).

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   We need to find the value of \( x \) that satisfies the equation \( 3x + 5 = 20 \).

2. **Isolate the Variable:**
   To solve for \( x \), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We start by eliminating the constant term on the left side of the equation.

   \[
   3x + 5 = 20
   \]

   Subtract 5 from both sides to remove the constant:

   \[
   3x + 5 - 5 = 20 - 5
   \]

   Simplifying both sides gives:

   \[
   3x = 15
   \]

3. **Solve for \( x \):**
   Now, divide both sides by 3 to solve for \( x \).

   \[
   \frac{3x}{3} = \frac{15}{3}
   \]

   Simplifying both sides gives:

   \[
   x = 5
   \]

4. **Verify the Solution:**
   Substitute \( x = 5 \) back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies the equation.

   \[
   3(5) + 5 = 20
   \]

   Simplifying the left side:

   \[
   15 + 5 = 20
   \]

   \[
   20 = 20
   \]

   Since both sides of the equation are equal, \( x = 5 \) is indeed the correct solution.

5. **State the Final Answer:**
   The solution to the equation \( 3x + 5 = 20 \) is \( x = 5 \).

This structured approach—understanding the problem, isolating the variable, solving for the variable, verifying the solution, and stating the final answer—ensures clarity and accuracy in solving math problems. If you have a specific problem or need further assistance, please provide more details.
