Question ID: superglue_219
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we first need to understand what "Sample reasoning question 219" refers to. Since the problem statement does not provide specific details about the question, I'll demonstrate a general approach to solving a reasoning problem, which often involves logical thinking, pattern recognition, or mathematical calculations.

Let's assume "Sample reasoning question 219" is a hypothetical math problem involving pattern recognition. Hereâ€™s how we might approach solving it:

### Step 1: Identify the Pattern or Rule
Assume the problem involves a sequence of numbers, and we need to find the next number in the sequence. A common type of reasoning question involves identifying the pattern in a sequence.

Example Sequence: 2, 4, 8, 16, ...

**Analysis:**
- The sequence appears to be doubling each time.
- 2 * 2 = 4
- 4 * 2 = 8
- 8 * 2 = 16

### Step 2: Apply the Pattern
Based on the identified pattern (doubling), we can predict the next number in the sequence.

- 16 * 2 = 32

### Step 3: Verify the Pattern
To ensure the pattern holds, we should verify it with all given numbers in the sequence.

- Starting with 2, each subsequent number is obtained by multiplying the previous number by 2.
- The pattern is consistent with all numbers provided.

### Step 4: State the Final Answer
The next number in the sequence is 32.

### Conclusion
Without specific details about "Sample reasoning question 219," we assumed a typical reasoning problem involving a numerical sequence. We identified a pattern of doubling and applied it to find the next number. The final answer, based on our assumption, is 32.

If "Sample reasoning question 219" refers to a different type of problem, please provide additional details or context so I can tailor the solution accordingly.
