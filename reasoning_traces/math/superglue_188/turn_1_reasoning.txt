   - Carefully read the problem statement.
   - Identify what is being asked.
   - Note any given data, conditions, or constraints.

2. **Break Down the Problem:**
   - Divide the problem into smaller, manageable parts.
   - Determine if there are any patterns or relationships.

3. **Develop a Strategy:**
   - Consider different approaches to solve the problem (e.g., logical deduction, algebraic manipulation, visualization).
   - Choose the most efficient method based on the problem type.

4. **Execute the Plan:**
   - Apply the chosen method step by step.
   - Perform calculations carefully.
   - Keep track of your reasoning and ensure each step logically follows from the previous one.

5. **Review and Verify:**
   - Check your work for errors or omissions.
   - Verify that your solution satisfies all the conditions of the problem.
   - Consider alternative solutions if applicable.

6. **State the Final Answer:**
   - Clearly present your final answer.
   - Ensure it directly addresses the question asked.

### Example Problem and Solution

Since I don't have the specific details of "Sample reasoning question 188," I'll provide an example problem and solution to illustrate the process:

**Example Problem:**
A train travels from City A to City B at a speed of 60 km/h and returns from City B to City A at a speed of 40 km/h. What is the average speed of the train for the entire journey?

**Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We need to find the average speed for the round trip.

2. **Break Down the Problem:**
   - Let the distance between City A and City B be \(d\) km.

3. **Develop a Strategy:**
   - Use the formula for average speed: 
     \[
     \text{Average Speed} = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Total Time}}
     \]

4. **Execute the Plan:**
   - Total distance for the round trip is \(2d\).
   - Time taken to travel from A to B is \(\frac{d}{60}\) hours.
   - Time taken to travel from B to A is \(\frac{d}{40}\) hours.
   - Total time for the round trip is:
     \[
     \frac{d}{60} + \frac{d}{40} = \frac{2d}{120} + \frac{3d}{120} = \frac{5d}{120} = \frac{d}{24} \text{ hours}
     \]
   - Average speed is:
     \[
     \frac{2d}{\frac{d}{24}} = 2d \times \frac{24}{d} = 48 \text{ km/h}
     \]

5. **Review and Verify:**
   - The calculations are correct, and the solution satisfies the problem conditions.

6. **State the Final Answer:**
   - The average speed of the train for the entire journey is 48 km/h.

Once you have the specific details of "Sample reasoning question 188," you can apply this structured approach to find the solution. If you can provide more information or context about the problem, I'd be happy to help further!
