==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 188" entails. Since there is no specific mathematical problem provided, I will create a sample reasoning question and solve it step by step.

**Sample Reasoning Question:**

A train travels from City A to City B, a distance of 300 kilometers. The train travels at a constant speed of 60 kilometers per hour. After reaching City B, the train immediately returns to City A at a speed of 80 kilometers per hour. Calculate the total time taken for the round trip.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Calculate the time taken to travel from City A to City B:**

   - Distance from City A to City B = 300 kilometers
   - Speed from City A to City B = 60 kilometers per hour

   Using the formula for time, \( \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \):

   \[
   \text{Time from A to B} = \frac{300 \text{ km}}{60 \text{ km/h}} = 5 \text{ hours}
   \]

2. **Calculate the time taken to travel from City B back to City A:**

   - Distance from City B to City A = 300 kilometers (same as the distance from A to B)
   - Speed from City B to City A = 80 kilometers per hour

   Again, using the formula for time:

   \[
   \text{Time from B to A} = \frac{300 \text{ km}}{80 \text{ km/h}} = \frac{300}{80} \text{ hours} = \frac{15}{4} \text{ hours} = 3.75 \text{ hours}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total time for the round trip:**

   - Total time = Time from A to B + Time from B to A

   \[
   \text{Total time} = 5 \text{ hours} + 3.75 \text{ hours} = 8.75 \text{ hours}
   \]

**Final Answer:**

The total time taken for the round trip is 8.75 hours.
