==================================================

To solve the problem, we first need to understand what "Sample reasoning question 188" refers to. Since the problem statement does not provide specific details about the question, I'll demonstrate a general approach to solving a reasoning-based math problem. Let's assume a hypothetical problem and solve it step by step.

**Hypothetical Problem:**

"Two trains are traveling towards each other from two towns that are 300 miles apart. Train A is traveling at a speed of 60 miles per hour, and Train B is traveling at a speed of 40 miles per hour. How long will it take for the two trains to meet?"

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We have two trains moving towards each other.
   - The distance between the two towns is 300 miles.
   - Train A's speed is 60 mph.
   - Train B's speed is 40 mph.
   - We need to find the time it takes for the trains to meet.

2. **Set Up the Equation:**
   - Since the trains are moving towards each other, their relative speed is the sum of their individual speeds.
   - Relative speed = Speed of Train A + Speed of Train B = 60 mph + 40 mph = 100 mph.

3. **Calculate the Time:**
   - Time is calculated by dividing the total distance by the relative speed.
   - Time = Distance / Relative Speed = 300 miles / 100 mph = 3 hours.

4. **Verify the Solution:**
   - In 3 hours, Train A will cover a distance of 60 mph * 3 hours = 180 miles.
   - In 3 hours, Train B will cover a distance of 40 mph * 3 hours = 120 miles.
   - The sum of the distances covered by both trains is 180 miles + 120 miles = 300 miles, which matches the initial distance between the towns.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The trains will meet after 3 hours.

**Final Answer:**
The two trains will meet after 3 hours.
