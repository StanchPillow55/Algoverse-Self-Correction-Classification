Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we first need to understand what "Sample reasoning question 188" refers to. Since the problem statement doesn't provide any specific details about the question, I'll demonstrate a general approach to solving a typical math problem by breaking it down into steps. 

Let's assume "Sample reasoning question 188" is a math problem involving algebra. Here's how we might approach solving a typical algebraic equation:

### Step 1: Understand the Problem
Assume the problem is to solve the equation for \( x \):
\[ 2x + 3 = 11 \]

### Step 2: Isolate the Variable
To solve for \( x \), we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. We can do this by performing inverse operations.

1. **Subtract 3 from both sides**: 
   \[
   2x + 3 - 3 = 11 - 3
   \]
   Simplifying both sides gives:
   \[
   2x = 8
   \]

2. **Divide both sides by 2**:
   \[
   \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{8}{2}
   \]
   Simplifying gives:
   \[
   x = 4
   \]

### Step 3: Verify the Solution
Substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation to ensure it satisfies the equation:
\[ 
2(4) + 3 = 11 
\]
\[ 
8 + 3 = 11 
\]
\[ 
11 = 11 
\]
Since both sides of the equation are equal, our solution \( x = 4 \) is correct.

### Step 4: State the Final Answer
The solution to the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \) is \( x = 4 \).

This is a general approach to solving a simple algebraic equation. If "Sample reasoning question 188" refers to a different type of problem, please provide more details or context so I can tailor the solution to that specific problem.
