==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to carefully analyze the information given and apply logical reasoning to arrive at a solution. Since the problem statement "Sample reasoning question 261" is quite vague and doesn't provide specific details, let's assume a hypothetical reasoning problem to demonstrate the process.

Let's consider a classic logic puzzle:

**Problem:**
There are three boxes. One contains apples, one contains oranges, and one contains both apples and oranges. Each box is labeled, but all labels are incorrect. Your task is to determine the contents of each box by picking one fruit from one box.

**Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We have three boxes: Box A, Box B, and Box C.
   - Each box is labeled incorrectly.
   - Labels: Box A (Apples), Box B (Oranges), Box C (Apples and Oranges).
   - Our goal is to correctly identify the contents of each box.

2. **Plan the Solution:**
   - Since all labels are incorrect, the box labeled "Apples and Oranges" cannot contain both fruits. It must contain only apples or only oranges.
   - We will pick one fruit from the box labeled "Apples and Oranges."

3. **Execute the Plan:**
   - Suppose we pick a fruit from the box labeled "Apples and Oranges," and we get an apple.
   - This means the box labeled "Apples and Oranges" actually contains only apples.
   - Now, we know:
     - Box C (labeled "Apples and Oranges") contains only apples.

4. **Determine the Contents of the Other Boxes:**
   - Since Box C contains only apples, the box labeled "Apples" (Box A) must contain something other than apples. It cannot contain only apples, so it must contain only oranges.
   - This leaves the box labeled "Oranges" (Box B) to contain both apples and oranges.

5. **Verify the Solution:**
   - Box A (labeled "Apples") contains only oranges.
   - Box B (labeled "Oranges") contains both apples and oranges.
   - Box C (labeled "Apples and Oranges") contains only apples.
   - All labels are incorrect, satisfying the problem's condition.

**Final Answer:**
- Box A contains only oranges.
- Box B contains both apples and oranges.
- Box C contains only apples.

This solution demonstrates logical reasoning by systematically eliminating possibilities based on the given constraints and verifying the results.
