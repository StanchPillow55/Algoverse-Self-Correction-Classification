==================================================

To solve the problem, I need more information about "Sample reasoning question 261." Since the question is not provided, I'll demonstrate how to approach a typical math reasoning problem by creating a sample problem and solving it step by step.

### Sample Problem:
A train travels from City A to City B at a speed of 60 miles per hour. It takes 3 hours to reach City B. On the return trip, the train travels at a speed of 40 miles per hour. How long does the return trip take?

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Determine the Distance from City A to City B:**

   The formula for distance is:
   \[
   \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time}
   \]

   For the trip from City A to City B:
   - Speed = 60 miles per hour
   - Time = 3 hours

   \[
   \text{Distance} = 60 \, \text{miles/hour} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 180 \, \text{miles}
   \]

   So, the distance between City A and City B is 180 miles.

2. **Calculate the Time for the Return Trip:**

   For the return trip, we know:
   - Distance = 180 miles (same as the trip from City A to City B)
   - Speed = 40 miles per hour

   We need to find the time it takes for the return trip. Using the formula:
   \[
   \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}}
   \]

   \[
   \text{Time} = \frac{180 \, \text{miles}}{40 \, \text{miles/hour}} = 4.5 \, \text{hours}
   \]

3. **Conclusion:**

   The return trip from City B to City A takes 4.5 hours.

### Final Answer:
The return trip takes 4.5 hours.
