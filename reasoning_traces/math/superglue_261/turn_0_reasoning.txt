==================================================

It seems like you've referenced a "Sample reasoning question 261," but without specific details or context, I can't directly address that particular problem. However, I can guide you through a generic approach to solving math problems, which you can apply to your specific question once you have the details. Here's a step-by-step method for tackling math problems:

### Step 1: Understand the Problem
- **Read the problem carefully.** Make sure you understand what is being asked. Identify the key information and what the problem is asking you to find.
- **Identify knowns and unknowns.** Write down what information is given and what you need to find.

### Step 2: Devise a Plan
- **Choose a strategy.** Depending on the problem, you might use strategies such as drawing a diagram, creating a table, writing an equation, or breaking the problem into smaller parts.
- **Consider similar problems.** Think about whether you've solved similar problems before and how you approached them.

### Step 3: Carry Out the Plan
- **Execute your strategy.** Carefully perform the calculations or logical steps you planned.
- **Show all work.** Write down each step clearly to avoid mistakes and to make it easier to review your work.

### Step 4: Review/Check Your Work
- **Verify each step.** Go through your calculations to ensure there are no errors.
- **Check your answer.** Make sure your solution makes sense in the context of the problem. If possible, use a different method to verify your answer.

### Example Problem
Let's apply this approach to a simple example problem:

**Problem:** Solve for \( x \) in the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \).

#### Step 1: Understand the Problem
- We need to find the value of \( x \) that makes the equation true.

#### Step 2: Devise a Plan
- We will isolate \( x \) by performing algebraic operations.

#### Step 3: Carry Out the Plan
1. Start with the equation:  
   \[
   2x + 3 = 11
   \]
2. Subtract 3 from both sides to isolate the term with \( x \):  
   \[
   2x + 3 - 3 = 11 - 3
   \]
   \[
   2x = 8
   \]
3. Divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( x \):  
   \[
   \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{8}{2}
   \]
   \[
   x = 4
   \]

#### Step 4: Review/Check Your Work
- Substitute \( x = 4 \) back into the original equation to check:  
  \[
  2(4) + 3 = 8 + 3 = 11
  \]
- The left side equals the right side, confirming our solution is correct.

### Final Answer
The solution to the equation \( 2x + 3 = 11 \) is \( x = 4 \).

Apply this structured approach to your specific problem, "Sample reasoning question 261," once you have the details. If you provide more information about the problem, I can offer a more tailored solution.
