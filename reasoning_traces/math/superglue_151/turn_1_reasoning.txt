==================================================

To solve this problem, I need more specific information about "Sample reasoning question 151." Since the question is not provided, I'll demonstrate how to approach a typical math reasoning problem step by step. If you have a specific problem in mind, please provide the details.

Let's consider a sample math reasoning problem:

**Problem:**  
A farmer has a rectangular field that is 100 meters long and 60 meters wide. He wants to divide the field into smaller rectangular plots, each with an area of 150 square meters. How many such plots can he create?

**Step-by-step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We have a rectangular field with dimensions 100 meters by 60 meters.
   - We need to divide this field into smaller rectangles, each with an area of 150 square meters.

2. **Calculate the Total Area of the Field:**
   - The area of a rectangle is given by the formula: Area = Length × Width.
   - For the field: Area = 100 meters × 60 meters = 6000 square meters.

3. **Determine the Number of Smaller Plots:**
   - Each smaller plot has an area of 150 square meters.
   - To find the number of plots, divide the total area of the field by the area of one plot.
   - Number of plots = Total Area of Field / Area of One Plot = 6000 square meters / 150 square meters.

4. **Perform the Division:**
   - 6000 ÷ 150 = 40.

5. **Verify the Calculation:**
   - Multiply the number of plots by the area of one plot to ensure it equals the total area.
   - 40 plots × 150 square meters/plot = 6000 square meters, which matches the total area of the field.

6. **Conclusion:**
   - The farmer can create 40 smaller plots, each with an area of 150 square meters.

**Final Answer:**
The farmer can create 40 plots.
