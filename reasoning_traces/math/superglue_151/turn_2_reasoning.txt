Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to first understand what "Sample reasoning question 151" entails. However, since the problem statement is not provided, I'll demonstrate a general approach to solving a typical math problem by walking through a hypothetical example. Let's assume the problem is as follows:

**Problem:**  
Calculate the area of a triangle with a base of 10 units and a height of 5 units.

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Understand the Formula:**
   The area \( A \) of a triangle can be calculated using the formula:
   \[
   A = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height}
   \]

2. **Identify the Given Values:**
   From the problem, we know:
   - Base \( b = 10 \) units
   - Height \( h = 5 \) units

3. **Substitute the Values into the Formula:**
   Plug the given values into the area formula:
   \[
   A = \frac{1}{2} \times 10 \times 5
   \]

4. **Perform the Multiplication:**
   First, multiply the base and the height:
   \[
   10 \times 5 = 50
   \]

5. **Calculate the Area:**
   Now, multiply the result by \(\frac{1}{2}\):
   \[
   A = \frac{1}{2} \times 50 = 25
   \]

6. **State the Final Answer:**
   The area of the triangle is 25 square units.

**Final Answer:**  
The area of the triangle is 25 square units.

This example illustrates a structured approach to solving a math problem by understanding the formula, identifying given values, substituting them into the formula, performing calculations, and stating the final answer. If you have a specific problem in mind (like "Sample reasoning question 151"), please provide the details, and I can work through that specific problem for you.
