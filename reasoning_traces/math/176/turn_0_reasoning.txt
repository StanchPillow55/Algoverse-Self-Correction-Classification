To determine how many kilograms of sugar the store sells every week, we can follow these steps:

1. **Identify the amount of sugar sold in grams**: 
   The store sells 20 packets of sugar, and each packet contains 100 grams. To find the total amount of sugar sold in grams, we multiply the number of packets by the grams per packet:

   \[
   \text{Total grams} = \text{Number of packets} \times \text{Grams per packet}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total grams} = 20 \times 100 = 2000 \text{ grams}
   \]

2. **Convert grams to kilograms**: 
   We know that 1 kilogram is equal to 1000 grams. To convert the total grams to kilograms, we divide the total grams by 1000:

   \[
   \text{Total kilograms} = \frac{\text{Total grams}}{1000}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total kilograms} = \frac{2000}{1000} = 2 \text{ kilograms}
   \]

3. **Final answer**: 
   The store sells a total of 2 kilograms of sugar every week.

Thus, the final answer is:

\[
\boxed{2} \text{ kilograms}
\]
