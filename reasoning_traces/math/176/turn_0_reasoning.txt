To solve this problem, we need to determine how many kilograms of sugar the store sells every week, given that it sells 20 packets of 100 grams each.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Understand the units involved:**
   - Each packet contains 100 grams of sugar.
   - There are 20 packets sold every week.

2. **Calculate the total grams of sugar sold per week:**
   - Since each packet is 100 grams and there are 20 packets, we multiply the number of packets by the grams per packet:
     \[
     \text{Total grams per week} = 20 \text{ packets} \times 100 \text{ grams/packet} = 2000 \text{ grams}
     \]

3. **Convert grams to kilograms:**
   - We know that 1 kilogram equals 1000 grams. To convert grams to kilograms, we divide the total grams by 1000:
     \[
     \text{Total kilograms per week} = \frac{2000 \text{ grams}}{1000 \text{ grams/kilogram}} = 2 \text{ kilograms}
     \]

Thus, the store sells 2 kilograms of sugar every week.

**Final Answer:**
The store sells 2 kilograms of sugar every week.
