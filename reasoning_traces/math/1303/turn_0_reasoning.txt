==================================================

To solve the problem, we will break it down into several steps.

### Step 1: Calculate the total number of holes dug by the dog.

Nate's dog digs 6 holes a day for 14 days. We can calculate the total number of holes dug as follows:

\[
\text{Total holes dug} = \text{holes per day} \times \text{number of days}
\]
\[
\text{Total holes dug} = 6 \, \text{holes/day} \times 14 \, \text{days} = 84 \, \text{holes}
\]

### Step 2: Determine the net number of holes after Nate starts filling them in.

When Nate returns, he starts filling in holes at a rate of 9 holes per day. However, the dog continues to dig 6 new holes every night. Therefore, the net number of holes filled each day can be calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Net holes filled per day} = \text{holes filled by Nate} - \text{holes dug by the dog}
\]
\[
\text{Net holes filled per day} = 9 \, \text{holes/day} - 6 \, \text{holes/day} = 3 \, \text{holes/day}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the number of days needed to fill all the holes.

Now we know that there are 84 holes to fill and Nate can fill in a net of 3 holes per day. We can calculate the number of days required to fill all the holes:

\[
\text{Number of days to fill all holes} = \frac{\text{Total holes}}{\text{Net holes filled per day}}
\]
\[
\text{Number of days to fill all holes} = \frac{84 \, \text{holes}}{3 \, \text{holes/day}} = 28 \, \text{days}
\]

### Step 4: Convert days into weeks.

To find out how many weeks it takes to fill in all the holes, we convert days into weeks:

\[
\text{Number of weeks} = \frac{\text{Number of days}}{7 \, \text{days/week}}
\]
\[
\text{Number of weeks} = \frac{28 \, \text{days}}{7 \, \text{days/week}} = 4 \, \text{weeks}
\]

### Final Answer

It takes Nate **4 weeks** to fill in all the holes.
