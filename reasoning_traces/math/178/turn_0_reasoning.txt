==================================================

To solve the problem, we will first define the number of crabs each person has based on the information given.

1. **Identify the number of crabs Bo has:**
   - According to the problem, Bo has 40 crabs.
   \[
   \text{Bo's crabs} = 40
   \]

2. **Determine the number of crabs Monic has:**
   - The problem states that Monic has 4 fewer crabs than Bo. Therefore, we can calculate Monic's crabs as follows:
   \[
   \text{Monic's crabs} = \text{Bo's crabs} - 4 = 40 - 4 = 36
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of crabs Rani has:**
   - The problem also states that Rani has ten more crabs than Monic. We can find Rani's crabs using the number of crabs Monic has:
   \[
   \text{Rani's crabs} = \text{Monic's crabs} + 10 = 36 + 10 = 46
   \]

4. **Calculate the total number of crabs the three have together:**
   - Now that we have the number of crabs for each person, we can find the total by adding them together:
   \[
   \text{Total crabs} = \text{Rani's crabs} + \text{Monic's crabs} + \text{Bo's crabs}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total crabs} = 46 + 36 + 40
   \]

5. **Perform the addition:**
   - First, add Rani's and Monic's crabs:
   \[
   46 + 36 = 82
   \]
   - Then, add Bo's crabs:
   \[
   82 + 40 = 122
   \]

Thus, the total number of crabs that Rani, Monic, and Bo have together is:
\[
\boxed{122}
\]
