==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of Simon's purchase, apply the 10% discount, and then determine how much change he receives from a $50 bill.

**Step 1: Calculate the cost of each type of flower.**

- **Pansies:** Simon bought 5 pansies at $2.50 each.
  \[
  \text{Cost of pansies} = 5 \times 2.50 = 12.50
  \]

- **Hydrangea:** Simon bought 1 hydrangea at $12.50.
  \[
  \text{Cost of hydrangea} = 12.50
  \]

- **Petunias:** Simon bought 5 petunias at $1.00 each.
  \[
  \text{Cost of petunias} = 5 \times 1.00 = 5.00
  \]

**Step 2: Calculate the total cost before the discount.**

Add the costs of all the flowers:
\[
\text{Total cost before discount} = 12.50 + 12.50 + 5.00 = 30.00
\]

**Step 3: Apply the 10% discount.**

The discount is 10% of the total cost before the discount:
\[
\text{Discount} = 0.10 \times 30.00 = 3.00
\]

Subtract the discount from the total cost to find the total cost after the discount:
\[
\text{Total cost after discount} = 30.00 - 3.00 = 27.00
\]

**Step 4: Calculate the change from a $50 bill.**

Simon paid with a $50 bill, so the change he receives is:
\[
\text{Change} = 50.00 - 27.00 = 23.00
\]

**Final Answer:**

Simon will receive $23.00 in change.
