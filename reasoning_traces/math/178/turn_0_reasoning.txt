To determine how much change Simon would receive after his purchase, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total cost of the flowers before the discount.**
   - **Pansies:** Simon bought 5 pansies at $2.50 each.
     \[
     \text{Cost of pansies} = 5 \times 2.50 = 12.50
     \]
   - **Hydrangea:** Simon bought 1 hydrangea at $12.50.
     \[
     \text{Cost of hydrangea} = 12.50
     \]
   - **Petunias:** Simon bought 5 petunias at $1.00 each.
     \[
     \text{Cost of petunias} = 5 \times 1.00 = 5.00
     \]

2. **Add the costs together to find the total before the discount.**
   \[
   \text{Total cost before discount} = \text{Cost of pansies} + \text{Cost of hydrangea} + \text{Cost of petunias}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total cost before discount} = 12.50 + 12.50 + 5.00 = 30.00
   \]

3. **Calculate the discount.**
   - The garden center is offering a 10% discount on the total purchase.
   \[
   \text{Discount} = 10\% \text{ of } 30.00 = 0.10 \times 30.00 = 3.00
   \]

4. **Calculate the total cost after the discount.**
   \[
   \text{Total cost after discount} = \text{Total cost before discount} - \text{Discount}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total cost after discount} = 30.00 - 3.00 = 27.00
   \]

5. **Determine how much change Simon receives.**
   - Simon paid with a $50 bill.
   \[
   \text{Change} = \text{Amount paid} - \text{Total cost after discount}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Change} = 50.00 - 27.00 = 23.00
   \]

Thus, the final answer is that Simon would receive **$23.00** in change.
