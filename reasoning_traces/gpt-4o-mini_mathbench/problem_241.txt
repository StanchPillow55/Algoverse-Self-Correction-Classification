Question: Dolly has two books. Pandora has one. If both Dolly and Pandora read each others' books as well as their own, how many books will they collectively read by the end?

Reference Answer: There are 2 + 1 = <<2+1=3>>3 books in total.
Dolly and Pandora both read all 3 books, so 3 books/person x 2 people = <<3*2=6>>6 books total
