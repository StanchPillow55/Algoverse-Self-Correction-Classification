Question: The bananas at the supermarket cost $0.80 each, or a bunch for $3.00.  Jenny buys 10 bunches that average 4 bananas per bunch. How much money, in dollars, did she save by buying the bananas in bunches instead of individually?

Reference Answer: Ten bunches makes 10*3=$<<10*3=30>>30.
There are 10*4=<<10*4=40>>40 bananas.
40 bananas would cost 40*0.80=$<<40*0.80=32>>32 individually.
She saved 32-30=<<32-30=2>>2 dollars
