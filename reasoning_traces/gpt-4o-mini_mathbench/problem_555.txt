Question: John plans to save money from working.  He gets paid $2 per hour and works 5 hours a day for 4 days a week.  If he wants to save $80 how many weeks will it take him?

Reference Answer: He gets paid 2*5=$<<2*5=10>>10 a day.
So he gets paid 10*4=$<<10*4=40>>40 a week.
That means it would take 80/40=<<80/40=2>>2 weeks to save up the money.
