Question: Martha is knitting winter wear for her 3 grandchildren. They're triplets, so they're all the same size. She wants to make a hat, scarf, sweater, mittens, and socks for each of them. It takes 2 skeins of wool to make a hat, 4 for a scarf, 12 for a sweater, 1 for a pair of mittens, and 2 for a pair of socks. How many skeins of wool will she need to buy?

Reference Answer: A full outfit for each child will require 2 skeins per hat + 4 skeins per scarf + 12 skeins per sweater + 1 skein per pair of mittens + 2 skeins per pair of socks = <<2+4+12+1+2=21>>21 skeins of wool.
So to knit outfits for all of her grandchildren, she will need 3 * 21 = <<3*21=63>>63 skeins of wool.
