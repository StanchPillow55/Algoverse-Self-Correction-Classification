Question: Hannah has a mental breakdown while studying for finals and starts smashing windows in the high school's parking lot. She smashes a quarter of the students' cars' windows and 3/4ths of the teachers' cars' windows. If there are 64 students' cars with four windows each and 32 teachers' cars with two windows each, how many windows does Hannah smash?

Reference Answer: First find how many student cars Hannah smashed: 64 cars * 1/4 = <<64*1/4=16>>16 cars
Then find how many teacher cars Hannah smashed: 32 cars * 3/4 = <<32*3/4=24>>24 cars
Then find how many windows the students' cars had smashed: 16 cars * 4 windows/car = <<16*4=64>>64 windows
Then find how many windows the teachers' cars had smashed: 24 cars * 2 windows/car = <<24*2=48>>48 windows
Then add the number of students' and teachers' windows smashed to find the total number of windows smashed: 64 windows + 48 windows = <<64+48=112>>112 windows
