Question: Charisma works for 8 hours every day.  She has a timer to remind her to get up and walk for 5 minutes every hour sheâ€™s at work.  After 5 days at the office, how many minutes has she walked?

Reference Answer: She works 8 hours every day and she sets a timer to walk 5 minutes every hour for a total of 8*5 = <<8*5=40>>40 minutes of walking
If she walks 40 minutes a day while at the office then over 5 days she walks 40*5 = <<40*5=200>>200 minutes
