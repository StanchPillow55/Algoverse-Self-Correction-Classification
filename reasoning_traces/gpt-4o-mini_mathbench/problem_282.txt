Question: Maddy is buying pizza for her cousin's soccer game. There are 12 team members and 3 coaches. Each team member brings 2 guests. A pizza will serve 3 people. If each pizza costs $15, how many dollars will Maddy spend?

Reference Answer: Maddy is buying pizza for 12 + 3 + (12*2) = <<12+3+12*2=39>>39 people.
Thus, she needs to buy 39/3=<<39/3=13>>13 pizzas.
Thus, she will spend $15*13=$<<15*13=195>>195.
