Question: A company produces chocolate in bars. In one day, it can produce 5000 bars. The company sells all the produced bars for $2 per bar. How much money will the company receive for selling produced chocolate bars during two weeks?

Reference Answer: During two weeks the company can produce 14 * 5000 = <<14*5000=70000>>70000.
If the price of 1 bar is $2, the company will be able to make 70000 * 2 = $<<70000*2=140000>>140000 from the sales.
