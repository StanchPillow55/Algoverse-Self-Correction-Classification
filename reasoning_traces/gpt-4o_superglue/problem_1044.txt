Question: On the first day of school, Ava sees that her friends Cole and Xavier have both grown a lot over the summer. Xavier was 4 feet tall and grew 3 inches. Cole was 50 inches tall and grew 2 inches over the summer. What is the difference between Cole and Xavier’s height now?

Reference Answer: First, we need to be sure we are comparing the same units, so let’s convert feet into inches. There are 12 inches in 1 foot. So Xavier was 12 x 4 = <<12*4=48>>48 inches tall.
Xavier grew to be 48 + 3 = <<48+3=51>>51 inches.
Cole grew to be 50 + 2 = <<50+2=52>>52 inches.
The difference between Cole and Xavier’s height is now 52 – 51 = <<52-51=1>>1 inch.
