Question: John and DeSean bought a bag of marshmallows to make s'mores together. The bag has 35 marshmallows. Each S'more uses one marshmallow. If John makes 9 S'mores, DeSean makes 9 S'mores, and they dropped 3 marshmallows on the ground, how many S'mores can each kid have with the marshmallows left in the bag?

Reference Answer: They used up 21 marshmallows because 9 plus 9 plus 3 equals <<9+9+3=21>>21.
There are 14 marshmallows left because 35 minus 21 equals <<35-21=14>>14.
They can each make 7 more because 14 divided by 2 equals <<14/2=7>>7.
