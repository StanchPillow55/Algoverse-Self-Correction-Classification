Question: Martha's cat is 5 times faster than her turtle. If the cat can run 15 feet/second, how many feet can her turtle crawl in 40 seconds?

Reference Answer: First find the speed of the turtle by dividing the cat's speed by 5: 15 feet/second / 5 = <<15/5=3>>3 feet/second
Then multiply the turtle's speed by the number of seconds it spends crawling to find how far it crawls: 40 seconds * 3 feet/second = <<40*3=120>>120 feet
