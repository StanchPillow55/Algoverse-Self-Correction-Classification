Question: Morisette and Kael were asked to bring fruits. Morisette brought 5 apples and 8 oranges, while Kael brought twice the amount of apples and half the number of oranges than Morisette. How many fruits do they have in total?

Reference Answer: Kael brought 5 x 2 = <<5*2=10>>10 apples.
And he also brought 8 / 2 = <<8/2=4>>4 oranges.
Therefore, Kael and Morisette brought 5 + 10 + 8 + 4 = <<5+10+8+4=27>>27 fruits in total.
