Question: John decides to take a cooking class.  The class meets 4 times a week for 2 hours each time for 6 weeks.  If he learns a new recipe for every 1.5 hours of class time, how many recipes does he learn?

Reference Answer: He is in class for 4*2=<<4*2=8>>8 hours per week
So he takes classes for 8*6=<<8*6=48>>48 hours
That means he learned 48/1.5=<<48/1.5=32>>32 recipes
