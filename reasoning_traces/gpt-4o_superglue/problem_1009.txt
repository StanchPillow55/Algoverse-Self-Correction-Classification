Question: Brook Hills High School currently enrolls 3000 students. Half of these students are over 16 years old, and one-fourth of the students over 16 years old are male. The remaining half of the students are under 16 years old, and one-half of the students under 16 are male. In total, how many female students are enrolled at this school?

Reference Answer: 3000-1500=<<3000-1500=1500>>1500 students are over 16 years old.
1500*0.25=<<1500*0.25=375>>375 students of this age are male.
1500/2=<<1500/2=750>>750 students under 16 years of age are male.
In total there are 750+375=<<750+375=1125>>1125 male students enrolled.
So, there are 3000-1125=<<3000-1125=1875>>1875 female students enrolled.
