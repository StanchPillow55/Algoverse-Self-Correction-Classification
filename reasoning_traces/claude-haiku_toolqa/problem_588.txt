Question: Jared is trying to increase his typing speed. He starts with 47 words per minute (WPM). After some lessons the next time he tests his typing speed it has increased to 52 WPM. If he continues to increase his typing speed once more by 5 words, what will be the average of the three measurements?

Reference Answer: Jared types at 52 WPM and increases it by 5 WPM, 52 + 5 = <<52+5=57>>57 WPM.
His average over all his measured words-per-minute is 47 + 52 + 57 = <<47+52+57=156>>156.
His total is 156 / 3 typing speeds = <<156/3=52>>52 WPM as Jared's average typing speed.
