Question: Oscar has 24 lollipops and eats 2 on his way to school.  He passes 14 out to his friends.  He buys twice as many lollipops on his way home as he gave to his friends.  He eats 3 more that night and 2 more in the morning.  How many lollipops does Oscar have?

Reference Answer: He has 24 lollipops, eats 2 and passes 14 out to his friends so thatâ€™s 24-2-14 = <<24-2-14=8>>8 lollipops are left
On his way home he buys twice the amount of the 14 that he passed out so he bought 2*14 = <<2*14=28>>28 lollipops
He now has 8+28 = <<8+28=36>>36 lollipops
He has 36, eats 3 that night and 2 more in the morning leaving him with 36-3-2 = <<36-3-2=31>>31 lollipops
