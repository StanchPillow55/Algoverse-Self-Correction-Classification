Question: Jonathan was sad to learn he needed 2 more toys than he already had to have enough toys to make a sorted play set five times larger than James's play set, which had 80 toys. How many toys does Jonathan currently have?

Reference Answer: Five times as large as James's set of play, which has 80 toys, is 5*80 = <<5*80=400>>400 toys.
If Jonathan was sad to learn he needed 2 more toys than he already had, then he had 400-2 = <<400-2=398>>398 toys
