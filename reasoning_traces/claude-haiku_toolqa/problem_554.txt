Question: When the water is cold Ray swims a mile in 16 minutes. When the water is warm Ray swims a mile in 2 minutes more than twice as long. How much longer does Ray take to swim 3 miles on a hot day than a cold day?

Reference Answer: Cold water mile = <<16=16>>16 minutes
Warm water mile = 2+2(16)=34 minutes
3 miles in cold water: 3(16)=<<3*16=48>>48 minutes
3 miles in warm water: 3(34)=<<3*34=102>>102 minutes
Ray takes 102-48=<<102-48=54>>54 minutes longer
