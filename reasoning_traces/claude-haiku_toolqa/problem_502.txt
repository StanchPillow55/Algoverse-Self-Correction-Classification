Question: Cherrie wants to buy Christmas gifts for her 5 friends. 2 of her friends want 5 gifts and the other 3 friends want 2 gifts for themselves. Cherrie goes ahead and buys them and decides to further surprise them by getting 10 more random gifts. How many gifts did Cherrie buy in total?

Reference Answer: Two of Cherries friends in total want 2*5=<<2*5=10>>10 gifts.
Her other three friends will get 3*2=<<3*2=6>>6 gifts in total between them.
