Question: Lloyd has an egg farm. His chickens produce 252 eggs per day and he sells them for $2 per dozen. How much does Lloyd make on eggs per week?

Reference Answer: In a week, Lloyd's egg farm produces 252 x 7 = <<252*7=1764>>1764 eggs.
There are 1764/12 = <<1764/12=147>>147 dozens of eggs produced in a week.
So, Lloyd makes 147 x $2 = $<<147*2=294>>294 on eggs.
#### 294
