Question: If Mark weighs 150 pounds and Susan weighs 20 pounds less than Mark.  And their friend Bob weighs twice as much as Susan.  What is the average weight of the 3 friends?

Reference Answer: Susan weighs 150 pounds - 20 pounds = <<150-20=130>>130 pounds.
Bob weighs 2 * 130 pounds = <<2*130=260>>260 pounds.
The friends total weight is 150 + 130 + 260 pounds = <<150+130+260=540>>540 pounds.
The friends' average weight is 540 pounds / 3 = <<540/3=180>>180 pounds.
