Question: A herd consists of camels and dromedaries. There are 180 heads and 304 bumps. How many dromedaries are there if camels have two humps each and dromedaries have one hump each?

Reference Answer: Let x be the number of camels.
Since each animal has one head, the number of dromedaries is 180 - x.
Each camel has two humps and each dromedary has one hump so in total there are 2x + 180 – x = 304 humps.
x = 304 – 180
x = <<124=124>>124
So, there are 124 camels and 180 – 124 = 56 dromedaries.
