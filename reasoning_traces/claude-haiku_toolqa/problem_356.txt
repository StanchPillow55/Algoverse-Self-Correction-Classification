Question: Dean's mother gave him $28 to go to the toy store. Dean bought 6 toy cars and 5 teddy bears. Each toy car cost $2 and each teddy bear cost $1. His mother then feels generous and decides to give him an extra $10. How much money does Dean have left?

Reference Answer: The cost of the toy cars is 6 cars × $2/car = $<<6*2=12>>12.
The cost of the teddy bears is 5 bears × $1/bear = $<<5*1=5>>5.
The total cost of the toys is $12 + $5 = $<<12+5=17>>17.
Adding the two amounts of money his mother gave him, we find that Dean has $28 + $10 = $<<28+10=38>>38 to spend.
Dean has $38 − $17 = $21 left.
