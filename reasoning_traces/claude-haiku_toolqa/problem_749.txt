Question: In a school activity, fifty-four students are to be separated into six groups of equal size. If the activity requires 12 groups, how many more groups are needed to form?

Reference Answer: There are 54/6 = <<54/6=9>>9 groups formed from the 54 students.
So, 12 - 9 = <<12-9=3>>3 groups more are needed to form.
