Question: Sitti and Juris bought 34 and 22 oranges, respectively. If both of them decide to share them equally with their 6 other friends, how many oranges will everyone get?

Reference Answer: There are a total of 34 + 22 = <<34+22=56>>56 oranges.
Sitti, Juris, and 6 other friends will divide them equally which means there are 2 + 6 = <<2+6=8>>8 of them sharing.
So, each one will get 56 oranges / 8 people = <<56/8=7>>7 oranges/person
