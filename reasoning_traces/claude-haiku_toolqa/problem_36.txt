Question: Terry eats 2 yogurts a day.  They are currently on sale at 4 yogurts for $5.00.  How much does he spend on yogurt over 30 days?

Reference Answer: He eats 2 yogurts a day so over 30 days he will need 2*30 = <<2*30=60>>60 yogurts
The yogurt is sold as 4 units for $5.00 and he needs 60 yogurts so thatâ€™s 60/4 = <<60/4=15>>15 4-packs
Each 4-pack is $5.00 and he needs 15 4-packs so he will spend $5*15 = $<<5*15=75.00>>75.00 on yogurt
