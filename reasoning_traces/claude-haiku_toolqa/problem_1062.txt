Question: Hannah slips on a banana peel and breaks her arm. The doctor charges her $200 for the cast, $300/hour for a 30-minute visit, $4/pill for 30 painkillers, and $6/hour for a mandatory minimum of 2 hours of parking. How much does the doctor's visit cost total?

Reference Answer: First find the length of the visit in hours: 30 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = <<30/60=.5>>.5 hours
Then find the total cost of the visit: $300/hour * .5 hours = $<<300*.5=150>>150
Then find the total cost of the painkillers: $4/pill * 30 pills = $<<4*30=120>>120
Then find the cost of the parking: $6/hour * 2 hours = $<<6*2=12>>12
Then add all the different costs to find the total cost: $12 + $120 + $150 + $200 = $<<12+120+150+200=482>>482
