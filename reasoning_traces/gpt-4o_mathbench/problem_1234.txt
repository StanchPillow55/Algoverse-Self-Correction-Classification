Question: Regina wrote 9 novels last year. If this is 3 quarters of the number of novels she has written this year, how many novels has she written this year?

Reference Answer: Number of novels she wrote last year = (3/4)*number of novels she wrote this year
9 = (3/4)*number of novels she wrote this year
Multiplying both sides by 4/3 gives the number of novels she has written this year = (4/3)*9 = <<4/3*9=12>>12 novels
#### 12
