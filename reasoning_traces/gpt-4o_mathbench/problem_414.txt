Question: Misha picks out 4 blouses from the 30% off rack.  The regular price for each blouse is $20.  How much is the total cost of the discounted blouses?

Reference Answer: Total regular price for the blouses is $20 x 4 = $<<20*4=80>>80.
Total discount on the blouses is $80 x 30% = $<<80*30*.01=24>>24.
Misha paid $80 - $24 = $<<80-24=56>>56 for the discounted blouses.
