Question: On Monday, Sue ate 4 times as many cookies as her sister. On Tuesday, she ate twice as many cookies as her sister. Her sister ate 5 cookies on Monday and 13 the next day. If 1 cookie has 200 calories, how many more calories did Sue consume than her sister?

Reference Answer: Sue’s Monday cookie intake is 4*5 = <<4*5=20>>20.
Sue’s Tuesday cookie intake is 2*13 = <<2*13=26>>26.
Total cookies Sue consumed is 20+26 = <<20+26=46>>46.
Sue’s sister ate a total of 5+13 = <<5+13=18>>18 cookies.
Sue ate 46-18=<<46-18=28>>28 more cookies.
Sue consumed 28*200=<<28*200=5600>>5,600 more calories.
#### 5,600
