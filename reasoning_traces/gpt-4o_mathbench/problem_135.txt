Question: Brian's friend Bobby has 5 fewer than 3 times as many video games as Brian does.  If Brian has 20 video games but lost 5 right before the comparison was made, how many does Bobby have?

Reference Answer: If Brian previously had 20 video games but lost 5, that means he now has 20-5=<<20-5=15>>15 video games
Brian has 15 video games, so if Bobby has 5 fewer than 3 times as many as Brian does we must first perform 15*3=45
We then subtract 5 from the previous total for 45-5=40 games in total.
