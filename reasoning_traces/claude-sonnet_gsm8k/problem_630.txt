Question: Tiffany is measuring how many surfers can ride a big wave without falling. She sees that when a wave over 30 feet arrives, only 25% of the riders can stay upright. Of these riders, 60% are women. If there are 100 riders, how many men can stay upright on the wave?

Reference Answer: 25 riders stayed upright because 100 x .25 = <<100*.25=25>>25
Of these riders 10 were men because 25 x .4 = <<25*.4=10>>10
