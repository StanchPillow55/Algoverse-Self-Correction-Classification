Question: Madeline ate 6 grapes. Her brother wanted to make grape juice and used up 5 times as many grapes then Madeline to make a full glass. Their mother then used the remaining grapes to make 4 pies. How many grapes were there at the beginning if the pie recipe calls for 12 grapes per pie?

Reference Answer: Madeline's brother used 6 x 5 = <<6*5=30>>30 grapes
Their mother used 12 x 4 = <<12*4=48>>48 grapes
There were 30 + 48 + 6 = <<30+48+6=84>>84 grapes at the beginning
