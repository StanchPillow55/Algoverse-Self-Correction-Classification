Question: Duncan's age eight years ago was two times Adam's age four years ago. If Duncan's age is 60 now, how old will Adam be in 8 years?

Reference Answer: Eight years ago, Duncan was 60-8 = 52 years old, the same as Adam's age four years ago.
Therefore, four years ago, Adam's age was 52/2 =<<52/2=26>>26 years.
Currently, Adam is 26+4 = <<26+4=30>>30 years old.
In 8 years from now, Adam will be 30+8 = <<30+8=38>>38 years old.
