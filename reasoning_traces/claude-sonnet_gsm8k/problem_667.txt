Question: Sarahâ€™s basketball games are 4 quarters that are each 12 minutes long. In the last quarter, there was a tie so the game was extended for five minutes. How long did the entire game last?

Reference Answer: The four quarters lasted for 12 x 4 = <<12*4=48>>48 minutes.
The total time of the game for the entire game was 48 + 5 = <<48+5=53>>53 minutes.
