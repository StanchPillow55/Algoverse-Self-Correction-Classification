Question: My kitchen floor has a total area of 200 SqFt. I want to install new square floor tiles that cost $12 each, and each tile side is 1ft in length. How much will it cost me to renovate my kitchen floor?

Reference Answer: The total area of a square tile is length * width or 1*1 = <<1*1=1>>1 SqFt
If the kitchen has a total area of 200 SqFt then my kitchen needs 200/1 = <<200/1=200>>200 square tiles
If each tile costs $12, then 200 square tiles will cost $12 * 200 = $<<12*200=2400>>2,400
