Question: Nancy is returning her overdue books to the library. She owes $0.50 cents each on 8 books, plus a flat $2.00 fee for having at least one book that's over a week overdue. How much does she have to pay total?

Reference Answer: First multiply the late fee per book by the number of books: $0.50/book * 8 books = $<<0.5*8=4.00>>4.00
Then add the "more than a week overdue" fee to the answer from the previous step to find the total: $4.00 + $2.00 = $<<4+2=6.00>>6.00
