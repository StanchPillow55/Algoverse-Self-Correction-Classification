Question: Tom's restaurant gets 6 reservations a night.  They normally order 2 meals that cost $5 each and a $5 bottle of wine.  How much do they make a week if they are open 2 days a week?

Reference Answer: The meals cost 2*5=$<<2*5=10>>10 per table
So each table pays 10+5=$<<10+5=15>>15 a night
So they make 6*$15=$<<6*15=90>>90 a night
That means they make $90*2=$<<90*2=180>>180 a week
