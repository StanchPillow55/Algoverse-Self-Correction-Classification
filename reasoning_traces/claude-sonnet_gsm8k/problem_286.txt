Question: Kelly has 5 quarters and 2 dimes. If she buys a can of pop for 55 cents, how many cents will she have left?

Reference Answer: Her quarters are worth 5 * 25 = <<5*25=125>>125 cents.
The dimes are worth 2 * 10 = <<2*10=20>>20 cents
Kelly has a total of 125 + 20 = <<125+20=145>>145 cents
After buying the can of pop, Kelly will have 145 - 55 = <<145-55=90>>90 cents left.
