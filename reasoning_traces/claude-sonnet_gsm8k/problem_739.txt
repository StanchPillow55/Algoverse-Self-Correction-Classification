Question: Cecelia went to the milk store and found out that a gallon jar costs $2 more than a half-gallon jar. If a gallon jar costs $5, calculate the total amount of money she spent on 10-gallon jars and 16 half-gallon jars.

Reference Answer: If a full gallon costs $2 more than a half-gallon jar, then the cost of a half-gallon jar is $5 - $2 = $3
If he bought 10 full gallon jars, she spent 10 jars * $5/jar = $<<10*5=50>>50
For the half-gallon jars, she spent $3/jar * 16 jars = $<<3*16=48>>48
The total amount she spent at the store is $48 + $50 = $<<48+50=98>>98
