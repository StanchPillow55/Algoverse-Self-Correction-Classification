Question: My mom went to a gardening shop. She bought a set of pots for $19 and a sack of garden soil for $26. At checkout, she used a coupon for $7 off. How much money did my mom spend at the gardening shop?

Reference Answer: The total cost of the pots and a sack of garden soil is $19 + $26 = $<<19+26=45>>45.
So, my mom spent $45 - $7 = $<<45-7=38>>38 at the gardening store.
