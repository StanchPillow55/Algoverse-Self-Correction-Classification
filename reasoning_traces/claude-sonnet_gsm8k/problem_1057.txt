Question: Jill and her friends watch 4 movies every Saturday and half the number of movies on Sunday than on Saturday. If they watch movies every weekend, how many movies can they watch in 4 weeks?

Reference Answer: They watch 4 / 2 = <<4/2=2>>2 movies every Sunday.
They watch a total of 4 + 2 = <<4+2=6>>6 movies every weekend.
Therefore, they can watch 6 x 4 = <<6*4=24>>24 movies in four weeks.
