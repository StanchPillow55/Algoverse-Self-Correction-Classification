Question: The price of Parmesan cheese is $11 per pound. Mozzarella cheese is $6 per pound.  Amor buys 2 pounds of Parmesan and 3 pounds of mozzarella cheese.  Is she starts with $50 cash, how much money, in dollars, will she have left to buy meat?

Reference Answer: The cost for buying 2 pounds of parmesan cheese is $11 x 2 = $<<11*2=22>>22.
The cost for buying 3 pounds of mozzarella cheese is $6 x 3 = $<<6*3=18>>18.
The total amount spent for the 2 kinds of cheese is $22 + $18 = $<<22+18=40>>40.
So, Amor still has $50 - $40 = $<<50-40=10>>10 left to buy for meat.
