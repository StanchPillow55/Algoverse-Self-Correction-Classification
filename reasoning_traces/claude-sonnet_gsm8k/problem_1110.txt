Question: Although Soledad works in a windowless office, she loves the outdoors. She will be on vacation for the entire month of June and cannot wait to hike 9,300 miles within that month. She is thinking of walking twice a day, covering 125 miles each time. How many more miles per day must Soledad hike to complete her journey on time?

Reference Answer: June has 30 days, so Soledad must hike 9,300 miles / 30 days = <<9300/30=310>>310 miles/day
Initially, she wanted to hike 2 times/day * 125 miles/time = <<2*125=250>>250 miles/day
To complete her journey, she must increase her hike by 310 miles/day - 250 miles/day = 60 miles/day
