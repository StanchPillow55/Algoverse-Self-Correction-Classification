Question: A company wanted to buy 500 computers and had $700 for each computer. However, when they went to order, they realized the price of each computer was 10% higher than they had planned for. Calculate the total amount of money they paid to buy the computers at the new prices.

Reference Answer: When they went to order, the company realized the prices of each computer had increased by 10/100*700 = $<<10/100*700=70>>70
The total buying price at the new prize is $700+$70 = $<<700+70=770>>770
Since they wanted to buy 500 computers, they paid a total of $770*500 = $<<770*500=385000>>385000
