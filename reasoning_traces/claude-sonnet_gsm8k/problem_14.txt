Question: In a dance class of 20 students, 20% enrolled in contemporary dance, 25% of the remaining enrolled in jazz dance, and the rest enrolled in hip-hop dance. What percentage of the entire students enrolled in hip-hop dance?

Reference Answer: There are 20 x 20/100 = <<20*20/100=4>>4 students who enrolled in contemporary dance.
So, 20 - 4 = <<20-4=16>>16 students are enrolled in either jazz or hip-hop dance.
There are 16 x 25/100 = <<16*25/100=4>>4 students who enrolled in jazz dance.
Hence, 16 - 4 = <<16-4=12>>12 students enrolled in hip-hop dance.
This is 12/20 x 100% = 60% of the entire students.
