Question: A pet store currently has 5 dogs, 2 cats, and 10 birds. How many legs in total do the pets in the store have?

Reference Answer: The dogs have 5 dogs * 4 legs/dog = <<5*4=20>>20 legs.
The cats have 2 cats * 4 legs/cat = <<2*4=8>>8 legs.
The birds have 10 birds * 2 legs/bird = <<10*2=20>>20 legs.
The pets have 20 legs + 8 legs + 20 legs = <<20+8+20=48>>48 legs.
