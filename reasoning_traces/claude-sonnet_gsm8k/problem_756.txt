Question: A council met to vote on a new regulation. The vote passed with twice as many votes in favor of the new regulation as there were against it. If there are 33 people on the council, what was the number of votes in favor of the new regulation?

Reference Answer: Let V be the number of votes against the new regulation.
There were twice as many votes in favor of the new regulation, so V + 2V = 3V = 33.
Thus, there were V = 33 / 3 = <<33/3=11>>11 votes against the new regulation.
Therefore, there were 2V = 2 * 11 = 22 votes in favor of the new regulation.
