Question: John buys a cassette with 2 songs.  The first song is 5 minutes and the second song is 60% longer.  How much time was the total cassette?

Reference Answer: The second song is 5*.6=<<5*.6=3>>3 minutes longer than the first
So the second song was 5+3=<<5+3=8>>8 minutes
That means the total time was 5+8=<<5+8=13>>13 minutes
