Question: Audrey has to take two math tests to pass 6th grade. She must correctly answer 70% of the total questions to move on to the 7th grade. The first test has 70 questions and she gets 60% of them correct. The second test has 40 questions. How many questions does she need to get right on the second test to move onto the 7th grade?

Reference Answer: There are 110 questions in total because 70 + 40 = <<70+40=110>>110
She needs to get 77 of these right because 110 x .7 = <<110*.7=77>>77
She got 42 questions right on the first test because 70 x .6 = <<70*.6=42>>42
She needs to get 35 questions right on the second test because 77 - 42 = <<77-42=35>>35
