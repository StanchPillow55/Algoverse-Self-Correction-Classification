Question: Raymond had $21. Then he saved $11 from his allowance and spent $5 on a comic book and $19 on a puzzle. How much money does Raymond have left?

Reference Answer: Raymond started with $21 + $11 = $<<21+11=32>>32.
Raymond then spent $5 + $19 = $<<5+19=24>>24.
Raymond now has $32 - $24 = $<<32-24=8>>8 left.
