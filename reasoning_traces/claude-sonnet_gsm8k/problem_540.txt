Question: $18 is shared among 3 boys. The eldest added $5 to his share and added another $10 the following day. He later needed some money and spent $8 from his total so far. After saving some more, he was able to triple the amount he had left after spending the $8. How much does he have now?

Reference Answer: Each boy gets $18/3 = $<<18/3=6>>6.
The eldest had $5+$6=$<<5+6=11>>11 after adding $5 to his share.
He added another $10 so he had $11+$10=$<<11+10=21>>21.
Then he had $21-$8=$<<21-8=13>>13 after spending $8.
So, he now has $13*3=$<<13*3=39>>39.
