Question: The Easter egg hunt team hid 100 eggs. The Smith twins each found 30 eggs. All the other eggs except 10 were found by their friends. How many eggs did the friends find?

Reference Answer: The Smith twins found, 30 * 2 = <<30*2=60>>60 eggs.
The number that remained hidden was 100 - 60 = <<100-60=40>>40 eggs
Since 10 eggs were not found, this means the friends found 40 - 10 = 30 eggs
