Question: Jaime is a computer programmer for a company that currently has employed 100 people. Senior programmers are paid $400 more than junior programmers. If the number of Junior programmers is 2/5 of the total number of employees, and they are each paid $2000 per month, calculate the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month.

Reference Answer: The number of junior programmers in the company is 2/5*100 = <<2/5*100=40>>40
The total amount of money that the company pays to the Junior employees is $2000*40 = $<<2000*40=80000>>80000
There are also 100-40 = <<100-40=60>>60 senior programmers in the company.
The senior programmers are paid $2000+$400 = $<<2000+400=2400>>2400 each.
Senior programmers at the company receive 2400*60 = $<<2400*60=144000>>144000 combined.
All the programmers in the company are paid a combined salary of 144000+80000 = <<144000+80000=224000>>224000
#### 224000
