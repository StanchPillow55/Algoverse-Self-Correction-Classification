Question: Each person in a certain household consumes 0.2 kg of rice every meal. Supposing 5 members of the household eat rice every lunch and dinner, how many weeks will a 42 kg bag of rice last?

Reference Answer: Each person eats 0.2 kg/meal x 2 meals/day = <<0.2*2=0.4>>0.4 kg of rice per day.
So, the 5 members consume 0.4 kg/day/person x 5 people = <<0.4*5=2>>2 kg of rice per day.
In a week, the household consumes 2 kg/day x 7 days/week = <<2*7=14>>14kg of rice.
Thus, 42 kg of rice will last 42 kg / 14 kg/week = <<42/14=3>>3 weeks.
