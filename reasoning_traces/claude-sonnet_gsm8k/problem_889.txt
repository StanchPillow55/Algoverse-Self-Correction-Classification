Question: Joelle has 5 orchids and 4 African daisies on her balcony.  If the orchids have 5 petals and daisies have 10 petals, how many more petals do the daisies have compared to the orchids?

Reference Answer: The number of petals on orchids is 5 x 5 = <<5*5=25>>25.
The number of petals on daisies is 4 x 10 = <<4*10=40>>40.
Daisy petals outnumber orchid petals by 40 - 25 = <<40-25=15>>15.
