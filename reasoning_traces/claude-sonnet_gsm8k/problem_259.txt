Question: Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal and half as many bananas as Jamal. Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples. How many fruits are there if Andrea has 52 apples?

Reference Answer: Since Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal, if Andrea has 52 apples, Jamal has 52-8 = <<52-8=44>>44 apples.
The total number of apples is 44+52 = <<44+52=96>>96
Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples, meaning he has 44+4 = 48 bananas.
Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal, which totals 48/2 = <<48/2=24>>24 bananas.
There are a total of 48+24 = <<48+24=72>>72 bananas.
Altogether, there are 96 apples + 72 bananas = <<96+72=168>>168 fruits
