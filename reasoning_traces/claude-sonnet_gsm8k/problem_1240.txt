Question: Elly is organizing her books on the new bookcases her parents bought her. Each of the middle 2 shelves can hold 10 books. The bottom shelf can hold twice as many books as a middle shelf. The top shelf can hold 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf. If she has 110 books, how many bookcases does she need to hold all of them?

Reference Answer: The bottom shelf can hold 2 * 10 = <<2*10=20>>20 books.
The 2 middle shelves can hold a total of 2 * 10 = <<2*10=20>>20 books.
The top shelf can hold 20 â€“ 5 = <<20-5=15>>15 books.
Each bookcase can hold a total of 20 books + 20 books + 15 books = <<20+20+15=55>>55 books.
To hold all of her books, she needs 110 / 55 = <<110/55=2>>2 bookcases.
