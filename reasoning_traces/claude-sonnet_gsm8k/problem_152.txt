Question: Carl buys ten packs of cookies. Each pack of cookies has six cookies inside. Each cookie cost $0.10. How much change does Carl receive if he pay with a $10 bill?

Reference Answer: A pack of cookies costs 6 x $0.10 = $<<6*0.1=0.60>>0.60.
Thus, ten packs of cookies cost 10 x $0.6 = $<<10*0.6=6>>6.
Therefore, Carl will receive a $10 - $6 = $<<10-6=4>>4 change.
