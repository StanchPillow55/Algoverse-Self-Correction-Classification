Question: Shiela is required to submit a 15-page research paper. She already finished writing 1/3 of the paper. How many pages does she have left to write?

Reference Answer: Shiela has already written one third of the paper which is 15 pages x 1/3 = <<15*1/3=5>>5 pages.
So, she still needs to write 15 pages - 5 pages = <<15-5=10>>10 pages.
