Question: The ratio of the electric poles and electric wires needed to connect and supply the electricity in a certain neighborhood is 1:3. If the total number of electric wires needed to connect the electricity in the neighborhood is 45, calculate the total number of electric poles required by an electric company to supply the electricity in the neighborhood.

Reference Answer: The total ratio representing the number of electric poles and wires is 1+3=<<1+3=4>>4
The fraction representing the number of wires required to connect the neighborhood's electricity is <<3/4=3/4>>3/4
If 3/4 represents 45, the number of wires required for the connections, then the total fraction which is 4/4, representing the poles and wires needed, represents 4/4*45*4/3=60
Since the total number of wires and poles required is 60, and the number of electric wires to be used is 45, the number of poles required is 60-45=<<60-45=15>>15
