# Full Reasoning Traces Implementation - Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the comprehensive implementation of full reasoning traces in the teacher-learner pipeline. The system has been updated to capture complete reasoning processes instead of just final answers, enabling deeper analysis of model behavior and problem-solving approaches.

## Key Improvements

### 🧠 Reasoning Capture
- **Before**: Models restricted to provide only final numeric answers or code snippets
- **After**: Models encouraged to show complete reasoning process with step-by-step explanations
- **Impact**: Full insight into how models solve problems, identify errors, and approach different problem types

### 🔧 Technical Implementation

#### 1. New ReasoningExtractor Module (`src/eval/reasoning_extractor.py`)
- **Purpose**: Separates final answers from reasoning traces for evaluation
- **Math Problems**: Extracts numeric answers using regex patterns while preserving full reasoning
- **Code Problems**: Extracts function definitions while maintaining reasoning explanations
- **Confidence**: Provides reasoning quality assessment based on trace length and structure

#### 2. Updated Prompts (`src/loop/runner.py`)
- **GSM8K/Math**: "Show your complete reasoning process step by step, then provide the final answer"
- **HumanEval/Code**: "First explain your approach and reasoning, then implement the solution"
- **Token Limits**: Increased to accommodate longer reasoning outputs (2048+ tokens)

#### 3. Enhanced Logging System
- **Reasoning Traces**: Individual `.txt` files per problem and turn
- **File Structure**: Organized by dataset type and problem ID
- **CSV Integration**: Reasoning trace file paths included in analysis outputs
- **Multi-turn Support**: Captures reasoning evolution across correction attempts

#### 4. CSV Output Enhancements (`src/eval/csv_formatter.py`)
- **Detailed Results**: Turn-by-turn data with reasoning trace references
- **Summary Analysis**: One row per problem with final outcomes
- **Turn Analysis**: Accuracy progression across correction attempts
- **Dashboard**: Analysis guide and file location reference
