Therefore, Saskay can lift a mountain 12 inches high.
Step 2: Find the height that Kagiyami can lift a mountain.
Therefore, Kagiyami can lift a mountain 48 inches high.

Total number of employees = 3 groups Ã— 200 employees per group = 600 employees
Step 2: Calculate the total number of tour guides going on the tour.
Total number of tour guides = 3 groups Ã— 7 tour guides per group = 21 tour guides

Step 2: Set up the second equation based on the information that the big pool now has four times as much water as the small pool.
Step 3: Substitute the second equation into the first equation to

To solve this problem, we need to find the speed of the kangaroos and then use that to calculate the speed of the turtles and the time it will take them to travel the same distance.
Step 1: Calculate the speed of the kangaroos.
Since 3 kangaroos traveling at the same speed take a total of 18 hours to travel the distance, we can calculate the speed of each kangaroo.

Total weekly cost: $25.00 + $16.00 + $6.00 = $47.00
Step 2: Calculate the total cost of dry-cleaning for 5 weeks.

Together, they have 84 sofas+88 chairs = <<84+88=172>>172

Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
- Ophelia and Jenna each have 2 fewer sofas than chairs.
- Ophelia has 20 sofas.
Step 1: Find the number of chairs Ophelia has.
Since Ophelia has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, we can say:

Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
Step 1: Find the speed of the turtle.
Since the cat is 5 times faster than the turtle, we can divide the cat's speed by 5 to find the turtle's speed.
Step 2: Calculate the distance the turtle can crawl in 40 seconds.
Therefore, Martha's turtle can crawl 120 feet in 40 seconds.
