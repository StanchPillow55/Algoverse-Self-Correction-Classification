Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:
- The expected rain on Tuesday is 1 more inch than twice of Monday's total.

Total number of employees = 3 groups × 200 employees per group = 600 employees
Step 2: Calculate the total number of tour guides going on the tour.
Total number of tour guides = 3 groups × 7 tour guides per group = 21 tour guides

Each pack of bagels has 9 bagels per pack and he orders 4 packs so that's 9*4 = <<9*4=36>>36 bagels
His order total was $36.00 and there are 36 bagels so each bagel costs 36/36 = $<<36/36=1.00>>1.00

Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
2. There are now 8 more dogs in the shelter, so he needs to buy 8 more toys.
* Total toys needed = 4 (initial) + 8 (new) = 12 toys
* If there were 4 dogs initially, and 8 more were added, that means there are now 12 dogs total.
* So he needs to buy 12 more toys (24 dogs - 12 toys he already has).

Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
Step 1: Find the speed of the turtle.
Since the cat is 5 times faster than the turtle, we can divide the cat's speed by 5 to find the turtle's speed.
Step 2: Calculate the distance the turtle can crawl in 40 seconds.
Therefore, Martha's turtle can crawl 120 feet in 40 seconds.
