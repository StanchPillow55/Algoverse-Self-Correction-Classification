Question ID: 772
Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

Tatiana has a total of 7 hours on Saturday and 5 hours on Sunday, which equals 12 hours in total.

She spends 3 hours reading, so she has 12 - 3 = 9 hours left for soccer and video games.

She spends 1/3 of this time playing video games, which equals 9 * 1/3 = 3 hours.

This leaves her with 9 - 3 = 6 hours for soccer.

To find out what percentage of her weekend she spends playing soccer, we divide the time she spends playing soccer by the total time she has and multiply by 100.

So, the percentage of time she spends playing soccer is 6 / 12 * 100 = 50%.

Therefore, Tatiana spends 50% of her weekend playing soccer.
