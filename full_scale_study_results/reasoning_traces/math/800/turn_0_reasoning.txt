Question ID: 800
Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to find out how many points Nikita scored. We know that Nikita scored 11 more than half as many as Pierson. 

To find half of Pierson's score, we divide Pierson's score by 2:

278 / 2 = 139

Then, we add 11 to find Nikita's score:

139 + 11 = 150

So, Nikita scored 150 points.

To find the total points scored by Pierson and Nikita, we add their scores together:

278 (Pierson's score) + 150 (Nikita's score) = 428

So, Pierson and Nikita scored a total of 428 points.
