Question ID: 617
Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, let's figure out how much meat Prince sells in a day. Since he sells 15kg of meat every hour and works for 10 hours a day, he sells:

15kg/hour * 10 hours/day = 150kg/day

Next, we need to figure out how many days it will take Prince to sell all the meat from Bill's bull. Since the bull weighs 750kg and Prince sells 150kg of meat a day, it will take him:

750kg / 150kg/day = 5 days

So, it will take Prince 5 days to sell all the meat from Bill's bull.
