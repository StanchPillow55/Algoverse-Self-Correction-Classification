Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to find out how big Zack's locker is. Since Peter's locker is 1/4 the size of Zack's locker, and Peter's locker is 5 cubic inches, we can find the size of Zack's locker by multiplying 5 by 4. 

5 cubic inches * 4 = 20 cubic inches

So, Zack's locker is 20 cubic inches.

Next, we need to find out how big Timothy's locker is. Since Zack's locker is half the size of Timothy's locker, we can find the size of Timothy's locker by multiplying the size of Zack's locker by 2.

20 cubic inches * 2 = 40 cubic inches

So, Timothy's locker is 40 cubic inches.

Therefore, Timothy's locker is 40 cubic inches.
