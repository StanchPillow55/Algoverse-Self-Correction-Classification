Question ID: 418
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

Let's start by figuring out the size of Zack's locker. Since Peter's locker is 1/4 the size of Zack's locker, and we know that Peter's locker is 5 cubic inches, we can calculate the size of Zack's locker by multiplying the size of Peter's locker by 4. 

So, Zack's locker size = Peter's locker size * 4 = 5 cubic inches * 4 = 20 cubic inches.

Now, we know that Zack's locker is half as big as Timothy's locker. So, to find the size of Timothy's locker, we multiply the size of Zack's locker by 2.

So, Timothy's locker size = Zack's locker size * 2 = 20 cubic inches * 2 = 40 cubic inches.

Therefore, Timothy's locker is 40 cubic inches.
