Question ID: 418
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to work backwards from the information given.

We know that Peter's locker is 5 cubic inches and that it is 1/4 the size of Zack's locker. So, to find the size of Zack's locker, we multiply Peter's locker size by 4. 

5 cubic inches * 4 = 20 cubic inches

So, Zack's locker is 20 cubic inches.

We also know that Zack's locker is half the size of Timothy's locker. So, to find the size of Timothy's locker, we multiply Zack's locker size by 2.

20 cubic inches * 2 = 40 cubic inches

So, Timothy's locker is 40 cubic inches.

Therefore, Timothy's locker is 40 cubic inches.
