==================================================

First, let's find out how many bikes of each type Marcel sold.

Half of the 300 bikes sold were Trekking bikes, so Marcel sold 300/2 = <<300/2=150>>150 Trekking bikes.

15% of the 300 bikes sold were BMX bikes, so Marcel sold 300*0.15 = <<300*0.15=45>>45 BMX bikes.

The rest of the bikes sold were MTB type. So, Marcel sold 300 - 150 - 45 = <<300-150-45=105>>105 MTB bikes.

Now, let's calculate how much Marcel earned from selling each type of bike.

From the Trekking bikes, Marcel earned 150 * $450 = $<<150*450=67500>>67500.

The price of one BMX bike is half the price of an MTB bike, so one BMX bike costs $500/2 = $<<500/2=250>>250. From the BMX bikes, Marcel earned 45 * $250 = $<<45*250=11250>>11250.

From the MTB bikes, Marcel earned 105 * $500 = $<<105*500=52500>>52500.

So, in total, Marcel earned $67500 + $11250 + $52500 = $<<67500+11250+52500=131250>>131250 from selling bicycles during that month.
