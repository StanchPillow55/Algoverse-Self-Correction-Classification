Question ID: 1086
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, let's find out how many bikes of each type Marcel sold.

We know that half of the 300 bikes sold were Trekking bikes. So, Marcel sold 300/2 = 150 Trekking bikes.

We also know that 15% of the bikes sold were BMX bikes. So, Marcel sold 300 * 0.15 = 45 BMX bikes.

The rest of the bikes sold were MTB type. So, Marcel sold 300 - 150 - 45 = 105 MTB bikes.

Now, let's calculate how much Marcel earned from selling each type of bike.

From selling MTB bikes, Marcel earned 105 * $500 = $52,500.

We know that the price of a BMX bike is half the price of an MTB bike, which means a BMX bike costs $500/2 = $250. So, from selling BMX bikes, Marcel earned 45 * $250 = $11,250.

From selling Trekking bikes, Marcel earned 150 * $450 = $67,500.

So, in total, Marcel earned $52,500 + $11,250 + $67,500 = $131,250 from selling bicycles during that month.
