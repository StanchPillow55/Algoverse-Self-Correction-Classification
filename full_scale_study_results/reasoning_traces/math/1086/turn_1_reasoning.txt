Question ID: 1086
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, let's find out how many bikes of each type Marcel sold.

We know that half of the 300 bikes sold were Trekking bikes. So, Marcel sold 300 / 2 = 150 Trekking bikes.

We also know that 15% of the bikes sold were BMX bikes. So, Marcel sold 300 * 0.15 = 45 BMX bikes.

The rest of the bikes sold were MTB type. So, Marcel sold 300 - 150 - 45 = 105 MTB bikes.

Next, let's calculate how much Marcel earned from selling each type of bike.

From selling MTB bikes, Marcel earned 105 * $500 = $52,500.

The price of a BMX bike is half the price of an MTB bike, so a BMX bike costs $500 / 2 = $250. From selling BMX bikes, Marcel earned 45 * $250 = $11,250.

From selling Trekking bikes, Marcel earned 150 * $450 = $67,500.

Finally, let's add up all the earnings to find out how much Marcel earned in total from selling bicycles during that month.

Marcel earned a total of $52,500 (from MTB) + $11,250 (from BMX) + $67,500 (from Trekking) = $131,250.

So, Marcel earned $131,250 from selling bicycles during that month.
