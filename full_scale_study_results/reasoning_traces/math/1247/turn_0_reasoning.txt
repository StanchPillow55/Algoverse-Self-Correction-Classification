Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

Brendan started with 10 marbles.

He dropped half of them, which means he dropped 10/2 = <<10/2=5>>5 marbles.

After searching, he only found 3 of the 5 marbles he dropped. So, he had 10 - 5 = <<10-5=5>>5 marbles left in the bag, and he found 3 more, for a total of 5 + 3 = <<5+3=8>>8 marbles.

Upon further inspection, he discovered that one of the marbles was actually a bead. So, he got rid of it, leaving him with 8 - 1 = <<8-1=7>>7 marbles.

So, Brendan ended up with 7 marbles.
