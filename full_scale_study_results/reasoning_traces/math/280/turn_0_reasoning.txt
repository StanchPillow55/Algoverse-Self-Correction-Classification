Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to calculate the total cost of the popsicles. To do this, we multiply the number of popsicles by the cost of each popsicle. 

20 popsicles * $0.25/popsicle = $5.00

Next, we need to calculate the total cost of the ice cream bars. We do this by multiplying the number of ice cream bars by the cost of each ice cream bar.

4 ice cream bars * $0.50/ice cream bar = $2.00

Finally, we add the total cost of the popsicles and the total cost of the ice cream bars to find the total cost of all the items.

$5.00 + $2.00 = $7.00

So, Peter paid a total of $7.00 for the popsicles and ice cream bars.
