==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to find the year when snow rollers were last reported in western @placeholder.

Given information:
- The passage mentions that snow rollers, also known as snow doughnuts, have been found in yards and fields in Ohio, Illinois, and Pennsylvania.
- The passage states that the last time snow rollers were reported in western @placeholder was 10 years ago.

To find the year when snow rollers were last reported in western @placeholder, we need to subtract 10 years from the current year.

Step 1: Determine the current year.
Since the passage does not provide a specific year, we can assume the current year is the year the passage was written.

Step 2: Subtract 10 years from the current year.
Current year - 10 years = Year when snow rollers were last reported in western @placeholder

Therefore, the last time snow rollers were reported in western @placeholder was 10 years ago from the current year.

Final answer: The last time snow rollers were reported in western @placeholder was 10 years ago.
