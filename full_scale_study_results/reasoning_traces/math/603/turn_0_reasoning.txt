Dataset Type: math
==================================================

Ruiz can make 120 pounds of chocolates in two hours. This means in one hour, Ruiz can make 120/2 = <<120/2=60>>60 pounds of chocolates.

If he worked for 12 hours in a day, Ruiz made 60*12 = <<60*12=720>>720 pounds of chocolates.

Marissa makes 3/4 times as many pounds of chocolates in an hour as Ruiz makes in two hours. This means Marissa makes 3/4*120 = <<3/4*120=90>>90 pounds of chocolates in an hour.

If she worked for 12 hours in a day, Marissa made 90*12 = <<90*12=1080>>1080 pounds of chocolates.

Together, they made 1080+720 = <<1080+720=1800>>1800 pounds of chocolates in a day. Answer: \boxed{1800}.
