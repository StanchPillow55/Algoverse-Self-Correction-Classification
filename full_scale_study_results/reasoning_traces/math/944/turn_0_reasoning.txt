To solve this problem, we need to find out how much Jen will earn from selling each type of root crop and then add those amounts together.

First, let's calculate how much Jen will earn from selling the yams. She has 6 yams and each one can be sold for $1.5. So, the total amount she will earn from the yams is:

6 yams * $1.5/yam = $9

Next, let's calculate how much she will earn from selling the sweet potatoes. She has 10 sweet potatoes and each one can be sold for $2. So, the total amount she will earn from the sweet potatoes is:

10 sweet potatoes * $2/sweet potato = $20

Finally, let's calculate how much she will earn from selling the carrots. She has 4 carrots and each one can be sold for $1.25. So, the total amount she will earn from the carrots is:

4 carrots * $1.25/carrot = $5

Now, to find out how much Jen will earn in total, we need to add together the amounts she will earn from each type of root crop:

$9 (from yams) + $20 (from sweet potatoes) + $5 (from carrots) = $34

So, if Jen sells all her root crops, she will earn $34.
