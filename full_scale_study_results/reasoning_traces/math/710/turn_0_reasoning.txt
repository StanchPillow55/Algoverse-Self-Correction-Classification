==================================================

First, we need to calculate the total cost of each type of item that Marcus ordered. 

For the croissants, he ordered 5 at $3.00 each, so the total cost for the croissants is 5 * $3.00 = $15.00.

For the cinnamon rolls, he ordered 4 at $2.50 each, so the total cost for the cinnamon rolls is 4 * $2.50 = $10.00.

For the mini quiches, he ordered 3 at $4.00 each, so the total cost for the mini quiches is 3 * $4.00 = $12.00.

For the blueberry muffins, he ordered 13 at $1.00 each, so the total cost for the blueberry muffins is 13 * $1.00 = $13.00.

Now, we add up the total cost for each type of item to find the total cost of the order before the discount. 

$15.00 (croissants) + $10.00 (cinnamon rolls) + $12.00 (mini quiches) + $13.00 (blueberry muffins) = $50.00.

Now, we need to calculate the amount of the discount. The discount is 10% of the total cost, so we multiply the total cost by 10% (or 0.10) to find the amount of the discount.

$50.00 * 0.10 = $5.00.

Finally, we subtract the amount of the discount from the total cost to find the final total.

$50.00 - $5.00 = $45.00.

So, Marcus' total bill is $45.00.
