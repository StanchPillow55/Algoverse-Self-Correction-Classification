==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of camels and dromedaries in the herd given the total number of heads and humps. Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Step 1: Define Variables
- Let \( C \) be the number of camels.
- Let \( D \) be the number of dromedaries.

### Step 2: Set Up Equations
We know two things:
1. The total number of heads is 180. Since each animal has one head, we can write:
   \[
   C + D = 180
   \]

2. The total number of humps is 304. Camels have 2 humps each, and dromedaries have 1 hump each, so:
   \[
   2C + D = 304
   \]

### Step 3: Solve the System of Equations
We have the following system of equations:
1. \( C + D = 180 \)
2. \( 2C + D = 304 \)

To eliminate \( D \), we can subtract the first equation from the second equation:
\[
(2C + D) - (C + D) = 304 - 180
\]
Simplifying, we get:
\[
2C + D - C - D = 124
\]
\[
C = 124
\]

### Step 4: Find the Number of Dromedaries
Now that we know \( C = 124 \), we can substitute this value back into the first equation to find \( D \):
\[
C + D = 180
\]
\[
124 + D = 180
\]
Subtract 124 from both sides:
\[
D = 180 - 124
\]
\[
D = 56
\]

### Conclusion
The number of dromedaries in the herd is \( \boxed{56} \).

### Verification
To ensure our solution is correct, let's verify:
- Total heads: \( C + D = 124 + 56 = 180 \) (Correct)
- Total humps: \( 2C + D = 2(124) + 56 = 248 + 56 = 304 \) (Correct)

Both conditions are satisfied, confirming that the solution is correct. The final answer is \( \boxed{56} \) dromedaries.
