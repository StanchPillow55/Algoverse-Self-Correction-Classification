Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to find out the total cost of the two pairs of high heels. We know that one pair costs $33 and the other pair costs twice as much. Therefore, the cost of the second pair of heels is 2 * $33 = $66.

The total cost of the two pairs of heels is therefore $33 + $66 = $99.

We know that the boots cost $5 more than the total cost of the two pairs of heels. Therefore, the cost of the boots is $99 + $5 = $104.

So, the boots cost $104.
