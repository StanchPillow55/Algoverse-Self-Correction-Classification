==================================================

I apologize, but there does not appear to be a math problem in the given passage. The passage is about a couple who got engaged after the woman donated her kidney to her partner. There is no mathematical information or calculations provided in the text.

Without a specific math problem to solve, I cannot provide step-by-step reasoning and work. The passage is a news article describing a personal life event, not a math problem.

If you have a specific math question you would like me to solve, please provide that, and I will be happy to show my complete reasoning and work to arrive at the final answer. Otherwise, I do not have a math problem to solve from the given information.
