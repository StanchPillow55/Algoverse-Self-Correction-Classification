Question ID: 833
Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to find out how high each person can lift a mountain by multiplying the height of the mountain the previous person can lift by the given multiplier.

Starting with Pompei, we know he can lift a mountain 1 inch high.

Next, Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei can. So, Saskay can lift a mountain 12 * 1 = 12 inches high.

Then, Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay can. So, Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 * 12 = 48 inches high.

Finally, Naruto can lift a mountain 10 times higher than Kagiyami can. So, Naruto can lift a mountain 10 * 48 = 480 inches high.

However, the question asks for the height in feet, not inches. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we need to convert 480 inches to feet by dividing by 12.

480 inches / 12 = 40 feet.

So, Naruto can lift a mountain 40 feet high.
