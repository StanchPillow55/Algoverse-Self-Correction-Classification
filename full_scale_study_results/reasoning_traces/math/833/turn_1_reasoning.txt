Question ID: 833
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to find out how high each person can lift a mountain by using the information given in the problem.

Starting with Pompei, we know that he can lift a mountain 1 inch high.

Next, we know that Saskay can lift a mountain 12 times higher than Pompei can. So, we multiply Pompei's height by 12:

1 inch * 12 = 12 inches

Then, we know that Kagiyami can lift a mountain 4 times higher than Saskay can. So, we multiply Saskay's height by 4:

12 inches * 4 = 48 inches

Finally, we know that Naruto can lift a mountain 10 times higher than Kagiyami can. So, we multiply Kagiyami's height by 10:

48 inches * 10 = 480 inches

Now, we have found out that Naruto can lift a mountain 480 inches high. However, the problem asks for the height in feet. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we need to convert inches to feet by dividing by 12:

480 inches / 12 = 40 feet

So, Naruto can lift a mountain 40 feet high.
