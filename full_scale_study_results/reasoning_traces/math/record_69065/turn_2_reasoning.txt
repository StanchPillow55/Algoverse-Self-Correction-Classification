Question ID: record_69065
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, I will need to determine who the "placeholder" refers to in the given query. Based on the passage, the two criminals whose letters are being sold at auction are Reggie Kray and Charles Manson.

Given information:
- The passage mentions that "Prison letters written by London gangster Reggie Kray and U.S. death-cult leader Charles Manson are to be sold at auction."
- The query states: "In the letters, @placeholder wrote: 'Go to work for the fee.'"

Since the passage does not specify which of the two criminals wrote the quoted statement, I will need to consider both Reggie Kray and Charles Manson as potential candidates for the "placeholder" in the query.

Scenario 1: Reggie Kray is the "placeholder"
If Reggie Kray is the "placeholder", the query would read:
"In the letters, Reggie Kray wrote: 'Go to work for the fee.'"

Scenario 2: Charles Manson is the "placeholder"
If Charles Manson is the "placeholder", the query would read:
