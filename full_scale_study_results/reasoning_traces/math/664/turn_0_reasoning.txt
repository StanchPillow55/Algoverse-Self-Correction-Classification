Question ID: 664
Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, let's calculate the total hours John spends in the cooking class.

The class meets 4 times a week, for 2 hours each time. So, in a week, John spends 4 * 2 = <<4*2=8>>8 hours in the cooking class.

The class lasts for 6 weeks. So, the total hours John spends in the cooking class is 8 * 6 = <<8*6=48>>48 hours.

John learns a new recipe for every 1.5 hours of class time. So, the total number of recipes he learns is 48 / 1.5 = <<48/1.5=32>>32 recipes.

So, John learns 32 recipes in the cooking class.
