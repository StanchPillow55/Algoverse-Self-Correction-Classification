To solve this problem, we need to analyze the information provided in the paragraph and identify the reason why the kings of Spain began to visit Madrid.

The key information is found in the following sentence:

"From then on, the kings of Spain began to visit Madrid, where the air was invigorating and the hunting excellent."

This sentence directly states that the kings of Spain began to visit Madrid because the air was invigorating and the hunting was excellent.

Let's break down the reasoning step by step:

1. The paragraph mentions that prior to Madrid's elevation as the capital city in 1561, its history was rather undistinguished and its significance was negligible.
2. However, the paragraph then states that in 1308, King Ferdinand IV and his Cortes (an early version of parliament) held a formal meeting in the fledgling town of Madrid.
3. After this event, the paragraph says "From then on, the kings of Spain began to visit Madrid, where the air was invigorating and the hunting excellent."
4. This indicates that the kings of Spain were attracted to visit Madrid because of the invigorating air and the excellent hunting opportunities in the area.
