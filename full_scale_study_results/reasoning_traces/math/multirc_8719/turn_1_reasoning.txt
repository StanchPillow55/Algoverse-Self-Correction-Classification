==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to find the difference in years between the first recorded Protestant missionary's arrival in Albania and the printing of the first full Albanian Bible.

Given information:
- The first recorded Albanian Protestant was Said Toptani, who traveled around Europe and returned to Tirana in 1853 to preach Protestantism.
- The first full Albanian Bible to be printed was the Filipaj translation printed in 1990.

Step 1: Calculate the difference in years between the first recorded Protestant missionary's arrival and the printing of the first full Albanian Bible.
Year of the first full Albanian Bible printing - Year of the first recorded Protestant missionary's arrival = Difference in years
1990 - 1853 = 137 years

Therefore, the number of years that separate the first Protestant missionary's arrival in Albania and the printing of the first full Albanian Bible is 137 years.

Final answer: 137 years
