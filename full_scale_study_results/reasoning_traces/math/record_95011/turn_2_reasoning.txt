Question ID: record_95011
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given information and determine the correct placeholder for the final answer.

Given information:
- David Dimbleby has been leading the BBC's general election coverage since 1979.
- Dimbleby has stated that he has "no intention of stepping down" and would have to be "dragged kicking and screaming from the chair."
- However, the next general election coverage will be Dimbleby's last, as he is set to step down after his ninth and final time.
- Huw Edwards was given a "cast-iron guarantee" by the former director general to succeed Dimbleby in the anchor role, but Dimbleby lobbied the new director Lord Hall to overturn the decision.
- Huw Edwards will take over the election coverage after the 2015 elections and will also lead the post-election coverage the next day from 7am.

The query states that although the 7am handover will mark the end of Dimbleby's general election tenure, the placeholder will not actually be finished for the day.

Based on the information provided, the correct placeholder is "Dimbleby". Even though
