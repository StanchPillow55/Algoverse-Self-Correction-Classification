Question ID: record_95011
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given information and determine the correct placeholder for the final answer.

Given information:
- David Dimbleby has been leading the BBC's general election coverage since 1979.
- Dimbleby has stated that he has "no intention of stepping down" and would have to be "dragged kicking and screaming from the chair."
- However, the next general election coverage will be Dimbleby's last, as he is to step down from fronting after his ninth and final time.
- Huw Edwards will take over the election coverage after the 2015 elections and will also lead the post-election coverage the next day from 7am.

The question states that although the 7am handover will mark the end of Dimbleby's general election tenure, the placeholder will not actually be finished for the day.

Based on the information provided, the correct placeholder is "David Dimbleby".

Reasoning:
- The passage states that Dimbleby will be leading the BBC's general election coverage for the last time, and Huw Edwards will take over the coverage after the 2015 elections.
- However
