Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine who the placeholder refers to in the given query.

Given information:
- David Dimbleby has been leading the BBC's general election coverage since 1979.
- The next general election coverage will be his last.
- Huw Edwards will take over the election coverage after the 2015 elections.
- Edwards will also lead the post-election coverage the next day from 7am.

The query states that the "7am handover will mark the end of his general election tenure, but @placeholder will not actually be finished for the day."

Based on the information provided, the placeholder refers to David Dimbleby, as he is the one who will be handing over the election coverage to Huw Edwards at 7am, but he will not be finished for the day.

Therefore, the final answer is:

David Dimbleby will not actually be finished for the day, even though the 7am handover will mark the end of his general election tenure.
