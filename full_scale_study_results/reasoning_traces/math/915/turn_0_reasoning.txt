==================================================

Let's break down the problem step by step.

On Tuesday, Bruce works for 5 hours.

On Wednesday, he works twice the time he works on Tuesday. So, he works 2 * 5 hours = 10 hours on Wednesday.

On Thursday, he works 2 hours less than the time he works on Wednesday. So, he works 10 hours - 2 hours = 8 hours on Thursday.

To find out how many hours Bruce works in all these three days, we need to add up the hours he works on each day.

So, the total hours he works is 5 hours (Tuesday) + 10 hours (Wednesday) + 8 hours (Thursday) = 23 hours.

Therefore, Bruce works 23 hours in all these three days.
