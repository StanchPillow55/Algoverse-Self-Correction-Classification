To solve this problem, I will need to analyze the information provided in the passage and the query. However, there does not appear to be a specific mathematical problem or calculation to solve. The passage and query are discussing a legal case and the recollections of a person involved.

The key information from the passage is:
- A man named Nicholas Lambaditis, 34, has been charged with the murder of a Brazilian national, Lucio Stein Rodrigues, and assault of another man, Eric Heward, outside a pub in Sydney.
- Lambaditis told police he was just trying to "get out of there without getting hurt", implying he was acting in self-defense.
- Lambaditis has been sent to the Supreme Court for trial, where he is due to enter formal pleas on October 3.

The query states that "The recollections of Mr @placeholder seem to be very clear as well," but there is no further information provided about whose recollections are being referred to or what they are about.

Without any specific mathematical problem or calculations to solve, I can only provide a general response based on the information given.

Given the legal context of the case,
