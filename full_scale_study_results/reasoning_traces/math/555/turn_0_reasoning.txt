Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, let's calculate how much money John makes in a day. He works 5 hours a day and gets paid $2 per hour, so he makes 5 hours/day * $2/hour = $<<5*2=10>>10/day.

Next, let's calculate how much money he makes in a week. He works 4 days a week and makes $10 a day, so he makes 4 days/week * $10/day = $<<4*10=40>>40/week.

Now, let's calculate how many weeks it will take him to save $80. He makes $40 a week and wants to save $80, so it will take him $80 / $40/week = <<80/40=2>>2 weeks.

So, it will take John 2 weeks to save $80.
