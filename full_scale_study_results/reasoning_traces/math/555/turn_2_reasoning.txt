Question ID: 555
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. John gets paid $2 per hour.
2. He works 5 hours a day.
3. He works 4 days a week.
4. He wants to save $80.

To calculate how much he earns per week:
* Earnings per day = $2 per hour x 5 hours = $10 per day
* Earnings per week = $10 per day x 4 days = $40 per week

Now, to calculate how many weeks it will take him to save $80:
* Savings needed = $80
* Earnings per week = $40
* Weeks needed = Savings needed / Earnings per week
* Weeks needed = $80 / $40 = 2 weeks

Therefore, it will take John 2 weeks to save $80.
