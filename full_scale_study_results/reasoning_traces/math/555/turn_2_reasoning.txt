Question ID: 555
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to calculate how much money John makes in a day. He works 5 hours a day and gets paid $2 per hour. So, his daily earnings are:

5 hours/day * $2/hour = $10/day

Next, we need to calculate how much money he makes in a week. He works 4 days a week. So, his weekly earnings are:

4 days/week * $10/day = $40/week

Now, we know that John wants to save $80. To find out how many weeks it will take him to save this amount, we divide the total amount he wants to save by his weekly earnings:

$80 / $40/week = 2 weeks

So, it will take John 2 weeks to save $80.
