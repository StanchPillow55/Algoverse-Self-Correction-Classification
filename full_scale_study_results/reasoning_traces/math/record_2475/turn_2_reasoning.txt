Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine what information is missing from the passage and use logical reasoning to fill in the blank.

The passage discusses Boris Johnson's comments on Islamists and the idea of a "clash of civilizations." It mentions that he condemned the idea of a "war" and the "myth" of a "war" being perpetuated by killers. However, the passage does not provide any specific numbers or statistics.

The query asks about a statistic related to the number of Islamists, stating that they are "numbered in the low thousands yet there were one million @placeholder in."

Based on the context of the passage, the missing information is likely the number of Muslims in Britain, as Boris Johnson is discussing the distinction between Islam and "Islamism."

To find the answer, we can use the information provided in the query:
* Islamists are numbered in the low thousands
* There were one million @placeholder in

Plugging this into the sentence, the missing information is likely the number of Muslims in Britain.

Therefore, the final answer would be:

There were one million Muslims in Britain.
