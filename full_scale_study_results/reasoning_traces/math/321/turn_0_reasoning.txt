Question ID: 321
Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

Let's start by finding out how much the magazine costs. 

Since the magazine costs half as much as the book and the book costs $4, the magazine costs $4/2 = $2.

Now, we know that the pen costs $1 less than the magazine. So, the pen costs $2 - $1 = $1.

Therefore, the pen costs $1.
