Question ID: 481
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to determine the weight of each penny and then find their combined weight.

1. **Identify the weight of the 1959 penny:**
   - We are given that the 1959 penny weighs 48 grains.

2. **Determine the weight of the 2010 penny:**
   - The problem states that the 2010 penny is three-quarters of the weight of the 1959 penny.
   - To find the weight of the 2010 penny, we calculate three-quarters of 48 grains.

   \[
   \text{Weight of 2010 penny} = \frac{3}{4} \times 48
   \]

3. **Calculate the weight of the 2010 penny:**

   \[
   \frac{3}{4} \times 48 = \frac{3 \times 48}{4} = \frac{144}{4} = 36 \text{ grains}
   \]

4. **Find the combined weight of the two pennies:**
   - Now that we know the weights of both pennies, we add them together to find the total weight.

   \[
   \text{Combined weight} = \text{Weight of 1959 penny} + \text{Weight of 2010 penny}
   \]

   \[
   \text{Combined weight} = 48 \text{ grains} + 36 \text{ grains} = 84 \text{ grains}
   \]

5. **Final Answer:**
   - The combined weight of the 2010 penny and the 1959 penny is 84 grains.
