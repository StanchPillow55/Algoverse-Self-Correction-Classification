Question ID: 481
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to find out the weight of the 2010 penny. We know that it is three-quarters of the weight of the 1959 penny. 

So, we calculate three-quarters of 48 grains (the weight of the 1959 penny) as follows:

(3/4) * 48 = 36 grains

This means the 2010 penny weighs 36 grains.

Next, we add the weights of the two pennies together to find the combined weight:

48 grains (1959 penny) + 36 grains (2010 penny) = 84 grains

So, the combined weight of the two pennies is 84 grains.
