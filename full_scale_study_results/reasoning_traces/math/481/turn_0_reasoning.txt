Question ID: 481
Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to find out how much the 2010 penny weighs. We know that it is three-quarters of the weight of the 1959 penny. 

To find this, we multiply the weight of the 1959 penny by three-quarters:

48 grains * 3/4 = 36 grains

So, the 2010 penny weighs 36 grains.

Next, we add the weights of the two pennies together to find the total weight:

48 grains (1959 penny) + 36 grains (2010 penny) = 84 grains

So, the combined weight of the two pennies is 84 grains.
