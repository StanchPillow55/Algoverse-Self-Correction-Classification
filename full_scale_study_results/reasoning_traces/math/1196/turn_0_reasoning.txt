Question ID: 1196
Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to find out how many red pens Alain's mom bought. Since each pack has 5 pens and she bought 5 packs, we multiply 5 (pens) by 5 (packs) to get 25 red pens.

Next, we need to find out how many black pens she bought. We know she bought twice the amount of black pens than the red, so we multiply the number of red pens (25) by 2 to get 50 black pens.

Finally, to find out how many pens Alain has in total, we add the number of red pens (25) to the number of black pens (50) to get 75 pens.

So, Alain has 75 pens in total.
