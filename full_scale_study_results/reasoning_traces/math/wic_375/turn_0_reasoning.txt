To determine if the word 'plane' is used with the same meaning in both sentences, we need to analyze the context and the mathematical concepts involved.

Sentence 1: "Any line joining two points on a plane lies wholly on that plane."
In this sentence, the word 'plane' refers to a two-dimensional geometric surface in a three-dimensional space. This is a fundamental concept in Euclidean geometry, where a plane is a flat surface that extends infinitely in all directions.

Sentence 2: "We will refer to the plane of the graph as the X-Y plane."
In this sentence, the word 'plane' is used to describe the coordinate system in which the graph is plotted. Specifically, the X-Y plane is the two-dimensional coordinate plane formed by the x-axis and the y-axis.

Reasoning:
1. In the first sentence, the word 'plane' is used to describe a geometric surface in a three-dimensional space.
2. In the second sentence, the word 'plane' is used to describe a two-dimensional coordinate system, specifically the X-Y plane.

Therefore, the word 'plane' is not
