==================================================

To determine if the word 'plane' is used with the same meaning in both sentences, we need to analyze the context and the mathematical concepts involved.

Sentence 1: "Any line joining two points on a plane lies wholly on that plane."
In this sentence, the word 'plane' refers to a two-dimensional geometric surface in three-dimensional space.

Sentence 2: "We will refer to the plane of the graph as the X-Y plane."
In this sentence, the word 'plane' also refers to a two-dimensional geometric surface, specifically the X-Y plane, which is a coordinate plane in a Cartesian coordinate system.

Based on the context, the word 'plane' is used with the same meaning in both sentences, referring to a two-dimensional geometric surface.

Therefore, the answer is:
Yes, the word 'plane' is used with the same meaning in both sentences.
