==================================================

To determine if the word "strike" is used with the same meaning in both sentences, we need to analyze the context and the meaning of the word in each sentence.

Sentence 1: "Strike a bargain."
In this sentence, the word "strike" means to reach an agreement or make a deal. The phrase "strike a bargain" is a common idiom that refers to the act of negotiating and coming to an agreement.

Sentence 2: "We must strike the enemy's oil fields."
In this sentence, the word "strike" means to attack or hit something. The phrase "strike the enemy's oil fields" suggests a military or violent action, where the goal is to damage or destroy the enemy's resources.

Based on the analysis, the word "strike" is not used with the same meaning in both sentences. In the first sentence, it refers to reaching an agreement, while in the second sentence, it refers to a military or violent action.

Therefore, the answer is:
No, the word "strike" is not used with the same meaning in both sentences.
