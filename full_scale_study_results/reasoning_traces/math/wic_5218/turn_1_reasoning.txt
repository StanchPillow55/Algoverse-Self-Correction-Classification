==================================================

To determine if the word 'strike' is used with the same meaning in both sentences, we need to analyze the context and the meaning of the word in each sentence.

Sentence 1: "Strike a bargain."
In this sentence, the word 'strike' means to make or reach an agreement or deal. It is used in the context of negotiating or coming to a compromise.

Sentence 2: "We must strike the enemy's oil fields."
In this sentence, the word 'strike' means to attack or hit a target. It is used in the context of a military or violent action.

Based on the analysis, the word 'strike' is not used with the same meaning in both sentences. In the first sentence, it is used to mean 'make a bargain,' while in the second sentence, it is used to mean 'attack or hit a target.'

Therefore, the answer is:
No, the word 'strike' is not used with the same meaning in both sentences.
