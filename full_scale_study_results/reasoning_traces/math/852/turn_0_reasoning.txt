==================================================

First, let's calculate the total cost for the green food. 

The cost of one basket of green food is $25. If you buy 3 baskets, you multiply the cost of one basket by 3. 

25 * 3 = $75

Next, let's calculate the total cost for the red food. 

The cost of one basket of red food is $18. If you buy 3 baskets, you multiply the cost of one basket by 3. 

18 * 3 = $54

However, there is a $2 discount for each basket of red food. So, we need to subtract this discount from the total cost of the red food. 

The discount for one basket is $2. If you buy 3 baskets, you multiply the discount for one basket by 3. 

2 * 3 = $6

Now, subtract this discount from the total cost of the red food. 

54 - 6 = $48

Finally, add the total cost of the green food and the total cost of the red food (after the discount) to find the total cost for all the food. 

75 + 48 = $123

So, if you buy 3 baskets of green food and 3 baskets of red food, and you get $2 off for each basket of red food, you will have to pay $123 in total.
