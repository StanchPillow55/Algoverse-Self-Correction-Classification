Question ID: 66
Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Each school has sent a girls' basketball team and a boys' basketball team. Since each team has 5 players, that means each school has sent 5 girls + 5 boys = 10 players.

2. Each school has also sent a coach for each team. That means each school has sent 1 coach for the girls' team + 1 coach for the boys' team = 2 coaches.

3. So, each school has sent a total of 10 players + 2 coaches = 12 people.

4. Since there are 4 schools competing at the tournament, that means there are 4 schools * 12 people/school = 48 people in total.

So, in total, all of the schools have sent 48 people.
