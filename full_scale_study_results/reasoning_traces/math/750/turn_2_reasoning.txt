Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of chairs rented in a week and then multiply it by the number of weeks in two months.

First, let's calculate the total number of chairs rented in a week. During the weekdays (Monday to Friday), 60 chairs are rented each day. So, for 5 weekdays, the total number of chairs rented is 60 chairs/day * 5 days = 300 chairs.

During the weekends (Saturday and Sunday), 100 chairs are rented each day. So, for 2 weekend days, the total number of chairs rented is 100 chairs/day * 2 days = 200 chairs.

Adding these together, the total number of chairs rented in a week is 300 chairs (weekdays) + 200 chairs (weekends) = 500 chairs.

Next, we need to calculate the total number of chairs rented in two 4-week months. There are 4 weeks in a month, so there are 4 weeks/month * 2 months = 8 weeks in two months.

So, the total number of chairs rented in two 4-week months is 500 chairs/week * 8 weeks = 4000 chairs.

Therefore, Candy will be able to rent out a total of 4000 chairs in two 4-week months.
