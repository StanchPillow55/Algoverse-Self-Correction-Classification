Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of chairs rented during weekdays and weekends for two 4-week months.

First, let's calculate the number of chairs rented during weekdays:

There are 5 weekdays in a week, so in one week, the number of chairs rented is 60 chairs/day * 5 days/week = 300 chairs/week.

Since a month has 4 weeks, the number of chairs rented in one month is 300 chairs/week * 4 weeks/month = 1200 chairs/month.

For two months, the total number of chairs rented during weekdays is 1200 chairs/month * 2 months = 2400 chairs.

Next, let's calculate the number of chairs rented during weekends:

There are 2 weekends in a week, so in one week, the number of chairs rented is 100 chairs/day * 2 days/week = 200 chairs/week.

Since a month has 4 weeks, the number of chairs rented in one month is 200 chairs/week * 4 weeks/month = 800 chairs/month.

For two months, the total number of chairs rented during weekends is 800 chairs/month * 2 months = 1600 chairs.

Finally, to find the total number of chairs rented in two months, we add the number of chairs rented during weekdays and weekends:

2400 chairs (from weekdays) + 1600 chairs (from weekends) = 4000 chairs.

So, Candy will be able to rent out a total of 4000 chairs in two 4-week months.
