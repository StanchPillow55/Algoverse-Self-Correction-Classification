==================================================

First, let's determine how many weekdays and weekends there are in two 4-week months.

In a week, there are 5 weekdays and 2 weekends. So in a 4-week month, there are 5 weekdays x 4 weeks = 20 weekdays and 2 weekends x 4 weeks = 8 weekend days.

Since we're considering two 4-week months, we double these numbers. So, there are 20 weekdays x 2 = 40 weekdays and 8 weekend days x 2 = 16 weekend days.

Next, let's calculate how many chairs Candy rents out on weekdays and weekends.

On weekdays, Candy rents out 60 chairs/day x 40 days = 2400 chairs.

On weekends, Candy rents out 100 chairs/day x 16 days = 1600 chairs.

Finally, we add these two amounts to find the total number of chairs Candy rents out in two 4-week months.

So, Candy rents out 2400 chairs + 1600 chairs = 4000 chairs in total.

Therefore, Candy will be able to rent out a total of 4000 chairs in two 4-week months.
