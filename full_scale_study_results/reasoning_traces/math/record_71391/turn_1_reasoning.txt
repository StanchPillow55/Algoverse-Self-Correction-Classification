==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the percentage of the £1.2 million that has been spent by the 12 'Portas Pilot' towns.

Given information:
- The 12 'Portas Pilot' towns were awarded a total of £1.2 million.
- The towns have spent just 12 percent of their funding.

Step 1: Calculate the amount of money spent by the 12 'Portas Pilot' towns.
12% of £1.2 million = 0.12 × £1,200,000 = £144,000

Step 2: Calculate the percentage of the £1.2 million that has been spent.
Percentage of £1.2 million spent = (£144,000 / £1,200,000) × 100 = 12%

Therefore, the 12 'Portas Pilot' towns have spent 12 percent of the £1.2 million awarded to them.
