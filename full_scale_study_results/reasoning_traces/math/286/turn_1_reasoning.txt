Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

Kelly initially has 5 quarters and 2 dimes. 

First, we need to convert the value of the quarters and dimes into cents. 

1 quarter is equal to 25 cents, so 5 quarters are equal to 5 * 25 = 125 cents. 

1 dime is equal to 10 cents, so 2 dimes are equal to 2 * 10 = 20 cents. 

So, Kelly initially has 125 cents (from quarters) + 20 cents (from dimes) = 145 cents.

She then buys a can of pop for 55 cents. 

To find out how many cents she has left, we subtract the cost of the pop from her initial amount. 

So, 145 cents - 55 cents = 90 cents.

Therefore, Kelly has 90 cents left after buying the can of pop.
