==================================================

To determine how many cents Kelly will have left after buying a can of pop for 55 cents, we first need to calculate the total amount of money she has.

1. **Calculate the value of the quarters:**
   - Kelly has 5 quarters.
   - Each quarter is worth 25 cents.
   - Therefore, the total value of the quarters is:
     \[
     5 \text{ quarters} \times 25 \text{ cents/quarter} = 125 \text{ cents}
     \]

2. **Calculate the value of the dimes:**
   - Kelly has 2 dimes.
   - Each dime is worth 10 cents.
   - Therefore, the total value of the dimes is:
     \[
     2 \text{ dimes} \times 10 \text{ cents/dime} = 20 \text{ cents}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total amount of money Kelly has:**
   - Now we add the total value of the quarters and the dimes:
     \[
     125 \text{ cents} + 20 \text{ cents} = 145 \text{ cents}
     \]

4. **Subtract the cost of the can of pop:**
   - Kelly buys a can of pop for 55 cents.
   - We need to subtract this amount from her total money:
     \[
     145 \text{ cents} - 55 \text{ cents} = 90 \text{ cents}
     \]

5. **Final answer:**
   - After buying the can of pop, Kelly will have 90 cents left.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{90}
\]
