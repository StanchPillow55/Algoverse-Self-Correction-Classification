==================================================

Kelly initially has 5 quarters and 2 dimes. 

First, we need to convert the value of the quarters and dimes into cents. 

1 quarter is equal to 25 cents. So, 5 quarters would be 5 * 25 = 125 cents. 

1 dime is equal to 10 cents. So, 2 dimes would be 2 * 10 = 20 cents. 

Adding these together, Kelly initially has 125 + 20 = 145 cents. 

She then buys a can of pop for 55 cents. 

To find out how many cents she has left, we subtract the cost of the pop from her initial amount. 

145 - 55 = 90 cents. 

So, Kelly has 90 cents left after buying the can of pop.
