Question ID: 286
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, let's determine how much money Kelly initially has. 

We know that a quarter is worth 25 cents and a dime is worth 10 cents. 

So, if Kelly has 5 quarters, she has 5 * 25 = 125 cents. 

If she has 2 dimes, she has 2 * 10 = 20 cents. 

Adding these together, Kelly initially has 125 + 20 = 145 cents. 

Now, if she buys a can of pop for 55 cents, we need to subtract this amount from her initial total. 

So, 145 - 55 = 90 cents. 

Therefore, Kelly will have 90 cents left after buying the can of pop.
