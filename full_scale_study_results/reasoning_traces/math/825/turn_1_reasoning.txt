Dataset Type: math
==================================================

Let's denote the number of cards that PJ has as P, the number of cards that Smendrick has as S, and the number of cards that Becca has as B.

From the problem, we know that:

B = S + 12 (Becca has 12 more cards than Smendrick)
S = 3P (Smendrick has 3 times the number of cards that PJ has)
B + S + P = 341 (The total number of cards is 341)

We can substitute the second equation into the first to get:

B = 3P + 12

And then substitute both the first and second equations into the third to get:

3P + 12 + 3P + P = 341
7P + 12 = 341
7P = 341 - 12
7P = 329
P = 329 / 7
P = 47

Substitute P = 47 into the second equation to get:

S = 3 * 47
S = 141

Substitute S = 141 into the first equation to get:

B = 141 + 12
B = 153

So, Becca has 153 cards.
