==================================================

Let's denote the number of cards that PJ has as x. According to the problem, Smendrick has 3 times the amount of cards that PJ has, so Smendrick has 3x cards. Becca has 12 more cards than Smendrick, so Becca has 3x + 12 cards.

The total number of cards is the sum of the cards that each person has, so we can write the equation:

x (PJ's cards) + 3x (Smendrick's cards) + 3x + 12 (Becca's cards) = 341

Combining like terms, we get:

7x + 12 = 341

Subtracting 12 from both sides of the equation, we get:

7x = 329

Finally, dividing both sides of the equation by 7, we find:

x = 47

So, PJ has 47 cards, Smendrick has 3 * 47 = 141 cards, and Becca has 141 + 12 = 153 cards.

Therefore, Becca has 153 Magic Cards.
