==================================================

To solve this problem, I need to analyze the information provided in the paragraph and identify the part of Portugal that is not known for quaint cities.

The paragraph states:
"Most of Portugal is known for quaint towns, medieval castles, and grand palaces. The Algarve is more recognizable for impenetrable blocks of tourist apartments, hotels, and meticulously manicured golf courses."

This suggests that the Algarve region of Portugal is not known for quaint cities, in contrast with the rest of the country.

The paragraph also mentions that the Algarve is divided into two parts: the rugged Barlavento to the west and the flat Sotavento to the east.

Since the paragraph specifically states that the Algarve is not known for quaint cities, and it further divides the Algarve into Barlavento and Sotavento, the logical conclusion is that Sotavento, the eastern part of the Algarve, is the region that is not known for quaint cities.

Therefore, the answer is:
Sotavento
