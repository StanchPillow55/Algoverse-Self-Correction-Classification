Question ID: multirc_11468
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, I will go through the given paragraph step by step and identify the relevant information that answers the question.

The paragraph states:
"Most of Portugal is known for quaint towns, medieval castles, and grand palaces. The Algarve is more recognizable for impenetrable blocks of tourist apartments, hotels, and meticulously manicured golf courses."

This suggests that the Algarve region of Portugal is not known for quaint cities, unlike the rest of the country.

The paragraph also mentions that the Algarve is divided into two parts:
"The coast is neatly divided into the rugged Barlavento to the west and the flat beauty of Sotavento to the east."

Since the paragraph states that the Algarve is not known for quaint cities, and it specifically mentions the Sotavento region as being "flat beauty", we can infer that the Sotavento region of the Algarve is not known for quaint cities.

Therefore, the part of Portugal that is not known for quaint cities is Sotavento.

Final answer: Sotavento
