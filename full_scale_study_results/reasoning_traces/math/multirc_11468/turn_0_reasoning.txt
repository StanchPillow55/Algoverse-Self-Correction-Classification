==================================================

To determine which part of Portugal is not known for quaint cities, we need to analyze the information provided in the paragraph.

The paragraph states that "Most of Portugal is known for quaint towns, medieval castles, and grand palaces." However, it also mentions that "The Algarve is more recognizable for impenetrable blocks of tourist apartments, hotels, and meticulously manicured golf courses. And beaches."

The paragraph further divides the Algarve region into two parts: the rugged Barlavento to the west and the flat Sotavento to the east.

Based on this information, we can conclude that the Sotavento region of the Algarve is not known for quaint cities, as the paragraph specifically states that the Algarve is "more recognizable for impenetrable blocks of tourist apartments, hotels, and meticulously manicured golf courses."

Therefore, the part of Portugal that is not known for quaint cities is the Sotavento region of the Algarve.

Final answer: Sotavento
