Question ID: 486
Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to figure out how many miles James runs in a week. Since he runs 12 miles a day for 5 days a week, we can calculate this by multiplying the number of miles he runs a day by the number of days he runs in a week.

12 miles/day * 5 days/week = 60 miles/week

Next, we need to figure out how many hours it takes him to run these 60 miles. Since he runs at a speed of 10 miles per hour, we can calculate this by dividing the total number of miles he runs in a week by his speed.

60 miles/week รท 10 miles/hour = 6 hours/week

So, James runs for 6 hours a week.
