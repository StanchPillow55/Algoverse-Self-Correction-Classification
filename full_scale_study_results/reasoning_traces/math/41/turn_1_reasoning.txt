==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine how far Polly can stand from the dragon while still being able to hit it with the gold javelin, given that she is holding the sapphire gemstone.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Throwing Distance Without Gemstone:**
   - Polly can throw the javelin 400 feet without the gemstone.

2. **Effect of the Sapphire Gemstone:**
   - When holding the gemstone, Polly can throw the javelin three times farther than without it.
   - Therefore, the distance Polly can throw the javelin with the gemstone is:
     \[
     3 \times 400 \text{ feet} = 1200 \text{ feet}
     \]

3. **Dragon's Flame Reach:**
   - The dragon can breathe fire up to a distance of 1000 feet.

4. **Calculating Safe Distance:**
   - To determine how far outside the dragon's flame reach Polly can stand, we need to consider the maximum distance she can throw the javelin (1200 feet) and the reach of the dragon's flames (1000 feet).
   - Polly can stand at a distance where the difference between her throwing distance and the dragon's flame reach is maximized while still being able to hit the dragon.
   - The maximum distance Polly can stand from the dragon and still hit it is:
     \[
     1200 \text{ feet (throwing distance)} - 1000 \text{ feet (flame reach)} = 200 \text{ feet}
     \]

Therefore, Polly can stand 200 feet outside the reach of the dragon's flames and still hit the dragon with the gold javelin when she is holding the sapphire gemstone.

**Final Answer:**
Polly can stand 200 feet outside the reach of the dragon's flames and still hit the dragon with the gold javelin.
