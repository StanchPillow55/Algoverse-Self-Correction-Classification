==================================================

To solve this problem, we first need to determine how far Polly can throw the javelin when she is holding the sapphire gemstone. 

We know that without the gemstone, Polly can throw the javelin 400 feet. When she holds the gemstone, she can throw the javelin three times farther. Therefore, we multiply 400 feet by 3 to find the distance she can throw the javelin with the gemstone:

400 feet * 3 = 1200 feet

So, when holding the gemstone, Polly can throw the javelin 1200 feet.

Next, we need to determine how far outside of the reach of the dragon's flames Polly can stand and still hit the dragon. 

We know that the dragon's flames reach 1000 feet. Since Polly can throw the javelin 1200 feet, she can stand 200 feet outside of the reach of the dragon's flames and still hit the dragon. 

This is because 1200 feet (the distance Polly can throw the javelin) - 1000 feet (the reach of the dragon's flames) = 200 feet.

Therefore, Polly can stand 200 feet outside of the reach of the dragon's flames and still hit the dragon with the gold javelin when she is holding the sapphire gemstone.
