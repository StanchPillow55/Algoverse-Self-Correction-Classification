==================================================

Let's denote the total capacity of the power bank as 100%. 

We know that the power bank was losing 9% of its total capacity each hour for 5 hours. This means that it lost 5 * 9% = 45% of its total capacity during this time.

Then, the power bank started to lose 7% of its total capacity each hour for 3 hours. This means that it lost 3 * 7% = 21% of its total capacity during this time.

So, in total, the power bank lost 45% + 21% = 66% of its total capacity.

We know that in the end, the charge remaining was 28% of the total capacity. This means that before the power bank started to lose charge, it must have been charged to 28% + 66% = 94% of its total capacity.

Therefore, the charge of the power bank when Maria went out to the park was 94%.
