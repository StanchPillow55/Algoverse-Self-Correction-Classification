==================================================

Let's break this problem down into parts.

First, we know that Alexandra raises $430. Since Kim raises $320 more than Alexandra, we can calculate how much Kim raises by adding $320 to Alexandra's total. 

Kim's total = Alexandra's total + $320
Kim's total = $430 + $320
Kim's total = $750

Next, we know that Sarah raises $300. Since Maryam raises $400 more than Sarah, we can calculate how much Maryam raises by adding $400 to Sarah's total.

Maryam's total = Sarah's total + $400
Maryam's total = $300 + $400
Maryam's total = $700

Finally, to find out how much money they all raised in total, we add up the amounts that each girl raised.

Total amount = Kim's total + Alexandra's total + Maryam's total + Sarah's total
Total amount = $750 + $430 + $700 + $300
Total amount = $2180

So, the girls raised a total of $2180 for the carnival.
