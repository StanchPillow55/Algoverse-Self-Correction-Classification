Question ID: 1309
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we know that Kim raises $320 more than Alexandra. Since Alexandra raises $430, we can calculate how much Kim raises by adding $320 to Alexandra's total. 

Kim's total = Alexandra's total + $320
Kim's total = $430 + $320
Kim's total = $750

Next, we know that Maryam raises $400 more than Sarah. Since Sarah raises $300, we can calculate how much Maryam raises by adding $400 to Sarah's total.

Maryam's total = Sarah's total + $400
Maryam's total = $300 + $400
Maryam's total = $700

Now, we can calculate the total amount of money raised by all four girls by adding together the amounts each girl raised.

Total raised = Kim's total + Alexandra's total + Maryam's total + Sarah's total
Total raised = $750 + $430 + $700 + $300
Total raised = $2180

So, the girls raised a total of $2180 for the carnival.
