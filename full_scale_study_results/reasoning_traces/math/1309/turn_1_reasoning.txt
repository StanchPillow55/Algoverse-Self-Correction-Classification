Question ID: 1309
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

Let's break down the problem into smaller parts.

First, we know that Kim raises $320 more than Alexandra. Since Alexandra raises $430, we can calculate how much Kim raises by adding $320 to $430.

$430 + $320 = $750

So, Kim raises $750.

Next, we know that Maryam raises $400 more than Sarah. Since Sarah raises $300, we can calculate how much Maryam raises by adding $400 to $300.

$300 + $400 = $700

So, Maryam raises $700.

Now, we know how much each girl raises:

- Kim raises $750
- Alexandra raises $430
- Maryam raises $700
- Sarah raises $300

To find out how much they all raise in total, we add up all these amounts:

$750 (Kim) + $430 (Alexandra) + $700 (Maryam) + $300 (Sarah) = $2180

So, the girls raised a total of $2180.
