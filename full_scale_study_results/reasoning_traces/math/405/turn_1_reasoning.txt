Question ID: 405
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to determine how many sandwiches Tyson needs to make to serve 20 people. Since each sandwich serves 4 people, Tyson will need to make 20/4 = 5 sandwiches.

Next, we calculate the cost of the meat and cheese for each sandwich. Each sandwich requires 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese. The meat costs $7.00 per pound and the cheese costs $3.00 per pound. Therefore, the cost for the meat and cheese for each sandwich is $7.00 + $3.00 = $10.00.

Finally, we multiply the cost of the meat and cheese for each sandwich by the number of sandwiches Tyson needs to make. This gives us $10.00 * 5 = $50.00.

So, Tyson would spend $50.00 on the meat and cheese to make enough sandwiches to serve 20 people.
