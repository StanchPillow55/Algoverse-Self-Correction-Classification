==================================================

First, we need to determine how many sandwiches Tyson needs to make. Since each sandwich serves 4 people, and there will be 20 people at the game, Tyson needs to make 20 / 4 = <<20/4=5>>5 sandwiches.

Next, we need to calculate how much meat and cheese Tyson needs to buy. Since each sandwich requires 1 pound of meat and 1 pound of cheese, Tyson needs to buy 5 * 1 = <<5*1=5>>5 pounds of meat and 5 * 1 = <<5*1=5>>5 pounds of cheese.

Now, we need to calculate how much Tyson will spend on the meat and cheese. The meat costs $7.00 per pound, so Tyson will spend 5 * $7.00 = $<<5*7=35.00>>35.00 on meat. The cheese costs $3.00 per pound, so Tyson will spend 5 * $3.00 = $<<5*3=15.00>>15.00 on cheese.

Finally, we add the cost of the meat and cheese to find the total cost. Tyson will spend $35.00 + $15.00 = $<<35+15=50.00>>50.00 on meat and cheese to make enough sandwiches to serve 20 people.
