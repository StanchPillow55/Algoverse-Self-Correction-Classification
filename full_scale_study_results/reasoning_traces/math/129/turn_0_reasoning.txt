Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to find out how many hours each patient is seen for. Since each patient is seen for an average of 24 minutes, and there are 60 minutes in an hour, we divide 24 by 60 to get 0.4 hours.

Next, we need to find out how much the hospital pays the doctors for each patient. Since the doctors charge $150 an hour, and each patient is seen for 0.4 hours, we multiply 150 by 0.4 to get $60. This is how much the hospital pays the doctors for each patient.

Then, we need to find out how much the hospital charges each patient. Since the hospital charges $200 an hour, and each patient is seen for 0.4 hours, we multiply 200 by 0.4 to get $80. This is how much the hospital charges each patient.

To find out how much profit the hospital makes from each patient, we subtract the cost (what the hospital pays the doctors) from the revenue (what the hospital charges the patients). So, we subtract 60 from 80 to get $20. This is the profit the hospital makes from each patient.

Finally, to find out how much profit the hospital makes from all the patients in a day, we multiply the profit per patient by the number of patients. So, we multiply 20 by 500 to get $10,000.

Therefore, the hospital makes a profit of $10,000 from these visits each day.
