Question ID: 129
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to calculate how many hours each patient is seen for. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we divide the 24 minutes by 60 to get 0.4 hours. 

Next, we need to calculate how much the hospital pays the doctors for each patient. We multiply the number of hours each patient is seen (0.4 hours) by the doctors' hourly rate ($150/hour) to get $60. 

Then, we calculate how much the hospital charges each patient. We multiply the number of hours each patient is seen (0.4 hours) by the hospital's hourly rate ($200/hour) to get $80. 

The profit the hospital makes from each patient is the difference between what it charges the patient and what it pays the doctors. We subtract the doctors' fee ($60) from the hospital's charge ($80) to get $20. 

Finally, we calculate the total profit the hospital makes from all the patients it sees in a day. We multiply the profit from each patient ($20) by the number of patients seen in a day (500) to get $10,000. 

So, the hospital makes a profit of $10,000 from these visits.
