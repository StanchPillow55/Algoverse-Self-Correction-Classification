Question ID: 129
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, let's calculate how many hours each patient spends at the hospital. Since each patient is seen for an average of 24 minutes, we need to convert this time to hours. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so we divide 24 by 60:

24 minutes / 60 = 0.4 hours

Next, let's calculate how much the hospital pays the doctors for each patient. Since the doctors charge $150 per hour, and each patient is seen for 0.4 hours, we multiply these two numbers together:

$150 * 0.4 = $60

This means the hospital pays the doctors $60 for each patient.

Now, let's calculate how much the hospital charges each patient. Since the hospital charges $200 per hour, and each patient is seen for 0.4 hours, we multiply these two numbers together:

$200 * 0.4 = $80

This means the hospital charges each patient $80.

The profit the hospital makes from each patient is the difference between what it charges the patient and what it pays the doctors. So we subtract the cost of the doctors from the charge to the patient:

$80 - $60 = $20

This means the hospital makes a profit of $20 from each patient.

Finally, let's calculate the total profit the hospital makes from all the patients it sees in a day. Since the hospital sees 500 patients a day, and it makes a profit of $20 from each patient, we multiply these two numbers together:

500 * $20 = $10,000

So, the hospital makes a profit of $10,000 from these visits each day.
