Question ID: 557
Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, let's find out how many buttons had four holes. We know that there were 21 buttons in total and 7 of them had two holes. So, we subtract 7 from 21 to find out how many buttons had four holes.

21 - 7 = 14 buttons

So, 14 buttons had four holes.

Next, we need to find out how many holes there were in total. We know that each button with two holes had 2 holes and each button with four holes had 4 holes.

So, we multiply the number of buttons by the number of holes for each type of button.

For the buttons with two holes: 7 buttons * 2 holes = 14 holes
For the buttons with four holes: 14 buttons * 4 holes = 56 holes

Finally, we add these two amounts together to find the total number of holes.

14 holes + 56 holes = 70 holes

So, there were 70 holes in all the buttons in the bag.
