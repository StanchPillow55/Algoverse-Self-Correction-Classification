Question ID: 557
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to find out how many buttons had four holes. We know that there were 21 buttons in total and that 7 of them had two holes. So, we subtract 7 from 21 to find the number of buttons with four holes.

21 - 7 = 14 buttons

So, there were 14 buttons with four holes.

Next, we need to calculate the total number of holes. We know that each button with two holes has 2 holes and each button with four holes has 4 holes. So, we multiply the number of each type of button by the number of holes they have and then add those two amounts together.

For the buttons with two holes:

7 buttons * 2 holes = 14 holes

For the buttons with four holes:

14 buttons * 4 holes = 56 holes

Then we add those two amounts together to find the total number of holes:

14 holes + 56 holes = 70 holes

So, there were 70 holes in all the buttons in the bag.
