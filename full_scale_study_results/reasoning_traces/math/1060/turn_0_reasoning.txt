Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to find out how many slices of pizza there were in total. Since each pizza had 8 slices and there were 4 pizzas, we multiply 8 by 4 to get 32 slices.

Next, we know that Becky ate 10 slices. We also know that Becky ate 3 more slices than Jake did. So, to find out how many slices Jake ate, we subtract 3 from the number of slices Becky ate. This gives us 10 - 3 = 7 slices for Jake.

We also know that Silvia ate twice as many slices as Jake did. So, we multiply the number of slices Jake ate by 2 to find out how many slices Silvia ate. This gives us 7 * 2 = 14 slices for Silvia.

Finally, to find out how many total slices they ate, we add up the number of slices each person ate. This gives us 10 (for Becky) + 7 (for Jake) + 14 (for Silvia) = 31 slices.

So, they ate a total of 31 slices.
