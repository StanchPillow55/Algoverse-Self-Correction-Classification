Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to find the total cost of the items before the coupon is applied. 

The cost of the pots is $19 and the cost of the garden soil is $26. 

So, we add these two amounts together:

$19 (for the pots) + $26 (for the soil) = $45

This is the total cost of the items before the coupon is applied. 

Next, we need to subtract the value of the coupon from the total cost. The coupon is worth $7.

So, we subtract $7 from $45:

$45 (total cost) - $7 (coupon) = $38

So, after using the coupon, my mom spent $38 at the gardening shop. 

Therefore, the final answer is $38.
