Question ID: 337
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to find out how many hot dogs Thomas ate. Since Thomas ate three times more hot dogs than Luke, and Luke ate 2 hot dogs, we multiply 2 by 3. 

2 * 3 = 6 hot dogs

So, Thomas ate 6 hot dogs.

Next, we need to find out how many hot dogs John ate. Since John ate half the amount that Thomas ate, and Thomas ate 6 hot dogs, we divide 6 by 2.

6 / 2 = 3 hot dogs

So, John ate 3 hot dogs.

Finally, we need to find out how many more hot dogs John ate than Luke. Since John ate 3 hot dogs and Luke ate 2 hot dogs, we subtract 2 from 3.

3 - 2 = 1 hot dog

So, John ate 1 more hot dog than Luke. 

Final Answer: John ate 1 more hot dog than Luke.
