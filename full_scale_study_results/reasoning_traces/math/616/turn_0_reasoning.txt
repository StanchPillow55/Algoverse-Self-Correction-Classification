==================================================

Let's solve this step by step.

In the first week, the beanstalk was 3 inches tall.

In the second week, the height of the beanstalk doubled. So, we multiply the first week's height by 2. 

3 inches * 2 = 6 inches

So, after the second week, the beanstalk was 6 inches tall.

In the third week, the beanstalk grew another 4 inches. So, we add 4 inches to the height from the second week.

6 inches + 4 inches = 10 inches

So, after three weeks, the beanstalk was 10 inches tall.

Therefore, the final answer is that the beanstalk was 10 inches tall after 3 weeks.
