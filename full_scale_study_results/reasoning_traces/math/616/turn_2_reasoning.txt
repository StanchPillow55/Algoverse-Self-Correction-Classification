Question ID: 616
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

Step 1: After the first week, the beanstalk was 3 inches tall.

Step 2: In the second week, the beanstalk doubled in height. So, we multiply the first week's height by 2. 
3 inches * 2 = 6 inches

Step 3: In the third week, the beanstalk grew another 4 inches. So, we add this to the height from the second week.
6 inches + 4 inches = 10 inches

So, after 3 weeks, the beanstalk was 10 inches tall.
