Dataset Type: math
==================================================

Step 1: Identify the growth pattern of the beanstalk.

The problem states that the beanstalk was 3 inches tall after the first week. In the second week, it doubled in height. In the third week, it grew an additional 4 inches.

Step 2: Calculate the height after the second week.

To find the height of the beanstalk after the second week, we need to double its height from the first week. This is because the problem states that the beanstalk doubled in height during the second week.

So, the calculation is: 3 inches (height after first week) x 2 = 6 inches.

Step 3: Calculate the height after the third week.

The problem states that the beanstalk grew an additional 4 inches in the third week. So, we add this growth to the height from the second week.

The calculation is: 6 inches (height after second week) + 4 inches = 10 inches.

Step 4: State the final answer.

Therefore, the beanstalk was 10 inches tall after 3 weeks.
