==================================================

To determine when the operatives assigned to the planes operation arrived in the United States, I will go through the information provided in the paragraph step-by-step:

1. The paragraph states that "By late May 2000, two operatives assigned to the planes operation were already in the United States."
2. It then states that "Three of the four Hamburg cell members would soon arrive."
3. From this, we can infer that the two operatives mentioned arrived in the U.S. by late May 2000.
4. The paragraph also mentions that the Hamburg cell members (Atta, Shehhi, Jarrah, and Binalshibh) would "soon arrive" after the two operatives were already in the U.S.
5. Therefore, the operatives assigned to the planes operation arrived in the U.S. by late May 2000.

Final answer: The operatives assigned to the planes operation arrived in the U.S. by late May 2000.
