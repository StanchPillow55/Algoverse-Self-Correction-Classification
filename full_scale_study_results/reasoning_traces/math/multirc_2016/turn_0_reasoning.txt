==================================================

To determine when the operatives assigned to the planes operation arrived in the United States, I will go through the information provided in the paragraph step-by-step.

The key details from the paragraph are:
1. The 9/11 plotters spent somewhere between $400,000 and $500,000 to plan and conduct their attack.
2. The 19 operatives were funded by al Qaeda, either through wire transfers or cash provided by KSM.
3. The Hamburg cell members (Atta, Shehhi, Jarrah, and Binalshibh) did not receive funds from al Qaeda before late 1999.
4. After the Hamburg recruits joined the 9/11 conspiracy, al Qaeda began giving them money.
5. According to KSM, the Hamburg cell members each received $5,000 to pay for their return to Germany from Afghanistan after they had been selected to join the plot, and they received additional funds for travel from Germany to the United States.
6. By late May 2000, two operatives assigned to the planes operation were already in the United States. Three of the four Hamburg cell members would soon arrive.
