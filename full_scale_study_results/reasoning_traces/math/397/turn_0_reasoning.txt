Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to determine how much more money Mark needs to save to be able to afford the bike. We do this by subtracting the amount of money he currently has from the cost of the bike.

So, $300 (cost of the bike) - $50 (Mark's current savings) = $250. 

This means Mark needs to save an additional $250 to be able to afford the bike.

Next, we need to determine how many days it will take Mark to save this amount, given that he earns $10 per day. We do this by dividing the total amount he needs to save by the amount he earns per day.

So, $250 รท $10/day = 25 days.

Therefore, Mark needs to save his money for 25 more days to be able to afford the bike.
