Question ID: 397
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to find out how much more money Mark needs to save to reach $300 and then divide that amount by how much he earns per day.

First, we subtract the amount Mark already has from the total cost of the bike:

$300 - $50 = $250

So, Mark needs to save $250 more to buy the bike.

Next, we divide the amount Mark needs to save by how much he earns per day:

$250 รท $10/day = 25 days

So, Mark needs to work and save his earnings for 25 more days to have enough money to buy the bike.

Therefore, the final answer is 25 days.
