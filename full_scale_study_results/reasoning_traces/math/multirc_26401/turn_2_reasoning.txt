Question ID: multirc_26401
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to carefully analyze the information provided in the paragraph and identify the key details that answer the question.

Given information:
- Earthquakes outline the movement of the Earth's crust, which is broken up into regions or plates.
- Earthquakes happen most often along these plate boundaries.
- The movements of the plates are called plate tectonics.
- The Earth's crust is divided into about a dozen large plates and several small ones.
- The plates move at a rate of a few centimeters per year, which is about the same rate as fingernails grow.

The question asks: "What moves at the same rate that fingernails grow?"

Based on the information provided in the paragraph, the answer is:
The plates move at the same rate that fingernails grow.

Reasoning:
The paragraph states that the plates move only a few centimeters per year, which is about the same rate as fingernails grow. This means that the plates, which are part of the Earth's crust, move at the same rate as fingernails grow.

Therefore, the answer to the question "What moves at the same rate that fingernails grow
