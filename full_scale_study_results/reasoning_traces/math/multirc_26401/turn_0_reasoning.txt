==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to analyze the information provided in the paragraph and identify the key details that answer the question.

Given information:
- Plates in the Earth's crust move at a rate of a few centimeters per year.
- This rate is about the same as the rate at which fingernails grow.

The question asks what moves at the same rate as fingernails grow.

Reasoning:
The paragraph states that the plates in the Earth's crust move at a rate of a few centimeters per year, which is about the same as the rate at which fingernails grow. This suggests that the Earth's crust, or the plates that make up the Earth's crust, move at the same rate as fingernails grow.

Therefore, the answer to the question "What moves at the same rate that fingernails grow?" is the Earth.

Final answer:
The Earth moves at the same rate that fingernails grow.
