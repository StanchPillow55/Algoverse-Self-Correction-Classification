Question ID: 1015
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, let's calculate the total number of sweets Anne purchased. Since each pack contains 60 pieces and there are 15 packs in a box, the total number of sweets is 15 packs * 60 pieces/pack = 900 pieces.

Anne kept two packs for herself, which means she kept 2 packs * 60 pieces/pack = 120 pieces.

The number of sweets she gave to her friends is the total number of sweets minus the number she kept for herself. So, 900 pieces - 120 pieces = 780 pieces.

Anne has 10 friends and she gave the sweets to them equally. Therefore, each friend received 780 pieces / 10 friends = 78 pieces.

So, each of Anne's friends received 78 pieces of sweets.
