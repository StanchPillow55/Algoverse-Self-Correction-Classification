Question ID: 1015
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, let's calculate the total number of sweets Anne purchased. Since each pack contains 60 pieces and there are 15 packs in a box, the total number of sweets is 15 packs * 60 pieces/pack = 900 pieces.

Anne kept two packs for herself. Since each pack contains 60 pieces, the number of sweets she kept is 2 packs * 60 pieces/pack = 120 pieces.

To find out how many sweets she gave to her friends, we subtract the number of sweets she kept from the total number of sweets she purchased. This gives us 900 pieces - 120 pieces = 780 pieces.

Anne has 10 friends and she gave all the remaining sweets to them equally. Therefore, each friend received 780 pieces / 10 friends = 78 pieces.

So, each of Anne's friends received 78 pieces of sweets.
