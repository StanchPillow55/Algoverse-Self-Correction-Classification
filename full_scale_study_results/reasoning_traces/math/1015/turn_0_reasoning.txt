Question ID: 1015
Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, let's find out how many packs of sweets Anne gave to her friends. She kept 2 packs for herself, so she gave away 15 packs - 2 packs = 13 packs.

Next, let's find out how many pieces of sweets are in those 13 packs. Each pack has 60 pieces, so 13 packs * 60 pieces/pack = 780 pieces.

Finally, let's divide the total number of pieces by the number of friends to find out how many pieces each friend received. There are 780 pieces / 10 friends = 78 pieces.

So, each of Anne's friends received 78 pieces of sweets.
