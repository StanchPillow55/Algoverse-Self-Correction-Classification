==================================================

To solve this problem, I will break it down step-by-step:

1. Identify the key information in the passage:
   - The passage discusses the low approval rating of the previous Congress and the challenges facing the new 113th Congress.
   - It mentions that the new Congress members are optimistic about reaching across the aisle, but that this is likely to falter.
   - The passage also mentions the fiscal cliff, the sequester, the debt ceiling, and aid for Superstorm Sandy victims as upcoming issues the new Congress will have to deal with.

2. Identify the relevant quote from the passage:
   - "While I will negotiate over many things, I will not have another debate with this @placeholder over whether or not they should pay the bills that they've already racked up through the laws that they've passed," he said shortly after the House passed the fiscal cliff bill.

3. Analyze the quote:
   - The speaker is saying that they will negotiate on many things, but they will not debate whether the bills that have already been passed should be paid.
   - The speaker is referring to "this @placeholder", which likely means the opposing political party or faction.
