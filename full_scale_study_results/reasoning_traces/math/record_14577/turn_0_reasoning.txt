==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given passage and the query to understand the context and then provide a logical response.

Given information:
- The passage discusses the low approval rating of the previous Congress and the challenges faced by the new 113th Congress.
- The query is a quote from a political figure, likely the President, regarding negotiations over paying bills and the debt ceiling.

Reasoning:
1. The passage suggests that the new Congress faces significant challenges in bridging the partisan divide and achieving bipartisan cooperation.
2. The quote from the political figure indicates a firm stance on not negotiating over whether to pay the bills that have already been incurred through previous legislation.
3. This suggests that the political figure is unwilling to engage in further debates or negotiations over the debt ceiling, as the bills have already been accrued and need to be paid.
4. The political figure is likely taking this stance to avoid the type of partisan gridlock and brinksmanship that has characterized past debt ceiling negotiations, which have had negative consequences for the economy and the country's creditworthiness.

Final answer:
The political figure is asserting that they will not engage in another debate over whether to pay
