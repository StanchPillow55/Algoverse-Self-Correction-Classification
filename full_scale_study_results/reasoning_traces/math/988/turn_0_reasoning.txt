==================================================

First, we need to determine how much money Jessica sets aside each month for shoes. 

She makes $2,000.00 a month and sets aside 25% of this for shoes. 

To calculate this, we multiply her monthly income by the percentage she sets aside:

$2,000.00 * 0.25 = $500.00

So, Jessica sets aside $500.00 each month for shoes.

Next, we need to determine how much money she sets aside in a year. 

There are 12 months in a year, so we multiply the amount she sets aside each month by 12:

$500.00 * 12 = $6,000.00

So, Jessica sets aside $6,000.00 a year for shoes.

Finally, we need to determine how many pairs of shoes she can buy with this money. 

Each pair of shoes costs $1,000.00, so we divide the total amount of money she sets aside by the cost of each pair of shoes:

$6,000.00 / $1,000.00 = 6 pairs of shoes

So, Jessica can buy 6 pairs of shoes in a year.
