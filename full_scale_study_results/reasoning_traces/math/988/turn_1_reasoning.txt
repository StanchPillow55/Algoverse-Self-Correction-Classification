Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to calculate how much money Jessica sets aside each month for shoes. 

Since she sets aside 25% of her paycheck, we multiply her monthly income by 25% (or 0.25) to find out how much she saves each month for shoes. 

$2,000.00 * 0.25 = $500.00

So, Jessica saves $500.00 each month for shoes. 

Next, we need to calculate how much money she saves in a year. Since there are 12 months in a year, we multiply the amount she saves each month by 12. 

$500.00 * 12 = $6,000.00

So, Jessica saves $6,000.00 a year for shoes. 

Finally, we need to determine how many pairs of shoes she can buy with the money she saves. Since each pair of shoes costs $1,000.00, we divide the total amount she saves by the cost of each pair of shoes. 

$6,000.00 / $1,000.00 = 6 pairs of shoes

Therefore, Jessica can buy 6 pairs of shoes in a year.
