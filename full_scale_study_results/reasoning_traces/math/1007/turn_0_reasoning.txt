==================================================

Let's solve this problem step by step.

First, we know that there are 9 red sticks.

Second, we know that there are 5 more blue sticks than red sticks. Since there are 9 red sticks, this means there are 9 + 5 = 14 blue sticks.

Third, we know that the number of yellow sticks is 3 less than the blue sticks. Since there are 14 blue sticks, this means there are 14 - 3 = 11 yellow sticks.

Finally, to find the total number of sticks, we add the number of red, blue, and yellow sticks together. This gives us 9 red + 14 blue + 11 yellow = 34 sticks.

So, they have 34 sticks in total.
