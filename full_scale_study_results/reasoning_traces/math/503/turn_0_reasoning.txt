==================================================

Let's solve this problem step by step.

Step 1: Find the width of the rug.
The problem states that the rug is 5 feet wider than the chair. Given that the chair is 3 feet wide, we can find the width of the rug by adding 5 feet to the width of the chair. 

Width of the rug = Width of the chair + 5 feet 
= 3 feet + 5 feet 
= 8 feet

Step 2: Find the length of the couch.
The problem states that the couch is 2 feet longer than twice the width of the rug. We can find the length of the couch by multiplying the width of the rug by 2 and then adding 2 feet.

Length of the couch = 2 * Width of the rug + 2 feet 
= 2 * 8 feet + 2 feet 
= 16 feet + 2 feet 
= 18 feet

So, the couch is 18 feet long.
