==================================================

Let \( L \) be the number of insects Lily found, \( D \) be the number of insects David found, and \( B \) be the number of insects Bodhi found. We can set up the following equations based on the problem statement:

1. The total number of insects collected by Lily, David, and Bodhi is:
   \[
   L + D + B = 43
   \]

2. Lily found 7 more insects than David:
   \[
   L = D + 7
   \]

3. David found half of what Bodhi found:
   \[
   D = \frac{1}{2}B
   \]

Now, we can substitute the expressions for \( L \) and \( D \) into the first equation.

First, substitute \( D = \frac{1}{2}B \) into \( L = D + 7 \):
\[
L = \frac{1}{2}B + 7
\]

Now substitute \( L \) and \( D \) into the total equation:
\[
\left(\frac{1}{2}B + 7\right) + \left(\frac{1}{2}B\right) + B = 43
\]

Combine like terms:
\[
\frac{1}{2}B + 7 + \frac{1}{2}B + B = 43
\]
\[
(1 + 1)B + 7 = 43
\]
\[
2B + 7 = 43
\]

Now, isolate \( B \):
\[
2B = 43 - 7
\]
\[
2B = 36
\]
\[
B = 18
\]

Now that we have \( B \), we can find \( D \):
\[
D = \frac{1}{2}B = \frac{1}{2} \times 18 = 9
\]

Next, we can find \( L \):
\[
L = D + 7 = 9 + 7 = 16
\]

Thus, the number of insects Lily found is:
\[
\boxed{16}
\]
