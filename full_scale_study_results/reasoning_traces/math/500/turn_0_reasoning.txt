==================================================

Let's denote the number of insects David found as D, the number of insects Lily found as L, and the number of insects Bodhi found as B. 

From the problem, we know that:

1) L + D + B = 43 (since together they collected 43 insects)

2) L = D + 7 (since Lily found 7 more insects than David)

3) D = B/2 (since David found half of what Bodhi found)

We can substitute equations 2) and 3) into equation 1) to solve for the number of insects each person found.

Substituting equation 2) into equation 1) gives us:

(D + 7) + D + B = 43
2D + B + 7 = 43
2D + B = 43 - 7
2D + B = 36

Substituting equation 3) into the above equation gives us:

2(B/2) + B = 36
B + B = 36
2B = 36
B = 36/2
B = 18

Substituting B = 18 into equation 3) gives us:

D = 18/2
D = 9

Substituting D = 9 into equation 2) gives us:

L = 9 + 7
L = 16

So, Lily found 16 insects.
