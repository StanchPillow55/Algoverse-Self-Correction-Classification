Let's denote the number of insects found by Lily, David, and Bodhi as \( L \), \( D \), and \( B \) respectively.

From the problem, we have the following information:

1. Together they collected 43 insects:
   \[
   L + D + B = 43
   \]

2. Lily found 7 more insects than David:
   \[
   L = D + 7
   \]

3. David found half of what Bodhi found:
   \[
   D = \frac{1}{2} B
   \]

Now, we can substitute the expressions for \( L \) and \( D \) into the first equation.

First, substitute \( D \) from the third equation into the second equation:
\[
L = \frac{1}{2}B + 7
\]

Now, substitute \( D \) into the first equation:
\[
L + D + B = 43
\]
Substituting \( D = \frac{1}{2}B \) gives:
\[
L + \frac{1}{2}B + B = 43
\]

Now, combine the terms involving \( B \):
\[
L + \frac{3}{2}B = 43
\]

Next, substitute \( L = \frac{1}{2}B + 7 \) into this equation:
\[
\left(\frac{1}{2}B + 7\right) + \frac{3}{2}B = 43
\]

Now, combine the \( B \) terms:
\[
\frac{1}{2}B + \frac{3}{2}B + 7 = 43
\]
\[
2B + 7 = 43
\]

Next, isolate \( B \) by subtracting 7 from both sides:
\[
2B = 43 - 7
\]
\[
2B = 36
\]

Now, divide by 2 to find \( B \):
\[
B = 18
\]

Now that we have \( B \), we can find \( D \):
\[
D = \frac{1}{2}B = \frac{1}{2} \times 18 = 9
\]

Finally, we can find \( L \):
\[
L = D + 7 = 9 + 7 = 16
\]

Thus, the number of insects that Lily found is:
\[
\boxed{16}
\]

To verify, we can check the total:
- Lily found 16 insects.
- David found 9 insects.
- Bodhi found 18 insects.

Adding these together:
\[
16 + 9 + 18 = 43
\]
This confirms our solution is correct. Therefore, Lily found \( \boxed{16} \) insects.
