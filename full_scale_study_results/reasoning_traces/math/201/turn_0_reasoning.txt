Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, let's calculate John's annual salary before the raise. Since he makes $2000 a week and there are 52 weeks in a year, his annual salary is:

$2000/week * 52 weeks/year = $104,000/year

Next, let's calculate the amount of his raise. A 5% raise on his annual salary of $104,000 is:

$104,000/year * 5/100 = $5200/year

So, his new annual salary after the raise is:

$104,000/year + $5200/year = $109,200/year

Finally, let's add the one-time monetary reward of $5000 to his new annual salary:

$109,200/year + $5000 = $114,200

So, John made $114,200 that year.
