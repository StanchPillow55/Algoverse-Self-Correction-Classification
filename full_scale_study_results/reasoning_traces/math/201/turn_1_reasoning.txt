Question ID: 201
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, let's calculate John's annual salary before the raise. Since he makes $2000 a week and there are 52 weeks in a year, his annual salary is:

2000 * 52 = $104,000

Next, let's calculate the amount of his raise. A 5% raise on his salary of $104,000 is:

0.05 * 104,000 = $5200

So, his new annual salary after the raise is:

104,000 + 5200 = $109,200

Finally, we need to add the one-time monetary reward of $5000 to his annual salary:

109,200 + 5000 = $114,200

So, John made $114,200 that year.
