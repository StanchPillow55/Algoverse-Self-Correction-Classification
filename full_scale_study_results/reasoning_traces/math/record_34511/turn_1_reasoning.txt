==================================================

To solve this problem, I will need to analyze the given passage and extract the relevant information to answer the query.

Given information:
- England's bowling performance was "complete" in the match.
- The conditions were ideal for bowling.
- England's bowlers, especially Chris Woakes and Chris Jordan, performed well, taking 3 wickets each.
- Stuart Broad and Jimmy Anderson also took 2 wickets each.

To answer the query, I need to determine who the @placeholder refers to in the given context.

Based on the information provided, the @placeholder is likely referring to the Indian batsmen, as the query specifically mentions their mental state.

Therefore, the complete answer to the query would be:
