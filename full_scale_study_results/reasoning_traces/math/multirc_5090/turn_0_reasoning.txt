==================================================

To solve this problem, I will carefully read the given paragraph and extract the relevant information to determine which group plotted the assassination of Hosni Mubarak.

From the paragraph, we can find the following information:
1. The attempted assassination of Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak in June 1995 appears to have been a tipping point.
2. The would-be killers, who came from the Egyptian Islamic Group, had been sheltered in Sudan and helped by Bin Laden.

Therefore, the group that plotted the assassination of Hosni Mubarak was the Egyptian Islamic Group.

The reasoning is as follows:
1. The paragraph states that the attempted assassination of Hosni Mubarak in 1995 was a tipping point.
2. It then explicitly states that the would-be killers came from the Egyptian Islamic Group.
3. The paragraph also mentions that these individuals had been sheltered in Sudan and helped by Bin Laden.

Based on the information provided in the paragraph, the final answer is:
The Egyptian Islamic Group plotted the assassination of Hosni Mubarak.
