Dataset Type: math
==================================================

Mike was a pen pal with 5 people, but he stopped being pen pals with 2 of them. So, he is now a pen pal with 5 - 2 = <<5-2=3>>3 people.

Each of these 3 people sends Mike 2 letters a week, so Mike receives 3 * 2 = <<3*2=6>>6 letters a week.

Each of these letters is 5 pages long, so Mike receives 6 * 5 = <<6*5=30>>30 pages of letters a week.

Mike responds in kind, so he writes 30 pages of letters a week.

He can write a page every 6 minutes, so he spends 30 * 6 = <<30*6=180>>180 minutes writing letters a week.

There are 60 minutes in an hour, so Mike spends 180 / 60 = <<180/60=3>>3 hours writing letters a week.

So, Mike spends 3 hours writing letters a week.
