Question ID: 817
Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

Paul already has a total of 8 chocolate cupcakes and 40 toffee cupcakes. 

To find out how many cupcakes he already has, we add these two amounts together:

8 (chocolate cupcakes) + 40 (toffee cupcakes) = 48 cupcakes

Paul needs a total of 63 cupcakes for the party. To find out how many more he needs to buy, we subtract the number of cupcakes he already has from the total number he needs:

63 (total cupcakes needed) - 48 (cupcakes already has) = 15 cupcakes

So, Paul needs to buy 15 more cupcakes for the party.
