Question ID: 1017
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we first need to determine how many pictures Olivia put into each album. Since she uploaded 72 pictures and put the same number of pictures into 8 albums, we can find the number of pictures per album by dividing the total number of pictures by the number of albums.

So, 72 pictures ÷ 8 albums = 9 pictures per album.

Next, we need to find out how many selfies and portraits Olivia had. Since 3 of the albums were selfies only and 2 of the albums were portraits, we can find the number of selfies by multiplying the number of selfie albums by the number of pictures per album, and similarly for portraits.

So, 3 selfie albums × 9 pictures per album = 27 selfies.

And, 2 portrait albums × 9 pictures per album = 18 portraits.

Therefore, Olivia had 27 selfies and 18 portraits.
