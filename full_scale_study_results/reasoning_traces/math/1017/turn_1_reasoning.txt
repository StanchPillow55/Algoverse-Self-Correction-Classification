Question ID: 1017
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to find out how many pictures Olivia put into each album. Since she uploaded 72 pictures and put the same number of pictures into 8 albums, we divide 72 by 8. 

72 ÷ 8 = 9

So, Olivia put 9 pictures into each album. 

Next, we need to find out how many selfies and portraits she had. Since 3 of the albums were selfies only and 2 of the albums were portraits, we multiply the number of pictures in each album by the number of albums for each type of picture. 

For selfies: 3 albums × 9 pictures/album = 27 pictures
For portraits: 2 albums × 9 pictures/album = 18 pictures

So, Olivia had 27 selfies and 18 portraits. 

In conclusion, Olivia had a total of 27 selfies and 18 portraits.
