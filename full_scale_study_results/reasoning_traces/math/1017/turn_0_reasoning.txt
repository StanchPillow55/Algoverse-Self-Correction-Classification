Question ID: 1017
Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we first need to determine how many pictures Olivia put into each album. Since she uploaded 72 pictures and put the same number into each of 8 albums, we divide 72 by 8. 

72 รท 8 = 9

So, Olivia put 9 pictures into each album. 

Next, we need to find out how many pictures are in the albums that are only selfies and the albums that are only portraits. 

Since there are 3 albums of selfies and each album has 9 pictures, we multiply 3 by 9 to find the total number of selfie pictures.

3 * 9 = 27

So, Olivia has 27 selfies.

Since there are 2 albums of portraits and each album has 9 pictures, we multiply 2 by 9 to find the total number of portrait pictures.

2 * 9 = 18

So, Olivia has 18 portraits.

In conclusion, Olivia has 27 selfies and 18 portraits.
