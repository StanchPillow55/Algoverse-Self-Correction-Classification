==================================================

Let's break this problem down step by step.

Griffin starts with 24 fries. 

Kyle takes 5 fries from Griffin, so Griffin now has 24 - 5 = 19 fries.

Billy takes twice as many fries as Kyle, so Billy takes 2 * 5 = 10 fries. After Billy takes his fries, Griffin has 19 - 10 = 9 fries.

Colby takes 3 less fries than Kyle, so Colby takes 5 - 3 = 2 fries. After Colby takes his fries, Griffin has 9 - 2 = 7 fries.

At the end of all this, Griffin has 27 fries. This means that Ginger must have given Griffin 27 - 7 = 20 fries.

So, Ginger gave Griffin 20 fries.
