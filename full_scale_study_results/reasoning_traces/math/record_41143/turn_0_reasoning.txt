==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to understand the implications of the statement "people must lack health insurance for a year before being counted as 'uninsured' by the Census Bureau."

Given information:
- The Census Bureau reported that 45.7 million Americans were uninsured in 2007, down from 47 million in 2006.
- The statement suggests that the actual number of uninsured people could be higher than the reported figure, as the Census Bureau only counts people as "uninsured" if they have been without health insurance for at least a year.

Reasoning:
1. The Census Bureau's definition of "uninsured" means that people who lost their health insurance during the year 2007 would not be counted in the 45.7 million figure, as they would not have been uninsured for a full year.
2. Similarly, people who gained health insurance during the year 2007 would also not be counted in the 45.7 million figure, as they would not have been uninsured for a full year.
3. Therefore, the actual number of people who were uninsured at any point during the year 2007
