==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to understand the implications of the statement that "people must lack health insurance for a year before being counted as 'uninsured' by the Census Bureau."

Given information:
- The Census Bureau reported that 45.7 million Americans were uninsured in 2007, down from 47 million in 2006.
- The passage states that "people must lack health insurance for a year before being counted as 'uninsured' by the Census Bureau."

Reasoning:
1. The Census Bureau's definition of "uninsured" means that someone who lost their health insurance during the year would not be counted as uninsured until the following year.
2. This means that the actual number of people who were uninsured at some point during 2007 could be higher than the reported 45.7 million.
3. Some individuals may have lost their health insurance during 2007 and were not counted as uninsured until 2008.

Final answer:
The actual number of Americans who were uninsured at some point during 2007 could be higher than the reported 45.7 million, as the Census Bureau's
