Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to understand the implications of the statement "people must lack health insurance for a year before being counted as 'uninsured' by the Census Bureau."

Given information:
- The Census Bureau reported that 45.7 million Americans were uninsured in 2007, down from 47 million in 2006.
- The statement suggests that the actual number of uninsured people could be higher than the reported figure, as the Census Bureau only counts people as "uninsured" if they have been without health insurance for at least a year.

The statement suggests that there may be people who were uninsured for less than a year, and therefore were not counted in the Census Bureau's reported figures. These people would not be included in the 45.7 million uninsured figure for 2007.

Step 2: Estimate the potential additional uninsured people.
Without more specific data, it's difficult to provide an exact estimate of the additional uninsured people. However, we can make a reasonable assumption based on the information provided.

Let's assume that the number of people who were
