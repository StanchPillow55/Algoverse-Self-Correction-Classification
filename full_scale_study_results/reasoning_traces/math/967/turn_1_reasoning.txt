Question ID: 967
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, let's determine the age of each family member.

Nani is 8 years old.

His brother is twice his age, so his brother is 2 * 8 = 16 years old.

Nani's sister is 25% younger than him. To find out how much younger she is, we calculate 25% of Nani's age, which is 0.25 * 8 = 2 years. Therefore, Nani's sister is 8 - 2 = 6 years old.

Now, to find the total age of all three family members, we add up their ages:

8 (Nani's age) + 16 (brother's age) + 6 (sister's age) = 30 years.

So, the total age of all three family members is 30 years.
