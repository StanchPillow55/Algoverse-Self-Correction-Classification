Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, let's find out the age of Nani's brother. Since Nani's brother is twice his age, we multiply Nani's age by 2. 

8 years * 2 = 16 years

So, Nani's brother is 16 years old.

Next, let's find out the age of Nani's sister. Since Nani's sister is 25% younger than him, we need to find out what 25% of Nani's age is and then subtract that from Nani's age.

25% of 8 years = 0.25 * 8 years = 2 years

So, Nani's sister is 8 years - 2 years = 6 years old.

Finally, to find the total age of all three family members, we add up their ages.

8 years (Nani's age) + 16 years (brother's age) + 6 years (sister's age) = 30 years

So, the total age of all three family members is 30 years.
