==================================================

Let's start by calculating how many toys the first four workers produce during their 10-hour shift.

The first two workers produce 6 toys an hour each, so in a 10-hour shift, they produce 6 toys/hour * 10 hours = 60 toys each. Since there are two of them, they produce a total of 60 toys * 2 = 120 toys.

The next two workers produce 4 toys an hour each, so in a 10-hour shift, they produce 4 toys/hour * 10 hours = 40 toys each. Since there are two of them, they produce a total of 40 toys * 2 = 80 toys.

So, the first four workers produce a total of 120 toys + 80 toys = 200 toys during their 10-hour shift.

The manufacturer still needs another 20 toys to be able to ship the order, so the total number of toys produced by all five workers during their 10-hour shift is 400 toys - 20 toys = 380 toys.

Since the first four workers produced 200 toys, the fifth worker must have produced 380 toys - 200 toys = 180 toys during their 10-hour shift.

Therefore, the fifth worker produces 180 toys / 10 hours = 18 toys per hour.

So, the fifth worker produces 18 toys per hour.
