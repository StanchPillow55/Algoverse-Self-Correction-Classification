Dataset Type: math
==================================================

Let's start by figuring out how many cherries Richard has. If Robert has 10 more cherries than Richard, and Robert has 30 cherries, then Richard must have 30 - 10 = 20 cherries.

Now, let's figure out how many cherries Jerry has. If Richard, Jerry, and Robert together have 60 cherries, and Richard has 20 cherries and Robert has 30 cherries, then Jerry must have 60 - 20 - 30 = 10 cherries.

Finally, to find out how many more cherries Robert has than Jerry, we subtract the number of cherries Jerry has from the number of cherries Robert has. That gives us 30 - 10 = 20 cherries.

So, Robert has 20 more cherries than Jerry.
