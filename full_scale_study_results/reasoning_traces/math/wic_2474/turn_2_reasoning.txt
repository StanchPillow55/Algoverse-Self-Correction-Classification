==================================================

To determine if the word 'mine' is used with the same meaning in both sentences, we need to analyze the context in which it is used.

Sentence 1: "This diamond comes from a mine in South Africa."
In this sentence, the word 'mine' is used to refer to a place where diamonds are extracted from the earth, which is a type of underground or surface excavation.

Sentence 2: "Most coal and ore comes from open-pit mines nowadays."
In this sentence, the word 'mine' is also used to refer to a place where coal and ore are extracted, but in this case, it is specifically an open-pit mine, which is a type of surface mining operation.

Based on the context, the word 'mine' is used to describe a place where valuable minerals or resources are extracted from the earth, but the specific type of mining operation (underground or surface) is different in the two sentences.

Therefore, the word 'mine' is not used with the same exact meaning in both sentences, as it refers to different types of mining operations.

Final answer: No, the word 'mine' is not used with the same meaning in both sentences.
