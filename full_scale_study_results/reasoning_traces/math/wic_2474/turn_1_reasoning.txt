To determine if the word 'mine' is used with the same meaning in both sentences, we need to analyze the context in which it is used.

Sentence 1: "This diamond comes from a mine in South Africa."
In this sentence, the word 'mine' is used to refer to a place where diamonds are extracted from the earth, which is a type of underground or surface excavation.

Sentence 2: "Most coal and ore comes from open-pit mines nowadays."
In this sentence, the word 'mine' is also used to refer to a place where coal and ore are extracted from the earth, but specifically an open-pit mine, which is a type of surface excavation.

Based on the context, the word 'mine' is used with the same meaning in both sentences, referring to a place where valuable materials are extracted from the earth, either through underground or surface excavation.

Therefore, the answer is:
Yes, the word 'mine' is used with the same meaning in both sentences.
