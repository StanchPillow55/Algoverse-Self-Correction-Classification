Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to calculate the total cost of the bolts. 

To do this, we multiply the number of bolts by the cost of each bolt. 

16 bolts * $0.03/bolt = $0.48

Next, we subtract the total cost of the bolts from the amount of money David has. 

$12.48 - $0.48 = $12.00

So, David has $12.00 left after paying for the bolts.
