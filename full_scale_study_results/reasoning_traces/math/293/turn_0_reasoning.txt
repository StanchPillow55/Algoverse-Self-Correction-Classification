Question ID: 293
Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, let's determine how many points each player has after the third round. 

Mike has 21 points. 

Jim has 3 points less than Mike, so he has 21 - 3 = 18 points. 

Tony has 2 times more points than Mike, so he has 21 * 2 = 42 points. 

Now, let's determine how many extra points each player gets after the fourth round. 

Mike has over 20 points, so he gets an extra point, bringing his total to 21 + 1 = 22 points. 

Jim does not have over 20 points, so he does not get an extra point. His total remains at 18 points. 

Tony has over 20 points, so he gets an extra point, bringing his total to 42 + 1 = 43 points. 

Finally, let's add up all the points to find the total. 

The total number of points is 22 (Mike) + 18 (Jim) + 43 (Tony) = 83 points. 

So, after the extra points had been distributed, all three players have a total of 83 points.
