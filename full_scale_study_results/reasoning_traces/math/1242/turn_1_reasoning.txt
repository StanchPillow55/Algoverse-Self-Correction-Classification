Question ID: 1242
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine how many hats of each color Skyler has, specifically focusing on finding the number of white hats.

1. **Determine the number of red hats:**
   - Skyler has a total of 100 hats.
   - Half of these hats are red.
   - Therefore, the number of red hats is:
     \[
     \frac{1}{2} \times 100 = 50
     \]

2. **Calculate the remaining hats after accounting for the red hats:**
   - Total hats = 100
   - Red hats = 50
   - Remaining hats = Total hats - Red hats
   - Remaining hats = \(100 - 50 = 50\)

3. **Determine the number of blue hats:**
   - 3/5 of the remaining hats are blue.
   - Therefore, the number of blue hats is:
     \[
     \frac{3}{5} \times 50 = 30
     \]

4. **Calculate the number of white hats:**
   - After accounting for the red and blue hats, the rest are white.
   - Remaining hats after red = 50
   - Blue hats = 30
   - White hats = Remaining hats after red - Blue hats
   - White hats = \(50 - 30 = 20\)

Thus, the number of white hats Skyler has is 20.

**Final Answer: Skyler has 20 white hats.**
