Question ID: 1242
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine how many hats of each color Skyler has, specifically focusing on the white hats. Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Total Number of Hats:**
   Skyler has a total of 100 hats.

2. **Number of Red Hats:**
   We are told that half of the hats are red. Therefore, the number of red hats is:
   \[
   \text{Number of red hats} = \frac{1}{2} \times 100 = 50
   \]

3. **Remaining Hats After Red Hats:**
   After accounting for the red hats, we need to find out how many hats are left. Since there are 50 red hats:
   \[
   \text{Remaining hats} = 100 - 50 = 50
   \]

4. **Number of Blue Hats:**
   We are told that 3/5 of the remaining hats are blue. Therefore, the number of blue hats is:
   \[
   \text{Number of blue hats} = \frac{3}{5} \times 50 = 30
   \]

5. **Number of White Hats:**
   Finally, we need to find the number of white hats. The white hats are the remaining hats after accounting for both the red and blue hats. We already know there are 50 remaining hats after the red ones, and 30 of these are blue. Therefore, the number of white hats is:
   \[
   \text{Number of white hats} = 50 - 30 = 20
   \]

Thus, Skyler has 20 white hats.

**Final Answer:**
Skyler has 20 white hats.
