Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, let's find out how many red hats Skyler has. Since half of the hats are red, we multiply the total number of hats by 1/2:

100 hats * 1/2 = 50 red hats

Next, we need to find out how many hats are left after removing the red ones. We subtract the number of red hats from the total number of hats:

100 hats - 50 red hats = 50 hats

Now, we need to find out how many of these remaining hats are blue. Since 3/5 of the remaining hats are blue, we multiply the number of remaining hats by 3/5:

50 hats * 3/5 = 30 blue hats

Finally, we need to find out how many hats are left after removing the blue ones. We subtract the number of blue hats from the number of remaining hats:

50 hats - 30 blue hats = 20 white hats

So, Skyler has 20 white hats.
