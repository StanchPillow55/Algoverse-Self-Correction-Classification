==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to compare the treatment of inmates at the United Courts Council's makeshift jail in Aleppo, Syria, with the treatment of inmates at another makeshift rebel jail visited by CNN in northern Syria last August.

Given information:
- The United Courts Council operates in areas controlled by rebels in Aleppo, Syria.

4. Any other relevant factors that may indicate the level of care and respect for the inmates' rights
