Question ID: record_67152
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to compare the treatment of inmates at the United Courts Council's makeshift jail cells in Aleppo, Syria, with the treatment of inmates at another makeshift rebel jail that CNN visited in northern Syria last August.

Given information:
- The United Courts Council operates in areas controlled by rebels in Aleppo, Syria.
- It is a self-appointed council of judges, lawyers, and clerics that protects the weak and maintains order in liberated areas.
- About 100 prisoners are detained in a series of makeshift jail cells operated by the United Courts Council.
- At first glance, the inmates at the United Courts Council's makeshift jail cells appeared to be treated better than at another makeshift rebel jail that CNN visited in northern Syria last August.

To compare the treatment of inmates, we need to consider the following factors:
1. Conditions of the makeshift jail cells
2. Provision of basic necessities (food, water, sanitation, etc.)
3. Treatment of prisoners (physical, mental, and emotional)
4. Any other relevant factors that indicate the level of care and respect for the prisoners' rights

Step 1: Analyze
