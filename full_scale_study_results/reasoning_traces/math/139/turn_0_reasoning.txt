==================================================

Let's denote the number of pink gumballs as P and the number of blue gumballs as B. 

According to the problem, we know that:

P = 4B + 22 

We also know that there are 12 blue gumballs, so we can substitute B = 12 into the equation:

P = 4*12 + 22 
P = 48 + 22 
P = 70 

So, there are 70 pink gumballs in the candy machine.
