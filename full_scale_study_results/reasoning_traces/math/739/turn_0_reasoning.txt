Question ID: 739
Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to find out the cost of a half-gallon jar. Since a gallon jar costs $2 more than a half-gallon jar and a gallon jar costs $5, we subtract $2 from $5 to find the cost of a half-gallon jar. 

$5 - $2 = $3

So, a half-gallon jar costs $3.

Next, we need to calculate the total cost for 10 gallon jars and 16 half-gallon jars. 

To find the total cost for the gallon jars, we multiply the cost of one gallon jar by the number of gallon jars. 

$5 * 10 = $50

To find the total cost for the half-gallon jars, we multiply the cost of one half-gallon jar by the number of half-gallon jars.

$3 * 16 = $48

Finally, we add the total cost for the gallon jars and the half-gallon jars to find the total amount of money Cecelia spent.

$50 + $48 = $98

So, Cecelia spent $98 on 10 gallon jars and 16 half-gallon jars.
