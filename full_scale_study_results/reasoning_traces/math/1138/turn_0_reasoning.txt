==================================================

First, let's determine how many days are in three weeks. Since one week has 7 days, three weeks will have 3 * 7 = 21 days.

Next, let's calculate how many cows and chickens are brought to the farm each day for three weeks.

For the cows, Milkie Cows Limited brings 20 cows per day for 21 days, which is 20 * 21 = 420 cows.

For the chickens, Broilers Limited brings 10 chickens per day for 21 days, which is 10 * 21 = 210 chickens.

Now, let's add the number of cows and chickens brought to the farm to the initial number of animals on the farm.

The initial number of cows on the farm is 50, and the number of cows brought to the farm is 420, so the total number of cows on the farm after three weeks is 50 + 420 = 470 cows.

The initial number of chickens on the farm is 20, and the number of chickens brought to the farm is 210, so the total number of chickens on the farm after three weeks is 20 + 210 = 230 chickens.

Finally, let's add the total number of cows and chickens to find the total number of animals on the farm after three weeks.

The total number of animals on the farm after three weeks is 470 cows + 230 chickens = 700 animals.

So, the total number of animals on the farm after three weeks is 700.
