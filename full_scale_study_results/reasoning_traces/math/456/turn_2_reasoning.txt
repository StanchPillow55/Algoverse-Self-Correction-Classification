Question ID: 456
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

Let's start by finding out how many green cards there are. We know there are 60% more green cards than red cards. To find out how many green cards there are, we need to calculate 60% of the number of red cards, which is 15, and then add that to the number of red cards. 

60% of 15 is calculated as follows:
60/100 * 15 = 9

So, there are 9 more green cards than red cards. Adding this to the number of red cards gives us:
15 red cards + 9 more green cards = 24 green cards

Next, we know that the number of yellow cards is equal to the sum of the red and green cards. So, to find out how many yellow cards there are, we add the number of red cards and green cards together:
15 red cards + 24 green cards = 39 yellow cards

Finally, to find out the total number of cards, we add the number of red, green, and yellow cards together:
15 red cards + 24 green cards + 39 yellow cards = 78 cards

So, there are 78 cards of all mentioned colors.
