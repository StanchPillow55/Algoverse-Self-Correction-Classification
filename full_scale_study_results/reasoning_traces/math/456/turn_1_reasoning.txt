Question ID: 456
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we first need to find out how many green cards there are. We know that there are 60% more green cards than red cards. To find this, we can calculate 60% of the number of red cards, which is 15, and then add this to the original number of red cards.

60% of 15 is (60/100) * 15 = 9.

So, there are 15 (red cards) + 9 (60% more) = 24 green cards.

Next, we know that the number of yellow cards is equal to the sum of the red and green cards. So, we add the number of red cards and green cards together to find the number of yellow cards.

15 (red cards) + 24 (green cards) = 39 yellow cards.

Finally, to find the total number of cards, we add the number of red, green, and yellow cards together.

15 (red cards) + 24 (green cards) + 39 (yellow cards) = 78 cards.

So, there are 78 cards of all mentioned colors.
