Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to find out how many green cards there are. We know that there are 60% more green cards than red cards. 

To find 60% of the red cards, we multiply 15 (the number of red cards) by 0.60 (which is the decimal equivalent of 60%). 

15 * 0.60 = 9

So, there are 9 more green cards than red cards. 

To find the total number of green cards, we add the number of red cards to the additional green cards:

15 (red cards) + 9 (additional green cards) = 24 green cards

Next, we find out how many yellow cards there are. We know that the number of yellow cards is equal to the sum of the red and green cards. 

So, we add the number of red cards to the number of green cards:

15 (red cards) + 24 (green cards) = 39 yellow cards

Finally, to find the total number of cards, we add the number of red cards, green cards, and yellow cards together:

15 (red cards) + 24 (green cards) + 39 (yellow cards) = 78 cards

So, there are 78 cards of all mentioned colors.
