==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine how much allowance each girl received from their mother. Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Determine the total cost of the cake and balloons:**
   - The cake costs $11.
   - The balloons are sold at $0.5 for 2 balloons. Since they bought 1 dozen balloons, they bought 12 balloons. 
   - To find the cost of 12 balloons, we calculate:
     \[
     \text{Cost per balloon} = \frac{0.5}{2} = 0.25 \text{ dollars per balloon}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Cost for 12 balloons} = 12 \times 0.25 = 3 \text{ dollars}
     \]
   - Therefore, the total cost for the cake and balloons is:
     \[
     11 + 3 = 14 \text{ dollars}
     \]

2. **Determine the cost of the ice cream:**
   - They bought 2 tubs of ice cream, each costing $7.
   - Therefore, the total cost for the ice cream is:
     \[
     2 \times 7 = 14 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total amount spent:**
   - The total amount spent on the cake, balloons, and ice cream is:
     \[
     14 + 14 = 28 \text{ dollars}
     \]

4. **Determine how much allowance each girl received:**
   - Julia and Nadine combined their allowance to spend a total of $28.
   - Since they were given the same amount of allowance, we can let \( x \) represent the amount each girl received.
   - Therefore, the equation representing the total allowance is:
     \[
     x + x = 28
     \]
     \[
     2x = 28
     \]
   - Solving for \( x \), we divide both sides by 2:
     \[
     x = \frac{28}{2} = 14
     \]

Thus, Julia and Nadine's mother gave each one of them $14.

**Final Answer:**
Julia and Nadine's mother gave each one of them $14.
