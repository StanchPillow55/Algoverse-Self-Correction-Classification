==================================================

First, let's calculate the total cost of the balloons. Since a dozen is 12 and the balloons are sold for $0.5 for 2 balloons, we can calculate the total cost by multiplying the cost of 2 balloons by 6 (since 12 balloons is 6 sets of 2 balloons). 

So, the total cost of the balloons is $0.5 * 6 = $3.

Next, let's calculate the total cost of the ice cream. Since each tub of ice cream costs $7 and they bought 2 tubs, the total cost is $7 * 2 = $14.

Now, let's add up the cost of the cake, the balloons, and the ice cream to find out how much Julia and Nadine spent in total. 

So, the total cost is $11 (for the cake) + $3 (for the balloons) + $14 (for the ice cream) = $28.

Since Julia and Nadine combined their allowances to pay for these items, and they were given the same amount of allowance, we can find out how much each of them was given by dividing the total cost by 2.

So, each girl was given $28 / 2 = $14.

Therefore, Julia and Nadine's mother gave each one of them $14.
