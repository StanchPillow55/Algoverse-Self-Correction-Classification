Question ID: 1167
Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to find out how much money Sophia gave to Jack. Sophia had $100 and she gave 1/5 of it to Jack. 

To find 1/5 of $100, we multiply $100 by 1/5:

$100 * 1/5 = $20

So, Sophia gave $20 to Jack.

Next, we add the amount of money that Sophia gave to Jack to the amount of money that Jack originally had. Jack originally had $100, and Sophia gave him $20. 

$100 + $20 = $120

So, Jack now has $120. 

Final Answer: Jack now has $120.
