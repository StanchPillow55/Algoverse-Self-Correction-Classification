==================================================

Let's denote the number of votes against the regulation as x. According to the problem, the number of votes in favor of the regulation is twice as many, so it's 2x.

The total number of people on the council is the sum of those who voted for and against the regulation, so we can write the equation:

x + 2x = 33

This simplifies to:

3x = 33

To find the value of x, we divide both sides of the equation by 3:

x = 33 / 3

x = 11

So, there were 11 votes against the regulation. But we need to find the number of votes in favor of the regulation, which is 2x:

2x = 2 * 11 = 22

So, there were 22 votes in favor of the new regulation.
