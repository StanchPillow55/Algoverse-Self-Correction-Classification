Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of votes in favor of the new regulation given the conditions of the vote.

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( x \) be the number of votes in favor of the new regulation.
   - Let \( y \) be the number of votes against the new regulation.

2. **Set Up Equations:**
   - According to the problem, the number of votes in favor is twice the number of votes against. This gives us the equation:
     \[
     x = 2y
     \]
   - The total number of council members is 33, which means the total number of votes (in favor and against) is 33. This gives us the equation:
     \[
     x + y = 33
     \]

3. **Substitute and Solve:**
   - Substitute the expression for \( x \) from the first equation into the second equation:
     \[
     2y + y = 33
     \]
   - Simplify and solve for \( y \):
     \[
     3y = 33
     \]
     \[
     y = \frac{33}{3} = 11
     \]

4. **Find \( x \):**
   - Substitute the value of \( y \) back into the equation \( x = 2y \):
     \[
     x = 2 \times 11 = 22
     \]

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The number of votes in favor of the new regulation is \( x = 22 \).

Therefore, the final answer is that there were 22 votes in favor of the new regulation.
