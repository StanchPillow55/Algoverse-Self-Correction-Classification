Question ID: record_88678
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, I will break it down step-by-step:

1. The passage states that West Ham scored twice in the opening seven minutes of the game. The first goal was scored by Winston Reid after less than 90 seconds, and the second goal was scored by Diafra Sakho within seven minutes.

2. The passage also mentions that Simon Mignolet, the Liverpool goalkeeper, failed to impress and was poor in this match.

3. The question asks about the first goal scored by Winston Reid, where Mignolet "looks on as Winston Reid slams the opener in from point-blank range."

4. Based on the information provided in the passage, we can infer that the first goal scored by Winston Reid was a close-range shot that Mignolet was unable to save.

Therefore, the final answer is:
The Liverpool goalkeeper, Simon Mignolet, was unable to save the close-range shot from Winston Reid, which resulted in the first goal for West Ham.
