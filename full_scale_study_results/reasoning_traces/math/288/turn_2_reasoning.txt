Question ID: 288
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to determine the total weight of the 80 flagstones. We do this by multiplying the weight of one flagstone (75 pounds) by the total number of flagstones (80). 

75 pounds/flagstone * 80 flagstones = 6000 pounds

So, the total weight of the 80 flagstones is 6000 pounds.

Next, we need to determine how many trucks are needed to transport this weight. We know that each truck can carry 2000 pounds. So, we divide the total weight of the flagstones by the weight capacity of one truck.

6000 pounds รท 2000 pounds/truck = 3 trucks

However, since trucks cannot be divided, if the result is not a whole number, we would need to round up to the next whole number because even a fraction of a truck means we would need a whole other truck. In this case, the result is a whole number.

So, the landscaping company will need 3 trucks to transport 80 flagstones in one trip.
