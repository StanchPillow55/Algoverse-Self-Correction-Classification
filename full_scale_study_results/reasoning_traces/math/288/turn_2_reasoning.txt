Question ID: 288
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. We know that each flagstone weighs 75 pounds.
2. The delivery trucks can carry a total weight of 2000 pounds.
3. The customer needs to transport 80 flagstones.

To find the number of trucks needed, we need to calculate the total weight of the 80 flagstones.

Total weight of 80 flagstones:
* 80 flagstones x 75 pounds per flagstone = 6000 pounds

Since each truck can carry a maximum of 2000 pounds, we need to divide the total weight by the truck capacity to find the number of trucks needed.

Number of trucks needed:
* 6000 pounds / 2000 pounds per truck = 3 trucks

Therefore, the landscaping company will need 3 trucks to transport 80 flagstones in one trip.
