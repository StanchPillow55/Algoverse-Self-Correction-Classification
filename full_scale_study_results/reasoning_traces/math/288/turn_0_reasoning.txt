Question ID: 288
Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to find out the total weight of the 80 flagstones. We do this by multiplying the weight of one flagstone (75 pounds) by the total number of flagstones (80). 

75 pounds/flagstone * 80 flagstones = 6000 pounds

So, the total weight of the 80 flagstones is 6000 pounds. 

Next, we need to figure out how many trucks are needed to carry this weight. Each truck can carry 2000 pounds, so we divide the total weight of the flagstones by the weight capacity of one truck.

6000 pounds รท 2000 pounds/truck = 3 trucks

Therefore, it would take 3 trucks to transport 80 flagstones in one trip.
