Question ID: 288
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to find out the total weight of the 80 flagstones. We do this by multiplying the weight of one flagstone by the total number of flagstones. 

So, 75 pounds/flagstone * 80 flagstones = 6000 pounds.

This is the total weight that needs to be transported.

Next, we need to find out how many trucks are needed to transport this weight. We do this by dividing the total weight by the weight that one truck can carry.

So, 6000 pounds รท 2000 pounds/truck = 3 trucks.

However, since trucks cannot be divided, and the result is not a whole number, we need to round up to the next whole number. This means that 4 trucks are needed to transport the 80 flagstones in one trip.

So, the final answer is 4 trucks.
