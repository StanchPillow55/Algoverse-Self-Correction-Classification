==================================================

First, we need to calculate how much Jen spends on fish food per day. Since each fish needs $1 worth of food a day and she has 3 fish, she spends 3 * $1 = $3 per day.

The month of May has 31 days. So, to find out how much she spends on fish food in May, we need to multiply the daily cost by the number of days in May.

So, $3 * 31 = $93.

Therefore, Jen spends $93 on fish food in the month of May.
