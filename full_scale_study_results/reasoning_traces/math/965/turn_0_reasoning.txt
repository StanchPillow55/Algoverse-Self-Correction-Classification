==================================================

The total distance the bird travels can be calculated by adding up the distance it travels in each leg of its journey. 

The distance traveled in each leg can be calculated by multiplying the time spent traveling by the speed of travel, since distance = speed * time.

In the first leg of the journey, the bird flies south for 10 hours at a speed of 30 miles per hour. So, the distance traveled in this leg is 10 hours * 30 miles/hour = 300 miles.

In the second leg of the journey, the bird flies north for 2 hours at a speed of 18 miles per hour. So, the distance traveled in this leg is 2 hours * 18 miles/hour = 36 miles. However, since the bird is flying north, this distance is subtracted from the total distance traveled in the southerly direction.

In the third leg of the journey, the bird flies south for 5 hours at a speed of 22 miles per hour. So, the distance traveled in this leg is 5 hours * 22 miles/hour = 110 miles.

Adding up the distances from each leg, the total distance between the bird's northern and southern homes is 300 miles - 36 miles + 110 miles = 374 miles.

So, the distance between the bird's northern and southern homes is 374 miles.
