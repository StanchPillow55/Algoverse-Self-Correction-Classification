==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to set up equations based on the information given and then solve for the number of books each person has.

Let's define the variables:
- Let \( S \) represent the number of books Sofie has.
- Let \( A \) represent the number of books Anne has.
- Let \( F \) represent the number of books Fawn has.

We are given the following information:
1. Together, Sofie, Anne, and Fawn have 85 books: 
   \[
   S + A + F = 85
   \]

2. Sofie has 25 more books than Anne:
   \[
   S = A + 25
   \]

3. Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn:
   \[
   A = F - 12
   \]

Now, we will substitute the expressions for \( S \) and \( A \) from the second and third equations into the first equation.

Substitute \( S = A + 25 \) into the first equation:
\[
(A + 25) + A + F = 85
\]

Simplify this equation:
\[
2A + F + 25 = 85
\]

Subtract 25 from both sides:
\[
2A + F = 60
\]

Now substitute \( A = F - 12 \) into the equation \( 2A + F = 60 \):
\[
2(F - 12) + F = 60
\]

Distribute the 2:
\[
2F - 24 + F = 60
\]

Combine like terms:
\[
3F - 24 = 60
\]

Add 24 to both sides:
\[
3F = 84
\]

Divide both sides by 3:
\[
F = 28
\]

Thus, Fawn has 28 books.

To verify, let's find the number of books Sofie and Anne have:
- Since \( A = F - 12 \), then \( A = 28 - 12 = 16 \).
- Since \( S = A + 25 \), then \( S = 16 + 25 = 41 \).

Check the total:
\[
S + A + F = 41 + 16 + 28 = 85
\]

The calculations are consistent with the given total of 85 books. Therefore, the final answer is that Fawn has \(\boxed{28}\) books.
