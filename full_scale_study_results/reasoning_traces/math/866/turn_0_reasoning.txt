==================================================

Let's denote the number of books each person has as follows:

Sofie = S
Anne = A
Fawn = F

We know from the problem that:

S + A + F = 85 (equation 1)

We also know that Sofie has 25 more books than Anne, so:

S = A + 25 (equation 2)

And Anne has 12 fewer books than Fawn, so:

A = F - 12 (equation 3)

We can substitute equation 2 and equation 3 into equation 1 to solve for F:

(A + 25) + (F - 12) + F = 85
A + F + 13 + F = 85
2F + A + 13 = 85
2F + (F - 12) + 13 = 85
3F + 1 = 85
3F = 84
F = 84 / 3
F = 28

So, Fawn has 28 books.
