Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

In the first 20 minutes, Mike scores 4 points.

In the second 20 minutes, he scores 25% more points than he did in the first 20 minutes. To find out how many points he scored in the second 20 minutes, we need to calculate 25% of 4 points and then add that to the original 4 points.

25% of 4 points is calculated as follows:
25/100 * 4 = 1 point

So, in the second 20 minutes, Mike scores 4 points (from the first 20 minutes) + 1 point (25% more) = 5 points.

To find the total points Mike scored, we add the points he scored in the first 20 minutes to the points he scored in the second 20 minutes:
4 points (from the first 20 minutes) + 5 points (from the second 20 minutes) = 9 points.

So, Mike scored a total of 9 points.
