==================================================

First, let's find out how much one dwarf can mine with an iron pickaxe. Since it's twice as much as with his bare hands, it would be 12 pounds * 2 = 24 pounds per day.

Next, let's find out how much one dwarf can mine with a steel pickaxe. Since it's 50% more than with an iron pickaxe, it would be 24 pounds * 1.5 = 36 pounds per day.

Now, let's calculate how much 40 dwarves can mine in one day with steel pickaxes. It would be 36 pounds/dwarf/day * 40 dwarves = 1440 pounds per day.

Finally, let's calculate how much 40 dwarves can mine in a month with 30 days. It would be 1440 pounds/day * 30 days = 43,200 pounds.

So, 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes can mine 43,200 pounds of ore in a month with 30 days.
