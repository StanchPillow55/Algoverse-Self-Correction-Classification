Question ID: 1026
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, let's determine how much one dwarf can mine with an iron pickaxe. Since he can mine twice as much with an iron pickaxe as with his bare hands, he can mine 12 pounds/day * 2 = 24 pounds/day with an iron pickaxe.

Next, let's determine how much one dwarf can mine with a steel pickaxe. Since he can mine 50% more with a steel pickaxe than with an iron pickaxe, he can mine 24 pounds/day * 1.5 = 36 pounds/day with a steel pickaxe.

Now, let's determine how much 40 dwarves can mine in one day with steel pickaxes. Since each dwarf can mine 36 pounds/day, 40 dwarves can mine 36 pounds/day * 40 = 1440 pounds/day.

Finally, let's determine how much 40 dwarves can mine in a month with 30 days. Since they can mine 1440 pounds/day, they can mine 1440 pounds/day * 30 days = 43,200 pounds in a month.

So, 40 dwarves with steel pickaxes can mine 43,200 pounds of ore in a month with 30 days.
