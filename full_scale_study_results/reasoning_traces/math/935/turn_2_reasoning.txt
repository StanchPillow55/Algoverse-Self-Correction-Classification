Question ID: 935
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To determine how much more money Fern will make from the Widgeteer 3000 compared to the WidgetMaster 9000, we need to calculate the total revenue generated by each machine over the course of a month and then find the difference.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of widgets produced by each machine in a month.**

- **Widgeteer 3000:**
  - Widgets per hour = 60
  - Hours per day = 24
  - Days per month = 30
  - Total widgets in a month = 60 widgets/hour × 24 hours/day × 30 days = 43,200 widgets

- **WidgetMaster 9000:**
  - Widgets per hour = 45
  - Hours per day = 24
  - Days per month = 30
  - Total widgets in a month = 45 widgets/hour × 24 hours/day × 30 days = 32,400 widgets

**Step 2: Calculate the total revenue generated by each machine.**

- **Revenue per widget = $6**

- **Widgeteer 3000:**
  - Total revenue = 43,200 widgets × $6/widget = $259,200

- **WidgetMaster 9000:**
  - Total revenue = 32,400 widgets × $6/widget = $194,400

**Step 3: Calculate the difference in revenue between the two machines.**

- Difference in revenue = Revenue from Widgeteer 3000 - Revenue from WidgetMaster 9000
- Difference = $259,200 - $194,400 = $64,800

**Final Answer:**
Fern will make $64,800 more from the Widgeteer 3000 compared to the WidgetMaster 9000 if it runs 24 hours a day for a month with 30 days.
