==================================================

First, we need to calculate how many widgets each machine can produce in a month. 

For the Widgeteer 3000, it produces 60 widgets per hour. So in a day (24 hours), it will produce 60 widgets/hour * 24 hours/day = 1440 widgets/day. Over a 30-day month, it will produce 1440 widgets/day * 30 days = 43200 widgets.

For the WidgetMaster 9000, it produces 45 widgets per hour. So in a day (24 hours), it will produce 45 widgets/hour * 24 hours/day = 1080 widgets/day. Over a 30-day month, it will produce 1080 widgets/day * 30 days = 32400 widgets.

Next, we need to calculate how much money each machine can make in a month. Each widget sells for $6, so:

The Widgeteer 3000 can make 43200 widgets * $6/widget = $259200.
The WidgetMaster 9000 can make 32400 widgets * $6/widget = $194400.

Finally, to find out how much more money Fern will make from the Widgeteer 3000 vs. the WidgetMaster 9000, we subtract the amount the WidgetMaster 9000 makes from the amount the Widgeteer 3000 makes:

$259200 - $194400 = $64800.

So, Fern will make $64800 more with the Widgeteer 3000 than with the WidgetMaster 9000 if it runs 24 hours a day for a month with 30 days.
