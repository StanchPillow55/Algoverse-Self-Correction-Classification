==================================================

To determine if the word 'fall' is used with the same meaning in both sentences, we need to analyze the context and meaning of the phrase in each sentence.

Sentence 1: "Fall by the wayside."
In this sentence, the phrase "fall by the wayside" means to fail, decline, or become neglected. It suggests that something or someone has been left behind or abandoned.

Sentence 2: "We must stand or fall."
In this sentence, the word 'fall' is used to mean the opposite of 'stand'. It suggests that the outcome will be either success or failure, victory or defeat.

By comparing the meanings of the word 'fall' in the two sentences, we can see that it is not used with the same meaning. In the first sentence, 'fall' means to fail or decline, while in the second sentence, 'fall' means to be defeated or to fail.

Therefore, the word 'fall' is not used with the same meaning in both sentences.

Final answer: No, the word 'fall' is not used with the same meaning in both sentences.
