To determine if the word 'fall' is used with the same meaning in both sentences, we need to analyze the context and the meaning of the phrase in each sentence.

Sentence 1: "Fall by the wayside."
In this sentence, the phrase "fall by the wayside" means to fail or become neglected, to be left behind or abandoned. The word 'fall' is used in the sense of something or someone declining, losing momentum, or being left behind.

Sentence 2: "We must stand or fall."
In this sentence, the phrase "stand or fall" means to succeed or fail, to prevail or be defeated. The word 'fall' is used in the sense of failing, being defeated, or not succeeding.

Comparing the two usages of the word 'fall':
In the first sentence, 'fall' is used to describe something or someone being left behind or abandoned.
In the second sentence, 'fall' is used to describe the act of failing or being defeated.

Therefore, the word 'fall' is not used with the same meaning in both sentences. The meanings are different, even though the word 'fall' is use
