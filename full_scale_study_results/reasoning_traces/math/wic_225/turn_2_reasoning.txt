==================================================

To determine if the word 'fall' is used with the same meaning in both sentences, we need to analyze the context and meaning of the phrase in each sentence.

Sentence 1: "Fall by the wayside."
In this sentence, the phrase "fall by the wayside" means to fail or become neglected, to be left behind or abandoned. The word 'fall' is used in the sense of something or someone declining or failing to continue.

Sentence 2: "We must stand or fall."
In this sentence, the phrase "stand or fall" means to succeed or fail, to triumph or be defeated. The word 'fall' is used in the sense of failing, being defeated, or losing.

Based on the analysis, the word 'fall' is not used with the same meaning in both sentences. In the first sentence, it refers to something or someone being left behind or abandoned, while in the second sentence, it refers to failing or being defeated.

Therefore, the answer is:
No, the word 'fall' is not used with the same meaning in both sentences.
