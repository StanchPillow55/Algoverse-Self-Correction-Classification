Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to find out how many watermelons were ready for harvest after two months. We do this by taking 30% of the total number of watermelons. 

30% of 120 watermelons = 0.30 * 120 = 36 watermelons

So, Ashlyn took home 36 watermelons after two months. 

This means that there were 120 - 36 = 84 watermelons left on the farm.

Two weeks later, 3/4 of these remaining watermelons were ready for harvest. 

3/4 of 84 watermelons = 0.75 * 84 = 63 watermelons

So, Ashlyn harvested 63 more watermelons two weeks later. 

This means that there were 84 - 63 = 21 watermelons left on the farm that were not ready to be harvested after the two weeks.

So, the final answer is 21 watermelons.
