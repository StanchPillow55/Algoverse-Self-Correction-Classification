Question ID: 964
Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to find out how many episodes there are in total. We know that there are half as many episodes as there are minutes per episode. Since each episode is 20 minutes long, this means there are 20/2 = 10 episodes in total.

Next, we need to find out how many minutes John will spend watching the show if he watches every episode. Since each episode is 20 minutes long and there are 10 episodes, this means John will spend 20 * 10 = 200 minutes watching the show.

So, John will spend 200 minutes watching the show if he watches every episode.
