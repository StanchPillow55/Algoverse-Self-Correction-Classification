Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, let's find out the total cost of half a dozen plates sold at $6000 each.

Half a dozen means 6, so if each plate costs $6000, the total cost for half a dozen plates would be 6 * $6000 = $36000.

The problem states that twenty dozen cups cost $1200 less than the total cost of half a dozen plates. So, the total cost of twenty dozen cups would be $36000 - $1200 = $34800.

A dozen is 12, so twenty dozen cups would be 20 * 12 = 240 cups.

To find the cost of each cup, we would divide the total cost of all cups by the total number of cups. So, $34800 / 240 = $145.

Therefore, each cup costs $145.
