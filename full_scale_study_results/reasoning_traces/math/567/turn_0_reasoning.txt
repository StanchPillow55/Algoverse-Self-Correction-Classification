Dataset Type: math
==================================================

Let's break down the problem:

1. For the first tooth, Sharon received $5.00.

2. For the next three teeth, Sharon received $1.00 each. So, for three teeth, she received 3 * $1.00 = $3.00.

3. For the last two teeth, Sharon received half the amount of money per tooth as she had received for each of the previous three teeth. That means she received $1.00 / 2 = $0.50 for each of the last two teeth. So, for two teeth, she received 2 * $0.50 = $1.00.

Now, let's add up all the money Sharon received:

$5.00 (for the first tooth) + $3.00 (for the next three teeth) + $1.00 (for the last two teeth) = $9.00.

So, the tooth fairy left Sharon $9.00 in total.
