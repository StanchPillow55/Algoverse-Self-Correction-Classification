Question ID: 567
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. The tooth fairy left Sharon $5.00 for the first tooth.

2. For the next three teeth, the tooth fairy gave Sharon $1.00 per tooth.
   * 3 teeth x $1.00 per tooth = $3.00

3. For the last 2 teeth, the tooth fairy gave Sharon half the amount per tooth as the previous 3 teeth.
   * Previous 3 teeth: $1.00 per tooth
   * Last 2 teeth: $1.00 / 2 = $0.50 per tooth
   * 2 teeth x $0.50 per tooth = $1.00

4. Adding up the total:
   * First tooth: $5.00
   * Next 3 teeth: $3.00
   * Last 2 teeth: $1.00
   * Total: $5.00 + $3.00 + $1.00 = $9.00

Therefore, the total amount of money the tooth fairy left Sharon is $9.00.
