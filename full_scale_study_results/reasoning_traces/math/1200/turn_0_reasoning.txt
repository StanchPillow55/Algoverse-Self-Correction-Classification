==================================================

Let's denote the number of coffee mugs in the teacher's lounge as x.

According to the problem, "eight more than four times the number of coffee mugs in the teacherâ€™s lounge is 40". This can be translated into the following equation:

4x + 8 = 40

To solve for x, we first subtract 8 from both sides of the equation:

4x + 8 - 8 = 40 - 8
4x = 32

Then, we divide both sides of the equation by 4:

4x / 4 = 32 / 4
x = 8

So, there are 8 coffee mugs in the teacher's lounge.
