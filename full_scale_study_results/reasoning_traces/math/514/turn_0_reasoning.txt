Let's denote the cost of the lot as x. According to the problem, the house costs three times as much as the lot, so we can denote the cost of the house as 3x.

The total cost of the house and the lot is given as $120,000. Therefore, we can set up the equation:

x (cost of the lot) + 3x (cost of the house) = $120,000

Combine like terms:

4x = $120,000

To find the value of x (the cost of the lot), we need to divide both sides of the equation by 4:

x = $120,000 / 4
x = $30,000

So, the lot costs $30,000. 

Since the house costs three times as much as the lot, we can find the cost of the house by multiplying the cost of the lot by 3:

Cost of the house = 3 * cost of the lot
Cost of the house = 3 * $30,000
Cost of the house = $90,000

So, the house costs $90,000.
