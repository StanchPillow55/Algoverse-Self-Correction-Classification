==================================================

Let's denote the cost of the lot as x. According to the problem, the house costs three times as much as the lot, so we can denote the cost of the house as 3x.

The total cost of the house and the lot is given as $120,000. Therefore, we can set up the following equation to represent this relationship:

x (cost of the lot) + 3x (cost of the house) = $120,000

Combining like terms gives us:

4x = $120,000

To solve for x (the cost of the lot), we divide both sides of the equation by 4:

x = $120,000 / 4

x = $30,000

So, the lot costs $30,000. 

Since the house costs three times as much as the lot, we multiply the cost of the lot by 3 to find the cost of the house:

Cost of the house = 3 * cost of the lot

Cost of the house = 3 * $30,000

Cost of the house = $90,000

Therefore, the house cost $90,000.
