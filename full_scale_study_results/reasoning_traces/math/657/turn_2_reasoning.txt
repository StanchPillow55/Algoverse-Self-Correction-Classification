Question ID: 657
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, let's break down the costs that James has to pay:

1. The cost of the plane: $150,000
2. The monthly cost of renting a hanger: $5,000
3. The monthly cost of fuel, which is twice the cost of the hanger rent: 2 * $5,000 = $10,000

Now, let's calculate the total cost for the first year.

The cost of the plane is a one-time cost, so we just take it as it is: $150,000.

The cost of the hanger rent and the fuel are monthly costs, so we need to multiply them by 12 to get the yearly cost.

The yearly cost of the hanger rent is: $5,000 * 12 = $60,000
The yearly cost of the fuel is: $10,000 * 12 = $120,000

Now, we add up all these costs to get the total cost for the first year:

$150,000 (plane) + $60,000 (hanger rent) + $120,000 (fuel) = $330,000

So, it cost James $330,000 to get and maintain the plane for the first year.
