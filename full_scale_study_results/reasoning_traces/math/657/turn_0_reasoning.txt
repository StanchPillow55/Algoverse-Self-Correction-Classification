==================================================

First, let's calculate the monthly costs for James.

He pays $5000 a month to rent a hanger. He also spends twice as much as that on fuel per month. This means he spends $5000 * 2 = $10,000 on fuel per month.

So, his total monthly costs are $5000 (for the hanger) + $10,000 (for the fuel) = $15,000.

Now, let's calculate how much he spends in a year. There are 12 months in a year, so he spends $15,000 * 12 = $180,000 in a year on hanger rent and fuel.

Finally, let's add the cost of the plane to the annual costs. The plane cost him $150,000. So, the total cost to get and maintain the plane for the first year is $150,000 (for the plane) + $180,000 (for the hanger rent and fuel) = $330,000.

So, it cost James $330,000 to get and maintain the plane for the first year.
