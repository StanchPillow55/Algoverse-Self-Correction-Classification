==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of the plane, the hanger rental, and the fuel for one year.

Firstly, the cost of the plane is given as $150,000.

Secondly, the cost of the hanger rental is $5000 per month. Since there are 12 months in a year, the total cost for the hanger rental for one year is $5000 * 12 = $60,000.

Thirdly, the cost of fuel per month is twice the cost of the hanger rental, which is $5000 * 2 = $10,000. Therefore, the total cost for fuel for one year is $10,000 * 12 = $120,000.

Finally, to find the total cost to get and maintain the plane for the first year, we add up the cost of the plane, the hanger rental, and the fuel. This is $150,000 + $60,000 + $120,000 = $330,000.

Therefore, it cost James $330,000 to get and maintain the plane for the first year.
