==================================================

First, let's calculate the total cost of the vaccines. Since each vaccine costs $20 and the dog needs 2 vaccines, the total cost for the vaccines is 2 * $20 = $40.

The problem states that the cost of the heartworm check is 60% of the total bill. If we let H represent the cost of the heartworm check, we can write the equation H = 0.60 * (H + $40) to represent this relationship.

To solve for H, we first distribute the 0.60 on the right side of the equation to get H = 0.60H + $24.

Next, we subtract 0.60H from both sides of the equation to get 0.40H = $24.

Finally, we divide both sides of the equation by 0.40 to find that H = $60.

So, the cost of the heartworm check is $60.

The total cost of the vet visit is the cost of the vaccines plus the cost of the heartworm check, which is $40 + $60 = $100.

John brought $125 with him to the vet. After paying his bill of $100, he leaves with $125 - $100 = $25.

So, John leaves the vet with $25.
