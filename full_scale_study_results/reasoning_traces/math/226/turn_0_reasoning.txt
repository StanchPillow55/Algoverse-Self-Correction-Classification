==================================================

First, let's find out how many Pokemon cards James has in total before he loses any and buys new ones. 

He has 30 fire type, 20 grass type, and 40 water type. 

So, 30 fire type + 20 grass type + 40 water type = 90 cards in total.

Then, James loses 8 water type cards and buys 14 grass type cards. 

So, the new total number of cards is 90 cards - 8 cards + 14 cards = 96 cards.

The new number of water type cards is 40 cards - 8 cards = 32 cards.

We want to find out the percentage chance that a randomly picked card will be a water type. 

To do this, we divide the number of water type cards by the total number of cards and then multiply by 100 to get the percentage.

So, (32 water type cards / 96 total cards) * 100 = 33.33%

Rounding to the nearest integer, the percentage chance that a randomly picked card will be a water type is 33%.
