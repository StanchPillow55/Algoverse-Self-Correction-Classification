Question ID: 226
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, let's calculate the total number of Pokemon cards James has initially. He has 30 fire type, 20 grass type, and 40 water type. So, the total number of cards is 30 + 20 + 40 = 90 cards.

Then, James loses 8 water type cards, so the number of water type cards becomes 40 - 8 = 32 cards.

He also buys 14 more grass type cards, so the total number of cards becomes 90 + 14 = 104 cards.

Now, we want to find the percentage chance that a randomly picked card will be a water type. This is the number of water type cards divided by the total number of cards, times 100%.

So, the percentage chance is (32 / 104) * 100% = 30.77%, which rounds to 31%.

Therefore, the percentage chance that a randomly picked card will be a water type is 31%.
