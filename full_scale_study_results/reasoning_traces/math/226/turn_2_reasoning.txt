Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, let's calculate the total number of Pokemon cards James has initially. He has 30 fire type, 20 grass type, and 40 water type. 

30 fire type + 20 grass type + 40 water type = 90 total cards

Then, James loses 8 water type cards and buys 14 grass type cards. This changes the total number of cards and the number of water type cards.

Total cards after changes = 90 total cards - 8 water type cards + 14 grass type cards = 96 total cards

Water type cards after changes = 40 water type cards - 8 lost cards = 32 water type cards

To find the percentage chance that a randomly picked card will be a water type, we divide the number of water type cards by the total number of cards and multiply by 100%.

Percentage chance = (Number of water type cards / Total number of cards) * 100%

Percentage chance = (32 water type cards / 96 total cards) * 100% = 33.33%

Rounding to the nearest integer, the percentage chance that a randomly picked card will be a water type is 33%.
