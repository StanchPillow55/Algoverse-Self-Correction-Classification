Question ID: 633
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine how long it will take Tom to catch up to Bob, given their respective speeds and the initial distance between them.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - Bob is 75 miles ahead of Tom.
   - Bob is driving at a speed of 55 miles per hour.
   - Tom is driving at a speed of 70 miles per hour.

2. **Determine the Relative Speed:**
   - Since both Bob and Tom are moving in the same direction, the relative speed at which Tom is catching up to Bob is the difference in their speeds.
   - Tom's speed: 70 miles per hour
   - Bob's speed: 55 miles per hour
   - Relative speed = Tom's speed - Bob's speed = 70 mph - 55 mph = 15 mph

3. **Calculate the Time to Catch Up:**
   - Tom needs to close the 75-mile gap between him and Bob.
   - Using the formula: \(\text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}}\)
   - Distance to close = 75 miles
   - Relative speed = 15 mph
   - Time = \(\frac{75 \text{ miles}}{15 \text{ mph}} = 5 \text{ hours}\)

4. **Conclusion:**
   - It will take Tom 5 hours to catch up with Bob.

### Final Answer:
Tom will catch up with Bob in 5 hours.
