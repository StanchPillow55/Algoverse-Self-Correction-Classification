Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine how long it will take Tom to catch up to Bob given their respective speeds and the initial distance between them.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - Bob is 75 miles ahead of Tom.
   - Bob is driving at a speed of 55 miles per hour.
   - Tom is driving at a speed of 70 miles per hour.

2. **Determine the Relative Speed:**
   - Since Tom is trying to catch up to Bob, we need to consider their relative speeds. The relative speed is the difference in their speeds because they are moving in the same direction.
   - Relative speed of Tom with respect to Bob = Tom's speed - Bob's speed = 70 mph - 55 mph = 15 mph.

3. **Calculate the Time to Catch Up:**
   - To find out how long it will take Tom to close the 75-mile gap, we use the formula:
     \[
     \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Relative Speed}}
     \]
   - Here, the distance is 75 miles and the relative speed is 15 mph.
   - Substitute these values into the formula:
     \[
     \text{Time} = \frac{75 \text{ miles}}{15 \text{ mph}} = 5 \text{ hours}
     \]

4. **Conclusion:**
   - It will take Tom 5 hours to catch up to Bob.

Therefore, the final answer is that it will take Tom 5 hours to catch up with Bob.
