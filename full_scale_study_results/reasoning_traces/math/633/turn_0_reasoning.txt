Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to determine the relative speed of Tom and Bob. Since they are moving in the same direction, we subtract the slower speed from the faster speed. 

Tom's speed is 70 mph and Bob's speed is 55 mph. So, Tom is gaining on Bob at a rate of 70 mph - 55 mph = 15 mph.

Next, we need to figure out how long it will take for Tom to make up the 75-mile difference between them. To do this, we divide the total distance by the relative speed.

The distance is 75 miles and the relative speed is 15 mph. So, the time it will take for Tom to catch up to Bob is 75 miles รท 15 mph = 5 hours.

So, it will take Tom 5 hours to catch up with Bob.
