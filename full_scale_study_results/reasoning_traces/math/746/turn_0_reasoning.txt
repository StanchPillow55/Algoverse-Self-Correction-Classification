==================================================

First, let's calculate the cost of the first amusement park for Jake's family. 

The cost for the adults is $26 per adult times 2 adults, which equals $52. 
The cost for the children is $12 per child times 2 children, which equals $24. 

Adding these two amounts together, the total cost for the first amusement park is $52 + $24 = $76.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the second amusement park for Jake's family.

The cost for the adults is $14 per adult times 2 adults, which equals $28. 
The cost for the children is $10 per child times 2 children, which equals $20. 

Adding these two amounts together, the total cost for the second amusement park is $28 + $20 = $48.

To find out how much Jake's family will save by choosing the second amusement park, we subtract the cost of the second amusement park from the cost of the first amusement park. 

So, $76 - $48 = $28.

Therefore, Jake's family will be able to save $28 if they choose the second amusement park over the first.
