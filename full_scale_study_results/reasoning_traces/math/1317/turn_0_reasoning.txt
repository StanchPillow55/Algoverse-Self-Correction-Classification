==================================================

Let's denote the number of chickens as C and the number of cows as K. 

We know from the problem that Farmer Brown has a total of 20 animals, so we can write this as an equation: 

C + K = 20 

We also know that all of the animals together have a total of 70 legs. Chickens have 2 legs and cows have 4. So we can write this as a second equation: 

2C + 4K = 70 

We can simplify the second equation by dividing every term by 2, which gives us:

C + 2K = 35 

Now we have a system of two equations:

C + K = 20 
C + 2K = 35 

We can solve this system by subtracting the first equation from the second, which gives us:

K = 15 

Substituting K = 15 into the first equation gives us:

C + 15 = 20 
C = 20 - 15 
C = 5 

So, Farmer Brown has 5 chickens and 15 cows.
