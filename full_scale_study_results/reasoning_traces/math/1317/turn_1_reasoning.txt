==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine how many of the 20 animals are chickens, given that the total number of legs is 70. We know that chickens have 2 legs each and cows have 4 legs each.

Let's define:
- \( c \) as the number of chickens
- \( w \) as the number of cows

We have two equations based on the information given:

1. The total number of animals is 20:
   \[
   c + w = 20
   \]

2. The total number of legs is 70:
   \[
   2c + 4w = 70
   \]

We can solve these equations simultaneously. First, let's solve the first equation for one of the variables, say \( w \):
\[
w = 20 - c
\]

Now, substitute \( w = 20 - c \) into the second equation:
\[
2c + 4(20 - c) = 70
\]

Distribute the 4:
\[
2c + 80 - 4c = 70
\]

Combine like terms:
\[
-2c + 80 = 70
\]

Subtract 80 from both sides:
\[
-2c = 70 - 80
\]
\[
-2c = -10
\]

Divide both sides by -2:
\[
c = 5
\]

Thus, there are 5 chickens on the farm. To verify, we can find the number of cows:
\[
w = 20 - c = 20 - 5 = 15
\]

Check the total number of legs:
- Chickens: \( 5 \times 2 = 10 \) legs
- Cows: \( 15 \times 4 = 60 \) legs
- Total: \( 10 + 60 = 70 \) legs

The calculations are consistent with the problem statement. Therefore, the number of chickens is \(\boxed{5}\).
