==================================================

First, let's add up the total miles that the first three dogs need to walk. 

1 mile (first dog) + 4 miles (second dog) + 3 miles (third dog) = 8 miles

We know that Bernie has 4 dogs and on average, they need to walk 3 miles per day. So, the total amount of miles that all four dogs need to walk in a day is 4 dogs * 3 miles/dog = 12 miles.

If the first three dogs need to walk 8 miles in total and all four dogs need to walk 12 miles in total, then the last dog must need to walk 12 miles - 8 miles = 4 miles.

So, the last dog needs to walk 4 miles per day.
