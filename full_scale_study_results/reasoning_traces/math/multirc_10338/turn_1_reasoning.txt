To answer the question "Where were the President and Vice President when the aircraft hit the Twin Towers on 9/11?", I will go through the details provided in the paragraph step-by-step:

1. When American 11 struck the World Trade Center at 8:46, no one in the White House or traveling with the President knew that it had been hijacked.
2. The President's motorcade was arriving at the Emma E. Booker Elementary School in Sarasota, Florida, where President Bush was to read to a class and talk about education.
3. White House Chief of Staff Andrew Card told us he was standing with the President outside the classroom when Senior Advisor to the President Karl Rove first informed them that a small, twin-engine plane had crashed into the World Trade Center.
4. At 8:55, before entering the classroom, the President spoke to National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice, who was at the White House.
5. At the White House, Vice President Dick Cheney had just sat down for a meeting when his assistant told him to turn on his television because a plane had struck the North Tower of the World Trade Center.
