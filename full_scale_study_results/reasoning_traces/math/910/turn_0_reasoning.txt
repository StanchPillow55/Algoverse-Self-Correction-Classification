Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to find out the size of Farmer Smith's farm. We know that it's 100 acres more than twice the size of Farmer Brown's farm. 

Farmer Brown's farm is 200 acres, so twice that would be 2 * 200 = 400 acres.

Adding the extra 100 acres, Farmer Smith's farm is 400 + 100 = 500 acres.

Now we know the size of both farms, we can add them together to find the total size. 

Farmer Brown's farm is 200 acres and Farmer Smith's farm is 500 acres, so together they are 200 + 500 = 700 acres.

So, the two farms together have 700 acres.
