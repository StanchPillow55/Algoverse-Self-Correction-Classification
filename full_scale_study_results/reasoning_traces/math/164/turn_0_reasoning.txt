==================================================

If Jackie does her taxes herself, she will lose 3 hours of freelance work. Given that she earns $35 per hour, the total income she will lose is 3 hours * $35/hour = $105.

If she hires an accountant, she will have to pay $90.

The difference between the money she will lose if she does her taxes herself and the cost of hiring an accountant is $105 - $90 = $15.

Therefore, Jackie will have $15 more if she hires an accountant.
