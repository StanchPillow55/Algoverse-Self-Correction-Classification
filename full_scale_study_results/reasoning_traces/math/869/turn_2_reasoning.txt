Question ID: 869
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

The total cost of the 5 phones is calculated by multiplying the cost of each phone by the number of phones. 

So, 5 phones * $700/phone = $3500

The seller gave $4000 to pay for the phones. To find out how much change the seller will give back, subtract the total cost of the phones from the amount given.

So, $4000 - $3500 = $500

Therefore, the seller will give back $500 in change.
