==================================================

To determine whether Joey and Max preferred playing at the lake or in the forest, we need to analyze the information provided in the paragraph.

Given information:
- Joey and Max would often run through fields and go through the small forest behind the house, making a game of hide and seek.
- They never went near the lake because Joey was afraid of water.

Based on the information provided, we can conclude that Joey and Max did not prefer playing at the lake, as they never went near it due to Joey's fear of water.

On the other hand, the paragraph explicitly states that Joey and Max "would often run through fields and go through the small forest behind the house, making a game of hide and seek." This indicates that they preferred playing in the forest over the lake.

Therefore, the correct answer is that Joey and Max preferred playing in the forest, not at the lake.

Final answer: Joey and Max preferred playing in the forest, not at the lake.
