==================================================

Let's break down the problem:

First, Ram buys 25 pens. 

Then, when these pens run out of ink, he can use the ink from 5 pens to make 1 new pen. 

So, we need to find out how many new pens he can make from the 25 pens he bought. 

To do this, we divide the total number of pens he bought by the number of pens needed to make a new pen. 

So, 25 pens รท 5 pens/new pen = 5 new pens.

But, we must remember that these 5 new pens will also run out of ink and can be used to make more pens. 

So, we repeat the process: 5 pens รท 5 pens/new pen = 1 new pen.

Therefore, the total number of pens Ram gets to have is the original 25 pens he bought plus the 5 new pens he made from the first batch plus the 1 new pen he made from the second batch.

So, 25 pens + 5 pens + 1 pen = 31 pens.

Therefore, Ram gets to have a total of 31 pens.
