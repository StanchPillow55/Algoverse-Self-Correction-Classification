Dataset Type: math
==================================================

Ram initially buys 25 pens. 

Once he uses these pens and they run out of ink, he can take the ink from 5 pens and combine it to make 1 full pen. 

So, the 25 pens that he initially bought can be used to create 25/5 = 5 new pens.

Now, he has 5 pens. Once these run out of ink, he can again combine the ink from these 5 pens to make 1 new pen. 

So, in total, Ram gets to have his initial 25 pens, plus the 5 new pens he made from the ink of the initial pens, plus the 1 new pen he made from the ink of the 5 new pens. 

So, in total, Ram gets to have 25 + 5 + 1 = 31 pens. 

Therefore, Ram gets to have a total of 31 pens.
