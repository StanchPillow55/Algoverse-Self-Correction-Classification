Question ID: 236
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to determine how many new pens Ram can make from the 25 pens he initially bought. 

Since he can make one full pen from the ink of five empty pens, we divide the total number of pens he bought by 5. 

25 pens รท 5 = 5 pens

So, Ram can make 5 new pens from the ink of the 25 pens he initially bought.

Next, we add the number of new pens to the number of pens he initially bought to find the total number of pens he gets to have.

25 pens + 5 pens = 30 pens

So, Ram gets to have a total of 30 pens.
