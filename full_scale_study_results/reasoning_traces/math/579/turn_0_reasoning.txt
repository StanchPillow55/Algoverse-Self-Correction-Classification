Question ID: 579
Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

The boy has 5 cards. His brother has 3 fewer cards than he does. 

To find out how many cards his brother has, we subtract 3 from the number of cards the boy has. 

So, 5 (the number of cards the boy has) - 3 (the number of cards his brother has less than him) = 2 cards. 

Therefore, the brother has 2 cards.

To find out how many cards they have together, we add the number of cards the boy has to the number of cards his brother has.

So, 5 (the number of cards the boy has) + 2 (the number of cards his brother has) = 7 cards.

Therefore, together, the boy and his brother have 7 cards.
