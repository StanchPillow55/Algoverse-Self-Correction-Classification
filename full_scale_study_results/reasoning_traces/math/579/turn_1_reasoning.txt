Question ID: 579
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

The boy has 5 cards. His brother has 3 fewer cards than he does, so his brother has 5 - 3 = 2 cards.

To find out how many cards they have together, we add the number of cards each of them has. So, 5 (boy's cards) + 2 (brother's cards) = 7 cards.

Therefore, together they have 7 cards.
