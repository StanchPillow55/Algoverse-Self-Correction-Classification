==================================================

First, we need to calculate how much Ted spent on books. Since each book costs $16 and he bought 3 books, we multiply 16 by 3. 

16 * 3 = $48

Next, we calculate how much Ted spent on pencils. Each pencil costs $6 and he bought 3 pencils, so we multiply 6 by 3.

6 * 3 = $18

Now, we add the total amount spent on books and pencils to find out how much Ted spent in total.

48 + 18 = $66

So, Ted spent $66 in total.
