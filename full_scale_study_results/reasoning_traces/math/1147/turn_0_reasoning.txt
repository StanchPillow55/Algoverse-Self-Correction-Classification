Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, let's calculate how many days it will take Lauren to draw each type of picture scene.

For the large-sized picture scenes, she can draw 5 per day and she needs to draw 45 in total. So, we divide the total number of large-sized picture scenes by the number she can draw per day:

45 large-sized picture scenes รท 5 per day = 9 days

Next, for the medium-sized picture scenes, she can draw 6 per day and she needs to draw 36 in total. So, we divide the total number of medium-sized picture scenes by the number she can draw per day:

36 medium-sized picture scenes รท 6 per day = 6 days

Finally, for the small-sized picture scenes, she can draw 7 per day and she needs to draw 49 in total. So, we divide the total number of small-sized picture scenes by the number she can draw per day:

49 small-sized picture scenes รท 7 per day = 7 days

Now, we add up the number of days it takes for each type of picture scene to find the total number of days it will take Lauren to complete the project:

9 days (large-sized) + 6 days (medium-sized) + 7 days (small-sized) = 22 days

So, it will take Lauren 22 days to create all of the picture scenes for the big project.
