Question ID: 21
Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to find out how old Raymond is now. Since Raymond was born 6 years before Samantha, and Samantha is now 31, Raymond is 31 + 6 = 37 years old.

Next, we need to find out how many years ago Raymond's son was born. Since Raymond had a son at the age of 23, and he is now 37, Raymond's son was born 37 - 23 = 14 years ago.

Therefore, Raymond's son was born 14 years ago.
