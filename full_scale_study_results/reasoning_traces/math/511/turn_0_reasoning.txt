Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

Gerald works at a daycare that pays him $30 every day. If he worked for an entire week (7 days), we can calculate his total earnings by multiplying his daily wage by the number of days he worked.

$30/day * 7 days = $210

So, Gerald earned $210 for the week.

He then spent a total of $100. To find out how much he has left, we subtract the amount he spent from the amount he earned.

$210 - $100 = $110

Therefore, Gerald has $110 left.
