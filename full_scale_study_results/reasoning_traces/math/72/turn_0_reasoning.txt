To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of money Tommy raises from selling brownies and cheesecakes. 

First, we calculate the total amount of money Tommy raises from selling brownies. Since each brownie is sold for $3 and Tommy sells 43 brownies, the total amount of money Tommy raises from selling brownies is $3 * 43 = $129.

Next, we calculate the total amount of money Tommy raises from selling cheesecakes. Since each slice of cheesecake is sold for $4 and Tommy sells 23 slices of cheesecake, the total amount of money Tommy raises from selling cheesecakes is $4 * 23 = $92.

Finally, we add the total amount of money Tommy raises from selling brownies and cheesecakes to find the total amount of money Tommy raises. So, $129 + $92 = $221.

Therefore, Tommy raises a total of $221 from selling brownies and cheesecakes.
