Question ID: record_42092
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, I need to determine whether the given statement is true or false based on the information provided in the passage.

The passage states that in the Saturday Night Live sketch, "when he heard how things were going in the country these days however, Mr. King was none too happy with his legacy." This suggests that the ghost of Martin Luther King Jr. was not pleased with the current state of affairs in the country, implying that the protests and progress he had fought for had not been fully realized.

However, the given statement says that the young boy "tells King that protests are continuing in this country, just like the ones he led decades before." This statement is not supported by the information provided in the passage.

The passage does not mention the young boy telling the ghost of Martin Luther King Jr. that protests are continuing in the country. It only states that when the ghost of King heard "how things were going in the country these days," he was unhappy with his legacy, suggesting that the current situation was not what he had hoped for.

Therefore, the given statement is false, as it is not supported by the information provided in the passage.

Final answer: The statement is false.
