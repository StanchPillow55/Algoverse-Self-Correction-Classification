Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, I need to determine whether the given statement is true or false based on the information provided in the passage.

Given information:
- Saturday Night Live addressed the lack of diversity among this year's crop of Oscar nominees in their cold open this week.
- In the sketch, a young boy, played by Pete Davidson, got some help writing a paper on Martin Luther King Jr. from the ghost Martin Luther King Jr., played by Keenan Thompson.
- When he heard how things were going in the country these days, Mr. King was none too happy with his legacy.

The query states that the young boy, however, tells King that protests are continuing in this country, just like the ones he led decades before.

To determine if this statement is true or false, I need to analyze the information provided in the passage.

The passage does not mention the young boy telling King that protests are continuing in the country, just like the ones he led decades before. The passage only states that when King heard how things were going in the country these days, he was none too happy with his legacy.

Therefore, the statement in the query is false, as the passage does not indicate that the young boy told King that protests
