Question ID: 78
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

Okay, let's solve this problem step-by-step.

Given information:
- Flowers can be bought in packages of 3 for $2.50 or in packages of 2 for $1.
- Vincent needs to buy 18 flowers.

Step 1: Determine the better price per flower.
Price per flower in packages of 3: $2.50 / 3 = $0.83 per flower
Price per flower in packages of 2: $1 / 2 = $0.50 per flower

The better price per flower is $0.50 when buying in packages of 2.

Step 2: Calculate the cost of buying 18 flowers at the better price.
Number of packages of 2 needed: 18 / 2 = 9 packages
Cost of 9 packages of 2 flowers: 9 Ã— $1 = $9

Step 3: Calculate the cost of buying 18 flowers at the worse price.
Number of packages of 3 needed: 18 / 3 = 6 packages
Cost of 6 packages
