Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to determine the price per flower for each package.

For the package of 3 flowers at $2.50, the price per flower is $2.50 / 3 = $0.8333.

For the package of 2 flowers at $1, the price per flower is $1 / 2 = $0.50.

Clearly, the package of 2 flowers is cheaper per flower.

Now, let's calculate how much Vincent would spend if he bought 18 flowers at each price.

If he bought 18 flowers at $0.8333 each, he would spend 18 * $0.8333 = $15.

If he bought 18 flowers at $0.50 each, he would spend 18 * $0.50 = $9.

Therefore, by buying 18 flowers at the cheaper price, Vincent would save $15 - $9 = $6. 

So, Vincent saves $6 by buying 18 flowers at the better price.
