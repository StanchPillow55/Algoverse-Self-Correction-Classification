==================================================

To determine if the word "give" is used with the same meaning in both sentences, we need to analyze the context and the meaning of the word in each sentence.

Sentence 1: "Give a course."
In this sentence, the word "give" is used in the sense of "to provide" or "to offer" a course. The meaning is that someone is instructing or teaching a course.

Sentence 2: "The draft gave me a cold."
In this sentence, the word "give" is used in the sense of "to cause" or "to result in" a cold. The meaning is that the draft (e.g., a sudden change in temperature or air movement) led to the person getting a cold.

Based on the analysis, the word "give" is not used with the same meaning in both sentences. In the first sentence, it means "to provide," while in the second sentence, it means "to cause."

Therefore, the answer is:
No, the word "give" is not used with the same meaning in both sentences.
