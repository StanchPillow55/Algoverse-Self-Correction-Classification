==================================================

To determine if the word "give" is used with the same meaning in both sentences, we need to analyze the context and the meaning of the word in each sentence.

Sentence 1: "Give a course."
In this sentence, the word "give" is used in the sense of "to provide" or "to offer" a course. The meaning is that someone is offering or providing a course.

Sentence 2: "The draft gave me a cold."
In this sentence, the word "give" is used in the sense of "to cause" or "to result in" a cold. The meaning is that the draft (e.g., a draft of air or a draft of a document) caused the person to get a cold.

Analyzing the two sentences, we can see that the word "give" is not used with the same meaning in both sentences. In the first sentence, it means "to provide," while in the second sentence, it means "to cause."

Therefore, the answer is:
No, the word "give" is not used with the same meaning in both sentences.
