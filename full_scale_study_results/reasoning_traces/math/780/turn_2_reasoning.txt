Question ID: 780
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

Let's denote the number of enemies Emma jumped on as E, the number of berries she collected as B, and the time she took to finish the level as T. 

Then Ava jumped on E + 8 enemies, collected B + 3 berries, and took T + 4 seconds to finish the level. 

The score for each player is calculated as follows: 

Score = 10 * (number of enemies jumped on) + 5 * (number of berries collected) + 30 * (time left)

Assuming that the total time for the level is T_total, the time left for each player is T_total - T for Emma and T_total - (T + 4) for Ava. 

So, the scores for Emma and Ava are:

Score_Emma = 10E + 5B + 30(T_total - T)
Score_Ava = 10(E + 8) + 5(B + 3) + 30(T_total - (T + 4))

We want to find the difference between their scores, which is Score_Ava - Score_Emma:

Score_Ava - Score_Emma = [10(E + 8) + 5(B + 3) + 30(T_total - (T + 4))] - [10E + 5B + 30(T_total - T)]

Simplifying this expression, we get:

Score_Ava - Score_Emma = 10E + 80 + 5B + 15 + 30T_total - 30T - 120 - 10E - 5B - 30T_total + 30T

After canceling out the same terms from both sides, we get:

Score_Ava - Score_Emma = 80 + 15 - 120 = -25

So, Ava scored 25 points less than Emma.
