Question ID: 780
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

Let's denote the number of enemies Emma jumped on as E, the number of berries she collected as B, and the time she took to finish the level as T. 

Then, Ava jumped on E+8 enemies, collected B+3 berries, and took T+4 seconds to finish the level.

The score for each girl is calculated as follows:

Emma's score = 10E + 5B + 30(T)
Ava's score = 10(E+8) + 5(B+3) + 30(T-4)

We want to find the difference between Ava's and Emma's scores, which is Ava's score - Emma's score. 

So, we subtract Emma's score from Ava's score:

Difference = Ava's score - Emma's score
= (10(E+8) + 5(B+3) + 30(T-4)) - (10E + 5B + 30T)
= 10E + 80 + 5B + 15 + 30T - 120 - 10E - 5B - 30T
= 80 + 15 - 120
= -25

So, Ava scored 25 points less than Emma.
