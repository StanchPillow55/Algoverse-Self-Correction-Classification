==================================================

Let's denote the number of enemies Emma jumped on as E, the number of berries she collected as B, and the time she took to finish the level as T. 

Then, Ava jumped on E+8 enemies, collected B+3 berries, and took T+4 seconds to finish the level. 

Emma's score is calculated as follows: 
E * 10 (points for enemies) + B * 5 (points for berries) + T * 30 (points for time). 

Ava's score is calculated as follows: 
(E+8) * 10 (points for enemies) + (B+3) * 5 (points for berries) + (T-4) * 30 (points for time). 

We want to find the difference between Ava's and Emma's scores, which is Ava's score minus Emma's score. 

Difference = Ava's score - Emma's score 
= [(E+8)*10 + (B+3)*5 + (T-4)*30] - [E*10 + B*5 + T*30] 
= [E*10 + 80 + B*5 + 15 + T*30 - 120] - [E*10 + B*5 + T*30] 
= 80 + 15 - 120 
= -25 

So, despite jumping on more enemies and collecting more berries, Ava scored 25 points less than Emma because she took 4 seconds longer to finish the level.
