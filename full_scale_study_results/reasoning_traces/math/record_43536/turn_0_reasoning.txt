==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given information and provide a response to the query.

Given information:
- James Clapper, the Director of National Intelligence, says it would be impossible to prevent intelligence leaks like those perpetrated by former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden and former Army intelligence analyst Bradley Manning.
- Clapper explains that the size of the intelligence community makes it virtually impossible to guarantee that leaks like those of Snowden and Manning won't happen again.
- Clapper has a hard time grasping why Snowden, as a fellow intelligence officer charged with keeping the country safe, would do what he did.

Reasoning:
1. Clapper acknowledges that it is virtually impossible to prevent intelligence leaks like those of Snowden and Manning due to the size and complexity of the intelligence community.
2. Clapper has put new safeguards in place to prevent leakers like Snowden, but he admits that there is no guarantee that they will work.
3. Clapper is puzzled by Snowden's actions, as Snowden was also an intelligence officer charged with keeping the country safe. Clapper seems to have difficulty understanding
