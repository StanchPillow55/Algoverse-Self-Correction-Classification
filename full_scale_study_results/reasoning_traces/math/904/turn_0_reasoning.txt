Question ID: 904
Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

Deepa has seen each of the 9 Fast and the Furious movies three times, so she has seen a total of 9 * 3 = 27 movies.

She has spent $216 in total to see these 27 movies. To find the average price she paid per ticket, we need to divide the total amount she spent by the total number of movies she saw.

So, $216 / 27 = $8.

Therefore, the average price Deepa paid per ticket is $8.
