Question ID: 764
Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to calculate how much each person spent on their respective vegetables.

Leila bought 3 cucumbers at $2 each. To find out how much she spent, we multiply the number of cucumbers by the cost of each cucumber:

3 cucumbers * $2/cucumber = $6

Jack bought 5 tomatoes at $1 each. To find out how much he spent, we multiply the number of tomatoes by the cost of each tomato:

5 tomatoes * $1/tomato = $5

Chase bought 1 head of lettuce at $3 each. To find out how much he spent, we multiply the number of lettuce heads by the cost of each lettuce head:

1 lettuce * $3/lettuce = $3

Now, to find out how much they all spent together, we add up the amounts each person spent:

Leila's total + Jack's total + Chase's total = Total spent

$6 + $5 + $3 = $14

So, together, Leila, Jack, and Chase spent $14 to make a salad for the potluck.
