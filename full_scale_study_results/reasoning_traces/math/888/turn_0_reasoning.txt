Question ID: 888
Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to find out how many cookies Lani had left after she ate 5. We do this by subtracting the number of cookies she ate from the total number she baked. 

55 (total cookies baked) - 5 (cookies eaten) = 50 cookies

Next, we need to find out how many cookies Lani put in each jar. She divided the remaining cookies equally among 5 jars. We do this by dividing the number of remaining cookies by the number of jars.

50 (remaining cookies) รท 5 (number of jars) = 10 cookies per jar

So, Lani put 10 cookies in each jar. 

Final Answer: Each jar contains 10 cookies.
