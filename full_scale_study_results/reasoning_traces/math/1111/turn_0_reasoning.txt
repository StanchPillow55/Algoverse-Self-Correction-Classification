To solve this problem, we need to find the total amount of money the store will receive from selling all the balls. We do this by multiplying the number of each color of ball by the cost of that color of ball, then adding all these amounts together.

First, let's calculate the total amount of money the store will receive from selling the red balls. There are 3 red balls and each costs $9, so the total amount from the red balls is 3 * $9 = $27.

Next, let's calculate the total amount of money the store will receive from selling the blue balls. There are 11 blue balls and each costs $5, so the total amount from the blue balls is 11 * $5 = $55.

Finally, let's calculate the total amount of money the store will receive from selling the green balls. There are 25 green balls and each costs $3, so the total amount from the green balls is 25 * $3 = $75.

Now, we add all these amounts together to find the total amount the store will receive from selling all the balls. So, $27 (from the red balls) + $55 (from the blue balls) + $75 (from the green balls) = $157.

Therefore, the store will have received $157 after all the balls are sold.
