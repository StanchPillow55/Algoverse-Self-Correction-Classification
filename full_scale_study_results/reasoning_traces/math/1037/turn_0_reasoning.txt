==================================================

First, we need to calculate the total cost of the Parmesan cheese. Since the price of Parmesan cheese is $11 per pound and Amor buys 2 pounds, the total cost of the Parmesan cheese is 11 * 2 = $<<11*2=22>>22.

Next, we calculate the total cost of the Mozzarella cheese. Since the price of Mozzarella cheese is $6 per pound and Amor buys 3 pounds, the total cost of the Mozzarella cheese is 6 * 3 = $<<6*3=18>>18.

Now, we add the total cost of the Parmesan cheese and the total cost of the Mozzarella cheese to find the total cost of the cheese. So, 22 + 18 = $<<22+18=40>>40.

Finally, we subtract the total cost of the cheese from the amount of cash Amor starts with to find out how much money she will have left to buy meat. So, 50 - 40 = $<<50-40=10>>10.

Therefore, Amor will have $10 left to buy meat.
