Question ID: 1037
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to calculate the total cost of the Parmesan cheese. Since the price of Parmesan cheese is $11 per pound and Amor buys 2 pounds, we multiply the price per pound by the number of pounds:

$11/pound * 2 pounds = $22

Next, we calculate the total cost of the Mozzarella cheese. Since the price of Mozzarella cheese is $6 per pound and Amor buys 3 pounds, we multiply the price per pound by the number of pounds:

$6/pound * 3 pounds = $18

Now, we add the cost of the Parmesan cheese and the Mozzarella cheese to find the total cost of the cheese:

$22 + $18 = $40

Finally, we subtract the total cost of the cheese from the amount of money Amor started with to find out how much money she has left to buy meat:

$50 - $40 = $10

So, Amor will have $10 left to buy meat.
