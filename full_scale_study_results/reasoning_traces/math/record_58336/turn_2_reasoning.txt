Question ID: record_58336
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

I do not see a specific math problem in the given passage. The passage is an article discussing Vincent Kompany's comments about Daniel Sturridge being "one of the best strikers in the world" and the upcoming match between Manchester City and Liverpool. There are no numerical values or calculations provided that would require a step-by-step math problem-solving approach. The passage is providing commentary and analysis about the players and the upcoming match, rather than presenting a math problem to solve. Without a clear math problem statement, I cannot provide a step-by-step solution. I can only summarize the key points made in the passage.
