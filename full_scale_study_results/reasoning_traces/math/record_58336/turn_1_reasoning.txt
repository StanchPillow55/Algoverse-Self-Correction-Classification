==================================================

I do not see a specific math problem in the given passage. The passage is an article discussing Vincent Kompany's comments about Daniel Sturridge being one of the best strikers in the world, and Kompany's expectations for the upcoming match between Manchester City and Liverpool. There are no numerical values or calculations provided that would require a step-by-step math problem-solving approach. The passage is focused on providing commentary and analysis of the players and the upcoming match, rather than presenting a math problem to solve. Without a clear math problem statement, I cannot provide a step-by-step solution. I can, however, summarize the key points made in the passage.

The key points are:

1. Manchester City captain Vincent Kompany has praised former teammate Daniel Sturridge, calling him "one of the best strikers in the world".

2. Kompany and Sturridge will face each other when Manchester City host Liverpool in the Premier League on Monday.

3. Kompany believes Liverpool have not been greatly weakened by the departure of Luis Suarez to Barcelona.

4. Kompany expects a tough test from Liverpool and says Manchester City must be at their "very best" to win the match
