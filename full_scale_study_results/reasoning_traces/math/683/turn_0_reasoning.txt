Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to convert the time it takes to mow the lawn in "turtle" mode from hours to minutes. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, it takes Chris 60 minutes to mow the lawn in "turtle" mode.

Next, we need to calculate how long it takes Chris to mow half the lawn in each mode. 

In "turtle" mode, since it takes 60 minutes to mow the entire lawn, it would take half that time, or 30 minutes, to mow half the lawn.

In "rabbit" mode, since it takes 40 minutes to mow the entire lawn, it would take half that time, or 20 minutes, to mow half the lawn.

Finally, we add the time it takes to mow half the lawn in "turtle" mode to the time it takes to mow half the lawn in "rabbit" mode. 

30 minutes (turtle mode) + 20 minutes (rabbit mode) = 50 minutes

So, it took Chris 50 minutes to mow the lawn by mowing half in "turtle" mode and half in "rabbit" mode.
