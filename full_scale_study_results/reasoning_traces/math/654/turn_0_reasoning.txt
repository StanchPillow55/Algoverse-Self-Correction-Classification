Question ID: 654
Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to determine how many deviled egg halves Lori needs to make for all her guests. Since each guest will eat 3 deviled egg halves, and she is inviting 16 guests, she will need to make 3 * 16 = 48 deviled egg halves.

Since 1 whole egg makes 2 deviled egg halves, Lori will need 48 / 2 = 24 whole eggs to make enough deviled egg halves for all her guests.

Since a dozen contains 12 items, Lori will need 24 / 12 = 2 dozens of eggs.

So, Lori will need 2 dozens of eggs.
