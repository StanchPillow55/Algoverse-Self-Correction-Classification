Question ID: 654
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine how many whole eggs Lori will need to make enough deviled egg halves for her 16 guests, and then convert that number into dozens of eggs.

**Step 1: Determine the total number of deviled egg halves needed.**

Each guest is expected to eat 3 deviled egg halves. Lori is inviting 16 guests, so we calculate the total number of deviled egg halves required:

\[
16 \text{ guests} \times 3 \text{ deviled egg halves per guest} = 48 \text{ deviled egg halves}
\]

**Step 2: Calculate the number of whole eggs needed.**

Since 1 whole egg makes 2 deviled egg halves, we need to find out how many whole eggs are required to make 48 deviled egg halves. We do this by dividing the total number of deviled egg halves by 2:

\[
\frac{48 \text{ deviled egg halves}}{2 \text{ halves per egg}} = 24 \text{ whole eggs}
\]

**Step 3: Convert the number of whole eggs into dozens.**

A dozen is equal to 12 eggs. To find out how many dozens Lori needs, we divide the total number of eggs by 12:

\[
\frac{24 \text{ eggs}}{12 \text{ eggs per dozen}} = 2 \text{ dozens}
\]

Therefore, Lori will need 2 dozens of eggs to make enough deviled egg halves for her 16 guests.

**Final Answer:**
Lori needs 2 dozens of eggs.
