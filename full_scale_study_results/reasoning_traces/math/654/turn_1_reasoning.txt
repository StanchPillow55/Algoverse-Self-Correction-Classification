==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine how many whole eggs Lori will need to make enough deviled egg halves for her guests. Then, we will convert that number into dozens of eggs.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Determine the Total Number of Deviled Egg Halves Needed:**
   - Lori is inviting 16 guests.
   - Each guest is expected to eat 3 deviled egg halves.
   - Therefore, the total number of deviled egg halves needed is:
     \[
     16 \text{ guests} \times 3 \text{ halves per guest} = 48 \text{ deviled egg halves}
     \]

2. **Calculate the Number of Whole Eggs Needed:**
   - We know that 1 whole egg makes 2 deviled egg halves.
   - To find out how many whole eggs are needed to make 48 deviled egg halves, we divide the total number of halves by 2:
     \[
     \frac{48 \text{ deviled egg halves}}{2 \text{ halves per egg}} = 24 \text{ whole eggs}
     \]

3. **Convert the Number of Eggs to Dozens:**
   - A dozen is equal to 12 eggs.
   - To find out how many dozens of eggs Lori needs, divide the total number of eggs by 12:
     \[
     \frac{24 \text{ eggs}}{12 \text{ eggs per dozen}} = 2 \text{ dozens of eggs}
     \]

### Final Answer:
Lori will need 2 dozens of eggs to make enough deviled egg halves for her 16 guests.
