Let's denote the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal as X.

According to the problem, at the first bus stop, 5 more people got in. So, the total number of people on the bus after the first stop is X + 5.

At the second bus stop, 7 people got down and 8 more got in. So, the total number of people on the bus after the second stop is (X + 5) - 7 + 8.

We know that there were a total of 20 people heading to the third stop. So, we can set up the following equation:

(X + 5) - 7 + 8 = 20

Solving this equation will give us the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal.

First, simplify the equation:

X + 5 - 7 + 8 = 20
X + 6 = 20

Then, subtract 6 from both sides of the equation to solve for X:

X = 20 - 6
X = 14

So, 14 people got on the bus at the terminal.
