==================================================

To solve this problem, I will need to determine the appropriate placeholder to insert into the given sentence based on the information provided in the passage.

Given information:
- The passage mentions that a Kenyan mother named her twin boys after the winning and losing presidential candidates in the 2012 U.S. election.
- The winning candidate was Barack Obama, and the losing candidate was Mitt Romney.

Therefore, the appropriate placeholder to insert into the sentence would be "Barack Obama", as he was the winning presidential candidate in the 2012 U.S. election.

The complete sentence with the placeholder filled in would be:

"Offering: A Kenyan resident holds a bowl of local porridge against a poster of Barack Obama."
