Question ID: record_44146
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, I will need to extract the relevant information from the passage and then use it to determine the appropriate placeholder for the image.

Given information:
- A Kenyan mother, Millicent Owuor, gave birth to twin boys on Wednesday.
- She named the twins Barack Obama and Mitt Romney, after the winning and losing U.S. presidential candidates.
- The passage mentions that Kenyan residents celebrated as Obama dominated key states.

Based on this information, the appropriate placeholder for the image would be @Barack_Obama, as he was the winning presidential candidate.

The passage does not provide any information about a Kenyan resident holding a bowl of local porridge against a poster, so I cannot provide any additional details or reasoning for that part of the query.

Final answer: @Barack_Obama
