Question ID: record_44146
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, I will need to extract the relevant information from the passage and then use it to determine the appropriate placeholder for the image.

Given information:
- The passage is about a Kenyan mother, Millicent Owuor, who gave birth to twin boys and named them Barack Obama and Mitt Romney.
- The passage mentions that Owuor named her twins after the winning and losing presidential candidates to remember the election.
- The passage also mentions that Kenyan residents celebrated as Obama dominated key states including Ohio and New Hampshire.

Based on this information, the appropriate placeholder for the image would be @barack_obama, as he was the winning presidential candidate in the 2012 U.S. election.

Therefore, the complete answer would be:

Offering: A Kenyan resident holds a bowl of local porridge against a poster of @barack_obama.
