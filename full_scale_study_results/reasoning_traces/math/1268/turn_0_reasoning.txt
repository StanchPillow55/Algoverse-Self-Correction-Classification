==================================================

The problem states that there are 4 blue blocks and twice as many yellow blocks. This means there are 2*4 = 8 yellow blocks.

So, the total number of blue and yellow blocks is 4 (blue) + 8 (yellow) = 12 blocks.

The problem also states that there are 32 blocks in total. If we subtract the number of blue and yellow blocks from the total, we can find out how many red blocks there are.

So, the number of red blocks is 32 (total) - 12 (blue and yellow) = 20 red blocks.

Therefore, there are 20 red blocks in the tower.
