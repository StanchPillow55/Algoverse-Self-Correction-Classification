Dataset Type: math
==================================================

Ryan plants 2 flowers a day. So, over 15 days, he would have planted 2 * 15 = <<2*15=30>>30 flowers.

However, we know that 5 of these flowers did not grow. So, we subtract these from the total number of flowers planted.

So, 30 - 5 = <<30-5=25>>25 flowers.

Therefore, Ryan has 25 flowers in his garden after 15 days.
