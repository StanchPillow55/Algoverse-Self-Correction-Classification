Question ID: 113
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we first need to calculate the total number of flowers Ryan planted over the 15 days. Since he plants 2 flowers a day, we multiply the number of days by the number of flowers he plants each day:

15 days * 2 flowers/day = 30 flowers

This is the total number of flowers Ryan planted. However, the problem states that 5 of these flowers did not grow. To find the number of flowers that did grow, we subtract the number of flowers that did not grow from the total number of flowers planted:

30 flowers - 5 flowers = 25 flowers

So, Ryan has 25 flowers in his garden after 15 days, if 5 did not grow.
