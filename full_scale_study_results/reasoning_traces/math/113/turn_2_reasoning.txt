Question ID: 113
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

Ryan plants 2 flowers a day. So, over 15 days, he would have planted 2 flowers/day * 15 days = 30 flowers.

However, we know that 5 of these flowers did not grow. So, we subtract these from the total number of flowers planted.

So, the total number of flowers that Ryan has in his garden is 30 flowers - 5 flowers = 25 flowers.

Therefore, Ryan has 25 flowers in his garden.
