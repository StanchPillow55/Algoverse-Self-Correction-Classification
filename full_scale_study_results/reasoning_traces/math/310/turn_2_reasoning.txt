Question ID: 310
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine how much Theo can spend on gifts after accounting for his other expenses and savings. Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Determine the cost of the business suits:**
   - Theo buys 6 business suits at $100 each.
   - Total cost for suits = \(6 \times 100 = 600\) dollars.

2. **Determine the cost of the suitcases:**
   - Theo buys 3 suitcases at $50 each.
   - Total cost for suitcases = \(3 \times 50 = 150\) dollars.

3. **Determine the cost of the flight ticket:**
   - The cost of the flight ticket is $700 more than 5 times the cost of a business suit.
   - Cost of one business suit = $100.
   - 5 times the cost of a business suit = \(5 \times 100 = 500\) dollars.
   - Cost of the flight ticket = \(500 + 700 = 1200\) dollars.

4. **Calculate the total expenses excluding gifts:**
   - Total expenses = Cost of suits + Cost of suitcases + Cost of flight ticket
   - Total expenses = \(600 + 150 + 1200 = 1950\) dollars.

5. **Determine the amount Theo wishes to save:**
   - Theo wishes to save $2000 for the trip.

6. **Calculate the total amount Theo can spend:**
   - Theo has $6000 initially.
   - Amount available for spending = Total initial amount - Savings
   - Amount available for spending = \(6000 - 2000 = 4000\) dollars.

7. **Determine the amount available for gifts:**
   - Amount available for gifts = Amount available for spending - Total expenses
   - Amount available for gifts = \(4000 - 1950 = 2050\) dollars.

Therefore, Theo has $2050 to spend on buying gifts for his business partners in South Africa.

**Final Answer:** Theo can spend $2050 on gifts.
