Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine how much Theo has left to spend on gifts after accounting for his other expenses and the amount he wishes to save. Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Calculate the cost of the business suits:**
   - Theo buys 6 business suits at $100 each.
   - Total cost for suits = \(6 \times 100 = 600\) dollars.

2. **Calculate the cost of the suitcases:**
   - Theo buys 3 suitcases at $50 each.
   - Total cost for suitcases = \(3 \times 50 = 150\) dollars.

3. **Calculate the cost of the flight ticket:**
   - The flight ticket costs $700 more than 5 times the cost of a business suit.
   - Cost of one business suit = $100.
   - 5 times the cost of a business suit = \(5 \times 100 = 500\) dollars.
   - Cost of the flight ticket = \(500 + 700 = 1200\) dollars.

4. **Calculate Theo's total expenses:**
   - Total expenses = Cost of suits + Cost of suitcases + Cost of flight ticket
   - Total expenses = \(600 + 150 + 1200 = 1950\) dollars.

5. **Determine how much Theo wishes to save:**
   - Theo wishes to save $2000 for the trip.

6. **Calculate the total amount Theo needs (expenses + savings):**
   - Total amount needed = Total expenses + Savings
   - Total amount needed = \(1950 + 2000 = 3950\) dollars.

7. **Calculate how much Theo has left for gifts:**
   - Theo initially has $6000.
   - Amount left for gifts = Total initial amount - Total amount needed
   - Amount left for gifts = \(6000 - 3950 = 2050\) dollars.

Therefore, Theo has $2050 to spend on buying gifts for his business partners in South Africa.

**Final Answer:** Theo has $2050 to spend on gifts.
