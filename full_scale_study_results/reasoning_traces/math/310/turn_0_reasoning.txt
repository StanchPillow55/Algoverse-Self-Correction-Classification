First, let's calculate how much Theo spends on business suits and suitcases. 

He buys 6 business suits at $100 each, so that's 6 * $100 = $<<6*100=600>>600.
He buys 3 suitcases at $50 each, so that's 3 * $50 = $<<3*50=150>>150.

So, the total amount he spends on business suits and suitcases is $600 + $150 = $<<600+150=750>>750.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the flight ticket. The problem states that the flight ticket costs $700 more than 5 times as much as the cost of a business suit. 

5 times the cost of a business suit is 5 * $100 = $<<5*100=500>>500.
So, the flight ticket costs $500 + $700 = $<<500+700=1200>>1200.

So, the total amount Theo spends on business suits, suitcases, and the flight ticket is $750 + $1200 = $<<750+1200=1950>>1950.

Theo has $6000 and he wants to save $2000. So, the amount he has left to spend after saving is $6000 - $2000 = $<<6000-2000=4000>>4000.

Subtracting the amount he has already spent on business suits, suitcases, and the flight ticket from the amount he has left to spend after saving gives us the amount he has to spend on gifts for his business partners.

So, Theo has $4000 - $1950 = $<<4000-1950=2050>>2050 to spend on gifts for his business partners in South Africa. 

So, the final answer is $2050.
