Let's denote the time it took Donovan to make his part of the meal as D minutes. According to the problem, Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer than Donovan's part, so we can denote the time it took Betsy as D + 18 minutes.

The problem states that the total time to make the meal was 98 minutes. So, we can set up the following equation to represent this situation:

D (Donovan's time) + D + 18 (Betsy's time) = 98

This simplifies to:

2D + 18 = 98

Next, we can solve for D by first subtracting 18 from both sides of the equation:

2D = 98 - 18
2D = 80

Then, divide both sides of the equation by 2 to solve for D:

D = 80 / 2
D = 40

So, Donovan's part took 40 minutes. But we're asked to find how long Betsy's part took. We know that Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer than Donovan's part, so we add 18 to Donovan's time:

Betsy's time = D + 18 = 40 + 18 = 58 minutes

So, Betsy's part took 58 minutes.
