Let's denote the time it took Donovan to make his part of the meal as D (in minutes). According to the problem, Betsy's part took 18 minutes longer than Donovan's part, so we can denote the time it took Betsy as B = D + 18.

The problem also states that the total time to make the meal was 98 minutes. This means that the time it took Donovan plus the time it took Betsy equals 98 minutes. In equation form, this is D + B = 98.

We can substitute the equation for B (B = D + 18) into the equation for the total time (D + B = 98) to solve for D. This gives us D + (D + 18) = 98.

Solving this equation, we combine like terms to get 2D + 18 = 98. 

Next, we subtract 18 from both sides of the equation to isolate 2D on one side: 2D = 98 - 18 = 80.

Finally, we divide both sides of the equation by 2 to solve for D: D = 80 / 2 = 40.

So, Donovan's part took 40 minutes. 

To find out how long Betsy's part took, we substitute D = 40 into the equation for B: B = D + 18 = 40 + 18 = 58.

So, Betsy's part took 58 minutes. 

Therefore, the final answer is that Betsy's part of the meal took 58 minutes.
