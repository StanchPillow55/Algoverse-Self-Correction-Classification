Question ID: 55
Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

Jean starts with 30 lollipops. 

Step 1: Subtract the number of lollipops Jean eats from the total number of lollipops. 

30 lollipops - 2 lollipops = 28 lollipops

So, Jean has 28 lollipops left after eating 2.

Step 2: Divide the number of remaining lollipops by the number of lollipops Jean wants to put in each bag.

28 lollipops รท 2 lollipops/bag = 14 bags

So, Jean can fill 14 bags with 2 lollipops each. 

Final Answer: Jean can fill 14 bags.
