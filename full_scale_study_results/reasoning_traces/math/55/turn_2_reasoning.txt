Question ID: 55
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

Step 1: Determine the number of lollipops Jean has left after eating 2. 

Jean starts with 30 lollipops and eats 2, so we subtract 2 from 30 to find out how many lollipops are left.

30 - 2 = 28 lollipops

Step 2: Determine how many bags Jean can fill with the remaining lollipops.

Jean wants to put 2 lollipops in each bag. To find out how many bags Jean can fill, we divide the number of remaining lollipops by the number of lollipops per bag.

28 รท 2 = 14 bags

So, Jean can fill 14 bags with the remaining lollipops. 

Final Answer: Jean can fill 14 bags with the remaining lollipops.
