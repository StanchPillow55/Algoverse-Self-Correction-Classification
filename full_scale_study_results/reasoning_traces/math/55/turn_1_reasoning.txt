Question ID: 55
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

Jean starts with 30 lollipops. After eating 2, she has 30 - 2 = 28 lollipops left.

Jean wants to package these remaining lollipops into bags, with 2 lollipops per bag. To find out how many bags she can fill, we divide the total number of lollipops by the number of lollipops per bag.

So, 28 รท 2 = 14.

Therefore, Jean can fill 14 bags with her remaining lollipops.
