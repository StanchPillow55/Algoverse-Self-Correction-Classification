Question ID: 300
Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To find out how long Peter needs to exercise on Tuesday, we first need to find out how long he exercised on Sunday and Monday combined. 

On Sunday, he exercised for 23 minutes and on Monday he exercised for 16 minutes. 

So, we add these two amounts together:

23 minutes (Sunday) + 16 minutes (Monday) = 39 minutes

Now, Peter wants to exercise for twice the amount of time he did on Sunday and Monday combined on Tuesday. 

So, we multiply the total amount of time he exercised on Sunday and Monday by 2:

39 minutes * 2 = 78 minutes

Therefore, Peter needs to exercise for 78 minutes on Tuesday to reach his goal.
