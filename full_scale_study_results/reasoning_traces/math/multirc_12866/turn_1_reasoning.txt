Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To determine who Finley thinks is the cause of his current suffering, I will carefully analyze the details provided in the given paragraph.

The key details are:
1. Finley is a man who roams the streets night after night, hidden under his hat and rain jacket.
2. His goal is to find the "culprit" - the one whom he can make responsible for his suffering.
3. He considers confronting this culprit, but lacks the audacity to do so.
4. He also considers suicide, but his courage fails him.
5. Finley blames not himself, but only others for his suffering.
6. In this case, he looks to his girlfriend, Violet, as the cause of his suffering.
7. He drowns Violet in the bath, both out of malice and to be close to her one more time.
8. Finley only realizes later that his misdeeds far surpass those of Violet.

Based on this information, we can see that Finley initially thinks the "culprit" or cause of his suffering is someone else, not himself. He is searching for someone to blame and hold responsible for his suffering
