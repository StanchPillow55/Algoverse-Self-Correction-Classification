==================================================

To determine who Finley thinks is the cause of his current suffering, I will carefully analyze the details provided in the given paragraph.

The paragraph states that Finley "blames not himself, but only others." This suggests that Finley believes the cause of his suffering is not his own actions or mistakes, but rather the actions of someone else.

The paragraph then goes on to say that "in this case he looks to his girlfriend, Violet." This indicates that Finley specifically believes Violet is the cause of his suffering.

However, the paragraph also mentions that Finley "only realizes with hindsight that his misdeeds far surpass those of Violet." This implies that Finley may have initially blamed Violet, but later came to the realization that he himself was actually more responsible for his own suffering.

Therefore, based on the information provided in the paragraph, the complete reasoning is as follows:

1. Finley initially blames others, not himself, for his suffering.
2. Specifically, Finley looks to his girlfriend Violet as the cause of his suffering.
3. However, Finley later realizes that his own "misdeeds" were actually more responsible
