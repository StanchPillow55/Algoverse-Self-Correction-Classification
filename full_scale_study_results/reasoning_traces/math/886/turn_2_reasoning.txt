Question ID: 886
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, let's understand the problem. The singer has 50 microphones and he wants to arrange them in pairs. But he realizes that 20% of the microphones won't fit on the stage after arranging the rest in pairs. 

So, we need to find out how many microphones make up 20% of the total. 

To calculate 20% of 50, we multiply 50 by 0.20 (which is the decimal equivalent of 20%).

50 * 0.20 = 10

So, 10 microphones won't fit on the stage. 

That leaves us with 50 - 10 = 40 microphones that can be arranged in pairs on the stage.

Since a pair consists of 2 items, we can find the number of pairs by dividing the number of microphones by 2.

40 / 2 = 20

So, the singer was able to arrange 20 pairs of microphones on the stage. 

Final Answer: The singer was able to arrange 20 pairs of microphones on the stage.
