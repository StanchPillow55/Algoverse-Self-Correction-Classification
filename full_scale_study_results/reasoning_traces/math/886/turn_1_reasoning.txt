Question ID: 886
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to find out how many microphones won't fit on the stage. We know that 20% of the microphones won't fit, so we calculate 20% of 50. 

20% of 50 = 0.20 * 50 = 10 microphones

This means that 10 microphones won't fit on the stage after arranging the rest in pairs.

Next, we need to find out how many microphones will fit on the stage. We do this by subtracting the number of microphones that won't fit from the total number of microphones.

50 microphones - 10 microphones = 40 microphones

This means that 40 microphones will fit on the stage.

Finally, we need to find out how many pairs of microphones the singer was able to arrange. Since each pair consists of 2 microphones, we divide the number of microphones that will fit on the stage by 2.

40 microphones / 2 = 20 pairs

So, the singer was able to arrange 20 pairs of microphones on the stage.
