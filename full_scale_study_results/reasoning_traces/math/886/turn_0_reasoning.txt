Question ID: 886
Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to find out how many microphones won't fit on the stage. To do this, we multiply the total number of microphones by 20% (or 0.20). 

So, 50 microphones * 0.20 = 10 microphones

This means that 10 microphones won't fit on the stage after arranging the rest in pairs.

Next, we subtract the number of microphones that won't fit from the total number of microphones to find out how many microphones were arranged in pairs. 

So, 50 microphones - 10 microphones = 40 microphones

Finally, since each pair consists of 2 microphones, we divide the number of microphones arranged in pairs by 2 to find out how many pairs were made.

So, 40 microphones / 2 = 20 pairs

Therefore, the singer was able to arrange 20 pairs of microphones on the stage.
