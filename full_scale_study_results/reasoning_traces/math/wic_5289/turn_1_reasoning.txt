==================================================

To determine if the word "hit" is used with the same meaning in both sentences, we need to analyze the context and usage of the word in each sentence.

Sentence 1: "He tries to hit on women in bars."
In this sentence, the phrase "hit on" is an idiomatic expression that means to make sexual advances or flirt with someone. The word "hit" is not being used in its literal, physical sense, but rather in a figurative sense to describe the action of attempting to initiate a romantic or sexual interaction.

Sentence 2: "He hit a home run."
In this sentence, the word "hit" is used in its literal, physical sense to describe the action of striking a baseball and successfully hitting it out of the playing field, resulting in a home run.

Therefore, the word "hit" is not used with the same meaning in both sentences. In the first sentence, it is used figuratively, while in the second sentence, it is used literally.

Final answer: No, the word "hit" is not used with the same meaning in both sentences.
