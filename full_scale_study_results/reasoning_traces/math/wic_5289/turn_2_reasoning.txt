Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To determine if the word "hit" is used with the same meaning in both sentences, we need to analyze the context and usage of the word in each sentence.

Sentence 1: "He tries to hit on women in bars."
In this sentence, the phrase "hit on" is an idiomatic expression that means to try to attract or flirt with someone, usually in a romantic or sexual way.

Sentence 2: "He hit a home run."
In this sentence, the word "hit" is used in the context of a baseball game, where it means to successfully strike the ball with the bat, resulting in a home run.

Therefore, the word "hit" is not used with the same meaning in both sentences. In the first sentence, it is used idiomatically to mean "to flirt with," while in the second sentence, it is used literally to mean "to strike the ball."

Final answer: No, the word "hit" is not used with the same meaning in both sentences.
