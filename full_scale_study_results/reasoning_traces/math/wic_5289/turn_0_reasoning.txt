==================================================

To determine if the word "hit" is used with the same meaning in both sentences, we need to analyze the context and the meaning of the word in each sentence.

Sentence 1: "He tries to hit on women in bars."
In this sentence, the phrase "hit on" is an idiomatic expression that means to make sexual advances or flirt with someone. The word "hit" in this context does not refer to a physical action, but rather a metaphorical attempt to initiate a romantic or sexual interaction.

Sentence 2: "He hit a home run."
In this sentence, the word "hit" refers to a physical action, specifically the act of hitting a baseball and achieving a home run, which is a successful outcome in the sport of baseball.

Therefore, the word "hit" is not used with the same meaning in both sentences. In the first sentence, it is used idiomatically to mean "to flirt with," while in the second sentence, it is used literally to mean "to strike or make contact with an object."

Final answer: No, the word "hit" is not used with the same meaning in both sentences.
