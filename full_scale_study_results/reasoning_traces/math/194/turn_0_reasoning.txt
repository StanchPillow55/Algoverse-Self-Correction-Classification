Dataset Type: math
==================================================

Violetta needs crayons in 5 different colors and each crayon costs $2. 

First, we need to calculate how much will cost all 5 crayons. We do this by multiplying the number of crayons by the cost of one crayon. 

5 crayons * $2/crayon = $10

So, the total cost of the crayons is $10.

Violetta has prepared $20 for this purchase. To find out how much change she will get, we subtract the cost of the crayons from the amount she has prepared.

$20 - $10 = $10

So, Violetta will get $10 in change.
