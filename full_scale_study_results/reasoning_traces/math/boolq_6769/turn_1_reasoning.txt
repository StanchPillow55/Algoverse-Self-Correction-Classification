==================================================

To determine if Grand Central Station and Penn Station are the same, we need to examine the key details provided in the context:

1. The context mentions that Penn Station is criticized as a "low-ceilinged 'catacomb' lacking charm, especially when compared to New York's much larger and ornate Grand Central Terminal."

2. The New York Times editorial describes Amtrak's customers at Penn Station as "scurry[ing] through underground rooms bereft of light or character."

3. The context also refers to Penn Station as "the ugly stepchild of the city's two great rail terminals," implying that it is distinct from Grand Central Terminal.

Based on the information provided, we can conclude that Grand Central Station and Penn Station are not the same. The context clearly distinguishes the two, describing Penn Station as a less desirable and less impressive terminal compared to the larger and more ornate Grand Central Terminal.

Therefore, the answer to the question "Is Grand Central Station the same as Penn Station?" is no.
