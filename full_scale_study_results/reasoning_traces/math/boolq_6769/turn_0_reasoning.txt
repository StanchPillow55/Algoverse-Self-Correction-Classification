To determine if Grand Central Station and Penn Station are the same, we need to analyze the information provided in the context.

Given information:
- Pennsylvania Station (New York City) is criticized as a low-ceilinged "catacomb" lacking charm, especially when compared to New York's much larger and ornate Grand Central Terminal.
- The New York Times editorial described Amtrak's customers at Penn Station as "scurrying through underground rooms bereft of light or character."
- The Times transit reporter called Penn Station "the ugly stepchild of the city's two great rail terminals."

From the given information, we can infer the following:
1. Grand Central Terminal and Penn Station are two different rail terminals in New York City.
2. Grand Central Terminal is described as much larger and more ornate than Penn Station.
3. Penn Station is criticized for being a low-ceilinged, underground, and lacking in light and character, in contrast to Grand Central Terminal.

Therefore, the answer to the question "Is Grand Central Station the same as Penn Station?" is no, they are not the same. Grand Central Terminal and Penn Station are two distinct and different rail terminals in New York City
