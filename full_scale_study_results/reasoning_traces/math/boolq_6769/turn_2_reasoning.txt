Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To determine if Grand Central Station and Penn Station are the same, we need to examine the key details provided in the context:

1. The context states that Penn Station is criticized as a "low-ceilinged 'catacomb' lacking charm, especially when compared to New York's much larger and ornate Grand Central Terminal."

2. The context also mentions that the New York Times described Amtrak's customers at Penn Station as "now scurry[ing] through underground rooms bereft of light or character."

3. Additionally, the context states that a Times transit reporter called Penn Station "the ugly stepchild of the city's two great rail terminals."

From the information provided, we can conclude that:

1. Grand Central Terminal and Penn Station are two distinct and separate rail terminals in New York City.
2. Grand Central Terminal is described as being "much larger and ornate" compared to Penn Station.
3. Penn Station is criticized for being a "low-ceilinged 'catacomb' lacking charm" and being "bereft of light or character," in contrast to the more grand and impressive Grand Central Terminal.

Therefore, the final answer is:

No, Gran
