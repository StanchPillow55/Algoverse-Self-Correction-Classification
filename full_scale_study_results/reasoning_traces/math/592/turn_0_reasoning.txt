==================================================

First, let's calculate the total cost of the boots on Amazon.com. The boots cost $16 and the shipping costs $4. So, the total cost on Amazon.com is $16 + $4 = $20.

Next, let's calculate the total cost of the boots on eBay. The boots cost $13 and the shipping costs twice as much as it does on Amazon, which means the shipping costs 2 * $4 = $8. So, the total cost on eBay is $13 + $8 = $21.

Finally, let's calculate how much more expensive the boots are on eBay compared to Amazon. The difference in cost is $21 - $20 = $1.

So, the boots are $1 more expensive on eBay.
