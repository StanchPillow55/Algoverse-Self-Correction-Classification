Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- On Amazon.com, the boots cost $16 and shipping costs $4.
- On eBay, the boots cost $13, and the shipping costs twice as much as on Amazon.

Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the boots on Amazon.com.
Total cost on Amazon = Cost of boots + Shipping cost
Total cost on Amazon = $16 + $4 = $20

Step 2: Calculate the shipping cost on eBay.
Shipping cost on eBay = 2 × Shipping cost on Amazon
Shipping cost on eBay = 2 × $4 = $8

Step 3: Calculate the total cost of the boots on eBay.
Total cost on eBay = Cost of boots + Shipping cost
Total cost on eBay = $13 + $8 = $21

Step 4: Calculate the difference in cost between eBay and Amazon.
Difference in cost = Total cost on eBay - Total cost on Amazon
Difference in cost = $21 - $20 =
