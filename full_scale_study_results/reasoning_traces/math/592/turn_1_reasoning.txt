==================================================

To determine how much more expensive the boots are on eBay compared to Amazon, we need to calculate the total cost of purchasing the boots from each platform and then compare the two.

**Step 1: Calculate the total cost on Amazon.**

- The cost of the boots on Amazon is $16.
- The shipping cost on Amazon is $4.

Total cost on Amazon = Cost of boots + Shipping cost  
\[ \text{Total cost on Amazon} = 16 + 4 = 20 \]

**Step 2: Calculate the total cost on eBay.**

- The cost of the boots on eBay is $13.
- The shipping cost on eBay is twice the shipping cost on Amazon. Since the shipping cost on Amazon is $4, the shipping cost on eBay is \( 2 \times 4 = 8 \).

Total cost on eBay = Cost of boots + Shipping cost  
\[ \text{Total cost on eBay} = 13 + 8 = 21 \]

**Step 3: Determine how much more expensive the boots are on eBay.**

To find out how much more expensive the boots are on eBay, subtract the total cost on Amazon from the total cost on eBay:

\[ \text{Difference} = \text{Total cost on eBay} - \text{Total cost on Amazon} \]  
\[ \text{Difference} = 21 - 20 = 1 \]

**Final Answer:**

The boots are $1 more expensive on eBay compared to Amazon.
