Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, let's calculate how many times Chase and Rider ride their bikes on the usual days. They ride their bikes thrice a day for 5 days. So, we multiply 3 (times per day) by 5 (days), which gives us 15 times.

Next, let's calculate how many times they ride their bikes on the two other days. They ride twice the times they do on usual days. Since they ride 3 times on a usual day, they ride 3*2 = 6 times on these two days. Since there are two such days, we multiply 6 (times per day) by 2 (days), which gives us 12 times.

Finally, we add the number of times they ride on the usual days and the number of times they ride on the two other days to get the total number of times they ride their bikes in a week. So, 15 (times on usual days) + 12 (times on two other days) = 27 times.

Therefore, Chase and Rider ride their bikes 27 times a week.
