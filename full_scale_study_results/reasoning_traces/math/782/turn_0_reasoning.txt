==================================================

First, let's calculate how many times Chase and Rider ride their bikes on the usual days. 

They ride their bikes thrice a day for 5 days. So, the total number of times they ride their bikes on these days is 3 rides/day * 5 days = 15 rides.

Next, let's calculate how many times they ride their bikes on the other two days. 

They ride twice the times they do on usual days, which means they ride 2 * 3 rides/day = 6 rides/day. 

So, the total number of times they ride their bikes on these two days is 6 rides/day * 2 days = 12 rides.

Adding these two totals together, we find that Chase and Rider ride their bikes a total of 15 rides + 12 rides = 27 rides in a week. 

So, the final answer is that Chase and Rider ride their bikes 27 times a week.
