Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of times Chase and Rider ride their bikes on both the usual days and the two other days, then sum these up.

First, let's calculate the number of times they ride their bikes on the usual days. They ride their bikes thrice a day for 5 days, so the total number of times they ride their bikes on these days is 3 times/day * 5 days = 15 times.

Next, let's calculate the number of times they ride their bikes on the two other days. They ride twice the times they do on usual days, so they ride 2 * 3 times/day = 6 times/day. Since there are two of these days, the total number of times they ride their bikes on these days is 6 times/day * 2 days = 12 times.

Finally, to find the total number of times they ride their bikes in a week, we add the number of times they ride on the usual days to the number of times they ride on the two other days. This gives us 15 times + 12 times = 27 times.

So, Chase and Rider ride their bikes 27 times a week.
