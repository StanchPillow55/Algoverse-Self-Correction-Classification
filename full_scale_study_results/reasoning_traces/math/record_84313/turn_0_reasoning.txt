==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine the missing word in the given query.

Given information:
- The passage discusses the lack of congressional opposition to the war in Afghanistan, despite the release of classified documents by WikiLeaks.
- The query mentions the "intensity of the opposition" in a certain location, which is missing.

To find the missing word, we need to analyze the context of the passage and the query.

The passage does not mention any specific location where there was intense opposition to the war. It focuses on the lack of opposition in Congress, particularly from the Democratic party.

The query seems to be referring to a different situation, possibly a past war, where there was intense opposition from across the political spectrum.

Based on this analysis, the most likely missing word in the query is "Vietnam". The passage mentions the war in Vietnam, and the query appears to be referring to the intense opposition to that war.

Therefore, the complete query would be:

"Most remarkable was the intensity of the opposition in Vietnam that came from across the political spectrum."

This aligns with the context of the passage, which discusses the lack of similar opposition in the current war in Afghanistan.

Final answer: Vietnam
