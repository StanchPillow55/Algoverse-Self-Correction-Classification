==================================================

To solve this problem, I will need to fill in the missing information in the query. The query states that the most remarkable thing was the intensity of the opposition in "@placeholder" that came from across the political spectrum. 

Based on the passage, the most relevant context seems to be the lack of opposition in Congress to the administration's policies in the war in Afghanistan, despite the release of classified documents by WikiLeaks. 

Therefore, the missing information in the "@placeholder" is likely referring to the Vietnam War, not the war in Afghanistan.

The passage mentions that the Senate Foreign Affairs Committee, chaired by John Kerry, who had previously provided "riveting testimony" about the problems with the Vietnam War, has been "relatively quiescent" regarding the war in Afghanistan.

This suggests that the intensity of the opposition in the Vietnam War, which is the "placeholder" in the query, was much more pronounced compared to the lack of opposition in Congress regarding the war in Afghanistan.

So the complete query would be:

"Most remarkable was the intensity of the opposition in the Vietnam War that came from across the political spectrum."

The reasoning and work is as follows:

1. Identified the missing information in the "@placeholder" as likely
