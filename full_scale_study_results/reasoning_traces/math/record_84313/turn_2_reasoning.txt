Question ID: record_84313
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, I will need to fill in the missing information in the query. The query states that the most remarkable thing was the intensity of the opposition in "@placeholder" that came from across the political spectrum. 

Based on the passage, the most relevant context seems to be the lack of opposition in Congress to the administration's policies in the war in Afghanistan, despite the release of classified documents by WikiLeaks. 

Therefore, the missing information in the query, "@placeholder", is likely referring to the Vietnam War, not the war in Afghanistan.

The passage mentions that the Senate Foreign Affairs Committee, chaired by John Kerry, who had previously provided "riveting testimony" about the problems with the Vietnam War, has been "relatively quiescent" regarding the war in Afghanistan. This suggests that the intensity of opposition to the Vietnam War, as opposed to the war in Afghanistan, is what the query is referring to.

So the complete query would be:

"Most remarkable was the intensity of the opposition in the Vietnam War that came from across the political spectrum."

The reasoning and work is as follows:

1. Identified the missing information in the query as referring to the Vietnam War, based on the context provided in the passage.
