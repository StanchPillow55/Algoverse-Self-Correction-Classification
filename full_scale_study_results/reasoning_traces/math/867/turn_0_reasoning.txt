Question ID: 867
Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to find out how much the bag of sweet potatoes weighed. Since it weighed 2 times as much as the potatoes, we multiply the weight of the potatoes by 2:

5 pounds * 2 = 10 pounds

So, the bag of sweet potatoes weighed 10 pounds.

Next, we need to find out how much the bag of carrots weighed. Since it weighed 3 pounds fewer than the sweet potatoes, we subtract 3 from the weight of the sweet potatoes:

10 pounds - 3 pounds = 7 pounds

So, the bag of carrots weighed 7 pounds.

Therefore, Daisy bought 7 pounds of carrots.
