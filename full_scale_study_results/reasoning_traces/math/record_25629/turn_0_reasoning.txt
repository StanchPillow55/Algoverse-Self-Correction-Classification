Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, I will need to determine who the "she" is referring to in the given query. Based on the information provided in the passage, the two individuals who died were Bernard Harris and Christine Elizabeth McLeish Sugarhood.

Given information:
- Bernard Harris, 53, from London, died after jumping into the sea to rescue Christine Sugarhood.
- Christine Elizabeth McLeish Sugarhood, 66, from West Sussex, died after suffering a heart attack in the water.

The query states "@placeholder was an active and popular member involved in all aspects of the club and she will be greatly missed." This suggests that the "she" is referring to Christine Elizabeth McLeish Sugarhood, as she was the one who died in the incident.

Therefore, the final answer to the query is:

"Christine Sugarhood was an active and popular member involved in all aspects of the club and she will be greatly missed."
