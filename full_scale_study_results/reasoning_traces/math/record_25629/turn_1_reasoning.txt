Question ID: record_25629
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

I apologize, but I do not have enough information from the given passage to determine the name that should be inserted into the placeholder. The passage does not mention any specific person who was an active and popular member of a club. It only provides details about the tragic deaths of Bernard Harris and Christine Sugarhood in Cyprus. Without additional context about a club and a specific person, I cannot provide a reasonable answer to fill in the placeholder. Please provide more details about the context of the query, and I will try to assist further.
