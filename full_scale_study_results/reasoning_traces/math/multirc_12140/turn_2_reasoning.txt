Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, I will go through the information provided in the paragraph step-by-step:

1. The paragraph states that RTSH (Radio Televizioni Shqiptar) is the public radio and TV broadcaster of Albania.
2. It mentions that RTSH runs three analogue television stations as TVSH Televizioni Shqiptar, four digital thematic stations as RTSH, and three radio stations using the name Radio Tirana.
3. The paragraph also states that RTSH has an international service that broadcasts radio programmes in Albanian and seven other languages.
4. The international service uses the theme from the song "Keputa nje gjethe dafine" as its signature tune.

Based on this information, the question is asking in how many languages the international service broadcasts radio programmes using the theme from the song "Keputa nje gjethe dafine" as their signature tune.

The paragraph clearly states that the international service broadcasts radio programmes in Albanian and seven other languages. Therefore, the total number of languages, including Albanian, is 8.

Final answer: 8 languages
