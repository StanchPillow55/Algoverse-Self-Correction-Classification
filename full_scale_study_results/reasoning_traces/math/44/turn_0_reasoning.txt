Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to determine how much beeswax Charlie needs to make 20 candles. Since he can make 10 candles from 1 pound of beeswax, he will need 20/10 = 2 pounds of beeswax to make 20 candles.

Next, we need to calculate the cost of the supplies. Since 1 pound of beeswax and the wicks cost $10, the cost of the supplies for 2 pounds of beeswax will be 2*10 = $20.

Then, we need to calculate the revenue from selling 20 candles. Since each candle is sold for $2, the total revenue from selling 20 candles will be 20*2 = $40.

Finally, we subtract the cost of the supplies from the total revenue to find the net profit. So, the net profit will be 40 - 20 = $20.

Therefore, Charlie's net profit if he makes and sells 20 candles is $20.
