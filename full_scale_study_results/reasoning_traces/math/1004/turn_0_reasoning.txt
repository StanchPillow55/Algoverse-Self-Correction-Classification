==================================================

First, we need to find out how many chocolate bars are in each box that Peter and Martha have.

Peter has 64 chocolate bars in 4 boxes. To find out how many chocolate bars are in each box, we divide the total number of chocolate bars by the number of boxes. 

64 รท 4 = 16

So, Peter has 16 chocolate bars in each box.

Martha has 56 chocolate bars in 7 boxes. To find out how many chocolate bars are in each box, we divide the total number of chocolate bars by the number of boxes. 

56 รท 7 = 8

So, Martha has 8 chocolate bars in each box.

To find out how many more chocolate bars Peter has in each box than Martha, we subtract the number of chocolate bars in each of Martha's boxes from the number of chocolate bars in each of Peter's boxes.

16 - 8 = 8

So, Peter has 8 more chocolate bars in each box than Martha. 

Final Answer: Peter has 8 more chocolate bars in each box than Martha.
