Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To determine how much money Tim saves by switching from his cable package to streaming services, we need to calculate the total monthly cost of the streaming services and compare it to the cost of his cable package.

1. **Calculate the cost of Netflix:**
   - Netflix costs $10 per month.

2. **Calculate the cost of Hulu and Disney Plus with the bundle discount:**
   - Normally, Hulu costs $10 per month and Disney Plus costs $10 per month.
   - Without the bundle, the total cost for both would be: 
     \[
     10 + 10 = 20 \text{ dollars per month}
     \]
   - Tim saves 20% by bundling Hulu and Disney Plus. To find the discount amount:
     \[
     20\% \text{ of } 20 = 0.20 \times 20 = 4 \text{ dollars}
     \]
   - Therefore, the bundled cost for Hulu and Disney Plus is:
     \[
     20 - 4 = 16 \text{ dollars per month}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total cost of the streaming services:**
   - Add the cost of Netflix to the bundled cost of Hulu and Disney Plus:
     \[
     10 + 16 = 26 \text{ dollars per month}
     \]

4. **Calculate the savings by switching from cable to streaming:**
   - Tim's cable package costs $60 per month.
   - The savings is the difference between the cable cost and the streaming cost:
     \[
     60 - 26 = 34 \text{ dollars per month}
     \]

Therefore, Tim saves $34 per month by cancelling his cable package and switching to streaming services.

**Final Answer:** Tim saves $34 per month.
