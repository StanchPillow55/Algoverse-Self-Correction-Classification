==================================================

First, let's calculate the cost of Hulu and Disney Plus with the 20% discount. 

The original cost of Hulu and Disney Plus is $10 each, so together they cost $10 + $10 = $20.

A 20% discount on $20 is calculated as 20/100 * 20 = $4.

So, the cost of Hulu and Disney Plus with the discount is $20 - $4 = $16.

Adding the cost of Netflix, which is $10, the total cost of the streaming services is $16 + $10 = $26.

Now, let's calculate how much money Tim saves by cancelling his $60 cable package.

The savings is calculated as the original cost of the cable package minus the cost of the streaming services, which is $60 - $26 = $34.

So, Tim saves $34 by cancelling his cable package and getting streaming services.
