==================================================

Let's denote the number of cupcakes Carly made as C and the number of brownies as B. 

From the problem, we know that Carly made 2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes. This can be written as:

B = 3C - 2

We also know that Carly's class has five people and each person gets two treats. This means Carly made a total of 5 * 2 = 10 treats.

Since the total number of treats is the sum of the cupcakes and brownies, we can write this as:

C + B = 10

Now we have a system of two equations, and we can solve it by substitution or elimination. Let's use substitution:

Substitute B from the first equation into the second equation:

C + 3C - 2 = 10
4C - 2 = 10
4C = 12
C = 12 / 4
C = 3

So Carly made 3 cupcakes.

To check our work, we can substitute C = 3 into the first equation:

B = 3*3 - 2
B = 7

So Carly made 7 brownies. Adding the cupcakes and brownies together, we get 3 + 7 = 10 treats, which matches the total number of treats Carly made. 

So the final answer is that Carly made 3 cupcakes.
