==================================================

Let's denote the number of cupcakes Carly made as C and the number of brownies as B. 

According to the problem, Carly makes 2 less than three times as many brownies as cupcakes. This can be written as:

B = 3C - 2

The problem also states that Carly's class has five people and each person gets two treats. This means that the total number of treats Carly made is 5 * 2 = 10.

Since the total number of treats is the sum of the cupcakes and brownies, we can write:

C + B = 10

Now we have a system of two equations:

1) B = 3C - 2
2) C + B = 10

We can substitute equation 1 into equation 2 to solve for C:

C + (3C - 2) = 10
4C - 2 = 10
4C = 12
C = 12 / 4
C = 3

So, Carly made 3 cupcakes. 

To check our work, we can substitute C = 3 into the first equation to find B:

B = 3*3 - 2 = 7

Adding the number of cupcakes and brownies together gives us 3 + 7 = 10, which matches the total number of treats Carly made. 

Therefore, Carly made 3 cupcakes.
