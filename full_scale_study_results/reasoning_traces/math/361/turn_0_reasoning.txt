==================================================

The first step is to calculate the total distance the train travels in one trip. The distance from the first city to the second city is 75 miles, and the distance from the second city to the third city is 100 miles. So, the total distance from the first city to the third city is 75 + 100 = 175 miles.

The distance from the third city back to the first city is 50 miles less than the combined distance of the first two legs, so it's 175 - 50 = 125 miles.

So, the total distance the train travels in one complete trip is 175 + 125 = 300 miles.

The train makes this trip 3 times a day, so it travels 300 * 3 = 900 miles per day.

The train needs service every 18,000 miles. To find out how many days the train can go between services, we divide the total miles before service by the miles traveled per day. So, 18,000 / 900 = 20 days.

Therefore, the train can go 20 days between services.
