Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, let's calculate the total distance the train travels in one trip. The distance from the first city to the second city is 75 miles, and from the second city to the third city is 100 miles. So, the total distance from the first city to the third city is 75 miles + 100 miles = 175 miles.

The distance from the third city to the first city is 50 miles less than the combined distance of the first two legs of the trip, so it's 175 miles - 50 miles = 125 miles.

So, the total distance the train travels in one complete trip is 175 miles + 125 miles = 300 miles.

The train makes this trip 3 times a day, so in one day, the train travels 300 miles * 3 = 900 miles.

The train needs service every 18,000 miles. To find out how many days the train goes between services, we divide the total miles before service by the miles traveled per day. 

So, 18,000 miles รท 900 miles/day = 20 days.

Therefore, the train goes 20 days between services.
