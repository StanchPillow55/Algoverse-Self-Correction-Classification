Question ID: 361
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, let's find out the total distance the train travels in one trip. 

The distance from the first city to the second city is 75 miles, and the distance from the second city to the third city is 100 miles. So, the total distance from the first city to the third city is 75 miles + 100 miles = 175 miles.

The distance from the third city back to the first city is 50 miles less than the combined distance of the first two legs of the trip. So, the distance from the third city to the first city is 175 miles - 50 miles = 125 miles.

Therefore, the total distance the train travels in one trip is 175 miles + 125 miles = 300 miles.

Since the train makes this trip 3 times a day, the total distance it travels in one day is 300 miles x 3 = 900 miles.

The train needs service every 18,000 miles. To find out how many days the train can go between services, we divide the total miles before service by the miles the train travels in one day.

So, the number of days the train can go between services is 18,000 miles รท 900 miles/day = 20 days.

Therefore, the train goes 20 days between services.
