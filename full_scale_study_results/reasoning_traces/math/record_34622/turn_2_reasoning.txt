Question ID: record_34622
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine which province in Indonesia the government has warned residents to stay away from the coastline for up to five days due to the possibility of more earthquakes.

Given information:
- The passage mentions that the earthquake and tsunami occurred in western Indonesia.
- It also mentions that a magnitude 5.3 earthquake rumbled in Maluku province to the east.

Based on the information provided, the province that the government has likely warned residents to stay away from the coastline for up to five days is Maluku province.

The reasoning is as follows:
1. The passage states that the earthquake and tsunami occurred in western Indonesia, which suggests that the warning is not for that region.
2. The passage mentions a magnitude 5.3 earthquake in Maluku province, which is located to the east of the affected area.
3. It is common for governments to issue warnings and advisories for areas that may be affected by potential aftershocks or additional seismic activity following a major earthquake.

Therefore, the answer to the question is:
Maluku province
