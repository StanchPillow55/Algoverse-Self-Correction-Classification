==================================================

To solve this problem, I need to determine which province in Indonesia the government has warned residents to stay away from the coastline for up to five days due to the possibility of more earthquakes.

Given information:
- The passage mentions that the earthquake and tsunami occurred in western Indonesia.
- The passage also mentions a magnitude 5.3 earthquake in Maluku province to the east.

Based on the information provided, the most likely province that the government has warned residents to stay away from the coastline is Sumatra province, which is located in western Indonesia.

Therefore, the answer to the question is:
Sumatra
