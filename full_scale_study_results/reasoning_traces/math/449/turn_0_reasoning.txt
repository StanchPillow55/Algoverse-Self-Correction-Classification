Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to find out how many crayons Beatrice bought in the packets that had eight pieces each. 

To do this, we multiply the number of packets by the number of crayons in each packet. 

So, 6 packets * 8 crayons per packet = 48 crayons.

Next, we need to find out how many crayons Beatrice bought in the packets that had sixteen pieces each. 

Again, we multiply the number of packets by the number of crayons in each packet. 

So, 4 packets * 16 crayons per packet = 64 crayons.

Finally, we add the number of crayons from the packets of eight and the packets of sixteen to find the total number of crayons Beatrice bought. 

So, 48 crayons + 64 crayons = 112 crayons.

Therefore, Beatrice bought a total of 112 colors of crayons for her Art class.
