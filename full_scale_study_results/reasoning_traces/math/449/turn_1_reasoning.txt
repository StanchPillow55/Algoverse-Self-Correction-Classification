Question ID: 449
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of crayons Beatrice bought. We know that she bought two different types of packets: one type with eight crayons each and the other type with sixteen crayons each.

First, let's calculate the total number of crayons from the packets that had eight pieces each. Since Beatrice bought six of these packets, we multiply the number of crayons in each packet (8) by the number of packets (6):

8 crayons/packet * 6 packets = 48 crayons

Next, let's calculate the total number of crayons from the packets that had sixteen pieces each. Since Beatrice bought four of these packets, we multiply the number of crayons in each packet (16) by the number of packets (4):

16 crayons/packet * 4 packets = 64 crayons

Finally, to find the total number of crayons Beatrice bought, we add the number of crayons from the eight-piece packets to the number of crayons from the sixteen-piece packets:

48 crayons + 64 crayons = 112 crayons

So, Beatrice bought a total of 112 colors of crayons.
