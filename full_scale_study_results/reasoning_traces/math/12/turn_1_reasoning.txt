Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to consider both the initial cost of planting the tree and the annual costs and revenues associated with maintaining it.

First, let's calculate the annual net income from the tree. Carlos can sell each lemon for $1.5 and the tree produces 7 lemons each year. So, the annual income from selling the lemons is 7 lemons * $1.5/lemon = $10.5.

However, Carlos also has to spend $3 each year to water and feed the tree. So, the annual net income from the tree is $10.5 - $3 = $7.5.

Now, let's consider the initial cost of planting the tree, which is $90. To find out how many years it will take for Carlos to start earning money on the lemon tree, we need to divide the initial cost by the annual net income. 

So, the number of years it will take is $90 / $7.5/year = 12 years.

Therefore, it will take Carlos 12 years before he starts earning money on the lemon tree.
