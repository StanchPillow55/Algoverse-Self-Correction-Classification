Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, let's calculate the net income Carlos gets from the tree each year. He sells 7 lemons at $1.5 each, which gives him 7 * $1.5 = $10.5. However, he also spends $3 a year to water and feed the tree, so his net income each year is $10.5 - $3 = $7.5.

Now, let's calculate how many years it will take for Carlos to recover the initial cost of the tree. The tree cost $90 to plant, so he needs to earn $90 to break even. If he earns $7.5 a year, it will take him $90 / $7.5 = 12 years to recover the cost of the tree.

Therefore, Carlos will start earning money on the lemon tree after 12 years.
