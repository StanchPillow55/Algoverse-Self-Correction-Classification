Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to calculate how many years it will take for the revenue from selling lemons to exceed the total cost of planting and maintaining the tree.

First, let's calculate the annual revenue from selling lemons. Carlos can sell each lemon for $1.5 and the tree produces 7 lemons each year. So, the annual revenue is $1.5 * 7 = $10.5.

However, Carlos also has to spend $3 each year to water and feed the tree. So, his net annual income from the tree (revenue - cost) is $10.5 - $3 = $7.5.

Now, let's calculate how many years it will take for this net income to cover the initial cost of planting the tree, which is $90. We divide the initial cost by the net annual income to get the number of years: $90 / $7.5 = 12 years.

Therefore, it will take Carlos 12 years before he starts earning money on the lemon tree.
