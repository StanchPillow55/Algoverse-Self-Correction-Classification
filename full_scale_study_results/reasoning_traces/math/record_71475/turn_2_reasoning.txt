==================================================

To solve this problem, I need to find the player who scored the hat-trick in the given passage.

The passage states that "Vereniki Goneva enjoyed an excellent performance, scoring a 17-minute hat-trick". Therefore, the player who scored the hat-trick is Vereniki Goneva.

The passage also mentions that the hat-trick came when Vereniki Goneva "ran almost the full length of the field after intercepting a pass". This provides the additional information needed to answer the query.

Therefore, the final answer is:
The hat-trick came when Vereniki Goneva ran almost the full length of the field after intercepting a pass.
