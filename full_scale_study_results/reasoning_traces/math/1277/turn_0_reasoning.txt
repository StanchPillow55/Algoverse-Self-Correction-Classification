Question ID: 1277
Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to find out Emma's age. Since Mia is 40 years old and Emma is 16 years older than Mia, we can add 16 to 40 to find Emma's age.

40 + 16 = 56

So, Emma is 56 years old.

To find the average of their ages, we add their ages together and then divide by 2 (since there are two people).

(40 + 56) รท 2 = 96 รท 2 = 48

So, the average of their ages is 48 years old.
