Question ID: 809
Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

Dale initially ordered 100 butterscotch candies. However, he ended up selling 150 candies. This means he sold 50 more candies than he initially ordered. 

Mathematically, this can be represented as:

150 candies sold - 100 candies ordered = 50 candies

This means he owed 50 candies to his customers after his first round of sales.

Then, Dale ordered 100 more candies. Now, he has 100 candies, but he still owes 50 candies to his customers from his previous sales. 

So, to find out how many candies Dale still needs to sell, we subtract the number of candies he owes from the number of candies he has:

100 candies now - 50 candies owed = 50 candies

So, Dale still needs to sell 50 candies to sell all of his candy.
