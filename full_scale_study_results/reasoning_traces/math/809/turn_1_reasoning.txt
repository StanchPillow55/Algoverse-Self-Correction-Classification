==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine how many butterscotch candies Dale still needs to sell to sell all of his candy.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Order and Sales:**
   - Dale initially ordered 100 butterscotch candies.
   - He sold 150 candies.

2. **Understanding the Sales:**
   - Dale sold 150 candies, but he only had 100 candies initially. This means he sold 50 more candies than he had in stock. These 50 candies are part of the orders he took but hadn't fulfilled yet.

3. **Additional Order:**
   - Dale ordered 100 more candies to fulfill the orders he took.

4. **Calculating Remaining Candies:**
   - After selling 150 candies, Dale had a deficit of 50 candies (since he only had 100 initially).
   - By ordering 100 more candies, he now has 100 candies in stock.

5. **Determining Remaining Sales Needed:**
   - Since Dale has already sold 150 candies (including the 50 he oversold), he needs to sell the remaining 100 candies he now has in stock to sell all of his candy.

Therefore, Dale still needs to sell 100 more butterscotch candies to sell all of his candy.

**Final Answer:**
Dale still needs to sell 100 butterscotch candies.
