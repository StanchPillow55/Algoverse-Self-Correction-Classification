Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine how many butterscotch candies Dale still needs to sell after his transactions.

1. **Initial Order and Sales:**
   - Dale initially ordered 100 butterscotch candies.
   - He sold 150 candies.

   At this point, Dale has sold more candies than he initially ordered. This means he has taken orders for 150 candies, but only had 100 candies to fulfill those orders. Therefore, he is short by:

   \[
   150 \text{ (candies sold)} - 100 \text{ (candies initially ordered)} = 50 \text{ candies}
   \]

   Dale needs 50 more candies to fulfill the orders he has already taken.

2. **Additional Order:**
   - Dale then ordered 100 more candies.

   Now, Dale has a total of:

   \[
   100 \text{ (initial order)} + 100 \text{ (additional order)} = 200 \text{ candies}
   \]

3. **Calculating Remaining Candies to Sell:**
   - Dale has sold 150 candies already, and he has 200 candies in total.

   To find out how many candies Dale still needs to sell to sell all of his candy, we calculate:

   \[
   200 \text{ (total candies)} - 150 \text{ (candies sold)} = 50 \text{ candies}
   \]

Thus, Dale still needs to sell 50 more candies to sell all of his candy.

**Final Answer: Dale still needs to sell 50 candies.**
