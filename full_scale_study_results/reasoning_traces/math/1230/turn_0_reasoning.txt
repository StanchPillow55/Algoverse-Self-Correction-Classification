Dataset Type: math
==================================================

Charlie's standard rate for a lesson is $80 per hour. 

He has 4 lessons at this rate today, so he will earn 4 * $80 = $<<4*80=320>>320 for these lessons.

For veterans, Charlie reduces his rate by 25%. 

To find the reduced rate, we need to calculate 25% of $80. 

25% of $80 is 0.25 * $80 = $<<0.25*80=20>>20.

So, the reduced rate for veterans is $80 - $20 = $<<80-20=60>>60 per hour.

Charlie has 2 lessons with veterans today, so he will earn 2 * $60 = $<<2*60=120>>120 for these lessons.

Adding these two amounts together, Charlie will earn $320 + $120 = $<<320+120=440>>440 for the day.

So, the total amount of money Charlie will make for the day is $440.
