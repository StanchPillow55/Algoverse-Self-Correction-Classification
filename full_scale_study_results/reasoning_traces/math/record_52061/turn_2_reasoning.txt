==================================================

Unfortunately, there is no mathematical problem or calculation to solve in the given passage. The passage is a sports news article describing an unexpected upset in a football (soccer) match between Chelsea and Bradford City in the FA Cup. 

The passage does not contain any numerical data or information that can be used to solve a math problem. It is simply a descriptive account of the match events, including the goals scored by the players.

Since there is no mathematical problem or calculation to solve, I cannot provide any step-by-step work or reasoning. The passage is purely narrative in nature and does not lend itself to a mathematical treatment.

The only way I could attempt to answer a math-related question would be if you provided an explicit math problem or calculation that is somehow related to the information given in the passage. Without such a specific math-based question, I cannot generate a meaningful mathematical solution. Please let me know if you have a different question that involves numerical data or calculations that I can try to solve.
