==================================================

Unfortunately, there is no mathematical problem or calculation to solve in the given passage. The passage is a description of a football (soccer) match between Chelsea and Bradford City, where Bradford City came back from 2-0 down to win 4-2. 

The query "They'd dreamed of scoring or providing an assist at @placeholder during those fledgling days" does not contain any numerical information that can be used to solve a math problem. It is simply a statement about the players' aspirations during their early careers.

As an AI language model, I do not have the capability to solve math problems or provide mathematical reasoning without being given a specific math-related question or problem statement. The information provided in the passage and the query does not contain any mathematical elements that I can work with.

Therefore, I cannot provide a step-by-step solution or final answer for a math problem in this case. The passage and query are purely descriptive and do not involve any numerical calculations or mathematical reasoning.
