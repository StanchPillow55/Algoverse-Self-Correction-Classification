==================================================

Unfortunately, there is no mathematical problem or calculation to solve in the given passage. The passage is a sports news article describing a remarkable comeback by Bradford City against Chelsea in the FA Cup. It does not contain any numerical information or a mathematical problem that I can solve.

The query "They'd dreamed of scoring or providing an assist at @placeholder during those fledgling days" also does not seem to be a mathematical problem. It appears to be a hypothetical statement about someone's dreams or aspirations, without any numerical values or calculations involved.

As an AI math problem solver, I do not have the capability to extract a mathematical problem from this type of textual information. I can only provide solutions to well-defined mathematical problems that are presented to me. Without a clear mathematical question or problem statement, I cannot generate any meaningful work or reasoning, nor provide a final answer.
