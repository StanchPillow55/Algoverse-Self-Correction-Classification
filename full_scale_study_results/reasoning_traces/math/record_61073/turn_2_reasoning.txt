Question ID: record_61073
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of seats the Democrats control in the Senate.

Given information:
- The Senate has a total of 100 seats.
- The Democrats control 59 seats in the Senate.

Since the Democrats control 59 seats, they will be able to pass the budget with a simple majority vote instead of the 60 seats needed to overcome a filibuster.

The reasoning is as follows:
1. The Senate has a total of 100 seats.
2. The Democrats control 59 seats in the Senate.
3. To pass a bill with a simple majority, the Democrats need 51 votes (more than half of the 100 seats).
4. Since the Democrats control 59 seats, they have more than the 51 votes required to pass the budget with a simple majority.

Therefore, the Democrats, who control 59 seats in the Senate, will be able to pass the budget with a simple majority vote instead of the 60 seats needed to overcome a filibuster.
