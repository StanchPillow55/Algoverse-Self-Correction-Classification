==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to understand the context and the information provided in the passage.

Given information:
- The U.S. Congress approved a $3.4 trillion budget for the coming year.
- The budget plan passed without a single Republican vote in either the House or Senate.
- The Senate voted for the plan 53-43, and the House voted 233-193.
- The query states that Democrats, who control 59 seats in the Senate, will be able to pass the budget with a simple majority vote instead of the 60 needed to overcome a filibuster.

Step 1: Determine the number of seats in the Senate.
The passage states that Democrats control 59 seats in the Senate. This implies that the total number of seats in the Senate is 100.

Step 2: Determine the number of votes needed to pass the budget with a simple majority.
With a total of 100 seats in the Senate, a simple majority would be 51 votes.

Step 3: Determine if the Democrats can pass the budget with a simple majority.
The passage states that the Senate voted 53-43 in favor of the budget plan
