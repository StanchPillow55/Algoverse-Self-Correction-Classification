Question ID: 824
Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to calculate the total number of tins of cat food and dog food that Kimberly bought. 

For the cat food, we multiply the number of packages by the number of tins per package. This gives us:

8 packages * 11 tins/package = 88 tins of cat food

For the dog food, we do the same:

6 packages * 6 tins/package = 36 tins of dog food

To find out how many more tins of cat food than dog food Kimberly bought, we subtract the total number of dog food tins from the total number of cat food tins:

88 tins - 36 tins = 52 tins

So, Kimberly bought 52 more tins of cat food than dog food.
