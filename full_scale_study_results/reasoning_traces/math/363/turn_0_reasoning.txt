Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to calculate the time it takes for John to drive to his friend's house. The total distance he drives is 200 miles + 10 miles = 210 miles. Since he drives at a speed of 70 mph, the time it takes is distance divided by speed, which is 210 miles รท 70 mph = 3 hours.

Next, we calculate the time it takes for John to drive back home. The distance he drives is 240 miles and he drives at a speed of 80 mph. So, the time it takes is distance divided by speed, which is 240 miles รท 80 mph = 3 hours.

Adding the time it takes for John to drive to his friend's house and back home, we get 3 hours + 3 hours = 6 hours.

So, the total time for the trip is 6 hours.
