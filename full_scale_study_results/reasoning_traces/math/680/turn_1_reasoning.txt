Question ID: 680
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine the total weight of Jack and the 8 other adults riding the elevator and compare it to the maximum load the elevator can support.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of people in the elevator.**

Jack is riding the elevator with 8 other adults. Therefore, the total number of people in the elevator is:

\[ 1 + 8 = 9 \]

**Step 2: Calculate the total weight of the people in the elevator.**

Each adult, including Jack, weighs an average of 80 kg. Therefore, the total weight of the 9 adults is:

\[ 9 \times 80 \, \text{kg} = 720 \, \text{kg} \]

**Step 3: Compare the total weight to the maximum load of the elevator.**

The maximum load the elevator can support is 700 kg. We need to find out by how much the total weight exceeds this maximum load:

\[ 720 \, \text{kg} - 700 \, \text{kg} = 20 \, \text{kg} \]

**Conclusion:**

The total weight of Jack and the 8 other adults exceeds the maximum load of the elevator by 20 kg.

**Final Answer:**

They have exceeded the maximum load of the elevator by 20 kg.
