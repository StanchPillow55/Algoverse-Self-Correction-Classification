Question ID: 680
Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

The total number of adults in the elevator is Jack plus 8 other adults, which is 1 + 8 = 9 adults.

The total weight of the adults in the elevator is the number of adults times the average weight of an adult, which is 9 * 80 kg = 720 kg.

The amount by which they have exceeded the maximum load of the elevator is the total weight of the adults minus the maximum load of the elevator, which is 720 kg - 700 kg = 20 kg.

Therefore, Jack and the 8 other adults have exceeded the maximum load of the elevator by 20 kg.
