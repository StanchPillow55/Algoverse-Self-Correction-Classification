Dataset Type: math
==================================================

Let's start by working backwards from the information given.

First, we know that the Allosaurus ate the last 270 kilograms of meat. But this was after the velociraptors had already eaten half of what was left after the T-Rex had its meal. This means that before the velociraptors ate, there must have been twice as much meat as what the Allosaurus ate, because half of it was left for the Allosaurus. So, we multiply the Allosaurus's portion by 2:

270 kg * 2 = 540 kg

So, there were 540 kilograms of meat left after the T-Rex ate.

Next, we know that the T-Rex ate half of the triceratops. This means that the 540 kilograms was the other half that the T-Rex didn't eat. So, to find out how much meat was on the triceratops before the T-Rex ate, we again multiply by 2:

540 kg * 2 = 1080 kg

So, there were 1080 kilograms of meat on the triceratops before the T-Rex ate. This is our final answer.
