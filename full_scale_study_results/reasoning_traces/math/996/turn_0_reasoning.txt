Dataset Type: math
==================================================

Let's denote the ages of the children as follows: Akbar = A, Alessandro = B, Helene = H, and Wilfred = W. 

From the problem, we know that:

A = 3 years old
B = 4 years old
H = 2 * (average age of the group)
The total age of the group = A + B + H + W = 20 years

First, let's find the average age of the group. The average age is the total age divided by the number of children, which is 4. So, the average age is 20/4 = 5 years.

Now, we know that Helene's age is twice the average age, so H = 2 * 5 = 10 years.

Now, we can find Wilfred's age by subtracting the ages of Akbar, Alessandro, and Helene from the total age. So, W = 20 - (A + B + H) = 20 - (3 + 4 + 10) = 20 - 17 = 3 years.

So, Wilfred is 3 years old.
