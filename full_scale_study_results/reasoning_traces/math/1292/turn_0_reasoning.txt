Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, let's find out how tall Anne is. Since Anne is twice the size of Albert, and Albert is 36" tall, Anne is 2 * 36" = 72" tall.

Next, we know that Jackie is now 2" shorter than Anne. So, Jackie is 72" - 2" = 70" tall.

Finally, we know that Jackie grew 3" over the summer. So, before the summer, Jackie was 70" - 3" = 67" tall.

Therefore, Jackie was 67" tall before the summer.
