Let's denote Emil's dad's age as D and his brother's age as B. 

According to the problem, in 5 years (when Emil is 24), he will be half the age of his dad and twice as old as his brother. This gives us two equations:

1) 24 = D/2
2) 24 = 2B

From equation 1, we can solve for D (Emil's dad's age in 5 years) by multiplying both sides by 2:

D = 24 * 2 = 48 years old

From equation 2, we can solve for B (Emil's brother's age in 5 years) by dividing both sides by 2:

B = 24 / 2 = 12 years old

However, we are asked for the sum of the ages of Emil's dad and brother now, not in 5 years. So, we need to subtract 5 from each of these future ages to get their current ages:

D (now) = 48 - 5 = 43 years old
B (now) = 12 - 5 = 7 years old

Finally, we add these two ages together to get the sum of the ages of Emil's dad and brother now:

43 + 7 = 50 years old

So, the sum of the ages of Emil's dad and brother now is 50 years.
