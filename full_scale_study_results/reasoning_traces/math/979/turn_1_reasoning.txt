==================================================

Let's break down the information given in the problem:

1. Emil is 19 years old now.
2. When he turns 24, he will be half the age of his dad.
3. When he turns 24, he will be twice as old as his brother.

From the second point, we can infer that Emil's dad will be 48 years old when Emil is 24. This is because Emil's age at that time (24) is half of his dad's age. So, if we double Emil's age at that time, we get his dad's age: 24 * 2 = 48.

From the third point, we can infer that Emil's brother will be 12 years old when Emil is 24. This is because Emil's age at that time (24) is twice his brother's age. So, if we halve Emil's age at that time, we get his brother's age: 24 / 2 = 12.

Now, we need to find out the current ages of Emil's dad and brother. Since Emil is 19 now and will be 24 in 5 years, we subtract 5 from the future ages of his dad and brother to get their current ages.

Emil's dad's current age = 48 - 5 = 43 years old.
Emil's brother's current age = 12 - 5 = 7 years old.

Finally, to find the sum of the ages of Emil's dad and his brother now, we add their current ages together: 43 + 7 = 50.

So, the sum of the ages of Emil's dad and his brother now is 50 years.
