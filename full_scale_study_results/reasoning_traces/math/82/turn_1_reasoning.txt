Question ID: 82
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to find out how much Alex weighs. According to the problem, Alex weighs 2 pounds less than 4 times what Grace weighs. 

Grace weighs 125 pounds, so 4 times her weight would be 4 * 125 = 500 pounds.

Since Alex weighs 2 pounds less than this, we subtract 2 from 500 to get Alex's weight: 500 - 2 = 498 pounds.

Now, to find their combined weight, we add Grace's weight to Alex's weight: 125 + 498 = 623 pounds.

So, the combined weight of Grace and Alex is 623 pounds.
