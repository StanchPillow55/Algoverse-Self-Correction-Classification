Question ID: 82
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to find out how much Alex weighs. According to the problem, Alex weighs 2 pounds less than 4 times what Grace weighs. 

Grace weighs 125 pounds, so 4 times her weight is 4 * 125 = 500 pounds.

Alex weighs 2 pounds less than this, so Alex weighs 500 - 2 = 498 pounds.

To find their combined weight, we add Grace's weight to Alex's weight. 

So, 125 pounds (Grace's weight) + 498 pounds (Alex's weight) = 623 pounds.

Therefore, their combined weight is 623 pounds.
