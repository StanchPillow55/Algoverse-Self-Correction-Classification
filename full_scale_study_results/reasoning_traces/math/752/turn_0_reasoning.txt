Question ID: 752
Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to find out how much the total electricity bill is for a year. Since the bill is $100 per month, we multiply this by 12 (the number of months in a year) to get the total annual cost.

$100/month * 12 months/year = $1200/year

Next, we need to divide this total cost by the number of roommates to find out how much each person pays. Jenna has 4 roommates, but we also need to include Jenna in the calculation because she also pays a share of the bill. So, the total number of people sharing the bill is 5.

$1200/year รท 5 people = $240/person/year

So, each person, including Jenna and her 4 roommates, will pay $240 per year for electricity if they divide the cost equally.
