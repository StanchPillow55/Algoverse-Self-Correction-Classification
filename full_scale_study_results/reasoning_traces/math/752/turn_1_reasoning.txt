Question ID: 752
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to determine how many people are splitting the bill. Jenna has 4 roommates, but we also need to include Jenna herself, so there are 5 people in total.

Next, we need to figure out how much the total electricity bill is for a year. Since the bill is $100 per month, we multiply $100 by 12 (the number of months in a year) to get $1,200.

Now, we need to divide the total yearly bill by the number of people. So, we divide $1,200 by 5. 

Calculation: $1,200 รท 5 = $240

So, each person, including Jenna and her 4 roommates, will pay $240 per year for electricity if they divide the share equally.
