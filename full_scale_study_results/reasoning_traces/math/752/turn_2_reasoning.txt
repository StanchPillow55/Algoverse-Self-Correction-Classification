Question ID: 752
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine how much each of Jenna's roommates will pay for electricity over the course of a year, given that the monthly bill is $100 and the cost is shared equally among all roommates.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Identify the Total Number of People Sharing the Bill:**
   - Jenna has 4 roommates. Including Jenna, there are a total of 5 people sharing the bill.

2. **Determine the Monthly Share for Each Person:**
   - The total monthly electricity bill is $100.
   - Since the bill is shared equally among 5 people, each person's monthly share is calculated as follows:
     \[
     \text{Monthly Share per Person} = \frac{\text{Total Monthly Bill}}{\text{Number of People}} = \frac{100}{5} = 20
     \]
   - Therefore, each person pays $20 per month.

3. **Calculate the Annual Share for Each Person:**
   - There are 12 months in a year. To find out how much each person pays annually, multiply the monthly share by 12:
     \[
     \text{Annual Share per Person} = \text{Monthly Share per Person} \times 12 = 20 \times 12 = 240
     \]
   - Thus, each person pays $240 per year for electricity.

### Conclusion:
Each roommate, including Jenna, will pay $240 per year for electricity. This is based on the assumption that the bill remains constant at $100 per month and is divided equally among all 5 people.

**Final Answer:**
Each roommate will pay $240 per year for electricity.
