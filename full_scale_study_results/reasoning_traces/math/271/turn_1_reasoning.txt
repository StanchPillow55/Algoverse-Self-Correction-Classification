==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of windows in both of John's houses by considering the windows in the bedrooms and the additional windows in each house.

### Step-by-Step Calculation:

1. **Determine the number of bedrooms in each house:**
   - Each house has 3 bedrooms.

2. **Calculate the number of windows in the bedrooms for one house:**
   - Each bedroom has 2 windows.
   - Therefore, the number of windows in the bedrooms of one house is:
     \[
     3 \text{ bedrooms} \times 2 \text{ windows per bedroom} = 6 \text{ windows}
     \]

3. **Account for the additional windows in one house:**
   - Each house has 4 additional windows not connected to bedrooms.

4. **Calculate the total number of windows in one house:**
   - Add the windows from the bedrooms and the additional windows:
     \[
     6 \text{ windows from bedrooms} + 4 \text{ additional windows} = 10 \text{ windows}
     \]

5. **Calculate the total number of windows for both houses:**
   - Since there are 2 houses, multiply the total number of windows in one house by 2:
     \[
     10 \text{ windows per house} \times 2 \text{ houses} = 20 \text{ windows}
     \]

### Final Answer:
The total number of windows between the two houses is \( \boxed{20} \).
