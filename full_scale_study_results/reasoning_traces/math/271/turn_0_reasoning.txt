Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, let's calculate the total number of windows in the bedrooms. 

John has 2 houses with 3 bedrooms each, so that's 2*3 = 6 bedrooms in total. 

Each bedroom has 2 windows, so the total number of windows in the bedrooms is 6*2 = 12 windows.

Next, let's consider the additional windows in each house. There are 4 additional windows in each house, and John has 2 houses, so that's 4*2 = 8 additional windows.

Finally, to find the total number of windows in both houses, we add the number of bedroom windows to the number of additional windows. That's 12 + 8 = 20 windows.

So, there are 20 windows in total between the two houses.
