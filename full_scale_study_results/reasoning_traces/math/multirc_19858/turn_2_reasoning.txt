Question ID: multirc_19858
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

I apologize, but the answer "Make lots of money" does not seem to be supported by the information provided in the paragraph. The paragraph discusses the goals of geologists, which appear to be:

1. To learn about the Earth's past
2. To use clues from rocks and fossils to make sense of past events
3. To place events in the order they happened
4. To determine how long it took for those events to happen

The paragraph does not mention anything about geologists' goals being to make lots of money. Let me walk through the reasoning step-by-step:

Step 1: Identify the key information provided in the paragraph about the goals of geologists.
The paragraph states that geologists "want to learn about Earth's past" and "use clues from rocks and fossils to make sense of events." It also mentions that their goal is "to place things in the order they happened" and "to know how long it took for those events to happen."

Step 2: Analyze the information to determine the main goals of geologists.
Based on the information provided, the main goals of geologists seem to be:
- Understanding the history and past of the Earth
-
