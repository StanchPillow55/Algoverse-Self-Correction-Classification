==================================================

The goals of geologists, as described in the given paragraph, are not to make lots of money, but rather:

1. To learn about the Earth's past
2. To use clues from rocks and fossils to make sense of past events
3. To place events in the order they happened
4. To know how long it took for those events to happen

Let's go through the paragraph step by step to understand the reasoning behind these goals:

1. The paragraph states that "Earth processes have not changed over time. The way things happen now is the same way things happened in the past." This suggests that geologists study the Earth's past to understand the processes that have been shaping the planet.

2. The paragraph mentions that "Some geologists study the history of the Earth. They want to learn about Earth's past." This directly states that one of the goals of geologists is to learn about the Earth's past.

3. The paragraph further explains that geologists "use clues from rocks and fossils" to "make sense of events." This indicates that they use evidence from the Earth's geological record to understand what happened in the past.

4. The paragraph states that the goal of geologists is "
