==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total revenue generated from the sale of the Viva Glam lipstick and lipglass.

Given information:
- The price of the Viva Glam lipstick is £15.
- The price of the Viva Glam lipglass is £14.

Step 1: Calculate the total revenue from the sale of the Viva Glam lipstick.
Total revenue from lipstick = Price of lipstick × Number of lipsticks sold
Since the problem statement does not provide the number of lipsticks sold, we cannot calculate the total revenue from the lipstick.

Step 2: Calculate the total revenue from the sale of the Viva Glam lipglass.
Total revenue from lipglass = Price of lipglass × Number of lipglasses sold
Since the problem statement does not provide the number of lipglasses sold, we cannot calculate the total revenue from the lipglass.

Step 3: Calculate the total revenue from the sale of both the lipstick and lipglass.
Total revenue = Total revenue from lipstick + Total revenue from lip
