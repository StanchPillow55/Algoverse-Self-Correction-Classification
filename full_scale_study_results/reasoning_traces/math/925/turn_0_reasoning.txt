Question ID: 925
Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to find out how much water Anthony and his father filled the tank with. Since they filled it with half the amount of water in the pool, we calculate:

10000 gallons / 2 = 5000 gallons

So, the tank was filled with 5000 gallons of water.

Next, we need to find out how much water is emptied from the tank each day. We know that the tank is emptied at a rate of 500 gallons per day. So, after 6 days, the total amount of water emptied from the tank would be:

500 gallons/day * 6 days = 3000 gallons

Therefore, after 6 days, 3000 gallons of water would have been emptied from the tank.

To find out how much water will be remaining in the tank after 6 days, we subtract the total amount of water emptied from the tank from the initial amount of water in the tank:

5000 gallons - 3000 gallons = 2000 gallons

So, after 6 days, there will be 2000 gallons of water remaining in the tank.
