Question ID: 925
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to follow a series of logical steps to determine how much water remains in the tank after 6 days. Let's break it down step by step.

### Step 1: Determine the Initial Amount of Water in the Tank

The problem states that Anthony and his father fill a tank with half the amount of water in the pool. The pool contains 10,000 gallons of water.

- **Calculation**: 
  \[
  \text{Water in the tank} = \frac{1}{2} \times 10,000 = 5,000 \text{ gallons}
  \]

So, initially, the tank contains 5,000 gallons of water.

### Step 2: Determine the Rate of Water Usage

The problem states that the tank is emptied at a rate of 500 gallons per day.

### Step 3: Calculate the Total Amount of Water Used in 6 Days

We need to find out how much water is used over a period of 6 days.

- **Calculation**:
  \[
  \text{Water used in 6 days} = 500 \text{ gallons/day} \times 6 \text{ days} = 3,000 \text{ gallons}
  \]

### Step 4: Calculate the Remaining Amount of Water in the Tank

Now, we subtract the total amount of water used from the initial amount of water in the tank to find out how much water remains after 6 days.

- **Calculation**:
  \[
  \text{Remaining water} = 5,000 \text{ gallons} - 3,000 \text{ gallons} = 2,000 \text{ gallons}
  \]

### Final Answer

After 6 days, there will be 2,000 gallons of water remaining in the tank.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{2,000 \text{ gallons}}
\]
