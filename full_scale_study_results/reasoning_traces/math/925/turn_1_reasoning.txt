Question ID: 925
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the amount of water in the tank initially:**

   The pool contains 10,000 gallons of water. Anthony and his father fill a tank with half the amount of water in the pool. Therefore, the amount of water they fill in the tank is:

   \[
   \text{Water in tank initially} = \frac{1}{2} \times 10,000 = 5,000 \text{ gallons}
   \]

2. **Calculate the amount of water used each day:**

   The problem states that the tank is emptied at a rate of 500 gallons per day. 

3. **Calculate the total amount of water used after 6 days:**

   If 500 gallons are used per day, then the total amount of water used after 6 days is:

   \[
   \text{Total water used in 6 days} = 500 \text{ gallons/day} \times 6 \text{ days} = 3,000 \text{ gallons}
   \]

4. **Determine the remaining amount of water in the tank after 6 days:**

   Initially, the tank had 5,000 gallons of water. After using 3,000 gallons over 6 days, the remaining amount of water in the tank is:

   \[
   \text{Remaining water in tank} = 5,000 \text{ gallons} - 3,000 \text{ gallons} = 2,000 \text{ gallons}
   \]

Therefore, after 6 days, there will be 2,000 gallons of water remaining in the tank.

**Final Answer: 2,000 gallons**
