Question ID: 4
Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to find out how many total cups of feed Wendi needs to feed her flock of 20 chickens in a day. Since each chicken needs 3 cups of feed per day, we multiply the number of chickens by the amount of feed each chicken needs:

20 chickens * 3 cups/chicken = 60 cups of feed

Next, we need to find out how many cups of feed Wendi has already given her chickens. We know she gave them 15 cups in the morning and 25 cups in the afternoon, so we add these amounts together:

15 cups + 25 cups = 40 cups of feed

Finally, to find out how many cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day, we subtract the amount of feed she has already given them from the total amount of feed they need:

60 cups - 40 cups = 20 cups of feed

So, Wendi needs to give her chickens 20 cups of feed in the final meal of the day.
