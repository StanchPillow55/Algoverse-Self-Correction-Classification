Question ID: 1148
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we first need to understand what a dozen is. A dozen is a group or set of 12. So, when the problem says that Chatty prepared three dozen eggs, it means she prepared 3 sets of 12 eggs. 

To find out how many eggs that is in total, we multiply the number of dozens (3) by the number of eggs in a dozen (12). 

3 dozens * 12 eggs/dozen = 36 eggs

So, Chatty prepared 36 eggs in total.

The problem then asks us to divide these eggs equally among her four children. To do this, we divide the total number of eggs by the number of children.

36 eggs / 4 children = 9 eggs/child

So, each child will receive 9 eggs.

Therefore, the final answer is: Each child receives 9 eggs.
