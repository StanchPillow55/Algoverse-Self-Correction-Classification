Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to determine the total number of eggs. Since a dozen is equal to 12, three dozen eggs would be 3*12 = 36 eggs.

Next, we divide the total number of eggs by the number of children. So, 36 eggs divided by 4 children equals 9 eggs per child.

Therefore, each child receives 9 eggs.
