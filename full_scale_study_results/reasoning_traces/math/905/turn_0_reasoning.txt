Dataset Type: math
==================================================

Harold sleeps for 10 hours a night. 

He works for 2 hours less than he sleeps, so he works for 10 - 2 = 8 hours a day.

He walks his dog for 1 hour a day.

So, in total, Harold spends 10 (sleeping) + 8 (working) + 1 (dog walking) = 19 hours a day on these activities.

There are 24 hours in a day, so Harold has 24 - 19 = 5 hours of free time left in his day.

So, Harold has 5 hours of free time each day.
