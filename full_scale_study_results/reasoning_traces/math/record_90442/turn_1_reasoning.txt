Question ID: record_90442
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, I will break it down step-by-step:

1. Identify the key information given in the passage:
   - Chelsea defeated Vitesse Arnhem 3-1 in a pre-season friendly
   - Diego Costa was involved in all three Chelsea goals
   - Costa set up Nemanja Matic for Chelsea's third goal

2. Analyze the specific details about the third goal:
   - The passage states that "@placeholder's defence was nowhere to be seen as Costa burst through before laying the ball off to his right for Matic to do the rest."
   - This indicates that Costa made a run through the defense and then passed the ball to Matic, who scored the goal.

3. Determine the missing information:
   - The passage does not explicitly state who "@placeholder" is, referring to the defense that was not present.

4. Provide a concise final answer:
   The passage states that Diego Costa burst through the Vitesse Arnhem defense before setting up Nemanja Matic for Chelsea's third goal in their 3-1 victory.
