Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, I will break it down step-by-step:

1. Identify the key information given in the passage:
   - Chelsea defeated Dutch side Vitesse Arnhem 3-1 in a pre-season friendly.
   - The goals were scored by Mohamed Salah, Cesc Fabregas, and Nemanja Matic.
   - Diego Costa was involved in all three Chelsea goals, providing assists for Salah and Matic.
   - The passage mentions that Costa "burst through before laying the ball off to his right for Matic to do the rest."

2. Analyze the specific statement in the query:

   - This suggests that the defense of the opposing team (Vitesse Arnhem) was not effective in stopping Costa's run and the subsequent pass to Matic for the third goal.

3. Provide the final answer:
   Based on the information given in the passage and the specific statement in the query, the final answer is
