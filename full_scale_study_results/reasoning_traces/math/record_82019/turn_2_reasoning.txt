To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given information and determine the correct answer.

Given information:
- The existing law in Israel provides an exemption for Arabs and ultra-Orthodox Jews from military service.
- Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu stated that the existing situation cannot continue and that the nation's approach to military service must change.
- Netanyahu named a new team to draw up a law that would "share the burden" of military service.

Based on the given information, the correct statement is:
Both ultra-Orthodox Jews and Arab citizens are exempt from military service.

Reasoning:
1. The passage clearly states that the existing law in Israel provides an exemption for Arabs and ultra-Orthodox Jews from military service.
2. The passage also mentions that Prime Minister Netanyahu acknowledged that the existing situation cannot continue and that a new law needs to be drawn up to "share the burden" of military service.
3. This implies that the current exemption for both ultra-Orthodox Jews and Arab citizens is the issue that needs to be addressed.

Therefore, the final answer is:
Both ultra-Orthodox Jews and Arab citizens are exempt from military service.
