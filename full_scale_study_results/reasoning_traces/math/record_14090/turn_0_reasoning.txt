==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to understand the context and the information provided in the passage.

Given information:
- Tiger Woods and Elin Nordegren's divorce was finalized on Monday.
- The couple reached a settlement on July 3.
- The settlement allows for "shared parenting of their two children."
- Both Woods and Nordegren agreed to waive the 20-day delay period offered before a final judgment.

The question is asking us to show the reasoning and work behind the statement that both Woods and Nordegren agreed to waive the 20-day delay period.

Reasoning:
1. In a divorce case, there is typically a 20-day delay period before the final judgment is issued. This delay period allows the parties to review the settlement agreement and make any necessary changes or objections.
2. However, the passage states that both Woods and Nordegren "agreed to waive the 20-day delay period offered in @placeholder before a final judgment."
3. By waiving the 20-day delay period, the couple was able to finalize the divorce on the same day the settlement was reached, which was Monday.
4.
