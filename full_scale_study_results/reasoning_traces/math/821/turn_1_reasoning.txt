Question ID: 821
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to find the total number of cars in the parking lot before the lunch break. Hunter counted 50 cars in the morning and then 20 more cars during the first break. So, we add these two amounts together:

50 cars + 20 cars = 70 cars

So, there were 70 cars in the parking lot before the lunch break.

During the lunch break, Hunter noticed that half of the cars had gone. To find out how many cars were left, we need to divide the total number of cars by 2:

70 cars รท 2 = 35 cars

So, there were 35 cars left in the parking lot during the lunch break.

Therefore, the total number of cars Hunter counted during the lunch break is 35 cars.
