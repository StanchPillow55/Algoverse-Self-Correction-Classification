Question ID: 821
Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

Hunter first counted 50 cars in the morning. During the first break, 20 more cars were added. So, the total number of cars in the parking lot before lunch break is 50 cars + 20 cars = 70 cars.

During the lunch break, half of the cars in the parking lot had gone. This means that half of the 70 cars were still in the parking lot. To find out how many cars were still in the parking lot, we need to divide the total number of cars by 2.

So, 70 cars รท 2 = 35 cars.

Therefore, Hunter counted 35 cars in the parking lot during the lunch break.
