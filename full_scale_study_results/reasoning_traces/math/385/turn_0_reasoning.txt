Question ID: 385
Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

The choir has 52 members, and 50% of them are girls. This means that there are 52 * 0.50 = 26 girls in the choir.

On the day of the performance, half of the girls can't make it because their bus breaks down. This means that there are 26 * 0.50 = 13 girls who can make it to the performance.

The choir's 3 teachers then decide to sing with them. This means that there are 13 girls + 3 teachers = 16 people who sang in the performance.

Therefore, the final answer is that 16 people sang in the performance.
