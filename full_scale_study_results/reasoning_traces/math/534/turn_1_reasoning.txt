Question ID: 534
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine how many seashells each girl brought back from the scavenger hunt. Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the number of boys and girls:**
   - We know there are 20 kids in total, divided equally into two groups: boys and girls.
   - Therefore, the number of boys = number of girls = 20 / 2 = 10.

2. **Calculate the total number of seashells brought by the boys:**
   - Each boy brought back 60 seashells.
   - With 10 boys, the total number of seashells brought by the boys is:
     \[
     \text{Total seashells by boys} = 10 \times 60 = 600
     \]

3. **Determine the total number of seashells brought by the girls:**
   - According to the problem, the girls brought an amount equal to the number of shells brought by the boys plus four times as many seashells as the boys.
   - The number of seashells brought by the girls is:
     \[
     \text{Total seashells by girls} = \text{Total seashells by boys} + 4 \times \text{Total seashells by boys}
     \]
   - Substitute the total seashells by boys:
     \[
     \text{Total seashells by girls} = 600 + 4 \times 600 = 600 + 2400 = 3000
     \]

4. **Calculate the number of seashells brought by each girl:**
   - There are 10 girls, and they collectively brought back 3000 seashells.
   - Therefore, the number of seashells brought by each girl is:
     \[
     \text{Seashells per girl} = \frac{\text{Total seashells by girls}}{\text{Number of girls}} = \frac{3000}{10} = 300
     \]

5. **Final Answer:**
   - Each girl brought back 300 seashells.

Thus, the final answer is that each girl brought back 300 seashells.
