Dataset Type: math
==================================================

The problem states that the kids were divided into two equal groups of girls and boys. This means that there were 20/2 = 10 boys and 10 girls.

The boys brought back 60 shells each. So, the total number of shells brought by the boys is 60 shells/boy * 10 boys = 600 shells.

The girls brought an amount equal to the number of shells brought by the boys plus four times as many seashells as the boys. This means that each girl brought 600 shells + 4*600 shells = 600 shells + 2400 shells = 3000 shells.

However, this is the total number of shells brought by all the girls. To find out how many shells were brought by each girl, we divide the total number of shells by the number of girls. So, each girl brought 3000 shells / 10 girls = 300 shells/girl.

Therefore, each girl brought 300 seashells.
