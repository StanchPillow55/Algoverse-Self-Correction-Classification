==================================================

First, let's find out how many chairs Ophelia has. Since she has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, she must have 20 + 2 = <<20+2=22>>22 chairs.

Next, let's find out how many chairs Jenna has. Since Jenna has 3 times as many chairs as Ophelia, she must have 22 * 3 = <<22*3=66>>66 chairs.

Now, let's find out how many sofas Jenna has. Since she has 2 fewer sofas than chairs, she must have 66 - 2 = <<66-2=64>>64 sofas.

Finally, let's add up all the sofas and chairs to find the total. The total number of sofas and chairs they have is 20 (Ophelia's sofas) + 22 (Ophelia's chairs) + 64 (Jenna's sofas) + 66 (Jenna's chairs) = <<20+22+64+66=172>>172. 

So, Ophelia and Jenna have a total of 172 sofas and chairs.
