==================================================

To determine if the word "neighbour" is used with the same meaning in both sentences, we need to analyze the context and usage of the word in each sentence.

Sentence 1: "My neighbour is very irritable and grumpy at times."
In this sentence, the word "neighbour" is used to refer to a person who lives near the speaker, likely in close proximity, such as next door or on the same street.

Sentence 2: "They're our neighbours across the street."
In this sentence, the word "neighbour" is also used to refer to a person or people who live near the speaker, but in this case, they are specifically described as being "across the street," indicating a slightly more distant relationship than in the first sentence.

Based on the context provided, the word "neighbour" is used with a similar meaning in both sentences, referring to people who live in close proximity to the speaker, even though the exact distance may vary slightly between the two sentences.

Therefore, the answer is:
Yes, the word "neighbour" is used with the same meaning in both sentences.
