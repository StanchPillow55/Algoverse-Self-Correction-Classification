Question ID: 400
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to calculate the total amount of milk John drank. Since one glass of milk is 8 ounces and John drank 2 glasses, he drank 2 * 8 = 16 ounces of milk.

Next, we need to calculate the total calories consumed. Since milk has 3 calories per ounce, and John drank 16 ounces, he consumed 16 * 3 = 48 calories.

So, John consumed 48 calories.
