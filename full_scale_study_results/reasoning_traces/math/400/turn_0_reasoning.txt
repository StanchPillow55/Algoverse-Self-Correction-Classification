Question ID: 400
Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to find out how many ounces of milk John drank. Since one glass of milk is 8 ounces and he drank 2 glasses, we multiply 8 ounces/glass by 2 glasses:

8 ounces/glass * 2 glasses = 16 ounces

Next, we need to find out how many calories are in 16 ounces of milk. Since milk has 3 calories per ounce, we multiply 16 ounces by 3 calories/ounce:

16 ounces * 3 calories/ounce = 48 calories

So, John consumed 48 calories from drinking 2 glasses of milk.
