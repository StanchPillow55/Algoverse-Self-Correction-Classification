Question ID: record_44401
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, I will break it down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Bernard Lacombe, a former French international footballer, made sexist remarks during a radio phone-in.
- Lacombe advised a woman caller named Sonia that her place was in the kitchen rather than talking about football.
- Lacombe said "I don't talk about football with women. It's my character, that's my way. They should look after their pots and pans, that would be better."
- Lacombe has since issued an apology statement on Lyon's website.

Step 1: Identify the key elements of the problem.
The key elements are:
- Lacombe's sexist remarks towards the woman caller
- Lacombe's apology statement

Step 2: Analyze Lacombe's apology statement.
The apology statement reads: "I'm sorry if my remarks yesterday on @placeholder have hurt women and in particular sportswomen and female footballers."

This statement suggests that Lacombe is acknowledging the harm and offense caused by his previous sexist remarks. He is specifically apologizing to women, sportswomen, and female football
