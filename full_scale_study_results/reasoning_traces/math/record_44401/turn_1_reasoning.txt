==================================================

To solve this problem, I will break it down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Bernard Lacombe, a former French international footballer, made sexist remarks during a radio phone-in.
- Lacombe advised a woman caller named Sonia that her place was in the kitchen rather than talking about football.
- Lacombe said "I don't talk about football with women. It's my character, that's my way. They should look after their pots and pans, that would be better."
- Lacombe has since issued an apology statement on Lyon's website.

Step 1: Understand the problem.
The problem is to analyze Lacombe's sexist remarks and his subsequent apology statement.

Step 2: Identify the key elements in the apology statement.
The key elements in the apology statement are:
- "I'm sorry if my remarks yesterday on @placeholder have hurt women and in particular sportswomen and female footballers."
- The statement was published on Lyon's website.

Step 3: Analyze the apology statement.
The apology statement acknowledges that Lacombe's previous remarks were hurtful to women
