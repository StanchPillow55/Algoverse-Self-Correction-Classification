==================================================

First, we need to understand how many seeds a small sunflower has. Since it has 3 dozen seeds and a dozen is equal to 12, we multiply 3 by 12 to find the total number of seeds in a small sunflower.

3 dozen * 12 seeds/dozen = 36 seeds

Next, we need to find out how many seeds a large sunflower has. We know it has 50% more seeds than a small sunflower. To find this, we take the number of seeds in a small sunflower and multiply it by 50% (or 0.5).

36 seeds * 0.5 = 18 seeds

So, a large sunflower has 18 more seeds than a small sunflower. To find the total number of seeds in a large sunflower, we add the number of seeds in a small sunflower to the additional seeds in a large sunflower.

36 seeds + 18 seeds = 54 seeds

Finally, to find the total number of seeds in both sunflowers, we add the number of seeds in a small sunflower to the number of seeds in a large sunflower.

36 seeds + 54 seeds = 90 seeds

So, there are 90 sunflower seeds altogether.
