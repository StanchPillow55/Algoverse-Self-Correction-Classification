==================================================

I apologize, but there does not appear to be a mathematical problem or calculation to solve in the given passage. The passage discusses Silvio Berlusconi's legal issues related to paying for sex with an underage prostitute, Ruby the Heart-stealer. It does not contain any numerical information or a specific math problem to solve.

Without a clear mathematical question or problem statement, I cannot provide a step-by-step solution or final answer. The passage is informative, but does not present a quantitative problem for me to analyze. Please let me know if you have a specific math-related question you would like me to address.
