Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

Unfortunately, there is no math problem or calculation involved in the given passage. The passage is a news article discussing Silvio Berlusconi's conviction for having sex with an underage prostitute, Ruby the Heart-stealer. 

The query provided does not seem to be related to the passage. It appears to be a separate quote attributed to an unnamed person, claiming that if they had 5 million euros, they wouldn't have to ask their in-laws for money to do the shopping.

Since there is no math problem or calculation to solve, I cannot provide any step-by-step work or reasoning. The query does not contain a question that can be answered mathematically based on the information given in the passage.
