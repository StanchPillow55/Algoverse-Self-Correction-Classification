==================================================

I do not have enough information to solve a math problem based on the given passage. The passage discusses a legal case involving Silvio Berlusconi and an underage sex worker named Ruby, but does not contain any numerical data or math-related questions. Without a specific math problem statement, I cannot provide step-by-step reasoning and calculations. I'd be happy to assist you with a math problem if you can provide one with clear instructions and the necessary information to work through it. Please let me know if you have a different question I can try to help with.
