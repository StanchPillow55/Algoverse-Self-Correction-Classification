==================================================

First, we need to find out how much each pack of bacon costs. Since 5 packs of bacon cost $10 in total, each pack of bacon costs $10/5 = $2.

Next, we know that each packet of chicken costs twice as much as a pack of bacon. Therefore, each packet of chicken costs 2 * $2 = $4.

Since Kelly has 6 packets of chicken, the total cost of the chicken is 6 * $4 = $24.

The total cost of the strawberries is 3 packs * $4 per pack = $12.

Each pack of apples is priced at half the price of a pack of strawberries, so each pack of apples costs $4/2 = $2.

The total cost of the apples is 7 packs * $2 per pack = $14.

Now we can add up the cost of all the items to find out how much Kelly has spent: $10 (bacon) + $24 (chicken) + $12 (strawberries) + $14 (apples) = $60.

Finally, we subtract the total cost of the groceries from Kelly's budget to find out how much money she has left: $65 (budget) - $60 (spent) = $5.

So, Kelly has $5 left in her budget.
