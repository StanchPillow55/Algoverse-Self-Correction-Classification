Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, let's figure out how many yogurts Terry eats in 30 days. Since he eats 2 yogurts a day, we multiply 2 by 30:

2 yogurts/day * 30 days = 60 yogurts

Next, we need to figure out how many sets of 4 yogurts Terry needs to buy to have 60 yogurts. We divide 60 by 4:

60 yogurts / 4 yogurts/set = 15 sets

Now we need to calculate how much 15 sets of yogurts cost. Since each set costs $5.00, we multiply 15 by 5:

15 sets * $5.00/set = $75.00

So, Terry spends $75.00 on yogurt over 30 days.
