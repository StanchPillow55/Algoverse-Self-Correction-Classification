Question ID: 1307
Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to figure out how many screws are needed for each table. Since each table has 4 legs and each leg needs 2 screws, we multiply 4 (legs) by 2 (screws) to get 8 screws per table.

Next, we need to figure out how many screws are needed for all 4 tables. We multiply 8 (screws per table) by 4 (tables) to get 32 screws needed in total.

Finally, we subtract the total number of screws needed from the number of screws James has. He has 40 screws, so we subtract 32 (screws needed) from 40 (screws he has) to find out how many screws he will have left over.

So, 40 (screws he has) - 32 (screws needed) = 8 screws left over.

Therefore, James will have 8 screws left over after putting together the 4 tables.
