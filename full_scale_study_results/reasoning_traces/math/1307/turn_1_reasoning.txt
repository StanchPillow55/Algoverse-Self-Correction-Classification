Question ID: 1307
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we first need to calculate the total number of screws James needs to put together all the tables. 

Each table has 4 legs and each leg needs 2 screws. So, for one table, James needs 4 legs * 2 screws = 8 screws.

Since James is putting together 4 tables, he will need 4 tables * 8 screws = 32 screws in total.

James has 40 screws. If he uses 32 screws to put together the tables, he will have 40 screws - 32 screws = 8 screws left over.

So, James will have 8 screws left over.
