==================================================

Let's denote the number of vacuum cleaners Melanie started with as X.

According to the problem, Melanie sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house. This means she was left with 2/3*X vacuum cleaners.

Then, she sold 2 more vacuum cleaners at the red house. So, she was left with 2/3*X - 2 vacuum cleaners.

After that, she sold half of what was left at the orange house. This means she was left with (2/3*X - 2)/2 vacuum cleaners.

The problem states that Melanie has 5 vacuum cleaners left. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

(2/3*X - 2)/2 = 5

To solve this equation, we first multiply both sides by 2 to get rid of the fraction:

2/3*X - 2 = 10

Next, we add 2 to both sides:

2/3*X = 12

Finally, we multiply both sides by 3/2 to solve for X:

X = 12 * 3/2 = 18

So, Melanie started with 18 vacuum cleaners.
