==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total profit made from selling the lollipops. Profit is calculated as the difference between the total revenue from sales and the total cost of purchasing the lollipops.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Calculate the Total Number of Lollipops Sold:**

   Each student sold an average of 10 lollipops, and there are 30 students in the class. Therefore, the total number of lollipops sold is:

   \[
   \text{Total lollipops sold} = 30 \times 10 = 300
   \]

2. **Calculate the Total Revenue from Selling Lollipops:**

   Each lollipop is sold for $0.8. Therefore, the total revenue from selling 300 lollipops is:

   \[
   \text{Total revenue} = 300 \times 0.8 = 240 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Calculate the Total Cost of Purchasing Lollipops:**

   Each lollipop is bought for $0.5. Therefore, the total cost of purchasing 300 lollipops is:

   \[
   \text{Total cost} = 300 \times 0.5 = 150 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Calculate the Total Profit:**

   Profit is the total revenue minus the total cost. Therefore, the total profit is:

   \[
   \text{Total profit} = \text{Total revenue} - \text{Total cost} = 240 - 150 = 90 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Thus, the class was able to raise **$90** from the profit of selling lollipops.

**Final Answer: $90**
