Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to calculate the total number of lollipops sold. Since each student sold 10 lollipops and there are 30 students, the total number of lollipops sold is 10 * 30 = 300 lollipops.

Next, we calculate the total revenue from selling the lollipops. Since each lollipop was sold for $0.8, the total revenue is 300 * $0.8 = $240.

Then, we calculate the total cost of the lollipops. Since each lollipop was bought for $0.5, the total cost is 300 * $0.5 = $150.

Finally, we calculate the profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue. So, the profit is $240 - $150 = $90.

Therefore, the class was able to raise $90 from the profit of selling lollipops.
