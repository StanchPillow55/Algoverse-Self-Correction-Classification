==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total profit made by the class from selling lollipops. We'll break down the problem into several steps:

1. **Calculate the Total Number of Lollipops Sold:**

   Each student sold an average of 10 lollipops, and there are 30 students in the class. Therefore, the total number of lollipops sold is:

   \[
   \text{Total lollipops sold} = 30 \text{ students} \times 10 \text{ lollipops/student} = 300 \text{ lollipops}
   \]

2. **Calculate the Total Revenue from Selling Lollipops:**

   The selling price of each lollipop is $0.8. Therefore, the total revenue from selling all the lollipops is:

   \[
   \text{Total revenue} = 300 \text{ lollipops} \times 0.8 \text{ dollars/lollipop} = 240 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Calculate the Total Cost of Buying Lollipops:**

   The cost price of each lollipop is $0.5. Therefore, the total cost of buying all the lollipops is:

   \[
   \text{Total cost} = 300 \text{ lollipops} \times 0.5 \text{ dollars/lollipop} = 150 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Calculate the Total Profit:**

   Profit is calculated as the total revenue minus the total cost. Therefore, the total profit is:

   \[
   \text{Total profit} = \text{Total revenue} - \text{Total cost} = 240 \text{ dollars} - 150 \text{ dollars} = 90 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Thus, the class was able to raise a total of $90 from the profit of selling lollipops.

**Final Answer:**

The class raised $90 from the profit of selling lollipops.
