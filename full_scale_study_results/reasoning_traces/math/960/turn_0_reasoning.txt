Dataset Type: math
==================================================

The pirates dug ten holes on the first day, thirteen on the second day, and eight on the third day. However, they filled in two holes on the third day. So, the total number of holes at the end of the third day is:

10 (first day) + 13 (second day) + 8 (third day) - 2 (filled in) = 29 holes.

The problem states that by the fourth day, the island had four times as many holes as it did at the end of the first day. Since they dug ten holes on the first day, four times this amount is 40 holes.

Therefore, the number of holes they dug on the fourth day before finding the treasure is:

40 (total holes on the fourth day) - 29 (total holes at the end of the third day) = 11 holes.

So, the pirates dug 11 holes on the fourth day before finding the treasure.
