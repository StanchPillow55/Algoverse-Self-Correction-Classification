First, let's calculate the commission Cayley gets from selling the New York Times. 

The cost of each copy of the New York Times is $5, and Cayley gets a 10% commission on each copy sold. 

So, the commission from each copy of the New York Times is $5 * 10% = $0.50.

Since Cayley sold 6 copies of the New York Times, the total commission from the New York Times is $0.50 * 6 = $3.

Next, let's calculate the commission Cayley gets from selling the Wall Street Journal. 

The cost of each copy of the Wall Street Journal is $15, and Cayley gets an 8% commission on each copy sold. 

So, the commission from each copy of the Wall Street Journal is $15 * 8% = $1.20.

Since Cayley sold 10 copies of the Wall Street Journal, the total commission from the Wall Street Journal is $1.20 * 10 = $12.

Finally, to find the total commission Cayley earned from selling both newspapers, we add the commission from the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal together.

So, the total commission is $3 + $12 = $15.

Therefore, Cayley will earn a total commission of $15 from the sales of 6 copies of the New York Times and 10 copies of the Wall Street Journal.
