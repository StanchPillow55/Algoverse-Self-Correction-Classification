==================================================

Let's solve this problem step by step.

First, we know that the first friend pressed the doorbell 20 times.

Second, the problem states that the second friend pressed the doorbell 1/4 times more than the first friend. To find out how many times the second friend pressed the doorbell, we need to calculate 1/4 of 20 (which is 5) and then add this to the original 20. So, the second friend pressed the doorbell 20 + 5 = 25 times.

Third, we know that the fourth friend pressed the doorbell 60 times.

The problem also states that the third friend pressed the doorbell 10 times more than the fourth friend. So, the third friend pressed the doorbell 60 + 10 = 70 times.

Now, to find out how many times the doorbell was pressed in total, we need to add up all these numbers. 

So, the total number of doorbell rings is 20 (from the first friend) + 25 (from the second friend) + 70 (from the third friend) + 60 (from the fourth friend) = 175 times.

Therefore, the doorbell rang 175 times.
