==================================================

Let's solve this problem step by step.

Step 1: Determine Martha's age
According to the problem, Martha is 4 years younger than Mike. Since Mike is 24 years old, we subtract 4 from 24 to find Martha's age.

24 - 4 = 20

So, Martha is 20 years old.

Step 2: Determine Jeff's age
The problem states that Jeff is 10 years older than Martha. Since Martha is 20 years old, we add 10 to 20 to find Jeff's age.

20 + 10 = 30

So, Jeff is 30 years old.

Therefore, Jeff is 30 years old.
