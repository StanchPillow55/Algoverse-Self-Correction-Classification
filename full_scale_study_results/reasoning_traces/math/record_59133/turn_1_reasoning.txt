Question ID: record_59133
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, I need to determine the missing placeholder in the query based on the information provided in the passage.

Given information:
- The passage is about Croatia playing against Brazil in the opening match of the 2014 World Cup.
- Nikica Jelavic, a Croatian striker, is confident that Croatia has the quality players to qualify and pull off surprises at the World Cup.

The query states that Jelavic believes "@placeholder have the players to pull off surprises at the World Cup."

Based on the information in the passage, the missing placeholder is "Croatia". The passage mentions that Jelavic is a Croatian striker and that he believes Croatia has the quality players to qualify and pull off surprises at the World Cup.

Therefore, the complete answer is:

Band of brothers: The striker believes Croatia have the players to pull off surprises at the World Cup.
