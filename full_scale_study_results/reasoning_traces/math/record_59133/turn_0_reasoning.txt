Question ID: record_59133
Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, I need to determine the missing placeholder in the query based on the information provided in the passage.

The passage mentions that Croatia will play against hosts Brazil in the opening match of the 2014 World Cup. It also states that Nikica Jelavic, a Croatian striker, believes his team has the quality players to qualify and that they have nothing to lose against the tournament favorites, Brazil.

The query asks about Jelavic's belief that his "band of brothers" (the Croatian team) have the players to pull off surprises at the World Cup.

Therefore, the missing placeholder in the query is "Croatia", as Jelavic is referring to the Croatian national team as the "band of brothers" that can pull off surprises at the World Cup.

Final answer: Croatia
