Question ID: record_59133
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, I need to determine the missing placeholder in the query based on the information provided in the passage.

Given information:
- The passage discusses the Croatian national team and their opening match against Brazil in the 2014 World Cup.
- The passage mentions that Nikica Jelavic, a Croatian striker, believes his team has the quality to qualify and that they have "nothing to lose" against the tournament favorites, Brazil.
- The query asks about Jelavic's belief that the Croatian team, referred to as "@placeholder", have the players to pull off surprises at the World Cup.

Based on the context, the missing placeholder is likely referring to the Croatian national team.

Therefore, the final answer is:

Croatia
