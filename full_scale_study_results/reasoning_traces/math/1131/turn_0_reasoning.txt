==================================================

First, we need to determine how much of the tree John can use to make logs. We know he can use 80% of the 80-foot tree, so we multiply 80 by 0.8 (which is the decimal equivalent of 80%) to find out.

80 * 0.8 = 64 feet

So, John can use 64 feet of the tree to make logs.

Next, we need to figure out how many 4-foot logs he can make from the 64 feet. We do this by dividing 64 by 4.

64 / 4 = 16 logs

So, John can make 16 logs from the tree.

Then, we need to calculate how many planks he can make from those logs. We know he can make 5 planks from each log, so we multiply the number of logs (16) by 5.

16 * 5 = 80 planks

So, John can make 80 planks from the tree.

Finally, we need to calculate how much money John makes from selling the planks. We know he sells each plank for $1.2, so we multiply the number of planks (80) by $1.2.

80 * $1.2 = $96

So, John makes $96 from selling the planks.

Therefore, the final answer is $96.
