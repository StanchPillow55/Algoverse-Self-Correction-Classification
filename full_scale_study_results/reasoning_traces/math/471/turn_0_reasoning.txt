Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

Step 1: Calculate the total number of pencils at the start of the year.
The total number of pencils at the start of the year is 30 students * 10 pencils/student = 300 pencils.

Step 2: Calculate the number of pencils used after two months.
After two months, 1/5 of the total pencils were used, which is 1/5 * 300 pencils = 60 pencils.

Step 3: Calculate the number of pencils left after two months.
The number of pencils left after two months is 300 pencils - 60 pencils = 240 pencils.

Step 4: Calculate the number of pencils left at the end of the year.
At the end of the year, only 1/3 of the remaining pencils were left, which is 1/3 * 240 pencils = 80 pencils.

So, there were 80 pencils left at the end of the year.
