==================================================

To solve the problem, we will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of pencils at the beginning of the year.**
2. **Determine how many pencils were used after two months.**
3. **Calculate the remaining pencils after two months.**
4. **Determine how many pencils were left at the end of the year.**

### Step 1: Calculate the total number of pencils at the beginning of the year.

Each student started with 10 pencils, and there are 30 students in the class.

\[
\text{Total pencils} = \text{Number of students} \times \text{Pencils per student} = 30 \times 10 = 300 \text{ pencils}
\]

### Step 2: Determine how many pencils were used after two months.

According to the problem, \( \frac{1}{5} \) of the total pencils were used after two months.

\[
\text{Pencils used} = \frac{1}{5} \times \text{Total pencils} = \frac{1}{5} \times 300 = 60 \text{ pencils}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the remaining pencils after two months.

To find the remaining pencils after two months, we subtract the number of pencils used from the total number of pencils.

\[
\text{Remaining pencils after two months} = \text{Total pencils} - \text{Pencils used} = 300 - 60 = 240 \text{ pencils}
\]

### Step 4: Determine how many pencils were left at the end of the year.

At the end of the year, only \( \frac{1}{3} \) of the remaining pencils were left.

\[
\text{Pencils left at the end of the year} = \frac{1}{3} \times \text{Remaining pencils after two months} = \frac{1}{3} \times 240 = 80 \text{ pencils}
\]

### Final Answer

Thus, the number of pencils left at the end of the year is:

\[
\boxed{80}
\]
