==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given passage and determine the relationship between Iran developing nuclear weapons and the potential for an arms race among its regional rivals.

Given information:
- The passage discusses the risks and potential benefits for Israel if it decides to attack Iran's nuclear program.
- One of the risks mentioned is that an Israeli attack on Iran could lead to "international isolation, retaliation at home and abroad, and steep economic costs."
- However, the passage also suggests that a successful raid could "set back Iran's uranium enrichment effort by several years."
- The query asks about the argument that if Iran develops nuclear weapons, it would trigger an arms race among its rivals for regional influence.

Reasoning:
1. The passage does not explicitly state that Iran has already developed nuclear weapons. It only mentions that Israel sees Iran's nuclear program as a threat to its survival.
2. The passage suggests that if Iran were to develop nuclear weapons, it could trigger a regional arms race among its rivals.
3. The rationale behind this argument is that if Iran acquires nuclear weapons, its regional rivals (such as Israel, Saudi Arabia, or other Middle Eastern countries) may feel the need to develop or acquire their own
