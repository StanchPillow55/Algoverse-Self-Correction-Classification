To solve this problem, we need to analyze the potential impact of Iran developing nuclear weapons on the regional arms race.

Given information:
- Israeli authorities argue that if Iran develops nuclear weapons, it would trigger an arms race among Iran's rivals for regional influence.

Step 1: Understand the potential impact of Iran developing nuclear weapons.
If Iran develops nuclear weapons, it would significantly increase its military power and influence in the region. This could lead to a few potential outcomes:
1. Iran's rivals (such as Saudi Arabia, Turkey, or other Middle Eastern countries) may feel threatened by Iran's nuclear capabilities and seek to develop their own nuclear weapons to counter Iran's power.
2. Iran's rivals may invest heavily in conventional military capabilities (such as advanced aircraft, missiles, and other weapons) to offset Iran's nuclear advantage.
3. The balance of power in the region could shift, with Iran becoming the dominant military power, leading to increased tensions and potential conflicts with its neighbors.

Step 2: Analyze the potential for an arms race.
If Iran's rivals feel threatened by Iran's nuclear capabilities, they may engage in an arms race to maintain their regional influence and security. This could involve:
1. Increased military
