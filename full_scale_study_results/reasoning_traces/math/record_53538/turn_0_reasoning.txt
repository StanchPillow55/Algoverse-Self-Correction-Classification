To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given passage and determine the appropriate placeholder for the missing word in the query.

The passage discusses the risks and potential benefits that Israel faces if it decides to attack Iran's nuclear program. One of the key points mentioned is that a successful raid could set back Iran's uranium enrichment effort by several years.

The query states that Israeli authorities argue that if Iran develops nuclear weapons, it would trigger a @placeholder arms race among Iran's rivals for regional influence.

Based on the information provided in the passage, the appropriate placeholder for the missing word is "regional". This is because the passage suggests that the development of nuclear weapons by Iran would lead to an arms race among its rivals in the region, as they seek to counter Iran's growing influence and power.

The complete reasoning and work is as follows:

1. The passage discusses the risks and potential benefits that Israel faces if it decides to attack Iran's nuclear program.
2. One of the key points mentioned is that a successful raid could set back Iran's uranium enrichment effort by several years.
3. The query states that Israeli authorities argue that if Iran develops nuclear weapons, it would trigger a @placeholder arms race among Iran's rivals for regional influence.
