==================================================

To solve this problem, I need to fill in the missing information in the given statement.

The passage mentions that the hot air balloons included "a variety of colours and recognisable shapes such as Mickey Mouse, SpongeBob SquarePants and a killer whale."

Based on this information, the missing character in the statement is:

@placeholder = SpongeBob SquarePants

The reasoning is as follows:
1. The passage lists three recognizable shapes of hot air balloons: Mickey Mouse, SpongeBob SquarePants, and a killer whale.
2. The statement asks to fill in the missing recognizable character, and the only one mentioned in the passage that fits this is SpongeBob SquarePants.
3. Therefore, the missing character in the statement is SpongeBob SquarePants.

Final answer:
SpongeBob SquarePants was among the recognisable characters in the sky.
