Question ID: record_70557
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to analyze the information provided in the passage and use it to determine the difficulty for any sports star to challenge Cristiano Ronaldo's social media supremacy.

Given information:
- Cristiano Ronaldo has over 100 million Facebook fans.
- He is adding fans at the rate of nearly one every second, or 54 per minute on average.
- The next best tally is not an individual but a club, FC Barcelona, which has over 76 million 'likes'.
- Ronaldo also has over 30 million followers on Twitter.

Step 1: Determine the rate at which Ronaldo is gaining new Facebook fans.
Ronaldo is gaining fans at the rate of nearly one every second, or 54 per minute on average.

Step 2: Calculate the time it would take for another sports star to catch up to Ronaldo's Facebook followers.
Assuming the other sports star can gain fans at the same rate as Ronaldo (1 per second), it would take them:
100 million fans / 1 fan per second = 100 million seconds
100 million seconds = approximately
