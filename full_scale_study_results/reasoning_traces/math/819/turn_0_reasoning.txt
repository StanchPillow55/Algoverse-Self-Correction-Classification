Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to find out how much money the students raised in total. We know that the total amount raised was $175,000 and that $50,000 of this came from organizations. So, we subtract the amount that came from organizations from the total amount raised to find out how much the students raised.

$175,000 - $50,000 = $125,000

So, the students raised a total of $125,000.

We know that there are 20 students and they all raised the same amount. So, to find out how much each student raised, we divide the total amount raised by the students by the number of students.

$125,000 รท 20 = $6,250

So, each student raised $6,250 for the charity.
