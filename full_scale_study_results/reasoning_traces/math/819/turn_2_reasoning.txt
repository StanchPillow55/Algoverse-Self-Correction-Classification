Question ID: 819
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to find out how much money was raised by the students. We know that the total amount raised was $175,000 and that $50,000 came from organizations. Therefore, the amount raised by the students is the total amount minus the amount from organizations. 

So, we calculate:

$175,000 (total amount) - $50,000 (amount from organizations) = $125,000 (amount raised by students)

Next, we need to find out how much each student raised. We know that there are 20 students and they all raised the same amount. Therefore, the amount each student raised is the total amount raised by the students divided by the number of students.

So, we calculate:

$125,000 (amount raised by students) รท 20 (number of students) = $6,250

Therefore, each student raised $6,250.
