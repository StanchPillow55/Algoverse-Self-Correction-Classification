Question ID: 819
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to find out how much money the students raised in total. We know that the total amount raised was $175,000 and that $50,000 came from organizations. Therefore, the amount raised by the students is the total amount minus the amount from organizations.

So, $175,000 - $50,000 = $125,000 was raised by the students.

Next, we need to find out how much each student raised. We know that there are 20 students and they all raised the same amount. Therefore, we can find the amount each student raised by dividing the total amount raised by the students by the number of students.

So, $125,000 รท 20 = $6,250.

Therefore, each student raised $6,250.
