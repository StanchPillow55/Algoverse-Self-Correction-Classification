Dataset Type: math
==================================================

Let's denote the number of blue jelly beans as B, the number of red jelly beans as R, and the number of green jelly beans as G. 

According to the problem, we know that:

R = B - 0.01B = 0.99B
G = B + 0.01B = 1.01B

The total number of jelly beans is 4500, so we can write the equation:

R + B + G = 4500

Substituting the expressions for R and G from above, we get:

0.99B + B + 1.01B = 4500
3.01B = 4500

Solving for B, we get:

B = 4500 / 3.01 ≈ 1495

Substituting B back into the equations for R and G, we get:

R = 0.99 * 1495 ≈ 1480
G = 1.01 * 1495 ≈ 1510

The difference between the number of green and red jelly beans is:

1510 - 1480 = 30

So, the jar contains 30 more green jelly beans than red jelly beans.
