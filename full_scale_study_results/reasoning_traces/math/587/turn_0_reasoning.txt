Let's denote the number of blue jelly beans as B, the number of red jelly beans as R, and the number of green jelly beans as G.

According to the problem, we have the following relationships:

R = B - 0.01B (because there are 1% fewer red jelly beans than blue ones)

G = B + 0.01B (because there are 1% more green jelly beans than blue ones)

We also know that the total number of jelly beans is 4500, so:

R + B + G = 4500

Substituting the expressions for R and G from the first two equations into the total equation, we get:

B - 0.01B + B + B + 0.01B = 4500

Simplifying, we find that 3B = 4500, so B = 4500 / 3 = 1500.

Substituting B = 1500 into the equations for R and G, we find:

R = 1500 - 0.01*1500 = 1485

G = 1500 + 0.01*1500 = 1515

So, the jar contains 1515 green jelly beans and 1485 red jelly beans. Therefore, the jar contains 1515 - 1485 = 30 more green jelly beans than red jelly beans.
