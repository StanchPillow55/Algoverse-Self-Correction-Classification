Let's denote the number of blue jelly beans as B, the number of red jelly beans as R, and the number of green jelly beans as G.

According to the problem, we know that:

1. The total number of jelly beans is 4500, so R + B + G = 4500.
2. The jar contains 1% fewer red jelly beans than blue jelly beans, so R = B - 0.01B = 0.99B.
3. The jar contains 1% more green jelly beans than blue jelly beans, so G = B + 0.01B = 1.01B.

We can substitute R and G from the second and third equations into the first equation to get:

0.99B + B + 1.01B = 4500
3.01B = 4500
B = 4500 / 3.01 ≈ 1495 (rounded to the nearest whole number since we can't have a fraction of a jelly bean)

Then we can substitute B into the second and third equations to find R and G:

R = 0.99 * 1495 ≈ 1480 (rounded to the nearest whole number)
G = 1.01 * 1495 ≈ 1510 (rounded to the nearest whole number)

So, the jar contains approximately 1510 green jelly beans and 1480 red jelly beans. 

Therefore, the jar contains approximately 1510 - 1480 = 30 more green jelly beans than red jelly beans.
