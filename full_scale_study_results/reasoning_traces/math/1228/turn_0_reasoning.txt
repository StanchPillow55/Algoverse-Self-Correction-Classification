Dataset Type: math
==================================================

Let's start by figuring out how many paintings Shelley has. Since Samantha has 12 fewer paintings than Shelley, and we know Samantha has 27 paintings, we can add 12 to Samantha's total to find out how many paintings Shelley has. 

27 (Samantha's paintings) + 12 = 39 paintings

So, Shelley has 39 paintings.

Next, we know that Shelley has 8 more paintings than Kim. So, to find out how many paintings Kim has, we can subtract 8 from Shelley's total.

39 (Shelley's paintings) - 8 = 31 paintings

So, Kim has 31 paintings. 

Therefore, the final answer is: Kim has 31 paintings.
