==================================================

To determine how many bandages the nurses started with on the first day, we need to account for the bandages used and ordered over the three days.

**Day 1:**
- Bandages used: 38
- Bandages ordered: 1 bulk pack = 50 bandages

**Day 2:**
- Bandages used: 10 fewer than Day 1, so \(38 - 10 = 28\)
- Bandages ordered: 0

**Day 3:**
- Bandages used: Half a pack = \( \frac{50}{2} = 25 \)
- Bandages ordered: 2 bulk packs = \(2 \times 50 = 100\) bandages

**End of Day 3:**
- Bandages left: 78

Now, let's calculate the total bandages used and ordered over the three days:

1. **Total Bandages Used:**
   - Day 1: 38
   - Day 2: 28
   - Day 3: 25
   - Total used = \(38 + 28 + 25 = 91\)

2. **Total Bandages Ordered:**
   - Day 1: 50
   - Day 2: 0
   - Day 3: 100
   - Total ordered = \(50 + 0 + 100 = 150\)

Let \(x\) be the number of bandages they started with on the first day. The equation for the total bandages at the end of Day 3 is:

\[
x - \text{Total Used} + \text{Total Ordered} = \text{Bandages Left}
\]

Substitute the known values:

\[
x - 91 + 150 = 78
\]

Simplify and solve for \(x\):

\[
x + 59 = 78
\]

\[
x = 78 - 59
\]

\[
x = 19
\]

Thus, the nurses started with **19 bandages** on the first day.
