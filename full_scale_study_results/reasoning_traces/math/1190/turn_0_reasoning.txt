==================================================

Let's start by calculating the total number of bandages used and ordered over the three days.

On the first day, they used 38 bandages and ordered one bulk pack of 50 bandages. So, they added 50 - 38 = 12 bandages to their stock.

On the second day, they used ten fewer bandages than the first day, which means they used 38 - 10 = 28 bandages. They didn't order any bandages on the second day, so their stock decreased by 28 bandages.

On the third day, they ordered two bulk packs of bandages, which is 2 * 50 = 100 bandages. They only used half a pack, which is 50 / 2 = 25 bandages. So, they added 100 - 25 = 75 bandages to their stock.

So, over the three days, they added 12 + 75 = 87 bandages to their stock and used 28 bandages on the second day. This means their stock increased by 87 - 28 = 59 bandages over the three days.

They had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day, which means they started with 78 - 59 = 19 bandages on the first day. 

So, the nurses' station started with 19 bandages on the first day.
