==================================================

Let's break down the problem:

Suzie bought four packs of gum in total: two packs of strawberry, one pack of grape, and one pack of green apple. 

She paid $2 for the grape gum and half as much for the green apple gum, which means she paid $2/2 = $1 for the green apple gum.

So, the total cost of the grape and green apple gum is $2 (grape) + $1 (green apple) = $3.

The problem states that Suzie paid $7 in total for all the gum. If we subtract the cost of the grape and green apple gum from the total, we can find out how much she paid for the strawberry gum. 

So, $7 (total) - $3 (grape and green apple) = $4 for the strawberry gum.

Since she bought two packs of strawberry gum, we divide the total cost of the strawberry gum by the number of packs to find the cost per pack.

So, $4 (total cost of strawberry gum) / 2 (number of packs) = $2 per pack of strawberry gum.

Therefore, each pack of strawberry gum cost $2.
