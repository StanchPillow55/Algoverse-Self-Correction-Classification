Dataset Type: math
==================================================

Step 1: Add the number of cookies Rachel bought and the number of cookies Janet gave her. 

Rachel bought 23 cookies and Janet gave her 42 cookies. 

23 cookies (from Rachel) + 42 cookies (from Janet) = 65 cookies

So, Rachel had a total of 65 cookies.

Step 2: Subtract the number of cookies her brother ate from the total number of cookies Rachel had.

Her brother ate 44 cookies.

65 cookies (total) - 44 cookies (eaten by brother) = 21 cookies

So, Rachel has 21 cookies left.

Final Answer: Rachel has 21 cookies left.
