Question ID: 760
Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to find out how many people think horse #2 will win. We do this by taking 20% of 50. 

20% of 50 = 0.20 * 50 = 10 people

So, 10 people think horse #2 will win. 

This leaves us with 50 - 10 = 40 people who think either horse #7 or horse #12 will win.

Next, we need to find out how many of these remaining people think horse #7 will win. We do this by taking 60% of 40.

60% of 40 = 0.60 * 40 = 24 people

So, 24 people think horse #7 will win.

This leaves us with 40 - 24 = 16 people who think horse #12 will win.

So, 16 people think that horse #12 will win the big race.
