==================================================

John drinks 4 glasses of water every weekday and 3 glasses of water every weekend day.

There are 5 weekdays in a week and 2 weekend days in a week.

So, during the weekdays, John drinks 5 days * 4 glasses/day = 20 glasses of water.

During the weekends, John drinks 2 days * 3 glasses/day = 6 glasses of water.

Adding these together, John drinks 20 glasses + 6 glasses = 26 glasses of water in a week.

So, John drinks 26 glasses of water in a week.
