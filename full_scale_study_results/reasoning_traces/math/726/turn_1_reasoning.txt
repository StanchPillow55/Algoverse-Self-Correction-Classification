Question ID: 726
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to convert the length of Topher's shoe from feet to inches because the length of Bobby's shoe is given in inches. There are 12 inches in a foot, so 8 feet is 8*12 = 96 inches. Adding the 4 inches, we get a total of 96 + 4 = 100 inches.

The problem states that the length of one of Topher's shoes is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of one of Bobby's shoes. We can write this as an equation: 100 = 9B + 10, where B represents the length of one of Bobby's shoes.

To solve for B, we first subtract 10 from both sides of the equation to get: 90 = 9B. 

Then, we divide both sides of the equation by 9 to get: B = 90/9 = 10 inches.

So, one of Bobby's shoes is 10 inches long.
