Question ID: 726
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to convert the length of Topher's shoe from feet to inches because the length of Bobby's shoe is asked in inches. There are 12 inches in a foot, so 8 feet is 8*12 = 96 inches. Adding the 4 inches, we find that Topher's shoe is 96 + 4 = 100 inches long.

The problem states that the length of one of Topher's shoes is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of one of Bobby's shoes. We can write this as an equation: 100 = 9B + 10, where B is the length of one of Bobby's shoes.

To solve for B, we first subtract 10 from both sides of the equation: 100 - 10 = 9B, which simplifies to 90 = 9B.

Then, we divide both sides of the equation by 9 to solve for B: 90/9 = B, which simplifies to B = 10.

So, one of Bobby's shoes is 10 inches long.
