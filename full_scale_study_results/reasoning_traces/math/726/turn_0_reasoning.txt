==================================================

First, we need to convert the length of Topher's shoe from feet to inches because the length of Bobby's shoe is asked in inches. 

There are 12 inches in a foot, so 8 feet is 8*12 = 96 inches. 

Adding the 4 inches to this gives us the total length of Topher's shoe, which is 96 + 4 = 100 inches.

The problem states that the length of Topher's shoe is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of Bobby's shoe. This can be written as an equation:

100 = 9B + 10

where B is the length of Bobby's shoe. 

To solve for B, we first subtract 10 from both sides of the equation:

100 - 10 = 9B + 10 - 10

90 = 9B

Then, we divide both sides of the equation by 9 to solve for B:

90 / 9 = B

B = 10

So, the length of one of Bobby's shoes is 10 inches.
