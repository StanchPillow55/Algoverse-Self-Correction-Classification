Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, let's calculate the cost of the taffy. The first pound of taffy costs $3. The second pound is half off, so it costs $3/2 = $1.50. So, the total cost of the taffy is $3 + $1.50 = $4.50.

Next, let's add the cost of the seashells. The seashells cost $1.50, so the total cost so far is $4.50 + $1.50 = $6.

Then, let's add the cost of the magnets. Each magnet costs $0.25, and she bought 4 magnets, so the magnets cost $0.25 * 4 = $1. The total cost so far is $6 + $1 = $7.

Finally, let's subtract the total cost from the amount of money Sally started with. She started with $10, and she spent $7, so she has $10 - $7 = $3 left.

So, Sally has $3 left.
