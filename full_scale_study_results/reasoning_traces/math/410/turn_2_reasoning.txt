Question ID: 410
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, let's calculate how much Sally spent on taffy. The taffy was on sale for "Buy 1 pound at $3, get 1 pound 1/2 off." This means that the first pound of taffy cost $3, and the second pound of taffy cost half of that, which is $3/2 = $1.50. So, in total, Sally spent $3 + $1.50 = $4.50 on taffy.

Next, let's calculate how much Sally spent on the mixed bag of seashells. This is straightforward, as the bag cost $1.50.

Finally, let's calculate how much Sally spent on the magnets. Each magnet cost $0.25, and she bought 4 of them, so she spent $0.25 * 4 = $1 on magnets.

To find out how much money Sally has left, we need to subtract the total amount she spent from the amount she started with. She started with $10, and she spent $4.50 on taffy, $1.50 on seashells, and $1 on magnets. So, she spent $4.50 + $1.50 + $1 = $7 in total.

Therefore, Sally has $10 - $7 = $3 left.
