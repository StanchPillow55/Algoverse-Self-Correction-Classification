Question ID: 410
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

Let's break down Sally's purchases:

1. Taffy: The taffy is on sale for "Buy 1 pound at $3, get 1 pound 1/2 off." This means the first pound of taffy costs $3. The second pound is half off, so it costs $3/2 = $1.50. Therefore, the total cost of the taffy is $3 + $1.50 = $4.50.

2. Seashells: The mixed bag of seashells costs $1.50.

3. Magnets: Each magnet costs $0.25, and she bought 4 of them. Therefore, the total cost of the magnets is 4 * $0.25 = $1.

Now, let's add up the total cost of all her purchases: $4.50 (taffy) + $1.50 (seashells) + $1 (magnets) = $7.

Sally started with $10. After her purchases, she has $10 - $7 = $3 left. 

So, Sally has $3 left.
