Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

I apologize, but there does not appear to be a specific math problem stated in the passage provided. The passage describes a situation where the soccer player Ross Barkley nearly missed the bus to England's training session in Rio de Janeiro. It does not contain any numerical information or a math-related question.

Without a clear math problem to solve, I cannot provide step-by-step reasoning and calculations. The passage is a news article describing an event, not a math word problem. If you have a specific math question you would like me to solve, please provide it, and I will be happy to work through the problem and show my complete reasoning and work.
