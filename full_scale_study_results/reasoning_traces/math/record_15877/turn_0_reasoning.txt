==================================================

Unfortunately, the passage provided does not contain any numerical information or math-related details that would allow me to solve a math problem. The passage is a news article about a soccer player, Ross Barkley, nearly missing the bus to a training session during the World Cup. There are no specific numbers, calculations, or math-related questions mentioned in the text.

Without any quantitative information or a clear math-related question, I am unable to provide a step-by-step solution or final answer. The passage is a descriptive news story, not a math problem that requires mathematical reasoning and calculations.

If you have a specific math-related question that can be derived from the information provided in the passage, please restate the question, and I'll be happy to try solving it. Otherwise, I do not have enough mathematical content in the given passage to work through a problem and provide a complete solution.
