Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To answer the question, I will list the three requests that Chief Justice Gerry Alexander proposed, based on the information provided in the paragraph.

1. Approve a $90 surcharge on a court filing fee to help provide legal help for the poor in civil cases.
2. Provide money for five additional Superior Court judgeships and one additional District Court judgeship.
3. Add two Superior Court judges and one District Court judge in Clark County, one Superior Court judge in the joint district that serves Benton and Franklin counties, and one Superior Court judge each in Kittitas and Kitsap counties.

The paragraph states that Chief Justice Gerry Alexander made these requests in his State of the Judiciary address to the Legislature. He argued that the $90 surcharge on the court filing fee is necessary to provide legal help for the poor in civil cases, and that the additional judges are needed to handle the increased caseloads.
