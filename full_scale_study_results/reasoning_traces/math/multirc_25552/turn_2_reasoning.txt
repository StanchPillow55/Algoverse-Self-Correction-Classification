==================================================

To answer this question, I will list the three requests made by Chief Justice Gerry Alexander as mentioned in the paragraph:

1. Approve a $90 surcharge on a court filing fee to help provide legal help for the poor in civil cases.
2. Provide money for five additional Superior Court judgeships and one additional District Court judgeship.
3. Add two Superior Court judges and one District Court judge in Clark County, one Superior Court judge in the joint district that serves Benton and Franklin counties, and one Superior Court judge each in Kittitas and Kitsap counties.

The paragraph clearly states these three requests made by Chief Justice Gerry Alexander in his address to the Legislature.
