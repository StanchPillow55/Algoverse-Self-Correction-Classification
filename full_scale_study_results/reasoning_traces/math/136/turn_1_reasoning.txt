Question ID: 136
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

Step 1: Find out how many unicorns are in the Scottish Highlands.

The problem states that one third of the total number of unicorns are in the Scottish Highlands. To find out how many that is, we need to divide the total number of unicorns by 3.

27 (total unicorns) รท 3 = 9 unicorns

So, there are 9 unicorns in the Scottish Highlands.

Step 2: Find out how many of the Scottish unicorns are female.

The problem states that two thirds of the Scottish unicorns are female. To find out how many that is, we need to multiply the number of Scottish unicorns by 2/3.

9 (Scottish unicorns) ร 2/3 = 6 unicorns

So, there are 6 female unicorns in the Scottish Highlands.

Therefore, the final answer is 6. There are 6 female Scottish unicorns.
