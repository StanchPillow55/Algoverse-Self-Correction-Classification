==================================================

Step 1: Find out how many unicorns are in the Scottish Highlands.

The problem states that one third of the total number of unicorns are in the Scottish Highlands. To find out how many this is, we need to divide the total number of unicorns by 3.

27 unicorns รท 3 = 9 unicorns

So, there are 9 unicorns in the Scottish Highlands.

Step 2: Find out how many of the Scottish unicorns are female.

The problem states that two thirds of the Scottish unicorns are female. To find out how many this is, we need to multiply the number of Scottish unicorns by 2/3.

9 unicorns ร 2/3 = 6 unicorns

So, there are 6 female unicorns in the Scottish Highlands.

Therefore, the final answer is that there are 6 female Scottish unicorns.
