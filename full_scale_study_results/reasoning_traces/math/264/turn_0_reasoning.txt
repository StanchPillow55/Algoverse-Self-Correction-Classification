Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to find out how much money Samantha and Daisy have. 

We know that Samantha has $25 more than Carmen. Since Carmen has $100, we add $25 to Carmen's amount to find out how much Samantha has:

$100 (Carmen's money) + $25 = $125

So, Samantha has $125.

Next, we know that Daisy has $50 more than Samantha. Since Samantha has $125, we add $50 to Samantha's amount to find out how much Daisy has:

$125 (Samantha's money) + $50 = $175

So, Daisy has $175.

Finally, to find out how much all three girls have combined, we add together the amounts of money that each girl has:

$100 (Carmen's money) + $125 (Samantha's money) + $175 (Daisy's money) = $400

So, all three girls have $400 combined.
