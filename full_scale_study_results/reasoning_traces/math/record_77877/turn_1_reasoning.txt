Question ID: record_77877
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to find out when the 1930s were, as the passage mentions that older homes from that time period were replaced by newly-built mansions.

The 1930s refer to the decade from 1930 to 1939. So the passage is indicating that the older homes that were replaced by newly-built mansions in Cobham, Surrey were originally built in the 1930s.

The passage does not provide any other specific information or calculations, so there is no further work or reasoning required to answer the question.

Final answer: The 1930s.
