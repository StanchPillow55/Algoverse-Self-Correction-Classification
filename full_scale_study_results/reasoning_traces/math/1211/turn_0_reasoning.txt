Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to find out how much of the second medicine Saanvi needs for one dosage. Since it's 3 times the amount of the first medicine, we multiply 14 mL by 3. 

14 mL * 3 = 42 mL

So, for one dosage, Saanvi combines 14 mL of the first medicine and 42 mL of the second medicine. To find out the total amount of medicine in one dosage, we add these two amounts together.

14 mL + 42 mL = 56 mL

This means that one dosage contains 56 mL of medicine. To find out how much medicine is in 8 dosages, we multiply the amount in one dosage by 8.

56 mL * 8 = 448 mL

So, there would be 448 mL of medicine in 8 dosages. 

Final Answer: 448 mL.
