==================================================

Sidney ordered 3 less than ten meatball sub sandwiches, which means he ordered 10 - 3 = <<10-3=7>>7 meatball sub sandwiches.

Each meatball sub sandwich contains 4 meatballs, so Sidney initially had 7 * 4 = <<7*4=28>>28 meatballs.

Mark ate 4 of Sidney's meatball sub sandwiches, which means he ate 4 * 4 = <<4*4=16>>16 meatballs.

After Mark ate 4 sandwiches, Sidney had 28 - 16 = <<28-16=12>>12 meatballs left.

Sidney then ordered another three sub sandwiches, which means he added 3 * 4 = <<3*4=12>>12 meatballs.

So, Sidney had 12 + 12 = <<12+12=24>>24 meatballs in the sub sandwiches that remained.

Therefore, the final answer is 24 meatballs.
