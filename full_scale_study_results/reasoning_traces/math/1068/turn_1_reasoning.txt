Question ID: 1068
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine how many meatballs are in the sub sandwiches that remain after all the transactions.

1. **Calculate the initial number of sub sandwiches Sidney ordered:**
   - Sidney ordered 3 less than ten meatball sub sandwiches.
   - Ten sub sandwiches would be 10.
   - Therefore, Sidney ordered \(10 - 3 = 7\) sub sandwiches initially.

2. **Determine how many sub sandwiches Mark ate:**
   - Mark ate 4 of Sidney's sub sandwiches.

3. **Calculate how many sub sandwiches Sidney had left after Mark ate some:**
   - Sidney initially had 7 sub sandwiches.
   - After Mark ate 4, Sidney had \(7 - 4 = 3\) sub sandwiches left.

4. **Sidney ordered additional sub sandwiches:**
   - Sidney ordered another 3 sub sandwiches.

5. **Calculate the total number of sub sandwiches Sidney has now:**
   - After ordering 3 more, Sidney has \(3 + 3 = 6\) sub sandwiches.

6. **Calculate the total number of meatballs in the remaining sub sandwiches:**
   - Each sub sandwich contains 4 meatballs.
   - Therefore, the total number of meatballs in the 6 sub sandwiches is \(6 \times 4 = 24\) meatballs.

Thus, the number of meatballs in the sub sandwiches that remained is \(\boxed{24}\).
