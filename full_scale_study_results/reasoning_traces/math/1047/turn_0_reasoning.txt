Let's denote the number of balls Rory retrieved in the second set as x. 

According to the problem, in the first set, he retrieved four more balls than in the second set. So, the number of balls he retrieved in the first set is x + 4.

In the third set, he retrieved half as many balls as in the second set. So, the number of balls he retrieved in the third set is x/2.

The total number of balls he retrieved in all three sets is 19. Therefore, we can set up the following equation to represent this situation:

x (second set) + x + 4 (first set) + x/2 (third set) = 19

To make the equation easier to solve, we can multiply every term by 2 to get rid of the fraction:

2x (second set) + 2(x + 4) (first set) + x (third set) = 38

This simplifies to:

2x + 2x + 8 + x = 38

Combine like terms:

5x + 8 = 38

Subtract 8 from both sides:

5x = 30

Divide both sides by 5:

x = 6

So, Rory retrieved 6 balls in the second set. 

To find out how many balls he retrieved in the first set, we substitute x = 6 into the expression for the first set:

First set = x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10

So, Rory retrieved 10 balls in the first set.
