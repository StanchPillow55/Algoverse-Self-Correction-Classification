Let's define the number of tennis balls Rory retrieved in each set using variables:

- Let \( x \) be the number of tennis balls retrieved in the second set.
- According to the problem, in the first set, Rory retrieved four more balls than in the second set. Therefore, the number of balls retrieved in the first set can be expressed as \( x + 4 \).
- In the third set, he retrieved half as many balls as in the second set, which can be expressed as \( \frac{x}{2} \).

Now, we can set up an equation based on the total number of tennis balls retrieved across all three sets. The total number of balls retrieved is given as 19. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[
(x + 4) + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19
\]

Now, let's simplify this equation step by step:

1. Combine like terms on the left side:
   - The terms involving \( x \) are \( x + x + \frac{x}{2} \).
   - To combine these, we can express \( x \) as \( \frac{2x}{2} \) to have a common denominator:
   \[
   x + x + \frac{x}{2} = \frac{2x}{2} + \frac{2x}{2} + \frac{x}{2} = \frac{5x}{2}
   \]
   - Therefore, the equation becomes:
   \[
   \frac{5x}{2} + 4 = 19
   \]

2. Next, we isolate \( \frac{5x}{2} \) by subtracting 4 from both sides:
   \[
   \frac{5x}{2} = 19 - 4
   \]
   \[
   \frac{5x}{2} = 15
   \]

3. To eliminate the fraction, multiply both sides by 2:
   \[
   5x = 30
   \]

4. Now, divide both sides by 5 to solve for \( x \):
   \[
   x = 6
   \]

Now that we have \( x = 6 \), we can find the number of tennis balls retrieved in each set:

- Second set: \( x = 6 \)
- First set: \( x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10 \)
- Third set: \( \frac{x}{2} = \frac{6}{2} = 3 \)

Finally, let's verify the total number of balls retrieved:
\[
10 \text{ (first set)} + 6 \text{ (second set)} + 3 \text{ (third set)} = 19
\]

The calculations are correct. Therefore, the number of tennis balls Rory retrieved in the first set of the match is:

\[
\boxed{10}
\]
