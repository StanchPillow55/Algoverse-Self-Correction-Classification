==================================================

Let's define the number of tennis balls Rory retrieved in the second set as \( x \).

According to the problem:
- In the first set, he retrieved four more balls than in the second set, which can be expressed as \( x + 4 \).
- In the third set, he retrieved half as many balls as in the second set, which can be expressed as \( \frac{x}{2} \).

Now, we can set up an equation based on the total number of balls retrieved:

\[
(x + 4) + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19
\]

Next, we will combine the terms on the left side of the equation. First, let's express \( x + 4 \) and \( x \) in terms of a common denominator. The common denominator for \( x \) and \( \frac{x}{2} \) is 2:

\[
x + 4 = \frac{2x + 8}{2}
\]

Now, substituting this back into the equation gives us:

\[
\frac{2x + 8}{2} + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19
\]

To eliminate the fraction, we can multiply the entire equation by 2:

\[
(2x + 8) + 2x + x = 38
\]

Now, combine like terms:

\[
5x + 8 = 38
\]

Next, subtract 8 from both sides:

\[
5x = 30
\]

Now, divide by 5:

\[
x = 6
\]

Now that we have \( x \), we can find the number of balls retrieved in each set:

1. Second set: \( x = 6 \)
2. First set: \( x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10 \)
3. Third set: \( \frac{x}{2} = \frac{6}{2} = 3 \)

Finally, let's verify the total:

\[
10 + 6 + 3 = 19
\]

This confirms our calculations are correct. Therefore, the number of tennis balls Rory retrieved in the first set is:

\[
\boxed{10}
\]
