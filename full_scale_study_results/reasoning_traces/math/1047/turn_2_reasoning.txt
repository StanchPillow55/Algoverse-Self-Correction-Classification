Let's denote the number of tennis balls Rory retrieved in the second set as \( x \).

According to the problem:

1. In the first set, he retrieved four more balls than in the second set. Therefore, the number of balls retrieved in the first set is:
   \[
   x + 4
   \]

2. In the third set, he retrieved half as many balls as in the second set. Therefore, the number of balls retrieved in the third set is:
   \[
   \frac{x}{2}
   \]

3. The total number of balls retrieved across all three sets is 19. We can set up the equation:
   \[
   (x + 4) + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19
   \]

Now, let's simplify this equation step by step:

First, combine the terms on the left side:
\[
x + 4 + x + \frac{x}{2} = 19
\]
This simplifies to:
\[
2x + 4 + \frac{x}{2} = 19
\]

Next, to eliminate the fraction, we can multiply the entire equation by 2:
\[
2(2x + 4) + 2\left(\frac{x}{2}\right) = 2 \cdot 19
\]
This gives us:
\[
4x + 8 + x = 38
\]

Now, combine like terms:
\[
5x + 8 = 38
\]

Next, subtract 8 from both sides:
\[
5x = 30
\]

Now, divide by 5:
\[
x = 6
\]

Now that we have \( x \), we can find the number of balls retrieved in each set:

- Second set: \( x = 6 \)
- First set: \( x + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10 \)
- Third set: \( \frac{x}{2} = \frac{6}{2} = 3 \)

Finally, let's verify the total:
\[
10 + 6 + 3 = 19
\]

This confirms our calculations are correct. 

Thus, the number of tennis balls Rory retrieved in the first set is:
\[
\boxed{10}
\]
