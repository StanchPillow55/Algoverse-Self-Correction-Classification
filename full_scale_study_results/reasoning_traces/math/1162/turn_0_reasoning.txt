Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to find half of Haley's age. Since Haley is 26 years old, half of her age would be 26/2 = 13 years old.

The problem states that Geb is 10 less than half the age of Haley. So, to find Geb's age, we subtract 10 from 13.

So, Geb's age is 13 - 10 = 3 years old.

Therefore, Geb is 3 years old.
