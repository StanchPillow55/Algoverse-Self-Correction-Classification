Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we first need to find half of Haley's age. 

Haley is 26 years old, so half of her age is 26/2 = 13 years.

The problem states that Geb is 10 less than half the age of Haley. So, we subtract 10 from 13.

13 - 10 = 3

So, Geb is 3 years old.

Therefore, the final answer is Geb is 3 years old.
