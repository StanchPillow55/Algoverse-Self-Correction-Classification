Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

Let's solve this problem step by step.

First, we know that Isabel is 7 feet tall. 

Second, we know that Ned is two feet shorter than Isabel. So, we subtract 2 feet from Isabel's height to find Ned's height. 

7 feet - 2 feet = 5 feet

So, Ned is 5 feet tall.

Third, we know that Carl is one foot taller than Ned. So, we add 1 foot to Ned's height to find Carl's height.

5 feet + 1 foot = 6 feet

So, Carl is 6 feet tall.

Finally, we know that Carl's cane is half as long as he is tall. So, we divide Carl's height by 2 to find the length of his cane.

6 feet รท 2 = 3 feet

So, Carl's cane is 3 feet long.

Therefore, the final answer is that Carl's cane is 3 feet long.
