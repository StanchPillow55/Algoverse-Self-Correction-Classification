Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, let's calculate how many eggs are eaten each day.

Three people in the family eat three eggs each day. So, they eat 3 people * 3 eggs/person/day = 9 eggs/day.

The rest of the family, which is 5 people - 3 people = 2 people, eat two eggs each day. So, they eat 2 people * 2 eggs/person/day = 4 eggs/day.

Adding these together, the family eats 9 eggs/day + 4 eggs/day = 13 eggs/day.

Since there are 7 days in a week, the family will eat 13 eggs/day * 7 days/week = 91 eggs/week.

So, the family will consume 91 eggs in a week.
