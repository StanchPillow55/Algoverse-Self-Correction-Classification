==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to find the value of the placeholder in the given statement.

Given information:
- Joe Frazier had a "fantastic left hook" with which he not only knocked @placeholder down but also broke his jaw in the first fight.

Based on the context provided in the passage, the @placeholder refers to Muhammad Ali, Frazier's famous rival.

To find the value of the placeholder, we need to determine which fight is being referred to in the statement.

The passage mentions that Frazier and Ali had a "famous trilogy of fights, of which the first and the last were epic fights." This suggests that the statement is referring to the first fight between Frazier and Ali.

In the first fight, known as the "Fight of the Century," Frazier defeated Ali by unanimous decision. The passage also mentions that Frazier's "fantastic left hook" not only knocked Ali down but also broke his jaw.

Therefore, the value of the placeholder is Muhammad Ali.

Final answer: Muhammad Ali
