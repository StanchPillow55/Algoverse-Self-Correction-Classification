Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to find the value of the placeholder in the given statement.

Given information:
- Joe Frazier had a "fantastic left hook" with which he not only knocked someone down, but also broke their jaw in the first fight.
- The statement mentions that the person Frazier knocked down and broke their jaw was "@placeholder".

To find the value of the placeholder, we need to determine who Frazier fought in the first fight of their famous trilogy.

Based on the passage, the person Frazier fought in the famous trilogy of fights was Muhammad Ali.

Therefore, the value of the placeholder is "Muhammad Ali".

The complete statement with the placeholder filled in is:
"He had a fantastic left hook with which he not only knocked Muhammad Ali down but broke his jaw in the first fight."
