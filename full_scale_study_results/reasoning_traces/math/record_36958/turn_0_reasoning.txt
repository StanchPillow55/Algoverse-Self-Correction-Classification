==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to find the value of the placeholder in the given statement.

Given information:
- Joe Frazier had a "fantastic left hook" with which he not only knocked someone down, but also broke their jaw in the first fight.
- The statement mentions that the person knocked down and having their jaw broken was "@placeholder".

To find the value of the placeholder, we need to determine who Frazier fought in the first fight of their famous trilogy.

Based on the passage, the person Frazier fought in the famous trilogy of fights was Mohammad Ali (also known as Muhammad Ali).

Therefore, the placeholder in the given statement should be replaced with "Mohammad Ali".

The complete statement would be:
"He had a fantastic left hook with which he not only knocked Mohammad Ali down but broke his jaw in the first fight."

This is consistent with the information provided in the passage, which states that Frazier and Ali had a famous trilogy of fights, and that the first and last fights were "epic fights".

Therefore, the final answer is:
Mohammad Ali
