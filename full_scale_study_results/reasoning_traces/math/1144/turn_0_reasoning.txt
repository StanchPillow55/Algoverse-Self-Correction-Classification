==================================================

The ratio of men to women on the bus is 5:9. This means that for every 5 men, there are 9 women. The total ratio is therefore 5 + 9 = 14.

The total number of passengers on the bus is 84. We can divide this total by the total ratio to find out how many people each 'part' of the ratio represents. So, 84 รท 14 = 6. This means that each 'part' of the ratio represents 6 people.

Since the ratio of women is 9, we multiply this by the number of people each 'part' represents to find the total number of women on the bus. So, 9 * 6 = 54. This means that there were originally 54 women on the bus.

If 20 women alight from the bus at the next stop, we subtract this number from the total number of women to find out how many women have remained on the bus. So, 54 - 20 = 34.

Therefore, 34 women have remained on the bus.
