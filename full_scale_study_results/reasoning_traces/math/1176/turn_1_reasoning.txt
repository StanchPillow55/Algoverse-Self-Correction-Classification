==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine how many days the teacher can continue using the piece of chalk before it becomes smaller than 2 inches and needs to be recycled. Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Length of Chalk:**
   - The teacher starts with a 5-inch piece of chalk.

2. **Chalk Used on Monday:**
   - On Monday, the teacher uses 45% of the chalk.
   - Calculate the amount of chalk used on Monday:
     \[
     \text{Chalk used on Monday} = 0.45 \times 5 \text{ inches} = 2.25 \text{ inches}
     \]
   - Calculate the remaining length of chalk after Monday:
     \[
     \text{Remaining chalk} = 5 \text{ inches} - 2.25 \text{ inches} = 2.75 \text{ inches}
     \]

3. **Daily Usage from Tuesday Onwards:**
   - From Tuesday onwards, the teacher uses 20% of the remaining chalk each day.
   - Calculate the daily usage:
     \[
     \text{Daily usage} = 0.20 \times 5 \text{ inches} = 1.0 \text{ inch}
     \]

4. **Determine the Number of Days Before Recycling:**
   - The teacher will continue using the chalk until it is less than 2 inches long.
   - Starting with 2.75 inches, we need to determine how many days it takes to reduce the chalk to less than 2 inches.
   - Each day, the teacher uses 1.0 inch of chalk.
   - Calculate the number of days until the chalk is less than 2 inches:
     - After the first day (Tuesday), the chalk will be:
       \[
       2.75 \text{ inches} - 1.0 \text{ inch} = 1.75 \text{ inches}
       \]
     - Since 1.75 inches is less than 2 inches, the teacher will have to recycle the chalk after Tuesday.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The teacher can use the chalk for 1 more day (Tuesday) before it needs to be recycled.

Therefore, the teacher has 1 day before he has to recycle the piece of chalk.
