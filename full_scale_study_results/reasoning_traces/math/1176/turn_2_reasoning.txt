Question ID: 1176
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine how many days the teacher can continue using the piece of chalk before it becomes smaller than 2 inches and needs to be recycled. Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Length of Chalk:**
   - The teacher starts with a 5-inch piece of chalk.

2. **Chalk Used on Monday:**
   - On Monday, the teacher uses 45% of the chalk.
   - Calculate the amount of chalk used on Monday:
     \[
     \text{Chalk used on Monday} = 0.45 \times 5 \text{ inches} = 2.25 \text{ inches}
     \]
   - Remaining chalk after Monday:
     \[
     \text{Remaining chalk} = 5 \text{ inches} - 2.25 \text{ inches} = 2.75 \text{ inches}
     \]

3. **Daily Usage from Tuesday Onward:**
   - From Tuesday onward, the teacher uses 20% of the original 5-inch piece each day.
   - Calculate the daily usage:
     \[
     \text{Daily usage} = 0.20 \times 5 \text{ inches} = 1 \text{ inch}
     \]

4. **Determine the Number of Days Before Recycling:**
   - The teacher will continue using the chalk until it is less than 2 inches.
   - Starting with 2.75 inches of chalk on Tuesday, we need to determine how many days he can use 1 inch per day before the chalk is less than 2 inches.
   - Set up the inequality to find the number of days \( x \):
     \[
     2.75 - 1x < 2
     \]
   - Solve for \( x \):
     \[
     2.75 - 1x < 2
     \]
     \[
     2.75 - 2 < x
     \]
     \[
     0.75 < x
     \]
   - Since \( x \) must be a whole number (as you can't use a fraction of a day), the teacher can use the chalk for 1 full day before it becomes less than 2 inches.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The teacher can use the chalk for 1 more day after Monday before it needs to be recycled.

**Final Answer:**
The teacher can use the chalk for 1 more day before he has to recycle it.
