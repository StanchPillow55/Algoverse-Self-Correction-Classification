==================================================

Let's start by calculating how much chalk the teacher used on Monday. Since he used 45% of a 5-inch piece, he used 0.45 * 5 = 2.25 inches of chalk.

This means that he has 5 - 2.25 = 2.75 inches of chalk left after Monday.

Now, we need to figure out how many days he can use this remaining chalk if he uses 20% of it each day. However, we need to remember that he can't use the chalk when it's less than 2 inches long. 

So, we need to find out how many days it will take for the chalk to be less than 2 inches long. We can do this by repeatedly subtracting 20% of the current length of the chalk until it's less than 2 inches long.

On the first day after Monday, he will use 20% of 2.75 inches, which is 0.20 * 2.75 = 0.55 inches. This leaves him with 2.75 - 0.55 = 2.2 inches of chalk.

On the second day after Monday, he will use 20% of 2.2 inches, which is 0.20 * 2.2 = 0.44 inches. This leaves him with 2.2 - 0.44 = 1.76 inches of chalk.

At this point, the chalk is less than 2 inches long, so he needs to recycle it. Therefore, the teacher can use the chalk for 2 more days after Monday before he has to recycle it. 

So, the final answer is 2 days.
