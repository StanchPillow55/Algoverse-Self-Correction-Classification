==================================================

First, we need to calculate the cost of the plants for one basket. 

Each basket contains 3 petunias and 2 sweet potato vines. 

The cost of the petunias for one basket is 3 petunias * $3.00/petunia = $9.00. 

The cost of the sweet potato vines for one basket is 2 vines * $2.50/vine = $5.00. 

So, the total cost for one basket is $9.00 (for petunias) + $5.00 (for vines) = $14.00. 

Since Katherine has 5 baskets to fill, the total cost for all the baskets is 5 baskets * $14.00/basket = $70.00. 

So, Katherine will spend $70.00 filling all 5 hanging baskets.
