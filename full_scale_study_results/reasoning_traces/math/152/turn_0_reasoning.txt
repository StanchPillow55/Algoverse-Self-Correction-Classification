==================================================

First, we need to find out how many cookies Carl bought in total. Since each pack has 6 cookies and he bought 10 packs, we multiply 6 cookies/pack * 10 packs = 60 cookies.

Next, we need to find out how much all the cookies cost. Since each cookie costs $0.10, we multiply 60 cookies * $0.10/cookie = $6.00.

Finally, we need to find out how much change Carl receives. Since he paid with a $10 bill and the cookies cost $6.00, we subtract $6.00 from $10.00 to find out how much change he gets. 

So, $10.00 - $6.00 = $4.00.

Therefore, Carl receives $4.00 in change.
