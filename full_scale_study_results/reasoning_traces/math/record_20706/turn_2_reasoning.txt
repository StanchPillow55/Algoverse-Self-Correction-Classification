Question ID: record_20706
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, I need to find the country that is mentioned in the passage as negotiating to send 40 Dutch military police to the crash site.

From the passage, we can see that the country mentioned is the Netherlands. The passage states:

"Netherlands are pressing to send their own police and investigators to the scene. Various negotiations are under way."

It also specifically mentions that the Netherlands is "negotiating with the Ukrainian government to send 40 Dutch military police to search for more bodies."

Therefore, the answer to the query is:

The Netherlands
