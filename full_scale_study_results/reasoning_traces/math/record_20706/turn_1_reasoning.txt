==================================================

To solve this problem, I need to find the name of the country that is mentioned in the passage as negotiating to send 40 Dutch military police to the crash site.

From the passage, we can see that the country mentioned is the Netherlands. The passage states:

"Netherlands are pressing to send their own police and investigators to the scene. Various negotiations are under way."

It also mentions that "Dutch negotiating to have police, experts at crash site by this weekend."

Therefore, the answer to the query is:

The Netherlands
