Question ID: 407
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to determine how many steps Elliott took on his walks to and from school. Since we know that he completed half of his daily goal during these walks, we can calculate this by dividing his total daily goal by 2. 

10,000 steps / 2 = 5,000 steps

Next, we subtract the steps he took on his short walk with his friend from the remaining steps he had left after his walks to and from school. 

5,000 steps - 1,000 steps = 4,000 steps

Finally, we subtract the steps he had left after his jog from the steps he had left after his walk with his friend to find out how many steps he took during his jog. 

4,000 steps - 2,000 steps = 2,000 steps

Therefore, Elliott took 2,000 steps during his jog.
