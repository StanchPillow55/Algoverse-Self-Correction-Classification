Question ID: 407
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, let's figure out how many steps Elliott took on his walks to and from school. Since we know that this was half of his daily goal, we can calculate this by dividing his daily goal by 2. 

10,000 steps / 2 = 5,000 steps

So, Elliott took 5,000 steps on his walks to and from school.

Next, we know that he took another 1,000 steps going for a short walk with his friend. So, to find out how many steps he had taken so far, we add the steps from his walks to and from school and the steps from his short walk with his friend.

5,000 steps + 1,000 steps = 6,000 steps

So, before his jog, Elliott had taken 6,000 steps.

We also know that after his jog, he had 2,000 steps left to take. Since his daily goal is 10,000 steps, we can find out how many steps he had taken after his jog by subtracting the steps he had left from his daily goal.

10,000 steps - 2,000 steps = 8,000 steps

So, after his jog, Elliott had taken 8,000 steps.

Finally, to find out how many steps Elliott took during his jog, we subtract the steps he had taken before his jog from the steps he had taken after his jog.

8,000 steps - 6,000 steps = 2,000 steps

So, Elliott took 2,000 steps during his jog.
