==================================================

The first step is to calculate the total length of the fence. Since it's a rectangle, we know that there are two sides that are 15 feet long and two sides that are 10 feet long. 

So, the total length of the fence is 15 feet + 15 feet + 10 feet + 10 feet = 50 feet.

Next, we know that Robert needs 2 wood slats for every foot of fencing. So, to find out how many slats he needs, we multiply the total length of the fence by the number of slats per foot.

Therefore, the total number of slats needed is 50 feet * 2 slats/foot = 100 slats.

So, Robert will need 100 wooden slats to build his fence.
