Question ID: 432
Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to find out how many dragons Prince Arthur slew. Since he slew three quarters as many dragons as Prince Thaddeus, we multiply 100 (the number of dragons Prince Thaddeus slew) by 3/4:

100 * 3/4 = 75 dragons

Next, we need to find out how many dragons Prince Walter slew. Since he slew twice as many dragons as Prince Arthur, we multiply 75 (the number of dragons Prince Arthur slew) by 2:

75 * 2 = 150 dragons

Finally, we need to find out how many dragons Prince Bruce slew. Since he slew one-fifth as many dragons as Prince Walter, we multiply 150 (the number of dragons Prince Walter slew) by 1/5:

150 * 1/5 = 30 dragons

So, Prince Bruce has slain 30 dragons.
