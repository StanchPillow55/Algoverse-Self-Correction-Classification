Question ID: 517
Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we know that Josh made one-fourth the number of cookies that Suzanne made. Since Suzanne made 36 cookies, we can calculate the number of cookies Josh made by dividing 36 by 4.

36 รท 4 = 9

So, Josh made 9 cookies.

Next, we know that Kelsie made two times more cookies than Josh. We can calculate the number of cookies Kelsie made by multiplying the number of cookies Josh made by 2.

9 ร 2 = 18

So, Kelsie made 18 cookies.

Therefore, the final answer is that Kelsie made 18 cookies.
