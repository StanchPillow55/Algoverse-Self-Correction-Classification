==================================================

Linus buys each mobile device for $20 and sells it for twice the amount of the original price. This means he sells each device for 2 * $20 = $<<2*20=40>>40.

The profit he makes on each device is the selling price minus the cost price. So, the profit on each device is $40 - $20 = $<<40-20=20>>20.

Last Monday, Linus bought 2 devices. So, the profit he made from selling the devices he bought on Monday is 2 * $20 = $<<2*20=40>>40.

Last Tuesday, Linus bought 4 devices. So, the profit he made from selling the devices he bought on Tuesday is 4 * $20 = $<<4*20=80>>80.

The total profit Linus made from selling all the devices he bought last Monday and Tuesday is $40 (Monday's profit) + $80 (Tuesday's profit) = $<<40+80=120>>120.

So, Linus was able to earn a profit of $120 after selling all the mobile devices he bought last Monday and Tuesday.
