Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to calculate the total cost of 4 packs of bagels without the discount. Since each pack costs $10.00, the total cost would be 4 packs * $10.00/pack = $40.00.

Next, we need to calculate the amount of the discount. A 10% discount on $40.00 would be $40.00 * 10/100 = $4.00.

Subtracting the discount from the total cost gives us the final cost of the 4 packs of bagels. So, $40.00 - $4.00 = $36.00.

Since each pack contains 9 bagels, 4 packs would contain 4 packs * 9 bagels/pack = 36 bagels.

Finally, we divide the total cost of the bagels by the number of bagels to find the cost per bagel. So, $36.00 / 36 bagels = $1.00/bagel.

Therefore, after ordering 4 packs and receiving a 10% discount, each bagel will cost Russell $1.00.
