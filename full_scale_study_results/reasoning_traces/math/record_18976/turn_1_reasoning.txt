==================================================

I apologize, but the information provided in the passage does not contain any math problem to solve. The passage is about a stolen 9/11 flag that was returned to its rightful owner, Melissa Ielpi-Brengel, the sister of a firefighter killed on 9/11. The passage does not mention anything about Ielpi-Brengel being offended by an episode of "Princesses: Long Island" or a 9/11 tribute statue of her brother. Without a clear math problem to solve, I cannot provide any step-by-step reasoning or calculations. Please provide a math-related question for me to work on.
