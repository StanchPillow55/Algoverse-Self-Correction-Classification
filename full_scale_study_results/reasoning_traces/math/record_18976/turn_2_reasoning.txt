==================================================

I apologize, but the information provided in the passage does not contain any math problem to solve. The passage is about a stolen 9/11 flag that was returned to its rightful owner, Melissa Ielpi-Brengel, the sister of a firefighter killed on 9/11. There is no mention of any math problem or calculation to be performed. Without a specific math problem to work on, I cannot provide any step-by-step reasoning or calculations. Please provide a math-related question or problem for me to solve.
