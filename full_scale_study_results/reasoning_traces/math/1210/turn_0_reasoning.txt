Question ID: 1210
Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to find out how many balloons Jolene and her friends started with. They filled up 10 packs of balloons, and each pack contains 30 balloons. So, we multiply 10 packs by 30 balloons per pack to find the total number of balloons:

10 packs * 30 balloons/pack = 300 balloons

By the end of the afternoon, there are 12 balloons left. To find out how many balloons they threw, we subtract the number of balloons left from the total number of balloons they started with:

300 balloons - 12 balloons = 288 balloons

So, Jolene and her friends threw 288 balloons.
