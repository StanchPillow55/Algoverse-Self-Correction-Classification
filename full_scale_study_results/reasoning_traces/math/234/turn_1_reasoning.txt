Question ID: 234
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine how many cherry tomato vines Steve needs to grow in order to meet his and his girlfriend's consumption needs. Let's break down the problem step by step:

### Step 1: Determine Daily Consumption

1. **Steve's Consumption**: We know that Steve eats 6 cherry tomatoes per day.

2. **Girlfriend's Consumption**: The problem states that Steve eats twice as much as his girlfriend. Therefore, if Steve eats 6 tomatoes per day, his girlfriend eats half of that amount:
   \[
   \text{Girlfriend's daily consumption} = \frac{6}{2} = 3 \text{ tomatoes per day}
   \]

3. **Total Daily Consumption**: The total number of tomatoes consumed by both Steve and his girlfriend per day is:
   \[
   \text{Total daily consumption} = 6 + 3 = 9 \text{ tomatoes per day}
   \]

### Step 2: Determine Weekly Consumption

Since we know the daily consumption, we can calculate the weekly consumption by multiplying the daily consumption by 7 (the number of days in a week):
\[
\text{Total weekly consumption} = 9 \times 7 = 63 \text{ tomatoes per week}
\]

### Step 3: Determine Production per Vine

According to the problem, each vine produces 3 tomatoes per week.

### Step 4: Calculate the Number of Vines Needed

To find out how many vines are needed to produce 63 tomatoes per week, we divide the total weekly consumption by the production per vine:
\[
\text{Number of vines needed} = \frac{63}{3} = 21
\]

### Conclusion

Steve needs to grow 21 cherry tomato vines to meet the weekly consumption needs of both himself and his girlfriend.

**Final Answer**: Steve needs 21 vines.
