==================================================

First, let's determine how many tomatoes are eaten in total per week. 

Steve eats 6 tomatoes per day, so in a week (7 days), he eats 6 tomatoes/day * 7 days/week = 42 tomatoes/week.

Since Steve eats twice as much as his girlfriend, his girlfriend eats 42 tomatoes/week / 2 = 21 tomatoes/week.

So, in total, they eat 42 tomatoes/week (Steve) + 21 tomatoes/week (girlfriend) = 63 tomatoes/week.

If a vine can produce 3 tomatoes per week, then to produce 63 tomatoes/week, they would need 63 tomatoes/week / 3 tomatoes/vine = 21 vines.

Therefore, Steve needs 21 vines to produce enough tomatoes for both him and his girlfriend.
