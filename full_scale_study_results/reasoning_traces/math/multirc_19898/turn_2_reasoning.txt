Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To answer the question "What are geologists?", we can use the information provided in the given paragraph.

Reasoning and Explanation:
The paragraph states that "Some geologists study the history of the Earth. They want to learn about Earth's past. They use clues from rocks and fossils. They use these clues to make sense of events. The goal is to place things in the order they happened. They also want to know how long it took for those events to happen."

From this, we can conclude that:

1. Geologists are people who study the Earth and its history.
2. They use evidence from rocks and fossils to understand the events and processes that have shaped the Earth over time.
3. Their goal is to determine the order in which events occurred and the timescales involved.

Therefore, the final answer is:

Geologists are people who study the Earth, its history, and the processes that have shaped it over time, using evidence from rocks, fossils, and other geological data.
