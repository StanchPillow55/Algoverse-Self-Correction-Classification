Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to calculate how much each person will pay for their rentals.

Carlos rents a canoe for $30 an hour and he uses it for 3 hours. To find out how much Carlos will pay, we multiply the hourly rate by the number of hours he uses the canoe:

$30/hour * 3 hours = $90

Benji rents a banana boat raft for $18 an hour and he uses it for 5 hours. To find out how much Benji will pay, we multiply the hourly rate by the number of hours he uses the raft:

$18/hour * 5 hours = $90

To find out how much they will pay altogether, we add the amount Carlos will pay to the amount Benji will pay:

$90 (Carlos) + $90 (Benji) = $180

So, Carlos and Benji will pay a total of $180 for their rentals.
