==================================================

The problem tells us that Darrell and Allen's ages are in the ratio of 7:11. This means that for every 7 years of Darrell's age, Allen is 11 years old. 

The problem also tells us that their total age now is 162 years. We can represent this information in an equation, where D represents Darrell's current age and A represents Allen's current age:

D + A = 162

Since we know the ratio of their ages, we can also say that:

D/A = 7/11

We can rearrange this equation to solve for D:

D = 7A/11

Now we can substitute this into the first equation:

7A/11 + A = 162

Multiply through by 11 to clear the fraction:

7A + 11A = 1782

Combine like terms:

18A = 1782

Divide by 18 to solve for A:

A = 1782 / 18 = 99

So, Allen is currently 99 years old. 

The problem asks for Allen's age 10 years from now. To find this, we simply add 10 to his current age:

99 + 10 = 109

So, Allen will be 109 years old 10 years from now. 

Final Answer: Allen will be 109 years old 10 years from now.
