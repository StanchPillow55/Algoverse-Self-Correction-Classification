Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, let's convert all the times to minutes to make the calculations easier. Jon's bike ride of 1 hour and 20 minutes is equivalent to 80 minutes. 

So, Jon's total time for the triathlon is 40 minutes (swim) + 80 minutes (bike) + 50 minutes (run) = 170 minutes.

James finishes the swim 10% faster than Jon. Since Jon took 40 minutes for the swim, James took 40 minutes - 10% of 40 minutes = 40 minutes - 4 minutes = 36 minutes.

James takes 5 minutes longer on the bike than Jon, so his bike time is 80 minutes + 5 minutes = 85 minutes.

We know that Jon won by 10 minutes, so James' total time for the triathlon is 170 minutes (Jon's time) + 10 minutes = 180 minutes.

Now, we can find out how long it took James to do the run. We subtract the time he spent swimming and biking from his total time. That is, 180 minutes (total time) - 36 minutes (swim) - 85 minutes (bike) = 59 minutes.

So, it took James 59 minutes to do the run.
