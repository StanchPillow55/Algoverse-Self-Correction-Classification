Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, I need to find the missing word in the given quote. The quote is:

"We were very overwhelmed because at that time @placeholder was terrified of animals," she said.

Based on the context provided in the passage, the missing word is likely the name of the person who was terrified of animals. The passage mentions that Taxi, the service dog, was rewarded for looking after a seventh-grader named Rachel Benke for four years.

Therefore, the missing word in the quote is "Rachel".

The complete quote with the missing word filled in is:

"We were very overwhelmed because at that time Rachel was terrified of animals," she said.
