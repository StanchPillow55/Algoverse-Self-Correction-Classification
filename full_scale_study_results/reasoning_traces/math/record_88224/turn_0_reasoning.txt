==================================================

To solve this problem, I need to fill in the missing information in the given quote. The placeholder "@placeholder" needs to be replaced with the appropriate name or term from the passage.

Given information:
- The passage mentions a "half-labrador, half-golden retriever service dog" named Taxi Benke.
- The passage states that Taxi was rewarded with a photo in the yearbook for looking after an epileptic seventh-grader named Rachel Benke for four years.

Based on the context, the missing information in the quote is likely the name "Rachel Benke".

The complete quote with the placeholder filled in would be:
"We were very overwhelmed because at that time Rachel was terrified of animals," she said.

This quote suggests that Rachel Benke, the seventh-grader that Taxi Benke was looking after, was initially terrified of animals, but Taxi's presence and care helped her overcome this fear.

Therefore, the final answer is:
"We were very overwhelmed because at that time Rachel was terrified of animals," she said.
