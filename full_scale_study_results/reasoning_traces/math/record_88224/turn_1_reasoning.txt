==================================================

To solve this problem, I need to determine the missing word in the given quote. The passage provides some context about Taxi, the service dog, and his role in caring for Rachel Benke, a seventh-grader with epilepsy. However, the quote itself does not appear in the passage.

Given information:
- The passage mentions that Taxi, the service dog, was rewarded with a spot in the yearbook for looking after Rachel Benke for four years.
- The quote states: "We were very overwhelmed because at that time @placeholder was terrified of animals," she said.

To find the missing word, I will need to analyze the context of the quote and the information provided in the passage.

Reasoning:
The quote suggests that the person speaking (likely Rachel's mother) was initially overwhelmed because at that time, someone or something "was terrified of animals." 

Based on the information in the passage, the most logical missing word is "Rachel". The passage states that Taxi was a service dog who looked after Rachel Benke, an epileptic seventh-grader. Therefore, the complete quote should be:

"We were very overwhelmed because at that time Rachel
