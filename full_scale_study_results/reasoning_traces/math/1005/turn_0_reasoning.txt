Question ID: 1005
Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to find out how many female porcupines there are in the park. We know that the number of female porcupines is 3/5 of the total population. So, we multiply the total population by 3/5:

50 * 3/5 = 30

So, there are 30 female porcupines in the park.

Next, we need to find out how many babies each female porcupine will have in a year. We know that each female porcupine gives birth to 4 babies every month, and there are 12 months in a year. So, we multiply the number of babies per month by the number of months in a year:

4 * 12 = 48

So, each female porcupine will have 48 babies in a year.

Now, we need to find out how many babies all the female porcupines will have in a year. We multiply the number of babies per female porcupine by the number of female porcupines:

48 * 30 = 1440

So, the female porcupines will have 1440 babies in a year.

Finally, we need to find out the total population of porcupines in the park after a year. We add the number of babies to the initial population:

50 + 1440 = 1490

So, there will be 1490 porcupines in the park after a year.
