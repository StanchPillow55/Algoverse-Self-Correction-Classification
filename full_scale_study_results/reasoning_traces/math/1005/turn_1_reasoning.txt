Question ID: 1005
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine the initial number of female porcupines, calculate the number of babies born each month, and then find the total population after a year.

### Step 1: Determine the number of female porcupines

The problem states that the number of female porcupines is \( \frac{3}{5} \) of the total population. The total population is 50 porcupines.

\[
\text{Number of female porcupines} = \frac{3}{5} \times 50 = 30
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the number of babies born each month

Each female porcupine gives birth to 4 babies every month. Therefore, the total number of babies born each month is:

\[
\text{Babies per month} = 30 \times 4 = 120
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the total number of babies born in a year

Since there are 12 months in a year, the total number of babies born in a year is:

\[
\text{Total babies in a year} = 120 \times 12 = 1440
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the total population after a year

The initial population is 50 porcupines. After a year, we add the total number of babies born to this initial population:

\[
\text{Total population after a year} = 50 + 1440 = 1490
\]

### Conclusion

After a year, the total population of porcupines in the park will be 1490.

\[
\boxed{1490}
\]
