Question ID: 767
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine the total cost of oranges required to make 4 liters of juice.

**Step 1: Determine the amount of oranges needed for 4 liters of juice.**

According to the problem, 1 liter of juice requires 5 kilograms of oranges. Therefore, to make 4 liters of juice, Sam would need:

\[ 4 \text{ liters} \times 5 \text{ kilograms/liter} = 20 \text{ kilograms of oranges} \]

**Step 2: Calculate the cost of 20 kilograms of oranges.**

Each kilogram of oranges costs $3. Therefore, the cost for 20 kilograms is:

\[ 20 \text{ kilograms} \times 3 \text{ dollars/kilogram} = 60 \text{ dollars} \]

**Final Answer:**

Sam would have to spend $60 to make 4 liters of juice.
