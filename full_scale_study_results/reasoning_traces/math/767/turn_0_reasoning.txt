==================================================

To solve this problem, we first need to determine how many kilograms of oranges Sam needs to make 4 liters of juice. 

Since 1 liter of juice requires 5 kilograms of oranges, we can multiply the number of liters Sam wants to make by the number of kilograms needed per liter. 

So, 4 liters * 5 kilograms/liter = 20 kilograms of oranges.

Next, we need to determine how much 20 kilograms of oranges would cost. 

Since each kilogram of oranges costs $3, we can multiply the number of kilograms Sam needs by the cost per kilogram. 

So, 20 kilograms * $3/kilogram = $60.

Therefore, Sam would have to spend $60 to make 4 liters of juice.
