Question ID: 767
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we first need to determine how many kilograms of oranges Sam needs to make 4 liters of juice. 

We know that 1 liter of juice requires 5 kilograms of oranges. Therefore, to make 4 liters of juice, Sam would need 4 times as many kilograms of oranges. 

This can be calculated as follows:

5 kilograms/liter * 4 liters = 20 kilograms

So, Sam needs 20 kilograms of oranges to make 4 liters of juice.

Next, we need to calculate how much 20 kilograms of oranges would cost. We know that each kilogram of oranges costs $3. 

Therefore, the cost of 20 kilograms of oranges can be calculated as follows:

20 kilograms * $3/kilogram = $60

So, Sam would have to spend $60 to make 4 liters of juice. 

Final Answer: Sam would have to spend $60 to make 4 liters of juice.
