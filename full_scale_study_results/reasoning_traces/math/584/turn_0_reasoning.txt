Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, let's find out how many pairs of contacts are in one box. Since each box contains 90 single use contacts and each pair of contacts consists of 2 single use contacts, we can find the number of pairs by dividing the total number of single use contacts by 2.

90 contacts / 2 = 45 pairs of contacts per box

Next, let's find out the cost of each box after the discount. Since the boxes are currently 10% off, we can find the discount by multiplying the original price by 10%.

$100.00 * 10% = $10.00 discount

Subtracting the discount from the original price gives us the discounted price of each box.

$100.00 - $10.00 = $90.00 per box

If Pete buys 2 boxes, the total cost will be:

$90.00 * 2 = $180.00

Now, let's find out how many pairs of contacts Pete gets when he buys 2 boxes. Since each box contains 45 pairs of contacts, buying 2 boxes will give him:

45 pairs * 2 = 90 pairs of contacts

Finally, we can find the cost of each pair of contacts by dividing the total cost by the total number of pairs.

$180.00 / 90 pairs = $2.00 per pair

So, each pair of contacts will cost Pete $2.00.
