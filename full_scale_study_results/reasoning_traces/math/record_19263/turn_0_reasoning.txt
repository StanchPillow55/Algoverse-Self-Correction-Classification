==================================================

To solve this problem, I will break down the reasoning and work step-by-step:

Given information:
- Officer Aaron King pulled over driver Scott Beckwith for driving without headlights.
- After seeing Beckwith's frisbee golf bag in the backseat, Officer King started questioning him about marijuana.
- Officer King claimed that "everyone who plays frisbee golf smokes weed" and asked Beckwith how much weed he had in the car.
- Officer King then told Beckwith that he wanted to search the car.

Step 1: Analyze the officer's statement and question.
Officer King's statement "So you have weed in the car then is what you're saying?" is a leading question that implies Beckwith has marijuana in his car. This is an attempt by the officer to get Beckwith to admit to possessing marijuana, even though there is no evidence that he actually has any.

Step 2: Evaluate the officer's reasoning.
The officer's claim that "everyone who plays frisbee golf smokes weed" is a generalization and an unfounded assumption. There is no evidence to support the idea
