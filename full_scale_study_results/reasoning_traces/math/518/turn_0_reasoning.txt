==================================================

First, we need to calculate the total amount of money Ali has. 

He has four $10 bills, which total to 4 * $10 = $<<4*10=40>>40.
He also has six $20 bills, which total to 6 * $20 = $<<6*20=120>>120.

So, the total amount of money Ali has is $40 + $120 = $<<40+120=160>>160.

Next, Ali gives half of his total money to his sister. Half of $160 is $160 / 2 = $<<160/2=80>>80.

So, after giving his sister half of his money, Ali has $160 - $80 = $<<160-80=80>>80 left.

Then, Ali uses 3/5 of his remaining money to buy dinner. 

3/5 of $80 is (3/5) * $80 = $<<3/5*80=48>>48.

So, after buying dinner, Ali has $80 - $48 = $<<80-48=32>>32 left.

Therefore, Ali has $32 after buying the dinner.
