Question ID: 518
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, let's calculate the total amount of money that Ali has. He has four $10 bills and six $20 bills. So, the total amount of money he has is:

4 * $10 + 6 * $20 = $40 + $120 = $160

Next, Ali gives half of this total amount to his sister. So, the amount of money he gives to his sister is:

$160 / 2 = $80

After giving his sister $80, Ali has $80 left. 

Then, Ali uses 3/5 of the remaining amount of money to buy dinner. So, the amount of money he uses to buy dinner is:

3/5 * $80 = $48

After buying dinner, the amount of money Ali has left is:

$80 - $48 = $32

So, Ali has $32 left after buying dinner.
