To solve this problem, I will break it down step-by-step:

1. Understand the context of the problem:
   - The passage describes the celebration of Germany's World Cup win in 2014.

4. Provide the final answer:
   Since the question is asking for an image or a signature, I cannot provide a complete written answer. However, I can describe the image that would be the appropriate response:
