Question ID: record_81453
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, I will break it down step-by-step:

1. Understand the context of the problem:
   - The passage describes the celebration of Germany's World Cup win in 2014.
   - The German national team, including players from Bayern Munich, has arrived in Munich to celebrate with fans.
   - One of the players mentioned is goalkeeper Manuel Neuer.

2. Identify the key information:
   - The passage states that Manuel Neuer, the goalkeeper for the German national team, is signing an autograph for a fan while holding a Bavarian trophy.

3. Analyze the question:
   The question is asking me to "Sign here: @placeholder" which means I need to provide a signature or some kind of visual representation to represent Manuel Neuer signing an autograph.

4. Provide the solution:
   Since the question is asking for a visual representation, I will provide a simple signature or handwritten text to represent Manuel Neuer's autograph.

   Here is my attempt at Manuel Neuer's signature:

   Manuel Neuer

Final answer: @placeholder
