Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, let's find out how much Susan weighs. Since Susan weighs 20 pounds less than Mark, we subtract 20 from Mark's weight:

150 pounds (Mark's weight) - 20 pounds = 130 pounds

So, Susan weighs 130 pounds.

Next, let's find out how much Bob weighs. Since Bob weighs twice as much as Susan, we multiply Susan's weight by 2:

130 pounds (Susan's weight) * 2 = 260 pounds

So, Bob weighs 260 pounds.

Now, to find the average weight of the 3 friends, we add up their weights and divide by the number of friends (which is 3):

150 pounds (Mark's weight) + 130 pounds (Susan's weight) + 260 pounds (Bob's weight) = 540 pounds

Then, we divide this total by 3:

540 pounds / 3 friends = 180 pounds

So, the average weight of the 3 friends is 180 pounds.
