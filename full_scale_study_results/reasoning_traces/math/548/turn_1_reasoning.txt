Question ID: 548
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to find out how much weight Mark lost during the 3 months he was unwell. Since he lost 10 pounds per month, we multiply 10 pounds/month by 3 months:

10 pounds/month * 3 months = 30 pounds

This is the total weight Mark lost. To find his initial weight, we add this weight loss to his final weight. His final weight is given as 70 pounds, so:

70 pounds (final weight) + 30 pounds (weight lost) = 100 pounds

So, Mark's initial weight was 100 pounds.
