Dataset Type: math
==================================================

Mark lost weight for 3 months, and each month he lost 10 pounds. 

To find out how much weight he lost in total, we multiply the amount of weight he lost each month by the number of months he was unwell. 

So, 10 pounds/month * 3 months = 30 pounds

This means Mark lost 30 pounds in total. 

If his final weight was 70 pounds, and he lost 30 pounds, then his initial weight was 70 pounds + 30 pounds = 100 pounds.

So, Mark's initial weight was 100 pounds.
