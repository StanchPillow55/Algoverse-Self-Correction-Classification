Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to calculate the total weight of each type of feed the farmer is buying.

For the sugar cubes, he buys two 1-pound boxes, so the total weight is 2 * 1 = 2 pounds.

For the carrots, he buys four 12-pound bags, so the total weight is 4 * 12 = 48 pounds.

For the hay, he buys forty-two 75-pound bales, so the total weight is 42 * 75 = 3150 pounds.

For the oats, he buys twenty 65-pound sacks, so the total weight is 20 * 65 = 1300 pounds.

Now, we add up all these weights to find the total weight of all the feed: 2 + 48 + 3150 + 1300 = 4500 pounds.

The farmer's truck can carry 2250 pounds at a time. To find out how many trips he needs to make, we divide the total weight by the truck's capacity: 4500 / 2250 = 2 trips.

However, since the total weight is not an exact multiple of the truck's capacity, the farmer will actually need to make an additional trip to transport the remaining feed. Therefore, the farmer needs to make 3 trips in total.
