Question ID: 459
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to calculate the total weight of all the feed the farmer bought.

For the sugar cubes, he bought two 1-pound boxes, so the total weight is 2 * 1 = 2 pounds.

For the carrots, he bought four 12-pound bags, so the total weight is 4 * 12 = 48 pounds.

For the hay, he bought forty-two 75-pound bales, so the total weight is 42 * 75 = 3150 pounds.

For the oats, he bought twenty 65-pound sacks, so the total weight is 20 * 65 = 1300 pounds.

Adding all these weights together, the total weight of all the feed is 2 + 48 + 3150 + 1300 = 4500 pounds.

The farmer's truck can carry 2250 pounds at a time. To find out how many trips he needs to make, we divide the total weight by the truck's capacity: 4500 / 2250 = 2 trips.

However, since the result is an exact number, we need to consider that if there was even a pound more, the farmer would need to make an additional trip. Therefore, we need to round up to the nearest whole number, even though in this case, the number is already a whole number.

So, the farmer needs to make 2 trips to transport all the feed.
