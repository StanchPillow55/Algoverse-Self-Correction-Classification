Question ID: 759
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to find out how many songs are in all 20 playlists. Since each playlist has 300 songs, we multiply the number of playlists by the number of songs in each playlist:

20 playlists * 300 songs/playlist = 6000 songs

Next, we need to find out how long all these songs will last. Since each song is 10 hours long, we multiply the total number of songs by the length of each song:

6000 songs * 10 hours/song = 60000 hours

So, the 20 playlists will last a total of 60000 hours.
