Question ID: 759
Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

The first step is to find out how many songs are in all 20 playlists. Since each playlist contains 300 songs, we multiply 300 by 20 to get the total number of songs. 

300 songs/playlist * 20 playlists = 6000 songs

Next, we need to find out how many hours all these songs will last. Since each song is 10 hours long, we multiply the total number of songs by the length of each song.

6000 songs * 10 hours/song = 60,000 hours

So, the 20 playlists will last a total of 60,000 hours.
