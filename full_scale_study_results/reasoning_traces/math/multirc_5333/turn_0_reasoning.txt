==================================================

To answer the question "What can mutations enable?", we need to analyze the information provided in the given paragraph.

The key points from the paragraph are:

1. Mutations are random changes in traits that can occur from parent to offspring.
2. Some mutations can be harmful, leading to the organism not surviving to reproduce, and the trait not being passed on.
3. Other mutations can have no effect on the organism's survival.
4. Some mutations can be beneficial, such as a moth being able to blend into its background, which would increase its chances of survival.
5. If a beneficial mutation occurs in an organism, and that organism survives and reproduces, the new trait can be passed on to its offspring.
6. Mutations are one way that living things can adapt to new conditions.

Based on this information, we can conclude that mutations can enable the following:

1. Adaptation to new conditions:
   Mutations can introduce new traits that may be beneficial for an organism's survival in a changing environment. If the mutation is advantageous, the organism with the new trait will be more likely to survive and pass it on to its offspring, enabling the species to adapt to the new conditions.
