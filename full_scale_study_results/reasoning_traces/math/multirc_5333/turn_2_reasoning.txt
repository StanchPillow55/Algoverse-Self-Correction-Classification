==================================================

To answer the question "What can mutations enable?", I will go through the given paragraph step-by-step and analyze the information provided.

The paragraph discusses how traits can vary from parent to offspring, and these changes are due to mutations. It states that mutations are random changes that are natural, and some mutations can be harmful, while others have no effect on survival.

The key points from the paragraph are:
1. Mutations are random changes that can occur naturally.
2. Some mutations are harmful and can prevent the organism from living to reproduce, so the trait is not passed on.
3. Other mutations have no effect on the organism's survival.
4. However, the paragraph suggests that some mutations can be beneficial for the organism.

The paragraph provides an example of a beneficial mutation, where a moth can blend into its background, giving it a better chance of survival. If the organism with this beneficial mutation survives and reproduces, it may pass the new trait on to its offspring, which could then be more likely to survive as well.

Based on this information, the paragraph suggests that mutations can enable:

1. Adaptation to new conditions: The paragraph states that "Mutations are one way living things adapt to new
