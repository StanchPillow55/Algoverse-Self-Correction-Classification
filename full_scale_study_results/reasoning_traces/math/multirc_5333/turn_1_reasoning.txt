==================================================

To answer the question "What can mutations enable?", I will go through the given paragraph step-by-step and analyze the information provided.

The key points from the paragraph are:
1. Traits can vary from parent to offspring due to mutations.
2. Mutations are random changes that are natural.
3. Some mutations are harmful and can prevent the organism from reproducing, so the trait is not passed on.
4. Other mutations have no effect on survival.
5. Some mutations can be beneficial for the organism's survival.
6. If a beneficial mutation occurs, the organism is more likely to survive and pass on the new trait to its offspring.
7. Mutations are one way living things adapt to new conditions.

Based on this information, the main thing that mutations can enable is:

Adaptation and changes to the traits of living organisms.

Mutations can introduce new, beneficial traits that help an organism survive and thrive in its environment. If the organism with the beneficial mutation is able to reproduce, it can pass on this new trait to its offspring, enabling the species to adapt over time.

Some specific examples of how mutations can enable changes and adaptation:
- Camouflage, like
