==================================================

First, let's calculate the number of flashlights. There are 4 people in the house, so that's 4 flashlights. There are also 2 flashlights for each of the 8 rooms, so that's 2 * 8 = 16 flashlights. In total, there are 4 + 16 = 20 flashlights.

Next, let's calculate the number of candles. Half the rooms have 4 small candles each, so that's 4 * (8 / 2) = 16 small candles. The other half of the rooms have 5 medium candles each, so that's 5 * (8 / 2) = 20 medium candles. In total, there are 16 + 20 = 36 candles.

Adding the total number of flashlights and candles together, we get 20 + 36 = 56.

So, Brianna's family is using 56 candles and flashlights when the lights go out.
