Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, let's calculate the total number of flashlights. There are 4 people in the house and each person has a flashlight. So, that's 4 flashlights. 

Next, there are 2 flashlights for each of the 8 rooms. So, that's 2 * 8 = 16 flashlights.

Adding these together, we get 4 + 16 = 20 flashlights.

Now, let's calculate the total number of candles. Half the rooms have 4 small candles each and the other half have 5 medium candles each. 

Since there are 8 rooms in total, half the rooms would be 8/2 = 4 rooms.

So, for the small candles, we have 4 rooms * 4 candles = 16 candles.

And for the medium candles, we have 4 rooms * 5 candles = 20 candles.

Adding these together, we get 16 + 20 = 36 candles.

Finally, we add the total number of flashlights and candles together to get the total number of light sources. So, 20 flashlights + 36 candles = 56 light sources.

So, when the power goes out, Brianna's family is using a total of 56 candles and flashlights.
