==================================================

Let's break down the problem into parts and solve each part separately.

First, let's calculate the number of flashlights. There are 4 people in the house and each person has a flashlight. So, that's 4 flashlights. Additionally, there are 2 flashlights for each of the 8 rooms, so that's 2*8 = 16 flashlights. Adding these together, we get 4 + 16 = 20 flashlights.

Next, let's calculate the number of candles. Half the rooms have 4 small candles each and the other half have 5 medium candles each. Since there are 8 rooms in total, that means there are 8/2 = 4 rooms with small candles and 4 rooms with medium candles.

For the rooms with small candles, there are 4*4 = 16 small candles. For the rooms with medium candles, there are 4*5 = 20 medium candles. Adding these together, we get 16 + 20 = 36 candles.

Finally, we add the total number of flashlights and candles together to get the total number of light sources. So, 20 flashlights + 36 candles = 56 light sources.

So, when the power goes out, Brianna's family is using 56 candles and flashlights.
