Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, I need to analyze the given passage and determine the key differences between the regular version of "Iron Man 3" and the special Chinese version.

The passage states that the Chinese version of "Iron Man 3" will include "special bonus footage, including an appearance by Chinese actress Fan Bingbing." This indicates that the Chinese version has additional content not present in the regular version.

The passage also mentions that "Censors visited sets and even made creative suggestions." This suggests that the Chinese version was modified to accommodate the preferences of Chinese censors and authorities.

Therefore, the key difference between the regular version and the Chinese version is that the Chinese version includes additional footage and content to appease Chinese sensitivities and censor requirements.

The final answer is:
The difference with the regular version of "Iron Man 3" is that additional footage was added to the Chinese version to appease Chinese sensitivities.
