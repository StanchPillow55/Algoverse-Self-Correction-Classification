Question ID: 879
Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, let's find out how much Iris spent on her manicure. Since she spent 1/4 as much on her manicure as she did on her hair, we multiply the cost of her hair by 1/4:

$400 * 1/4 = $100

So, Iris spent $100 on her manicure.

Next, let's find out how much she spent on her pedicure. Since she spent 3/4 as much on her pedicure as she did on her manicure, we multiply the cost of her manicure by 3/4:

$100 * 3/4 = $75

So, Iris spent $75 on her pedicure.

Finally, to find out how much Iris spent in total at the spa, we add up the cost of her hair, manicure, and pedicure:

$400 (hair) + $100 (manicure) + $75 (pedicure) = $575

So, Iris spent $575 at the spa.
