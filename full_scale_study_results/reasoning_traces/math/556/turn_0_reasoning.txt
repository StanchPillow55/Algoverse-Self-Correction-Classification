Dataset Type: math
==================================================

The cost of the six-inch cold-cut combo sub is thrice the cost of the foot-long fish sub. 

Given that the foot-long fish sub costs $40, the six-inch cold-cut combo sub would cost 3 * $40 = $<<3*40=120>>120.

Therefore, if you buy both the foot-long fish sub and the six-inch cold-cut combo sub, you would pay $40 (for the fish sub) + $120 (for the cold-cut combo sub) = $<<40+120=160>>160.

So, it costs you $160 for lunch today at Subway.
