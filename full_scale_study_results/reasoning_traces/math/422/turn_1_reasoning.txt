==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost for each period and then sum them up.

First, we calculate the cost for the first 6 months. Since the cost is $8 a month, we multiply 6 (months) by $8 to get $48.

Next, we calculate the cost for the next 8 months. The cost is now $12 a month, so we multiply 8 (months) by $12 to get $96.

Finally, we calculate the cost for the remaining months. There are 24 months in 2 years, so after the first 6 months and the next 8 months, there are 24 - 6 - 8 = 10 months left. The cost is now $14 a month, so we multiply 10 (months) by $14 to get $140.

Adding all these costs together, we get $48 + $96 + $140 = $284. 

So, 2 years of the service cost Bill $284.
