The problem can be solved by breaking down the total cost into three parts: the cost for the first 6 months, the cost for the next 8 months, and the cost for the remaining months.

1. For the first 6 months, the cost is $8 per month. So, the total cost for this period is 6 months * $8/month = $48.

2. For the next 8 months, the cost is $12 per month. So, the total cost for this period is 8 months * $12/month = $96.

3. The remaining period is 2 years - 6 months - 8 months = 10 months. For these 10 months, the cost is $14 per month. So, the total cost for this period is 10 months * $14/month = $140.

Adding up these three amounts gives the total cost for the 2 years: $48 + $96 + $140 = $284.

So, 2 years of the service cost Bill $284.
