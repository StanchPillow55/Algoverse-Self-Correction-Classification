Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost for each period of different prices and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the cost for the first 6 months. The price for this period is $8 per month, so the total cost is 6 months * $8/month = $48.

Next, we calculate the cost for the next 8 months. The price for this period is $12 per month, so the total cost is 8 months * $12/month = $96.

Finally, we calculate the cost for the remaining months. We've already accounted for 6 + 8 = 14 months, so there are 2 years * 12 months/year - 14 months = 10 months left. The price for this period is $14 per month, so the total cost is 10 months * $14/month = $140.

Adding these costs together, we get $48 + $96 + $140 = $284.

So, 2 years of the service cost Bill $284.
