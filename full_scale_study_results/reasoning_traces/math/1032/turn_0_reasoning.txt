Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, let's find out how many medium-sized beans Grandpa can eat. Since he can eat twice as many medium-sized beans as large beans, and he can eat 75 large beans, he can eat 75 * 2 = 150 medium-sized beans.

Next, let's find out how many small beans Grandpa can eat. Since eating 3 small beans is the same as eating 1 medium-sized bean, and he can eat 150 medium-sized beans, he can eat 150 * 3 = 450 small beans.

So, Grandpa can eat 450 small jelly beans.
