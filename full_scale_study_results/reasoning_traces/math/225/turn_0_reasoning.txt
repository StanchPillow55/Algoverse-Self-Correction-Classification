The problem states that it takes Andrew 6 days to travel by bus from New Jersey to Rochester. It also states that it takes half as many days to travel by car. 

First, we need to find out how many days it takes to travel by car. We do this by dividing the number of days it takes to travel by bus by 2. 

6 days / 2 = 3 days

So, it takes 3 days to travel by car from New Jersey to Rochester. 

Next, we need to find out how many days it will take Andrew to travel to Rochester by bus and return by car. We do this by adding the number of days it takes to travel by bus and the number of days it takes to travel by car.

6 days (bus) + 3 days (car) = 9 days

Therefore, it will take Andrew 9 days to travel to Rochester by bus and return by car.
