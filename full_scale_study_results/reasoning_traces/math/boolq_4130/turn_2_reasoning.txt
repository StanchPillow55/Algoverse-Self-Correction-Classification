Question ID: boolq_4130
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To determine if Beijing and Shanghai are in the same time zone, we need to consider the time zone information provided in the context.

Given information:
- China follows a single standard time offset of UTC+08:00, despite spanning five geographical time zones.
- The official national standard time is called Beijing Time (Chinese: 北京时间) domestically and China Standard Time (CST) internationally.
- Daylight saving time has not been observed since 1991.

Since China follows a single standard time offset of UTC+08:00, this means that both Beijing and Shanghai are located in the same time zone, which is UTC+08:00.

Therefore, the final answer is:
Yes, Beijing and Shanghai are in the same time zone.
