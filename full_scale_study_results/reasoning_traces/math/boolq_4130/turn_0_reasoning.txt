==================================================

To determine if Beijing and Shanghai are in the same time zone, we need to consider the time zone information provided in the context.

Given information:
- China follows a single standard time offset of UTC+08:00, which means the entire country is 8 hours ahead of Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).
- The official national standard time is called Beijing Time (Chinese: 北京时间) domestically and China Standard Time (CST) internationally.
- Daylight saving time has not been observed since 1991.

Since China spans across multiple geographical time zones, but follows a single standard time of UTC+08:00, this means that all cities within China, including Beijing and Shanghai, are in the same time zone.

Reasoning:
1. China follows a single standard time offset of UTC+08:00, which means the entire country is 8 hours ahead of Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).
2. This single standard time is used across all of China, regardless of the geographical location of different cities within the country.
3. Therefore, Beijing and Shanghai, being located within the same country (China), are in the same time zone, which is UTC+08:00
