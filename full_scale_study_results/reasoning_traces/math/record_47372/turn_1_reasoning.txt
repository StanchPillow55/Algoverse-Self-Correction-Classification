Question ID: record_47372
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given information and determine the appropriate response to the query.

Given information:
- Turkey's foreign minister insisted that Turkey "is on Kobani's side" but won't unilaterally send ground troops to save it.
- ISIS has wrested control of about one-third of Kobani, a Kurdish enclave near the Turkish border.
- The foreign minister denied that "discrimination on a sectarian basis" was a factor in Turkey's decisions.

Query: Please show all your work and reasoning, then state your final answer.

Reasoning:
1. The foreign minister's statement that Turkey "is on Kobani's side" suggests that Turkey is supportive of the Kurds in Kobani and their fight against ISIS.
2. However, the foreign minister's refusal to unilaterally send ground troops to save Kobani indicates that Turkey is not willing to take direct military action to defend the Kurds.
3. The foreign minister's denial of "discrimination on a sectarian basis" suggests that Turkey's decision not to send ground troops is not based on the fact that the Kurds are the primary victims in Kobani.
