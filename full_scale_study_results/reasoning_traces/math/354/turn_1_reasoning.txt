==================================================

To determine how much more money Annabelle needs to save for the phone, we need to calculate her total earnings from both jobs and add that to her existing savings. Then, we subtract this sum from the cost of the phone.

1. **Calculate Annabelle's earnings from her first job:**
   - Annabelle earns $10 per hour.
   - She works 20 hours at this job.
   - Earnings from the first job = $10/hour × 20 hours = $200.

2. **Calculate Annabelle's earnings from her second job:**
   - Annabelle earns $5 per hour.
   - She works 15 hours at this job.
   - Earnings from the second job = $5/hour × 15 hours = $75.

3. **Calculate Annabelle's total savings:**
   - Annabelle already has $80 in her savings.
   - Total earnings from both jobs = $200 (first job) + $75 (second job) = $275.
   - Total savings = Existing savings + Total earnings = $80 + $275 = $355.

4. **Determine how much more Annabelle needs to save:**
   - The phone costs $400.
   - Amount still needed = Cost of the phone - Total savings = $400 - $355 = $45.

Therefore, Annabelle still needs to save **$45** to buy the phone.
