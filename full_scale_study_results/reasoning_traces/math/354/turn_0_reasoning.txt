Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to calculate how much money Annabelle earns from her two jobs.

From her first job, she earns $10 per hour for 20 hours of work. So, the total amount she earns from her first job is:

10 * 20 = $200

From her second job, she earns $5 per hour for 15 hours of work. So, the total amount she earns from her second job is:

5 * 15 = $75

Adding these two amounts together, we find the total amount of money Annabelle earns from her jobs:

200 + 75 = $275

Now, we add this to the amount she already has in her savings:

275 + 80 = $355

Finally, we subtract this total from the cost of the phone to find out how much more she needs to save:

400 - 355 = $45

So, Annabelle still needs to save $45 to buy the phone.
