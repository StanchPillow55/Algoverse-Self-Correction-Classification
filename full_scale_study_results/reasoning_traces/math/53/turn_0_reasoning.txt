To solve this problem, we first need to calculate the revenue the mechanic earned on each day.

On Thursday, the mechanic repaired 6 truck tires and 4 car tires. Since the mechanic charges $60 for each truck tire and $40 for each car tire, the total revenue for Thursday can be calculated as follows:

Revenue from truck tires = Number of truck tires repaired * Price per truck tire
= 6 * $60
= $360

Revenue from car tires = Number of car tires repaired * Price per car tire
= 4 * $40
= $160

Total revenue on Thursday = Revenue from truck tires + Revenue from car tires
= $360 + $160
= $520

On Friday, the mechanic repaired 12 car tires and didn't repair any truck tires. So, the total revenue for Friday can be calculated as follows:

Revenue from car tires = Number of car tires repaired * Price per car tire
= 12 * $40
= $480

Since no truck tires were repaired on Friday, the total revenue on Friday is just the revenue from car tires, which is $480.

Now, we need to find out how much more revenue the mechanic earned on the day with higher revenue. The mechanic earned more revenue on Thursday ($520) than on Friday ($480). So, the difference in revenue is:

Difference in revenue = Revenue on Thursday - Revenue on Friday
= $520 - $480
= $40

So, the mechanic earned $40 more on the day with higher revenue.
