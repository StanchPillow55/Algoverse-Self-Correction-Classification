==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to add up all the miles Sam ran throughout the week.

On Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, Sam ran 3 miles each day. Since there are 3 days, we multiply 3 (miles) by 3 (days) to get the total miles for these days. 

3 miles/day * 3 days = 9 miles

On Tuesday and Thursday, Sam ran 5 miles each day. Since there are 2 days, we multiply 5 (miles) by 2 (days) to get the total miles for these days.

5 miles/day * 2 days = 10 miles

Now, we add the total miles from Monday, Wednesday, and Friday to the total miles from Tuesday and Thursday to get the total miles for the week.

9 miles + 10 miles = 19 miles

So, Sam ran a total of 19 miles this week.
