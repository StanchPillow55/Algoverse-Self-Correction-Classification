Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to find out how many people each type of vehicle carried and then add those numbers together.

First, let's find out how many people were carried by the cars. Since each car carried 3 people and there were 20 cars, we multiply 20 by 3 to get 60 people.

Next, let's find out how many people were carried by the buses. Since each bus carried 35 people and there were 12 buses, we multiply 12 by 35 to get 420 people.

Finally, we add the number of people carried by the cars and the buses to find out how many people were inside the church. So, 60 (from the cars) + 420 (from the buses) equals 480 people.

Therefore, there were 480 people inside the church.
