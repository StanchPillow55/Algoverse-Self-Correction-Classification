Question ID: 1097
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of people that the cars and buses can carry. 

First, we calculate the number of people that the cars can carry. Since each car can carry 3 people, we multiply the number of cars by the number of people each car can carry:

20 cars * 3 people/car = 60 people

Next, we calculate the number of people that the buses can carry. Since each bus can carry 35 people, we multiply the number of buses by the number of people each bus can carry:

12 buses * 35 people/bus = 420 people

Finally, we add the number of people that the cars can carry to the number of people that the buses can carry to get the total number of people:

60 people + 420 people = 480 people

Therefore, there were 480 people inside the church.
