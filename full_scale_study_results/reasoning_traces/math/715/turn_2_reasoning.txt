Question ID: 715
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

The company had planned to spend $700 for each computer. However, the price of each computer increased by 10%. 

To find the new price of each computer, we need to calculate 10% of $700 and add it to the original price. 

10% of $700 is calculated as follows:

(10/100) * $700 = $70

So, the new price of each computer is $700 + $70 = $770

The company wanted to buy 500 computers. Therefore, the total amount of money they paid to buy the computers at the new prices is calculated by multiplying the new price of each computer by the number of computers. 

$770 * 500 = $385,000

So, the company paid $385,000 to buy the computers at the new prices.
