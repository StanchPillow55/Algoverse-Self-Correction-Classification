==================================================

The company had planned to spend $700 for each computer. However, the price of each computer increased by 10%. 

To find the new price of each computer, we need to calculate 10% of $700 and then add that to the original price. 

10% of $700 can be calculated as follows:

10/100 * $700 = $70

So, the new price of each computer is $700 + $70 = $770

The company wanted to buy 500 computers. So, the total amount of money they paid to buy the computers at the new prices is:

500 computers * $770/computer = $385,000

So, the company paid $385,000 to buy the computers at the new prices.
