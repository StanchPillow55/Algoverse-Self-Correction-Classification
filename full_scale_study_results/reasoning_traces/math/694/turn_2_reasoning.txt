Question ID: 694
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

Okay, let's break down this problem step by step:

Given information:
- 42 adults and 15 babies will be attending the function at Mia's restaurant.
- The restaurant has 5 times as many regular chairs as high chairs.
- There are 8 high chairs.

Step 1: Find the total number of people attending the function.
Total people = 42 adults + 15 babies = 57 people

Step 2: Find the number of regular chairs.
Number of high chairs = 8
Number of regular chairs = 5 Ã— 8 = 40 regular chairs

Step 3: Find the total number of chairs needed.
Total chairs needed = Number of adults + Number of high chairs
Total chairs needed = 42 + 8 = 50 chairs

Step 4: Find the number of additional chairs Mia needs to get.
Additional chairs needed = Total chairs needed - Total chairs available
Additional chairs needed = 50 - 40 = 10 chairs

Therefore, Mia needs to get 10 more chairs for the function.
