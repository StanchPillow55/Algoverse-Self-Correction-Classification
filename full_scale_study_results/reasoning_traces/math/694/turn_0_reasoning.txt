Question ID: 694
Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, let's find out how many regular chairs there are in the restaurant. We know that the restaurant has 5 times as many regular chairs as high chairs. Given that there are 8 high chairs, we can calculate the number of regular chairs as follows:

5 * 8 = 40 regular chairs

Next, let's find out how many chairs in total are currently in the restaurant. We do this by adding the number of regular chairs to the number of high chairs:

40 regular chairs + 8 high chairs = 48 total chairs

Now, let's find out how many chairs are needed for the function. We know that 42 adults and 15 babies will be attending. Each adult will need a regular chair and each baby will need a high chair. So, the total number of chairs needed is:

42 adults + 15 babies = 57 total chairs needed

Finally, let's find out how many more chairs Mia needs to get for the function. We do this by subtracting the total number of chairs currently in the restaurant from the total number of chairs needed:

57 total chairs needed - 48 total chairs currently = 9 more chairs needed

So, Mia needs to get 9 more chairs for the function.
