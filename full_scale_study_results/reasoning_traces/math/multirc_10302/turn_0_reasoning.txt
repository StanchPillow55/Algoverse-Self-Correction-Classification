==================================================

To answer this question, we need to carefully analyze the information provided in the paragraph.

The key details are:
1. Inside the National Military Command Center (NMCC), the deputy director of operations and his assistant began notifying senior Pentagon officials of the incident.
2. At about 9:00, the senior NMCC operations officer reached out to the FAA operations center for information.
3. Although the NMCC was advised of the hijacking of American 11, the scrambling of jets was not discussed.

From this, we can conclude the following:

1. The NMCC is the National Military Command Center, which is a facility within the Pentagon that serves as the nation's primary and alternate national-level command and control center for the U.S. Armed Forces.
2. The senior NMCC operations officer contacted the FAA operations center around 9:00 AM to gather information about the incident.
3. However, the paragraph specifically states that "the scrambling of jets was not discussed" between the NMCC and the FAA, despite the NMCC being aware of the hijacking of American 11.

Therefore, the correct answer is:
The NMCC
