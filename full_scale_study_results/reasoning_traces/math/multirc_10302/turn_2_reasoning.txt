Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

The passage does not state that the NMCC (National Military Command Center) discussed scrambling jets. The passage states:

"Although the NMCC was advised of the hijacking of American 11, the scrambling of jets was not discussed."

The passage does not provide any information about when jets were scrambled. It only states that the NMCC was advised of the hijacking of American 11, but the scrambling of jets was not discussed.

Therefore, the correct answer is:
The passage does not indicate when the NMCC discussed scrambling jets, as it states the scrambling of jets was not discussed.
