Question ID: record_2690
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

The passage does not state that the couple was jailed on child neglect charges. Instead, it says that the couple "have avoided jail time after pleading guilty to charges in Indiana for driving cross country with five of their children inside a rented moving truck's unheated cargo area." The passage also states that "A Henry County judge on Tuesday sentenced David Detjen, 41, and his 40-year-old wife, Rebecca, of Fairmont City, Pennsylvania, each to 18 months of probation after accepting their guilty pleas to felony child neglect."

Therefore, the correct answer is:
The couple were not jailed, but instead received 18-month suspended sentences and probation after pleading guilty to felony child neglect charges.
