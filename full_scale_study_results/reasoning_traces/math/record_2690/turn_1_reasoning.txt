Question ID: record_2690
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

The passage does not state that the couple was jailed on child neglect charges. Instead, it says that the couple "have avoided jail time after pleading guilty to charges in Indiana for driving cross country with five of their children inside a rented moving truck's unheated cargo area." The passage clearly states that the couple received 18 months of probation, not jail time.

Therefore, the correct answer is:
The couple were not jailed on child neglect charges after their arrest at an eastern truck stop. They received 18-month suspended sentences and were placed on probation instead.
