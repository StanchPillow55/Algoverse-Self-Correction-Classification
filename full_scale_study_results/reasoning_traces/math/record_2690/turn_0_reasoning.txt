==================================================

To solve this problem, I need to carefully analyze the information provided in the passage and determine whether the statement in the query is true or false.

Given information:
- The passage states that the couple, David Detjen and Rebecca Detjen, were arrested at an Interstate 70 truck stop near New Castle, Indiana.
- They were charged with felony child neglect for driving cross-country with five of their children inside the unheated cargo area of a rented moving truck.
- The passage also mentions that the couple pleaded guilty to the charges and were sentenced to 18 months of probation, not jail time.

Based on the information provided in the passage, the statement in the query is false. The couple was not jailed on child neglect charges after their arrest at the truck stop. Instead, they received 18-month suspended sentences and were placed on probation.

To summarize the reasoning:
1. The passage clearly states that the couple was arrested at an Interstate 70 truck stop near New Castle, Indiana, not an "eastern" truck stop.
2. The passage also explicitly states that the couple received 18-month suspended sentences and were placed on probation, not j
