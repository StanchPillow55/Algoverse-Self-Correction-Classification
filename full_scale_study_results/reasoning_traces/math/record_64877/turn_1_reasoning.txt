Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to analyze the passage provided and the query regarding the statement made by Filippetti. The goal is to identify what or who Filippetti is referring to with the placeholder "@placeholder."

### Step 1: Understanding the Context
The passage discusses the political situation in France during the presidential elections, specifically focusing on the candidates Nicolas Sarkozy and Francois Hollande. Sarkozy is courting far-right voters after a first round of elections where Hollande received the most support. The passage also mentions the National Front candidate Marine Le Pen and her significant support.

### Step 2: Analyzing the Query
The query states: "The people ... don't trust @placeholder any more," Filippetti said. This implies that Filippetti is commenting on a lack of trust among the people towards a specific individual or group.

### Step 3: Identifying the Subject of Distrust
Given the context of the passage, we can infer that the distrust could be directed towards one of the political figures mentioned. The candidates in the election are:

- Nicolas Sarkozy (current president)
- Francois Hollande (Socialist candidate)
- Marine Le Pen (far-right candidate)

### Step 4: Evaluating the Candidates
1. **Nicolas Sarkozy**: As the incumbent president, he is likely to face scrutiny and distrust, especially if he is courting far-right voters.
2. **Francois Hollande**: He is the leading candidate and may also be a target of distrust from those who support Sarkozy or Le Pen.
3. **Marine Le Pen**: She has garnered significant support, but the context of the statement does not suggest that she is the one being distrusted.

### Step 5: Making an Informed Decision
Given that Filippetti's statement reflects a sentiment of distrust, it is reasonable to conclude that the distrust could be directed towards Sarkozy, especially since he is actively trying to appeal to voters who may feel disillusioned. 

### Final Answer
Based on the analysis, the most logical conclusion is that Filippetti is referring to Nicolas Sarkozy with the placeholder "@placeholder." Therefore, the final answer is:

**Nicolas Sarkozy**
