==================================================

To solve this problem, I will need to analyze the given passage and extract the relevant information to determine the placeholder value.

Given information:
- The passage discusses the results of the first round of the French presidential election, where no candidate received a majority.
- The two candidates who will face off in the second round are Nicolas Sarkozy (the incumbent president) and Francois Hollande (the Socialist candidate).
- The passage mentions that National Front candidate Marine Le Pen attracted a "record amount of support" in the first round.
- The passage also mentions that Sarkozy said he has a "duty to listen" to far-right voters after Le Pen's strong performance.

Based on this information, the placeholder value is likely to be "Sarkozy", as the passage suggests that Sarkozy is trying to court far-right voters in the runoff election.

The query states: "The people ... don't trust @placeholder any more," Filippetti said.

Given the context of the passage, it seems that the person being referred to as not being trusted anymore is Sarkozy.

Therefore, the final answer is:

The people ... don't trust Sarko
