==================================================

To solve the query regarding the placeholder in the statement "The people ... don't trust @placeholder any more," we need to analyze the context provided in the passage.

1. **Identify the Context**: The passage discusses the political landscape in France, focusing on the presidential elections involving Nicolas Sarkozy and Francois Hollande. Sarkozy is courting far-right voters, and Hollande has emerged as a strong candidate after the first round of voting. The mention of a "crisis vote" indicates a lack of trust in the current political situation or candidates.

2. **Determine the Subject of Distrust**: The statement implies that there is a figure or entity that the people no longer trust. Given the context of the passage, it is reasonable to infer that the placeholder likely refers to one of the political candidates or possibly the political establishment as a whole.

3. **Candidates Mentioned**: The two main candidates mentioned are:
   - Nicolas Sarkozy (the incumbent president)
   - Francois Hollande (the Socialist candidate who topped the first round)

4. **Analyzing the Sentiment**: The phrase "don't trust" suggests a sentiment of disillusionment or dissatisfaction among the voters. Since Sarkozy is actively trying to appeal to voters, it might indicate that he is aware of the distrust towards him, especially after losing the first round to Hollande.

5. **Conclusion**: Given that the passage highlights Sarkozy's efforts to connect with voters and the mention of a "crisis vote," it is logical to conclude that the placeholder likely refers to Sarkozy himself. The people may be expressing their distrust towards him, especially in light of the electoral results.

Final Answer: The placeholder @placeholder refers to Nicolas Sarkozy.
