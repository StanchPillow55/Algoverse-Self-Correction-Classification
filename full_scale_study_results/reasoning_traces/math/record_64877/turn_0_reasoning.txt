==================================================

To solve the query regarding the placeholder in the statement "The people ... don't trust @placeholder any more," we need to analyze the context provided in the passage. 

1. **Identify the Context**: The passage discusses the political landscape in France during the presidential elections, specifically focusing on the candidates Nicolas Sarkozy and Francois Hollande. It mentions Sarkozy's efforts to appeal to far-right voters and the fact that Hollande received the most support in the first round of voting.

2. **Determine the Subject of Distrust**: The statement implies that there is a figure or entity that the people no longer trust. Given the context of the passage, we need to consider who might be the subject of this distrust. 

3. **Candidates Mentioned**: The two main candidates mentioned are:
   - Nicolas Sarkozy (the incumbent president)
   - Francois Hollande (the Socialist candidate who topped Sarkozy in the first round)

4. **Analyzing the Sentiment**: The phrase "don't trust" suggests a negative sentiment towards a political figure. Since Sarkozy is the incumbent and is actively trying to appeal to voters, it is plausible that he might be the one facing distrust from the electorate, especially considering the mention of a "crisis vote" for far-right voters.

5. **Final Decision**: Given that Sarkozy is the one who is trying to regain trust and is in a position where he might be viewed with skepticism by the voters (especially after losing the first round), it is reasonable to conclude that the placeholder likely refers to Sarkozy.

Thus, the complete reasoning leads us to fill in the placeholder with "Sarkozy."

Final Answer: Sarkozy
