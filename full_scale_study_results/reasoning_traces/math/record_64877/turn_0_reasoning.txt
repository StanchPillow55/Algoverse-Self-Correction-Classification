==================================================

To solve this problem, I will need to analyze the given passage and determine the appropriate placeholder to use in the query.

The passage discusses the results of the first round of the French presidential election, where no candidate received a majority. It mentions that the far-right candidate Marine Le Pen received a record amount of support, and that this was seen as a "crisis vote" by President Sarkozy.

The query states: "The people ... don't trust @placeholder any more," Filippetti said.

Based on the context of the passage, the most appropriate placeholder to use would be "Sarkozy". The passage indicates that Sarkozy is trying to court far-right voters in advance of the runoff election, suggesting that he may have lost the trust of some voters.

Therefore, the complete query with the appropriate placeholder would be:

"The people ... don't trust Sarkozy any more," Filippetti said.
