Question ID: 972
Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, let's calculate how many boxes of oranges Mrs. Harrington had left after giving some to her mom and sister. She gave away 2 boxes to her mom and 2 boxes to her sister, which is a total of 2 + 2 = <<2+2=4>>4 boxes.

So, Mrs. Harrington had 12 - 4 = <<12-4=8>>8 boxes of oranges left.

Each box contains 20 oranges, so Mrs. Harrington had 8 * 20 = <<8*20=160>>160 oranges left.

Mrs. Harrington kept 1/4 of the oranges, which is 160 / 4 = <<160/4=40>>40 oranges.

Therefore, Mrs. Harrington sold 160 - 40 = <<160-40=120>>120 oranges. 

So, the final answer is that Mrs. Harrington sold 120 oranges.
