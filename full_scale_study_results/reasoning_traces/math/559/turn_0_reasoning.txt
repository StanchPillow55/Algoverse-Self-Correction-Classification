Question ID: 559
Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

Octavia drinks half the daily recommended cups of coffee, which is 4 cups. Therefore, Octavia drinks 4/2 = 2 cups of coffee daily.

Juan drinks 10 times the amount of coffee Octavia drinks, so Juan drinks 10 * 2 = <<10*2=20>>20 cups of coffee daily.

Juan's doctor has asked him to reduce his coffee intake to the daily recommendation of 4 cups. Therefore, Juan must reduce his coffee intake by 20 - 4 = <<20-4=16>>16 cups. 

So, Juan must reduce his daily coffee intake by 16 cups.
