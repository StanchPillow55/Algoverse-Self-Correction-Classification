Question ID: 172
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine the age of each bird and then sum their ages to find the total age of the four birds.

1. **Identify the ages given and relationships:**

   - Sally Thirtytwo is 8 years old.
   - Sally Four is the same age as Sally Thirtytwo, so Sally Four is also 8 years old.

2. **Determine Granny Red's age:**

   - Granny Red is two times as old as Sally Four.
   - Since Sally Four is 8 years old, Granny Red's age is:
     \[
     \text{Granny Red's age} = 2 \times 8 = 16 \text{ years old}
     \]

3. **Determine Sally Two's age:**

   - Sally Two is three years older than Granny Red.
   - Since Granny Red is 16 years old, Sally Two's age is:
     \[
     \text{Sally Two's age} = 16 + 3 = 19 \text{ years old}
     \]

4. **Calculate the total age of the four birds:**

   - Sally Two: 19 years old
   - Granny Red: 16 years old
   - Sally Four: 8 years old
   - Sally Thirtytwo: 8 years old

   Add these ages together:
   \[
   \text{Total age} = 19 + 16 + 8 + 8 = 51 \text{ years}
   \]

Thus, the total age of the four birds is \(\boxed{51}\) years.
