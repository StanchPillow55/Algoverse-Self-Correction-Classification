Question ID: 172
Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

Let's start by assigning the given values to the birds:

- Sally Thirtytwo is 8 years old.
- Sally Four is the same age as Sally Thirtytwo, so Sally Four is also 8 years old.
- Granny Red is two times as old as Sally Four, so Granny Red is 2 * 8 = 16 years old.
- Sally Two is three years older than Granny Red, so Sally Two is 16 + 3 = 19 years old.

To find the total age of the four birds, we add up all their ages:

8 (Sally Thirtytwo) + 8 (Sally Four) + 16 (Granny Red) + 19 (Sally Two) = 51 years.

So, the total age of the four birds is 51 years.
