Question ID: 172
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, let's start with the information we know. We know that Sally Four and Sally Thirtytwo are the same age, and that age is 8 years old. 

So, Sally Four = 8 years old
And, Sally Thirtytwo = 8 years old

Next, we know that Granny Red is two times as old as Sally Four. Since Sally Four is 8 years old, that means Granny Red is 2 * 8 = 16 years old.

Finally, we know that Sally Two is three years older than Granny Red. Since Granny Red is 16 years old, that means Sally Two is 16 + 3 = 19 years old.

Now, to find the total age of the four birds, we just add up all their ages:

Sally Four (8 years) + Sally Thirtytwo (8 years) + Granny Red (16 years) + Sally Two (19 years) = 51 years

So, the total age of the four birds is 51 years.
