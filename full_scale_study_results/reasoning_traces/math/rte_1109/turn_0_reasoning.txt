To determine whether the premise entails the hypothesis, we need to analyze the information provided and the logical relationship between the two statements.

Given information:
- Premise: 58 percent of Americans expressed their satisfaction with the President's job performance.
- Premise: 44 percent supported Nixon at the very beginning of the investigation into Watergate.
- Hypothesis: Although 58% of Americans are unsatisfied with Clinton's job performance, 44% found Nixon's work adequate at the start of the Watergate scandal.

Step 1: Analyze the premise.
