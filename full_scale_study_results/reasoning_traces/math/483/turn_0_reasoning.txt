Question ID: 483
Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to find out how many songs Luri has on his player. Since we know that Luri has 3 times as many songs as Gabriel, we multiply Gabriel's number of songs by 3. 

20 songs * 3 = 60 songs

So, Luri has 60 songs on his player.

Next, we need to find out how many more songs each person can add to their player. Since each player can hold up to 100 songs, we subtract the number of songs each person currently has from 100.

For Gabriel: 100 songs - 20 songs = 80 songs
For Luri: 100 songs - 60 songs = 40 songs

Finally, to find out how many fewer songs Luri can add than Gabriel, we subtract the number of songs Luri can add from the number of songs Gabriel can add.

80 songs - 40 songs = 40 songs

So, Luri can add 40 fewer songs to his player than Gabriel can add to his.
