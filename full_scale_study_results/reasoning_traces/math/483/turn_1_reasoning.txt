Question ID: 483
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to find out how many songs Luri has on her player. Since we know that Luri has 3 times as many songs as Gabriel, we multiply Gabriel's number of songs by 3. 

20 songs (Gabriel's songs) * 3 = 60 songs (Luri's songs)

Next, we need to find out how many more songs each player can add to their player. Since each player's media player can store up to 100 songs, we subtract the number of songs they currently have from 100.

100 songs - 20 songs (Gabriel's songs) = 80 songs (Gabriel can add)
100 songs - 60 songs (Luri's songs) = 40 songs (Luri can add)

Finally, to find out how many fewer songs Luri can add to her player than Gabriel can add to his, we subtract the number of songs Luri can add from the number of songs Gabriel can add.

80 songs (Gabriel can add) - 40 songs (Luri can add) = 40 songs

So, Luri can add 40 fewer songs to her player than Gabriel can add to his.
