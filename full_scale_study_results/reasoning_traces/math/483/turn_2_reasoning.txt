Question ID: 483
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to find out how many songs Luri has on his player. Since we know that Luri has 3 times as many songs as Gabriel, we multiply Gabriel's number of songs by 3. 

20 songs (Gabriel) * 3 = 60 songs (Luri)

Next, we find out how many more songs each player can add to their player. We do this by subtracting the number of songs they already have from the total capacity of the player, which is 100 songs.

100 songs (total capacity) - 20 songs (Gabriel) = 80 songs can be added by Gabriel
100 songs (total capacity) - 60 songs (Luri) = 40 songs can be added by Luri

Finally, we find out how many fewer songs Luri can add than Gabriel. We do this by subtracting the number of songs Luri can add from the number of songs Gabriel can add.

80 songs (Gabriel) - 40 songs (Luri) = 40 songs

So, Luri can add 40 fewer songs to his player than Gabriel can.
