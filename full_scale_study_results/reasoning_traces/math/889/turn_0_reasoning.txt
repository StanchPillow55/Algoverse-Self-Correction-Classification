Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to calculate the total number of petals for each type of flower.

For the orchids, we multiply the number of orchids by the number of petals each orchid has. 

5 orchids * 5 petals/orchid = 25 petals

For the daisies, we do the same.

4 daisies * 10 petals/daisy = 40 petals

To find out how many more petals the daisies have compared to the orchids, we subtract the total number of orchid petals from the total number of daisy petals.

40 petals (daisies) - 25 petals (orchids) = 15 petals

So, the daisies have 15 more petals than the orchids.
