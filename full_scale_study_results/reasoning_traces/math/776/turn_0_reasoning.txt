==================================================

To solve this problem, you need to calculate the amount of the discount and then subtract it from the original price of the laptop.

Step 1: Calculate the amount of the discount
The discount is 20% of the original price. To calculate this, you multiply the original price by the discount rate (expressed as a decimal). 

So, the calculation is: $1000 * 0.20 = $200

This means that the discount is $200.

Step 2: Subtract the discount from the original price
Now, you subtract the discount from the original price to find out how much you have to pay.

The calculation is: $1000 - $200 = $800

So, after a 20% discount, you have to pay $800 for the laptop.
