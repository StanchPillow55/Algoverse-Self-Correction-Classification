To solve the problem of determining how much you have to pay for a laptop after receiving a 20% discount, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - The original price of the laptop is $1000.
   - You receive a 20% discount on this price.
   - We need to calculate the final price you have to pay after applying the discount.

2. **Calculate the Discount Amount:**
   - A 20% discount means you pay 20% less than the original price.
   - To find the discount amount, calculate 20% of $1000.
   - The formula to calculate the percentage of a number is:
     \[
     \text{Discount Amount} = \left(\frac{\text{Discount Percentage}}{100}\right) \times \text{Original Price}
     \]
   - Plug in the values:
     \[
     \text{Discount Amount} = \left(\frac{20}{100}\right) \times 1000 = 0.20 \times 1000 = 200
     \]
   - So, the discount amount is $200.

3. **Calculate the Final Price:**
   - Subtract the discount amount from the original price to find the final price you have to pay.
   - The formula is:
     \[
     \text{Final Price} = \text{Original Price} - \text{Discount Amount}
     \]
   - Plug in the values:
     \[
     \text{Final Price} = 1000 - 200 = 800
     \]

4. **Conclusion:**
   - After applying the 20% discount, the amount you have to pay for the laptop is $800.

Thus, the final answer is that you have to pay **$800** for the laptop after the discount.
