To solve this problem, we need to calculate the cost of two different mixtures of almonds and walnuts and then find the difference in cost between them.

**Step 1: Calculate the cost of the first mixture (1/2 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts).**

- **Cost of almonds in the first mixture:**
  - The cost per pound of almonds is $10.
  - For 1/2 pound of almonds, the cost is:
  \[
  \frac{1}{2} \times 10 = 5 \text{ dollars}
  \]

- **Cost of walnuts in the first mixture:**
  - The cost per pound of walnuts is $15.
  - For 1/3 pound of walnuts, the cost is:
  \[
  \frac{1}{3} \times 15 = 5 \text{ dollars}
  \]

- **Total cost of the first mixture:**
  \[
  5 + 5 = 10 \text{ dollars}
  \]

**Step 2: Calculate the cost of the second mixture (1/5 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts).**

- **Cost of almonds in the second mixture:**
  - For 1/5 pound of almonds, the cost is:
  \[
  \frac{1}{5} \times 10 = 2 \text{ dollars}
  \]

- **Cost of walnuts in the second mixture:**
  - For 1/3 pound of walnuts, the cost remains:
  \[
  \frac{1}{3} \times 15 = 5 \text{ dollars}
  \]

- **Total cost of the second mixture:**
  \[
  2 + 5 = 7 \text{ dollars}
  \]

**Step 3: Calculate the difference in cost between the two mixtures.**

- **Difference in cost:**
  \[
  10 - 7 = 3 \text{ dollars}
  \]

Thus, the first mixture costs $3 more than the second mixture.

**Final Answer:**
The first mixture costs $3 more than the second mixture.
