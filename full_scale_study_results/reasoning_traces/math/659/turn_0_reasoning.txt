==================================================

First, we need to calculate the cost of each mixture.

For the first mixture, we have 1/2 pound of almonds and 1/3 pound of walnuts. 

The cost of 1/2 pound of almonds is (1/2) * $10 = $5. 

The cost of 1/3 pound of walnuts is (1/3) * $15 = $5. 

So, the total cost of the first mixture is $5 + $5 = $10. 

For the second mixture, we have 1/5 pound of almonds and 1/3 pound of walnuts. 

The cost of 1/5 pound of almonds is (1/5) * $10 = $2. 

The cost of 1/3 pound of walnuts is the same as in the first mixture, which is $5. 

So, the total cost of the second mixture is $2 + $5 = $7. 

To find out how much more the first mixture costs than the second, we subtract the cost of the second mixture from the cost of the first mixture. 

So, $10 - $7 = $3. 

Therefore, the first mixture costs $3 more than the second mixture.
