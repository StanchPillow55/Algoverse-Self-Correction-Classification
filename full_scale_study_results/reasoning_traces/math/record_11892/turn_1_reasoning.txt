Question ID: record_11892
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine the missing word in the query.

Given information:
- Jermain Defoe is close to finalizing a permanent move to Sunderland.
- Alan Pardew admits he wanted to bring Defoe to Crystal Palace.
- Defoe played under Pardew at West Ham before moving to Tottenham.
- Pardew has backed Defoe to help Sunderland stave off relegation.

In the query, the placeholder "@placeholder" needs to be filled with the correct word.

Based on the context, the missing word is likely to be "Sunderland's", as Pardew acknowledges that Defoe's move to Sunderland could boost their firepower, and Sunderland is one of Palace's main rivals in the battle to avoid relegation.

Therefore, the complete query with the missing word filled in would be:

"Pardew was forced to admit the 55-cap forward could boost Sunderland's firepower, with the Black Cats one of Palace's main rivals in the battle to avoid the drop."
