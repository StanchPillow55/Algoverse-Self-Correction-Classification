Dataset Type: math
==================================================

Sofie plans to walk 10 miles every day for 7 days. So, the total distance Sofie will walk is:

10 miles/day * 7 days = 70 miles

Since the problem states that Sofie will walk twice as far as Brian, we can set up the following equation to find out how far Brian will walk:

2 * (Brian's distance) = Sofie's distance
2 * (Brian's distance) = 70 miles

To solve for Brian's distance, we divide both sides of the equation by 2:

(Brian's distance) = 70 miles / 2 = 35 miles

So, Brian will walk 35 miles in seven days.
