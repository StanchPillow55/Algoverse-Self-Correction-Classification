Dataset Type: math
==================================================

Sofie plans to walk 10 miles every day for 7 days. 

To find out how many miles Sofie will walk in 7 days, we multiply the number of miles she walks each day by the number of days. 

10 miles/day * 7 days = 70 miles

Sofie will walk 70 miles in 7 days. 

The problem states that Sofie will walk twice as far as Brian. 

To find out how many miles Brian will walk, we divide the number of miles Sofie walks by 2. 

70 miles / 2 = 35 miles

Therefore, Brian will walk 35 miles in seven days.
