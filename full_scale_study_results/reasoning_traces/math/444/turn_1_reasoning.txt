Question ID: 444
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to convert all the movie lengths to the same unit of measurement. Since the final answer is asked in minutes, we will convert all the lengths to minutes.

First, we know that Movie C is 1.25 hours long. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so we multiply 1.25 hours by 60 to convert it to minutes:

1.25 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 75 minutes

So, Movie C is 75 minutes long.

Next, we know that Movie B is 5 minutes longer than Movie C. So, we add 5 minutes to the length of Movie C to find the length of Movie B:

75 minutes (Movie C) + 5 minutes = 80 minutes

So, Movie B is 80 minutes long.

Finally, we know that Movie A is one-fourth the length of Movie B. So, we divide the length of Movie B by 4 to find the length of Movie A:

80 minutes (Movie B) / 4 = 20 minutes

So, Movie A is 20 minutes long.

Therefore, the final answer is that Movie A is 20 minutes long.
