Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to convert the length of Movie C from hours to minutes because the length of Movie B is given in minutes and we are asked to find the length of Movie A in minutes. 

We know that 1 hour is equal to 60 minutes. So, 1.25 hours is equal to 1.25 * 60 = 75 minutes. 

Movie B is 5 minutes longer than Movie C, so Movie B is 75 minutes + 5 minutes = 80 minutes long.

Movie A is one-fourth the length of Movie B. So, Movie A is 1/4 * 80 minutes = 20 minutes long.

Therefore, Movie A is 20 minutes long.
