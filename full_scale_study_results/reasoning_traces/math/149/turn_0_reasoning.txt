==================================================

Let's denote the number of Facebook friends that Dorothy has as \( D \).

According to the problem, we know the following:

1. Charlie has three times as many Facebook friends as Dorothy:
   \[
   C = 3D
   \]
   where \( C \) is the number of friends Charlie has.

2. James has four times as many friends on Facebook as Dorothy:
   \[
   J = 4D
   \]
   where \( J \) is the number of friends James has.

We are also given that Charlie has 12 friends on Facebook:
\[
C = 12
\]

Now, we can substitute the value of \( C \) into the equation \( C = 3D \):
\[
12 = 3D
\]

To find \( D \), we can solve for \( D \) by dividing both sides of the equation by 3:
\[
D = \frac{12}{3} = 4
\]

Now that we know Dorothy has 4 friends, we can find out how many friends James has using the equation \( J = 4D \):
\[
J = 4D = 4 \times 4 = 16
\]

Thus, James has 16 friends on Facebook.

Finally, we can state the answer:
\[
\text{James has } 16 \text{ friends on Facebook.}
\]
