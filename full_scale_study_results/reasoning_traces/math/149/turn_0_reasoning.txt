Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to find out how many Facebook friends Dorothy has. Since Charlie has three times as many Facebook friends as Dorothy, and Charlie has 12 friends, we can set up the equation:

3D = 12

where D represents the number of Dorothy's Facebook friends. Solving for D, we get:

D = 12 / 3
D = 4

So, Dorothy has 4 Facebook friends.

Next, we need to find out how many Facebook friends James has. Since James has four times as many friends on Facebook as Dorothy, and Dorothy has 4 friends, we can set up the equation:

J = 4D

where J represents the number of James's Facebook friends. Substituting D = 4 into the equation, we get:

J = 4 * 4
J = 16

So, James has 16 Facebook friends. 

Therefore, the final answer is that James has 16 Facebook friends.
