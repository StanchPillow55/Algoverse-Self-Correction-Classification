Dataset Type: math
==================================================

Marcy becomes entitled to 5% of the value of the pension per year after 20 years. This means that for the next 10 years (from year 20 to year 30), she will be accumulating an additional 5% of the pension value each year.

Let's calculate how much this will be:

5% of $50,000 is $2,500. 

So, each year for 10 years, she will be accumulating an additional $2,500 to her annual pension. 

Let's calculate the total increase over 10 years:

$2,500/year * 10 years = $25,000

So, if Marcy quits after 30 years, her annual pension will be the original $50,000 plus the additional $25,000 she accumulated over the 10 years.

$50,000 + $25,000 = $75,000

So, Marcy's annual pension will be $75,000 if she quits after 30 years.
