==================================================

To solve this problem, we first need to understand that Marcy becomes entitled to 5% of the value of the pension per year starting after 20 years. This means that for each year she works beyond 20 years, her pension increases by 5% of the original $50,000.

First, let's calculate how many years Marcy works beyond the 20-year mark. If she quits after 30 years, then she works for 10 years beyond the 20-year mark.

Next, we need to calculate the total increase in her pension over these 10 years. Each year, her pension increases by 5% of $50,000, which is $2,500. Over 10 years, this amounts to a total increase of $2,500 * 10 = $25,000.

Finally, we add this increase to the original pension amount to find Marcy's annual pension if she quits after 30 years. The original pension amount is $50,000, so her annual pension will be $50,000 + $25,000 = $75,000.

So, if Marcy quits after 30 years, her annual pension will be $75,000.
