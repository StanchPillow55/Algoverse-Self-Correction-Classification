==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to understand that Marcy becomes entitled to 5% of the value of the pension per year starting after 20 years. This means that for every year after the 20th year, her pension increases by 5% of the original amount, which is $50,000.

First, let's calculate how many years Marcy will be receiving this 5% increase. If she quits after 30 years, then she will have been receiving the increase for 30 - 20 = 10 years.

Next, we need to calculate the total increase over these 10 years. Since the increase is 5% per year, the total increase over 10 years will be 5% * 10 = 50%.

Now, we need to calculate what this 50% increase means in terms of the original pension amount. 50% of $50,000 is $50,000 * 0.50 = $25,000.

Finally, we add this increase to the original pension amount to find Marcy's annual pension if she quits after 30 years. So, $50,000 + $25,000 = $75,000.

Therefore, if Marcy quits after 30 years, her annual pension will be $75,000.
