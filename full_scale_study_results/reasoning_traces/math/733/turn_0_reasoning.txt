Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

Greg found $20 and decided to split it equally among himself and his 3 siblings. This means the money will be divided among 4 people (Greg and his 3 siblings).

To find out how much each person gets, we divide the total amount of money by the number of people.

So, $20 รท 4 = $5

Therefore, each person (Greg and each of his 3 siblings) gets $5.
