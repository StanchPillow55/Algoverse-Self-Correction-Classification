Question ID: record_60766
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, I will need to determine the missing word in the query. Based on the context provided in the passage, the missing word is likely to be "Chelsea" or "the Chelsea team".

Let's break down the reasoning step-by-step:

1. The passage discusses Chelsea's signing of the Brazilian midfielder Ramires from Benfica for a fee of 20 million euros.
2. The passage states that Chelsea manager Carlo Ancelotti described Ramires as "a fantastic player, a fantastic midfielder" and that he is "very young and will be the future of the Brazilian national team".
3. The query continues this sentiment, stating that Ancelotti "hopes he will be the future of @placeholder".
4. Given the context of Chelsea signing Ramires, the most logical missing word in the query is "Chelsea" or "the Chelsea team".

Therefore, the complete query with the missing word filled in is:

"He is very young and will be the future of the Brazilian national team, and I hope he will be the future of the Chelsea team."
