==================================================

To solve this problem, we first need to calculate how much each coach spent on their respective sports balls.

The baseball coach bought 9 baseballs for $3 each. To find out how much he spent, we multiply the number of baseballs by the cost of each baseball:

9 baseballs * $3/ball = $27

The basketball coach bought 8 basketballs for $14 each. To find out how much she spent, we multiply the number of basketballs by the cost of each basketball:

8 basketballs * $14/ball = $112

Now, to find out how much more the basketball coach spent than the baseball coach, we subtract the amount the baseball coach spent from the amount the basketball coach spent:

$112 - $27 = $85

So, the basketball coach spent $85 more than the baseball coach.
