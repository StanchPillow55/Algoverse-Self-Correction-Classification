Question ID: 52
Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to determine how much weight Uriah has already removed by taking out 30 comic books. Since each comic book weighs 1/4 pound, we multiply the number of comic books by the weight of each one:

30 comic books * 1/4 pound/comic book = 7.5 pounds

So, Uriah has already removed 7.5 pounds from his book bag.

He needs to remove 15 pounds in total, so we subtract the weight he has already removed from the total weight he needs to remove:

15 pounds - 7.5 pounds = 7.5 pounds

So, Uriah still needs to remove 7.5 pounds from his book bag.

Since each toy weighs 1/2 pound, we divide the remaining weight he needs to remove by the weight of each toy to find out how many toys he needs to remove:

7.5 pounds / 1/2 pound/toy = 15 toys

So, Uriah needs to remove 15 toys from his book bag.

Final Answer: Uriah needs to remove 15 toys from his book bag.
