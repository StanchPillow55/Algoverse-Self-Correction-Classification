Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine how many toys Uriah needs to remove from his book bag after removing 30 comic books to achieve a total weight reduction of 15 pounds.

**Step 1: Calculate the weight removed by the comic books.**

Each comic book weighs \( \frac{1}{4} \) pound. If Uriah removes 30 comic books, the total weight removed from the comic books is:

\[
30 \times \frac{1}{4} = \frac{30}{4} = 7.5 \text{ pounds}
\]

**Step 2: Determine the remaining weight that needs to be removed.**

Uriah needs to remove a total of 15 pounds. After removing the comic books, he has already removed 7.5 pounds. Therefore, the remaining weight that needs to be removed is:

\[
15 - 7.5 = 7.5 \text{ pounds}
\]

**Step 3: Calculate the number of toys to remove.**

Each toy weighs \( \frac{1}{2} \) pound. To find out how many toys need to be removed to achieve the remaining 7.5 pounds, we set up the equation:

\[
\frac{1}{2} \times \text{number of toys} = 7.5
\]

To solve for the number of toys, divide both sides by \( \frac{1}{2} \):

\[
\text{number of toys} = \frac{7.5}{\frac{1}{2}} = 7.5 \times 2 = 15
\]

**Final Answer:**

Uriah needs to remove 15 toys to achieve a total weight reduction of 15 pounds.
