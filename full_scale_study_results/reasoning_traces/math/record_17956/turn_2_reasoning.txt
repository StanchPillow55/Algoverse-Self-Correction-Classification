Question ID: record_17956
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, I need to fill in the missing information in the query based on the given passage.

The passage mentions that "family groups were also being sent by the federal government to Arizona, a process that has outraged Arizona lawmakers, including Gov. Jan Brewer."

Therefore, the missing placeholder in the query should be filled with "Arizona".

The complete query with the placeholder filled in is:

"Separate from unaccompanied children being sent to the state, family groups were also being sent by the federal government to Arizona, a process that has outraged Arizona lawmakers, including Gov."

My final answer is:

Arizona
