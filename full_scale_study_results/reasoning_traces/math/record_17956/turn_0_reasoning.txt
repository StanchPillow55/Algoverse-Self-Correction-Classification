==================================================

To solve this problem, I need to identify the missing information in the query and fill in the appropriate placeholder.

The passage mentions that "family groups were also being sent by the federal government to @placeholder, a process that has outraged Arizona lawmakers, including Gov."

Based on the information provided in the passage, the missing placeholder is "Arizona".

The passage states that "Unlike a Mexican immigrant who arrives to the United States, a Central American immigrant cannot be processed as quickly because of proximity to their native country. Homeland Security is prohibited from immediately deporting the children if they are not from Canada or Mexico, causing the backlog of immigrants in U.S. detention centers."

This indicates that the federal government was transferring unaccompanied children and family groups from Texas to Arizona, which has outraged Arizona lawmakers, including Governor Jan Brewer.

Therefore, the complete answer is:

The federal government was transferring family groups to Arizona, a process that has outraged Arizona lawmakers, including Gov. Jan Brewer.
