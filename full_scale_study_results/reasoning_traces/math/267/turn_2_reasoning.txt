Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to find out how long it takes for the oil to heat up to the desired temperature of 400 degrees. We know it takes 20 minutes to heat up to 300 degrees and that it takes 40% longer to heat up to 400 degrees.

To find out how much longer it takes, we calculate 40% of 20 minutes:

0.40 * 20 minutes = 8 minutes

So, it takes an additional 8 minutes to heat up to 400 degrees. Adding this to the initial 20 minutes, we get:

20 minutes + 8 minutes = 28 minutes

So, it takes 28 minutes in total to heat the oil to 400 degrees.

Next, we know that it takes 5 minutes less to cook the chicken than it took to heat the oil. So, we subtract 5 minutes from the time it took to heat the oil:

28 minutes - 5 minutes = 23 minutes

So, it takes 23 minutes to cook the chicken.

Finally, to find out how much time passes from starting the oil to having cooked chicken, we add the time it took to heat the oil and the time it took to cook the chicken:

28 minutes (heating oil) + 23 minutes (cooking chicken) = 51 minutes

So, it takes 51 minutes from starting the oil to having cooked chicken.

Final Answer: It takes 51 minutes from starting the oil to having cooked chicken.
