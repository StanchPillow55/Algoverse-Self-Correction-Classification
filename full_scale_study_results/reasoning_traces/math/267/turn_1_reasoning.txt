Step 1: Calculate the time it takes for the oil to heat up to 400 degrees.

We know that it takes 20 minutes for the oil to heat up to 300 degrees. It then takes 40% longer for the oil to heat up to the desired temperature of 400 degrees. 

To find out how much longer it takes, we calculate 40% of 20 minutes:

0.40 * 20 minutes = 8 minutes

So, it takes an additional 8 minutes to heat the oil from 300 to 400 degrees.

Adding this to the original 20 minutes, we find that it takes 20 minutes + 8 minutes = 28 minutes to heat the oil to 400 degrees.

Step 2: Calculate the time it takes to cook the chicken.

We know that it takes 5 minutes less time to cook the chicken than it took to warm up the oil. 

So, the cooking time is 28 minutes - 5 minutes = 23 minutes.

Step 3: Calculate the total time from starting the oil to having cooked chicken.

To find the total time, we add the time it took to heat the oil to the time it took to cook the chicken:

28 minutes (to heat the oil) + 23 minutes (to cook the chicken) = 51 minutes

So, it takes 51 minutes from starting the oil to having cooked chicken. 

Final Answer: It takes 51 minutes from starting the oil to having cooked chicken.
