==================================================

First, we need to find out how long it takes for the oil to heat up to 400 degrees. We know it takes 20 minutes to heat up to 300 degrees, and it takes 40% longer to heat up to 400 degrees. 

To find out how much longer it takes, we calculate 40% of 20 minutes:

20 minutes * 0.40 = 8 minutes

So it takes an additional 8 minutes to heat up to 400 degrees. Adding this to the original 20 minutes, we find that it takes:

20 minutes + 8 minutes = 28 minutes to heat up to 400 degrees.

Next, we know that it takes 5 minutes less to cook the chicken than it took to heat the oil. So, we subtract 5 minutes from the time it took to heat the oil:

28 minutes - 5 minutes = 23 minutes to cook the chicken.

Finally, to find out the total time from starting the oil to having cooked chicken, we add the time it took to heat the oil and the time it took to cook the chicken:

28 minutes (to heat the oil) + 23 minutes (to cook the chicken) = 51 minutes.

So, it takes 51 minutes from starting the oil to having cooked chicken.
