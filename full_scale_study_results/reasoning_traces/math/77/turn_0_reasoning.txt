First, let's find out how much laundry Raymond and David do.

According to the problem, Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah. If Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry, then Raymond does 400/2 = 200 pounds of laundry.

The problem also states that Sarah does 4 times as much laundry as David. If Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry, then David does 400/4 = 100 pounds of laundry.

Now, we need to calculate the difference in the amount of laundry Raymond and David do. The difference is calculated by subtracting the smaller number from the larger number. In this case, we subtract the amount of laundry David does from the amount Raymond does: 200 - 100 = 100 pounds.

So, the difference in the amount of laundry Raymond and David do is 100 pounds.
