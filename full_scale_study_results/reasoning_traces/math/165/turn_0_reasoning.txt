==================================================

Elvira's total budget is €1500. 

First, we need to calculate the total cost of the computer and accessories. 

The cost of the computer, screen, keyboard, and mouse is €1090. 

The cost of the scanner is €157. 

The cost of the CD burner is €74. 

The cost of the printer is €102. 

We add these costs together to find the total cost of the computer and accessories. 

€1090 (computer, screen, keyboard, mouse) + €157 (scanner) + €74 (CD burner) + €102 (printer) = €1423

So, the total cost of the computer and accessories is €1423. 

To find out how much money Elvira has left for clothing, we subtract the total cost of the computer and accessories from her total budget. 

€1500 (total budget) - €1423 (total cost of computer and accessories) = €77

So, Elvira will have €77 left for her clothing.
