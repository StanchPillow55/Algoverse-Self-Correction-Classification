Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to figure out how many scoops of mashed potatoes Gomer ate. The problem states that he ate 5 less than 23 scoops. So, we subtract 5 from 23:

23 - 5 = 18 scoops of mashed potatoes.

Next, we need to figure out how many potatoes it takes to make 1 scoop of mashed potatoes. The problem states that it takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops. So, we subtract 3 from 6 to find out how many potatoes it takes:

6 - 3 = 3 potatoes.

Then, we subtract 1 from 3 to find out how many scoops those potatoes make:

3 - 1 = 2 scoops.

So, it takes 3 potatoes to make 2 scoops of mashed potatoes. To find out how many potatoes it takes to make 1 scoop, we divide the number of potatoes by the number of scoops:

3 potatoes / 2 scoops = 1.5 potatoes per scoop.

Finally, we multiply the number of scoops Gomer ate by the number of potatoes per scoop to find out how many potatoes Gomer ate:

18 scoops * 1.5 potatoes per scoop = 27 potatoes.

So, Gomer ate 27 potatoes.
