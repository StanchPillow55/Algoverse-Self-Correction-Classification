==================================================

First, we need to determine how many boxes Nik will need. Since he wants to put 8 crayons in each box, we divide the total number of crayons by the number of crayons per box.

200 crayons รท 8 crayons/box = 25 boxes

Next, we need to calculate the total weight of the crayons. Since each crayon weighs 1 ounce, the total weight of the crayons is equal to the number of crayons.

200 crayons * 1 ounce/crayon = 200 ounces

Then, we need to calculate the total weight of the boxes. Since each box weighs 8 ounces, the total weight of the boxes is equal to the number of boxes times the weight of each box.

25 boxes * 8 ounces/box = 200 ounces

Now, we add the total weight of the crayons and the total weight of the boxes to find the total weight in ounces.

200 ounces (crayons) + 200 ounces (boxes) = 400 ounces

Finally, we need to convert the total weight from ounces to pounds. Since there are 16 ounces in a pound, we divide the total weight in ounces by the number of ounces per pound.

400 ounces รท 16 ounces/pound = 25 pounds

So, the total weight of the crayons and the boxes is 25 pounds.
