Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine the missing word in the given sentence.

Given sentence:
"Those issues and others have assured that the former Nebraska senator's path to the @placeholder won't be easy."

Based on the context provided in the passage, the missing word is likely to be "confirmation" or "nomination".

Let's go through the reasoning step-by-step:

1. The passage discusses the nomination of Chuck Hagel as the U.S. defense secretary by President Obama.
2. The passage mentions that Hagel's nomination has faced criticism and opposition from some Republicans due to his positions on various issues.
3. The sentence states that "those issues and others have assured that the former Nebraska senator's path to the @placeholder won't be easy."
4. The missing word is likely to be "confirmation" or "nomination" because the passage is discussing Hagel's nomination as the defense secretary, and the challenges he faces in getting confirmed for the position.

Therefore, the final answer is:

Those issues and others have assured that the former Nebraska senator's path to the confirmation/nomination won't be easy.
