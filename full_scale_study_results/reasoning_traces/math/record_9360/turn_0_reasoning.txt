==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine the missing word in the given sentence.

Given information:
- The sentence states that "Those issues and others have assured that the former Nebraska senator's path to the @placeholder won't be easy."
- The context suggests that the missing word is related to the position of U.S. defense secretary, as mentioned in the passage.

Reasoning:
Based on the information provided in the passage, the missing word is likely "confirmation" or "nomination" to the position of U.S. defense secretary.

The passage mentions that Chuck Hagel, the former Nebraska senator, has been nominated by President Barack Obama to succeed Leon Panetta as the U.S. defense secretary. However, the passage also indicates that Hagel's path to this position "won't be easy" due to the issues and criticisms surrounding his views on various topics.

Therefore, the missing word in the sentence is likely "confirmation" or "nomination".

Final answer:
Those issues and others have assured that the former Nebraska senator's path to the confirmation (or nomination) won't be easy.
