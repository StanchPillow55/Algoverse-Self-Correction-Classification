==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine the missing word in the given sentence.

Given sentence:
"Those issues and others have assured that the former Nebraska senator's path to the @placeholder won't be easy."

Based on the context provided in the passage, the missing word is likely to be "confirmation" or "nomination".

Reasoning:
1. The passage discusses Chuck Hagel's nomination as the U.S. defense secretary by President Obama.
2. The passage mentions that Hagel's nomination has faced criticism and opposition from some Republicans due to his positions on various issues.
3. The sentence suggests that Hagel's path to a certain position won't be easy, which implies that the missing word is likely to be related to his nomination or confirmation process.

Therefore, the most appropriate word to fill the @placeholder is "confirmation".

Final answer:
"Those issues and others have assured that the former Nebraska senator's path to the confirmation won't be easy."
