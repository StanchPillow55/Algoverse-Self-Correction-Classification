==================================================

First, we need to calculate the total number of petals Rose initially picked. 

She picked 3 flowers with 5 petals each, which gives 3*5 = <<3*5=15>>15 petals.

She picked 4 flowers with 6 petals each, which gives 4*6 = <<4*6=24>>24 petals.

She picked 5 flowers with 4 petals each, which gives 5*4 = <<5*4=20>>20 petals.

She picked 6 flowers with 7 petals each, which gives 6*7 = <<6*7=42>>42 petals.

Adding these together, she initially picked 15 + 24 + 20 + 42 = <<15+24+20+42=101>>101 petals.

However, she dropped 1 of each flower, so we need to subtract the petals from the flowers she dropped.

She dropped 1 flower with 5 petals, 1 flower with 6 petals, 1 flower with 4 petals, and 1 flower with 7 petals. This totals to 5 + 6 + 4 + 7 = <<5+6+4+7=22>>22 petals.

Subtracting the petals from the flowers she dropped from the total number of petals she initially picked gives 101 - 22 = <<101-22=79>>79 petals.

Therefore, there are 79 petals in total on the flowers in the vase.
