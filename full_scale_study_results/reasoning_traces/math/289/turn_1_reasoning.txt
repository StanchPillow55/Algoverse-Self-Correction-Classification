Question ID: 289
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

The car in the fast lane is traveling at 60 miles/hour and covers a total distance of 480 miles. To find out how long it took for the car in the fast lane to cover this distance, we can use the formula:

Time = Distance / Speed

So for the car in the fast lane, the time taken is:

Time = 480 miles / 60 miles/hour = 8 hours

The car in the slow lane is traveling at half the speed of the car in the fast lane, so its speed is:

Slow lane speed = 60 miles/hour / 2 = 30 miles/hour

To find out how long it took for the car in the slow lane to cover the same distance of 480 miles, we can use the same formula:

Time = Distance / Speed

So for the car in the slow lane, the time taken is:

Time = 480 miles / 30 miles/hour = 16 hours

So, the car in the slow lane took 16 hours to cover the same distance of 480 miles.
