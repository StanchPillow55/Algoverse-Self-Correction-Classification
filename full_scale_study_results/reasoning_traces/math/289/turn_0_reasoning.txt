Dataset Type: math
==================================================

The car in the fast lane is traveling at 60 miles/hour and it covered a total of 480 miles. To find out how long it took for the car in the fast lane to cover this distance, we can use the formula:

Time = Distance / Speed

So, the time it took for the car in the fast lane is:

Time = 480 miles / 60 miles/hour = 8 hours

The car in the slow lane is traveling at half the speed of the car in the fast lane, so its speed is:

Speed = 60 miles/hour / 2 = 30 miles/hour

We want to find out how long it took for the car in the slow lane to cover the same distance of 480 miles. We can use the same formula:

Time = Distance / Speed

So, the time it took for the car in the slow lane is:

Time = 480 miles / 30 miles/hour = 16 hours

Therefore, it took the car in the slow lane 16 hours to cover the same distance of 480 miles.
