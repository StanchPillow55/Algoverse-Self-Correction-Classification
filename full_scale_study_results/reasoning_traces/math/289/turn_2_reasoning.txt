Question ID: 289
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

The speed of the car in the fast lane is 60 miles/hour, and it covered a distance of 480 miles. The time it took can be calculated using the formula:

Time = Distance / Speed

So, the time for the fast car is:

Time = 480 miles / 60 miles/hour = 8 hours

The car in the slow lane is traveling at half the speed of the fast car, which is 60 miles/hour / 2 = 30 miles/hour.

To find out how long it took the slow car to travel the same distance, we use the same formula:

Time = Distance / Speed

So, the time for the slow car is:

Time = 480 miles / 30 miles/hour = 16 hours

Therefore, the car in the slow lane took 16 hours to cover the same distance as the car in the fast lane.
