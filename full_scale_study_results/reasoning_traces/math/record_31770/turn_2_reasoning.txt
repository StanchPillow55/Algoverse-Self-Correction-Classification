==================================================

Okay, let's break down this problem step-by-step:

Given information:
- Mitt Romney, the former Republican presidential nominee, is scheduled to attend a rally with Thom Tillis, the Republican Senate nominee in North Carolina, next week.
- Sources indicate that Romney is not actively pursuing a third presidential bid, but is listening to people who want him to run again.
- Another source close to Romney said, "I wouldn't bet on it, but I wouldn't bet either," regarding Romney running for president again.

To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given information and provide a final answer on the likelihood of Romney running for president again.

Step 1: Evaluate Romney's involvement in the Tillis campaign rally.
The fact that Romney is attending a rally with Tillis suggests that he is still engaged in Republican politics and supporting Republican candidates. This could be seen as a sign that he is keeping his options open for a potential future run for president.

Step 2: Consider the sources' comments on Romney's interest in a third presidential bid.
The sources indicate that Romney is not actively pursuing a third presidential bid, but is listening to people who want him to run again.
