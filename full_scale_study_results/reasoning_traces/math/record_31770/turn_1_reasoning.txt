Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

Okay, let's try to solve this problem step-by-step:

1. The passage provides information about Mitt Romney's upcoming visit to North Carolina to campaign with Republican Senate nominee Thom Tillis. It states that Romney won North Carolina in the 2012 general election.

2. The passage also mentions that GOP officials believe Tillis has closed the gap in his race against incumbent Sen. Kay Hagan. Tillis allies believe they have gained some support following the controversy surrounding Hagan admitting she missed a classified briefing on ISIS and other security threats to attend a fundraiser.

3. The query asks about another source close to @placeholder, who said "I wouldn't bet on it, but I wouldn't bet either."

4. However, the passage does not provide any information about @placeholder or the source's statement. The query seems to be asking about something not directly covered in the passage.

Without any additional context or information provided in the passage, I do not have enough information to solve this problem. The query appears to be referring to something not explicitly mentioned in the given text.

Therefore, my final answer is: I cannot provide a complete solution to this problem based on the information
