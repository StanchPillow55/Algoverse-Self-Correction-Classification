Question ID: record_28148
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given information and determine the final answer.

Given information:
- Two separate militant assaults occurred in the southeastern Afghan province of Paktika.
- The attacks led to the deaths of two U.S. soldiers and at least 42 insurgents.
- The first attack involved the Taliban detonating a truck full of explosives and then attacking a base with missiles and rockets.
- The military responded by sending in aircraft and dropping bombs, killing 32 Taliban fighters and wounding many.
- Seven of the wounded Taliban fighters were arrested.
- The second attack was on a combat outpost in Paktika province, where 10 militants were killed.

The question asks whether a spokesman claimed responsibility for the attack in a phone call to a CNN stringer in Kabul.

To answer this, we need to look for any information in the passage that mentions a spokesman claiming responsibility for the attack.

The passage does not mention a spokesman claiming responsibility for the attack. It only provides details about the attacks and the casualties on both sides.

Therefore, the final answer is:
No, the passage does not state that a spokesman claimed responsibility for the attack
