==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given information and determine the final answer.

Given information:
- Two separate militant assaults in the southeastern Afghan province of Paktika led to the deaths of two U.S. soldiers and at least 42 insurgents.
- The first attack involved the Taliban detonating a truck full of explosives and then attacking the base with missiles and rockets.
- The military responded by sending in aircraft and dropping bombs, killing 32 Taliban fighters and wounding many.
- Seven of the wounded Taliban fighters were arrested.
- The query states that a spokesman claimed responsibility for the attack in a phone call to a CNN stringer in Kabul.

Step 1: Determine the total number of insurgents killed.
Total insurgents killed = 32 (killed in the military response) + 10 (killed during the assault on a combat outpost) = 42 insurgents

Step 2: Determine the final answer.
The final answer is that a Taliban spokesman claimed responsibility for the attack in a phone call to a CNN stringer in Kabul.

Therefore, the complete answer is:
A Taliban spokesman claimed responsibility for the attack
