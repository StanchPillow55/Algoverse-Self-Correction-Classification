Question ID: 521
Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, let's find out how many problems Chris completed on Tuesday. Since he completed 3 times as many problems as he did on Monday, and he completed 12 problems on Monday, he completed 3 * 12 = <<3*12=36>>36 problems on Tuesday.

So, on Monday and Tuesday together, Chris completed 12 + 36 = <<12+36=48>>48 problems.

This means that after Tuesday, Chris had 100 - 48 = <<100-48=52>>52 problems left.

On Wednesday, Chris completed one-quarter of the remaining problems. So, he completed 52 / 4 = <<52/4=13>>13 problems on Wednesday.

After Wednesday, Chris therefore had 52 - 13 = <<52-13=39>>39 problems left.

So, Chris has 39 math problems left to complete on Thursday.
