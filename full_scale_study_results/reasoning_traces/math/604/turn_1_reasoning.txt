Question ID: 604
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

Let's break down the problem step by step.

On Monday, Howard spends $8 at the arcade.

On Tuesday, he spends twice as much as he did on Monday. Since he spent $8 on Monday, twice that amount would be 2 * $8 = $16.

On Wednesday, he spends 4 times as much as he spent on Tuesday. Since he spent $16 on Tuesday, four times that amount would be 4 * $16 = $64.

So, in total, Howard has spent $8 (Monday) + $16 (Tuesday) + $64 (Wednesday) = $88 at the arcade.

He originally had $100. If he spent $88, then he would have $100 - $88 = $12 left.

So, Howard has $12 left.
