Question ID: 604
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

Let's break down the problem step by step.

On Monday, Howard spends $8 at the arcade.

On Tuesday, he spends twice as much as he did on Monday. This means he spends 2 * $8 = $16.

On Wednesday, he spends 4 times as much as he spent on Tuesday. This means he spends 4 * $16 = $64.

So, in total, Howard spends $8 (Monday) + $16 (Tuesday) + $64 (Wednesday) = $88.

Howard originally had $100. After spending $88 at the arcade, he has $100 - $88 = $12 left.

So, Howard has $12 left.
