Dataset Type: math
==================================================

The first step is to calculate the 25% fee on the original grocery bill. 

25% of $40.00 is calculated as follows:
$40.00 * 25/100 = $10.00

So, the 25% fee adds $10.00 to the bill. 

Next, we add the delivery fee and the tip to the original grocery bill and the 25% fee. 

$40.00 (original grocery bill) + $10.00 (25% fee) + $3.00 (delivery fee) + $4.00 (tip) = $57.00

So, the final price of Stephen's groceries, after all the extra fees, is $57.00.
