Question ID: 58
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to calculate the 25% fee on the initial bill of $40.00. To do this, we multiply the initial bill by 25% (or 0.25 in decimal form):

$40.00 * 0.25 = $10.00

This means the delivery vendor added a $10.00 fee to Stephen's bill.

Next, we add this fee to the initial bill:

$40.00 (initial bill) + $10.00 (25% fee) = $50.00

Then, we add the $3.00 delivery fee:

$50.00 + $3.00 = $53.00

Finally, we add the $4.00 tip:

$53.00 + $4.00 = $57.00

So, after all the extra fees, the final price of Stephen's groceries was $57.00.
