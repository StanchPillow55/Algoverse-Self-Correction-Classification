==================================================

Let's solve this problem step by step.

Step 1: Calculate how many pieces Tobias ate on the first day.
Tobias ate 2/5 of the pizza on the first day. Since the pizza has 60 pieces, we can calculate this as follows:
2/5 * 60 = 24 pieces

Step 2: Subtract the pieces eaten on the first day from the total.
After the first day, Tobias has 60 - 24 = 36 pieces left.

Step 3: Subtract the pieces eaten on the second day from the remaining total.
Tobias ate 10 pieces on the second day, so he has 36 - 10 = 26 pieces left after the second day.

Step 4: Calculate how many pieces Tobias ate on the third day.
Tobias ate 7/13 of the remaining pizza on the third day. We can calculate this as follows:
7/13 * 26 = 14 pieces

Step 5: Add up all the pieces Tobias has eaten.
Tobias has eaten 24 pieces on the first day, 10 pieces on the second day, and 14 pieces on the third day. So, in total, he has eaten 24 + 10 + 14 = 48 pieces.

So, Tobias has eaten 48 pieces of pizza so far.
