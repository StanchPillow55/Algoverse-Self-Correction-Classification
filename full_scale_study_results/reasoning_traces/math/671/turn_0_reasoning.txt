Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to calculate the total cost of the candies Adam bought. 

The cost of type A candies is 7 (the number of candies) times $0.5 (the cost of one candy), which equals $3.5.

The cost of type B candies is 10 (the number of candies) times $0.75 (the cost of one candy), which equals $7.5.

Adding these two amounts together, we find that Adam spent a total of $3.5 + $7.5 = $11 on candies.

Adam gave the cashier $15, so to find out how much change he got, we subtract the total cost of the candies from the amount he gave the cashier. 

So, $15 - $11 = $4.

Therefore, Adam got $4 in change.
