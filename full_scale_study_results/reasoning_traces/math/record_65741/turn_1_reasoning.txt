==================================================

To solve this problem, I will need to analyze the given passage and determine the appropriate word to fill in the placeholder.

The passage discusses the election of Enrique Pena Nieto as the President of Mexico and the concerns that his victory could lead to the Mexican government negotiating with the country's brutal drug lords in an effort to buy peace.

The passage states that Pena Nieto's campaign team claimed victory, but critics have warned that his victory could mark a softening of the country's war on drug cartels. It also mentions that Pena Nieto had campaigned on switching authorities' efforts to reducing violence rather than smashing the drug lords.

Given this context, the most appropriate word to fill the placeholder is "government". The passage suggests that the new Mexican government under Pena Nieto may be willing to negotiate with the drug lords, rather than continuing the previous administration's hardline approach.

Therefore, the complete sentence would be:

"The government is tough, but they won't let the drug violence get out of control."
