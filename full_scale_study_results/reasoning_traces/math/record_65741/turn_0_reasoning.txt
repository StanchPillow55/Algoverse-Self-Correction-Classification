==================================================

To solve this problem, I need to determine the appropriate word to fill in the @placeholder in the given sentence.

Given information:
- Enrique Pena Nieto, the newly elected President of Mexico, is from the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI).
- Pena Nieto's campaign team claimed victory in the presidential election, but critics have warned that his victory could mark a softening of the country's war on drug cartels.
- Pena Nieto had campaigned on switching authorities' efforts to reducing violence rather than smashing the drug lords.
- Mexican drug cartels are responsible for nearly 50,000 deaths so far.

Based on the information provided, the appropriate word to fill in the @placeholder is "government".

Reasoning:
1. The passage suggests that Pena Nieto's victory could lead to the Mexican government negotiating with drug lords in an attempt to buy peace, rather than continuing the country's war on drug cartels.
2. The passage also mentions that critics have warned that Pena Nieto's victory could mark a softening of the country's war on drug cartels.
3. Given the high number of deaths
