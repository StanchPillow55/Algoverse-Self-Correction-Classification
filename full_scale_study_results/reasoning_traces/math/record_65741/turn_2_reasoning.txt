==================================================

To solve this problem, I will need to analyze the given passage and determine the appropriate word to fill in the placeholder.

The passage discusses the election of Enrique Pena Nieto as the President of Mexico and the concerns that his victory could lead to a softening of the country's war on drug cartels. The passage mentions that Pena Nieto's campaign team claimed victory, but critics have warned that his victory could mark a softening of the country's war on drug cartels.

The placeholder in the given query is '@placeholder', and the full query is:
'The @placeholder is tough, but they won't let the drug violence get out of control.'

Based on the information provided in the passage, the most appropriate word to fill the placeholder would be "government" or "authorities".

The passage states that "Pena Nieto's campaign team claimed victory in the country's presidential election on Sunday after exit polls showed him winning by a comfortable margin. But critics have warned his victory could mark a softening of the country's war on drug cartels."

This suggests that the government or authorities under Pena Nieto's leadership are expected to take a softer approach towards the drug cart
