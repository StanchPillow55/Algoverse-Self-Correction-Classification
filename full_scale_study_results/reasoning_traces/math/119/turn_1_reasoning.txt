==================================================

Let's break down the problem step by step.

Step 1: Determine Lylah's salary four years ago.
The problem states that Adrien's salary was 30% higher than Lylah's. If Adrien was earning $40000, we can set up the equation:

1.3L = $40000

Solving for L (Lylah's salary), we get:

L = $40000 / 1.3 ≈ $30769.23

So, Lylah was earning approximately $30769.23 four years ago.

Step 2: Determine Adrien's and Lylah's salaries four years later.
The problem states that both Adrien's and Lylah's salaries increased simultaneously. Adrien's salary increased by 40% over the four years. So, his new salary is:

$40000 * 1.4 = $56000

Assuming Lylah's salary also increased by 40% (since the problem states their salaries increased simultaneously), her new salary would be:

$30769.23 * 1.4 ≈ $43056.92

Step 3: Calculate the total salary they were receiving four years later.
Adding Adrien's and Lylah's salaries together, we get:

$56000 + $43056.92 = $99056.92

So, four years later, they were receiving a total of approximately $99056.92.
