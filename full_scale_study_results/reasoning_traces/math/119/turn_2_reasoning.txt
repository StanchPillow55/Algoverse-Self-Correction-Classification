Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

Let's start by finding out how much Lylah was earning four years ago. If Adrien was earning 30% more than Lylah, and we know that Adrien's salary was $40000, we can set up the following equation to find Lylah's salary:

Adrien's Salary = Lylah's Salary + 30% of Lylah's Salary
$40000 = Lylah's Salary + 0.30 * Lylah's Salary
$40000 = 1.30 * Lylah's Salary

To find Lylah's salary, we divide both sides of the equation by 1.30:

Lylah's Salary = $40000 / 1.30 = $30769.23 (rounded to the nearest cent)

So, four years ago, Lylah was earning approximately $30769.23.

Four years later, both Adrien's and Lylah's salaries increased. Adrien was earning 40% more than what he was making four years ago. So, we can calculate his new salary as follows:

Adrien's New Salary = Adrien's Old Salary + 40% of Adrien's Old Salary
Adrien's New Salary = $40000 + 0.40 * $40000 = $56000

If Lylah's salary increased at the same rate, her new salary would be:

Lylah's New Salary = Lylah's Old Salary + 40% of Lylah's Old Salary
Lylah's New Salary = $30769.23 + 0.40 * $30769.23 = $43056.92 (rounded to the nearest cent)

So, four years later, Adrien was earning $56000 and Lylah was earning approximately $43056.92.

To find the total salary the two were receiving four years later, we simply add their salaries together:

Total Salary = Adrien's New Salary + Lylah's New Salary
Total Salary = $56000 + $43056.92 = $99056.92

So, four years later, Adrien and Lylah were receiving a total of approximately $99056.92.
