==================================================

The problem states that the tow truck pulled ten cars for each of the first three days. So, for the first three days, the total number of cars towed is 10 cars/day * 3 days = 30 cars.

Then, the tow truck pulled four fewer cars on each of the remaining days of the week. Since there are 7 days in a week, this means there are 7 - 3 = 4 remaining days. 

Four fewer cars than ten is 10 cars - 4 cars = 6 cars. 

So, for the remaining four days, the tow truck pulled 6 cars/day * 4 days = 24 cars.

Adding these two amounts together, the total number of cars the tow truck pulled that week is 30 cars + 24 cars = 54 cars.

So, the tow truck pulled a total of 54 cars that week.
