==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to fill in the missing placeholder in the given query.

Given information:
- The passage discusses Lionel Messi's performance in the World Cup.
- It mentions that Argentina fans still see Diego Maradona as their number one player.
- The query suggests that if the defenders can defend and the midfielders provide the ballast, then perhaps Messi can lead Argentina to their first World Cup triumph since 1986.

To find the missing placeholder, we need to determine who the subject of the query is, which is Messi.

Therefore, the final answer to the query is:

But if the defenders can defend and the midfielders provide the ballast, then perhaps Messi can lead them to their first World Cup triumph since 1986.

The reasoning is that the query is suggesting that if the team can provide the necessary support, Messi can lead Argentina to their first World Cup victory since 1986.
