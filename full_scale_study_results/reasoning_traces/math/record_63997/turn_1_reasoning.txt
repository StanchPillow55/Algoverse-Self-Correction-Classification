Question ID: record_63997
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to fill in the missing placeholder in the given query.

Given information:
- The passage mentions that Lionel Messi has made a blistering start to the World Cup, scoring four goals in the group stages.
- The Brazilian sports paper, Lance!, named Messi as the sixth greatest player ever.
- Argentina fans still see Diego Maradona as their number one player.
- The query suggests that if the defenders can defend and the midfielders provide the ballast, then perhaps Messi can lead Argentina to their first World Cup triumph since 1986.

Reasoning:
Based on the information provided in the passage, the missing placeholder in the query is likely referring to Lionel Messi. The passage discusses Messi's performance in the World Cup and suggests that if the team can support him, he can lead Argentina to their first World Cup triumph since 1986.

Therefore, the final answer is:

Messi can lead them to their first World Cup triumph since 1986.
