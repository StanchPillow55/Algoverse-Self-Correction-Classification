==================================================

To solve this problem, I will go through the given paragraph step-by-step and identify the four forms of electromagnetic energy mentioned.

Given information:
- Our sun and other stars release light energy.
- Scientists call the type of energy that our Sun and stars release electromagnetic energy.
- Electromagnetic energy includes the light we see.
- Electromagnetic energy also includes radio waves, microwaves, and X-rays.

Step 1: Identify the four forms of electromagnetic energy mentioned in the paragraph.
The four forms of electromagnetic energy mentioned in the paragraph are:
1. Light energy
2. Radio waves
3. Microwaves
4. X-rays

Step 2: Explain the reasoning behind the identification of these four forms of electromagnetic energy.
1. Light energy: The paragraph explicitly states that "Electromagnetic energy includes the light we see."
2. Radio waves: The paragraph mentions that "Electromagnetic energy includes radio waves."
3. Microwaves: The paragraph mentions that "Electromagnetic energy includes microwaves."
4. X-rays: The paragraph mentions that "Electromagnetic energy includes X-rays."

Therefore, the four forms of electromagnetic energy mentioned in the paragraph
