==================================================

To solve this problem, I will go through the given paragraph and identify the four forms of electromagnetic energy mentioned.

Given information:
- Our sun and other stars release light energy.
- Scientists call the type of energy that our Sun and stars release electromagnetic energy.
- Electromagnetic energy includes the light we see.
- Electromagnetic energy also includes radio waves, microwaves, and X-rays.

Step 1: Identify the four forms of electromagnetic energy mentioned in the paragraph.
The four forms of electromagnetic energy mentioned in the paragraph are:
1. Light energy
2. Radio waves
3. Microwaves
4. X-rays

Step 2: Explain the reasoning behind the answer.
The paragraph clearly states that electromagnetic energy includes the light we see, as well as radio waves, microwaves, and X-rays. These four forms of energy are explicitly mentioned as being part of the electromagnetic energy spectrum.

Final answer:
The four forms of electromagnetic energy are:
1. Light energy
2. Radio waves
3. Microwaves
4. X-rays
