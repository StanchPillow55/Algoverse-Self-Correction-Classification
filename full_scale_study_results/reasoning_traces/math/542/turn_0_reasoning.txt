==================================================

To solve this problem, we first need to calculate the total cost of the fruits that Verna bought.

The cost of the apples is 3 apples * $1.50/apple = $4.50
The cost of the oranges is 5 oranges * $0.80/orange = $4.00
The cost of the peaches is 6 peaches * $0.75/peach = $4.50

Adding these amounts together, we find that the total cost of the fruits is $4.50 (apples) + $4.00 (oranges) + $4.50 (peaches) = $13.00

Verna gave $20 to pay for the fruits. To find out how much change she received, we subtract the total cost of the fruits from the amount she gave. 

So, the change she received is $20.00 - $13.00 = $7.00

Therefore, Verna received $7.00 in change.
