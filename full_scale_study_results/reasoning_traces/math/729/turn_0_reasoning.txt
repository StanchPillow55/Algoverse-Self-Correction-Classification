Question ID: 729
Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to find out how many people had voted by midday. We know that 2/5 of the people had voted by then. So, we calculate 2/5 of 5000:

5000 * 2/5 = 2000 people

This means that 2000 people had voted by midday. To find out how many people were left, we subtract the number of people who had voted from the total number of people:

5000 - 2000 = 3000 people

So, 3000 people had not voted by midday.

Next, we need to find out how many of these remaining people had voted by 16:00. We know that 2/3 of the remaining people had voted by then. So, we calculate 2/3 of 3000:

3000 * 2/3 = 2000 people

This means that 2000 of the remaining people had voted by 16:00. To find out how many people were left, we subtract the number of people who had voted from the remaining number of people:

3000 - 2000 = 1000 people

So, 1000 people had not voted by 16:00.

Therefore, the number of people who had not voted by 16:00 is 1000.
