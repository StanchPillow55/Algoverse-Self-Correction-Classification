Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, let's calculate how many cups of lemonade Millie can make with her supplies. Since each pitcher holds 12 cups and she can make 3 pitchers, she can make 3 * 12 = <<3*12=36>>36 cups of lemonade.

Since she sells each cup for $1, she can make 36 * $1 = $<<36*1=36>>36 from selling all of the lemonade.

Her profit is the amount she makes from selling the lemonade minus the cost of the supplies. So her profit is $36 - $18 = $<<36-18=18>>18.

Next, let's calculate how many hours it takes for Millie to sell all of the lemonade. Since she sells an average of 4 cups per hour, it will take her 36 / 4 = <<36/4=9>>9 hours to sell all of the lemonade.

Finally, to find out how much profit she makes per hour, we divide her total profit by the number of hours it takes to sell all of the lemonade. So her profit per hour is $18 / 9 hours = $<<18/9=2>>2 per hour.

So, Millie will make a profit of $2 per hour that she spends running the lemonade stand.
