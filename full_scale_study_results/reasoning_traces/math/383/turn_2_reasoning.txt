Question ID: 383
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To determine Millie's profit per hour from her lemonade stand, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of cups Millie can sell:**

   Millie makes 3 pitchers of lemonade, and each pitcher holds 12 cups. Therefore, the total number of cups is:
   \[
   3 \text{ pitchers} \times 12 \text{ cups per pitcher} = 36 \text{ cups}
   \]

2. **Calculate the total revenue from selling all the lemonade:**

   Millie sells each cup for $1. Therefore, if she sells all 36 cups, her total revenue is:
   \[
   36 \text{ cups} \times \$1 \text{ per cup} = \$36
   \]

3. **Calculate the total cost of supplies:**

   Millie spends $18 on supplies to make the lemonade.

4. **Calculate the total profit:**

   Profit is calculated as total revenue minus total costs. Therefore, Millie's total profit is:
   \[
   \$36 \text{ (revenue)} - \$18 \text{ (cost)} = \$18
   \]

5. **Determine the number of hours Millie spends selling lemonade:**

   Millie sells an average of 4 cups per hour. To sell all 36 cups, the number of hours she needs is:
   \[
   \frac{36 \text{ cups}}{4 \text{ cups per hour}} = 9 \text{ hours}
   \]

6. **Calculate the profit per hour:**

   Millie's profit per hour is her total profit divided by the number of hours she works:
   \[
   \frac{\$18 \text{ (total profit)}}{9 \text{ hours}} = \$2 \text{ per hour}
   \]

Therefore, Millie's profit per hour that she spends running the lemonade stand is \(\$2\).
