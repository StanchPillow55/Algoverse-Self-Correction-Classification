Question ID: 383
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, let's calculate how many cups of lemonade Millie can make with the supplies she bought. Since each pitcher holds 12 cups and she can make 3 pitchers, she can make 3 * 12 = 36 cups of lemonade.

Next, let's calculate how much money she will make if she sells all of the lemonade. Since she sells each cup for $1, she will make 36 * $1 = $36.

Now, let's calculate how much profit she will make. Profit is calculated by subtracting the cost of the supplies from the money she makes. So, her profit will be $36 - $18 = $18.

Finally, let's calculate how much profit she will make per hour. Since she sells an average of 4 cups per hour, it will take her 36 / 4 = 9 hours to sell all of the lemonade. So, her profit per hour will be $18 / 9 = $2.

Therefore, Millie will make a profit of $2 per hour that she spends running the lemonade stand.
