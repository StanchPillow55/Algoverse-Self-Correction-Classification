Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine how many marbles Bob initially has and then calculate how many he will have after losing some.

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - Bob receives 2 dozen more marbles and then has a total of 60 marbles.
   - We need to find out how many marbles he originally had before receiving the additional marbles.
   - After finding the initial number of marbles, we will calculate how many marbles Bob has after losing 10.

2. **Calculating the Initial Number of Marbles:**
   - A dozen is equal to 12, so 2 dozen is \(2 \times 12 = 24\) marbles.
   - Let \(x\) be the number of marbles Bob originally had.
   - According to the problem, if Bob receives 24 more marbles, he will have 60 marbles. This can be expressed as:
     \[
     x + 24 = 60
     \]
   - To find \(x\), subtract 24 from both sides:
     \[
     x = 60 - 24
     \]
     \[
     x = 36
     \]
   - Therefore, Bob originally had 36 marbles.

3. **Calculating the Number of Marbles After Losing Some:**
   - Bob loses 10 marbles from his original count of 36 marbles.
   - Subtract 10 from 36:
     \[
     36 - 10 = 26
     \]

4. **Conclusion:**
   - After losing 10 marbles, Bob will have 26 marbles.

**Final Answer:**
Bob will have 26 marbles.
