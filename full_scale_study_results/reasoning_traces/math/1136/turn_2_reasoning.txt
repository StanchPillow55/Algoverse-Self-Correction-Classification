Question ID: 1136
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to determine how many marbles Bob originally had, and then calculate how many marbles he will have after losing 10.

### Step 1: Determine the number of marbles Bob originally had.

1. **Understanding the problem:**  
   Bob will have 60 marbles after receiving 2 dozen more marbles. A dozen is 12, so 2 dozen is \(2 \times 12 = 24\) marbles.

2. **Set up the equation:**  
   Let \( x \) be the number of marbles Bob originally had. According to the problem, if Bob receives 24 more marbles, he will have 60 marbles. Therefore, we can write the equation:
   \[
   x + 24 = 60
   \]

3. **Solve for \( x \):**  
   Subtract 24 from both sides of the equation to find \( x \):
   \[
   x = 60 - 24 = 36
   \]
   So, Bob originally had 36 marbles.

### Step 2: Calculate how many marbles Bob will have after losing 10.

1. **Subtract 10 from the original number of marbles:**  
   Bob originally had 36 marbles. If he loses 10 marbles, the number of marbles he will have is:
   \[
   36 - 10 = 26
   \]

### Final Answer:
Bob will have 26 marbles after losing 10 marbles.
