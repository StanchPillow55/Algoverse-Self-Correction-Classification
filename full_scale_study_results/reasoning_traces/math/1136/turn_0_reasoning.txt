Dataset Type: math
==================================================

Let's start by figuring out how many marbles Bob has initially. We know that if he receives 2 dozen more marbles, he will have 60 marbles. A dozen is 12, so 2 dozen is 24. 

If we subtract the 2 dozen marbles from the total number of marbles Bob will have, we can find out how many marbles he has initially. 

60 marbles - 24 marbles = 36 marbles

So, Bob initially has 36 marbles.

Now, let's figure out how many marbles Bob will have if he loses 10 of his marbles. 

36 marbles - 10 marbles = 26 marbles

So, if Bob loses 10 marbles, he will have 26 marbles. 

Therefore, the final answer is 26 marbles.
