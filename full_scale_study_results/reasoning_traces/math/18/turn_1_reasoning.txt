Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to first calculate the total number of eggs Claire eats in a day, then in a week, and finally in 4 weeks. After that, we will convert the total number of eggs into dozens.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of eggs Claire eats in a day.
Since Claire makes a 3 egg omelet every morning for breakfast, she eats 3 eggs in a day.

Step 2: Calculate the total number of eggs Claire eats in a week.
There are 7 days in a week. So, if Claire eats 3 eggs each day, in a week she will eat 3 eggs/day * 7 days/week = 21 eggs/week.

Step 3: Calculate the total number of eggs Claire eats in 4 weeks.
If Claire eats 21 eggs in a week, in 4 weeks she will eat 21 eggs/week * 4 weeks = 84 eggs.

Step 4: Convert the total number of eggs into dozens.
There are 12 eggs in a dozen. So, if Claire eats 84 eggs, she will eat 84 eggs / 12 eggs/dozen = 7 dozens.

So, Claire will eat 7 dozens of eggs in 4 weeks.
