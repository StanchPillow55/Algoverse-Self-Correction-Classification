Question ID: 18
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to determine how many eggs Claire eats in a day. Since she makes a 3 egg omelet every morning, she eats 3 eggs a day.

Next, we need to figure out how many eggs she eats in a week. Since there are 7 days in a week, we multiply the number of eggs she eats in a day by 7. 

3 eggs/day * 7 days/week = 21 eggs/week

Now, we need to determine how many eggs she eats in 4 weeks. We multiply the number of eggs she eats in a week by 4.

21 eggs/week * 4 weeks = 84 eggs

Finally, we need to convert the total number of eggs into dozens. Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we divide the total number of eggs by 12.

84 eggs รท 12 = 7 dozens

So, Claire will eat 7 dozens of eggs in 4 weeks.
