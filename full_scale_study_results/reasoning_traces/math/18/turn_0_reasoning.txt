Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to calculate how many eggs Claire eats in a week. Since she eats a 3 egg omelet every morning, she eats 3 eggs * 7 days = 21 eggs in a week.

Next, we need to calculate how many eggs she eats in 4 weeks. So, we multiply the number of eggs she eats in a week by 4. That's 21 eggs/week * 4 weeks = 84 eggs in 4 weeks.

Finally, we need to convert the total number of eggs into dozens. Since 1 dozen is equal to 12, we divide the total number of eggs by 12. 

So, 84 eggs รท 12 = 7 dozens.

Therefore, Claire will eat 7 dozens of eggs in 4 weeks.
