Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, let's figure out how many eggs were hidden in total. A dozen is 12, so 3 dozen eggs would be 3 * 12 = <<3*12=36>>36 eggs.

Lamar finds 5 eggs.

Stacy finds twice as many as Lamar, so Stacy finds 5 * 2 = <<5*2=10>>10 eggs.

Charlie finds 2 less than Stacy, so Charlie finds 10 - 2 = <<10-2=8>>8 eggs.

Mei finds half as many as Charlie, so Mei finds 8 / 2 = <<8/2=4>>4 eggs.

To find out how many eggs are still hidden, we need to add up all the eggs that were found and subtract that number from the total number of eggs. 

So, Lamar, Stacy, Charlie, and Mei found a total of 5 + 10 + 8 + 4 = <<5+10+8+4=27>>27 eggs.

Subtracting the number of eggs found from the total number of eggs gives us 36 - 27 = <<36-27=9>>9 eggs.

So, there are 9 eggs still hidden in the yard.
