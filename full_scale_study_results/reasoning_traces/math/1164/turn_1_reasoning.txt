Question ID: 1164
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to determine the total number of eggs that Cole hid in the yard. Since a dozen is equal to 12, three dozen eggs would be 3 * 12 = 36 eggs.

Next, we need to calculate how many eggs each person found. We know that Lamar found 5 eggs. Stacy found twice as many as Lamar, which would be 2 * 5 = 10 eggs. Charlie found 2 less than Stacy, which would be 10 - 2 = 8 eggs. Mei found half as many as Charlie, which would be 8 / 2 = 4 eggs.

Now, we add up all the eggs that were found: 5 (Lamar) + 10 (Stacy) + 8 (Charlie) + 4 (Mei) = 27 eggs.

Finally, we subtract the number of eggs found from the total number of eggs that were hidden to find out how many are still hidden: 36 (total) - 27 (found) = 9 eggs.

So, there are 9 eggs still hidden in the yard.
