Question ID: 843
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

Craig starts with 2 twenty dollar bills. Since each twenty dollar bill is worth $20, we multiply 2 by 20 to find out how much money Craig has at the start.

2 * $20 = $40

Craig buys six squirt guns for $2 each. To find out how much he spent on squirt guns, we multiply the number of squirt guns by the cost of each squirt gun.

6 * $2 = $12

Craig also buys 3 packs of water balloons for $3 each. To find out how much he spent on water balloons, we multiply the number of packs of water balloons by the cost of each pack.

3 * $3 = $9

To find out how much money Craig has left, we start with the amount of money he had at the start and subtract the cost of the squirt guns and the water balloons.

$40 - $12 - $9 = $19

So, Craig has $19 left after buying the squirt guns and water balloons.
