Dataset Type: math
==================================================

Craig starts with 2 twenty dollar bills, which is 2 * $20 = $<<2*20=40>>40.

He buys six squirt guns for $2 each, which costs him 6 * $2 = $<<6*2=12>>12.

He also buys 3 packs of water balloons for $3 each, which costs him 3 * $3 = $<<3*3=9>>9.

So in total, Craig spends $12 on squirt guns and $9 on water balloons, which is $12 + $9 = $<<12+9=21>>21.

Craig started with $40 and spent $21, so he has $40 - $21 = $<<40-21=19>>19 left. 

So, Craig has $19 left.
