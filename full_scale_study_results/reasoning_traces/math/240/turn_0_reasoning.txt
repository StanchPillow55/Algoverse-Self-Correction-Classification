Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to find out how many candies Robert has. Since John has twice as many candies as Robert, and John has 54 candies, we can set up the equation 2R = 54, where R represents the number of candies Robert has. Solving for R, we get R = 54/2 = 27. So, Robert has 27 candies.

Next, we need to find out how many candies James has. We know that James has 6 more candies than Robert. So, we can set up the equation J = R + 6, where J represents the number of candies James has. Substituting 27 for R, we get J = 27 + 6 = 33. So, James has 33 candies.

Finally, we need to find out how many more candies John has than James. We can set up the equation Jm = Jn - J, where Jm represents the number of more candies John has than James, and Jn represents the number of candies John has. Substituting 54 for Jn and 33 for J, we get Jm = 54 - 33 = 21.

So, John has 21 more candies than James.
