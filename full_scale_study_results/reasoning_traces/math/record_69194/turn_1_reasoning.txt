Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, I will need to analyze the given passage and determine which city is mentioned as an early and strong adopter of widespread camera surveillance.

The passage discusses the debate in Oakland, California over the creation of a central surveillance facility called the "Domain Awareness Center" (DAC). It mentions that this poses serious privacy questions for millions of people in cities around the globe.

The passage then states that "Operations in London, Boston, Rio have resulted in success stories." This suggests that London, Boston, and Rio de Janeiro are cities that have implemented widespread camera surveillance systems.

Therefore, the city that is mentioned as an early and strong adopter of widespread camera surveillance is London.

Final answer: London
