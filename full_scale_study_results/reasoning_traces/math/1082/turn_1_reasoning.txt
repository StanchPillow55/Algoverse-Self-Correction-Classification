Question ID: 1082
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, let's determine the total distance James had to walk. He walked halfway to the store before turning back, which is a distance of 2 miles (half of 4 miles). Then, he walked the same distance back home, which is another 2 miles. Finally, he walked the full distance from his home to the store, which is 4 miles. 

So, the total distance he walked is 2 miles (to halfway point) + 2 miles (back home) + 4 miles (to the store) = 8 miles.

Given that James walks at a speed of 4 miles per hour, we can find the total time it took him by dividing the total distance by his speed. 

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 8 miles / 4 miles per hour = 2 hours

So, it took James 2 hours to reach the store.
