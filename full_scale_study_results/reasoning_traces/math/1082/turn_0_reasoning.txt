Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, let's figure out how far James walked. He walked halfway to the store, then back home, then all the way to the store. 

Halfway to the store from his home is 4 miles / 2 = 2 miles.

So, he walked 2 miles (halfway to the store), then 2 miles back home, then 4 miles to the store, for a total of 2 + 2 + 4 = 8 miles.

James walks at a speed of 4 miles per hour, so to figure out how long he walked, we divide the total distance by his speed.

So, 8 miles / 4 miles per hour = 2 hours.

Therefore, it took James 2 hours to reach the store.
