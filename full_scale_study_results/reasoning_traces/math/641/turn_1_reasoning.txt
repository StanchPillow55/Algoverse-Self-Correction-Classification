Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, let's calculate the new monthly salary after the 5% raise. 

5% of $20000 is calculated as:

0.05 * $20000 = $1000

So, Tim's new monthly salary after the raise is:

$20000 + $1000 = $21000

Now, let's calculate his annual salary. Since there are 12 months in a year, his annual salary is:

$21000 * 12 = $252000

Next, let's calculate the bonus. The bonus is worth half a month's salary, so it is:

$20000 / 2 = $10000

Finally, let's add the bonus to the annual salary to find out how much money Tim will make in a year:

$252000 + $10000 = $262000

So, Tim will make $262000 in a year.
