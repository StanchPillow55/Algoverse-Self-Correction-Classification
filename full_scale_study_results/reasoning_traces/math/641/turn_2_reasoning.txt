==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to calculate Tim's new monthly salary with the raise, add the bonus, and then multiply by 12 to get the annual total.

Step 1: Calculate the raise
First, we need to calculate the 5% raise on Tim's current salary of $20000. 

5% of $20000 is calculated as follows:
20000 * 5/100 = $1000

So, Tim's raise is $1000.

Step 2: Calculate the new monthly salary
Next, we add the raise to the current salary to get the new monthly salary.

20000 + 1000 = $21000

So, Tim's new monthly salary after the raise is $21000.

Step 3: Calculate the bonus
The problem states that Tim also gets a bonus worth half a month's salary. We need to calculate this bonus based on his new salary.

Half of $21000 is calculated as follows:
21000 / 2 = $10500

So, Tim's bonus is $10500.

Step 4: Calculate the annual total
Finally, we need to calculate how much money Tim will make in a year. This is done by multiplying his new monthly salary by 12 (for the 12 months in a year) and adding the bonus.

(21000 * 12) + 10500 = $252000 + 10500 = $262500

So, Tim will make $262500 in a year.

Final Answer: Tim will make $262500 in a year.
