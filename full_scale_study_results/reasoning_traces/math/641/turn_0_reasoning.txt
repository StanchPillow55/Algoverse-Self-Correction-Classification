==================================================

First, let's calculate Tim's new monthly salary with the 5% raise. 

5% of $20000 is calculated as follows:
(5/100) * $20000 = $1000

So, his new monthly salary is $20000 + $1000 = $21000

Next, let's calculate his annual salary. Since there are 12 months in a year, his annual salary is:
$21000 * 12 = $252000

Now, let's calculate his bonus. The bonus is worth half a month's salary, so it's:
$20000 / 2 = $10000

Finally, let's add his annual salary and his bonus to find out how much money he will make in a year:
$252000 + $10000 = $262000

So, Tim will make $262000 in a year.
