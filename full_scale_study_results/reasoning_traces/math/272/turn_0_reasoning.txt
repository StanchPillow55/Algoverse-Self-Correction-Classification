Question ID: 272
Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to find out how much the mother spent in total. To do this, we add up the cost of the cocoa, the laundry, and the pasta.

$4.20 (cocoa) + $9.45 (laundry) + $1.35 (pasta) = $15.00

Next, we need to find out how much change the mother should get back. To do this, we subtract the total amount spent from the amount she gave to the cashier.

$20.00 (amount given to cashier) - $15.00 (total spent) = $5.00

So, the cashier should give the mother $5.00 back in change.
