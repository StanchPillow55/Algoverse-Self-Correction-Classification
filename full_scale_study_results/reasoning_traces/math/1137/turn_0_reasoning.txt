Let's denote the temperature of the water in the second mug as T. 

When Donny mixes the waters, the final temperature is a weighted average of the initial temperatures. The weight of each temperature is the amount of water at that temperature. 

So, the final temperature (which we know is at least 40 degrees) can be calculated as follows:

Final temperature = (Amount of 33-degree water * 33 degrees + Amount of T-degree water * T degrees) / Total amount of water

We know that the amount of 33-degree water is 4 ounces, the amount of T-degree water is 1 ounce, and the total amount of water is 5 ounces. 

So, we can set up the following equation:

40 degrees = (4 ounces * 33 degrees + 1 ounce * T degrees) / 5 ounces

Solving this equation for T gives us:

40 degrees * 5 ounces = 4 ounces * 33 degrees + 1 ounce * T degrees

200 degrees = 132 degrees + T degrees

Subtract 132 degrees from both sides to solve for T:

T = 200 degrees - 132 degrees = 68 degrees

So, the temperature of the water in the second mug must be at least 68 degrees.
