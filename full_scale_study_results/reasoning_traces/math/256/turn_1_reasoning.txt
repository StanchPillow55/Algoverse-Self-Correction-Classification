==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to convert all the coins and bills into dollars.

First, let's convert the pennies into dollars. There are 100 pennies and since 1 penny is equal to $0.01, we multiply 100 by 0.01 to get $1. 

Next, we convert the nickels into dollars. There are 40 nickels and since 1 nickel is equal to $0.05, we multiply 40 by 0.05 to get $2.

Then, we convert the dimes into dollars. There are 20 dimes and since 1 dime is equal to $0.10, we multiply 20 by 0.10 to get $2.

Finally, we add the dollar bills. There are 40 dollar bills and since 1 dollar bill is equal to $1, we multiply 40 by 1 to get $40.

Now, we add all the amounts together: $1 (pennies) + $2 (nickels) + $2 (dimes) + $40 (dollar bills) = $45.

So, Brady has $45 in his piggy bank.
