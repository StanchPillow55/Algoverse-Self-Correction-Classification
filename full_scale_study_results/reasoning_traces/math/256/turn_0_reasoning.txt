Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, let's convert all the coins and bills to dollars.

1 penny is worth $0.01, so 100 pennies is worth 100 * $0.01 = $1.00.

1 nickel is worth $0.05, so 40 nickels is worth 40 * $0.05 = $2.00.

1 dime is worth $0.10, so 20 dimes is worth 20 * $0.10 = $2.00.

1 dollar bill is worth $1.00, so 40 dollar bills is worth 40 * $1.00 = $40.00.

Now, let's add all these amounts together to find the total amount of money Brady has in his piggy bank.

$1.00 (pennies) + $2.00 (nickels) + $2.00 (dimes) + $40.00 (dollar bills) = $45.00.

So, Brady has $45.00 in his piggy bank.
