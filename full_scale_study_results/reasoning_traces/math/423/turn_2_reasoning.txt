Question ID: 423
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine the original cost of the jogger jeans and compare it to the cost of the tattered jeans. Let's go through the problem step by step.

1. **Identify the cost of the tattered jeans:**
   - The tattered jeans cost $28.

2. **Determine the cost of the jogger jeans:**
   - The jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans.
   - Therefore, the cost of the jogger jeans is: 
     \[
     28 - 6 = 22
     \]

3. **Understand the total savings:**
   - Cole saved a total of $6.

4. **Distribution of savings:**
   - He saved \( \frac{1}{3} \) of the total savings from the jogger jeans.
   - Therefore, the savings from the jogger jeans is:
     \[
     \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2
     \]
   - The remaining savings, which is from the tattered jeans, is:
     \[
     6 - 2 = 4
     \]

5. **Calculate the original prices:**
   - Since he saved $2 on the jogger jeans, the original price of the jogger jeans was:
     \[
     22 + 2 = 24
     \]
   - Since he saved $4 on the tattered jeans, the original price of the tattered jeans was:
     \[
     28 + 4 = 32
     \]

6. **Compare the original prices:**
   - The original price of the jogger jeans was $24.
   - The original price of the tattered jeans was $32.
   - The jogger jeans originally cost less than the tattered jeans, not more.

Therefore, the jogger jeans originally cost $8 less than the tattered jeans, not more. The problem seems to have a contradiction in its final question, as it asks how much more the jogger jeans originally cost than the tattered jeans, which is not the case based on the calculations.

**Final Answer:**
The jogger jeans originally cost $8 less than the tattered jeans.
