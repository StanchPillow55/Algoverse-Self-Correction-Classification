Question ID: 423
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine the original price of the jogger jeans and compare it to the price of the tattered jeans. Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Identify the cost of the tattered jeans:**
   - The tattered jeans cost $28.

2. **Determine the cost of the jogger jeans:**
   - The jogger jeans cost $6 less than the tattered jeans.
   - Therefore, the cost of the jogger jeans is \(28 - 6 = 22\) dollars.

3. **Understand the savings:**
   - Cole saved a total of $6 on both pairs of jeans.
   - He saved 1/3 of the total savings from the jogger jeans and the rest from the tattered jeans.

4. **Calculate the savings from each pair of jeans:**
   - Total savings = $6.
   - Savings from jogger jeans = \(\frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2\) dollars.
   - Savings from tattered jeans = Total savings - Savings from jogger jeans = \(6 - 2 = 4\) dollars.

5. **Determine the original price of each pair of jeans:**
   - The original price of the jogger jeans before savings was applied:
     - Sale price of jogger jeans = $22.
     - Savings on jogger jeans = $2.
     - Original price of jogger jeans = Sale price + Savings = \(22 + 2 = 24\) dollars.
   
   - The original price of the tattered jeans before savings was applied:
     - Sale price of tattered jeans = $28.
     - Savings on tattered jeans = $4.
     - Original price of tattered jeans = Sale price + Savings = \(28 + 4 = 32\) dollars.

6. **Compare the original prices:**
   - Original price of jogger jeans = $24.
   - Original price of tattered jeans = $32.

7. **Calculate the difference in original prices:**
   - Difference = Original price of tattered jeans - Original price of jogger jeans = \(32 - 24 = 8\) dollars.

Therefore, the jogger jeans originally cost $8 less than the tattered jeans.

**Final Answer:**
The jogger jeans originally cost $8 less than the tattered jeans.
