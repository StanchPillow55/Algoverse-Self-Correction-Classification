==================================================

First, let's find out how much the jogger jeans cost. Since they cost $6 less than the tattered jeans, we subtract $6 from the cost of the tattered jeans. 

$28 - $6 = $22

So, the jogger jeans cost $22.

Next, let's find out how much he saved from each pair of jeans. We know that he saved a total of $6, and that 1/3 of the total savings came from the jogger jeans and the rest from the tattered jeans.

1/3 of $6 is $2, so he saved $2 from the jogger jeans. 

$6 - $2 = $4

So, he saved $4 from the tattered jeans.

Now, let's find out how much each pair of jeans originally cost. We add the savings to the sale price to find the original price.

The tattered jeans originally cost $28 + $4 = $32.

The jogger jeans originally cost $22 + $2 = $24.

Finally, to find out how much more the jogger jeans originally cost than the tattered jeans, we subtract the original cost of the tattered jeans from the original cost of the jogger jeans.

$24 - $32 = -$8

So, the jogger jeans originally cost $8 less than the tattered jeans.
