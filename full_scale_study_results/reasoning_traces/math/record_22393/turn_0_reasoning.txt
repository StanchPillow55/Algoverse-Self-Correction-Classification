==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given information and determine the best course of action for Manchester United regarding Tom Cleverley's contract situation.

Given information:
- Aston Villa have made a Â£7 million bid for Tom Cleverley, a Manchester United midfielder.
- Cleverley has one year left on his contract with Manchester United.
- Cleverley's advisers have held talks with Manchester United earlier this month about a new contract, but an offer has not been made.
- Manchester United are tied up trying to sign new additions, and Louis van Gaal is not happy with some of the players at his disposal.
- Manchester United will listen to offers for Cleverley.
- Cleverley accepts that he could become a peripheral figure at Manchester United, and if he opts to sit out his contract, the club will be forced to try and sell him now.

Reasoning:
1. Manchester United's current situation:
   - Manchester United are focused on signing new players and are not satisfied with some of the current players.
   - This suggests that Cleverley may not be a key part of their plans for the upcoming season.
