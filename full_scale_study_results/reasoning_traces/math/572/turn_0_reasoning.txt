==================================================

First, let's calculate how many roses Ford needs to supply all the flower shops every week. 

The first flower shop orders 20 roses, the second flower shop orders 15 roses, and the third flower shop orders 30 roses. 

So, the total number of roses needed every week is 20 + 15 + 30 = 65 roses.

Ford grows 40 roses every week. So, the number of roses he lacks every week is 65 (total needed) - 40 (total grown) = 25 roses.

Now, let's calculate how many roses Ford lacks to supply all the flower shops every month. 

There are about 4 weeks in a month. So, the total number of roses Ford lacks every month is 25 (lack per week) * 4 (weeks in a month) = 100 roses.

So, Ford lacks 100 roses to supply all the flower shops every month.
