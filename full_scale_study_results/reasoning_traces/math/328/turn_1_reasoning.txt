Question ID: 328
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

The phone is currently at 60% charge and we want it to be fully charged, which is 100%. So, we need to find out how long it will take to charge the remaining 40% (100% - 60% = 40%).

Given that the phone charges at a rate of 1 percentage-point per 3 minutes, we can calculate the time it will take to charge the remaining 40% by multiplying 40 by 3. 

40 * 3 = 120 minutes

However, the question asks for the answer in hours. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so we can convert the time from minutes to hours by dividing by 60.

120 / 60 = 2 hours

So, it will take 2 hours to fully charge the phone from 60% to 100%.
