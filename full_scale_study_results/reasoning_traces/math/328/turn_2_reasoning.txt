Question ID: 328
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

The phone is currently at 60% charge, and it needs to reach 100% charge. This means it needs an additional 40% charge.

The phone charges at a rate of 1% every 3 minutes. So, to calculate the time it will take to charge the remaining 40%, we multiply 40 by 3:

40 * 3 = 120 minutes

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):

120 รท 60 = 2 hours

So, it will take 2 hours to fully charge the phone from 60% to 100%.
