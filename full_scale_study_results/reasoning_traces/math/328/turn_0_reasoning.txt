Dataset Type: math
==================================================

The phone is currently at 60% charged and we want it to be 100% charged. Therefore, we need to find out how long it will take to charge the remaining 40% (100% - 60% = 40%).

The phone charges at a rate of 1 percentage-point per 3 minutes. So, to charge 40 percentage-points, it will take 40 * 3 = 120 minutes.

To convert minutes to hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour). So, 120 minutes is equivalent to 120 / 60 = 2 hours.

Therefore, it will take 2 hours to fully charge the phone from 60% to 100%.

Final Answer: It will take 2 hours to fully charge the phone.
