==================================================

The bus departed Chengli city with 20 people. 

At the first stop, 40 more people entered the bus. This makes a total of 20 + 40 = <<20+40=60>>60 people on the bus.

At the second station, 3/4 of the total number of people who entered the bus at the first station entered the bus. This means 3/4 * 40 = <<3/4*40=30>>30 people entered the bus at the second station. 

So, the total number of people on the bus after the second station is 60 + 30 = <<60+30=90>>90 people.

At the third station, the number of passengers on the bus doubled. This means the number of people on the bus became 2 * 90 = <<2*90=180>>180 people.

The bus has a capacity of 200 people, so the number of people required to fill the remaining spaces on the bus is 200 - 180 = <<200-180=20>>20 people.

Therefore, 20 more people are needed to fill the bus to capacity.
