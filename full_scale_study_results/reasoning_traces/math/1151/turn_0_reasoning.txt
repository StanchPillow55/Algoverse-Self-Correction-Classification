==================================================

To find the average speed, we need to divide the total distance traveled by the total time taken.

First, we find the total distance traveled. Sid traveled 110 miles in the first 2 hours and then an additional 140 miles in the next 3 hours. So, the total distance he traveled is 110 miles + 140 miles = 250 miles.

Next, we find the total time taken. Sid traveled for 2 hours initially and then for an additional 3 hours. So, the total time he traveled is 2 hours + 3 hours = 5 hours.

Now we can find the average speed by dividing the total distance by the total time. So, the average speed is 250 miles รท 5 hours = 50 miles per hour.

So, Sid's average speed was 50 miles per hour.
