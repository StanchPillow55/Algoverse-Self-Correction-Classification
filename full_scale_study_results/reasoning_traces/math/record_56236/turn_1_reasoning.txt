==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to find the value of the placeholder in the given information.

Given information:
- Gadhafi's elite ground forces are well-paid and well-equipped.
- Those troops fight within cities, where the coalition cannot easily get them.
- Before the war, @placeholder had about 500 mortars and 2,400 pieces of artillery.

Since the passage does not mention the specific number of mortars and artillery pieces, we can infer that the placeholder represents the number of ground forces Gadhafi had before the war.

Therefore, the final answer is:
@placeholder = Gadhafi's ground forces before the war

The complete reasoning and work is as follows:
1. The passage states that Gadhafi's elite ground forces are well-paid and well-equipped, and they fight within cities where the coalition cannot easily get them.
2. The passage also mentions that before the war, @placeholder had about 500 mortars and 2,400 pieces of artillery.
3. Since the passage does not provide the specific number of ground forces, we can infer that the placeholder represents the number of ground forces Gadhafi ha
