Question ID: 530
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

Josh normally works out for 4 hours a week. Over 8 weeks, if he maintained this routine, he would have worked out for 4 hours/week * 8 weeks = 32 hours.

However, we know that he worked out for 5 hours for two consecutive weeks. This is 1 hour more than his usual routine for each of those weeks. So, he worked out for an extra 1 hour/week * 2 weeks = 2 hours during these two weeks.

We also know that he worked out for 6 hours in one week. This is 2 hours more than his usual routine for that week. So, he worked out for an extra 2 hours during this week.

Adding up all these hours, we find that Josh worked out for a total of 32 hours (from his usual routine) + 2 hours (from the two weeks he worked out for 5 hours each) + 2 hours (from the week he worked out for 6 hours) = 36 hours.

So, Josh has spent a total of 36 hours working out across the 8 weeks.
