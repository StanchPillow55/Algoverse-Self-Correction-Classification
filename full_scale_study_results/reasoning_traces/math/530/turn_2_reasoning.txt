Question ID: 530
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

Josh spent 4 hours working out each week for 8 weeks, which would be 4 hours/week * 8 weeks = 32 hours.

However, there were some exceptions. He spent an extra hour for two consecutive weeks (5 hours instead of 4), which means he spent an additional 2 hours (1 extra hour/week * 2 weeks = 2 hours).

He also spent 2 extra hours in one week (6 hours instead of 4), which adds another 2 hours to his total.

So, the total number of hours Josh spent working out across the 8 weeks is 32 hours (regular workout time) + 2 hours (extra time for two weeks) + 2 hours (extra time for one week) = 36 hours. 

Therefore, Josh has spent 36 hours working out across the 8 weeks.
