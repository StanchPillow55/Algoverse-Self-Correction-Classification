==================================================

Josh's standard workout routine is 4 hours per week. Over 8 weeks, if he maintained this routine, he would have worked out for 4 hours/week * 8 weeks = 32 hours.

However, we know that there were some exceptions. For two consecutive weeks, he worked out for 5 hours each week. This is 1 hour more than his usual routine for each of these weeks, so he worked out an extra 1 hour/week * 2 weeks = 2 hours during these weeks.

In another week, he worked out for 6 hours. This is 2 hours more than his usual routine, so he worked out an extra 2 hours during this week.

Adding up all these times, Josh worked out for a total of 32 hours (from his usual routine) + 2 hours (from the two weeks where he worked out for 5 hours each) + 2 hours (from the week where he worked out for 6 hours) = 36 hours.

So, Josh has spent a total of 36 hours working out across the 8 weeks.
