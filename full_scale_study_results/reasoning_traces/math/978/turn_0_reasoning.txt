Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to find out how much cheaper the red car is than the blue car. 

The blue car costs $100. If the red car is 40% cheaper, we need to calculate 40% of the blue car's price. 

To do this, we multiply the price of the blue car by 40% (or 0.40 in decimal form):

$100 * 0.40 = $40

This means the red car is $40 cheaper than the blue car. 

To find out how much the red car costs, we subtract this amount from the price of the blue car:

$100 - $40 = $60

So, the red car costs $60.

To find out how much both cars cost together, we add the price of the blue car and the price of the red car:

$100 (blue car) + $60 (red car) = $160

So, both cars together cost $160.
