Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine the cost of both the red car and the blue car, given that the red car is 40% cheaper than the blue car, and the price of the blue car is $100.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the price of the blue car:**
   - The problem states that the price of the blue car is $100.

2. **Determine how much cheaper the red car is compared to the blue car:**
   - The red car is 40% cheaper than the blue car. This means that the price of the red car is reduced by 40% of the price of the blue car.
   - To find 40% of the blue car's price, we calculate:
     \[
     40\% \text{ of } \$100 = 0.40 \times 100 = \$40
     \]

3. **Calculate the price of the red car:**
   - Since the red car is $40 cheaper than the blue car, we subtract $40 from the price of the blue car:
     \[
     \text{Price of the red car} = \$100 - \$40 = \$60
     \]

4. **Summarize the costs of both cars:**
   - The price of the blue car is $100.
   - The price of the red car is $60.

Therefore, the total cost of both cars is:
\[
\$100 + \$60 = \$160
\]

**Final Answer:**
The blue car costs $100, the red car costs $60, and together they cost $160.
