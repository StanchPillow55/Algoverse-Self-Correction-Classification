==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine the probability that a baby wearing a bow is also wearing purple. Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the Total Number of Babies:**
   Carla has given birth to identical octuplets, which means she has 8 babies.

2. **Calculate the Number of Babies Wearing Purple:**
   Carla dresses 3/4 of the babies in purple.
   \[
   \text{Number of babies in purple} = \frac{3}{4} \times 8 = 6
   \]

3. **Calculate the Number of Babies Wearing Blue:**
   Carla dresses 1/4 of the babies in blue.
   \[
   \text{Number of babies in blue} = \frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2
   \]

4. **Determine the Number of Babies Wearing Bows:**
   - All the blue-wearers wear bows, so there are 2 babies wearing blue and bows.
   - 1/3 of the purple-wearers also wear bows.
   \[
   \text{Number of purple-wearers with bows} = \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2
   \]

5. **Calculate the Total Number of Babies Wearing Bows:**
   \[
   \text{Total number of babies with bows} = 2 \, (\text{blue}) + 2 \, (\text{purple}) = 4
   \]

6. **Determine the Probability that a Baby Wearing a Bow is Wearing Purple:**
   We want to find the probability that a baby wearing a bow is also wearing purple. This is the number of purple-wearers with bows divided by the total number of bow-wearers.
   \[
   \text{Probability (purple | bow)} = \frac{\text{Number of purple-wearers with bows}}{\text{Total number of bow-wearers}} = \frac{2}{4} = \frac{1}{2}
   \]

7. **Convert the Probability to a Percentage:**
   \[
   \text{Percentage} = \frac{1}{2} \times 100\% = 50\%
   \]

Therefore, the percentage chance that a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple is **50%**.
