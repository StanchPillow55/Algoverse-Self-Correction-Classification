Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine the probability that a baby wearing a bow is also wearing purple. Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Step 1: Determine the Number of Babies in Each Group

Carla has given birth to identical octuplets, which means there are 8 babies in total.

#### Babies Wearing Purple:
- \( \frac{3}{4} \) of the babies are dressed in purple.
- Calculate the number of babies wearing purple:
  \[
  \frac{3}{4} \times 8 = 6 \text{ babies wearing purple}
  \]

#### Babies Wearing Blue:
- \( \frac{1}{4} \) of the babies are dressed in blue.
- Calculate the number of babies wearing blue:
  \[
  \frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2 \text{ babies wearing blue}
  \]

### Step 2: Determine the Number of Babies Wearing Bows

#### Blue-Wearers with Bows:
- All blue-wearers wear bows, so there are 2 babies wearing blue and bows.

#### Purple-Wearers with Bows:
- \( \frac{1}{3} \) of the purple-wearers also wear bows.
- Calculate the number of purple-wearers with bows:
  \[
  \frac{1}{3} \times 6 = 2 \text{ babies wearing purple and bows}
  \]

### Step 3: Total Number of Babies Wearing Bows

Add the number of blue-wearers with bows and purple-wearers with bows:
\[
2 \text{ (blue) } + 2 \text{ (purple) } = 4 \text{ babies wearing bows}
\]

### Step 4: Probability a Baby Wearing a Bow is Wearing Purple

We want to find the probability that a baby wearing a bow is also wearing purple. This is the ratio of the number of purple-wearers with bows to the total number of babies wearing bows:
\[
\text{Probability} = \frac{\text{Number of purple-wearers with bows}}{\text{Total number of babies with bows}} = \frac{2}{4} = \frac{1}{2}
\]

### Step 5: Convert the Probability to a Percentage

Convert the probability to a percentage:
\[
\frac{1}{2} \times 100\% = 50\%
\]

### Final Answer

The percentage chance that a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple is \( \boxed{50\%} \).
