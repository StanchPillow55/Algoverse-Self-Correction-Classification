==================================================

First, let's determine how many babies are wearing each color. Carla gave birth to 8 babies. 

She dresses 3/4 of them in purple. To find out how many that is, we multiply:
8 babies * 3/4 = 6 babies

She dresses 1/4 of them in blue. To find out how many that is, we multiply:
8 babies * 1/4 = 2 babies

Next, let's determine how many babies are wearing bows. 

All the blue-wearers are wearing bows, so that's 2 babies. 

1/3 of the purple wearers are also wearing bows. To find out how many that is, we multiply:
6 babies * 1/3 = 2 babies

So, in total, there are 2 (blue) + 2 (purple) = 4 babies wearing bows.

Finally, we need to find out the percentage chance a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple. 

To do this, we divide the number of purple-wearing bow-wearers by the total number of bow-wearers, and then multiply by 100% to convert to a percentage:

(2 purple bow-wearers / 4 total bow-wearers) * 100% = 50%

So, there is a 50% chance a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple.
