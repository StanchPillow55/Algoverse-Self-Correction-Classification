Question ID: 853
Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

The first step is to find out how many rooms make up one-half of the total rooms at the KozyInn Motel. Since there are 90 rooms in total, one-half would be 90/2 = 45 rooms.

Next, we need to find out how long it would take to clean these 45 rooms. Since it takes 20 minutes to clean each room, it would take 45 rooms * 20 minutes/room = 900 minutes to clean half of the rooms.

However, the question asks for the answer in hours, not minutes. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we need to convert 900 minutes into hours. We do this by dividing 900 minutes by 60 minutes/hour = 15 hours.

So, it would take 15 hours to clean one-half of the rooms at the KozyInn Motel.
