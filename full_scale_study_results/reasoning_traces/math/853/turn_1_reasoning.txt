Question ID: 853
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine how many hours it would take to clean one-half of the rooms at the KozyInn Motel, given that there are 90 rooms in total and each room takes 20 minutes to clean.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Determine the Number of Rooms to be Cleaned:**
   - The total number of rooms at the motel is 90.
   - We need to clean one-half of these rooms.
   - Calculate one-half of 90:
     \[
     \frac{90}{2} = 45
     \]
   - Therefore, we need to clean 45 rooms.

2. **Calculate the Total Cleaning Time in Minutes:**
   - Each room takes 20 minutes to clean.
   - For 45 rooms, the total cleaning time in minutes is:
     \[
     45 \text{ rooms} \times 20 \text{ minutes/room} = 900 \text{ minutes}
     \]

3. **Convert Minutes to Hours:**
   - There are 60 minutes in an hour.
   - To convert 900 minutes to hours, divide by 60:
     \[
     \frac{900 \text{ minutes}}{60 \text{ minutes/hour}} = 15 \text{ hours}
     \]

### Final Answer:
It would take 15 hours to clean one-half of the rooms at the KozyInn Motel.
