==================================================

Let's denote the number of points scored by Azibo as A, by Bahati as B, and by Dinar as D. 

According to the problem, we have the following relationships:

1) B = A + 20 (Bahati scored 20 more points than Azibo)

2) B = D + 10 (Bahati scored 10 more points than Dinar)

3) A + B + D = 45 (The total points scored by all three is 45)

We can substitute the first and second equations into the third equation to solve for A.

Substituting B from equation 1 into equation 3, we get:

A + A + 20 + D = 45
2A + D + 20 = 45
2A + D = 45 - 20
2A + D = 25

Now, substitute B from equation 2 into the above equation:

2A + B - 10 = 25
2A + Dinar + 10 - 10 = 25
2A + D = 25

We can see that the two equations are the same, which confirms that our substitutions are correct. 

Now, we can solve for A:

2A = 25 - D
2A = 25 - (B - 10)
2A = 25 - (A + 20 - 10)
2A = 25 - A - 10
2A = 15 - A
3A = 15
A = 15 / 3
A = 5

So, Azibo scored 5 points.
