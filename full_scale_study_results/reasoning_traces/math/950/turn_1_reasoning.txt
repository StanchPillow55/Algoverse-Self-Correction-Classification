==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine how many points Azibo scored given the relationships between the points scored by Bahati, Azibo, and Dinar.

Let's define the variables:
- Let \( A \) be the number of points Azibo scored.
- Let \( B \) be the number of points Bahati scored.
- Let \( D \) be the number of points Dinar scored.

We are given the following relationships:
1. The total points scored by Bahati, Azibo, and Dinar is 45:
   \[
   A + B + D = 45
   \]

2. Bahati scored 20 more points than Azibo:
   \[
   B = A + 20
   \]

3. Bahati scored 10 more points than Dinar:
   \[
   B = D + 10
   \]

We need to find the value of \( A \).

First, let's express \( D \) in terms of \( B \) using the third equation:
\[
D = B - 10
\]

Now, substitute \( B = A + 20 \) into the equation for \( D \):
\[
D = (A + 20) - 10 = A + 10
\]

Now we have:
- \( B = A + 20 \)
- \( D = A + 10 \)

Substitute these expressions for \( B \) and \( D \) into the total points equation:
\[
A + (A + 20) + (A + 10) = 45
\]

Simplify the equation:
\[
A + A + 20 + A + 10 = 45
\]
\[
3A + 30 = 45
\]

Subtract 30 from both sides:
\[
3A = 15
\]

Divide both sides by 3:
\[
A = 5
\]

Thus, Azibo scored \( \boxed{5} \) points.
