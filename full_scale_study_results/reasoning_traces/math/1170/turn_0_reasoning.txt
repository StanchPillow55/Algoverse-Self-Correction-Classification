==================================================

The problem states that half of the mural is yellow, which means the other half is equally divided between red, white, and purple. 

Since the total amount of paint used is 12 pints, half of that would be 12/2 = 6 pints. This is the amount of yellow paint used.

The other half, 6 pints, is equally divided between red, white, and purple. Since there are three colors, we divide 6 by 3 to find out how much of each color was used. 

So, 6/3 = 2 pints. 

Therefore, 2 pints of red paint was used in the mural.
