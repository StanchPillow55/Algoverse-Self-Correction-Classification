Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

Joey played 2 matches on Monday, 1 match on Friday. 

On Saturday, he played double the number of matches he played on Monday. Since he played 2 matches on Monday, double that would be 2*2 = 4 matches on Saturday.

To find the total number of matches Joey played in one week, we add the matches he played each day: 2 (Monday) + 1 (Friday) + 4 (Saturday) = 7 matches.

So, Joey played 7 matches in one week.
