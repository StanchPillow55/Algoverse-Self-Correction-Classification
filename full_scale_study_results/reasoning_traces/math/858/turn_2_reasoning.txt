Question ID: 858
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to understand that the number of infected people increases exponentially each day. This is because each infected person infects six others every day. 

Let's break this down:

- On the first day, we have 10 infected people.
- On the second day, each of these 10 people infects 6 others, so we have 10 * 6 = 60 new infections. Adding this to the original 10, we have a total of 10 + 60 = 70 infected people.
- On the third day, each of these 70 people infects 6 others, so we have 70 * 6 = 420 new infections. Adding this to the total from the previous day, we have 70 + 420 = 490 infected people.

So, after three days, a total of 490 people are infected.
