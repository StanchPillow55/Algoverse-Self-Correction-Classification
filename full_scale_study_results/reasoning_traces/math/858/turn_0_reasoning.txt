Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

This problem can be solved using the concept of geometric progression. In a geometric progression, each term after the first is found by multiplying the previous term by a fixed, non-zero number called the common ratio.

In this case, the common ratio is 6 (each infected person infects six others), and the first term is 10 (the initial number of infected people).

Let's calculate the number of infected people for each day:

Day 1: The initial number of infected people is 10.

Day 2: Each of the 10 infected people infects 6 others, so the total number of infected people is 10 * 6 = 60.

Day 3: Each of the 60 infected people from Day 2 infects 6 others, so the total number of infected people is 60 * 6 = 360.

So, after three days, a total of 360 people are infected.
