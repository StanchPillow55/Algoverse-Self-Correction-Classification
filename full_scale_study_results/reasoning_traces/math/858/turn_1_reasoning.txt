Question ID: 858
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

This problem involves exponential growth, where the number of infected people increases by a factor of six each day.

On the first day, there are 10 infected people.

On the second day, each of these 10 people infects 6 others, so the total number of infected people is 10 + 10*6 = 70.

On the third day, each of these 70 people infects 6 others, so the total number of infected people is 70 + 70*6 = 490.

Therefore, after three days, there are 490 people infected.
