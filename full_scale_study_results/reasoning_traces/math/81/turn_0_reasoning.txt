Dataset Type: math
==================================================

Charlie initially had 10 stickers. He then bought 21 more, so we add these together: 10 + 21 = 31 stickers.

Charlie then received 23 stickers for his birthday, so we add these to his total: 31 + 23 = 54 stickers.

Charlie then gave 9 stickers to his sister, so we subtract these from his total: 54 - 9 = 45 stickers.

Finally, Charlie used 28 stickers to decorate a greeting card, so we subtract these from his total: 45 - 28 = 17 stickers.

So, Charlie has 17 stickers left.
