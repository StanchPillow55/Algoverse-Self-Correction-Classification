Question ID: 346
Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

Jenny's son eats 4 cookies a day for 5 days, so he eats 4*5 = <<4*5=20>>20 cookies a week.

Her husband eats 1 cookie a day for 7 days, so he eats 1*7 = <<1*7=7>>7 cookies a week.

Together, her son and husband eat 20+7 = <<20+7=27>>27 cookies a week.

Since the bag of cookies has 36 cookies, and her son and husband eat 27 cookies, Jenny eats 36-27 = <<36-27=9>>9 cookies a week. 

So, Jenny eats 9 cookies a week.
