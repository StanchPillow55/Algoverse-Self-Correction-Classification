Dataset Type: math
==================================================

Abby eats 2 slices of bread a day and Josh eats twice as much, which means Josh eats 2*2 = 4 slices a day.

Together, Abby and Josh eat 2+4 = <<2+4=6>>6 slices a day.

If a loaf of bread has 24 slices, then the loaf will last for 24/6 = <<24/6=4>>4 days.

So, the loaf of bread will last for 4 days.
