Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, let's determine how many lemons Tim collects from one tree in a year. According to the problem, he collects 6 lemons from each tree per year.

Tim has 5 trees, so in one year, he collects 5 trees * 6 lemons/tree = 30 lemons.

A decade is 10 years. So over a decade, Tim collects 30 lemons/year * 10 years = 300 lemons.

So, Tim collects 300 lemons from his trees in a decade.
