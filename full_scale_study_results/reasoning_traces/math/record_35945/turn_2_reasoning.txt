Question ID: record_35945
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, I will need to determine the appropriate name to replace the @placeholder in the given query.

Given information:
- The passage discusses two iconic women, Helen Gurley Brown and Phyllis Diller, who recently passed away.
- The passage states that both women used their appearance as a means to an end, with Diller mocking her appearance and Gurley Brown using her appearance to get ahead.

Based on the information provided in the passage, the name that would best fit the @placeholder in the query is "Phyllis Diller".

Reasoning:
1. The passage states that Phyllis Diller used her appearance to make herself the "butt of the joke", which aligns with the description of the person being "clad in her signature fire engine red suit and fishnets".
2. The passage does not mention Helen Gurley Brown wearing a distinctive red suit and fishnets, but rather focuses on her using her appearance to "get ahead personally and professionally".
3. Therefore, the description in the query is more consistent with Phyllis Diller's approach to using her appearance, as described in the passage.

Final answer:
