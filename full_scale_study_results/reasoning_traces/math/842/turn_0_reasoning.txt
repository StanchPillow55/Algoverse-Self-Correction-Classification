Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

Thea gave the craftsman four $20 bills, so she gave him a total of 4 * $20 = $<<4*20=80>>80.

The hat cost $70, so the craftsman needs to give Thea change. 

To calculate the change, subtract the cost of the hat from the total amount Thea gave the craftsman. 

So, $80 - $70 = $<<80-70=10>>10.

Therefore, Thea got $10 in change.
