Question ID: 298
Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

Carmen starts the bidding at $200. Then, three other people each bid once, raising the price by $50 each time. This means the price of the desk increases by 3 * $50 = $<<3*50=150>>150.

Carmen then bids after each of these people, meaning she also raises the price three times by $50 each time. This means she increases the price by another 3 * $50 = $<<3*50=150>>150.

Adding all these increases to the original price, the final cost of the desk for Carmen is $200 + $150 + $150 = $<<200+150+150=500>>500.

So, Carmen pays $500 for the desk.
