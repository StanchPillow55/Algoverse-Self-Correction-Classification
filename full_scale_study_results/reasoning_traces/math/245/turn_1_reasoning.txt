==================================================

Let's denote the number of fish in each aquarium as F. 

According to the problem, the difference between the number of snails in the two aquariums is twice the total amount of fish in both aquariums. 

The difference between the number of snails in the two aquariums is 32 - 4 = 28 snails. 

So, we can set up the equation: 

2 * (F + F) = 28 

Solving this equation will give us the number of fish in each aquarium. 

First, simplify the left side of the equation: 

4F = 28 

Then, divide both sides of the equation by 4 to solve for F: 

F = 28 / 4 

F = 7 

So, there are 7 fish in each aquarium.
