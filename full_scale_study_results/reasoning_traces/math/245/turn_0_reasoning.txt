==================================================

To solve the problem, let's define the variables and set up the equations based on the information given.

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( F \) be the number of fish in each aquarium.
   - The first aquarium has 4 snails.
   - The second aquarium has 32 snails.

2. **Calculate the Difference in Snails:**
   - The difference in the number of snails between the two aquariums is:
     \[
     32 - 4 = 28
     \]

3. **Set Up the Equation:**
   - According to the problem, this difference (28) is twice the amount of fish in both aquariums. Since both aquariums have the same number of fish, the total number of fish in both aquariums is \( 2F \).
   - Therefore, we can write the equation:
     \[
     28 = 2F
     \]

4. **Solve for \( F \):**
   - To find \( F \), we divide both sides of the equation by 2:
     \[
     F = \frac{28}{2} = 14
     \]

5. **Conclusion:**
   - Each aquarium has \( F = 14 \) fish.

Thus, the final answer is that there are **14 fish in each aquarium**.
