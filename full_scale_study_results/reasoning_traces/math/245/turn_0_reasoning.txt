Let's denote the number of fish in each aquarium as F. 

According to the problem, the difference between the number of snails in the two aquariums is 32 - 4 = 28 snails. 

The problem also states that this difference is twice the total number of fish in both aquariums. Since both aquariums have the same number of fish, the total number of fish is 2F. 

Therefore, we can set up the following equation: 

2F = 28 

To solve for F, we divide both sides of the equation by 2: 

F = 28 / 2 = 14 

So, there are 14 fish in each aquarium.
