Question ID: 245
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to break it down step by step.

1. **Identify the number of snails in each aquarium**:
   - Aquarium 1 has 4 snails.
   - Aquarium 2 has 32 snails.

2. **Calculate the difference in the number of snails**:
   \[
   \text{Difference} = \text{Number of snails in Aquarium 2} - \text{Number of snails in Aquarium 1} = 32 - 4 = 28
   \]

3. **Let \( x \) be the number of fish in each aquarium**:
   Since both aquariums have the same number of fish, we denote the number of fish in each aquarium as \( x \).

4. **According to the problem, the difference in the number of snails is twice the amount of fish in both aquariums**:
   The total number of fish in both aquariums is \( x + x = 2x \).
   Therefore, we can set up the equation based on the information given:
   \[
   28 = 2x
   \]

5. **Solve for \( x \)**:
   To find \( x \), we divide both sides of the equation by 2:
   \[
   x = \frac{28}{2} = 14
   \]

6. **Conclusion**:
   Each aquarium has \( 14 \) fish.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\text{There are 14 fish in each aquarium.}
\]
