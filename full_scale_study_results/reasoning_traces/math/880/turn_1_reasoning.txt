Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total amount Sarah will receive from selling the rope.**

   Sarah's rope is 20 meters long, and her friend is willing to pay $2 per meter. Therefore, the total amount Sarah will receive is calculated by multiplying the length of the rope by the price per meter:

   \[
   \text{Total received} = 20 \, \text{meters} \times 2 \, \text{dollars/meter} = 40 \, \text{dollars}
   \]

2. **Determine the cost of the new rope Sarah wants to buy.**

   The new rope costs $1.5 per meter. Since Sarah wants to buy a rope that is also 20 meters long, we calculate the total cost of the new rope as follows:

   \[
   \text{Cost of new rope} = 20 \, \text{meters} \times 1.5 \, \text{dollars/meter} = 30 \, \text{dollars}
   \]

3. **Calculate the amount of money Sarah will have left over.**

   To find out how much money Sarah will have left after buying the new rope, we subtract the cost of the new rope from the total amount she received from selling the old rope:

   \[
   \text{Money left over} = 40 \, \text{dollars} - 30 \, \text{dollars} = 10 \, \text{dollars}
   \]

Therefore, after buying the new rope, Sarah will have $10 left over.

**Final Answer: Sarah will have $10 left over.**
