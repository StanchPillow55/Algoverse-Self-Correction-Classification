Question ID: 880
Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to calculate how much money Sarah will get from selling her rope. Since her friend is willing to buy it for $2 a meter and the rope is 20 meters long, we multiply 20 meters by $2/meter to get the total amount of money she will receive. 

20 meters * $2/meter = $40

Next, we need to calculate how much it will cost Sarah to buy a new rope. The new rope costs $1.5 a meter and she needs 20 meters, so we multiply 20 meters by $1.5/meter to get the total cost of the new rope.

20 meters * $1.5/meter = $30

Finally, we subtract the cost of the new rope from the money she received from selling her old rope to find out how much money she will have left over.

$40 - $30 = $10

So, Sarah will have $10 left over after she buys the new rope.
