Question ID: 880
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total amount Sarah will receive from selling the rope:**

   Sarah's rope is 20 meters long, and her friend is willing to pay $2 per meter. Therefore, the total amount Sarah will receive from selling the rope is calculated as follows:

   \[
   \text{Total amount received} = \text{Length of rope} \times \text{Price per meter} = 20 \, \text{meters} \times 2 \, \text{dollars/meter} = 40 \, \text{dollars}
   \]

2. **Determine how much the new rope will cost:**

   Sarah wants to buy a new rope, and the cost of the new rope is $1.5 per meter. Since she wants to replace the entire 20 meters, the cost of the new rope is:

   \[
   \text{Cost of new rope} = \text{Length of new rope} \times \text{Price per meter} = 20 \, \text{meters} \times 1.5 \, \text{dollars/meter} = 30 \, \text{dollars}
   \]

3. **Calculate the money Sarah will have left over:**

   To find out how much money Sarah will have left after buying the new rope, we subtract the cost of the new rope from the total amount she received from selling the old rope:

   \[
   \text{Money left over} = \text{Total amount received} - \text{Cost of new rope} = 40 \, \text{dollars} - 30 \, \text{dollars} = 10 \, \text{dollars}
   \]

Therefore, Sarah will have $10 left over after buying the new rope.

**Final Answer: Sarah will have $10 left over.**
