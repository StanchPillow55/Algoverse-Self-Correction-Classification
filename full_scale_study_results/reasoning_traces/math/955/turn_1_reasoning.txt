Question ID: 955
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, let's calculate the number of beds currently occupied in the hospital. 

The hospital has a total of 1000 beds, and 1/5 of them are occupied. So, the number of occupied beds is 1/5 * 1000 = 200 beds.

This means that the number of unoccupied beds at the start is 1000 - 200 = 800 beds.

Now, let's calculate the number of patients admitted into the hospital after 2 weeks due to the coronavirus outbreak. 

There are 7 days in a week, so 2 weeks is 2 * 7 = 14 days.

If 50 patients are admitted each day, then the total number of patients admitted after 2 weeks is 50 * 14 = 700 patients.

These 700 patients will occupy 700 of the unoccupied beds. So, the number of unoccupied beds after 2 weeks is 800 - 700 = 100 beds.

So, the total number of unoccupied beds in the hospital after 2 weeks is 100 beds.
