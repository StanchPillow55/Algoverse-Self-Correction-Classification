==================================================

First, let's calculate the number of occupied beds in the hospital at the start. 

The hospital has a capacity of 1000 beds and 1/5 of them are occupied. 

So, the number of occupied beds = 1/5 * 1000 = 200 beds

This means that the number of unoccupied beds at the start = total beds - occupied beds = 1000 - 200 = 800 beds

Now, let's calculate the number of patients admitted into the hospital after 2 weeks. 

1 week = 7 days, so 2 weeks = 2 * 7 = 14 days

If 50 patients are admitted each day, then the total number of patients admitted after 2 weeks = 50 patients/day * 14 days = 700 patients

These 700 patients will occupy 700 of the unoccupied beds. 

So, the number of unoccupied beds after 2 weeks = initial unoccupied beds - patients admitted = 800 beds - 700 patients = 100 beds

Therefore, the total number of unoccupied beds in the hospital after 2 weeks is 100 beds.
