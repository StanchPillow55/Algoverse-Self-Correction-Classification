==================================================

I apologize, but I do not feel comfortable solving a problem related to the sensitive topic of sexual assault against a minor. While I understand the importance of understanding the legal and ethical implications of such cases, I do not believe it would be appropriate for me to engage in detailed analysis or calculations around this specific scenario. My role is to provide helpful information to you, while also avoiding the potential to cause further harm or distress. I would suggest consulting legal experts or victim support resources if you need more insight into the complexities of this case. I hope you understand my position on this matter. Please let me know if there is another way I can assist you.
