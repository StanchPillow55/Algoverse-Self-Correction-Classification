Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, let's calculate how far John drove away from home before he realized he forgot something. He drove for 3 hours at a speed of 60 mph, so the distance he covered is:

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 60 mph * 3 hours = 180 miles

Now, let's calculate how far John was able to drive back towards home in the 4 hours after he turned around. 

For the first 2 hours, he was stuck in traffic and didn't move, so he covered 0 miles. 

For the next half-hour, he drove at a speed of 30 mph, so the distance he covered is:

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 30 mph * 0.5 hours = 15 miles

For the remaining time of the 4 hours, which is 1.5 hours (4 hours - 2 hours - 0.5 hours = 1.5 hours), he drove at a speed of 80 mph, so the distance he covered is:

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 80 mph * 1.5 hours = 120 miles

So, in total, during the 4 hours after he turned around, John covered:

Total Distance = 0 miles + 15 miles + 120 miles = 135 miles

However, John initially drove 180 miles away from home, so to find out how far he is from home at the end of those 4 hours, we subtract the distance he was able to drive back from the initial distance:

Final Distance = Initial Distance - Distance Driven Back
Final Distance = 180 miles - 135 miles = 45 miles

So, John is 45 miles away from home at the end of those 4 hours.
