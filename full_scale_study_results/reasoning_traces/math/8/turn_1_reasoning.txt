Question ID: 8
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, let's calculate how far John drove before he realized he forgot something at home. He drove for 3 hours at a speed of 60 mph. The distance he covered is calculated by multiplying the time by the speed, so:

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 60 mph * 3 hours = 180 miles

Now, let's calculate how far he drove on his way back home. He spent the first 2 hours in standstill traffic, so he didn't cover any distance during that time. 

Then, he drove for half an hour at a speed of 30 mph. The distance he covered during that time is:

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 30 mph * 0.5 hours = 15 miles

Finally, he drove for the remaining time of the 4 hours (4 hours - 2 hours - 0.5 hours = 1.5 hours) at a speed of 80 mph. The distance he covered during that time is:

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 80 mph * 1.5 hours = 120 miles

So, the total distance he covered on his way back home is:

Total Distance = 0 miles (standstill traffic) + 15 miles + 120 miles = 135 miles

However, he initially drove 180 miles away from home. So, to find out how far he is from home at the end of those 4 hours, we subtract the distance he covered on his way back from the initial distance:

Distance from home = Initial Distance - Distance covered on the way back
Distance from home = 180 miles - 135 miles = 45 miles

So, John is 45 miles away from home at the end of those 4 hours.
