Question ID: 8
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, let's calculate how far John drove away from home. He drove for 3 hours at a speed of 60 mph. Distance is calculated by multiplying time by speed, so John drove 3 hours * 60 mph = 180 miles away from home.

Next, let's calculate how far John drove back towards home. He was stuck in traffic for 2 hours, so he didn't cover any distance during that time. He then drove for half an hour at a speed of 30 mph, so he covered 0.5 hours * 30 mph = 15 miles. Finally, he drove for the remaining time of 4 hours - 2 hours - 0.5 hours = 1.5 hours at a speed of 80 mph, so he covered 1.5 hours * 80 mph = 120 miles.

Adding up these distances, John drove 15 miles + 120 miles = 135 miles back towards home.

To find out how far he is from home at the end of those 4 hours, we subtract the distance he drove back from the distance he drove away. So, John is 180 miles - 135 miles = 45 miles away from home.

So, the final answer is that John is 45 miles away from home.
