Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to find out how many miles Soledad can cover in a day if she walks twice a day, covering 125 miles each time. 

So, 125 miles/walk * 2 walks/day = 250 miles/day

Next, we need to find out how many days are in the month of June to know how many days Soledad has for her hiking journey. 

June has 30 days.

So, if she walks 250 miles every day for 30 days, she will cover:

250 miles/day * 30 days = 7500 miles

However, Soledad wants to hike 9300 miles in June. 

So, to find out how many more miles per day she must hike to complete her journey on time, we subtract the miles she can already cover from her goal:

9300 miles - 7500 miles = 1800 miles

So, Soledad has 1800 more miles to cover in 30 days. 

To find out how many more miles she needs to hike per day, we divide the total additional miles by the number of days:

1800 miles / 30 days = 60 miles/day

So, Soledad must hike an additional 60 miles per day to complete her journey on time. 

Therefore, the final answer is 60 miles per day.
