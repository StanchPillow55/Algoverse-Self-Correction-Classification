==================================================

To determine how many more miles per day Soledad must hike to complete her journey of 9,300 miles in June, we will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of days in June**:
   June has 30 days.

2. **Calculate the total distance Soledad plans to hike**:
   Soledad plans to hike 125 miles twice a day. Therefore, the total distance she plans to hike each day is:
   \[
   125 \text{ miles} \times 2 = 250 \text{ miles per day}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total distance she will hike in June**:
   If she hikes 250 miles each day for 30 days, the total distance she will hike in June is:
   \[
   250 \text{ miles/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 7,500 \text{ miles}
   \]

4. **Determine how many more miles she needs to hike**:
   Soledad wants to hike a total of 9,300 miles. To find out how many more miles she needs to hike beyond the 7,500 miles she will cover, we subtract the distance she will hike from her goal:
   \[
   9,300 \text{ miles} - 7,500 \text{ miles} = 1,800 \text{ miles}
   \]

5. **Calculate how many additional miles she needs to hike per day**:
   To find out how many more miles she needs to hike each day, we divide the additional miles by the number of days in June:
   \[
   \frac{1,800 \text{ miles}}{30 \text{ days}} = 60 \text{ miles per day}
   \]

6. **Final answer**:
   Soledad must hike an additional **60 miles per day** to complete her journey of 9,300 miles in June.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{60}
\]
