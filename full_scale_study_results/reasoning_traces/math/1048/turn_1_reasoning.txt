==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to understand that the car's value is decreasing by 21% each year. This is a case of exponential decay, where the value of an item decreases at a constant percentage rate over time. 

The formula for exponential decay is:

V = P * (1 - r)^t

where:
- V is the final value
- P is the initial value
- r is the rate of decay
- t is the time (in years)

In this case:
- P = $20000 (the initial price of the car)
- r = 21% or 0.21 (the rate of depreciation)
- t = 2010 - 2007 = 3 years (the number of years from 2007 to 2010)

Substituting these values into the formula, we get:

V = $20000 * (1 - 0.21)^3

First, calculate the value of (1 - 0.21):

1 - 0.21 = 0.79

Then, raise this value to the power of 3:

0.79^3 = 0.493039

Finally, multiply this value by the initial price of the car:

V = $20000 * 0.493039 = $9860.78

So, the price of the car in the year 2010 would be approximately $9860.78.
