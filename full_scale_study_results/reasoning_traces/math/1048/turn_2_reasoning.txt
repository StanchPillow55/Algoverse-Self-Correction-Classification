==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to understand that depreciation is a decrease in the value of an asset over time. In this case, the car's value decreases by 21% each year. 

The formula to calculate depreciation is:

Final Value = Initial Value * (1 - Depreciation Rate) ^ Number of Years

Where:
- Initial Value is the original price of the car, which is $20000.
- Depreciation Rate is 21%, or 0.21 in decimal form.
- Number of Years is the difference between 2010 and 2007, which is 3 years.

Substituting these values into the formula, we get:

Final Value = $20000 * (1 - 0.21) ^ 3

First, calculate the value inside the parentheses:

1 - 0.21 = 0.79

So, the formula becomes:

Final Value = $20000 * 0.79 ^ 3

Next, calculate the value of 0.79 raised to the power of 3:

0.79 ^ 3 = 0.493039

So, the formula becomes:

Final Value = $20000 * 0.493039

Finally, multiply $20000 by 0.493039 to get the final value:

Final Value = $20000 * 0.493039 = $9860.78

So, the price of the car in the year 2010 would be approximately $9860.78.
