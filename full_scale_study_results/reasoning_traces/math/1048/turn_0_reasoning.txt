The price of the car depreciates at a constant rate of 21% per year. This means that each year, the car's value is 79% (100% - 21%) of its value the previous year. 

To find the price of the car in 2010, we need to calculate the car's value after 3 years of depreciation (from 2007 to 2010).

Let's denote the price of the car in the year 2007 as P. We know that P = $20000.

After one year (in 2008), the price of the car will be 79% of its original price. We can calculate this as follows:

P_2008 = P * 0.79 = $20000 * 0.79 = $15800.

After two years (in 2009), the price of the car will be 79% of its price in 2008. We can calculate this as follows:

P_2009 = P_2008 * 0.79 = $15800 * 0.79 = $12482.

After three years (in 2010), the price of the car will be 79% of its price in 2009. We can calculate this as follows:

P_2010 = P_2009 * 0.79 = $12482 * 0.79 = $9860.58.

So, the price of the car in the year 2010 will be approximately $9860.58.
