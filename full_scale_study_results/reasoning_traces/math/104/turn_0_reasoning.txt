Question ID: 104
Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to find out how many pieces Poppy placed on the board. Since she placed a quarter of the pieces, we multiply 1000 by 1/4:

1000 * 1/4 = 250 pieces

So, Poppy placed 250 pieces on the board. 

To find out how many pieces are left, we subtract the number of pieces Poppy placed from the total number of pieces:

1000 - 250 = 750 pieces

So, there are 750 pieces left after Poppy places her pieces.

Next, we need to find out how many pieces Poppy's mom placed on the board. Since she placed a third of the remaining pieces, we multiply 750 by 1/3:

750 * 1/3 = 250 pieces

So, Poppy's mom placed 250 pieces on the board.

To find out how many pieces are left, we subtract the number of pieces Poppy's mom placed from the remaining number of pieces:

750 - 250 = 500 pieces

So, there are 500 pieces left to be placed. 

Therefore, the final answer is 500 pieces.
