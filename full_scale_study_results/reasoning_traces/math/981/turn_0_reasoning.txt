Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

Joe caught 3 pounds of crawfish on Thursday.

On Friday, he caught 4 times the amount he caught on Thursday. So, he caught 4 * 3 = <<4*3=12>>12 pounds of crawfish on Friday.

On Saturday, he caught half the amount he caught on Friday. So, he caught 1/2 * 12 = <<1/2*12=6>>6 pounds of crawfish on Saturday.

In total, Joe caught 3 + 12 + 6 = <<3+12+6=21>>21 pounds of crawfish.

Since 1 serving of crawfish is 3 pounds, Joe has 21 / 3 = <<21/3=7>>7 servings of crawfish.

So, Joe has 7 servings of crawfish.
