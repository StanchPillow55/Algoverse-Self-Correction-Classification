Question ID: 1155
Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to find out how long the second song is. We know that it is 60% longer than the first song, which is 5 minutes long. 

To find the length of the second song, we calculate 60% of 5 minutes. 

60/100 * 5 = 3 minutes

This means the second song is 3 minutes longer than the first song. 

So, the total length of the second song is 5 minutes (the length of the first song) plus 3 minutes (the additional length of the second song), which equals 8 minutes. 

To find the total length of the cassette, we add the lengths of the two songs together. 

5 minutes (first song) + 8 minutes (second song) = 13 minutes

So, the total length of the cassette is 13 minutes.
