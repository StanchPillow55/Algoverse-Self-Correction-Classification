Question ID: 312
Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

Let's start by figuring out Jane's age. The problem tells us that Jane is 3 years younger than Quinn, who is 30 years old. So, we subtract 3 from 30 to find Jane's age:

30 - 3 = 27

So, Jane is 27 years old.

The problem also tells us that Trent is 5 years older than Jane. So, we add 5 to Jane's age to find Trent's age:

27 + 5 = 32

So, Trent is 32 years old.

Therefore, the final answer is Trent is 32 years old.
