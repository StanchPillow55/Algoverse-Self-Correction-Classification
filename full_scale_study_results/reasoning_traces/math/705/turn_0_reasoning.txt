Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to find out how fast the turtle is. Since we know that the cat is 5 times faster than the turtle, we can find the turtle's speed by dividing the cat's speed by 5.

The cat's speed is 15 feet/second, so the turtle's speed is 15 feet/second รท 5 = 3 feet/second.

Next, we need to find out how far the turtle can crawl in 40 seconds. We can do this by multiplying the turtle's speed by the amount of time it's moving.

The turtle's speed is 3 feet/second, so in 40 seconds, the turtle can crawl 3 feet/second * 40 seconds = 120 feet.

So, Martha's turtle can crawl 120 feet in 40 seconds.
