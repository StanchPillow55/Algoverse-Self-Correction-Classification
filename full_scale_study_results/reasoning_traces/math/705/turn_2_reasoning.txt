Question ID: 705
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

Given that Martha's cat is 5 times faster than her turtle, and the cat can run 15 feet per second, we can find the speed of the turtle by dividing the cat's speed by 5.

Speed of turtle = Speed of cat / 5
Speed of turtle = 15 feet/second / 5 = 3 feet/second

So, the turtle can crawl 3 feet in one second.

To find out how many feet the turtle can crawl in 40 seconds, we multiply the turtle's speed by the time.

Distance = Speed x Time
Distance = 3 feet/second x 40 seconds = 120 feet

So, Martha's turtle can crawl 120 feet in 40 seconds.
