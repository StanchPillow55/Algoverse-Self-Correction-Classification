Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

Given that Martha's cat is 5 times faster than her turtle, we can find the speed of the turtle by dividing the cat's speed by 5. 

The cat's speed is given as 15 feet/second. 

So, the turtle's speed = Cat's speed / 5
                             = 15 feet/second / 5
                             = 3 feet/second

This means the turtle can crawl 3 feet in one second.

To find out how far the turtle can crawl in 40 seconds, we multiply the turtle's speed by the time.

Distance = Speed x Time
                = 3 feet/second x 40 seconds
                = 120 feet

So, Martha's turtle can crawl 120 feet in 40 seconds.
