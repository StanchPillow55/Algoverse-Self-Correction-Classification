Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

Fred initially made 24 gallons of root beer.

On the first day, his children drank 4 gallons, so the remaining amount is 24 - 4 = 20 gallons.

On the second day, his wife spilled 7 gallons, so the remaining amount is 20 - 7 = 13 gallons.

On the third day, his friend Ronnie drank 5 gallons, so the remaining amount is 13 - 5 = 8 gallons.

On the fourth day, there were 3 people at the party, including Fred. So, the root beer was shared equally among 3 people.

Therefore, each person had 8/3 = 2.67 gallons of root beer to drink during the party.

So, each person had approximately 2.67 gallons of root beer to drink during the party.
