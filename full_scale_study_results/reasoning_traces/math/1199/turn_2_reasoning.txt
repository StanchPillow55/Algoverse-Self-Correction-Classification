Question ID: 1199
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine how much root beer is left by the fourth day and then divide it equally among Fred and the three party attendees.

**Step-by-step Calculation:**

1. **Initial Amount:**
   - Fred made 24 gallons of root beer on the first day.

2. **After the First Day:**
   - Fred's children drank 4 gallons.
   - Remaining root beer = 24 gallons - 4 gallons = 20 gallons.

3. **After the Second Day:**
   - Fred's wife Barbie spilled 7 gallons.
   - Remaining root beer = 20 gallons - 7 gallons = 13 gallons.

4. **After the Third Day:**
   - Fred's friend Ronnie drank 5 gallons.
   - Remaining root beer = 13 gallons - 5 gallons = 8 gallons.

5. **On the Fourth Day:**
   - Fred and 3 other people (total of 4 people) will share the remaining root beer equally.
   - Amount per person = 8 gallons รท 4 people = 2 gallons per person.

**Final Answer:**
Each person at the party, including Fred, had 2 gallons of root beer to drink.
