Question ID: 1199
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

Let's start by calculating the total amount of root beer Fred had left after each day's events.

On the first day, Fred made 24 gallons of root beer. His children drank 4 gallons, so we subtract 4 from 24 to find out how much was left:

24 gallons - 4 gallons = 20 gallons

On the second day, his wife spilled 7 gallons of root beer. So, we subtract 7 from the remaining 20 gallons:

20 gallons - 7 gallons = 13 gallons

On the third day, Fred's friend Ronnie drank 5 gallons of root beer. So, we subtract 5 from the remaining 13 gallons:

13 gallons - 5 gallons = 8 gallons

So, on the fourth day, Fred had 8 gallons of root beer left for the party.

If Fred and the 3 guests shared the remaining root beer equally, we divide the remaining amount by the total number of people, which is 4 (Fred + 3 guests):

8 gallons รท 4 people = 2 gallons per person

So, each person at the party had 2 gallons of root beer to drink.
