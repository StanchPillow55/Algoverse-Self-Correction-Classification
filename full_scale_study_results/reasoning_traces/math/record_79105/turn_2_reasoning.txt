Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine who the "placeholder" in the query refers to.

Given information:
- The query mentions that "fifty years ago, @placeholder contended with similar public ignorance -- and similar industry misinformation -- about the hazards of cigarette smoking."

Based on the context, the "placeholder" is likely referring to the Surgeon General of the United States.

Reasoning:
1. Fifty years ago, the Surgeon General was the leading public health authority in the United States.
2. The Surgeon General was responsible for informing the public about health hazards and risks, including the dangers of cigarette smoking.
3. The tobacco industry at the time was actively spreading misinformation and downplaying the health risks of smoking, similar to the current situation with the gun industry.
4. The Surgeon General played a crucial role in countering the industry's misinformation and raising public awareness about the hazards of smoking.

Therefore, the final answer is:

The Surgeon General of the United States contended with similar public ignorance and industry misinformation about the hazards of cigarette smoking fifty years ago.
