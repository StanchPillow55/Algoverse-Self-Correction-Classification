==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given information and determine the missing placeholder in the query.

Given information:
- The passage discusses President Obama's efforts to pass gun legislation and the challenges he faces.
- The passage suggests that Obama may need a "Plan B" to address the issue of gun control.
- The query mentions that 50 years ago, someone contended with similar public ignorance and industry misinformation about the hazards of cigarette smoking.

To find the missing placeholder, we need to identify who contended with the public ignorance and industry misinformation about the hazards of cigarette smoking 50 years ago.

Based on the context, the most likely answer is the Surgeon General.

The passage suggests that one of Obama's "Plan B" options could be a Surgeon General's report on the hazards of guns, similar to how the Surgeon General addressed the hazards of cigarette smoking in the past.

Therefore, the missing placeholder in the query is "the Surgeon General".

The complete reasoning and work is as follows:

1. The passage discusses the challenges President Obama faces in passing gun legislation and suggests he may need a "Plan B".
2.
