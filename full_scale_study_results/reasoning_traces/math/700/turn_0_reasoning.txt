Question ID: 700
Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to find out how many fireworks the city is going to set off. We do this by multiplying the number of boxes by the number of fireworks in each box. 

15 boxes * 20 fireworks/box = 300 fireworks

Next, we need to find out how many of these fireworks Hannah can see. We do this by multiplying the total number of fireworks by the percentage she can see. 

300 fireworks * 40% = 120 fireworks

Then, we need to find out how many fireworks Hannah is going to set off in her backyard. We do this by multiplying the number of boxes by the number of fireworks in each box. 

3 boxes * 5 fireworks/box = 15 fireworks

Finally, we add the number of fireworks Hannah can see from the city's display to the number of fireworks she's setting off in her backyard to find the total number of fireworks she will see. 

120 fireworks + 15 fireworks = 135 fireworks

So, Hannah will see a total of 135 fireworks.
