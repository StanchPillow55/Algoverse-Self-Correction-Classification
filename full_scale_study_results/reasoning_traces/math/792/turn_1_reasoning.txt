==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine how much money Damien makes in a 30-day month by collecting bottle caps, given that each bottle cap is worth $0.25.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Determine the number of bottle caps Damien finds in one day:**
   - Damien finds 10 bottle caps each day.

2. **Calculate the total number of bottle caps Damien finds in a 30-day month:**
   - Since Damien finds 10 bottle caps per day, in 30 days, he will find:
     \[
     10 \text{ bottle caps/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 300 \text{ bottle caps}
     \]

3. **Determine the value of one bottle cap:**
   - Each bottle cap is worth $0.25.

4. **Calculate the total value of the bottle caps Damien finds in a 30-day month:**
   - To find the total value, multiply the total number of bottle caps by the value of each bottle cap:
     \[
     300 \text{ bottle caps} \times \$0.25/\text{bottle cap} = \$75
     \]

5. **Conclusion:**
   - Damien makes $75 in a 30-day month by collecting bottle caps.

Therefore, the final answer is that Damien makes **$75** in a 30-day month.
