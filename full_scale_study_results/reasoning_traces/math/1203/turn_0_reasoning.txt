Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to find out how tall Mattison's house is. Since his house is 7 times as tall as he is, we multiply Mattison's height by 7.

60 inches * 7 = 420 inches

Next, we find out how high the ceiling on the first floor is. Since the floor to the ceiling on the first floor is thrice as high as Mattison, we multiply Mattison's height by 3.

60 inches * 3 = 180 inches

To find out how high the roof is from the second floor's floor, we subtract the height of the first floor from the total height of the house.

420 inches - 180 inches = 240 inches

Therefore, the roof is 240 inches from the second floor's floor.
