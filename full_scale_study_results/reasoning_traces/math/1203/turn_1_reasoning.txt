Question ID: 1203
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to find out how tall Mattison's house is. Since we know that his house is 7 times as tall as he is, we can multiply Mattison's height by 7.

60 inches * 7 = 420 inches

So, Mattison's house is 420 inches tall.

Next, we need to find out how high the ceiling is on the first floor. Since we know that the floor to the ceiling on the first floor is thrice as high as Mattison, we can multiply Mattison's height by 3.

60 inches * 3 = 180 inches

So, the ceiling on the first floor is 180 inches high.

Finally, to find out how high the roof is from the second floor's floor, we need to subtract the height of the first floor from the total height of the house.

420 inches (total height of the house) - 180 inches (height of the first floor) = 240 inches

So, the roof is 240 inches high from the second floor's floor. 

Therefore, the final answer is 240 inches.
