Question ID: 1042
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, Johnny's dad lost $5 on the first race.

Second, he won $1 more than twice the amount he previously lost. So, he won 2 * $5 + $1 = $11.

Third, he lost 1.5 times as much as he won in the second race. So, he lost 1.5 * $11 = $16.5.

Now, let's calculate the total amount of money Johnny's dad lost. He lost $5 in the first race and $16.5 in the third race, so the total amount he lost is $5 + $16.5 = $21.5.

However, he also won $11 in the second race. So, the net amount he lost is $21.5 - $11 = $10.5.

The problem asks for the average amount he lost per race. Since there were three races, we divide the total loss by the number of races: $10.5 / 3 = $3.5.

Therefore, Johnny's dad lost an average of $3.5 per race.
