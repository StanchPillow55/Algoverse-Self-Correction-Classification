==================================================

First, let's calculate how much Johnny's dad won on the second race. He won $1 more than twice the amount he previously lost, which was $5. 

Twice the amount he lost is 2 * $5 = $10.

So, he won $10 + $1 = $11 on the second race.

On the third race, he lost 1.5 times as much as he won in the second race. 

1.5 times the amount he won in the second race is 1.5 * $11 = $16.5.

So, he lost $16.5 on the third race.

Now, let's calculate the total amount of money he lost. 

He lost $5 on the first race, won $11 on the second race, and lost $16.5 on the third race. 

So, the total amount of money he lost is $5 - $11 + $16.5 = $10.5.

The average amount of money he lost per race is the total amount of money he lost divided by the number of races. 

There were 3 races, so the average amount of money he lost per race is $10.5 / 3 = $3.5.

Therefore, Johnny's dad lost an average of $3.5 per race.
