Question ID: 1042
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, let's calculate how much Johnny's dad won on the second race. He won $1 more than twice the amount he previously lost, which was $5. So, he won 2 * $5 + $1 = $11.

On the third race, he lost 1.5 times as much as he won in the second race. So, he lost 1.5 * $11 = $16.5.

Now, let's calculate the total amount he lost that day. He lost $5 on the first race and $16.5 on the third race, so he lost a total of $5 + $16.5 = $21.5.

However, he also won $11 on the second race. So, the net amount he lost is $21.5 - $11 = $10.5.

Since there were 3 races that day, the average amount he lost per race is $10.5 / 3 = $3.5.

Therefore, Johnny's dad lost an average of $3.5 per race that day.
