==================================================

Let's start by figuring out how many squares of each color there are.

We know there are 14 red squares.

We're told there are 4 more blue squares than red squares, so there are 14 red squares + 4 blue squares = 18 blue squares.

We're told there are 6 more green squares than blue squares, so there are 18 blue squares + 6 green squares = 24 green squares.

We're told there are 12 fewer white squares than green squares, so there are 24 green squares - 12 white squares = 12 white squares.

Now we just need to add up all the squares to find the total number of squares, which will tell us the total square footage of the comforter (since each square is 1 foot by 1 foot).

So the total number of squares is 14 red squares + 18 blue squares + 24 green squares + 12 white squares = 68 squares.

Therefore, Brittany's comforter is 68 square feet.
