==================================================

Mulan starts with $40 and her father gives her an additional $100. We add these two amounts together to find out how much money Mulan has in total before she starts shopping.

$40 + $100 = $140

Next, we need to calculate the total cost of the items Mulan buys. She buys two pairs of jeans at $30 each and a bag for $20. 

The total cost of the jeans is 2 * $30 = $60.

So, the total cost of all her shopping is $60 (for the jeans) + $20 (for the bag) = $80.

Finally, we subtract the total cost of the items Mulan buys from the total amount of money she had before she started shopping to find out how much money she has left.

$140 - $80 = $60

So, Mulan has $60 left.
