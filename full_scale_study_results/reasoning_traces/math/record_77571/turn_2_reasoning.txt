Question ID: record_77571
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, I will need to determine the appropriate placeholder value to fill in the given sentence.

Based on the passage, the key information is that the Whitby Goth Weekend is a festival that celebrates gothic culture. The passage mentions that attendees "don the their spookiest finery" for the event.

Therefore, the most appropriate placeholder value would be "gothic" to describe the woman's attire as she enjoys her ice cream on the seafront.

The complete sentence with the placeholder filled in would be:

"Even Goths like ice cream: A woman in full gothic regalia chats to two locals on the seafront as she enjoys her ice cream."
