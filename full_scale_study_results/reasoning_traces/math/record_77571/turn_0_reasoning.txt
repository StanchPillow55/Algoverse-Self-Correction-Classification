To solve this problem, we need to find the value of the placeholder in the given query.

Given information:
- The passage mentions that the Whitby Goth Weekend is a twice-yearly celebration of gothic culture.
- The query states that "Even Goths like ice cream: A woman in full @placeholder regalia chats to two locals on the seafront as she enjoys her ice cream."

Based on the information provided, the placeholder should be a word that describes the type of clothing or attire worn by Goths.

The passage mentions that the attendees of the Whitby Goth Weekend "don their spookiest finery for the five-day extravaganza." This suggests that the Goths wear elaborate, gothic-inspired clothing or attire.

Therefore, the most appropriate word to fill the placeholder is "gothic."

Final answer: The placeholder should be filled with the word "gothic."
