Question ID: 922
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

Martha started collecting shells when she was 5 years old and she collects one shell every month. We need to find out how many shells she will have collected by her 10th birthday.

First, we need to calculate how many months there are from her 5th to her 10th birthday. 

There are 12 months in a year. So, the total number of months from her 5th to her 10th birthday is 5 years times 12 months, which is 60 months.

Since Martha collects one shell every month, the total number of shells she will have collected by her 10th birthday is equal to the total number of months from her 5th to her 10th birthday.

Therefore, Martha will have collected 60 shells by her 10th birthday.
