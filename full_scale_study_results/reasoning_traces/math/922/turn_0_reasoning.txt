Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to calculate how many months have passed from Martha's 5th birthday to her 10th birthday. 

There are 12 months in a year, so the number of months from her 5th to her 10th birthday is 5 years * 12 months/year = 60 months.

Since Martha collects one shell every month, the total number of shells she will have collected by her 10th birthday is equal to the number of months that have passed since she started collecting shells.

Therefore, Martha will have collected 60 shells by her 10th birthday.
