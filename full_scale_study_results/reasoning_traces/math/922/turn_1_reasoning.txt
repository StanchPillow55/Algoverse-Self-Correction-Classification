Question ID: 922
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

Martha started collecting shells when she was 5 years old and she collects one shell every month. We need to find out how many shells she has collected by her 10th birthday.

First, we need to calculate how many months are there from her 5th birthday to her 10th birthday.

There are 12 months in a year. So, the total number of months from her 5th to 10th birthday is:

5 years * 12 months/year = 60 months

Since Martha collects one shell every month, the total number of shells she has collected by her 10th birthday is equal to the total number of months from her 5th to 10th birthday.

So, Martha has collected 60 shells by her 10th birthday.
