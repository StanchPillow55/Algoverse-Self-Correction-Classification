Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, let's find out how many chocolate bars there are in total. 

Since each packet contains 5 chocolate bars and there are 8 packets, we multiply 5 by 8 to get the total number of chocolate bars. 

5 chocolate bars/packet * 8 packets = 40 chocolate bars

Next, we find out how many chocolate bars the adults get in total. 

Since each adult gets 6 chocolate bars and there are 4 adults, we multiply 6 by 4 to get the total number of chocolate bars the adults get. 

6 chocolate bars/adult * 4 adults = 24 chocolate bars

We then subtract the total number of chocolate bars the adults get from the total number of chocolate bars to find out how many chocolate bars are left for the children. 

40 chocolate bars - 24 chocolate bars = 16 chocolate bars

Finally, we divide the number of chocolate bars left by the number of children to find out how many chocolate bars each child gets. 

16 chocolate bars / 8 children = 2 chocolate bars/child

So, each child will get 2 chocolate bars.
