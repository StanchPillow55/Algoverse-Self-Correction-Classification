==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the value of the boat after each year of depreciation.

Depreciation is calculated by reducing the value of the item by the given percentage. 

First year:
The boat depreciated by 30% in the first year. To find the value of the boat after the first year, we calculate 30% of $9000 and subtract it from the original price.

30% of $9000 = 0.30 * $9000 = $2700

So, the value of the boat after the first year is $9000 - $2700 = $6300

Second year:
In the second year, the boat depreciated by another 30%. However, this time we calculate 30% of the value of the boat after the first year, which is $6300.

30% of $6300 = 0.30 * $6300 = $1890

So, the value of the boat after the second year is $6300 - $1890 = $4410

Third year:
In the third year, the boat depreciated by 20%. We calculate 20% of the value of the boat after the second year, which is $4410.

20% of $4410 = 0.20 * $4410 = $882

So, the value of the boat after the third year is $4410 - $882 = $3528

Therefore, after three years of depreciation, the boat is worth $3528.
