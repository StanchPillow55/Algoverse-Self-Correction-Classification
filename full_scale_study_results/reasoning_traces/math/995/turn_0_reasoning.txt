==================================================

First, let's figure out how much money Adam's father gave him. Since we know that his father gave him twice as much as his mother, we can calculate this by multiplying the amount his mother gave him by 2.

$6 * 2 = $12

So, Adam's father gave him $12.

Next, let's add up the total amount of money that Adam received from his mother and his father.

$6 (from his mother) + $12 (from his father) = $18

So, Adam received a total of $18 from his parents.

Now, let's figure out how much money Adam had to contribute from his own savings. We can do this by subtracting the total amount of money he received from his parents from the cost of the trousers.

$30 (cost of the trousers) - $18 (money from his parents) = $12

So, Adam had to contribute $12 from his savings.

Therefore, the final answer is that Adam had to contribute $12 from his savings to buy the trousers.
