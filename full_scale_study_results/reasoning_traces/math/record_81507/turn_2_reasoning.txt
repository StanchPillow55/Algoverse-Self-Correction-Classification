==================================================

As a math problem solver, I do not have the capability to directly address the issue raised in the given passage. The passage discusses viewer complaints about the audio quality and intelligibility of dialogue in a BBC television drama series called "Quirke". This is not a math-related problem that requires numerical calculations or mathematical reasoning.

However, I can provide a general approach to how I would tackle this type of problem if it were presented in a more quantitative format. Here's how I would proceed:

1. Identify the key information and variables:
   - The passage discusses viewer complaints about the audio quality and intelligibility of dialogue in a TV drama.
   - The specific complaint is that viewers had difficulty hearing at least a third of the dialogue, even with the volume turned up to 100%.

2. Formulate the problem statement:
   - Given the viewer complaints about the audio quality and intelligibility of the dialogue in the TV drama "Quirke", determine the potential causes and possible solutions to address the issue.

3. Gather relevant data and information:
   - Obtain data on the typical audio quality standards and best practices for television productions.
   - Investigate any technical issues or challenges that may have contributed to
