Question ID: 105
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to find out how many cookies Cody eats. Since Cody eats three times as many cookies as Amir, we multiply Amir's number of cookies by 3. 

Amir's cookies: 5
Cody's cookies: 5 * 3 = 15

Next, to find out how many cookies they both eat together, we add the number of cookies Amir eats to the number of cookies Cody eats.

Total cookies: Amir's cookies + Cody's cookies = 5 + 15 = 20

So, together, Cody and Amir eat 20 cookies.
