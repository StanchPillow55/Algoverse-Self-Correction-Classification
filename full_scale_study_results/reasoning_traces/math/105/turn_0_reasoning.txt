Dataset Type: math
==================================================

The problem tells us that Cody eats three times as many cookies as Amir. So, if Amir eats 5 cookies, Cody will eat 3 * 5 = <<3*5=15>>15 cookies.

To find out how many cookies they eat together, we simply add the number of cookies Amir eats to the number of cookies Cody eats. 

So, 5 (Amir's cookies) + 15 (Cody's cookies) = 20 cookies.

Therefore, together, Cody and Amir eat 20 cookies.
