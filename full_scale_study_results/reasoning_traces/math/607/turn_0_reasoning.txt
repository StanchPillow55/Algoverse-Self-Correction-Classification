Question ID: 607
Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, let's find out how many pumps are in the jumbo bottle of shampoo. According to the directions, 2 pumps are used per wash and the bottle provides 120 washings. Therefore, the total number of pumps in the bottle is 2 pumps/wash * 120 washes = 240 pumps.

Next, we need to find out how much each pump costs. The total cost of the bottle is $24.00. To find the cost per pump, we divide the total cost by the total number of pumps. So, $24.00/240 pumps = $0.10/pump.

However, the question asks for the cost per pump in cents, not dollars. To convert from dollars to cents, we multiply by 100 (since there are 100 cents in a dollar). So, $0.10 * 100 = 10 cents.

Therefore, each pump of shampoo costs 10 cents.
