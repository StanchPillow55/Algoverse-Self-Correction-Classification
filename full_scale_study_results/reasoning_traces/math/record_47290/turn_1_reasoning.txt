To solve the problem, we need to analyze the information provided in the passage regarding travel trends, specifically focusing on Malaysia as a holiday destination.

1. **Understanding the Context**: The passage discusses the impact of two Malaysia Airlines disasters in 2014 on the number of British tourists traveling to Malaysia. It indicates that Malaysia's ranking as a holiday destination has dropped from ninth to sixteenth place.

2. **Key Data Points**:
   - Last year, Malaysia was the 9th best-selling destination.
   - This year, Malaysia has dropped to the 16th position.
   - The decline in travel to Malaysia is attributed to the disasters involving Malaysia Airlines (MH370 and MH17).

3. **Travel Trends**: The passage implies that travel trends can change significantly due to external events, such as disasters. The drop in Malaysia's ranking suggests a decrease in popularity among British tourists.

4. **Other Destinations**: The passage also mentions that the Maldives remains the top destination, followed by Thailand, the United Arab Emirates, and Sri Lanka. This indicates that while Malaysia's popularity has decreased, other destinations are thriving.

5. **Final Analysis**: The query mentions a 50th year of operation in a market, which suggests a long-term observation of travel trends. The significant drop in Malaysia's ranking could be used to illustrate how external factors can influence travel preferences over time.

In conclusion, the final answer to the query about travel trends over decades, particularly in the context of Malaysia's decline in popularity, is that significant events can drastically alter tourist behavior and preferences, as evidenced by the drop in Malaysia's ranking from 9th to 16th place due to the airline disasters.
