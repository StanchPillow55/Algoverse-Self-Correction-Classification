Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

Unfortunately, the passage does not provide enough information to determine the "50th year of operating in the @placeholder market". The passage discusses the impact of the Malaysia Airlines disasters on the number of British travelers visiting Malaysia, but does not mention any specific company or its operating history in a particular market. Without more context about the company and market being referred to, I cannot provide a meaningful final answer. Please provide additional details about the specific problem you would like me to solve.
