To analyze the impact of the two Malaysia Airlines disasters on travel trends, we can break down the information provided in the passage step by step.

1. **Understanding the Context**: The passage discusses how the two disasters involving Malaysia Airlines in 2014 (MH370 and MH17) have significantly affected the number of British tourists traveling to Malaysia.

2. **Travel Rankings**: 
   - Last year, Malaysia was ranked 9th as a holiday destination for Britons.
   - This year, it has dropped to 16th place.

3. **Impact of Disasters**: The passage attributes this decline in travel to Malaysia to the two plane disasters. The disappearance of MH370 and the shooting down of MH17 have likely caused a loss of confidence among travelers.

4. **Comparison with Other Destinations**: The passage mentions that the Maldives remains the top destination, followed by Thailand, the United Arab Emirates, and Sri Lanka. This indicates that while Malaysia's ranking has fallen, other destinations are still performing well.

5. **Conclusion**: The significant drop from 9th to 16th place in the rankings suggests that the disasters have had a profound impact on travel trends, leading to a decrease in the number of Britons choosing Malaysia as a holiday destination.

Final Answer: The two Malaysia Airlines disasters have caused a significant decline in British tourists visiting Malaysia, dropping its ranking from 9th to 16th place among holiday destinations.
