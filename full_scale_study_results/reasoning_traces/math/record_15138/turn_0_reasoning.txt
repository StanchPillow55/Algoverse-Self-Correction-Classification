==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to find the location where the Libyan raid took place.

Given information:
- The wanted man was parking his car outside his family's home in a gated community.
- The raid took place after the wanted man had finished his morning prayers.
- Three cars filled with armed commandos encircled the wanted man.

Based on the information provided in the passage and the query, the location of the Libyan raid was Tripoli, Libya.

The passage states that "the Tripoli, Libya raid took advantage of the natural barriers provided by cornering the target in his gated community while parking a car." This directly matches the details provided in the query.

Therefore, the answer to the question "The wanted man was parking his car outside his family's home in a gated community in @placeholder after morning prayers when three cars filled with armed commandos encircled him, said his sister-in-law" is Tripoli, Libya.
