Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, let's find out how many hours John runs in total each week.

We know that he runs 3 hours the first day and half as much the other two days. Half of 3 hours is 1.5 hours. So, he runs 1.5 hours each of the other two days.

So, the total hours he runs each week is 3 hours (first day) + 1.5 hours (second day) + 1.5 hours (third day) = 6 hours.

Now, we know that John runs 60 miles in 6 hours. To find out how fast he runs, we divide the total distance he runs by the total time he runs.

So, his speed is 60 miles / 6 hours = 10 miles per hour.

Therefore, John runs at a speed of 10 miles per hour.
