==================================================

First, let's calculate how many holes the dog digs while Nate is on vacation. The dog can dig 6 holes a day and he digs for 14 days. So, the total number of holes dug by the dog is 6 holes/day * 14 days = 84 holes.

When Nate gets home, he starts filling in 9 holes a day, but the dog keeps digging 6 new holes every night. So, each day, the net number of holes that Nate fills is 9 holes/day - 6 holes/day = 3 holes/day.

Now, let's calculate how many days it takes Nate to fill in all the holes. The total number of holes is 84 and Nate fills 3 holes a day. So, the total number of days it takes Nate to fill in all the holes is 84 holes / 3 holes/day = 28 days.

Since there are 7 days in a week, the number of weeks it takes Nate to fill in all the holes is 28 days / 7 days/week = 4 weeks.

So, it takes Nate 4 weeks to fill in all the holes.
