Question ID: 68
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we first need to find out the total number of students in the school. We know that there are twice as many boys as girls, and there are 60 girls. Therefore, the number of boys is 2 * 60 = 120 boys.

Adding the number of boys and girls together, we get the total number of students in the school: 120 boys + 60 girls = 180 students.

Next, we know that there are 5 students for every teacher. To find the number of teachers, we divide the total number of students by the number of students per teacher: 180 students / 5 students/teacher = 36 teachers.

Therefore, there are 36 teachers at Dr. Wertz's school.
