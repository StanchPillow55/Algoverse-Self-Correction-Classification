Let's denote the number of cookies Henry baked last year as x. 

According to the problem, Henry wanted to bake twice as many cookies as he did last year, which would be 2x. 

However, he accidentally baked 15 more cookies than he intended to, so the total number of cookies he baked this year before dropping any would be 2x + 15. 

But then he dropped 5 cookies, so the total number of cookies he has now is (2x + 15) - 5 = 110. 

We can simplify the left side of the equation to get 2x + 10 = 110. 

Subtracting 10 from both sides of the equation gives us 2x = 100. 

Finally, dividing both sides of the equation by 2 gives us x = 50. 

So, Henry baked 50 cookies last year.
