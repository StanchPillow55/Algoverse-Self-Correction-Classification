Question ID: 117
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to find out how many pairs of shoes John bought in total. Since he bought 2 pairs for each of his 3 children, we multiply 2 by 3. 

2 pairs/child * 3 children = 6 pairs of shoes

Next, we need to find out how much all these shoes cost. Since each pair of shoes costs $60, we multiply the total number of pairs (6) by the cost per pair ($60).

6 pairs * $60/pair = $360

So, John paid $360 for the shoes. 

This is our final answer.
