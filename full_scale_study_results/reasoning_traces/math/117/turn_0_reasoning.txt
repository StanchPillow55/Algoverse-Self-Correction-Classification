Question ID: 117
Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to find out how many pairs of shoes John bought in total. He bought 2 pairs for each of his 3 children, so he bought 2 * 3 = <<2*3=6>>6 pairs of shoes.

Each pair of shoes costs $60, so to find out how much he paid in total, we need to multiply the total number of pairs by the cost of each pair. 

So, 6 pairs * $60 per pair = $<<6*60=360>>360.

Therefore, John paid $360 for the shoes.
