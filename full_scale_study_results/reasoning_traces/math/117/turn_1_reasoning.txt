Question ID: 117
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to calculate the total number of shoes John bought. Since he bought 2 pairs of shoes for each of his 3 children, we multiply 2 pairs/child * 3 children = 6 pairs of shoes.

Next, we need to calculate the total cost of the shoes. Since each pair of shoes costs $60, we multiply the number of pairs of shoes by the cost per pair. 

So, 6 pairs * $60/pair = $360.

Therefore, John paid $360 for the shoes.
