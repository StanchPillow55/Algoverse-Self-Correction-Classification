Question ID: 1244
Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, let's find out how many questions Audrey needs to answer correctly in total to pass 6th grade. 

The total number of questions on both tests is 70 + 40 = 110 questions.

She needs to answer 70% of these correctly to pass, so she needs to answer 0.70 * 110 = 77 questions correctly.

On the first test, Audrey answered 60% of the 70 questions correctly, which is 0.60 * 70 = 42 questions.

So, to find out how many questions Audrey needs to answer correctly on the second test, we subtract the number of questions she answered correctly on the first test from the total number she needs to answer correctly.

This gives us 77 - 42 = 35 questions.

Therefore, Audrey needs to answer 35 questions correctly on the second test to move onto the 7th grade.
