Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine how many liters of water Baldur collects in a day, given the number of pails he collects in the morning and afternoon, and the capacity of each pail.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Determine the number of pails collected in a day:**
   - Baldur collects 5 pails of water every morning.
   - Baldur collects 6 pails of water every afternoon.

   To find the total number of pails collected in a day, we add the number of pails collected in the morning and the afternoon:

   \[
   \text{Total pails per day} = 5 \text{ pails (morning)} + 6 \text{ pails (afternoon)} = 11 \text{ pails}
   \]

2. **Determine the volume of water in each pail:**
   - Each pail contains 5 liters of water.

3. **Calculate the total volume of water collected in a day:**
   - Since each pail contains 5 liters, and Baldur collects 11 pails in total, we multiply the number of pails by the volume of each pail to find the total volume of water:

   \[
   \text{Total liters per day} = 11 \text{ pails} \times 5 \text{ liters per pail} = 55 \text{ liters}
   \]

Therefore, Baldur collects a total of 55 liters of water every day.

**Final Answer: 55 liters**
