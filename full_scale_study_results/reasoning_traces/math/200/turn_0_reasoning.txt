Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to find out how many pails of water Baldur gets in a day. He gets 5 pails in the morning and 6 pails in the afternoon. 

So, the total number of pails he gets in a day is 5 (from the morning) + 6 (from the afternoon) = 11 pails.

Next, we need to convert the number of pails to liters. We know that each pail contains 5 liters of water. 

So, the total amount of water he gets in a day is 11 pails * 5 liters/pail = 55 liters.

Therefore, Baldur gets 55 liters of water every day.
