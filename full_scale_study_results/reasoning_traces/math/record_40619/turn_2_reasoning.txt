Question ID: record_40619
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, I need to determine the name of the pit bull described in the passage.

The passage states that "Lucas, once one of Michael Vick's best fighting dogs has been euthanized after accumulating health problems." It also mentions that "Nearly two dozen of the Vick dogs were rehabilitated at Best Friends in Kanab, Utah. Lucas was one of two not allowed to be adopted because of his history as a fighter."

Therefore, the name of the pit bull described in the query is Lucas.

The passage does not provide any information about Lucas being described as "a blessing to be around" by staff at the sanctuary where he lived. This detail is not mentioned in the given text.

In conclusion, the answer to the query is:
Lucas
