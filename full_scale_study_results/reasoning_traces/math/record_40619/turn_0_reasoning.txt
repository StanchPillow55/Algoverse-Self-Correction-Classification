==================================================

To solve this problem, I need to carefully read the passage and extract the relevant information to answer the query.

Given information:
- The passage is about a pit bull named Lucas who was rehabilitated after being used as a top fighter in the dog-fighting ring bankrolled by quarterback Michael Vick.
- Lucas was one of nearly two dozen of the Vick dogs that were rehabilitated at Best Friends Animal Society in Kanab, Utah.
- Lucas was one of two dogs that were not allowed to be adopted because of his history as a fighter.
- Lucas was euthanized on Wednesday due to accumulating health problems.

The query asks who was described as "a blessing to be around" by the staff at the sanctuary where he lived.

Based on the information provided in the passage, the answer is Lucas. The passage states that Lucas was one of the Vick dogs that was rehabilitated at Best Friends Animal Society, and he was not allowed to be adopted due to his history as a fighter. This suggests that Lucas lived at the Best Friends Animal Society sanctuary, and the staff there described him as "a blessing to be around".

Therefore, the answer to the query is Lucas.
