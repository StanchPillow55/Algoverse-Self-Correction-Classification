Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to calculate the total cost of the items that we know the price of. 

The cost of the chips is 2 bags * $2.00/bag = $4.00
The cost of the fried chicken is $8.00
The cost of the soda is $1.00

We add these costs together to find the total cost of these items:

$4.00 (chips) + $8.00 (chicken) + $1.00 (soda) = $13.00

We know that Gus spent $20.00 in total. To find the cost of the apple pie, we subtract the cost of the known items from the total cost:

$20.00 (total) - $13.00 (known items) = $7.00

So, the apple pie cost $7.00.
