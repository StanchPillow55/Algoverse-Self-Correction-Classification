Question ID: 635
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to find out how much each class costs if Manny attends all of them. To do this, we divide the total cost by the total number of classes. 

$60 รท 10 = $6 per class

This means that if Manny attends all of his classes, each one costs $6. 

His parents have said that they won't sign him up again if his classes end up costing more than $10 each. 

So, we need to find out how many classes Manny can miss before the cost per class exceeds $10. 

To do this, we divide the total cost by $10 to find out how many classes Manny needs to attend to keep the cost per class at $10 or less. 

$60 รท $10 = 6 classes

This means that Manny needs to attend at least 6 classes to keep the cost per class at $10 or less. 

Therefore, the number of classes Manny can miss is the total number of classes minus the number he needs to attend. 

10 - 6 = 4 classes

So, Manny can miss up to 4 classes before they don't sign him up again. 

Final Answer: Manny can miss 4 classes.
