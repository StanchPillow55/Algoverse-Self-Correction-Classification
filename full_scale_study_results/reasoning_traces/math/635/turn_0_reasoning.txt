Question ID: 635
Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

The total cost for the karate classes is $60. Manny's parents have set a limit of $10 per class. 

To find out how many classes Manny can miss before the cost per class exceeds $10, we need to divide the total cost by the cost per class. 

So, $60 รท $10 = 6 classes

This means that Manny can attend 6 classes before the cost per class exceeds $10. 

Since there are 10 total classes, Manny can miss 10 - 6 = 4 classes. 

Therefore, Manny can miss 4 classes before his parents won't sign him up again.
