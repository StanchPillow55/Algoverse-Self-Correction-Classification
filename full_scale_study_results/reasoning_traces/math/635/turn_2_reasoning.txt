Question ID: 635
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to find out how much each class costs if Manny attends all of them. We do this by dividing the total cost of the classes by the total number of classes. 

So, $60 รท 10 classes = $6 per class

This means that if Manny attends all of his classes, each class will cost $6. 

His parents have said that if his classes end up costing more than $10 per class, they won't sign him up again. This means that the total cost of the classes ($60) divided by the number of classes he attends needs to be more than $10.

So, we can set up the equation $60 รท x > $10, where x is the number of classes Manny attends.

Solving for x gives us x < 60 รท 10, or x < 6.

This means that Manny needs to attend less than 6 classes for the cost per class to exceed $10. 

Therefore, Manny can miss more than 4 classes (since he needs to attend less than 6) before the cost per class exceeds $10 and his parents won't sign him up again. 

So, the final answer is that Manny can miss 4 classes. If he misses more than 4 classes, the cost per class will exceed $10.
