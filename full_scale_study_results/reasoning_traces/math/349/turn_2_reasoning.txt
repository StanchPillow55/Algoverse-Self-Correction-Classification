Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total annual cost of food, treats, and medicine for Madeline's dog. We will break down the costs by category and then sum them up to find the total yearly expense.

### Step 1: Calculate the Monthly Cost of Food

Madeline spends $25 per week on food. Since there are 4 weeks in a month, the monthly cost of food is calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Monthly Food Cost} = 25 \, \text{dollars/week} \times 4 \, \text{weeks/month} = 100 \, \text{dollars/month}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the Monthly Cost of Treats

The cost of treats is given as $20 per month. Therefore, the monthly cost of treats is:

\[
\text{Monthly Treats Cost} = 20 \, \text{dollars/month}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the Monthly Cost of Medicine

The cost of medicine is given as $100 per month. Therefore, the monthly cost of medicine is:

\[
\text{Monthly Medicine Cost} = 100 \, \text{dollars/month}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the Total Monthly Cost

Now, we sum up the monthly costs for food, treats, and medicine to find the total monthly cost:

\[
\text{Total Monthly Cost} = \text{Monthly Food Cost} + \text{Monthly Treats Cost} + \text{Monthly Medicine Cost}
\]

\[
\text{Total Monthly Cost} = 100 \, \text{dollars} + 20 \, \text{dollars} + 100 \, \text{dollars} = 220 \, \text{dollars/month}
\]

### Step 5: Calculate the Total Annual Cost

Finally, to find the total annual cost, we multiply the total monthly cost by the number of months in a year (12 months):

\[
\text{Total Annual Cost} = \text{Total Monthly Cost} \times 12 \, \text{months/year}
\]

\[
\text{Total Annual Cost} = 220 \, \text{dollars/month} \times 12 \, \text{months/year} = 2640 \, \text{dollars/year}
\]

### Final Answer

Madeline spends a total of $2,640 per year on her dog's food, treats, and medicine.
