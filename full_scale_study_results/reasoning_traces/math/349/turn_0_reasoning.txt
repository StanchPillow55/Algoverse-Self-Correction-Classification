==================================================

First, we need to calculate the monthly cost for each item.

For the food, since it costs $25 per week and there are 4 weeks in a month, we multiply $25 by 4 to get $100 per month.

The treats cost is already given as $20 per month.

The medicine cost is also given as $100 per month.

Next, we add up these monthly costs to find the total monthly cost. So, $100 (for food) + $20 (for treats) + $100 (for medicine) equals $220 per month.

Finally, to find the yearly cost, we multiply the total monthly cost by the number of months in a year, which is 12. So, $220 per month times 12 months equals $2640.

Therefore, Madeline spends $2640 on her dog per year.
