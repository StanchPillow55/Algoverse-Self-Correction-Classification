Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To determine how much money Madeline spends on her dog per year, we need to calculate the monthly expenses for food, treats, and medicine, and then multiply by the number of months in a year.

### Step 1: Calculate Monthly Expenses

1. **Food Costs:**
   - Food costs $25 per week.
   - There are 4 weeks in a month.
   - Monthly food cost = $25/week * 4 weeks/month = $100/month.

2. **Treats Costs:**
   - Treats cost $20 per month.
   - Monthly treats cost = $20/month.

3. **Medicine Costs:**
   - Medicine costs $100 per month.
   - Monthly medicine cost = $100/month.

### Step 2: Calculate Total Monthly Expenses

Add up the monthly costs for food, treats, and medicine:

- Total monthly expenses = Monthly food cost + Monthly treats cost + Monthly medicine cost
- Total monthly expenses = $100 + $20 + $100 = $220

### Step 3: Calculate Annual Expenses

Since there are 12 months in a year, multiply the total monthly expenses by 12 to find the annual expenses:

- Annual expenses = Total monthly expenses * 12 months/year
- Annual expenses = $220/month * 12 months/year = $2,640/year

### Final Answer

Madeline spends $2,640 per year on her dog.
