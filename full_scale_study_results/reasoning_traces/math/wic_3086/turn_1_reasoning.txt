==================================================

To determine if the word 'line' is used with the same meaning in both sentences, we need to analyze the context and meaning of the word in each sentence.

Sentence 1: "There is a narrow line between sanity and insanity."
In this sentence, the word 'line' is used metaphorically to represent the boundary or distinction between sanity and insanity. It is not referring to a physical line, but rather a conceptual or figurative line.

Sentence 2: "He got out of line."
In this sentence, the word 'line' is used idiomatically to mean that someone has behaved in an inappropriate or unacceptable manner, deviating from the expected or acceptable behavior.

Based on the analysis, the word 'line' is not used with the same meaning in both sentences. In the first sentence, it is used metaphorically to represent a conceptual boundary, while in the second sentence, it is used idiomatically to describe a deviation from acceptable behavior.

Therefore, the answer is: No, the word 'line' is not used with the same meaning in both sentences.
