Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to find half of the time Steve took to complete the puzzle. Steve took 10 hours, so half of this time is 10/2 = 5 hours.

The problem states that Anna took 2 hours more than half of Steve's time. So, we add these 2 hours to the 5 hours we calculated earlier. 

So, Anna took 5 + 2 = 7 hours to complete the puzzle.

Therefore, it took Anna 7 hours to finish the difficult puzzle.
