Question ID: record_63465
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to find the percentage of tickets sold for the opening fixture of the England team in the European Championship compared to the total number of tickets available.

Given information:
- The England football team has 9,000 tickets available for their opening fixture in the European Championship.
- Only 2,000 tickets have been sold for this fixture.

Step 1: Calculate the percentage of tickets sold.
Percentage of tickets sold = (Number of tickets sold / Total number of tickets available) × 100
Percentage of tickets sold = (2,000 / 9,000) × 100
Percentage of tickets sold = 0.2222 × 100
Percentage of tickets sold = 22.22%

Step 2: Determine if this is the lowest turnout ever for the European Championship.

Since the passage does not provide any specific information about the lowest turnout ever for the European Championship, we cannot
