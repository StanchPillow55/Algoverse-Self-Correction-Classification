Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To determine if the premise entails the hypothesis, we need to analyze the information provided and evaluate the logical relationship between the premise and the hypothesis.

Given information:
- Premise: November 9, 1989, the day the Berlin Wall fell and the world changed forever.
- Hypothesis: The Berlin Wall was torn down in 1989.

Reasoning:
1. The premise directly states that the Berlin Wall fell on November 9, 1989.
2. The hypothesis states that the Berlin Wall was torn down in 1989.
3. Since the premise explicitly mentions the date when the Berlin Wall fell, and the hypothesis states that the Berlin Wall was torn down in 1989, the premise entails the hypothesis.

Therefore, the premise entails the hypothesis.

Final answer: Yes, the premise entails the hypothesis.
