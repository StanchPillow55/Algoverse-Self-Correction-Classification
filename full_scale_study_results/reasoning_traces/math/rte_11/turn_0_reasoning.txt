==================================================

To determine if the premise entails the hypothesis, we need to analyze the information provided and logically evaluate the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis.

Given information:
- Premise: November 9, 1989, the day the Berlin Wall fell, and the world changed forever.
- Hypothesis: The Berlin Wall was torn down in 1989.

Reasoning:
1. The premise directly states that the Berlin Wall fell on November 9, 1989.
2. The hypothesis states that the Berlin Wall was torn down in 1989.
3. Since the premise specifically mentions the date of November 9, 1989 as the day the Berlin Wall fell, this directly supports the hypothesis that the Berlin Wall was torn down in 1989.

Therefore, the premise entails the hypothesis.

Final Answer:
The premise entails the hypothesis. The premise directly states the date of November 9, 1989 as the day the Berlin Wall fell, which supports the hypothesis that the Berlin Wall was torn down in 1989.
