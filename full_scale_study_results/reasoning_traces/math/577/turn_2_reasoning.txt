Question ID: 577
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To find the average number of birds Mack saw in a day, we need to add up all the birds he saw over the week and then divide by the number of days in the week.

From the problem, we know that:

- On days one and two, Mack saw a total of 50 birds.
- On day three he saw none.
- On days four and five, he saw 120 birds.
- On day six he saw 20 birds.
- On day seven he saw 90 birds.

Adding these all up, we get:

50 (from days one and two) + 0 (from day three) + 120 (from days four and five) + 20 (from day six) + 90 (from day seven) = 280 birds in total.

There are 7 days in a week, so to find the average number of birds Mack saw in a day, we divide the total number of birds by the number of days:

280 birds รท 7 days = 40 birds/day.

So, on average, Mack saw 40 birds per day.
