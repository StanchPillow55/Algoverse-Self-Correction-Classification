==================================================

To find the average number of birds Mack saw in a day, we need to add up all the birds he saw and then divide by the number of days.

On days one and two, Mack saw a total of 50 birds.
On day three, he saw none, so we add 0.
On days four and five, he saw 120 birds.
On day six, he saw 20 birds.
On day seven, he saw 90 birds.

So, the total number of birds Mack saw is 50 (from days one and two) + 0 (from day three) + 120 (from days four and five) + 20 (from day six) + 90 (from day seven) = 280 birds.

The total number of days is 7 (one week).

To find the average, we divide the total number of birds by the total number of days:

280 birds รท 7 days = 40 birds/day.

So, on average, Mack saw 40 birds per day.
