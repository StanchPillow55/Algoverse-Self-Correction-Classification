==================================================

To find the average number of birds Mack saw in a day, we need to add up all the birds he saw over the week and then divide by the number of days in the week.

From the problem, we know that:

- On days one and two, Mack saw a total of 50 birds.
- On day three he saw none.
- On days four and five, he saw 120 birds.
- On day six he saw 20 birds.
- On day seven he saw 90 birds.

So, the total number of birds Mack saw over the week is 50 (from days one and two) + 0 (from day three) + 120 (from days four and five) + 20 (from day six) + 90 (from day seven).

This gives us a total of 50 + 0 + 120 + 20 + 90 = 280 birds.

Since there are 7 days in a week, we then divide the total number of birds by 7 to find the average number of birds Mack saw in a day.

So, 280 birds รท 7 days = 40 birds/day.

Therefore, on average, Mack saw 40 birds in a day.
