==================================================

Let's solve this problem step by step.

First, we know that Steve is 60 years old. 

Second, we know that Steve's wife is 4 years older than him. So, Steve's wife is 60 + 4 = 64 years old.

Third, we know that their son is currently half as old as his mom. So, their son is 64 / 2 = 32 years old.

Finally, we know that their son's wife is 3 years younger than her husband. So, Steve's son's wife is 32 - 3 = 29 years old.

So, Steve's son's wife is 29 years old.
