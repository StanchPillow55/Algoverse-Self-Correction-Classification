==================================================

First, let's calculate the total number of clients Kim will have. He already has 3 clients and is talking to another 5 potential clients. So, the total number of clients will be 3 + 5 = 8 clients.

Each clientâ€™s home will need 2 bottles of bleach and a pack of cloths to clean. Bottles of bleach will cost $2 each and packs of cloths will cost $5 each. 

So, the total cost of bleach for each client will be 2 bottles * $2/bottle = $4.
The total cost of cloths for each client will be 1 pack * $5/pack = $5.

Therefore, the total expenses for each client will be $4 (for bleach) + $5 (for cloths) = $9.

Since Kim has 8 clients, his total expenses will be 8 clients * $9/client = $72.

Kim's total income each week is $92. 

Profit is the difference between total income and total expenses. So, Kim's profit will be $92 (income) - $72 (expenses) = $20.

So, Kim will make a profit of $20 each week.
