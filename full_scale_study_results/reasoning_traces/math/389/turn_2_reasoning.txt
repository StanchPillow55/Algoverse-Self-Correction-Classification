==================================================

To determine how much money David saves by buying a ride bracelet instead of Dasha buying individual ride tickets, we need to calculate the total cost for both David and Dasha.

1. **Cost of the ride bracelet (David's cost)**:
   - The ride bracelet costs $30 and allows unlimited rides (up to 9 rides).
   - Therefore, David's total cost is:
     \[
     \text{Cost for David} = 30 \text{ dollars}
     \]

2. **Cost of individual ride tickets (Dasha's cost)**:
   - Each ride costs 2 ride tickets.
   - Each ticket costs $2.
   - Therefore, the cost for one ride in terms of tickets is:
     \[
     \text{Cost per ride} = 2 \text{ tickets} \times 2 \text{ dollars/ticket} = 4 \text{ dollars}
     \]
   - Since there are 9 rides, the total cost for Dasha is:
     \[
     \text{Total cost for Dasha} = 9 \text{ rides} \times 4 \text{ dollars/ride} = 36 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Calculating the savings**:
   - To find out how much David saves, we subtract David's cost from Dasha's cost:
     \[
     \text{Savings} = \text{Cost for Dasha} - \text{Cost for David}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Savings} = 36 \text{ dollars} - 30 \text{ dollars} = 6 \text{ dollars}
     \]

Thus, David saves **$6** by purchasing the ride bracelet instead of buying individual tickets for all the rides. 

Final answer: **$6**.
