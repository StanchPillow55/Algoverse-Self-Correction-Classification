Question ID: 389
Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, let's calculate how much Dasha spends on tickets. Each ride costs 2 tickets, and each ticket costs $2. So, each ride costs 2 * $2 = $4. 

Since there are 9 rides, Dasha spends 9 * $4 = $36 on tickets.

David, on the other hand, buys a ride bracelet for $30.

To find out how much David saves, we subtract the cost of the bracelet from the cost of the tickets: $36 - $30 = $6.

So, David saves $6 by buying a ride bracelet instead of tickets.
