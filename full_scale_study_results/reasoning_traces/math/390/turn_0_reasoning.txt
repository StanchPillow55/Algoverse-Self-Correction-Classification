Question ID: 390
Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

Monica has a total of 6 gifts for her family, 4 gifts for her friends, and 2 gifts for her teachers. This means she has a total of 6 + 4 + 2 = 12 gifts to wrap.

She has 144 inches of ribbon and she wants to use this ribbon to make a bow for each gift. This means she needs to divide the total length of the ribbon by the total number of gifts to find out how many inches of ribbon she can use for each gift bow.

So, 144 inches รท 12 gifts = 12 inches per gift.

Therefore, Monica can use 12 inches of ribbon for each gift bow.
