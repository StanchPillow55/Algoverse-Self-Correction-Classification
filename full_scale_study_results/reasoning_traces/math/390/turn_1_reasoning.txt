Question ID: 390
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to find out the total number of gifts Monica needs to wrap. She has 6 gifts for her family, 4 gifts for her friends, and 2 gifts for her teachers. 

So, the total number of gifts is 6 + 4 + 2 = 12 gifts.

Monica has 144 inches of ribbon and she wants to use it to make a bow for each gift. To find out how many inches of ribbon she can use for each gift bow, we need to divide the total length of the ribbon by the total number of gifts.

So, the length of ribbon for each gift bow is 144 inches รท 12 gifts = 12 inches.

Therefore, Monica can use 12 inches of ribbon for each gift bow.
