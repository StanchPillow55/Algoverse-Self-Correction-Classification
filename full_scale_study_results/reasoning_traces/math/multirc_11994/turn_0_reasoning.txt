==================================================

To find the full name of the member of the Muslim Brotherhood who was executed in 1966 on charges of attempting to overthrow the government, I will carefully read through the given paragraph and extract the relevant information.

The paragraph states:
"Bin Laden also relies heavily on the Egyptian writer Sayyid Qutb. A member of the Muslim Brotherhood executed in 1966 on charges of attempting to overthrow the government, Qutb mixed Islamic scholarship with a very superficial acquaintance with Western history and thought."

From this, we can see that the full name of the member of the Muslim Brotherhood who was executed in 1966 is Sayyid Qutb.

Therefore, the final answer is:
Sayyid Qutb
