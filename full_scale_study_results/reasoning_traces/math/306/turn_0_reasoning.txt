Dataset Type: math
==================================================

The bakery produces 60 loaves of bread each day. 

Step 1: Find out how many loaves are sold in the morning.
Two-thirds of the loaves are sold in the morning. So, we calculate 2/3 * 60 = 40 loaves. 

Step 2: Find out how many loaves are left after the morning sales.
We subtract the number of loaves sold in the morning from the total number of loaves. So, 60 - 40 = 20 loaves are left.

Step 3: Find out how many loaves are sold in the afternoon.
Half of what is left is sold equally in the afternoon and evening. So, we calculate 1/2 * 20 = 10 loaves. 

Therefore, 10 loaves of bread are sold in the afternoon.
