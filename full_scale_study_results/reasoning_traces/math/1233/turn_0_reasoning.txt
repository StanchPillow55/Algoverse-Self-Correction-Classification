==================================================

Walter initially had 60 apples.

He ate 2/5 of them, which is (2/5)*60 = 24 apples.

So, he was left with 60 - 24 = 36 apples.

He then gave his sister 25% of the remaining apples, which is (25/100)*36 = 9 apples.

So, he was left with 36 - 9 = 27 apples.

He sold these remaining apples to his uncle at $3 each, so he received 27*3 = $81.

Therefore, Walter received $81 from selling the remaining apples to his uncle.
