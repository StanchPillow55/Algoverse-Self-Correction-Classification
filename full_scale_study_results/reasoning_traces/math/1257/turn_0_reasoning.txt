Question ID: 1257
Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to determine how many boxes of popsicles Bob needs to buy. Since each box contains 8 popsicles, we divide the total number of popsicles he needs (56) by the number of popsicles per box (8).

56 รท 8 = 7 boxes

So, Bob needs to buy 7 boxes of popsicles.

Next, we need to calculate the total cost. Since each box costs $2.00, we multiply the number of boxes (7) by the cost per box ($2.00).

7 boxes * $2.00/box = $14.00

Therefore, it will cost Bob $14.00 to build his project.
