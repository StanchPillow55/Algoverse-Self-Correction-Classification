Question ID: boolq_5298
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To determine whether a walk counts as a plate appearance, we need to understand the definition of a plate appearance and how it differs from an at-bat.

According to the context provided:
- A plate appearance (PA) is a batter's turn batting against a pitcher, regardless of what happens during the turn.
- An at-bat (AB) is a batter's turn batting against a pitcher, but it does not include certain results, such as a walk.

The question specifically asks if a walk counts as a plate appearance.

To answer this, we can break down the definition of a plate appearance:
- A plate appearance is a batter's turn batting against a pitcher, regardless of the outcome.
- A walk is one of the possible outcomes during a batter's turn at the plate.

Therefore, a walk does count as a plate appearance.

The reasoning is as follows:
1. A plate appearance is defined as a batter's turn batting against a pitcher, regardless of the outcome.
2. A walk is one of the possible outcomes that can occur during a batter's plate appearance.
3. Therefore, a walk does count as a plate appearance.

Final answer:
Yes, a
