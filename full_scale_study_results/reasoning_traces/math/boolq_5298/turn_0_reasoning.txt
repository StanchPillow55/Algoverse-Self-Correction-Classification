Question ID: boolq_5298
Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To determine whether a walk counts as a plate appearance, we need to understand the definition of a plate appearance and how it differs from an at-bat.

Given information:
- A plate appearance (PA) is credited to a batter regardless of what happens during their turn at bat.
- An at-bat (AB) is credited to a batter only if the plate appearance does not result in one of the enumerated exceptions, such as a walk.
- A player can qualify for season-ending rankings in certain statistics (like batting average and slugging percentage) if they accumulate 502 plate appearances during the season.

Reasoning:
1. A walk is one of the exceptions that does not count as an at-bat (AB).
2. However, a walk does count as a plate appearance (PA).
3. This is because a plate appearance is credited to a batter regardless of the outcome of their turn at bat, while an at-bat is only credited if the plate appearance does not result in one of the enumerated exceptions.

Therefore, the final answer is:
Yes, a walk counts as a plate appearance (PA), but it does not count as an at-bat (AB).
