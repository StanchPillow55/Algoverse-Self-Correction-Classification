==================================================

To determine the percentage increase in daily revenue after the factory switched from making tractors to making silos, we need to calculate the daily revenue for both scenarios and then find the percentage increase.

**Step 1: Calculate the daily revenue from tractors.**

The factory sold 10 tractors a day, and each tractor was sold for $100. Therefore, the daily revenue from tractors was:

\[ \text{Daily Revenue from Tractors} = 10 \text{ tractors/day} \times \$100/\text{tractor} = \$1000/\text{day} \]

**Step 2: Calculate the daily revenue from silos.**

The factory now sells 5 silos a day, and each silo is sold for $220. Therefore, the daily revenue from silos is:

\[ \text{Daily Revenue from Silos} = 5 \text{ silos/day} \times \$220/\text{silo} = \$1100/\text{day} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the increase in daily revenue.**

The increase in daily revenue after switching from tractors to silos is the difference between the daily revenue from silos and the daily revenue from tractors:

\[ \text{Increase in Daily Revenue} = \$1100/\text{day} - \$1000/\text{day} = \$100/\text{day} \]

**Step 4: Calculate the percentage increase in daily revenue.**

To find the percentage increase, we divide the increase in daily revenue by the original daily revenue from tractors and then multiply by 100 to convert it to a percentage:

\[ \text{Percentage Increase} = \left( \frac{\$100/\text{day}}{\$1000/\text{day}} \right) \times 100\% = 10\% \]

**Final Answer:**

The factory is making 10% more per day now after switching from making tractors to making silos.
