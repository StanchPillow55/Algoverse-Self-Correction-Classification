==================================================

To determine the percentage increase in daily revenue after the factory switched from making tractors to making silos, we need to calculate the daily revenue for both scenarios and then find the percentage increase.

**Step 1: Calculate the daily revenue from selling tractors.**

The factory sold 10 tractors a day, and each tractor was sold for $100.

\[ \text{Daily revenue from tractors} = \text{Number of tractors per day} \times \text{Price per tractor} \]

\[ \text{Daily revenue from tractors} = 10 \times 100 = 1000 \text{ dollars} \]

**Step 2: Calculate the daily revenue from selling silos.**

The factory now sells 5 silos a day, and each silo is sold for $220.

\[ \text{Daily revenue from silos} = \text{Number of silos per day} \times \text{Price per silo} \]

\[ \text{Daily revenue from silos} = 5 \times 220 = 1100 \text{ dollars} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the increase in daily revenue.**

\[ \text{Increase in daily revenue} = \text{Daily revenue from silos} - \text{Daily revenue from tractors} \]

\[ \text{Increase in daily revenue} = 1100 - 1000 = 100 \text{ dollars} \]

**Step 4: Calculate the percentage increase in daily revenue.**

To find the percentage increase, divide the increase in revenue by the original revenue (from tractors) and multiply by 100.

\[ \text{Percentage increase} = \left( \frac{\text{Increase in daily revenue}}{\text{Daily revenue from tractors}} \right) \times 100 \]

\[ \text{Percentage increase} = \left( \frac{100}{1000} \right) \times 100 \]

\[ \text{Percentage increase} = 0.1 \times 100 = 10\% \]

**Final Answer:**

The factory is making 10% more per day now by selling silos compared to when it was selling tractors.
