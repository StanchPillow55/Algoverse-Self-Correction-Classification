==================================================

First, let's calculate how much the factory made per day when they were producing tractors. 

They sold 10 tractors a day and made $100 per tractor, so they made 10 tractors/day * $100/tractor = $1000/day.

Now, let's calculate how much they make per day producing silos. 

They sell 5 silos a day and make $220 per silo, so they make 5 silos/day * $220/silo = $1100/day.

To find out what percentage more they are making per day now, we need to calculate the difference between the two amounts, divide that by the original amount (when they were making tractors), and then multiply by 100 to get the percentage.

The difference between the two amounts is $1100/day - $1000/day = $100/day.

So, the percentage increase is ($100/day / $1000/day) * 100 = 10%.

Therefore, the factory is making 10% more per day now that they are producing silos instead of tractors.
