To determine the percentage increase in daily revenue from the factory's shift from making tractors to making silos, we will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the daily revenue from tractors.**
   - The factory sold 10 tractors a day.
   - Each tractor sold for $100.
   - Therefore, the daily revenue from tractors can be calculated as follows:
     \[
     \text{Daily Revenue from Tractors} = \text{Number of Tractors} \times \text{Price per Tractor}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Daily Revenue from Tractors} = 10 \times 100 = 1000 \text{ dollars}
     \]

2. **Calculate the daily revenue from silos.**
   - The factory now sells 5 silos a day.
   - Each silo sells for $220.
   - Therefore, the daily revenue from silos can be calculated as follows:
     \[
     \text{Daily Revenue from Silos} = \text{Number of Silos} \times \text{Price per Silo}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Daily Revenue from Silos} = 5 \times 220 = 1100 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Determine the increase in daily revenue.**
   - To find the increase in revenue, we subtract the daily revenue from tractors from the daily revenue from silos:
     \[
     \text{Increase in Revenue} = \text{Daily Revenue from Silos} - \text{Daily Revenue from Tractors}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Increase in Revenue} = 1100 - 1000 = 100 \text{ dollars}
     \]

4. **Calculate the percentage increase in daily revenue.**
   - The percentage increase can be calculated using the formula:
     \[
     \text{Percentage Increase} = \left( \frac{\text{Increase in Revenue}}{\text{Daily Revenue from Tractors}} \right) \times 100
     \]
     \[
     \text{Percentage Increase} = \left( \frac{100}{1000} \right) \times 100 = 10\%
     \]

5. **State the final answer.**
   - The factory is making **10% more** per day now by selling silos compared to when it was selling tractors.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{10\%}
\]
