==================================================

Let's break this problem down step by step.

First, we know that the first train arrives in 10 minutes and stays for 20 minutes. So, the first train leaves the station 10 + 20 = 30 minutes after Paul arrives at the station.

Second, the second train arrives half an hour after the first train leaves, so it arrives 30 + 30 = 60 minutes (or 1 hour) after Paul arrives at the station. This train stays for a quarter of the time the first train stayed, so it stays for 20/4 = 5 minutes. Therefore, the second train leaves the station 60 + 5 = 65 minutes after Paul arrives at the station.

Third, the third train arrives an hour after the second train leaves, so it arrives 65 + 60 = 125 minutes after Paul arrives at the station. This train leaves immediately after it arrives, so it leaves the station 125 minutes after Paul arrives at the station.

Finally, the fourth train, which is the one Paul needs to board, arrives 20 minutes after the third train leaves. So, it arrives 125 + 20 = 145 minutes after Paul arrives at the station.

Therefore, Paul will wait for 145 minutes for his train.
