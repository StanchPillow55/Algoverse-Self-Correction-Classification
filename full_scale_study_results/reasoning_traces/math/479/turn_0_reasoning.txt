==================================================

Let's break down the problem into smaller parts.

First, we need to calculate the cost of the plane tickets. Tom is buying two tickets, one for him and one for his wife. Each ticket costs $5000. So, the total cost of the plane tickets is 2 * $5000 = $10,000.

Next, we need to calculate the cost of the hotel. The hotel is 20% more expensive than its normal price of $1500 per day. To find out how much more expensive it is, we need to calculate 20% of $1500. 

20% of $1500 is (20/100) * $1500 = $300.

So, the hotel costs $1500 + $300 = $1800 per day.

They are staying at the hotel for 3 days. So, the total cost of the hotel is 3 * $1800 = $5400.

Finally, we add the cost of the plane tickets and the hotel to find the total cost of the trip. 

The total cost of the trip is $10,000 (plane tickets) + $5400 (hotel) = $15,400.

So, the trip cost Tom $15,400.
