Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, let's calculate the total cost of the plane tickets. Since the tickets cost $5000 each and there are two people (Tom and his wife), the total cost for the plane tickets is $5000 * 2 = $10000.

Next, we need to calculate the cost of the hotel. Since it's a busy weekend, the hotel is 20% more expensive than its normal price. To find out how much more expensive it is, we multiply the normal price by 20% (or 0.20). So, $1500 * 0.20 = $300. This means the hotel is $300 more expensive per day than usual.

So, the actual cost per day is the normal price plus the additional cost, which is $1500 + $300 = $1800 per day.

Since they are staying for 3 days, the total cost for the hotel is $1800 * 3 = $5400.

Finally, to find the total cost of the trip, we add the cost of the plane tickets and the cost of the hotel. So, $10000 (plane tickets) + $5400 (hotel) = $15400.

Therefore, the total cost of the trip is $15400.
