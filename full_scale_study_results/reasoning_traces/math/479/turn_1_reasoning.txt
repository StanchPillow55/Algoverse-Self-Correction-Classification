==================================================

Let's break down the problem into smaller parts and solve it step by step.

First, we need to calculate the cost of the plane tickets. Tom is buying tickets for himself and his wife, so there are two tickets in total. Each ticket costs $5000. Therefore, the total cost of the plane tickets is:

2 tickets * $5000 per ticket = $10,000

Next, we need to calculate the cost of the hotel. The hotel is 20% more expensive than normal because it is a busy weekend. Therefore, the price per day is:

$1500 per day * 20% = $300

So, the price per day during the busy weekend is:

$1500 per day + $300 = $1800 per day

They are staying at the hotel for 3 days, so the total cost of the hotel is:

3 days * $1800 per day = $5400

Finally, we add the cost of the plane tickets and the hotel to find the total cost of the trip:

$10,000 (plane tickets) + $5400 (hotel) = $15,400

Therefore, the total cost of the trip is $15,400.
