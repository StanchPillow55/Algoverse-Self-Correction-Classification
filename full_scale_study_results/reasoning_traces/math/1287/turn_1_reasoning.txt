Question ID: 1287
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, let's calculate the total age of the sisters. Since all three sisters are the same age, which is 16, we multiply the number of sisters by their age. 

3 sisters * 16 years/sister = 48 years

Next, we know that one of the brothers is 12 years old, which is half the age of the older brother. This means the older brother is twice as old as the younger brother.

1 older brother * 2 * 12 years/brother = 24 years

Adding the age of the younger brother:

24 years + 12 years = 36 years

Finally, we add the total age of the sisters and the brothers to find the total age of all the siblings.

48 years + 36 years = 84 years

So, the total age of all the siblings is 84 years.
