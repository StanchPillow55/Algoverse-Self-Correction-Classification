==================================================

First, let's find out the age of the older brother. We know that the younger brother is 12 years old and that this is half the age of the older brother. Therefore, to find the older brother's age, we multiply the younger brother's age by 2. 

12 years * 2 = 24 years

So, the older brother is 24 years old.

Next, let's calculate the total age of the sisters. We know that all three sisters are the same age, 16 years old. Therefore, to find the total age of the sisters, we multiply the age of one sister by the number of sisters.

16 years * 3 = 48 years

So, the total age of the sisters is 48 years.

Finally, let's add up the ages of all the siblings to find the total age. We add the age of the younger brother, the age of the older brother, and the total age of the sisters.

12 years (younger brother) + 24 years (older brother) + 48 years (sisters) = 84 years

Therefore, the total age of all the siblings is 84 years.
