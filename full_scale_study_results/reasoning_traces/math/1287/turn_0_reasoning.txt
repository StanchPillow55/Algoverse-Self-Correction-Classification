To find the total age of all the siblings in the family, we will break down the information given in the problem step by step.

1. **Identify the ages of the sisters**:
   - There are 3 sisters, and each sister is 16 years old.
   - Therefore, the total age of the sisters can be calculated as:
     \[
     \text{Total age of sisters} = 3 \times 16 = 48 \text{ years}
     \]

2. **Identify the ages of the brothers**:
   - We know one brother is 12 years old.
   - The problem states that this younger brother (12 years old) is half the age of the older brother. Letâ€™s denote the age of the older brother as \( x \).
   - According to the information given:
     \[
     12 = \frac{1}{2} x
     \]
   - To find \( x \), we can multiply both sides of the equation by 2:
     \[
     x = 12 \times 2 = 24 \text{ years}
     \]
   - So, the older brother is 24 years old.

3. **Calculate the total age of the brothers**:
   - Now we have the ages of both brothers: one is 12 years old and the other is 24 years old.
   - Therefore, the total age of the brothers can be calculated as:
     \[
     \text{Total age of brothers} = 12 + 24 = 36 \text{ years}
     \]

4. **Calculate the total age of all siblings**:
   - Now we can find the total age of all siblings by adding the total age of the sisters and the total age of the brothers:
     \[
     \text{Total age of all siblings} = \text{Total age of sisters} + \text{Total age of brothers}
     \]
     \[
     \text{Total age of all siblings} = 48 + 36 = 84 \text{ years}
     \]

5. **Final answer**:
   - The total age of all the siblings is:
     \[
     \boxed{84} \text{ years}
     \]
