Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given passage and the query, and then provide a well-reasoned response.

Given information:
- This week marks the centenary of the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand in Sarajevo, which was a key trigger for the First World War.
- Power is shifting from the global North to the South, with Asian countries, especially China, being the primary beneficiaries.
- The query suggests that, as 100 years ago, geopolitical tensions are mounting as "revisionist nations," including @placeholder and Russia, challenge key elements of the U.S.-led international order.

Reasoning:
1. The passage draws a parallel between the current geopolitical landscape and the early 20th century, suggesting that there are similarities in the shifting of global power dynamics.
2. The query specifically mentions that "revisionist nations," including @placeholder and Russia, are challenging the U.S.-led international order, similar to the tensions that led to the First World War.
3. However, the passage also notes that there are key differences between the world of 1914 and the current situation, which make a major power war unlikely.
4.
