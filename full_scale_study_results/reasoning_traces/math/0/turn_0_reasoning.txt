==================================================

Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day. 

She uses 3 for breakfast and 4 for baking muffins, which totals to 3 + 4 = <<3+4=7>>7 eggs.

So, the number of eggs she has left to sell at the farmers' market is 16 - 7 = <<16-7=9>>9 eggs.

Since she sells each egg for $2, the total amount she makes from selling the eggs at the farmers' market is 9 * $2 = $<<9*2=18>>18.

Therefore, Janet makes $18 every day at the farmers' market.
