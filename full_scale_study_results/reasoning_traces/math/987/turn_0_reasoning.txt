Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to calculate how much soil is used for the sunflowers and carnations.

For the sunflowers, we multiply the number of sunflowers by the amount of soil each one needs:
4 sunflowers * 3 pounds/flower = 12 pounds

For the carnations, we do the same:
10 carnations * 1.5 pounds/flower = 15 pounds

Next, we add these two amounts together to find out how much soil has been used so far:
12 pounds + 15 pounds = 27 pounds

Now, we subtract this amount from the total amount of soil to find out how much is left for the roses:
30 pounds - 27 pounds = 3 pounds

Since each rose needs 1 pound of soil, the number of roses they can plant is equal to the amount of soil left. Therefore, they can plant 3 roses.
