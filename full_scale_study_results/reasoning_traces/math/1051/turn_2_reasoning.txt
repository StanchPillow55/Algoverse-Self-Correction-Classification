Question ID: 1051
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to find out how many cups of water Ingrid drinks in 30 days. We do this by multiplying the number of cups she drinks each day by the number of days.

8 cups/day * 30 days = 240 cups

Next, we need to convert this number of cups into gallons. We know that there are 16 cups in a gallon, so we divide the total number of cups by 16.

240 cups รท 16 cups/gallon = 15 gallons

So, Ingrid drinks 15 gallons of water in 30 days.
