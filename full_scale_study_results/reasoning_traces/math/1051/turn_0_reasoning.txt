==================================================

Ingrid drinks 8 cups of water every day. 

First, we need to find out how many cups of water Ingrid drinks in 30 days. 

To do this, we multiply the number of cups she drinks each day by the number of days:

8 cups/day * 30 days = 240 cups

So, Ingrid drinks 240 cups of water in 30 days.

Next, we need to convert this number of cups to gallons. We know that there are 16 cups in a gallon.

To do this, we divide the total number of cups by the number of cups per gallon:

240 cups รท 16 cups/gallon = 15 gallons

So, Ingrid drinks 15 gallons of water in 30 days. 

Final Answer: Ingrid drinks 15 gallons of water in 30 days.
