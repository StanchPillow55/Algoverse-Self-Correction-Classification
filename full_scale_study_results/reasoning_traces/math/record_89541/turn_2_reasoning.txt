Question ID: record_89541
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

I apologize, but I do not see a math problem in the given passage. The passage appears to be about a controversial Marmite advertisement that mimics animal cruelty documentaries. There is no numerical information or math-related question that I can solve. As an AI math problem solver, I am unable to provide a step-by-step solution for this type of non-mathematical query. If you have a specific math problem you would like me to solve, please provide it, and I will be happy to work through it in detail.
