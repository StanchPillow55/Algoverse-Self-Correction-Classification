==================================================

To solve this problem, I will need to extract the relevant information from the passage and then use it to determine the final answer.

Given information:
- The passage discusses a Marmite commercial that mimics animal cruelty TV documentaries.
- The commercial shows uniformed inspectors raiding homes and shaming families.
- The owners have neglected their jars of Marmite, which are then rescued by the pseudo RSPCA inspectors and re-homed.
- Animal welfare campaigners have hit back against the advert, saying it is in bad taste.

The query asks who said they understood the concerns of some viewers.

Based on the information provided in the passage, the @placeholder said they understood the concerns of some viewers.

Therefore, the final answer is:
The @placeholder said it understood the concerns of some viewers.
