Question ID: 801
Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to calculate the total number of students and teachers in the school. 

Given that there are 40 classes, and each class has an average of 25 students, the total number of students in the school is 40 * 25 = 1000 students.

Similarly, since each class has 3 teachers, the total number of teachers in the school is 40 * 3 = 120 teachers.

Next, we need to calculate the total number of trees planted by the students and the teachers. 

Since each student plants 1 tree, the total number of trees planted by the students is 1000 * 1 = 1000 trees.

And since each teacher plants 2 trees, the total number of trees planted by the teachers is 120 * 2 = 240 trees.

Finally, to find the total number of trees planted at the end of the campaign, we add the number of trees planted by the students and the teachers. 

So, the total number of trees planted is 1000 + 240 = 1240 trees.

Therefore, they will have planted 1240 trees at the end of the campaign.
