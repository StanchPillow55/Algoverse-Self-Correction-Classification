Question ID: 736
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

Step 1: Determine how many apples Beck initially has.

Boris has 100 apples and Beck has 23 fewer apples than Boris. So, we subtract 23 from 100 to find out how many apples Beck has.

100 - 23 = 77 apples

So, Beck initially has 77 apples.

Step 2: Determine how many apples Beck has after Boris gives him 10 apples.

Boris gives Beck 10 apples, so we add 10 to Beck's initial amount of 77 apples.

77 + 10 = 87 apples

So, after Boris gives Beck 10 apples, Beck has 87 apples.

Step 3: Determine how many apples Boris has after giving Beck 10 apples.

Boris initially had 100 apples and he gave 10 to Beck, so we subtract 10 from Boris's initial amount of 100 apples.

100 - 10 = 90 apples

So, after giving Beck 10 apples, Boris has 90 apples.

Step 4: Determine how many fewer apples Beck has than Boris now.

Boris has 90 apples and Beck has 87 apples, so we subtract Beck's amount from Boris's amount to find out how many fewer apples Beck has than Boris.

90 - 87 = 3 apples

So, Beck has 3 fewer apples than Boris now.

Final Answer: After Boris gives Beck 10 apples, Beck has 3 fewer apples than Boris.
