Question ID: 736
Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

Boris starts with 100 apples. Beck starts with 23 fewer apples than Boris, so Beck has 100 - 23 = 77 apples.

Then, Boris gives Beck 10 apples. After giving away 10 apples, Boris now has 100 - 10 = 90 apples.

Beck, after receiving 10 apples from Boris, now has 77 + 10 = 87 apples.

Now, to find out how many fewer apples Beck has than Boris, we subtract Beck's total from Boris's total. So, 90 - 87 = 3.

So, Beck now has 3 fewer apples than Boris.
