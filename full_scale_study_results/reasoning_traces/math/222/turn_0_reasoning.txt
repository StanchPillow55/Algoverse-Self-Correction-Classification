Question ID: 222
Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to find out how many petunias Andy plants. We know he plants 40 fewer petunias than geraniums, and he plants 90 geraniums. So, we subtract 40 from 90 to find the number of petunias:

90 geraniums - 40 = 50 petunias

Now, we add the number of geraniums and petunias to find the total number of flowers Andy plants:

90 geraniums + 50 petunias = 140 flowers

So, Andy plants a total of 140 flowers.
