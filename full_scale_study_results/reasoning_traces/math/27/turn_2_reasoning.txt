Question ID: 27
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To determine how much Cynthia will spend on ice cream after 60 days, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the Total Number of Servings Needed:**
   Cynthia eats one serving of ice cream every night. Therefore, over 60 days, she will consume:
   \[
   1 \text{ serving/day} \times 60 \text{ days} = 60 \text{ servings}
   \]

2. **Determine the Number of Cartons Needed:**
   Each carton contains 15 servings. To find out how many cartons Cynthia needs, we divide the total number of servings by the number of servings per carton:
   \[
   \frac{60 \text{ servings}}{15 \text{ servings/carton}} = 4 \text{ cartons}
   \]

3. **Calculate the Total Cost:**
   Each carton costs $4.00. Therefore, the total cost for 4 cartons is:
   \[
   4 \text{ cartons} \times \$4.00/\text{carton} = \$16.00
   \]

Thus, after 60 days, Cynthia will spend a total of \(\$16.00\) on ice cream.

**Final Answer:**
Cynthia will spend \(\$16.00\) on ice cream after 60 days.
