Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine how many cartons of ice cream Cynthia will need over a period of 60 days and then calculate the total cost based on the price per carton.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Determine the Number of Servings Needed:**
   - Cynthia eats one serving of ice cream every night.
   - Over 60 days, she will need 60 servings of ice cream.

2. **Calculate the Number of Cartons Required:**
   - Each carton contains 15 servings of ice cream.
   - To find out how many cartons Cynthia needs, divide the total number of servings by the number of servings per carton:
     \[
     \text{Number of Cartons} = \frac{\text{Total Servings Needed}}{\text{Servings per Carton}} = \frac{60}{15} = 4
     \]
   - Cynthia will need 4 cartons of ice cream.

3. **Calculate the Total Cost:**
   - Each carton costs $4.00.
   - To find the total cost, multiply the number of cartons by the cost per carton:
     \[
     \text{Total Cost} = \text{Number of Cartons} \times \text{Cost per Carton} = 4 \times 4.00 = 16.00
     \]

### Conclusion:

Cynthia will spend a total of $16.00 on ice cream over the 60 days.

**Final Answer: $16.00**
