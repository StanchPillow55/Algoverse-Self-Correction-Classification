Dataset Type: math
==================================================

Cynthia eats one serving of ice cream every night. This means that in 60 days, she will eat 60 servings of ice cream.

Each carton of ice cream contains 15 servings. To find out how many cartons she needs to buy for 60 days, we divide the total number of servings she will eat by the number of servings in each carton. 

60 servings / 15 servings/carton = 4 cartons

Each carton costs $4.00. To find out how much she will spend, we multiply the number of cartons by the cost per carton.

4 cartons * $4.00/carton = $16.00

Therefore, Cynthia will spend $16.00 on ice cream in 60 days.
