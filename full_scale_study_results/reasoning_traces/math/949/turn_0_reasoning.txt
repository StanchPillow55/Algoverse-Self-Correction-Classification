Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

Let's start by figuring out Marcus's age. We know that Marcus is five years younger than Deanna, and Deanna is 26. So, to find Marcus's age, we subtract 5 from 26.

26 - 5 = 21

So, Marcus is 21 years old.

Next, we know that Marcus is half of Leo's age. This means that Leo's age is twice Marcus's age. So, to find Leo's age, we multiply Marcus's age by 2.

21 * 2 = 42

So, Leo is 42 years old.
