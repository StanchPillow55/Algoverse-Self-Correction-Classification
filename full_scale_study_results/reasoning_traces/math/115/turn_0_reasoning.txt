==================================================

First, we need to calculate how much Sasha spent on the lumber. 

She bought ten 2 x 4 x 10 boards for $10 each, so that's 10 boards * $10/board = $100. 

She also bought five 4 x 4 x 10 boards for $16 each, so that's 5 boards * $16/board = $80. 

So in total, she spent $100 + $80 = $180 on lumber.

Now, the prices for lumber have gone up by 50%. So, the new price for the 2 x 4 x 10 boards is $10 * 1.5 = $15 each. And the new price for the 4 x 4 x 10 boards is $16 * 1.5 = $24 each.

If she sells all of her leftover lumber, she will make 10 boards * $15/board = $150 from the 2 x 4 x 10 boards. And she will make 5 boards * $24/board = $120 from the 4 x 4 x 10 boards.

So in total, she will make $150 + $120 = $270 from selling all of her leftover lumber.

To find out how much profit she makes, we subtract the amount she spent from the amount she makes. So her profit is $270 - $180 = $90.

So, Sasha makes a profit of $90 if she sells all of her leftover lumber.
