Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to determine the size of a play set that is five times larger than James's play set. Since James's play set has 80 toys, a play set five times larger would contain 80 * 5 = <<80*5=400>>400 toys.

Jonathan needs 2 more toys than he currently has to reach this size. This means that Jonathan currently has 400 - 2 = <<400-2=398>>398 toys.

So, Jonathan currently has 398 toys.
