==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to determine how many toys Jonathan currently has based on the information provided.

1. **Understanding the size of James's play set**: 
   James has 80 toys.

2. **Calculating the size of Jonathan's desired play set**: 
   Jonathan wants a play set that is five times larger than James's play set. Therefore, we calculate:
   \[
   \text{Size of Jonathan's desired play set} = 5 \times \text{Size of James's play set} = 5 \times 80 = 400 \text{ toys}
   \]

3. **Understanding Jonathan's current situation**: 
   The problem states that Jonathan needs 2 more toys than he currently has to reach the size of his desired play set. Let's denote the number of toys Jonathan currently has as \( x \).

4. **Setting up the equation**: 
   According to the problem, if Jonathan has \( x \) toys, then he needs 2 more toys to reach 400 toys. This can be expressed as:
   \[
   x + 2 = 400
   \]

5. **Solving for \( x \)**: 
   To find \( x \), we can rearrange the equation:
   \[
   x = 400 - 2
   \]
   \[
   x = 398
   \]

6. **Conclusion**: 
   Therefore, Jonathan currently has 398 toys.

The final answer is:
\[
\boxed{398}
\]
