Question ID: 578
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

Let's break down the problem step by step.

Step 1: Diane gave a number train a starting value of 20.

This means that the initial number we are working with is 20.

Step 2: This starting value plus half the number was divided by 5.

This means we need to add half of the starting value (20) to the starting value itself and then divide the result by 5. Half of 20 is 10, so we add 20 and 10 to get 30. We then divide 30 by 5 to get 6.

Step 3: The resulting value was multiplied by the starting value minus 12.

This means we need to subtract 12 from the starting value (20) and then multiply the result by the value we got in step 2. 20 minus 12 is 8. We then multiply 8 by 6 to get 48.

So, the final value of the number train is 48.
