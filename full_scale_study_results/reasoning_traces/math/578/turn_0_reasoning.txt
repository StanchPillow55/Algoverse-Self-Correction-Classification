Dataset Type: math
==================================================

Let's break down the problem step by step.

Step 1: Diane gave a number train a starting value of 20. So, our starting number is 20.

Step 2: This starting value plus half the number. This means we add half of 20 to 20. Half of 20 is 10, so 20 + 10 = 30.

Step 3: The resulting value was divided by 5. So, we divide 30 by 5, which equals 6.

Step 4: The resulting value was multiplied by the starting value minus 12. The starting value is 20, so 20 - 12 = 8. We then multiply 6 by 8, which equals 48.

So, the final value of the number train is 48.
