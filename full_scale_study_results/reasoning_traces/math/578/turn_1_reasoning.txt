Question ID: 578
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

Let's break down the problem step by step.

Step 1: Diane gave a number train a starting value of 20.

So, the starting value is 20.

Step 2: This starting value plus half the number was divided by 5.

This means we add half of the starting value to the starting value itself and then divide the result by 5. 

So, (20 + 20/2) / 5 = (20 + 10) / 5 = 30 / 5 = 6

Step 3: The resulting value was multiplied by the starting value minus 12.

This means we subtract 12 from the starting value and then multiply the result by the value we got in step 2.

So, 6 * (20 - 12) = 6 * 8 = 48

So, the final value of the number train is 48.
