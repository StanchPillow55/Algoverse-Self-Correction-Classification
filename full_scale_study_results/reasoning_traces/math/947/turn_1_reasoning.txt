Question ID: 947
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

Jasmine initially received 15 stickers. Then, she lost 7 stickers. So, we subtract 7 from 15 to find out how many stickers she has left. 

15 - 7 = 8 stickers

Then, her teacher gave her another 5 stickers. So, we add these 5 stickers to the 8 she already has.

8 + 5 = 13 stickers

So, Jasmine has 13 stickers at the end.
