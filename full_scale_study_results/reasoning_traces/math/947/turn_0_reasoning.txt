Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

Jasmine initially had 15 stickers. She lost 7 stickers, so we subtract 7 from 15. 

15 - 7 = 8 stickers

Then, her teacher gave her another 5 stickers. So, we add these 5 stickers to the 8 stickers she already had. 

8 + 5 = 13 stickers

So, Jasmine has 13 stickers at the end. 

This is the final answer.
