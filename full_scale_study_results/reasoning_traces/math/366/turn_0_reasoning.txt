Question ID: 366
Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

Jane has already scored a total of 15 + 18 = <<15+18=33>>33 points on her first two tests.

To reach the minimum total of 42 points needed to pass, she must score at least 42 - 33 = <<42-33=9>>9 points on her third test.

So, Jane must score at least 9 points on her third test to pass.
