Question ID: 85
Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to find out how many years Gene has been vacationing. We do this by subtracting the age he started vacationing (23) from his current age (34). 

34 - 23 = 11 years

Next, we know that Gene goes on four vacations each year, and each vacation gives him one shirt (which becomes one quilt block). So, we multiply the number of years he's been vacationing by the number of vacations he takes each year.

11 years * 4 vacations/year = 44 vacations

Since each vacation gives him one shirt, and each shirt becomes one quilt block, Gene has 44 quilt blocks in total.

So, the final answer is that Gene has 44 quilt blocks.
