Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Milton Wolf, a tea party challenger, announced he will run against Senator Pat Roberts in the 2014 Republican primary.
- Wolf acknowledges he will likely need to raise $4 million by next year to mount a credible challenge against the 77-year-old senator.

To solve this problem, we need to determine the amount of money Wolf needs to raise per month to reach his $4 million goal by next year.

Step 1: Calculate the number of months until next year.
Assuming next year refers to 12 months from now, the number of months is 12.

Step 2: Calculate the amount of money Wolf needs to raise per month.
Amount of money needed per month = Total amount needed / Number of months
Amount of money needed per month = $4,000,000 / 12 months
Amount of money needed per month = $333,333.33

Therefore, Milton Wolf thinks he's up to the challenge of raising $333,333.33 per month to reach his $4 million goal by next year.
