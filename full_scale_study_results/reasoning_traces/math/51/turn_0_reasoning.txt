Question ID: 51
Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to determine how far Tom traveled. We know that he sailed from 1 to 4 PM, which is a total of 3 hours. Given that his speed was 10 miles per hour, we can calculate the distance he covered by multiplying his speed by the time. 

Distance = Speed * Time
Distance = 10 miles/hour * 3 hours = 30 miles

Now, we know that Tom travels back at a speed of 6 miles per hour. To find out how long it takes him to travel back, we need to divide the total distance by his speed.

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 30 miles / 6 miles/hour = 5 hours

So, it takes Tom 5 hours to get back.
