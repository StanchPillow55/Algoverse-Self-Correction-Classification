==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to determine how long it takes Tom to travel back after he has sailed from 1 PM to 4 PM. 

### Step 1: Determine the distance traveled from 1 PM to 4 PM

Tom's ship travels at a speed of 10 miles per hour. The time he sails from 1 PM to 4 PM is:

\[
\text{Time} = 4 \text{ PM} - 1 \text{ PM} = 3 \text{ hours}
\]

Now, we can calculate the distance he travels during this time using the formula:

\[
\text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time}
\]

Substituting the values we have:

\[
\text{Distance} = 10 \text{ miles/hour} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 30 \text{ miles}
\]

### Step 2: Determine the time taken to travel back

Now, Tom needs to travel back the same distance of 30 miles at a speed of 6 miles per hour. We can again use the distance formula, but this time we will rearrange it to find the time:

\[
\text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}}
\]

Substituting the values for the return trip:

\[
\text{Time} = \frac{30 \text{ miles}}{6 \text{ miles/hour}} = 5 \text{ hours}
\]

### Final Answer

Thus, it takes Tom **5 hours** to get back.
