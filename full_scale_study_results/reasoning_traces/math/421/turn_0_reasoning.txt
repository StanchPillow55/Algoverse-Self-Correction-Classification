==================================================

Step 1: Determine the number of cats taken by the boats

The problem states that four boats came and each boat carried away 5 cats. Therefore, the total number of cats taken by the boats is 4 boats * 5 cats/boat = 20 cats.

Step 2: Determine the number of cats remaining on the rock after the boats left

The problem started with 50 cats on the rock. After the boats took 20 cats, the number of cats remaining on the rock is 50 cats - 20 cats = 30 cats.

Step 3: Determine the number of cats that ran after the mouse

The problem states that 3/5 of the remaining cats ran after a mouse. Therefore, the number of cats that ran after the mouse is 3/5 * 30 cats = 18 cats.

Step 4: Determine the number of cats left on the rock

After the cats ran after the mouse, the number of cats left on the rock is 30 cats - 18 cats = 12 cats.

Therefore, there were 12 cats left on the rock.
