Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to know how many legs each type of pet has. Dogs and cats each have 4 legs, while birds have 2 legs.

First, let's calculate the total number of legs for each type of pet:

- Dogs: 5 dogs * 4 legs/dog = 20 legs
- Cats: 2 cats * 4 legs/cat = 8 legs
- Birds: 10 birds * 2 legs/bird = 20 legs

Now, we add up the total number of legs for all the pets:

Total legs = 20 (from dogs) + 8 (from cats) + 20 (from birds) = 48 legs

So, the pets in the store have a total of 48 legs.
