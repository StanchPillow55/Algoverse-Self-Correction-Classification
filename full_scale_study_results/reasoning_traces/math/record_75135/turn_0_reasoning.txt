==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine who the placeholder in the given query refers to.

Given information:
- The passage discusses President Obama's letters to Iran's Supreme Leader and the ongoing nuclear negotiations between Iran and the United States.
- The query states that Iran came to the table as a result of stern economic sanctions steadily enforced by @placeholder, and that person deserves full credit for that.

Based on the context provided in the passage, the @placeholder is likely referring to President Obama, as he is the one leading the negotiations with Iran and enforcing the economic sanctions.

Therefore, the final answer to the query is:

President Obama came to the table as the result of stern economic sanctions steadily enforced by President Obama, and he deserves full credit for that.
