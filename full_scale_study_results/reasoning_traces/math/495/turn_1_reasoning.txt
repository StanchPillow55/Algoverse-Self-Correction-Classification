Question ID: 495
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to calculate how many times Charisma gets up to walk each day. Since she works for 8 hours and gets up to walk every hour, she walks 8 times a day.

Next, we need to calculate how many minutes she walks each day. Since she walks for 5 minutes each time, she walks for a total of 8 times * 5 minutes = 40 minutes each day.

Finally, we need to calculate how many minutes she walks in 5 days. Since she walks for 40 minutes each day, she walks for a total of 40 minutes/day * 5 days = 200 minutes in 5 days.

So, Charisma has walked for 200 minutes after 5 days at the office.
