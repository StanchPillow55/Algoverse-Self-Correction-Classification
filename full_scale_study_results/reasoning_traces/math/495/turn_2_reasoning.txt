Question ID: 495
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

Charisma works for 8 hours each day. She walks for 5 minutes every hour. 

First, let's calculate how many minutes she walks each day. 

Since she walks 5 minutes every hour for 8 hours, we multiply 5 minutes by 8 hours. 

5 minutes/hour * 8 hours/day = 40 minutes/day

Next, we calculate how many minutes she walks in 5 days. 

Since she walks 40 minutes each day for 5 days, we multiply 40 minutes by 5 days. 

40 minutes/day * 5 days = 200 minutes

So, Charisma has walked for 200 minutes after 5 days at the office.
