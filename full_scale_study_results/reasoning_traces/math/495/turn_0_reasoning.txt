Question ID: 495
Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

Charisma works for 8 hours every day and she walks for 5 minutes every hour. 

So, in one day, the total time she spends walking is 8 hours * 5 minutes/hour = 40 minutes.

Since she works for 5 days, the total time she spends walking in 5 days is 5 days * 40 minutes/day = 200 minutes.

So, Charisma has walked for 200 minutes after 5 days at the office.
