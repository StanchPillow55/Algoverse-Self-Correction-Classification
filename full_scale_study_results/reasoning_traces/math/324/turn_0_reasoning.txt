==================================================

The problem states that people can trade 2 old records for 1 new one. This means that for each new record, 2 old records are needed.

The problem also states that 5 people came in and left with 7 new records between them. Therefore, to find out how many old records they brought in, we need to multiply the number of new records by 2.

So, the calculation is:

7 new records * 2 old records/new record = 14 old records

Therefore, the 5 people brought in 14 old records.
