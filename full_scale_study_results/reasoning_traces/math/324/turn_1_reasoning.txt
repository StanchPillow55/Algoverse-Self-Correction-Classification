Question ID: 324
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to understand the exchange rate of old records to new records. According to the problem, 2 old records can be traded for 1 new record.

The problem also states that 5 people came in and left with 7 new records between them. 

So, to find out how many old records they brought in, we need to multiply the number of new records by the exchange rate. 

The calculation is as follows:

7 new records * 2 old records/new record = 14 old records

So, the 5 people brought in 14 old records.
