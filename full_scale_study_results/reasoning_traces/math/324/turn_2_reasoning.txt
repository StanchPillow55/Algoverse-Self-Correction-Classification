Question ID: 324
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to understand that for every new record, 2 old records are needed. This means that the number of old records is twice the number of new records.

Given that the 5 people left with 7 new records, we can calculate the number of old records they brought in by multiplying the number of new records by 2.

So, the calculation would be:

7 new records * 2 old records/new record = 14 old records

Therefore, the 5 people brought in 14 old records to Ralph's record store.
