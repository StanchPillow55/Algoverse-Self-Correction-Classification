==================================================

The problem states that a pen costs as much as a pencil and eraser combined. 

First, we need to find out how much a pencil and eraser cost together. 

The cost of a pencil is $1.20 and the cost of an eraser is $0.30. 

So, the total cost of a pencil and eraser is $1.20 + $0.30 = $1.50.

Therefore, the cost of one pen is $1.50.

The problem asks us to find out how much 8 pens will cost. 

To find this, we multiply the cost of one pen by 8.

So, 8 pens will cost 8 * $1.50 = $12.00.

Therefore, 8 pens will cost $12.00.
