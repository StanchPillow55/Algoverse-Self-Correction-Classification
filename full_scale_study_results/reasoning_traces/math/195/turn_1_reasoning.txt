Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

Step 1: Find the cost of a pen
The cost of a pen is equal to the cost of a pencil and an eraser combined. So, we add the cost of the pencil and the eraser to find the cost of a pen.

Cost of pencil = $1.20
Cost of eraser = $0.30

Cost of pen = Cost of pencil + Cost of eraser
Cost of pen = $1.20 + $0.30 = $1.50

Step 2: Find the cost of 8 pens
Now that we know the cost of a pen, we can find the cost of 8 pens by multiplying the cost of a pen by 8.

Cost of 8 pens = Cost of pen x 8
Cost of 8 pens = $1.50 x 8 = $12.00

So, 8 pens will cost $12.00.
