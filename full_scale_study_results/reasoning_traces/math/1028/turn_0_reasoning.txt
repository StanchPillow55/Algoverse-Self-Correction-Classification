Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to determine how much Tom still owes for the bedroom set after selling his old one. He bought the set for $3000 and sold his old one for $1000. So, he still owes $3000 - $1000 = $2000.

Next, we need to calculate how much 10% of $2000 is, since that's how much Tom has to pay per month. To do this, we multiply $2000 by 10% (or 0.10 in decimal form). 

$2000 * 0.10 = $200.

So, Tom has to pay $200 per month for the bedroom set.
