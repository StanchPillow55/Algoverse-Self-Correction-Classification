==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine how much Tom has to pay per month for his new bedroom set after accounting for the sale of his old bedroom set and the monthly interest rate.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Cost of the New Bedroom Set:**
   - The cost of the new bedroom set is $3000.

2. **Sale of the Old Bedroom Set:**
   - Tom sells his old bedroom set for $1000. He uses this amount to pay part of the cost of the new bedroom set.
   - Therefore, the remaining amount Tom needs to pay for the new bedroom set is:
     \[
     3000 - 1000 = 2000
     \]

3. **Monthly Interest Rate:**
   - Tom has to pay 10% interest per month on the remaining amount.
   - The monthly interest is calculated as 10% of the remaining amount ($2000).

4. **Calculate the Monthly Interest:**
   - The monthly interest is:
     \[
     0.10 \times 2000 = 200
     \]

5. **Total Monthly Payment:**
   - Since Tom is only paying the interest each month, his monthly payment is equal to the monthly interest.
   - Therefore, Tom has to pay $200 per month.

Thus, the final answer is that Tom has to pay **$200 per month**.
