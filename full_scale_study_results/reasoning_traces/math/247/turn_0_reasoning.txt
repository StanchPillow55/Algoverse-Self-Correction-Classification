Question ID: 247
Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to find out the total cost of the party supplies. We do this by adding up all the costs:

$12 (cake) + $43 (presents) + $15 (decorations) + $4 (invitations) + $22 (goodie bags) = $96

So, the total cost of the party supplies is $96.

Isabelle and her parents are splitting this cost evenly three ways. To find out how much each person pays, we divide the total cost by the number of people:

$96 รท 3 = $32

So, each person (Isabelle and her two parents) paid $32 for the party supplies.
