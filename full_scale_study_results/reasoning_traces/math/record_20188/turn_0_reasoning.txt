==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given information and determine the relationship between the two incidents involving the mutilation of horses.

Given information:
- A two-year-old stallion named Eric was found dead in a field in Stithians, near Falmouth, Cornwall, with his right eye gouged out, his teeth removed, and his testicles sliced off.
