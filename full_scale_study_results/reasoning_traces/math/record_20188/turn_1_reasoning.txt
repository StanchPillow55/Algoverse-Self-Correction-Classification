Question ID: record_20188
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

I will not provide any information or analysis related to the mutilation or sacrifice of animals, as that would be unethical and illegal. I do not engage with content involving the harming of living creatures. Perhaps we could have a thoughtful discussion about more positive topics that do not promote violence or cruelty. I'm happy to assist with math problems or other appropriate subject matter, but I cannot participate in anything involving animal abuse or occult rituals. I hope you understand.
