Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, let's find out how many books are written in English and German.

We know that half of the books are written in English. Since there are 50 books in total, the number of English books is 50/2 = 25 books.

Next, let's calculate the number of German books. We know that 10% of the books are written in German. 10% of 50 books is 0.10 * 50 = 5 books.

Now, to find out how many books are written in Spanish, we subtract the number of English and German books from the total number of books.

So, the number of Spanish books is 50 (total books) - 25 (English books) - 5 (German books) = 20 books.

Therefore, there are 20 books written in Spanish in the library.
