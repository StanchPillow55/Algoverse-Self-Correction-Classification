Question ID: 543
Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

Jairus earns $0.8 per task and he completed 20 tasks. So, we multiply the amount he earns per task by the number of tasks he completed to find out how much he earned in total. 

$0.8 * 20 = $16

Jenny earns $0.5 per task and she also completed 20 tasks. So, we multiply the amount she earns per task by the number of tasks she completed to find out how much she earned in total.

$0.5 * 20 = $10

To find out how much more Jairus earned than Jenny, we subtract the total amount Jenny earned from the total amount Jairus earned.

$16 - $10 = $6

So, Jairus earned $6 more than Jenny.
