Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To determine if the word 'roll' is used with the same meaning in both sentences, we need to analyze the context and usage of the word in each sentence.

Sentence 1: "Roll out the paper."
In this sentence, the word 'roll' is used as a verb, and it means to spread out or unfurl a flat object, such as a sheet of paper.

Sentence 2: "She rolled the ball."
In this sentence, the word 'roll' is also used as a verb, but it means to move an object by causing it to turn over and over.

Based on the different meanings of the word 'roll' in the two sentences, we can conclude that the word is not used with the same meaning in both sentences.

In the first sentence, 'roll' refers to the action of spreading out or unrolling a flat object, while in the second sentence, 'roll' refers to the action of moving an object by causing it to turn over and over.

Therefore, the answer is:
No, the word 'roll' is not used with the same meaning in both sentences.
