==================================================

To determine if the word "roll" is used with the same meaning in both sentences, we need to analyze the context and usage of the word in each sentence.

Sentence 1: "Roll out the paper."
In this sentence, the word "roll" is used as a verb, and it refers to the action of unrolling or spreading out a sheet of paper.

Sentence 2: "She rolled the ball."
In this sentence, the word "roll" is also used as a verb, but it refers to the action of moving a ball by causing it to turn over and over.

Analyzing the two sentences:
1. In the first sentence, "roll" is used to describe the action of unrolling or spreading out a sheet of paper.
2. In the second sentence, "roll" is used to describe the action of moving a ball by causing it to turn over and over.

Therefore, the word "roll" is not used with the same meaning in both sentences. The meaning of "roll" is different in each sentence, as it refers to different actions.

Final answer:
No, the word "roll" is not used with the same meaning in both sentences.
