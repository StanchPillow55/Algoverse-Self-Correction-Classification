==================================================

To solve this problem, I need to find the missing word in the query based on the information provided in the passage.

The passage states that Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold were the two teenage boys who carried out the Columbine shooting. It also mentions that Harris and Klebold were not part of the Trench Coat Mafia, as is commonly believed.

The query states that "Harris was a psychopath and @placeholder battled depression, according to psychologists cited in the book."

Based on the information in the passage, the missing word is "Klebold", as the passage indicates that Klebold, along with Harris, carried out the Columbine shooting.

Therefore, the complete answer is:

Harris was a psychopath and Klebold battled depression, according to psychologists cited in the book.
