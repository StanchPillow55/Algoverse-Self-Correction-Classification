Question ID: 849
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine how many trays of eggs the farmer can fill with the 900 eggs he has, and then calculate the total earnings from selling these trays at $2.5 each.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Determine the Number of Trays:**
   - The farmer has 900 eggs.
   - Each tray holds 30 eggs.
   - To find out how many trays can be filled, we divide the total number of eggs by the number of eggs per tray.

   \[
   \text{Number of trays} = \frac{900 \text{ eggs}}{30 \text{ eggs/tray}} = 30 \text{ trays}
   \]

2. **Calculate the Total Earnings:**
   - Each tray is sold for $2.5.
   - The farmer has 30 trays to sell.
   - To find the total earnings, multiply the number of trays by the price per tray.

   \[
   \text{Total earnings} = 30 \text{ trays} \times 2.5 \text{ dollars/tray} = 75 \text{ dollars}
   \]

### Final Answer:
The farmer will earn $75 from selling the trays of eggs.
