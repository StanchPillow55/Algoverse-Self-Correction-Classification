Question ID: 849
Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to determine how many trays the farmer can fill with his 900 eggs. Since each tray holds 30 eggs, we divide the total number of eggs by the number of eggs per tray.

900 eggs รท 30 eggs/tray = 30 trays

Next, we need to calculate how much the farmer will earn from selling all of these trays. Since each tray sells for $2.5, we multiply the number of trays by the price per tray.

30 trays ร $2.5/tray = $75

So, the farmer will earn $75 if he sells all of his eggs.
