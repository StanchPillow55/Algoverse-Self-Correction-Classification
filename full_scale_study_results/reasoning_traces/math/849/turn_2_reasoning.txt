Question ID: 849
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine how many trays of eggs the farmer can fill with his 900 eggs, and then calculate the total earnings from selling these trays at $2.5 each.

### Step 1: Determine the Number of Trays

The farmer has 900 eggs, and each tray holds 30 eggs. To find out how many trays the farmer can fill, we divide the total number of eggs by the number of eggs per tray:

\[
\text{Number of trays} = \frac{900 \text{ eggs}}{30 \text{ eggs/tray}}
\]

Performing the division:

\[
\frac{900}{30} = 30
\]

So, the farmer can fill 30 trays with his 900 eggs.

### Step 2: Calculate Total Earnings

The farmer sells each tray for $2.5. To find out how much the farmer will earn from selling all the trays, we multiply the number of trays by the price per tray:

\[
\text{Total earnings} = 30 \text{ trays} \times 2.5 \text{ dollars/tray}
\]

Performing the multiplication:

\[
30 \times 2.5 = 75
\]

### Conclusion

The farmer will earn a total of $75 from selling all the trays of eggs.

**Final Answer: The farmer will earn $75.**
