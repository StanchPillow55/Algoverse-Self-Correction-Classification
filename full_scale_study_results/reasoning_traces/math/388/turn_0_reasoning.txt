Question ID: 388
Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to find out how many messages James delivers to Mr. Yu. We know that he delivers 1/3 as many messages to Mr. Yu as he does to Ms. Thompson. 

To find this, we multiply the number of messages delivered to Ms. Thompson by 1/3. 

66 messages * 1/3 = 22 messages

So, James delivers 22 messages to Mr. Yu.

To find the total number of messages delivered, we add the number of messages delivered to Ms. Thompson and Mr. Yu.

66 messages (for Ms. Thompson) + 22 messages (for Mr. Yu) = 88 messages

So, James delivers a total of 88 messages.
