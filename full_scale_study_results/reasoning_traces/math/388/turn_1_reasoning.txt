Question ID: 388
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to find out how many messages James delivers to Mr. Yu. Since he delivers 1/3 as many messages to Mr. Yu as he does to Ms. Thompson, we need to divide the number of messages he delivers to Ms. Thompson by 3.

66 รท 3 = 22

So, James delivers 22 messages to Mr. Yu.

To find the total number of messages James delivers, we need to add the number of messages he delivers to Ms. Thompson and Mr. Yu.

66 (Ms. Thompson) + 22 (Mr. Yu) = 88

Therefore, James delivers a total of 88 messages.
