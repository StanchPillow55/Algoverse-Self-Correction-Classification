Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to convert the distance from miles to feet because the speed is given in feet per minute. We know that 1 mile is equal to 5280 feet.

So, Steve's distance from school is 3 miles * 5280 feet/mile = 15840 feet.
Tim's distance from school is 2 miles * 5280 feet/mile = 10560 feet.

Next, we calculate the time it takes for each of them to get home. Time is distance divided by speed.

For Steve, time = distance/speed = 15840 feet / 440 feet/minute = 36 minutes.
For Tim, time = distance/speed = 10560 feet / 264 feet/minute = 40 minutes.

So, Steve will get home first because it takes him less time. 

The winner (Steve) will be waiting at their house for the time difference between when the loser (Tim) arrives and when he arrives. 

So, the waiting time = Tim's time - Steve's time = 40 minutes - 36 minutes = 4 minutes.

Therefore, the winner will be waiting for 4 minutes before the loser finishes the race.
