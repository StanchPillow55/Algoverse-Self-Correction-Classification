==================================================

First, we need to determine how many 10-foot sections are in a 200-foot tree. We do this by dividing the total height of the tree by the height of each section. 

200 feet / 10 feet = 20 sections

Next, we need to calculate the total weight of the tree before the termites ate part of it. We do this by multiplying the number of sections by the weight of each section.

20 sections * 400 pounds/section = 8000 pounds

Now, we need to calculate how much weight the termites ate. We do this by multiplying the total weight of the tree by the percentage that the termites ate.

8000 pounds * 30% = 2400 pounds

Finally, we subtract the weight that the termites ate from the total weight of the tree to find the current weight of the tree.

8000 pounds - 2400 pounds = 5600 pounds

So, the redwood tree weighs 5600 pounds after the termites ate 30% of its wood.
