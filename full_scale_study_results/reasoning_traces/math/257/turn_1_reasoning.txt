Question ID: 257
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to determine how many 10-foot sections are in a 200-foot redwood tree. We do this by dividing the total height of the tree by the height of each section. 

200 feet / 10 feet = 20 sections

Each section weighs 400 pounds, so the total weight of the tree before the termites ate part of it would be:

20 sections * 400 pounds/section = 8000 pounds

The termites ate 30% of the tree's wood, so they ate 30% of its total weight. We find 30% of 8000 pounds by multiplying:

8000 pounds * 30/100 = 2400 pounds

So, the termites ate 2400 pounds of the tree's wood. To find the weight of the tree after the termites ate part of it, we subtract the weight of the wood the termites ate from the tree's total weight before the termites ate part of it:

8000 pounds - 2400 pounds = 5600 pounds

So, the redwood tree weighs 5600 pounds after the termites ate 30% of its wood.
