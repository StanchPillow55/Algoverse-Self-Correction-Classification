Question ID: 257
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, let's find out how many 10-foot sections are in a 200-foot redwood tree. We do this by dividing the total height of the tree by the height of each section. 

200 feet / 10 feet = 20 sections

Each of these sections weighs 400 pounds, so the total weight of the tree before the termites ate part of it is:

20 sections * 400 pounds/section = 8000 pounds

The termites ate 30% of the tree. To find out how much weight this represents, we multiply the total weight of the tree by 30% (or 0.3):

8000 pounds * 0.3 = 2400 pounds

So, the termites ate 2400 pounds of the tree. To find out how much the tree weighs after the termites ate part of it, we subtract the weight eaten by the termites from the total weight of the tree:

8000 pounds - 2400 pounds = 5600 pounds

So, the redwood tree weighs 5600 pounds after the termites ate 30% of it.
