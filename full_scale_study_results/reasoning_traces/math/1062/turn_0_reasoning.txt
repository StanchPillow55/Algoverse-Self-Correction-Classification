Dataset Type: math
==================================================

Let's break down the costs one by one:

1. The cost of the cast is straightforward, it's $200.

2. The doctor's visit is charged per hour, but Hannah only stayed for 30 minutes. So, we need to calculate the cost for half an hour. Since the doctor charges $300 per hour, for half an hour, the cost would be $300/2 = $150.

3. The cost of the painkillers is $4 per pill and Hannah needs 30 pills. So, the total cost for the painkillers would be $4 * 30 = $120.

4. The parking cost is $6 per hour and Hannah has to pay for a minimum of 2 hours. So, the total cost for parking would be $6 * 2 = $12.

Now, we just need to add up all these costs to find the total cost of the doctor's visit.

$200 (cast) + $150 (doctor's visit) + $120 (painkillers) + $12 (parking) = $482

So, the total cost of Hannah's doctor's visit is $482.
