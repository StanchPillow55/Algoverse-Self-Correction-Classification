Question ID: 409
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, let's calculate how much each employee earns in a week. 

Each employee works for 40 hours a week and is paid $15 per hour. So, the weekly pay for each employee is 40 hours/week * $15/hour = $600/week.

In May, the company hired 40 employees. So, the total amount of money the company paid to the employees in May is 40 employees * $600/week/employee * 4 weeks/month = $96,000.

In June, 1/4 of the employees' contracts expired. So, the number of employees in June is 40 employees - 1/4 * 40 employees = 30 employees.

So, the total amount of money the company paid to the employees in June is 30 employees * $600/week/employee * 4 weeks/month = $72,000.

Therefore, the total amount of money the company paid to the employees in the two months is $96,000 + $72,000 = $168,000. 

So, the company paid a total of $168,000 to the employees in May and June.
