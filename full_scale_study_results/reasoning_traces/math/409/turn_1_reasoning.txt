Question ID: 409
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, let's calculate the weekly wage for one employee. Since each employee is paid $15 per hour for a 40-hour workweek, the weekly wage for one employee is:

15 dollars/hour * 40 hours/week = 600 dollars/week

Next, let's calculate the total weekly wage for all employees in May. Since there were 40 employees in May, the total weekly wage for all employees in May is:

600 dollars/week/employee * 40 employees = 24000 dollars/week

Since May has 4 weeks, the total wage for all employees in May is:

24000 dollars/week * 4 weeks = 96000 dollars

In June, 1/4 of the employees' contracts expired, so the number of employees in June is:

40 employees - 1/4 * 40 employees = 30 employees

The total weekly wage for all employees in June is:

600 dollars/week/employee * 30 employees = 18000 dollars/week

Since June also has 4 weeks, the total wage for all employees in June is:

18000 dollars/week * 4 weeks = 72000 dollars

Finally, let's calculate the total amount of money the company paid to the employees in the two months. This is the sum of the total wages for May and June, which is:

96000 dollars + 72000 dollars = 168000 dollars

So, the company paid a total of $168,000 to the employees in the two months.
