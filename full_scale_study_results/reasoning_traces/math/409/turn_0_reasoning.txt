Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, let's calculate the weekly pay for each employee. Since each employee is paid $15 per hour for a 40-hour workweek, the weekly pay for each employee is $15/hour * 40 hours/week = $600/week.

Next, let's calculate the total weekly pay for all employees in May. Since there were 40 employees in May, the total weekly pay for all employees in May is $600/week/employee * 40 employees = $24,000/week.

Since May has 4 weeks, the total pay for all employees in May is $24,000/week * 4 weeks = $96,000.

In June, 1/4 of the employees' contracts expired, so the number of employees in June is 40 employees - 1/4 * 40 employees = 30 employees.

The total weekly pay for all employees in June is $600/week/employee * 30 employees = $18,000/week.

Since June also has 4 weeks, the total pay for all employees in June is $18,000/week * 4 weeks = $72,000.

Therefore, the total amount of money the company paid to the employees in the two months is $96,000 + $72,000 = $168,000.
