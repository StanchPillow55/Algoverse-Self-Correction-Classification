Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, I will go through the details provided in the paragraph and analyze the information to determine whether the newlywed couple has a room at the Waldorf Astoria hotel.

Given information:
- The paragraph describes various guests staying at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel in New York City.
- In the opening scene, a newlywed couple discover there are no rooms available at the hotel.
- However, they are given use of an apartment by a Mr. Jesup, who is going away for the weekend.

Reasoning:
1. The paragraph states that the newlywed couple "discover there are no rooms available" at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel.
2. This indicates that the newlywed couple does not have a room at the hotel.
3. Instead, they are given use of an apartment by Mr. Jesup, who is going away for the weekend.
4. This suggests that the newlywed couple is not staying in a room at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel, but rather in an apartment provided by Mr. Jesup.

Final answer:
No, the newlywe
