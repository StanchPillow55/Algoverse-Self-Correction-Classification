Dataset Type: math
==================================================

Catherine buys 1 kilo of apples for $4. This cost is straightforward and doesn't require any additional calculations.

Next, she buys 2 kilos of bananas for $2 per kilo. To find the total cost of the bananas, we multiply the number of kilos by the cost per kilo: 2 kilos * $2/kilo = $4.

Then, she buys 2 kilos of oranges for $3 per kilo. Again, we multiply the number of kilos by the cost per kilo to find the total cost: 2 kilos * $3/kilo = $6.

Finally, to find the total amount Catherine pays, we add up the cost of the apples, bananas, and oranges: $4 (apples) + $4 (bananas) + $6 (oranges) = $14.

So, Catherine pays a total of $14.
