Question ID: 685
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of each type of fruit that Catherine buys and then sum these costs to find the total amount she pays.

1. **Cost of Apples:**
   - Catherine buys 1 kilo of apples.
   - The cost per kilo of apples is $4.
   - Therefore, the cost for apples is:
     \[
     1 \text{ kilo} \times \$4/\text{kilo} = \$4
     \]

2. **Cost of Bananas:**
   - Catherine buys 2 kilos of bananas.
   - The cost per kilo of bananas is $2.
   - Therefore, the cost for bananas is:
     \[
     2 \text{ kilos} \times \$2/\text{kilo} = \$4
     \]

3. **Cost of Oranges:**
   - Catherine buys 2 kilos of oranges.
   - The cost per kilo of oranges is $3.
   - Therefore, the cost for oranges is:
     \[
     2 \text{ kilos} \times \$3/\text{kilo} = \$6
     \]

4. **Total Cost:**
   - To find the total amount Catherine pays, we add the costs of all the fruits:
     \[
     \$4 \text{ (apples)} + \$4 \text{ (bananas)} + \$6 \text{ (oranges)} = \$14
     \]

Therefore, Catherine pays a total of $14.

**Final Answer:**
Catherine pays $14 in total.
