Question ID: 1018
Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to determine how long it takes James to read one page. We know that it takes him 10 minutes to read 3 pages, so we divide the total time by the number of pages to find the time per page:

10 minutes / 3 pages = 3.33 minutes/page

Next, we need to find out how long it takes James to read 18 pages. We do this by multiplying the time per page by the number of pages:

3.33 minutes/page * 18 pages = 59.94 minutes

Since we can't have a fraction of a minute, we'll round this up to the nearest whole number, which is 60 minutes.

So, James spends 60 minutes reading before he goes to sleep.
