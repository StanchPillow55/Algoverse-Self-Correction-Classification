Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to find out how much blood a shark has. Since we know that a shark has three times as much blood as a whale, and a whale has 40 gallons of blood, we can calculate the amount of blood a shark has by multiplying the amount of blood a whale has by 3.

40 gallons/whale * 3 = 120 gallons/shark

This means that each shark has 120 gallons of blood.

Next, we need to find out how much blood ten sharks have. We can do this by multiplying the amount of blood one shark has by the number of sharks.

120 gallons/shark * 10 sharks = 1200 gallons

Therefore, ten sharks swimming in the sea have 1200 gallons of blood.
