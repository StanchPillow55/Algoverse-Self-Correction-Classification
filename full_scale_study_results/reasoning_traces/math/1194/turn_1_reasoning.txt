Question ID: 1194
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to determine how much blood a single shark has. Since we know that a shark has three times as much blood as a whale, and a whale has 40 gallons of blood, we can calculate the amount of blood in a shark by multiplying the amount of blood in a whale by 3.

40 gallons/whale * 3 = 120 gallons/shark

This means that each shark has 120 gallons of blood.

Next, we need to calculate how much blood ten sharks have. We do this by multiplying the amount of blood a single shark has by the number of sharks.

120 gallons/shark * 10 sharks = 1200 gallons

So, ten sharks swimming in the sea have 1200 gallons of blood.
