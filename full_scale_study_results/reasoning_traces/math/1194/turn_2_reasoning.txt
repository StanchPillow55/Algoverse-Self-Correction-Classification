Question ID: 1194
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to find out how much blood a shark has. According to the problem, a shark has three times as much blood as a whale. Since a whale has 40 gallons of blood, we can calculate the amount of blood a shark has by multiplying 40 by 3.

40 gallons/whale * 3 = 120 gallons/shark

So, a shark has 120 gallons of blood.

Next, we need to find out how much blood ten sharks have. We can do this by multiplying the amount of blood one shark has by ten.

120 gallons/shark * 10 sharks = 1200 gallons

So, ten sharks have 1200 gallons of blood.

Therefore, the final answer is that ten sharks swimming in the sea have 1200 gallons of blood.
