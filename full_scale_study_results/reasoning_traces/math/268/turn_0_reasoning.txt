==================================================

The real estate agent spent $5 on each newspaper ad and bought 50 of them. So, the total cost of the newspaper ads is $5 * 50 = $250.

He also spent $75 on each television ad and bought 15 of them. So, the total cost of the television ads is $75 * 15 = $1125.

To find out how much the real estate agent spent on buying all the ads, we need to add the total cost of the newspaper ads and the total cost of the television ads. 

So, the total cost is $250 (for newspaper ads) + $1125 (for television ads) = $1375.

Therefore, the real estate agent spent $1375 on buying all the ads.
