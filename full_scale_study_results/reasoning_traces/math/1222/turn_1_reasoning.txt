Question ID: 1222
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to find the total width of all the windows. Since each window is 35 inches wide and there are five windows, we multiply 35 inches by 5. 

35 inches/window * 5 windows = 175 inches

Next, since Luke needs to buy fabric equal to 2 times the total width of the windows, we multiply the total width by 2.

175 inches * 2 = 350 inches

So, Luke should buy 350 inches of fabric.
