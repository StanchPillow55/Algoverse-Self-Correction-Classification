Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to find the total width of all the windows. Since each window is 35 inches wide and there are 5 windows, we multiply 35 by 5.

35 inches/window * 5 windows = 175 inches

Next, we know that Luke needs to buy fabric equal to 2 times the total width of the windows. So we multiply the total width of the windows by 2.

175 inches * 2 = 350 inches

Therefore, Luke should buy 350 inches of fabric.
