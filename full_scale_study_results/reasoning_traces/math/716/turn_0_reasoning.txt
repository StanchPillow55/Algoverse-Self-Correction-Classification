==================================================

First, we need to calculate the total calories from each ingredient.

For the eggs: 
John uses 6 eggs for his omelet. Given that each egg is 75 calories, we multiply the number of eggs by the calories per egg. 

6 eggs * 75 calories/egg = 450 calories

For the cheese: 
John uses 2 oz of cheese. Given that each ounce of cheese is 120 calories, we multiply the amount of cheese by the calories per ounce.

2 oz * 120 calories/oz = 240 calories

For the ham: 
John uses an equal amount of ham as cheese, which is 2 oz. Given that each ounce of ham is 40 calories, we multiply the amount of ham by the calories per ounce.

2 oz * 40 calories/oz = 80 calories

Now, we add up the calories from each ingredient to find the total calories in the omelet.

450 calories (from eggs) + 240 calories (from cheese) + 80 calories (from ham) = 770 calories

So, John's omelet is 770 calories.
