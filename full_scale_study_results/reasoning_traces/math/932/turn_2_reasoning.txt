Question ID: 932
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to calculate how many water balloons were initially given out. Maria gave each of her 4 friends 2 water balloons, so that's 4 friends * 2 balloons = 8 balloons. Maria also had 1 balloon for herself, so the initial total is 8 balloons + 1 balloon = 9 balloons.

Next, Maria's mom came out and gave each person (Maria and her 4 friends) 3 more balloons. That's 5 people * 3 balloons = 15 balloons.

To find the total number of balloons, we add the initial total to the number of balloons Maria's mom gave out. So, 9 balloons + 15 balloons = 24 balloons.

Therefore, the girls had a total of 24 water balloons.
