Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to calculate how many balloons Maria initially gave to her friends. Since she gave each of her 4 friends 2 balloons, we multiply 4 (the number of friends) by 2 (the number of balloons each friend received). 

4 friends * 2 balloons/friend = 8 balloons

Then, we add the balloon Maria had for herself:

8 balloons + 1 balloon = 9 balloons

Next, Maria's mom gave each person (Maria and her 4 friends, so 5 people in total) 3 more balloons. We multiply the number of people by the number of balloons each person received:

5 people * 3 balloons/person = 15 balloons

Finally, we add the number of balloons they had initially to the number of balloons Maria's mom gave them:

9 balloons + 15 balloons = 24 balloons

So, the girls had a total of 24 water balloons.
