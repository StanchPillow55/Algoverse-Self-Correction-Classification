Question ID: 932
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, let's calculate how many water balloons Maria initially gave to her friends. Since she gave each of her 4 friends 2 water balloons, we multiply 4 (the number of friends) by 2 (the number of balloons each friend received). 

4 friends * 2 balloons/friend = 8 balloons

So, Maria's friends started with 8 balloons in total. 

Maria had 1 balloon for herself, so initially, they had 8 (friends' balloons) + 1 (Maria's balloon) = 9 balloons in total.

Then, Maria's mom gave each person (Maria and her 4 friends, so 5 people in total) 3 more balloons. We multiply 5 (the number of people) by 3 (the number of balloons each person received).

5 people * 3 balloons/person = 15 balloons

So, Maria's mom gave them 15 more balloons.

To find the total number of balloons, we add the number of balloons they started with (9 balloons) to the number of balloons Maria's mom gave them (15 balloons).

9 balloons + 15 balloons = 24 balloons

So, the girls had 24 balloons in total.
