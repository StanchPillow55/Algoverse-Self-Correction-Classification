Question ID: 296
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, let's calculate how much rice the household consumes in a day. 

Each person eats 0.2 kg of rice per meal, and since they eat rice for lunch and dinner, that's 0.2 kg * 2 = 0.4 kg of rice per person per day.

If there are 5 people in the household, then the total amount of rice consumed in a day is 0.4 kg/person * 5 people = 2 kg/day.

Next, let's calculate how long the 42 kg bag of rice will last. 

If the household consumes 2 kg of rice per day, then the bag of rice will last 42 kg / 2 kg/day = 21 days.

Since there are 7 days in a week, the bag of rice will last 21 days / 7 days/week = 3 weeks.

So, the 42 kg bag of rice will last for 3 weeks.
