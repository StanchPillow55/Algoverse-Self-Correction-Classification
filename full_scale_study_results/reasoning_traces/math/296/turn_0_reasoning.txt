==================================================

First, let's calculate how much rice the household consumes in a day. 

Each person consumes 0.2 kg of rice per meal, and since they eat rice twice a day (lunch and dinner), each person consumes 0.2 kg x 2 = 0.4 kg of rice per day.

Since there are 5 members in the household, the total amount of rice consumed in a day is 0.4 kg x 5 = 2 kg.

Next, let's calculate how many days a 42 kg bag of rice will last. 

To do this, we divide the total weight of the rice by the amount of rice consumed per day. 

So, 42 kg รท 2 kg/day = 21 days.

Finally, to convert this to weeks, we divide the number of days by 7 (since there are 7 days in a week).

So, 21 days รท 7 = 3 weeks.

Therefore, a 42 kg bag of rice will last the household 3 weeks.
