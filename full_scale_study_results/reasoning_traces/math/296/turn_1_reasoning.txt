==================================================

To solve this problem, we first need to determine how much rice the household consumes in a day. 

Step 1: Daily Rice Consumption
Each person consumes 0.2 kg of rice per meal, and they eat rice twice a day (lunch and dinner). So, the amount of rice consumed by one person in a day is 0.2 kg/meal * 2 meals/day = 0.4 kg/day. 

Since there are 5 members in the household, the total amount of rice consumed by the household in a day is 0.4 kg/day/person * 5 persons = 2 kg/day.

Step 2: Weekly Rice Consumption
There are 7 days in a week, so the total amount of rice consumed by the household in a week is 2 kg/day * 7 days/week = 14 kg/week.

Step 3: Duration of Rice Supply
Finally, we divide the total amount of rice in the bag by the weekly consumption to find out how many weeks the rice will last. 

So, the 42 kg bag of rice will last for 42 kg / 14 kg/week = 3 weeks.

Therefore, a 42 kg bag of rice will last for 3 weeks for this household.
