Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to calculate how much John earns from renting out his car. He rents it out 10 times a month for 3 hours each time, which means he rents it out for a total of 10 * 3 = <<10*3=30>>30 hours a month.

He gets paid $25 an hour, so his total earnings from renting out his car are 30 hours * $25/hour = $<<30*25=750>>750.

Next, we need to subtract his car payment from his earnings to find his profit. His car payment is $500, so his profit is $750 - $500 = $<<750-500=250>>250.

Therefore, John makes a profit of $250 on his car each month.
