==================================================

Let's denote the total number of students as X. 

According to the problem, 3/4 of the students have a desktop computer at home. This means that 1/4 of the students do not have a desktop computer at home. 

We know that 20 students do not have a desktop computer at home. 

Therefore, we can set up the equation 1/4*X = 20 to find the total number of students. 

To solve for X, we multiply both sides of the equation by 4:

4*(1/4*X) = 4*20
X = 80

So, there are 80 students at that grade level.
