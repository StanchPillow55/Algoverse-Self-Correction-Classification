Question ID: 608
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to calculate the total cost of the shirt and shorts before the discount. 

The shirt costs $25 and the shorts cost $35. 

So, the total cost is $25 + $35 = $60.

Next, we need to calculate the amount of the discount. The store is offering a 30% discount. 

To find the amount of the discount, we multiply the total cost by the discount rate. 

So, the discount is $60 * 0.30 = $18.

Now, we subtract the discount from the total cost to find the final cost. 

So, the final cost is $60 - $18 = $42.

Finally, we subtract the final cost from the amount of money Joe has to find out how much money he will have left. 

Joe has $50, so he will have $50 - $42 = $8 left after the purchase.

Therefore, Joe will have $8 left after buying the shirt and shorts.
