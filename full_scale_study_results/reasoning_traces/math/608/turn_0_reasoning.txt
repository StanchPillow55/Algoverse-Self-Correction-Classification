Question ID: 608
Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to find out the total cost of the shirt and the shorts before the discount. 

The total cost is $25 (for the shirt) + $35 (for the shorts) = $60.

Next, we need to calculate the amount of the discount. The store is offering a 30% discount, so we multiply the total cost by 30% (or 0.30 in decimal form).

The discount is $60 * 0.30 = $18.

Now, we subtract the discount from the total cost to find out how much Joe has to pay.

The final cost is $60 - $18 = $42.

Finally, we subtract the final cost from the amount of money Joe has to find out how much he will have left.

Joe will have $50 - $42 = $8 left after the purchase.

So, Joe will have $8 left.
