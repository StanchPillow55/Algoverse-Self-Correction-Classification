Question ID: 608
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, let's calculate the total cost of the shirt and the shorts before the discount. 

The total cost is $25 (for the shirt) + $35 (for the shorts) = $60.

Next, we need to calculate the amount of the discount. The store is offering a 30% discount, so we multiply the total cost by 30% (or 0.30 in decimal form).

The discount is $60 * 0.30 = $18.

Now, we subtract the discount from the total cost to find out how much Joe will actually pay.

The final cost is $60 - $18 = $42.

Joe started with $50, so we subtract the final cost from his starting amount to find out how much money he will have left.

Joe will have $50 - $42 = $8 left after the purchase.

So, the final answer is that Joe will have $8 left.
