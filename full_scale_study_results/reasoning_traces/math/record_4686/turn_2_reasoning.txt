Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine the year the Civil War ended and then calculate the number of years between the end of the Civil War and the first observance of Memorial Day.

Given information:
- Memorial Day was first marked on May 30, 1868.

Step 1: Determine the year the Civil War ended.
The Civil War in the United States lasted from 1861 to 1865.
The Civil War ended in 1865.

Step 2: Calculate the number of years between the end of the Civil War and the first observance of Memorial Day.
Number of years = 1868 - 1865 = 3 years

Therefore, Memorial Day was first marked three years after the end of the @placeholder, which was the Civil War.

Final answer: The Civil War
