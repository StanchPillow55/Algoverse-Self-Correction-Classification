==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine the year the Civil War ended and then calculate the number of years between the end of the Civil War and the first observance of Memorial Day.

Given information:
- Memorial Day was first marked on May 30, 1868.
- The query asks about the event that occurred three years before the first observance of Memorial Day.

Step 1: Determine the year the Civil War ended.
The Civil War ended in 1865.

Step 2: Calculate the number of years between the end of the Civil War and the first observance of Memorial Day.
Number of years = 1868 - 1865 = 3 years

Therefore, the placeholder in the query should be filled with "Civil War".

Final answer: The Civil War.
