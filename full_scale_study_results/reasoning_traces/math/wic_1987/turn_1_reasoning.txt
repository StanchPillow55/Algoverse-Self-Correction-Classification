==================================================

To determine if the word 'fall' is used with the same meaning in both sentences, we need to analyze the context and the meaning of the word in each sentence.

Sentence 1: "The hills around here fall towards the ocean."
In this sentence, the word 'fall' is used to describe the physical movement or inclination of the hills towards the ocean. It suggests that the hills have a downward slope or gradient.

Sentence 2: "Her weight fell to under a hundred pounds."
In this sentence, the word 'fall' is used to describe a decrease or reduction in the person's weight. It suggests that the person's weight has decreased to a value below a hundred pounds.

By comparing the two usages of the word 'fall', we can see that they have different meanings:

1. In the first sentence, 'fall' is used to describe a physical, spatial movement or inclination.
2. In the second sentence, 'fall' is used to describe a decrease or reduction in a numerical value (weight).

Therefore, the word 'fall' is not used with the same meaning in both sentences.

Final answer: No, the word 'fall
