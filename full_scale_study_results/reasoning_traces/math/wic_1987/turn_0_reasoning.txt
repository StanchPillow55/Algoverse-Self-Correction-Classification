==================================================

To determine if the word "fall" is used with the same meaning in both sentences, we need to analyze the context and the meaning of the word in each sentence.

Sentence 1: "The hills around here fall towards the ocean."
In this sentence, the word "fall" is used to describe the physical movement or inclination of the hills towards the ocean. The hills are sloping or descending towards the ocean.

Sentence 2: "Her weight fell to under a hundred pounds."
In this sentence, the word "fell" is used to describe a decrease in the person's weight, from a higher value to a lower value (under a hundred pounds).

Reasoning:
The word "fall" is used in two different contexts in the given sentences:
1. In the first sentence, it refers to the physical movement or inclination of the hills.
2. In the second sentence, it refers to a decrease or reduction in the person's weight.

Therefore, the word "fall" is not used with the same meaning in both sentences. In the first sentence, it describes a physical movement, while in the second sentence, it describes a decrease in a quantity (weight).

Final Answer:
No
