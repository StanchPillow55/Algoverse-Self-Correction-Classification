Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To determine if the word "fall" is used with the same meaning in both sentences, we need to analyze the context and the meaning of the word in each sentence.

Sentence 1: "The hills around here fall towards the ocean."
In this sentence, the word "fall" is used to describe the physical movement or slope of the hills, where they descend or slope downwards towards the ocean.

Sentence 2: "Her weight fell to under a hundred pounds."
In this sentence, the word "fell" is used to describe a decrease in the person's weight, from a higher value to a lower value of under a hundred pounds.

The meaning of the word "fall" in the two sentences is different:
1. In the first sentence, "fall" refers to the physical movement or slope of the hills.
2. In the second sentence, "fell" refers to a decrease in the person's weight.

Therefore, the word "fall" is not used with the same meaning in both sentences.

Final answer: No, the word "fall" is not used with the same meaning in both sentences.
