==================================================

First, we need to calculate how many cups of lemonade Patrick sold in the first four hours and how much money he earned from this.

He sold 15 cups per hour for 4 hours, so he sold 15 cups/hour * 4 hours = <<15*4=60>>60 cups of lemonade.

Each cup was sold for $0.50, so from this he earned 60 cups * $0.50/cup = $<<60*0.5=30>>30.

Next, we need to calculate how many cups of lemonade Patrick sold in the next two hours and how much money he earned from this.

He sold 10 cups per hour for 2 hours, so he sold 10 cups/hour * 2 hours = <<10*2=20>>20 cups of lemonade.

Each cup was sold for $0.60, so from this he earned 20 cups * $0.60/cup = $<<20*0.6=12>>12.

Finally, we add the money he earned in the first four hours to the money he earned in the next two hours to find the total amount of money he earned.

He earned $30 in the first four hours and $12 in the next two hours, so in total he earned $30 + $12 = $<<30+12=42>>42.

Therefore, Patrick earned $42 from selling lemonade for 6 hours.
