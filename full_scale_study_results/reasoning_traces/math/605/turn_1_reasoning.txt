==================================================

To determine how much money Patrick earned from selling lemonade over the 6-hour period, we need to calculate his earnings for each segment of time and then sum them up.

**Step 1: Calculate earnings for the first 4 hours.**

- Patrick sold 15 cups of lemonade per hour for 4 hours.
- The price per cup during this period was $0.50.

First, calculate the total number of cups sold in the first 4 hours:
\[ 15 \, \text{cups/hour} \times 4 \, \text{hours} = 60 \, \text{cups} \]

Next, calculate the total earnings from these 60 cups:
\[ 60 \, \text{cups} \times \$0.50/\text{cup} = \$30.00 \]

**Step 2: Calculate earnings for the next 2 hours.**

- Patrick sold 10 cups of lemonade per hour for 2 hours.
- The price per cup during this period was $0.60.

First, calculate the total number of cups sold in the next 2 hours:
\[ 10 \, \text{cups/hour} \times 2 \, \text{hours} = 20 \, \text{cups} \]

Next, calculate the total earnings from these 20 cups:
\[ 20 \, \text{cups} \times \$0.60/\text{cup} = \$12.00 \]

**Step 3: Calculate total earnings for the entire 6-hour period.**

Add the earnings from the first 4 hours and the next 2 hours:
\[ \$30.00 + \$12.00 = \$42.00 \]

Therefore, Patrick earned a total of \$42.00 from selling lemonade over the 6-hour period.

**Final Answer:**
Patrick earned \$42.00.
