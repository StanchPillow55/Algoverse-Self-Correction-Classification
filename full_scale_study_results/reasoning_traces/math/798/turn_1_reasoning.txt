Question ID: 798
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

Billy's initial hourly rate was $10. After 2 months, he got a raise of $0.50, making his hourly rate $10.50. On his first anniversary, he got another raise of $1.00, making his hourly rate $11.50.

Sally's starting hourly rate is $0.50 more than Billy's starting rate, so her hourly rate is $10 + $0.50 = $10.50.

If both Billy and Sally work 20 hours, Billy will earn 20 * $11.50 = $230, and Sally will earn 20 * $10.50 = $210.

So, Billy will earn $230 - $210 = $20 more than Sally. 

Therefore, Billy will earn $20 more than Sally.
