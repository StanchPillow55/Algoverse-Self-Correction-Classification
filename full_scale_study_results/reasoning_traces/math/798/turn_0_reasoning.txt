==================================================

Billy's initial hourly rate was $10. After 2 months, he received a raise of $0.50, making his hourly rate $10.50. On his first anniversary, he received another raise of $1.00, making his hourly rate $11.50.

Sally's starting salary is $0.50 more per hour than Billy's starting salary, so her hourly rate is $10 + $0.50 = $10.50.

If both Billy and Sally work 20 hours, Billy will earn 20 * $11.50 = $230, and Sally will earn 20 * $10.50 = $210.

Therefore, Billy will earn $230 - $210 = $20 more than Sally.
