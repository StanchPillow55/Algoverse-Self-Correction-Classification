Question ID: 798
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, let's calculate Billy's current hourly rate. He started at $10 per hour, then got a raise of $0.50 per hour after 2 months, and another raise of $1.00 per hour on his first anniversary. So, his current hourly rate is:

$10.00 + $0.50 + $1.00 = $11.50 per hour

Next, let's calculate Sally's starting hourly rate. Her rate is $0.50 more per hour than Billy's starting salary, so her rate is:

$10.00 + $0.50 = $10.50 per hour

Now, let's calculate how much each of them earns for 20 hours of work.

Billy's earnings for 20 hours are:

$11.50 per hour * 20 hours = $230

Sally's earnings for 20 hours are:

$10.50 per hour * 20 hours = $210

Finally, let's calculate how much more Billy earns than Sally for 20 hours of work:

$230 - $210 = $20

So, Billy will earn $20 more than Sally for 20 hours of work.
