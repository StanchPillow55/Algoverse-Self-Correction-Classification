==================================================

To determine if the word "fix" is used with the same meaning in both sentences, we need to analyze the context and the intended meaning of the word in each sentence.

Sentence 1: "Fix breakfast for the guests, please."
In this sentence, the word "fix" is used to mean "prepare" or "make" breakfast for the guests. The intended meaning is to provide or create the breakfast for the guests.

Sentence 2: "That'll fix him good!"
In this sentence, the word "fix" is used to mean "punish" or "deal with" someone in a severe or effective way. The intended meaning is to take some action that will have a significant impact on the person.

Clearly, the word "fix" is not used with the same meaning in both sentences. In the first sentence, it refers to the preparation of food, while in the second sentence, it refers to taking some action to deal with or punish someone.

Therefore, the answer is:
No, the word "fix" is not used with the same meaning in both sentences.
