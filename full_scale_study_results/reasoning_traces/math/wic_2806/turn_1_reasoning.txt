==================================================

To determine if the word 'fix' is used with the same meaning in both sentences, I will analyze the context and usage of the word in each sentence.

Sentence 1: "Fix breakfast for the guests, please."
In this sentence, the word 'fix' is used to mean 'prepare' or 'make' breakfast for the guests. This is a common usage of the word 'fix' in the context of food preparation.

Sentence 2: "That'll fix him good!"
In this sentence, the word 'fix' is used to mean 'punish' or 'deal with' someone in a way that will have a significant impact on them. This is a different meaning of the word 'fix' compared to the first sentence.

Therefore, the word 'fix' is not used with the same meaning in both sentences. In the first sentence, it means 'prepare', while in the second sentence, it means 'punish' or 'deal with'.

Final answer: No, the word 'fix' is not used with the same meaning in both sentences.
