Question ID: wic_2806
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To determine if the word 'fix' is used with the same meaning in both sentences, I will analyze the context and usage of the word in each sentence.

Sentence 1: "Fix breakfast for the guests, please."
In this sentence, the word 'fix' is used to mean 'prepare' or 'make' breakfast for the guests.

Sentence 2: "That'll fix him good!"
In this sentence, the word 'fix' is used to mean 'punish' or 'deal with' someone in a severe or effective way.

Therefore, the word 'fix' is not used with the same meaning in both sentences. In the first sentence, it refers to the preparation of food, while in the second sentence, it refers to the act of punishing or dealing with someone.

Final answer: No, the word 'fix' is not used with the same meaning in both sentences.
