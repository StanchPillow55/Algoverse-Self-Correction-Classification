Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

Jane has already saved $4 per week for 8 weeks. So, the total amount she has saved so far is 4 * 8 = $<<4*8=32>>32.

She wants to save a total of $60. So, she still needs to save 60 - 32 = $<<60-32=28>>28.

Since she saves $4 each week, the number of additional weeks she needs to save is 28 / 4 = <<28/4=7>>7 weeks.

Therefore, Jane needs to save for 7 more weeks to have a total of $60.
