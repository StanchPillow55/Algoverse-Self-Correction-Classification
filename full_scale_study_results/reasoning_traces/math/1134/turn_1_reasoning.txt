Question ID: 1134
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, let's calculate how much money Jane has already saved. She has saved $4 each week for 8 weeks, so she has saved 4*8 = $32.

Next, let's calculate how much more money she needs to save to reach her goal of $60. She needs to save 60-32 = $28 more.

Since Jane saves $4 each week, we can calculate how many more weeks she needs to save by dividing the total amount she needs to save by the amount she saves each week. So, she needs to save for 28/4 = 7 more weeks.

Therefore, Jane needs to save for 7 more weeks to have saved a total of $60.
