Question ID: 1134
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

Jane has already saved $4 per week for 8 weeks, which totals to $4*8 = $32.

She wants to save a total of $60. So, she still needs to save $60 - $32 = $28.

Since she saves $4 each week, it will take her $28 / $4 = 7 more weeks to save the remaining amount.

So, Jane needs to save for 7 more weeks to reach her goal of $60.
