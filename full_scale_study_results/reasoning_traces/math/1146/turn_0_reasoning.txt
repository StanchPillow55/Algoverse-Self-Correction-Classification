First, let's calculate how many rocks Adam can buy with his $100. Since each rock costs $5, we divide $100 by $5 to get the number of rocks. 

100 รท 5 = 20 rocks

So, Adam can buy 20 rocks with his $100.

Next, let's calculate how many rocks Adam sells. Since he only sells 60% of his inventory, we multiply the total number of rocks (20) by 60% (or 0.60 in decimal form).

20 x 0.60 = 12 rocks

So, Adam sells 12 rocks.

Now, let's calculate how much money Adam makes from selling these rocks. Since he sells each rock for $7, we multiply the number of rocks sold (12) by the selling price ($7).

12 x 7 = $84

So, Adam makes $84 from selling rocks.

Finally, let's calculate how much money Adam loses. Since he started with $100 and made $84, we subtract the amount he made from the amount he started with.

100 - 84 = $16

So, Adam loses $16.

Therefore, if Adam invests all his money in the rock stand but only sells 60% of his inventory, he loses $16.
