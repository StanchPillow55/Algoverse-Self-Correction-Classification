==================================================

First, we need to determine how many inches of hair May had cut. We do this by subtracting the final length of her hair from the initial length. 

So, 10 inches (initial length) - 8 inches (final length) = 2 inches (amount cut)

Next, we need to calculate the cost of the haircut. We know that it costs $30 per inch, so we multiply the number of inches cut by the cost per inch.

So, 2 inches * $30/inch = $60

Finally, we add the cost of the color to the cost of the haircut to find the total cost. 

So, $60 (haircut) + $40 (color) = $100

Therefore, May's cut and color cost $100.
