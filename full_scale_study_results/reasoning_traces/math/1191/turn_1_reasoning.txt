Question ID: 1191
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to determine how many inches of hair May had cut. We know her hair started at 10 inches and ended at 8 inches. By subtracting the final length from the initial length, we can find out how many inches were cut. 

10 inches (initial length) - 8 inches (final length) = 2 inches (cut)

Next, we need to calculate the cost of the haircut. We know that it costs $30 per inch. So, we multiply the number of inches cut by the cost per inch.

2 inches * $30/inch = $60

Finally, we add the cost of the color to the cost of the haircut to find the total cost. 

$60 (haircut) + $40 (color) = $100

So, May's cut and color cost $100.
