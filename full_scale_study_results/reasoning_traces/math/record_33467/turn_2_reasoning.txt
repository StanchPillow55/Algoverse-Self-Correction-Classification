Question ID: record_33467
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, I will need to analyze the given information and context to determine the appropriate response.

Given information:
- The passage mentions that the Mahdi Army, a Shia militant group, has a new enemy in the Sunni terror group ISIS.
- The head of the Mahdi Army, Ibrahim al-Jaberi, has agreed to meet the author, but on his own terms.
- Al-Jaberi has recently warned the author and her allies to "take their hands off Iraq".

Based on this information, it seems that the militant leader, al-Jaberi, is taking a firm stance against outside interference in Iraq, particularly from the author and her allies. He is likely unwilling to compromise on this position.

To respond to the query, I will need to consider the context and tone of the passage, as well as the militant leader's recent warning. A suitable response would be one that acknowledges the militant leader's unwillingness to compromise, while also conveying a measured and diplomatic tone.

Possible response:
"It is clear from the passage that the militant leader, Ibrahim al-Jaberi, is taking a resolute stance against outside interference in Iraq.
