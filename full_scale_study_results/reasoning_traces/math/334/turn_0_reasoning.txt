==================================================

To solve this problem, we first need to find out the total number of paintball guns that all four of them have. 

DJ has 8 guns, Nick has 10 guns, RJ has 1 gun, and Richard has 5 guns. 

So, the total number of guns is 8 (DJ's guns) + 10 (Nick's guns) + 1 (RJ's gun) + 5 (Richard's guns) = 24 guns.

Since they want to share their guns equally, we need to divide the total number of guns by the number of people, which is 4 (DJ, Nick, RJ, and Richard).

So, 24 guns รท 4 people = 6 guns per person.

Therefore, if they were to share their guns equally, each of them would have 6 guns.
