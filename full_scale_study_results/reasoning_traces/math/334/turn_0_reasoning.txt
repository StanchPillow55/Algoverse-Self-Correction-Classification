==================================================

To determine how many paintball guns each person would have if they shared their guns equally, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of guns**: We will add up the number of guns each person has.

   - DJ has 8 guns.
   - Nick has 10 guns.
   - RJ has 1 gun.
   - Richard has 5 guns.

   Now, we sum these values:

   \[
   \text{Total guns} = 8 + 10 + 1 + 5
   \]

   Performing the addition step-by-step:

   - First, add DJ's and Nick's guns:
     \[
     8 + 10 = 18
     \]
   - Next, add RJ's guns:
     \[
     18 + 1 = 19
     \]
   - Finally, add Richard's guns:
     \[
     19 + 5 = 24
     \]

   So, the total number of guns is 24.

2. **Determine how many people are sharing the guns**: There are 4 people (Nick, Richard, Jason, and DJ).

3. **Calculate the number of guns each person would get if shared equally**: To find out how many guns each person would have, we divide the total number of guns by the number of people.

   \[
   \text{Guns per person} = \frac{\text{Total guns}}{\text{Number of people}} = \frac{24}{4}
   \]

   Performing the division:

   \[
   \frac{24}{4} = 6
   \]

4. **Final answer**: Each person would have 6 guns if they shared their guns equally.

Thus, the final answer is:

**Each person would have 6 guns.**
