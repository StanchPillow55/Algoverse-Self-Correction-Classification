Question ID: 899
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to find out how many cookies are left after Susan's husband took 4. We do this by subtracting the number of cookies he took from the total number of cookies Susan made:

100 cookies - 4 cookies = 96 cookies

So, there are 96 cookies left.

Next, we need to divide these remaining cookies equally among Susan's 6 nephews. We do this by dividing the number of remaining cookies by the number of nephews:

96 cookies รท 6 nephews = 16 cookies per nephew

So, each of Susan's nephews will get 16 cookies.
