Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to find out how many students are in each group. We do this by dividing the total number of students by the number of groups. 

So, 54 students รท 6 groups = 9 students per group.

Next, we need to find out how many groups of this size we can make if we need 12 groups. 

So, 12 groups x 9 students per group = 108 students needed.

However, we only have 54 students. This means we need to find out how many more groups of 9 students we can form from the remaining students. 

So, 108 students needed - 54 students we have = 54 students needed.

Finally, we divide the number of students needed by the number of students per group to find out how many more groups are needed. 

So, 54 students needed รท 9 students per group = 6 more groups needed.

Therefore, 6 more groups are needed to form 12 groups of equal size.
