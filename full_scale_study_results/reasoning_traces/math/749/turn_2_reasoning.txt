Question ID: 749
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to determine the size of each group. We can do this by dividing the total number of students by the number of groups. 

So, 54 students รท 6 groups = 9 students per group.

Now, if the activity requires 12 groups, we need to determine how many more groups are needed. We can do this by subtracting the current number of groups from the required number of groups.

So, 12 groups - 6 groups = 6 more groups needed.

However, we also need to ensure that these additional groups will have the same number of students as the original groups. To do this, we multiply the number of additional groups by the size of each group.

So, 6 groups x 9 students per group = 54 students.

This means that 54 more students are needed to form 6 more groups of equal size.

In conclusion, 6 more groups are needed to meet the requirement of 12 groups, and 54 more students are needed to ensure that these groups have the same number of students as the original groups.
