Question ID: 749
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to determine the size of each group. We do this by dividing the total number of students by the number of groups. 

So, 54 students รท 6 groups = 9 students per group.

Now, if the activity requires 12 groups, we need to find out how many more groups are needed. We do this by subtracting the current number of groups from the required number of groups.

So, 12 groups - 6 groups = 6 more groups are needed.

However, we also need to ensure that these new groups will have the same number of students as the original groups. To do this, we multiply the number of new groups by the number of students per group.

So, 6 groups x 9 students per group = 54 more students are needed.

In conclusion, to form 12 groups of equal size (9 students per group), 6 more groups are needed, and for these groups to be formed, 54 more students are needed.
