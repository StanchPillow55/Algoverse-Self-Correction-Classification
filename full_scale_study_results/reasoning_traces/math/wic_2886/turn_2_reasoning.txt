Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To determine if the word 'see' is used with the same meaning in both sentences, we need to analyze the context and usage of the word in each sentence.

Sentence 1: "You'll see a lot of cheating in this school."
In this sentence, the word 'see' is used to mean 'observe' or 'witness'. The sentence is suggesting that the reader will observe or witness a lot of cheating occurring in the school.

Sentence 2: "The 1960's saw the rebellion of the younger generation against established traditions."
In this sentence, the word 'see' is used to mean 'experience' or 'witness'. The sentence is suggesting that the 1960's was a time when the rebellion of the younger generation against established traditions was observed or experienced.

Based on the analysis, the word 'see' is not used with the same meaning in both sentences. In the first sentence, it is used to mean 'observe', while in the second sentence, it is used to mean 'experience'.

Therefore, the answer is: No, the word 'see' is not used with the same meaning in both sentences.
