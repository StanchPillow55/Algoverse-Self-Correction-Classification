==================================================

To determine if the word 'see' is used with the same meaning in both sentences, we need to analyze the context and usage of the word in each sentence.

Sentence 1: "You'll see a lot of cheating in this school."
In this sentence, the word 'see' is used in the sense of 'observe' or 'witness'. The meaning is that you will be able to observe or witness a lot of cheating occurring in this school.

Sentence 2: "The 1960's saw the rebellion of the younger generation against established traditions."
In this sentence, the word 'see' is used in the sense of 'experience' or 'witness'. The meaning is that the 1960's was a time when the younger generation rebelled against established traditions.

Based on the analysis, the word 'see' is not used with the same meaning in both sentences. In the first sentence, it is used to mean 'observe', while in the second sentence, it is used to mean 'experience' or 'witness'.

Therefore, the answer is: No, the word 'see' is not used with the same meaning in both sentences.
