Question ID: 19
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we first need to understand what average speed means. Average speed is calculated by dividing the total distance traveled by the total time taken. 

Marissa wants her average speed to be 4 miles per hour for the entire 12-mile trail. This means that she wants to complete the entire trail in 12 miles / 4 miles per hour = 3 hours.

So far, Marissa has spent 1 hour to walk the first 4 miles and another hour to walk the next 2 miles. This means she has spent 2 hours in total and walked 6 miles in total.

Therefore, she has 3 hours - 2 hours = 1 hour left to complete the remaining distance if she wants to maintain an average speed of 4 miles per hour.

The remaining distance she needs to cover is 12 miles - 6 miles = 6 miles.

To cover 6 miles in 1 hour, Marissa needs to walk at a speed of 6 miles / 1 hour = 6 miles per hour.

Therefore, Marissa needs to walk at a speed of 6 miles per hour for the remaining distance to maintain an average speed of 4 miles per hour for the entire trail.
