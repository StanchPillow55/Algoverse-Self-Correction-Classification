Question ID: 19
Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

Marissa has already walked 4 + 2 = 6 miles.

She has 12 - 6 = 6 miles left to walk.

She has already spent 1 + 1 = 2 hours walking.

If she wants her average speed to be 4 miles per hour, she needs to finish the 12-mile trail in 12 / 4 = 3 hours.

Therefore, she has 3 - 2 = 1 hour left to walk the remaining 6 miles.

To walk 6 miles in 1 hour, Marissa needs to walk at a speed of 6 / 1 = 6 miles per hour.

So, Marissa needs to walk at a speed of 6 miles per hour to finish the remaining distance in time for her average speed to be 4 miles per hour.
