Question ID: 19
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

Marissa has already hiked 6 miles in 2 hours. Her average speed so far is 6 miles / 2 hours = 3 miles per hour.

She wants her average speed for the entire 12-mile hike to be 4 miles per hour. To achieve this, she would need to complete the 12 miles in 12 miles / 4 miles per hour = 3 hours.

Since she has already spent 2 hours hiking, she has 3 hours - 2 hours = 1 hour left to complete the remaining distance.

The remaining distance is 12 miles - 6 miles = 6 miles.

Therefore, to achieve an average speed of 4 miles per hour for the entire hike, Marissa needs to walk the remaining 6 miles in 1 hour. This means she needs to walk at a speed of 6 miles per hour.
