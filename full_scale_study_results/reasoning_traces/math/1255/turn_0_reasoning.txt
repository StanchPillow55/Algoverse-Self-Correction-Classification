==================================================

Crista has 20 plants in total. 4 of them need half a cup of water each and 8 of them need 1 cup of water each. 

First, let's calculate the total amount of water needed for these 12 plants. 

For the 4 plants that need half a cup each, the total amount of water needed is 4 * 0.5 = 2 cups of water. 

For the 8 plants that need 1 cup each, the total amount of water needed is 8 * 1 = 8 cups of water. 

So far, Crista needs 2 + 8 = 10 cups of water for 12 of her plants. 

The rest of her plants need a quarter of a cup of water each. To find out how many plants are left, we subtract the number of plants we've already accounted for from the total number of plants: 20 - 12 = 8 plants. 

For these 8 plants that need a quarter of a cup each, the total amount of water needed is 8 * 0.25 = 2 cups of water. 

Adding this to the amount of water needed for the other plants, we find that Crista needs 10 + 2 = 12 cups of water every day for her plants. 

So, the final answer is that Crista needs 12 cups of water every day for her plants.
