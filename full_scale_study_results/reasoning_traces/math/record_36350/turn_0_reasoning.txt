==================================================

To solve this problem, I need to analyze the given passage and determine whether the statement "Both @placeholder and Myers agree that the boom in urban farming for African-Americans is born out of necessity and not just echoing traditions" is true or false.

Given information:
- The passage discusses the HABESHA Gardens, an urban farm in Atlanta, Georgia.
- Cashawn Myers of HABESHA says that urban farming is a way for African-Americans to connect with the earth.
- The passage mentions that the garden serves a greater purpose, as the harvest helps feed some of the neediest members of the neighborhood.

Reasoning:
1. The passage does not mention any specific person or entity referred to as "@placeholder". Therefore, I cannot determine if this person or entity agrees with the statement.
2. However, the passage does provide information about Cashawn Myers' perspective on urban farming for African-Americans.
3. According to the passage, Myers says that urban farming is a way for African-Americans to connect with the earth. This suggests that urban farming is not just about necessity, but also about reconnecting with traditions and the land.
4. The passage also mentions that the HABESHA Gardens
