Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To analyze the given statement, we need to examine the key points made in the passage and determine if the statement accurately reflects the views of both @placeholder and Cashawn Myers.

Given information:
- The passage discusses the urban farming initiative HABESHA Gardens in Atlanta, Georgia.
- Cashawn Myers of HABESHA says that urban farming is a way for African-Americans to connect with the earth.
- The passage mentions that the garden serves an even greater purpose by helping to feed some of the neediest members of the neighborhood.

The statement suggests that both @placeholder and Myers agree that the boom in urban farming for African-Americans is born out of necessity and not just echoing traditions.

Let's break down the statement and analyze it:

1. "Both @placeholder and Myers agree that the boom in urban farming for African-Americans is born out of necessity..."
   - The passage does not explicitly state that the boom in urban farming is born out of necessity. It suggests that the garden serves an important purpose in feeding the local community, but it does not directly attribute the boom to necessity.
   - The passage does not mention the views of @placeholder, so we cannot determine if they agree with this statement.
