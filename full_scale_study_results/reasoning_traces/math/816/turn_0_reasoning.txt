Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to calculate the total cost of the goats. Since each goat costs $500 and John buys 3 goats, we multiply the cost of one goat by the number of goats:

500 * 3 = $1500

Next, we calculate the total cost of the cows. Since each cow costs $1500 and John buys 2 cows, we multiply the cost of one cow by the number of cows:

1500 * 2 = $3000

Finally, we add the total cost of the goats to the total cost of the cows to find out how much money John spent in total:

1500 + 3000 = $4500

So, John spent a total of $4500.
