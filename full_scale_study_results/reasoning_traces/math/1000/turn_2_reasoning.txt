Okay, let's break down this problem step by step:

Given information:
- Doctor Jones is spending 9 hours at the clinic on Monday.
- He has to do rounds to check on 9 inpatients, which takes 20 minutes per inpatient.
- He has 10 appointments, which take 30 minutes each.

Step 1: Calculate the time spent on inpatient rounds.
Time spent on inpatient rounds = 9 inpatients × 20 minutes per inpatient = 180 minutes

Step 2: Calculate the time spent on appointments.
Time spent on appointments = 10 appointments × 30 minutes per appointment = 300 minutes

Step 3: Calculate the total time spent on inpatient rounds and appointments.
Total time spent on inpatient rounds and appointments = Time spent on inpatient rounds + Time spent on appointments
Total time spent on inpatient rounds and appointments = 180 minutes + 300 minutes = 480 minutes

Step 4: Convert the total time spent on inpatient rounds and appointments from minutes to hours.
Total time spent on inpatient rounds an
