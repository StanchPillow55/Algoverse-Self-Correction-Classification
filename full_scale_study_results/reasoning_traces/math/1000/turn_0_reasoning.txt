Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to calculate the total time Doctor Jones will spend on rounds and appointments.

For the rounds, he spends 20 minutes per inpatient. Since he has 9 inpatients, he will spend 20 minutes/inpatient * 9 inpatients = 180 minutes on rounds.

For the appointments, he spends 30 minutes per appointment. Since he has 10 appointments, he will spend 30 minutes/appointment * 10 appointments = 300 minutes on appointments.

So, in total, Doctor Jones will spend 180 minutes on rounds + 300 minutes on appointments = 480 minutes on rounds and appointments.

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, this is equivalent to 480 minutes รท 60 = 8 hours.

Doctor Jones is spending 9 hours at the clinic, so after rounds and appointments, he will have 9 hours - 8 hours = 1 hour left to update his records.

So, Doctor Jones will have 1 hour left to update his records.
