Question ID: 365
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we know that there are 6 girls in the park. 

The problem states that there are twice the number of boys as there are girls. So, we multiply the number of girls by 2 to find the number of boys: 

6 girls * 2 = 12 boys

To find the total number of kids in the park, we add the number of girls and boys together:

6 girls + 12 boys = 18 kids

So, there are 18 kids in the park.
