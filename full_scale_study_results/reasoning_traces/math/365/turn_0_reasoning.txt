Question ID: 365
Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we know that there are 6 girls in the park. 

The problem states that there are twice the number of boys as there are girls. To find out how many boys there are, we multiply the number of girls by 2. 

So, 6 girls * 2 = 12 boys

Now, to find the total number of kids in the park, we add the number of girls and boys together.

So, 6 girls + 12 boys = 18 kids

Therefore, there are 18 kids in the park.
