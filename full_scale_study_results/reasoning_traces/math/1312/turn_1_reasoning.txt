==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total revenue Tom's restaurant makes in a week based on the given information. Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Determine the revenue per reservation:**
   - Each reservation consists of 2 meals and a bottle of wine.
   - Each meal costs $5, so 2 meals cost: 
     \[
     2 \times 5 = 10 \text{ dollars}
     \]
   - The bottle of wine costs $5.
   - Therefore, the total cost for one reservation is:
     \[
     10 + 5 = 15 \text{ dollars}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total revenue per night:**
   - The restaurant gets 6 reservations per night.
   - Therefore, the total revenue per night is:
     \[
     6 \times 15 = 90 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total revenue per week:**
   - The restaurant is open 2 days a week.
   - Therefore, the total revenue per week is:
     \[
     2 \times 90 = 180 \text{ dollars}
     \]

Thus, the total revenue Tom's restaurant makes in a week is \(\boxed{180}\) dollars.
