Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, let's calculate the total cost of the items Dora wants to buy. 

The skipping rope costs $6, the board game costs $11, and the playground ball costs $2. 

So, the total cost of the items is $6 + $11 + $2 = $19.

Next, let's calculate how much money Dora has. 

She has saved $2 from her allowance, and her mother gave her $16. 

So, Dora has $2 + $16 = $18.

Now, let's calculate how much more money Dora needs. 

She needs $19 (the total cost of the items) - $18 (the money she has) = $1.

So, Dora needs $1 more to buy the skipping rope, the game, and the ball. 

Therefore, the final answer is $1.
