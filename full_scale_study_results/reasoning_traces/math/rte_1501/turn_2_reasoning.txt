Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To determine whether the given premise entails the hypothesis, we need to analyze the logical relationship between the two statements.

Premise: ASCAP is a membership association of more than 200,000 U.S. composers, songwriters, lyricists and music publishers of every kind of music.

Hypothesis: More than 200,000 U.S. composers, songwriters, lyricists and music publishers are members of ASCAP.

Reasoning:

1. The premise states that ASCAP is a membership association of more than 200,000 U.S. composers, songwriters, lyricists, and music publishers.
2. The hypothesis states that more than 200,000 U.S. composers, songwriters, lyricists, and music publishers are members of ASCAP.
3. The premise and the hypothesis are logically equivalent statements. They both convey the same information, just phrased differently.
4. If the premise is true, then the hypothesis must also be true, as they are essentially the same statement.

Therefore, the premise entails the hypothesis.

Final answer: Yes, the premise entails the hypothesis.
