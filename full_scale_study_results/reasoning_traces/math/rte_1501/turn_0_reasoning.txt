==================================================

To determine whether the premise entails the hypothesis, we need to analyze the information provided and apply logical reasoning.

Given information:
- Premise: ASCAP is a membership association of more than 200,000 U.S. composers, songwriters, lyricists, and music publishers.
- Hypothesis: More than 200,000 U.S. composers, songwriters, lyricists, and music publishers are members of ASCAP.

Reasoning:
1. The premise states that ASCAP is a membership association of "more than 200,000 U.S. composers, songwriters, lyricists and music publishers."
2. This means that the number of U.S. composers, songwriters, lyricists, and music publishers who are members of ASCAP is greater than 200,000.
3. The hypothesis states that "More than 200,000 U.S. composers, songwriters, lyricists and music publishers are members of ASCAP."
4. The hypothesis is a direct restatement of the information provided in the premise.

Therefore, the premise entails the hypothesis.

Final answer:
Yes, the premise
