To determine whether the given premise entails the hypothesis, we need to analyze the logical relationship between the two statements.

Premise: ASCAP is a membership association of more than 200,000 U.S. composers, songwriters, lyricists and music publishers of every kind of music.

Hypothesis: More than 200,000 U.S. composers, songwriters, lyricists and music publishers are members of ASCAP.

Let's break down the reasoning step by step:

1. The premise states that ASCAP is a membership association of more than 200,000 U.S. composers, songwriters, lyricists, and music publishers.
2. The hypothesis states that more than 200,000 U.S. composers, songwriters, lyricists, and music publishers are members of ASCAP.
3. The key difference between the premise and the hypothesis is the direction of the statement.
   - The premise states that ASCAP has more than 200,000 members, which implies that the number of members is greater than 200,000.
   - The hypothesis states that more than 200,000 U.S. composers
