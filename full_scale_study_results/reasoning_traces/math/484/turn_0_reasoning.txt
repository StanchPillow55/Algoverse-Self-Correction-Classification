Dataset Type: math
==================================================

The first step is to determine the number of oranges that Stetson ate. We know that he ate 2/5 of the total number of oranges they picked. 

To find this, we multiply the total number of oranges by 2/5:

60 oranges * 2/5 = 24 oranges

So, Stetson ate 24 oranges.

Next, we need to calculate the total amount of money Stetson gave up. We know that he gave up $10 for each orange he ate. 

To find this, we multiply the number of oranges he ate by $10:

24 oranges * $10/orange = $240

So, Stetson gave up $240. 

Therefore, the total amount of money Stetson gave up is $240.
