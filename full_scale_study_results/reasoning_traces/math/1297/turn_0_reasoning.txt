Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to calculate the cost of the ingredients for one jar of the mixture.

The cost of the passion fruit for one jar is 2 pounds * $6/pound = $12.
The cost of the jackfruit for one jar is 1.5 pounds * $8/pound = $12.
The cost of the honey for one jar is 2 pounds * $10/pound = $20.

So, the total cost of the ingredients for one jar is $12 (passion fruit) + $12 (jackfruit) + $20 (honey) = $44.

Since Tim sells each jar for $50, his profit for one jar is the selling price - cost price = $50 - $44 = $6.

Therefore, if he sells 10 jars, his total profit would be 10 jars * $6/jar = $60.

So, Tim makes a profit of $60 selling 10 jars of his special honey and jam mix.
