==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to understand the mechanism by which the skin helps maintain a constant body temperature.

Given information:
- The skin has the main function of controlling what enters and leaves the body.
- The skin prevents the loss of too much water from the body.
- The skin helps maintain a constant body temperature.
- The skin keeps the body cool in two ways:
  1. Sweat from sweat glands in the skin evaporates to cool the body.
  2. Blood vessels in the skin dilate, or widen, which increases blood flow to the body surface, allowing more heat to reach the surface and then radiate off the body.
- The opposite happens to retain body heat:
  1. Blood vessels in the skin constrict, or narrow, which decreases blood flow to the body surface, reducing the amount of heat that reaches the surface.
  2. This reduces the amount of heat that can be lost to the air.

Reasoning:
When heat reaches the surface of the skin, it is not trapped within the body by the sweat glands. Instead, the heat is able to radiate off the body surface.

The key point is that
