To solve this problem, we need to understand the mechanisms by which the skin helps maintain a constant body temperature.

According to the given paragraph, the skin has two main ways of keeping the body cool:

1. Sweat from sweat glands in the skin evaporates to cool the body.
2. Blood vessels in the skin dilate, or widen, which increases blood flow to the body surface. This allows more heat to reach the surface, and the heat is then able to radiate off the body.

The question asks what happens when the heat reaches the surface of the skin. The paragraph states that the opposite happens to retain body heat:

"The opposite happens to retain body heat. Blood vessels in the skin constrict, or narrow. This decreases blood flow to the body surface. This reduces the amount of heat that reaches the surface. When this happens, less heat can be lost to the air."

Therefore, the correct answer is that when the heat reaches the surface of the skin, it is trapped within the body by the constriction of the blood vessels in the skin.

The reasoning can be summarized as follows:

1. The skin has two main ways of keeping the body cool: ev
