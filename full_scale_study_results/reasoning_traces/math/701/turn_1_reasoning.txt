Question ID: 701
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of drinks and snacks purchased by Aiden and his friends, and then calculate the total cost based on the given price per item.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Determine the Total Number of People:**
   - Aiden and his 12 friends are going to the cinema. This makes a total of \(1 + 12 = 13\) people.
   - They meet up with 7 more friends at the cinema. Therefore, the total number of people is:
     \[
     13 + 7 = 20
     \]
   - So, there are 20 people in total.

2. **Calculate the Total Number of Seats:**
   - Since each person saves a seat for themselves, the total number of seats is equal to the total number of people:
     \[
     20 \text{ seats}
     \]

3. **Determine the Total Number of Drinks and Snacks:**
   - Each seat can hold 2 drinks and 3 snacks.
   - Therefore, for 20 seats, the total number of drinks is:
     \[
     20 \times 2 = 40 \text{ drinks}
     \]
   - Similarly, the total number of snacks is:
     \[
     20 \times 3 = 60 \text{ snacks}
     \]

4. **Calculate the Total Cost:**
   - Each drink costs $2, so the total cost for drinks is:
     \[
     40 \times 2 = 80 \text{ dollars}
     \]
   - Each snack also costs $2, so the total cost for snacks is:
     \[
     60 \times 2 = 120 \text{ dollars}
     \]

5. **Calculate the Overall Total Cost:**
   - The overall total cost for both drinks and snacks is:
     \[
     80 + 120 = 200 \text{ dollars}
     \]

### Final Answer:
The group has spent a total of \(\boxed{200}\) dollars on snacks and drinks.
