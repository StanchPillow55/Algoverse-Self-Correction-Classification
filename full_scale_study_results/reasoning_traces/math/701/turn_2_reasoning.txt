Question ID: 701
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of drinks and snacks purchased by Aiden and his friends, and then calculate the total cost based on the given price per item.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of people in the group.**

- Aiden and 12 of his friends: \(1 + 12 = 13\) people.
- They meet up with 7 more friends at the cinema: \(13 + 7 = 20\) people in total.

**Step 2: Determine the number of seats needed.**

Since each person needs a seat, the number of seats required is equal to the number of people, which is 20.

**Step 3: Calculate the total number of drinks and snacks.**

Each seat can hold:
- 2 drinks
- 3 snacks

Since there are 20 seats, the total number of drinks and snacks is calculated as follows:

- Total drinks: \(20 \text{ seats} \times 2 \text{ drinks per seat} = 40 \text{ drinks}\)
- Total snacks: \(20 \text{ seats} \times 3 \text{ snacks per seat} = 60 \text{ snacks}\)

**Step 4: Calculate the total cost.**

The cost of each drink and each snack is $2. Therefore, the total cost can be calculated by adding the cost of all drinks and snacks:

- Cost of drinks: \(40 \text{ drinks} \times 2 \text{ dollars per drink} = 80 \text{ dollars}\)
- Cost of snacks: \(60 \text{ snacks} \times 2 \text{ dollars per snack} = 120 \text{ dollars}\)

Add these amounts to find the total cost:

\[80 \text{ dollars (drinks)} + 120 \text{ dollars (snacks)} = 200 \text{ dollars}\]

**Final Answer:**

The group has spent a total of $200 on snacks and drinks.
