Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, let's find out how many people are going to the cinema. We know that Aiden and 12 of his friends are going, and they're meeting up with 7 more friends there. So, the total number of people is 1 (Aiden) + 12 (his friends) + 7 (more friends) = 20 people.

Next, we need to find out how many drinks and snacks they're buying. Each person is saving a seat, and each seat can hold two drinks and three snacks. So, for 20 people, they're buying 20 * 2 = 40 drinks and 20 * 3 = 60 snacks.

Now, we know that each drink and each snack costs $2. So, the total cost of the drinks is 40 * $2 = $80, and the total cost of the snacks is 60 * $2 = $120.

Finally, we add the cost of the drinks and the snacks to find the total cost. So, the total cost is $80 (drinks) + $120 (snacks) = $200.

Therefore, the group has spent $200 overall on snacks and drinks.
