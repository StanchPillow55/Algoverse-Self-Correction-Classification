==================================================

Carl ate a sandwich every day this week for lunch. Since there are 7 days in a week and he used 2 slices of cheese on each sandwich, he used 7 * 2 = 14 slices of cheese for his sandwiches.

He ate cheese and egg omelets for breakfast 3 days in the week using one more slice per omelet than he did per sandwich. Since he used 2 slices of cheese per sandwich, he used 2 + 1 = 3 slices of cheese per omelet. Therefore, he used 3 * 3 = 9 slices of cheese for his omelets.

He made a big dish of macaroni and cheese to last him several dinners for the week and used 8 slices of cheese in it.

To find the total number of slices of cheese he used, we add the number of slices he used for his sandwiches, omelets, and macaroni and cheese together. This gives us 14 + 9 + 8 = 31 slices of cheese.

Therefore, Carl used 31 slices of cheese.
