Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, let's find out how many girls and boys are on varsity.

One-third of the girls are on varsity. To find this, we multiply the total number of girls by 1/3:

12 girls * 1/3 = 4 girls

So, 4 girls are on varsity.

One-fourth of the boys are on varsity. To find this, we multiply the total number of boys by 1/4:

12 boys * 1/4 = 3 boys

So, 3 boys are on varsity.

Now, let's find out how many students are not on varsity.

To do this, we subtract the number of students on varsity from the total number of students.

The total number of students is the sum of the number of boys and girls, which is 12 boys + 12 girls = 24 students.

The total number of students on varsity is the sum of the number of boys and girls on varsity, which is 4 girls + 3 boys = 7 students.

So, the number of students not on varsity is the total number of students minus the number of students on varsity:

24 students - 7 students = 17 students

So, 17 students are not on varsity.
