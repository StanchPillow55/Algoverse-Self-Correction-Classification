==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given passage and the query to determine the appropriate response.

Given information:
- The passage discusses how the Monica Lewinsky scandal involving Bill Clinton has become a political issue for Hillary Clinton's potential 2016 presidential run.
- Senator Rand Paul has invoked the Lewinsky scandal when discussing Hillary Clinton's potential run.
- The query asks whether Rand Paul believes that Bill Clinton's past should be a consideration in Hillary Clinton's potential second presidential bid.

Reasoning:
1. The passage indicates that the Lewinsky scandal is being used as "fodder" for Hillary Clinton's political foes, including Rand Paul.
2. In the query, Rand Paul is quoted as saying that it's "hard to separate one from the other," suggesting that he believes Bill Clinton's past could be a consideration in Hillary Clinton's potential run.
3. However, the query also states that Rand Paul said he's "not saying that," which implies that he may not directly believe that Bill Clinton's past should be a consideration, but rather that it is a difficult issue to separate.

Final answer:
Based on the information provided in the passage and the query,
