Question ID: 48
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to convert the length of the wire from feet to inches because the pieces of wire are measured in inches. We know that 1 foot is equal to 12 inches. 

So, we multiply the length of the wire in feet by 12 to get the length in inches:

4 feet * 12 inches/foot = 48 inches

Next, we divide the total length of the wire in inches by the length of each piece to find out how many pieces Tracy can cut:

48 inches รท 6 inches/piece = 8 pieces

So, Tracy can cut the wire into 8 pieces.
