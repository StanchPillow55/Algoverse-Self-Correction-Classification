Question ID: 48
Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to convert the length of the wire from feet to inches because the pieces of wire are measured in inches. We know that 1 foot is equal to 12 inches.

So, 4 feet = 4 * 12 inches = 48 inches.

Then, we divide the total length of the wire in inches by the length of each piece to find out how many pieces Tracy obtained.

So, 48 inches รท 6 inches/piece = 8 pieces.

Therefore, Tracy obtained 8 pieces of wire.
