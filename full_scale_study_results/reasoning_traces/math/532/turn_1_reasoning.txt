Question ID: 532
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

Let's denote Jame's current age as J and his cousin's current age as C.

From the problem, we know that Jame will turn 27 in 5 years. This means that his current age is 27 - 5 = 22 years old. So, J = 22.

The problem also tells us that in 8 years, his cousin will be 5 years younger than twice his age. We can express this as an equation: C + 8 = 2 * (J + 8) - 5.

We know that J = 22, so we can substitute this into the equation to solve for C:

C + 8 = 2 * (22 + 8) - 5
C + 8 = 2 * 30 - 5
C + 8 = 60 - 5
C + 8 = 55
C = 55 - 8
C = 47

So, Jame's cousin is currently 47 years old.

To find out how many years separate the age of the two now, we subtract the younger person's age from the older person's age: 47 - 22 = 25 years.

So, there are 25 years between Jame and his cousin.
