Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

Let's denote Jame's current age as J and his cousin's current age as C.

From the problem, we know that Jame will be 27 in 5 years. So, we can write this as:

J + 5 = 27

Solving for J, we get:

J = 27 - 5 = 22 years old

In 8 years, Jame will be 22 + 8 = 30 years old.

The problem also tells us that in 8 years, his cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age. We can write this as:

C + 8 = 2*(J + 8) - 5

Substituting J = 22 into the equation, we get:

C + 8 = 2*(22 + 8) - 5

Solving for C, we get:

C = 2*30 - 5 - 8 = 60 - 5 - 8 = 47 years old

So, the age difference between Jame and his cousin right now is:

C - J = 47 - 22 = 25 years

Therefore, Jame's cousin is 25 years older than him.
