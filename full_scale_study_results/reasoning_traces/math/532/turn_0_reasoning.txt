==================================================

Let's denote Jame's current age as J and his cousin's current age as C.

From the problem, we know that Jame will be 27 in 5 years, so his current age is 27 - 5 = 22 years old. So, J = 22.

The problem also states that in 8 years, Jame's cousin will be 5 years younger than twice Jame's age. In 8 years, Jame will be 22 + 8 = 30 years old. Twice Jame's age in 8 years will be 2 * 30 = 60 years old. So, Jame's cousin will be 60 - 5 = 55 years old in 8 years.

Therefore, his cousin's current age is 55 - 8 = 47 years old. So, C = 47.

The difference in age between Jame and his cousin is C - J = 47 - 22 = 25 years.

So, Jame and his cousin are 25 years apart in age.
