==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to understand how buying only what you need can help avoid resource waste.

Given information:
- If you buy a gallon of milk but can only drink half of it before it spoils, you will be wasting the other half.
- Instead, you should buy a half-gallon of milk and drink all of it, avoiding waste.

Reasoning:
1. When you buy a gallon of milk, but can only drink half of it before it spoils, the other half of the milk goes to waste.
2. This means that the resources used to produce, package, and transport the entire gallon of milk are being wasted, as only half of the milk is actually consumed.
3. By buying a half-gallon of milk instead, you are only using the resources necessary to produce, package, and transport the amount of milk you will actually consume.
4. This reduces the overall resource use and waste, as you are not buying and discarding the unused portion of the milk.

Calculation:
Let's assume the following:
- 1 gallon of milk = 4 liters
- You can only drink 2 liters of
