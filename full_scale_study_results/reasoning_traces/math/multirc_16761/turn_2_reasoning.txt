Dataset Type: math
==================================================

Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

The key information from the paragraph is:
- Buying only what you need can help reduce resource waste
- Example given is buying a half gallon of milk instead of a full gallon if you can only drink half of it before it spoils

The reasoning is:
1) If you buy a full gallon of milk, but can only drink half of it before it spoils, the other half will go to waste.
2) This wastes resources (the milk that gets thrown out) and money (you paid for milk that you didn't use).
3) By buying a half gallon instead, you only buy what you need and can consume all of it, avoiding waste.

Therefore, the final answer is:
Buying only what you need, such as a half gallon of milk instead of a full gallon if you can't consume the full amount, helps avoid resource waste.
