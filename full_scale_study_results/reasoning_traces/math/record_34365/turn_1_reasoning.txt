Question ID: record_34365
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to find the missing word in the given query.

Given information:
- The passage discusses a woman, Caroline Jamieson, who wrote a letter to President Obama about her husband, Herv√© Fonkou Takoulo, facing deportation to his native Cameroon.
- After Jamieson wrote the letter, ICE officers arrested Takoulo and he was in jail for two weeks.
- Takoulo was released when the case started attracting media attention.
- The query states that there was no explanation offered for his release, but "@placeholder is now wearing an electronic ankle monitor while his case is being reviewed."

To find the missing word in the query, we need to determine the most appropriate word that fits the context.

Based on the information provided in the passage, the most likely word to replace "@placeholder" is "Takoulo" or "he".

The complete query with the missing word filled in would be:

"There was no explanation offered for his release, but Takoulo is now wearing an electronic ankle monitor while his case is being reviewed."

Therefore, the final answer is:

Takoulo
