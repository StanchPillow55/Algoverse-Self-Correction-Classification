==================================================

First, let's find out how much the second package of fireworks costs. Since it's worth twice as much as the first package, we multiply the cost of the first package by 2:

$400 * 2 = $800

So the second package of fireworks costs $800.

Next, let's find out how much Tim spent on the two packages of fireworks before the discount. We add the cost of the first package to the cost of the second package:

$400 + $800 = $1200

So before the discount, the two packages of fireworks cost $1200.

Now let's find out how much the discount is. Since Tim gets a 20% discount, we multiply the total cost of the fireworks by 20% (or 0.20):

$1200 * 0.20 = $240

So the discount is $240.

Now let's find out how much Tim spent on the two packages of fireworks after the discount. We subtract the discount from the total cost of the fireworks:

$1200 - $240 = $960

So after the discount, the two packages of fireworks cost $960.

Finally, let's find out how much Tim spent in total. We add the cost of the finale firework to the cost of the two packages of fireworks:

$960 + $150 = $1110

So in total, Tim spent $1110.
