==================================================

Let's denote the amount of water in the small pool 4 minutes ago as x (in gallons). Therefore, the amount of water in the big pool 4 minutes ago was 2x.

Given that both pools are leaking at a rate of 4 gallons per minute, after 4 minutes, the small pool will have lost 4*4 = 16 gallons of water, and the big pool will have lost the same amount.

So, the amount of water in the small pool now is x - 16, and the amount of water in the big pool now is 2x - 16.

According to the problem, the big pool now has four times as much water as the small pool. This gives us the equation:

2x - 16 = 4(x - 16)

Solving this equation will give us the value of x, which represents the amount of water in the small pool 4 minutes ago.

2x - 16 = 4x - 64

64 - 16 = 4x - 2x

48 = 2x

x = 48 / 2

x = 24 gallons

So, the small pool had 24 gallons of water 4 minutes ago. Now, after losing 16 gallons of water, the small pool has:

24 - 16 = 8 gallons

So, the small pool now has 8 gallons of water.
