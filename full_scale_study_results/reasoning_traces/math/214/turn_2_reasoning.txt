==================================================

Let's denote the current amount of water in the small pool as S (in gallons), and the current amount of water in the big pool as B (in gallons). 

From the problem, we know that the big pool now has four times as much water as the small pool. So we can write this as:

B = 4S ...(Equation 1)

We also know that both pools are losing water at the same rate of 4 gallons per minute. Therefore, 4 minutes ago, the big pool had B + 4*4 = B + 16 gallons of water and the small pool had S + 4*4 = S + 16 gallons of water.

From the problem, we also know that 4 minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool. So we can write this as:

B + 16 = 2(S + 16) ...(Equation 2)

Now we can solve these two equations simultaneously. 

Substitute Equation 1 into Equation 2:

4S + 16 = 2S + 32

Simplify the equation:

2S = 16

Solve for S:

S = 8 gallons

Substitute S = 8 into Equation 1:

B = 4*8 = 32 gallons

So, the small pool currently has 8 gallons of water.
