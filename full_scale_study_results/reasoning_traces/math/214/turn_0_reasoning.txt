==================================================

Let's denote the amount of water in the small pool 4 minutes ago as x (in gallons). Therefore, the big pool had 2x gallons of water 4 minutes ago.

Since both pools are leaking at a rate of 4 gallons per minute, after 4 minutes, the small pool will have lost 4*4 = 16 gallons of water, and the big pool will have also lost 16 gallons of water.

So, the amount of water in the small pool now is x - 16 gallons, and the amount of water in the big pool now is 2x - 16 gallons.

According to the problem, the big pool now has four times as much water as the small pool. We can write this as an equation:

2x - 16 = 4(x - 16)

Solving this equation for x gives:

2x - 16 = 4x - 64
64 - 16 = 4x - 2x
48 = 2x
x = 24

So, the small pool had 24 gallons of water 4 minutes ago. Now, it has 24 - 16 = 8 gallons of water.

Therefore, the small pool now has 8 gallons of water.
