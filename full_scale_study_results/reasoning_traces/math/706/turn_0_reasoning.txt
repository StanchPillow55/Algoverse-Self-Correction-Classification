Question ID: 706
Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

The firefighters have raised $2100 in the first 3 hours. This means they are raising $2100/3 = $700 per hour.

Their goal is to raise $6300. If they are raising $700 per hour, then they will need $6300/$700 = 9 hours in total to reach their goal.

However, they have already fundraised for 3 hours. So, they need 9 - 3 = 6 more hours to reach their goal.

Therefore, the firefighters have to fundraise for a total of 9 hours to reach their goal.
