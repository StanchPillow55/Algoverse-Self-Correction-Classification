Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, let's calculate the total number of diapers used per day. Since each child requires 5 diaper changes per day and Jordan has 2 children, the total number of diapers used per day is 5 diapers/child * 2 children = 10 diapers/day.

Next, since Jordan's wife changes half of the diapers, Jordan also changes half of the diapers. Therefore, the number of diapers Jordan changes per day is 10 diapers/day * 0.5 = 5 diapers/day.

So, Jordan changes 5 diapers per day.
