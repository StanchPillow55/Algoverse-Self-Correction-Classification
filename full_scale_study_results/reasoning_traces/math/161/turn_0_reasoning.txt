==================================================

First, let's calculate the total number of fish that Anakin caught. He caught 10 starfish, 6 sea horses, and 3 clownfish. 

10 starfish + 6 sea horses + 3 clownfish = 19 fish

Next, let's calculate the total number of fish that Locsin caught. He caught 5 fewer starfish than Anakin, 3 fewer sea horses than Anakin, and 2 more clownfish than Anakin. 

Starfish: Anakin's 10 - 5 = 5 starfish
Sea horses: Anakin's 6 - 3 = 3 sea horses
Clownfish: Anakin's 3 + 2 = 5 clownfish

5 starfish + 3 sea horses + 5 clownfish = 13 fish

Finally, let's add the total number of fish that Anakin and Locsin caught to find the total number of fish they caught together.

Anakin's 19 fish + Locsin's 13 fish = 32 fish

So, Anakin and Locsin were able to catch a total of 32 fish.
