Question ID: 318
Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, let's start by identifying the number of boys in the classroom. The problem states that there are 30 boys.

Next, we can find out the number of girls. The problem states that there are 3 times as many girls as boys. So, we multiply the number of boys by 3:

30 boys * 3 = 90 girls

Then, we can find out the number of non-gendered children. The problem states that there are 1/10 as many non-gendered children as boys. So, we divide the number of boys by 10:

30 boys / 10 = 3 non-gendered children

Finally, we add up the number of boys, girls, and non-gendered children to find the total number of children in the classroom:

30 boys + 90 girls + 3 non-gendered children = 123 children

So, the classroom has 123 children in total.
