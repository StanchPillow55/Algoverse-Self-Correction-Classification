==================================================

To solve this problem, I will need to analyze the given passage and determine the appropriate placeholder to fill in the query.

The passage discusses the results of the 2010 midterm elections, where the Republican Party gained a majority in the House of Representatives, picking up more than 60 seats. It mentions that this outcome was comparable to the "Republican Revolution" of 1994, when the GOP took 54 seats from the Democrats.

The query asks about a group that has "boosted little-known candidates to victory in primaries over mainstream figures across the country." Based on the context of the passage, the most likely placeholder is "Tea Party".

The passage states that "the surge of Tea Party politics" helped propel the GOP's gains in the 2010 midterm elections. This suggests that the Tea Party movement played a significant role in the election outcomes, including the victory of lesser-known candidates over more established figures.

Therefore, the complete answer to the query is:

The Tea Party has boosted little-known candidates to victory in primaries over mainstream figures across the country.
