Dataset Type: math
==================================================

I apologize, but I do not have enough information to solve this problem. The passage provided does not mention anything about the "Tea Party" boosting little-known candidates to victory in primaries over mainstream figures. The passage discusses the Republican Party gaining control of the House of Representatives in the 2010 midterm elections, but does not go into detail about the role of the Tea Party movement in those elections. Without more specific information about the Tea Party's influence on primary elections, I cannot provide a complete step-by-step solution. I would need additional details about the specific claims being made in order to analyze and solve this problem.
