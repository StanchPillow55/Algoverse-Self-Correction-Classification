==================================================

First, let's find out how many pieces are in the second lego box. It's said that it has 3 times more pieces than the 500 piece one. So, we multiply 500 by 3:

500 * 3 = 1500 pieces

The third lego box has 1/4 the number of pieces of the 500 piece one. So, we divide 500 by 4:

500 / 4 = 125 pieces

Now, we add up all the pieces from the three boxes:

500 (first box) + 1500 (second box) + 125 (third box) = 2125 pieces

So, Johnny picks up 2125 lego pieces from the floor of his room.
