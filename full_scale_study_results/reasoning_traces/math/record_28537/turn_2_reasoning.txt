==================================================

I apologize, but I do not have enough information to solve a specific math problem based on the given passage. The passage discusses diplomatic negotiations between Iran and the P5+1 countries regarding Iran's nuclear program. It does not contain any mathematical information or a specific math problem to solve. Without a clearly defined math problem statement, I cannot provide step-by-step reasoning and calculations. I'd be happy to assist you with a math problem if you can provide one. Please let me know if you have a different question I can try to help with.
