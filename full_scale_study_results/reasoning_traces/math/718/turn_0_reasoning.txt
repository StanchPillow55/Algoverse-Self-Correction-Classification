Dataset Type: math
==================================================

Step 1: Calculate the number of people who receive interviews.

To do this, we multiply the total number of applicants by the percentage of people who receive interviews. 

100 people * 30% = 30 people

So, 30 people receive interviews.

Step 2: Calculate the number of people who receive a job offer.

To do this, we multiply the number of people who receive interviews by the percentage of people who receive a job offer.

30 people * 20% = 6 people

So, 6 people receive a job offer.

Step 3: Calculate the number of people who accept the position.

To do this, we multiply the number of people who receive a job offer by the percentage of people who accept the position. 

6 people * 1/3 = 2 people

So, 2 people accept the position.

Therefore, out of 100 people who apply for a job at Google, 2 people accept the position.
