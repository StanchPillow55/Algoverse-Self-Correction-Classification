Question ID: 478
Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

The total number of employees going on the tour is the number of groups multiplied by the number of employees in each group. 

So, we have 3 groups * 200 employees/group = 600 employees.

Each group was assigned 7 tour guides, so the total number of tour guides is the number of groups multiplied by the number of tour guides per group.

So, we have 3 groups * 7 tour guides/group = 21 tour guides.

The total number of people going on the tour is the sum of the total number of employees and the total number of tour guides.

So, we have 600 employees + 21 tour guides = 621 people.

Therefore, the total number of people going on this tour is 621.
