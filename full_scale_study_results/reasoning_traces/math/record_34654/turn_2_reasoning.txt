Question ID: record_34654
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, I will need to analyze the information provided in the passage and the query, and then use logical reasoning to determine the appropriate response.

Given information:
- The U.S. is considering sending "lethal" weapons, including anti-tank and anti-mortar systems, to the Ukrainian armed forces.
- Critics fear that this move could escalate the U.S.-Russia showdown.
- No one knows how Russian President Vladimir Putin would respond to such a move.
- Since then, @placeholder-backed forces have seized large swathes of territory in eastern Ukraine.

Reasoning:
1. The passage indicates that the U.S. is considering sending lethal weapons to Ukraine to help them in their battle against the separatists, who are being supported by Russia.
2. This move is seen as a potential escalation of the conflict between the U.S. and Russia, as it could be interpreted as the U.S. directly intervening in the conflict.
3. The passage also notes that it is unclear how Putin would respond to such a move, suggesting that it could potentially lead to further escalation and a more direct confrontation between the U.S. and Russia.
