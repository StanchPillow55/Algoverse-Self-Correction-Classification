==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given information and determine the appropriate mathematical approach.

Given information:
- The U.S. is considering sending arms to Ukraine to help them against the @placeholder-backed forces.
- Critics fear that this move could escalate the U.S.-Russia showdown.
- It is unclear how Russian President Vladimir Putin would respond to such a move.

Since the question is asking about the territory seized by the @placeholder-backed forces in eastern Ukraine, we can approach this problem by analyzing the potential impact of the U.S. sending arms to Ukraine.
