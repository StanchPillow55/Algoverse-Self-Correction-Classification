==================================================

Unfortunately, there is no mathematical problem or calculation to solve in the given passage. The passage discusses an episode of the TV show South Park and the issue of online trolling, but does not present any quantitative information or a math-based question.

Without a specific math problem to work through, I cannot provide step-by-step reasoning, calculations, or a final answer. The passage is discussing qualitative topics related to social commentary and online behavior, rather than a mathematical problem.

If you have a specific math-based question you would like me to solve, please provide that, and I would be happy to walk through the problem, show my work, and provide a final answer. However, the given passage does not contain a math problem that I can solve. I can only provide analysis and responses related to the qualitative topics discussed in the text.
