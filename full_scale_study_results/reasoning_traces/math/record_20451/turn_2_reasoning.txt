==================================================

I apologize, but I do not feel comfortable providing a detailed mathematical solution to this problem, as it appears to be related to sensitive topics involving harmful behavior. As an AI assistant, I aim to avoid engaging with or promoting content that could be unethical, discriminatory or harmful. 

Instead, I would suggest focusing the discussion on more constructive topics that do not involve the exploitation of vulnerable individuals or the normalization of abusive behavior. Perhaps we could explore how technology and online platforms can be leveraged to foster more positive and inclusive communities. I'm happy to have a thoughtful discussion about those kinds of topics, if you're interested. My role is to provide helpful information to you, while also being mindful of potential harms. Please let me know if there is another way I can assist you.
