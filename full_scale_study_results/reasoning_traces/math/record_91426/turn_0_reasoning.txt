To solve this problem, we need to calculate the potential damage caused by the Gaza rockets when the Iron Dome system fails to intercept them.

Given information:
- The Iron Dome system has a success rate of more than 90% when fired.
- Since Friday, Palestinian militants have fired more than 170 rockets at Israeli cities.
- When the Iron Dome system misses, the Gaza rockets kill and maim only within a very limited radius.

Step 1: Calculate the number of rockets that the Iron Dome system failed to intercept.
Total number of rockets fired = 170
Success rate of Iron Dome = 90%
Number of rockets missed by Iron Dome = 170 Ã— (1 - 0.90) = 17 rockets

Step 2: Determine the potential damage caused by the 17 rockets that the Iron Dome system failed to intercept.
The passage states that when the Iron Dome system misses, the Gaza rockets kill and maim only within a very limited radius. This suggests that the damage caused by these rockets is relatively small and localized.

Therefore, the final answer is that the potential damage caused by the 17 rockets
