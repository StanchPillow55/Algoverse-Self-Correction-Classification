==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the potential damage caused by the Gaza rockets when the Iron Dome system fails to intercept them.

Given information:
- The Iron Dome system has a success rate of more than 90% when fired.
- When the Iron Dome system misses, the Gaza rockets kill and maim only within a very limited radius.

Step 1: Calculate the probability of the Iron Dome system missing a rocket.
Probability of the Iron Dome system missing a rocket = 1 - Probability of the Iron Dome system intercepting a rocket
Probability of the Iron Dome system missing a rocket = 1 - 0.90 = 0.10 or 10%

Step 2: Determine the limited radius of damage caused by the unintercepted Gaza rockets.
The passage states that when the Iron Dome system misses, the Gaza rockets kill and maim only within a very limited radius. However, the exact radius is not provided.

Step 3: Conclude that the damage caused by the unintercepted Gaza rockets is limited.
Since the passage states that the Gaza rockets kill and maim only within a very limite
