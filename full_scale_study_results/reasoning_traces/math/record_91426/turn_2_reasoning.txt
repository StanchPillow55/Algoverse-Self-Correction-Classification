==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the potential damage caused by the Gaza rockets when the Iron Dome system fails to intercept them.

Given information:
- The Iron Dome system has a success rate of more than 90% when fired.
- When the Iron Dome system misses, the Gaza rockets kill and maim only within a very limited radius.

Step 1: Calculate the probability of the Iron Dome system missing a rocket.
Probability of the Iron Dome system missing a rocket = 1 - Probability of the Iron Dome system intercepting a rocket
Probability of the Iron Dome system missing a rocket = 1 - 0.90 = 0.10 or 10%

Step 2: Estimate the potential damage caused by a Gaza rocket when the Iron Dome system misses.
Since the passage states that the Gaza rockets "kill and maim only within a very limited radius" when the Iron Dome system misses, we can assume that the damage is localized and relatively small in scale.

Without specific data on the blast radius or destructive power of the Gaza rockets, it's difficult to quantify the exact level of damage. However
