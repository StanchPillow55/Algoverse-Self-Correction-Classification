==================================================

First, let's calculate how many pieces of straw are given to the hamsters. Since each hamster is kept alone in a cage and there are 10 cages, there are 10 hamsters. Each hamster is given 5 pieces of straw, so the total number of pieces of straw given to the hamsters is 10 hamsters * 5 pieces of straw/hamster = 50 pieces of straw.

Next, let's calculate how many pieces of straw are given to the rabbits. We know that 20 pieces of straw are distributed among the rabbits.

Now, let's calculate how many pieces of straw are given to the rats. We know that 160 pieces of straw have been distributed among all the small rodents, so the number of pieces of straw given to the rats is 160 pieces of straw - 50 pieces of straw (for the hamsters) - 20 pieces of straw (for the rabbits) = 90 pieces of straw.

Since each rat is given 6 pieces of straw, the total number of rats is 90 pieces of straw / 6 pieces of straw/rat = 15 rats.

Finally, since the rats are kept in 3 cages in equal groups, the number of rats in each cage is 15 rats / 3 cages = 5 rats/cage.

So, there are 5 rats in each cage.
