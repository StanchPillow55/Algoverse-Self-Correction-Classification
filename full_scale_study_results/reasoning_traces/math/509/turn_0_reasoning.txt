==================================================

Given that Rose bought 4 times the number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought, we can set up the following equations:

Let's denote the number of onions Sophia bought as O and the number of potatoes as P.

According to the problem, Rose bought 4 times the number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought. So, we can write the following equations:

4O = 12 (since Rose bought 12 onions)
4P = 4 (since Rose bought 4 potatoes)

To find the number of onions and potatoes Sophia bought, we need to solve these equations for O and P.

Dividing both sides of the first equation by 4, we get:

O = 12 / 4 = 3

So, Sophia bought 3 onions.

Similarly, dividing both sides of the second equation by 4, we get:

P = 4 / 4 = 1

So, Sophia bought 1 potato.

In total, Sophia bought 3 onions + 1 potato = 4 onions and potatoes at the market. 

So, the final answer is 4.
