==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given information and determine the most appropriate answer to the query.

Given information:
- Amazon has launched its own version of the Android Marketplace, which it has labeled the "Appstore."
- Apple has sued Amazon for trademark violation, claiming ownership of the term "App Store."
- In the past, Microsoft has also challenged Apple's trademark on the term "App Store."

The query asks what the move to defend Apple's trademark indicates about Apple's actions.

Reasoning:
1. The fact that Apple has filed a lawsuit against Amazon for using the term "Appstore" suggests that Apple is actively trying to protect its trademark on the term "App Store."
2. Apple's lawsuit indicates that the company is willing to take legal action to prevent other companies from using similar names that could be confused with its own "App Store" brand.
3. This aggressive stance suggests that Apple is likely to continue defending its "App Store" trademark against any perceived challengers, including potential plans by Amazon to expand its Google Android efforts.
4. Apple's actions are likely motivated by a desire to maintain its dominance in the app marketplace and prevent competitors from gaining a foothold in this
