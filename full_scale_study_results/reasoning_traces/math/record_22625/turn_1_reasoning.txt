To solve the query based on the provided passage, we need to analyze the context and implications of Apple's actions regarding its trademark on the phrase "App Store." 

### Step 1: Understand the Context
The passage discusses a legal action taken by Apple against Amazon for trademark violation concerning the name "Appstore." Apple is concerned that Amazon's use of a similar name could confuse consumers and dilute the brand identity of its own App Store.

### Step 2: Identify Key Points
1. **Trademark Protection**: Apple has filed for trademark protection over the phrase "App Store." This indicates that Apple is serious about defending its brand and the associated ecosystem.
2. **Amazon's Launch**: Amazon has launched its own version of an app marketplace, which it has named "Appstore." This could be seen as a direct challenge to Apple's App Store.
3. **Microsoft's Position**: The mention of Microsoft also indicates that there are multiple players in the app marketplace space, and Apple is likely aware of the competitive landscape.

### Step 3: Analyze the Implications
The phrase "will act to aggressively protect its App Store ecosystem from challengers" suggests that Apple is not just defending a name but is also committed to maintaining its market position against competitors like Amazon. This aggressive stance could involve legal actions, marketing strategies, and possibly innovations to keep its App Store appealing to developers and consumers.

### Step 4: Fill in the Placeholder
Given the context, the placeholder in the query can be filled with "Apple." The reasoning is that Apple is the entity taking action to protect its trademark and, by extension, its App Store ecosystem.

### Final Answer
The move to defend Apple's trademark indicates that **Apple** will act to aggressively protect its App Store ecosystem from challengers, which may include any plans Amazon has to expand its Google Android efforts.
