### Step 1: Identify the Subject
The query states, "The move to defend Apple's trademark indicates that @placeholder will act to aggressively protect its App Store ecosystem from challengers." 

From the passage, we know that Apple is the entity that has filed a trademark protection over the phrase "App Store." Therefore, the subject that we need to fill in the placeholder with is "Apple."

The context indicates that Apple is taking steps to protect its brand and ecosystem from potential competition, particularly from Amazon's efforts in the Android marketplace.

### Step 3: Formulate the Final Answer
Given that the subject is Apple, we can fill in the placeholder as follows:

"The move to defend Apple's trademark indicates that **Apple** will act to aggressively protect its App Store ecosystem from challengers, which may include any plans Amazon has to expand its Google Android efforts."
