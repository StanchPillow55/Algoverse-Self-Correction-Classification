==================================================

To determine which group plotted the assassination of Hosni Mubarak, I will carefully analyze the information provided in the paragraph.

The paragraph states:
"The attempted assassination in Ethiopia of Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak in June 1995 appears to have been a tipping point. The would-be killers, who came from the Egyptian Islamic Group, had been sheltered in Sudan and helped by Bin Laden."

Based on this information, the group that plotted the assassination of Hosni Mubarak was the Egyptian Islamic Group, not Libya.

The paragraph mentions that the would-be killers came from the Egyptian Islamic Group, and that they had been sheltered in Sudan and helped by Bin Laden. There is no mention of Libya being involved in the assassination plot.

Therefore, the final answer is:

The Egyptian Islamic Group plotted the assassination of Hosni Mubarak.
