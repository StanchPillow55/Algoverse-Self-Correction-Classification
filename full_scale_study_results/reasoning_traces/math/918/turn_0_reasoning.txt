Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, let's find the total number of students playing tennis and volleyball. 

We know that there are 6 students playing tennis. 

The problem tells us that there are twice as many students playing volleyball as there are playing tennis. So, we multiply the number of tennis players by 2 to find the number of volleyball players: 

6 tennis players * 2 = 12 volleyball players

Next, we add the number of tennis players and volleyball players to find the total number of students in these two groups:

6 tennis players + 12 volleyball players = 18 students

Then, we find the total number of students playing soccer. The problem tells us that there are 16 boys and 22 girls playing soccer. So, we add these two numbers to find the total number of soccer players:

16 boys + 22 girls = 38 soccer players

Finally, we add the number of students in all three groups to find the total number of students:

18 students (tennis and volleyball) + 38 students (soccer) = 56 students

So, there are 56 students in total.
