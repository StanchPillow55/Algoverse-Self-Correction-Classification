Question ID: 193
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to carefully track the number of pink and white plastic flamingos on Sue's front yard over the weekend.

**Step 1: Initial Setup on Friday Morning**

- On Friday morning, the neighbors placed 18 pink plastic flamingos on Sue's front yard.
- At this point, there are 18 pink flamingos and 0 white flamingos.

**Step 2: Changes on Saturday Morning**

- On Saturday morning, the neighbors took back one third of the flamingos, painted them white, and put them back on the yard.
- One third of 18 flamingos is calculated as follows:
  \[
  \frac{1}{3} \times 18 = 6
  \]
- So, 6 pink flamingos were taken, painted white, and then returned to the yard.
- After this change, the yard has:
  - \(18 - 6 = 12\) pink flamingos remaining.
  - \(0 + 6 = 6\) white flamingos.

**Step 3: Changes on Sunday Morning**

- On Sunday morning, the neighbors added another 18 pink flamingos to the collection.
- After adding these flamingos, the yard has:
  - \(12 + 18 = 30\) pink flamingos.
  - The number of white flamingos remains unchanged at 6.

**Step 4: Calculate the Difference**

- At noon on Sunday, we need to find out how many more pink flamingos there are than white flamingos:
  \[
  30 \text{ (pink flamingos)} - 6 \text{ (white flamingos)} = 24
  \]

Therefore, at noon on Sunday, there are 24 more pink plastic flamingos than white plastic flamingos on Sue's front yard.

**Final Answer:**
24 more pink plastic flamingos than white plastic flamingos.
