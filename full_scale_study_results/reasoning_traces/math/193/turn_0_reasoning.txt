==================================================

Let's break down the problem step by step.

On Friday, the neighbors placed 18 pink flamingos on Sue's yard. 

On Saturday, they took back one third of these flamingos. One third of 18 is 18/3 = 6. So, they took back 6 flamingos and painted them white.

This means that on Saturday, there were 18 - 6 = 12 pink flamingos and 6 white flamingos on Sue's yard.

On Sunday, they added another 18 pink flamingos. So, the total number of pink flamingos on Sunday was 12 + 18 = 30.

The number of white flamingos remained the same, which is 6.

Therefore, the number of pink flamingos that were more than the white flamingos on Sue's yard at noon on Sunday is 30 - 6 = 24.

So, there were 24 more pink flamingos than white flamingos on Sue's yard at noon on Sunday.
