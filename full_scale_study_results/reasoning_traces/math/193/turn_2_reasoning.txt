Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to track the number of pink and white plastic flamingos on Sue's front yard over the weekend.

**Step 1: Initial Setup on Friday Morning**
- On Friday morning, the neighbors placed 18 pink plastic flamingos on Sue's front yard.
- At this point, there are 18 pink flamingos and 0 white flamingos.

**Step 2: Changes on Saturday Morning**
- On Saturday morning, the neighbors took back one third of the flamingos to paint them white.
- One third of 18 flamingos is calculated as follows:
  \[
  \frac{1}{3} \times 18 = 6
  \]
- So, 6 flamingos were taken back and painted white.
- These 6 white flamingos were then placed back on the yard.
- After this change, the number of pink flamingos is reduced by 6, and the number of white flamingos is increased by 6.

  Therefore, on Saturday morning:
  - Pink flamingos: \(18 - 6 = 12\)
  - White flamingos: \(0 + 6 = 6\)

**Step 3: Changes on Sunday Morning**
- On Sunday morning, the neighbors added another 18 pink flamingos to the yard.
- This increases the number of pink flamingos by 18.

  Therefore, on Sunday morning:
  - Pink flamingos: \(12 + 18 = 30\)
  - White flamingos remain at 6.

**Step 4: Calculate the Difference at Noon on Sunday**
- We need to find out how many more pink flamingos there are than white flamingos at noon on Sunday.
- The difference is calculated as follows:
  \[
  30 - 6 = 24
  \]

Thus, at noon on Sunday, there are 24 more pink plastic flamingos than white plastic flamingos.

**Final Answer:**
There are 24 more pink plastic flamingos than white plastic flamingos at noon on Sunday.
