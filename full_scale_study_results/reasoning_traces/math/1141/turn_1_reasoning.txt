==================================================

First, we need to calculate how many eggs Chester eats in total over the 60 days. 

For the first 30 days, he eats 3 eggs a day. So, we multiply 30 (days) by 3 (eggs) to find out how many eggs he eats in total during this period. 

30 days * 3 eggs/day = 90 eggs

For the next 30 days, he increases his consumption to 5 eggs a day. So, we multiply 30 (days) by 5 (eggs) to find out how many eggs he eats in total during this period.

30 days * 5 eggs/day = 150 eggs

Now, we add these two totals together to find out how many eggs Chester eats in total over the 60 days.

90 eggs + 150 eggs = 240 eggs

Since a dozen is equal to 12, we divide the total number of eggs by 12 to find out how many dozens of eggs Chester needs.

240 eggs รท 12 = 20 dozens

So, Chester will need 20 dozens of eggs for 60 days.
