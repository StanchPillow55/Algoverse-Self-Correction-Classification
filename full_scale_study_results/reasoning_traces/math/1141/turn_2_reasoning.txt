Question ID: 1141
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to calculate how many eggs Chester eats in total over the 60 days. 

For the first 30 days, he eats 3 eggs a day. So, we multiply 30 (days) by 3 (eggs) to get 90 eggs.

For the next 30 days, he increases his intake to 5 eggs a day. So, we multiply 30 (days) by 5 (eggs) to get 150 eggs.

To find the total number of eggs Chester eats over the 60 days, we add the two amounts together: 90 eggs + 150 eggs = 240 eggs.

Since a dozen is equal to 12, we divide the total number of eggs by 12 to find out how many dozens of eggs Chester needs.

240 eggs รท 12 = 20 dozens.

So, Chester will need 20 dozens of eggs for 60 days.
