Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To determine two characteristics of e-cigarettes that would appeal to smokers who wish to quit, I will analyze the information provided in the paragraph and consider the needs and desires of smokers trying to quit.

Potential Appealing Characteristics:

1. Battery-operated and contain cartridges:
   - This suggests that e-cigarettes are a convenient and portable alternative to traditional cigarettes.
   - Smokers looking to quit may find the ease of use and portability appealing, as it allows them to continue the hand-to-mouth motion and ritual of smoking without the harmful effects of traditional cigarettes.

2. Contain nicotine and other chemicals:
   - The paragraph states that e-cigarettes "contain cartridges filled with nicotine and other chemicals."
   - Nicotine is the addictive substance in traditional cigarettes, and smokers trying to quit may find the presence of nicotine in e-cigarettes appealing, as it can help satisfy their nicotine cravings.
   - However, the presence of "other chemicals" may be a concern, as the FDA has found some of these chemicals to be toxic and carcinogenic.
