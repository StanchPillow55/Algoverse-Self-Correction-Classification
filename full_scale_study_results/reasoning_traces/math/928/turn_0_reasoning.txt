Question ID: 928
Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, let's find out how many Junebugs Rita removed on Tuesday and Wednesday. Since she removed twice as many as she did on Monday, we multiply the number of Junebugs she removed on Monday by 2.

39 Junebugs * 2 = 78 Junebugs

So, Rita removed 78 Junebugs on both Tuesday and Wednesday.

Next, we add up the total number of Junebugs she removed from Monday to Friday.

Monday: 39 Junebugs
Tuesday: 78 Junebugs
Wednesday: 78 Junebugs
Thursday: 48 Junebugs
Friday: 57 Junebugs

Total = 39 + 78 + 78 + 48 + 57 = 300 Junebugs

Finally, to find the average number of Junebugs she removes per day, we divide the total number of Junebugs by the number of days.

300 Junebugs / 5 days = 60 Junebugs/day

So, Rita removes an average of 60 Junebugs per day.
