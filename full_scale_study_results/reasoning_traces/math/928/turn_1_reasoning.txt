Question ID: 928
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To find the average number of Junebugs Rita removes per day, we first need to find the total number of Junebugs she removed throughout the week, and then divide that total by the number of days in the week.

On Monday, Rita removed 39 Junebugs.

On Tuesday and Wednesday, she removed twice as many Junebugs as she did on Monday. So, she removed 2 * 39 = 78 Junebugs each day. Since she did this for two days, the total number of Junebugs she removed on Tuesday and Wednesday is 78 * 2 = 156.

On Thursday, she removed 48 Junebugs, and on Friday, she removed 57 Junebugs.

So, the total number of Junebugs she removed throughout the week is 39 (Monday) + 156 (Tuesday and Wednesday) + 48 (Thursday) + 57 (Friday) = 300 Junebugs.

Since there are 5 days in this period (Monday through Friday), the average number of Junebugs she removes per day is the total number of Junebugs divided by the number of days, which is 300 / 5 = 60.

So, Rita removes an average of 60 Junebugs per day.
