==================================================

First, we need to find out how many fish have red stripes. We know that one-third of the fish have red stripes. So, we calculate:

66 * 1/3 = 22 fish

So, 22 fish have red stripes.

Next, we need to find out how many fish have blue stripes. We know that 5/11 of the remaining fish have blue stripes. First, we need to find out how many fish are remaining after we subtract the fish with red stripes:

66 - 22 = 44 fish

So, 44 fish do not have red stripes. Now, we calculate how many of these fish have blue stripes:

44 * 5/11 = 20 fish

So, 20 fish have blue stripes.

Finally, we add the number of fish with red stripes and the number of fish with blue stripes to find the total number of fish with stripes:

22 + 20 = 42 fish

So, 42 fish have either red stripes or blue stripes.
