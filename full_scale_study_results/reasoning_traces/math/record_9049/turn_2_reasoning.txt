==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to find the location where Bergdahl was handed over to the U.S. military.

Given information:
- Bergdahl was held captive by militants during the Afghanistan war.
- Bergdahl was released in exchange for five Guantanamo detainees.
- The government of Qatar helped broker the release.

Based on the information provided, the location where Bergdahl was handed over to the U.S. military is @placeholder.

Reasoning:
1. The passage states that Bergdahl was released in exchange for five Guantanamo detainees, which implies that the exchange took place outside of the United States.
2. The passage also mentions that the government of Qatar helped broker the release, suggesting that the exchange occurred in Qatar or a location facilitated by Qatar.
3. The passage does not provide any other specific information about the location of the handover, so the most reasonable answer based on the given information is that Bergdahl was handed over to the U.S. military in Qatar.

Therefore, the final answer is:
Bergdahl is now under the care of the U.S.
