==================================================

To solve this problem, I will need to extract the relevant information from the passage and then use it to determine the location where Bergdahl was handed over to the U.S. military.

Given information:
- Bergdahl was held captive for nearly five years by militants during the Afghanistan war.
- Bergdahl was released in exchange for five Guantanamo detainees.
- The government of Qatar helped broker the release.
- Bergdahl is now under the care of the U.S. military after being handed over by his captors.

Based on the information provided, the location where Bergdahl was handed over to the U.S. military is Qatar.

The passage states that the government of Qatar helped broker the release of Bergdahl, and that the five Guantanamo detainees were sent to Qatar. This suggests that the exchange took place in Qatar, and Bergdahl was then handed over to the U.S. military in Qatar.

Therefore, the answer to the query is:
Bergdahl is now under the care of the U.S. military after being handed over by his captors in Qatar.
