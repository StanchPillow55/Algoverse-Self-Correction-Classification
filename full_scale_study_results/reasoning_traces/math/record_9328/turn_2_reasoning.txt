Question ID: record_9328
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1) The passage states that Tottenham scored a goal after a 48-pass move, with Nacer Chadli finishing it off with a header.

2) The passage also mentions that Mauricio Pochettino, the Tottenham manager, is known for encouraging a possession-based style of play.

3) The query asks who the "man of the moment" was in this game, and the passage indicates that Chadli scored twice for Tottenham.

Therefore, the final answer is:

Nacer Chadli was the "man of the moment" in Tottenham's 4-0 victory over QPR, as he scored two goals, including one that came at the end of a 48-pass move, which exemplified Pochettino's preferred possession-based style of play.
