Question ID: record_9328
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Tottenham thrashed QPR 4-0 at White Hart Lane.
- Nacer Chadli scored two goals for Tottenham.
- One of Chadli's goals came after a 48-pass move.
- Mauricio Pochettino prefers a possession-based style of play.

To find the man of the moment, we need to determine which Tottenham player had the most significant contribution to the game.

Since Chadli scored two goals, including one after a lengthy passing sequence, he appears to be the standout performer. The passage highlights Chadli's role in the 48-pass move that led to a goal, indicating he was heavily involved in Tottenham's dominant performance.

Therefore, the man of the moment is Nacer Chadli.

Final answer: Nacer Chadli is the man of the moment.
