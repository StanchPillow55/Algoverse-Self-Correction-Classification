==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to understand the key differences between the South Korean and North Korean rocket launches.

Given information:
- South Korea successfully launched the Naro-1 rocket, putting a satellite in orbit for the first time.
- North Korea had also successfully launched its own rocket last month, defying U.N. resolutions.
- Analysts have said the South Korean launch is different from the North Korean launch.

The key differences between the South Korean and North Korean rocket launches are:

1. Transparency:
   - South Korea's launch was more transparent, with the country providing information and allowing media coverage.
   - North Korea's launch was less transparent, as the country often keeps its space program activities secretive.

2. Civilian applications:
   - South Korea's launch was clearly focused on developing its own civilian space program.
   - North Korea's launch was seen as a cover for testing ballistic missile technology, which is a concern for the international community.

3. Compliance with U.N. sanctions:
   - South Korea's launch did not contravene U.N. sanctions, as it was part of the country's civilian space program.
   - North
