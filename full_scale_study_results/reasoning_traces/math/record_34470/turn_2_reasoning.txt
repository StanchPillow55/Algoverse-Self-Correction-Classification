==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to understand the key differences between the South Korean and North Korean rocket launches.

Given information:
- South Korea successfully launched the Naro-1 rocket, putting a satellite in orbit for the first time.
- North Korea had also successfully launched its own rocket last month, defying U.N. resolutions.
- Analysts have said the South Korean launch is different from the North Korean launch.

The key differences between the South Korean and North Korean rocket launches are:

1. Transparency:
   - The South Korean launch was more transparent, with the government and media providing detailed information about the launch.
   - In contrast, the North Korean launch was less transparent, with limited information provided by the government.

2. Civilian applications:
   - The South Korean launch was clearly focused on civilian applications, such as developing its own civilian space program.
   - The North Korean launch was seen as a cover for developing military technology, such as ballistic missile technology, which contravenes U.N. sanctions.

3. Compliance with U.N. sanctions:
   - The South Korean launch did not contravene U.N. sanctions, as it was focuse
