To solve this problem, we need to understand the key differences between the South Korean and North Korean rocket launches.

Given information:
- South Korea successfully launched the Naro-1 rocket, putting a satellite in orbit for the first time.
- North Korea had also successfully launched its own rocket last month, defying U.N. resolutions.
