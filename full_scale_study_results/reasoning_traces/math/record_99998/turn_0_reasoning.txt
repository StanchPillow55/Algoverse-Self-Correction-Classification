==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to find the value of the placeholder in the given statement.

Given information:
- Esme Poulsom was born four months premature, weighing just 1 lb 6 oz.
- Esme's mother, Kirsty Barrett, was not allowed to see Esme for the first two days after the birth.

The statement mentions that "she was so tiny and for the first couple of days @placeholder brought me pictures because I couldn't see her."

The placeholder in this statement refers to the person who brought Kirsty Barrett pictures of Esme during the first two days when she was not allowed to see her.

Based on the information provided, the most logical answer for the placeholder is "Gareth Poulsom", who is Esme's father.

Therefore, the complete statement would be:

"She was so tiny and for the first couple of days Gareth Poulsom brought me pictures because I couldn't see her."
