Question ID: record_89068
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, I will need to break it down step-by-step:

1. The passage states that the European Union has agreed to list the military wing of Hezbollah as a terrorist organization. This means that Hezbollah's military activities will be designated as terrorist acts.

2. The passage also mentions that a Hezbollah member was found guilty in Cyprus this year of assisting in the planning of an attack on a @placeholder.

3. To answer the question, I need to fill in the @placeholder with the target of the planned attack in Cyprus.

4. However, the passage does not provide the specific target of the planned attack in Cyprus. The passage only states that a Hezbollah member was found guilty of assisting in the planning of an attack on @placeholder.

5. Without the specific information about the target of the planned attack in Cyprus, I do not have enough information to provide a complete answer.

6. The best I can do is state that a Hezbollah member was found guilty in Cyprus this year of assisting in the planning of an attack on an unspecified target.

Final answer: A Hezbollah member was found guilty in Cyprus this year
