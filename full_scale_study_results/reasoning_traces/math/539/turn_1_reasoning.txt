==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine how much you end up paying after splitting the dinner bill evenly with your wife and adding a 20% tip to the total bill.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Calculate the Total Bill with Tip:**
   - The original dinner bill is $50.
   - You need to add a 20% tip to this bill.
   - To find 20% of $50, use the formula for percentage: 
     \[
     \text{Tip} = \frac{20}{100} \times 50 = 0.20 \times 50 = 10
     \]
   - Therefore, the tip amount is $10.

2. **Calculate the Total Amount Including Tip:**
   - Add the tip to the original bill to find the total amount:
     \[
     \text{Total Amount} = 50 + 10 = 60
     \]

3. **Split the Total Amount Evenly:**
   - Since you and your wife are splitting the total amount evenly, divide the total amount by 2:
     \[
     \text{Each Person Pays} = \frac{60}{2} = 30
     \]

4. **Determine Your Total Payment:**
   - Since you are paying for your share of the bill, your total payment is $30.

### Final Answer:
You end up paying $30.
