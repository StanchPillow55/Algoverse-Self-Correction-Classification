Dataset Type: math
==================================================

The first step is to split the dinner bill evenly. The total bill is $50, so each person's share would be $50 / 2 = $25.

Next, we need to calculate the 20% tip. To find this, we multiply the total bill by 20% (or 0.20). So, $50 * 0.20 = $10.

Finally, we add the tip to the amount that I am paying. So, $25 (my share of the bill) + $10 (the tip) = $35.

So, I ended up paying $35 for the dinner.
