Question ID: 539
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine how much you end up paying after splitting the dinner bill evenly with your wife and adding a 20% tip to the total bill.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Determine the Total Bill:**
   - The dinner bill is $50.

2. **Calculate the Tip:**
   - The tip is 20% of the total bill.
   - To find 20% of $50, we use the formula for percentage: 
     \[
     \text{Tip} = \frac{20}{100} \times 50 = 0.20 \times 50 = 10
     \]
   - So, the tip amount is $10.

3. **Calculate the Total Amount Including Tip:**
   - Add the tip to the original bill to find the total amount:
     \[
     \text{Total Amount} = \text{Original Bill} + \text{Tip} = 50 + 10 = 60
     \]
   - The total amount to be paid, including the tip, is $60.

4. **Split the Total Amount Evenly:**
   - Since you and your wife are splitting the total amount evenly, divide the total amount by 2:
     \[
     \text{Each Person's Share} = \frac{60}{2} = 30
     \]
   - Each person is responsible for paying $30.

5. **Determine Your Payment:**
   - Since you are paying your share plus the tip, your total payment is $30.

### Conclusion:

You end up paying $30. This includes your half of the dinner bill and your share of the tip. 

**Final Answer: You paid $30.**
