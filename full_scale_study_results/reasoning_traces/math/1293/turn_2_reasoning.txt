Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to find out how many chocolate bars the company produces in two weeks and then multiply that by the price per bar.

Step 1: Calculate the number of bars produced in a day
The company produces 5000 bars in a day.

Step 2: Calculate the number of bars produced in two weeks
There are 7 days in a week, so in two weeks there are 2 * 7 = 14 days.
Therefore, in two weeks, the company produces 5000 bars/day * 14 days = 70,000 bars.

Step 3: Calculate the total money received
The company sells each bar for $2. So, the total money received for selling 70,000 bars is 70,000 bars * $2/bar = $140,000.

So, the company will receive $140,000 for selling the produced chocolate bars during two weeks.
