==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of chocolate bars produced in two weeks and then multiply that by the price per bar.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of bars produced in two weeks.

The company produces 5000 bars per day. There are 7 days in a week, so in one week, the company produces 5000 bars/day * 7 days/week = 35,000 bars/week.

Since we're looking for the total produced in two weeks, we multiply this weekly production by 2: 35,000 bars/week * 2 weeks = 70,000 bars.

Step 2: Calculate the total revenue from selling these bars.

The company sells each bar for $2. So, the total revenue from selling 70,000 bars is 70,000 bars * $2/bar = $140,000.

So, the company will receive $140,000 for selling the chocolate bars it produces in two weeks.
