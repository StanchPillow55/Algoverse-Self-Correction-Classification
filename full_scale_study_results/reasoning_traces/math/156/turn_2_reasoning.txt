Question ID: 156
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many bananas each type of ape needs in total for 2 months. 

1. Monkeys: They need 200 bananas every month. So, for 2 months, they will need 200 bananas/month x 2 months = 400 bananas.

2. Gorillas: They need 400 bananas every month. So, for 2 months, they will need 400 bananas/month x 2 months = 800 bananas.

3. Baboons: They need 100 bananas every month. So, for 2 months, they will need 100 bananas/month x 2 months = 200 bananas.

Now, we add up all the bananas needed by the monkeys, gorillas, and baboons for 2 months:

400 bananas (for monkeys) + 800 bananas (for gorillas) + 200 bananas (for baboons) = 1400 bananas.

So, the zookeeper needs to order 1400 bananas to last for 2 months.
