Question ID: 156
Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to find out how many bananas each type of ape needs for 2 months. Since the question gives us the amount of bananas needed for one month, we simply multiply each amount by 2 to find the amount needed for two months.

For the monkeys: 200 bananas/month * 2 months = 400 bananas
For the gorillas: 400 bananas/month * 2 months = 800 bananas
For the baboons: 100 bananas/month * 2 months = 200 bananas

Next, we add up all the bananas needed for all the apes for 2 months.

400 bananas (for monkeys) + 800 bananas (for gorillas) + 200 bananas (for baboons) = 1400 bananas

So, the zookeeper needs to order 1400 bananas to last for 2 months.
