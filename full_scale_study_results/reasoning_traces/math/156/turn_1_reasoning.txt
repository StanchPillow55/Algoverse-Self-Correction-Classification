Question ID: 156
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

The total number of bananas needed by each type of ape per month is calculated by adding the number of bananas each type of ape needs. 

So, the total number of bananas needed per month is:

200 (for monkeys) + 400 (for gorillas) + 100 (for baboons) = 700 bananas

Since the zookeeper orders bananas every 2 months, we need to multiply this monthly total by 2 to find out how many bananas are needed for 2 months:

700 bananas/month * 2 months = 1400 bananas

So, the zookeeper needs to order 1400 bananas to last for 2 months.
