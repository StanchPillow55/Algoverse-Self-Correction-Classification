Question ID: 42
Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to find out how many pieces of pie Grandma Jones initially had. Since she baked 5 pies and cut each pie into 8 pieces, we can find the total number of pieces by multiplying the number of pies by the number of pieces per pie.

5 pies * 8 pieces/pie = 40 pieces

Next, we know that there were 14 pieces of pie remaining at the end of the evening. To find out how many pieces were taken by the guests, we subtract the number of remaining pieces from the total number of pieces.

40 pieces - 14 pieces = 26 pieces

So, the guests took 26 pieces of pie.
