==================================================

Billy's first 3 customers bought 1 DVD each. So, that's 3*1 = 3 DVDs.

His next 2 customers bought 2 DVDs each. So, that's 2*2 = 4 DVDs.

His last 3 customers didn't buy any DVDs. So, that's 3*0 = 0 DVDs.

To find out the total number of DVDs Billy sold on Tuesday, we add up the number of DVDs each group of customers bought. So, that's 3 DVDs + 4 DVDs + 0 DVDs = 7 DVDs.

Therefore, Billy sold 7 DVDs on Tuesday.
