Question ID: 433
Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to determine how many gallons of gas are in each container. Since 15 gallons were equally divided into 5 containers, each container holds 15/5 = 3 gallons of gas.

Next, we need to convert gallons to pints because the question asks for the answer in pints. We know that 1 gallon equals 8 pints. Therefore, each container holds 3 gallons * 8 pints/gallon = 24 pints of gas.

Finally, we need to determine how many pints of gas Josey needs to run her lawnmower. Since she needs 1/4 of a container, she needs 1/4 * 24 pints = 6 pints of gas.

So, Josey needs 6 pints of gasoline to run her lawnmower.
