Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, let's calculate how much potato salad the adult dinosaurs will eat. Since each adult dinosaur eats 10 lbs of potato salad, and there are 20 adult dinosaurs, we multiply 10 lbs by 20 to get the total amount of potato salad the adult dinosaurs will eat. 

10 lbs/adult * 20 adults = 200 lbs

Next, let's calculate how much potato salad the child dinosaurs will eat. Since each child dinosaur eats half as much as an adult dinosaur, and an adult dinosaur eats 10 lbs, each child dinosaur eats 5 lbs of potato salad. Since there are 5 child dinosaurs, we multiply 5 lbs by 5 to get the total amount of potato salad the child dinosaurs will eat.

5 lbs/child * 5 children = 25 lbs

Finally, to get the total amount of potato salad Ted needs to bring, we add the amount the adult dinosaurs will eat to the amount the child dinosaurs will eat.

200 lbs + 25 lbs = 225 lbs

So, Ted the T-Rex needs to bring 225 lbs of potato salad to the dinosaur picnic.
