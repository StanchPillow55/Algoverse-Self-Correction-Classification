Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine the latest of three writers who have taken up the challenge of writing a new James Bond novel.

Given information:
- The passage mentions that William Boyd is "responsible for coming up with the next Bond novel in the Ian Fleming series."
- The passage also states that Boyd claims Bond's true character has been "underplayed" until now.

From the information provided, we can conclude that William Boyd is the latest of three writers to take up the challenge of writing a new James Bond novel.

The reasoning is as follows:
1. The passage explicitly states that William Boyd is "responsible for coming up with the next Bond novel in the Ian Fleming series."
2. This implies that William Boyd is the latest writer to take up the challenge of writing a new James Bond novel.
3. The passage does not mention any other writers who have taken up this challenge, but it does state that Boyd is the "next" writer to do so, suggesting he is the latest in a series of writers.

Therefore, the final answer is:
@placeholder is the latest of three writers to take up the challenge of writing a new James Bond novel.
