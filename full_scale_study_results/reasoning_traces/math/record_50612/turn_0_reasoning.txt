==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of alcoholic drinks consumed by James Bond in the Dr. No film, as described in the passage.

Given information:
- Bond drank two bottles of bourbon.
- Bond drank one bottle of champagne.
- Bond drank one calvados.
- Bond drank four dry martinis.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of alcoholic drinks consumed by Bond.
Number of bourbon drinks = 2 bottles
Number of champagne drinks = 1 bottle
Number of calvados drinks = 1
Number of martini drinks = 4

Total number of alcoholic drinks = 2 + 1 + 1 + 4 = 8 drinks

Therefore, the total number of alcoholic drinks consumed by James Bond in the Dr. No film is 8 drinks.

Final answer: @placeholder is the latest of three writers to take up the challenge of writing a new James Bond novel.
