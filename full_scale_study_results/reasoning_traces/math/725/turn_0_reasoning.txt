==================================================

The cat eats nine sausages in 30 minutes.

The dog eats the same number of sausages in 2/3 the amount of time the cat takes. Therefore, the dog takes 2/3 * 30 minutes = 20 minutes to eat nine sausages.

To calculate the average time the two take to eat the sausages, we add the time the cat takes and the time the dog takes, then divide by 2 (since there are two animals).

So, the average time is (30 minutes + 20 minutes) / 2 = 50 minutes / 2 = 25 minutes.

Therefore, on average, the cat and the dog take 25 minutes to eat nine sausages.
