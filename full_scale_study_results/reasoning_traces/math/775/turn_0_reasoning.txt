Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to calculate how many wheels Henry needs to assemble all the cars and motorcycles.

For the cars, since each car needs 4 wheels, we multiply the number of cars by 4:

57 cars * 4 wheels/car = 228 wheels

For the motorcycles, since each motorcycle needs 2 wheels, we multiply the number of motorcycles by 2:

73 motorcycles * 2 wheels/motorcycle = 146 wheels

Next, we add the number of wheels needed for the cars and motorcycles together to find the total number of wheels needed:

228 wheels (for cars) + 146 wheels (for motorcycles) = 374 wheels

Henry has a box with 650 wheels in it. To find out how many wheels will be left, we subtract the total number of wheels needed from the total number of wheels in the box:

650 wheels (in the box) - 374 wheels (needed) = 276 wheels

So, Henry will have 276 wheels left in the box after assembling all the cars and motorcycles.
