==================================================

Let's define the variables for the ages of Wendy and Colin now:

- Let \( C \) be Colin's current age.
- Let \( W \) be Wendy's current age.

We are given two pieces of information in the problem:

1. Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now.
2. In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now.

### Step 1: Set up the equations based on the information given.

From the first piece of information, we can express it mathematically as:
\[
W = 5(C + 7)
\]
This equation states that Wendy's current age \( W \) is equal to five times Colin's age in seven years, which is \( C + 7 \).

From the second piece of information, we can express it as:
\[
C + 25 = \frac{1}{3} W
\]
This equation states that Colin's age in 25 years, \( C + 25 \), will be one-third of Wendy's current age \( W \).

### Step 2: Solve the equations.

Now we have a system of two equations:
1. \( W = 5(C + 7) \)
2. \( C + 25 = \frac{1}{3} W \)

We can substitute the expression for \( W \) from the first equation into the second equation.

Substituting \( W \):
\[
C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}(5(C + 7))
\]
Simplifying the right side:
\[
C + 25 = \frac{5}{3}(C + 7)
\]
Now, multiply both sides by 3 to eliminate the fraction:
\[
3(C + 25) = 5(C + 7)
\]
Expanding both sides:
\[
3C + 75 = 5C + 35
\]
Now, rearranging the equation to isolate \( C \):
\[
75 - 35 = 5C - 3C
\]
\[
40 = 2C
\]
Dividing both sides by 2:
\[
C = 20
\]

### Step 3: Find Wendy's age.

Now that we have Colin's age, we can find Wendy's age using the first equation:
\[
W = 5(C + 7)
\]
Substituting \( C = 20 \):
\[
W = 5(20 + 7) = 5(27) = 135
\]

### Step 4: Verify the solution.

1. Check the first condition:
   - Colin's age in 7 years: \( 20 + 7 = 27 \)
   - Wendy's age should be \( 5 \times 27 = 135 \) (which we found).

2. Check the second condition:
   - Colin's age in 25 years: \( 20 + 25 = 45 \)
   - One-third of Wendy's current age: \( \frac{1}{3} \times 135 = 45 \) (which matches).

Both conditions are satisfied.

### Final Answer:
Colin's current age is \( \boxed{20} \).
