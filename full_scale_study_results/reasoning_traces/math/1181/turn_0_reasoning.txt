==================================================

Let's denote Wendy's current age as W and Colin's current age as C.

From the problem, we have two equations:

1. W = 5*(C+7) (Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now)

2. C+25 = W/3 (In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now)

We can solve this system of equations step by step.

First, let's express W from the first equation:

W = 5C + 35

Then, we substitute W from the first equation into the second equation:

C + 25 = (5C + 35)/3

To simplify this equation, we multiply every term by 3:

3C + 75 = 5C + 35

Then, we subtract 3C from both sides of the equation:

75 - 35 = 5C - 3C

40 = 2C

Finally, we divide every term by 2:

C = 20

So, Colin is 20 years old now.
