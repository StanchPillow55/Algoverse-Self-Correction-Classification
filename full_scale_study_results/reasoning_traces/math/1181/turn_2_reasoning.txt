==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to set up equations based on the information given about Wendy's and Colin's ages.

Let's define:
- \( C \) = Colin's current age
- \( W \) = Wendy's current age

### Step 1: Set up the equations based on the problem statement.

1. **From the first statement**: "Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now."
   - Colin's age in 7 years will be \( C + 7 \).
   - Therefore, Wendy's age can be expressed as:
     \[
     W = 5(C + 7)
     \]

2. **From the second statement**: "In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now."
   - Colin's age in 25 years will be \( C + 25 \).
   - Wendy's current age is \( W \).
   - Thus, we can express this relationship as:
     \[
     C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}W
     \]

### Step 2: Substitute and solve the equations.

Now we have two equations:
1. \( W = 5(C + 7) \)
2. \( C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}W \)

Let's substitute the expression for \( W \) from the first equation into the second equation.

Substituting \( W \) in the second equation:
\[
C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}(5(C + 7))
\]

### Step 3: Simplify the equation.

Now simplify the right side:
\[
C + 25 = \frac{5}{3}(C + 7)
\]

Multiply both sides by 3 to eliminate the fraction:
\[
3(C + 25) = 5(C + 7)
\]

Distributing both sides:
\[
3C + 75 = 5C + 35
\]

### Step 4: Rearranging the equation.

Now, let's rearrange the equation to isolate \( C \):
\[
3C + 75 - 35 = 5C
\]
\[
3C + 40 = 5C
\]

Subtract \( 3C \) from both sides:
\[
40 = 5C - 3C
\]
\[
40 = 2C
\]

### Step 5: Solve for \( C \).

Now divide both sides by 2:
\[
C = 20
\]

### Step 6: Find Wendy's age.

Now that we have Colin's current age, we can find Wendy's current age using the first equation:
\[
W = 5(C + 7) = 5(20 + 7) = 5 \times 27 = 135
\]

### Final Answer

Colin's current age is:
\[
\boxed{20}
\]
