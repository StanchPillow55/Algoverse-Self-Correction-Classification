==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to set up equations based on the information given about Wendy and Colin's ages.

Let's define:
- \( C \) as Colin's current age.
- \( W \) as Wendy's current age.

### Step 1: Set up the equations based on the problem statement.

1. **First statement**: "Wendy is five times as old as Colin will be seven years from now."
   - In seven years, Colin's age will be \( C + 7 \).
   - Therefore, the first equation can be written as:
     \[
     W = 5(C + 7)
     \]

2. **Second statement**: "In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now."
   - In 25 years, Colin's age will be \( C + 25 \).
   - Wendy's current age is \( W \).
   - Therefore, the second equation can be written as:
     \[
     C + 25 = \frac{1}{3} W
     \]

### Step 2: Solve the equations.

We have the following two equations:
1. \( W = 5(C + 7) \)
2. \( C + 25 = \frac{1}{3} W \)

#### Substitute \( W \) from the first equation into the second equation.

From the first equation, we can express \( W \):
\[
W = 5(C + 7) = 5C + 35
\]

Now substitute this expression for \( W \) into the second equation:
\[
C + 25 = \frac{1}{3}(5C + 35)
\]

#### Multiply both sides by 3 to eliminate the fraction:
\[
3(C + 25) = 5C + 35
\]
\[
3C + 75 = 5C + 35
\]

#### Rearranging the equation:
\[
3C + 75 - 35 = 5C
\]
\[
3C + 40 = 5C
\]
\[
40 = 5C - 3C
\]
\[
40 = 2C
\]
\[
C = 20
\]

### Step 3: Find Wendy's age.

Now that we have Colin's current age \( C = 20 \), we can find Wendy's age using the first equation:
\[
W = 5(C + 7) = 5(20 + 7) = 5 \times 27 = 135
\]

### Final Answer

Colin's current age is:
\[
\boxed{20}
\] 

This solution is consistent with the conditions given in the problem, confirming that Colin is currently 20 years old.
