Question ID: 174
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to convert all the time measurements to the same unit. Since the time to peel a potato is given in minutes, let's convert the time to cut a potato from seconds to minutes. There are 60 seconds in a minute, so 5 seconds is 5/60 = 0.08333 minutes.

Next, we add the time it takes to peel a potato and the time it takes to cut a potato to find the total time it takes to prepare one potato. This is 1.5 minutes (to peel) + 0.08333 minutes (to cut) = 1.58333 minutes per potato.

Finally, we multiply the time it takes to prepare one potato by the total number of potatoes to find the total time it will take Billy to prepare all the potatoes. This is 1.58333 minutes/potato * 60 potatoes = 94.9998 minutes.

Rounding to the nearest whole number, it will take Billy approximately 95 minutes to finish prepping the potatoes.
