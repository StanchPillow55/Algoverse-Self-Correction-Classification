Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to convert all the time measurements to the same unit. Since the time to peel a potato is given in minutes and the time to cut a potato is given in seconds, it would be easiest to convert everything to seconds.

We know that 1 minute is equal to 60 seconds. So, 1.5 minutes (the time it takes to peel a potato) is equal to 1.5 * 60 = 90 seconds.

Now, we can calculate the total time it takes to peel and cut one potato. This is equal to the time to peel one potato plus the time to cut one potato, which is 90 seconds + 5 seconds = 95 seconds.

Since Billy has 60 potatoes to prepare, the total time it will take him to prepare all the potatoes is equal to the time to prepare one potato times the number of potatoes. This is 95 seconds/potato * 60 potatoes = 5700 seconds.

However, it's more common to express time in minutes rather than seconds, so let's convert back to minutes. We know that 1 minute is equal to 60 seconds, so 5700 seconds is equal to 5700 / 60 = 95 minutes.

So, it will take Billy 95 minutes to finish prepping the potatoes.
