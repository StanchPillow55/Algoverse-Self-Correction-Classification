Question ID: 174
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, let's convert all the time measurements to the same unit for easier calculation. Since the time to peel a potato is given in minutes, let's convert the time to cut a potato from seconds to minutes. There are 60 seconds in a minute, so 5 seconds is 5/60 = 0.08333 minutes.

Next, we need to calculate the total time it takes to peel and cut one potato. This is done by adding the time it takes to peel a potato (1.5 minutes) to the time it takes to cut a potato (0.08333 minutes). This gives us a total of 1.58333 minutes per potato.

Finally, we multiply the time per potato by the total number of potatoes (60) to find the total time it will take Billy to finish prepping the potatoes. This gives us 1.58333 minutes/potato * 60 potatoes = 94.9998 minutes.

Since we can't really have a fraction of a second in this context, we can round this to the nearest whole number to get 95 minutes.

So, it will take Billy approximately 95 minutes to finish prepping the potatoes for his family reunion barbecue.
