==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to set up equations based on the information given and solve for Peter's age.

Let's define the variables:
- Let \( P \) be Peter's age.
- Let \( A \) be Paul's age.
- Let \( J \) be John's age.

We are given the following information:
1. The combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years: 
   \[
   P + A + J = 100
   \]

2. Paul is 10 years older than John:
   \[
   A = J + 10
   \]

3. Peterâ€™s age is equal to the sum of Paul and John's age:
   \[
   P = A + J
   \]

Now, let's substitute the expression for \( A \) from the second equation into the third equation:
\[
P = (J + 10) + J = 2J + 10
\]

Now we have:
- \( P = 2J + 10 \)

Substitute \( P = 2J + 10 \) and \( A = J + 10 \) into the first equation:
\[
(2J + 10) + (J + 10) + J = 100
\]

Simplify the equation:
\[
2J + 10 + J + 10 + J = 100
\]
\[
4J + 20 = 100
\]

Subtract 20 from both sides:
\[
4J = 80
\]

Divide by 4:
\[
J = 20
\]

Now that we have \( J = 20 \), we can find \( A \) and \( P \):
- \( A = J + 10 = 20 + 10 = 30 \)
- \( P = 2J + 10 = 2(20) + 10 = 40 + 10 = 50 \)

Thus, Peter's age is \( \boxed{50} \).
