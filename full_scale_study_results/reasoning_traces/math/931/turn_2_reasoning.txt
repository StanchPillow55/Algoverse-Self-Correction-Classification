==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to set up equations based on the information given and then solve for Peter's age.

Let's define the variables:
- Let \( P \) be Peter's age.
- Let \( A \) be Paul's age.
- Let \( J \) be Jean's age.

We are given the following information:
1. The combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years. This can be written as:
   \[
   P + A + J = 100
   \]

2. Paul is 10 years older than John. This can be expressed as:
   \[
   A = J + 10
   \]

3. Peterâ€™s age is equal to the sum of Paul and John's age. This can be written as:
   \[
   P = A + J
   \]

Now, we have three equations:
1. \( P + A + J = 100 \)
2. \( A = J + 10 \)
3. \( P = A + J \)

Let's substitute equation (2) into equation (3) to express \( P \) in terms of \( J \):
\[
P = (J + 10) + J = 2J + 10
\]

Now substitute \( A = J + 10 \) and \( P = 2J + 10 \) into equation (1):
\[
(2J + 10) + (J + 10) + J = 100
\]

Simplify the equation:
\[
2J + 10 + J + 10 + J = 100
\]
\[
4J + 20 = 100
\]

Subtract 20 from both sides:
\[
4J = 80
\]

Divide by 4:
\[
J = 20
\]

Now that we have \( J = 20 \), we can find \( A \) and \( P \):
- \( A = J + 10 = 20 + 10 = 30 \)
- \( P = 2J + 10 = 2(20) + 10 = 40 + 10 = 50 \)

Therefore, Peter's age is \( \boxed{50} \).

To verify, let's check the total:
- Peter's age: 50
- Paul's age: 30
- Jean's age: 20

The combined age is \( 50 + 30 + 20 = 100 \), which matches the given total. Thus, the solution is consistent with all the conditions provided.
