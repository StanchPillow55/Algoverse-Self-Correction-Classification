==================================================

Let's denote the age of Peter as P, the age of Paul as Pa, and the age of John as J.

From the problem, we know that:

1) P + Pa + J = 100 (the combined age of Peter, Paul, and John is 100 years old)

2) Pa = J + 10 (Paul is 10 years older than John)

3) P = Pa + J (Peterâ€™s age is equal to the sum of Paul and John's age)

We can substitute equation (2) into equation (3) to get:

P = (J + 10) + J
P = 2J + 10

Now, we can substitute equation (2) and equation (3) into equation (1):

P + Pa + J = 100
(2J + 10) + (J + 10) + J = 100
4J + 20 = 100
4J = 80
J = 20

Substitute J = 20 into equation (2) to find Pa:

Pa = J + 10
Pa = 20 + 10
Pa = 30

Substitute J = 20 and Pa = 30 into equation (3) to find P:

P = Pa + J
P = 30 + 20
P = 50

So, Peter is 50 years old.
