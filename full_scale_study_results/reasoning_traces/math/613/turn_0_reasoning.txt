Question ID: 613
Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

The total number of posts that the group will have in March depends on the number of days in March and the average number of posts per day.

March has 31 days. 

If each member posts an average of 3 posts per day, then the total number of posts per day is 3 posts/member * 1000 members = 3000 posts/day.

To find the total number of posts in March, we multiply the number of posts per day by the number of days in March.

So, the total number of posts in March is 3000 posts/day * 31 days = 93000 posts.

Therefore, the Reddit group will have 93000 posts in March.
