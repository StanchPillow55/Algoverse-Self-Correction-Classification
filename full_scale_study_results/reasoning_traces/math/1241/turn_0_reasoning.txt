==================================================

First, let's calculate how much Rose spent for the eggs. She bought five dozens of eggs for $2.40 a dozen. 

So, the total cost is 5 dozens * $2.40/dozen = $12.00

Next, let's calculate how much she will earn from selling the eggs. A dozen of eggs contains 12 eggs. So, five dozens of eggs are 5 dozens * 12 eggs/dozen = 60 eggs.

She will sell it for $1 for 3 eggs. So, the total earnings from selling the eggs are 60 eggs * ($1/3 eggs) = $20.00

Finally, let's calculate Rose's profit. The profit is the total earnings minus the total cost. 

So, the profit is $20.00 - $12.00 = $8.00

Therefore, Rose's profit will be $8.00.
