Question ID: 665
Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to find out how many math teachers are on the court. We know that 60% of the 150 teachers are history teachers, so we subtract this number from the total to find the number of math teachers.

The number of history teachers is 60/100 * 150 = 90 teachers.

So, the number of math teachers is 150 total teachers - 90 history teachers = 60 math teachers.

Each teacher sleeps for 6 hours a day, so the total time the math teachers collectively spend sleeping in one day is 60 teachers * 6 hours/teacher = 360 hours.

So, the math teachers collectively spend 360 hours sleeping in one day.
