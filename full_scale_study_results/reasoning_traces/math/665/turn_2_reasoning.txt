Question ID: 665
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine how many math teachers are on the basketball court and then calculate the total time they collectively spend sleeping in one day.

**Step 1: Calculate the number of history teachers.**

We know that 60% of the 150 teachers are history teachers. To find the number of history teachers, we calculate 60% of 150:

\[
\text{Number of history teachers} = 0.60 \times 150 = 90
\]

**Step 2: Calculate the number of math teachers.**

The rest of the teachers are math teachers. Therefore, we subtract the number of history teachers from the total number of teachers to find the number of math teachers:

\[
\text{Number of math teachers} = 150 - 90 = 60
\]

**Step 3: Calculate the total time the math teachers spend sleeping.**

Each math teacher sleeps for 6 hours a day. To find the total time all math teachers collectively spend sleeping, we multiply the number of math teachers by the number of hours each sleeps:

\[
\text{Total sleep time for math teachers} = 60 \times 6 = 360 \text{ hours}
\]

Thus, the math teachers collectively spend 360 hours sleeping in one day.

**Final Answer:**

The total time the math teachers collectively spend sleeping in one day is 360 hours.
