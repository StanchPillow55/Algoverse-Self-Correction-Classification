Question ID: 665
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine how many of the teachers on the basketball court are math teachers, and then calculate the total amount of time these math teachers spend sleeping in one day.

**Step 1: Calculate the number of history teachers.**

We know that 60% of the 150 teachers are history teachers. To find the number of history teachers, we calculate 60% of 150:

\[
\text{Number of history teachers} = 0.60 \times 150 = 90
\]

**Step 2: Calculate the number of math teachers.**

The rest of the teachers are math teachers. To find the number of math teachers, we subtract the number of history teachers from the total number of teachers:

\[
\text{Number of math teachers} = 150 - 90 = 60
\]

**Step 3: Calculate the total sleep time for all math teachers.**

Each math teacher sleeps for 6 hours a day. Therefore, the total sleep time for all math teachers is:

\[
\text{Total sleep time} = \text{Number of math teachers} \times \text{Hours of sleep per teacher}
\]

\[
\text{Total sleep time} = 60 \times 6 = 360 \text{ hours}
\]

**Final Answer:**

The math teachers collectively spend 360 hours sleeping in one day.
