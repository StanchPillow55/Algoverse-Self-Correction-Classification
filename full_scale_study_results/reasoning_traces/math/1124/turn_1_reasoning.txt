Question ID: 1124
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to work backwards from the information given about the stickers. Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Determine how many stickers Kris had before giving them to Rob:**
   - Kris gave 7 stickers to Rob and kept 9 stickers for himself.
   - Therefore, Kris originally had \(9 + 7 = 16\) stickers.

2. **Determine how many stickers Luis gave to Kris:**
   - Luis gave all his remaining stickers to Kris after using half of them.
   - Since Kris received 16 stickers from Luis, this means the remaining half of Luis's stickers was 16.

3. **Determine how many stickers Luis originally had:**
   - If 16 stickers represent half of what Luis had after using half, then Luis originally had twice that amount.
   - Therefore, Luis had \(16 \times 2 = 32\) stickers after receiving them from Seth.

4. **Determine how many stickers Seth originally had:**
   - Seth gave half of his stickers to Luis, and Luis ended up with 32 stickers.
   - Therefore, Seth originally had twice the number of stickers he gave to Luis.
   - Thus, Seth had \(32 \times 2 = 64\) stickers.

By working backwards through the problem, we have determined that Seth originally had 64 stickers.

**Final Answer: Seth had 64 stickers in the beginning.**
