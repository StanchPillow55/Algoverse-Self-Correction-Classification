Question ID: 1124
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to work backwards from the information given about the stickers.

1. **Understanding the final distribution:**
   - Kris kept 9 stickers and gave 7 stickers to Rob. 
   - Therefore, Kris originally had \(9 + 7 = 16\) stickers.

2. **Tracing back to Luis:**
   - Kris received the stickers from Luis after Luis used half of what he had.
   - If Kris ended up with 16 stickers, this means that 16 stickers were half of what Luis had left after using half of his stickers.
   - Therefore, the number of stickers Luis had before using half was \(16 \times 2 = 32\).

3. **Tracing back to Seth:**
   - Luis received these 32 stickers from Seth, which were half of Seth's original number of stickers.
   - Therefore, Seth originally had \(32 \times 2 = 64\) stickers.

Thus, the number of stickers Seth had in the beginning is \(\boxed{64}\).
