==================================================

Let's start from the end of the problem and work our way back to the beginning.

Rob received 7 stickers from Kris. But we know that Kris kept 9 stickers for herself before giving the rest to Rob. So, Kris had 7 (Rob's stickers) + 9 (her own stickers) = 16 stickers.

These 16 stickers were half of what Luis had, because Luis gave half of his stickers to Kris. So, to find out how many stickers Luis had, we need to double the number of stickers Kris had. So, Luis had 16 (Kris's stickers) * 2 = 32 stickers.

Finally, these 32 stickers were half of what Seth had, because Seth gave half of his stickers to Luis. So, to find out how many stickers Seth had, we need to double the number of stickers Luis had. So, Seth had 32 (Luis's stickers) * 2 = 64 stickers.

So, Seth had 64 stickers in the beginning.
