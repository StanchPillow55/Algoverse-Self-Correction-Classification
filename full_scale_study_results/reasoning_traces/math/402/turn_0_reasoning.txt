Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to determine how much flour and milk Mark needs for a quadruple batch of brownies. 

For the flour, the normal recipe calls for 3 cups. Since Mark is making a quadruple batch, he will need 3 cups x 4 = 12 cups of flour.

For the milk, the normal recipe calls for 1 cup. Since Mark is making a quadruple batch, he will need 1 cup x 4 = 4 cups of milk.

Next, we need to determine how many bags of flour and bottles of milk Mark needs to buy. 

Flour is sold in 2-cup bags, so to get 12 cups of flour, Mark will need 12 cups รท 2 cups/bag = 6 bags of flour.

Milk is sold in 2-cup bottles, so to get 4 cups of milk, Mark will need 4 cups รท 2 cups/bottle = 2 bottles of milk.

Finally, we need to determine how many more bags of flour than bottles of milk Mark has to buy. 

To do this, we subtract the number of bottles of milk from the number of bags of flour: 6 bags of flour - 2 bottles of milk = 4.

So, Mark has to buy 4 more bags of flour than bottles of milk.
