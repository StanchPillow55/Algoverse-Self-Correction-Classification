Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To determine if the premise entails the hypothesis, we need to analyze the information provided in the premise and see if it logically leads to the conclusion that the hypothesis is true.

Given information:
- Premise: Warrington-born Chris Evans denies he went wild, despite quitting Radio 1 in 1997 and later being sacked by Virgin Radio for not turning up for work during a five-day drinking binge.
- Hypothesis: Chris Evans worked for Radio 1.

Reasoning:
1. The premise states that Chris Evans "quit Radio 1 in 1997", which directly implies that he worked for Radio 1 prior to quitting.
2. The premise also mentions that Chris Evans was later "sacked by Virgin Radio", which suggests that he worked for Virgin Radio after leaving Radio 1.
3. The fact that Chris Evans quit Radio 1 in 1997 and was later sacked by Virgin Radio supports the hypothesis that he worked for Radio 1.

Therefore, the premise entails the hypothesis.

Final answer: Yes, the premise entails the hypothesis.
