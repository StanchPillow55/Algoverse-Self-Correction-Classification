Question ID: rte_2319
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To determine whether the premise entails the hypothesis, we need to analyze the information provided in the premise and evaluate the logical relationship between the premise and the hypothesis.

Premise:
- Warrington-born Chris Evans denies he went wild, despite quitting Radio 1 in 1997 and later being sacked by Virgin Radio for not turning up for work during a five-day drinking binge.

Hypothesis:
- Chris Evans worked for Radio 1.

Reasoning:
1. The premise explicitly states that Chris Evans "quit Radio 1 in 1997," which directly supports the hypothesis that Chris Evans worked for Radio 1.
2. The premise provides additional details about Chris Evans being sacked by Virgin Radio, but this information is not directly relevant to the hypothesis that he worked for Radio 1.

Therefore, the premise entails the hypothesis.

Final Answer:
Yes, the premise entails the hypothesis.
