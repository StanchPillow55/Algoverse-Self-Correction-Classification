Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To determine if the word "work" is used with the same meaning in both sentences, we need to analyze the context and usage of the word in each sentence.

Sentence 1: "Can you work an electric drill?"
In this sentence, the word "work" is used as a verb, meaning to operate or use the electric drill effectively.

Sentence 2: "This pilot works the controls."
In this sentence, the word "work" is also used as a verb, but it has a different meaning. Here, "work" means to operate or control the aircraft's controls.

Therefore, the word "work" is not used with the same meaning in both sentences. In the first sentence, it refers to operating an electric drill, while in the second sentence, it refers to controlling the aircraft's controls.

Final answer: No, the word "work" is not used with the same meaning in both sentences.
