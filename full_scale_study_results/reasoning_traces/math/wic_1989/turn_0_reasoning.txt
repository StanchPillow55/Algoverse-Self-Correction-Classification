To determine if the word "work" is used with the same meaning in both sentences, we need to analyze the context and usage of the word in each sentence.

Sentence 1: "Can you work an electric drill?"
In this sentence, the word "work" is used as a verb, and it means to operate or use the electric drill. The sentence is asking if the person can use or operate the electric drill.

Sentence 2: "This pilot works the controls."
In this sentence, the word "work" is also used as a verb, but the meaning is different. Here, "work" means to operate or control the aircraft's controls. The sentence is describing the pilot's action of controlling the aircraft.

To summarize:
In the first sentence, "work" means to operate or use an electric drill.
In the second sentence, "work" means to operate or control the aircraft's controls.

Therefore, the word "work" is not used with the same meaning in both sentences. The meanings are different, even though the word is used as a verb in both cases.

Final answer: No, the word "work" is not used with the same meaning in both sentences.
