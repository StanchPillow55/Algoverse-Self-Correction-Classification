First, let's find out how many male and female fishes Tate has before he buys new ones. 

He has 4 male guppies and 3 male goldfishes, so he has 4 + 3 = <<4+3=7>>7 male fishes.

He has 7 female guppies and 5 female goldfishes, so he has 7 + 5 = <<7+5=12>>12 female fishes.

Then, let's add the new fishes he buys.

He buys 2 male guppies and 2 male goldfishes, so he adds 2 + 2 = <<2+2=4>>4 male fishes.

He buys 1 female guppy and 3 female goldfishes, so he adds 1 + 3 = <<1+3=4>>4 female fishes.

Now, let's add these new fishes to his original number of fishes.

He now has 7 original male fishes + 4 new male fishes = <<7+4=11>>11 male fishes.

He now has 12 original female fishes + 4 new female fishes = <<12+4=16>>16 female fishes.

Finally, to find out how many more female fishes than male fishes Tate has, we subtract the number of male fishes from the number of female fishes.

So, he has 16 female fishes - 11 male fishes = <<16-11=5>>5 more female fishes than male fishes.

Therefore, Tate has 5 more female fishes than male fishes.
