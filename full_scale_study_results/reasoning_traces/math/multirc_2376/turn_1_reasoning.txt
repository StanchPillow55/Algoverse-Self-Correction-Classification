To solve this problem, I will go through the paragraph step-by-step and extract the relevant information to determine how the chieftains of some hill clans responded to Alexander's invitation.

Step 1: Identify the key information in the paragraph.
The paragraph states that Alexander invited the chieftains of the former satrapy of Gandhara to come to him and submit to his authority. It then mentions that Omphis (Ambhi Kumar), the ruler of Taxila, complied, but the chieftains of some hill clans, including the Aspasioi and Assakenoi sections of the Kambojas, refused to submit.

Step 2: Summarize the response of the chieftains of the hill clans.
The paragraph clearly states that the chieftains of some hill clans, including the Aspasioi and Assakenoi, refused to submit to Alexander's authority.

Step 3: Provide the final answer.
The chieftains of some hill clans, including the Aspasioi and Assakenoi, refused to submit to Alexander's invitation.
