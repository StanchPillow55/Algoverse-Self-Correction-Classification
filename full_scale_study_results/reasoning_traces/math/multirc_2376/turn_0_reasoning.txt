==================================================

To answer this question, I will go through the relevant details in the paragraph step-by-step:

1. The paragraph states that Alexander "invited the chieftains of the former satrapy of Gandhara, in the north of what is now Pakistan, to come to him and submit to his authority."

2. It then says that "Omphis(Indian name Ambhi Kumar), the ruler of Taxila, whose kingdom extended from the Indus to the Hydaspes (Jhelum), complied, but the chieftains of some hill clans, including the Aspasioi and Assakenoi sections of the Kambojas (known in Indian texts also as Ashvayanas and Ashvakayanas), refused to submit."

3. The key information here is that the chieftains of some hill clans, specifically the Aspasioi and Assakenoi, refused to submit to Alexander's authority when he invited them to do so.

Therefore, the complete answer is:

The chieftains of some hill clans, including the Aspasioi and Assakenoi, refused to submit to Alexander
