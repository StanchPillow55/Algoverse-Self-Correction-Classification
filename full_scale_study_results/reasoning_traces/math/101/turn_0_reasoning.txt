Question ID: 101
Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to find out the total number of pages Solo needs to read. We do this by adding the number of pages from each textbook:

Science: 4 pages
Social Studies: 20 pages
History: 7 pages
Geography: 8 pages

Total pages = 4 + 20 + 7 + 8 = 39 pages

Solo read 15 pages on Monday, so we subtract this from the total number of pages to find out how many pages he still needs to read:

39 pages - 15 pages = 24 pages

Solo has 4 more days to complete his reading. To find out how many pages he needs to read on average each day, we divide the total number of pages he still needs to read by the number of days he has left:

24 pages รท 4 days = 6 pages/day

So, Solo needs to read, on average, 6 pages per day for the next 4 days.
