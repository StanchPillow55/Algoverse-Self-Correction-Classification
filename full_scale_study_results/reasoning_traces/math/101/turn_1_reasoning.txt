Question ID: 101
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to find out how many pages Solo has to read in total. We do this by adding up all the pages from his different textbooks:

4 (Science) + 20 (Social Studies) + 7 (History) + 8 (Geography) = 39 pages

Next, we need to subtract the number of pages Solo has already read on Monday:

39 (total pages) - 15 (pages read on Monday) = 24 pages

Solo has 4 more days to complete all his reading. So, we divide the remaining pages by the number of days:

24 (remaining pages) รท 4 (days) = 6 pages

Therefore, Solo needs to read, on average, 6 pages per day for the next 4 days.
