Question ID: 101
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to find out the total number of pages Solo needs to read. We do this by adding up all the pages from his textbooks:

4 (Science) + 20 (Social Studies) + 7 (History) + 8 (Geography) = 39 pages

Solo has already read 15 pages on Monday, so we subtract this from the total:

39 (total pages) - 15 (pages read) = 24 pages left to read

Solo has 4 more days to complete his reading. To find out how many pages he needs to read on average each day, we divide the total number of pages left by the number of days:

24 (pages left) รท 4 (days) = 6 pages per day

So, Solo needs to read, on average, 6 pages per day to complete all his reading.
