Question ID: 118
Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

The problem tells us that each container holds 5 vehicles. On the first day, 2 containers were counted, so there were 2 * 5 = <<2*5=10>>10 vehicles.

On the second day, the total number of vehicles became 30. Since there were already 10 vehicles from the first day, this means that 30 - 10 = <<30-10=20>>20 vehicles were brought in on the second day.

Since each container holds 5 vehicles, the number of containers brought in on the second day is 20 / 5 = <<20/5=4>>4 containers.

So, 4 containers were imported on the second day.
