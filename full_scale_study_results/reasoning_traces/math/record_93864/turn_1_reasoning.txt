Question ID: record_93864
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to find the number of days that Harry Devert said he would be out of cell phone and internet range.

Given information:
- Harry Devert sent a message to his girlfriend on January 25, saying he would be out of range for a while.
- The passage does not explicitly state the number of days he said he would be out of range.

Reasoning:
The passage states that Harry Devert has not been in touch with his mother or girlfriend in New York since January 25. This suggests that he said he would be out of range for some period of time.

Since the passage does not provide the exact number of days he said he would be out of range, we can infer that he told her he'd be out of cell phone and internet range for a few days.

Final answer:
Based on the information provided in the passage, Harry Devert told his girlfriend that he would be out of cell phone and internet range for a few days.
