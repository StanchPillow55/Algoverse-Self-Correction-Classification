Question ID: record_93864
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to find the number of days that Harry Devert said he would be out of cell phone and internet range.

Given information:
- Harry Devert sent a message to his girlfriend on January 25, saying he would be out of range for a while.
- The passage does not explicitly state the number of days he said he would be out of range.

Reasoning:
Based on the information provided in the passage, we can infer that Harry Devert told his girlfriend he would be out of cell phone and internet range for a few days. The passage states that his family and friends in New York have not heard from him in two weeks, which suggests that the "few days" he mentioned in his message was longer than that.

Therefore, the number of days he said he would be out of cell phone and internet range is a few days, which can be interpreted as more than 2 days but less than 14 days.

Final answer:
The number of days Harry Devert said he would be out of cell phone and internet range is a few days, which can be interpreted as more than 2 days but less than 14 days.
