Question ID: 540
Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

Let's start by figuring out how much each boy received when the $18 was shared among the 3 boys. Since $18 divided by 3 is $6, each boy received $6.

The eldest boy then added $5 to his share, so he had $6 + $5 = $11.

The following day, he added another $10, so he then had $11 + $10 = $21.

He then spent $8, leaving him with $21 - $8 = $13.

Finally, he was able to triple the amount he had left after spending the $8, so he now has $13 * 3 = $39.

So, the eldest boy now has $39.
