Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, I will break it down step-by-step:

1. Identify the key information given in the passage:
   - The Labour leader, Ed Miliband, criticized the UK government for its "inexplicable silence" over civilian casualties in the Palestinian territory under attack from Israel.
   - The Tories (Conservative party) said that Miliband's "ultra-critical" attack on David Cameron's response to the Gaza crisis will hamper Britain's ability to help bring about peace in the Middle East.
   - Justice Secretary Chris Grayling responded, saying that ultra-critical comments about Israel would make it harder for Britain to help find a peaceful solution.
   - Grayling said: "I think we in @placeholder have to be enormously careful to try and work in a way that encourages a ceasefire, encourages an end to the action on both sides."

2. Identify the missing word in Grayling's quote: "@placeholder"
   - The missing word is likely "Britain" or "the UK", as Grayling is speaking on behalf of the British government.

3. Analyze Grayling's statement
