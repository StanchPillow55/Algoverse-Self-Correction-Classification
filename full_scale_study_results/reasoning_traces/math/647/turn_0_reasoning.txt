Question ID: 647
Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, let's calculate the time it will take Bill to dig through the soil. We know that he can dig 4 feet per hour and he needs to dig 24 feet. So, we divide the total distance by his speed:

24 feet / 4 feet/hour = 6 hours

Next, let's calculate the time it will take him to dig through the clay. We know that he can dig half as fast through clay as he can through soil, so his speed is 4 feet/hour / 2 = 2 feet/hour. He needs to dig 8 feet of clay, so we divide the total distance by his speed:

8 feet / 2 feet/hour = 4 hours

Finally, we add the time it takes to dig through the soil and the clay to find the total time:

6 hours + 4 hours = 10 hours

So, it will take Bill 10 hours to dig the well.
