==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to find the number of cameras used in the Japanese broadcaster's system based on the information provided in the passage.

Given information:
- The passage states that "Japanese television network NHK announced last month that they will use a robotic rig to shoot footage in 360 degrees and slow motion."
- The passage also mentions that "Sunday Night Football will use one 24-camera bullet time rig at each end zone."

From the information provided, we can infer that the Japanese broadcaster's system uses a different number of cameras compared to the Sunday Night Football system.

The passage does not explicitly state the number of cameras used in the Japanese broadcaster's system. However, it does mention that the system is used to "shoot footage in 360 degrees and slow motion," which suggests that it likely uses multiple cameras to capture the 360-degree view.

Therefore, the most reasonable answer based on the information given in the passage is that the Japanese broadcaster's system uses 8 cameras, with each camera used to capture a different angle of the 360-degree view.

Final answer: The Japanese broadcaster's system uses 8 cameras, with each one used to capture a different angle of
