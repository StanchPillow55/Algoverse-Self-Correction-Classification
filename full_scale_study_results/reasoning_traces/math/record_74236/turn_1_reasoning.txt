==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to find the number of cameras used in the Japanese broadcaster's system based on the information provided in the passage.

Given information:
- NBC will use Matrix-style 360 technology to film pro football.
- Sunday Night Football will use two 24-camera bullet time rigs.
- The passage mentions that the Japanese broadcaster NHK announced they will use a robotic rig to shoot footage in 360 degrees and slow motion.

The passage states that the Japanese broadcaster's system uses a robotic rig to shoot footage in 360 degrees and slow motion, but it does not explicitly mention the number of cameras used.

However, the passage does provide a clue about the number of cameras used in the Japanese broadcaster's system. It states that the system is "similar to the one used during the filming of 1999 film The Matrix," where the "main character Neo is shown dodging and stopping bullets which led to the effect being dubbed 'bullet time'."

The "bullet time" effect in The Matrix was achieved using a rig with multiple cameras arranged in a circle around the subject. This allowed the filmmakers to capture the action from multiple angles and create the slow
