Question ID: record_74236
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to find the number of cameras used in the Japanese broadcaster's system based on the information provided in the passage.

Given information:
- NBC will use Matrix-style 360 technology to film pro football.
- Sunday Night Football will use two 24-camera bullet time rigs.
- The passage mentions that the Japanese broadcaster NHK announced they will use a robotic rig to shoot footage in 360 degrees and slow motion.

The passage states that the Japanese broadcaster NHK will use a robotic rig to shoot footage in 360 degrees and slow motion. It does not explicitly mention the number of cameras used in this system.

However, the passage also mentions that the system used in the filming of the 1999 film The Matrix, which is similar to the one used by the Japanese broadcaster, is a "24-camera bullet time rig."

Therefore, based on the information provided in the passage, the most reasonable inference is that the Japanese broadcaster's system uses eight cameras, each one used.

Final answer: The Japanese broadcaster's system uses eight cameras, each one used.
