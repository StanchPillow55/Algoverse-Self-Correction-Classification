Question ID: 391
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we first need to understand that the ratio of 5:6 means that for every 5 popsicles Betty has, Sam has 6. 

The total number of parts in this ratio is 5 (for Betty) + 6 (for Sam) = 11 parts. 

We know that the total number of popsicles they have together is 165. Therefore, each part in the ratio is equal to 165 popsicles divided by 11 parts, which equals 15 popsicles per part.

Since the ratio tells us that Betty has 5 parts and Sam has 6 parts, we can calculate the number of popsicles each person has. 

Betty has 5 parts * 15 popsicles per part = 75 popsicles.

Sam has 6 parts * 15 popsicles per part = 90 popsicles.

To find out how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty, we subtract the number of popsicles Betty has from the number Sam has. 

So, Sam has 90 popsicles - 75 popsicles = 15 more popsicles than Betty.

Therefore, the final answer is that Sam has 15 more popsicles than Betty.
