==================================================

The ratio of popsicles that Betty and Sam have is 5:6. This means that for every 5 popsicles Betty has, Sam has 6. 

The total ratio is 5 + 6 = 11. 

The total number of popsicles they have together is 165. 

To find out how many popsicles each person has, we can divide the total number of popsicles by the total ratio. 

So, 165 popsicles รท 11 = 15 popsicles per ratio unit.

Therefore, Betty has 5 ratio units * 15 popsicles per ratio unit = 75 popsicles.

And Sam has 6 ratio units * 15 popsicles per ratio unit = 90 popsicles.

To find out how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty, we subtract the number of popsicles Betty has from the number of popsicles Sam has.

So, 90 popsicles - 75 popsicles = 15 popsicles.

Therefore, Sam has 15 more popsicles than Betty.
