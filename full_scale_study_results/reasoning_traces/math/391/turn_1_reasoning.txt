Question ID: 391
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to understand that the ratio 5:6 means that for every 5 popsicles Betty has, Sam has 6. 

The total ratio is therefore 5 + 6 = 11. 

This total ratio of 11 represents the total number of popsicles they have together, which is 165. 

To find out what 1 part of the ratio represents, we divide the total number of popsicles by the total ratio. So, 165 popsicles ÷ 11 = 15 popsicles. This means that each part of the ratio represents 15 popsicles.

Since the ratio tells us that Betty has 5 parts and Sam has 6 parts, we can calculate the number of popsicles each has by multiplying their respective parts by 15.

Betty has 5 parts × 15 = 75 popsicles.
Sam has 6 parts × 15 = 90 popsicles.

To find out how many more popsicles Sam has than Betty, we subtract the number of popsicles Betty has from the number Sam has. 

So, 90 popsicles - 75 popsicles = 15 popsicles.

Therefore, Sam has 15 more popsicles than Betty.
