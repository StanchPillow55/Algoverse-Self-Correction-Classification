Question ID: 837
Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

The total cost of the new laptop is $600. If Erika trades in her old laptop, the price of the new one would be reduced by $200. So, the new price of the laptop after the trade-in would be $600 - $200 = $400.

Erika has been paid $150 for her part-time job and her mom gave her $80. So, the total money she has from her job and her mom is $150 + $80 = $230.

Erika still needs an extra $50 to buy the laptop. This means the total money she has now (including the money in her purse) is $400 - $50 = $350.

So, the money Erika has in her purse is $350 (total money she has now) - $230 (money from her job and her mom) = $120.

Therefore, Erika has $120 in her purse.
