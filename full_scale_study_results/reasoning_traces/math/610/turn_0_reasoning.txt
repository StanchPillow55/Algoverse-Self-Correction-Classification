To determine how much more it costs to repave Lewis' street compared to Monica's street, we will first calculate the total cost to repave each street and then find the difference between the two costs.

1. **Calculate the cost to repave Monica's street:**
   - Length of Monica's street = 150 meters
   - Cost per meter = $194
   - Total cost for Monica's street = Length × Cost per meter
   \[
   \text{Total cost for Monica's street} = 150 \, \text{meters} \times 194 \, \text{dollars/meter}
   \]
   \[
   = 150 \times 194 = 29100 \, \text{dollars}
   \]

2. **Calculate the cost to repave Lewis' street:**
   - Length of Lewis' street = 490 meters
   - Cost per meter = $194
   - Total cost for Lewis' street = Length × Cost per meter
   \[
   \text{Total cost for Lewis' street} = 490 \, \text{meters} \times 194 \, \text{dollars/meter}
   \]
   \[
   = 490 \times 194 = 95060 \, \text{dollars}
   \]

3. **Calculate the difference in cost between Lewis' street and Monica's street:**
   - Difference = Total cost for Lewis' street - Total cost for Monica's street
   \[
   \text{Difference} = 95060 \, \text{dollars} - 29100 \, \text{dollars}
   \]
   \[
   = 65960 \, \text{dollars}
   \]

Thus, the cost to repave Lewis' street is **$65,960** more than the cost to repave Monica's street.

**Final Answer: $65,960**
