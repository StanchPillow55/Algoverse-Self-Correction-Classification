Question ID: 610
Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to find out how much it costs to repave Monica's street. We do this by multiplying the cost per meter by the length of Monica's street.

$194/meter * 150 meters = $29,100

Next, we calculate the cost to repave Lewis' street in the same way.

$194/meter * 490 meters = $95,060

To find out how much more it costs to repave Lewis' street, we subtract the cost of repaving Monica's street from the cost of repaving Lewis' street.

$95,060 - $29,100 = $65,960

So, it costs $65,960 more to repave Lewis' street than Monica's street.
