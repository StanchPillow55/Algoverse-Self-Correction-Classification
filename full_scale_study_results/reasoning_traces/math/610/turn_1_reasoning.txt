==================================================

To find out how much more it costs to repave Lewis' street compared to Monica's street, we will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the cost to repave Monica's street**:
   - Monica's street length = 150 meters
   - Cost per meter = $194
   - Total cost for Monica's street = Length × Cost per meter
   \[
   \text{Total cost for Monica's street} = 150 \, \text{meters} \times 194 \, \text{dollars/meter} = 29100 \, \text{dollars}
   \]

2. **Calculate the cost to repave Lewis' street**:
   - Lewis' street length = 490 meters
   - Cost per meter = $194
   - Total cost for Lewis' street = Length × Cost per meter
   \[
   \text{Total cost for Lewis' street} = 490 \, \text{meters} \times 194 \, \text{dollars/meter} = 95060 \, \text{dollars}
   \]

3. **Calculate the difference in cost**:
   - Difference = Total cost for Lewis' street - Total cost for Monica's street
   \[
   \text{Difference} = 95060 \, \text{dollars} - 29100 \, \text{dollars} = 65960 \, \text{dollars}
   \]

Thus, the additional cost to repave Lewis' street compared to Monica's street is **$65,960**.

Final answer: **$65,960**.
