Question ID: 610
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to calculate how much it costs to repave Monica's street. We do this by multiplying the cost per meter ($194) by the length of Monica's street (150 meters). 

194 * 150 = $29,100

Next, we calculate the cost to repave Lewis' street in the same way. We multiply the cost per meter ($194) by the length of Lewis' street (490 meters).

194 * 490 = $95,060

To find out how much more it costs to repave Lewis' street compared to Monica's, we subtract the cost of repaving Monica's street from the cost of repaving Lewis' street.

$95,060 - $29,100 = $65,960

So, it costs $65,960 more to repave Lewis' street than Monica's.
