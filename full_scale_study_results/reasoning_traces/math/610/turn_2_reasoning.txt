Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to calculate the cost to repave both Monica's street and Lewis' street, and then find the difference in cost.

1. **Calculate the cost to repave Monica's street:**
   - Length of Monica's street = 150 meters
   - Cost per meter = $194
   - Total cost for Monica's street = Length × Cost per meter
   \[
   \text{Total cost for Monica's street} = 150 \, \text{meters} \times 194 \, \text{dollars/meter} = 29100 \, \text{dollars}
   \]

2. **Calculate the cost to repave Lewis' street:**
   - Length of Lewis' street = 490 meters
   - Cost per meter = $194
   - Total cost for Lewis' street = Length × Cost per meter
   \[
   \text{Total cost for Lewis' street} = 490 \, \text{meters} \times 194 \, \text{dollars/meter} = 95060 \, \text{dollars}
   \]

3. **Calculate the difference in cost between Lewis' street and Monica's street:**
   - Difference in cost = Total cost for Lewis' street - Total cost for Monica's street
   \[
   \text{Difference in cost} = 95060 \, \text{dollars} - 29100 \, \text{dollars} = 65960 \, \text{dollars}
   \]

Thus, the additional cost to repave Lewis' street compared to Monica's street is **$65,960**.

Final answer: **$65,960**.
