Question ID: 610
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we first need to calculate the cost of repaving each street. 

For Monica's street, which is 150 meters long, we multiply the length of the street by the cost per meter:

150 meters * $194/meter = $29,100

For Lewis' street, which is 490 meters long, we do the same calculation:

490 meters * $194/meter = $94,860

To find out how much more it costs to repave Lewis' street compared to Monica's, we subtract the cost of repaving Monica's street from the cost of repaving Lewis' street:

$94,860 - $29,100 = $65,760

So, it costs $65,760 more to repave Lewis' street than Monica's street.
