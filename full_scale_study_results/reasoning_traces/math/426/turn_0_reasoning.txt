Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, let's find out how much the soup cost. Since it's 25% more expensive than the bagel, we need to calculate 25% of the bagel's price and add it to the bagel's price.

25% of $4 is $4 * 25/100 = $1.

So, the soup cost $4 + $1 = $5.

Next, let's find out how much the cake cost. Since it's half the price of the bagel, we need to calculate 50% of the bagel's price.

50% of $4 is $4 * 50/100 = $2.

So, the cake cost $2.

Finally, let's add up the cost of all the items to find out how much Aleksandra needed to pay for her dinner.

The total cost of the dinner is $4 (bagel) + $5 (soup) + $2 (cake) = $11.

So, Aleksandra needed to pay $11 for her dinner.
