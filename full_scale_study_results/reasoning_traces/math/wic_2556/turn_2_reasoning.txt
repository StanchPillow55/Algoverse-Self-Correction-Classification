==================================================

To determine if the word "smear" is used with the same meaning in both sentences, I will analyze the context and usage of the word in each sentence.

Sentence 1: "Smear the wall with paint."
In this sentence, the word "smear" is used as a verb, meaning to apply or spread a substance, such as paint, over a surface.

Sentence 2: "The opposition party attempted to smear the candidate by spreading incorrect and unverifiable rumors about their personal behavior."
In this sentence, the word "smear" is used as a verb, but with a different meaning. Here, "smear" means to damage or tarnish the reputation of someone by spreading negative or false information about them.

Therefore, the word "smear" is not used with the same meaning in both sentences. In the first sentence, it refers to the physical act of applying a substance, while in the second sentence, it refers to the act of damaging someone's reputation.

Final answer: No, the word "smear" is not used with the same meaning in both sentences.
