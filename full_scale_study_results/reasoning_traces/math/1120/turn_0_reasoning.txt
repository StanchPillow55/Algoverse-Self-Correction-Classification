==================================================

The first step is to determine the distance of a one-way trip to John's parents' house. We can do this by using the formula for distance, which is speed multiplied by time. In this case, John's speed is 70 mph and the time is 2 hours. 

So, the distance of a one-way trip is 70 mph * 2 hours = 140 miles.

Since John makes a round trip (going there and coming back) each time he visits, we need to double this distance. 

So, the distance of a round trip is 140 miles * 2 = 280 miles.

Finally, since John visits his parents twice a month, we need to multiply this round trip distance by 2.

So, the total distance John drives each month is 280 miles * 2 = 560 miles.

Therefore, John drives 560 miles a month when visiting his parents.
