Question ID: 1120
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to calculate the distance of a one-way trip. We can use the formula for distance which is speed multiplied by time. 

John's speed is 70 mph and he drives for 2 hours, so the distance of a one-way trip is 70 mph * 2 hours = 140 miles.

Since John makes a round trip each time he visits, the total distance for each visit is 140 miles * 2 = 280 miles.

John visits his parents twice a month, so the total distance he drives in a month is 280 miles * 2 = 560 miles.

Therefore, John drives 560 miles a month when visiting his parents.
