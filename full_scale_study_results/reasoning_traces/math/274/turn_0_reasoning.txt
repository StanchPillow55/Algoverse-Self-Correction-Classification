==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to find out how much Mrs. Rylan spent on each type of seed and then add those amounts together.

First, let's calculate how much she spent on tomato seeds. She bought 20 packets of tomato seeds, and each packet costs $40. So, we multiply the number of packets by the cost of each packet:

20 packets * $40/packet = $800

Next, let's calculate how much she spent on celery seeds. She bought 80 packets of celery seeds, and each packet costs $30. So, we multiply the number of packets by the cost of each packet:

80 packets * $30/packet = $2400

Now, we add the amount she spent on tomato seeds to the amount she spent on celery seeds to find the total amount she spent:

$800 (for tomato seeds) + $2400 (for celery seeds) = $3200

So, Mrs. Rylan spent a total of $3200 on seeds.
