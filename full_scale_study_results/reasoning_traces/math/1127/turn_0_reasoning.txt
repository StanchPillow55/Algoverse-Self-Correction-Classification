Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to find out how fast the 2nd fastest car can go. We know that the 2nd fastest car is 5 times faster than the average car. So, we multiply the speed of the average car by 5.

120 mph * 5 = 600 mph

So, the 2nd fastest car can go 600 miles per hour.

Next, we need to find out how fast the fastest car can go. We know that the fastest car is 1.25 times faster than the 2nd fastest car. So, we multiply the speed of the 2nd fastest car by 1.25.

600 mph * 1.25 = 750 mph

So, the fastest car can go 750 miles per hour.

Therefore, the fastest car can go 750 miles per hour.
