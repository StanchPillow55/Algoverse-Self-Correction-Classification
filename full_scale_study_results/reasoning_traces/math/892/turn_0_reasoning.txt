Question ID: 892
Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to find out how much the yogurt costs. Since it's stated that the yogurt is half the price of the salad, and the salad costs $6, the yogurt would cost $6/2 = $3.

Now, we know that the salad and the yogurt together cost $6 + $3 = $9.

If Ellen pays $11 in total for her food every day, and we know that the salad and the yogurt cost $9, then the two carrots must cost $11 - $9 = $2.

Since the $2 is the cost for two carrots, then the cost of one carrot must be $2/2 = $1.

So, Ellen pays $1 for one carrot every day.
