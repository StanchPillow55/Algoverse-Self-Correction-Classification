==================================================

I'm afraid I don't have enough information to solve a specific math problem based on the given passage. The passage is about the Italian soccer player Fabio Cannavaro rejoining the Juventus soccer club after playing for Real Madrid for three years. It does not contain any numerical data or math-related information that I can use to solve a math problem. Without a clear math-based question or problem statement, I cannot provide a step-by-step solution. I apologize, but I am unable to solve a math problem in this case. Please provide a more specific math-related question or problem statement for me to work on.
