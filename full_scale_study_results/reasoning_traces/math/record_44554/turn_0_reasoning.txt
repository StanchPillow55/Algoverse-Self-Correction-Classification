==================================================

To solve this problem, I will need to analyze the given passage and the query to determine the missing information.

Given information:
- Fabio Cannavaro, the Italy captain, is rejoining Juventus after three years at Real Madrid.
- The news of Cannavaro's return comes less than 24 hours after Juventus sacked their coach, Claudio Ranieri, and replaced him with Ciro Ferrara.
- Cannavaro, who is 35 years old, was voted world player of the year after leading Italy to World Cup glory in 2006 and has helped Real Madrid achieve two title triumphs during his stay in Spain.
- The query mentions that Juventus took advantage of the natural expiration of Cannavaro's contract to bring him back to Turin and that his technical abilities will help "@placeholder" become more competitive.

To answer the query, we need to determine the missing information, which is the "@placeholder" in the query.

Based on the context provided in the passage, the most logical placeholder would be the team or organization that Juventus represents, which is likely Juventus itself.

Therefore, the complete sentence
