==================================================

First, we need to convert the current height of the bamboo from feet to inches because the growth rate is given in inches and the desired height is also in inches. 

We know that 1 foot is equal to 12 inches. So, 20 feet is equal to 20 * 12 = 240 inches.

The bamboo is currently 240 inches tall and we want it to grow to 600 inches. Therefore, it needs to grow an additional 600 - 240 = 360 inches.

The bamboo grows at a rate of 30 inches per day. Therefore, to grow an additional 360 inches, it will take 360 / 30 = 12 days.

So, it will take 12 days for the bamboo to reach a height of 600 inches.
