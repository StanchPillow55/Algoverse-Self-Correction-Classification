Question ID: 674
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to convert the current height of the bamboo from feet to inches because the growth rate is given in inches. We know that 1 foot is equal to 12 inches. 

So, the current height of the bamboo in inches is 20 feet * 12 inches/foot = 240 inches.

The bamboo needs to grow to 600 inches, so the total growth needed is 600 inches - 240 inches = 360 inches.

Since the bamboo grows at a rate of 30 inches per day, we can find out how many days it will take for the bamboo to reach 600 inches by dividing the total growth needed by the growth rate per day.

So, the number of days needed is 360 inches / 30 inches/day = 12 days.

Therefore, it will take 12 days for Mrs. Jameson's bamboo to reach a height of 600 inches.
