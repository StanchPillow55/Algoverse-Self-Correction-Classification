Question ID: 674
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to convert the current height of the bamboo from feet to inches because the growth rate is given in inches and the final height is also given in inches. We know that 1 foot is equal to 12 inches. So, 20 feet is equal to 20 * 12 = 240 inches.

Next, we need to find out how many more inches the bamboo needs to grow to reach 600 inches. We do this by subtracting the current height from the final height. So, 600 - 240 = 360 inches.

Now, we know that the bamboo grows 30 inches a day. So, to find out how many days it will take for the bamboo to grow 360 inches, we divide 360 by 30. 

360 / 30 = 12 days.

So, it will take 12 days for Mrs. Jameson's bamboo to grow from 20 feet to 600 inches.
