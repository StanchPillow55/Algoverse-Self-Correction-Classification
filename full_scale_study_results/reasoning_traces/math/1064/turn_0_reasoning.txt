==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to add up the total number of classes that visited the Science Center each day from Monday to Friday.

On Monday, 32 classes visited.

On Tuesday, twice as many classes visited as on Monday. So, we multiply the number of classes on Monday by 2: 32 * 2 = 64 classes.

On Wednesday, three times as many classes visited as on Monday. So, we multiply the number of classes on Monday by 3: 32 * 3 = 96 classes.

On Thursday, 30 classes visited.

On Friday, 25 classes visited.

Now, we add up all the classes from each day to get the total number of classes that visited the Science Center last week:

Monday: 32 classes
Tuesday: 64 classes
Wednesday: 96 classes
Thursday: 30 classes
Friday: 25 classes

Total = 32 + 64 + 96 + 30 + 25 = 247 classes

So, 247 classes visited the Science Center last week.
