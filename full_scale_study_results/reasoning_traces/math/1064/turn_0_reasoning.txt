To find the total number of classes that visited the Science Center last week, we will calculate the number of classes that visited each day from Monday to Friday and then sum these amounts.

1. **Monday**: 
   - The problem states that 32 classes visited on Monday.
   - So, the number of classes on Monday is:
     \[
     \text{Classes on Monday} = 32
     \]

2. **Tuesday**: 
   - It states that twice as many classes visited on Tuesday compared to Monday.
   - Therefore, the number of classes on Tuesday is:
     \[
     \text{Classes on Tuesday} = 2 \times 32 = 64
     \]

3. **Wednesday**: 
   - The problem indicates that three times as many classes visited on Wednesday compared to Monday.
   - Thus, the number of classes on Wednesday is:
     \[
     \text{Classes on Wednesday} = 3 \times 32 = 96
     \]

4. **Thursday**: 
   - It is given that 30 classes visited on Thursday.
   - So, the number of classes on Thursday is:
     \[
     \text{Classes on Thursday} = 30
     \]

5. **Friday**: 
   - The problem states that 25 classes visited on Friday.
   - Therefore, the number of classes on Friday is:
     \[
     \text{Classes on Friday} = 25
     \]

Now, we will sum the number of classes from each day to find the total number of classes that visited the Science Center last week.

\[
\text{Total Classes} = \text{Classes on Monday} + \text{Classes on Tuesday} + \text{Classes on Wednesday} + \text{Classes on Thursday} + \text{Classes on Friday}
\]

Substituting the values we calculated:

\[
\text{Total Classes} = 32 + 64 + 96 + 30 + 25
\]

Now, we will perform the addition step by step:

1. Adding Monday and Tuesday:
   \[
   32 + 64 = 96
   \]

2. Adding the result to Wednesday:
   \[
   96 + 96 = 192
   \]

3. Adding Thursday:
   \[
   192 + 30 = 222
   \]

4. Finally, adding Friday:
   \[
   222 + 25 = 247
   \]

Thus, the total number of classes that visited the Science Center last week is:

\[
\boxed{247}
\]
