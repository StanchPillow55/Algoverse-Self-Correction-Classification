Question ID: 429
Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to find out half of the letters in Indras' name. Since Indras' name has 6 letters, half of that is 6/2 = 3 letters.

The problem states that Indras' sister's name has 4 more letters than half of the letters in Indras' name. So, we add 4 to the 3 letters we calculated earlier. That gives us 3 + 4 = 7 letters.

Now, we need to find out how many letters are in both Indras and her sister's names. To do this, we add the number of letters in Indras' name to the number of letters in her sister's name. This gives us 6 + 7 = 13 letters.

So, there are 13 letters in Indras and her sister's names.
