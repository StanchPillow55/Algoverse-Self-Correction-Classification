To solve this problem, we need to find the value of the placeholder in the given passage.

Given information:
- Branislav Ivanovic scored an important goal for Chelsea in a 1-1 draw against PSG in the Champions League.
- John Terry praised Ivanovic's goal-scoring ability, attributing it to his "desire", "hunger", "aggression", and "strength".
- The passage mentions that Ivanovic also scored an important goal in the Capital One Cup semi-final.

The placeholder in the query is "@placeholder", which represents the name of the opposing team's defender that Ivanovic rose above to score the goal.
