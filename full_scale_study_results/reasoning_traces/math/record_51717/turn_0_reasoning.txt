==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given information and apply mathematical concepts to determine the final answer.

Given information:
- Ivanovic scored an important goal for Chelsea in the 36th minute of the match against PSG.
- The match ended in a 1-1 draw.

Step 1: Identify the relevant mathematical concepts.
In this problem, we need to consider the concept of time and the scoring of a goal.

Step 2: Represent the information in a mathematical form.
Let's represent the time of the goal as a variable, t, where t = 36 minutes.

Step 3: Perform the necessary calculations.
Since the match ended in a 1-1 draw, we can conclude that the final score was:
Chelsea: 1 goal
PSG: 1 goal

Therefore, Ivanovic's goal in the 36th minute gave Chelsea the lead at that point in the match.

Step 4: Provide the final answer.
The final answer is:
Ivanovic rises above @placeholder's defence to give his side the lead in the 36th minute.
