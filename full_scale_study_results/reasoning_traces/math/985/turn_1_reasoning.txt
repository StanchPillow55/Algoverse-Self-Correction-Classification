Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine how many pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a week, given that Edgar eats 18 pretzels a day and his brother eats half as many.

**Step 1: Determine how many pretzels Edgar's brother eats in one day.**

Edgar eats 18 pretzels a day. His brother eats half as many pretzels as Edgar. To find out how many pretzels his brother eats in one day, we calculate:

\[
\text{Pretzels eaten by brother per day} = \frac{1}{2} \times 18 = 9
\]

So, Edgar's brother eats 9 pretzels per day.

**Step 2: Calculate how many pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a week.**

There are 7 days in a week. To find out how many pretzels Edgar's brother eats in a week, we multiply the number of pretzels he eats per day by the number of days in a week:

\[
\text{Pretzels eaten by brother per week} = 9 \times 7 = 63
\]

Therefore, Edgar's brother eats 63 pretzels in a week.

**Final Answer:**

Edgar's brother eats 63 pretzels in a week.
