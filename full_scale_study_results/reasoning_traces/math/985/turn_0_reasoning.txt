Dataset Type: math
==================================================

Edgar eats 18 pretzels a day. If his brother eats half as many, that means his brother eats 18/2 = 9 pretzels a day.

There are 7 days in a week. So, if Edgar's brother eats 9 pretzels a day, in a week he would eat 9*7 = 63 pretzels.

So, Edgar's brother eats 63 pretzels in a week.
