Question ID: 60
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, let's find out how many oranges are unripe. Since 20% of the oranges are unripe, we multiply 25 (the total number of oranges) by 20% (or 0.20 in decimal form):

25 * 0.20 = 5 oranges are unripe.

We know that 1 orange is bad and 2 oranges are sour. So, we add these to the unripe oranges to find out how many oranges are not good:

5 (unripe) + 1 (bad) + 2 (sour) = 8 oranges are not good.

To find out how many oranges are good, we subtract the number of not good oranges from the total number of oranges:

25 (total) - 8 (not good) = 17 oranges are good.

So, there are 17 good oranges in the basket.
