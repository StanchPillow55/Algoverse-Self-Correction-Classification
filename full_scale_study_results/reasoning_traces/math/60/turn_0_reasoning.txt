Question ID: 60
Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, let's identify the total number of oranges, which is 25.

Next, we need to calculate the number of unripe oranges. We know that 20% of the oranges are unripe. To find this, we multiply the total number of oranges by 20% (or 0.20):

25 * 0.20 = 5 oranges are unripe.

We also know that 1 orange is bad and 2 oranges are sour.

Now, to find the number of good oranges, we subtract the number of bad, unripe, and sour oranges from the total number of oranges:

25 (total oranges) - 1 (bad orange) - 5 (unripe oranges) - 2 (sour oranges) = 17 oranges are good.

So, there are 17 good oranges in the basket.
