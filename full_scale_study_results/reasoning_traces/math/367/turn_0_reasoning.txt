==================================================

Let's start by breaking down the information given in the problem.

We know that 3 customers were kicked out for refusing to wear masks.

Next, we're told that a number equal to four times the number of mask refusers minus 5 were kicked out for shoplifting. So, we can calculate the number of shoplifters as follows:

4 * 3 (mask refusers) - 5 = 12 - 5 = 7 shoplifters

Then, we're told that three times the number of shoplifters were kicked out for physical violence. So, we can calculate the number of violent customers as follows:

3 * 7 (shoplifters) = 21 violent customers

So far, we have 3 mask refusers, 7 shoplifters, and 21 violent customers, for a total of:

3 (mask refusers) + 7 (shoplifters) + 21 (violent customers) = 31 people kicked out for these reasons

We're told that a total of 50 people were kicked out, so to find the number of people kicked out for other reasons, we subtract the number we've already accounted for from the total:

50 (total kicked out) - 31 (kicked out for masks, shoplifting, or violence) = 19 people kicked out for other reasons

So, 19 people were kicked out of the Walmart for other reasons.
