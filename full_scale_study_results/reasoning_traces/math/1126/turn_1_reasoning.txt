Question ID: 1126
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to determine the distance that is half the way around the earth. Given that the circumference of the earth is 40,000 kilometers, half of this distance is 20,000 kilometers. This is because 40,000 kilometers divided by 2 equals 20,000 kilometers.

Next, we need to determine how many days it will take Alfie to fly this distance. Given that Alfie flies 400 kilometers every day, we can find the number of days by dividing the total distance by the distance Alfie flies each day.

So, 20,000 kilometers divided by 400 kilometers per day equals 50 days.

Therefore, it will take Alfie 50 days to fly a distance equal to half of the way around the earth.
