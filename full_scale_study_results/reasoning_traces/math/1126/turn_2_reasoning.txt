Question ID: 1126
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we first need to determine how far half the distance around the earth is. Since the circumference of the earth is 40,000 kilometers, half of that distance is 20,000 kilometers (40,000 km / 2 = 20,000 km).

Next, we need to figure out how many days it will take Alfie to fly this distance. Since Alfie flies 400 kilometers each day, we divide the total distance by Alfie's daily distance to find the number of days it will take.

So, 20,000 km / 400 km/day = 50 days.

Therefore, it will take Alfie 50 days to fly a distance equal to half of the way around the earth.
