Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to determine the distance that is half the way around the earth. Since the circumference of the earth is 40,000 kilometers, half of this distance is 40,000/2 = 20,000 kilometers.

Next, we need to figure out how many days it will take Alfie to fly this distance. Since Alfie flies 400 kilometers every day, we divide the total distance by the distance he flies each day to find the number of days it will take.

So, 20,000 kilometers รท 400 kilometers/day = 50 days.

Therefore, it will take Alfie 50 days to fly a distance equal to half of the way around the earth.
