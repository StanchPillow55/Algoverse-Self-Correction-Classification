==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given information and apply logical reasoning to determine the final answer.

Given information:
- Ukraine's forces are weaker than Russia's forces.
- There are arguments on both sides about whether to send military aid to Ukraine.
- Providing military aid to Ukraine could lead to an escalation from Russia.

However, not providing any military aid to Ukraine could be seen as condoning Putin's actions and the Russian invasion of
