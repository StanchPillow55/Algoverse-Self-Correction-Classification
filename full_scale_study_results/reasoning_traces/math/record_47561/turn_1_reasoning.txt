==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given information and apply logical reasoning to determine the validity of the statement.

Given information:
- Ukraine's forces are weaker than Russia's forces.
- There are arguments on both sides about whether to send military aid to Ukraine.
- Providing military aid to Ukraine could lead to an escalation from Russia.
- Doing nothing would condone Putin's actions.

Reasoning:
1. Ukraine's forces are weaker than Russia's forces:
   - This suggests that Ukraine would be at a disadvantage in a direct military confrontation with Russia.
   - Providing Ukraine with greater firepower could help balance the military capabilities between the two sides.

2. Arguments on both sides about sending military aid to Ukraine:
   - The argument for sending military aid is that it could help Ukraine hold its own against the Russia-supported rebel fighters.
   - The argument against sending military aid is that it could provoke an escalation from Russia.

3. Providing military aid to Ukraine could lead to an escalation from Russia:
   - This is a valid concern, as Russia may view the increased military capabilities of Ukraine as a threat and respond with further aggression.
