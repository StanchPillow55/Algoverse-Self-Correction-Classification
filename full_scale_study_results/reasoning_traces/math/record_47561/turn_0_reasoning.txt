==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given information and determine the appropriate mathematical operations to arrive at the final answer.

Given information:
- Ukraine's forces are much weaker than Russia's forces.
- Equipping Kiev (Ukraine's capital) with greater firepower might provoke an escalation from Russia.
- Russia's forces grossly outnumber those of Ukraine.

The key question is to determine the relationship between the size of Ukraine's forces and Russia's forces.

Let's represent the size of Ukraine's forces as "U" and the size of Russia's forces as "R".

We know that Russia's forces grossly outnumber those of Ukraine, which means that R is much greater than U.

We can express this mathematically as:
R >> U

This means that the size of Russia's forces is significantly larger than the size of Ukraine's forces.

Therefore, the statement "Equipping Kiev with greater firepower might well provoke an escalation from Russia, whose forces grossly outnumber those of @placeholder" is correct.

The placeholder "@placeholder" in the statement refers to Ukraine, as it is the country whose forces are being compared to Russia's forces.

Final
