To solve this problem, we need to determine the meaning of the placeholder "@placeholder" in the given query.

Given information:
- Israel and Hamas have agreed to a 12-hour cease-fire in Gaza starting Saturday morning.
- The cease-fire is intended to be used for moving in medical supplies and taking out injured people.
- The parties hope to enter formal negotiations on a more permanent truce that addresses economic, political, and security concerns about @placeholder, with other nations involved.

Based on the context, the placeholder "@placeholder" likely refers to the Gaza Strip or the conflict between Israel and Hamas in the Gaza Strip.

The query is asking about the parties' hopes to enter formal negotiations on a more permanent truce that addresses the economic, political, and security concerns about the Gaza Strip, with other nations involved.

Therefore, the final answer to the query is:

If the 12-hour cease-fire can be achieved, the parties hope they can enter formal negotiations on a more permanent truce that addresses economic, political, and security concerns about the Gaza Strip, with other nations involved.
