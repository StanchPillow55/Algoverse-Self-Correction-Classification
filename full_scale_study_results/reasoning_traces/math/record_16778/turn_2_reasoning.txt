Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, I will break it down step-by-step:

1. The passage states that Israel and Hamas have agreed to a 12-hour ceasefire starting Saturday morning. This ceasefire is intended to be used for moving in medical supplies and taking out injured people.

2. The passage also mentions that the parties hope to enter formal negotiations on a more permanent truce that addresses economic, political and security concerns about @placeholder, with other nations involved.

3. The key information needed to answer the query is the identity of the @placeholder. Based on the context, the @placeholder is likely referring to Gaza, the region where the conflict between Israel and Hamas is taking place.

4. Therefore, the final answer is:

If the 12-hour ceasefire can be achieved, the parties hope they can enter formal negotiations on a more permanent truce that addresses economic, political and security concerns about Gaza, with other nations involved.
