To solve this problem, we need to analyze the information provided in the passage and determine what changed in Richard Dart's (also known as Salahuddin al-Britani) life by the following year.

Given information:
- In 2010, Robb Leech spent a year filming his stepbrother Richard Dart after he turned his back on the world he grew up in to become a fundamentalist Muslim called Salahuddin.
- The passage mentions that "by the following year, things had changed dramatically in @placeholder's life."

Step 1: Identify the timeline of events.
- 2010: Robb Leech spent a year filming his stepbrother Richard Dart after he converted to Islam and changed his name to Salahuddin.
- "By the following year": This refers to the year after 2010, which would be 2011.

Step 2: Analyze the changes that occurred in Richard Dart's (Salahuddin's) life by 2011.
Based on the information provided in the passage, we can infer that by 2011, the following changes occurred in Richard Dart's life
