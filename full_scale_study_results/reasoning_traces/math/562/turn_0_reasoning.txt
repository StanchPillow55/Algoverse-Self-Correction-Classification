==================================================

The sun starts at the tip of the pyramid, which is at an angle of 32 degrees from the ground. The sun moves at a rate of 5 degrees per hour straight upward from the pyramid. 

If the sun moves for 10 hours, the total degrees it will move is 5 degrees/hour * 10 hours = 50 degrees.

Since the sun's movement is straight upward from the pyramid, we add the degrees it moves to the initial angle of the pyramid from the ground. 

So, the total degrees from the ground to the sun after 10 hours will be 32 degrees + 50 degrees = 82 degrees.

Therefore, there will be 82 degrees from the ground to the sun after 10 hours.
