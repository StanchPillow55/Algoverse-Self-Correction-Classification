Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

The sun starts at the tip of the pyramid, which is at an angle of 32 degrees from the ground. The sun then moves straight upward from the pyramid at a rate of 5 degrees per hour for 10 hours.

To find the final angle from the ground to the sun, we need to add the initial angle of the pyramid to the total amount the sun moves. The sun moves a total of 5 degrees/hour * 10 hours = 50 degrees.

So, the final angle from the ground to the sun is 32 degrees + 50 degrees = 82 degrees.

Therefore, there will be 82 degrees from the ground to the sun after 10 hours.
