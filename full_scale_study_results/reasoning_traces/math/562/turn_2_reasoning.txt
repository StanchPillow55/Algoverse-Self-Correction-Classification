Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

The sun is moving at a rate of 5 degrees per hour. If it moves for 10 hours, the total movement will be 5 degrees/hour * 10 hours = 50 degrees.

The sun started at the tip of the pyramid, which is 32 degrees from the ground. So, to find the final angle from the ground to the sun, we add the initial angle to the total movement of the sun.

So, 32 degrees + 50 degrees = 82 degrees.

Therefore, there will be 82 degrees from the ground to the sun after 10 hours.
