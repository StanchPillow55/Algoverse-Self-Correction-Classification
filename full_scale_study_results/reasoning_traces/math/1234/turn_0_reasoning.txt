==================================================

To find out how many novels Regina has written this year, we start by interpreting the information given in the problem.

1. **Understanding the relationship**: The problem states that Regina wrote 9 novels last year, and this number (9 novels) represents 3 quarters (or \( \frac{3}{4} \)) of the number of novels she has written this year.

2. **Setting up the equation**: Let \( x \) be the number of novels Regina has written this year. According to the problem, we can express the relationship as:
   \[
   \frac{3}{4} x = 9
   \]

3. **Solving for \( x \)**: To find \( x \), we need to isolate it. We can do this by multiplying both sides of the equation by \( \frac{4}{3} \) to get rid of the fraction:
   \[
   x = 9 \times \frac{4}{3}
   \]

4. **Calculating the right side**:
   - First, calculate \( 9 \times 4 \):
     \[
     9 \times 4 = 36
     \]
   - Next, divide by 3:
     \[
     \frac{36}{3} = 12
     \]

5. **Conclusion**: Therefore, the number of novels Regina has written this year is:
   \[
   x = 12
   \]

Thus, the final answer is that Regina has written **12 novels this year**.
