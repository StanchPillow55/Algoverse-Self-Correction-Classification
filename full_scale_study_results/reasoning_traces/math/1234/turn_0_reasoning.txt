==================================================

The problem states that the number of novels Regina wrote last year, which is 9, is 3 quarters (or 3/4) of the number of novels she has written this year. 

We can set up the equation as follows:

3/4 * X = 9

Where X is the number of novels Regina has written this year. 

To solve for X, we can divide both sides of the equation by 3/4. 

Doing this, we get:

X = 9 / (3/4)

To simplify this, we can multiply the numerator and the denominator by 4 to get rid of the fraction in the denominator:

X = 9 * 4 / 3

This simplifies to:

X = 36 / 3

Which further simplifies to:

X = 12

So, Regina has written 12 novels this year.
