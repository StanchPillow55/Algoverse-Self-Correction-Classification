Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of novels Regina has written this year, given that the 9 novels she wrote last year represent 3 quarters (or \(\frac{3}{4}\)) of the novels she wrote this year.

Let's denote the number of novels Regina wrote this year as \( x \).

According to the problem, 9 novels is \(\frac{3}{4}\) of the novels she wrote this year. We can express this relationship with the equation:

\[
\frac{3}{4} \times x = 9
\]

To find \( x \), we need to solve this equation. We can do this by isolating \( x \) on one side of the equation. To eliminate the fraction, we multiply both sides of the equation by the reciprocal of \(\frac{3}{4}\), which is \(\frac{4}{3}\):

\[
x = 9 \times \frac{4}{3}
\]

Now, we perform the multiplication:

\[
x = 9 \times \frac{4}{3} = \frac{9 \times 4}{3} = \frac{36}{3} = 12
\]

Thus, Regina has written 12 novels this year.

Final Answer: Regina has written 12 novels this year.
