Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, let's calculate how many miles John travels each day, week, and year.

Each day, he travels 30 miles to work and 30 miles back, so that's 30 miles * 2 = 60 miles per day.

Each week, he travels 60 miles * 5 days = 300 miles.

Each year, he travels 300 miles * 50 weeks = 15,000 miles.

Now, let's calculate how much he pays for the miles driven each year.

He pays $2 per mile, so for 15,000 miles, he pays 15,000 miles * $2/mile = $30,000.

Next, let's calculate how much he pays in bonuses each year.

He gives his driver a $150 bonus each month, so over a year (12 months), he pays 12 months * $150/month = $1,800 in bonuses.

Finally, let's add up the cost of the miles driven and the bonuses to find the total amount John pays each year.

He pays $30,000 for the miles driven and $1,800 in bonuses, so in total, he pays $30,000 + $1,800 = $31,800 per year for driving. 

So, the final answer is $31,800.
