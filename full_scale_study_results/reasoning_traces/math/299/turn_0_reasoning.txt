First, let's calculate how many miles John travels each day and then each week. 

He travels 30 miles to work and 30 miles back, so that's 30 miles * 2 = <<30*2=60>>60 miles each day.

Since he works 5 days a week, he travels 60 miles/day * 5 days/week = <<60*5=300>>300 miles each week.

Now, let's calculate how many miles he travels in a year. Since he works 50 weeks a year, he travels 300 miles/week * 50 weeks/year = <<300*50=15000>>15,000 miles in a year.

Since he gets charged $2 per mile driven, he pays 15,000 miles * $2/mile = $<<15000*2=30000>>30,000 for the miles driven in a year.

Next, let's calculate how much he pays in bonuses each year. Since there are 12 months in a year, he pays $150/month * 12 months/year = $<<150*12=1800>>1,800 in bonuses each year.

Finally, let's add the cost of the miles driven and the bonuses to find out how much he pays in total each year. He pays $30,000 for the miles driven + $1,800 in bonuses = $<<30000+1800=31800>>31,800 per year. 

So, John pays $31,800 per year for driving.
