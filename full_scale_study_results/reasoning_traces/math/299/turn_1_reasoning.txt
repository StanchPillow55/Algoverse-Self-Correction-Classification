Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, let's calculate how many miles John travels each day. Since his work is 30 miles away and he has to go there and back, he travels 30 miles * 2 = 60 miles each day.

Next, let's calculate how many miles he travels each week. Since he goes to work 5 days a week, he travels 60 miles/day * 5 days/week = 300 miles each week.

Then, let's calculate how many miles he travels each year. Since he goes to work for 50 weeks a year, he travels 300 miles/week * 50 weeks/year = 15,000 miles each year.

Now, let's calculate how much he pays for the miles he travels each year. Since he gets charged $2 per mile driven, he pays 15,000 miles/year * $2/mile = $30,000/year.

Next, let's calculate how much he pays for the driver's bonus each year. Since he gives his driver a $150 bonus per month and there are 12 months in a year, he pays $150/month * 12 months/year = $1,800/year.

Finally, let's add the cost of the miles he travels and the driver's bonus to find out how much he pays a year for driving. He pays $30,000/year + $1,800/year = $31,800/year.

So, John pays $31,800 a year for driving.
