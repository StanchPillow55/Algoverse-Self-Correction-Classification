Let's denote the total number of cards Kenny had initially as X.

According to the problem, Kenny keeps 1/3 of his cards, which means he sells 2/3 of his cards.

The money he gets from selling his cards is used to buy a ticket to an amusement park and also leaves him with $50 in spending cash. The total amount of money he gets from selling his cards is therefore $100 (the cost of the ticket) + $50 (spending cash) = $150.

Since he sells each card for $1.5, the number of cards he sells is the total money he gets divided by the price per card. Therefore, he sells $150 / $1.5 = 100 cards.

But these 100 cards represent 2/3 of his total collection (since he sells 2/3 of his cards). Therefore, we can set up the following equation to find the total number of cards Kenny had initially:

2/3 * X = 100

To solve for X, we multiply both sides of the equation by the reciprocal of 2/3, which is 3/2:

X = 100 * 3/2 = 150

Therefore, Kenny initially had 150 Pokemon cards.
