==================================================

First, we need to calculate how much Alicia spends on dry-cleaning per week. 

She sends 5 blouses to the dry cleaners each week, and each blouse costs $5.00 to clean. So, the cost for the blouses is 5 blouses * $5.00/blouse = $25.00.

She also sends 2 pants to the dry cleaners each week, and each pair of pants costs $8.00 to clean. So, the cost for the pants is 2 pants * $8.00/pants = $16.00.

Finally, she sends 1 skirt to the dry cleaners each week, and each skirt costs $6.00 to clean. So, the cost for the skirt is 1 skirt * $6.00/skirt = $6.00.

Adding these amounts together, we find that Alicia spends $25.00 + $16.00 + $6.00 = $47.00 on dry-cleaning per week.

To find out how much she spends in 5 weeks, we multiply the weekly cost by 5: $47.00/week * 5 weeks = $235.00.

So, Alicia spends $235.00 on dry-cleaning in 5 weeks.
