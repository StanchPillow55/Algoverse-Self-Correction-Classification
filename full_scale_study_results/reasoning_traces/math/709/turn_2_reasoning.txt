Question ID: 709
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to find out how many quarts of each type of ice cream the factory can produce in one hour. 

For the chocolate ice cream, the factory produces 100 quarts in 2 hours. So, in one hour, it produces 100/2 = 50 quarts of chocolate ice cream.

For the vanilla ice cream, the factory produces 50 quarts in 4 hours. So, in one hour, it produces 50/4 = 12.5 quarts of vanilla ice cream.

Now, we know how much of each type of ice cream the factory can produce in one hour. To find out how much it can produce in 48 hours, we simply multiply these hourly rates by 48.

For the chocolate ice cream, the factory can produce 50 * 48 = 2400 quarts in 48 hours.

For the vanilla ice cream, the factory can produce 12.5 * 48 = 600 quarts in 48 hours.

Finally, to find the total amount of ice cream produced in 48 hours, we add these two amounts together: 2400 + 600 = 3000 quarts.

So, the factory can produce a total of 3000 quarts of ice cream in 48 hours.
