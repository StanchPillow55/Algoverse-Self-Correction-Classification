==================================================

First, we need to determine how many quarts of each type of ice cream the factory can produce in one hour.

For the chocolate ice cream, the factory makes 100 quarts in 2 hours. So, in one hour, it can make 100 quarts / 2 hours = 50 quarts of chocolate ice cream.

For the vanilla ice cream, the factory makes 50 quarts in 4 hours. So, in one hour, it can make 50 quarts / 4 hours = 12.5 quarts of vanilla ice cream.

Now, we know how much of each type of ice cream the factory can produce in one hour. To find out how much it can produce in 48 hours, we simply multiply these hourly rates by 48.

For the chocolate ice cream, the factory can produce 50 quarts/hour * 48 hours = 2400 quarts in 48 hours.

For the vanilla ice cream, the factory can produce 12.5 quarts/hour * 48 hours = 600 quarts in 48 hours.

Finally, to find the total amount of ice cream produced in 48 hours, we add these two amounts together:

2400 quarts (chocolate) + 600 quarts (vanilla) = 3000 quarts

So, the ice cream factory can produce a total of 3000 quarts of ice cream in 48 hours.
