Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to determine how many quarts of each type of ice cream the factory can produce in one hour. 

For the chocolate ice cream, the factory makes 100 quarts in 2 hours. So, in one hour, the factory can produce 100 quarts / 2 hours = 50 quarts of chocolate ice cream.

For the vanilla ice cream, the factory makes 50 quarts in 4 hours. So, in one hour, the factory can produce 50 quarts / 4 hours = 12.5 quarts of vanilla ice cream.

Now, we need to determine how many quarts of each type of ice cream the factory can produce in 48 hours. 

For the chocolate ice cream, the factory can produce 50 quarts/hour * 48 hours = 2400 quarts of chocolate ice cream in 48 hours.

For the vanilla ice cream, the factory can produce 12.5 quarts/hour * 48 hours = 600 quarts of vanilla ice cream in 48 hours.

Finally, to find the total amount of ice cream produced in 48 hours, we add the amounts of chocolate and vanilla ice cream together: 2400 quarts + 600 quarts = 3000 quarts.

So, the ice cream factory would make 3000 quarts in total in 48 hours.
