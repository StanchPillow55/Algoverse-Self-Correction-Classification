==================================================

First, we need to calculate the total area of the walls that Tony is going to paint. 

The area of a rectangle is calculated by multiplying the length by the width. 

So, the area of the north and south walls is 10 feet * 8 feet = 80 square feet each. Since there are two of these walls, their total area is 2 * 80 square feet = 160 square feet.

Similarly, the area of the east and west walls is 5 feet * 8 feet = 40 square feet each. Since there are two of these walls, their total area is 2 * 40 square feet = 80 square feet.

Adding these together, the total area to be painted is 160 square feet + 80 square feet = 240 square feet.

Next, we need to figure out how many gallons of paint Tony needs. Since one gallon of paint covers 20 square feet, Tony will need 240 square feet / 20 square feet/gallon = 12 gallons of paint.

Finally, we need to calculate the total cost of the paint. Since each gallon of paint costs $12, the total cost will be 12 gallons * $12/gallon = $144.

So, it will cost Tony $144 to paint the room.
