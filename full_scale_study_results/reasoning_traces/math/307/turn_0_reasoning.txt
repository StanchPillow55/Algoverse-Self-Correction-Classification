Dataset Type: math
==================================================

Given that Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks, this means that Joey loses 2 pounds per week (8 pounds รท 4 weeks = 2 pounds/week).

Sandy, on the other hand, needs 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in a single week. Since Joey loses 2 pounds per week, this means that Sandy loses 2 pounds every 4 weeks.

To find out how many weeks it will take Sandy to lose 8 pounds, we can set up the following equation:

2 pounds/4 weeks = 8 pounds/x weeks

Solving for x gives us:

x = (8 pounds * 4 weeks) / 2 pounds = 16 weeks

Therefore, it will take Sandy 16 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in 4 weeks.
