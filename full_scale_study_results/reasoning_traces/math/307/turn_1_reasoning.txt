Question ID: 307
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks, which means he loses 2 pounds per week (8 pounds รท 4 weeks = 2 pounds/week).

Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in a single week. So, Sandy loses 2 pounds in 4 weeks (2 pounds/week x 4 weeks = 2 pounds).

Therefore, to lose 8 pounds, the same amount Joey loses in 4 weeks, Sandy will need 4 times as long (8 pounds รท 2 pounds/4 weeks = 16 weeks).

So, it will take Sandy 16 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in 4 weeks.
