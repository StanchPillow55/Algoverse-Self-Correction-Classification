Question ID: 307
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks, which means he loses 2 pounds per week (8 pounds / 4 weeks = 2 pounds/week).

Sandy needs 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in a single week. So, if Joey loses 2 pounds in a week, Sandy will need 4 weeks to lose 2 pounds.

Therefore, to lose 8 pounds (the same amount Joey lost in 4 weeks), Sandy will need 4 times as many weeks as Joey. This is because Sandy loses weight at a quarter of the rate that Joey does.

So, Sandy will need 4 weeks * 4 = 16 weeks to lose 8 pounds. 

Final Answer: It will take Sandy 16 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in 4 weeks.
