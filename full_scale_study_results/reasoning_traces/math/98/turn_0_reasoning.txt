==================================================

Let's denote the number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes as X.

We know that in the second 15 minutes, 20 more cars drove through the traffic jam. So, the total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam is X + 20.

We also know that 5 cars took an exit and didn't drive through the traffic jam. So, the total number of cars that either drove through the traffic jam or took an exit is X + 20 + 5.

According to the problem, there were originally 30 cars on the motorway. So, we can set up the following equation:

X + 20 + 5 = 30

Solving this equation for X gives:

X = 30 - 20 - 5
X = 10 - 5
X = 5

So, 5 cars drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes.
