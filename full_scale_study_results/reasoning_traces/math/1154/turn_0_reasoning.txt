Dataset Type: math
==================================================

Mason eats 4 carrots each on weekdays. Since there are 5 weekdays (Monday to Friday), the total number of carrots he eats on weekdays is 4 carrots/day * 5 days = 20 carrots.

On weekends, which consist of Saturday and Sunday, he eats 5 carrots each day. So, the total number of carrots he eats on weekends is 5 carrots/day * 2 days = 10 carrots.

To find out how many carrots he eats in a week, we add the number of carrots he eats on weekdays to the number of carrots he eats on weekends. So, 20 carrots (weekdays) + 10 carrots (weekends) = 30 carrots.

Therefore, Mason eats 30 carrots in a week.
