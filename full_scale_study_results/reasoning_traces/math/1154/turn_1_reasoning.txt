Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to calculate how many carrots Mason eats on weekdays and how many he eats on the weekend, then add these two amounts together.

First, let's calculate the weekday consumption. There are 5 weekdays in a week (Monday through Friday), and Mason eats 4 carrots each day. So, we multiply the number of weekdays by the number of carrots he eats each weekday:

5 weekdays * 4 carrots/weekday = 20 carrots

Next, let's calculate the weekend consumption. There are 2 days in a weekend (Saturday and Sunday), and Mason eats 5 carrots each day. So, we multiply the number of weekend days by the number of carrots he eats each weekend day:

2 weekend days * 5 carrots/weekend day = 10 carrots

Finally, we add the number of carrots he eats on weekdays to the number of carrots he eats on the weekend to find the total number of carrots he eats in a week:

20 carrots (weekdays) + 10 carrots (weekend) = 30 carrots

So, Mason eats 30 carrots in a week.
