Dataset Type: math
==================================================

Let's start by finding out how much Juice Box B and Juice Box C cost.

We know that Juice Box A costs 4 dollars.

According to the problem, Juice Box B is 5 dollars more than Juice Box A. So, to find the cost of Juice Box B, we add 5 dollars to the cost of Juice Box A:

4 dollars (Juice Box A) + 5 dollars = 9 dollars

So, Juice Box B costs 9 dollars.

The problem also tells us that Juice Box C is 7 dollars more than Juice Box A. So, to find the cost of Juice Box C, we add 7 dollars to the cost of Juice Box A:

4 dollars (Juice Box A) + 7 dollars = 11 dollars

So, Juice Box C costs 11 dollars.

Now, we need to find out how much more Juice Box C is than Juice Box B. To do this, we subtract the cost of Juice Box B from the cost of Juice Box C:

11 dollars (Juice Box C) - 9 dollars (Juice Box B) = 2 dollars

So, Juice Box C is 2 dollars more than Juice Box B. 

Final Answer: Juice Box C is 2 dollars more than Juice Box B.
