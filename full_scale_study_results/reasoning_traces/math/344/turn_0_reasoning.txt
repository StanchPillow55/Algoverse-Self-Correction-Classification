==================================================

To solve the problem, we will first determine the prices of Juice Box A, Juice Box B, and Juice Box C based on the information given.

1. **Price of Juice Box A**: 
   - Juice Box A costs 4 dollars.
   \[
   \text{Price of Juice Box A} = 4 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Price of Juice Box B**: 
   - Juice Box B is 5 dollars more than Juice Box A.
   \[
   \text{Price of Juice Box B} = \text{Price of Juice Box A} + 5 = 4 + 5 = 9 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Price of Juice Box C**: 
   - Juice Box C is 7 dollars more than Juice Box A.
   \[
   \text{Price of Juice Box C} = \text{Price of Juice Box A} + 7 = 4 + 7 = 11 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Finding how much more Juice Box C is than Juice Box B**: 
   - We need to calculate the difference in price between Juice Box C and Juice Box B.
   \[
   \text{Difference} = \text{Price of Juice Box C} - \text{Price of Juice Box B} = 11 - 9 = 2 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Thus, Juice Box C is 2 dollars more than Juice Box B.

**Final Answer**: Juice Box C is 2 dollars more than Juice Box B.
