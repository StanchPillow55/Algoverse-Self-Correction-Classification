==================================================

To find the name of the organization that supports the Bible school, I will carefully read through the paragraph and identify the relevant information.

The paragraph states:
"At least eight bombs were dropped in the area Wednesday during the school's first day of classes, according to a statement by Samaritan's Purse, Graham's Christian humanitarian group, which supports the school."

This clearly indicates that the organization that supports the Bible school is Samaritan's Purse, which is described as "Graham's Christian humanitarian group".

Therefore, the name of the organization that supports the Bible school is Samaritan's Purse.
