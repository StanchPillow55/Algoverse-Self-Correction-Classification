Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, I will carefully read through the given paragraph and extract the relevant information to determine the name of the organization that supports the Bible school.

Key information from the paragraph:
- A Christian evangelical group said a Bible school backed by American evangelist Franklin Graham was destroyed in a bombing raid in South Kordofan, Sudan.
- The statement was made by Samaritan's Purse, Graham's Christian humanitarian group, which supports the school.

Based on this information, the name of the organization that supports the Bible school is Samaritan's Purse.

The reasoning is as follows:
1. The paragraph states that a Christian evangelical group said the Bible school was destroyed.
2. It then specifies that the statement was made by Samaritan's Purse, which is described as Graham's Christian humanitarian group.
3. The paragraph also states that Samaritan's Purse supports the school.

Therefore, the name of the organization that supports the Bible school is Samaritan's Purse.

Final answer: Samaritan's Purse
