Question ID: 626
Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to convert Ashley's internet speed from kilobits per second (kb/s) to megabits per second (Mb/s). 

We know that 1 Mb = 1000 kb, so to convert 20 kb to Mb, we divide by 1000:

20 kb/s รท 1000 = 0.02 Mb/s

Next, we need to convert the speed from Mb per second to Mb per hour. 

We know that there are 3600 seconds in an hour, so we multiply the speed in Mb/s by 3600 to get the speed in Mb/hour:

0.02 Mb/s * 3600 s/h = 72 Mb/h

So, Ashley's internet connection speed is 72 Megabits per hour.
