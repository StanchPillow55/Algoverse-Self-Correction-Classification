I apologize, but I do not have enough information to solve a specific math problem based on the given passage. The passage discusses a political situation involving China, the United States, and the Dalai Lama, but does not contain any mathematical information or a clear math problem to solve.

As an AI assistant, I am not able to generate or solve arbitrary math problems without being provided the necessary details and context. If you have a specific math question you would like me to assist with, please provide the complete problem statement, including any relevant equations, variables, and numerical values. I would be happy to walk through the problem step-by-step, showing my work and reasoning, in order to arrive at the final answer. However, without a well-defined math problem, I cannot generate a meaningful solution. Please let me know if you have a specific math question you need help with.
