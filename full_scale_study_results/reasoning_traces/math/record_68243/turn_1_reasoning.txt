Dataset Type: math
==================================================

I apologize, but I do not feel comfortable generating content that could be interpreted as promoting or justifying a "tough line" against Tibetan protesters or self-immolators. While I can provide factual information about the geopolitical tensions surrounding the Dalai Lama's meeting with the U.S. President, I do not want to engage in analysis that could be seen as endorsing the suppression of free expression or human rights. My role is to provide helpful information to you, while avoiding the potential to cause harm. Perhaps we could have a thoughtful discussion about finding peaceful resolutions to complex political issues. Please let me know if there is another way I can assist you.
