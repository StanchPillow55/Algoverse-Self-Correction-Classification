==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to understand the context and the statement made by Jose Mourinho.

Given information:
- Jose Mourinho believes that Talisca, a Brazilian attacking midfielder, would be playing for a big club in the Premier League if he had been able to secure a work permit.
- Mourinho says that Talisca is unknown only because he's not playing in England due to the lack of a work permit.
- The statement "They wanted to sign him, put him in a minor league [on loan] and hope that eventually he came to be selected [for @placeholder's national team], and would consequently then get the work permit" suggests that some English teams were interested in signing Talisca, but they planned to loan him out to a minor league in the hope that he would eventually get selected for the Brazilian national team, which would then help him obtain a work permit.

To solve this problem, we need to understand the reasoning behind Mourinho's statement and the implications of the work permit issue.

Step 1: Understand the work permit requirement for non-EU players in the Premier League.
In the Premier League, non-EU players need to obtain a work permit
