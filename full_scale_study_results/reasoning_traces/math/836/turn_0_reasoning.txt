==================================================

Let's start by figuring out how many clay dishes Rory made. Since we know that Rory made 20 more clay dishes than Kora, and Kora made 20 dishes, we can add 20 to Kora's total to find out how many Rory made.

Rory's total = Kora's total + 20
Rory's total = 20 + 20
Rory's total = 40 dishes

Next, we need to find out how many dishes Jada made. We know that Jada made twice as many dishes as Rory, so we can multiply Rory's total by 2 to find out how many Jada made.

Jada's total = Rory's total * 2
Jada's total = 40 * 2
Jada's total = 80 dishes

Finally, to find out how many dishes they all made together, we can add up each person's total.

Total dishes = Jada's total + Rory's total + Kora's total
Total dishes = 80 + 40 + 20
Total dishes = 140 dishes

So, Jada, Rory, and Kora made a total of 140 clay dishes for their school project.
