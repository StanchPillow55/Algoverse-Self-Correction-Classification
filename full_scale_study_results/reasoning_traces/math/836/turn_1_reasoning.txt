Question ID: 836
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we know that Kora made 20 dishes.

Second, since Rory makes 20 more clay dishes than Kora, we can add 20 to the number of dishes Kora made to find out how many dishes Rory made. So, Rory made 20 + 20 = 40 dishes.

Third, since Jada makes twice as many clay dishes as Rory, we can multiply the number of dishes Rory made by 2 to find out how many dishes Jada made. So, Jada made 40 * 2 = 80 dishes.

Finally, to find out how many clay dishes they all made together, we can add the number of dishes each person made. So, they made 20 (Kora's dishes) + 40 (Rory's dishes) + 80 (Jada's dishes) = 140 dishes in total.

So, Jada, Rory, and Kora made 140 clay dishes together.
