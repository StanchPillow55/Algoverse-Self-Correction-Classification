Question ID: record_77719
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

I apologize, but I do not have enough information to determine a complete answer to the given query. The passage provided does not contain any information about a "power structure" or "lackeys" being chosen as a congressman. The passage simply states that Rep. Jesse Jackson Jr. has resigned from Congress due to health issues and ongoing investigations. Without additional context or details, I cannot provide a substantive response to the query. I would need more information about the specific situation and claims being made in order to analyze and reason through the problem step-by-step. Please feel free to provide more details, and I will do my best to work through the problem thoroughly.
