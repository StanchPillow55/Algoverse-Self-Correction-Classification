Question ID: 1174
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, let's determine how many $20 bills Thomas initially withdrew from the bank. 

Since each bill is worth $20, and he withdrew $1000, the number of $20 bills he initially had is $1000 / $20 = 50 bills.

Next, we know that Thomas loses 10 of these bills. So, the number of $20 bills he has left is 50 - 10 = 40 bills.

Then, Thomas uses half of these remaining bills to pay for a bill. So, he has 40 / 2 = 20 $20 bills left.

Thomas then triples his money, so the amount of money he has is 20 * $20 * 3 = $1200.

Finally, Thomas converts all his money to $5 bills. Since each bill is worth $5, the number of $5 bills he has is $1200 / $5 = 240 bills.

So, Thomas has 240 $5 bills.
