Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, let's figure out how many 20 dollar bills Thomas initially withdrew. Since each bill is worth 20 dollars, and he withdrew 1000 dollars, he initially had 1000 / 20 = <<1000/20=50>>50 bills.

Then, he loses 10 bills, so he has 50 - 10 = <<50-10=40>>40 bills left.

He then uses half of these bills to pay for a bill, so he has 40 / 2 = <<40/2=20>>20 bills left.

Next, he triples his money. Since each bill is worth 20 dollars, he has 20 * 20 = <<20*20=400>>400 dollars.

Finally, he converts all his money to 5 dollar bills. Since each bill is worth 5 dollars, he has 400 / 5 = <<400/5=80>>80 five dollar bills.

So, Thomas has 80 five dollar bills.
