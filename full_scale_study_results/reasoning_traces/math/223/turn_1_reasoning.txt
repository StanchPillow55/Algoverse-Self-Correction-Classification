==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine the total amount the company spent on advertising over the two years.

**Step 1: Determine the advertising cost for the first year.**

The problem states that the company spends $15,000 on advertising for the first year. Therefore, the advertising cost for the first year is:

\[ \text{First Year Cost} = \$15,000 \]

**Step 2: Calculate the advertising cost for the second year.**

The problem also states that the company spends a third of the first year's amount on advertising for the second year. To find this, we calculate one-third of $15,000:

\[ \text{Second Year Cost} = \frac{1}{3} \times \$15,000 \]

\[ \text{Second Year Cost} = \frac{15,000}{3} \]

\[ \text{Second Year Cost} = \$5,000 \]

**Step 3: Calculate the total advertising cost for the two years.**

To find the total amount spent on advertising over the two years, we add the costs for the first and second years:

\[ \text{Total Cost} = \text{First Year Cost} + \text{Second Year Cost} \]

\[ \text{Total Cost} = \$15,000 + \$5,000 \]

\[ \text{Total Cost} = \$20,000 \]

**Final Answer:**

The total amount the company spent on advertising for the two years is \$20,000.
