Dataset Type: math
==================================================

The company spent $15000 on advertising for the first year.

For the second year, the company spent a third of the first year's amount. To calculate this, we divide the first year's amount by 3:

$15000 รท 3 = $5000

So, the company spent $5000 on advertising for the second year.

To find the total amount the company spent on advertising for the two years, we add the amounts for the first and second years:

$15000 (first year) + $5000 (second year) = $20000

So, the company spent a total of $20000 on advertising for the two years.
