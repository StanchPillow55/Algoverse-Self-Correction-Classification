Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine the total amount the company spent on advertising over two years. Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Step 1: Determine the Advertising Cost for the First Year
The problem states that the company spends $15,000 on advertising for the first year. This amount is straightforward and does not require any calculations.

- **First Year Advertising Cost**: $15,000

### Step 2: Determine the Advertising Cost for the Second Year
For the second year, the company spends a third of the amount it spent in the first year. We need to calculate one-third of $15,000.

To find one-third of $15,000, we perform the following calculation:

\[
\text{Second Year Advertising Cost} = \frac{1}{3} \times 15000
\]

Calculating this gives:

\[
\text{Second Year Advertising Cost} = \frac{15000}{3} = 5000
\]

So, the company spends $5,000 on advertising in the second year.

### Step 3: Calculate the Total Advertising Cost for Both Years
Now, we add the advertising costs for both years to find the total amount spent.

\[
\text{Total Advertising Cost} = \text{First Year Advertising Cost} + \text{Second Year Advertising Cost}
\]

Substituting the values we found:

\[
\text{Total Advertising Cost} = 15000 + 5000 = 20000
\]

### Conclusion
The total amount the company spent on advertising over the two years is $20,000.

**Final Answer: $20,000**
