Question ID: 190
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to find out how many minutes John spent collecting peaches and then multiply that by the number of peaches he collects per minute.

First, we need to convert the hours John spent collecting peaches into minutes because the rate at which he collects peaches is given in minutes. 

We know that 1 hour is equal to 60 minutes. Therefore, if John collects peaches for 3 hours, the total time he spent in minutes is 3 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 180 minutes.

Next, we know that John collects 2 peaches per minute. So, to find out how many peaches he collected in total, we multiply the total time he spent collecting peaches (in minutes) by the number of peaches he collects per minute.

So, the total number of peaches John collected is 180 minutes * 2 peaches/minute = 360 peaches.

Therefore, John collected 360 peaches.
