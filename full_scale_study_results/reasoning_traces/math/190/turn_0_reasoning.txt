Question ID: 190
Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to figure out how many minutes John spends collecting peaches. We know that there are 60 minutes in an hour, so we multiply the number of hours John spends collecting peaches by 60. 

3 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 180 minutes

Next, we need to figure out how many peaches John collects in total. We know that he collects 2 peaches per minute, so we multiply the number of minutes he spends collecting peaches by the number of peaches he collects per minute.

180 minutes * 2 peaches/minute = 360 peaches

So, John collects 360 peaches.
