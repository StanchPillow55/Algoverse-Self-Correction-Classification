Question ID: record_1356
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to find the number of firearms that were allegedly trafficked by the gun smuggling network led by @placeholder.

Given information:
- The ATF statement said that "a number of firearms recovered by Mexico law enforcement ... allegedly were trafficked by @placeholder's gun smuggling network."

Since the problem does not provide the exact number of firearms, we cannot determine a specific answer. However, we can provide a reasonable estimate based on the information given.

Reasoning:
1. The passage mentions that the ATF arrested Victor Varela, the alleged leader of a firearms trafficking network believed to be smuggling guns into Mexico.
2. The passage also states that the ATF recovered several weapons, including .50-caliber semiautomatic rifles and several handguns, that were allegedly intended to supply drug traffic organization members of the Juarez Cartel in Palomas, Mexico.
3. The ATF statement specifically says that "a number of firearms recovered by Mexico law enforcement ... allegedly were trafficked by @placeholder's gun smuggling network."
4. This suggests that the number of firearms trafficked by the network led by @placeholder is likely to be more than just the few weapons
