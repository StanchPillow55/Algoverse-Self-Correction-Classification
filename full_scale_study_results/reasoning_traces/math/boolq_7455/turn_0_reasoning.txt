To determine if different dog breeds have different gestation periods, we need to analyze the information provided in the context.

Given information:
- Gestation in a dog is 63 days in length, if measured from the day of ovulation.
- Canine sperm can live for 10 to 11 days in the uterine tubes (fallopian tubes).
- If a female is bred 10 days before the oocytes (eggs) can be fertilized, she will appear to have a gestation length of 70 days.
- If a female is bred on the day the oocytes can be fertilized, her gestation length will appear to be 60 days long.

To determine if different dog breeds have different gestation periods, we need to consider the following factors:

1. Actual gestation period:
   - The actual gestation period is 63 days, measured from the day of ovulation.
   - This suggests that the actual gestation period is the same for all dog breeds, as it is a biological process that is not dependent on the breed.

2. Apparent gestation period:
   - If a female is bre
