==================================================

Bill's dad saw the comet when he was 30 years old. Since the comet orbits the sun every 75 years, it means that the comet will be visible again when Bill's dad is 30 + 75 = 105 years old.

Bill saw the comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the Comet. This means that Bill was 3 * 30 = 90 years old when he saw the comet a second time.

Since the comet orbits the sun every 75 years, it means that Bill saw the comet for the first time when he was 90 - 75 = 15 years old.

So, Bill was 15 years old when he saw the Comet for the first time.
