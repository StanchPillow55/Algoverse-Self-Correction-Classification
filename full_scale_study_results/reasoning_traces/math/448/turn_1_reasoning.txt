==================================================

To determine the salesman's profit, we need to calculate both the total revenue from selling the sneakers and the total cost of purchasing them. The profit is the difference between the total revenue and the total cost.

### Step 1: Calculate the Total Cost
The salesman bought a case of 48 sneakers for $576. Therefore, the total cost is:

\[
\text{Total Cost} = \$576
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the Revenue from the Flash Sale
The salesman sold 17 sneakers at $20 each during the flash sale. The revenue from these sales is calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Revenue from Flash Sale} = 17 \times 20 = \$340
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the Number of Sneakers Sold to the Department Store
The total number of sneakers is 48. Since 17 were sold at the flash sale, the remaining sneakers sold to the department store is:

\[
48 - 17 = 31 \text{ sneakers}
\]

### Step 4: Calculate the Revenue from the Department Store Sales
The remaining 31 sneakers were sold to the department store at $25 each. The revenue from these sales is:

\[
\text{Revenue from Department Store} = 31 \times 25 = \$775
\]

### Step 5: Calculate the Total Revenue
The total revenue is the sum of the revenue from the flash sale and the revenue from the department store sales:

\[
\text{Total Revenue} = \$340 + \$775 = \$1115
\]

### Step 6: Calculate the Profit
The profit is the total revenue minus the total cost:

\[
\text{Profit} = \text{Total Revenue} - \text{Total Cost} = \$1115 - \$576 = \$539
\]

### Final Answer
The salesman's profit is \(\boxed{539}\) dollars.
