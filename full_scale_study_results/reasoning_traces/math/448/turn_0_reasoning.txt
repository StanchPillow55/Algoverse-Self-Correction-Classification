==================================================

First, let's calculate how much the salesman spent on each sneaker. He bought 48 sneakers for $576, so each sneaker cost him $576 / 48 = $12.

Next, let's calculate how much the salesman earned from the flash sale on Monday. He sold 17 sneakers for $20 each, so he earned 17 * $20 = $340 from the flash sale.

Then, let's calculate how many sneakers the salesman sold to the department store. He started with 48 sneakers and sold 17 on Monday, so he sold 48 - 17 = 31 sneakers to the department store.

Next, let's calculate how much the salesman earned from the department store. He sold 31 sneakers for $25 each, so he earned 31 * $25 = $775 from the department store.

Now, let's calculate the total amount the salesman earned. He earned $340 from the flash sale and $775 from the department store, so he earned $340 + $775 = $1115 in total.

Finally, let's calculate the salesman's profit. His profit is the total amount he earned minus the total amount he spent. He earned $1115 and spent $576, so his profit is $1115 - $576 = $539.

Therefore, the salesman's profit was $539.
