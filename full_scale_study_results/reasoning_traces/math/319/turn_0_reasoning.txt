==================================================

The problem states that the ratio of electric poles to electric wires is 1:3. This means that for every one electric pole, there are three electric wires.

We are told that the total number of electric wires needed is 45. Since the ratio tells us that there are three wires for every one pole, we can find the number of poles by dividing the total number of wires by 3.

So, we calculate 45 รท 3 = 15.

Therefore, the total number of electric poles required by the electric company to supply the electricity in the neighborhood is 15.
