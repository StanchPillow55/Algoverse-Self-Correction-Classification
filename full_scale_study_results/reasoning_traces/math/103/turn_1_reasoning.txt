Question ID: 103
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we first need to determine how long it takes for the fog to cover one mile. We know that it takes 10 minutes to cover 3 miles, so we can divide the time by the distance to find the time per mile:

10 minutes / 3 miles = 3.33 minutes/mile

Next, we need to multiply this time per mile by the total distance across the city to find the total time it will take for the fog to cover the city:

3.33 minutes/mile * 42 miles = 139.86 minutes

However, since time is usually measured in whole minutes, we should round this up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, it will take approximately 140 minutes for the fog bank to cover the whole city.
