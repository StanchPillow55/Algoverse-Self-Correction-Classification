Dataset Type: math
==================================================

The problem tells us that the fog bank covers 3 miles in 10 minutes. We can use this information to find out how long it takes to cover 1 mile by dividing the time by the distance. 

So, 10 minutes รท 3 miles = approximately 3.33 minutes per mile.

Next, we need to find out how long it takes to cover the entire city, which is 42 miles across. We can do this by multiplying the time it takes to cover 1 mile by the total distance of the city.

So, 3.33 minutes per mile ร 42 miles = approximately 140 minutes.

Therefore, it will take approximately 140 minutes for the fog bank to cover the whole city.
