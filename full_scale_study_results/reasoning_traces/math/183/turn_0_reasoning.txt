Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

The well-rounded team will complete the relay in 4 * 55 = 220 seconds because each of their four runners will run their 400 meter leg in 55 seconds.

The less well-rounded team's first runner will run their 400 meter leg in 60 seconds. The second runner will run their leg in 60 - 3 = 57 seconds. The third runner will run their leg in 57 - 3 = 54 seconds. The fourth runner will run their leg in 54 - 3 = 51 seconds.

So, the less well-rounded team will complete the relay in 60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = 222 seconds.

Therefore, the well-rounded team will win by 222 - 220 = 2 seconds.
