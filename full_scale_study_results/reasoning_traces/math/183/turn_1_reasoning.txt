Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total time taken by each team to complete the 4 by 400 meter relay and then find the difference in their times to determine how many seconds the faster team wins by.

**Team 1 (Well-rounded team):**

Each member of this team runs their 400 meter leg in precisely 55 seconds. Since there are four members, the total time for Team 1 is calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Total time for Team 1} = 4 \times 55 \text{ seconds} = 220 \text{ seconds}
\]

**Team 2 (Less well-rounded team):**

The first runner of this team runs their 400 meter leg in 60 seconds. Each subsequent runner is 3 seconds faster than the previous runner. We can calculate the time for each runner as follows:

- First runner: 60 seconds
- Second runner: 60 - 3 = 57 seconds
- Third runner: 57 - 3 = 54 seconds
- Fourth runner: 54 - 3 = 51 seconds

Now, we sum up these times to find the total time for Team 2:

\[
\text{Total time for Team 2} = 60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = 222 \text{ seconds}
\]

**Determine the difference:**

Now, we find the difference in the total times of the two teams to determine how many seconds the faster team wins by:

\[
\text{Difference} = \text{Total time for Team 2} - \text{Total time for Team 1} = 222 - 220 = 2 \text{ seconds}
\]

Therefore, the faster team (Team 1) wins by 2 seconds.

**Final Answer:**

The faster team wins by 2 seconds.
