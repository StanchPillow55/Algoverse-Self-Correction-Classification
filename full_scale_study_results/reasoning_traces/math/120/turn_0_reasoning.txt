Question ID: 120
Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to figure out how many sheets of paper Miguel uses in a week. Since he uses 2 pads of paper and each pad contains 30 sheets, we multiply 2 by 30. 

2 pads/week * 30 sheets/pad = 60 sheets/week

Next, we need to figure out how many sheets of paper Miguel uses in a month. Since there are approximately 4 weeks in a month, we multiply the number of sheets he uses in a week by 4.

60 sheets/week * 4 weeks/month = 240 sheets/month

So, Miguel uses 240 sheets of paper every month.
