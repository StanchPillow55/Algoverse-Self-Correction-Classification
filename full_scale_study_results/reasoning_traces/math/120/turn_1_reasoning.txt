Question ID: 120
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to determine how many sheets of paper Miguel uses in a week. Since he uses 2 pads of paper a week and each pad contains 30 sheets, we multiply 2 pads by 30 sheets to find the total number of sheets he uses in a week.

2 pads/week * 30 sheets/pad = 60 sheets/week

Next, we need to determine how many sheets of paper Miguel uses in a month. Since there are approximately 4 weeks in a month, we multiply the number of sheets he uses in a week by 4 to find the total number of sheets he uses in a month.

60 sheets/week * 4 weeks/month = 240 sheets/month

Therefore, Miguel uses 240 sheets of paper every month.
