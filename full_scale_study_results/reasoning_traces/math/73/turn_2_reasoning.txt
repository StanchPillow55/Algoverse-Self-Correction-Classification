Question ID: 73
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine the total cost of the five cell phones including interest, and then calculate the monthly installment payment over 3 months.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Calculate the Total Cost of the Cell Phones Without Interest:**

   Shiela bought five cell phones, each costing $150. Therefore, the total cost without interest is:
   \[
   \text{Total cost without interest} = 5 \times 150 = 750 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Calculate the Interest for Each Cell Phone:**

   The interest rate is 2% per cell phone. To find the interest for one cell phone:
   \[
   \text{Interest per phone} = 150 \times \frac{2}{100} = 3 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Calculate the Total Interest for All Cell Phones:**

   Since there are five cell phones, the total interest is:
   \[
   \text{Total interest} = 5 \times 3 = 15 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Calculate the Total Cost Including Interest:**

   Add the total interest to the total cost without interest to find the total cost including interest:
   \[
   \text{Total cost with interest} = 750 + 15 = 765 \text{ dollars}
   \]

5. **Calculate the Monthly Payment:**

   The total cost with interest is to be paid over 3 months. Therefore, the monthly payment is:
   \[
   \text{Monthly payment} = \frac{765}{3} = 255 \text{ dollars}
   \]

### Final Answer:

Shiela will pay **$255** each month for 3 months.
