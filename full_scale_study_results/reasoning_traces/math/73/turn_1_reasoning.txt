Question ID: 73
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, let's calculate the total cost of the five cell phones without interest. 

Since each phone costs $150, the total cost for five phones would be $150 * 5 = $750.

Next, let's calculate the total interest for the five phones. 

Since the interest rate is 2%, the total interest would be $750 * 0.02 = $15.

Adding the total cost and the total interest gives us the total amount that Shiela has to pay. 

So, $750 + $15 = $765.

Since Shiela will pay this amount over a period of 3 months, we divide the total amount by 3 to find out how much she will pay each month.

So, $765 / 3 = $255.

Therefore, Shiela will pay $255 each month for 3 months.
