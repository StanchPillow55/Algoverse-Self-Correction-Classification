Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, let's calculate the total cost of the five cell phones without interest. 

The cost of one cell phone is $150, so five cell phones would cost 5 * $150 = $750.

Next, let's calculate the interest. A 2% interest is charged for each unit, so the total interest for five cell phones would be 2% * $750 = $15.

So, the total cost of the five cell phones with interest is $750 + $15 = $765.

Since Shiela will pay for the cell phones in a 3-month installment, she will pay $765 / 3 = $255 each month.

So, Shiela will pay $255 each month for 3 months.
