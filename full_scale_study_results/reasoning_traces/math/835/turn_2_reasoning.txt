Question ID: 835
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, let's determine the speed of a kangaroo. If 3 kangaroos can cross the highway in 18 hours, then one kangaroo can do it in the same amount of time, because they are all traveling at the same speed. 

So, the speed of a kangaroo is the distance of the highway divided by the time it takes to cross it. We don't know the actual distance of the highway, but we can call it "D" for the purposes of our calculations. So, the speed of a kangaroo is D/18.

A turtle travels at half the speed of a kangaroo, so the speed of a turtle is (D/18)/2 = D/36.

Now, we want to know how long it will take four turtles to cross the highway. Since each turtle travels at the same speed, the time it takes one turtle to cross the highway is the same as the time it takes four turtles to cross the highway.

The time it takes for a turtle to cross the highway is the distance of the highway divided by the speed of a turtle. So, the time it takes for a turtle to cross the highway is D/(D/36) = 36 hours.

So, it will take four turtles 36 hours to cross the highway.
