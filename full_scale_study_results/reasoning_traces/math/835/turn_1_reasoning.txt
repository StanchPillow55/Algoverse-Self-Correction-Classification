Question ID: 835
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, let's determine the speed of a kangaroo. If it takes 3 kangaroos 18 hours to cross the highway, then it would take one kangaroo the same amount of time, because they are all traveling at the same speed. So, the speed of a kangaroo is the distance of the highway divided by 18 hours.

Next, let's consider the turtles. Each turtle is traveling at half the speed of a kangaroo. This means it would take a turtle twice as long to cross the highway as it would take a kangaroo. So, it would take a turtle 2 * 18 hours = 36 hours to cross the highway.

However, we have four turtles, not just one. But since they are all traveling at the same speed, the time it takes for all four turtles to cross the highway is still 36 hours. 

So, it will take four turtles each traveling at half the speed of a kangaroo 36 hours to cross the highway.
