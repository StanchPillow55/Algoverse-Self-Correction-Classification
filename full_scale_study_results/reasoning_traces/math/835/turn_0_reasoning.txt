Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, let's find out how long it would take one kangaroo to cross the highway. If it takes 3 kangaroos 18 hours to cross, then it would take one kangaroo 3 times as long, because they are all traveling at the same speed. 

So, one kangaroo would take 3 * 18 = 54 hours to cross the highway.

Now, a turtle travels at half the speed of a kangaroo. This means that a turtle would take twice as long to cross the highway as a kangaroo. 

So, one turtle would take 2 * 54 = 108 hours to cross the highway.

However, we have 4 turtles, all traveling at the same speed. This means that they can all cross the highway together in the same amount of time it would take one turtle to cross.

So, it would take the 4 turtles a total of 108 hours to cross the highway.

Therefore, the final answer is 108 hours.
