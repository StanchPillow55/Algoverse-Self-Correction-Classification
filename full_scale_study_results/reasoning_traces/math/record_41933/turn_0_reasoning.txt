==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to find the probability of France winning the match against Germany, given that they were trailing at halftime.

Given information:
- In 10 previous ties where France had trailed at halftime, they had lost on each and every occasion.

To calculate the probability of France winning the match, we need to use the concept of conditional probability.

The probability of France winning the match, given that they were trailing at halftime, can be represented as:
P(France wins | France trailing at halftime)

We can use the information provided to calculate this probability.

Since France had lost on each and every occasion in the 10 previous ties where they had trailed at halftime, the probability of them winning the match, given that they were trailing at halftime, is 0.

Mathematically, we can represent this as:
P(France wins | France trailing at halftime) = 0

Therefore, the final answer is:
The probability of France winning the match against Germany, given that they were trailing at halftime, is 0.
