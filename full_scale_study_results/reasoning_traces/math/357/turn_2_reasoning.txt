Question ID: 357
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, let's break down the costs for each activity per person:

- Mini-golf: $5
- Arcade tokens: $5
- Go-kart rides: $10 x 2 = $20

Adding these together, we find that each person's activities will cost $5 + $5 + $20 = $30.

Now, we need to figure out how many people Morgan can invite with her budget of $90. Since Morgan is also participating in the activities, we need to subtract her costs from the total budget first. 

So, $90 - $30 (Morgan's cost) = $60 remaining for her friends.

Finally, we divide the remaining budget by the cost per friend to find out how many friends Morgan can invite. 

$60 รท $30 = 2 friends

So, Morgan can invite 2 friends to her birthday party.
