Question ID: 357
Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to calculate the total cost for each person (Morgan and each of her friends) to do all the activities. 

The cost for one round of mini-golf is $5. 
The cost for the arcade tokens is $5. 
The cost for two rides on the go-karts is 2 * $10 = $20. 

So, the total cost per person is $5 (mini-golf) + $5 (arcade tokens) + $20 (go-karts) = $30.

Now, we need to figure out how many people can do all the activities with the budget of $90. 

To do this, we divide the total budget by the cost per person. 

$90 / $30 = 3 people.

However, this includes Morgan. So, the number of friends she can invite is 3 - 1 = 2 friends.

So, Morgan can invite 2 friends to her birthday party.
