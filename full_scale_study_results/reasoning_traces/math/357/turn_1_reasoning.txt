Question ID: 357
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, let's calculate the cost per person for all the activities. 

A round of mini-golf is $5, $5 in arcade tokens, and two go-kart rides at $10 each. 

So, the total cost per person is $5 (mini-golf) + $5 (arcade tokens) + 2*$10 (go-karts) = $30. 

Since Morgan also needs to participate in these activities, we need to subtract her cost from the total budget. 

So, $90 (total budget) - $30 (Morgan's cost) = $60. 

Now, we divide the remaining budget by the cost per friend to find out how many friends Morgan can invite. 

So, $60 / $30 (cost per friend) = 2 friends. 

Therefore, Morgan can invite 2 friends to her birthday party.
