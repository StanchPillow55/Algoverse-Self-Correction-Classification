Question ID: record_67142
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to find the location of Frank Biden's real-estate development and consulting firm based on the information provided in the passage.

Given information:
- The passage mentions that Frank Biden, the younger brother of Vice President Joe Biden, was hospitalized after he opened a package from India containing a white powder.
- The passage does not provide any information about the location of Frank Biden's real-estate development and consulting firm.

Since the passage does not explicitly state the location of Frank Biden's firm, we cannot determine the final answer. The passage only provides information about the incident involving the suspicious package, but does not mention the location of Frank Biden's business.

Therefore, the final answer is: @placeholder.
