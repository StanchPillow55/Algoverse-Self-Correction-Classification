Question ID: record_30146
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, I will break it down step-by-step:

1. The LAPD had billed the exhibit as "a glimpse into some of the most notable homicides and critical incidents that occurred in @placeholder over the past 100 years."

2. The exhibit included the clothing that Sen. Robert F. Kennedy was wearing when he was killed.

3. The son of Sen. Robert F. Kennedy criticized the inclusion of his father's clothing in the exhibit, calling it "a macabre publicity stunt."

4. In response, the LAPD apologized and removed the clothing from the exhibit.

5. The LAPD also apologized to any other victims' family members who might have been offended by the other items in the exhibit.

Final answer: The LAPD's placeholder for the location of the exhibit was not provided in the passage.
