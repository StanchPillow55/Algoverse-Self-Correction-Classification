Question ID: 180
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

The problem tells us that the winner got 3/4 of the votes. This means that the loser must have gotten the remaining 1/4 of the votes, since the total votes add up to 1 (or 100%).

To find out how many votes the loser got, we need to calculate 1/4 of the total number of students who voted. 

The total number of students who voted is 80. 

To calculate 1/4 of 80, we multiply 80 by 1/4:

80 * 1/4 = 20

So, the loser got 20 votes.
