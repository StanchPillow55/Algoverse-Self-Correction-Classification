Question ID: 180
Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

The winner got 3/4 of the total votes. To find out how many votes the winner got, we multiply the total number of votes by 3/4.

So, 80 * 3/4 = 60 votes.

This means the winner got 60 votes.

Since the total number of students who voted was 80, to find out how many votes the loser got, we subtract the number of votes the winner got from the total number of votes.

So, 80 - 60 = 20 votes.

Therefore, the loser got 20 votes.
