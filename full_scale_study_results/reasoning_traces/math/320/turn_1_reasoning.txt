Question ID: 320
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

At the beginning of the party, there were 25 men and 15 women, making a total of 40 people.

After an hour, 1/4 of the total number of people left. To find out how many people left, we calculate 1/4 of 40:

40 * 1/4 = 10 people

So, 10 people left the party.

If 22 men stayed at the party, this means that 3 men left the party because 25 men - 22 men = 3 men.

Since we know that 10 people left the party in total and 3 of them were men, the remaining people who left must have been women. 

So, we subtract the number of men who left from the total number of people who left to find out how many women left:

10 people - 3 men = 7 women

Therefore, 7 women left the party. 

At the beginning, there were 15 women, so to find out how many women are left, we subtract the number of women who left from the total number of women:

15 women - 7 women = 8 women

So, 8 women are left at the party.
