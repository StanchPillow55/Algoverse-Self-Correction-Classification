Question ID: 523
Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

The bakers at the Beverly Hills Bakery started with 200 loaves of bread.

They sold 93 loaves in the morning and 39 loaves in the afternoon. To find out how many loaves they sold in total, we add these two numbers together:

93 loaves + 39 loaves = 132 loaves

So, they sold 132 loaves of bread in total.

To find out how many loaves they had left after these sales, we subtract the number of loaves sold from the number they started with:

200 loaves - 132 loaves = 68 loaves

So, they had 68 loaves of bread left after selling some.

However, a grocery store returned 6 unsold loaves. To find out how many loaves they have now, we add these 6 loaves to the number they had left:

68 loaves + 6 loaves = 74 loaves

So, the bakers at the Beverly Hills Bakery have 74 loaves of bread left.
