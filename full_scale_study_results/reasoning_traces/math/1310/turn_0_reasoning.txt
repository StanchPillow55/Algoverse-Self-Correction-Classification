Question ID: 1310
Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to determine how fast Aaron was running. We know that he ran half the distance Vanessa did, so he ran 2 miles. We also know that he completed his part of the race in 16 minutes. Therefore, his speed was 2 miles / 16 minutes = 0.125 miles per minute.

Since Aaron runs twice as fast as Vanessa, Vanessa's speed is half of Aaron's, or 0.125 miles per minute / 2 = 0.0625 miles per minute.

We know Vanessa ran 4 miles, so to find out how long she took, we divide the distance she ran by her speed: 4 miles / 0.0625 miles per minute = 64 minutes.

Therefore, Vanessa took 64 minutes to complete her part of the race.
