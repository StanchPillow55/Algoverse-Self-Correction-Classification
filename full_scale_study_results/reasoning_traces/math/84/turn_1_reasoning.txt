Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

Let's denote the number of games the team lost as x. 

According to the problem, the team won 8 more games than they lost, so the number of games they won is x + 8.

The total number of games played by the team is the sum of the games they won and the games they lost, which is 22. 

So, we can set up the following equation to represent this situation:

x (games lost) + (x + 8) (games won) = 22 (total games)

Solving this equation will give us the number of games the team won and lost.

Combine like terms:

2x + 8 = 22

Subtract 8 from both sides of the equation:

2x = 22 - 8
2x = 14

Divide both sides by 2 to solve for x:

x = 14 / 2
x = 7

So, the team lost 7 games. 

Since the team won 8 more games than they lost, they won 7 + 8 = 15 games.

So, the football team won 15 games.
