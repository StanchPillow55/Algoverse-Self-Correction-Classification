==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of the notebooks and the ballpen separately, then add them together.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the notebooks. Each notebook costs $1.50 and William bought 5 notebooks. So, the total cost of the notebooks is 5 notebooks * $1.50/notebook = $7.50.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the ballpen. The ballpen costs $0.5 and William bought 1 ballpen. So, the cost of the ballpen is 1 ballpen * $0.5/ballpen = $0.5.

Finally, let's add the cost of the notebooks and the ballpen to find the total cost. The total cost is $7.50 + $0.5 = $8.00.

So, William spent $8.00 in total.
