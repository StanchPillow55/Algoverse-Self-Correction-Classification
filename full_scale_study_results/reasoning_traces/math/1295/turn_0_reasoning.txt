First, we need to calculate how much money Ryan has earned from doing his chores. He earns $6 each week and he did his chores for 3 weeks. So, he has earned:

$6/week * 3 weeks = $18

Next, we need to calculate how much money Ryan spent on ice cream cones. He bought ice cream cones for himself and 3 friends, so he bought 4 ice cream cones in total. Each ice cream cone costs $1.25, so he spent:

$1.25/cone * 4 cones = $5

Now, we need to calculate how much money Ryan has left after buying the ice cream cones. He started with $18 and spent $5 on ice cream cones, so he has:

$18 - $5 = $13 left

Finally, we need to calculate how many movie tickets Ryan can buy. Each movie ticket costs $6.50, so Ryan can buy:

$13 / $6.50/ticket = 2 tickets

So, Ryan can buy 2 movie tickets.
