==================================================

First, we need to calculate how much money Ryan has earned from doing his chores. He gets $6 each week and he did his chores for 3 weeks. So, we multiply $6 by 3 to get the total amount of money he has earned.

$6/week * 3 weeks = $18

Next, we need to calculate how much money Ryan spent on ice cream cones. He bought ice cream cones for himself and 3 friends, so that's a total of 4 ice cream cones. Each ice cream cone costs $1.25, so we multiply $1.25 by 4 to get the total cost of the ice cream cones.

$1.25/cone * 4 cones = $5

Now we subtract the cost of the ice cream cones from the money Ryan earned from doing his chores to find out how much money he has left.

$18 - $5 = $13

Finally, we need to figure out how many movie tickets Ryan can buy with the money he has left. Each movie ticket costs $6.50, so we divide the amount of money Ryan has left by the cost of each movie ticket.

$13 / $6.50/ticket = 2 tickets

Therefore, Ryan can buy 2 movie tickets.
