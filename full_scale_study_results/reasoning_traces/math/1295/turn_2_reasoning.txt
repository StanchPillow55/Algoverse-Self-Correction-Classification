Question ID: 1295
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, let's calculate how much money Ryan earned from doing his chores for 3 weeks. Since he earns $6 each week, we multiply this by the number of weeks:

$6/week * 3 weeks = $18

Next, let's calculate how much money Ryan spent on ice cream cones. Since each cone costs $1.25 and he bought 4 cones (one for himself and three for his friends), we multiply the cost of each cone by the number of cones:

$1.25/cone * 4 cones = $5

Now, we subtract the cost of the ice cream cones from the money Ryan earned to find out how much money he has left:

$18 - $5 = $13

Finally, we divide the money Ryan has left by the cost of each movie ticket to find out how many tickets he can buy:

$13 / $6.50/ticket = 2 tickets

So, Ryan can buy 2 movie tickets.
