Question ID: 974
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to find out the total cost of the books Tyler wants to buy. 

The cost of the dictionary is $18, the dinosaur book is $13, and the children's cookbook is $8. 

So, the total cost of the books is $18 + $13 + $8 = $39.

Tyler has already saved $14 from his allowance. So, we subtract this amount from the total cost of the books to find out how much more money Tyler needs. 

$39 - $14 = $25.

Tyler earns $5 per hour. To find out how many hours he needs to work to earn the remaining $25, we divide $25 by his hourly wage of $5.

$25 รท $5 = 5 hours.

So, Tyler needs to work for 5 more hours to afford his books. 

Final Answer: Tyler has to work for 5 hours.
