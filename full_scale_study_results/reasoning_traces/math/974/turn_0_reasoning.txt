Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to find out how much all the books cost together. 

The dictionary costs $18, the dinosaur book costs $13, and the children's cookbook costs $8. 

So, the total cost of the books is $18 + $13 + $8 = $39.

Tyler has already saved $14. So, we subtract this from the total cost of the books to find out how much more money Tyler needs. 

$39 - $14 = $25.

Tyler earns $5 per hour. So, to find out how many hours Tyler needs to work, we divide the total amount of money he needs by how much he earns per hour. 

$25 รท $5 = 5 hours.

So, Tyler needs to work for 5 more hours to afford his books.
