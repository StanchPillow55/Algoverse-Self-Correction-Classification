Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we first need to find out how much money Tyler needs in total to buy all the books. 

The cost of the dictionary is $18, the dinosaur book is $13, and the children's cookbook is $8. 

So, the total cost of the books is $18 + $13 + $8 = $39.

Tyler has already saved $14 from his allowance. So, we subtract this amount from the total cost of the books to find out how much more money Tyler needs.

$39 - $14 = $25.

Tyler still needs $25 to buy all the books.

Tyler earns $5 per hour. To find out how many hours Tyler needs to work to earn $25, we divide the amount of money he needs by the amount of money he earns per hour.

$25 รท $5 = 5 hours.

So, Tyler needs to work for 5 hours to afford his books. 

Final Answer: Tyler needs to work for 5 hours.
