==================================================

Let's denote the number of yellow balloons as Y. 

According to the problem, Benny threw two pieces of bologna at each red balloon. Since there were 20 red balloons, he threw 2 * 20 = 40 pieces of bologna at the red balloons.

The problem also states that Benny threw a total of 58 pieces of bologna. If we subtract the number of pieces thrown at the red balloons from the total, we can find out how many pieces were thrown at the yellow balloons. 

So, 58 - 40 = 18 pieces of bologna were thrown at the yellow balloons.

Since Benny threw three pieces of bologna at each yellow balloon, we can find the number of yellow balloons by dividing the total number of pieces thrown at the yellow balloons by the number of pieces thrown at each yellow balloon.

So, Y = 18 / 3 = 6.

Therefore, there were 6 yellow balloons in the bundle.
