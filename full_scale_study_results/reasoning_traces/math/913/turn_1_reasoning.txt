Question ID: 913
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to calculate how many pieces of bologna Benny threw at the red balloons. Since he threw two pieces at each red balloon and there were twenty red balloons, he threw 2 * 20 = 40 pieces of bologna at the red balloons.

Next, we subtract the number of pieces of bologna thrown at the red balloons from the total number of pieces thrown to find out how many were thrown at the yellow balloons. This gives us 58 - 40 = 18 pieces of bologna.

Finally, since Benny threw three pieces of bologna at each yellow balloon, we divide the number of pieces thrown at the yellow balloons by three to find the number of yellow balloons. This gives us 18 / 3 = 6 yellow balloons.

Therefore, there were 6 yellow balloons in the bundle.
