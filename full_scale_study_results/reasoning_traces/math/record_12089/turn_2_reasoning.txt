==================================================

Unfortunately, there is no mathematical problem or calculation to solve in the given passage. The passage is a news article about a lawyer for John Hinckley Jr. demanding Secret Service surveillance records from a trip Hinckley took to see his mother. The passage does not contain any numerical information or a mathematical problem that can be solved. The query about a hospital reworking its proposal and involving a new case manager is also not a mathematical problem. Without any numerical data or a clear mathematical question, I cannot provide a step-by-step solution or a final answer. The passage is informational in nature and does not lend itself to a mathematical problem-solving exercise.
