To solve this problem, I will need to extract the relevant information from the given passage and then use logical reasoning to determine the missing word in the query.

Given information:
- The passage is about a lawyer for John Hinckley Jr. demanding Secret Service surveillance records from a trip Hinckley took in March to see his mother.
- The lawyer, Barry Levine, complained that the Secret Service provided an inaccurate report of one of Hinckley's periodic trips to Williamsburg, Virginia.
- The passage mentions that the Secret Service told federal prosecutors that Hinckley was involved in a "disruption" during a tour of an unnamed facility and that police were summoned, but a source said Hinckley was never involved in such an incident.
- The passage also mentions that the court is weighing a new treatment proposal for Hinckley, who shot and wounded former President Ronald Reagan in 1981.

Query: The hospital reworked its proposal, which @placeholder said now involves a new case manager.

To determine the missing word in the query, I need to analyze the context and structure of the sentence.

The sentence indicates that the hospital reworked its proposal
