==================================================

Unfortunately, there is no mathematical problem or calculation to solve in the given passage. The passage is about a legal case involving John Hinckley Jr., the man who attempted to assassinate President Ronald Reagan in 1981. The passage discusses his lawyer's request for Secret Service surveillance records from a recent trip Hinckley took, and a dispute over the accuracy of the Secret Service's report on that trip. There is no numerical data or mathematical information provided that would allow for a mathematical problem to be solved. The query about a "new case manager" is not a mathematical question, but rather a reference to some change in Hinckley's treatment proposal. Without any numerical information to work with, I cannot provide a step-by-step mathematical solution. The passage is purely informational and does not contain a math problem to solve.
