Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

Lloyd earns $10 an hour for tutoring. 

First, we need to calculate how much he earned in the first week. He tutored for 5 hours, so we multiply the number of hours he worked by his hourly rate:

5 hours * $10/hour = $50

So, Lloyd earned $50 in the first week.

Next, we need to calculate how much he earned in the second week. He tutored for 8 hours, so again we multiply the number of hours he worked by his hourly rate:

8 hours * $10/hour = $80

So, Lloyd earned $80 in the second week.

Finally, to find out how much he earned in total for the first two weeks, we add together his earnings from the first week and the second week:

$50 (first week) + $80 (second week) = $130

So, Lloyd earned $130 for the first two weeks of tutoring.
