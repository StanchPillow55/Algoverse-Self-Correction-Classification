Question ID: record_52971
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given passage and determine the missing word in the query.

Given information:
- The passage describes the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival, which is a music festival held in Indio, California.
- The passage mentions that on Day Two of the festival, "The Killers enjoy backstage compound with picket fence, tablecloths, festive lights" and "Killers frontman Brandon Flowers has crowd singing the along to new hit, 'Human'."

Based on this information, the missing word in the query is likely "Human", as it is mentioned in the passage that The Killers performed their hit song "Human" and had the crowd singing along.

Therefore, the complete query would be:

"At Coachella, it doesn't matter if you're human or if you're dancer."

The final answer is:

Human
