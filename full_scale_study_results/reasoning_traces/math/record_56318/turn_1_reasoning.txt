==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to find the number of members in the Leyson family.

Given information:
- The passage mentions that the Leyson family was a family of seven who had moved to Krakow so Leon Leyson's father, Morris, could find work.

Therefore, the Leyson family had 7 members.

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The passage states that the Leyson family was a family of seven.
2. It also mentions that Leon Leyson's father, Morris, was one of the few men allowed out to work in Krakow.
3. This implies that the Leyson family consisted of Leon Leyson, his parents (Leon's father, Morris, and his mother), and four other family members.
4. Therefore, the Leyson family had a total of 7 members.

Final answer:
The Leyson family had 7 members.
