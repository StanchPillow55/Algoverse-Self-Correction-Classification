==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to find the number of members in the Leyson family based on the information provided in the passage.

Given information:
- The passage mentions that the Leyson family was a family of seven who had moved to Krakow so that Leon Leyson's father, Morris, could find work.

Therefore, the number of members in the Leyson family is 7.

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The passage states that the Leyson family was a family of seven.
2. It also mentions that Leon Leyson, who was 13 years old at the time, was the youngest member of the family.
3. The passage indicates that Leon Leyson's father, Morris, was one of the few men allowed to work outside the ghetto.
4. This suggests that the Leyson family consisted of Leon Leyson, his parents (Leon's father, Morris, and his mother), and four other family members.

Final answer:
The Leyson family had 7 members.
