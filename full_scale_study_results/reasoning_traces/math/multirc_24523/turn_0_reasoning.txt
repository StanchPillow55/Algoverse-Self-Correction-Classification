To solve this problem, we need to analyze the information provided in the paragraph and identify the mistakes that led to American 77 flying undetected for 36 minutes.

The key information from the paragraph is:
1. American 77 reemerged on Indianapolis Center radar at 9:05 but was not detected by the controllers.
2. Indianapolis Center did not instruct other controllers to turn on their primary radar coverage to search for American 77.
3. The Command Center and FAA headquarters did not issue an all points bulletin to surrounding centers to search for primary radar targets.

The mistake that led to American 77 flying undetected for 36 minutes, besides the air traffic control search, was:

The Command Center and FAA headquarters did not issue an all points bulletin to surrounding centers to search for primary radar targets.

Reasoning:
The paragraph states that "neither it nor FAA headquarters issued an all points bulletin to surrounding centers to search for primary radar targets." This means that the Command Center and FAA headquarters failed to alert other air traffic control centers to actively search for American 77 on their primary radar. If they had issued an all points bulletin, the surrounding centers would have
