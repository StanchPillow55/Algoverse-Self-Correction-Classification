==================================================

Based on the information provided in the paragraph, one of the mistakes that led to American 77 flying undetected for 36 minutes was that neither the FAA Command Center nor FAA headquarters issued an all points bulletin to surrounding air traffic control centers to search for the aircraft on primary radar.

The reasoning is as follows:

1. The paragraph states that "Although the Command Center learned Flight 77 was missing, neither it nor FAA headquarters issued an all points bulletin to surrounding centers to search for primary radar targets."
2. This means that the surrounding air traffic control centers were not alerted to actively search for American 77 on their primary radar displays.
3. As a result, American 77 was able to travel undetected for 36 minutes on a course heading due east for Washington, D.C.
4. If an all points bulletin had been issued, the surrounding centers might have been able to detect the aircraft on their primary radar and assist in the search.

Therefore, the mistake besides the air traffic control search that led to American 77 flying undetected for 36 minutes was the failure to issue an all points bulletin to surrounding air traffic control centers.
