==================================================

Based on the information provided in the paragraph, one of the mistakes that led to American 77 flying undetected for 36 minutes was that neither the FAA Command Center nor FAA headquarters issued an all points bulletin to surrounding air traffic control centers to search for the primary radar target of American 77.

The reasoning is as follows:

1. The paragraph states that "Although the Command Center learned Flight 77 was missing, neither it nor FAA headquarters issued an all points bulletin to surrounding centers to search for primary radar targets."
2. This means that the FAA Command Center and FAA headquarters did not take the necessary action to alert other air traffic control centers to actively search for American 77 on their radar screens.
3. If an all points bulletin had been issued, the surrounding air traffic control centers would have been aware of the missing aircraft and could have joined the search, potentially detecting American 77 earlier.
4. The lack of this critical communication and coordination among the air traffic control centers allowed American 77 to fly undetected for 36 minutes.

Therefore, the mistake, in addition to the air traffic control search, was the failure to issue an all points bulletin to surrounding air traffic control
