Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

In the first half, team A scores 4 goals. Team B scores 2 goals fewer than team A, which means team B scores 4 - 2 = 2 goals in the first half.

In the second half, team B scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half. So, team B scores 4 * 2 = 8 goals in the second half.

Team A scores 1/4 of the number of goals scored by team B in the second half. So, team A scores 1/4 * 8 = 2 goals in the second half.

The total number of goals scored by team A in the match is 4 (first half) + 2 (second half) = 6 goals.

The total number of goals scored by team B in the match is 2 (first half) + 8 (second half) = 10 goals.

Therefore, the total number of goals scored in the match is 6 (team A) + 10 (team B) = 16 goals. 

So, the final answer is 16 goals.
