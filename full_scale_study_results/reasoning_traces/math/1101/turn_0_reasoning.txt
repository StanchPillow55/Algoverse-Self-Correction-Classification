Question ID: 1101
Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to find out how many miles Micah ran. We know that Micah ran 3.5 times what Amber ran. Amber ran 8 miles, so to find out how many miles Micah ran, we multiply 8 by 3.5:

8 miles * 3.5 = 28 miles

So, Micah ran 28 miles.

Next, we need to find out how many miles Ahito ran. We know that the total miles ran by Amber, Micah, and Ahito is 52 miles. To find out how many miles Ahito ran, we subtract the miles ran by Amber and Micah from the total:

52 miles - 8 miles - 28 miles = 16 miles

So, Ahito ran 16 miles. 

Therefore, the final answer is that Ahito ran 16 miles.
