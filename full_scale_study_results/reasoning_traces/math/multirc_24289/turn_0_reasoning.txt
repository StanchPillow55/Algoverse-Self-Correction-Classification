To determine why Einstein had a hard time making a decision about his future, we need to analyze the information provided in the paragraph.

The key points from the paragraph are:
1. In October 1933, Einstein returned to the U.S. and took up a position at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey.
2. At the time, most American universities had minimal or no Jewish faculty or students due to a Jewish quota that lasted until the late 1940s.
3. Einstein had offers from several European universities, including Oxford, where he stayed for three short periods between May 1931 and June 1933.
4. However, in 1935, he arrived at the decision to remain permanently in the United States and apply for citizenship.

Based on this information, we can see that Einstein had a hard time making a decision because he had offers from European universities, including Oxford, where he had previously stayed for short periods. This suggests that he was still considering staying in Europe, even after taking up a position in the U.S.

The paragraph also mentions that most American universities at the time had minimal or no Jewish faculty or students due to a Jewish quota. This may have made Einstein hesit
