To determine why Einstein had a hard time making a decision, we need to analyze the information provided in the paragraph.

The key points are:
1. Einstein returned to the U.S. in 1933 and took a position at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey.

The paragraph suggests that the discrimination against Jewish
