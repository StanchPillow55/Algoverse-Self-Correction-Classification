Question ID: 962
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we first need to determine how much more the travel tickets cost compared to the supplies. We know that the tickets cost 50% more than the supplies.

First, we calculate 50% of the cost of the supplies. Since the supplies cost $400, we multiply $400 by 50% (or 0.5 in decimal form):

$400 * 0.5 = $200

This means that the tickets cost $200 more than the supplies.

Next, we add this extra cost to the original cost of the supplies to find the total cost of the tickets:

$400 (cost of supplies) + $200 (extra cost) = $600

So, the total cost of the travel tickets is $600.
