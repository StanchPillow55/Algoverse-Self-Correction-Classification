==================================================

The cost of the supplies is $400. The cost of the travel tickets is 50% more than the cost of the supplies. 

To find out how much more the travel tickets cost than the supplies, we need to calculate 50% of the cost of the supplies. 

50% of $400 is calculated as follows:

50/100 * $400 = $200

So, the travel tickets cost $200 more than the supplies. 

To find the total cost of the travel tickets, we add this $200 to the original cost of the supplies:

$400 (cost of supplies) + $200 (additional cost for travel tickets) = $600

So, the total cost of the travel tickets is $600.
