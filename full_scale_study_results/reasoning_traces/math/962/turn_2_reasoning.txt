Question ID: 962
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we first need to find out how much more the travel tickets cost compared to the supplies. We know that the tickets cost 50% more than the supplies.

The cost of the supplies is given as $400. To find 50% of this amount, we multiply 400 by 0.50 (since 50% is equivalent to 0.50 in decimal form).

400 * 0.50 = $200

This means that the tickets cost $200 more than the supplies.

To find the total cost of the tickets, we add this additional amount to the original cost of the supplies.

400 (cost of supplies) + 200 (additional cost for tickets) = $600

Therefore, the total cost of travel is $600.
