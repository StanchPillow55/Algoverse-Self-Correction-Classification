Question ID: 470
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine the total cost of the items Theo bought and then calculate the change she received from the $10 she gave the cashier.

1. **Determine the cost of the pen:**
   - The pen costs $2.

2. **Determine the cost of the piece of paper:**
   - The problem states that the piece of paper costs $1 less than three times the price of the pen.
   - First, calculate three times the price of the pen:  
     \[
     3 \times 2 = 6
     \]
   - Then, subtract $1 from this amount to find the cost of the paper:  
     \[
     6 - 1 = 5
     \]
   - Therefore, the piece of paper costs $5.

3. **Calculate the total cost of the items:**
   - Add the cost of the pen and the cost of the piece of paper:  
     \[
     2 + 5 = 7
     \]

4. **Calculate the change Theo received:**
   - Theo gave the cashier $10. To find the change, subtract the total cost of the items from the amount given:  
     \[
     10 - 7 = 3
     \]

Thus, the amount of change Theo received is $3.

**Final Answer:** Theo received $3 in change.
