==================================================

The price of the pen is given as $2. 

The cost of the paper is said to be $1 less than three times the price of the pen. To find the cost of the paper, we first need to calculate three times the price of the pen. 

Three times the price of the pen is 3 * $2 = $6.

Since the paper costs $1 less than this, we subtract $1 from $6 to get the cost of the paper. 

So, the cost of the paper is $6 - $1 = $5.

The total cost of the pen and the paper is therefore $2 (for the pen) + $5 (for the paper) = $7.

Theo gave the cashier $10, so to find out how much change she received, we subtract the total cost of the items from the amount she gave the cashier.

So, the change Theo received is $10 - $7 = $3.

Therefore, Theo received $3 in change.
