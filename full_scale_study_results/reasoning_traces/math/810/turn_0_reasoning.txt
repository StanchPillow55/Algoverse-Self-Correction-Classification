Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

The number of students on campus doubles every month. This means that the number of students at the end of each month is 2 times the number of students at the beginning of that month. 

Let's calculate the number of students at the end of each month from January to May:

- At the end of January, the number of students is 2 * 10 = 20 students.
- At the end of February, the number of students is 2 * 20 = 40 students.
- At the end of March, the number of students is 2 * 40 = 80 students.
- At the end of April, the number of students is 2 * 80 = 160 students.
- At the end of May, the number of students is 2 * 160 = 320 students.

So, by the end of May, there are 320 students on campus.

The problem asks for the number of additional students who have joined by the end of May, above and beyond the number of students already on campus at the beginning of the year. 

The number of students on campus at the beginning of the year was 10. Therefore, the number of additional students who have joined by the end of May is 320 - 10 = 310 students.

So, 310 additional students would have joined by the end of May, above and beyond the number of students already on campus at the beginning of the year.
