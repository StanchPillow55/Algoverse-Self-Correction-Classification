==================================================

First, let's break down the problem step by step.

In the first 6 hours, Debra sees 30 bees leave the hive.

In the next 6 hours, she sees half of that number return, which is 30/2 = 15 bees.

In the following 6 hours, she sees two times as many bees as she saw first leave the hive fly from the hive and leave. This is 2*30 = 60 bees.

Finally, in the last 6 hours, every bee that left before that hadn't already returned returns to the hive. This means that all the bees that left in the first 6 hours and the third 6 hours return, except for the ones that already returned in the second 6 hours.

So, the total number of bees that left the hive is 30 (first 6 hours) + 60 (third 6 hours) = 90 bees.

15 of these bees already returned in the second 6 hours, so the number of bees that return in the last 6 hours is 90 - 15 = 75 bees.

So, Debra saw 75 bees return to the hive in the last 6 hours of the day.
