Question ID: 147
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. In the first 6 hours, Debra sees 30 bees leave the hive.

2. In the next 6 hours, she sees half of that number return. That's 30 bees / 2 = 15 bees.

3. In the following 6 hours, she sees two times the number of bees that she saw first leave the hive fly from the hive. That's 2 * 30 bees = 60 bees.

4. In the last 6 hours of the day, every bee that left before that hadn't already returned returns to the hive. This means all the bees that left in the first 6 hours and the third 6 hours, but didn't return in the second 6 hours, now return. 

To find this number, we need to add the number of bees that left in the first 6 hours and the third 6 hours, and then subtract the number of bees that returned in the second 6 hours. 

So, that's (30 bees + 60 bees) - 15 bees = 75 bees.

Therefore, Debra saw 75 bees return to the hive in the last 6 hours of the day.
