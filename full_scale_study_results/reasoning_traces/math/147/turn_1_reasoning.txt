Question ID: 147
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. In the first 6 hours, Debra sees 30 bees leave the hive.

2. In the next 6 hours, she sees half of that number return, which is 30/2 = 15 bees.

3. In the following 6 hours, she sees two times as many bees as she saw first leave the hive fly from the hive and leave. This is 2*30 = 60 bees.

4. In the last 6 hours, every bee that left before that hadn't already returned returns to the hive. This means the bees that left in the first 6 hours and didn't return yet (30-15 = 15 bees) and all the bees that left in the third 6 hours (60 bees) return to the hive.

So, the total number of bees that Debra sees return to the hive in the last 6 hours is 15 + 60 = 75 bees. 

Therefore, Debra saw 75 bees return to the hive in the last 6 hours of the day.
