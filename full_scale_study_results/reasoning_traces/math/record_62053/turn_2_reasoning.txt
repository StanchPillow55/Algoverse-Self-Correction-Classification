Question ID: record_62053
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to find the value of the placeholder @placeholder in the given passage.

Given information:
- The passage mentions that a 37-year-old man was arrested in connection with the attacks.
- However, it also states that "one-eyed Dale Cregan" is still on the loose and the police's main priority is to find him and arrest him.

Therefore, the value of the placeholder @placeholder is "Dale Cregan".

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The passage states that a 37-year-old man was arrested in connection with the attacks, but it does not mention his name.
2. The passage also mentions that "one-eyed Dale Cregan" is still on the loose and the police's main priority is to find him and arrest him.
3. Since the police's main priority is to find and arrest Dale Cregan, the value of the placeholder @placeholder must be "Dale Cregan".

Final answer:
The value of the placeholder @placeholder is "Dale Cregan".
