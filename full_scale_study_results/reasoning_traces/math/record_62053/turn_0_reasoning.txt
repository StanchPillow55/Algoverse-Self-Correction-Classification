==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to find the value of the placeholder @placeholder in the given passage.

Given information:
- The passage mentions that a 37-year-old man was arrested in connection with the attacks.
- However, it also states that "one-eyed Dale Cregan" is still on the loose and is the main priority for the police to arrest.

Therefore, the value of the placeholder @placeholder is "Dale Cregan".

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The passage states that a 37-year-old man was arrested in connection with the attacks, but it does not mention his name.
2. The passage also mentions that "one-eyed Dale Cregan" is still on the loose and is the main priority for the police to arrest.
3. Since the police are still searching for Dale Cregan, it can be inferred that he is the person they are referring to in the statement "our main priority continues to be finding @placeholder".

Final answer:
The value of the placeholder @placeholder is "Dale Cregan".
