Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to find out what the temperature will be during the night. We know that it's 33 degrees colder during the night compared to the day, and the day temperature was 45 degrees. So, we subtract 33 from 45 to find the night temperature:

45 - 33 = 12 degrees

So, the temperature during the night will be 12 degrees.

Next, we need to find out how many degrees Carson needs to heat the house up to prevent the pipes from freezing. We know that the pipes will freeze if the temperature falls below 32 degrees. So, we subtract the night temperature from 32 to find out how many degrees Carson needs to heat the house up:

32 - 12 = 20 degrees

So, Carson needs to heat the house up by 20 degrees to prevent the pipes from freezing.

Finally, we know that every log of wood Carson burns heats the house up by 5 degrees. So, we divide the number of degrees Carson needs to heat the house up by the number of degrees each log of wood heats the house up to find out how many logs Carson needs to burn:

20 รท 5 = 4 logs

So, Carson needs to burn 4 logs to prevent the pipes from freezing.
