Dataset Type: math
==================================================

Unfortunately, there is no mathematical problem or calculation to solve in the given passage. The passage is a news article discussing North Korea's relationship with the United States, and does not contain any numerical information or a math-based question.

The query "Black smoke was billowing somewhere in America," the caption in @placeholder reads" does not seem to be directly related to the content of the passage. The passage does not mention anything about black smoke billowing in America.

Without any numerical data or a clear math-based question, I am unable to provide a step-by-step solution or a final answer. This appears to be a reading comprehension or general knowledge question, rather than a math problem. I apologize that I cannot be more helpful in solving a math-based problem, as that is the type of task I am designed to assist with.
