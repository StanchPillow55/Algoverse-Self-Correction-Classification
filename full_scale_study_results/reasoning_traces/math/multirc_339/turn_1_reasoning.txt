==================================================

To solve this problem, I will go through the details provided in the paragraph and analyze how Jason reacts to the stranger who arrives with Susan.

Key details from the paragraph:
- A stranger in town meets pretty young Susan Martinez De La Cruz and accompanies her to a barbecue.
- At the barbecue, wealthy Jason Carberry is saying a few words for the recently departed Robin Randall, a citizen who got shot.
- Jason objects to the stranger's presence, being Susan's guardian and protective of her.
- He challenges the stranger to a shootout.

Reasoning:
1. The paragraph states that Jason Carberry is Susan's guardian and is protective of her.
2. When the stranger arrives with Susan, Jason objects to the stranger's presence, indicating that he is not comfortable with the stranger being with Susan.
3. As a result of this objection, Jason challenges the stranger to a shootout.

Final answer:
Jason reacts to the stranger who arrives with Susan by challenging him to a shootout.
