==================================================

Let's break down the problem step by step.

Step 1: Find the number of students who left through exit A.
We know that 30% of the students left through exit A. To find this number, we multiply the total number of students by 30% (or 0.30).

1000 students * 0.30 = 300 students

So, 300 students left through exit A.

Step 2: Find the number of students remaining in the hall after the first exit.
To find this number, we subtract the number of students who left through exit A from the total number of students.

1000 students - 300 students = 700 students

So, 700 students remained in the hall after the first exit.

Step 3: Find the number of students who left through exit B.
We know that 3/5 of the remaining students left through exit B. To find this number, we multiply the number of remaining students by 3/5.

700 students * 3/5 = 420 students

So, 420 students left through exit B.

Step 4: Find the number of students remaining in the hall after the second exit.
To find this number, we subtract the number of students who left through exit B from the number of students remaining after the first exit.

700 students - 420 students = 280 students

So, 280 students remained in the hall after the second exit.

Step 5: Find the number of students who left through exit C.
The problem states that the rest of the students left through exit C. This means that all the students remaining after the second exit left through exit C. So, the number of students who left through exit C is the same as the number of students remaining after the second exit.

Therefore, 280 students left through exit C. This is our final answer.
