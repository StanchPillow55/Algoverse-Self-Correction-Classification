Question ID: record_47047
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine which club the passage is referring to as "should not be rubbing shoulders with those clubs fighting to stay above water."

Given information:
- The passage mentions Everton's "floundering campaign" and their run of "one win in 12 games."
- It also mentions that Everton was held to a goalless draw by West Bromwich Albion.

Based on this information, the club being referred to is Everton.

The passage suggests that Everton, with their "promising young internationals allied with experienced old campaigners," should not be struggling and "rubbing shoulders with those clubs fighting to stay above water," implying that Everton should be performing better and competing at a higher level.

Therefore, the answer to the query is:
Everton
