Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine the missing word in the given passage.

Given information:
- The passage discusses Everton's recent poor performance in the Premier League, where they have gone six games without a win.
- The passage mentions that Everton's squad consists of "a number of promising young internationals allied with experienced old campaigners," suggesting that they should not be struggling to stay above water.
- The passage states that "that is what happens when clubs endure a run of one win in 12 games," implying that Everton's poor run of form has led to their current situation.

Based on the context, the missing word in the passage is likely to be "Everton," as the passage is discussing Everton's performance and their current position in the league.

Therefore, the complete sentence with the missing word filled in would be:

"Looking at the squad they have – a number of promising young internationals allied with experienced old campaigners – Everton should not be rubbing shoulders with those clubs fighting to stay above water but that is what happens when clubs endure a run of one win in 12 games."
