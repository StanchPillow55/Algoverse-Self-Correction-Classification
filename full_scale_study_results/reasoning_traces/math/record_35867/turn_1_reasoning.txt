==================================================

I do not have enough information to definitively determine the cause of Fernando Alonso's accident. The passage states that Alonso was "concussed and airlifted to hospital when his McLaren ran wide during winter testing", but it does not provide a clear explanation for what specifically caused the accident. 

The passage mentions that the accident occurred at the Circuit de Catalunya, which is the home of the Spanish Grand Prix, but it does not give any details about the weather conditions or other factors that may have contributed to the incident.

Without more specific details about the circumstances surrounding the accident, I cannot provide a complete step-by-step analysis or reasoning to determine the cause. The passage simply does not contain enough information to make a definitive conclusion about what led to Alonso's crash. The most I can say is that the passage indicates Alonso was injured and required hospitalization, but the exact cause is not clearly explained.

Therefore, I do not have a final answer to provide, as I cannot confidently determine the cause of the accident based solely on the information given in the passage. More details would be needed to thoroughly analyze and explain the reasoning behind the cause of Alonso's crash.
