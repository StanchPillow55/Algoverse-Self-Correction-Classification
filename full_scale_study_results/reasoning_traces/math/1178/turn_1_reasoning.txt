Question ID: 1178
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

Step 1: Identify the known quantities.
We know that Mike bought 5 face masks.

Step 2: Translate the problem into a mathematical expression.
The problem states that Johnny bought 2 more than thrice as many as Mike. This can be translated into the expression 3*5 + 2, where 3*5 represents thrice the number of masks Mike bought and 2 represents the additional masks Johnny bought.

Step 3: Solve the expression.
First, we calculate 3*5, which equals 15. Then, we add 2 to this result, which gives us 17.

So, Johnny bought 17 face masks.

Final Answer: Johnny bought 17 face masks.
