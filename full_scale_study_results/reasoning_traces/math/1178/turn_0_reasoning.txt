Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to find out how many face masks Johnny bought. The problem states that Johnny bought 2 more than thrice as many as Mike. 

We know that Mike bought 5 face masks. 

To find out how many Johnny bought, we first need to multiply the number of face masks Mike bought by 3. 

5 masks * 3 = 15 masks

This is the number of masks that Johnny would have bought if he bought exactly three times as many as Mike. However, the problem states that Johnny bought 2 more than this. 

So, we add 2 to the number of masks that Johnny would have bought if he bought exactly three times as many as Mike.

15 masks + 2 masks = 17 masks

Therefore, Johnny bought 17 face masks. 

So, the final answer is: Johnny bought 17 face masks.
