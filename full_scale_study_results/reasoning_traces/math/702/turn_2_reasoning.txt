Question ID: 702
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, let's find out how much gravel Gordy's truck can carry. Since we know that Gordy's truck can carry 800 pounds more than Gissela's truck, we add 800 pounds to the 4,000 pounds that Gissela's truck can carry. 

4,000 pounds + 800 pounds = 4,800 pounds

So, Gordy's truck can carry 4,800 pounds of gravel.

Next, let's find out how much gravel Gary's truck can carry. We know that the three trucks combined can carry 11,600 pounds of gravel. If we subtract the amount of gravel that Gissela's truck and Gordy's truck can carry from the total, we will find out how much gravel Gary's truck can carry.

11,600 pounds - 4,000 pounds - 4,800 pounds = 2,800 pounds

So, Gary's truck can carry 2,800 pounds of gravel. 

Final Answer: Gary's truck can carry 2,800 pounds of gravel.
