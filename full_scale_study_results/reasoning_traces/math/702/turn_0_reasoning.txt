Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, let's find out how much gravel Gordy's truck can carry. Since we know that Gordy's truck can carry 800 pounds more than Gissela's truck, we add 800 to the amount Gissela's truck can carry. 

Gissela's truck: 4,000 pounds
Gordy's truck: 4,000 pounds + 800 pounds = 4,800 pounds

Now, we know that the total amount of gravel the three trucks can carry is 11,600 pounds. To find out how much Gary's truck can carry, we subtract the amount Gissela's and Gordy's trucks can carry from the total.

Total: 11,600 pounds
Gissela's and Gordy's trucks: 4,000 pounds + 4,800 pounds = 8,800 pounds

So, Gary's truck can carry: 11,600 pounds - 8,800 pounds = 2,800 pounds

Therefore, Gary's truck can carry 2,800 pounds of gravel.
