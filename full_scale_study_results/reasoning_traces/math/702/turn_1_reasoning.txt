Question ID: 702
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, let's find out how much gravel Gordy's truck can carry. Since we know that Gordy's truck can carry 800 pounds more than Gissela's truck, we can add 800 to the amount Gissela's truck can carry. 

Gissela's truck: 4,000 pounds
Gordy's truck: 4,000 pounds + 800 pounds = 4,800 pounds

Next, let's find out how much gravel Gary's truck can carry. We know that the three trucks combined can carry 11,600 pounds of gravel. If we subtract the amount that Gissela's and Gordy's trucks can carry from the total, we'll find out how much Gary's truck can carry.

Total: 11,600 pounds
Gissela's and Gordy's trucks combined: 4,000 pounds + 4,800 pounds = 8,800 pounds

Gary's truck: 11,600 pounds - 8,800 pounds = 2,800 pounds

So, Gary's truck can carry 2,800 pounds of gravel.
