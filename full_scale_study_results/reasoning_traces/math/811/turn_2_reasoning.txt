Question ID: 811
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to determine how many branches Felix climbed in total during the week. To do this, we divide the total amount of money he made by the cost per branch. 

So, $105 รท $.25 = 420 branches

Next, we need to find out how many branches he climbed on average each day. Since there are 7 days in a week, we divide the total number of branches by 7.

So, 420 branches รท 7 days = 60 branches per day

Therefore, on average, Felix climbed 60 branches per day.
