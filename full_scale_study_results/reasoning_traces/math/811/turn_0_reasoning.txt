Question ID: 811
Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to find out how many branches Felix climbed in total during the week. Since he charges $.25 per branch, we can find the total number of branches by dividing the total amount he made by the cost per branch. 

So, $105 รท $.25 = 420 branches

Next, we need to find out how many branches he climbed on average per day. Since there are 7 days in a week, we can find the average number of branches climbed per day by dividing the total number of branches by 7.

So, 420 branches รท 7 days = 60 branches/day

Therefore, Felix climbed an average of 60 branches per day.
