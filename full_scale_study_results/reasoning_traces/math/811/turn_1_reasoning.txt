Question ID: 811
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to determine how many branches Felix climbed in total during the week. Since he charges $.25 per branch, we can find the total number of branches by dividing the total amount he made, $105, by the cost per branch, $.25. 

So, $105 รท $.25 = 420 branches.

Next, we need to find out how many branches he climbed on average per day. Since there are 7 days in a week, we can find this by dividing the total number of branches by 7.

So, 420 branches รท 7 days = 60 branches per day.

Therefore, on average, Felix climbed 60 branches per day.
