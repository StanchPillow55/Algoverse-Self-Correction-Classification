Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to find out how many words John can speak per minute after his training. His starting speed was 150 words per minute (WPM), and after training, his speed is 2.5 times faster. So, we multiply his starting speed by 2.5:

150 WPM * 2.5 = 375 WPM

This means that after training, John can speak 375 words per minute.

Next, we need to find out how many words are in 10 pages. Each page has 450 words, so we multiply the number of pages by the number of words per page:

10 pages * 450 words/page = 4500 words

So, there are 4500 words in 10 pages.

Finally, we need to find out how long it would take John to speak 4500 words at a speed of 375 words per minute. We divide the total number of words by the number of words he can speak per minute:

4500 words / 375 WPM = 12 minutes

So, it would take John 12 minutes to speak 10 pages at his new speaking speed.
