Question ID: 1262
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to find out how many words John can speak per minute after his training. His starting speed is 150 words per minute (WPM), and after training, his speed is 2.5 times faster. So we multiply his starting speed by 2.5:

150 WPM * 2.5 = 375 WPM

Next, we need to find out how many words are in 10 pages. If each page has 450 words, we multiply the number of pages by the number of words per page:

10 pages * 450 words/page = 4500 words

Finally, we need to find out how long it would take John to speak 4500 words at a speed of 375 WPM. We divide the total number of words by his speaking speed:

4500 words / 375 WPM = 12 minutes

So, it would take John 12 minutes to speak 10 pages of text at his new speaking speed.
