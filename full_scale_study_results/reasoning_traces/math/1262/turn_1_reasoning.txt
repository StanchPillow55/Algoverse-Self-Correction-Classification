Question ID: 1262
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to determine the total number of words John needs to speak. If each page has 450 words and he needs to speak 10 pages, then the total number of words is 450 words/page * 10 pages = 4500 words.

Next, we need to find out John's new speaking speed after training. If his starting speed was 150 words per minute (WPM) and his speed after training is 2.5 times faster, then his new speed is 150 WPM * 2.5 = 375 WPM.

Finally, we can calculate how long it would take him to speak 4500 words at a speed of 375 WPM. We do this by dividing the total number of words by his speed: 4500 words / 375 WPM = 12 minutes.

So, it would take John 12 minutes to speak 10 pages at his new speed.
