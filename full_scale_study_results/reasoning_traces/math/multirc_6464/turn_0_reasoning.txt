==================================================

To solve this problem, I will carefully read the given paragraph and extract the relevant information to determine the answer.

The key information from the paragraph is:
- Steve Wynn, the owner of the Golden Nugget, bought several Strip properties, including the Silver Slipper and Castaways.
- Wynn demolished these properties to make way for a new kind of resort - the Mirage, which became an instant success.

Therefore, the answer to the question "The owner of the Golden Nugget demolished several Strip properties to build what?" is:
The Mirage

The reasoning is as follows:
1. Steve Wynn, the owner of the Golden Nugget, bought several Strip properties, including the Silver Slipper and Castaways.
2. Wynn demolished these properties to make way for a new kind of resort - the Mirage.
3. The Mirage became an instant success.

So, the owner of the Golden Nugget demolished the Silver Slipper and Castaways to build the Mirage resort.
