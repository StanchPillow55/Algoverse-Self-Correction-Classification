==================================================

Step 1: Determine the number of bags sold

The orchard sells apples in bags of 10. This means that each bag contains 10 apples. If the orchard sold a total of 2000 apples, we can determine the number of bags sold by dividing the total number of apples sold by the number of apples in each bag.

Number of bags sold = Total number of apples sold / Number of apples in each bag
Number of bags sold = 2000 apples / 10 apples/bag
Number of bags sold = 200 bags

Step 2: Calculate the earnings

The orchard sells each bag of apples for $5. To find out how much the orchard earned from selling 200 bags, we multiply the number of bags sold by the price per bag.

Earnings = Number of bags sold * Price per bag
Earnings = 200 bags * $5/bag
Earnings = $1000

So, the orchard earned $1000 for selling 2000 apples.
