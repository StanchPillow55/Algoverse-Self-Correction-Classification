Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to determine how many bags of apples were sold. Since each bag contains 10 apples, we divide the total number of apples sold by the number of apples in each bag. 

So, 2000 apples รท 10 apples/bag = 200 bags

Next, we need to calculate the total earnings from selling these bags. We do this by multiplying the number of bags sold by the price per bag.

So, 200 bags * $5/bag = $1000

Therefore, the orchard earned $1000 for selling 2000 apples.
