Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Sheila initially charged $85.00 worth of merchandise on her credit card.

2. She returned one item that cost $15.00. So, we subtract $15.00 from the initial amount. 

   $85.00 - $15.00 = $70.00

   So, after returning the item, the balance on her credit card is $70.00.

3. Then, she bought a frying pan that was on sale for 20% off $20.00. To find out how much she paid for the frying pan, we first need to calculate the discount. 

   20% of $20.00 = 0.20 * $20.00 = $4.00

   So, the frying pan was $4.00 cheaper. Therefore, she paid $20.00 - $4.00 = $16.00 for the frying pan.

4. She also bought a set of towels that was 10% off $30.00. Again, we first need to calculate the discount.

   10% of $30.00 = 0.10 * $30.00 = $3.00

   So, the set of towels was $3.00 cheaper. Therefore, she paid $30.00 - $3.00 = $27.00 for the set of towels.

5. Now, we add the cost of the frying pan and the set of towels to the balance on her credit card.

   $70.00 + $16.00 + $27.00 = $113.00

So, the new balance on Sheila's credit card is $113.00.
