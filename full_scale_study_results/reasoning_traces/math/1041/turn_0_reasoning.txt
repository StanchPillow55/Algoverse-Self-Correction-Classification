Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to calculate the total cost for the chicken salad. Since 10 people want the chicken salad and it costs $6.50 per person, we multiply the number of people by the cost per person.

10 people * $6.50/person = $65

Next, we calculate the total cost for the pasta salad. Since 6 people want the pasta salad and it costs $6 per person, we multiply the number of people by the cost per person.

6 people * $6/person = $36

Finally, we add the cost of the chicken salad and the pasta salad to find the total cost of the catering.

$65 + $36 = $101

So, Molly will pay $101 for the catering.
