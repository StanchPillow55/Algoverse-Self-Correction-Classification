Question ID: record_46000
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given passage and determine the appropriate response to the query.

Given information:
- Tyson Fury dominated Dereck Chisora for 10 rounds before Chisora's corner pulled him out of the fight.
- Fury controlled the fight with his jab and never allowed Chisora to trouble him on the inside.
- Chisora's right eye was badly damaged and almost shut when he was retired on his stool.

Query: When they put a halt to proceedings so predictable that @placeholder clearly had no chance of winning, the arena gave a collective sigh of relief.

To answer this query, we need to fill in the placeholder with the appropriate name.

Based on the information provided in the passage, it is clear that Tyson Fury was dominating the fight and Dereck Chisora had no chance of winning. Therefore, the placeholder should be filled with "Chisora".

The complete response would be:

When they put a halt to proceedings so predictable that Chisora clearly had no chance of winning, the arena gave a collective sigh of relief.

This response is consistent
