==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given information and determine the appropriate response.

Given information:
- Tyson Fury dominated Dereck Chisora for 10 rounds before Chisora's corner pulled him out.
- Fury controlled the fight with his jab and did not allow Chisora to trouble him on the inside.
