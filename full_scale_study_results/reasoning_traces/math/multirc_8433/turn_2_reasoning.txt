Question ID: multirc_8433
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to analyze the information provided in the paragraph and determine the directions in which Wegener proposed the rocks drifted apart.

Given information:
- Wegener noticed that the rocks on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean were the same type and age.
- Wegener proposed that the rocks must have formed side by side and then drifted apart.
- One part of the rocks went with North America, and the other part stayed with Europe.

Reasoning:
1. The paragraph states that Wegener noticed the rocks on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean were the same type and age.
2. This suggests that the rocks were originally connected and formed side by side.
3. Wegener then proposed that these rocks drifted apart, with one part going with North America and the other part staying with Europe.
4. This means that the rocks drifted in opposite directions, with one part moving towards North America and the other part staying with Europe.

Final answer:
Wegener proposed that the rocks drifted apart in opposite directions, with one part going with North America and the other part staying with Europe.
