==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to understand the key information provided in the paragraph and then use it to determine the directions in which the rocks drifted apart according to Wegener's proposal.

Given information:
- Wegener noticed that the rocks on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean were the same type and age.
- Wegener proposed that the rocks must have formed side by side and then drifted apart.
- One part of the rocks went with North America, and the other part stayed with Europe.

Reasoning:
Based on the information provided, we can infer that Wegener proposed that the rocks drifted apart in the following directions:

1. One part of the rocks went with North America.
   - This means that the rocks that were originally side by side with the rocks in Europe drifted away and became part of the North American continent.

2. The other part of the rocks stayed with Europe.
   - This means that the rocks that were originally side by side with the rocks in North America remained in the European continent.

Therefore, according to Wegener's proposal, the rocks drifted apart in the following directions:
- One part went with North America,
