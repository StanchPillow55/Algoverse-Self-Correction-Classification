Let's denote the number of queens as Q, the number of baby bees as B, and the number of worker bees as W.

From the problem, we know that:

1) W = 2B (there are twice as many worker bees as baby bees)
2) B = 2Q (there are twice as many babies as queens)
3) W + B + Q = 700 (the total number of bees is 700)

We can substitute B from the second equation into the first equation to get W = 2 * 2Q = 4Q.

Now we can substitute B = 2Q and W = 4Q into the third equation:

4Q + 2Q + Q = 700
7Q = 700
Q = 700 / 7 = 100

Substituting Q = 100 into B = 2Q, we get B = 200.

Substituting B = 200 into W = 2B, we get W = 400.

So, there are 400 worker bees in the hive.
