==================================================

Let's denote the number of queens as Q, the number of baby bees as B, and the number of worker bees as W.

From the problem, we know that there are twice as many baby bees as queens, so we can write this as B = 2Q.

We also know that there are twice as many worker bees as baby bees, so we can write this as W = 2B.

Finally, we know that the total number of bees is 700, so we can write this as Q + B + W = 700.

Now we have a system of three equations, and we can solve it step by step.

First, let's substitute B and W from the first two equations into the third equation:

Q + 2Q + 2(2Q) = 700
Q + 2Q + 4Q = 700
7Q = 700

Now, we can solve for Q by dividing both sides of the equation by 7:

Q = 700 / 7
Q = 100

Now that we know Q, we can find B and W:

B = 2Q = 2*100 = 200
W = 2B = 2*200 = 400

So, there are 400 worker bees in the hive.
