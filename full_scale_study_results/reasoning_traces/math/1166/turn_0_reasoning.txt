==================================================

Let's start by calculating the amount of fruits each tree produces per year:

- A 5-year-old tree produces 50 fruits.
- A 6-year-old tree produces 3 times the initial amount, which is 3*50 = 150 fruits.
- A 7-year-old tree produces 7 times the initial amount, which is 7*50 = 350 fruits.
- A 10-year-old tree produces 20 times the initial amount, which is 20*50 = 1000 fruits.
- An 8-year-old tree produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old one, which is 1000 - 200 = 800 fruits.
- During the ninth year, the tree doesn't produce any fruit, so it produces 0 fruits.

Now, let's add up all the fruits the tree produces during its 10 years of life:

50 (5-year-old) + 150 (6-year-old) + 350 (7-year-old) + 800 (8-year-old) + 0 (9-year-old) + 1000 (10-year-old) = 2350 fruits.

So, an avocado tree can produce a total of 2350 fruits during its 10 years of life.
