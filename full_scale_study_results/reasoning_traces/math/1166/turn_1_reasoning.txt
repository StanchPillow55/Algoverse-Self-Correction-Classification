==================================================

Let's break down the problem year by year:

1. A 5-year-old avocado tree produces 50 fruits. So, in the 5th year, the tree produces 50 fruits.
2. A 6-year-old tree produces 3 times the initial amount of fruits. So, in the 6th year, the tree produces 3 * 50 = 150 fruits.
3. A 7-year-old tree produces 7 times the initial amount. So, in the 7th year, the tree produces 7 * 50 = 350 fruits.
4. An 8-year-old tree produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old one. We don't know yet how many fruits a 10-year-old tree produces, so we can't calculate this yet.
5. During the ninth year, the tree doesn't produce any fruit. So, in the 9th year, the tree produces 0 fruits.
6. A 10-year-old tree produces 20 times the initial amount of fruits. So, in the 10th year, the tree produces 20 * 50 = 1000 fruits.

Now we can go back to the 8th year. An 8-year-old tree produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old one. So, in the 8th year, the tree produces 1000 - 200 = 800 fruits.

Adding up all the fruits produced in each year, we get:

50 (5th year) + 150 (6th year) + 350 (7th year) + 800 (8th year) + 0 (9th year) + 1000 (10th year) = 2350 fruits.

So, an avocado tree can produce a total of 2350 fruits during its first 10 years of life.
