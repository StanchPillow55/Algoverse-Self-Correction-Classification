==================================================

The problem states that it rained 2 inches on Monday. It also states that it is expected to rain 1 more inch than twice of Monday's total on Tuesday.

To find out how much it will rain on Tuesday, we first need to calculate twice of Monday's total. 

Twice of Monday's total is 2 inches * 2 = 4 inches.

The problem then states that it will rain 1 more inch than this total on Tuesday. So, we add 1 inch to the 4 inches.

4 inches + 1 inch = 5 inches.

So, it is expected to rain 5 inches on Tuesday.
