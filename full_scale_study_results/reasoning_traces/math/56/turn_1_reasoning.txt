Question ID: 56
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to determine how much money Peter spends each time he goes to the movies. He spends $7 on a ticket and $7 on popcorn, so each trip to the movies costs him $7 + $7 = $14.

Next, we need to figure out how many times Peter can afford to go to the movies with the $42 he has for the week. To do this, we divide the total amount of money he has by the cost of each trip to the movies. 

So, $42 รท $14 = 3.

Therefore, Peter can afford to go to the movies 3 times this week.
