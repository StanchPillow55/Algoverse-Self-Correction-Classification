==================================================

The cost of going to the movies for Peter is the sum of the ticket price and the popcorn price. 

So, the total cost for one movie outing is $7 (ticket) + $7 (popcorn) = $14.

Peter has $42 for the week. To find out how many times he can go to the movies, we need to divide the total amount of money he has by the cost of one movie outing.

So, the number of times Peter can go to the movies is $42 รท $14 = 3 times.

Therefore, Peter can go to the movies 3 times this week.
