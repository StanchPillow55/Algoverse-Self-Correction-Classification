==================================================

Let's solve this problem step by step.

1. Larry has 3 cats.

2. He has 3 times as many dogs as cats. So, he has 3 * 3 = <<3*3=9>>9 dogs.

3. He has 2 fewer rabbits than dogs. So, he has 9 - 2 = <<9-2=7>>7 rabbits.

4. He has a fish tank with three times the number of fish as rabbits. So, he has 3 * 7 = <<3*7=21>>21 fish.

5. He also has a collection of gerbils that's 1/3 the number of fish he has. So, he has 21 / 3 = <<21/3=7>>7 gerbils.

Adding all these up, Larry has 3 cats + 9 dogs + 7 rabbits + 21 fish + 7 gerbils = <<3+9+7+21+7=47>>47 pets.

So, Larry has 47 pets.
