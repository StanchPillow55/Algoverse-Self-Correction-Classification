Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, let's determine how many letters are in the alphabet. There are 26 letters in the English alphabet.

Elise writes the alphabet in full twice. This means she writes 26 letters * 2 = <<26*2=52>>52 letters.

Then, she writes half of the alphabet once. Half of 26 is 13, so she writes an additional 13 letters.

So far, Elise has written 52 + 13 = <<52+13=65>>65 letters.

Then, Elise re-writes everything she has already written. This means she writes another 65 letters.

So, in total, Elise has written 65 + 65 = <<65+65=130>>130 letters. 

Therefore, Elise has written 130 letters in total.
