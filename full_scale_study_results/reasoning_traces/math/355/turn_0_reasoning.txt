==================================================

Let's solve this step by step.

Step 1: Identify the height of the second tree.
The problem states that the second tree is 5 feet taller than the shortest tree. Since the shortest tree is 6 feet tall, we add 5 feet to find the height of the second tree.

6 feet (shortest tree) + 5 feet = 11 feet (second tree)

Step 2: Find the combined height of the shortest and second tree.
We add the heights of the shortest and second tree to find their combined height.

6 feet (shortest tree) + 11 feet (second tree) = 17 feet (combined height)

Step 3: Identify the height of the tallest tree.
The problem states that the tallest tree is twice the height of the two trees combined. So, we multiply the combined height of the two trees by 2 to find the height of the tallest tree.

17 feet (combined height) x 2 = 34 feet (tallest tree)

So, the tallest tree in Eddy's backyard is 34 feet tall.
