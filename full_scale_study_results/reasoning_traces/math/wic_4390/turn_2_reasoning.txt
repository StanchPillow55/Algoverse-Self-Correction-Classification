==================================================

To determine if the word 'head' is used with the same meaning in both sentences, we need to analyze the context and usage of the word in each sentence.

Sentence 1: "We will consider performance issues under the head of future improvements."
In this sentence, the word 'head' is used to refer to a category or topic under which the performance issues will be considered. The phrase "under the head of" suggests that the performance issues are being grouped or organized under the broader category of "future improvements."

Sentence 2: "Under the head of minor Roman poets."
In this sentence, the word 'head' is used in a similar way, but it refers to a different category or topic. Here, the phrase "under the head of" indicates that the minor Roman poets are being discussed or considered as a group or category.

Based on the analysis, the word 'head' is used with the same meaning in both sentences. In both cases, it is used to refer to a category or topic under which something is being considered or organized.

Therefore, the answer is:
Yes, the word 'head' is used with the same meaning in both sentences.
