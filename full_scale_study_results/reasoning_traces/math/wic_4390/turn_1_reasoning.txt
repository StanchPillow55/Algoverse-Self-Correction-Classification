==================================================

To determine if the word 'head' is used with the same meaning in both sentences, we need to analyze the context and usage of the word in each sentence.

Sentence 1: "We will consider performance issues under the head of future improvements."
In this sentence, the word 'head' is used to refer to a category or topic under which performance issues will be considered. The phrase "under the head of" suggests that "future improvements" is the main category or heading under which the performance issues will be discussed.

Sentence 2: "Under the head of minor Roman poets."
In this sentence, the word 'head' is also used to refer to a category or topic, but in this case, it is the category of "minor Roman poets" that is being discussed.

Based on the analysis, the word 'head' is used with the same meaning in both sentences, which is to refer to a category or topic under which something is being considered or discussed.

Therefore, the answer is:
Yes, the word 'head' is used with the same meaning in both sentences.
