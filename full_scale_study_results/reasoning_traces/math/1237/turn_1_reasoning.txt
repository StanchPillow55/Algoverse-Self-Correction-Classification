Question ID: 1237
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to find out the total number of teachers who were present at Rydell Elementary School last Friday. 

We know that the total number of teachers at the school is 82. However, 13 of them were sick and therefore not at school. 

So, we subtract the number of sick teachers from the total number of teachers:

82 (total teachers) - 13 (sick teachers) = 69 teachers

This means that there were 69 teachers from the school who were present. 

However, we also know that there were 9 substitute teachers called in to help. So, we need to add these substitute teachers to the number of teachers who were present:

69 (teachers present) + 9 (substitute teachers) = 78 teachers

So, there were 78 teachers at Rydell Elementary School last Friday. 

Final Answer: There were 78 teachers at school that day.
