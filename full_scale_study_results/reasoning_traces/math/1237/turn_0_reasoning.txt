Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to find out how many teachers were not sick. We do this by subtracting the number of sick teachers from the total number of teachers. 

The total number of teachers at Rydell Elementary School is 82. The number of teachers who were sick is 13. 

So, 82 - 13 = 69 teachers were not sick.

Next, we add the number of substitute teachers who were called in to help. There were 9 substitute teachers.

So, 69 + 9 = 78 teachers were at school that day.

Therefore, there were 78 teachers at Rydell Elementary School last Friday.
