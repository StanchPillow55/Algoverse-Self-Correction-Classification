Question ID: 1054
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To determine the total cost of renovating your kitchen floor with new tiles, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the Number of Tiles Needed:**
   - Each tile is a square with a side length of 1 foot, so the area of each tile is \(1 \text{ ft} \times 1 \text{ ft} = 1 \text{ SqFt}\).
   - The total area of the kitchen floor is 200 SqFt.
   - Since each tile covers 1 SqFt, you will need 200 tiles to cover the entire floor.

2. **Calculate the Total Cost:**
   - Each tile costs $12.
   - The total cost for 200 tiles is calculated by multiplying the number of tiles by the cost per tile:
   \[
   \text{Total Cost} = 200 \text{ tiles} \times 12 \text{ dollars/tile} = 2400 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Therefore, the total cost to renovate your kitchen floor with the new tiles is **$2400**.
