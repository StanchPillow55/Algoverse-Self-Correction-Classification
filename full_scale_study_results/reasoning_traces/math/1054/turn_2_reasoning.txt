Question ID: 1054
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine how many square tiles are required to cover the entire kitchen floor and then calculate the total cost based on the price per tile.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Determine the Area of the Kitchen Floor:**
   - The total area of the kitchen floor is given as 200 square feet (SqFt).

2. **Determine the Area Covered by One Tile:**
   - Each tile is square with a side length of 1 foot.
   - Therefore, the area of one tile is:
     \[
     \text{Area of one tile} = 1 \text{ ft} \times 1 \text{ ft} = 1 \text{ SqFt}
     \]

3. **Calculate the Number of Tiles Needed:**
   - Since each tile covers 1 SqFt, the number of tiles needed is equal to the total area of the kitchen floor.
   - Therefore, the number of tiles required is:
     \[
     \text{Number of tiles} = \frac{\text{Total area of the floor}}{\text{Area of one tile}} = \frac{200 \text{ SqFt}}{1 \text{ SqFt/tile}} = 200 \text{ tiles}
     \]

4. **Calculate the Total Cost:**
   - Each tile costs $12.
   - Therefore, the total cost for 200 tiles is:
     \[
     \text{Total cost} = \text{Number of tiles} \times \text{Cost per tile} = 200 \times 12 = 2400 \text{ dollars}
     \]

### Final Answer:
The total cost to renovate the kitchen floor with new square tiles is $2400.
