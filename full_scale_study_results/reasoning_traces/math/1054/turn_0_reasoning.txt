Question ID: 1054
Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

The area of each square tile is 1 SqFt (since each side is 1ft in length and the area of a square is side length squared). 

Since the total area of the kitchen floor is 200 SqFt, you will need 200 tiles to cover the entire floor (since 200 SqFt / 1 SqFt per tile = 200 tiles).

Each tile costs $12, so the total cost for the tiles will be 200 tiles * $12 per tile = $2400.

So, it will cost $2400 to renovate the kitchen floor with these tiles.
