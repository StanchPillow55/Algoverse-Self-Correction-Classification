Question ID: 1071
Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, let's find out how many people Kayla invited in total. She invited 25 classmates, 7 girls from her dance class, and 13 family members. 

25 classmates + 7 dance class girls + 13 family members = 45 people invited

However, 4 people said they could not come, so we subtract those from the total number of people invited:

45 people - 4 people = 41 people will attend

The theater rental fee covers the first 20 people. So, we subtract 20 from the total number of attendees to find out how many additional guests there are:

41 people - 20 people = 21 additional guests

The cost for each additional guest is $6. So, we multiply the number of additional guests by the cost per additional guest:

21 additional guests * $6/additional guest = $126 for additional guests

Finally, we add the cost of the additional guests to the base theater rental fee to find the total cost of the party:

$125 for theater rental + $126 for additional guests = $251

So, the total cost of the party will be $251.
