Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, let's calculate how many rewards the customer earned from their last shopping trip. They spent $80 and for every $20 they spend, they get $1 off. So, we divide $80 by $20 to find out how many rewards they earned:

$80 รท $20 = 4 rewards

So, the customer earned 4 rewards from their last shopping trip.

Next, let's calculate how much the coupon was worth. The problem states that the coupon was worth twice the amount of rewards. So, we multiply the number of rewards by 2 to find out how much the coupon was worth:

4 rewards x 2 = $8

So, the coupon was worth $8.

Now, let's calculate how much the customer paid on this shopping trip. They spent $43, but they used their rewards and the coupon. The rewards are worth $1 each, so we subtract the value of the rewards and the coupon from the total amount spent:

$43 - $4 (rewards) - $8 (coupon) = $31

So, the customer paid $31 on this shopping trip.
