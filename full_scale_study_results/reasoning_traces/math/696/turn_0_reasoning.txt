==================================================

Let's start by calculating how many points each student has collected.

We know that Adam has collected 50 points.

Betty has collected 30% more points than Adam. To find out how many points Betty has collected, we calculate 30% of 50 and add it to 50. 

30% of 50 is (30/100) * 50 = 15 points.

So, Betty has collected 50 + 15 = 65 points.

Tom has 30 points less than Betty. So, Tom has collected 65 - 30 = 35 points.

Marta has collected 3 times more points than Tom. So, Marta has collected 3 * 35 = 105 points.

Now, let's add up all the points collected by the students to find out how many points they have in total.

The total points collected by the students is 50 (Adam) + 65 (Betty) + 35 (Tom) + 105 (Marta) = 255 points.

The minimum threshold to go on the trip is 400 points. So, to find out how many points the class is missing to go on the trip, we subtract the total points collected by the students from the minimum threshold.

The class is missing 400 - 255 = 145 points to go on the trip.

So, the final answer is that the class is missing 145 points to go on the trip.
