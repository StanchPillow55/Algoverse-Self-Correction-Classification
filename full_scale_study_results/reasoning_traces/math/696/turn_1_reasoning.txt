Question ID: 696
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, let's find out how many points Betty has collected. Since Betty collected 30% more points than Adam, we calculate 30% of Adam's points, which is 0.30 * 50 = 15 points. So, Betty has 50 + 15 = 65 points.

Next, we find out how many points Tom has. Since Tom has 30 points less than Betty, we subtract 30 from Betty's points, which gives us 65 - 30 = 35 points.

Then, we find out how many points Marta has. Since Marta has 3 times more points than Tom, we multiply Tom's points by 3, which gives us 3 * 35 = 105 points.

Now, we add up all the points collected by the students: Adam's 50 points + Betty's 65 points + Tom's 35 points + Marta's 105 points = 255 points.

Finally, we find out how many points the class is missing to reach the minimum threshold of 400 points. We subtract the total points collected by the students from the minimum threshold, which gives us 400 - 255 = 145 points.

So, the class is missing 145 points to go on the trip.
