Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, let's break down the number of students by age group. According to the problem, half of the 3000 students are over 16 years old, and the other half are under 16 years old. 

So, the number of students over 16 years old is 3000/2 = 1500 students.
Similarly, the number of students under 16 years old is also 3000/2 = 1500 students.

Next, let's find out the number of male students in each age group. 

According to the problem, one-fourth of the students over 16 years old are male. So, the number of male students over 16 years old is 1500/4 = 375 students.

Similarly, one-half of the students under 16 years old are male. So, the number of male students under 16 years old is 1500/2 = 750 students.

Now, let's add up the total number of male students in the school. The total number of male students is 375 (over 16 years old) + 750 (under 16 years old) = 1125 students.

Finally, to find the total number of female students, we subtract the total number of male students from the total number of students in the school. 

So, the total number of female students is 3000 (total students) - 1125 (male students) = 1875 students.

Therefore, there are 1875 female students enrolled at Brook Hills High School.
