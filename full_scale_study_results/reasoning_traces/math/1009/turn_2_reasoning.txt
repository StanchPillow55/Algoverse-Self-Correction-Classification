Question ID: 1009
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, let's find out how many students are over 16 years old and how many are under 16 years old. Since half of the students are over 16, that means there are 3000 / 2 = 1500 students over 16 years old. Similarly, there are also 1500 students under 16 years old.

Next, let's find out how many of these students are male. One-fourth of the students over 16 years old are male, so there are 1500 / 4 = 375 male students over 16 years old. Half of the students under 16 years old are male, so there are 1500 / 2 = 750 male students under 16 years old.

Adding these two groups together, there are 375 + 750 = 1125 male students in total.

Since the total number of students is 3000, the number of female students is 3000 - 1125 = 1875.

So, there are 1875 female students enrolled at Brook Hills High School.
