==================================================

Let's break down the problem into smaller parts.

First, we know that the total number of students is 3000.

Half of these students are over 16 years old, which means there are 3000/2 = 1500 students over 16 years old.

One-fourth of the students over 16 years old are male. So, the number of male students over 16 years old is 1500/4 = 375.

This means the number of female students over 16 years old is 1500 - 375 = 1125.

The remaining half of the students are under 16 years old, which means there are also 1500 students under 16 years old.

One-half of the students under 16 years old are male. So, the number of male students under 16 years old is 1500/2 = 750.

This means the number of female students under 16 years old is 1500 - 750 = 750.

To find the total number of female students, we add the number of female students over 16 years old to the number of female students under 16 years old. 

So, the total number of female students is 1125 + 750 = 1875.

Therefore, there are 1875 female students enrolled at Brook Hills High School.
