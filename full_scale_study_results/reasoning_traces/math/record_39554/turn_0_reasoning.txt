To solve this problem, we need to find the number of French troops that will remain in Afghanistan after the withdrawal of 500 troops from the Nijrab base.

Given information:
- France has been preparing for the handover of combat operations to Afghan forces for months.
- France has recently focused on training Afghan forces instead of having French troops lead patrols in the Kapisa region.
- 500 French combat soldiers have been withdrawn from the Nijrab base in the Kapisa region.

To find the number of French troops that will remain in Afghanistan after the withdrawal, we need to consider the following:

1. The total number of French troops in Afghanistan before the withdrawal:
   - The passage does not provide the exact total number of French troops in Afghanistan.
   - However, it mentions that the 500 troops withdrawn were "combat soldiers," implying that there were additional non-combat troops in Afghanistan.
   - Without further information, we cannot determine the exact total number of French troops in Afghanistan before the withdrawal.

2. The number of French troops that will remain in Afghanistan after the withdrawal:
   - The passage states that France has been preparing for the handover of combat operations to Afghan
