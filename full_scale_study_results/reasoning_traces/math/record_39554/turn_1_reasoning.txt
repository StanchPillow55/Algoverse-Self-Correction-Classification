==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to find the number of French troops that will remain in Afghanistan after the withdrawal of 500 troops from the Nijrab base.

Given information:
- France has been preparing for the handover of combat operations to Afghan forces for months.
- Recently, France has been focusing on training Afghan forces instead of having French troops lead patrols in the Kapisa region.
- 500 French combat soldiers have been withdrawn from the Nijrab base in the Kapisa region.

To find the number of French troops that will remain in Afghanistan, we need to consider the total number of French troops deployed in Afghanistan before the withdrawal.

Step 1: Determine the total number of French troops deployed in Afghanistan before the withdrawal.
The passage does not provide the exact number of French troops deployed in Afghanistan before the withdrawal. However, it mentions that the 500 troops withdrawn were "combat soldiers," which suggests that there were likely additional non-combat troops in Afghanistan as well.

Without a specific number provided, we can make a reasonable assumption that the total number of French troops in Afghanistan before the withdrawal was around 1,000. This is a common troop deployment size for a country like France
