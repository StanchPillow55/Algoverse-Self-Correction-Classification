Question ID: 1188
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to work backwards from the current age of John. 

Step 1: Determine John's age when Digimon came out
Since Digimon had its 20th anniversary, it means it came out 20 years ago. If John is 28 now, he would have been 28 - 20 = 8 years old when Digimon came out.

Step 2: Determine Jim's age when Digimon came out
The problem states that when Digimon came out, John was twice as old as Jim. If John was 8 years old, then Jim would have been 8 / 2 = 4 years old when Digimon came out.

Step 3: Determine Jim's current age
Since Digimon came out 20 years ago, and Jim was 4 years old then, Jim would be 4 + 20 = 24 years old now.

So, Jim is 24 years old.
