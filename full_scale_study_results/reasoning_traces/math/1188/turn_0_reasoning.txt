==================================================

Let's denote John's age when Digimon came out as J1 and Jim's age at that time as J2. We know that Digimon had its 20th anniversary, so it came out 20 years ago. 

We also know that John is 28 now, so 20 years ago, when Digimon came out, John was 28 - 20 = 8 years old. So, J1 = 8.

The problem also tells us that when Digimon came out, John was twice as old as Jim. This means that J1 = 2 * J2. 

We can substitute J1 = 8 into this equation to find J2. So, 8 = 2 * J2. 

To solve for J2, we divide both sides of the equation by 2: J2 = 8 / 2 = 4. 

So, Jim was 4 years old when Digimon came out. 

To find out how old Jim is now, we add the 20 years that have passed since Digimon came out to his age at that time: 4 + 20 = 24. 

So, Jim is 24 years old now.

Final Answer: Jim is 24 years old.
