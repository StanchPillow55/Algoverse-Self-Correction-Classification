Question ID: 1107
Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to find out the total number of students in the school. If 40% of the school population is 240 boys, then we can set up the equation:

0.40 * Total number of students = 240 boys

To find the total number of students, we can rearrange the equation to solve for the total number of students:

Total number of students = 240 boys / 0.40 = 600 students

Now, we know that the total number of students in the school is 600. 

Since we know that 240 of these students are boys, we can subtract this number from the total number of students to find out how many are girls:

Number of girls = Total number of students - Number of boys
Number of girls = 600 students - 240 boys = 360 girls

So, there are 360 girls in the school.
