==================================================

To solve this problem, we first need to understand that the 240 boys represent 40% of the total school population. 

Let's denote the total number of students in the school as 'T'. 

According to the problem, 40% of 'T' is equal to 240 boys. We can write this as an equation:

0.40 * T = 240

To solve for 'T', we divide both sides of the equation by 0.40:

T = 240 / 0.40
T = 600

So, the total number of students in the school is 600.

However, we are asked to find the number of girls in the school. Since we know that 240 of the 600 students are boys, we can subtract 240 from 600 to find the number of girls:

Number of girls = T - number of boys
Number of girls = 600 - 240
Number of girls = 360

Therefore, there are 360 girls in the school.
