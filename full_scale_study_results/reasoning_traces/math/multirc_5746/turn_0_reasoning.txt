==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to carefully analyze the information provided in the paragraph and determine who was surprised to learn that more than half of Sir Ralph Willoughy's men had been killed.

Reasoning:
1. The paragraph describes a battle between the Royalists and the Roundheads, where the Royalists, led by Harry, charged down the street and overwhelmed the Roundheads.
2. The paragraph states that "more than half of Sir Ralph Willoughy's men had been killed, many having been cut down before they could betake themselves to their arms."
3. This information suggests that Sir Ralph Willoughy's men were the ones who suffered heavy casualties in the battle.
4. The paragraph does not explicitly state who was surprised to learn about the casualties. However, it can be inferred that Sir Ralph Willoughy himself would have been surprised to learn that more than half of his men had been killed.

Final Answer:
Sir Ralph Willoughy was surprised to learn that more than half of his men had been killed in the battle.
