Question ID: 1285
Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

Mamou started with 1,360 meals. She gave out 64 meals on Friday, 30 meals on Saturday, and 48 meals on Sunday. 

To find out how many meals she has left, we need to subtract the total number of meals she gave out from the total number of meals she started with.

First, let's find out how many meals she gave out in total:

64 meals (Friday) + 30 meals (Saturday) + 48 meals (Sunday) = 142 meals

So, Mamou gave out a total of 142 meals over the three days.

Now, let's subtract this from the total number of meals she started with:

1,360 meals - 142 meals = 1,218 meals

So, Mamou has 1,218 meals left to distribute.
