Question ID: 1285
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to subtract the total number of meals Mamou has already distributed from the total number of meals she started with.

First, let's find out how many meals Mamou has already distributed. She gave out 64 meals on Friday, 30 meals on Saturday, and 48 meals on Sunday. 

So, the total number of meals she has distributed so far is 64 + 30 + 48.

64 + 30 = 94
94 + 48 = 142

So, Mamou has distributed 142 meals so far.

She started with 1,360 meals. To find out how many meals she has left to distribute, we subtract the number of meals she has already distributed from the total number of meals she started with.

So, 1,360 - 142 = 1,218

Therefore, Mamou has 1,218 meals left to distribute.
