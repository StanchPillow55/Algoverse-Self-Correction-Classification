Question ID: 1285
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To find out how many meals Mamou has left to distribute, we need to subtract the number of meals she has already distributed from the total number of meals she started with.

First, let's find out how many meals Mamou has already distributed. She gave out 64 meals on Friday, 30 meals on Saturday, and 48 meals on Sunday. 

So, the total number of meals she has distributed so far is 64 + 30 + 48 = 142 meals.

She started with 1,360 meals. To find out how many meals she has left, we subtract the number of meals she has already distributed from the total number of meals she started with.

So, 1,360 - 142 = 1,218 meals.

Therefore, Mamou has 1,218 meals left to distribute.
