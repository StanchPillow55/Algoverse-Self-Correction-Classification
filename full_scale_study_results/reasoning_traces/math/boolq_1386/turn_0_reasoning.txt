==================================================

To determine if ISO and film speed are the same thing, we need to understand the relationship between them.

Film speed and ISO (International Organization for Standardization) are closely related, but they are not exactly the same thing.

Film speed is a measure of a photographic film's sensitivity to light. It is a numerical value that indicates how much light is required to produce a usable image. The higher the film speed, the less light is needed to expose the film.

The ISO system is a standardized system for measuring and expressing film speed. It was developed by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) to provide a consistent way of measuring and comparing the light sensitivity of different films and digital camera sensors.

The ISO system uses a numerical scale to represent film speed, with higher numbers indicating greater light sensitivity. For example, a film with an ISO rating of 400 is more sensitive to light than a film with an ISO rating of 100.

In the context of digital cameras, the ISO setting is used to control the camera's sensitivity to light. Higher ISO settings make the camera more sensitive to light, allowing for faster shutter speeds or smaller apertures in low-light conditions. However, higher ISO settings can also introduce more
