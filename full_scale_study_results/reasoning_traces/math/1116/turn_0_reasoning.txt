==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to find out what a 20% increase of 50 students is. 

First, we need to convert the percentage increase to a decimal. We do this by dividing the percentage by 100. So, 20% becomes 0.20.

Next, we multiply the original number of students (50) by the decimal equivalent of the percentage increase (0.20). 

50 * 0.20 = 10

This tells us that there was an increase of 10 students from last year.

Finally, we add this increase to the original number of students to find the total number of students enrolled this year.

50 (original number of students) + 10 (increase) = 60 students

So, there are 60 students enrolled in the calligraphy class this year.
