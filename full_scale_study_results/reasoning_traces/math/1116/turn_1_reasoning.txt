Question ID: 1116
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To find the number of students enrolled this year, we need to calculate the 20% increase from last year's enrollment.

Step 1: Calculate the 20% of last year's enrollment.
20% of 50 students = 0.20 * 50 = 10 students

Step 2: Add the increase to last year's enrollment to find this year's enrollment.
50 students (last year) + 10 students (increase) = 60 students

So, this year there are 60 students enrolled in the calligraphy class.
