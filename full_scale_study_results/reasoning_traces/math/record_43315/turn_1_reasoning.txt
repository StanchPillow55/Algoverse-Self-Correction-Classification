Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given information and determine the potential impact of the controversial call made by the umpire in the eighth inning of the game between the Atlanta Braves and the St. Louis Cardinals.

Given information:
- The game was a one-game playoff between the Braves and the Cardinals, with the Cardinals leading 6-3.

Step 2: Calculate the potential number of runs the Braves could have scored if the bases were
