Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given information and determine the potential impact of the controversial call made by the umpire in the eighth inning of the game between the Atlanta Braves and the St. Louis Cardinals.

Given information:
- The game was a one-game playoff between the Braves and the Cardinals, with the Cardinals leading 6-3.
- In the eighth inning, with one out and runners on first and second base, Braves shortstop Andrelton Simmons hit a pop-up to shallow left field.
- There was apparent confusion between two Braves players, and the ball dropped, which could have led to the Braves loading the bases.

Step 1: Determine the potential impact of the controversial call.
If the ball had dropped due to the confusion between the Braves players, it would have loaded the bases for the Braves with one out. This could have potentially changed the outcome of the game, as the Braves would have had a better chance of scoring and potentially tying or even taking the lead.

Step 2: Calculate the potential impact on the score.
Assuming the Braves had loade
