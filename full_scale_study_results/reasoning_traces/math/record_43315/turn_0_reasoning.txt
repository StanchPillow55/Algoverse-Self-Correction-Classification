==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given information and determine the potential impact of the controversial call made by the umpire.

Given information:
- The game was a one-game playoff between the Atlanta Braves and the St. Louis Cardinals.
- The score was 6-3 in favor of the St. Louis Cardinals in the eighth inning.
- With one out and runners on first and second base, Braves shortstop Andrelton Simmons hit a pop-up to shallow left field.
- There was apparent confusion between two Braves players, and the ball dropped, which could have led to the Braves loading the bases.

Reasoning:
1. If the ball had dropped due to the confusion between the Braves players, it would have loaded the bases for the Braves.
2. With the bases loaded and one out, the Braves would have had a chance to score more runs and potentially tie or even take the lead in the game.
3. The controversial call by the umpire prevented this potential scoring opportunity for the Braves.
4. The Braves' manager protested the call, and the fans
