Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, let's convert everything to ounces so we can add them up easily. 

The first player ate a 6-ounce steak, so that's 6 ounces. 

The second player ate 8 beef tips, each an ounce in size. So, 8 beef tips * 1 ounce/beef tip = 8 ounces. 

The third player ate a one-pound steak. There are 16 ounces in a pound, so that's 16 ounces. 

The fourth and fifth players ordered vegetarian meals, so they didn't consume any meat. 

To find the total amount of meat consumed, we add up the amounts from the first, second, and third players: 

6 ounces (first player) + 8 ounces (second player) + 16 ounces (third player) = 30 ounces. 

So, the team consumed a total of 30 ounces of meat.
