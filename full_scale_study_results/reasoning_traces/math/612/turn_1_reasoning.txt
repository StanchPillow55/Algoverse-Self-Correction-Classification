==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to convert all the weights to the same unit. In this case, we'll use ounces since the first and second player's meals are already given in ounces. 

The first player ate a 6-ounce steak. 

The second player ate 8 beef tips, each an ounce in size. So, the total weight of the beef tips is 8 * 1 = 8 ounces.

The third player ate a one-pound steak. Since 1 pound is equivalent to 16 ounces, the steak was 16 ounces.

The fourth and fifth players did not consume any meat, so they contribute 0 ounces to the total.

Adding all these up, the total amount of meat consumed by the team is 6 ounces + 8 ounces + 16 ounces = 30 ounces. 

So, the basketball team consumed a total of 30 ounces of meat.
