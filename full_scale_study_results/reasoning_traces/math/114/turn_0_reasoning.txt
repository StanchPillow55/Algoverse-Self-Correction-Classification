Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, let's find out how many photographs Brittany's phone can hold. Since Jamal's phone can hold 6 times more photographs than Brittany's phone, and Jamal's phone can hold 1800 photographs, we can find the number of photographs Brittany's phone can hold by dividing 1800 by 6. 

1800 รท 6 = 300 photographs

So, Brittany's phone can hold 300 photographs. 

Next, we know that the maximum number of photographs that Brittany's phone can hold is 50 times more than the number of birds in Jamal's photograph of the ducks at the zoo. So, to find the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph, we can divide the number of photographs Brittany's phone can hold by 50.

300 รท 50 = 6 ducks

So, there are 6 ducks in Jamal's photograph of the ducks at the zoo. 

Therefore, the final answer is 6 ducks.
