To solve this problem, we need to establish relationships between the number of photographs Jamal's phone can hold, the number of photographs Brittany's phone can hold, and the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Determine the capacity of Brittany's phone:**
   - We know that Jamal's phone can hold 6 times more photographs than Brittany's phone.
   - Let \( B \) be the maximum number of photographs Brittany's phone can hold.
   - Jamal's phone can hold 1800 photographs.
   - Therefore, we can write the equation:
     \[
     6B = 1800
     \]
   - Solving for \( B \), we divide both sides by 6:
     \[
     B = \frac{1800}{6} = 300
     \]
   - So, Brittany's phone can hold 300 photographs.

2. **Relate the number of ducks to Brittany's phone capacity:**
   - The problem states that Brittany's phone can hold 50 times more photographs than the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph.
   - Let \( D \) be the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph.
   - According to the problem, we have:
     \[
     B = 50D
     \]
   - We already found that \( B = 300 \).
   - Substituting this into the equation gives:
     \[
     300 = 50D
     \]
   - Solving for \( D \), we divide both sides by 50:
     \[
     D = \frac{300}{50} = 6
     \]

Therefore, the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph of ducks at the zoo is \(\boxed{6}\).
