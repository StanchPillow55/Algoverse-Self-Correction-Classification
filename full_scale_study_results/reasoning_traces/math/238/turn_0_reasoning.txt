Dataset Type: math
==================================================

Let's start by figuring out the ages of each of the girls.

We know that Jessa is 20 years old.

According to the problem, Joan is five years older than Jessa. So, to find out how old Joan is, we add 5 years to Jessa's age:

Joan's age = Jessa's age + 5 years = 20 years + 5 years = 25 years

The problem also tells us that Mary is two years younger than Joan. So, to find out how old Mary is, we subtract 2 years from Joan's age:

Mary's age = Joan's age - 2 years = 25 years - 2 years = 23 years

Now that we know the ages of all three girls, we can find the sum of their ages by adding them together:

Sum of ages = Jessa's age + Joan's age + Mary's age = 20 years + 25 years + 23 years = 68 years

So, the sum of the ages of the three girls is 68 years.
