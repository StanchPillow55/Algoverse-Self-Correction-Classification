Question ID: 510
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to calculate the total number of days from December 31st to July 19th. 

January has 31 days, February has 28 days (assuming it's not a leap year), March has 31 days, April has 30 days, May has 31 days, June has 30 days, and July has 19 days. 

So, the total number of days is 31 (January) + 28 (February) + 31 (March) + 30 (April) + 31 (May) + 30 (June) + 19 (July) = 200 days.

Next, we need to calculate the total amount of calories Andy needs to burn to lose 30 lbs. 

Since it takes 3500 calories to burn a pound, Andy needs to burn 30 lbs. * 3500 calories/lb. = 105,000 calories.

To find out how much of a calorie deficit Andy needs each day, we divide the total amount of calories he needs to burn by the total number of days.

So, 105,000 calories / 200 days = 525 calories/day.

Therefore, Andy needs to have a calorie deficit (burn more calories than he consumes) of 525 calories each day to reach his goal of losing 30 lbs. by his birthday.
