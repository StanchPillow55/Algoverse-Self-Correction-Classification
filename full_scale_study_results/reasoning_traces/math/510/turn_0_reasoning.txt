First, we need to determine the total number of days Andy has to reach his goal. 

Andy's birthday is on July 19th and today is December 31st. 

In January, there are 31 days. 
In February, there are 28 days (assuming it's not a leap year). 
In March, there are 31 days. 
In April, there are 30 days. 
In May, there are 31 days. 
In June, there are 30 days. 
And in July, there are 19 days until his birthday. 

So, the total number of days is 31 (January) + 28 (February) + 31 (March) + 30 (April) + 31 (May) + 30 (June) + 19 (July) = 200 days.

Next, we need to calculate the total number of calories Andy needs to burn to lose 30 lbs. 

Since it takes 3500 calories to burn a pound, to lose 30 lbs., Andy needs to burn 30 lbs. * 3500 calories/lb. = 105,000 calories.

Finally, to find out how much of a calorie deficit Andy needs each day, we divide the total number of calories he needs to burn by the total number of days he has to reach his goal. 

So, the daily calorie deficit is 105,000 calories / 200 days = 525 calories/day.

Therefore, Andy needs to have a daily calorie deficit of 525 calories to reach his goal of losing 30 lbs. by his birthday.
