Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to calculate the total number of days from December 31st to July 19th. 

January has 31 days, February has 28 days (assuming it's not a leap year), March has 31 days, April has 30 days, May has 31 days, June has 30 days, and there are 19 days in July before Andy's birthday. 

So, the total number of days is 31 (January) + 28 (February) + 31 (March) + 30 (April) + 31 (May) + 30 (June) + 19 (July) = 200 days.

Next, we need to calculate the total number of calories Andy needs to burn to lose 30 lbs. Since he needs to burn 3500 calories to lose a pound, he needs to burn 30 lbs * 3500 calories/lb = 105,000 calories in total.

Finally, to find out how much of a calorie deficit Andy needs each day, we divide the total number of calories he needs to burn by the total number of days. 

So, 105,000 calories / 200 days = 525 calories/day.

Therefore, Andy needs to have a daily calorie deficit of 525 calories to reach his goal of losing 30 lbs. by his birthday.
