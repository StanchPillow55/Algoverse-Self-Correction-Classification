Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine the appropriate placeholder for the given information.

Given information:
- Tutti, a 4-month-old (17-week-old) papillion puppy, fell on a 10-inch sewing needle in her owner's home in Durham, North Carolina, on New Year's Eve.
- The needle pierced the puppy's chest and heart.
- Vets at the Triangle Veterinary Referral Hospital treated Tutti.
- The vets sedated the puppy and then extracted the needle by slowly pulling it out.
- After the procedure, the puppy woke up and immediately "wanted to be cuddled."

To complete the sentence, the appropriate placeholder is "the puppy" since the passage states that the vets sedated the puppy and then extracted the needle.

Therefore, the complete sentence is:
The team treating Tutti were able to extract the object by pulling it out while the puppy was sedated.
