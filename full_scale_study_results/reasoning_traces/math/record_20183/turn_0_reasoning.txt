==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine the appropriate placeholder in the given statement.

Given information:
- Tutti, a 4-month-old (17-week-old) papillion puppy, fell on a 10-inch sewing needle that impaled its chest and pierced its heart.
- The veterinary team at the Triangle Veterinary Referral Hospital sedated the puppy and extracted the needle by slowly pulling it out.

The statement to be completed is:
"The team treating Tutti were able to extract the object by pulling it out while @placeholder was sedated."

To determine the appropriate placeholder, we need to consider the subject of the sentence, which is the team treating Tutti.

The team was able to extract the object (the needle) while the puppy was sedated. Therefore, the appropriate placeholder is "the puppy".

The complete statement with the placeholder filled in is:
"The team treating Tutti were able to extract the object by pulling it out while the puppy was sedated."

Final answer: The puppy
