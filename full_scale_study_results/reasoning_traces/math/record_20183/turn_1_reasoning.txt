==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine the appropriate placeholder for the given information.

Given information:
- Tutti, a 4-month-old (17-week-old) puppy, fell on a 10-inch sewing needle that impaled her chest and pierced her heart.
- The veterinary team at the Triangle Veterinary Referral Hospital sedated Tutti and then extracted the needle by slowly pulling it out.

The appropriate placeholder for the given information is "the dog" or "Tutti".

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The passage states that the veterinary team sedated Tutti before extracting the needle.
2. The passage also states that the team extracted the needle by slowly pulling it out while Tutti was sedated.

Therefore, the complete sentence would be:
The team treating Tutti were able to extract the object by pulling it out while the dog was sedated.

Final answer:
The team treating Tutti were able to extract the object by pulling it out while the dog was sedated.
