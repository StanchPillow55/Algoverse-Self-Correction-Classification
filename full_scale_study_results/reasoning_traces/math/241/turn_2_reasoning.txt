Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine how many unique books Dolly and Pandora will collectively read if they read each other's books as well as their own.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Books:**
   - Dolly has two books. Let's call them Book A and Book B.
   - Pandora has one book. Let's call it Book C.

2. **Determine the Books Each Person Reads:**
   - Dolly will read her own books (Book A and Book B) and Pandora's book (Book C).
   - Pandora will read her own book (Book C) and Dolly's books (Book A and Book B).

3. **List All Books Read by Both:**
   - Dolly reads: Book A, Book B, Book C.
   - Pandora reads: Book C, Book A, Book B.

4. **Count the Unique Books:**
   - The total list of books read by both Dolly and Pandora is: Book A, Book B, Book C.
   - Since we are interested in the total number of unique books read collectively, we count each book only once.

5. **Calculate the Total Number of Unique Books:**
   - There are three unique books: Book A, Book B, and Book C.

Therefore, by the end of their reading, Dolly and Pandora will collectively have read a total of 3 unique books.

**Final Answer:**
Dolly and Pandora will collectively read 3 books.
