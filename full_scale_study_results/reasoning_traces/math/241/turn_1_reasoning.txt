Question ID: 241
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of books read by Dolly and Pandora if they read each other's books as well as their own.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Books:**
   - Dolly has two books. Let's call them Book D1 and Book D2.
   - Pandora has one book. Let's call it Book P1.

2. **Determine the Reading Plan:**
   - Dolly will read her own books (Book D1 and Book D2) and Pandora's book (Book P1).
   - Pandora will read her own book (Book P1) and Dolly's books (Book D1 and Book D2).

3. **Calculate the Total Number of Books Read:**
   - Dolly reads: Book D1, Book D2, and Book P1. This is a total of 3 books.
   - Pandora reads: Book P1, Book D1, and Book D2. This is also a total of 3 books.

4. **Collective Reading:**
   - Since both Dolly and Pandora read all the books available to them, we need to consider the total number of unique books they collectively read.
   - The unique books are: Book D1, Book D2, and Book P1.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The total number of unique books that Dolly and Pandora collectively read is 3.

Therefore, by the end of their reading, Dolly and Pandora will collectively have read 3 unique books.

Final Answer: 3 books.
