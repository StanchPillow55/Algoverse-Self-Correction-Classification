==================================================

Dolly has two books and Pandora has one book. 

If Dolly reads her own books, she will read 2 books. 

If Dolly also reads Pandora's book, she will read an additional 1 book. 

So, Dolly will read a total of 2 (her own) + 1 (Pandora's) = 3 books.

Similarly, if Pandora reads her own book, she will read 1 book. 

If Pandora also reads Dolly's books, she will read an additional 2 books. 

So, Pandora will read a total of 1 (her own) + 2 (Dolly's) = 3 books.

Therefore, collectively, Dolly and Pandora will read 3 (Dolly's total) + 3 (Pandora's total) = 6 books by the end. 

So, the final answer is 6 books.
