Question ID: 914
Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

Jon drives 100 miles a day for 30 days. 

To find out how many miles he drives in a month, we multiply the number of miles he drives in a day by the number of days in a month. 

100 miles/day * 30 days = 3000 miles

Jon's car needs a tune-up every 1000 miles. 

To find out how many tune-ups he needs in a month, we divide the total number of miles he drives in a month by the number of miles between each tune-up. 

3000 miles / 1000 miles/tune-up = 3 tune-ups

So, Jon needs 3 tune-ups in that time.
