Question ID: 356
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total cost of the toy cars.**
   - Each toy car costs $2.
   - Dean bought 6 toy cars.
   - Total cost for toy cars = Number of toy cars × Cost per toy car
   \[
   \text{Total cost for toy cars} = 6 \times 2 = 12 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Calculate the total cost of the teddy bears.**
   - Each teddy bear costs $1.
   - Dean bought 5 teddy bears.
   - Total cost for teddy bears = Number of teddy bears × Cost per teddy bear
   \[
   \text{Total cost for teddy bears} = 5 \times 1 = 5 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total cost of all toys.**
   - Total cost = Total cost for toy cars + Total cost for teddy bears
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = 12 + 5 = 17 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Calculate how much money Dean has left after his purchases.**
   - Dean started with $28.
   - After spending $17 on toys, the amount left is:
   \[
   \text{Money left} = \text{Initial amount} - \text{Total cost}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Money left} = 28 - 17 = 11 \text{ dollars}
   \]

5. **Add the extra money given by his mother.**
   - His mother gives him an extra $10.
   - Total money Dean has now:
   \[
   \text{Total money now} = \text{Money left} + \text{Extra money}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total money now} = 11 + 10 = 21 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Thus, the final amount of money Dean has left is **$21**. 

Final answer: **$21**.
