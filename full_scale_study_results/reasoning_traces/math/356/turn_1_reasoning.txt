==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine how much money Dean spends at the toy store and how much he has left after his mother gives him an additional $10.

**Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the toy cars.**

Dean buys 6 toy cars, and each toy car costs $2. Therefore, the total cost for the toy cars is:
\[ 
6 \text{ toy cars} \times \$2/\text{toy car} = \$12 
\]

**Step 2: Calculate the total cost of the teddy bears.**

Dean buys 5 teddy bears, and each teddy bear costs $1. Therefore, the total cost for the teddy bears is:
\[ 
5 \text{ teddy bears} \times \$1/\text{teddy bear} = \$5 
\]

**Step 3: Calculate the total amount spent by Dean.**

To find the total amount Dean spends, we add the cost of the toy cars and the teddy bears:
\[ 
\$12 + \$5 = \$17 
\]

**Step 4: Calculate the initial amount of money Dean has left after his purchases.**

Dean's mother initially gave him $28. After spending $17, the amount of money Dean has left is:
\[ 
\$28 - \$17 = \$11 
\]

**Step 5: Add the additional money given by Dean's mother.**

Dean's mother gives him an extra $10. Therefore, the total amount of money Dean has after receiving the additional money is:
\[ 
\$11 + \$10 = \$21 
\]

**Final Answer:**

Dean has $21 left after his purchases and receiving the extra money from his mother.
