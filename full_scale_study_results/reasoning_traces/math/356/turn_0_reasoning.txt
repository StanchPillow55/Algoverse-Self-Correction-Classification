==================================================

First, we need to calculate how much money Dean spent on the toy cars and teddy bears. 

The cost of the toy cars is 6 cars * $2/car = $<<6*2=12>>12.
The cost of the teddy bears is 5 bears * $1/bear = $<<5*1=5>>5.

So, the total cost of the toys is $12 (for the cars) + $5 (for the bears) = $<<12+5=17>>17.

Dean started with $28, so after buying the toys, he has $28 - $17 = $<<28-17=11>>11 left.

Then, Dean's mother gives him an extra $10, so he now has $11 + $10 = $<<11+10=21>>21.

Therefore, Dean has $21 left.
