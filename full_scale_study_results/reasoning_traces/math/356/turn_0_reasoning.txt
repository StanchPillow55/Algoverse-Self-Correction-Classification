==================================================

To solve the problem, we will follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total cost of the toy cars.**
2. **Calculate the total cost of the teddy bears.**
3. **Calculate the total amount spent.**
4. **Determine how much money Dean has left after his purchases.**
5. **Add the extra money given by his mother.**
6. **Calculate the final amount of money Dean has.**

### Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the toy cars
Dean bought 6 toy cars, and each toy car costs $2. 

\[
\text{Total cost of toy cars} = \text{Number of toy cars} \times \text{Cost per toy car}
\]
\[
\text{Total cost of toy cars} = 6 \times 2 = 12 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Step 2: Calculate the total cost of the teddy bears
Dean bought 5 teddy bears, and each teddy bear costs $1.

\[
\text{Total cost of teddy bears} = \text{Number of teddy bears} \times \text{Cost per teddy bear}
\]
\[
\text{Total cost of teddy bears} = 5 \times 1 = 5 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the total amount spent
Now, we will add the total cost of the toy cars and the total cost of the teddy bears to find out how much Dean spent in total.

\[
\text{Total amount spent} = \text{Total cost of toy cars} + \text{Total cost of teddy bears}
\]
\[
\text{Total amount spent} = 12 + 5 = 17 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Step 4: Determine how much money Dean has left after his purchases
Dean started with $28. We will subtract the total amount spent from the initial amount.

\[
\text{Money left after purchases} = \text{Initial amount} - \text{Total amount spent}
\]
\[
\text{Money left after purchases} = 28 - 17 = 11 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Step 5: Add the extra money given by his mother
Dean's mother then gives him an extra $10. We will add this amount to the money Dean has left.

\[
\text{Total money after extra} = \text{Money left after purchases} + \text{Extra money}
\]
\[
\text{Total money after extra} = 11 + 10 = 21 \text{ dollars}
\]

### Final Answer
After all calculations, Dean has a total of **$21** left.
