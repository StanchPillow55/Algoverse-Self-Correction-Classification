To solve this problem, we need to find the range of the estimated membership of the neo-fascist Right Sector movement in Ukraine.

Given information:
- The passage states that the membership of the Right Sector movement has been growing.
- The membership has been estimated to be between 5,000 and 10,000.

Step 1: Identify the range of the estimated membership.
The range is the difference between the highest and lowest values in the given set.
Range = Highest value - Lowest value
Range = 10,000 - 5,000 = 5,000

Therefore, the range of the estimated membership of the Right Sector movement is 5,000.

Final answer: The range of the estimated membership of the Right Sector movement is 5,000.
