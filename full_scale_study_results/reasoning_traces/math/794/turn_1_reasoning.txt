Question ID: 794
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

The problem involves simple arithmetic operations and understanding of fractions. 

First, we are told that there are 12 female lions. 

Next, we are told that there are half as many male lions as female lions. To find out how many male lions there are, we need to divide the number of female lions by 2. 

12 รท 2 = 6

So, there are 6 male lions. 

Finally, we are told that there are 14 lion cubs. 

To find out the total number of lions in the enclosure, we need to add the number of female lions, male lions, and lion cubs. 

12 (female lions) + 6 (male lions) + 14 (lion cubs) = 32

So, there are 32 lions in the enclosure. 

Therefore, the final answer is 32 lions.
