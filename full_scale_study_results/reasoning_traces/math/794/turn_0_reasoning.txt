Dataset Type: math
==================================================

The zookeeper counts 12 female lions. 

The problem states that there are half as many male lions as female lions. To find out how many male lions there are, we divide the number of female lions by 2. 

12 รท 2 = 6 male lions

The zookeeper also counts 14 lion cubs. 

To find the total number of lions, we add the number of female lions, male lions, and lion cubs. 

12 female lions + 6 male lions + 14 lion cubs = 32 lions

So, there are 32 lions in the enclosure.
