==================================================

First, we need to convert all measurements to the same unit. Since the shark's length is given in feet, let's convert the remoras' length to feet as well. 

There are 12 inches in a foot, so 6 inches is equal to 6/12 = 0.5 feet. 

Since there are 2 remoras, their combined length is 2 * 0.5 = 1 foot. 

Now, we can calculate the percentage of the shark's body length that the remoras represent. 

To do this, we divide the combined length of the remoras by the length of the shark and multiply by 100 to get the percentage. 

So, the percentage is (1/10) * 100 = 10%. 

Therefore, the combined length of the remoras is 10% of the shark's body length.
