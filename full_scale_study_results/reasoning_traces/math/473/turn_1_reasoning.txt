Question ID: 473
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to convert the shark's length to inches because the remoras' lengths are given in inches. There are 12 inches in a foot, so a 10-foot shark is 10 * 12 = 120 inches long.

Next, we add the lengths of the two remoras. Each remora is 6 inches long, so two remoras are 2 * 6 = 12 inches long.

To find out what percentage of the shark's body length the combined length of the remoras is, we divide the combined length of the remoras by the length of the shark and multiply by 100. 

So, the percentage is (12 / 120) * 100 = 10%.

Therefore, the combined length of the remoras is 10% of the shark's body length.
