Question ID: 473
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we first need to convert all measurements to the same unit. Since the shark's length is given in feet, we will convert the remoras' length from inches to feet.

There are 12 inches in a foot, so 6 inches is equal to 6/12 = 0.5 feet. Since there are 2 remoras of this length, the total length of the remoras is 2 * 0.5 = 1 foot.

Next, we need to find out what percentage of the shark's body length is the combined length of the remoras. The formula to calculate the percentage is (part/whole) * 100.

In this case, the part is the combined length of the remoras (1 foot) and the whole is the length of the shark (10 feet). So, the calculation would be (1/10) * 100 = 10%.

Therefore, the combined length of the remoras is 10% of the shark's body length.
