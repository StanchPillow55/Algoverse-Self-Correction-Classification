The problem states that the prices are proportional to the number of sandwiches. This means that the cost per sandwich is the same for each package.

First, let's calculate the cost per sandwich for the first two packages:

For the first package: $3 / 2 sandwiches = $1.50 per sandwich
For the second package: $6 / 4 sandwiches = $1.50 per sandwich

As we can see, the cost per sandwich is indeed the same for both packages.

Now, to find the cost of the third package, we simply multiply the cost per sandwich by the number of sandwiches in the package:

For the third package: $1.50 per sandwich * 8 sandwiches = $12

So, the package with 8 sandwiches will cost $12.
