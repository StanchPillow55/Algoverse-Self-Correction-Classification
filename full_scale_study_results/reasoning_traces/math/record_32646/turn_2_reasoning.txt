To solve this problem, we need to understand the context and the information provided in the passage.

The passage discusses the housing crisis in Arizona during Barack Obama's presidency. It mentions that when Obama took office in 2009, Arizona was one of the states hit hardest by the housing collapse, and the White House was pushing programs to save homeowners from foreclosure.
