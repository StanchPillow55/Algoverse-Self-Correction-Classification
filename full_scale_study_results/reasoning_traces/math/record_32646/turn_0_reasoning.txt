To solve this problem, we need to understand the context and the information provided in the passage.

The passage discusses the housing crisis and recovery in Arizona during Barack Obama's presidency. It mentions that Arizona's foreclosure crisis has "evaporated" and home prices have "soared and are nearing pre-crisis levels."
