==================================================

To solve this problem, I will need to make some assumptions and inferences based on the information provided in the passage.

The passage mentions that the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) is reducing mortgage insurance premiums. This suggests that the FHA had previously increased the premiums, likely to raise capital reserves that were depleted during the housing crisis.

The key information needed to answer the question is:
@highlight
The rate was initially increased to raise @placeholder capital reserves, which took a hit during the housing crisis and are still not back to their required minimums.

To fill in the @placeholder, we need to determine what "the rate" refers to. Based on the context, it most likely refers to the FHA mortgage insurance premiums.

Therefore, the complete answer would be:

The rate (of FHA mortgage insurance premiums) was initially increased to raise capital reserves, which took a hit during the housing crisis and are still not back to their required minimums.

This is consistent with the information provided in the passage about the FHA reducing mortgage insurance premiums, which implies that the premiums had been previously increased to rebuild the FHA's capital reserves that were depleted during the housing crisis.
