==================================================

First, let's determine the total amount of money Carrie received from her aunt.

She received ten twenties, which is 10 * $20 = $<<10*20=200>>200.

She also received 140 quarters, and since each quarter is worth $0.25, the total amount from the quarters is 140 * $0.25 = $<<140*0.25=35>>35.

The total amount of money she received from her aunt is therefore $200 + $35 = $<<200+35=235>>235.

Next, we need to determine how much money she spent on lunch. We know she spent all the quarters, which is $35.

We also know she spent 3/5 of the twenties. To find out how much this is, we multiply the total amount of money from the twenties by 3/5, which is $200 * 3/5 = $<<200*3/5=120>>120.

The total amount of money she spent on lunch is therefore $35 + $120 = $<<35+120=155>>155. 

So, Carrie paid $155 for the lunch.
