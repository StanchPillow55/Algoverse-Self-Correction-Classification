Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to find the team that won the 2014 World Cup final between Germany and Argentina.

Given information:
- Christoph Kramer, a German player, continued playing for 14 minutes after taking a blow to the face in the World Cup final.
- Kramer was eventually replaced in the 31st minute after slumping to the ground.
- Kramer has said he has no recollection of the first half of the World Cup final.

The passage states that Germany went on to win the final 1-0 to become champions for the fourth time.

Therefore, the final answer is:

Germany won the 2014 World Cup final against Argentina by a score of 1-0.
