==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of each type of item Raphael bought and then add those amounts together.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the pens. Each pen costs $1.5 and Raphael bought 4 pens. So, the total cost of the pens is 4 pens * $1.5/pen = $6.

Next, let's calculate the total cost of the notebooks. Each notebook costs $4 and Raphael bought 2 notebooks. So, the total cost of the notebooks is 2 notebooks * $4/notebook = $8.

Finally, the cost of the rim of bond paper is given as $20.

Now, we add up the cost of the pens, notebooks, and bond paper to find the total cost of all the items Raphael bought. The total cost is $6 (for the pens) + $8 (for the notebooks) + $20 (for the bond paper) = $34.

So, Raphael spent $34 on all the school supplies.
