Question ID: record_72176
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, I need to determine the missing word in the given sentence.

Given information:
- The sentence states that the touring version of Frozen "will follow the plot of the film but be performed in an arena setting."
- The missing word is indicated by the placeholder "@placeholder".

Based on the context, the missing word should be a noun that refers to the touring version of Frozen that will be performed in an arena setting.

Possible answers:
1. Production
2. Show
3. Performance
4. Spectacle

Let's evaluate each option:

1. Production:
   - "The production will follow the plot of the film but be performed in an arena setting."
   - This option makes sense and fits the context of the sentence.

2. Show:
   - "The show will follow the plot of the film but be performed in an arena setting."
   - This option also makes sense and fits the context.

3. Performance:
   - "The performance will follow the plot of the film but be performed in an arena setting."
   - This option is also a valid choice, as it refers to the touring version of Frozen being performed.

4.
