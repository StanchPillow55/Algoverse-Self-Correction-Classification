==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine the missing word in the given sentence.

Given information:
- The sentence states that the touring version of Frozen "will follow the plot of the film but be performed in an arena setting."
- The missing word is represented by the placeholder "@placeholder".

Based on the context, the missing word should be a noun that refers to the touring version of Frozen that will be performed in an arena setting.

Possible options for the missing word:
- Show
- Production
- Performance
- Spectacle

Let's evaluate each option:

1. Show:
   - "The show will follow the plot of the film but be performed in an arena setting."
   - This option fits the context and makes sense.

2. Production:
   - "The production will follow the plot of the film but be performed in an arena setting."
   - This option also fits the context and makes sense.

3. Performance:
   - "The performance will follow the plot of the film but be performed in an arena setting."
   - This option is redundant, as the sentence already mentions that the touring version will be "performed in an arena setting."

4.
