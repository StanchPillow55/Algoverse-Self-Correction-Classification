Question ID: record_72176
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, I will need to determine the missing word in the query.

Given information:
- The passage mentions that a touring version of the Disney movie "Frozen" is scheduled to launch in September.
- The passage also mentions that Frozen will mark the company's 34th Disney On Ice show.
- The query states that the production will "follow the plot of the film but be performed in an arena setting."

Based on the information provided, the missing word in the query is "Frozen" show.

The complete query with the missing word filled in would be:

"Quite the spectacle: The Frozen show will follow the plot of the film but be performed in an arena setting."

This makes sense given the context provided in the passage about a touring version of Frozen being adapted for an ice skating performance.

Therefore, the final answer is:

Frozen
