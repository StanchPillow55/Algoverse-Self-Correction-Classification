Question ID: record_2814
Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, I will need to analyze the given passage and extract the relevant information to answer the query.

Given information:
- Manchester United drew 0-0 with Burnley at Turf Moor.
- Louis van Gaal is still searching for his first win as Manchester United's manager.
- Juan Mata was frustrated by his team-mates resorting to long balls.
- Angel di Maria made his debut in the match.

The query states that @placeholder's faltering start has affected the team's self-belief, according to their manager.

Based on the information provided in the passage, the manager referred to is Louis van Gaal, and the team is Manchester United.

The passage does not explicitly state that Louis van Gaal said the team's self-belief has been affected by their poor start. The passage only mentions that Louis van Gaal is still searching for his first win as Manchester United's manager.

Therefore, the query is not fully supported by the information given in the passage. The passage does not provide any direct quote or statement from Louis van Gaal regarding the team's self-belief being affected by their faltering start.

Final answer
