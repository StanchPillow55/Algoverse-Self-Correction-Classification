Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of rodents in the pet shop. We know that there are 3 cages with 10 hamsters each and 3 cages with 5 guinea pigs each.

First, let's calculate the total number of hamsters. Since there are 3 cages with 10 hamsters each, we multiply 3 by 10:

3 cages * 10 hamsters/cage = 30 hamsters

Next, let's calculate the total number of guinea pigs. Since there are 3 cages with 5 guinea pigs each, we multiply 3 by 5:

3 cages * 5 guinea pigs/cage = 15 guinea pigs

Finally, to find the total number of rodents in the pet shop, we add the total number of hamsters and guinea pigs together:

30 hamsters + 15 guinea pigs = 45 rodents

So, the pet shop had 45 rodents in total.
