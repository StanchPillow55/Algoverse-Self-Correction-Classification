==================================================

The problem involves simple multiplication and addition.

First, we calculate the total number of hamsters. Since there are 3 cages with 10 hamsters each, we multiply 3 by 10 to get 30 hamsters.

Second, we calculate the total number of guinea pigs. Since there are 3 cages with 5 guinea pigs each, we multiply 3 by 5 to get 15 guinea pigs.

Finally, we add the total number of hamsters and guinea pigs to find the total number of rodents. So, 30 hamsters plus 15 guinea pigs equals 45 rodents.

Therefore, the pet shop had a total of 45 rodents.
