==================================================

Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we know that Boris produces 50,000 bars of chocolate each month.

In the first week, he produces 8,000 bars.

In the second week, he produces half as much as the first week. So, we calculate this by dividing the first week's production by 2:

8,000 bars / 2 = 4,000 bars

In the third week, Boris produces three times as much as the first week. We calculate this by multiplying the first week's production by 3:

8,000 bars * 3 = 24,000 bars

Now, to find out how much he produces in the fourth week, we need to subtract the total production of the first three weeks from the total monthly production.

So, we add up the production of the first three weeks:

8,000 bars (first week) + 4,000 bars (second week) + 24,000 bars (third week) = 36,000 bars

Then, we subtract this from the total monthly production:

50,000 bars (total monthly production) - 36,000 bars (total production of first three weeks) = 14,000 bars

So, Boris produces 14,000 bars of chocolate in the fourth week.
