Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, let's find out how much chocolate Boris produces in the second week. Since he produces half as much as the first week, we multiply the first week's production by 1/2:

8,000 bars * 1/2 = 4,000 bars

Next, let's find out how much chocolate Boris produces in the third week. Since he produces three times as much as the first week, we multiply the first week's production by 3:

8,000 bars * 3 = 24,000 bars

Now, let's add up the production from the first three weeks:

8,000 bars (first week) + 4,000 bars (second week) + 24,000 bars (third week) = 36,000 bars

Boris produces 50,000 bars each month. So, to find out how much he produces in the fourth week, we subtract the total production of the first three weeks from the monthly total:

50,000 bars (monthly total) - 36,000 bars (first three weeks) = 14,000 bars

So, Boris produces 14,000 bars of chocolate in the fourth week.
