Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Boris produces 50,000 bars of chocolate each month.

2. In the first week, he produces 8,000 bars.

3. In the second week, he produces half as much as the first week. So, he produces 8,000/2 = 4,000 bars.

4. In the third week, he produces three times as much as the first week. So, he produces 8,000*3 = 24,000 bars.

5. Now, we need to find out how much he produces in the fourth week. We know that the total monthly production is 50,000 bars. So, we subtract the production of the first three weeks from the total monthly production to find the production of the fourth week.

   So, the production in the fourth week is 50,000 - (8,000 + 4,000 + 24,000) = 50,000 - 36,000 = 14,000 bars.

Therefore, Boris produces 14,000 bars of chocolate in the fourth week.
