==================================================

Let's break this problem down step by step.

First, let's figure out how many stickers Lorraine trades. 

She trades 90% of her 30 small stickers for large buttons. 90% of 30 is 27, so she trades 27 small stickers for large buttons. 

She trades 50% of her 40 large stickers for large buttons. 50% of 40 is 20, so she trades 20 large stickers for large buttons. 

She trades the rest of her large stickers (which is 40 - 20 = 20) for small buttons. 

Now, let's figure out how many buttons she gets for these trades. 

Each small sticker is worth one small button, so she gets 27 small buttons for her 27 small stickers. 

Each large sticker is worth a large button or three small buttons. So, she gets 20 large buttons for her 20 large stickers. 

For the rest of her large stickers, she trades them for small buttons. Since each large sticker is worth three small buttons, she gets 20 * 3 = 60 small buttons for her 20 large stickers. 

So, in total, she gets 27 small buttons + 60 small buttons = 87 small buttons. 

She also gets 20 large buttons. 

But remember, a large button is worth three small stickers. So, 20 large buttons are worth 20 * 3 = 60 small buttons. 

So, in total, she has 87 small buttons + 60 small buttons = 147 small buttons. 

Therefore, Lorraine has 147 buttons by the end.
