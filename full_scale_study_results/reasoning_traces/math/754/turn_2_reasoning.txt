Question ID: 754
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, let's find out how many stickers Lorraine trades.

She trades 90% of her 30 small stickers for large buttons. 90% of 30 is 27. So, she trades 27 small stickers for large buttons.

She trades 50% of her 40 large stickers for large buttons. 50% of 40 is 20. So, she trades 20 large stickers for large buttons.

The rest of her large stickers, which is 40 - 20 = 20 large stickers, she trades for small buttons.

Now, let's find out how many buttons she gets for these stickers.

Each large sticker is worth a large button or three small buttons. So, for her 20 large stickers that she trades for large buttons, she gets 20 large buttons.

For her 27 small stickers that she trades for large buttons, since each large button is worth three small stickers, she gets 27 / 3 = 9 large buttons.

For the 20 large stickers that she trades for small buttons, since each large sticker is worth three small buttons, she gets 20 * 3 = 60 small buttons.

So, in total, Lorraine has 20 (from large stickers) + 9 (from small stickers) = 29 large buttons and 60 small buttons.

Therefore, Lorraine has 29 large buttons and 60 small buttons by the end.
