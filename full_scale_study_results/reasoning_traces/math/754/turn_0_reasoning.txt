==================================================

First, let's calculate how many stickers Lorraine trades for buttons.

She trades 90% of her 30 small stickers for large buttons. 90% of 30 is 0.9 * 30 = 27 small stickers.

She trades 50% of her 40 large stickers for large buttons. 50% of 40 is 0.5 * 40 = 20 large stickers.

The rest of her large stickers (50% of 40) she trades for small buttons. 50% of 40 is 0.5 * 40 = 20 large stickers.

Now, let's calculate how many buttons she gets for her stickers.

For her small stickers, she gets one large button for each three small stickers. So, she gets 27 / 3 = 9 large buttons.

For her large stickers, she gets one large button for each large sticker. So, she gets 20 + 20 = 40 large buttons.

However, the 20 large stickers she traded for small buttons are worth three small buttons each. So, she gets 20 * 3 = 60 small buttons.

In total, Lorraine has 9 + 40 = 49 large buttons and 60 small buttons.

So, Lorraine has 49 + 60 = 109 buttons by the end.
