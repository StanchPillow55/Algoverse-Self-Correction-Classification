==================================================

To solve this problem, we first need to calculate how much Jill earns per week for each job, and then multiply that by the number of weeks she works in a year.

First, let's calculate her weekly earnings for each job:

1. Teaching: Jill earns $20 per hour and works 35 hours a week. So, her weekly earnings from teaching are $20/hour * 35 hours/week = $700/week.

2. Cheerleading coaching: Jill earns $30 per hour and works 15 hours a week. So, her weekly earnings from coaching are $30/hour * 15 hours/week = $450/week.

Now, let's add these two amounts together to find out how much Jill earns in total per week:

$700/week (teaching) + $450/week (coaching) = $1150/week.

Finally, to find out Jill's annual salary, we need to multiply her weekly earnings by the number of weeks she works in a year:

$1150/week * 50 weeks/year = $57,500/year.

So, Jill's annual salary is $57,500.
