==================================================

First, we need to calculate how much Jill earns in a week for each job.

For her teaching job, she works 35 hours a week and gets paid $20 per hour. So, her weekly earnings from teaching are:

35 hours/week * $20/hour = $700/week

For her cheerleading coaching job, she works 15 hours a week and gets paid $30 per hour. So, her weekly earnings from coaching are:

15 hours/week * $30/hour = $450/week

To find out how much she earns in a week, we add her earnings from both jobs:

$700/week (teaching) + $450/week (coaching) = $1150/week

Since she works 50 weeks a year, we multiply her weekly earnings by 50 to find her annual salary:

$1150/week * 50 weeks/year = $57,500/year

So, Jill's annual salary is $57,500.
