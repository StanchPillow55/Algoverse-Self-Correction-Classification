To solve this problem, we need to calculate how much Jill earns from each job separately, and then add those amounts together to find her total annual salary.

First, let's calculate how much Jill earns as a teacher. She works 35 hours a week and gets paid $20 per hour. So, her weekly earnings from teaching are:

35 hours/week * $20/hour = $700/week

Since she works 50 weeks a year, her annual earnings from teaching are:

$700/week * 50 weeks/year = $35,000/year

Next, let's calculate how much Jill earns as a cheerleading coach. She works 15 hours a week and gets paid $30 per hour. So, her weekly earnings from coaching are:

15 hours/week * $30/hour = $450/week

Again, since she works 50 weeks a year, her annual earnings from coaching are:

$450/week * 50 weeks/year = $22,500/year

Finally, to find Jill's total annual salary, we add her earnings from teaching and coaching:

$35,000/year (teaching) + $22,500/year (coaching) = $57,500/year

So, Jill's annual salary is $57,500.
