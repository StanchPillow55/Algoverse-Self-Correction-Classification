==================================================

To determine the location of the Selenites in relation to the narrator, I will carefully analyze the details provided in the given paragraph.

Reasoning:
1. The paragraph mentions that the narrator and their companions were "cornered in a sort of way already" and that "those little brutes up the cave would probably get reinforced."
2. It also states that "the Selenites down the cleft had certainly some infernally long spears" and that there were "tremendous engines of warfare--guns, bombs, terrestrial torpedoes--this unknown world below our feet, this vaster world of which we had only pricked the outer cuticle, might not presently send up to our destruction."
3. Additionally, the paragraph mentions that "the legs of a number of fresh Selenites appeared running down the cavern towards us."

Based on this information, we can conclude that the Selenites are located below the cavern where the narrator and their companions are situated. The paragraph suggests that the Selenites are in a "cleft" or a lower area, and they are described as being "below our feet" and in the "unknown world below our feet."

Therefore, the final answer is
