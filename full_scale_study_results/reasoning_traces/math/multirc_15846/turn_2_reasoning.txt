==================================================

To determine the location of the Selenites in relation to the narrator, I will carefully analyze the details provided in the given paragraph.

Reasoning:
1. The paragraph mentions that the narrator and their companions were "cornered in a sort of way already" and that "those little brutes up the cave would probably get reinforced."
2. It also states that "Those Selenites down the cleft had certainly some infernally long spears" and that "Heaven alone knew what tremendous engines of warfare--guns, bombs, terrestrial torpedoes--this unknown world below our feet, this vaster world of which we had only pricked the outer cuticle, might not presently send up to our destruction."
3. The paragraph also mentions that "the legs of a number of fresh Selenites appeared running down the cavern towards us," indicating that the Selenites are approaching the narrator from below.

Based on the details provided in the paragraph, the Selenites are located below the cavern where the narrator and their companions are situated.

Final Answer:
The Selenites are located below the cavern in relation to the narrator.
