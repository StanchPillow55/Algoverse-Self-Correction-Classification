Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to determine how many snowshoes Mario needs to buy. Since each dog has four legs, and each pair of snowshoes covers two legs, each dog will need two pairs of snowshoes. 

So, for one dog, the number of pairs needed is 4 legs / 2 (since a pair covers two legs) = 2 pairs.

Since Mario has 6 dogs, he will need 6 dogs * 2 pairs/dog = 12 pairs of snowshoes.

Next, we need to calculate the total cost. Since each pair of snowshoes costs $12.00, the total cost will be 12 pairs * $12.00/pair = $144.00.

So, it will cost Mario $144.00 to buy snowshoes for all of his dogs.
