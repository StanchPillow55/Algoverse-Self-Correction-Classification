==================================================

To determine if the University of the Philippines (UP) is a state university, we need to consider the following information provided in the context:

1. UP was founded by the American colonial government in 1908.
2. It was established through Act No. 1870 of the 1st Philippine Legislature.
3. UP has institutional autonomy as the country's national university, as mandated by Republic Act No. 9500 (UP Charter of 2008).

Based on this information, we can conclude that the University of the Philippines is a state university for the following reasons:

1. UP was established by the government, specifically the American colonial government and the Philippine Legislature, indicating that it is a public institution.
2. The UP Charter of 2008 (Republic Act No. 9500) grants UP the status of a national university, which implies that it is a state-funded and state-recognized institution.
3. The fact that UP has institutional autonomy as the national university further reinforces its status as a state university.

Therefore, the final answer is:

Yes, the University of the Philippines is a state university.
