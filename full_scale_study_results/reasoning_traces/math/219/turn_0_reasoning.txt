Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, let's find out how many points Yuri and Brianna scored.

Yuri scored 10 more than half as many points as Naomi. Half of Naomi's score is 68/2 = 34 points. So, Yuri scored 34 + 10 = 44 points.

Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi. So, Brianna scored 68 + 17 = 85 points.

Now, let's find out how many points Jojo scored. We know that the total score of the four students is 251 points. So, Jojo's score is the total score minus the scores of Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna.

Jojo scored 251 - 68 - 44 - 85 = 54 points.

So, Jojo scored 54 points in the board game.
