Question ID: 790
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine how many seashells were brought back by the groups that participated in the scavenger hunt. Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Determine the Total Number of Groups:**
   - We know there are 90 people in total, and they are divided into groups of 9 people each.
   - To find the number of groups, we divide the total number of people by the number of people per group:
     \[
     \text{Number of groups} = \frac{90}{9} = 10
     \]
   - So, there are 10 groups in total.

2. **Calculate the Number of Groups that Brought Back Seashells:**
   - According to the problem, \( \frac{3}{5} \) of the groups brought back seashells.
   - To find out how many groups this is, we multiply the total number of groups by \( \frac{3}{5} \):
     \[
     \text{Number of groups that brought back seashells} = 10 \times \frac{3}{5} = 6
     \]
   - Therefore, 6 groups brought back seashells.

3. **Determine the Total Number of Seashells Brought Back:**
   - Each member of these 6 groups brought back 2 seashells.
   - Since each group has 9 members, the total number of seashells brought back by one group is:
     \[
     \text{Seashells per group} = 9 \times 2 = 18
     \]
   - Therefore, the total number of seashells brought back by all 6 groups is:
     \[
     \text{Total seashells} = 6 \times 18 = 108
     \]

Thus, the total number of seashells brought back by the groups is \(\boxed{108}\).
