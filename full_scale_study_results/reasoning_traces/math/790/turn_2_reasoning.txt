Question ID: 790
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine how many seashells were brought back by the groups that participated in the scavenger hunt. Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the Total Number of Groups:**
   - We know there are 90 people in total.
   - Each group consists of 9 people.
   - To find the total number of groups, we divide the total number of people by the number of people per group:
     \[
     \text{Total number of groups} = \frac{90}{9} = 10
     \]

2. **Determine the Number of Groups that Collected Seashells:**
   - According to the problem, \( \frac{3}{5} \) of the groups collected seashells.
   - To find the number of groups that collected seashells, we multiply the total number of groups by \( \frac{3}{5} \):
     \[
     \text{Number of groups collecting seashells} = 10 \times \frac{3}{5} = 6
     \]

3. **Calculate the Total Number of Seashells Collected:**
   - Each member of these 6 groups brought back 2 seashells.
   - Since each group has 9 members, the total number of seashells collected by one group is:
     \[
     \text{Seashells per group} = 9 \times 2 = 18
     \]
   - Therefore, the total number of seashells collected by all 6 groups is:
     \[
     \text{Total seashells} = 6 \times 18 = 108
     \]

Thus, the total number of seashells brought back by the groups is \(\boxed{108}\).
