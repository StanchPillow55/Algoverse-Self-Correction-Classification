Question ID: 790
Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to determine the number of groups. Since 90 people were split into 9-person groups, we divide 90 by 9 to find the number of groups. 

90 ÷ 9 = 10 groups

Next, we find out how many of these groups brought back seashells. We know that 3/5 of the groups each brought back 2 seashells. So, we multiply the total number of groups by 3/5 to find the number of groups that brought back seashells.

10 groups × 3/5 = 6 groups

Each of these 6 groups brought back 2 seashells per person. Since each group has 9 people, we multiply the number of groups by the number of seashells per person and then by the number of people in each group to find the total number of seashells.

6 groups × 2 seashells/person × 9 people/group = 108 seashells

So, they brought back a total of 108 seashells.
