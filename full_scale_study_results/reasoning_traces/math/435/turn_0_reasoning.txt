Dataset Type: math
==================================================

Ray had 25 lollipops and he kept 5 for himself. So, the number of lollipops he shared with his friends is 25 - 5 = 20 lollipops.

He shared these 20 lollipops equally among his 4 friends. To find out how many each friend received, we divide the total number of lollipops by the number of friends. 

So, 20 lollipops รท 4 friends = 5 lollipops per friend.

Therefore, each of Ray's friends received 5 lollipops.
