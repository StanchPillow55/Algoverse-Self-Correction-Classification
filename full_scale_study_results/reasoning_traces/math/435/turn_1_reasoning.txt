Question ID: 435
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to determine how many lollipops Ray shared with his friends. He started with 25 lollipops and kept 5 for himself. 

So, we subtract the number of lollipops he kept from the total number of lollipops he had:

25 lollipops - 5 lollipops = 20 lollipops

So, Ray shared 20 lollipops with his friends.

Next, we need to determine how many lollipops each friend received. Ray has four friends and he shared the lollipops equally among them. 

So, we divide the number of lollipops he shared by the number of friends:

20 lollipops รท 4 friends = 5 lollipops per friend

So, each of Ray's friends received 5 lollipops. 

Final Answer: Each of Ray's friends received 5 lollipops.
