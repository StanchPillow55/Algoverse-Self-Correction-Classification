Question ID: 347
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine the total cost Davos paid for the two shirts after applying the 40% discount.

1. **Calculate the original total cost of the shirts:**

   Davos bought 2 shirts, each costing $30. Therefore, the original total cost without any discount is:
   \[
   2 \times 30 = 60 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Determine the discount amount:**

   The discount is 40% of the original total cost. To find the discount amount, we calculate 40% of $60:
   \[
   \text{Discount} = 0.40 \times 60 = 24 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total cost after the discount:**

   To find out how much Davos paid, we subtract the discount amount from the original total cost:
   \[
   \text{Total cost after discount} = 60 - 24 = 36 \text{ dollars}
   \]

Therefore, Davos paid a total of $36 for the two shirts after applying the 40% discount.

**Final Answer: Davos paid $36 for the 2 shirts.**
