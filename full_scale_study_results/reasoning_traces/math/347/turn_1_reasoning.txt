==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to determine the total cost Davos paid for the two shirts after applying the 40% discount.

1. **Calculate the original total cost of the shirts:**
   - Davos bought 2 shirts, each costing $30.
   - The original total cost is calculated as follows:
     \[
     \text{Original Total Cost} = 2 \times 30 = 60 \text{ dollars}
     \]

2. **Calculate the discount amount:**
   - The discount is 40% of the original total cost.
   - To find the discount amount, we calculate 40% of $60:
     \[
     \text{Discount Amount} = 0.40 \times 60 = 24 \text{ dollars}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total cost after the discount:**
   - Subtract the discount amount from the original total cost to find the total cost after the discount:
     \[
     \text{Total Cost After Discount} = 60 - 24 = 36 \text{ dollars}
     \]

Therefore, Davos paid a total of $36 for the two shirts after the discount.

**Final Answer: $36**
