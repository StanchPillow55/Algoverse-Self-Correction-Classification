Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the shirts without the discount. 

The cost of each shirt is $30 and Davos bought 2 shirts. So, the total cost of the shirts is $30 * 2 = $60.

Step 2: Calculate the amount of the discount. 

The discount is 40% of the total cost. To calculate this, multiply the total cost by the discount rate (expressed as a decimal). So, the discount is $60 * 0.40 = $24.

Step 3: Subtract the discount from the total cost. 

To find the final price that Davos paid, subtract the discount from the total cost. So, the final price is $60 - $24 = $36.

So, Davos paid $36 for the 2 shirts.
