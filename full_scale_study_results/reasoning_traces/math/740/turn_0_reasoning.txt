Question ID: 740
Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, let's find out how many students like to either play video games or play music. We know that 10 students like to bake and 5 like to play basketball. So, we subtract these numbers from the total number of students:

50 students - 10 students (who like to bake) - 5 students (who like to play basketball) = 35 students

So, 35 students like to either play video games or play music.

We're told that the number of students who like to play music is twice the number of students who like to play basketball. Since we know that 5 students like to play basketball, this means that 2 * 5 = 10 students like to play music.

Now, to find out how many students like to play video games, we subtract the number of students who like to play music from the total number of students who like to either play video games or play music:

35 students - 10 students (who like to play music) = 25 students

So, 25 students like to play video games.

Final Answer: 25 students like to play video games.
