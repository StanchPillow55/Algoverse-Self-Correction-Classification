Question ID: 399
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to find out how old Beth is. Since Beth is 5 years older than Erica, and Erica is 30 years old, we add 5 to 30 to find Beth's age.

Beth's age = Erica's age + 5
Beth's age = 30 + 5
Beth's age = 35 years old

Next, we find Alice's age. Since Alice is 7 years older than Beth, and Beth is 35 years old, we add 7 to 35 to find Alice's age.

Alice's age = Beth's age + 7
Alice's age = 35 + 7
Alice's age = 42 years old

Finally, we find the difference between Alice's and Erica's ages. Since Alice is 42 years old and Erica is 30 years old, we subtract 30 from 42.

Difference in age = Alice's age - Erica's age
Difference in age = 42 - 30
Difference in age = 12 years

So, the difference between Alice's and Erica's ages is 12 years.
