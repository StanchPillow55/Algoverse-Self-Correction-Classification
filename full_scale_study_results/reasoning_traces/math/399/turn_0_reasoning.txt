Question ID: 399
Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

Let's start by finding out how old Beth is. Since Beth is 5 years older than Erica, and Erica is 30 years old, we can add 5 to Erica's age to find out Beth's age.

Beth's age = Erica's age + 5
Beth's age = 30 + 5
Beth's age = 35 years old

Next, let's find out how old Alice is. Since Alice is 7 years older than Beth, and we know that Beth is 35 years old, we can add 7 to Beth's age to find out Alice's age.

Alice's age = Beth's age + 7
Alice's age = 35 + 7
Alice's age = 42 years old

Finally, to find the difference between the ages of Alice and Erica, we subtract Erica's age from Alice's age.

Difference in age = Alice's age - Erica's age
Difference in age = 42 - 30
Difference in age = 12 years

So, the difference between the ages of Alice and Erica is 12 years.
