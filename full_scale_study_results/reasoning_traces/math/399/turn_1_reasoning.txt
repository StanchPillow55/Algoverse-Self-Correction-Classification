Question ID: 399
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to find out Beth's age. Since Beth is 5 years older than Erica, and Erica is 30 years old, we add 5 to 30 to get Beth's age.

Beth's age = Erica's age + 5
Beth's age = 30 + 5
Beth's age = 35 years old

Next, we find out Alice's age. Since Alice is 7 years older than Beth, and Beth is 35 years old, we add 7 to 35 to get Alice's age.

Alice's age = Beth's age + 7
Alice's age = 35 + 7
Alice's age = 42 years old

Finally, we find the difference between Alice's and Erica's ages. Since Alice is 42 years old and Erica is 30 years old, we subtract 30 from 42.

Difference = Alice's age - Erica's age
Difference = 42 - 30
Difference = 12 years

So, the difference between the ages of Alice and Erica is 12 years.
