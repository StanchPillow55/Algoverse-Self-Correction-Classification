Dataset Type: math
==================================================

Jayden initially has $70. His sister Ava gives him half of her $90 allowance. 

To calculate how much money Ava gives Jayden, we divide her allowance by 2:

$90 / 2 = $45

So, Ava gives Jayden $45. 

To find out how much money Jayden has in total, we add the money he initially had to the money Ava gave him:

$70 + $45 = $115

Jayden now has $115. 

The camera costs $200. To find out how much more money Jayden needs to buy the camera, we subtract the money he currently has from the cost of the camera:

$200 - $115 = $85

So, Jayden needs $85 more to buy the camera.
