==================================================

To determine whether Sophia is dead in the Walking Dead comics, we need to carefully examine the information provided in the context and apply logical reasoning.

Given information:
- Sophia is a member of the Atlanta refugee camp and becomes close friends with Carl.
- After her mother's suicide, she begins viewing Maggie and Glenn as her parents while remaining close to Carl.
- Due to the overrun world and their conflicting personalities, Sophia chooses to break up with Carl, but they remain close friends.

3. The fact that Sophia becomes a resident of the Alexandria Safe-Zone and the Hilltop Colony suggests that she is still alive and actively participating in the events of the comics.
4. The context emphasizes
