Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To determine whether Sophia is dead in the Walking Dead comics, we need to carefully examine the information provided in the context and apply logical reasoning.

Given information:
- Sophia is a member of the Atlanta refugee camp and becomes close friends with Carl.
- After her mother's suicide, she begins viewing Maggie and Glenn as her parents while remaining close to Carl.
- Due to the overrun world and their conflicting personalities, Sophia chooses to break up with Carl, but they remain close friends and Carl is extremely protective of her.
- Sophia becomes a resident of the Alexandria Safe-Zone and later the Hilltop Colony.
- Sophia is the comic's longest surviving female character.

Reasoning:
1. The context provided does not mention Sophia's death at any point. Instead, it emphasizes that she is the comic's longest surviving female character.
2. The information suggests that Sophia continues to be a part of the story, moving from the Atlanta refugee camp to the Alexandria Safe-Zone and the Hilltop Colony.
3. The fact that Sophia is described as the longest surviving female character in the comics implies that she is still alive and present in the narrative.
