To solve this problem, we need to determine which restaurant chain is being mocked in the "honest slogan" image that is circulating online.

Given information:
- The passage mentions that restaurants have not been spared the "honest slogan" treatment.
- The passage provides a placeholder for the name of the restaurant chain being mocked.

Step 1: Identify the restaurant chain being mocked.
The passage states that the restaurant chain being mocked is the "home of the famous salad buffet." Based on this information, the most likely restaurant chain being targeted is Sizzler.

Sizzler is a restaurant chain that is known for its salad buffet, and it would be a logical target for an "honest slogan" mocking its offerings.

Step 2: Provide the final answer.
The restaurant chain being mocked in the "honest slogan" image that is circulating online is Sizzler.
