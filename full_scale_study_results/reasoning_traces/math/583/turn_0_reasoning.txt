Question ID: 583
Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

Judy bought a dozen cups, which is 12 cups. She also bought twice as many dishes as cups, which means she bought 2*12 = <<2*12=24>>24 dishes.

The total number of utensils that Judy brought to the church's charity event is 24 dishes+12 cups = <<24+12=36>>36 utensils.

Her friend brought 40 cups and 20 more dishes than Judy, a total of 24 dishes+20 dishes = <<40+20=60>>60 dishes.

The total number of utensils that her friend brought to the event is 60 dishes+40 cups = <<60+40=100>>100 utensils.

Together, Judy and her friend brought 100 utensils+36 utensils = <<100+36=136>>136 utensils to the church's charity event. Answer: \boxed{136}.
