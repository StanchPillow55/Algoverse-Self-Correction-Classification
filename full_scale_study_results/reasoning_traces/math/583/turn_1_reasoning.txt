Question ID: 583
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we know that Judy bought a dozen cups. A dozen is equal to 12, so Judy bought 12 cups.

The problem also tells us that Judy bought twice as many dishes as cups. Since she bought 12 cups, this means she bought 2 * 12 = 24 dishes.

So, in total, Judy brought 12 cups + 24 dishes = 36 utensils to the charity event.

Next, we know that Judy's friend brought 40 cups to the event. The problem also tells us that Judy's friend brought 20 more dishes than Judy did. Since Judy brought 24 dishes, this means her friend brought 24 + 20 = 44 dishes.

So, in total, Judy's friend brought 40 cups + 44 dishes = 84 utensils to the charity event.

To find the total number of utensils brought by both Judy and her friend, we add the number of utensils each of them brought. So, 36 utensils (Judy) + 84 utensils (friend) = 120 utensils.

Therefore, the total number of utensils brought by the two to the church's charity event is 120.
