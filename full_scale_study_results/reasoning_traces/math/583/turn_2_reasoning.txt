Question ID: 583
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we know that Judy bought a dozen cups. A dozen is equal to 12, so Judy bought 12 cups.

The problem also tells us that Judy bought twice as many dishes as cups. To find out how many dishes Judy bought, we multiply the number of cups by 2. 

12 cups * 2 = 24 dishes

So, Judy bought 24 dishes.

Now, let's find out how many utensils Judy's friend brought. We know that her friend brought 40 cups and 20 more dishes than Judy. 

To find out how many dishes Judy's friend brought, we add 20 to the number of dishes Judy brought.

24 dishes + 20 = 44 dishes

So, Judy's friend brought 44 dishes.

Now, let's add up all the utensils brought by Judy and her friend.

Judy brought 12 cups and 24 dishes, so she brought a total of 12 + 24 = 36 utensils.

Judy's friend brought 40 cups and 44 dishes, so she brought a total of 40 + 44 = 84 utensils.

To find the total number of utensils brought by both, we add the number of utensils brought by Judy and her friend.

36 utensils + 84 utensils = 120 utensils

So, the total number of utensils brought by the two is 120.
