==================================================

Henry's first stop was after 20 miles and his second stop was 15 miles before the end of the 60-mile trip.

To find the distance between the two stops, we first need to find out how many miles Henry had left to travel after his first stop. 

We do this by subtracting the distance he had already traveled (20 miles) from the total distance of the trip (60 miles):

60 miles - 20 miles = 40 miles

So, after his first stop, Henry still had 40 miles left to travel.

His second stop was 15 miles before the end of the trip. This means that he traveled the remaining distance of 40 miles minus the 15 miles that were left after his second stop:

40 miles - 15 miles = 25 miles

So, Henry traveled 25 miles between his first and second stops. 

Final Answer: Henry traveled 25 miles between his first and second stops.
