Question ID: 1252
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

Given that there were 20 helmets, and the number of robots is half the number of helmets, we can calculate the number of robots by dividing the number of helmets by 2.

Number of robots = Number of helmets / 2
Number of robots = 20 / 2
Number of robots = 10

The problem also states that the number of helmets is half the number of footballs. Therefore, we can calculate the number of footballs by multiplying the number of helmets by 2.

Number of footballs = Number of helmets * 2
Number of footballs = 20 * 2
Number of footballs = 40

To find the total number of items Dominick saw, we add the number of robots, helmets, and footballs.

Total number of items = Number of robots + Number of helmets + Number of footballs
Total number of items = 10 + 20 + 40
Total number of items = 70

Therefore, Dominick saw a total of 70 items.
