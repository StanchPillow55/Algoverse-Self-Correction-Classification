Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to find out how many robots and footballs there are.

According to the problem, there are half as many robots as helmets. Since there are 20 helmets, there are 20/2 = <<20/2=10>>10 robots.

The problem also states that there are half as many helmets as footballs. So, there are 2 * 20 = <<2*20=40>>40 footballs.

To find the total number of items Dominick saw, we need to add the number of robots, helmets, and footballs together. 

So, 10 robots + 20 helmets + 40 footballs = <<10+20+40=70>>70 items.

Therefore, Dominick saw 70 items in total.
