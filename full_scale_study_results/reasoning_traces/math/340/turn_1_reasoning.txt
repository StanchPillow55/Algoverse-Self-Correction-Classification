Question ID: 340
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

Josh starts off with 3 balls and adds 1 ball each week for 4 weeks. 

This means that he adds 1 ball 4 times, which is 4 balls in total. 

So, the total number of balls he has after 4 weeks is the initial 3 balls plus the 4 balls he added, which equals 7 balls.

However, when he walks on stage, he slips and drops 3 balls. 

This means he now has 7 balls - 3 balls = 4 balls.

But, 2 of these balls are caught by people in the crowd, so he loses another 2 balls. 

This leaves him with 4 balls - 2 balls = 2 balls.

Finally, one ball gets lost completely in the dark auditorium, so he loses another ball. 

This leaves him with 2 balls - 1 ball = 1 ball.

So, Josh starts to juggle on stage with 1 ball.

Final Answer: Josh starts to juggle on stage with 1 ball.
