Question ID: 340
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

Josh starts off with 3 balls and adds 1 ball each week. After 4 weeks, he would have:

3 balls + 1 ball/week * 4 weeks = 3 balls + 4 balls = 7 balls

However, he slips and drops 3 balls. Two of these balls are caught by people in the crowd, but one gets lost. Therefore, he loses:

3 balls - 2 balls caught - 1 ball lost = 0 balls

So, he still has:

7 balls - 0 balls = 7 balls

Therefore, Josh starts to juggle on stage with 7 balls.
