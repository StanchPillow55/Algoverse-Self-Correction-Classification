Question ID: 340
Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

Josh starts off with 3 balls and adds 1 ball each week for 4 weeks. 

To calculate the total number of balls he has at the end of 4 weeks, we add the number of balls he starts with to the number of balls he adds each week times the number of weeks:

3 balls + 1 ball/week * 4 weeks = 3 balls + 4 balls = 7 balls

However, Josh slips and drops 3 balls. 

To calculate the number of balls he has left, we subtract the number of balls he drops from the total number of balls he has:

7 balls - 3 balls = 4 balls

But 2 of the balls that he dropped are caught by people in the crowd, so he gets those back. 

To calculate the final number of balls he has, we add the number of balls caught by the crowd to the number of balls he has left:

4 balls + 2 balls = 6 balls

So, Josh starts to juggle on stage with 6 balls.
