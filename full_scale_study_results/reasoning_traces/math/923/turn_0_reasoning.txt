Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to find out how many cups of chamomile and mint tea Lana made in total. We know she made 27 cups of tea in total and used 15 cups for cinnamon tea. So, we subtract the number of cinnamon tea cups from the total number of cups to find out how many cups of chamomile and mint tea she made.

27 cups - 15 cups = 12 cups

So, Lana made 12 cups of chamomile and mint tea in total.

We know that Lana divided these 12 cups into 3 rows, with equal amounts of chamomile and mint tea in each row. This means that each row contains 12 cups / 3 rows = 4 cups of chamomile and mint tea.

Since the number of chamomile and mint tea cups in each row is equal, we divide the total number of cups in each row by 2 to find the number of mint tea cups in each row.

4 cups / 2 = 2 cups

So, there are 2 cups of mint tea in each row.
