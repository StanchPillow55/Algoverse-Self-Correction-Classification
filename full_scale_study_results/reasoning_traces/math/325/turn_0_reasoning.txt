Question ID: 325
Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to find out how many junior programmers there are in the company. Given that the number of junior programmers is 2/5 of the total number of employees, we can calculate this by multiplying the total number of employees by 2/5:

100 employees * 2/5 = 40 junior programmers

Next, we need to find out how many senior programmers there are. Since the total number of employees is 100 and we know that there are 40 junior programmers, we can subtract the number of junior programmers from the total number of employees to find this:

100 employees - 40 junior programmers = 60 senior programmers

Now we can calculate how much each senior programmer is paid. We know that senior programmers are paid $400 more than junior programmers, who are each paid $2000 per month. So, we add $400 to $2000 to find the monthly salary of a senior programmer:

$2000 + $400 = $2400 per month

Finally, we can calculate the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month. We do this by multiplying the number of junior programmers by their monthly salary and adding that to the product of the number of senior programmers and their monthly salary:

(40 junior programmers * $2000 per month) + (60 senior programmers * $2400 per month) = $80,000 + $144,000 = $224,000 per month

So, the company pays a total of $224,000 to all the programmers per month.
