Question ID: 325
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, let's determine the number of junior programmers. According to the problem, the number of junior programmers is 2/5 of the total number of employees. So, we multiply the total number of employees (100) by 2/5:

100 * 2/5 = 40 junior programmers

Each junior programmer is paid $2000 per month, so the total amount paid to the junior programmers is:

40 * $2000 = $80,000 per month

Next, we need to find out how many senior programmers there are. Since the total number of employees is 100 and we know there are 40 junior programmers, we subtract 40 from 100 to get the number of senior programmers:

100 - 40 = 60 senior programmers

Each senior programmer is paid $400 more than each junior programmer, so each senior programmer is paid:

$2000 + $400 = $2400 per month

So, the total amount paid to the senior programmers is:

60 * $2400 = $144,000 per month

Finally, to find the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month, we add the total amount paid to the junior programmers and the total amount paid to the senior programmers:

$80,000 + $144,000 = $224,000 per month

So, the company pays a total of $224,000 to all the programmers per month.
