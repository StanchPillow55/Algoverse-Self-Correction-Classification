Question ID: 325
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, let's find out how many junior programmers there are in the company. According to the problem, the number of junior programmers is 2/5 of the total number of employees. So, we multiply the total number of employees (100) by 2/5:

100 * 2/5 = 40 junior programmers

Each junior programmer is paid $2000 per month, so the total amount of money the company pays to all the junior programmers per month is:

40 * $2000 = $80,000

Next, let's find out how many senior programmers there are in the company. Since the rest of the employees are senior programmers, we subtract the number of junior programmers from the total number of employees:

100 - 40 = 60 senior programmers

Each senior programmer is paid $400 more than each junior programmer, so each senior programmer is paid:

$2000 + $400 = $2400 per month

So, the total amount of money the company pays to all the senior programmers per month is:

60 * $2400 = $144,000

Finally, to find the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month, we add the amount paid to junior programmers and the amount paid to senior programmers:

$80,000 + $144,000 = $224,000

Therefore, the company pays a total of $224,000 to all the programmers per month.
