Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to calculate the total distance each person spat their seeds. 

For Zoey, she spat 40 seeds each at a distance of 10 feet. So, the total distance she spat her seeds is 40 seeds * 10 feet/seed = 400 feet.

For Sydney, she spat 35 seeds each at a distance of 12 feet. So, the total distance she spat her seeds is 35 seeds * 12 feet/seed = 420 feet.

Now, we need to find the average total distance spat. The average of a set of numbers is found by adding all numbers in the set and then dividing by the quantity of numbers in the set. 

So, the average total distance spat is (400 feet + 420 feet) / 2 = 820 feet / 2 = 410 feet.

So, the average total distance spat is 410 feet.
