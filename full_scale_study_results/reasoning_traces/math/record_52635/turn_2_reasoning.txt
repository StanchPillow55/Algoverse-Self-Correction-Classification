==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the percentage change in the amount of hair before and after the laser hair removal treatment for the 12-year-old child, Niraj.

Given information:
- Niraj, a 12-year-old child, suffers from Congenital Hypertrichosis Lanuginosa, also known as 'werewolf syndrome'.
- Niraj and his family traveled from their remote village in the mountains of Nepal to undergo laser treatment near the capital of Kathmandu.

Step 1: Calculate the percentage change in the amount of hair before and after the laser hair removal treatment.

Let's assume the amount of hair before the treatment is represented by 100%.

After the laser hair removal treatment, the amount of hair is reduced. Let's represent the amount of hair after the treatment as x%.

Percentage change = (Amount of hair after treatment - Amount of hair before treatment) / Amount of hair before treatment × 100
Percentage change = (x% - 100%) / 100% × 100
Percentage change = (x - 100) / 100 × 100
Percentage change = (x
