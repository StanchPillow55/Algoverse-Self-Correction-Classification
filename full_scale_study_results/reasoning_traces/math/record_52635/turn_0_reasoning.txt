To solve this problem, we need to calculate the percentage change in the amount of hair before and after the laser hair removal treatment for the 12-year-old child, Niraj.

Given information:
- Niraj, a 12-year-old child, suffers from Congenital Hypertrichosis Lanuginosa, also known as 'werewolf syndrome'.
- Niraj, along with his mother and siblings, traveled from their remote village in the mountains of Nepal to undergo laser treatment near the capital of Kathmandu.

Step 1: Calculate the percentage change in the amount of hair before and after the laser hair removal treatment.

Let's assume the amount of hair before the treatment is represented by 100%.

After the laser hair removal treatment, the amount of hair is reduced.

Percentage change = (Amount of hair after treatment - Amount of hair before treatment) / Amount of hair before treatment Ã— 100%

Since the treatment is aimed at reducing the excessive hair growth, the amount of hair after the treatment will be less than the amount of hair before the treatment.

Let's assume the amount of hair after the treatment is represented by x%.

Percentage
