Question ID: 191
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we first need to determine the total amount of insects the flock of ducks needs to eat in a week. We then need to divide this total by the number of days in a week to find out how many pounds of insects they need per day.

Step 1: Calculate the total amount of insects needed per week
We know that each duck needs to eat 3.5 pounds of insects per week. So, for a flock of ten ducks, we multiply the amount each duck needs by the number of ducks:

3.5 pounds/duck/week * 10 ducks = 35 pounds/week

So, the flock of ducks needs 35 pounds of insects per week.

Step 2: Calculate the amount of insects needed per day
There are 7 days in a week. To find out how many pounds of insects the flock needs per day, we divide the total weekly amount by 7:

35 pounds/week รท 7 days/week = 5 pounds/day

So, the flock of ten ducks needs 5 pounds of insects per day to survive.

Final Answer: The flock of ten ducks needs 5 pounds of insects per day.
