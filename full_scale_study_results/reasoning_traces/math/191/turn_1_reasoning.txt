Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many pounds of insects the entire flock of ducks needs in a week and then divide that by the number of days in a week to find out how many pounds they need per day.

Step 1: Find out how many pounds of insects the entire flock of ducks needs in a week.
We know that each duck needs 3.5 pounds of insects per week. So, for ten ducks, we multiply 3.5 pounds by 10.
3.5 pounds/duck/week * 10 ducks = 35 pounds/week

Step 2: Find out how many pounds of insects the flock needs per day.
We know that there are 7 days in a week. So, we divide the total pounds of insects needed in a week by 7 to find out how many pounds are needed per day.
35 pounds/week รท 7 days/week = 5 pounds/day

So, a flock of ten ducks needs 5 pounds of insects per day to survive.
