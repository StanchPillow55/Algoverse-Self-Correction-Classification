Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to find out how many pounds of insects the entire flock of ducks needs to eat in a week. We do this by multiplying the amount of food one duck needs by the number of ducks. 

So, 3.5 pounds/duck/week * 10 ducks = 35 pounds/week

Next, we need to find out how many pounds of insects the flock needs per day. Since there are 7 days in a week, we divide the total weekly amount by 7.

So, 35 pounds/week รท 7 days/week = 5 pounds/day

Therefore, a flock of ten ducks needs to eat 5 pounds of insects per day to survive.
