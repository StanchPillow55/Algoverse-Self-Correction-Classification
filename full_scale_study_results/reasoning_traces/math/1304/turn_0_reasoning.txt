Dataset Type: math
==================================================

The average enrollment at Butler High School is 3/4 of the average enrollment at Norman High School. 

To find the number of students Butler High School enrolls on average, we multiply the average enrollment at Norman High School by 3/4:

4000 students * 3/4 = 3000 students

So, Butler High School enrolls an average of 3000 students every year. 

To find out how much greater the average enrollment at Norman High School is than the enrollment at Butler High School, we subtract the average enrollment at Butler High School from the average enrollment at Norman High School:

4000 students - 3000 students = 1000 students

So, the average enrollment at Norman High School is 1000 students greater than the enrollment at Butler High School.
