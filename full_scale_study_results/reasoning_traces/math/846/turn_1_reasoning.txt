Question ID: 846
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, let's calculate the total time each group needs to perform, including getting on stage, performing, and exiting the stage. 

2 minutes (to get on stage) + 6 minutes (to perform) + 2 minutes (to exit the stage) = 10 minutes per group

Next, let's convert the total concert time from hours to minutes, because the time for each group is given in minutes. 

2 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 120 minutes

Now, let's subtract the 10-minute intermission from the total concert time.

120 minutes - 10 minutes (for intermission) = 110 minutes

Finally, let's divide the remaining time by the time each group needs to perform to find out how many groups can perform.

110 minutes / 10 minutes per group = 11 groups

Therefore, Vicki can schedule 11 groups to perform at the concert.
