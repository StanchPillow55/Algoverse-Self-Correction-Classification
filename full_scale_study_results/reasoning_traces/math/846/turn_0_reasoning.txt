Question ID: 846
Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, let's determine how much time each group will take on stage. Each group will take 2 minutes to get on stage, 6 minutes to perform, and 2 minutes to exit the stage. So, each group will take a total of 2 + 6 + 2 = 10 minutes on stage.

Next, we need to determine how much time is available for the concert. The concert will last 2 hours, and there will be a 10-minute intermission. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, the concert will last 2 * 60 = 120 minutes. Subtracting the 10-minute intermission, we find that there are 120 - 10 = 110 minutes available for performances.

Finally, we divide the total time available for performances by the time each group takes on stage to find out how many groups can perform. So, 110 minutes / 10 minutes/group = 11 groups.

Therefore, Vicki can have 11 groups perform in the concert.
