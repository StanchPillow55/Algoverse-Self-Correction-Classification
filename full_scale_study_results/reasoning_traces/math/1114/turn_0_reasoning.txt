==================================================

Raymond started with $21 and then saved an additional $11. We add these two amounts together to find out how much money he had before he made any purchases.

$21 + $11 = $32

Next, we need to subtract the money Raymond spent on the comic book and the puzzle from the total amount he had. He spent $5 on the comic book and $19 on the puzzle.

$32 - $5 - $19 = $8

So, after saving some money and making his purchases, Raymond has $8 left.
