To solve this problem, we need to understand the context and the information provided in the passage, and then use logical reasoning to determine the missing word in the query.

Given information:
- Russia supplies Europe with about 30% of its natural gas, or 8% of its energy overall.
- The passage states that "Russia will not cede control of the Crimea any time soon" and that "Near term, Russia holds the cards."
- The query mentions that "Russian oil producers simply burn off huge amounts of gas they can't sell in @placeholder."
