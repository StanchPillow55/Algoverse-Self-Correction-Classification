Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to understand the context and the information provided in the passage, and then use logical reasoning to determine the missing word in the query.

Given information:
- The passage discusses Russia's control over the Crimea region and its influence over Europe's energy supply.
- The passage states that Russia supplies Europe with about 30% of its natural gas, or 8% of its energy overall.
- The query mentions that Russian oil producers are burning off huge amounts of gas they can't sell in a certain location.

Based on the context, the missing word in the query is likely to be a location where Russian oil producers are burning off gas they can't sell.

Step 1: Identify the missing word in the query.
The query states: "Already, Russian oil producers simply burn off huge amounts of gas they can't sell in @placeholder."

Step 2: Determine the most likely location where Russian oil producers are burning off gas they can't sell.
Given that the passage discusses Russia's control over the Crimea region and its influence over Europe's energy supply, the most likely location where Russian oil producers are burning off gas they can't sell is Crimea.
