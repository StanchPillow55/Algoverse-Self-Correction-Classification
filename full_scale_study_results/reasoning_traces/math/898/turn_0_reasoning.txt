Question ID: 898
Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to find out how far Anis rowed. We know that Anis rowed 1/5 times more miles than Dijana. To find out how much this is, we multiply Dijana's distance by 1/5:

50 miles * 1/5 = 10 miles

So, Anis rowed 10 miles more than Dijana.

To find out the total distance Anis rowed, we add this to Dijana's distance:

50 miles + 10 miles = 60 miles

So, Anis rowed 60 miles.

To find out the total distance they both rowed, we add Dijana's distance to Anis's distance:

50 miles + 60 miles = 110 miles

So, the total distance they both rowed is 110 miles.
