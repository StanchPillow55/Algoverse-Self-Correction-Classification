Question ID: 788
Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to determine how much the school is covering. Since the school is covering half the cost of the trip, and the trip costs $300, we calculate:

$300 / 2 = $150

So, the school is covering $150 of the trip cost.

Next, we need to determine how much money John still needs after the school's contribution. We do this by subtracting the school's contribution from the total cost of the trip:

$300 - $150 = $150

So, after the school's contribution, John still needs $150.

Finally, we need to determine how much more money John needs after considering the $50 he already has. We do this by subtracting the money John has from the money he still needs:

$150 - $50 = $100

So, John is missing $100 for his school trip.
