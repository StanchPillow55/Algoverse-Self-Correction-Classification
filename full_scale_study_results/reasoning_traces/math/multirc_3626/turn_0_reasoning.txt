==================================================

To determine whether finding milk was difficult when the author stopped for tea, we need to analyze the relevant information provided in the paragraph.

The paragraph states:
"Boiling water was a difficulty--milk, cider, good bread and butter, cheese we could always find--sometimes a galette, but a kettle and boiling water were entirely out of their habits."

From this, we can see that the author explicitly states that milk was one of the things that they could "always find" when they stopped for tea at the farmhouses. This indicates that finding milk was not difficult.

Therefore, the answer to the question "When the author stopped for tea, was finding milk difficult?" is No.

The reasoning and work can be summarized as follows:
1. The paragraph states that milk was one of the things they could "always find" when stopping for tea.
2. This indicates that finding milk was not difficult.
3. Therefore, the answer is No, finding milk was not difficult when the author stopped for tea.
