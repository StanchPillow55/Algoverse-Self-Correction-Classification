Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

Imma feeds her cats twice a day, and each feeding is 60 grams. So, the total amount of food she uses per day is:

3 cats * 2 feedings/cat/day * 60 grams/feeding = 360 grams/day

Now, we want to know how many days 720 grams of cat food will last. We can find this by dividing the total amount of food by the amount used per day:

720 grams / 360 grams/day = 2 days

So, 720 grams of cat food will last Imma 2 days.
