Question ID: 1059
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, let's determine how much food Imma uses in a day. Since she feeds her cats twice a day and uses 60 grams of cat food each time, she uses 60 grams * 2 = 120 grams of cat food per day.

Next, let's determine how many days 720 grams of cat food will last. Since she uses 120 grams of cat food per day, 720 grams of cat food will last 720 grams / 120 grams/day = 6 days.

So, 720 grams of cat food will last Imma 6 days.
