Question ID: 1059
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to determine how much food Imma uses in a day. Since she feeds her cats twice a day and uses 60 grams each time, she uses 60 grams * 2 = 120 grams of cat food per day.

Next, we need to determine how many days 720 grams of cat food will last. We do this by dividing the total amount of food by the amount used per day. So, 720 grams / 120 grams/day = 6 days.

Therefore, 720 grams of cat food will last Imma 6 days.
