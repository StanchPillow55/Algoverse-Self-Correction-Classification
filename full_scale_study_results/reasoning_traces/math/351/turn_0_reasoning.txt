Question ID: 351
Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to figure out how many plant pots the school needs for the roses. Since they need twice as many for the roses as they do for the daisies, and they need 30 for the daisies, they need 2 * 30 = <<2*30=60>>60 plant pots for the roses.

Next, we add the number of pots needed for the daisies and the roses to find the total number of pots needed. This is 30 pots for the daisies + 60 pots for the roses = <<30+60=90>>90 pots in total.

April had already bought 100 pots, so to find out how many she has left over, we subtract the number of pots the school needs from the number she bought. This is 100 pots - 90 pots = <<100-90=10>>10 pots left over.

So, April has 10 plant pots left over.
