==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to determine how many plant pots April has left over after fulfilling the school's request.

1. **Identify the number of pots needed for the daisies**:
   The school asks for 30 plant pots for the daisies.

   \[
   \text{Pots for daisies} = 30
   \]

2. **Calculate the number of pots needed for the roses**:
   The school requests twice as many pots for the roses as they do for the daisies. Therefore, we calculate the number of pots for the roses as follows:

   \[
   \text{Pots for roses} = 2 \times \text{Pots for daisies} = 2 \times 30 = 60
   \]

3. **Calculate the total number of pots needed**:
   Now, we add the number of pots needed for the daisies and the roses to find the total number of pots required by the school.

   \[
   \text{Total pots needed} = \text{Pots for daisies} + \text{Pots for roses} = 30 + 60 = 90
   \]

4. **Determine how many pots April has**:
   April initially bought 100 plant pots from the garden center.

   \[
   \text{Total pots April has} = 100
   \]

5. **Calculate the number of pots left over**:
   To find out how many pots April has left after donating the required pots to the school, we subtract the total number of pots needed from the total number of pots she has.

   \[
   \text{Pots left over} = \text{Total pots April has} - \text{Total pots needed} = 100 - 90 = 10
   \]

6. **Final answer**:
   April has 10 plant pots left over after donating the required pots to the school.

\[
\text{Final answer: } 10
\]
