Question ID: record_34283
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to identify the name of the plant from which the stevia sweetener (steviol glycoside) is obtained.

Given information:
- Coca-Cola is launching a new green product in Australia called Coke Life.
- Coke Life is made from a naturally sweet plant and has 27 calories, which is 60% less than classic Coke.
- Coke Life uses the plant Stevia to sweeten it, instead of the man-made sweetener Aspartame used in Diet Coke.

Therefore, the name of the plant from which the stevia sweetener (steviol glycoside) is obtained is @placeholder.
