==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to find the name of the plant from which the stevia sweetener (steviol glycoside) is obtained.

Given information:
- Coca-Cola Life is a new green product launched in Australia.
- It is made from a naturally sweet plant.
- It uses the plant Stevia to sweeten it, instead of the man-made sweetener Aspartame used in Diet Coke.

The key information in the passage is that Coca-Cola Life uses the plant Stevia to sweeten it.

Therefore, the name of the plant from which the stevia sweetener (steviol glycoside) is obtained is @placeholder.
