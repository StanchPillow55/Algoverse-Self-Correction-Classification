Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to calculate the total cost per session. This includes the cost of renting the studio and the cost per student. 

The cost of renting the studio is $25 per session. The cost per student is $1.50 and there are 10 students. So, the total cost per student per session is 10 students * $1.50/student = $15. 

Therefore, the total cost per session is $25 (rent) + $15 (students) = $40. 

The studio is rented 3 days a week. So, the total weekly earnings are $40/session * 3 sessions/week = $120/week. 

There are approximately 4 weeks in a month. So, the total monthly earnings are $120/week * 4 weeks/month = $480/month. 

So, the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month are $480.
