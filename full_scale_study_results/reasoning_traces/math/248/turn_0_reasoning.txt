Question ID: 248
Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

The first step is to calculate the total weight of the onions the chef bought. Since each bag weighs 50 pounds and the chef bought 4 bags, we multiply 50 by 4 to get the total weight:

50 pounds/bag * 4 bags = 200 pounds

Next, we need to calculate the total cost of the onions. Since a pound of onions costs $1.50, we multiply the total weight of the onions by the cost per pound:

200 pounds * $1.50/pound = $300

So, the chef spent $300 on onions.
