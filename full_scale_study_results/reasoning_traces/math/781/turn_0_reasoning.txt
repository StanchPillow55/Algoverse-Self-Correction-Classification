==================================================

The total cost of the four pizzas is $64. We know that two of the pizzas cost $30 in total. 

To find the cost of the other two pizzas, we subtract the cost of the first two pizzas from the total cost. 

So, $64 - $30 = $34. 

Therefore, the other two pizzas cost $34 in total. 

Since these two pizzas cost the same amount, we divide the total cost of these two pizzas by 2 to find the cost of one pizza.

So, $34 รท 2 = $17.

Therefore, each of the other two pizzas cost $17.
