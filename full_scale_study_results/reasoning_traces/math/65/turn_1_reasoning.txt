Question ID: 65
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, let's find out how much time Jim spends watching TV and reading in one day. 

He spends 2 hours watching TV. Since he reads for half as long as he watches TV, he spends 2/2 = 1 hour reading. 

So, in total, he spends 2 hours (TV) + 1 hour (reading) = 3 hours per day on these activities.

Since he does this 3 times a week, he spends 3 hours/day * 3 days/week = 9 hours per week.

Over the course of 4 weeks, he therefore spends 9 hours/week * 4 weeks = 36 hours.

So, Jim spends 36 hours on TV and reading in 4 weeks.
