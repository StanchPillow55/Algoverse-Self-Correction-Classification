Question ID: 65
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, let's calculate how much time Jim spends watching TV and reading in one day. He watches TV for 2 hours and reads for half as long, which is 1 hour. So in total, he spends 2 + 1 = 3 hours on these activities in one day.

Next, we know that he does this 3 times a week. So in one week, he spends 3 * 3 = 9 hours on TV and reading.

Finally, we need to find out how much time he spends on these activities in 4 weeks. So we multiply the weekly time by 4: 9 * 4 = 36 hours.

Therefore, Jim spends 36 hours on TV and reading in 4 weeks.
