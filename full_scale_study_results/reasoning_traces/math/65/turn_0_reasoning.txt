Question ID: 65
Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, let's calculate how much time Jim spends watching TV and reading in one day. 

He spends 2 hours watching TV. 
He reads for half as long, which is 2 hours / 2 = 1 hour.

So in one day, he spends 2 hours + 1 hour = 3 hours on TV and reading.

He does this 3 times a week, so in one week, he spends 3 hours/day * 3 days/week = 9 hours/week.

In 4 weeks, he would spend 9 hours/week * 4 weeks = 36 hours.

So, Jim spends 36 hours on TV and reading in 4 weeks.
