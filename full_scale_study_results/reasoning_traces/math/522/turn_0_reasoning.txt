Question ID: 522
Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to determine how many quarts of strawberries each person can pick per hour.

We know that Tony can pick 6 quarts of strawberries per hour.

Bobby picks one less quart of strawberries per hour than Tony, so Bobby picks 6 - 1 = 5 quarts of strawberries per hour.

Kathy can pick twice as many strawberries per hour as Bobby, so Kathy picks 5 * 2 = 10 quarts of strawberries per hour.

Ricky picks two fewer quarts of strawberries per hour than does Kathy, so Ricky picks 10 - 2 = 8 quarts of strawberries per hour.

To find the total number of quarts of strawberries they can pick per hour, we add up the amounts each person can pick:

Tony: 6 quarts/hour
Bobby: 5 quarts/hour
Kathy: 10 quarts/hour
Ricky: 8 quarts/hour

Total: 6 + 5 + 10 + 8 = 29 quarts of strawberries per hour.

So, Tony, Bobby, Ricky, and Kathy can pick a total of 29 quarts of strawberries per hour on Grandma Concetta's farm.
