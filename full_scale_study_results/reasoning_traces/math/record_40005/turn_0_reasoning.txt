==================================================

To solve this problem, I will need to analyze the given passage and the query to determine the appropriate placeholder value.

Given information:
- The passage discusses the need for a unified Arab force in the Middle East, as expressed by Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi.
- El-Sisi mentions that Jordan and the United Arab Emirates have offered to send troops to assist Egypt in its efforts to battle ISIS in Libya.
- The query includes a quote from el-Sisi, where he states that "Your armed forces only protect the people of Egypt, and we coordinate with our @placeholder brothers."

To determine the appropriate placeholder value, I will need to analyze the context of the quote and the information provided in the passage.

The passage mentions that Jordan and the United Arab Emirates have offered military assistance to Egypt. Therefore, the placeholder in the quote is likely referring to these two countries, which are considered "brothers" in the context of the Middle East.

Therefore, the appropriate placeholder value is:
Jordanian and Emirati

Reasoning:
- The passage mentions that Jordan and the United Arab Emirates have offered military assistance to Egypt.
- In the quote, el-Sisi
