Question ID: record_40005
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, I will need to analyze the given passage and the query to determine the appropriate placeholder value.

Given information:
- The passage discusses the need for a unified Arab force in the Middle East, as expressed by Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi.
- El-Sisi mentions that Jordan and the United Arab Emirates have offered to send troops to assist Egypt in its efforts to battle ISIS in Libya.
- The query includes a quote from el-Sisi stating that "Your armed forces only protect the people of Egypt, and we coordinate with our @placeholder brothers."

To determine the appropriate placeholder value, I need to analyze the context of the quote and the relationships between the countries mentioned in the passage.

The passage indicates that el-Sisi is calling for a unified Arab force to address the challenges in the region. The quote suggests that el-Sisi is distinguishing the Egyptian armed forces as protecting only the Egyptian people, while coordinating with other Arab countries, referred to as "brothers."

Based on this, the most appropriate placeholder value would be "Arab" or "Arab countries," as el-Sisi is likely referring to the other Arab nations in the region
