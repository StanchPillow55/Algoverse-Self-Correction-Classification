Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of years since the 1995 nerve gas attack on the Tokyo subway.

Given information:
- The nerve gas attack on the Tokyo subway occurred in 1995.
- The article states that the attack happened "17 years" before Naoko Kikuchi's arrest.

Step 1: Calculate the number of years since the 1995 nerve gas attack.
Year of Kikuchi's arrest - Year of the nerve gas attack = Number of years since the attack
2012 - 1995 = 17 years

Therefore, the number of years since the 1995 nerve gas attack on the Tokyo subway is 17 years.
