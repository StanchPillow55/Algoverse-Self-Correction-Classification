To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of years since the 1995 nerve gas attack on the Tokyo subway.

Given information:
- The nerve gas attack on the Tokyo subway occurred in 1995.
- The article mentions that it has been 17 years since the deadly attack.

Step 1: Calculate the number of years since the 1995 nerve gas attack.
Current year - Year of the attack = Number of years
2012 - 1995 = 17 years

Therefore, the number of years since the 1995 nerve gas attack on the Tokyo subway is 17 years.

Final answer: In the 17 years since the deadly attack, which injured thousands and caused havoc throughout Japan, Kikuchi had lived under an assumed identity, telling neighbors she worked as an accountant for a nursing care company, reports said.
