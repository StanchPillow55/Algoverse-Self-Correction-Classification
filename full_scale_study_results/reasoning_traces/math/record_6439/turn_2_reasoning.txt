Question ID: record_6439
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of years since the deadly attack on the Tokyo subway in 1995.

Given information:
- The attack occurred in 1995.
- The current year is 2012.

Step 1: Calculate the number of years since the attack.
Current year - Year of the attack = Number of years since the attack
2012 - 1995 = 17 years

Therefore, in the 17 years since the deadly attack, which injured thousands and caused havoc throughout Japan, Naoko Kikuchi had lived under an assumed identity, telling neighbors she worked as an accountant for a nursing care company.

Final answer: 17 years
