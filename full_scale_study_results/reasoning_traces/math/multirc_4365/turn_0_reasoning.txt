To solve this problem, we need to carefully analyze the information provided in the paragraph and identify the game that Tommy and Suzy liked playing.

Given information:
- Tommy and Suzy (brother and sister) went to the playground with their parents, Jan and Dean.
- They were playing a game of tag and having a great time.
- They liked to play tag instead of building sandcastles or swinging.
- They also like to play hopscotch or jump rope, but that day they wanted to play tag.
- They invited their friends, Tony and Ally, to join the game of tag.

Based on the information provided, the game that Tommy and Suzy liked playing was tag.

The paragraph clearly states that "They liked to play tag instead of building sandcastles or swinging" and "They like to play hopscotch or jump rope but that day they wanted to play tag."

Therefore, the correct answer is that Tommy and Suzy liked playing tag, not hopscotch.

Final answer: The game that Tommy and Suzy liked playing was tag.
