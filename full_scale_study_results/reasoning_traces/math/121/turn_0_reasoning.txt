Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, let's find out how many fruits Morisette brought. She brought 5 apples and 8 oranges, so in total, she brought 5 + 8 = <<5+8=13>>13 fruits.

Next, let's find out how many fruits Kael brought. Kael brought twice the amount of apples than Morisette, which means he brought 2 * 5 = <<2*5=10>>10 apples. He also brought half the number of oranges than Morisette, which means he brought 8 / 2 = <<8/2=4>>4 oranges.

So, in total, Kael brought 10 + 4 = <<10+4=14>>14 fruits.

Now, to find out how many fruits they have in total, we just need to add the number of fruits Morisette brought to the number of fruits Kael brought. That gives us 13 + 14 = <<13+14=27>>27 fruits.

So, Morisette and Kael have 27 fruits in total.
