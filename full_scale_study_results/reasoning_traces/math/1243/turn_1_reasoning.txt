Step 1: Calculate the discounted price of the bag

The beef jerky bag is normally $18.00, but it's currently $3.00 off. So, we subtract $3.00 from $18.00 to find the new price.

$18.00 - $3.00 = $15.00

So, the discounted price of the bag is $15.00.

Step 2: Convert the price to cents

We know that $1.00 is equivalent to 100 cents. So, to convert $15.00 to cents, we multiply by 100.

$15.00 * 100 = 1500 cents

So, the discounted price of the bag is 1500 cents.

Step 3: Calculate the price per stick

The bag contains 30 sticks of beef jerky. To find the price per stick, we divide the total price of the bag by the number of sticks.

1500 cents / 30 sticks = 50 cents per stick

So, each stick of beef jerky will cost 50 cents when the bag is $3.00 off.
