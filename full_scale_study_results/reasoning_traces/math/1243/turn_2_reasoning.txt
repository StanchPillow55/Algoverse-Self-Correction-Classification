Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to determine the cost of the bag of beef jerky after the discount. Since the original price is $18.00 and there's a $3.00 discount, we subtract $3.00 from $18.00. 

$18.00 - $3.00 = $15.00

So, the cost of the bag of beef jerky after the discount is $15.00.

Next, we need to determine the cost of each stick of beef jerky. Since there are 30 sticks in a bag, we divide the cost of the bag by the number of sticks.

$15.00 รท 30 = $0.50

So, each stick of beef jerky costs $0.50.

However, the problem asks for the cost in cents, not dollars. To convert dollars to cents, we multiply by 100 (since there are 100 cents in a dollar).

$0.50 x 100 = 50 cents

So, each stick of beef jerky costs 50 cents. 

Final Answer: Each stick of beef jerky costs 50 cents.
