==================================================

First, we need to calculate the cost of the bag of jerky after the discount. The original price is $18.00 and the discount is $3.00. So, we subtract the discount from the original price:

$18.00 - $3.00 = $15.00

So, the bag of jerky now costs $15.00.

Next, we need to find out how much each stick of jerky costs. We know there are 30 sticks in a bag. So, we divide the total cost of the bag by the number of sticks:

$15.00 รท 30 = $0.50

So, each stick of jerky costs $0.50.

However, the problem asks for the cost in cents, not dollars. To convert dollars to cents, we multiply by 100 (since there are 100 cents in a dollar):

$0.50 x 100 = 50 cents

So, each stick of jerky costs 50 cents. 

Final Answer: Each stick of jerky costs 50 cents.
