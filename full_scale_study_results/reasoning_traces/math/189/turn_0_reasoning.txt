==================================================

Let's break down the problem into three parts: the cost of the tickets, the cost of the food, and the cost of the rides.

1. The cost of the tickets is given as $20.25.

2. The cost of the food is $4.50 less than the cost of the tickets. So, we subtract $4.50 from $20.25 to find the cost of the food. That gives us $20.25 - $4.50 = $15.75.

3. The cost of the rides is given as $33 for each ride, and they went on 2 rides. So, we multiply $33 by 2 to find the total cost of the rides. That gives us $33 * 2 = $66.

Now, we add up all these costs to find the total cost. That gives us $20.25 (tickets) + $15.75 (food) + $66 (rides) = $102.

Finally, since the three friends agreed to split all the costs evenly, we divide the total cost by 3 to find how much each of them paid. That gives us $102 / 3 = $34.

So, each of them paid $34.
