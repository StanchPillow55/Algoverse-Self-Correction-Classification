Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

James hires the horse-drawn carriage for 4 hours, from 5 PM to 9 PM. However, he gets 1 hour free. So, he only pays for 3 hours.

The cost for the first paid hour is $15.

Each hour after the first paid hour is twice the cost of the previous hour. So, the cost for the second paid hour is 2 * $15 = $30.

The cost for the third paid hour is 2 * $30 = $60.

So, the total cost that James paid for the horse-drawn carriage is $15 (for the first hour) + $30 (for the second hour) + $60 (for the third hour) = $105.

Therefore, James paid $105 for the horse-drawn carriage.
