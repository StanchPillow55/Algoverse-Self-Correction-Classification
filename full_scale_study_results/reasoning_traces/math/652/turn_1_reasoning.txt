Question ID: 652
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

James hires a horse-drawn carriage from 5 PM to 9 PM, which is a total of 4 hours. However, he gets 1 hour free, so he only pays for 3 hours.

The cost structure is as follows:
- The first paid hour is $15.
- Each subsequent hour is twice the cost of the previous hour.

Let's calculate the cost for each hour:

- The first hour costs $15.
- The second hour costs 2 * $15 = $30.
- The third hour costs 2 * $30 = $60.

So, the total cost for James is $15 (for the first hour) + $30 (for the second hour) + $60 (for the third hour) = $105.

Therefore, James paid $105 for the horse-drawn carriage.
