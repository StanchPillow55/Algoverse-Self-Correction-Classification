Question ID: 652
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

James hires the horse-drawn carriage for a total of 4 hours (from 5 PM to 9 PM). However, he gets 1 hour free, so he only pays for 3 hours.

The cost structure is as follows:

- The first paid hour costs $15.
- Each subsequent hour costs twice as much as the previous hour.

So, let's calculate the total cost:

- The first hour costs $15.
- The second hour costs twice as much as the first hour, so it costs 2 * $15 = $30.
- The third hour costs twice as much as the second hour, so it costs 2 * $30 = $60.

Adding these costs together, we find that James paid a total of $15 + $30 + $60 = $105 for the horse-drawn carriage.
