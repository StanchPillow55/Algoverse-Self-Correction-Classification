Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, let's calculate the total time Susan worked. She worked from 8 a.m. to 11 a.m., which is a total of 3 hours. However, she took a half-hour break, so we need to subtract that from the total time. 

3 hours - 0.5 hours = 2.5 hours

Next, we need to convert this time into minutes because Susan's earnings are calculated every 10 minutes. 

2.5 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 150 minutes

Now, we need to calculate how many 10-minute intervals are in 150 minutes. 

150 minutes / 10 minutes = 15 intervals

Finally, we can calculate Susan's total earnings by multiplying the number of 10-minute intervals by the amount she earns per interval. 

15 intervals * $5/interval = $75

So, Susan earns $75 for the online task.
