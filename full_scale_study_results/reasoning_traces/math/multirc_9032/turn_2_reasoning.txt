==================================================

To determine the composition of the skin based on the information provided in the paragraph, I will break down the key components mentioned:

1. Dermis:
   - The dermis is the inner layer of the skin.
   - The dermis contains blood vessels and nerve endings.
   - The nerve endings in the dermis are responsible for the skin's sensitivity, allowing us to sense pain, pressure, and temperature.

2. Epidermis:
   - The paragraph mentions that hair passes up through the epidermis, the outermost layer of the skin.

3. Hair Follicles:
   - Hair follicles are structures where hairs originate.
   - Each hair grows out of a follicle and extends above the skin surface.

4. Oil Glands:
   - The dermis contains two types of glands, one of which is the oil glands.
   - Oil glands produce an oily substance that is secreted into the hair follicles.

Based on the information provided in the paragraph, the key components that make
