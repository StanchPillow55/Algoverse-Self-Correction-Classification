==================================================

To determine the composition of the skin based on the information provided in the paragraph, I will break down the key components mentioned:

1. Dermis:
   - The dermis is the inner layer of the skin.
   - It contains blood vessels and nerve endings.
   - The nerve endings in the dermis are responsible for the skin's sensitivity, allowing us to sense pain, pressure, and temperature.
   - When the dermis is cut, it leads to bleeding, as the blood vessels are damaged.
   - The cut is painful due to the nerve endings in the dermis.

2. Hair Follicles:
   - The dermis contains hair follicles, which are structures where hairs originate.
   - Each hair grows out of a follicle and passes up through the epidermis (the outer layer of the skin) to extend above the skin surface.

3. Oil Glands:
   - The dermis also contains two types of glands, one of which is the oil glands.
   - The oil glands produce an oily substance that is secreted into the hair follicles.

Based on the information provided in the paragraph, the key
