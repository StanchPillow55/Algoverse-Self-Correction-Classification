==================================================

To solve this problem, I will break down the information provided in the paragraph and analyze the composition of the skin.

Given information:
- The dermis is the inner layer of the skin.
- The dermis has blood vessels and nerve endings.
- The nerve endings in the dermis explain why the skin is sensitive and can sense pain, pressure, and temperature.
- When you cut your finger, it starts to bleed, which means you have cut the dermis layer and damaged the blood vessels.
- The dermis also contains hair follicles and two types of glands.
- Hair follicles are structures where hairs originate, and each hair grows out of a follicle.
- Oil glands produce an oily substance that is secreted into the hair follicles.

Based on the information provided, the composition of the skin includes the following main components:

1. Dermis:
   - Blood vessels
   - Nerve endings
   - Hair follicles
   - Oil glands

2. Epidermis:
   - Hair passing through from the hair follicles in the dermis

Therefore, the main components of the skin's composition are:
