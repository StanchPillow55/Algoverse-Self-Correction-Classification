Question ID: 1232
Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

Eve originally had 20 pieces of pomelos. After giving some to her friend, she was left with 1/4 of the original amount. 

To find out how many pomelos she was left with, we multiply the original amount by 1/4:

20 * 1/4 = 5 pomelos

So, Eve was left with 5 pomelos after giving some to her friend.

To find out how many pomelos Eve gave away, we subtract the number of pomelos she was left with from the original amount:

20 - 5 = 15 pomelos

So, Eve gave away 15 pomelos.
