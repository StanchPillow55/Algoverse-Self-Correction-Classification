Question ID: 314
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of players on the defense, given the relationships between the offense, defense, and special teams.

Let's define:
- \( D \) as the number of players on the defense.
- \( O \) as the number of players on the offense.
- \( S \) as the number of players on the special teams.

According to the problem:
1. The number of players on the offense is twice the number of players on the defense:
   \[
   O = 2D
   \]

2. The number of players on the special teams is half the number of players on the defense:
   \[
   S = \frac{1}{2}D
   \]

3. The total number of players on the team is 105:
   \[
   O + D + S = 105
   \]

Substitute the expressions for \( O \) and \( S \) in terms of \( D \) into the total equation:
\[
2D + D + \frac{1}{2}D = 105
\]

Combine the terms on the left side:
\[
3.5D = 105
\]

To solve for \( D \), divide both sides by 3.5:
\[
D = \frac{105}{3.5}
\]

Calculate the division:
\[
D = 30
\]

Thus, the number of players on the defense is \(\boxed{30}\).
