==================================================

Let's denote the number of players on the defense as D, on the offense as O, and on the special teams as S. 

According to the problem, we have the following relationships:

O = 2D (there are twice as many players on the offense as there is on the defense)

S = D/2 (there is half the number of players on the special teams as there is on the defense)

The total number of players is 105, so we can write the equation:

O + D + S = 105

Substitute O and S from the first two equations into the third equation:

2D + D + D/2 = 105

Combine like terms:

3.5D = 105

Now, solve for D:

D = 105 / 3.5 = 30

So, there are 30 players on the defense.
