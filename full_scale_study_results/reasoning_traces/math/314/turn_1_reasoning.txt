Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, let's define some variables and set up equations based on the information given:

1. Let \( d \) represent the number of players on the defense.
2. According to the problem, there are twice as many players on the offense as there are on the defense. Therefore, the number of players on the offense is \( 2d \).
3. The problem also states that there is half the number of players on the special teams as there are on the defense. Therefore, the number of players on the special teams is \( \frac{d}{2} \).

The total number of players on the team is the sum of the players on the offense, defense, and special teams. We can express this as:

\[
d + 2d + \frac{d}{2} = 105
\]

Now, let's simplify and solve this equation:

1. Combine like terms:
   \[
   d + 2d + \frac{d}{2} = 3d + \frac{d}{2}
   \]

2. To eliminate the fraction, multiply every term by 2:
   \[
   2(3d) + 2\left(\frac{d}{2}\right) = 2 \times 105
   \]
   \[
   6d + d = 210
   \]

3. Simplify the equation:
   \[
   7d = 210
   \]

4. Solve for \( d \) by dividing both sides by 7:
   \[
   d = \frac{210}{7} = 30
   \]

Thus, the number of players on the defense is \( \boxed{30} \).

To verify, let's check the numbers:
- Number of players on the defense: \( d = 30 \)
- Number of players on the offense: \( 2d = 60 \)
- Number of players on the special teams: \( \frac{d}{2} = 15 \)

Adding these up gives:
\[
30 + 60 + 15 = 105
\]

The total matches the given number of team members, confirming that our solution is correct. The number of players on the defense is indeed \( \boxed{30} \).
