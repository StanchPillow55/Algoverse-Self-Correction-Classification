==================================================

Let's denote the age of Carver's son as x. According to the problem, Carver is 5 years less than twice the age of his son. We can express this as an equation:

45 = 2x - 5

To find the value of x (the son's age), we need to solve this equation. 

First, we can add 5 to both sides of the equation to isolate the term with x on one side:

45 + 5 = 2x - 5 + 5
50 = 2x

Then, we can divide both sides of the equation by 2 to solve for x:

50 / 2 = 2x / 2
25 = x

So, Carver's son is 25 years old.
