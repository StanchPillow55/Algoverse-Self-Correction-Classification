Question ID: 360
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

Let's denote the age of Carver's son as x. According to the problem, Carver is 5 years less than twice the age of his son. This can be translated into the following equation:

2x - 5 = 45

This equation states that twice the age of Carver's son, minus 5 years, equals Carver's current age of 45 years. 

To solve for x, we first need to isolate x. We can do this by first adding 5 to both sides of the equation to cancel out the -5 on the left side:

2x - 5 + 5 = 45 + 5
2x = 50

Then, we divide both sides of the equation by 2 to solve for x:

2x / 2 = 50 / 2
x = 25

So, Carver's son is 25 years old.
