Question ID: 839
Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to determine how much milk the farmer is currently producing with his 3 cows. Since each cow produces 5 liters of milk a day, we multiply the number of cows by the amount of milk each cow produces:

3 cows * 5 liters/cow = 15 liters

Next, we need to determine how much more milk the farmer needs to produce to reach his goal of 25 liters a day. We subtract the amount of milk he's currently producing from his goal:

25 liters - 15 liters = 10 liters

Finally, we need to determine how many more cows the farmer needs to produce the additional 10 liters of milk. Since each cow produces 5 liters of milk, we divide the additional amount of milk needed by the amount of milk each cow produces:

10 liters รท 5 liters/cow = 2 cows

So, the farmer needs 2 more cows to produce 25 liters of milk a day.
