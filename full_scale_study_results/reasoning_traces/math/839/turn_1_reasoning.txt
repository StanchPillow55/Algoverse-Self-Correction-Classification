Question ID: 839
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to calculate how much milk the farmer is currently producing with his 3 cows. Since each cow produces 5 liters of milk a day, we multiply the number of cows by the amount of milk each cow produces:

3 cows * 5 liters/cow/day = 15 liters/day

Next, we subtract the current production from the desired production to find out how much more milk the farmer needs to produce:

25 liters/day - 15 liters/day = 10 liters/day

Finally, we divide the additional amount of milk needed by the amount of milk one cow produces to find out how many more cows the farmer needs:

10 liters/day รท 5 liters/cow/day = 2 cows

So, the farmer needs 2 more cows to produce 25 liters of milk a day.
