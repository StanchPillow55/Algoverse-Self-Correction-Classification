Question ID: 99
Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

Mary already has 2 potted plants on each of the 40 window ledges of her home. So, she has 2 * 40 = <<2*40=80>>80 potted plants.

Yesterday, she received 18 new potted plants. So, the total number of potted plants she now has is 80 + 18 = <<80+18=98>>98 potted plants.

She has decided to give away 1 potted plant from each ledge. Since she has 40 ledges, she will give away 40 * 1 = <<40*1=40>>40 potted plants.

Therefore, after giving away 40 potted plants, Mary will remain with 98 - 40 = <<98-40=58>>58 potted plants. 

So, Mary will remain with 58 potted plants.
