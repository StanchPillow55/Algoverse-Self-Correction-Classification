Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine how many potted plants Mary will have after giving away some of them. Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Number of Potted Plants:**
   - Mary already has 2 potted plants on each of the 40 window ledges.
   - Therefore, the total number of potted plants she initially has is:
     \[
     2 \text{ plants/ledge} \times 40 \text{ ledges} = 80 \text{ plants}
     \]

2. **New Potted Plants Received:**
   - Mary received 18 new potted plants from the nursery.
   - Adding these to her initial count, the total number of plants she has now is:
     \[
     80 \text{ plants} + 18 \text{ plants} = 98 \text{ plants}
     \]

3. **Potted Plants Given Away:**
   - Mary decides to give away 1 potted plant from each of the 40 window ledges.
   - Therefore, the total number of plants she will give away is:
     \[
     1 \text{ plant/ledge} \times 40 \text{ ledges} = 40 \text{ plants}
     \]

4. **Final Number of Potted Plants:**
   - To find out how many potted plants Mary will have left, subtract the number of plants she gives away from the total number she has after receiving the new plants:
     \[
     98 \text{ plants} - 40 \text{ plants} = 58 \text{ plants}
     \]

Thus, after giving away the plants, Mary will remain with 58 potted plants.

**Final Answer: 58 potted plants**
