==================================================

First, let's calculate how many hours Kimo spends in class each week. 

On Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, he has three 1-hour classes. So, on each of these days, he spends 3 hours in class. Since there are three such days in a week, he spends 3 * 3 = 9 hours in class on these days in a week.

On Tuesdays and Thursdays, he has two 2-hour classes. So, on each of these days, he spends 2 * 2 = 4 hours in class. Since there are two such days in a week, he spends 4 * 2 = 8 hours in class on these days in a week.

Adding these together, Kimo spends 9 + 8 = 17 hours in class each week.

In one semester, there are 16 weeks of school. So, in one semester, Kimo spends 16 * 17 = 272 hours attending classes.

So, Kimo spends 272 hours attending classes in one semester.
