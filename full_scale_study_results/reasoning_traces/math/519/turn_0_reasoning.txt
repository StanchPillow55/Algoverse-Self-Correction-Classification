Question ID: 519
Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, let's convert Rob's time from hours to minutes because the problem is asking for the answer in minutes. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so Rob takes 2 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 120 minutes.

The problem states that Royce takes 40 minutes more than double the time Rob takes. So, we first need to calculate double the time Rob takes, which is 2 * 120 minutes = 240 minutes.

Then, we add the extra 40 minutes that Royce takes, which is 240 minutes + 40 minutes = 280 minutes.

So, Royce takes 280 minutes to shingle a house.
