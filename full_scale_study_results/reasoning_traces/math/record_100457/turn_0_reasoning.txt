Question ID: record_100457
Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, I will need to analyze the given information and determine the appropriate response based on the context.

Given information:
- Tiger Woods met with his former caddy, Steve Williams, and the two shook hands.
- Woods said that Williams' comment was "a wrong thing to say" and that they both acknowledged it.
- Williams issued an apology shortly after the Friday night remarks.
- The query asks who said the statement "I wanted to shove it up that black a--."

Based on the context provided in the passage, it seems that the statement in the query was made by Steve Williams during his acceptance speech on Friday night.

The passage states that Williams made "comments he made after his new boss, golfer Adam Scott, defeated Woods at the Bridgestone Invitational in Ohio in August." The query then asks who said the statement "I wanted to shove it up that black a--." Given that this statement is directly related to the comments made by Williams, the logical answer is that Steve Williams said this statement.

Therefore, the final answer is:

Steve Williams said "I wanted to shove it up that black a--."
