==================================================

To solve this problem, we first need to calculate how many miles each person traveled. 

We can do this by multiplying the speed at which they traveled by the amount of time they spent traveling. This is because distance is equal to speed multiplied by time (d = st).

For Matteo, he traveled at 55 miles per hour for 4 hours. So, his total distance traveled is:

55 miles/hour * 4 hours = 220 miles

For Shandy, she traveled at 45 miles per hour for 10 hours. So, her total distance traveled is:

45 miles/hour * 10 hours = 450 miles

To find out how many more miles Shandy drove than Matteo, we subtract Matteo's total distance from Shandy's total distance:

450 miles - 220 miles = 230 miles

So, Shandy drove 230 miles farther than Matteo.
