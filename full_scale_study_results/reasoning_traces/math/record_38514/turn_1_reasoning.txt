==================================================

To analyze the safety of the American version of the Running of the Bulls event compared to the traditional event in Pamplona, Spain, we need to consider the key differences in the event structure and safety measures.

Given information:
- The Great Bull Run event is modeled after the annual Running of the Bulls in Pamplona, Spain.
- The event in Pamplona is known to be extremely dangerous, with people regularly getting gored and even killed.
- The American organizers are putting certain systems in place to make their events much safer than the running in Pamplona.

Reasoning:
1. Fenced-in courses:
   - In the American version, the bulls will be running through fenced-in courses, which is a significant safety measure compared to the open streets in Pamplona.
   - The fenced-in courses provide a more controlled environment and reduce the risk of participants being trampled or gored by the bulls.

2. Drag-racing strip and horse park locations:
   - The American events are planned to take place at a drag-racing strip and an Atlanta-area horse park, which are more controlled and safer environments than the narrow streets of
