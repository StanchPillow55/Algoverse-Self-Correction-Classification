==================================================

To analyze the safety measures taken by the American organizers of the Great Bull Run events, we need to consider the key differences between the traditional Running of the Bulls in Pamplona, Spain and the new events planned in the United States.

Given information:
- The Great Bull Run is inspired by the annual Running of the Bulls in Pamplona, Spain.
- The Running of the Bulls in Pamplona is known to be extremely dangerous, with people regularly getting gored and even killed.
- The event organizers in the U.S. are changing parts of the run to make it safer for American participants.

Reasoning:
1. Fenced-in courses:
   - In Pamplona, the Running of the Bulls takes place on the streets of the city, which are not fenced off.
   - The American organizers are planning to have the bulls run through fenced-in courses, which can help prevent participants from being trampled or gored by the bulls.
   - Fenced-in courses provide a more controlled environment and reduce the risk of direct contact between the bulls and the participants.

2. Drag-racing strip and horse park locations:
