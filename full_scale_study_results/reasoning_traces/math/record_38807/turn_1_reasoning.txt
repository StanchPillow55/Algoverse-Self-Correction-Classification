Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, I need to analyze the information provided in the passage and determine the appropriate placeholder to fill in the given statement.

The passage discusses the decline in the number of CIA drone strikes in Pakistan over the past year. It states that in the first three months of 2012, there were 11 drone strikes, compared to 21 in the first three months of 2011 and a record 28 in the first quarter of 2010.

The passage also mentions that Pakistan's parliament is debating whether the United States should be made to stop the CIA drone strikes altogether in the Pakistani border regions with Afghanistan, and whether the U.S. should apologize for NATO airstrikes that killed some two dozen Pakistani soldiers.

Given this information, the appropriate placeholder to fill in the statement would be "U.S." as the passage indicates that the drone campaign in Pakistan had been slowing for many months before the incident mentioned.

Therefore, the complete statement would be:

"For many months before this incident, the U.S. aggressive drone campaign in Pakistan had been slowing."
