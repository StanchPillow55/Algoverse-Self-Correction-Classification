==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to analyze the information provided in the passage and determine the appropriate placeholder for the given query.

Given information:
- The passage discusses the decline in the number of CIA drone strikes in Pakistan over the past year.
- In the first three months of 2012, there were 11 drone strikes, compared to 21 in the first three months of 2011 and a record 28 in the first quarter of 2010.
- The passage mentions that the U.S. drone war in Pakistan has been much diminished.

Based on the information provided, the appropriate placeholder for the given query would be "U.S." or "America's".

Reasoning:
The passage clearly states that the drone war in Pakistan has been much diminished, and it provides specific data on the decline in the number of drone strikes over the past few years. This suggests that the "aggressive drone campaign" being referred to in the query is the U.S. or America's drone campaign in Pakistan.

Therefore, the final answer for the placeholder in the given query is:

"U.S."

or

"America's"
