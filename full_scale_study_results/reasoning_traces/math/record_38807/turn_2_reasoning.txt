Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, I need to analyze the information provided in the passage and determine the appropriate placeholder word to fill in the given sentence.

The passage discusses the decline in the number of CIA drone strikes in Pakistan over the past year. It states that in the first three months of 2012, there were 11 drone strikes, compared to 21 in the first three months of 2011 and a record 28 in the first quarter of 2010.

The passage also mentions that Pakistan's parliament is debating whether the United States should be made to stop the CIA drone strikes altogether in the Pakistani border regions with Afghanistan.

Given this context, the appropriate placeholder word to fill in the sentence would be "U.S." or "American", as the passage is discussing the decline in the U.S. or American drone campaign in Pakistan.

Therefore, the complete sentence would be:

"For many months before this incident, the U.S. aggressive drone campaign in Pakistan had been slowing."
