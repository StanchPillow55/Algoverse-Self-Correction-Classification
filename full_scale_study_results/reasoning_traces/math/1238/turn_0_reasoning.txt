==================================================

First, let's calculate the total cost of making macaroni and cheese once.

The pasta costs $1.00, the cheddar cheese costs $3.00, and the gruyere cheese costs twice the amount of the cheddar cheese, which is 2 * $3.00 = $6.00.

So, the total cost of making macaroni and cheese once is $1.00 (pasta) + $3.00 (cheddar cheese) + $6.00 (gruyere cheese) = $10.00.

Bud makes macaroni and cheese once a week. So, in one year (52 weeks), the total cost would be 52 * $10.00 = $520.00.

Therefore, Bud spends $520.00 on making macaroni and cheese in one year.
