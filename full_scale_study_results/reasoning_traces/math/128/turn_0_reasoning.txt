==================================================

First, we need to find out the cost of each watermelon and each orange. 

Given that a watermelon costs three times what each pepper costs, and each pepper costs $15, we can calculate the cost of a watermelon as follows:

Cost of a watermelon = 3 * cost of a pepper
Cost of a watermelon = 3 * $15
Cost of a watermelon = $45

An orange costs $5 less than what a watermelon costs, so we can calculate the cost of an orange as follows:

Cost of an orange = cost of a watermelon - $5
Cost of an orange = $45 - $5
Cost of an orange = $40

Now that we know the cost of each item, we can calculate the total amount of money Dillon will spend. 

He is buying 4 watermelons, 20 peppers, and 10 oranges. 

Total cost = (number of watermelons * cost of a watermelon) + (number of peppers * cost of a pepper) + (number of oranges * cost of an orange)

Total cost = (4 * $45) + (20 * $15) + (10 * $40)

Total cost = $180 + $300 + $400

Total cost = $880

So, Dillon will spend a total of $880.
