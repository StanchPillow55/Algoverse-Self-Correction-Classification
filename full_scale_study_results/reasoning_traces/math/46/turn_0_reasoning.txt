Question ID: 46
Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

Candice started with 80 post-it notes and ended with 23 post-it notes. This means that she used 80 - 23 = 57 post-it notes from her original stash.

However, we know that she used a total of 220 post-it notes at work. This means that she must have used 220 - 57 = 163 post-it notes from the package she purchased.

Therefore, the package of post-it notes that Candice purchased contained 163 post-it notes.
