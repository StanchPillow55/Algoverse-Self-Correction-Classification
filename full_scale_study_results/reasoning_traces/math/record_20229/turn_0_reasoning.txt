==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine the missing placeholder in the query based on the given information in the passage.

Given information:
- The passage mentions that Angelina Jolie visited orphaned children in a Lebanese refugee camp.
- The passage also mentions that Jolie and William Hague addressed a conference on sexual violence in conflict, organized in Sarajevo by Bosnia's Defence Ministry.

The query asks about Angelina Jolie meeting Syrian refugees, but the passage does not mention Jolie visiting Syrian refugees. Instead, it mentions her visiting a Lebanese refugee camp.

Therefore, the missing placeholder in the query should be "Lebanon" to match the information provided in the passage.

Final answer:
Boys' Own: Angelina Jolie (in headscarf) meets Syrian refugees in Lebanon
