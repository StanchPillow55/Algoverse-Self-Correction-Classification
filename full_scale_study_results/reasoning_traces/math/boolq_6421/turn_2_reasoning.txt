==================================================

To determine whether players can jump on free throws in the NBA, we need to examine the rules and regulations governing free throws in the league.

According to the context provided:

"Players are, however, permitted to jump while attempting the free throw, provided they do not leave the designated area at any point."

This clearly indicates that players are allowed to jump while attempting a free throw in the NBA, as long as they do not leave the designated free throw area.

The key points are:
1. Players can jump while attempting a free throw.
2. They must not leave the designated free throw area during the jump.

Therefore, the answer to the question "Can you jump on free throws in the NBA?" is:

Yes, players are allowed to jump on free throws in the NBA, as long as they do not leave the designated free throw area.
