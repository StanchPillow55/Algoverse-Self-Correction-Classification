==================================================

To answer the question "Can you jump on free throws in the NBA?", we need to refer to the context provided.

According to the context:
- Players are permitted to jump while attempting the free throw, provided they do not leave the designated area at any point.

This means that in the NBA, players are allowed to jump on free throws, as long as they do not leave the designated free throw area during the jump.

The context also mentions that a violation by the shooter cancels the free throw, but a violation by the defensive team results in a substitute free throw if the shooter missed. This further reinforces that jumping on free throws is allowed in the NBA, as long as the shooter does not commit any other violations.

Therefore, the final answer is:
Yes, players can jump on free throws in the NBA, as long as they do not leave the designated free throw area during the jump.
