==================================================

To determine whether players can jump on free throws in the NBA, we need to examine the rules and regulations governing free throws in the league.

Given information:
- Players are permitted to jump while attempting the free throw, provided they do not leave the designated area at any point.

2. This means that jumping during a free throw attempt is allowed in the NBA, as long as the player remains within the designated free throw area.
3. As
