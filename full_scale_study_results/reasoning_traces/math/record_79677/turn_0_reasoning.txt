Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine the identity of the entity referred to as "@placeholder" in the given query.

Based on the passage, the key terms and concepts related to the 2012 U.S. presidential election are:
- Caucuses
- Primaries
- Superdelegates
- Super PACs
- Attack ads
- Battleground states (e.g., Florida, Ohio, Pennsylvania)
- Red states, blue states, and purple states

However, the passage does not mention any entity named "@placeholder" or provide any information about an entity that spent $390 million in the 2010 elections.

Without more context or information about the identity of "@placeholder", it is not possible to provide a complete reasoning and work to answer the query. The given information is insufficient to determine the answer.

Therefore, the final answer is: I do not have enough information to solve this problem. The identity of "@placeholder" is not clear from the provided passage.
