Question ID: record_79677
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, I need to determine which entity the placeholder "@placeholder" represents and then provide the relevant information about their spending in the 2010 and upcoming elections.

Given information:
- @placeholder spent $390 million in the 2010 elections.
- @placeholder is expected to spend much more in the upcoming elections.

Step 1: Identify the entity represented by the placeholder "@placeholder".
Based on the context provided, the placeholder "@placeholder" likely represents a Super PAC (Super Political Action Committee) or a similar type of political organization that can spend large sums of money on political campaigns and elections.

Step 2: Provide the relevant information about the spending of the identified entity.
Super PACs are independent political committees that can raise and spend unlimited amounts of money from corporations, unions, and individuals to advocate for or against political candidates. They are not allowed to coordinate directly with the candidates or their campaigns.

In the 2010 elections, the Super PAC represented by the placeholder "@placeholder" spent $390 million.
For the upcoming elections, the Super PAC is expected to spend much more than the $390 million spent in 2010.

Final answer:
