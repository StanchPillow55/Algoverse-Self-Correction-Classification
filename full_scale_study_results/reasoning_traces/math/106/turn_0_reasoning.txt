The total inner volume of a box can be calculated by subtracting the volume of the walls from the total volume of the box. 

First, we calculate the total volume of a box. The volume of a box is given by the formula length * width * height. So, the total volume of one box is 5 inches * 6 inches * 4 inches = 120 cubic inches.

Since John has 3 boxes, the total volume of all 3 boxes is 3 * 120 cubic inches = 360 cubic inches.

Next, we calculate the volume of the walls. The walls are 1 inch thick, so the inner dimensions of the box are (5-2) inches by (6-2) inches by (4-2) inches = 3 inches * 4 inches * 2 inches = 24 cubic inches (we subtract 2 because there are walls on both sides of each dimension).

So, the total inner volume of one box is 24 cubic inches.

Since John has 3 boxes, the total inner volume of all 3 boxes is 3 * 24 cubic inches = 72 cubic inches.

So, the total inner volume of all 3 boxes is 72 cubic inches.
