Question ID: 49
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to find the total number of units in the building. We do this by multiplying the number of floors by the number of units per floor. 

15 floors * 8 units/floor = 120 units

Next, we need to find out how many units are occupied. We know that 3/4 of the units are occupied, so we multiply the total number of units by 3/4.

120 units * 3/4 = 90 units

Finally, to find the number of unoccupied units, we subtract the number of occupied units from the total number of units.

120 units - 90 units = 30 units

So, there are 30 unoccupied units in the building.
