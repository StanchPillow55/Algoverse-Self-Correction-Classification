Question ID: 49
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, let's find out the total number of units in the building. Since there are 15 floors and each floor contains 8 units, we can find the total number of units by multiplying the number of floors by the number of units per floor.

Total units = Number of floors * Units per floor
Total units = 15 floors * 8 units/floor = 120 units

Next, we know that 3/4 of the building is occupied. To find out how many units are occupied, we multiply the total number of units by 3/4.

Occupied units = Total units * 3/4
Occupied units = 120 units * 3/4 = 90 units

Finally, to find out the number of unoccupied units, we subtract the number of occupied units from the total number of units.

Unoccupied units = Total units - Occupied units
Unoccupied units = 120 units - 90 units = 30 units

So, there are 30 unoccupied units in the building.
