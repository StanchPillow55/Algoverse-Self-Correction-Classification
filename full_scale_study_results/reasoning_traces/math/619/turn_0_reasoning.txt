Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, let's calculate the total number of street lights. 

Each pole has 4 street lights and there are 6 poles at each intersection, so the number of street lights at each intersection is 4 * 6 = 24 street lights.

If the road has 4 intersections, then the total number of street lights on the road is 24 * 4 = 96 street lights.

Now, we know that 20 street lights are not working. So, the total number of functioning street lights is 96 - 20 = 76 street lights.

So, the final answer is that there are 76 functioning street lights.
