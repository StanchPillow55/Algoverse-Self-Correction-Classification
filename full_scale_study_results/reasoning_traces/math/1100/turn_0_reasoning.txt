Question ID: 1100
Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

Bobby takes a 30-minute lunch and two 15-minute breaks per day. 

First, let's calculate the total time Bobby spends on lunch and breaks each day:

30 minutes (lunch) + 15 minutes (break) + 15 minutes (break) = 60 minutes.

So, Bobby spends 60 minutes or 1 hour each day on lunch and breaks.

Since Bobby works 5 days a week, we multiply the daily total by 5 to find the weekly total:

1 hour/day * 5 days/week = 5 hours/week.

Therefore, Bobby's lunches and breaks add up to 5 hours over the course of 5 days.
