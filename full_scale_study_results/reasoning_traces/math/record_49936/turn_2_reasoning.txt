Question ID: record_49936
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine the appropriate word to replace the placeholder "@placeholder" in the given quote.

Given information:
- The quote mentions "a couple of years ago when @placeholder devices were just coming out and had a hands-free profile [for integrating with vehicles] and few phones supported it."

Step 1: Identify the type of device being referred to in the quote.
The quote suggests that the devices being discussed were "just coming out" and had a "hands-free profile for integrating with vehicles." This indicates that the devices are likely referring to Bluetooth-enabled devices.

Step 2: Determine the appropriate word to replace the placeholder "@placeholder".
Based on the context provided, the most appropriate word to replace the placeholder "@placeholder" is "Bluetooth."

The complete quote with the placeholder replaced would be:
"It's very similar to a couple of years ago when Bluetooth devices were just coming out and had a hands-free profile [for integrating with vehicles] and few phones supported it," he says.

Therefore, the final answer is:
Bluetooth
