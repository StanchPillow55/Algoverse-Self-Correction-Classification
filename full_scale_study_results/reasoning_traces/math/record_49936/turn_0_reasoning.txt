To solve this problem, we need to determine the appropriate word to replace the placeholder "@placeholder" in the given quote.

Based on the context provided in the passage, the quote is discussing the development and integration of voice-activated technology, specifically Ford's Sync system, which allows users to interact with their phones while driving without taking their hands off the wheel.
