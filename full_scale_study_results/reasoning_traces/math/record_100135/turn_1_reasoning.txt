==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of seats the Democratic party will have to defend in the upcoming election, given the information provided in the passage.

Given information:
- In less than two years, the Democratic party will have to defend 24 seats.
- Some of these seats are in states that Obama won in the last election.

Step 1: Identify the relevant information from the passage.
The passage mentions that the Republican-led Congress will not pass the tax increases proposed by President Obama, and that the Republicans have lined up a series of votes intended to embarrass the Democrats.
However, the passage does not provide any specific information about the number of seats the Democratic party will have to defend in the upcoming election.

Step 2: Provide a concise answer based on the information given in the question.
In less than two years, the Democratic party will have to defend 24 seats, including several in states that Obama won in the last election.

Final answer: 24 seats
