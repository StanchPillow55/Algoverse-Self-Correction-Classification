To solve this problem, we need to find the number of seats the Democratic party will have to defend in less than two years.

Given information:
- The passage mentions that in less than two years, the Democratic party will have to defend 24 seats.
- The passage also mentions that some of these seats are in states that Obama won in the last election.

Step 1: Identify the number of seats the Democratic party will have to defend in less than two years.
