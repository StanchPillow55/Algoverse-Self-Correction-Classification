Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, let's find out how many green cars there are. We know that there are 2 fewer green cars than red cars. Since there are 12 red cars, there are 12 - 2 = <<12-2=10>>10 green cars.

Next, let's find out how many blue cars there are. We know that there are 3 times the number of blue cars as there are green cars. Since there are 10 green cars, there are 3 * 10 = <<3*10=30>>30 blue cars.

Now, let's add up the number of red, green, and blue cars to find out how many cars we have accounted for. We have 12 red cars + 10 green cars + 30 blue cars = <<12+10+30=52>>52 cars.

Finally, we know that the total number of cars is 75. To find out how many yellow cars there are, we subtract the number of cars we have accounted for from the total number of cars. So, there are 75 total cars - 52 cars we have accounted for = <<75-52=23>>23 yellow cars.

So, the bumper car rink has 23 yellow cars.
