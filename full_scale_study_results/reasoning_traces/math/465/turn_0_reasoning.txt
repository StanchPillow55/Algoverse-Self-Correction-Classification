Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, let's calculate the total number of basketball cards Miss Maria has. Since she has six decks with 25 cards in each, she has 6 * 25 = <<6*25=150>>150 basketball cards.

Next, let's calculate the total number of baseball cards she has. Since she has five boxes with 40 cards in each, she has 5 * 40 = <<5*40=200>>200 baseball cards.

So, the total number of sports cards Miss Maria has is 150 basketball cards + 200 baseball cards = <<150+200=350>>350 cards.

Miss Maria keeps 50 cards, so she gives away 350 cards - 50 cards = <<350-50=300>>300 cards.

Since each student gets 10 cards, the number of students Miss Maria has is 300 cards / 10 cards/student = <<300/10=30>>30 students.

So, Miss Maria has 30 students.
