==================================================

Let's denote the length of the fence that Sam gets as S and the length of the fence that Harry gets as H. 

According to the problem, we know two things:

1. The total length of the fence is 100 feet, so S + H = 100.
2. Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam, so H = S + 60.

We can substitute the second equation into the first to solve for S:

S + (S + 60) = 100
2S + 60 = 100
2S = 100 - 60
2S = 40
S = 40 / 2
S = 20

So, Sam gets 20 feet of the fence.
