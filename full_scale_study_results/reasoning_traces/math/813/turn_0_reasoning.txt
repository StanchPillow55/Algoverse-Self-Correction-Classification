Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to find out how many marshmallows are left after John and DeSean made their S'mores and dropped some on the ground. 

John used 9 marshmallows for his S'mores and DeSean also used 9. So together, they used 9 + 9 = 18 marshmallows for their S'mores. 

They also dropped 3 marshmallows on the ground, so we add this to the total used: 18 + 3 = 21 marshmallows used in total.

The bag originally had 35 marshmallows, so we subtract the number used from the original total to find out how many are left: 35 - 21 = 14 marshmallows are left.

Since each S'more uses one marshmallow, and there are 14 marshmallows left, they can make 14 more S'mores. 

If we divide this evenly between the two kids, each kid can make 14 / 2 = 7 more S'mores.

So, each kid can have 7 more S'mores with the marshmallows left in the bag.
