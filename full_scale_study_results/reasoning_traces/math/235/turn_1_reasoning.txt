Question ID: 235
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to determine the total number of pizza slices John needs. Since each friend needs 4 slices and there are 20 friends, we multiply 4 by 20 to get 80 slices.

Next, we need to figure out how many pizzas John needs to order. Since each pizza is sliced into 8 portions, we divide the total number of slices needed (80) by the number of slices per pizza (8).

80 รท 8 = 10

So, John needs to order 10 pizzas.
