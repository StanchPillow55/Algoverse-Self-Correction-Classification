Question ID: 235
Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to determine how many slices of pizza John needs in total. Since each friend needs 4 slices and there are 20 friends, we multiply these two numbers together.

4 slices/friend * 20 friends = 80 slices

Next, we need to figure out how many pizzas John needs to order. Since each pizza is sliced into 8 portions, we divide the total number of slices needed by the number of slices per pizza.

80 slices / 8 slices/pizza = 10 pizzas

So, John needs to order 10 pizzas to ensure each of his 20 friends can have 4 slices.
