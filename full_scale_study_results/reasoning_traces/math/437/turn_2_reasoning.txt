Question ID: 437
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we first need to find out the total number of oranges Sitti and Juris have. 

Sitti has 34 oranges and Juris has 22 oranges. So, we add these two numbers together to find the total number of oranges.

34 (Sitti's oranges) + 22 (Juris's oranges) = 56 oranges

Now, Sitti and Juris want to share these oranges equally with their 6 other friends. But we also need to include Sitti and Juris in the count because they will also get a share of the oranges. So, the total number of people sharing the oranges is 8 (6 friends + Sitti + Juris).

To find out how many oranges each person will get, we divide the total number of oranges by the total number of people.

56 oranges รท 8 people = 7 oranges/person

So, each person will get 7 oranges. 

Therefore, the final answer is 7 oranges per person.
