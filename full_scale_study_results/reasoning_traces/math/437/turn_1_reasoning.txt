Question ID: 437
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to find out how many oranges Sitti and Juris have in total. We do this by adding the number of oranges each of them has.

Sitti has 34 oranges and Juris has 22 oranges. 

So, 34 (Sitti's oranges) + 22 (Juris's oranges) = 56 oranges in total.

Now, Sitti and Juris want to share these oranges equally with their 6 other friends. This means that the oranges will be divided among 8 people in total (Sitti, Juris, and their 6 friends).

To find out how many oranges each person will get, we divide the total number of oranges by the total number of people.

So, 56 (total oranges) รท 8 (total people) = 7 oranges per person.

Therefore, each person will get 7 oranges.
