Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to find out how many oranges there are in total. We do this by adding the number of oranges Sitti and Juris bought. 

Sitti bought 34 oranges and Juris bought 22 oranges. 

So, 34 oranges + 22 oranges = 56 oranges

Next, we need to find out how many people are going to share these oranges. Sitti and Juris are sharing the oranges with 6 other friends. Including Sitti and Juris, that makes 8 people in total. 

Now, we divide the total number of oranges by the total number of people to find out how many oranges each person will get. 

So, 56 oranges รท 8 people = 7 oranges per person

Therefore, each person will get 7 oranges.
