Question ID: boolq_150
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To determine if Canada is in the 2018 Soccer World Cup, we need to look at the context provided:

1. Canada's men's national soccer team was unable to qualify for the fifth round of the 2018 World Cup qualifying, despite a 3-1 win over El Salvador.
2. As a result, the head coach, Benito Floro, was sacked on September 14, ending his reign as manager of the national team.

Based on this information, we can conclude that Canada did not qualify for the 2018 Soccer World Cup. The fact that they were unable to advance to the fifth round of qualifying means they did not make it to the final tournament.

Therefore, the final answer is:

No, Canada is not in the 2018 Soccer World Cup.
