==================================================

To determine whether Canada is in the 2018 Soccer World Cup, we need to look at the context provided.

Given information:
- On September 6, 2016, the Canada men's national soccer team had a 3-1 win over El Salvador.
- However, despite this win, Canada was not able to qualify for the fifth round of the 2018 World Cup qualifying.
- As a result, the head coach, Benito Floro, was sacked on September 14, 2016, ending his reign as the manager of the national team.

Reasoning:
1. The fact that Canada was not able to qualify for the fifth round of the 2018 World Cup qualifying suggests that they did not make it to the 2018 World Cup.
2. The sacking of the head coach, Benito Floro, after the team's failure to qualify for the 2018 World Cup further reinforces the conclusion that Canada is not participating in the 2018 Soccer World Cup.

Final Answer:
Based on the given information, the answer is that Canada is not in the 2018 Soccer World Cup.
