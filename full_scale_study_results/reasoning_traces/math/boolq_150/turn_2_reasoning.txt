Question ID: boolq_150
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To determine if Canada is in the 2018 Soccer World Cup, we need to look at the context provided:

1. On September 6, 2016, Canada's men's national soccer team had a 3-1 win over El Salvador.
2. However, despite this win, Canada was not able to qualify for the fifth round of the 2018 World Cup qualifying.
3. As a result, on September 14, 2016, the head coach Benito Floro was sacked, ending his reign as manager of the national team.

Based on this information, we can conclude that:

1. Canada did not qualify for the 2018 Soccer World Cup.
2. The fact that the head coach was sacked after the team's failure to qualify for the fifth round of the 2018 World Cup qualifying indicates that Canada did not make it to the 2018 World Cup.

Therefore, the final answer is:

No, Canada is not in the 2018 Soccer World Cup.
