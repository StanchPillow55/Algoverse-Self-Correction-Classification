Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, let's calculate the cost of the picture frames for all the seniors. There are 44 seniors and each picture frame costs $20, so the total cost for the picture frames is 44 * $20 = $880.

Next, we need to calculate the additional cost for etching the logo on each frame. This is an additional 20% of the cost of each frame. So, we need to calculate 20% of $20, which is $20 * 0.20 = $4. Since there are 44 seniors, the total cost for etching the logos is 44 * $4 = $176.

Then, we need to calculate the cost of the pins for the 2 seniors. Each pin costs $5, so the total cost for the pins is 2 * $5 = $10.

Next, we need to calculate the cost of the cords for the officers. 1/4 of the seniors are officers, so there are 44 / 4 = 11 officers. Each cord costs $12, so the total cost for the cords is 11 * $12 = $132.

Finally, we add up all these costs to find the total cost for the senior gifts. The total cost is $880 (for the frames) + $176 (for the etching) + $10 (for the pins) + $132 (for the cords) = $1198.

So, $1198 will be spent on the senior gifts.
