==================================================

First, let's calculate the total cost of the cars before tax and registration. Each car costs $20,000 and Mark is buying 12 cars, so the total cost is $20,000 * 12 = $240,000.

Next, we need to calculate the tax. The tax rate is 10%, so the total tax is 10% of $240,000. To calculate this, we multiply $240,000 by 10% (or 0.10), which gives us $240,000 * 0.10 = $24,000.

Then, we need to calculate the cost of registration. Each car costs $1,000 to register and Mark is registering 12 cars, so the total cost of registration is $1,000 * 12 = $12,000.

Finally, we add up all these costs to find the total cost. The total cost is the cost of the cars plus the tax plus the registration, which is $240,000 + $24,000 + $12,000 = $276,000.

So, Mark pays a total of $276,000 for the 12 cars, including tax and registration.
