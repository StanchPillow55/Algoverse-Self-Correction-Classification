Question ID: 230
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the cars before tax and registration

The cost of each car is $20,000 and Mark buys 12 cars. Therefore, the total cost of the cars before tax and registration is:

$20,000 * 12 = $240,000

Step 2: Calculate the tax on the cars

Mark pays 10% tax on the cars. Therefore, the total tax he pays is:

10% of $240,000 = 0.10 * $240,000 = $24,000

Step 3: Calculate the total cost of registration

Mark pays $1,000 for registration on each car. Therefore, the total cost of registration is:

$1,000 * 12 = $12,000

Step 4: Calculate the total cost of the cars including tax and registration

The total cost of the cars including tax and registration is the sum of the cost of the cars before tax and registration, the tax, and the registration. Therefore, the total cost is:

$240,000 + $24,000 + $12,000 = $276,000

Therefore, Mark pays a total of $276,000 for the fleet of 12 cars including tax and registration.
