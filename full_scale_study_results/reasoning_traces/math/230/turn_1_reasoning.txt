Question ID: 230
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the cars before tax and registration

The cost of each car is $20,000 and Mark is buying 12 cars. Therefore, the total cost of the cars is $20,000 * 12 = $240,000.

Step 2: Calculate the tax

Mark pays 10% tax on the cars. 10% of $240,000 is $240,000 * 0.10 = $24,000.

Step 3: Calculate the registration cost

The registration cost for each car is $1,000 and Mark is registering 12 cars. Therefore, the total registration cost is $1,000 * 12 = $12,000.

Step 4: Calculate the total cost

The total cost of the cars, including tax and registration, is the sum of the cost of the cars, the tax, and the registration. Therefore, the total cost is $240,000 + $24,000 + $12,000 = $276,000.

So, Mark pays $276,000 for everything.
