==================================================

To determine how much money Derrick makes in June from selling doughnuts, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of doughnuts made per day:**
   - Derrick makes 10 dozen doughnuts every day.
   - Since 1 dozen equals 12 doughnuts, 10 dozen is:
     \[
     10 \times 12 = 120 \text{ doughnuts per day}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total number of doughnuts made in June:**
   - June has 30 days.
   - Therefore, the total number of doughnuts made in June is:
     \[
     120 \text{ doughnuts/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 3600 \text{ doughnuts}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total revenue from selling the doughnuts:**
   - Each doughnut is sold for $2.
   - Therefore, the total revenue is:
     \[
     3600 \text{ doughnuts} \times 2 \text{ dollars/doughnut} = 7200 \text{ dollars}
     \]

Thus, Derrick makes a total of $7,200 in June if he sells all the doughnuts.

**Final Answer: Derrick makes $7,200 in June.**
