==================================================

First, let's determine how many doughnuts Derrick makes every day. Since a dozen is equal to 12, Derrick makes 10 * 12 = 120 doughnuts each day.

Next, we need to calculate how much money Derrick makes each day from selling all his doughnuts. Since each doughnut is sold for $2, Derrick makes 120 * $2 = $240 each day.

Now, we need to determine how many days are in June. June has 30 days.

Finally, we can calculate how much money Derrick makes in June by multiplying his daily earnings by the number of days in June. So, Derrick makes $240 * 30 = $7200 in June.

Therefore, if Derrick sells all his doughnuts every day in June, he will make $7200.
