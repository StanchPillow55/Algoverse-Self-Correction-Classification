To solve this problem, we need to extract the relevant information from the given passage and then use it to determine the lead of the Oxford crew over the Cambridge crew during the 159th Oxford versus Cambridge Boat Race.

Given information:
- Oxford University beat Cambridge by a length and a half to win the 159th BNY Mellon Boat Race.
- The race lasted 17 minutes and 27 seconds.
- Oxford's overall lead over Cambridge in the Boat Race series is now 81-77.

Step 1: Understand the meaning of "a length and a half" in the context of a boat race.
In boat racing, a "length" refers to the length of the boat, which is typically around 60 feet (18.3 meters). Therefore, "a length and a half" would be approximately 90 feet (27.4 meters).

Step 2: Calculate the lead of the Oxford crew over the Cambridge crew.
The Oxford crew won the race by a length and a half, which is approximately 90 feet (27.4 meters).

Step 3: Determine the final answer.
The Oxford crew leads the Cambridge crew
