Question ID: 424
Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to calculate the total capacity of each type of vehicle.

For the buses, we multiply the number of buses by the capacity of each bus. 
4 buses * 60 employees/bus = 240 employees

For the minibusses, we do the same.
6 minibusses * 30 employees/minibus = 180 employees

And for the minivans, we again multiply the number of minivans by the capacity of each minivan.
10 minivans * 15 employees/minivan = 150 employees

To find the total number of employees that can join the day trip, we add up the capacities of all the vehicles.
240 employees (from buses) + 180 employees (from minibusses) + 150 employees (from minivans) = 570 employees

So, a total of 570 employees can join the day trip.
