Question ID: 95
Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to find out how many boys there are. We know that 2/5 of the students are boys. So, we multiply 200 by 2/5:

200 * 2/5 = 80 boys

Since we know the total number of students and the number of boys, we can subtract to find out how many girls there are:

200 students - 80 boys = 120 girls

Next, we need to find out how many girls are in the girl scout. We know that 2/3 of the girls are in the girl scout. So, we multiply 120 by 2/3:

120 * 2/3 = 80 girls are in the girl scout

Finally, we subtract the number of girls in the girl scout from the total number of girls to find out how many girls are not in the girl scout:

120 girls - 80 girls in the girl scout = 40 girls are not in the girl scout

So, the final answer is that 40 girls are not in the girl scout.
