==================================================

Sadie slept 8 hours on Monday.

For the next two days, she slept 2 hours less each day, which means she slept 8 - 2 = <<8-2=6>>6 hours each day.

So for the next two days, she slept a total of 6 * 2 = <<6*2=12>>12 hours.

For the rest of the week, she slept 1 hour more than those two days, which means she slept 6 + 1 = <<6+1=7>>7 hours each day.

The rest of the week is 7 - 3 = <<7-3=4>>4 days (since the week has 7 days and she has already slept for 3 days).

So for the rest of the week, she slept a total of 7 * 4 = <<7*4=28>>28 hours.

Adding up all these hours, Sadie slept a total of 8 (Monday) + 12 (next two days) + 28 (rest of the week) = <<8+12+28=48>>48 hours throughout the week.

So, Sadie slept 48 hours in total throughout the week.
