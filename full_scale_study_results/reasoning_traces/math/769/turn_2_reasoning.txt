Question ID: 769
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To determine how much Tanya earned for these two days of teaching, we need to calculate her earnings for each day separately and then sum them up.

**Monday:**

1. **Hourly Earnings:**
   - Tanya earns $15 per hour.
   - On Monday, she worked for 5 hours.
   - Her earnings from hours worked on Monday are calculated as follows:
     \[
     5 \, \text{hours} \times 15 \, \text{dollars/hour} = 75 \, \text{dollars}
     \]

2. **Additional Earnings for Classes:**
   - Tanya earns an additional $5 if she teaches more than 3 classes in a day.
   - On Monday, she taught 4 classes, which is more than 3.
   - Therefore, she earns an additional $5.
   - Total earnings for Monday:
     \[
     75 \, \text{dollars} + 5 \, \text{dollars} = 80 \, \text{dollars}
     \]

**Wednesday:**

1. **Hourly Earnings:**
   - On Wednesday, she worked for 2 hours.
   - Her earnings from hours worked on Wednesday are calculated as follows:
     \[
     2 \, \text{hours} \times 15 \, \text{dollars/hour} = 30 \, \text{dollars}
     \]

2. **Additional Earnings for Classes:**
   - On Wednesday, she taught 2 classes, which is not more than 3.
   - Therefore, she does not earn the additional $5.
   - Total earnings for Wednesday:
     \[
     30 \, \text{dollars}
     \]

**Total Earnings for Both Days:**

- Add the earnings from Monday and Wednesday:
  \[
  80 \, \text{dollars (Monday)} + 30 \, \text{dollars (Wednesday)} = 110 \, \text{dollars}
  \]

Thus, Tanya earned a total of $110 for these two days of teaching.

**Final Answer:**
Tanya earned $110 for Monday and Wednesday combined.
