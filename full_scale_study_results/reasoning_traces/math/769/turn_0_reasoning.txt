==================================================

First, let's calculate how much Tanya earns per day based on the number of hours she works. 

On Monday, Tanya teaches 4 classes for 5 hours. Since she earns $15 per hour, she earns 5 hours * $15/hour = $<<5*15=75>>75 on Monday from her hourly wage. 

On Wednesday, Tanya teaches 2 classes for 2 hours. So, she earns 2 hours * $15/hour = $<<2*15=30>>30 on Wednesday from her hourly wage. 

Now, let's consider the additional $5 she earns per day if she teaches more than 3 classes. On Monday, she teaches 4 classes, which is more than 3, so she earns an additional $5. On Wednesday, she teaches 2 classes, which is not more than 3, so she does not earn the additional $5. 

Adding up all her earnings, Tanya earns $75 (Monday's hourly wage) + $5 (Monday's additional earnings for teaching more than 3 classes) + $30 (Wednesday's hourly wage) = $<<75+5+30=110>>110 for these two days of teaching. 

So, Tanya earned $110 for these two days of teaching.
