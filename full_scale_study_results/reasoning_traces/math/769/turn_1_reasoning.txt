Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to calculate Tanya's earnings for each day separately and then add them together.

On Monday, Tanya taught 4 classes for 5 hours. She earns $15 per hour, so for the hours she worked, she earned 5 hours * $15/hour = $75. Since she taught more than 3 classes, she also earns an additional $5 for the day. So, her total earnings for Monday are $75 + $5 = $80.

On Wednesday, Tanya taught 2 classes for 2 hours. She earns $15 per hour, so for the hours she worked, she earned 2 hours * $15/hour = $30. Since she taught 3 classes or less, she doesn't earn the additional $5 for the day. So, her total earnings for Wednesday are $30.

Adding her earnings for both days together, Tanya earned $80 (Monday) + $30 (Wednesday) = $110 for these two days of teaching. 

So, the final answer is $110.
