Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

The restaurant initially has 170 normal chairs and 23 baby chairs. 

To find out how many chairs are left after some are sent for repair, we need to subtract the number of chairs sent for repair from the total number of chairs.

First, let's calculate the number of normal chairs left:

170 (total normal chairs) - 20 (normal chairs sent for repair) = 150 normal chairs left

Next, let's calculate the number of baby chairs left:

23 (total baby chairs) - 13 (baby chairs sent for repair) = 10 baby chairs left

Finally, to find the total number of chairs left in the restaurant, we add the number of normal chairs left and the number of baby chairs left:

150 (normal chairs left) + 10 (baby chairs left) = 160 chairs left

So, the restaurant has 160 chairs left.
