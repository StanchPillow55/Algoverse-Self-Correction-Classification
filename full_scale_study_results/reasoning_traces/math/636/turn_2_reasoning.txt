Question ID: 636
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of customers processed by both Julie and Jewel in a week, given that Julie operates the cash register twice as fast as Jewel.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Determine Jewel's Daily Production:**
   - Jewel processes 50 customers per day.

2. **Determine Julie's Daily Production:**
   - Since Julie operates the cash register twice as fast as Jewel, she processes twice the number of customers that Jewel does in the same amount of time.
   - Therefore, Julie processes \(2 \times 50 = 100\) customers per day.

3. **Calculate Total Daily Production for Both:**
   - Together, Julie and Jewel process:
     \[
     50 \text{ (Jewel)} + 100 \text{ (Julie)} = 150 \text{ customers per day}
     \]

4. **Calculate Weekly Production:**
   - They work all days of the week, which means they work 7 days a week.
   - Therefore, the total weekly production for both is:
     \[
     150 \text{ customers/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 1050 \text{ customers/week}
     \]

### Final Answer:
The total weekly production for Julie and Jewel, if they work all days of the week, is 1050 customers.
