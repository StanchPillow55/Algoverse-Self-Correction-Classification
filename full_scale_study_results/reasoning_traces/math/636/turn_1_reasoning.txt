Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine how many customers Julie and Jewel together can process in a week, given that Julie operates the cash register twice as fast as Jewel, and Jewel processes 50 customers daily.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Determine Jewel's Daily Production:**
   - Jewel processes 50 customers per day.

2. **Determine Julie's Daily Production:**
   - Julie operates the cash register twice as fast as Jewel. Therefore, Julie can process twice the number of customers that Jewel can process in a day.
   - Julie's daily production = 2 × Jewel's daily production = 2 × 50 = 100 customers per day.

3. **Calculate the Total Daily Production for Both:**
   - Total daily production for both Julie and Jewel = Jewel's daily production + Julie's daily production
   - Total daily production = 50 (Jewel) + 100 (Julie) = 150 customers per day.

4. **Calculate the Total Weekly Production:**
   - Since they work all days of the week, they work 7 days a week.
   - Total weekly production = Total daily production × Number of days in a week
   - Total weekly production = 150 customers/day × 7 days = 1050 customers.

### Final Answer:
The total weekly production for Julie and Jewel, if they work all days of the week, is 1050 customers.
