Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

Julie processes customers twice as fast as Jewel. This means that if Jewel processes 50 customers a day, Julie processes 2 * 50 = 100 customers a day.

In a week, Jewel processes 50 customers/day * 7 days/week = 350 customers/week.

In the same week, Julie processes 100 customers/day * 7 days/week = 700 customers/week.

Therefore, the total weekly production for the two is 350 customers/week + 700 customers/week = 1050 customers/week.

So, Julie and Jewel together process 1050 customers in a week.
