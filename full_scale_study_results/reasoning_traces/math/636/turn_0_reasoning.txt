To solve the problem, we need to determine how many customers Julie processes in a day and then calculate the total weekly production for both Julie and Jewel.

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - Jewel processes 50 customers per day.
   - Julie operates the cash register twice as fast as Jewel.

2. **Calculating Julie's Daily Production**:
   Since Julie works twice as fast as Jewel, we can calculate the number of customers she processes in a day:
   \[
   \text{Customers processed by Julie per day} = 2 \times \text{Customers processed by Jewel per day}
   \]
   Substituting Jewel's daily production:
   \[
   \text{Customers processed by Julie per day} = 2 \times 50 = 100
   \]

3. **Calculating Total Daily Production**:
   Now we can find the total number of customers processed by both Julie and Jewel in one day:
   \[
   \text{Total daily production} = \text{Customers processed by Jewel} + \text{Customers processed by Julie}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total daily production} = 50 + 100 = 150
   \]

4. **Calculating Total Weekly Production**:
   Since they work all days of the week (7 days), we can calculate the total weekly production:
   \[
   \text{Total weekly production} = \text{Total daily production} \times \text{Number of days in a week}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total weekly production} = 150 \times 7 = 1050
   \]

5. **Final Answer**:
   Therefore, the total weekly production for Julie and Jewel is:
   \[
   \boxed{1050}
   \]
