Question ID: 1010
Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, let's find out how many laps Trey can run. Since Trey can run 4 more laps than Bethany, and Bethany can run 10 laps, Trey can run 10 + 4 = <<10+4=14>>14 laps.

Next, let's find out how many laps Shaelyn can run. Since Shaelyn can run half as many laps as Trey, and Trey can run 14 laps, Shaelyn can run 14 / 2 = <<14/2=7>>7 laps.

Then, let's find out how many laps Quinn can run. Since Quinn can run 2 fewer laps than Shaelyn, and Shaelyn can run 7 laps, Quinn can run 7 - 2 = <<7-2=5>>5 laps.

Finally, let's find out how many more laps Bethany can run compared to Quinn. Since Bethany can run 10 laps and Quinn can run 5 laps, Bethany can run 10 - 5 = <<10-5=5>>5 more laps than Quinn.

So, Bethany can run 5 more laps than Quinn.
