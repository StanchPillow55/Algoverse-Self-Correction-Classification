Question ID: 1314
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, let's find out how old James is. We know that Dora will be 12 years old in 3 years, so she is currently 12 - 3 = 9 years old. Since James is twice as old as Dora, he is 2 * 9 = 18 years old.

Next, let's find out how old John is. We know that he had James when he was 19, so he is currently 19 + 18 = 37 years old.

Finally, let's find out how old John's youngest son is. We know that he was born when John was 32, so he is currently 37 - 32 = 5 years old.

In 3 years, John's youngest son will be 5 + 3 = 8 years old.

So, John's youngest son will be 8 years old in 3 years.
