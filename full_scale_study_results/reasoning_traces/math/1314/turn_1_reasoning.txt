Question ID: 1314
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, let's figure out how old James is currently. We know that Dora will be 12 years old in 3 years, which means she is currently 9 years old. Since James is twice as old as Dora, that means James is currently 18 years old.

Next, we need to figure out how old John is. We know that John was 19 years old when James was born, and since James is now 18, that means John is currently 19 + 18 = 37 years old.

We also know that John's youngest son was born when John was 32 years old. So, the youngest son is currently 37 - 32 = 5 years old.

Finally, we need to figure out how old the youngest son will be in 3 years. Since he is currently 5 years old, in 3 years he will be 5 + 3 = 8 years old.

So, John's youngest son will be 8 years old in 3 years.
