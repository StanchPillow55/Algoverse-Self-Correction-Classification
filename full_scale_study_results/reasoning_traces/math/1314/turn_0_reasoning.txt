Question ID: 1314
Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we know that Dora will turn 12 in 3 years. This means that Dora is currently 12 - 3 = 9 years old.

Second, we know that James is twice as old as Dora. This means that James is 2 * 9 = 18 years old.

Third, we know that John had James when he was 19. This means that John is currently 19 + 18 = 37 years old.

Finally, we know that John's youngest son was born when John was 32. This means that John's youngest son is currently 37 - 32 = 5 years old.

In 3 years, John's youngest son will be 5 + 3 = 8 years old.

So, John's youngest son will be 8 years old in 3 years.
