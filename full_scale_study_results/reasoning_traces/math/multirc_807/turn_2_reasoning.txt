Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, I will break down the reasoning step-by-step:

1. The passage states that the justice system is predicated on the assumption that both parties will be represented by lawyers who act as "gatekeepers and guides through a complex legal system that would otherwise be inaccessible to many of us."

2. However, the passage also states that "the most vulnerable members of our society are the least able to afford legal services."

3. Specifically, the passage notes that "California has a critical dearth of legal services for the poor, and, as this report makes clear, it is imperative that the state join with the federal government and private funders to increase resources so that all Californians, regardless of income, have equal access to our justice system."

4. The passage provides the statistic that "there's just one legal aid lawyer available per 10,000 poor people."

5. This shortage of legal representation for the poor is what makes the justice system difficult for them to navigate. Without a lawyer to guide them through the "complex legal system," the poor are at a significant disadvantage.

Therefore, the final answer is:
The justice system is difficult for poor people
