==================================================

To solve this problem, I will break down the reasoning step-by-step:

1. The passage states that California has a "critical dearth of legal services for the poor". This means there is a severe shortage of legal services available to poor people in California.

2. The passage provides a specific statistic to illustrate this shortage: "there's just one legal aid lawyer available per 10,000 poor people." 

3. This means that for every 10,000 poor people in California, there is only 1 legal aid lawyer available to provide them with legal services and representation.

4. The passage explains that our justice system is "predicated on the assumption that both parties will be represented by lawyers who act as gatekeepers and guides through a complex legal system." 

5. However, "the most vulnerable members of our society are the least able to afford legal services." 

6. Therefore, the justice system is difficult for poor people because there is a severe shortage of legal aid lawyers available to represent them, leaving them unable to navigate the complex legal system without proper legal guidance and representation.

Final answer: The justice system is difficult for poor people because there is just one legal aid lawyer available
