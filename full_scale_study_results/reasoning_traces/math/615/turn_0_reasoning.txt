==================================================

First, let's calculate the total cost of each item separately.

The aquarium cost $10.00.

The rocks cost $2.50 each, and she bought 2 bags. So, the total cost of the rocks is 2.50 * 2 = $5.00.

The coral pieces cost $2.00 each, and she bought 3 pieces. So, the total cost of the coral is 2.00 * 3 = $6.00.

The fish cost $0.50 each, and she bought 20 fish. So, the total cost of the fish is 0.50 * 20 = $10.00.

The fish food cost $2.00.

Now, let's add up all these costs to find out how much Scarlett spent in total.

The total cost is 10.00 (aquarium) + 5.00 (rocks) + 6.00 (coral) + 10.00 (fish) + 2.00 (fish food) = $33.00.

So, Scarlett spent $33.00 in total.
