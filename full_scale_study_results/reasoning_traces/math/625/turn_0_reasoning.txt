Question ID: 625
Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to find out how many flowers Arianna has planted in total. We can do this by multiplying the number of rows by the number of flowers in each row. 

10 rows * 20 flowers/row = 200 flowers

Next, we need to find out how many of these flowers have bloomed. We know that 4/5 of the flowers have bloomed. 

To find this, we multiply the total number of flowers by 4/5:

200 flowers * 4/5 = 160 flowers

So, 160 flowers in Arianna's garden have bloomed.
