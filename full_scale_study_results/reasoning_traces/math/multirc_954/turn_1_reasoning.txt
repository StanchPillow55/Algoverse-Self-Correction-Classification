==================================================

To answer this question, we need to understand the context provided in the paragraph.

The paragraph states that "FAA rules required that the doors remain closed and locked during flight." This suggests that the cockpit door was supposed to be locked and inaccessible to unauthorized personnel, including the hijackers.

The paragraph then mentions that "Ong speculated that they had 'jammed their way' in." This implies that the hijackers had to use force or some other means to gain unauthorized access to the cockpit, as the door was supposed to be locked.

The reason the hijackers would have to "jam their way in" is that they were not authorized to enter the cockpit, and the cockpit door was locked to prevent unauthorized access, as per FAA regulations.

If the hijackers had simply been able to open the cockpit door, there would have been no need to "jam their way in." The fact that they had to do so suggests that they were trying to bypass the security measures in place to keep the cockpit inaccessible to unauthorized personnel.

Therefore, the hijackers would have had to jam their way in to the cockpit because the cockpit door was locked,
