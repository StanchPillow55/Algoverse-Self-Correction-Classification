Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to understand the context provided in the paragraph and the reasoning behind the hijackers' actions.

The paragraph states that the FAA rules required the cockpit doors to remain closed and locked during flight. This suggests that the hijackers would not have been able to simply open the cockpit door and gain access to the cockpit.

The paragraph then mentions that Ong speculated that the hijackers had "jammed their way" into the cockpit. This implies that the hijackers had to use force or some other means to break through the locked cockpit door.

The possible reasons for the hijackers needing to "jam their way" into the cockpit could be:

1. To prevent the pilots from locking them out of the cockpit and contacting authorities.
2. To take control of the aircraft and prevent the pilots from taking any actions to stop the hijacking.
3. To ensure that they could access the controls and navigate the aircraft to their desired destination.

Based on the information provided in the paragraph, the most likely reason for the hijackers needing to "jam their way" into the cockpit would be to stop the police or other authorities from
