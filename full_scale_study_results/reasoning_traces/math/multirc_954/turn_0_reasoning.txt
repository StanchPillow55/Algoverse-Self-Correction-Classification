==================================================

To answer this question, we need to understand the context provided in the paragraph.

The paragraph states that "FAA rules required that the doors remain closed and locked during flight." This means that the cockpit door was supposed to be kept locked and closed during the flight, as per the regulations set by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA).

The paragraph then mentions that "Ong speculated that they had 'jammed their way' in." This suggests that the hijackers had to forcefully enter the cockpit, as the door was supposed to be locked and closed.

The reasoning behind this is that the hijackers needed to gain access to the cockpit in order to take control of the aircraft. If the cockpit door was locked and closed, as per the FAA rules, the hijackers would have had to use force or some other means to break through and enter the cockpit.

Therefore, the hijackers would have had to "jam their way in" because the cockpit door was supposed to be locked and closed, and they needed to gain access to the cockpit in order to take control of the aircraft.

Final answer: The hijackers would have had to jam their way into the cockpit
