Question ID: 450
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

Let's break down the problem:

1. The super ticket costs $20 and includes a movie, popcorn, and a soda. The popcorn and soda together cost an extra $1 with this ticket.

2. The regular movie ticket costs $12. With this ticket, you have to buy the popcorn and soda at their regular prices.

3. You chose the regular ticket and saved $2 compared to the super ticket. This means you spent $20 - $2 = $18 in total.

4. The soda costs $3. 

5. We need to find the regular price of the popcorn.

Since you bought the regular ticket, the movie cost $12, and the soda cost $3. So, you spent $12 + $3 = $15 on the movie and soda.

Subtracting this from the total amount you spent gives the cost of the popcorn. So, the popcorn costs $18 - $15 = $3.

Therefore, the regular price of the popcorn is $3.
