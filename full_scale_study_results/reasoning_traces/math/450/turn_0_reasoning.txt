Dataset Type: math
==================================================

Let's denote the regular price of popcorn as P. 

If you bought a regular movie ticket, popcorn, and a soda, and ended up saving $2 compared to the super ticket, then the total cost of these items is $20 (the cost of the super ticket) minus $2 (the savings), which equals $18.

The cost of a regular movie ticket is $12, and the cost of a soda is $3. So, the cost of the movie ticket and the soda together is $12 + $3 = $15.

Since the total cost of the movie ticket, popcorn, and soda is $18, and the cost of the movie ticket and soda is $15, then the cost of the popcorn is $18 - $15 = $3.

So, the regular price of popcorn is $3.
