Question ID: 450
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

Let's break down the problem:

1. The super ticket costs $20 and includes a movie, popcorn, and soda. The soda is an extra $1, so the movie and popcorn together cost $19.

2. The regular movie ticket costs $12. So, if you bought the movie ticket and popcorn (without the soda), you would have spent $19 (the cost of the super ticket minus the $1 for the soda).

3. Therefore, the cost of the popcorn is $19 (the cost of the movie and popcorn together) minus $12 (the cost of the movie ticket alone) which equals $7.

4. However, the problem states that you saved $2 by not buying the super ticket. This means that the actual cost of the popcorn is $7 minus the $2 you saved, which equals $5.

So, the regular price of the popcorn is $5.
