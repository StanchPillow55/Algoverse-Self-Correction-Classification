Question ID: record_40897
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, I will need to determine the missing word in the query. The context provided in the passage suggests that the missing word is likely the name of the cast members of "The Expendables 3" movie.

Given information:
- The passage mentions the cast members of "The Expendables 3" arriving at the Cannes Film Festival on tanks.
- The cast members mentioned include Sylvester Stallone, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Dolph Lundgren, Jason Statham, Harrison Ford, Mel Gibson, Antonio Banderas, Wesley Snipes, and Kelsey Grammer.

Reasoning:
Based on the context provided in the passage, the missing word in the query is likely "Expendables" or "Expendables 3" cast members.

Final answer:
The missing word in the query is "Expendables".
The complete query with the missing word filled in would be:
"The quip-fest began and while Arnie, Sly and Mel couldn't resist a few jokey punches and strangleholds, the Expendables crew mostly contented themselves with trading punchlines instead."
