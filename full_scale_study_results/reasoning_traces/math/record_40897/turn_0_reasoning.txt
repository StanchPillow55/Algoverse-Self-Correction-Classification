==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine the missing word in the query.

Given information:
- The passage mentions a "who's-who of action heroes" arriving in Cannes on tanks, including Sylvester Stallone, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Dolph Lundgren, Jason Statham, Harrison Ford, Mel Gibson, Antonio Banderas, Wesley Snipes, and Kelsey Grammer.
- The query mentions that the "quip-fest began and while Arnie, Sly and Mel couldn't resist a few jokey punches and strangleholds, the @placeholder crew mostly contented themselves with trading punchlines instead."

Based on the context, the missing word in the query is likely to be the word that refers to the group of action heroes mentioned in the passage.

Possible answers:
1. The Expendables crew
2. The action heroes
3. The cast

Let's evaluate each option:

1. The Expendables crew:
   - This option is the most likely answer, as the passage mentions that the event was to promote the upcoming blockbuster "The Expendables 3".
