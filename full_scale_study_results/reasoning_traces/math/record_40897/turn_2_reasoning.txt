Question ID: record_40897
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, I will need to determine the missing word in the query. Based on the context provided in the passage, the most likely word to fill the @placeholder is "Expendables 3".

Reasoning:
1. The passage discusses the cast members of "The Expendables 3" arriving at the Cannes Film Festival on tanks to promote the upcoming blockbuster.
2. The query mentions the "Expendables 3 crew" trading punchlines, indicating that the missing word is likely referring to the cast of that film.
3. The passage also mentions several of the main actors in "The Expendables 3" by name, including Sylvester Stallone, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Dolph Lundgren, Jason Statham, Harrison Ford, Mel Gibson, and Antonio Banderas.

Therefore, the final answer to the query is:

The quip-fest began and while Arnie, Sly and Mel couldn't resist a few jokey punches and strangleholds, the Expendables 3 crew mostly contented themselves with trading punchlines instead.
