Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to determine how many slices Bill and Mark received. 

Bill received 1/3 of the pizza. Since the pizza has 12 slices, we calculate 1/3 of 12 to find out how many slices Bill received. 

1/3 * 12 = 4 slices

Mark received 1/4 of the pizza. Similarly, we calculate 1/4 of 12 to find out how many slices Mark received.

1/4 * 12 = 3 slices

So, Bill received 4 slices and Mark received 3 slices. 

Next, we need to subtract the slices that Bill, Mark, and Jenny ate from the total number of slices. 

The total number of slices eaten is 4 (Bill) + 3 (Mark) + 2 (Jenny) = 9 slices

The pizza originally had 12 slices, so we subtract the 9 slices that were eaten from 12.

12 - 9 = 3 slices

Therefore, there are 3 slices left.
