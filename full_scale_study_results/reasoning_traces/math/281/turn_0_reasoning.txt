Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to find out how many spots a mamba has. Since a cobra has twice as many spots as a mamba, and a cobra has 70 spots, a mamba has 70/2 = 35 spots.

Next, we need to find out how many spots all the cobras in the park have combined. Since there are 40 cobras and each cobra has 70 spots, the total number of spots on all the cobras is 40*70 = 2800 spots.

Similarly, we need to find out how many spots all the mambas in the park have combined. Since there are 60 mambas and each mamba has 35 spots, the total number of spots on all the mambas is 60*35 = 2100 spots.

To find the total number of spots on all the snakes in the park, we add the total number of spots on the cobras to the total number of spots on the mambas. This gives us 2800 + 2100 = 4900 spots.

Finally, we need to find half the total number of spots. Half of 4900 is 4900/2 = 2450 spots.

So, half the number of spots all the snakes in the park have combined is 2450 spots.
