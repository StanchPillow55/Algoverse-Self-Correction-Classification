To solve this problem, we need to extract the relevant information from the given paragraph and perform the necessary calculations.

Given information:
- Francesco Totti set a new Serie A scoring record on Saturday.
- Totti has scored a total of 211 goals for Roma.
- The previous record was 210 goals, set by Gunnar Nordahl for AC Milan in the 1950s.
