Dataset Type: math
==================================================

The news website publishes an average of 20 articles every day. So, in February, which has 28 days, the total number of articles published by the news website is 20 articles/day * 28 days = 560 articles.

The sister company publishes an average of 10 articles every day. So, in February, the total number of articles published by the sister company is 10 articles/day * 28 days = 280 articles.

To find the total number of articles published by both websites in February, we add the two totals together: 560 articles + 280 articles = 840 articles.

So, the two websites published a total of 840 articles in February.
