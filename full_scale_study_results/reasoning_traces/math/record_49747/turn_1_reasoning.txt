Question ID: record_49747
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to fill in the missing information in the query. The passage mentions that Quincy Jones moved to Seattle as a child, so the missing location in the query is likely Seattle.

Here is the complete reasoning and work:

Given information:
- Quincy Jones was born in Chicago and moved to Seattle as a child.
- The query states that "perhaps because of his own upbringing in tough neighborhoods in Chicago and Seattle, Jones has long been involved in social activism."

Step 1: Identify the missing information in the query.
The missing location in the query is Seattle.

Step 2: Rewrite the query with the missing information filled in.
Perhaps because of his own upbringing in tough neighborhoods in Chicago and Seattle, Jones has long been involved in social activism.

Step 3: Provide the final answer.
The final answer is:
Perhaps because of his own upbringing in tough neighborhoods in Chicago and Seattle, Jones has long been involved in social activism.
