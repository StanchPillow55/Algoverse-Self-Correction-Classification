Question ID: record_49747
Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to fill in the missing information in the query. The passage mentions that Quincy Jones moved to Seattle as a child, so the missing location in the query is likely Seattle.

Here's the complete reasoning and work:

Given information:
- Quincy Jones was born in Chicago.
- He moved to Seattle as a child.
- He has been involved in social activism, perhaps because of his own upbringing in tough neighborhoods in Chicago and Seattle.

Query: Perhaps because of his own upbringing in tough neighborhoods in Chicago and Seattle, Jones has long been involved in social activism.

The final answer is:
Perhaps because of his own upbringing in tough neighborhoods in Chicago and Seattle, Jones has long been involved in social activism.
