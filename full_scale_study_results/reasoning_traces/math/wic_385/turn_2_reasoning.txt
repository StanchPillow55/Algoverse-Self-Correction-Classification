==================================================

To determine if the word 'raise' is used with the same meaning in both sentences, we need to analyze the context and usage of the word in each sentence.

Sentence 1: "We visited a farm where they raise chickens."
In this sentence, the word 'raise' is used to indicate the act of breeding, growing, or producing chickens on the farm.

Sentence 2: "A few important questions were raised after the attack."
In this sentence, the word 'raise' is used to indicate the act of bringing up or introducing a topic or issue, in this case, the important questions.

Based on the analysis, the word 'raise' is not used with the same meaning in both sentences. In the first sentence, it refers to the act of breeding or producing chickens, while in the second sentence, it refers to the act of bringing up or introducing questions.

Therefore, the answer is:
No, the word 'raise' is not used with the same meaning in both sentences.
