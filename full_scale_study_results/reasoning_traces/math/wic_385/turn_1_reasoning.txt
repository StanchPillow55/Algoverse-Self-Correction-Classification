Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To determine if the word 'raise' is used with the same meaning in both sentences, we need to analyze the context and the meaning of the word in each sentence.

Sentence 1: "We visited a farm where they raise chickens."
In this sentence, the word 'raise' is used to mean the act of breeding, growing, or nurturing chickens on the farm.

Sentence 2: "A few important questions were raised after the attack."
In this sentence, the word 'raised' is used to mean the act of bringing up or introducing a particular issue or topic for discussion.

Therefore, the word 'raise' is not used with the same meaning in both sentences. In the first sentence, it refers to the act of breeding or growing chickens, while in the second sentence, it refers to the act of bringing up or introducing questions.

Final answer: No, the word 'raise' is not used with the same meaning in both sentences.
