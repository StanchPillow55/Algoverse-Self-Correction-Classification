==================================================

To determine if the word "raise" is used with the same meaning in both sentences, we need to analyze the context and the meaning of the word in each sentence.

Sentence 1: "We visited a farm where they raise chickens."
In this sentence, the word "raise" is used to mean "to breed or grow" chickens on the farm.

Sentence 2: "A few important questions were raised after the attack."
In this sentence, the word "raised" is used to mean "to bring up" or "to introduce" the questions after the attack.

Analyzing the two usages of the word "raise":
1. In the first sentence, "raise" is used in the context of animal husbandry, referring to the act of breeding or growing chickens on the farm.
2. In the second sentence, "raised" is used in the context of discussion or conversation, referring to the act of bringing up or introducing questions.

Therefore, the word "raise" is not used with the same meaning in both sentences. The meanings are different, one referring to the breeding/growing of chickens, and the other referring to the introduction of questions.

Final answer:
