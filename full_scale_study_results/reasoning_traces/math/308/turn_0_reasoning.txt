==================================================

First, let's calculate how much you save on each tub of ice cream. The original price was $13 and it's now sold for $11. So, you save $13 - $11 = $2 on each tub of ice cream.

If you buy 2 tubs of ice cream, you will save 2 * $2 = $4.

Next, let's calculate how much you save on each packet of milk. The discount on each packet of milk is $0.5.

If you buy 4 packets of milk, you will save 4 * $0.5 = $2.

So, if you buy 2 tubs of ice cream and 4 packets of milk, you will save $4 (from the ice cream) + $2 (from the milk) = $6 in total.

Therefore, the final answer is $6.
