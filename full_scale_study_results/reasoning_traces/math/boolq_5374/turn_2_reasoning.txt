Question ID: boolq_5374
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To determine if the Los Angeles Clippers have ever been to the NBA Finals, I will go through the information provided in the context step-by-step:

1. The context states that the Clippers have qualified for the playoffs 13 times, most recently in the 2016-17 season.
2. It also states that the Clippers have passed the first round of the playoffs 5 times (1975-76, 2005-06, 2011-12, 2013-14, and 2014-15).
3. However, the context explicitly states that the Clippers "have never won league or Conference titles, let alone play in either title game in their 45-year history."
4. It also states that the Clippers "have never been to a Western Conference Finals."

Based on this information, the answer is clear:
The Los Angeles Clippers have never been to the NBA Finals.

The context provided does not indicate that the Clippers have ever reached the NBA Finals or played in a championship series. In fact, it states that they have never won a league or conference title, nor have they ever played in a title game.
