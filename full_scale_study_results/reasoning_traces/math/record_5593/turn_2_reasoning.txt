Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to find the value of the placeholder in the given passage.

Given information:
- The passage mentions that the first stage of the unmanned rocket made it to the platform, but the booster came down too hard and broke apart.

Based on the context, the placeholder in the passage is likely referring to the type of rocket used by SpaceX, which is the Falcon 9 rocket.

Therefore, the complete sentence would be:

"However, the first stage of the unmanned Falcon 9 rocket made it to the platform, but the booster came down too hard and broke apart."

The final answer is that the placeholder is "Falcon 9".
