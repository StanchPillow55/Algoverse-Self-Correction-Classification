==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to understand the context and the information provided in the passage, and then use logical reasoning to determine the missing word in the query.

Given information:
- The passage mentions that SpaceX may have failed in its Falcon 9 landing at the weekend.
- The query states that the first stage of the unmanned @placeholder rocket made it to the platform, but the booster came down too hard and broke apart.

Based on the information provided, the missing word in the query is likely to be "Falcon 9", as the passage mentions that SpaceX's Falcon 9 rocket had a failed landing.

Therefore, the complete query would be:

"However, the first stage of the unmanned Falcon 9 rocket made it to the platform, but the booster came down too hard and broke apart."

This aligns with the information provided in the passage about SpaceX's failed Falcon 9 landing.
