Question ID: 1119
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine the time each person took to complete their respective chores and then sum these times to find the total time spent on chores by Amalia, Megan, and Dior.

1. **Amalia's Time:**
   - Amalia mowed the lawn, which took her 4 hours.

2. **Megan's Time:**
   - Megan walked the dog, and it took her 2 hours longer than Amalia.
   - Since Amalia took 4 hours, Megan took \(4 + 2 = 6\) hours.

3. **Dior's Time:**
   - Dior did the laundry, and it took her well over 4 hours longer than Amalia.
   - "Well over" suggests a significant amount more than 4 hours, but since the problem does not specify an exact time, we need to make a reasonable assumption. For the sake of this problem, let's assume "well over" means at least 5 hours more.
   - Therefore, Dior took \(4 + 5 = 9\) hours or more. However, without a specific number, we will use 9 hours as a conservative estimate for calculation purposes.

4. **Total Time Calculation:**
   - Add the time each person took:
   \[
   \text{Total Time} = \text{Amalia's Time} + \text{Megan's Time} + \text{Dior's Time}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total Time} = 4 \text{ hours} + 6 \text{ hours} + 9 \text{ hours} = 19 \text{ hours}
   \]

Thus, the total time they all took to do their chores altogether is 19 hours.

**Final Answer: 19 hours**
