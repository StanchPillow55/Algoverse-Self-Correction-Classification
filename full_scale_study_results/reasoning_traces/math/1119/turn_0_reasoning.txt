Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

Amalia took 4 hours to mow the lawn.

Megan took 2 hours longer than Amalia to walk the dog, which means she took 4 hours + 2 hours = <<4+2=6>>6 hours.

Dior took 4 hours longer than Amalia to do the laundry, which means she took 4 hours + 4 hours = <<4+4=8>>8 hours.

Altogether, they took 4 hours (Amalia) + 6 hours (Megan) + 8 hours (Dior) = <<4+6+8=18>>18 hours to do their chores. 

So, the total time they all took to do their chores is 18 hours.
