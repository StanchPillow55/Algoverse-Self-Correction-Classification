Question ID: 1119
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total time each person spent on their chores and then sum these times to find the total time they all took together.

1. **Amalia's Chore:**
   - Amalia mowed the lawn, which took her 4 hours.

2. **Megan's Chore:**
   - Megan walked the dog, and it took her 2 hours longer than Amalia. 
   - Since Amalia took 4 hours, Megan took \(4 + 2 = 6\) hours.

3. **Dior's Chore:**
   - Dior did the laundry, and it took her well over 4 hours longer than Amalia.
   - The phrase "well over" suggests that Dior took significantly more than 4 hours longer than Amalia. However, without a specific number, we can only assume a minimum of 5 hours longer to account for "well over."
   - Therefore, Dior took at least \(4 + 5 = 9\) hours. 

   Since the problem doesn't specify exactly how much longer Dior took, we will use 9 hours as a reasonable estimate based on the phrase "well over."

4. **Total Time Calculation:**
   - Amalia's time: 4 hours
   - Megan's time: 6 hours
   - Dior's time: 9 hours (as a reasonable estimate)
   - Total time = Amalia's time + Megan's time + Dior's time
   - Total time = \(4 + 6 + 9 = 19\) hours

Therefore, the total time they all took to do their chores altogether is 19 hours.

**Final Answer: 19 hours**
