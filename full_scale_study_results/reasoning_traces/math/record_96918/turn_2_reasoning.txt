Question ID: record_96918
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine the meaning of the given statement and provide a reasonable answer.

The statement suggests that for the last four years, Vladimir Putin has been making all key decisions, with someone's advice, and he will continue to do so. The placeholder "@placeholder" represents the name of the person whose advice Putin has been seeking.

Given the context of the passage, which discusses the upcoming Russian presidential election, the most reasonable inference is that the "@placeholder" refers to Dmitry Medvedev, the outgoing president of Russia.

Therefore, the final answer would be:

"For the last four years, he has made all key decisions, with Dmitry Medvedev's advice, and he will continue to do so."
