==================================================

I apologize, but I do not see a clear mathematical problem or question in the provided passage. The passage appears to be a sports news article describing a football match between Blyth Spartans and Birmingham City in the FA Cup. There are no numerical values or mathematical operations mentioned that I can use to solve a specific math problem.

If you have a more explicit math-related question that you would like me to solve, please provide it, and I will be happy to work through the problem step-by-step, showing my reasoning and calculations to arrive at the final answer. Without a clear mathematical question or problem statement, I am unable to demonstrate my math problem-solving abilities in this case. Please let me know if you have a different question for me.
