==================================================

Unfortunately, there is no mathematical problem or calculation to solve in the given passage. The passage is a sports news article about a football (soccer) match between Blyth Spartans and Birmingham City in the FA Cup. 

The query "Without that stop @placeholder's confidence would have been irreversibly sapped" does not seem to be directly related to the content of the passage. It appears to be a separate statement or question that is not connected to the math problem-solving request.

As an AI assistant, I do not have the capability to solve problems or provide answers that are not directly based on the information provided in the question. Without a clear mathematical problem statement, I cannot demonstrate any step-by-step reasoning or calculations. I apologize that I cannot provide a complete solution for this request.
