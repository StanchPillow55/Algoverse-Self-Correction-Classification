==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to identify the player being referred to in the query and then provide the relevant information about their performance.

Given information:
- The player wins 75% of their tackles.
- The player has made the third-most clearances in the Premier League (186).

Based on the information provided in the passage, the player being referred to is likely Winston Reid from West Ham.

Step 1: Verify that Winston Reid matches the given information.
- The passage mentions that "West Ham's Winston Reid are among those, and here's why they ought to leave."
- The passage also states that "West Ham ace Winston Reid has been linked with a move to Arsenal."

Step 2: Calculate the percentage of tackles won by Winston Reid.
The passage does not provide the exact number of tackles made by Winston Reid, but it states that he "wins 75 per cent of his tackles."

Therefore, the final answer is:
Winston Reid wins 75% of his tackles and has made the third-most clearances in the Premier League (186).
