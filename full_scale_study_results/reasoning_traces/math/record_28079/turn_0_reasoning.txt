To solve this problem, we need to analyze the information provided in the passage and determine which player the query is referring to.

Given information:
- The passage mentions three players who "should be looking for the exit door themselves": Saido Berahino (West Bromwich Albion), Moussa Sissoko (Newcastle United), and Winston Reid (West Ham).
- The query states that the player "wins 75 per cent of his tackles and has made the third-most clearances in the Premier League (186)."

Based on the information provided, the player being referred to in the query is Winston Reid from West Ham.

Step 1: Verify that Winston Reid matches the criteria given in the query.
- The passage states that Winston Reid "has been linked with a move to Arsenal," indicating that he is a West Ham player.
- The query states that the player "wins 75 per cent of his tackles and has made the third-most clearances in the Premier League (186)." This matches the description of Winston Reid.

Step 2: Provide the final answer.
The player being referred to in the query is Winston Reid from West Ham.
