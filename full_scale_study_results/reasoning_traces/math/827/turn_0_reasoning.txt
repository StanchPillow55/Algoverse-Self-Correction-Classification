Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to calculate the cost of shipping the book back to the distribution center. The shipping company charges $0.35 per pound and $0.08 per mile. 

The cost of shipping based on the weight of the book is 4 pounds * $0.35/pound = $1.40.

The cost of shipping based on the distance to the distribution center is 20 miles * $0.08/mile = $1.60.

So, the total cost of shipping is $1.40 (weight) + $1.60 (distance) = $3.00.

Next, we need to calculate how much money Milly will get back from Amazon. Amazon will refund 75% of the book's purchase price, which is $32 * 75% = $24. 

So, Milly will lose the cost of shipping ($3.00) plus the amount of the purchase price that Amazon won't refund ($32 - $24 = $8).

Therefore, Milly will lose $3.00 (shipping) + $8.00 (non-refunded amount) = $11.00.

So, Milly will lose $11.00.
