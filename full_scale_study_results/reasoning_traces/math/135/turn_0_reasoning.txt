==================================================

First, we need to determine how many video games Brian has after he lost 5. 

Brian originally had 20 video games, so after losing 5, he now has 20 - 5 = <<20-5=15>>15 video games.

The problem states that Bobby has 5 fewer than 3 times as many video games as Brian does. So, we need to multiply Brian's current number of video games by 3, which is 15 * 3 = <<15*3=45>>45.

However, Bobby has 5 fewer than this amount, so we subtract 5 from 45 to find out how many video games Bobby has. 

So, Bobby has 45 - 5 = <<45-5=40>>40 video games.

Therefore, Bobby has 40 video games.
