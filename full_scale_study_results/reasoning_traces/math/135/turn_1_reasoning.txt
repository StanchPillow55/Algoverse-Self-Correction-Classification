Question ID: 135
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

Step 1: Determine the number of video games Brian has after losing some.

Brian initially had 20 video games, but he lost 5. So, we subtract 5 from 20 to find out how many he has now.

20 - 5 = 15

So, Brian has 15 video games.

Step 2: Determine how many video games Bobby has.

The problem states that Bobby has 5 fewer than 3 times as many video games as Brian does. So, we first multiply the number of video games Brian has by 3.

15 * 3 = 45

Then, we subtract 5 from this number to find out how many video games Bobby has.

45 - 5 = 40

So, Bobby has 40 video games.

Therefore, the final answer is that Bobby has 40 video games.
