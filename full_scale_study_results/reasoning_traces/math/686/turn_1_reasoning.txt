Question ID: 686
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

Step 1: Determine how many cookies Celinda bakes
Since Celinda bakes twice as many cookies as Greta, we multiply Greta's total by 2.
30 cookies * 2 = 60 cookies

Step 2: Determine the total number of cookies baked
We add Greta's total to Celinda's total to find the total number of cookies baked.
30 cookies (Greta's total) + 60 cookies (Celinda's total) = 90 cookies

Step 3: Determine how many cookies are left after they eat some
We subtract the number of cookies eaten from the total number of cookies baked.
90 cookies - 10 cookies eaten = 80 cookies

So, there are 80 cookies in the box.
