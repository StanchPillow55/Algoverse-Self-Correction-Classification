Question ID: 686
Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to find out how many cookies Celinda baked. Since we know that Celinda baked twice as many cookies as Greta, we can calculate this by multiplying the number of cookies Greta baked by 2. 

Greta's cookies: 30
Celinda's cookies: 30 * 2 = 60

Next, we add together the number of cookies Greta and Celinda baked to find the total number of cookies.

Total cookies: 30 (Greta's) + 60 (Celinda's) = 90 cookies

Then, we subtract the number of cookies they ate while they were cooling from the total number of cookies to find out how many cookies are left.

Cookies left: 90 (total) - 10 (eaten) = 80 cookies

So, there are 80 cookies in the box.

Final Answer: There are 80 cookies in the box.
