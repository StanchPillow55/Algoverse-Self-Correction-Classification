Question ID: 686
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

Step 1: Determine how many cookies Celinda bakes.
Since we know that Celinda bakes twice as many cookies as Greta, we can calculate the number of cookies Celinda bakes by multiplying the number of cookies Greta bakes by 2. 

Greta's cookies = 30
Celinda's cookies = 2 * Greta's cookies = 2 * 30 = 60 cookies

Step 2: Determine the total number of cookies baked.
We can find the total number of cookies baked by adding the number of cookies Greta baked to the number of cookies Celinda baked.

Total cookies = Greta's cookies + Celinda's cookies = 30 + 60 = 90 cookies

Step 3: Determine how many cookies are left after they eat some.
We know that Greta and Celinda eat 10 of the cookies while they are cooling. We can find out how many cookies are left by subtracting the number of cookies eaten from the total number of cookies baked.

Cookies in the box = Total cookies - Cookies eaten = 90 - 10 = 80 cookies

So, there are 80 cookies in the box.
