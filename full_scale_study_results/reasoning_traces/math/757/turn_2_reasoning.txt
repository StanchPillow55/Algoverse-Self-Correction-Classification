Question ID: 757
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we know that 11 students need size extra-small.

Second, twice as many students need size small as extra small. Since we know that 11 students need size extra-small, we can multiply this number by 2 to find out how many students need size small. 

11 * 2 = 22 students need size small.

Third, four less than the number of size small students need size medium. Since we know that 22 students need size small, we can subtract 4 from this number to find out how many students need size medium.

22 - 4 = 18 students need size medium.

Fourth, half as many students need size large as size medium. Since we know that 18 students need size medium, we can divide this number by 2 to find out how many students need size large.

18 / 2 = 9 students need size large.

Finally, six more students need size extra-large than large. Since we know that 9 students need size large, we can add 6 to this number to find out how many students need size extra-large.

9 + 6 = 15 students need size extra-large.

To find out how many shirts Krissa ordered altogether, we can add up the number of students who need each size.

11 (extra-small) + 22 (small) + 18 (medium) + 9 (large) + 15 (extra-large) = 75 shirts

So, Krissa ordered 75 shirts in total.
