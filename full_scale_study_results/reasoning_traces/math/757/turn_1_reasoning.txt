Question ID: 757
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. We know that 11 students need size extra-small.

2. Twice as many students need size small as extra small. So, the number of small shirts needed is 2 * 11 = 22.

3. Four less than the number of size small students need size medium. So, the number of medium shirts needed is 22 - 4 = 18.

4. Half as many students need size large as size medium. So, the number of large shirts needed is 18 / 2 = 9.

5. Six more students need size extra-large than large. So, the number of extra-large shirts needed is 9 + 6 = 15.

Now, to find the total number of shirts Krissa needs to order, we add up the number of shirts needed in each size:

11 (extra-small) + 22 (small) + 18 (medium) + 9 (large) + 15 (extra-large) = 75 shirts.

So, Krissa needs to order 75 shirts in total.
