==================================================

To solve this problem, I will break it down step-by-step:

1. Identify the key information given in the passage:
   - Jordan Belfort, played by Leonardo DiCaprio in the movie "The Wolf of Wall Street", described the moment he realized he was selling a scam and cheating innocent people out of millions of dollars.
   - Belfort said this realization came about a month into his wheeling and dealing and debauched life of 1990s excess.
   - Belfort, who is now a motivational speaker, spent more than 100 hours helping DiCaprio prepare for the role.
   - Belfort insisted that 95% of what he did was legal, but the 5% that was illegal was "incredibly destructive and it poisoned everything."
   - The passage states that Belfort "praised @placeholder, pictured in the movie, for making the film what he calls a cautionary tale rather than glorifying the excessive behavior, as many critics have claimed the film does."

2. Identify the missing information:
   - The passage does not explicitly state the name of the "@placeholder" that Belfort praised for making
