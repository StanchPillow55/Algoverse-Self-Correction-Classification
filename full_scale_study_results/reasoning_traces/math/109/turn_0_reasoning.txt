==================================================

First, let's calculate the total cost of the gas before the cashback. 

The gas station is selling gas for $3.00 a gallon and someone is buying 10 gallons. So, the total cost would be $3.00/gallon * 10 gallons = $30.00.

Next, let's calculate the total cashback. 

The app company is offering $0.20 cashback per gallon and someone is buying 10 gallons. So, the total cashback would be $0.20/gallon * 10 gallons = $2.00.

Finally, let's subtract the total cashback from the total cost of the gas to find out how much the gas will be after the cashback rewards. 

The total cost of the gas is $30.00 and the total cashback is $2.00. So, the cost of the gas after the cashback rewards would be $30.00 - $2.00 = $28.00.

Therefore, after the cashback rewards, the cost of the gas will be $28.00.
