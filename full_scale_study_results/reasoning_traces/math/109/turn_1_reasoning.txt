To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of purchasing 10 gallons of gas at the given price, and then determine the amount of cashback received. Finally, we subtract the cashback from the total cost to find the final cost after cashback.

**Step 1: Calculate the total cost of 10 gallons of gas.**

The price of gas is $3.00 per gallon. Therefore, for 10 gallons, the total cost is calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Total cost} = \text{Price per gallon} \times \text{Number of gallons} = 3.00 \times 10 = 30.00
\]

So, the total cost for 10 gallons of gas is $30.00.

**Step 2: Calculate the cashback received.**

The cashback offer is $0.20 per gallon. Therefore, for 10 gallons, the cashback is calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Cashback} = \text{Cashback per gallon} \times \text{Number of gallons} = 0.20 \times 10 = 2.00
\]

So, the total cashback received is $2.00.

**Step 3: Calculate the final cost after cashback.**

To find the final cost after receiving the cashback, we subtract the cashback from the total cost:

\[
\text{Final cost} = \text{Total cost} - \text{Cashback} = 30.00 - 2.00 = 28.00
\]

Therefore, the final cost of the gas after the cashback rewards is $28.00.

**Final Answer:**

The final cost of the gas after the cashback rewards is $28.00.
