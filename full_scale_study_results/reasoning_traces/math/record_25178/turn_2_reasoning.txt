Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, I will analyze the given passage and the query to determine the appropriate placeholder and provide a final answer.

Given information:
- The passage describes a shooting incident at the Jewish Museum in Brussels, where three visitors were killed by suspected anti-Semitic gunmen.
- The query states: "It's not a coincidence the target was a @placeholder museum."

Reasoning:
Based on the information provided in the passage, the target of the attack was the Jewish Museum in Brussels. The passage clearly states that the shooting took place at the Jewish Museum, and the attack is described as an "act of anti-Semitism."

Therefore, the appropriate placeholder in the query would be "Jewish."

Final answer:
"It's not a coincidence the target was a Jewish museum."
