Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To find the average score of John's tests, we need to add up all his scores and then divide by the number of tests he took.

John scored 100 on his first 3 tests, so the total for these 3 tests is 100 * 3 = 300.

He scored 80 on his 4th test.

So, the total score for all 4 tests is 300 (from the first 3 tests) + 80 (from the 4th test) = 380.

He took 4 tests in total.

So, his average score is the total score divided by the number of tests, which is 380 / 4 = 95.

Therefore, John's average score across the 4 tests is 95.
