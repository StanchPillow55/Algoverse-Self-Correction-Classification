To solve this problem, we need to find the year when the report showing a 6% year-over-year increase in the number of reported sexual assault cases within the military was released.

Given information:
- Lt. Col. Jeffrey Krusinski was arrested in May.
- The arrest came two days before the report was released.

Step 1: Determine the year when the report was released.
Since the report showed a 6% year-over-year increase in the number of reported sexual assault cases within the military in the fiscal year that ended September 30, 2012, the report was likely released in the following fiscal year, which would be the fiscal year 2013.

Step 2: Determine the year when the report was released.
The fiscal year 2013 runs from October 1, 2012, to September 30, 2013.
Since the arrest happened in May, and the report was released two days after the arrest, the report was likely released in May 2013.

Therefore, the final answer is:
The report showing a 6% year-over-year increase in the number of reported sexual assault cases within the military was released in
