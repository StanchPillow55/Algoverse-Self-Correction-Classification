Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to find the year when the report showing a 6% year-over-year increase in the number of reported sexual assault cases within the military was released.

Given information:
- Lt. Col. Jeffrey Krusinski was arrested in May.
- The arrest came two days before the report was released.

Step 1: Determine the fiscal year that ended on September 30, 2012.
The fiscal year in the United States runs from October 1 to September 30.
Therefore, the fiscal year that ended on September 30, 2012, is the 2012 fiscal year.

Step 2: Determine the year when the report was released.
The report was released two days after Krusinski's arrest in May.
Since the arrest happened in May, the report was likely released in May 2013.

Therefore, the year when the report showing a 6% year-over-year increase in the number of reported sexual assault cases within the military was released is 2013.

Final answer: The year when the report was released is 2013.
