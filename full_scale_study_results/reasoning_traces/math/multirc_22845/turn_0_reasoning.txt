To determine why the Carthaginians wanted Ibiza, we need to analyze the information provided in the paragraph. The key points are:

1. Ibiza's location between Africa and ancient Iberia made it a convenient stopover for Mediterranean seafarers, including the Phoenician traders.
2. The Carthaginians originally came from the area comprising present-day Lebanon and challenged the Roman Empire for domination of the Mediterranean region.
3. The Carthaginians' interest in Ibiza lay partly in its vast salt flats, which they used to cure fish for export to their home country.
4. The Carthaginians also carried out lead mining on Ibiza and believed the island to be a holy place, where they buried thousands of their citizens in a huge necropolis.

Based on the information provided, the Carthaginians were interested in Ibiza for the following reasons:

1. Strategic location: Ibiza's location between Africa and ancient Iberia made it a convenient stopover for Mediterranean seafarers, which would have been valuable for the Carthaginians as they challenged the Roman Empire for control of the region.

2. Natural resources: Ibiza
