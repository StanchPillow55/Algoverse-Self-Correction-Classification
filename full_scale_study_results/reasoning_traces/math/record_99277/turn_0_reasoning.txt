==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine the location that is mentioned in the placeholder "@placeholder" based on the information provided in the passage.

Given information:
- The passage mentions that in Sydney, the weather remained sunny with a maximum temperature of 25 degrees.
- In Hobart, there was a blanket of snow, and northern Tasmanian suburbs braced for flooding.
- In Melbourne, a wintry front was predicted, and a huge storm cloud rolled in over the city in the afternoon.
- One person died in Launceston after a tree fell due to high winds.

Based on the information provided, the location mentioned in the placeholder "@placeholder" is most likely Melbourne.

The passage states that "in Melbourne, a wintry front was predicted, and a huge storm cloud rolled in over the city in the afternoon." This indicates that the clouds were starting to roll in early in Melbourne, as the passage mentions a "wintry front" and a "huge storm cloud" in the city.

Therefore, the final answer is:

Melbourne
