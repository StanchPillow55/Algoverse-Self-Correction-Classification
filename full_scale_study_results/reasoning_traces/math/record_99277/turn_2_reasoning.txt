Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine the location that is mentioned in the placeholder "@placeholder" in the given query.

Based on the information provided in the passage, the location that is mentioned in the placeholder "@placeholder" is Melbourne.

The passage states that "Melbourne braced for a wintry front and wild storms lashed out in the country's south" and that "A huge storm cloud rolled in over Melbourne's CBD on Thursday afternoon with a wintry front predicted for the city."

Therefore, the complete query would be:

"Down in Melbourne the clouds were starting to roll in early as potentially damaging winds and a cold front was expected."

To solve this problem, we need to show the complete reasoning and work.

Given information:
- The passage mentions that a wintry front and wild storms were expected in Melbourne.
- The passage also states that a huge storm cloud rolled in over Melbourne's CBD on Thursday afternoon.

Reasoning:
1. The passage indicates that Melbourne was expecting a wintry front and potentially damaging winds.
2. The passage also mentions that a huge storm cloud rolled in over Melbourne's CBD, suggesting that the clouds were starting to roll in early.
3. Therefore
