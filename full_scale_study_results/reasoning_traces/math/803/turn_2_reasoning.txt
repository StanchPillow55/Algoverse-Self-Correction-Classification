Question ID: 803
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of hours Kris has already played and then determine how many more hours she needs to play to reach a total of 30 hours.

**Step 1: Calculate the hours played in the first 2 weeks.**

Kris plays for half an hour every day for 2 weeks. 

- There are 7 days in a week, so 2 weeks have:
  \[
  2 \times 7 = 14 \text{ days}
  \]

- Playing for half an hour each day for 14 days means:
  \[
  0.5 \times 14 = 7 \text{ hours}
  \]

**Step 2: Calculate the hours played in the next week.**

Kris plays for 2 hours every day for 1 week.

- There are 7 days in a week, so:
  \[
  2 \times 7 = 14 \text{ hours}
  \]

**Step 3: Calculate the total hours played.**

Add the hours from the first 2 weeks and the next week:
\[
7 + 14 = 21 \text{ hours}
\]

**Step 4: Determine how many more hours Kris needs to play.**

Kris needs a total of 30 hours to earn the achievement. She has already played 21 hours, so she needs:
\[
30 - 21 = 9 \text{ hours}
\]

Therefore, Kris still needs to play **9 more hours** to earn the video game achievement.
