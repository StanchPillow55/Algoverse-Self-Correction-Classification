Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To determine how many more hours Kris needs to play to reach a total of 30 hours, we need to calculate the total hours she has already played and then subtract that from 30.

**Step 1: Calculate the hours played in the first 2 weeks.**

Kris plays for half an hour every day for 2 weeks. There are 7 days in a week, so in 2 weeks, there are:
\[ 2 \times 7 = 14 \text{ days} \]

Each day, Kris plays for half an hour, so in 14 days, she plays:
\[ 14 \times 0.5 = 7 \text{ hours} \]

**Step 2: Calculate the hours played in the following week.**

Kris then plays for 2 hours every day for 1 week. In 1 week, there are 7 days, so she plays:
\[ 7 \times 2 = 14 \text{ hours} \]

**Step 3: Calculate the total hours played so far.**

Add the hours from the first 2 weeks and the following week:
\[ 7 \text{ hours} + 14 \text{ hours} = 21 \text{ hours} \]

**Step 4: Determine how many more hours Kris needs to play.**

Kris needs a total of 30 hours to earn the achievement. She has already played 21 hours, so the remaining hours she needs to play are:
\[ 30 - 21 = 9 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, Kris still needs to play **9 more hours** to earn the video game achievement.
