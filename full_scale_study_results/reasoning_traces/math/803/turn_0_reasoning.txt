Question ID: 803
Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, let's calculate how many hours Kris plays in the first two weeks. Since there are 7 days in a week, and she plays half an hour each day, she plays 7 * 0.5 = 3.5 hours in a week. Since she does this for 2 weeks, she plays 2 * 3.5 = 7 hours in the first two weeks.

Next, let's calculate how many hours Kris plays in the third week. Since she plays 2 hours each day for 7 days, she plays 2 * 7 = 14 hours in the third week.

Adding these together, Kris plays a total of 7 + 14 = 21 hours in the three weeks.

Since the achievement requires 30 hours of play, and she has played 21 hours, Kris still needs to play 30 - 21 = 9 hours to earn the achievement.

So, Kris still needs to play 9 hours to earn the video game achievement.
