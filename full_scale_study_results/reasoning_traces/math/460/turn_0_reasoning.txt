Grayson earns money from recycling aluminum cans and plastic bottles. Each aluminum can is worth two cents and each plastic bottle is worth three cents. 

First, let's calculate how much Grayson earns from recycling aluminum cans in a week. She drinks three cans a week, and each can is worth two cents. So, the total amount she earns from cans in a week is 3 cans * 2 cents/can = 6 cents.

Next, let's calculate how much Grayson earns from recycling plastic bottles in a week. She drinks five bottles a week, and each bottle is worth three cents. So, the total amount she earns from bottles in a week is 5 bottles * 3 cents/bottle = 15 cents.

Adding these two amounts together, Grayson earns 6 cents from cans + 15 cents from bottles = 21 cents in total each week.

Since there are four weeks in a month, the total amount Grayson earns in a month is 21 cents/week * 4 weeks/month = 84 cents/month.

So, Grayson earns 84 cents from recycling in a four-week month.
