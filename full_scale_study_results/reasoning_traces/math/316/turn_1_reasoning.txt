Question ID: 316
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of marbles Solomon has and then calculate their total weight. Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the number of marbles Solomon bought from Johanna:**
   - Solomon bought 20 marbles from Johanna.

2. **Determine the initial number of marbles in the store:**
   - The store initially had 50 marbles.

3. **Calculate the total number of marbles after adding those bought from Johanna:**
   - Total marbles after adding Johanna's: \( 50 + 20 = 70 \) marbles.

4. **Calculate the number of marbles given by Solomon's father:**
   - Solomon's father gave him \(\frac{2}{5}\) times as many marbles as he bought from Johanna.
   - Number of marbles from father: \(\frac{2}{5} \times 20 = \frac{40}{5} = 8\) marbles.

5. **Calculate the total number of marbles Solomon has now:**
   - Total marbles = Marbles in store + Marbles bought from Johanna + Marbles from father
   - Total marbles = \( 50 + 20 + 8 = 78 \) marbles.

6. **Calculate the total weight of the marbles:**
   - Each marble weighs 2 kg.
   - Total weight = Number of marbles \(\times\) Weight per marble
   - Total weight = \( 78 \times 2 = 156 \) kg.

Therefore, the total weight of the marbles Solomon has in the store is 156 kg.

**Final Answer: 156 kg**
