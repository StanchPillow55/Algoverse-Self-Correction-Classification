==================================================

To determine if the word "light" is used with the same meaning in both sentences, we need to analyze the context and usage of the word in each sentence.

Sentence 1: "He stepped into the light."
In this sentence, the word "light" is used to refer to a physical source of illumination, such as sunlight or artificial lighting. The person is stepping into an area that is illuminated, suggesting a literal interpretation of the word "light."

Sentence 2: "It brought the scandal to light."
In this sentence, the word "light" is used in a figurative sense, meaning to reveal or make something known. The phrase "to bring to light" is a common idiomatic expression that means to uncover or expose something that was previously hidden or unknown.

Analyzing the two sentences, we can see that the word "light" is not used with the same meaning in both cases. In the first sentence, it refers to a physical source of illumination, while in the second sentence, it is used figuratively to mean the act of revealing or exposing something.

Therefore, the answer is:
No, the word "light" is not used with the same meaning in both
