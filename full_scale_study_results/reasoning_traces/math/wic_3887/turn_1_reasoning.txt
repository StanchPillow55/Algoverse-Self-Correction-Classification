==================================================

To determine if the word 'light' is used with the same meaning in both sentences, we need to analyze the context and usage of the word in each sentence.

Sentence 1: "He stepped into the light."
In this sentence, the word 'light' is used to refer to a source of illumination or brightness. The person is stepping into an area that is lit or illuminated.

Sentence 2: "It brought the scandal to light."
In this sentence, the word 'light' is used to mean the state of being revealed or made known. The scandal is being brought out into the open or made public.

Based on the analysis, the word 'light' is not used with the same meaning in both sentences. In the first sentence, it refers to a physical source of illumination, while in the second sentence, it refers to the state of being revealed or made known.

Therefore, the answer is:
No, the word 'light' is not used with the same meaning in both sentences.
