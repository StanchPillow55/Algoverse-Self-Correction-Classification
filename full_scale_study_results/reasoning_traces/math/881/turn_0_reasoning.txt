==================================================

Let's denote Melanie's current age as x. 

From the problem, we know that in 10 years, Melanie will be 18 years old. So, we can write the equation:

x + 10 = 18

Solving this equation for x, we get:

x = 18 - 10
x = 8

So, Melanie is currently 8 years old.

We are asked to find out in how many years will her age be thrice her present age. Let's denote this number of years as y. 

We can write the equation:

x + y = 3x

Substituting x = 8 into this equation, we get:

8 + y = 3*8
8 + y = 24
y = 24 - 8
y = 16

So, in 16 years, Melanie's age will be thrice her present age. 

Final Answer: In 16 years, Melanie's age will be thrice her present age.
