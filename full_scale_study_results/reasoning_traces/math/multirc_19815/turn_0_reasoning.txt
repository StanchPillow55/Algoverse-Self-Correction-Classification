==================================================

To solve this problem, I will carefully read the given paragraph and extract the relevant information about Danny Lynch's children.

The paragraph states:
"Ria Lynch is married to Danny Lynch and they have a daughter and a son."

This clearly indicates that Danny Lynch has two children - a daughter and a son.

Therefore, the answer to the question "How many children does Danny Linch have?" is 2.
