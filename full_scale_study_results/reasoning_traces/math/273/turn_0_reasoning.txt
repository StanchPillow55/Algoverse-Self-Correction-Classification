Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, let's calculate the number of stitches Terri needs for the collar and the rosette. 

The collar takes a tenth of the number of stitches the body takes, so that's 900 / 10 = 90 stitches.

The rosette takes twice as many stitches as the collar, so that's 90 * 2 = 180 stitches.

So far, Terri has used 900 (for the body) + 90 (for the collar) + 180 (for the rosette) = 1170 stitches.

The whole sweater is an 1800-stitch project, so the two sleeves together take 1800 - 1170 = 630 stitches.

Since there are two sleeves, each sleeve takes 630 / 2 = 315 stitches.

So, each sleeve takes 315 stitches.
