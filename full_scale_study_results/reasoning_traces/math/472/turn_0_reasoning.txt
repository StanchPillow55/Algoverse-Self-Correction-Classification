==================================================

Let's denote the number of carrot sticks Matt has to eat as x. According to the problem, Matt can have half as many cookies as the number of carrot sticks he eats, plus two extra for cleaning his room. This can be written as the equation:

0.5x + 2 = 5

This equation represents the total number of cookies Matt can eat, which is given as 5. 

To solve for x, we first subtract 2 from both sides of the equation:

0.5x = 5 - 2
0.5x = 3

Then, to isolate x, we divide both sides of the equation by 0.5:

x = 3 / 0.5
x = 6

So, Matt has to eat 6 carrot sticks in order to have 5 cookies.
