Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

Let's solve this problem step by step.

First, we know that Raymond has 40 jewels.

According to the problem, Aaron has 5 more jewels than half of Raymond's jewels. So, we need to find half of Raymond's jewels and then add 5 to that number.

Half of Raymond's jewels is 40/2 = 20 jewels.

So, Aaron has 20 + 5 = 25 jewels.

The problem also tells us that Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron. So, we subtract 2 from the number of jewels Aaron has to find out how many jewels Siobhan has.

So, Siobhan has 25 - 2 = 23 jewels.

Therefore, Siobhan has 23 jewels.
