Question ID: 951
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to understand that the thickness of the book is directly proportional to the number of pages it contains. According to the problem, 100 pages of the book make up 1 inch of thickness. 

Given that the book is 1.5 inches thick, we can set up a proportion to find the total number of pages in the book. 

If 1 inch = 100 pages, then 1.5 inches = x pages.

We can solve for x by cross-multiplying:

1 * x = 1.5 * 100

Solving for x gives us:

x = 1.5 * 100 = 150 pages

Therefore, the book contains 150 pages.
