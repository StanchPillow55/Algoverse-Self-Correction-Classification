Question ID: 951
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

The problem tells us that the book is printed on paper that, when stacked, is 100 pages to the inch. This means that for every inch of thickness, there are 100 pages. 

The book is 1.5 inches thick. To find out how many pages are in the book, we need to multiply the thickness of the book by the number of pages per inch. 

So, we calculate 1.5 inches * 100 pages/inch. 

This calculation gives us the total number of pages in the book. 

1.5 inches * 100 pages/inch = 150 pages

Therefore, the book contains 150 pages.
