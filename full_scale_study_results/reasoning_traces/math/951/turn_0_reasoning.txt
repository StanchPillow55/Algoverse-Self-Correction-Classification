==================================================

The problem states that the book is printed on paper that, when stacked, is 100 pages to the inch. This means that for every inch of thickness, there are 100 pages. 

The book is 1.5 inches thick. To find the total number of pages in the book, we multiply the thickness of the book by the number of pages per inch. 

So, we have:

1.5 inches * 100 pages/inch = 150 pages

Therefore, there are 150 pages in the book.
