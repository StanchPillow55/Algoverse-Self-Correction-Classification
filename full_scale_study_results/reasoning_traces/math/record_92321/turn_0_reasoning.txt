==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to find the percentage of Romanian immigrants among all foreign national offenders in the UK, and compare it to the proportion of Romanian immigrants in the UK population.

Given information:
- Romanian immigrants account for more than 11% of all foreign national offenders in the UK.
- Romanian immigrants make up only a tiny proportion of UK residents.

Step 1: Understand the problem.
The problem is asking us to compare the percentage of Romanian immigrants among foreign national offenders to the proportion of Romanian immigrants in the UK population.

Step 2: Gather the necessary information.
We don't have the exact proportion of Romanian immigrants in the UK population, but we know that it is a "tiny proportion". This means the percentage is likely to be much lower than 11%.

Step 3: Perform the calculation.
Since Romanian immigrants account for more than 11% of all foreign national offenders, and they make up only a tiny proportion of the UK population, we can conclude that Romanian immigrants are overrepresented among foreign national offenders in the UK.

Step 4: State the final answer.
The final answer is that Romanian immigrants account for more than 11% of all
