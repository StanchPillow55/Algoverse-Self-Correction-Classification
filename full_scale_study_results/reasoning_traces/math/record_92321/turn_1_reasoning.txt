==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to find the percentage of Romanian immigrants among all foreign national offenders in the UK, and compare it to the proportion of Romanian immigrants in the UK population.

Given information:
- Romanian immigrants account for more than 11% of all foreign national offenders in the UK.
- Romanian immigrants make up only a tiny proportion of UK residents.

Step 1: Understand the problem.
The question is asking us to compare the percentage of Romanian immigrants among foreign national offenders to the proportion of Romanian immigrants in the UK population.

Step 2: Analyze the information provided.
The passage states that Romanian immigrants account for more than 11% of all foreign national offenders in the UK. However, it also states that they make up only a tiny proportion of UK residents.

Step 3: Provide the final answer.
Based on the information given, we can conclude that the percentage of Romanian immigrants among foreign national offenders (more than 11%) is significantly higher than the proportion of Romanian immigrants in the UK population (a tiny proportion).

Final answer: The percentage of Romanian immigrants among foreign national offenders (more than 11%) is significantly higher than the proportion of Romanian immigrants in the UK
