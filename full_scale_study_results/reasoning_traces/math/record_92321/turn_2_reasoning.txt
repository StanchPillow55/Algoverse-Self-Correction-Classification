Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to find the percentage of Romanian immigrants among all foreign national offenders in the UK, and compare it to the proportion of Romanian immigrants in the UK population.

Given information:
- Romanian immigrants account for more than 11% of all foreign national offenders in the UK.
- Romanian immigrants make up only a tiny proportion of UK residents.

Step 1: Understand the problem.
The question is asking us to compare the percentage of Romanian immigrants among foreign national offenders to the proportion of Romanian immigrants in the UK population.

Step 2: Identify the relevant information.
The relevant information is that Romanian immigrants account for more than 11% of all foreign national offenders, despite making up only a tiny proportion of UK residents.

Step 3: Analyze the information.
The key point is that the percentage of Romanian immigrants among foreign national offenders (more than 11%) is disproportionately high compared to their representation in the UK population (a tiny proportion).

Step 4: Provide the final answer.
Based on the information given, the final answer is that the percentage of Romanian immigrants among foreign national offenders is disproportionately high compared to their representation
