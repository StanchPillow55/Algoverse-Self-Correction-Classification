==================================================

The original cost of the grooming service is $100. John is offered a 30% discount because he is a new customer. 

To calculate the discount, we need to find 30% of $100. 

To do this, we multiply $100 by 30/100 (which is the decimal equivalent of 30%). 

$100 * 30/100 = $30

So, the discount is $30. 

To find the final cost of the grooming service, we subtract the discount from the original cost. 

$100 - $30 = $70

So, after the 30% discount, the grooming service costs John $70.
