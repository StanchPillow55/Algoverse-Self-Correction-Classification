==================================================

First, we need to calculate the total number of tires that Shawnda inflated. 

Bicycles have 2 tires, tricycles have 3 tires, and unicycles have 1 tire. 

So, for the bicycles, she inflated 5 bicycles * 2 tires = 10 tires.

For the tricycles, she inflated 3 tricycles * 3 tires = 9 tires.

And for the unicycle, she inflated 1 unicycle * 1 tire = 1 tire.

Adding these all together, Shawnda inflated 10 tires + 9 tires + 1 tire = 20 tires in total.

Shawnda charges 25 cents per tire, so to find out how much she made, we need to multiply the total number of tires by the cost per tire.

So, Shawnda made 20 tires * $0.25 = $5.00.

Therefore, Shawnda made $5.00 on her first day of offering the bike inflation service.
