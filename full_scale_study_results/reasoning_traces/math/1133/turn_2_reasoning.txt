Question ID: 1133
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to find out how fast Grandma walks on the beach. We know that she walks 2 miles on the beach in 40 minutes, so her speed on the beach is 2 miles / 40 minutes = 0.05 miles per minute.

Next, we know that Grandma walks twice as fast on the sidewalk as she does on the beach. So her speed on the sidewalk is 2 * 0.05 miles per minute = 0.1 miles per minute.

We know that she walks 1 mile on the sidewalk, so the time she spends on the sidewalk is the distance divided by the speed, which is 1 mile / 0.1 miles per minute = 10 minutes.

So, the total time Grandma spends walking is the time she spends on the beach plus the time she spends on the sidewalk, which is 40 minutes + 10 minutes = 50 minutes.

Therefore, it takes Grandma 50 minutes to complete her entire 3-mile walk.
