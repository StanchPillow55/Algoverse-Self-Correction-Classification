Question ID: 1133
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to determine Grandma's speed on the beach. We know she walks 2 miles on the beach in 40 minutes. Speed is calculated by dividing distance by time, so her speed on the beach is 2 miles / 40 minutes = 0.05 miles per minute.

Since Grandma walks twice as fast on the sidewalk as she does on the beach, her speed on the sidewalk is 0.05 miles per minute * 2 = 0.1 miles per minute.

We know she walks 1 mile on the sidewalk. To find out how long this takes, we divide the distance by her speed: 1 mile / 0.1 miles per minute = 10 minutes.

So, the total time for her 3-mile walk is the time she spends on the beach (40 minutes) plus the time she spends on the sidewalk (10 minutes) = 50 minutes.

Therefore, it takes Grandma 50 minutes to complete her entire 3-mile walk.
