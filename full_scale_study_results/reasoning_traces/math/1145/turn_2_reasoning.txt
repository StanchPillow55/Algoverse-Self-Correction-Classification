==================================================

To solve this problem, we first need to determine how many sunflowers and bouquets Faraday sells each day. 

From the given information, we know that each sunflower costs $2 and each bouquet costs $8. 

If Faraday earns $26 from the sunflower sales each day, we can calculate the number of sunflowers sold by dividing the total earnings by the cost of each sunflower. 

So, $26 / $2 = 13 sunflowers are sold each day.

Similarly, if Faraday earns $56 from the bouquet sales each day, we can calculate the number of bouquets sold by dividing the total earnings by the cost of each bouquet. 

So, $56 / $8 = 7 bouquets are sold each day.

Now, we know that each bouquet contains 12 sunflowers. So, the total number of sunflowers sold in the bouquets each day is 7 bouquets * 12 sunflowers/bouquet = 84 sunflowers.

Therefore, the total number of sunflowers sold each day (from individual sales and from bouquets) is 13 sunflowers + 84 sunflowers = 97 sunflowers.

Finally, to find out how many sunflowers Faraday was able to sell after 3 days, we multiply the number of sunflowers sold each day by 3:

97 sunflowers/day * 3 days = 291 sunflowers.

So, Faraday was able to sell 291 sunflowers after 3 days.
