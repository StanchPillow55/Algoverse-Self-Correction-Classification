Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to find out how many sunflowers and bouquets Faraday sells each day.

To find out how many sunflowers he sells, we divide the total earnings from the sunflowers by the cost of each sunflower. So, $26 รท $2 = 13 sunflowers per day.

To find out how many bouquets he sells, we divide the total earnings from the bouquets by the cost of each bouquet. So, $56 รท $8 = 7 bouquets per day.

Since each bouquet contains 12 sunflowers, Faraday sells 7 bouquets * 12 sunflowers = 84 sunflowers from bouquets per day.

So, in total, Faraday sells 13 sunflowers + 84 sunflowers = 97 sunflowers per day.

After 3 days, Faraday would have sold 97 sunflowers * 3 days = 291 sunflowers.

So, Faraday was able to sell 291 sunflowers after 3 days.
