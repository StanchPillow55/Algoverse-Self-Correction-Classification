Question ID: 1145
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to find out how many sunflowers and bouquets Faraday sells each day. 

To find the number of sunflowers sold per day, we divide the total earnings from the sunflowers by the cost of each sunflower. 

$26 รท $2 = 13 sunflowers

To find the number of bouquets sold per day, we divide the total earnings from the bouquets by the cost of each bouquet. 

$56 รท $8 = 7 bouquets

Since each bouquet contains 12 sunflowers, the total number of sunflowers sold in the bouquets each day is:

7 bouquets * 12 sunflowers/bouquet = 84 sunflowers

So, the total number of sunflowers sold each day (from individual sales and from bouquets) is:

13 sunflowers + 84 sunflowers = 97 sunflowers

Finally, to find the total number of sunflowers sold after 3 days, we multiply the number of sunflowers sold each day by 3:

97 sunflowers/day * 3 days = 291 sunflowers

So, Faraday was able to sell 291 sunflowers after 3 days.
