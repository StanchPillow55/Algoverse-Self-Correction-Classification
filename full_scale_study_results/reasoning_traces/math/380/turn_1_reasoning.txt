==================================================

First, we need to calculate the total interest that Karan will pay over the five months. 

The formula for simple interest is I = PRT, where I is the interest, P is the principal amount (the initial amount of money), R is the rate of interest per year, and T is the time in years. 

In this case, P = $3,650, R = 10% = 0.10 (as a decimal), and T = 5/12 years (since 5 months is 5/12 of a year). 

Substituting these values into the formula gives:

I = PRT 
I = $3,650 * 0.10 * (5/12) 
I = $152.08 (rounded to the nearest cent)

So, the total interest that Karan will pay over the five months is $152.08.

Next, we need to add this interest to the principal amount to find the total amount that Karan will have to pay back. 

Total repayment = Principal + Interest 
Total repayment = $3,650 + $152.08 
Total repayment = $3,802.08 

Finally, to find out how much Karan has to pay per month, we divide the total repayment by the number of months. 

Monthly payment = Total repayment / Number of months 
Monthly payment = $3,802.08 / 5 
Monthly payment = $760.42 (rounded to the nearest cent)

So, Karan has to pay approximately $760.42 per month.
