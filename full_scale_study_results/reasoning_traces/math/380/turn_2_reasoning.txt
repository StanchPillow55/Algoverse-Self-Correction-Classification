==================================================

To solve this problem, we first need to calculate the total interest that Karan will have to pay over the five months. 

The formula to calculate simple interest is:

Interest = Principal * Rate * Time

Where:
- Principal is the initial amount of money that was borrowed, in this case $3,650.
- Rate is the annual interest rate, in this case 10%. However, we need to convert this annual rate into a monthly rate by dividing it by 100 to convert it to a decimal and then dividing it by 12 (since there are 12 months in a year). So, the monthly rate is 10/100/12 = 0.00833.
- Time is the length of time the money is borrowed for, in this case 5 months.

So, the total interest that Karan will have to pay is:

Interest = $3,650 * 0.00833 * 5 = $152.04

Now, we need to add this interest to the original amount borrowed to find out the total amount that Karan has to pay back:

Total to be paid back = Principal + Interest
Total to be paid back = $3,650 + $152.04 = $3,802.04

Finally, since Karan has to pay an equal amount every month, we divide the total amount to be paid back by the number of months:

Monthly payment = Total to be paid back / Number of months
Monthly payment = $3,802.04 / 5 = $760.41

So, Karan has to pay approximately $760.41 per month.
