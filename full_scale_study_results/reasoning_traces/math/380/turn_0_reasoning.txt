==================================================

First, we need to calculate the total interest that Karan has to pay. The formula for simple interest is:

Interest = Principal * Rate * Time

The principal is the amount of money that Karan borrowed, which is $3,650. The rate is the interest rate, which is 10%. However, we need to convert this percentage into a decimal by dividing it by 100, so the rate is 0.10. The time is the length of the loan, which is 5 months. However, since the rate is usually given on an annual basis, we need to convert the time into years by dividing it by 12. So, the time is 5/12 years.

Substituting these values into the formula, we get:

Interest = $3,650 * 0.10 * (5/12) = $152.08

So, the total amount that Karan has to pay back is the principal plus the interest, which is $3,650 + $152.08 = $3,802.08

Since Karan has to pay an equal amount every month, we divide this total amount by the number of months, which is 5.

So, the amount that Karan has to pay per month is $3,802.08 / 5 = $760.42

Therefore, Karan has to pay $760.42 per month.
