Let's denote the length of the red rope as R, the length of the blue rope as B, and the length of the yellow rope as Y.

From the problem, we know that:

1) R = 4B (the red rope was four times the length of the blue rope)

2) B = Y - 7 (the blue rope was 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope)

3) R + B + Y = 37 (the 3 ropes had a combined length of 37 centimeters)

We can substitute the first two equations into the third equation to solve for the lengths of the ropes.

Substituting R = 4B into the third equation, we get:

4B + B + Y = 37

This simplifies to:

5B + Y = 37

Next, substituting B = Y - 7 into the equation above, we get:

5(Y - 7) + Y = 37

This simplifies to:

5Y - 35 + Y = 37

Combining like terms, we get:

6Y - 35 = 37

Adding 35 to both sides, we get:

6Y = 72

Dividing both sides by 6, we get:

Y = 12

Substituting Y = 12 into B = Y - 7, we get:

B = 12 - 7 = 5

Substituting B = 5 into R = 4B, we get:

R = 4 * 5 = 20

So, the length of the red rope is 20 centimeters.
