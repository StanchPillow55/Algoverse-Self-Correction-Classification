==================================================

First, let's figure out how much time John spent boating and swimming. He spent 6 hours boating and half that time swimming, so he spent 6/2 = <<6/2=3>>3 hours swimming.

So in total, John spent 6 + 3 = <<6+3=9>>9 hours boating and swimming.

He also watched 3 shows which were 2 hours each, so he spent 3*2 = <<3*2=6>>6 hours watching shows.

So in total, John spent 9 + 6 = <<9+6=15>>15 hours boating, swimming, and watching shows.

We know that this was 30% of the time he spent. So, we can set up the equation 0.30T = 15, where T is the total time John spent.

Solving for T, we get T = 15 / 0.30 = <<15/0.30=50>>50 hours.

We know that John spent 40% of his time sightseeing. So, he spent 0.40 * 50 = <<0.40*50=20>>20 hours sightseeing.

So, John spent 20 hours sightseeing.
