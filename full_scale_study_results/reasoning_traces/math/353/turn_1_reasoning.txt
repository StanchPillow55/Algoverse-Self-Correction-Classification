Question ID: 353
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine how much time John spent sightseeing based on the information given.

1. **Calculate the time spent on each activity:**

   - **Boating:** John spends 6 hours boating.
   - **Swimming:** He spends half the time swimming as he does boating. Therefore, the time spent swimming is:
     \[
     \text{Swimming time} = \frac{1}{2} \times 6 = 3 \text{ hours}
     \]
   - **Watching shows:** He watches 3 shows, each 2 hours long. Therefore, the time spent watching shows is:
     \[
     \text{Shows time} = 3 \times 2 = 6 \text{ hours}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total time spent on activities:**

   The total time spent on boating, swimming, and watching shows is:
   \[
   \text{Total time on activities} = 6 + 3 + 6 = 15 \text{ hours}
   \]

3. **Determine the total time spent on vacation:**

   According to the problem, the time spent watching shows (6 hours) is 30% of the total time spent on vacation. Let \( T \) be the total time spent on vacation. Then:
   \[
   0.30 \times T = 6
   \]
   Solving for \( T \):
   \[
   T = \frac{6}{0.30} = 20 \text{ hours}
   \]

4. **Calculate the time spent sightseeing:**

   The problem states that John spent 40% of his time sightseeing. Therefore, the time spent sightseeing is:
   \[
   \text{Sightseeing time} = 0.40 \times T = 0.40 \times 20 = 8 \text{ hours}
   \]

Thus, John spent 8 hours sightseeing. 

**Final Answer:** John spent 8 hours sightseeing.
