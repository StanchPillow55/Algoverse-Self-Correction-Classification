Question ID: 353
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine how much time John spent sightseeing based on the given information.

1. **Calculate the time spent on each activity:**

   - **Boating:** John spends 6 hours boating.
   - **Swimming:** He spends half the time he spent boating, which is \( \frac{6}{2} = 3 \) hours swimming.
   - **Watching shows:** He watches 3 shows, each 2 hours long, so he spends \( 3 \times 2 = 6 \) hours watching shows.

2. **Determine the total time spent on activities:**

   The total time spent on boating, swimming, and watching shows is:
   \[
   6 \text{ (boating)} + 3 \text{ (swimming)} + 6 \text{ (watching shows)} = 15 \text{ hours}
   \]

3. **Relate the time spent watching shows to the total time:**

   We know that the time spent watching shows (6 hours) is 30% of the total time. Let \( T \) be the total time spent on all activities. Therefore:
   \[
   0.30T = 6
   \]

   Solving for \( T \):
   \[
   T = \frac{6}{0.30} = 20 \text{ hours}
   \]

4. **Calculate the time spent sightseeing:**

   John spent 40% of his total time sightseeing. Therefore, the time spent sightseeing is:
   \[
   0.40 \times 20 = 8 \text{ hours}
   \]

Thus, John spent 8 hours sightseeing. 

**Final Answer: John spent 8 hours sightseeing.**
