Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To determine if the word 'have' is used with the same meaning in both sentences, we need to analyze the context and usage of the word in each sentence.

Sentence 1: "I have two years left."
In this sentence, the word 'have' is used to indicate possession or ownership of a specific amount of time (two years).

Sentence 2: "He had an insulin shock after eating three candy bars."
In this sentence, the word 'had' is used to describe an event or experience (an insulin shock) that occurred in the past.

The word 'have' in the first sentence and the word 'had' in the second sentence are not used with the same meaning. The first usage of 'have' indicates possession, while the second usage of 'had' indicates a past event.

Therefore, the word 'have' is not used with the same meaning in both sentences.

Final answer: No, the word 'have' is not used with the same meaning in both sentences.
