To determine if the word 'have' is used with the same meaning in both sentences, we need to analyze the context and usage of the word in each sentence.

Sentence 1: "I have two years left."
In this sentence, the word 'have' is used to indicate possession or ownership. The speaker is stating that they have or possess two years remaining.

Sentence 2: "He had an insulin shock after eating three candy bars."
In this sentence, the word 'had' is used to describe an event or occurrence that happened in the past. The person experienced an insulin shock after eating three candy bars.

Comparing the two sentences, we can see that the word 'have' in the first sentence and the word 'had' in the second sentence are not used with the same meaning.

In the first sentence, 'have' is used to express possession, while in the second sentence, 'had' is used to describe a past event.

Therefore, the word 'have' is not used with the same meaning in both sentences.

Final answer: No, the word 'have' is not used with the same meaning in both sentences.
