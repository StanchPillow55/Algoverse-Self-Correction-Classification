I apologize, but I do not have enough information to solve a specific math problem based on the given passage. The passage discusses political views and relations between Venezuela, the United States, and their respective presidents, but does not contain any mathematical information or a clear math problem to solve.

Without a specific math question or problem statement, I cannot provide step-by-step reasoning and calculations. If you have a clear math problem you would like me to solve, please provide the complete problem statement, and I will be happy to work through it and show my reasoning and final answer.
