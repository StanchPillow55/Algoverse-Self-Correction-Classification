==================================================

To solve this problem, I will need to analyze the given passage and the query to determine the appropriate placeholder and provide a final answer.

Given information:
- The passage discusses the views of a 70-year-old Venezuelan man, Miguel Bigello, regarding the U.S. presidential candidates Barack Obama and Mitt Romney.
- Bigello is an avid supporter of Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez and is critical of the "extreme right" in the U.S.
- The query suggests that with the likely triumph of a certain candidate, the writer hopes to start a new period of normal relations between the U.S. and Venezuela.

Step 1: Identify the appropriate placeholder in the query.
Based on the information provided in the passage, the likely candidate being referred to in the query is Barack Obama. The passage mentions that Bigello believes Obama has "not touched Latin America" and is less radical than Mitt Romney, who "will fight here for the oil."

Step 2: Provide the final answer.
With the likely triumph of Barack Obama, and the extreme right defeated both here and there [in the U.S.], I hope we can start a new period of normal relations.
