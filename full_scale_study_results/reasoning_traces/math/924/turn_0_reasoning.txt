Dataset Type: math
==================================================

The problem tells us that the sloth takes 4 hours to make a trip down the tree, pick up berries, and climb back up. It also tells us that the sloth wants to collect 24 berries in 8 hours. 

First, we need to figure out how many trips the sloth can make in 8 hours. Since each trip takes 4 hours, we can divide the total time by the time per trip to find the number of trips:

8 hours / 4 hours/trip = 2 trips

So, the sloth can make 2 trips in 8 hours.

Next, we need to figure out how many berries the sloth needs to pick up on each trip. Since the sloth wants to collect 24 berries and he can make 2 trips, we can divide the total number of berries by the number of trips to find the number of berries per trip:

24 berries / 2 trips = 12 berries/trip

So, the least number of berries the sloth can pick up per trip down to the ground is 12 berries.
