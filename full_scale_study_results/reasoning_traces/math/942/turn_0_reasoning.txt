Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, let's calculate the labor cost. Patty's Plumbing charges $35 per hour, or part thereof. This means that even if the work takes less than an hour, the charge will still be $35. Since the job took 2.25 hours, we need to round this up to 3 hours because Patty charges for part of an hour as if it were a full hour. 

So, the labor cost is 3 hours * $35/hour = $105.

Next, we add the visit charge, which is a flat rate of $40. 

So far, the total cost is $105 (labor) + $40 (visit) = $145.

Finally, we add the cost of the parts, which is $60.

So, the total cost that Patty charged is $145 + $60 = $205.

Therefore, Patty charged $205 for the job.
