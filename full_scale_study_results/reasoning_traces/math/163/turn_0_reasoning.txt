==================================================

First, let's find out the cost of the individual types of toys.

We know that one action figure costs $5. Therefore, the total cost of the action figures is 3 action figures * $5/action figure = $15.

We also know that one red car costs $4. Therefore, the total cost of the red cars is 5 red cars * $4/red car = $20.

We're told that the doll costs as much as 3 action figures. Since each action figure costs $5, the doll costs 3 action figures * $5/action figure = $15.

To find the total cost of all the toys, we add up the cost of the action figures, the red cars, and the doll. 

So, the total cost is $15 (for the action figures) + $20 (for the red cars) + $15 (for the doll) = $50.

Therefore, all the toys are worth $50.
