==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given information and determine the appropriate response.

Given information:
- The passage discusses how Shirley Temple, a famous Hollywood star, was a Republican, which is considered rare in today's predominantly liberal Hollywood.
- The passage also mentions that there were many vocal conservatives in Hollywood well into the 1970s, and they enjoyed the company of Richard Nixon.
- The query suggests that the Republicans have moved to the right, while the Democrats (referred to as "@placeholder") have moved to the left.

Reasoning:
1. The passage suggests that Hollywood, which was once home to many vocal conservatives, has become predominantly liberal over time.
2. The query indicates that the Republicans have moved to the right, while the Democrats (referred to as "@placeholder") have moved to the left.
3. This implies that the political landscape has shifted, with the Republicans becoming more conservative and the Democrats becoming more liberal.

Final answer:
Based on the information provided in the passage and the query, the statement "The Republicans have moved to the right; the @placeholder have moved to the left" is correct.
