To answer this question, I will go through the paragraph and identify the two benefits of Earth's magnetic field that are mentioned.

Benefit 1: Protects Earth and its organisms from harmful particles given off by the sun.
The paragraph states: "Earths magnetic field helps protect Earth and its organisms. It protects us from harmful particles given off by the sun."

Benefit 2: Provides a means of navigation for many animals, including birds.
The paragraph states: "Another benefit of Earths magnetic field is its use for navigation. People use compasses to detect Earths magnetic north pole. Knowing this helps them tell direction. Many animals have natural 'compasses' that work just as well. Birds like the garden warbler in Figure 1.36 use Earths magnetic field. They use it to guide their annual migrations."

The paragraph also mentions that recent research suggests that some migrating birds, like warblers, can actually see Earth's magnetic field as a visual pattern, which helps them navigate.

Therefore, the two benefits of Earth's magnetic field mentioned in the paragraph are:
1. Protecting Earth and its organisms from harmful particles given off by the sun.
