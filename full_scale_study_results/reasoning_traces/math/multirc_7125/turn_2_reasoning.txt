==================================================

To answer this question, I will go through the given paragraph and identify the two benefits of Earth's magnetic field mentioned.

Benefit 1: Protects Earth and its organisms from harmful particles given off by the sun.
The paragraph states that "Earth's magnetic field helps protect Earth and its organisms. It protects us from harmful particles given off by the sun."

Benefit 2: Provides a means of navigation for many animals, including birds.
The paragraph states that "Another benefit of Earth's magnetic field is its use for navigation. People use compasses to detect Earth's magnetic north pole. Knowing this helps them tell direction. Many animals have natural 'compasses' that work just as well. Birds like the garden warbler in Figure 1.36 use Earth's magnetic field. They use it to guide their annual migrations."

The paragraph also mentions that "Recent research suggests that warblers and other migrating birds have structures in their eyes that let them see Earth's magnetic field as a visual pattern."

Therefore, the two benefits of Earth's magnetic field mentioned in the paragraph are:

1. Protecting Earth and its organisms from harmful particles given off by the sun.
2. Providing a means
