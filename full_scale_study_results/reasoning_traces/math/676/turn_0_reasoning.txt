==================================================

The total amount invested is $1200.

Dylan's investment is 2/5 of the total amount. To find out how much Dylan invested, we multiply the total amount by 2/5:

$1200 * 2/5 = $480

After Dylan's investment, the remaining amount is the total amount minus Dylan's investment:

$1200 - $480 = $720

Frances invested 2/3 of the remaining amount. To find out how much Frances invested, we multiply the remaining amount by 2/3:

$720 * 2/3 = $480

After Frances's investment, the remaining amount is the previous remaining amount minus Frances's investment:

$720 - $480 = $240

Skyler's investment accounted for the rest, which is $240.

So, Skyler's investment was $240.
