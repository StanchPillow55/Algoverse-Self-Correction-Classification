==================================================

First, we need to calculate the total number of legs for each type of creature Jake sees.

For the spiders, each one has 8 legs. So, we multiply the number of spiders by the number of legs each spider has:

80 spiders * 8 legs/spider = 640 legs

Next, we do the same for the insects. Each insect has 6 legs:

90 insects * 6 legs/insect = 540 legs

Finally, we calculate the total number of legs for the rare mutant invertebrates. Each one has 10 legs:

3 invertebrates * 10 legs/invertebrate = 30 legs

Now, we add up all these legs to find the total number of legs Jake sees:

640 legs (from spiders) + 540 legs (from insects) + 30 legs (from invertebrates) = 1210 legs

So, Jake sees a total of 1210 legs.
