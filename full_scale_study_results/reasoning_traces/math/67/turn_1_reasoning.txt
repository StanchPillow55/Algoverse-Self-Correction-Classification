Question ID: 67
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, let's find out how many rubies there are. Since there are 35 fewer rubies than diamonds, we subtract 35 from the number of diamonds:

175 diamonds - 35 = 140 rubies

Next, we find out how many emeralds there are. Since there are twice the number of emeralds as rubies, we multiply the number of rubies by 2:

140 rubies * 2 = 280 emeralds

Finally, we add up all the gems to find the total number. 

175 diamonds + 140 rubies + 280 emeralds = 595 gems

So, there were 595 gems in the chest.
