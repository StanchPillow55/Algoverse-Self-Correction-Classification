Dataset Type: math
==================================================

The problem gives us the number of diamonds directly, which is 175.

The number of rubies is 35 less than the number of diamonds. So, we subtract 35 from the number of diamonds to find the number of rubies:

175 diamonds - 35 = 140 rubies

The number of emeralds is twice the number of rubies. So, we multiply the number of rubies by 2 to find the number of emeralds:

140 rubies * 2 = 280 emeralds

To find the total number of gems, we add the number of diamonds, rubies, and emeralds together:

175 diamonds + 140 rubies + 280 emeralds = 595 gems

So, the treasure chest contained 595 gems.
