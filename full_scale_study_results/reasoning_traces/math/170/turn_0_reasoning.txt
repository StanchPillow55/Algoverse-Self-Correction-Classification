Dataset Type: math
==================================================

The cost of the hat is given as $25.

The jacket costs three times as much as the hat, so its cost is 3 * $25 = $75.

The pants cost the average of the costs of the hat and jacket. To find this, we add the cost of the hat and the jacket and then divide by 2. So, the cost of the pants is ($25 + $75) / 2 = $50.

To find the total cost of each uniform, we add the cost of the hat, the jacket, and the pants. So, the total cost of each uniform is $25 + $75 + $50 = $150.

Therefore, each uniform costs $150.
