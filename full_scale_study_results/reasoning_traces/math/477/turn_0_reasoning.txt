Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to find out how many kids are allergic to either dairy or peanuts or both. 

We know that 9 kids are allergic to dairy and 6 are allergic to peanuts. However, we also know that 3 kids are allergic to both. So, we need to subtract these 3 kids from the total number of kids allergic to dairy or peanuts, because we are counting them twice.

So, the total number of kids allergic to either dairy or peanuts or both is 9 (dairy) + 6 (peanuts) - 3 (both) = 12 kids.

Now, to find out how many kids aren't allergic to anything, we subtract the number of kids who are allergic to something from the total number of kids in the class.

So, the number of kids who aren't allergic to anything is 32 (total kids) - 12 (allergic kids) = 20 kids.

Therefore, 20 kids in Gina's class aren't allergic to anything.
