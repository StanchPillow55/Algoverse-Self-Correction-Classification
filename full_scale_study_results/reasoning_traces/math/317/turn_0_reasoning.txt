Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we first need to find the volume of the pool. The volume of a rectangular prism (which is the shape of the pool) is found by multiplying the length, width, and height. 

So, the volume of the pool is 6 feet (length) times 4 feet (width) times 5 feet (depth) which equals 120 cubic feet.

Next, we need to find out how much it costs to fill the pool. We know that it costs $.1 per cubic foot to fill. 

So, we multiply the volume of the pool (120 cubic feet) by the cost per cubic foot ($.1) to find the total cost. 

120 cubic feet * $.1 per cubic foot = $12

So, it costs $12 to fill the pool.
