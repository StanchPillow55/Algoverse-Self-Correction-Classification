==================================================

To solve the problem of determining how much Alex charges for 2 weeks of tutoring at a rate of $12 per day, we can follow these steps:

1. **Identify the number of days in 2 weeks:**
   - A week consists of 7 days.
   - Therefore, 2 weeks consist of \(2 \times 7 = 14\) days.

2. **Calculate the total charge for 14 days:**
   - Alex charges $12 per day.
   - For 14 days, the total charge would be \(14 \times 12\).

3. **Perform the multiplication:**
   \[
   14 \times 12 = 168
   \]

   Here's a breakdown of the multiplication:
   - Multiply 14 by 10: \(14 \times 10 = 140\)
   - Multiply 14 by 2: \(14 \times 2 = 28\)
   - Add the results: \(140 + 28 = 168\)

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The total amount Alex charges for 2 weeks of tutoring is $168.

Therefore, the final answer is that Alex charges **$168** for 2 weeks of tutoring.
