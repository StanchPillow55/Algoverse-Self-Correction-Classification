Question ID: 708
Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to calculate how much Alex charges for one week of tutoring. Since there are 7 days in a week and she charges $12 per day, we multiply 7 by 12.

7 days/week * $12/day = $84/week

Next, we need to find out how much she charges for two weeks. Since one week costs $84, we multiply this by 2 to find the cost for two weeks.

$84/week * 2 weeks = $168

So, Alex charges $168 for two weeks of tutoring.
