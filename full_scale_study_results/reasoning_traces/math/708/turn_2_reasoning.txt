Question ID: 708
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem of determining how much Alex charges for 2 weeks of tutoring, given that she charges $12 per day, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Identify the number of days in 2 weeks:**
   - A week consists of 7 days.
   - Therefore, 2 weeks consist of \(2 \times 7 = 14\) days.

2. **Calculate the total charge for 14 days:**
   - Alex charges $12 per day.
   - For 14 days, the total charge is calculated by multiplying the daily rate by the number of days:
   \[
   12 \, \text{dollars/day} \times 14 \, \text{days} = 168 \, \text{dollars}
   \]

3. **Conclusion:**
   - The total amount Alex charges for 2 weeks of tutoring is $168.

Final Answer: Alex charges $168 for 2 weeks of tutoring.
