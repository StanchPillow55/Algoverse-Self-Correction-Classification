Question ID: 814
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to convert the time they played from hours to minutes because the given time for each game is in minutes. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 4 hours is 4*60 = 240 minutes.

Next, we need to find out how many games each person played. 

Jack can play a game for 20 minutes, so in 240 minutes, he can play 240/20 = 12 games.

His two friends who are worse than him can only play half as long, so they can play a game for 20/2 = 10 minutes. In 240 minutes, each of them can play 240/10 = 24 games. Since there are two of them, they played a total of 24*2 = 48 games.

His friend who is better than him can play 1.5 times as long, so he can play a game for 20*1.5 = 30 minutes. In 240 minutes, he can play 240/30 = 8 games.

Adding up all the games played, we get 12 + 48 + 8 = 68 games.

Since each game costs 1 quarter, and there are 4 quarters in a dollar, the total cost is 68/4 = $17. 

So, they used $17 in total.
