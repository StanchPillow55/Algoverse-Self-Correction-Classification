Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, let's convert the 4 hours of playtime into minutes, since the game durations are given in minutes. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 4 hours is 4 * 60 = 240 minutes.

Next, let's figure out how many games each person can play in that time.

Jack can play a game for 20 minutes, so in 240 minutes, he can play 240 / 20 = 12 games.

His two friends who are worse than him can only play for half as long, or 20 / 2 = 10 minutes per game. In 240 minutes, each of them can play 240 / 10 = 24 games. Since there are two of them, they play a total of 24 * 2 = 48 games.

His friend who is better than him can play for 1.5 times as long, or 20 * 1.5 = 30 minutes per game. In 240 minutes, this friend can play 240 / 30 = 8 games.

Adding up all the games played, we get 12 (Jack's games) + 48 (two friends' games) + 8 (better friend's games) = 68 games.

Since each game costs 1 quarter, and there are 4 quarters in a dollar, the total cost in dollars is 68 / 4 = $17. 

So, they used $17 to play games at the arcade.
