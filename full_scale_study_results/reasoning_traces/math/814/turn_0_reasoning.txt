==================================================

First, we need to determine how many quarters each person needs to play for 4 hours.

1. Jack: He can play for 20 minutes with 1 quarter. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 4 hours is 240 minutes. Therefore, Jack needs 240/20 = 12 quarters.

2. Two friends: Each of them can play for half as long as Jack, which is 20/2 = 10 minutes with 1 quarter. Therefore, each of them needs 240/10 = 24 quarters. Since there are two of them, they need 24*2 = 48 quarters in total.

3. One friend: This friend can play for 1.5 times as long as Jack, which is 20*1.5 = 30 minutes with 1 quarter. Therefore, this friend needs 240/30 = 8 quarters.

Adding up all the quarters needed, we get 12 + 48 + 8 = 68 quarters.

Since each quarter is worth $0.25, the total amount of money used is 68*$0.25 = $17.
