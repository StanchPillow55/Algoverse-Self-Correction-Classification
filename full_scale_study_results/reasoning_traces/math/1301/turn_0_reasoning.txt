Dataset Type: math
==================================================

Randy starts with 9 oatmeal cookies, 4 chocolate chip cookies, and 5 sugar cookies. This totals to 9 + 4 + 5 = 18 cookies.

For an early day snack, he eats 3 cookies, one of each flavor. So, he has 18 - 3 = 15 cookies left.

For lunch, he eats 2 oatmeal cookies. So, he has 15 - 2 = 13 cookies left.

He gives 2 sugar cookies to his friends. So, he has 13 - 2 = 11 cookies left.

Then, he bakes 4 of each flavor for dinner. Since there are 3 flavors, he bakes 4 * 3 = 12 more cookies.

So, after baking, he has 11 + 12 = 23 cookies.

Therefore, Randy has 23 cookies now.
