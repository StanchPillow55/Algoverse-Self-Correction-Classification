==================================================

Trinity sells the magazines at 11/8 of the price she bought them. This means she sells them for more than she bought them, which will result in a profit.

First, we need to calculate how much she sells the magazines for. 

To do this, we multiply the price she bought the magazines for by 11/8:

$72 * 11/8 = $99

So, she sells the magazines for $99.

Next, we need to calculate her profit. 

Profit is calculated by subtracting the cost price (how much she bought the magazines for) from the selling price (how much she sells the magazines for).

So, her profit is:

$99 (selling price) - $72 (cost price) = $27

Therefore, Trinity's profit is $27.
