Question ID: record_27922
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine who the placeholder is in the given statement.

Given information:
- Arsenal defeated Newcastle 4-1 in their Premier League clash.
- Olivier Giroud, Danny Welbeck, and Alexis Sanchez started the match together.
- Giroud scored a brace, and Santi Cazorla also netted twice.
- Sanchez created two goals.
- Welbeck was brought down in the box, and Cazorla completed the victory with a Panenka penalty.

Step 1: Identify the placeholder in the given statement.
The statement mentions that Cazorla completed the victory with a Panenka penalty after "@placeholder" had been brought down in the box.

Based on the information provided in the passage, the placeholder is most likely referring to Danny Welbeck, as it states that "Welbeck was brought down for a penalty."

Step 2: Confirm the reasoning.
The passage clearly states that Welbeck was brought down in the box, and Cazorla then scored a Panenka penalty to complete the victory for Arsenal.
