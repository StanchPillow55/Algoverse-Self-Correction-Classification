Question ID: 831
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, let's determine how many items are included in the base installation cost of $129.00. The base installation includes 4 mirrors, 2 shelves, 1 chandelier, and 10 pictures. This totals to 4 + 2 + 1 + 10 = 17 items.

Next, let's determine how many items Angela needs installed. She has 6 mirrors, 2 chandeliers, and 20 pictures. This totals to 6 + 2 + 20 = 28 items.

Angela has 28 items and the base installation covers 17 items. Therefore, Angela has 28 - 17 = 11 additional items that are not covered by the base installation.

The cost for installing additional items is $15.00 per item. Therefore, the cost for installing Angela's additional items is 11 * $15.00 = $165.00.

Finally, we add the base installation cost of $129.00 to the cost for the additional items of $165.00. This gives us a total cost of $129.00 + $165.00 = $294.00.

Therefore, it will cost Angela $294.00 to have all her items installed.
