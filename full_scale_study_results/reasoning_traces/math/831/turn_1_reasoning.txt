Question ID: 831
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

The interior design firm offers installation of 4 mirrors, 2 shelves, 1 chandelier, and 10 pictures for $129.00. This is a total of 17 items. 

Angela needs to install 6 mirrors, 2 chandeliers, and 20 pictures. This is a total of 28 items. 

First, we need to find out how many additional items Angela has beyond the 17 items included in the base price. 

28 items (Angela's total) - 17 items (included in base price) = 11 additional items 

The firm charges $15.00 for each additional item. So, we need to multiply the number of additional items by the cost per item:

11 additional items * $15.00 per item = $165.00

Finally, we add this to the base price of $129.00:

$129.00 (base price) + $165.00 (additional items) = $294.00

So, the total cost for Angela to have all her items installed will be $294.00.
