Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

The interior design firm's offer includes the installation of 4 mirrors, 2 shelves, 1 chandelier, and 10 pictures. This totals to 17 items. 

Angela needs to have 6 mirrors, 2 chandeliers, and 20 pictures installed. This totals to 28 items. 

So, Angela has 28 - 17 = 11 additional items that need to be installed beyond what the firm's offer includes.

The firm charges $15.00 for each additional item. So, the cost for the additional items will be 11 * $15.00 = $165.00.

The firm's initial offer costs $129.00. So, the total cost for Angela will be $129.00 (initial offer) + $165.00 (additional items) = $294.00.

Therefore, it will cost Angela $294.00 to have all her items installed.
