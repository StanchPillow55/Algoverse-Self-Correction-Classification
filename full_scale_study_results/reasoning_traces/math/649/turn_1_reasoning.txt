Step 1: Determine the number of likes after three weeks

The problem states that after three weeks, the number of likes was 70 times the initial number of likes. Since the initial number of likes was 2000, we multiply 2000 by 70 to find the number of likes after three weeks.

2000 likes * 70 = 140,000 likes

So, after three weeks, the photo had 140,000 likes.

Step 2: Add the new likes

The problem also states that she received 20,000 more new likes recently. To find the total number of likes, we add these new likes to the number of likes after three weeks.

140,000 likes + 20,000 likes = 160,000 likes

So, the photo has a total of 160,000 likes.

Therefore, Fishio's selfie on Instagram has 160,000 likes.
