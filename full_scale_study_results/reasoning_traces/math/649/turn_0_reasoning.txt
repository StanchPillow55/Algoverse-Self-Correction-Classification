==================================================

Step 1: Determine the number of likes after three weeks

Fishio initially received 2000 likes on her photo. After three weeks, the number of likes was 70 times this initial amount. We can calculate the number of likes after three weeks by multiplying the initial number of likes by 70:

2000 likes * 70 = 140,000 likes

Step 2: Add the new likes

Fishio recently received an additional 20,000 likes. We add this to the number of likes after three weeks to find the total number of likes:

140,000 likes + 20,000 likes = 160,000 likes

So, Fishio's selfie on Instagram has a total of 160,000 likes.
