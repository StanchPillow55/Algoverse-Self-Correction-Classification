Question ID: 649
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, let's determine how many likes Fishio had three weeks after she initially posted her selfie. According to the problem, three weeks later, the number of likes was 70 times as many as the initial number of likes. Since the initial number of likes was 2000, we can calculate the number of likes after three weeks by multiplying 2000 by 70.

2000 likes * 70 = 140,000 likes

So, three weeks after posting her selfie, Fishio had 140,000 likes on her photo.

The problem also states that she received 20,000 more new likes recently. To find the total number of likes, we add these new likes to the previous total.

140,000 likes + 20,000 likes = 160,000 likes

Therefore, Fishio has a total of 160,000 likes on her Instagram selfie.
