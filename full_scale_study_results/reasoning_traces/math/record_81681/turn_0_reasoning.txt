To solve this problem, we need to determine the missing placeholder in the given query.

Given information:
- The passage mentions that Wales beat England 30-3 two years ago.
- The query states that Stuart Lancaster insists his side (England) are in a 'completely different place' from where they were two years ago.

Based on the information provided, the missing placeholder in the query is "England".

Reasoning:
1. The passage mentions that Wales beat England 30-3 two years ago, indicating that England was the team that lost to Wales two years ago.
2. The query states that Stuart Lancaster, the England coach, insists his side (England) are in a 'completely different place' from where they were two years ago.

Therefore, the missing placeholder in the query is "England".

Final answer:
Stuart Lancaster insists England are in a 'completely different place' from where they were two years ago.
