Question ID: record_81681
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine the missing placeholder in the given query.

Given information:
- The passage discusses the upcoming rugby match between Wales and England in the Six Nations tournament.
- It mentions that Wales beat England 30-3 two years ago.
- The query states that Stuart Lancaster, the England coach, insists that his team is in a "completely different place" from where they were two years ago.

To find the missing placeholder, we need to determine which team Stuart Lancaster is referring to.

Based on the context, it is clear that Stuart Lancaster is the coach of the England team. Therefore, the missing placeholder in the query should be "England".

The complete query with the missing placeholder filled in is:

"Stuart Lancaster insists England are in a 'completely different place' from where they were two years ago."

This makes sense in the context of the passage, as the England team is looking to improve on their previous performance against Wales.

Final answer:
The missing placeholder in the query is "England".
