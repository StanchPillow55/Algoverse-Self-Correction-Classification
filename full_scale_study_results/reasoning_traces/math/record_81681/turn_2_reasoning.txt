Question ID: record_81681
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine the missing placeholder in the given query.

Given information:
- The passage mentions that Wales beat England 30-3 two years ago.
- The query states that Stuart Lancaster insists his team (England) are in a 'completely different place' from where they were two years ago.

The missing placeholder in the query is the team that Stuart Lancaster is referring to, which is England.

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The passage states that Wales beat England 30-3 two years ago, indicating that England was the losing team in that match.
2. The query mentions that Stuart Lancaster, the England coach, insists his team (England) are in a 'completely different place' from where they were two years ago.
3. Therefore, the missing placeholder in the query is the team that Stuart Lancaster is referring to, which is England.

Final answer:
The missing placeholder in the query is "England".
