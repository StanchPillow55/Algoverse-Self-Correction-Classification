Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To determine how much Alison spent on athletic gear, we need to calculate the total cost of each item she purchased and then sum these amounts. Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Tank Top:**
   - The cost of the tank top is given as $10.

2. **Running Shorts:**
   - The running shorts cost $5 more than the tank top.
   - Therefore, the cost of the running shorts is $10 (cost of the tank top) + $5 = $15.

3. **Tennis Shoes:**
   - The original price of the tennis shoes is $48.
   - They were on sale for half price, so the sale price is $48 / 2 = $24.

4. **Athletic Socks:**
   - The original price of the athletic socks is $8.
   - Alison had a coupon for $2 off, so the price she paid is $8 - $2 = $6.

Now, we add up the costs of all the items to find the total amount Alison spent:

- Cost of the tank top: $10
- Cost of the running shorts: $15
- Cost of the tennis shoes: $24
- Cost of the athletic socks: $6

Total cost = $10 + $15 + $24 + $6

Let's calculate the total:

- $10 + $15 = $25
- $25 + $24 = $49
- $49 + $6 = $55

Therefore, Alison spent a total of $55 on athletic gear.

**Final Answer:**
Alison spent $55 on athletic gear.
