Question ID: 1053
Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, let's calculate the cost of each item:

- The tank top cost $10.
- The running shorts cost $5 more than the tank top, so they cost $10 + $5 = $15.
- The tennis shoes were on sale for half price, so they cost $48 / 2 = $24.
- The athletic socks cost $8, but Alison had a $2 off coupon, so they cost $8 - $2 = $6.

Now, let's add up the cost of all the items to find out how much Alison spent in total:

$10 (tank top) + $15 (running shorts) + $24 (tennis shoes) + $6 (athletic socks) = $55.

So, Alison spent $55 on athletic gear.
