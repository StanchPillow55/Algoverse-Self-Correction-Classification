==================================================

First, let's calculate the net income for both jobs.

Job A:
The gross income for Job A is $15 per hour for 2000 hours a year, which equals $15 * 2000 = $30,000 a year.

The state tax for Job A is 20% of the gross income. So, the total tax is $30,000 * 20% = $6,000.

Therefore, the net income for Job A is the gross income minus the tax, which equals $30,000 - $6,000 = $24,000.

Job B:
The gross income for Job B is $42,000 a year.

The property tax for Job B is $6,000. So, the income after property tax is $42,000 - $6,000 = $36,000.

The state tax for Job B is 10% of the income after property tax. So, the total tax is $36,000 * 10% = $3,600.

Therefore, the net income for Job B is the income after property tax minus the state tax, which equals $36,000 - $3,600 = $32,400.

Now, let's compare the net incomes for both jobs. The difference between the net incomes for Job B and Job A is $32,400 - $24,000 = $8,400.

Therefore, Nick will make $8,400 more at Job B compared to Job A.
