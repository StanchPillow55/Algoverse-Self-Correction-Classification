==================================================

First, let's calculate the net income for each job.

Job A:
The gross income is $15/hour * 2000 hours/year = $30,000/year.
The state tax is 20% of the gross income, so the tax is $30,000 * 20% = $6,000.
The net income is the gross income minus the tax, so the net income is $30,000 - $6,000 = $24,000.

Job B:
The gross income is $42,000/year.
The property tax is $6,000, so the income after property tax is $42,000 - $6,000 = $36,000.
The state tax is 10% of the income after property tax, so the tax is $36,000 * 10% = $3,600.
The net income is the income after property tax minus the state tax, so the net income is $36,000 - $3,600 = $32,400.

Now, let's compare the net incomes of the two jobs.
The difference in net income is $32,400 (Job B) - $24,000 (Job A) = $8,400.

So, Nick will make $8,400 more at Job B compared to Job A.
