Question ID: 331
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, let's calculate the total income and net income for each job.

Job A:
The total income for Job A is $15 per hour times 2000 hours, which equals $30,000.
The total tax for Job A is 20% of $30,000, which equals $6,000.
So, the net income for Job A is $30,000 - $6,000 = $24,000.

Job B:
The total income for Job B is $42,000.
The total tax for Job B is the property tax of $6,000 plus 10% of the net income after property tax. 
First, we subtract the property tax from the total income: $42,000 - $6,000 = $36,000.
Then, we calculate the income tax: 10% of $36,000 = $3,600.
So, the total tax for Job B is $6,000 + $3,600 = $9,600.
The net income for Job B is $42,000 - $9,600 = $32,400.

Now, let's compare the net incomes for the two jobs.
The net income for Job B is $32,400, and the net income for Job A is $24,000.
So, Nick will make $32,400 - $24,000 = $8,400 more at Job B than at Job A.

Therefore, Nick will make $8,400 more at the job with the higher net pay rate, which is Job B.
