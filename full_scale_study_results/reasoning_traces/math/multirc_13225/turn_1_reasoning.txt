==================================================

To solve this problem, I will go through the passage step-by-step and identify the relevant information to determine who the woman the herb vendor spoke of is.

Given information:
- The herb vendor told Nepthys and the narrator the name of a woman who lived on a certain street.
- When they reached the street, they found a building that looked like a short pagoda with a sign showing a face with hands uplifted, like a saint under God's light, and handcuffed.
- Inside the entrance room, there were bright silks, velvet cushions, and offensive-looking decorations.
- A large woman, similarly decorated, quickly drifted up to them and introduced herself as Madame Entera, the proprietor of the shop.

Reasoning:
1. The herb vendor told Nepthys and the narrator the name of a woman who lived on a certain street.
2. When they reached the street, they found a building that matched the description provided by the herb vendor.
3. Inside the building, they were greeted by a large woman who introduced herself as Madame Entera, the proprietor of the shop.
4. Base
