To solve this problem, we need to carefully analyze the information provided in the paragraph and identify the woman the herb vendor spoke of.

Given information:
- The herb vendor told Nepthys and the narrator the name of a woman who lived on a certain street.
- When they reached the street, they found a building that looked like a short pagoda, with a sign showing a face with hands uplifted, like a saint under God's light, and handcuffed.
- Inside the entrance room, they were greeted by a large woman, who introduced herself as Madame Entera, the proprietor of the shop.

Reasoning:
Based on the information provided in the paragraph, the woman the herb vendor spoke of is Madame Entera, the large woman who greeted Nepthys and the narrator at the door of the building on the street.

The paragraph clearly states that when they reached the street, they found the building with the sign, and inside, they were greeted by Madame Entera, who identified herself as the proprietor of the shop.

Therefore, the woman the herb vendor spoke of is Madame Entera.
