==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to fill in the placeholder in the query with a relevant term or phrase that fits the context of the passage provided. 

### Step 1: Understand the Context
The passage discusses King Juan Carlos of Spain and his controversial hunting trip to Africa, which has drawn criticism due to its expense during a time when Spain is experiencing an economic crisis. The king has apologized for the trip, acknowledging that it was a mistake.

### Step 2: Identify Key Themes
From the passage, we can identify several key themes:
- The economic crisis in Spain
- The king's actions and their implications
- The need for unity and collective effort in tough times

### Step 3: Analyze the Query
The query states that the king had previously expressed concern over the impact of the crisis on a certain group or entity and called on the nation to come together. The placeholder is likely referring to a group that is affected by the economic crisis.

### Step 4: Determine the Appropriate Term
Given the context of the economic crisis, the most logical term to fill in the placeholder would be "the Spanish people" or "the citizens of Spain." This is because the king's concern would naturally be directed towards those who are directly affected by the economic conditions.

### Step 5: Fill in the Placeholder
Now, we can fill in the placeholder with "the Spanish people":

**Final Answer:**
The king himself had previously expressed his concern over the impact of the crisis on **the Spanish people** and called on the nation to come together to get through the tough times.
