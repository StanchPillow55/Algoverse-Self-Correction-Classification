To solve the query, we need to fill in the placeholder in the sentence: "The king himself had previously expressed his concern over the impact of the crisis on @placeholder and called on the nation to come together to get through the tough times."

Let's analyze the context provided in the passage:

1. **Context of the Apology**: King Juan Carlos made a public apology for his expensive hunting trip during a time when Spain is facing an economic crisis. This indicates that he is aware of the financial struggles of the country and the public sentiment regarding his actions.

2. **Concern Over the Crisis**: The king's concern likely extends to the people of Spain, as they are the ones directly affected by the economic crisis. His call for the nation to come together suggests a focus on unity and support among the citizens.

3. **Identifying the Placeholder**: Given the context, the placeholder should refer to a group or entity that is impacted by the economic crisis. The most logical choice here would be "the Spanish people" or "the citizens of Spain," as they are the ones experiencing the hardships of the economic situation.

Now, let's fill in the placeholder:

"The king himself had previously expressed his concern over the impact of the crisis on **the Spanish people** and called on the nation to come together to get through the tough times."

Thus, the final answer for the placeholder is:

**the Spanish people**
