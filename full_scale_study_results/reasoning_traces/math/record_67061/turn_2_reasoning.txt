==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to fill in the placeholder in the query with a word or phrase that makes sense in the context of the passage. The passage discusses King Juan Carlos's hunting trip, the public's reaction to it, and the economic crisis in Spain. 

Let's break down the relevant parts of the passage:

1. **King Juan Carlos's Apology**: He apologized for the hunting trip, which was seen as extravagant during a time of economic hardship.
2. **Economic Crisis**: The passage mentions that Spain is experiencing an economic crisis, which adds to the public's outrage over the king's actions.
3. **Call for Unity**: The query states that the king had previously expressed concern over the impact of the crisis on something and called for the nation to come together.

Now, we need to determine what the king might have expressed concern about regarding the impact of the economic crisis. Given the context, it is reasonable to assume that he would be concerned about the impact on the Spanish people or the nation as a whole.

Thus, the most fitting word to fill in the placeholder would be "the Spanish people" or simply "Spain." 

Now, let's fill in the placeholder:

**Query**: The king himself had previously expressed his concern over the impact of the crisis on **the Spanish people** and called on the nation to come together to get through the tough times.

Final Answer: **the Spanish people**
