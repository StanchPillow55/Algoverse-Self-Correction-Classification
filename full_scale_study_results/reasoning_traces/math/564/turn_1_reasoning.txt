Question ID: 564
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to determine how many minutes Judy read in total during the first week. Since there are 7 days in a week and she read for 15 minutes each night, we multiply 7 by 15 to get the total minutes:

7 days/week * 15 minutes/day = 105 minutes/week

Next, we need to determine how many pages Judy can read in one minute. Since she can read 2 pages in 1.5 minutes, we divide 2 by 1.5 to get the pages per minute:

2 pages / 1.5 minutes = 1.33 pages/minute (approximately)

Now, we can calculate how many pages Judy read in the first week. We multiply the total minutes she read by the number of pages she can read in one minute:

105 minutes * 1.33 pages/minute = 139.65 pages

Since Judy can't read a fraction of a page, we'll round this down to the nearest whole number, which is 139 pages.

In the second week, we know that Judy read a total of 100 pages.

So, to find the total number of pages Judy read in two weeks, we add the number of pages she read in the first week to the number of pages she read in the second week:

139 pages + 100 pages = 239 pages

Therefore, Judy read a total of 239 pages in two weeks.
