Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to first determine how many pages Judy read in the first week, then add that to the number of pages she read in the second week.

First, let's calculate how many minutes Judy read in total in the first week. Since there are 7 days in a week and she read for 15 minutes each night, she read for a total of 7 * 15 = 105 minutes in the first week.

Next, we need to determine how many pages she can read in a minute. Given that she can read 2 pages per 1.5 minutes, her reading speed is 2 / 1.5 = 1.33 (rounded to two decimal places) pages per minute.

Therefore, in the first week, Judy read a total of 105 minutes * 1.33 pages per minute = 139.65 pages. Since she can't read a fraction of a page, we'll round this down to 139 pages.

In the second week, she read a total of 100 pages.

So, in total, over the two weeks, Judy read 139 pages (first week) + 100 pages (second week) = 239 pages.

Therefore, Judy read a total of 239 pages in two weeks.
