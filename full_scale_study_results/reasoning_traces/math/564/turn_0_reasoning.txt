==================================================

First, let's calculate how many minutes Judy read in total in the first week. Since there are 7 days in a week, and she read for 15 minutes each night, she read for a total of 7 * 15 = 105 minutes in the first week.

Next, we need to determine how many pages Judy can read in one minute. Given that she can read 2 pages in 1.5 minutes, her reading speed is 2 / 1.5 = 1.33 pages per minute (approximately).

Now, we can calculate how many pages Judy read in the first week. With a reading speed of 1.33 pages per minute, in 105 minutes, she read 1.33 * 105 = 139.65 pages. Since she can't read a fraction of a page, we'll round this down to 139 pages.

In the second week, we know that Judy read a total of 100 pages.

So, in two weeks, Judy read a total of 139 pages (first week) + 100 pages (second week) = 239 pages.

Therefore, Judy read 239 pages in two weeks.
