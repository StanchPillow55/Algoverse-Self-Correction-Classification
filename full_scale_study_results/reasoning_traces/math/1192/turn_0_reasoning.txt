Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to calculate how much Jen earns in a day. Since she works for 7.5 hours a day and her hourly rate is $1.5, we multiply these two values together:

7.5 hours/day * $1.5/hour = $11.25/day

Next, we need to calculate how much Jen earns in a week. Since she works 6 days a week, we multiply her daily earnings by 6:

$11.25/day * 6 days/week = $67.5/week

Now, we need to calculate how much Jen earns in a month. Since there are 4 weeks in a month, we multiply her weekly earnings by 4:

$67.5/week * 4 weeks/month = $270/month

Finally, since Jen did not incur any absences for April, she receives an additional $10. We add this to her monthly earnings:

$270/month + $10 = $280

Therefore, Jen will receive $280 for the month of April.
