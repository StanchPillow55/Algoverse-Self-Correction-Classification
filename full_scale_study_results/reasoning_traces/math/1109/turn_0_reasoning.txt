Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To find the average height of the heels at the party, we need to add up all the heights and then divide by the total number of women.

First, let's find the total height for the women wearing 4 inch heels. There are 3 women, each wearing 4 inch heels, so the total height for these women is 3 * 4 = 12 inches.

Next, let's find the total height for the women wearing 2 inch heels. There are 3 women, each wearing 2 inch heels, so the total height for these women is 3 * 2 = 6 inches.

Now, we add these two totals together to get the total height of all the heels at the party. This is 12 inches + 6 inches = 18 inches.

Finally, we divide this total by the number of women at the party to find the average height of the heels. There are 6 women at the party, so the average height is 18 inches / 6 = 3 inches.

So, the average height of the heels at this cocktail party is 3 inches.
