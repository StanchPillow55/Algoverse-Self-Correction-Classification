Question ID: 1109
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To find the average height of the heels worn by the women at the cocktail party, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Identify the Total Number of Women and Heels:**
   - There are three women wearing 4-inch heels.
   - There are three women wearing 2-inch heels.
   - Therefore, the total number of women (and thus the total number of heels) is \(3 + 3 = 6\).

2. **Calculate the Total Height of All Heels:**
   - The total height contributed by the women wearing 4-inch heels is:
     \[
     3 \text{ women} \times 4 \text{ inches} = 12 \text{ inches}
     \]
   - The total height contributed by the women wearing 2-inch heels is:
     \[
     3 \text{ women} \times 2 \text{ inches} = 6 \text{ inches}
     \]

3. **Calculate the Combined Total Height of All Heels:**
   - Add the total heights from both groups:
     \[
     12 \text{ inches} + 6 \text{ inches} = 18 \text{ inches}
     \]

4. **Calculate the Average Height of the Heels:**
   - To find the average height, divide the total height by the total number of women:
     \[
     \text{Average height} = \frac{18 \text{ inches}}{6 \text{ women}} = 3 \text{ inches}
     \]

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The average height of the heels worn by the women at the cocktail party is \(3\) inches.

Therefore, the final answer is that the average height of heels at this party is **3 inches**.
