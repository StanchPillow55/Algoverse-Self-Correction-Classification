To solve this problem, we need to analyze the information provided in the given paragraph and identify the key components that make up the composition of the skin.

The paragraph provides the following information about the composition of the skin:

1. The dermis is the inner layer of the skin.
2. The dermis contains blood vessels and nerve endings.
3. The nerve endings in the dermis are responsible for the skin's sensitivity, allowing us to sense pain, pressure, and temperature.
4. When you cut your finger, it means you have cut the dermis layer and damaged the blood vessels.
5. The dermis also contains hair follicles and two types of glands.
6. Hair follicles are structures where hairs originate, and each hair grows out of a follicle.
7. Oil glands produce an oily substance that is secreted into the hair follicles.

Based on this information, the key components that make up the composition of the skin are:

1. Blood vessels
2. Nerve endings
3. Hair follicles
4. Oil glands

The paragraph does not mention the epidermis, which is the outer layer of the skin, but it
