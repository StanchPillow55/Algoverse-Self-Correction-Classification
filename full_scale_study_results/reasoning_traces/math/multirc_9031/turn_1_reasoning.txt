To answer the question "What is the composition of the skin?", I will break down the information provided in the given paragraph and identify the key components that make up the skin.

The paragraph discusses the dermis, which is the inner layer of the skin. It states that the dermis contains the following components:

1. Blood vessels
2. Nerve endings
3. Hair follicles
4. Two types of glands (oil glands)

The paragraph also mentions that when you cut your finger, it means you have cut the dermis layer and damaged the blood vessels, which causes bleeding. Additionally, the nerve endings in the dermis layer are responsible for the sensation of pain.

Furthermore, the paragraph explains that hair follicles are structures where hairs originate, and that hair passes up through the epidermis (the outer layer of the skin) and extends above the skin surface. It also states that oil glands produce an oily substance that is secreted into the hair follicles.

Based on the information provided in the paragraph, the key components that make up the composition of the skin are:

1. Blood vessels
2. Nerve endings
3. Hair follicles
4. Oil
