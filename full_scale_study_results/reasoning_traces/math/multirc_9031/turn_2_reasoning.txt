Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To determine the composition of the skin based on the information provided in the paragraph, I will go through the details step-by-step:

1. The paragraph states that the dermis is the inner layer of the skin.
2. The dermis contains the following components:
   a. Blood vessels
   b. Nerve endings
   c. Hair follicles
   d. Two types of glands (oil glands)

3. The paragraph explains that the nerve endings in the dermis are responsible for the skin's sensitivity, allowing us to sense pain, pressure, and temperature.
4. When the skin is cut, it means the dermis layer has been damaged, and the blood vessels within the dermis have been cut, causing bleeding.
5. The paragraph also mentions that hair follicles are structures where hairs originate, and that hair passes up through the epidermis (the outer layer of the skin) and extends above the skin surface.
6. Additionally, the paragraph states that oil glands produce an oily substance that is secreted into the hair follicles.

Based on the information provided in the paragraph, the main components of the skin's composition are:

1. Hair
