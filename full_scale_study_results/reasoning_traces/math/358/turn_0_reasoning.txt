==================================================

Marisa gets $5 as pocket money every day. She spends some of this money on lollipops.

First, let's calculate how much money Marisa spends on lollipops each day. Each lollipop costs 25 cents, and she buys 4 lollipops a day. So, the total cost of the lollipops is 4 lollipops * 25 cents = 100 cents. 

Since 100 cents is equal to $1, Marisa spends $1 on lollipops each day.

Now, let's calculate how much money Marisa saves each day. She gets $5 and spends $1, so she saves $5 - $1 = $4 each day.

Finally, let's calculate how much money Marisa saves in 5 days. She saves $4 each day, so in 5 days, she saves 5 days * $4/day = $20.

So, Marisa puts $20 in her piggy bank if she saves for 5 days.
