Question ID: 358
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine how much money Marisa saves each day and then calculate the total savings over 5 days.

1. **Calculate Daily Expenses:**
   - Marisa buys 4 lollipops each day.
   - Each lollipop costs 25 cents.
   - Total cost for lollipops per day = 4 lollipops × $0.25/lollipop = $1.00.

2. **Calculate Daily Savings:**
   - Marisa receives $5.00 as pocket money each day.
   - After buying lollipops, she spends $1.00.
   - Money left to save each day = $5.00 - $1.00 = $4.00.

3. **Calculate Total Savings Over 5 Days:**
   - Marisa saves $4.00 each day.
   - Total savings over 5 days = $4.00/day × 5 days = $20.00.

Therefore, Marisa puts $20.00 in her piggy bank after saving for 5 days.

**Final Answer:** $20.00
