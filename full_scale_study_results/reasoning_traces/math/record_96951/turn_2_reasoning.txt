Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, I will break it down step-by-step:

1. The passage mentions that heavy security was in place in central Beijing on the 25th anniversary of the Tiananmen Square pro-democracy protests. This suggests that the government was trying to prevent any public commemoration or discussion of the events.

2. The passage also states that the government has largely ignored the relatives' demands for an admission of wrongdoing. This indicates that the government is trying to suppress information and discussion about the Tiananmen Square incident.

3. Based on this context, it is reasonable to infer that the foreign media in China have likely been warned not to meet with dissidents or report on issues related to the anniversary. The government would want to control the narrative and prevent any critical coverage of the events.

Therefore, the final answer is:

The foreign media in China have been warned not to meet with dissidents or report on issues related to the 25th anniversary of the Tiananmen Square pro-democracy protests.
