Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, I need to carefully read the information provided in the paragraph and identify the details about the work "De la democratie en Amerique (1835/1840)".

The paragraph states:
"De la democratie en Amerique (1835/1840) - Democracy in America. It was published in two volumes, the first in 1835, the second in 1840."

This clearly indicates that the work "De la democratie en Amerique (1835/1840)" was published in two volumes, with the first volume published in 1835 and the second volume published in 1840.

Therefore, the final answer is:
De la democratie en Amerique (1835/1840) has two volumes.
