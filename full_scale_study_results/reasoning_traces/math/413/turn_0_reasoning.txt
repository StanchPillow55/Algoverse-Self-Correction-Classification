Question ID: 413
Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to find out how many candles are likely to explode. Since Marcy's candles are 99% guaranteed not to explode, that means there's a 1% chance that they will explode. 

1% of 50000 candles is 500. 

So, out of the 50000 candles, we can expect about 500 of them to explode.

Next, we need to find out how many of these exploding candles also have the defect that makes them smell like wet dog. We know that 5% of the dangerous candles have this defect.

5% of 500 candles is 25.

So, out of the 50000 candles Marcy makes, we can expect about 25 of them to both explode and smell like wet dog.
