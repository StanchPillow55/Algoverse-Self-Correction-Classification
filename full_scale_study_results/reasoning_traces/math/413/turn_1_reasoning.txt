Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine how many of Marcy's candles both smell like wet dog and explode. Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Understanding the Guarantee**: 
   - Marcy's candles are marketed as 99% guaranteed not to explode. This means that 1% of the candles do explode. 

2. **Calculating the Number of Exploding Candles**:
   - Marcy makes 50,000 candles in total.
   - The percentage of candles that explode is 1% of 50,000.
   - Calculation: 
     \[
     \text{Number of exploding candles} = 0.01 \times 50,000 = 500
     \]

3. **Understanding the Defect**:
   - 5% of the candles that explode also have a defect that makes them smell like wet dog.

4. **Calculating the Number of Exploding Candles that Smell Like Wet Dog**:
   - We need to find 5% of the 500 exploding candles.
   - Calculation:
     \[
     \text{Number of exploding candles that smell like wet dog} = 0.05 \times 500 = 25
     \]

5. **Conclusion**:
   - Therefore, 25 of Marcy's candles both smell like wet dog and explode.

**Final Answer**: 25 candles both smell like wet dog and explode.
