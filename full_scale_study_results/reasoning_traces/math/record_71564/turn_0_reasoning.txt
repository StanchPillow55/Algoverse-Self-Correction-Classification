==================================================

To solve this problem, I will need to analyze the given passage and determine the key information related to the query.

The passage mentions that French Prime Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault criticized the UK's economic policy, saying it has caused "mass poverty". However, the passage also notes that Ayrault did not acknowledge that France's own economy was in crisis.

The query specifically asks about Mr. Ayrault's criticism of @placeholder's zero-hour contracts. However, the passage does not mention any specific company or zero-hour contracts. It only states that Ayrault painted a picture of the UK plagued by "extremes of wealth and poverty", without providing any details about the specific policies or practices he was criticizing.

Since the passage does not contain any information about @placeholder or zero-hour contracts, I do not have enough information to provide a complete answer to the query. The passage does not give any details about the specific criticism Ayrault made regarding zero-hour contracts.

Without the necessary information from the passage, I cannot show the complete reasoning and work to answer the query. The passage does not provide the details required to solve this problem.

Final answer: The passage does not contain enough information
