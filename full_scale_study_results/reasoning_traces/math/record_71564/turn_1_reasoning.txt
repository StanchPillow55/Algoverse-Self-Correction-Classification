To solve this problem, I will need to analyze the given passage and determine the key information relevant to answering the query.

The passage discusses the French Prime Minister, Jean-Marc Ayrault, criticizing the UK's economic policy, which he claims has caused "mass poverty." Ayrault states that France would "never copy" the UK's approach.

Therefore, the final answer is:

The passage does not provide any information about Jean-Marc Ayrault's criticism of
