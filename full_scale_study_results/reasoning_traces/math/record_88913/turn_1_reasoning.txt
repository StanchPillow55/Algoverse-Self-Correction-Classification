Unfortunately, there is no math problem or calculation involved in the given passage. The passage is a news article about the events that occurred during the practice sessions of the German Grand Prix in Formula 1 racing. It does not contain any numerical information or a math-related query that I can solve.

The passage discusses the performance of various drivers, including Pastor Maldonado, Jenson Button, Lewis Hamilton, and Michael Schumacher, during the two practice sessions. It also mentions the wet track conditions and Schumacher's crash into a wall. However, there is no information about any team unveiling upgrades to their car or a math-related problem to solve.

Without a specific math-related question or problem statement, I am unable to provide a step-by-step solution or final answer.
