==================================================

Unfortunately, there is no math problem or calculation involved in the given passage. The passage is a news article about the events that occurred during the practice sessions for the German Grand Prix in Formula 1 racing. It does not contain any numerical information or a math-based query that I can solve.

The passage discusses the performance of various drivers, including Pastor Maldonado, Jenson Button, Lewis Hamilton, and Michael Schumacher, during the two practice sessions. It also mentions the wet track conditions and Schumacher's crash. However, there is no information about any team unveiling upgrades to their car or a math-based problem to solve.

Without a specific math-based question or problem statement, I am unable to provide any step-by-step reasoning, calculations, or a final answer. The passage is purely informative and does not contain a math-based problem for me to solve. Please let me know if you have a different question or problem that I can assist with.
