==================================================

Unfortunately, there is no mathematical problem or calculation to solve in the given passage. The passage is a news article about the events that occurred during the practice sessions of the German Grand Prix in Formula 1 racing. It does not contain any numerical information or a specific question that requires mathematical problem-solving.

The passage mentions the fastest drivers in the two practice sessions, as well as the struggles of Michael Schumacher, who crashed his car. However, there is no information about any team unveiling upgrades to their car or attempting to rescue a disappointing season.

Since the passage does not provide any numerical data or a specific math-related question, I am unable to show any step-by-step work or reasoning to solve a math problem. The passage is simply a news report about the events of the Formula 1 practice sessions, and does not contain a mathematical problem for me to solve.
