First, let's calculate how much money John made from selling his Lego sets. He sold each set for $15, and he had 13 sets, so he made 13 * $15 = $<<13*15=195>>195.

Next, let's calculate how much money John spent on video games. He bought 8 games, each costing $20, so he spent 8 * $20 = $<<8*20=160>>160 on video games.

John had $5 left after buying the video games, so the total amount of money he had after selling the Lego sets and before buying the video games was $160 (the cost of the video games) + $5 (the money left) = $<<160+5=165>>165.

If John made $195 from selling his Lego sets and he had $165 after buying the video games, then he must have spent $195 (the money he made from selling the Lego sets) - $165 (the money he had after buying the video games) = $<<195-165=30>>30 on something else.

Since each Lego set is sold for $15, and he spent $30 on something else, then he must have sold $30 / $15 = <<30/15=2>>2 Lego sets for that.

So, John initially had 13 Lego sets, and he sold 2 for something else, so he still has 13 - 2 = <<13-2=11>>11 Lego sets left.

Therefore, John still has 11 Lego sets.
