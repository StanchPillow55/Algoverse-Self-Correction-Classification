Question ID: 37
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to calculate how much money John made from selling his Lego sets. He sold each set for $15, and he had 13 sets. So, we multiply 13 by 15 to find the total amount of money he made:

13 sets * $15/set = $195

Next, we need to calculate how much money John spent on video games. He bought 8 games, each costing $20. So, we multiply 8 by 20 to find the total cost of the video games:

8 games * $20/game = $160

John also had $5 left after buying the video games. So, we add this to the total cost of the video games to find out how much money John had after selling his Lego sets:

$160 (for games) + $5 (leftover) = $165

Now, we subtract the amount of money John had after buying the video games from the total amount of money he made from selling his Lego sets. This will tell us how much money John has left:

$195 (from selling Lego sets) - $165 (spent on games and leftover) = $30

Since each Lego set is sold for $15, we divide the remaining money by the price of each Lego set to find out how many Lego sets John still has:

$30 / $15/set = 2 sets

So, John still has 2 Lego sets.
