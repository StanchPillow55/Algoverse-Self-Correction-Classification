To solve this problem, we first need to calculate the total amount of money John made from selling his Lego sets. 

He sold each Lego set for $15, and he had 13 sets. So, the total amount of money he made is 13 sets * $15/set = $195.

Next, we need to calculate the total amount of money John spent on video games. 

He bought 8 video games, each costing $20. So, the total amount of money he spent on video games is 8 games * $20/game = $160.

We also know that John has $5 left after buying the video games. 

So, the total amount of money he had after selling the Lego sets and buying the video games is $160 (for the video games) + $5 (leftover) = $165.

Now, we can calculate how much money John spent on Lego sets that he didn't sell. 

We subtract the total amount of money he had after buying the video games and having $5 left from the total amount of money he made from selling the Lego sets. 

So, the amount of money he spent on unsold Lego sets is $195 (from selling Lego sets) - $165 (after buying video games and having $5 left) = $30.

Since each Lego set costs $15, we can find out how many Lego sets John still has by dividing the amount of money he spent on unsold Lego sets by the cost of each Lego set. 

So, the number of Lego sets John still has is $30 / $15/set = 2 sets.

Therefore, John still has 2 Lego sets.
