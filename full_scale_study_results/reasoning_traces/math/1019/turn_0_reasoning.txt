Question ID: 1019
Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

The hotel started with 100 guests. 

In the morning, 24 guests checked out early, so we subtract these from the total: 
100 - 24 = 76 guests remaining.

15 guests elected for a late checkout, so they are still in the hotel. 

In the afternoon, twice as many people checked in as those who opted for a late checkout. This means 2 * 15 = 30 people checked in. 

We add these to the total number of guests: 
76 + 30 = 106 guests.

In the evening, 7 more people checked in. We add these to the total: 
106 + 7 = 113 guests.

So, the hotel now has 113 guests.
