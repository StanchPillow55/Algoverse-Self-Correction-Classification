Question ID: 1019
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. The hotel started with 100 guests.
2. 24 guests checked out early, so we subtract 24 from 100: 100 - 24 = 76 guests remaining.
3. 15 guests elected for a late checkout, so they are still in the hotel. So, the number of guests is still 76.
4. In the afternoon, twice as many people checked in as those who opted for a late checkout. This means 2 * 15 = 30 people checked in. We add these to the remaining guests: 76 + 30 = 106 guests.
5. 7 more people checked in after dinner, so we add these to the current number of guests: 106 + 7 = 113 guests.

So, the hotel now has 113 guests.
