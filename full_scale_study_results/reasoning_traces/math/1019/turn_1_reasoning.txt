Question ID: 1019
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. The hotel started with 100 guests.
2. 24 guests checked out early, so we subtract 24 from 100: 100 - 24 = 76 guests remaining.
3. 15 guests elected for a late checkout, so they are still in the hotel. The total number of guests remains 76.
4. In the afternoon, twice as many people checked in as those who opted for a late checkout. This means 2 * 15 = 30 people checked in. We add these to the remaining guests: 76 + 30 = 106 guests.
5. After dinner, 7 more people checked in. We add these to the current total: 106 + 7 = 113 guests.

So, the hotel now has 113 guests.
