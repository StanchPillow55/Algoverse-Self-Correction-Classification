Dataset Type: math
==================================================

Max bought 16 snowflake stamps.

He bought 3 more truck stamps than snowflake stamps, so he bought 16 + 3 = <<16+3=19>>19 truck stamps.

He bought 9 fewer rose stamps than truck stamps, so he bought 19 - 9 = <<19-9=10>>10 rose stamps.

To find the total number of stamps Max bought, we add the number of each type of stamp together: 16 snowflake + 19 truck + 10 rose = <<16+19+10=45>>45 stamps.

So, Max bought 45 stamps in all.
