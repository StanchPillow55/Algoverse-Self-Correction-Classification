==================================================

Let's denote the number of strawberry cubes as S and the number of blueberry cubes as B. 

From the problem, we know that the number of blueberry cubes is equal to 5 times the number of strawberry cubes minus 4. This can be written as:

B = 5S - 4

We also know that the total number of cubes is 116. This can be written as:

S + B = 116

We can substitute the first equation into the second equation to solve for S. 

S + (5S - 4) = 116
6S - 4 = 116
6S = 120
S = 20

Substitute S = 20 into the first equation to find B:

B = 5*20 - 4 = 96

So, Mary makes 96 blueberry cubes.
