==================================================

First, let's find out how many letters were delivered on Tuesday. 

According to the problem, on Tuesday, the post office delivered 17 more than one-fifth as many as Monday. 

One-fifth of the number of letters delivered on Monday is 425/5 = 85 letters.

So, on Tuesday, the post office delivered 85 + 17 = 102 letters.

Next, let's find out how many letters were delivered on Wednesday. 

The problem states that on Wednesday, the post office delivered 5 more than twice as many as they delivered on Tuesday. 

Twice the number of letters delivered on Tuesday is 2*102 = 204 letters.

So, on Wednesday, the post office delivered 204 + 5 = 209 letters.

Finally, to find the total number of letters delivered from Monday to Wednesday, we add the number of letters delivered each day:

425 (Monday) + 102 (Tuesday) + 209 (Wednesday) = 736 letters.

So, the post office delivered 736 letters from Monday to Wednesday.
