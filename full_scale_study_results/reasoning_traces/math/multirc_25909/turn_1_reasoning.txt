Question ID: multirc_25909
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To answer the question "Who would not let her return the toys?", we need to analyze the information provided in the given paragraph.

The relevant information is:
"It was huge and inefficient, and she should never have spent so many pesos on a toy, but Papa would not let her return it."

From this, we can infer that:
1. Mama bought a teal blue Tiempo Capturado (a stopbox) for Papa's birthday.
2. Mama thought the stopbox was huge, inefficient, and too expensive.
3. Mama wanted to return the stopbox, but Papa would not let her.

Therefore, the answer to the question is:
Papa would not let her return the toys.

The reasoning is straightforward and based on the information provided in the paragraph.
