Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine the missing word in the given query.

Given information:
- The passage mentions that Letizia, who is now the Queen of Spain, attended a conference in Palma, Mallorca, to boost volunteering.
- The query states that Letizia has won plaudits for her chic sense of style since becoming @placeholder in June this year.

The missing word in the query is the title that Letizia has held since June this year, which is "Queen".

Therefore, the complete query should be:

"Stylish: Letizia has won plaudits for her chic sense of style since becoming Queen in June this year."

The reasoning and work are as follows:

1. The passage states that Letizia joined the Spanish throne in June this year, which means she became the Queen of Spain.
2. The query mentions that Letizia has won plaudits for her chic sense of style since becoming @placeholder in June this year.
3. The missing word in the query is the title that Letizia has held since June this year, which is "Queen".
4.
