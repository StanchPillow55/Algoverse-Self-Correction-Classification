Question ID: record_34060
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine the missing word in the query.

Given information:
- The passage mentions that Letizia has attended the State Volunteering Congress twice, once last year as Princess Letizia and once this year as Queen Letizia.
- The query states that Letizia has won plaudits for her chic sense of style since becoming @placeholder in June this year.

Based on the information provided, the missing word in the query is "Queen".

Reasoning:
1. The passage states that Letizia ascended to the Spanish throne in June this year, becoming Queen Letizia.
2. The query mentions that Letizia has won plaudits for her chic sense of style since becoming @placeholder in June this year.
3. Since Letizia became Queen in June this year, the missing word in the query is "Queen".

Therefore, the complete query should be:

"Stylish: Letizia has won plaudits for her chic sense of style since becoming Queen in June this year."
