==================================================

First, let's calculate the total cost of the suits. James buys 10 suits at $750 each, so the total cost of the suits is 10 * $750 = $7500.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the dress pants. We know that the dress pants cost 1/5 the cost of the suits, so each pair of dress pants costs $750 / 5 = $150. James buys 10 pairs of dress pants, so the total cost of the dress pants is 10 * $150 = $1500.

Now, let's calculate the cost of the dress shirts. James buys 3 dress shirts per suit, so he buys 3 * 10 = 30 dress shirts. Each dress shirt costs $60, so the total cost of the dress shirts is 30 * $60 = $1800.

Finally, let's add up the cost of the suits, dress pants, and dress shirts to find the total cost. The total cost is $7500 (suits) + $1500 (dress pants) + $1800 (dress shirts) = $10800.

So, James spent a total of $10800 on his new wardrobe.
