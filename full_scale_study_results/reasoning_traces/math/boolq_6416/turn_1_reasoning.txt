Question ID: boolq_6416
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To determine whether empty net goals count for the plus-minus statistic, we need to carefully consider the context and the definition of the plus-minus statistic.

Given information:
- The plus-minus statistic is used to measure a player's impact on the game, represented by the difference between their team's total scoring versus their opponent's when the player is in the game.
- In ice hockey, the plus-minus statistic is increased by one (``plus'') for those players on the ice for the team scoring the goal, and decreased by one (``minus'') for those players on the ice for the team allowing the goal.
- Power play or penalty shot goals are excluded from the plus-minus calculation.
- The question states that an empty net does not matter for the calculation of plus-minus.

Reasoning:
Based on the given information, the key point is that the question states that an empty net does not matter for the calculation of plus-minus. This means that empty net goals, whether scored by the team or allowed by the team, are not included in the plus-minus calculation.

The rationale behind this is that an empty net goal is not a true reflection of a player's impact
