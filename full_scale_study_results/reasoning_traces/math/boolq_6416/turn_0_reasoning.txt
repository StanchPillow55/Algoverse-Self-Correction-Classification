==================================================

To determine whether empty net goals count for the plus-minus statistic, we need to carefully consider the context and the definition of the plus-minus statistic.

Given information:
- The plus-minus statistic measures a player's impact on the game, represented by the difference between their team's total scoring versus their opponent's when the player is in the game.
- In ice hockey, the plus-minus statistic is increased by one (``plus'') for those players on the ice for the team scoring the goal, and decreased by one (``minus'') for those players on the ice for the team allowing the goal.
- Power play or penalty shot goals are excluded from the plus-minus calculation.

The question specifically asks whether empty net goals count for the plus-minus statistic.

Reasoning:
1. An empty net goal is a goal scored when the defending team has removed their goaltender from the ice, typically in an attempt to gain an extra attacker and score a goal.
2. The plus-minus statistic is meant to measure a player's impact on the game while they are on the ice. When the defending team's goaltender is pulled, the players on the ice are not
