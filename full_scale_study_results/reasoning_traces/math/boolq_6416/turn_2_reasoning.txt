==================================================

To determine whether empty net goals count for the plus-minus statistic, we need to carefully consider the context and the definition of the plus-minus statistic.

The given context states that "An empty net does not matter for the calculation of plus--minus." This means that empty net goals are excluded from the plus-minus calculation.

The reasoning behind this is as follows:

1. The plus-minus statistic is intended to measure a player's impact on the game, specifically their goal differential when they are on the ice.
2. An empty net goal is scored when the defending team has pulled their goaltender in an attempt to score an extra attacker goal. This is a strategic decision by the team, not a direct result of the players on the ice.
3. Including empty net goals in the plus-minus calculation would not accurately reflect the player's impact on the game, as the goal was scored with an extra attacker, not due to the player's individual performance.

Therefore, based on the given context and the definition of the plus-minus statistic, the answer is:

No, empty net goals do not count for the plus-minus statistic.

The plus-minus statistic is calculated by considering
