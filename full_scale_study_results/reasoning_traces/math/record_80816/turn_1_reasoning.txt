==================================================

I apologize, but there does not appear to be a math problem or any numerical information in the given passage. The passage is a news article about two suicide bombings that occurred in Damascus, Syria, killing 55 people and injuring 370 others. It does not mention anything about a brokered ceasefire. Without any numerical data or a specific math problem to solve, I am unable to provide a step-by-step solution. The passage is informative, but does not contain a math problem for me to work through. Please provide a math-related question or problem for me to solve.
