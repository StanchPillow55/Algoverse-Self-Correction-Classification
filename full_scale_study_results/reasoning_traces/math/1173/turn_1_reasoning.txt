Question ID: 1173
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, let's find out how many pods are in the special size box. Since it has 20% more pods than the regular box, we multiply 100 pods by 20% (or 0.2).

100 pods * 0.2 = 20 pods

So, the special size box has 100 pods + 20 pods = 120 pods.

Since the special size box costs $12, we can find out the cost per pod by dividing the total cost by the number of pods.

$12 / 120 pods = $0.10 per pod

Finally, to find out how many dishwashing cycles we can run for $1, we divide $1 by the cost per pod.

$1 / $0.10 per pod = 10 cycles

So, with the new box, you can run 10 dishwashing cycles for $1.
