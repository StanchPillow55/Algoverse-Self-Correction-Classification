Question ID: 1173
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to find out how many pods are in the special size box. Since it has 20% more pods than the regular box, we multiply 100 by 20% (or 0.20) to get 20. Adding this to the original 100 pods, we find that the special size box has 120 pods.

Next, we need to find out how many pods we get for $1. Since the special size box costs $12 and contains 120 pods, we divide 120 by 12 to get 10. 

Therefore, for $1, we can run 10 dishwashing cycles with the new box.
