Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to find out how many pods are in the special size box. Since it has 20% more pods than the regular box, we multiply the number of pods in the regular box by 1.20 (100% + 20% = 120% = 1.20 as a decimal).

100 pods * 1.20 = 120 pods

So, the special size box contains 120 pods.

Next, we need to find out how many pods we can get for $1. Since the box costs $12, we divide the number of pods in the box by the cost of the box.

120 pods / $12 = 10 pods per $1

Therefore, since we use 1 pod per cycle, we can run 10 dishwashing cycles for $1 with the new box.
