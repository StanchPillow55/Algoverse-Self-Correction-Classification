Question ID: record_48639
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine the missing word in the given statement.

Given information:
- The passage mentions that the blue wrap dress worn by Kate Middleton for her engagement announcement in 2010 was subsequently reproduced and sold out repeatedly.
- The passage also mentions that the dress has been offered up to a new market, specifically for pregnant women, by a maternity fashion website.

The statement suggests that unlike traditional maternity clothes, the @placeholder dress will become a wardrobe classic.

Based on the context provided in the passage, the missing word is "adaptable". This is because the passage indicates that the dress has been adapted to fit a growing bump, which means it can be worn both during pregnancy and after the baby arrives.

Therefore, the complete statement is:

"Unlike traditional maternity clothes that cannot be worn once the baby arrives, an adaptable dress will become a wardrobe classic."
