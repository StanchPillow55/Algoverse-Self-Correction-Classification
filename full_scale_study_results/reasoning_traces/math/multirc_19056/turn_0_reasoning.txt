==================================================

To answer the question "Where was United 93 presumably headed?", we need to analyze the information provided in the given paragraph.

The key details from the paragraph are:

1. At 10:02, the communicators in the shelter began receiving reports from the Secret Service of an inbound aircraft, presumably hijacked, heading toward Washington.
2. That aircraft was United 93.
3. The Secret Service was getting this information directly from the FAA, which may have been tracking the progress of United 93 on a display that showed its projected path to Washington, not its actual radar return.

Based on this information, the paragraph clearly states that United 93 was presumably headed towards Washington.

Therefore, the final answer is:

Washington

The reasoning and work are as follows:
1. The paragraph states that the communicators in the shelter received reports of an inbound aircraft, presumably hijacked, heading towards Washington.
2. This aircraft was identified as United 93.
3. The Secret Service was getting this information from the FAA, which was tracking the projected path of United 93 to Washington, not its actual radar return.
4. Therefore, the paragraph indicates that United 93
