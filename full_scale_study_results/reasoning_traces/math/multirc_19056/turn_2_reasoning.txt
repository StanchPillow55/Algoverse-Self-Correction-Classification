Question ID: multirc_19056
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, I will go through the key details in the paragraph and use them to determine where United 93 was presumably headed.

Key details:
- The Vice President spoke to the President about the rules of engagement for the CAP (Combat Air Patrol).
- The President had authorized the shootdown of hijacked aircraft.
- At 10:02, the communicators in the shelter began receiving reports from the Secret Service of an inbound aircraft, presumably hijacked, heading toward Washington.
- That aircraft was United 93.
- The Secret Service was relying on projections and was not aware the plane was already down in Pennsylvania.

Based on these details, the paragraph indicates that United 93 was presumably headed towards Washington, D.C. The Secret Service was receiving reports of an inbound, presumably hijacked, aircraft heading towards Washington, and this aircraft was identified as United 93.

Therefore, the final answer is:
United 93 was presumably headed towards Washington.
