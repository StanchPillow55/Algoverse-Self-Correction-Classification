==================================================

Octavia is using three different sizes of t-shirts to make her quilt. To find out the total square footage of the quilt, we need to multiply the number of each size of t-shirt by the square footage that size provides, and then add all those amounts together.

First, let's calculate the total square footage provided by the small t-shirts. Each small t-shirt provides 3 square feet of fabric, and she's using 11 of them. So, the total square footage from the small t-shirts is 3 square feet/shirt * 11 shirts = 33 square feet.

Next, let's calculate the total square footage provided by the medium t-shirts. Each medium t-shirt provides 4 square feet of fabric, and she's using 8 of them. So, the total square footage from the medium t-shirts is 4 square feet/shirt * 8 shirts = 32 square feet.

Finally, let's calculate the total square footage provided by the large t-shirts. Each large t-shirt provides 6 square feet of fabric, and she's using 6 of them. So, the total square footage from the large t-shirts is 6 square feet/shirt * 6 shirts = 36 square feet.

Now we just need to add all these amounts together to find the total square footage of the quilt. The total square footage is 33 square feet (from the small shirts) + 32 square feet (from the medium shirts) + 36 square feet (from the large shirts) = 101 square feet.

So, the quilt that Octavia is making for her sister will be 101 square feet.
