==================================================

The total number of sandwiches the family eats in a day is the sum of the sandwiches each person eats. 

So, we add the number of sandwiches the man eats (5), the number of sandwiches his wife eats (4), and the number of sandwiches their son eats (2). 

5 sandwiches/day (man) + 4 sandwiches/day (wife) + 2 sandwiches/day (son) = 11 sandwiches/day (family)

This is the number of sandwiches the family eats in one day. 

To find out how many sandwiches the family eats in one week, we need to multiply this daily total by the number of days in a week. 

There are 7 days in a week, so we multiply:

11 sandwiches/day * 7 days/week = 77 sandwiches/week

So, the family eats 77 sandwiches in one week.
