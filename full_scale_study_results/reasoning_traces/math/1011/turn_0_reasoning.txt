==================================================

The tank's capacity is 18000 gallons.

On the first day, Wanda filled 1/4 of the tank's capacity with water. So, she pumped 1/4 * 18000 = 4500 gallons of water into the tank.

On the first day, Ms. B pumped 3/4 as much water as Wanda pumped into the tank. So, she pumped 3/4 * 4500 = 3375 gallons of water into the tank.

On the second day, Wanda pumped 2/3 of the amount of water she pumped on the previous day. So, she pumped 2/3 * 4500 = 3000 gallons of water into the tank.

On the second day, Ms. B only pumped 1/3 of the number of gallons she pumped on the first day. So, she pumped 1/3 * 3375 = 1125 gallons of water into the tank.

In total, Wanda and Ms. B pumped 4500 + 3375 + 3000 + 1125 = 12000 gallons of water into the tank.

The tank's capacity is 18000 gallons, so the amount of water remaining for the tank to be full is 18000 - 12000 = 6000 gallons.

Therefore, there are 6000 gallons of water remaining for the tank to be full.
