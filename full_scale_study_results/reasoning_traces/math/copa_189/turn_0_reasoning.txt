==================================================

This is not a typical math problem. The question is asking about the effect of a given premise, which is a situation or event, rather than a mathematical calculation.

To solve this problem, we need to analyze the premise and the two given choices to determine the most likely effect.

Given premise:
The baby was wailing in his crib.

Possible effects:
Choice 1: The mother picked up the baby.
Choice 2: The baby crawled to the mother.

Therefore, the most likely effect of
