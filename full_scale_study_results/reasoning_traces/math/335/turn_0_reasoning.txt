Dataset Type: math
==================================================

Mason needs 30 ounces of sugar for each batch of suckers. So, to make 8 batches of suckers, he will need 30 ounces/batch * 8 batches = 240 ounces of sugar.

He also needs 70 ounces of sugar to make a batch of fudge. So, to make 1 batch of fudge, he will need 70 ounces/batch * 1 batch = 70 ounces of sugar.

To find out the total amount of sugar he needs, we add the amount of sugar needed for the suckers and the fudge together. 

So, 240 ounces (for the suckers) + 70 ounces (for the fudge) = 310 ounces.

Therefore, Mason needs 310 ounces of sugar to make 8 batches of suckers and 1 batch of fudge.
