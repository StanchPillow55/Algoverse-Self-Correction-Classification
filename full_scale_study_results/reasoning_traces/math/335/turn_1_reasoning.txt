Question ID: 335
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to multiply the number of batches Mason wants to make by the amount of sugar needed for each batch. 

First, let's calculate the amount of sugar needed for the suckers. Mason needs 30 ounces of sugar for one batch of suckers. So, for 8 batches, he would need:

30 ounces/batch * 8 batches = 240 ounces of sugar

Next, let's calculate the amount of sugar needed for the fudge. Mason needs 70 ounces of sugar for one batch of fudge. So, for 1 batch, he would need:

70 ounces/batch * 1 batch = 70 ounces of sugar

Finally, to find out the total amount of sugar Mason needs, we add the amount of sugar needed for the suckers and the fudge:

240 ounces (for suckers) + 70 ounces (for fudge) = 310 ounces

So, Mason needs 310 ounces of sugar to make 8 batches of suckers and 1 batch of fudge.
