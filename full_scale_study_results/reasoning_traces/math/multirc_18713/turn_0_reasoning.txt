==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to analyze the information provided in the given paragraph and identify the type of stored energy that atoms possess.

Reasoning:
1. The paragraph states that "The center of an atom is held together by powerful forces. This gives them a huge amount of stored energy."
2. It further explains that "This type of energy is called nuclear energy."
3. The paragraph also mentions that "This energy can be released and used to do work. This happens in nuclear power plants where they split apart the nucleus of an atom. This splitting apart is called nuclear fission."
4. Additionally, the paragraph discusses another type of nuclear energy that occurs in the Sun, called "nuclear fusion," where the nuclei of atoms are joined together.

Based on the information provided in the paragraph, the type of stored energy that atoms possess is nuclear energy.

Step-by-step work:
1. The paragraph clearly states that the type of energy stored in the center of an atom is called "nuclear energy."
2. The paragraph explains the two main processes that involve the release of nuclear energy: nuclear fission (splitting the nucleus) and nuclear fusion (joining the nuclei).
3. The paragraph also mentions that the
