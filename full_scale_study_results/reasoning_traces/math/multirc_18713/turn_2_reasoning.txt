==================================================

To solve this problem, I will go through the given paragraph step-by-step and extract the relevant information to arrive at the final answer.

Given information:
- The center of an atom is held together by powerful forces.
- This gives them a huge amount of stored energy.
- This type of energy is called nuclear energy.
- This energy can be released and used to do work.
- This happens in nuclear power plants where they split apart the nucleus of an atom, a process called nuclear fission.
- Another type of nuclear energy happens in the Sun, where the nuclei of the atoms are fused, or joined together, a process called nuclear fusion.
- Some of the Sun's energy travels to Earth, warming the planet and providing the energy for photosynthesis.

Based on the information provided in the paragraph, the type of stored energy that atoms have is nuclear energy.

The key evidence for this is:
1. The paragraph states that the center of an atom is held together by powerful forces, which gives them a "huge amount of stored energy."
2. This type of energy is specifically referred to as "nuclear energy."
3. The paragraph discusses two types of nuclear energy: nuclear f
