Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to find out how much water is used for industrial purposes in Colorado City. 

Colorado City uses 40% of the water from the Colorado River, and 80% of that is used for industrial purposes. So, we multiply 40% by 80% to find out how much water is used for industrial purposes.

40% * 80% = 32%

This means that 32% of the river's total water is used by the city for industrial purposes.

Next, we need to find out how much water is used for non-industrial purposes. 

Since Colorado City uses 40% of the river's total water, and we know that 32% of it is used for industrial purposes, we subtract the percentage used for industrial purposes from the total percentage used by the city to find out how much is used for non-industrial purposes.

40% - 32% = 8%

So, 8% of the river's total water is used by the city for non-industrial purposes. 

Therefore, the final answer is 8%.
