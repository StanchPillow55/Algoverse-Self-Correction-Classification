==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine what percentage of the Colorado River's total water is used by Colorado City for non-industrial purposes. Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Identify the total percentage of water used by Colorado City:**
   - Colorado City uses 40% of the water from the Colorado River.

2. **Determine the percentage of water used for industrial purposes:**
   - Of the 40% of the river's water that Colorado City uses, 80% is used for industrial purposes.

3. **Calculate the percentage of the river's total water used for industrial purposes:**
   - To find this, multiply the percentage of water used by the city by the percentage used for industrial purposes:
     \[
     40\% \times 80\% = 0.40 \times 0.80 = 0.32
     \]
   - This means 32% of the river's total water is used by Colorado City for industrial purposes.

4. **Determine the percentage of water used for non-industrial purposes:**
   - Since 32% of the river's total water is used for industrial purposes, the remaining portion of the 40% used by the city is for non-industrial purposes.
   - Calculate the percentage of the city's water usage that is non-industrial:
     \[
     100\% - 80\% = 20\%
     \]
   - Therefore, 20% of the 40% of the river's water used by the city is for non-industrial purposes.

5. **Calculate the percentage of the river's total water used for non-industrial purposes:**
   - Multiply the percentage of water used by the city by the percentage used for non-industrial purposes:
     \[
     40\% \times 20\% = 0.40 \times 0.20 = 0.08
     \]
   - This means 8% of the river's total water is used by Colorado City for non-industrial purposes.

**Final Answer:**
8% of the Colorado River's total water is used by Colorado City for non-industrial purposes.
