==================================================

Let's denote Angela's current age as A.

According to the problem, in four years, Angela will be three times as old as Brett is now. We know that Brett is currently 14 years old. So, in four years, Angela will be 3 * 14 = 42 years old.

However, we want to find out Angela's current age, not her age in four years. Since four years will pass, we need to subtract those four years from the age we calculated for Angela. 

So, A = 42 - 4 = 38 years old.

Therefore, Angela is currently 38 years old.
