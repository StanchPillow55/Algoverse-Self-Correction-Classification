Question ID: 197
Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

The total number of inhabitants in Soda is 23786. This total includes both men and women. To find out the number of children, we need to subtract the number of men and women from the total population.

The number of men is 8417 and the number of women is 9092. 

So, we add the number of men and women together:

8417 (men) + 9092 (women) = 17509 (total number of adults)

Now, we subtract this total number of adults from the total population to find out the number of children:

23786 (total population) - 17509 (total adults) = 6277

So, there are 6277 children in the city of Soda.
