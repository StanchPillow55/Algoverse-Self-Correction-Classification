Question ID: 197
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem of determining how many children are in the city of Soda, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Understand the Total Population**: 
   The total population of Soda is given as 23,786 inhabitants.

2. **Identify the Known Subgroups**:
   - The number of men is given as 8,417.
   - The number of women is given as 9,092.

3. **Calculate the Total Number of Adults**:
   To find the total number of adults (men and women combined), we add the number of men and women together:
   \[
   \text{Total adults} = \text{Number of men} + \text{Number of women} = 8,417 + 9,092
   \]

4. **Perform the Addition**:
   \[
   8,417 + 9,092 = 17,509
   \]
   So, there are 17,509 adults in Soda.

5. **Calculate the Number of Children**:
   To find the number of children, we subtract the total number of adults from the total population:
   \[
   \text{Number of children} = \text{Total population} - \text{Total adults} = 23,786 - 17,509
   \]

6. **Perform the Subtraction**:
   \[
   23,786 - 17,509 = 6,277
   \]

Therefore, the number of children in Soda is 6,277.

**Final Answer**: There are 6,277 children in the city of Soda.
