Question ID: 197
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine the number of children in the city of Soda. We are given the total population and the number of men and women, and we need to find out how many children there are.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Total Population:**
   The total population of Soda is given as 23,786 inhabitants.

2. **Identify the Number of Men and Women:**
   - Number of men = 8,417
   - Number of women = 9,092

3. **Calculate the Total Number of Adults (Men and Women):**
   To find the total number of adults, we add the number of men and the number of women together:
   \[
   \text{Total number of adults} = \text{Number of men} + \text{Number of women}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total number of adults} = 8,417 + 9,092
   \]

4. **Perform the Addition:**
   \[
   8,417 + 9,092 = 17,509
   \]
   So, there are 17,509 adults in Soda.

5. **Calculate the Number of Children:**
   To find the number of children, we subtract the total number of adults from the total population:
   \[
   \text{Number of children} = \text{Total population} - \text{Total number of adults}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Number of children} = 23,786 - 17,509
   \]

6. **Perform the Subtraction:**
   \[
   23,786 - 17,509 = 6,277
   \]

Therefore, the number of children in the city of Soda is 6,277.

**Final Answer:**
There are 6,277 children in Soda.
