To solve this problem, we need to determine the missing word in the given statement.

Given information:
- The range was inspired by prohibition era flapper dresses and couture gowns.
- The missing word is "@placeholder".

Based on the context provided in the passage, the missing word should be a term that is reminiscent of the prohibition era and the glamorous fashion of that time period.

The passage mentions that the Miss Selfridge collection is "reminiscent of Bugsy Malone era", which refers to the 1920s prohibition era. It also states that the collection is inspired by "vintage-inspired" designs.

Therefore, the missing word that best fits the context is "Gatsby".

The Great Gatsby, a novel by F. Scott Fitzgerald, is a classic work that captures the essence of the prohibition era and the lavish, glamorous lifestyle of the wealthy during that time. The fashion and aesthetic of the Gatsby era is closely associated with the flapper dresses and couture gowns that inspired the Miss Selfridge collection.

Final answer:
The missing word is "Gatsby".
