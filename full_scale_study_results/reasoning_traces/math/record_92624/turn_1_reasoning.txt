==================================================

To solve this problem, I need to determine the missing word in the query based on the information provided in the passage.

The passage mentions that the Miss Selfridge collection was inspired by "vintage markets and the brand's archive" and is "reminiscent of the Bugsy Malone era". This suggests that the collection was inspired by vintage or retro styles, particularly from the 1920s.

The query states that the range was inspired by "prohibition era flapper dresses and couture gowns", which aligns with the 1920s time period mentioned in the passage.

Therefore, the missing word in the query is likely "Gatsby", as the Great Gatsby is a classic novel and film that is set during the Prohibition era and features flapper fashion.

Final answer: The range was inspired by prohibition era flapper dresses and couture gowns - think modern day Gatsby.
