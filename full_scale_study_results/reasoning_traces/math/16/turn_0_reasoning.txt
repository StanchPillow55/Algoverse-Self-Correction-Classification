==================================================

The problem states that both trains travel the same distance each day, so we can simply add the distances together to find the total distance each train traveled.

On the first day, each train travels 80 miles westward. On the second day, each train travels 150 miles northwards.

To find the total distance, we add the distances from the two days together:

80 miles (westward) + 150 miles (northwards) = 230 miles

Therefore, each train traveled a total of 230 miles in the two days.
