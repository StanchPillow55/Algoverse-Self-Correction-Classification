Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine the total distance covered by each train over the two days of travel. Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Day 1: Traveling Westward
- Both trains travel 80 miles westward on the first day.

### Day 2: Traveling Northward
- On the second day, both trains travel 150 miles northward.

### Total Distance Calculation
To find the total distance covered by each train over the two days, we need to consider the path they have taken. The trains travel in two perpendicular directions: westward and then northward. This forms a right triangle where:
- The westward travel (80 miles) is one leg of the triangle.
- The northward travel (150 miles) is the other leg of the triangle.

The total distance covered by each train is the sum of the distances traveled on each day. However, if we are interested in the straight-line distance from the starting point to the final position, we would use the Pythagorean theorem. But since the problem asks for the total distance covered, we simply add the distances traveled each day.

### Calculation
1. **Distance on Day 1:** 80 miles (westward)
2. **Distance on Day 2:** 150 miles (northward)

The total distance covered by each train is the sum of the distances traveled on each day:
\[
\text{Total Distance} = \text{Distance on Day 1} + \text{Distance on Day 2} = 80 \text{ miles} + 150 \text{ miles} = 230 \text{ miles}
\]

### Conclusion
Each train covers a total distance of 230 miles over the two days. This is the sum of the distances traveled westward and northward.

**Final Answer:**
Each train covers a total distance of 230 miles in the two days.
