==================================================

To determine why Brazil declared independence when it did, I will analyze the key events and information provided in the paragraph:

1. The paragraph mentions that the "war left Portugal further weakened" after the early blows for independence and the war led by the Duke of Wellington.
2. It then states that "in 1822 its major empire outpost, Brazil, declared independence."
3. The paragraph also mentions a dispute over the crown between Pedro IV (who preferred to reign as Emperor of Brazil) and his brother Miguel.

Based on this information, the key reasons why Brazil declared independence in 1822 were:

1. The weakened state of Portugal after the wars for independence and the conflict led by the Duke of Wellington. This likely made it more difficult for Portugal to maintain control over its colonies, including Brazil.
2. The dispute over the crown between Pedro IV and Miguel, with Pedro preferring to reign as Emperor of Brazil rather than return to Portugal. This internal conflict within the Portuguese monarchy likely contributed to Brazil's decision to declare independence.

Therefore, the final answer is:

Brazil declared independence in 1822 because the wars had left Portugal further weakened, and there was a dispute over the crown between Pedro
