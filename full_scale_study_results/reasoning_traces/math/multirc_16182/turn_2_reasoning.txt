==================================================

To determine why Brazil declared independence when it did, I will analyze the relevant information provided in the paragraph:

1. The paragraph states that the "war left Portugal further weakened" after the Napoleonic Wars and the expulsion of the French by the Duke of Wellington's coalition forces.

2. It then states that "in 1822 its major empire outpost, Brazil, declared independence."

The key piece of information here is that the war left Portugal weakened, and it was in this context that Brazil declared independence in 1822.

The reasoning is that the weakened state of Portugal after the war made it more difficult for them to maintain control over their colonies, including Brazil. This created an opportunity for Brazil to declare independence, which it did in 1822.

Therefore, the final answer is:

Brazil declared independence in 1822 because the war had left Portugal further weakened, making it more difficult for Portugal to maintain control over its colonies, including Brazil.
