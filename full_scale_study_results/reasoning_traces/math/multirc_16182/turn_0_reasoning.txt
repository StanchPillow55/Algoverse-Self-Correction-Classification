==================================================

To determine why Brazil declared independence in 1822, we need to analyze the information provided in the paragraph.

The key details are:
1. The war (likely referring to the Napoleonic Wars and the subsequent conflict in Portugal) left Portugal further weakened.
2. In 1822, Brazil, which was a major empire outpost of Portugal, declared independence.

The paragraph suggests that the weakened state of Portugal after the war was a contributing factor to Brazil's declaration of independence in 1822.

Specifically, the paragraph states:
"The war left Portugal further weakened, and in 1822 its major empire outpost, Brazil, declared independence."

This implies that the weakened state of Portugal, as a result of the war, made it more difficult for Portugal to maintain control over its colonies, including Brazil. This created an opportunity for Brazil to declare its independence, which it did in 1822.

Therefore, the reason why Brazil declared independence in 1822 was that the war had left Portugal further weakened, making it harder for Portugal to hold onto its major empire outpost of Brazil.

Final answer:
Brazil declared independence in 1822 because the war had left Portugal further
