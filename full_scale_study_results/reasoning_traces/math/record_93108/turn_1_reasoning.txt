==================================================

To solve this problem, I will break down the key information provided in the passage and the query, and then use logical reasoning to formulate a response.

Given information:
- The House approved a compromise federal budget plan on a 332-94 vote.
- The plan is expected to pass the Senate, but the margin could be very close.
- The plan would cut the deficit and ease some sequester cuts.
- The query notes that Washington politicians have "been at each other's throats for a long time" over budget issues.
- The query also suggests that Republicans must first win some elections in order to get all the deficit reduction and spending cuts they want.

Reasoning:
1. The passage indicates that the compromise budget plan represents "rare convergence between the two parties on government spending." This suggests that the plan is a middle ground between the Republican and Democratic positions, rather than a complete victory for either side.
2. The close vote expected in the Senate implies that there is still significant disagreement and opposition to the plan, even though it passed the House with a comfortable margin.
3. The query's statement about Washington politicians being "at each other's throats for a long time" over budget issues reinfor
