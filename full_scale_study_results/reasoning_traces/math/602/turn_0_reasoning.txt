Dataset Type: math
==================================================

The plane travels at a speed of 1200 miles in 3 hours. This means the speed of the plane is 1200 miles / 3 hours = 400 miles per hour.

To find out how many additional hours it would take to travel an additional 2000 miles, we need to divide the distance by the speed.

So, 2000 miles / 400 miles per hour = 5 hours.

Therefore, it would take an additional 5 hours to travel an additional 2000 miles at the same rate.
