Question ID: 602
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

The plane travels 1200 miles in 3 hours, so its speed is 1200 miles / 3 hours = 400 miles/hour.

To find out how many additional hours it would take to travel an additional 2000 miles, we divide the additional distance by the speed. 

So, 2000 miles / 400 miles/hour = 5 hours.

Therefore, it would take an additional 5 hours to travel an additional 2000 miles at the same rate.
