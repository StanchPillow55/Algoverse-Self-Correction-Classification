Question ID: 1096
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, let's calculate the total number of days between March 1st and April 19th. 

March has 31 days, and there are 19 days in April up to and including the 19th. 

So, the total number of days is 31 (in March) + 19 (in April) = 50 days.

Billy takes 20% of these days off, so he works 80% of the days. 

To find out how many days he works, we multiply the total number of days by 80% (or 0.8): 

50 days * 0.8 = 40 days.

Billy can help 2 people per hour and he works for 3 hours a day. 

So, in one day, he can help 2 people/hour * 3 hours/day = 6 people/day.

Finally, to find out how many people he helps in total, we multiply the number of people he can help in one day by the number of days he works:

6 people/day * 40 days = 240 people.

So, Billy helps 240 people.
