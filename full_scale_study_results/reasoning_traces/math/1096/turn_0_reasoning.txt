Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, let's calculate the total number of days between March 1st and April 19th. 

March has 31 days, and if we add the 19 days in April, we get a total of 50 days.

Next, we need to calculate the number of days Billy takes off. He takes 20% of the days off, so we multiply 50 by 20% (or 0.20) to find out how many days he doesn't work.

50 * 0.20 = 10 days

So, Billy takes 10 days off. To find out how many days he works, we subtract these 10 days from the total 50 days.

50 - 10 = 40 days

Billy works for 40 days between March 1st and April 19th.

Now, we know that Billy can help 2 people per hour for 3 hours a day. So, in one day, he can help 2 * 3 = 6 people.

Finally, to find out how many people Billy helps in total, we multiply the number of people he helps in one day by the number of days he works.

6 * 40 = 240 people

So, Billy helps 240 people between March 1st and April 19th.
