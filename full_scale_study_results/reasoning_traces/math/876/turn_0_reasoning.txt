Question ID: 876
Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

Let's break down the problem into three parts, one for each type of question.

1. Multiple-Choice Questions:
Amy correctly answers 80% of the multiple-choice questions. There are 10 multiple-choice questions, so she correctly answers 0.80 * 10 = 8 questions. Since each question is worth 1 point, she scores 8 * 1 = 8 points from the multiple-choice questions.

2. True/False Questions:
Amy correctly answers 90% of the true/false questions. There are 20 true/false questions, so she correctly answers 0.90 * 20 = 18 questions. Since each question is worth 1 point, she scores 18 * 1 = 18 points from the true/false questions.

3. Long-Answer Questions:
Amy correctly answers 60% of the long-answer questions. There are 5 long-answer questions, so she correctly answers 0.60 * 5 = 3 questions. Since each question is worth 5 points, she scores 3 * 5 = 15 points from the long-answer questions.

Now, let's add up the points from all three types of questions to find the total score. Amy's total score is 8 (from multiple-choice) + 18 (from true/false) + 15 (from long-answer) = 41 points.

So, Amy scores 41 points on her history test.
