Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, let's calculate how many kilometers Micheal rode in the first four weeks. He rode his bike 5 times a week for 25 kilometers each time. So, in one week, he rode:

5 rides/week * 25 km/ride = 125 km/week

Since he did this for four weeks, the total distance he rode in the first four weeks is:

125 km/week * 4 weeks = 500 km

Next, let's calculate how many kilometers he rode in the next three weeks. He rode his bike 2 times a week for 60 kilometers each time. So, in one week, he rode:

2 rides/week * 60 km/ride = 120 km/week

Since he did this for three weeks, the total distance he rode in the next three weeks is:

120 km/week * 3 weeks = 360 km

Finally, to find the total distance he rode in seven weeks, we add the distances he rode in the first four weeks and the next three weeks:

500 km + 360 km = 860 km

So, Micheal rode a total of 860 kilometers in seven weeks.
