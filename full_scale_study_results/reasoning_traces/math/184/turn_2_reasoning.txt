Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, let's calculate the probability of Jerry rolling a number greater than 3 on a six-sided die. The numbers greater than 3 on a six-sided die are 4, 5, and 6. So, there are 3 favorable outcomes. The total number of outcomes when rolling a die is 6 (the numbers 1 through 6). Therefore, the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is 3/6 = 0.5 or 50%.

Next, let's calculate the probability of Jerry rolling two even numbers in a row. The even numbers on a six-sided die are 2, 4, and 6. So, there are 3 favorable outcomes for each roll. The total number of outcomes when rolling a die is 6. Therefore, the probability of rolling an even number is 3/6 = 0.5 or 50%. Since Jerry is rolling the die twice, the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25 or 25%.

Finally, to find out how much more likely it is that Jerry rolls a number greater than 3 than that he rolls two even numbers in a row, we subtract the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row from the probability of rolling a number greater than 3. 

So, 50% - 25% = 25%.

Therefore, it is 25% more likely that Jerry rolls a number greater than 3 than that he rolls two even numbers in a row.
