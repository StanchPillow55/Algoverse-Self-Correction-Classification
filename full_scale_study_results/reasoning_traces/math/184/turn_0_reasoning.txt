First, let's calculate the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 on a six-sided die. The numbers greater than 3 are 4, 5, and 6. So there are 3 favorable outcomes out of a total of 6 possible outcomes. The probability of this event is therefore 3/6 = 0.5 or 50%.

Next, let's calculate the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row. The even numbers on a six-sided die are 2, 4, and 6. So there are 3 favorable outcomes out of a total of 6 possible outcomes for each roll. The probability of rolling an even number on one roll is therefore 3/6 = 0.5 or 50%. 

However, since we want the probability of this happening twice in a row, we need to multiply these probabilities together. The probability of two independent events both occurring is the product of their individual probabilities. So the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25 or 25%.

Finally, to find out how much more likely it is to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two even numbers in a row, we subtract the smaller probability from the larger one. So 50% - 25% = 25%.

Therefore, it is 25% more likely that Jerry rolls a number greater than 3 than that he rolls two even numbers in a row.
