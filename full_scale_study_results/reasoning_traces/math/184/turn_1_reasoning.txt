First, let's calculate the probability of Jerry rolling a number greater than 3 on a six-sided die.

The numbers greater than 3 on a six-sided die are 4, 5, and 6. So, there are 3 favorable outcomes. The total number of outcomes when rolling a die is 6 (the numbers 1 through 6). 

The probability (P) of an event is calculated as the number of favorable outcomes (F) divided by the total number of outcomes (T). So, the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is:

P(Greater than 3) = F / T = 3 / 6 = 0.5

Now, let's calculate the probability of Jerry rolling two even numbers in a row.

The even numbers on a six-sided die are 2, 4, and 6. So, there are 3 favorable outcomes for each roll. The total number of outcomes when rolling a die is 6. 

The probability of rolling an even number on one roll is:

P(Even number) = F / T = 3 / 6 = 0.5

However, since Jerry is rolling the die twice, we need to calculate the probability of getting an even number on both rolls. The probability of independent events (two events where the outcome of one does not affect the outcome of the other) is calculated by multiplying the probabilities of the individual events. So, the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is:

P(Two even numbers) = P(Even number) * P(Even number) = 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25

Finally, we need to calculate how much more likely it is that Jerry rolls a number greater than 3 than that he rolls two even numbers in a row. This is calculated by subtracting the probability of rolling two even numbers from the probability of rolling a number greater than 3:

Difference = P(Greater than 3) - P(Two even numbers) = 0.5 - 0.25 = 0.25

To express this difference as a percentage, we multiply by 100:

Difference (%) = 0.25 * 100 = 25%

So, it is 25% more likely that Jerry rolls a number greater than 3 than that he rolls two even numbers in a row.
