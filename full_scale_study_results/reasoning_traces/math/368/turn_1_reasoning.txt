Question ID: 368
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

Let's start by understanding the problem. Erin scored 14 points and now has three times more points than Sara, who scored 8 points. We need to find out how many points Erin had before she scored the 14 points.

First, let's figure out how many points Erin has now. Since Erin has three times more points than Sara, and Sara has 8 points, Erin has 3 * 8 = 24 points.

However, we know that Erin just scored 14 points. This means that before she scored these points, she had 24 - 14 = 10 points.

So, Erin had 10 points before she scored the 14 points.

Final Answer: Erin had 10 points before.
