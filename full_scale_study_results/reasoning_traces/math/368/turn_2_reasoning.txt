Question ID: 368
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to first understand what the problem is asking. The problem states that Erin now has three times more points than Sara, who scored 8 points. After scoring 14 points, Erin reached this total. We need to find out how many points Erin had before she scored the 14 points.

First, let's determine how many points Erin has now. Since Erin has three times more points than Sara, and Sara has 8 points, Erin has 3 * 8 = 24 points. This is because "three times more" means three times the amount of Sara's points.

However, this total includes the 14 points that Erin just scored. So, to find out how many points Erin had before she scored these 14 points, we need to subtract the 14 points from her current total.

So, Erin had 24 - 14 = 10 points before she scored the 14 points.

Therefore, Erin had 10 points before.
