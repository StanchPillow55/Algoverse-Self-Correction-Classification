Erin's current score is 14 points, which is three times more than Sara's score of 8 points. 

To find out how many points Erin had before scoring the 14 points, we need to first understand what "three times more" means. If Erin has three times more points than Sara, this means Erin has Sara's points plus three times Sara's points. 

So, we can set up the equation: 

Sara's points + 3 * Sara's points = Erin's points

Substituting the given values into the equation, we get:

8 + 3 * 8 = 14

24 + 8 = 14

32 = 14

This equation is not correct, so we need to reconsider our interpretation of the problem. 

If Erin now has three times more points than Sara, it means that Erin's current score is Sara's score multiplied by 4 (Sara's score plus three times Sara's score). 

So, the correct equation should be:

4 * Sara's points = Erin's points

Substituting the given values into the equation, we get:

4 * 8 = 14

32 = 14

This equation is also not correct. 

The problem might be in the interpretation of "three times more". Sometimes, "three times more" is used to mean "three times as many". If that's the case, then Erin's current score is three times Sara's score, not four times. 

So, the correct equation should be:

3 * Sara's points = Erin's points

Substituting the given values into the equation, we get:

3 * 8 = 14

24 = 14

This equation is still not correct. 

The problem might be in the understanding of Erin's current score. If Erin scored 14 points to have three times as many points as Sara, then Erin's current score is not 14, but 14 plus whatever she had before. 

So, the correct equation should be:

Erin's previous points + 14 = 3 * Sara's points

Substituting the given values into the equation, we get:

Erin's previous points + 14 = 3 * 8

Erin's previous points + 14 = 24

Subtracting 14 from both sides of the equation to solve for Erin's previous points, we get:

Erin's previous points = 24 - 14

Erin's previous points = 10

So, Erin had 10 points before she scored the 14 points. 

Final Answer: Erin had 10 points before.
