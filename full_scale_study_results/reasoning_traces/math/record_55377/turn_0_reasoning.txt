==================================================

To solve this problem, I will need to analyze the given information and determine the appropriate response.

Given information:
- The United States is expelling the Venezuelan ambassador to the United States in response to a similar move by Venezuela.
- The U.S. Treasury Department has accused two senior Venezuelan intelligence officials and one former official of assisting the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) with narcotics trafficking.
- The president said he was making the moves "in solidarity with @placeholder and the people of Bolivia."

Step 1: Identify the missing information in the query.
The query mentions "@placeholder", which indicates that a name or entity is missing. We need to determine who the president is referring to in the statement.

Step 2: Analyze the context and make a reasonable inference.
Based on the information provided in the passage, the president is likely referring to the president of Bolivia, as the passage mentions an "escalating diplomatic battle with Venezuelan, Bolivian leaders."

Step 3: Provide the final answer.
The president said he was making the moves "in solidarity with the president of Bolivia and the people of Bolivia."
