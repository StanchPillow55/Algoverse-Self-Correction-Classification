Question ID: record_55377
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, I will need to analyze the given information and determine the missing placeholder in the query.

Given information:
- The U.S. is expelling the Venezuelan ambassador in response to a similar move by Venezuela.
- The U.S. Treasury Department has accused Venezuelan officials of assisting the FARC rebels in Colombia with narcotics trafficking.
- The query states that the president said he was making the moves "in solidarity with @placeholder and the people of Bolivia."

Based on the context, the missing placeholder in the query is likely referring to the president of Bolivia, Evo Morales.

The reasoning is as follows:
1. The passage mentions an "escalating diplomatic battle with Venezuelan, Bolivian leaders", suggesting that the U.S. actions are not just against Venezuela, but also against Bolivia and its president, Evo Morales.
2. The query specifically mentions the president making moves "in solidarity with @placeholder and the people of Bolivia", indicating that the placeholder is referring to the president of Bolivia, Evo Morales.

Therefore, the final answer is:

The president said he was making the moves "in solidarity with Evo Morales
