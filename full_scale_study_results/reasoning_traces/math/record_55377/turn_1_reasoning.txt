Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

I apologize, but there does not appear to be a specific math problem stated in the given passage. The passage discusses diplomatic actions between the United States and Venezuela, including the expulsion of ambassadors and accusations of aiding rebel groups. There is no numerical data or mathematical calculation required to answer the query.

The query states that "the president said he was making the moves 'in solidarity with @placeholder and the people of Bolivia.'" However, the passage does not mention Bolivia or the president making any such statement. The query appears to be incomplete or hypothetical.

Without a clear mathematical problem to solve, I am unable to provide step-by-step reasoning and calculations. If you could restate the problem or provide more specific details, I would be happy to assist further. As an AI assistant focused on problem-solving, I need a well-defined mathematical question to work through effectively.
