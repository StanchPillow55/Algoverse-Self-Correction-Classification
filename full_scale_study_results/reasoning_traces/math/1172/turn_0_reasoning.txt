==================================================

Let's break down the problem day by day:

On Monday, Alice counts 3 puffs of clouds.

On Tuesday, she sees double the number of clouds as Monday, so she counts 2 * 3 = 6 clouds.

On Wednesday, she sees double the number of clouds as Tuesday, so she counts 2 * 6 = 12 clouds.

On Thursday, she sees double the number of clouds as Wednesday, so she counts 2 * 12 = 24 clouds.

On Friday, she sees double the number of clouds as Thursday, so she counts 2 * 24 = 48 clouds.

To find the total number of clouds Alice counted across all five days, we add up the number of clouds she counted each day:

3 (Monday) + 6 (Tuesday) + 12 (Wednesday) + 24 (Thursday) + 48 (Friday) = 93 clouds.

So, Alice counted a total of 93 clouds from Monday through Friday.
