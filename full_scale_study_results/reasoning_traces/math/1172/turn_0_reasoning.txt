To solve the problem, we need to calculate the number of cloud puffs Alice counts each day from Monday to Friday, starting with 3 puffs on Monday and doubling the count each subsequent day.

Let's break it down day by day:

1. **Monday**: 
   - Number of puffs = 3

2. **Tuesday**: 
   - Number of puffs = 2 × (Number of puffs on Monday) 
   - Number of puffs = 2 × 3 = 6

3. **Wednesday**: 
   - Number of puffs = 2 × (Number of puffs on Tuesday) 
   - Number of puffs = 2 × 6 = 12

4. **Thursday**: 
   - Number of puffs = 2 × (Number of puffs on Wednesday) 
   - Number of puffs = 2 × 12 = 24

5. **Friday**: 
   - Number of puffs = 2 × (Number of puffs on Thursday) 
   - Number of puffs = 2 × 24 = 48

Now, we will sum the total number of puffs counted over the five days:

- Total puffs = (Number of puffs on Monday) + (Number of puffs on Tuesday) + (Number of puffs on Wednesday) + (Number of puffs on Thursday) + (Number of puffs on Friday)
- Total puffs = 3 + 6 + 12 + 24 + 48

Now, let's calculate the sum step by step:

- First, add Monday and Tuesday:
  - 3 + 6 = 9

- Next, add Wednesday:
  - 9 + 12 = 21

- Then, add Thursday:
  - 21 + 24 = 45

- Finally, add Friday:
  - 45 + 48 = 93

Thus, the total number of cloud puffs Alice counts from Monday to Friday is **93**.

Therefore, the final answer is:

**93**
