==================================================

First, let's calculate the total cost of the T-shirts. The first T-shirt costs $8, and the second one is 50% off, so it costs $8 * 0.5 = $4. Therefore, the total cost of the T-shirts is $8 + $4 = $12.

Next, let's calculate the cost of the shoes. The shoes are 40% off the original price of $40, so the discount is $40 * 0.4 = $16. Therefore, the cost of the shoes after the discount is $40 - $16 = $24.

Finally, let's add up the cost of the T-shirts and the shoes to find the total amount of money Jake spends at the store. The total cost is $12 (T-shirts) + $24 (shoes) = $36.

So, Jake spends a total of $36 at the store.
