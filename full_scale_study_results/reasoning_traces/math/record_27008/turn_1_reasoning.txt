Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, I will need to analyze the given information and determine the appropriate response.

The passage states that Shakira is partnering with Fisher-Price to launch a line of baby toys, and that she will also debut a 12-part web series targeting millennial moms. 

However, the passage does not mention anything about Shakira debuting a 12-part web series. The passage only states that the "First Steps collection of toys and baby gear will be available in November" and that "All of the proceeds will benefit her Barefoot Foundation, which provides education and nutrition to children in impoverished areas of her native Colombia."

Therefore, the correct response is:

The passage does not state that Shakira will debut a 12-part web series. The passage focuses on Shakira's partnership with Fisher-Price to launch a line of baby toys, and that the proceeds will benefit her Barefoot Foundation.
