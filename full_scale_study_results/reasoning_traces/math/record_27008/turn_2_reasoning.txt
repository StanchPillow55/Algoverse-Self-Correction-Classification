Question ID: record_27008
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, I will need to analyze the given information and determine the appropriate response.

The passage states that Shakira is partnering with Fisher-Price to launch a line of baby toys, and that she will also debut a 12-part web series targeting millennial moms. 

However, the passage does not mention anything about Shakira debuting a 12-part web series. The passage only states that the "First Steps collection of toys and baby gear will be available in November" and that "All of the proceeds will benefit her Barefoot Foundation, which provides education and nutrition to children in impoverished areas of her native Colombia."

Therefore, the statement "@placeholder will also debut a 12-part web series Monday, which will target millennial moms" is not supported by the information provided in the passage.

The appropriate response would be:

The passage does not mention Shakira debuting a 12-part web series targeting millennial moms. The passage focuses on Shakira's partnership with Fisher-Price to launch a line of baby toys, with the proceeds benefiting her Barefoot Foundation.
