==================================================

On Tuesday, Clara bought 20 pomegranates at $20 each. This means the total cost of the pomegranates was 20 * $20 = $<<20*20=400>>400. However, she had a $2 voucher, so she paid $400 - $2 = $<<400-2=398>>398.

On Wednesday, the price of each pomegranate increased to $30. Therefore, the total cost of 20 pomegranates was 20 * $30 = $<<20*30=600>>600. However, there was a 10% discount on the total cost. 10% of $600 is 10/100 * $600 = $<<10/100*600=60>>60. Therefore, after the discount, the total cost was $600 - $60 = $<<600-60=540>>540.

The difference between the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days is $540 - $398 = $<<540-398=142>>142. 

Therefore, the difference between the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days is $142.
