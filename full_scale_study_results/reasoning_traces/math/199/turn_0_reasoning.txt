Question ID: 199
Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

Mark edits an equal number of sentences for each publisher, so he edits 1000 / 2 = 500 sentences for each publisher.

Publisher A pays him 5 cents per sentence, so he makes 500 * 5 = 2500 cents from Publisher A.

Publisher B pays him twice what Publisher A pays, so Publisher B pays him 5 * 2 = 10 cents per sentence.

So, he makes 500 * 10 = 5000 cents from Publisher B.

In total, Mark makes 2500 + 5000 = 7500 cents in a week.

Therefore, Mark makes 7500 cents in a week.
