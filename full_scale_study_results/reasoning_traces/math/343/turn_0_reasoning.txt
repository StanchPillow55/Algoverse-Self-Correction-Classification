Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to find out how much more Tyson's coach wants him to run. To do this, we multiply the distance Tyson currently runs, which is 5000 meters, by 1/5:

5000 * 1/5 = 1000 meters

So, Tyson's coach wants him to run an additional 1000 meters per day.

Adding this to Tyson's current daily distance gives us the total distance Tyson would run per day if he followed his coach's advice:

5000 meters + 1000 meters = 6000 meters

Next, we need to find out how many days are in the month of June. June has 30 days.

So, if Tyson runs 6000 meters every day for 30 days, we multiply these two numbers together to find the total distance Tyson would cover in June:

6000 meters/day * 30 days = 180,000 meters

So, if Tyson took his coach's advice and trained for a month, he would cover a total distance of 180,000 meters in June.
