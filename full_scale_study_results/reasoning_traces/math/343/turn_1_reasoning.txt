==================================================

To solve this problem, we first need to determine how much more Tyson's coach wants him to run each day. 

Currently, Tyson runs 5000 meters every day. His coach wants him to run 1/5 times more. To find out how much more this is, we multiply 5000 meters by 1/5:

5000 * 1/5 = 1000 meters

So, Tyson's coach wants him to run an additional 1000 meters each day. 

To find out how much Tyson would run in total each day if he followed his coach's advice, we add this additional distance to his current daily distance:

5000 meters + 1000 meters = 6000 meters

So, Tyson would run 6000 meters each day if he followed his coach's advice. 

Next, we need to determine how many days are in the month of June. June has 30 days. 

To find out how much Tyson would run in total in the month of June if he followed his coach's advice, we multiply the daily distance by the number of days in the month:

6000 meters/day * 30 days = 180,000 meters

So, Tyson would run a total of 180,000 meters in the month of June if he followed his coach's advice. 

Therefore, the final answer is 180,000 meters.
