Question ID: 343
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to calculate how much more Tyson's coach wants him to run. Since the coach wants him to run 1/5 times more than his current 5000 meters, we multiply 5000 by 1/5:

5000 * 1/5 = 1000 meters

This means the coach wants Tyson to run an additional 1000 meters each day. So, the total distance Tyson would run in a day if he followed his coach's advice would be:

5000 meters (his current distance) + 1000 meters (the additional distance) = 6000 meters

Now, to find out how much Tyson would run in the month of June, we need to multiply this daily distance by the number of days in June. Since June has 30 days, we calculate:

6000 meters/day * 30 days = 180,000 meters

So, if Tyson took his coach's advice and ran 1/5 times more than his current distance every day for the month of June, he would cover a total distance of 180,000 meters.
