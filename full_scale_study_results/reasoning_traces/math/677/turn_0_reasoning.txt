Question ID: 677
Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to find out how many signatures the sisters have collected so far. We do this by adding the number of signatures each sister has collected. 

Carol has 20 signatures and Jennifer has 44 signatures. 

20 (Carol's signatures) + 44 (Jennifer's signatures) = 64 signatures

So, the sisters have collected 64 signatures so far. 

Next, we need to find out how many more signatures they need to reach their goal of 100 signatures. We do this by subtracting the number of signatures they have collected from their goal. 

100 (goal) - 64 (signatures collected so far) = 36 signatures

So, the sisters need to collect 36 more signatures to reach their goal of 100 signatures. 

Therefore, Carol and Jennifer need to collect 36 more signatures to reach their goal.
