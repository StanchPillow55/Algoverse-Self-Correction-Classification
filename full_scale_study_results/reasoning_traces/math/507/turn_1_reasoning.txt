Question ID: 507
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to calculate how much Janet spends on bus trips each day. Since each trip costs $2.20 and she takes two trips, we multiply $2.20 by 2:

$2.20 * 2 = $4.40

So, Janet spends $4.40 on bus trips each day.

Next, we need to calculate how much she spends in a week. Since she takes bus trips five days a week, we multiply $4.40 by 5:

$4.40 * 5 = $22.00

So, Janet spends $22.00 on bus trips each week.

Finally, we subtract the cost of the weekly bus pass from the amount she spends on bus trips each week to find out how much she would save:

$22.00 - $20.00 = $2.00

Therefore, Janet would save $2.00 by buying a weekly bus pass for $20.00.
