Question ID: 507
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to calculate how much Janet spends on bus trips each day. Since each trip costs $2.20 and she takes two trips a day, we multiply $2.20 by 2 to get $4.40 per day.

Next, we need to calculate how much she spends in a week. Since she takes the bus five days a week, we multiply $4.40 by 5 to get $22.00 per week.

Finally, we subtract the cost of the weekly bus pass from the total amount she spends on bus trips in a week to find out how much she would save. So, $22.00 - $20.00 equals $2.00.

Therefore, Janet would save $2.00 by buying a weekly bus pass for $20.
