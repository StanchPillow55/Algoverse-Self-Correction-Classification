==================================================

To answer this question, I will break down the relevant information from the paragraph:

1. The paragraph states that the "former Legal Aid of Central Texas and Bexar County Legal Aid resisted the merger".

2. The reason given for their resistance is that "the mergers were done illegally and without the input of board members. They also argued that Hall's litigious style hampered their ability to garner funds from Congress."

So the key points are:
- The Legal Aid of Central Texas and Legal Aid of Bexar County resisted the merger.
- Their reasons were:
  1. The merger was done illegally and without input from their board members.
  2. The litigious style of the new organization (TRLA) made it harder for them to get funding from Congress.

Therefore, the complete reasoning and final answer is:

The Legal Aid of Central Texas and Legal Aid of Bexar County resisted the merger because they felt the merger was done illegally and without input from their board members. They also argued that the litigious style of the new organization, TRLA, made it harder for them to garner funds from Congress.
