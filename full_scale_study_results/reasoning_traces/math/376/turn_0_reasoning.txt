Question ID: 376
Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, let's find out how many students like the color blue. Since half of the class likes blue, we can calculate this number by dividing the total number of students by 2:

40 students / 2 = 20 students

So, 20 students like the color blue.

Next, let's find out how many students like the color green. We know that one-fourth of the remaining students (after subtracting the blue-likers) like green. So, we first need to find out how many students are remaining:

40 students - 20 students = 20 students

Now, we can find out how many of these students like green by dividing this number by 4:

20 students / 4 = 5 students

So, 5 students like the color green.

Finally, let's find out how many students like the color yellow. We know that the rest of the students (after subtracting the blue-likers and green-likers) like yellow. So, we can calculate this number by subtracting the number of blue-likers and green-likers from the total number of students:

40 students - 20 students - 5 students = 15 students

So, 15 students like the color yellow.

Therefore, the final answer is that 15 pupils like the color yellow.
