Question ID: 376
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine how many pupils like the color yellow based on the given preferences for blue and green.

1. **Determine the number of pupils who like blue:**
   - There are 40 pupils in total.
   - Half of the class likes blue.
   - Calculate the number of pupils who like blue:
     \[
     \frac{1}{2} \times 40 = 20
     \]
   - Therefore, 20 pupils like blue.

2. **Calculate the remaining pupils after accounting for those who like blue:**
   - Subtract the number of pupils who like blue from the total number of pupils:
     \[
     40 - 20 = 20
     \]
   - So, 20 pupils remain after accounting for those who like blue.

3. **Determine the number of pupils who like green:**
   - One-fourth of the remaining pupils like green.
   - Calculate the number of pupils who like green:
     \[
     \frac{1}{4} \times 20 = 5
     \]
   - Therefore, 5 pupils like green.

4. **Calculate the number of pupils who like yellow:**
   - The rest of the pupils like yellow.
   - Subtract the number of pupils who like green from the remaining pupils:
     \[
     20 - 5 = 15
     \]
   - Therefore, 15 pupils like yellow.

**Final Answer:**
15 pupils like the color yellow.
