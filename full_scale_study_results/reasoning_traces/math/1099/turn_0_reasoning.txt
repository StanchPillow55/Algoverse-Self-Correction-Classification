==================================================

To solve this problem, we first need to find out how long it takes to slide down each waterslide. 

We can do this by dividing the length of the slide by the speed at which people slide down.

For the biggest waterslide, which is 300 feet long and people slide down at 60 feet/minute, the time it takes to slide down can be calculated as follows:

300 feet / 60 feet/minute = 5 minutes

For the second biggest waterslide, which is 240 feet long and people slide down at 80 feet/minute, the time it takes to slide down can be calculated as follows:

240 feet / 80 feet/minute = 3 minutes

Now, to find out how much longer it takes to ride the biggest slide compared to the second biggest slide, we subtract the time it takes to ride the second biggest slide from the time it takes to ride the biggest slide:

5 minutes - 3 minutes = 2 minutes

So, it takes 2 minutes longer to ride the biggest slide compared to the second biggest slide.
