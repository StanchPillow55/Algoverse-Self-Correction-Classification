Question ID: 381
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we first need to find out how many kilometers each person hiked. 

We can do this by multiplying the speed at which they hiked (in kilometers per hour) by the number of hours they hiked. 

For Cho, this would be 14 kilometers per hour * 8 hours = 112 kilometers.

For Chloe, this would be 9 kilometers per hour * 5 hours = 45 kilometers.

Now, to find out how many kilometers farther Cho hiked, we subtract the distance Chloe hiked from the distance Cho hiked.

So, 112 kilometers - 45 kilometers = 67 kilometers.

Therefore, Cho hiked 67 kilometers farther than Chloe.
