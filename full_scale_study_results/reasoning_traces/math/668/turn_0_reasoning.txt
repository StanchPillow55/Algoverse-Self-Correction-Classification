Question ID: 668
Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to find out how many employees are in management. 

We know that 20% of the employees are in management. To find this, we multiply the total number of employees by 20% (or 0.20 in decimal form):

50 employees * 0.20 = 10 employees

So, there are 10 employees in management.

Next, we need to find out how many of these management employees oversee the entire company. 

We know that 30% of the management employees oversee the entire company. To find this, we multiply the number of management employees by 30% (or 0.30 in decimal form):

10 employees * 0.30 = 3 employees

So, 3 employees oversee the entire company. 

Therefore, the final answer is that 3 employees oversee the company.
