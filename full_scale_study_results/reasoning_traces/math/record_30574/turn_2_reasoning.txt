Question ID: record_30574
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, I will need to analyze the given passage and determine the appropriate placeholder to use in the query.

The passage discusses the delay in the announcement of the results of the Egyptian presidential election. It mentions that the electoral committee has not completed the verification of 400 electoral violation reports submitted by the two presidential candidates. This suggests that there is uncertainty and controversy surrounding the election results.

The passage also mentions that the former ruler, Hosni Mubarak, was removed from life-support equipment and his health improved, which was reported a day after he was declared "clinically dead" by a state-run news agency.

Given this context, the appropriate placeholder in the query would be "Mubarak's", as the passage suggests that there was a "health scare" surrounding Mubarak's condition.

Therefore, the complete query would be:

"Citizens were cynical or fatalistic about the Mubarak's health scare Tuesday."
