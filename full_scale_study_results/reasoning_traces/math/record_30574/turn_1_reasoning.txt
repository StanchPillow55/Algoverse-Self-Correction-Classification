Question ID: record_30574
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, I will need to analyze the given passage and determine the appropriate response to the query.

The passage discusses the delay in the announcement of the results of the Egyptian presidential election, as well as the health status of former Egyptian ruler Hosni Mubarak. However, the passage does not mention anything about the citizens' reactions to a "health scare" on Tuesday.

Since the passage does not provide any information about a "health scare" or the citizens' reactions, I do not have enough information to answer the given query. The query appears to be unrelated to the content of the passage.

Therefore, the appropriate response is: "I do not have enough information to answer the given query, as it is not related to the content of the provided passage."
