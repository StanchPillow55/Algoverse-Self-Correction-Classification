==================================================

To solve this problem, I will need to analyze the given passage and determine the appropriate response to the query.

The passage discusses the delay in the announcement of the results of the Egyptian presidential election. It mentions that the electoral committee has not completed the verification of 400 electoral violation reports submitted by the two presidential candidates. As a result, the announcement of the election results has been delayed by a day or two.

The passage also mentions that the former ruler, Hosni Mubarak, was removed from life-support equipment and his health improved a day after a state-run news agency reported that he was "clinically dead."

The query asks about the citizens' reaction to the "health scare" on Tuesday. However, the passage does not mention any specific "health scare" that occurred on Tuesday. The only health-related information in the passage is about Hosni Mubarak's condition, but this is not described as a "health scare."

Therefore, based on the information provided in the passage, there is no evidence to suggest that citizens were cynical or fatalistic about a "health scare" on Tuesday. The passage does not provide any information about the citizens' reactions to any health-related events
