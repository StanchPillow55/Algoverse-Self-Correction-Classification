Question ID: 250
Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, let's find out the total number of students in the school. Since each class has 20 students and there are 3 classes, the total number of students is 20 * 3 = 60 students.

The school is 50% boys, so there are 60 * 0.5 = 30 boys in the whole school.

The first class has 15 girls and the second class has 12 girls, so the total number of girls in these two classes is 15 + 12 = 27 girls.

Since each class has 20 students, the total number of students in the first two classes is 20 * 2 = 40 students.

The number of boys in the first two classes is the total number of students in these classes minus the number of girls, which is 40 - 27 = 13 boys.

Since there are 30 boys in the whole school, and 13 of them are in the first two classes, there must be 30 - 13 = 17 boys in the third class.

So, there are 17 boys in the third class.
