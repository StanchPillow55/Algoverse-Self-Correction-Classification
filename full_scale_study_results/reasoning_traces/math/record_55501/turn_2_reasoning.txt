Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- President Obama stated that the U.S. will honor its agreement with Iraq's democratically elected government to remove combat troops from cities by July, and to remove all U.S. troops from Iraq by 2012.

To solve this, we need to:
1. Understand the timeline of the troop withdrawal.
2. Explain the reasoning behind the withdrawal.

Step 1: Timeline of troop withdrawal
- By July, the U.S. will remove combat troops from cities in Iraq.
- By 2012, the U.S. will remove all troops from Iraq.

Step 2: Reasoning behind the withdrawal
- The U.S. has an agreement with Iraq's democratically elected government to withdraw troops.
- This is likely part of the plan to transition security responsibilities to the Iraqi government and military.
- Withdrawing troops aligns with the U.S. goal of supporting Iraq's sovereignty and self-governance.

Final answer:
President Obama stated that the U.S. will honor its agreement with Iraq's democratically elected government to remove combat troops from cities by July,
