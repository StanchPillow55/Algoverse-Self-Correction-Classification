==================================================

To solve this problem, I will break it down step-by-step:

1. Understand the context:
   - The passage discusses a feud between Karl Oyston, the chairman of Blackpool FC, and Bart De Roover, the former assistant manager of the club.
   - De Roover left the club last week after refusing to sign a new contract, and he has been critical of the way Oyston runs the club.
   - Oyston has responded by writing a column in the local newspaper, where he has accused De Roover of making a "disproportionate crisis" out of the events because he did not get his own way.

2. Analyze the quote:
   - The quote is attributed to Karl Oyston, the Blackpool FC chairman.
   - Oyston is suggesting that De Roover, the former assistant manager, has made a "disproportionate crisis" out of the events surrounding his departure from the club.
   - Oyston implies that De Roover is reacting this way because he did not get his own way.

3. Evaluate the quote:
   - Oyston's statement
