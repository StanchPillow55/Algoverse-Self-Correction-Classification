==================================================

To solve this problem, I will break it down step-by-step:

1. Understand the context:
The passage discusses a feud between Karl Oyston, the chairman of Blackpool FC, and Bart De Roover, the former assistant manager of the club. De Roover left the club last week after refusing to sign a new contract, and has since criticized the way the club is being run.

2. Analyze the quote:
The quote is from Karl Oyston, the Blackpool FC chairman. He is suggesting that De Roover is making a "disproportionate crisis" out of the events surrounding his departure from the club, because he did not get his own way.

3. Evaluate the reasoning:
Oyston's statement implies that De Roover is overreacting or exaggerating the issues at the club, simply because he did not get the outcome he wanted. This suggests that Oyston believes De Roover's criticisms are not justified or proportional to the actual situation.

4. Provide a final answer:
Based on the information provided in the passage, I do not have enough evidence to fully evaluate the validity of Oy
