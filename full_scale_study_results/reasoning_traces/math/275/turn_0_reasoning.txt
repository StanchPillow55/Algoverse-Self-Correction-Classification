==================================================

Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we know that Sean's solo song has 54 lines. That's straightforward, so we'll keep that number in mind.

Next, the first scene has twice the number of lines as the song. That means the first scene has 2 * 54 = <<2*54=108>>108 lines. However, only a third of these lines are Sean's. So, Sean has to memorize 108 / 3 = <<108/3=36>>36 lines from the first scene.

The second scene has six more lines than the song. That means the second scene has 54 + 6 = <<54+6=60>>60 lines. Four-fifths of these lines are Sean's, so he has to memorize 60 * 4/5 = <<60*4/5=48>>48 lines from the second scene.

Now, we just need to add up all the lines Sean has to memorize. That's 54 (from the song) + 36 (from the first scene) + 48 (from the second scene) = <<54+36+48=138>>138 lines.

So, Sean has to memorize 138 lines in total.
