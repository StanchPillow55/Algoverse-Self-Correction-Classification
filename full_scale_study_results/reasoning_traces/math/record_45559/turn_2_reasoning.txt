==================================================

To solve this problem, I will break it down step-by-step:

1. Identify the key information given in the passage:
   - Hull City beat Everton at the KC Stadium on Thursday.
   - Ahmed Elmohamady scored the first goal for Hull City.
   - Nikica Jelavic, a former Everton player, scored the second goal for Hull City.
   - This was Everton's fourth consecutive Premier League defeat.
   - Everton defender Antolin Alcaraz was sent off in the second half.

2. Determine the placeholder in the query:
   - The placeholder in the query is "@placeholder", which refers to the goal that Jelavic scored.

3. Explain the reasoning and work through the problem:
   - The passage states that Nikica Jelavic, a former Everton player, scored the second goal for Hull City.
   - This means that the ball headed towards the Hull City goal, and Jelavic celebrated after scoring the goal.
   - Therefore, the placeholder in the query should be "Hull City's" goal.

4. Final answer:
