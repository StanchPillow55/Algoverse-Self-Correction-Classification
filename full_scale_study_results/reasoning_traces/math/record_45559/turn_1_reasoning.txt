Question ID: record_45559
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, I will need to analyze the given passage and extract the relevant information to determine the placeholder in the query.

Given information:
- The passage describes a Premier League match between Hull City and Everton.
- Hull City won the match, with goals scored by Ahmed Elmohamady and Nikica Jelavic.
- The query mentions that Robles (the Everton goalkeeper) looks back in despair as the ball heads towards the @placeholder goal, while Jelavic (the former Everton player) wheels away in celebration.

Based on the information provided, the @placeholder in the query should be the Hull City goal, as Jelavic, the Hull City player, is celebrating after scoring a goal.

Therefore, the final answer is:
The @placeholder in the query is the Hull City goal.
