Question ID: 681
Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

Let's start by finding out how many cookies Max has. Since Katarina has 5 less cookies than Max, and we know that Katarina has 68 cookies, we can add 5 to 68 to find out how many cookies Max has. 

68 + 5 = 73 cookies

So, Max has 73 cookies. 

Next, let's find out how many cookies the Cookie Monster has. Since Max has 12 more cookies than the Cookie Monster, we can subtract 12 from the number of cookies Max has to find out how many cookies the Cookie Monster has. 

73 - 12 = 61 cookies

So, the Cookie Monster has 61 cookies. 

Finally, let's find out how many cookies Summer has. Since Summer has 23 more cookies than Max, we can add 23 to the number of cookies Max has to find out how many cookies Summer has. 

73 + 23 = 96 cookies

So, Summer has 96 cookies. 

To find out how many cookies they have in total, we can add up the number of cookies each person has. 

68 (Katarina's cookies) + 73 (Max's cookies) + 61 (Cookie Monster's cookies) + 96 (Summer's cookies) = 298 cookies

So, they have 298 cookies in total.
