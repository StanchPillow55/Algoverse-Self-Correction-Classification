Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to understand the context and the information provided in the passage.

The passage discusses the federal government's wild horse roundups in Silver Springs, Nevada, using helicopters. It mentions that the government claims the program controls the population, but activists argue that the government is "exterminating" the horses and "managing them to extinction."

The query states that the study determining the number of horses that will remain in the management area was done in the mid-1990s.

Given the information provided, we can infer the following:

1. The government conducts wild horse roundups in the Silver Springs, Nevada area using helicopters.
2. The government claims the roundups are to control the population, but activists argue the government is mismanaging the horses.
3. The study that determined the number of horses to remain in the management area was done in the mid-1990s.

However, the passage does not provide any specific numbers or details about the study or the management area. Therefore, we cannot provide a definitive answer to the query.

The best we can say is that the study determining the number of horses to remain in the management area was done in the mid-1990s
