Question ID: 216
Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

Janeth borrowed $2000 and promised to return it with an additional 10% of the amount. 

First, we need to calculate how much she will owe in total. 

10% of $2000 is $2000 * 0.10 = $200. 

So, Janeth will owe $2000 + $200 = $2200 in total. 

Next, we need to calculate how much she will have paid after 12 months. 

She is paying $165 a month for 12 months, so she will have paid $165 * 12 = $1980 by then. 

Finally, we need to subtract the amount she has paid from the total amount she owes to find out how much she will still owe. 

$2200 - $1980 = $220. 

So, Janeth's remaining balance after 12 months will be $220.
