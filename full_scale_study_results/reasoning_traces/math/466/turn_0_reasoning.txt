Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, let's calculate how much Becky and Kelly each paid for their apples.

Becky bought 20 apples for 45 cents each, so without the discount, she would have paid 20 * 45 cents = 900 cents or $9. However, she received a $1 discount, so she actually paid $9 - $1 = $8.

Kelly bought 20 apples for 50 cents each, so without the discount, she would have paid 20 * 50 cents = 1000 cents or $10. However, she received a 10 percent discount, so she actually paid $10 - $10 * 10/100 = $10 - $1 = $9.

To find out how much more Kelly paid than Becky, we subtract the amount Becky paid from the amount Kelly paid: $9 - $8 = $1.

So, Kelly paid $1 more than Becky.
