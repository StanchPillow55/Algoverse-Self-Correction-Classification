Question ID: 466
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To determine how much more Kelly paid than Becky, we need to calculate the total cost for each person and then find the difference between the two amounts.

**Step 1: Calculate Becky's total cost.**

- Becky bought 20 apples at 45 cents each.
- Without any discount, the cost would be:
  \[
  20 \times 45 = 900 \text{ cents}
  \]

- Becky received a $1 discount. Since $1 is equivalent to 100 cents, her discount is 100 cents.
- Therefore, Becky's total cost after the discount is:
  \[
  900 - 100 = 800 \text{ cents}
  \]

**Step 2: Calculate Kelly's total cost.**

- Kelly bought 20 apples at 50 cents each.
- Without any discount, the cost would be:
  \[
  20 \times 50 = 1000 \text{ cents}
  \]

- Kelly received a 10 percent discount. To find the discount amount, calculate 10% of 1000 cents:
  \[
  0.10 \times 1000 = 100 \text{ cents}
  \]

- Therefore, Kelly's total cost after the discount is:
  \[
  1000 - 100 = 900 \text{ cents}
  \]

**Step 3: Calculate the difference in cost between Kelly and Becky.**

- Kelly's total cost is 900 cents, and Becky's total cost is 800 cents.
- The difference in cost is:
  \[
  900 - 800 = 100 \text{ cents}
  \]

**Final Answer:**

Kelly paid 100 cents more than Becky.
