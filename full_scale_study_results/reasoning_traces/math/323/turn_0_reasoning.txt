==================================================

First, we need to figure out how many ice cubes Shannon used to cool her coffee by 65 degrees. Since each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees, we divide 65 by 13 to find the number of ice cubes. 

65 รท 13 = 5 ice cubes

Next, we need to figure out how much weaker the coffee is because of the ice cubes. Since each ice cube makes the coffee 12 milliliters weaker, we multiply the number of ice cubes by 12.

5 ice cubes ร 12 milliliters/ice cube = 60 milliliters

Finally, we add the amount of cream Shannon added to the coffee. Since the cream also weakens the coffee, we add the 15 milliliters of cream to the 60 milliliters from the ice cubes.

60 milliliters + 15 milliliters = 75 milliliters

So, Shannon's iced coffee is 75 milliliters weaker when it is cooled by 65 degrees and she adds 15 milliliters of cream.
