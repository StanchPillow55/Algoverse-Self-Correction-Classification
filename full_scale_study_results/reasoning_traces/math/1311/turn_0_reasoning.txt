==================================================

The caretaker wants 3 feet of line for every foot of dock. This means for 200 feet of dock, he will need 3 * 200 = 600 feet of line.

He already has 6 feet of line, so he needs to buy 600 - 6 = 594 feet of line.

Therefore, the caretaker needs to buy 594 feet of line in total.
