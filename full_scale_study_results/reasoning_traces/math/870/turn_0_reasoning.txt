Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to calculate how much Madeline pays per month. Since Madeline pays 60% of the total cost, we multiply the total cost by 60%. 

60% of $400 = 0.60 * $400 = $240

This means that Madeline pays $240 per month. 

Since the total cost is $400, and Madeline pays $240, we can find out how much Keenan pays by subtracting Madeline's contribution from the total cost. 

$400 - $240 = $160

So, Keenan pays $160 per month. 

To find out how much Keenan pays per week, we divide his monthly payment by the number of weeks in a month. 

$160 รท 4 weeks = $40 per week

So, Keenan spends $40 per week on groceries.
