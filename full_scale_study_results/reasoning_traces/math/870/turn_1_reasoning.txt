Question ID: 870
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to determine how much Madeline pays per month. Since she pays 60% of the total cost, we multiply the total cost by 60% (or 0.60 in decimal form).

0.60 * $400 = $240

This means that Madeline pays $240 per month.

Since Madeline and Keenan share the cost of groceries, we subtract Madeline's contribution from the total cost to find out how much Keenan pays.

$400 - $240 = $160

So, Keenan pays $160 per month.

To find out how much Keenan pays per week, we divide his monthly payment by the number of weeks in a month. Since there are 4 weeks in a month:

$160 รท 4 = $40

So, Keenan spends $40 per week on groceries.
