Question ID: record_15894
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, I will need to analyze the information provided in the passage and determine who the "placeholder" is that deserved the award over Xavi.

Given information:
- Andres Iniesta was named the best player of Euro 2012.
- Iniesta is one of 10 Spanish players in the 23-man squad named by UEFA.
- The passage mentions that Iniesta, Xavi Hernandez, Sergio Buesquets, and Xabi Alonso were included in a nine-strong midfield contingent.

Based on the information provided, the "placeholder" that deserved the award over Xavi is likely Andres Iniesta.

The passage states that Iniesta was named the best player of Euro 2012, despite Xavi having won the award previously. This suggests that the committee felt Iniesta deserved the award over Xavi for his performance in the tournament.

Therefore, the final answer is:
Andres Iniesta deserved the award over Xavi.
