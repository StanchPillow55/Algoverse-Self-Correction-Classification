==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to analyze the information provided in the passage and determine who the "placeholder" is that deserved the award instead of Xavi.

Given information:
- Andres Iniesta was not a contender for the best player of the 2010 World Cup despite scoring Spain's winning goal in the final.
- Iniesta has been recognized for his country's historic triumph at Euro 2012.
- Iniesta is one of 10 Spanish players in UEFA's 23-man squad for Euro 2012.
- Iniesta, along with Xavi Hernandez, Sergio Buesquets, and Xabi Alonso, were included in a nine-strong midfield contingent.
- The passage states that "we felt that @placeholder deserved it" instead of Xavi.

Based on the information provided, the "placeholder" that deserved the award instead of Xavi is Andres Iniesta.

The reasoning is as follows:
