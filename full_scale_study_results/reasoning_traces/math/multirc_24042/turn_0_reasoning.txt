==================================================

To answer this question, we need to look at the information provided in the paragraph about Laozi and his relationship with Confucius.

The paragraph states:
"Unlike Confucius, about whose life many specific and even colorful details are known, the philosopher Laozi (Lao Tse or Lao-Tzu) is an enigma. Estimates of his date of birth vary by well over a century. One legend even says he taught the young Confucius."

From this, we can see that according to one legend, Laozi taught the young Confucius.

Therefore, the answer to the question "According to legend, who taught the young Confucius?" is Laozi.
