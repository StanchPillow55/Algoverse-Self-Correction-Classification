==================================================

To solve this problem, I need to carefully read the given paragraph and extract the relevant information.

The paragraph states:
"Unlike Confucius, about whose life many specific and even colorful details are known, the philosopher Laozi (Lao Tse or Lao-Tzu) is an enigma. Estimates of his date of birth vary by well over a century. One legend even says he taught the young Confucius."

From this, we can see that according to legend, Laozi (also known as Lao Tse or Lao-Tzu) taught the young Confucius.

Therefore, the final answer is:
Laozi
