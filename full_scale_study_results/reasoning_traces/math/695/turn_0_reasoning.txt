Question ID: 695
Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to find out how many bucks there are in the field. Since 50 percent of the deer are bucks, we can calculate this by taking 50 percent of the total number of deer. 

50% of 50 deer = 0.50 * 50 = 25 bucks

Next, we need to find out how many of these bucks are 8 points. We know that 20 percent of the bucks are 8 points, so we can calculate this by taking 20 percent of the total number of bucks.

20% of 25 bucks = 0.20 * 25 = 5 bucks

So, there are 5 eight-point bucks in the field.
