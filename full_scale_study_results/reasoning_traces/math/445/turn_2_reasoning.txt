Question ID: 445
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to determine how many miles the horse runs in 30 minutes at a speed of 32 miles per hour. 

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, 30 minutes is half an hour. Therefore, in 30 minutes, the horse would run half of 32 miles, which is 16 miles.

Next, we need to calculate how many bails of hay the horse eats for running 16 miles. Since the horse eats 1/2 a bail of hay for every mile, it would eat 1/2 * 16 = 8 bails of hay.

The cost of 8 bails of hay is 8 * $3 = $24.

Michael has six 5 dollar bills, which is a total of 6 * $5 = $30.

After buying the hay, Michael would have $30 - $24 = $6 left.

So, Michael has $6 change after he buys the hay.
