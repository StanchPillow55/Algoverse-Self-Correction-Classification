Question ID: 445
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to determine how many miles the horse runs in 30 minutes at a speed of 32 miles per hour. 

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, 30 minutes is half an hour. Therefore, the horse runs half of 32 miles in 30 minutes, which is 32/2 = 16 miles.

Next, we need to calculate how many bails of hay the horse eats for running 16 miles. Since the horse eats 1/2 a bail of hay for every mile, it eats 16 * 1/2 = 8 bails of hay.

Then, we need to calculate how much the 8 bails of hay cost. Since each bail of hay costs $3, the total cost is 8 * $3 = $24.

Finally, we need to determine how much change Michael has after buying the hay. Michael has six 5 dollar bills, so he has 6 * $5 = $30. After buying the hay, he has $30 - $24 = $6 left.

Therefore, Michael has $6 change after he buys the hay.
