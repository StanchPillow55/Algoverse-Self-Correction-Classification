==================================================

To solve this problem, I will go through the paragraph step-by-step and extract the relevant information to determine what a mastery of fire achieved for Peking Man.

Key information from the paragraph:
1. Hundreds of thousands of years before China became the world's longest-running civilization, Peking Man, a forebear of Homo sapiens, achieved a mastery of fire.
2. Peking Man did not invent ways of creating fire, but he learned how to capture flame and keep it alight.
3. With fire, Peking Man and his communities could live year-round in one cave, and they could pursue cooking and even smelting.

Reasoning:
The paragraph states that Peking Man's mastery of fire was a "phenomenal breakthrough" that allowed his communities to live year-round in one cave and engage in activities like cooking and smelting. This suggests that the mastery of fire achieved the following for Peking Man:

1. Allowed for year-round settlement in one location (cave)
2. Enabled cooking and smelting activities
3. Provided light and heat, which are described as "two revolutionary lux
