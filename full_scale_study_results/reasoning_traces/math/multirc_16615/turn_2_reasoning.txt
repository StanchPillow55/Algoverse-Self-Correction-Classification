To solve this problem, I will go through the passage step-by-step and extract the relevant information to determine what a mastery of fire achieved for Peking Man.

From the passage, we learn the following about Peking Man and the mastery of fire:

1. Peking Man, a forebear of Homo sapiens, achieved a mastery of fire.

The passage states that this mastery of fire was a "phenomenal breakthrough" for Peking Man, as it provided two "revolutionary luxuries": light and heat.

Therefore, the mastery of fire achieved the following for Peking Man:

1. It allowed Peking Man's communities to live year-round in one cave, rather than having to constantly move.
2. It enabled Peking Man to cook food and even engage in smelting, which were significant technological and sociological advancements.
3. It provide
