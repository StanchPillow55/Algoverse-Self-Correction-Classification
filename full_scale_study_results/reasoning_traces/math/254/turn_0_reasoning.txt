Question ID: 254
Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to find out how many times Anne went down the slide. Since Anne went down the slide 30% less than Mitchel, we need to calculate 30% of 30 (Mitchel's total), which is 0.30 * 30 = 9.

So, Anne went down the slide 30 - 9 = 21 times.

Next, we need to find out how many times Robert went down the slide. Since Robert went down 4 times as much as Anne, we multiply Anne's total by 4. 

So, Robert went down the slide 21 * 4 = 84 times.

Therefore, Robert went down the water slide 84 times.
