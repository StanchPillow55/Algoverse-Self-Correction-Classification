Question ID: 124
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to determine how many letters Jennie stamped. We know she stamped one-third of the 60 letters needing stamps. To find one-third of a number, we divide that number by 3. 

So, 60 รท 3 = 20 letters. 

This means Jennie stamped 20 letters.

We know that after Jennie stamped these letters, there were 30 letters in the pile of already-stamped letters. If Jennie added 20 letters to this pile, we can determine how many were in the pile when Jennie began by subtracting the number of letters Jennie stamped from the total number of letters in the pile after she finished.

So, 30 - 20 = 10 letters.

Therefore, there were 10 letters in the pile of already-stamped letters when Jennie began.
