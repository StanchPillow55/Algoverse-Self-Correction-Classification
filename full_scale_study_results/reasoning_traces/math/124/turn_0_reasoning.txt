Dataset Type: math
==================================================

Jennie starts with 60 letters that need stamps. She stamps one-third of these letters. To find out how many letters she stamps, we divide 60 by 3. 

60 รท 3 = 20 letters

So, Jennie stamps 20 letters. 

After she stamps these letters, there are 30 letters in the pile of already-stamped letters. This pile includes the letters Jennie just stamped. To find out how many letters were in the pile before Jennie started stamping, we subtract the number of letters she stamped from the total number of letters in the pile now.

30 - 20 = 10 letters

So, there were 10 letters in the pile of already-stamped letters when Jennie began.
