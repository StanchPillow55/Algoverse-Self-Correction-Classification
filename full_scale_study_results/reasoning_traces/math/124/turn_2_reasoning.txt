Question ID: 124
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to find out how many letters Jennie stamped. Since she stamped one-third of the 60 letters, we calculate 60 divided by 3, which equals 20. 

Then, we need to find out how many letters were already stamped before Jennie began. Since there are now 30 letters in the pile of already-stamped letters and Jennie stamped 20 of them, we subtract 20 from 30. 

So, 30 - 20 = 10. 

Therefore, there were 10 letters in the pile of already-stamped letters when Jennie began.
