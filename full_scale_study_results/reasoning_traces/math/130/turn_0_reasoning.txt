Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to find out how many elves quit after children vomit on them. We know that a third of the 60 elves quit. To find a third of a number, we divide that number by 3. 

So, 60 รท 3 = 20 elves quit after children vomit on them.

Next, we need to subtract the number of elves who quit from the total number of elves to find out how many elves are left. 

So, 60 - 20 = 40 elves are left after the vomiting incident.

Then, we know that 10 of the remaining elves quit after kids kick their shins. So, we subtract these 10 elves from the remaining 40 elves.

So, 40 - 10 = 30 elves are left after the shin-kicking incident.

Therefore, Nissa has 30 elves left in her department store's Santa village.
