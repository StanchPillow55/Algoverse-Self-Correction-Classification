Question ID: 130
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

Step 1: Determine the number of elves who quit after children vomit on them.

Nissa initially hires 60 elves. If a third of them quit, we need to find out what one third of 60 is. We calculate this by dividing 60 by 3.

60 รท 3 = 20

So, 20 elves quit after children vomit on them.

Step 2: Determine the number of elves remaining after the first round of quitting.

We subtract the number of elves who quit from the initial number of elves to find out how many are left.

60 - 20 = 40

So, there are 40 elves left after the first round of quitting.

Step 3: Determine the number of elves remaining after kids kick their shins.

We know that 10 more elves quit after kids kick their shins. So, we subtract this number from the number of elves remaining after the first round of quitting.

40 - 10 = 30

So, there are 30 elves left after kids kick their shins.

Final Answer: There are 30 elves left.
