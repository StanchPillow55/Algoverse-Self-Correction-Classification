Question ID: 130
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to find out how many elves quit after children vomit on them. Since a third of the elves quit, we divide the total number of elves, which is 60, by 3. 

60 รท 3 = 20 elves quit

So, 20 elves quit after children vomit on them. 

Next, we subtract the number of elves who quit from the total number of elves to find out how many elves are left. 

60 - 20 = 40 elves are left

Then, 10 of the remaining elves quit after kids kick their shins. We subtract these 10 elves from the remaining 40 elves.

40 - 10 = 30 elves are left

So, after a third of the elves quit after children vomit on them and 10 more elves quit after kids kick their shins, there are 30 elves left. 

Therefore, the final answer is 30 elves.
