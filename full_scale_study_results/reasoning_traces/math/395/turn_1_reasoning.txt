Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to track the number of Valentine's Day cards Erica has at different stages and account for the cards she gives away and receives. Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial Cards Made by Erica:**
   - Erica made 20 Valentine's cards herself.

2. **Cards from Her Dad:**
   - Her dad brought her 2 boxes of pre-made Valentine's cards, with each box containing 15 cards.
   - Total cards from her dad = 2 boxes Ã— 15 cards/box = 30 cards.

3. **Total Cards Erica Initially Has:**
   - Total initial cards = Cards made by Erica + Cards from her dad
   - Total initial cards = 20 + 30 = 50 cards.

4. **Cards Passed Out:**
   - Erica passed out 24 cards to her classmates.
   - She also passed out 5 cards to her family.
   - Total cards passed out = 24 + 5 = 29 cards.

5. **Cards Remaining After Passing Out:**
   - Cards remaining = Total initial cards - Total cards passed out
   - Cards remaining = 50 - 29 = 21 cards.

6. **Cards Received from Family and Friends:**
   - Erica received 17 cards from family and friends.

7. **Final Count of Cards Erica Has:**
   - Final count = Cards remaining after passing out + Cards received
   - Final count = 21 + 17 = 38 cards.

Therefore, after considering all the cards Erica made, received, and passed out, she now has a total of 38 Valentine's Day cards.

**Final Answer: Erica now has 38 Valentine's Day cards.**
