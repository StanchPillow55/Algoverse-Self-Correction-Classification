Question ID: 395
Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, let's figure out how many cards Erica had in total. She made 20 cards herself and her dad brought her 2 boxes of 15 cards each. So, she had:

20 cards (she made) + 2 boxes * 15 cards/box = 20 cards + 30 cards = 50 cards

Then, Erica passed out 24 cards to her classmates and 5 to her family. So, she gave away:

24 cards (to classmates) + 5 cards (to family) = 29 cards

Subtracting the number of cards she gave away from the total number of cards she had gives us:

50 cards (total) - 29 cards (given away) = 21 cards

Finally, Erica received 17 cards from family and friends. Adding these to the number of cards she had left after giving some away gives us:

21 cards (left after giving some away) + 17 cards (received) = 38 cards

So, Erica now has 38 Valentine's Day cards.
