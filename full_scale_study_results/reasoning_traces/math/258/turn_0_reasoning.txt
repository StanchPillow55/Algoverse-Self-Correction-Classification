Question ID: 258
Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to calculate how much Nancy owes for the overdue books. 

She has 8 books and each book costs $0.50 cents. So, we multiply the number of books by the cost per book:

8 books * $0.50/book = $4.00

Next, we add the flat fee of $2.00 for having at least one book that's over a week overdue:

$4.00 (overdue book fees) + $2.00 (flat fee) = $6.00

So, Nancy has to pay a total of $6.00.
