Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. The paragraph states that on November 30, 1999, Jordanian intelligence intercepted a telephone call between Abu Zubaydah and Khadr Abu Hoshar.

2. In this call, Abu Zubaydah said, "The time for training is over."

3. The paragraph then goes on to describe the events surrounding this intercepted call, but the key information we need is that Abu Zubaydah said "The time for training is over" on November 30, 1999.

Therefore, the final answer is:

The date that Abu Zubaydah said "The time for training is over" was November 30, 1999.
