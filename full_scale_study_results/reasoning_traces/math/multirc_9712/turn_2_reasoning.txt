Question ID: multirc_9712
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. The paragraph states that on November 30, 1999, Jordanian intelligence intercepted a telephone call between Abu Zubaydah and Khadr Abu Hoshar.

2. In this call, Abu Zubaydah said, "The time for training is over."

3. The paragraph then goes on to describe the events surrounding this intercepted call, but the key information we need is that Abu Zubaydah said "The time for training is over" on November 30, 1999.

Therefore, the final answer is:

November 30, 1999

The paragraph clearly states the date when Abu Zubaydah made this statement.
