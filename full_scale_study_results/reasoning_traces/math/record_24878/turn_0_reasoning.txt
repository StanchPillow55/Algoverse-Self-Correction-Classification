To solve this problem, we need to find the missing word in the given statement.

Given information:
- Jenson Button, a 34-year-old Formula 1 driver, was spotted window shopping with his fiancee Jessica Michibata in Bond Street, London.
- The statement mentions that Button "added: 'I'd find it difficult to have family racing in @placeholder.'"

To find the missing word, we need to analyze the context of the statement and determine what would make sense in the given situation.

Reasoning:
Based on the passage, it seems that Jenson Button was discussing the upcoming Formula 1 season and the difficulty of planning his wedding. The statement suggests that he would find it difficult to have family members racing in a particular event or location.

Given the context, the most likely missing word is "Formula 1" or "F1". This would make the statement coherent and consistent with the information provided in the passage.

Final answer:
The missing word in the statement is "Formula 1" or "F1".
The complete statement would be: "I'd find it difficult to have family racing in Formula 1."
