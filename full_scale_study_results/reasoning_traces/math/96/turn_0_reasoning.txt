Question ID: 96
Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to find out how many hours James slept. Since James slept 2/3 of what Harry slept, we multiply Harry's sleep time by 2/3:

9 hours * 2/3 = 6 hours

This means James slept 6 hours.

Next, we need to find out how many more hours Harry slept than James. To do this, we subtract the number of hours James slept from the number of hours Harry slept:

9 hours - 6 hours = 3 hours

So, Harry slept 3 more hours than James.
