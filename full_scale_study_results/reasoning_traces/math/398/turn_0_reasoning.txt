Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, let's find out how many millipedes Nancy saw. Since she saw 1/3rd as many millipedes as spiders, and she saw 90 spiders, we can calculate the number of millipedes by dividing the number of spiders by 3.

90 spiders รท 3 = 30 millipedes

Next, let's find out how many stink bugs she saw. The problem tells us that the number of stink bugs is equal to twice the number of millipedes minus 12. So, we can calculate the number of stink bugs by multiplying the number of millipedes by 2 and then subtracting 12.

(30 millipedes x 2) - 12 = 60 - 12 = 48 stink bugs

Finally, to find out how many bugs she counted total, we add up the number of spiders, millipedes, and stink bugs.

90 spiders + 30 millipedes + 48 stink bugs = 168 bugs

So, Nancy counted a total of 168 bugs.
