Question ID: 398
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, let's find out how many millipedes Nancy saw. Since she saw 1/3rd as many millipedes as spiders, and she saw 90 spiders, we calculate:

90 spiders * 1/3 = 30 millipedes

Next, let's find out how many stink bugs she saw. The problem states that the number of stink bugs is equal to twice the number of millipedes minus 12. So we calculate:

2 * 30 millipedes - 12 = 48 stink bugs

Finally, to find out the total number of bugs Nancy saw, we add up the number of spiders, millipedes, and stink bugs:

90 spiders + 30 millipedes + 48 stink bugs = 168 bugs

So, Nancy counted a total of 168 bugs.
