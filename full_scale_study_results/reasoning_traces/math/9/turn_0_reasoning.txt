==================================================

Eliza's earnings can be calculated in two parts: her regular pay for the first 40 hours, and her overtime pay for the additional hours.

First, let's calculate her regular pay. She earns $10 per hour for the first 40 hours, so her regular pay is:

40 hours * $10/hour = $400

Next, let's calculate her overtime pay. She worked 45 hours in total, so she worked 45 - 40 = 5 hours of overtime. Her overtime rate is 1.2 times her regular rate, so she earns 1.2 * $10/hour = $12/hour for overtime. Therefore, her overtime pay is:

5 hours * $12/hour = $60

Finally, we add her regular pay and her overtime pay to find her total earnings for the week:

$400 + $60 = $460

So, Eliza's earnings for this week are $460.
