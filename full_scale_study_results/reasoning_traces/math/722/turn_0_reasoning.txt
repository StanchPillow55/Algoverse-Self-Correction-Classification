==================================================

First, let's calculate how much it will cost Ron to fix the pothole himself. 

The city council will fine him $120 for unauthorized road maintenance. He also needs to buy 3 buckets of asphalt, each costing $25. 

So, the total cost of fixing the pothole is:

$120 (fine) + 3 * $25 (asphalt) = $120 + $75 = $195

If Ron doesn't fix the pothole, it will do $450 worth of damage to his car. 

Therefore, by fixing the pothole, Ron saves:

$450 (damage) - $195 (cost of fixing) = $255

So, Ron saves $255 by fixing the pothole himself.
