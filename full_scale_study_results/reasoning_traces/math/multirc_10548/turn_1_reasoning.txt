Question ID: multirc_10548
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, I need to carefully read the given paragraph and extract the relevant information.

The paragraph states:
"As Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad visited the U.N. General Assembly in New York last month, the spotlight was once again on Iran."

This clearly indicates that Mahmoud Ahmadinejad was visiting the U.N. General Assembly in New York when he made his provocative statements.

The paragraph does not mention Ahmadinejad visiting Evin Prison. Evin Prison is mentioned in the context of other women's rights activists being imprisoned there, but not in relation to Ahmadinejad's visit.

Therefore, the final answer is:

The U.N. General Assembly in New York
