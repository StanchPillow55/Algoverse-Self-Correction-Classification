==================================================

To solve this problem, I need to carefully read the given paragraph and extract the relevant information.

The paragraph states that "As Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad visited the U.N. General Assembly in New York last month, the spotlight was once again on Iran."

This clearly indicates that Mahmoud Ahmadinejad was visiting the U.N. General Assembly in New York when he made his provocative statements.

Therefore, the answer to the question "When Iranian president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad made his provocative statements, where was he visiting in New York?" is:

The U.N. General Assembly
