Question ID: 823
Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to find out how many points Julie scored in the first game. Since we know that Julie scored 4 fewer points than Sasha, we subtract 4 from Sasha's score of 14 points. 

14 - 4 = 10 points

So, Julie scored 10 points in the first game.

Next, we need to find out how many points Sasha scored in the second game. We know that Sasha scored 6 fewer points in the second game than Julie's score in the first game. So, we subtract 6 from Julie's score of 10 points.

10 - 6 = 4 points

So, Sasha scored 4 points in the second game.

Finally, to find out how many total points Sasha scored during both games, we add Sasha's scores from the first and second games.

14 + 4 = 18 points

So, Sasha scored a total of 18 points during both games.
