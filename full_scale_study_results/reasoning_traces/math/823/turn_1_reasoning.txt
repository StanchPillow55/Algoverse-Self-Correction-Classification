Question ID: 823
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we know that Sasha scored 14 points in the first game. The problem states that Julie scored 4 fewer points than Sasha in the same game. So, to find out how many points Julie scored, we subtract 4 from Sasha's score:

14 (Sasha's score) - 4 = 10 points (Julie's score)

Next, the problem states that in the second game, Sasha scored 6 fewer points than Julie's score in the first game. We know that Julie scored 10 points in the first game, so we subtract 6 from that to find out how many points Sasha scored in the second game:

10 (Julie's score in the first game) - 6 = 4 points (Sasha's score in the second game)

Finally, to find out how many total points Sasha scored during both games, we add her scores from the first and second games:

14 (Sasha's score in the first game) + 4 (Sasha's score in the second game) = 18 points

So, Sasha scored a total of 18 points during both games.
