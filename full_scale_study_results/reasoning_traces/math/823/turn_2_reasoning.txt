Question ID: 823
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

Let's break this problem down step by step.

First, we know that Sasha scored 14 points in the first game. 

Second, we know that Julie scored 4 fewer points than Sasha in the first game. So, Julie's score in the first game is 14 - 4 = 10 points.

Third, we know that Sasha scored 6 fewer points in the second game than Julie's score in the first game. So, Sasha's score in the second game is 10 - 6 = 4 points.

Finally, to find out how many total points Sasha scored during both games, we add her scores from the first and second games together. So, Sasha's total score is 14 (from the first game) + 4 (from the second game) = 18 points.

Therefore, Sasha scored a total of 18 points during both games.
