Question ID: record_67892
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1) The passage states that Edward Snowden, a former National Security Agency contractor, disclosed details about the U.S. government's vast surveillance network after the 9/11 attacks. This included how the government keeps records on billions of phone calls for potential use in terrorism investigations.

2) The key information here is that Snowden revealed classified details about the government's surveillance programs. This is the "placeholder" that needs to be filled in the query.

3) Therefore, the complete query should be:
"A hero to some and traitor to others, Snowden last year disclosed details of the vast surveillance network put in place after the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, including how the government keeps records on billions of phone calls for possible use in terrorism investigations."

Final answer: The placeholder should be "surveillance".
