Dataset Type: math
==================================================

Roger's favorite brand of coffee costs $5 per pound. The more expensive brand costs 20% more. 

To find out how much the more expensive brand costs, we need to calculate 20% of $5. 

20% of $5 is (20/100) * $5 = $1.

So, the more expensive brand of coffee costs $5 + $1 = $6 per pound.

Roger uses 1 pound of coffee per day and he is buying a week's worth of coffee. There are 7 days in a week, so he needs 7 pounds of coffee.

7 pounds of coffee at $6 per pound costs 7 * $6 = $42.

He also bought a donut for $2.

So, the total cost of everything is $42 (for the coffee) + $2 (for the donut) = $44.

Therefore, everything cost Roger $44.
