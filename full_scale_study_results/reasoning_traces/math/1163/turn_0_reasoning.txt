Dataset Type: math
==================================================

Tyrion changes his face mask two times every time he goes out. This means that every time he goes out, he uses 2 face masks. 

If he goes out three times a day, we multiply the number of times he goes out by the number of masks he uses each time he goes out. 

So, 3 times * 2 masks = 6 masks. 

This means that Tyrion uses 6 face masks every day.

If we want to find out how many face masks he uses every 2 days, we multiply the number of masks he uses in a day by 2.

So, 6 masks * 2 days = 12 masks.

Therefore, Tyrion uses 12 face masks every 2 days.
