Question ID: 1163
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

The first step is to determine how many face masks Tyrion uses in a single day. Since he changes his face mask two times every time he goes out, and he goes out three times a day, we multiply these two numbers together:

2 masks/out * 3 outs/day = 6 masks/day

This tells us that Tyrion uses 6 face masks in a single day.

Next, we need to find out how many face masks he uses in two days. To do this, we multiply the number of masks he uses in a day by 2:

6 masks/day * 2 days = 12 masks

So, Tyrion uses 12 face masks every two days.
