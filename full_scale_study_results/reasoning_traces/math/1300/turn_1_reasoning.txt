==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine how many cars Josh services in two weeks and then calculate his earnings based on the number of cars he services.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Determine the Number of Working Days in a Week:**
   - Josh's shop is open every day except Sunday and Wednesday.
   - A week has 7 days.
   - Days open in a week = 7 days - 2 days (Sunday and Wednesday) = 5 days.

2. **Calculate the Number of Working Days in Two Weeks:**
   - Since Josh works 5 days each week, in two weeks he will work:
   \[
   5 \text{ days/week} \times 2 \text{ weeks} = 10 \text{ days}
   \]

3. **Calculate the Total Number of Cars Serviced in Two Weeks:**
   - Josh services 3 cars each day.
   - Therefore, in 10 days, he will service:
   \[
   3 \text{ cars/day} \times 10 \text{ days} = 30 \text{ cars}
   \]

4. **Calculate Josh's Earnings:**
   - Josh earns $4 per car.
   - For 30 cars, his earnings will be:
   \[
   30 \text{ cars} \times 4 \text{ dollars/car} = 120 \text{ dollars}
   \]

### Final Answer:
Josh makes $120 in two weeks.
