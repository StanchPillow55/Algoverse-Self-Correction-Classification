Question ID: 1300
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine how many cars Josh services in two weeks and then calculate his earnings based on the number of cars he services.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Determine the Number of Working Days in a Week:**
   - Josh's car shop is open every day except Sunday and Wednesday.
   - A week has 7 days.
   - Days open per week = 7 days - 2 days (Sunday and Wednesday) = 5 days.

2. **Calculate the Number of Working Days in Two Weeks:**
   - Since Josh works 5 days a week, in two weeks he will work:
   - Working days in two weeks = 5 days/week × 2 weeks = 10 days.

3. **Calculate the Number of Cars Serviced in Two Weeks:**
   - Josh services 3 cars each day.
   - Total cars serviced in two weeks = 3 cars/day × 10 days = 30 cars.

4. **Calculate Josh's Earnings:**
   - Josh earns $4 per car.
   - Total earnings = 30 cars × $4/car = $120.

### Conclusion:

Josh makes $120 in two weeks.

**Final Answer: $120**
