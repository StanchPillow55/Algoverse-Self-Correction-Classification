Dataset Type: math
==================================================

Josh services 3 cars a day and gets paid $4 per car. Therefore, his daily earnings are 3 cars * $4/car = $12.

Josh is open 5 days a week (7 days in a week - 2 days when he is closed). Therefore, his weekly earnings are 5 days * $12/day = $60.

In 2 weeks, Josh's earnings would be 2 weeks * $60/week = $120.

Therefore, Josh makes $120 in 2 weeks.
