Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to calculate the total number of calories Hannah burns.

She burns 500 calories/hour doing aerobics for 2 hours, so she burns 500 * 2 = 1000 calories doing aerobics.

She burns 600 calories/hour running for 1 hour, so she burns 600 * 1 = 600 calories running.

So, the total number of calories she burns is 1000 + 600 = 1600 calories.

Hannah needs to drink 100 ml of water for every 200 calories she burns. So, to find out how much water she needs to drink, we divide the total number of calories she burns by 200, and then multiply by 100.

1600 / 200 = 8

8 * 100 = 800

So, Hannah needs to drink 800 ml of water.
