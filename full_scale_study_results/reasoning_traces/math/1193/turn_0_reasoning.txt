To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of money Jason earned for each task and then add them all together.

First, let's calculate how much Jason earned for each task:

1. Emptying the dishwasher: Jason emptied the dishwasher 6 times in two weeks. Each time he earns $0.50. So, the total amount he earned for this task is 6 times $0.50, which equals $3.00.

2. Doing his laundry: Jason did his laundry once in two weeks. Each time he earns $3.00. So, the total amount he earned for this task is 1 times $3.00, which equals $3.00.

3. Taking the trash out: Jason took the trash out twice in two weeks. Each time he earns $0.75. So, the total amount he earned for this task is 2 times $0.75, which equals $1.50.

4. Cleaning his room: Jason cleaned his room once in two weeks. Each time he earns $1.50. So, the total amount he earned for this task is 1 times $1.50, which equals $1.50.

Now, let's add up all the amounts to find out how much Jason earned in total:

$3.00 (dishwasher) + $3.00 (laundry) + $1.50 (trash) + $1.50 (room) = $9.00

So, Jason earned a total of $9.00 in a two week period.
