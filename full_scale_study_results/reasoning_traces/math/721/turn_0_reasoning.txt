==================================================

First, let's calculate the number of taps Helga can do with her arms at her sides. 

With her arms at her sides, she can tap her right foot at a rate of 300 taps per minute and her left foot at a rate of 250 taps per minute. So, the total number of taps she can do per minute with her arms at her sides is 300 + 250 = 550 taps per minute.

She dances with her arms at her sides for 5 - 2 = 3 minutes. So, the total number of taps she can do with her arms at her sides is 550 taps per minute * 3 minutes = 1650 taps.

Next, let's calculate the number of taps Helga can do with her arms raised.

With her arms raised, she can tap each foot at a rate of 200 taps per minute. So, the total number of taps she can do per minute with her arms raised is 200 taps per minute * 2 feet = 400 taps per minute.

She dances with her arms raised for 2 minutes. So, the total number of taps she can do with her arms raised is 400 taps per minute * 2 minutes = 800 taps.

Finally, let's add the number of taps she can do with her arms at her sides and the number of taps she can do with her arms raised to find the total number of taps she can do.

1650 taps + 800 taps = 2450 taps.

So, Helga can tap her feet a combined total of 2450 times.
