==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to understand the key information provided in the paragraph and then apply it to the question.

Key information from the paragraph:
1. Earth processes have not changed over time. The way things happen now is the same way things happened in the past.
2. As the environment changes, living creatures adapt. They change over time.
3. Some organisms may not be able to adapt. They become extinct.
4. Becoming extinct means they die out completely.
5. Geologists study the history of the Earth using clues from rocks and fossils.

Now, let's apply this information to the question:

Question: What happens when some organisms are not able to adapt and what does it mean for them?

Reasoning:
1. The paragraph states that some organisms may not be able to adapt as the environment changes.
2. When organisms are not able to adapt, they become extinct, which means they die out completely.
3. The paragraph also mentions that geologists study the history of the Earth using clues from rocks and fossils.
4. This suggests that when organisms become extinct, their remains (such as bones, shells, or other hard parts) can become fossil
