==================================================

To solve this problem, I will break down the key information from the paragraph and use it to explain what happens when some organisms are not able to adapt and what it means for them.

Key information from the paragraph:
1. Earth processes have not changed over time. The way things happen now is the same way things happened in the past.
2. As the environment changes, living creatures adapt. They change over time.
3. Some organisms may not be able to adapt. They become extinct.
4. Becoming extinct means they die out completely.
5. Geologists study the history of the Earth using clues from rocks and fossils.

Explanation:
When some organisms are not able to adapt to changes in their environment, they become extinct. Extinction means that the organism dies out completely and no longer exists.

The paragraph states that "Becoming extinct means they die out completely." This indicates that the organisms that are unable to adapt are no longer alive and present in the current environment.

However, the paragraph also mentions that geologists use clues from rocks and fossils to study the history of the Earth. This suggests that the remains of the extinct organisms, such as their fossilized remains, are preserved in
