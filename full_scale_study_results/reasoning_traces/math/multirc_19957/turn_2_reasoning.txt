==================================================

To solve this problem, I will break down the key information from the paragraph and use it to explain what happens when some organisms are not able to adapt and what it means for them.

Key information from the paragraph:
1. Earth processes have not changed over time.
2. As the environment changes, living creatures adapt. They change over time.
3. Some organisms may not be able to adapt.
4. Becoming extinct means they die out completely.
5. Geologists study the history of the Earth using clues from rocks and fossils.

Reasoning:
1. The paragraph states that Earth processes have not changed over time, meaning the fundamental natural processes that shape the Earth's environment have remained the same.
2. As the environment changes, living creatures must adapt to these changes in order to survive. Organisms that are able to adapt will evolve and change over time to better suit the new environmental conditions.
3. However, the paragraph mentions that some organisms may not be able to adapt to the changing environment.
4. When an organism is unable to adapt, it becomes extinct, which means it dies out completely and no longer exists.
5. Geologists study the history of the Earth by examining
