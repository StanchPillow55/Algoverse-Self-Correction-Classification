Question ID: record_31690
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given information and determine the appropriate response.

Given information:
- A former executive of Amazon, Bob Comfort, claimed that the Luxembourg government, when led by Jean-Claude Juncker, acted like a "business partner" to Amazon.
- Comfort said the Luxembourg government "helped to solve problems" for Amazon.
- The Guardian newspaper reported that Comfort said the Luxembourg government's message to Amazon was "come back and tell me."
- The query asks for a statement from Amazon denying that it received "special tax treatment" in Luxembourg.

Reasoning:
1. The former Amazon executive's statements suggest that the Luxembourg government, under Juncker's leadership, provided favorable treatment and assistance to Amazon.
2. This could imply that Amazon received "special tax treatment" or other benefits not available to other companies in Luxembourg.
3. However, the query asks for a statement from Amazon denying that it received "special tax treatment."
4. To respond to the query, Amazon would need to provide a statement that contradicts the former executive's claims and asserts that it was treated the same as any other company in Luxembourg.

Final answer:
In a statement
