Question ID: 457
Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

Katelyn initially saw 50 fairies.

Her friend then saw half as many fairies as Katelyn saw come from the east. Half of 50 is 50/2 = 25 fairies.

So, the total number of fairies became 50 (initial number) + 25 (those that came from the east) = 75 fairies.

Then, 30 fairies flew away. So, the number of fairies reduced by 30, which is 75 (total number of fairies) - 30 (those that flew away) = 45 fairies.

Therefore, there are 45 fairies remaining.
