To determine if Colby-Jack cheese is the same as Monterey Jack cheese, we need to analyze the information provided in the context.

Given information:
- Colby-Jack, or Cojack, is a cheese produced from a mixture of Colby and Monterey Jack cheeses.
- Colby-Jack has a semi-hard texture and a mild to mellow flavor.

Based on the given information, we can conclude that Colby-Jack cheese is not the same as Monterey Jack cheese. Here's the reasoning:

1. Colby-Jack is a blend of two different types of cheese: Colby and Monterey Jack.
2. If Colby-Jack were the same as Monterey Jack, it would not be described as a "mixture" or "blend" of the two cheeses.
3. The context states that Colby-Jack has a semi-hard texture and a mild to mellow flavor, which suggests that it has characteristics of both Colby and Monterey Jack cheeses.
4. Monterey Jack cheese is a distinct type of cheese with its own unique characteristics, such as a smooth,
