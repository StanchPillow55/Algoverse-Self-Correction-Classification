Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

Let's denote the amount of citrus zest and fragrance as "z", the amount of salt and sugar as "s", and the amount of oil as "o".

From the problem, we know that:

1. She uses the same amount of citrus zest as fragrance, so the total amount of these two ingredients is 2z.
2. She uses the same amount of salt as sugar, so the total amount of these two ingredients is 2s.
3. She uses twice as much oil as salt, so o = 2s.
4. She uses twice as much salt as zest, so s = 2z.
5. The total amount of all ingredients is 10 ounces, so 2z + 2s + o = 10.

We can substitute the third and fourth equations into the fifth equation to get:

2z + 2(2z) + 2(2z) = 10
2z + 4z + 4z = 10
10z = 10
z = 1

Substitute z = 1 into the third equation to get:

o = 2s = 2(2z) = 2(2*1) = 4

So, Tanya uses 4 ounces of oil.
