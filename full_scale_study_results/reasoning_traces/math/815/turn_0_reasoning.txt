==================================================

Let's denote the amount of citrus zest and fragrance as x (since they are equal), the amount of salt and sugar as y (since they are also equal), and the amount of oil as z.

From the problem, we know that:

1. She uses twice as much oil as salt, so z = 2y.
2. She uses twice as much salt as zest, so y = 2x.

We also know that the total amount of all ingredients equals 10 ounces, so:

x (zest) + x (fragrance) + y (salt) + y (sugar) + z (oil) = 10 ounces.

Substituting the equations from above into this equation, we get:

x + x + 2x + 2x + 2(2x) = 10,
8x = 10,
x = 10/8 = 1.25 ounces.

So, the amount of oil (z) is twice the amount of salt (y), which is twice the amount of zest (x), so:

z = 2y = 2(2x) = 2(2*1.25) = 5 ounces.

Therefore, Tanya uses 5 ounces of oil to make her salt scrub.
