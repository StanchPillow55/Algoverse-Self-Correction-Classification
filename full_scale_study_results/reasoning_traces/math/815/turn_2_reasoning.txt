==================================================

Let's denote the amount of citrus zest and fragrance as x (since they are equal), the amount of salt and sugar as y (since they are equal), and the amount of oil as z.

From the problem, we know that:

1. The total amount of all ingredients equals 10 ounces: x (zest) + x (fragrance) + y (salt) + y (sugar) + z (oil) = 10 ounces.

2. She uses twice as much oil as salt: z = 2y.

3. She uses twice as much salt as zest: y = 2x.

Now we can substitute y and z into the first equation:

x (zest) + x (fragrance) + 2x (salt) + 2x (sugar) + 4x (oil) = 10 ounces.

This simplifies to 10x = 10 ounces, so x = 1 ounce.

Substituting x = 1 ounce into y = 2x, we get y = 2 ounces.

Substituting y = 2 ounces into z = 2y, we get z = 4 ounces.

So, Tanya uses 4 ounces of oil to make her salt scrub.
