Dataset Type: math
==================================================

The vendor used to buy tomatoes for $.5 each and now he buys them for $.4 each. So, he saves $.5 - $.4 = $.1 per tomato.

He sells 500 tomatoes a day, so he saves $.1 * 500 = $50 a day.

There are 7 days in a week, so he saves $50 * 7 = $350 a week.

So, the tomato vendor saves $350 a week.
