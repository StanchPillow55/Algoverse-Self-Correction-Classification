Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To determine how much money the tomato vendor saves in a week by switching vendors, we need to calculate the cost difference per tomato and then apply that to the total number of tomatoes sold in a week.

**Step 1: Calculate the cost per tomato with the old vendor.**

The old vendor sold tomatoes for $0.50 each.

**Step 2: Calculate the cost per tomato with the new vendor.**

The new vendor sells tomatoes for $0.40 each.

**Step 3: Determine the savings per tomato.**

The savings per tomato is the difference between the old cost and the new cost:
\[ \text{Savings per tomato} = \text{Old cost} - \text{New cost} = 0.50 - 0.40 = 0.10 \]

**Step 4: Calculate the total number of tomatoes sold in a week.**

The vendor sells 500 tomatoes per day. Assuming he sells tomatoes every day of the week, the total number of tomatoes sold in a week is:
\[ \text{Total tomatoes per week} = 500 \times 7 = 3500 \]

**Step 5: Calculate the total savings in a week.**

To find the total savings in a week, multiply the savings per tomato by the total number of tomatoes sold in a week:
\[ \text{Total savings per week} = \text{Savings per tomato} \times \text{Total tomatoes per week} = 0.10 \times 3500 = 350 \]

**Final Answer:**

The tomato vendor saves $350 a week by switching to the new vendor.
