Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to multiply the price per pound of each fruit by the number of pounds that Winston picked, and then add up these amounts.

First, let's calculate the cost for each type of fruit:

- Peaches: $2.00 per pound x 6 pounds = $12.00
- Plums: $1.00 per pound x 8 pounds = $8.00
- Apricots: $3.00 per pound x 6 pounds = $18.00

Now, we add these amounts together to find the total cost:

$12.00 (for peaches) + $8.00 (for plums) + $18.00 (for apricots) = $38.00

So, Winston spent $38.00 on fruit.
