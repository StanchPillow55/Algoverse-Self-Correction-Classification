First, let's find out how many boxes of each type of dessert Sunny sold on each day.

On Saturday, Sunny sold 10 boxes of gingerbread and 4 fewer boxes of apple pie than he did on Sunday. We know that on Sunday, he sold 15 boxes of apple pie. So, on Saturday, he sold 15 - 4 = 11 boxes of apple pie.

On Sunday, Sunny sold 5 more boxes of gingerbread than he did on Saturday. So, on Sunday, he sold 10 + 5 = 15 boxes of gingerbread.

Now, let's calculate how much Sunny earned from selling each type of dessert on each day.

On Saturday, Sunny earned 10 * $6 = $<<10*6=60>>60 from selling gingerbread.
On Sunday, Sunny earned 15 * $6 = $<<15*6=90>>90 from selling gingerbread.

So, in total, Sunny earned $60 + $90 = $<<60+90=150>>150 from selling gingerbread over the two days.

On Saturday, Sunny earned 11 * $15 = $<<11*15=165>>165 from selling apple pie.
On Sunday, Sunny earned 15 * $15 = $<<15*15=225>>225 from selling apple pie.

So, in total, Sunny earned $165 + $225 = $<<165+225=390>>390 from selling apple pie over the two days.

Finally, let's add up the total amount Sunny earned from selling both types of desserts over the two days.

Sunny earned a total of $150 + $390 = $<<150+390=540>>540 over the two days. 

So, Sunny earned $540 for the fundraiser.
