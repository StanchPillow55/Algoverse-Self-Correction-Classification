==================================================

First, we need to determine how many plants Pat can fit in her flower bed. To do this, we need to convert the width of the plants and the space between them into the same units as the length of the flower bed. Since the flower bed is measured in feet, we'll convert the width of the plants from inches to feet. There are 12 inches in a foot, so a plant that is 12 inches wide is 1 foot wide.

Next, we need to add the width of the plant and the space between plants to find out how much space each plant (including the space around it) will take up. The plants are 1 foot wide and need 1.5 feet of space between them, so each plant will take up 1 + 1.5 = 2.5 feet.

Now, we can divide the length of the flower bed by the space each plant takes up to find out how many plants Pat can fit in her flower bed. The flower bed is 111 feet long and each plant takes up 2.5 feet, so Pat can fit 111 / 2.5 = 44.4 plants in her flower bed. Since Pat can't plant a fraction of a plant, we'll round down to the nearest whole number, so Pat can fit 44 plants in her flower bed.

Pat already owns 17 plants, so she needs to buy 44 - 17 = 27 more plants.

Each plant costs $6, so Pat will spend 27 * $6 = $162 at the store to fill up her flower bed.

So, Pat will spend $162 at the store.
