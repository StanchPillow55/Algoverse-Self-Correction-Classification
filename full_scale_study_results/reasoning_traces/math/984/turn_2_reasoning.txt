Question ID: 984
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to determine how many plants Pat can fit in her flower bed. To do this, we need to add the width of the plant (12 inches or 1 foot) and the space between each plant (1.5 feet). This gives us a total of 2.5 feet per plant.

Next, we divide the length of the flower bed (111 feet) by the space each plant takes up (2.5 feet). This gives us the total number of plants Pat can fit in her flower bed.

111 feet / 2.5 feet per plant = 44.4 plants

Since Pat can't plant a fraction of a plant, we round down to the nearest whole number, which is 44 plants.

Now, we need to subtract the number of plants Pat already owns from the total number of plants she needs. 

44 plants - 17 plants = 27 plants

Finally, we multiply the number of plants Pat needs to buy by the cost of each plant to find out how much money she will spend.

27 plants * $6 per plant = $162

So, Pat will spend $162 at the store to fill up her flower bed.
