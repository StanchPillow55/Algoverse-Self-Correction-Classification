Question ID: 984
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to determine how many plants Pat can fit in her flower bed. Since each plant grows 12 inches (or 1 foot) wide and she needs to leave 1.5 feet between each plant, each plant will take up 2.5 feet of space (1 foot for the plant itself and 1.5 feet for the space between plants).

To find out how many plants she can fit, we divide the total length of the flower bed by the space each plant takes up. So, 111 feet divided by 2.5 feet equals 44.4. Since Pat can't plant a fraction of a plant, we round down to 44 plants.

Next, we need to determine how many plants Pat needs to buy. She already has 17 plants, so she needs to buy 44 - 17 = 27 plants.

Finally, we need to calculate how much money Pat will spend. Each plant costs $6, so 27 plants will cost 27 * $6 = $162.

Therefore, Pat will spend $162 at the store to fill up her flower bed.
