==================================================

First, let's calculate the total cost for each offer.

For Furniture United, the total cost is the sum of the advance payment and the total of the monthly installments. The total of the monthly installments is the number of installments times the cost of each installment.

So, for Furniture United, the total cost is $1,350 (advance payment) + 6 * $350 (monthly installments) = $1,350 + $2,100 = $3,450.

For Cozy Homes, the total cost is the same: the sum of the advance payment and the total of the monthly installments. 

So, for Cozy Homes, the total cost is $1,100 (advance payment) + 9 * $250 (monthly installments) = $1,100 + $2,250 = $3,350.

Now, to find the cost difference between the two offers, we subtract the total cost of the cheaper offer from the total cost of the more expensive offer.

So, the cost difference is $3,450 (Furniture United) - $3,350 (Cozy Homes) = $100.

Therefore, the cost difference between the two offers is $100.
