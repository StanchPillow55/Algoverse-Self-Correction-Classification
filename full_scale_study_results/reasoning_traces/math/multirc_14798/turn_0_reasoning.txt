==================================================

To solve this problem, I will carefully read through the given paragraph and extract the relevant information to determine the color of the dog that Pester saw.

Given information:
- Pester came running into the room and saw a dog.
- Pester had seen a dog before, and he used to live with a black dog named Henry.
- Pester had never seen a brown dog before, and he thought it seemed strange to him.

From the passage, we can infer that the dog Pester saw in the room was a brown dog. This is evident from the following statement:
"He'd never seen a brown one before. It seemed strange to him, but not as strange as it was to see Linda the brown chicken in the living room last spring."

Therefore, the color of the dog that Pester saw when he came running into the room was brownish.

Final answer: The color of the dog Pester saw when he came running into the room was brownish.
