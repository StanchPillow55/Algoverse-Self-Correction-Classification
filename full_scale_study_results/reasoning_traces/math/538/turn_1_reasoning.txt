Question ID: 538
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to find out how many vlogs Emma has already made. We do this by adding the number of vlogs she made each week. 

18 vlogs (first week) + 21 vlogs (second week) + 15 vlogs (third week) = 54 vlogs

So, Emma has already made 54 vlogs in the first three weeks.

Next, we need to find out how many more vlogs she needs to make to reach her goal of 72 vlogs for the month. We do this by subtracting the number of vlogs she has already made from her goal.

72 vlogs (goal) - 54 vlogs (already made) = 18 vlogs

So, Emma needs to make 18 more vlogs to reach her goal of 72 vlogs for the month. 

Therefore, the final answer is 18 vlogs.
