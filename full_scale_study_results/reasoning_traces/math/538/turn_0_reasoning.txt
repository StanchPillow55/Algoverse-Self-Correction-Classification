Question ID: 538
Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

Emma has already made 18 vlogs in the first week, 21 vlogs in the second week, and 15 vlogs in the third week. 

To find out how many vlogs she has already made, we need to add these numbers together:

18 vlogs (first week) + 21 vlogs (second week) + 15 vlogs (third week) = 54 vlogs

So, Emma has already made 54 vlogs in three weeks.

She wants to make a total of 72 vlogs in a month. To find out how many more vlogs she needs to make, we subtract the number of vlogs she has already made from the total she wants to make:

72 vlogs (total) - 54 vlogs (already made) = 18 vlogs

Therefore, Emma needs to make 18 more vlogs in the last week of the month to reach her goal of 72 vlogs per month.
