Question ID: 554
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, let's determine how long it takes Ray to swim a mile in warm water. According to the problem, it takes him 2 minutes more than twice the time he takes in cold water. 

In cold water, he swims a mile in 16 minutes. So, twice this time is 2 * 16 = 32 minutes. 

Adding the extra 2 minutes, we find that in warm water, Ray swims a mile in 32 + 2 = 34 minutes.

Now, we need to find out how much longer it takes Ray to swim 3 miles on a hot day than a cold day. 

In cold water, to swim 3 miles, Ray would take 3 * 16 = 48 minutes.

In warm water, to swim the same distance, he would take 3 * 34 = 102 minutes.

To find out how much longer it takes Ray to swim 3 miles on a hot day than a cold day, we subtract the time it takes on a cold day from the time it takes on a hot day.

So, 102 - 48 = 54 minutes.

Therefore, Ray takes 54 minutes longer to swim 3 miles on a hot day than a cold day.
