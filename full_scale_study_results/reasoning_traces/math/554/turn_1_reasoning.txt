Question ID: 554
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, let's find out how long it takes Ray to swim a mile in warm water. According to the problem, it takes him 2 minutes more than twice as long as it does in cold water. So, we calculate twice the time it takes in cold water, which is 2 * 16 = 32 minutes. Then, we add the extra 2 minutes, getting 32 + 2 = 34 minutes.

Now, we know how long it takes Ray to swim a mile in both cold and warm water. To find out how long it takes him to swim 3 miles, we multiply these times by 3. 

In cold water, it takes him 16 * 3 = 48 minutes to swim 3 miles.
In warm water, it takes him 34 * 3 = 102 minutes to swim 3 miles.

To find out how much longer it takes him to swim 3 miles in warm water than in cold water, we subtract the time it takes in cold water from the time it takes in warm water. 

So, 102 - 48 = 54 minutes.

Therefore, it takes Ray 54 minutes longer to swim 3 miles on a hot day than a cold day.
