==================================================

First, let's find out how long it takes Ray to swim a mile in warm water. According to the problem, it takes him 2 minutes more than twice as long as it does in cold water. 

So, we multiply the time he takes in cold water by 2 and then add 2 minutes:

2 * 16 minutes + 2 minutes = 34 minutes

So, Ray swims a mile in 34 minutes when the water is warm.

Now, let's find out how long it takes him to swim 3 miles in cold and warm water.

In cold water, it would take him:

16 minutes/mile * 3 miles = 48 minutes

In warm water, it would take him:

34 minutes/mile * 3 miles = 102 minutes

To find out how much longer it takes him to swim 3 miles in warm water than in cold water, we subtract the time in cold water from the time in warm water:

102 minutes - 48 minutes = 54 minutes

So, it takes Ray 54 minutes longer to swim 3 miles on a hot day than a cold day.
