==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to find the missing word in the given sentence.

Given information:
- Rene Koiter, a 29-year-old fan of the TV show Game of Thrones, transformed himself to resemble the character Khal Drogo.
- He spent 10 months training and employed a team of 8 staff to help him with the transformation.
- The sentence states that he also took afternoon bike rides in the Californian sunshine to perfect his @placeholder tan.

The missing word is likely to be a word that describes the type of tan he achieved through the bike rides.

Possible options for the missing word:
- Bronzed
- Suntanned
- Tanned
- Glowing

Based on the context, the most appropriate word to fill the @placeholder is "tanned".

The complete sentence with the missing word filled in would be:
"He also took afternoon bike rides in the Californian sunshine to perfect his tanned appearance."

Therefore, the final answer is: tanned
