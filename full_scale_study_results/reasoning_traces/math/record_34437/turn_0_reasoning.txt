==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to find the missing word in the given sentence.

Given information:
- Rene Koiter, a 29-year-old fan of the TV show Game of Thrones, spent 10 months transforming himself into the character Khal Drogo.
- The sentence states that he "also took afternoon bike rides in the Californian sunshine to perfect his @placeholder tan."

The missing word in the sentence is likely a word that describes the type of tan he was trying to achieve.

Reasoning:
Based on the context, Rene Koiter was trying to achieve a specific type of tan to resemble the character Khal Drogo. The most likely word to fill the placeholder is "bronze" or "golden," as these types of tans would be consistent with the appearance of the Dothraki people in the Game of Thrones universe.

Therefore, the complete sentence would be:
"He also took afternoon bike rides in the Californian sunshine to perfect his bronze tan."

Final answer: The missing word is "bronze."
