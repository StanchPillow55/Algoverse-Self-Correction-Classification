Question ID: record_34437
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to find the missing word in the given sentence.

Given information:
- Rene Koiter, a 29-year-old fan of the TV show Game of Thrones, transformed himself to resemble the character Khal Drogo.
- He spent 10 months training and employed a team of 8 staff to help him with the transformation.
- The sentence states that he also took afternoon bike rides in the Californian sunshine to perfect his @placeholder tan.

The missing word in the sentence is likely a word that describes the type of tan he achieved through his bike rides.

Possible options for the missing word:
1. Bronzed
2. Tanned
3. Suntanned
4. Glowing

To determine the most appropriate word, we need to consider the context and the desired effect of the transformation.

Given that Rene Koiter was trying to perfectly resemble the character Khal Drogo, a bronzed or tanned appearance would be the most fitting description for the type of tan he achieved through his afternoon bike rides.

Therefore, the most appropriate word to fill the @placeholder
