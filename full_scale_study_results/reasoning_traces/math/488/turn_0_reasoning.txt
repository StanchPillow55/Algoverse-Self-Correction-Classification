Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to find out how many of Jana's puppies are Pomeranians. We know that two thirds of her puppies are Pomeranians. 

To find two thirds of a number, you multiply that number by 2/3. 

So, we calculate 27 (the total number of puppies) times 2/3:

27 * 2/3 = 18

So, Jana has 18 Pomeranians.

Next, we need to find out how many of these Pomeranians are girls. We know that one third of the Pomeranians are girls.

To find one third of a number, you multiply that number by 1/3.

So, we calculate 18 (the total number of Pomeranians) times 1/3:

18 * 1/3 = 6

So, Jana has 6 girl Pomeranians.

Therefore, the final answer is that Jana has 6 girl Pomeranians.
