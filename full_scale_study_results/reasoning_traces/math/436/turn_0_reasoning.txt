Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to find out how much each piece of cake weighs. To do this, we divide the total weight of the cake by the number of pieces. 

20 ounces / 8 pieces = 2.5 ounces per piece

Rory and her mom each have a piece, so that's 2 pieces in total. 

2 pieces * 2.5 ounces per piece = 5 ounces

So, Rory and her mom ate 5 ounces of cake in total. 

To find out how much cake is left, we subtract the amount of cake that was eaten from the total weight of the cake. 

20 ounces - 5 ounces = 15 ounces

So, the remaining cake weighs 15 ounces. 

Final Answer: The remaining cake weighs 15 ounces.
