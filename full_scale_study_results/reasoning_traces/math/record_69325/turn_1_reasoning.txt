==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given information and make inferences to determine the number of Americans believed to be held by the militants.

Given information:
- U.S. special forces attempted to rescue a British hostage and fellow hostage James Foley, but the mission failed.
- The passage mentions a British hostage being paraded in the latest ISIS beheading video, and it is feared he could be the next victim.

Final answer:
Based on the given information an
