Question ID: record_69325
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given information and extract the relevant details to answer the query.

Given information:
- U.S. special forces failed in an attempt to free the British hostage who ISIS militants have threatened to kill.
- The video showed a British hostage on his knees, sparking fears that he could be the next victim.
- It is mentioned that U.S. special forces attempted to rescue him and fellow hostage James Foley, but the mission failed.

The query states: "He said it is believed that 'a few' Americans are still being held by the @placeholder."

To answer this query, we need to determine the following:
1. Who is the "he" referred to in the query?
2. What is the "@placeholder" in the query?
3. How many "a few" Americans are believed to be still held by the @placeholder?

Let's address these points one by one:

1. The "he" referred to in the query is not explicitly mentioned in the given passage. However, based on the context, it seems to be referring to a spokesperson or authority figure who has made a statement about the number of Americans
