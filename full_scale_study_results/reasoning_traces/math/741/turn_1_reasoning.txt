Question ID: 741
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to carefully follow the sequence of events and perform calculations step by step.

1. **Initial Number of Birds:**
   Jeremy initially saw 12 birds in the backyard.

2. **Birds Scared Away:**
   Jeremy threw a stone at the birds, scaring away 1/3 of them. To find out how many birds were scared away, we calculate:
   \[
   \text{Number of birds scared away} = \frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4
   \]
   So, 4 birds were scared away.

3. **Birds Remaining After Scare:**
   After 4 birds were scared away, the number of birds remaining in the backyard is:
   \[
   \text{Remaining birds} = 12 - 4 = 8
   \]

4. **Additional Birds Joining:**
   A few minutes later, 20 more birds joined the remaining birds. Therefore, the total number of birds now in the backyard is:
   \[
   \text{Total birds now} = 8 + 20 = 28
   \]

Thus, after considering all the events, the final number of birds in the backyard is 28.

**Final Answer:**
28 birds are now in the backyard.
