Question ID: 741
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial Number of Birds:**
   Jeremy initially saw 12 birds in the backyard.

2. **Birds Scared Away:**
   Jeremy threw a stone and scared away 1/3 of the birds. To find out how many birds were scared away, we calculate 1/3 of 12:
   \[
   \frac{1}{3} \times 12 = 4
   \]
   So, 4 birds were scared away.

3. **Birds Remaining After Being Scared:**
   To find out how many birds remained after some were scared away, we subtract the number of scared birds from the initial number:
   \[
   12 - 4 = 8
   \]
   Thus, 8 birds remained in the backyard.

4. **Additional Birds Joining:**
   A few minutes later, 20 more birds joined the remaining birds. To find the total number of birds now in the backyard, we add the number of new birds to the number of remaining birds:
   \[
   8 + 20 = 28
   \]

5. **Final Answer:**
   Therefore, the total number of birds now in the backyard is 28.

In conclusion, after considering the birds scared away and the new birds that joined, there are now 28 birds in the backyard.
