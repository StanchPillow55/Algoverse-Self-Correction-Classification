Question ID: 741
Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to find out how many birds Jeremy scared away. We know he saw 12 birds and scared away 1/3 of them. 

To find 1/3 of 12, we multiply 12 by 1/3:

12 * 1/3 = 4 birds

So, Jeremy scared away 4 birds. 

We then subtract the number of birds scared away from the total number of birds Jeremy saw initially:

12 - 4 = 8 birds

So, there were 8 birds left in the backyard after Jeremy scared some away. 

A few minutes later, 20 more birds joined the fearless birds. We add this number to the number of birds that were left:

8 + 20 = 28 birds

So, there are now 28 birds in the backyard. 

Final Answer: There are 28 birds in the backyard.
