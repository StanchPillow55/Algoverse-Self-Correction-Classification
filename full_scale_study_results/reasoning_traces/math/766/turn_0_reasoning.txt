==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to determine how many candy bars Marissa can buy for her brother Jimmy after purchasing a ball.

1. **Identify the total amount of money Marissa had initially**:
   \[
   \text{Total money} = 80 \text{ dollars}
   \]

2. **Determine the cost of the ball**:
   \[
   \text{Cost of the ball} = 20 \text{ dollars}
   \]

3. **Calculate the remaining money after buying the ball**:
   \[
   \text{Remaining money} = \text{Total money} - \text{Cost of the ball}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Remaining money} = 80 - 20 = 60 \text{ dollars}
   \]

4. **Identify the cost of each candy bar**:
   \[
   \text{Cost of each candy bar} = 5 \text{ dollars}
   \]

5. **Calculate how many candy bars Marissa can buy with the remaining money**:
   To find the number of candy bars, we divide the remaining money by the cost of each candy bar:
   \[
   \text{Number of candy bars} = \frac{\text{Remaining money}}{\text{Cost of each candy bar}}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Number of candy bars} = \frac{60}{5} = 12
   \]

6. **Final answer**:
   Marissa bought **12 candy bars** for Jimmy.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{12}
\]
