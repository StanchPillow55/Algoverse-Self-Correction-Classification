Question ID: 766
Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

Marissa started with $80 and spent $20 on a ball. 

So, we subtract the cost of the ball from the total amount of money she had:

$80 - $20 = $60

This means Marissa had $60 left to spend on candy bars for Jimmy.

Each candy bar costs $5. To find out how many candy bars Marissa could buy, we divide the total amount of money she had left by the cost of each candy bar:

$60 รท $5 = 12

So, Marissa bought 12 candy bars for Jimmy. 

Final Answer: Marissa bought 12 candy bars for Jimmy.
