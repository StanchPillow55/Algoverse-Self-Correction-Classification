==================================================

Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we know that there are 4 teachers, and each teacher has 2 lessons per day. So, the total number of lessons in a day is 4 teachers * 2 lessons/teacher = 8 lessons.

Next, we know that the whiteboard is cleaned 3 times per lesson. So, the total number of times the whiteboard is cleaned in a day is 8 lessons * 3 cleanings/lesson = 24 cleanings.

Therefore, the whiteboard is cleaned 24 times in a day.
