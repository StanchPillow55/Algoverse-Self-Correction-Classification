Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, let's find out how many slices of pizza there are in total. Since each pizza is cut into 8 slices and there are 7 pizzas, we multiply 8 by 7 to get the total number of slices. 

8 slices/pizza * 7 pizzas = 56 slices

Next, we need to divide the total number of slices by the number of people. There are 4 people in total (Henry and his 3 friends). 

56 slices / 4 people = 14 slices/person

So, each person can have 14 slices of pizza. 

Therefore, Henry and each of his friends can have 14 slices of pizza.
