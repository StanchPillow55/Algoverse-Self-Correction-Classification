==================================================

First, let's find out how many stuffed animals Bubbles currently has. 

She has 3 puppies, 5 koalas, 2 zebras, and 4 frogs. 

So, the total number of stuffed animals she currently has is 3 + 5 + 2 + 4 = 14 stuffed animals.

Now, Bubbles wants the stuffed goats to make up 30% of all her stuffed animals. 

Let's denote the number of stuffed goats she needs to buy as G. 

So, if she buys G stuffed goats, the total number of stuffed animals she will have is 14 + G.

According to the problem, this number of goats should be 30% of all her stuffed animals. In mathematical terms, this can be written as:

G = 0.30 * (14 + G)

To solve this equation for G, we first distribute the 0.30 to both terms on the right side of the equation:

G = 0.30*14 + 0.30*G
G = 4.2 + 0.30G

Next, we subtract 0.30G from both sides of the equation to isolate G on one side:

G - 0.30G = 4.2
0.70G = 4.2

Finally, we divide both sides of the equation by 0.70 to solve for G:

G = 4.2 / 0.70
G = 6

So, Bubbles needs to buy 6 stuffed goats in order for the goats to make up 30% of all her stuffed animals.
