Question ID: 332
Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to find out how many castles are ruins. We do this by multiplying the total number of castles by 40 percent (or 0.40 in decimal form). 

220 castles * 0.40 = 88 castles

So, there are 88 ruined castles in Scotland.

Next, we need to find out how many of these ruined castles are unmanned. We do this by dividing the number of ruined castles by 2.

88 ruined castles / 2 = 44 castles

So, there are 44 unmanned ruined castles in Scotland.

Therefore, the final answer is that there are 44 unmanned ruined castles in Scotland.
