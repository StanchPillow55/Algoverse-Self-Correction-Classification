Question ID: 332
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to find out how many of the castles are ruins. We know that 40 percent of the 220 castles are ruins. To find this, we multiply 220 by 40 percent (or 0.40 in decimal form):

220 * 0.40 = 88

So, there are 88 ruined castles in Scotland.

Next, we need to find out how many of these ruined castles are unmanned. We know that half of the ruined castles are unmanned. To find this, we divide the number of ruined castles by 2:

88 / 2 = 44

So, there are 44 unmanned ruined castles in Scotland.

Therefore, the final answer is that there are 44 unmanned ruined castles in Scotland.
