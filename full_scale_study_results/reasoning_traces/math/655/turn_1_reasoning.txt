Question ID: 655
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we first need to find out how many pages Shiela has already written. Since she has finished 1/3 of the 15-page research paper, we multiply 15 by 1/3.

15 * 1/3 = 5 pages

This means Shiela has already written 5 pages of her research paper.

Next, we subtract the number of pages she has already written from the total number of pages required. 

15 - 5 = 10 pages

So, Shiela has 10 pages left to write for her research paper.
