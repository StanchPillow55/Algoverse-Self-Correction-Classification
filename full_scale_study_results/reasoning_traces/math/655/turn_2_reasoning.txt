Question ID: 655
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

Shiela is required to submit a 15-page research paper. If she has already written 1/3 of the paper, that means she has written 1/3 * 15 = 5 pages.

To find out how many pages she has left to write, we subtract the number of pages she has already written from the total number of pages required.

So, 15 - 5 = 10 pages.

Therefore, Shiela has 10 pages left to write.
