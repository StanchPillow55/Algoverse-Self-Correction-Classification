Question ID: 1039
Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to determine the dimensions of the fabric pieces that Jim needs. Since the fabric needs to be 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed, we add 2 feet to both the length and the width of the bed.

The bed is 6 feet long, so the fabric pieces need to be 6 feet + 2 feet = 8 feet long.

The bed is 8 feet wide, so the fabric pieces need to be 8 feet + 2 feet = 10 feet wide.

Next, we need to calculate the area of each fabric piece. The area of a rectangle is calculated by multiplying its length by its width. So, the area of each fabric piece is 8 feet * 10 feet = 80 square feet.

Since Jim needs two pieces of fabric, the total amount of fabric he needs is 2 * 80 square feet = 160 square feet.

So, Jim needs to buy 160 square feet of fabric.
