==================================================

First, we need to find out how much money Gabriel needs in total. He wants to buy a car for $10000 and a phone for $800. 

So, the total amount of money he needs is $10000 (for the car) + $800 (for the phone) = $10800.

Next, we need to find out how much money Gabriel already has. He has $5000 from working on weekends and his brother gave him $200. 

So, the total amount of money he has is $5000 (from working) + $200 (from his brother) = $5200.

Finally, to find out how much money Gabriel still needs, we subtract the amount of money he has from the amount of money he needs. 

So, the amount of money Gabriel still needs is $10800 (total needed) - $5200 (total has) = $5600.

Therefore, Gabriel still needs $5600.
