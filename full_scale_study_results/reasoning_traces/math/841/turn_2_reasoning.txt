Question ID: 841
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To determine how much more money Gabriel needs to buy both the car and the phone, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the Total Cost of the Car and Phone:**
   - The cost of the car is $10,000.
   - The cost of the phone is $800.
   - Therefore, the total cost for both the car and the phone is:
     \[
     10,000 + 800 = 10,800
     \]

2. **Calculate the Total Amount of Money Gabriel Currently Has:**
   - Gabriel has $5,000 from working on weekends.
   - His brother gave him an additional $200.
   - Therefore, the total amount of money Gabriel currently has is:
     \[
     5,000 + 200 = 5,200
     \]

3. **Determine How Much More Money Gabriel Needs:**
   - Subtract the total amount of money Gabriel currently has from the total cost of the car and phone:
     \[
     10,800 - 5,200 = 5,600
     \]

Therefore, Gabriel still needs $5,600 to buy both the car and the phone.

**Final Answer: Gabriel needs $5,600 more.**
