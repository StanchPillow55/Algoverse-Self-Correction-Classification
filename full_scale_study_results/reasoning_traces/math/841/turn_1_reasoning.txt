Question ID: 841
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To determine how much more money Gabriel needs to buy both the car and the phone, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total cost of the car and the phone.**

   - The cost of the car is $10,000.
   - The cost of the phone is $800.

   Therefore, the total cost is:
   \[
   10,000 + 800 = 10,800
   \]

2. **Calculate the total amount of money Gabriel currently has.**

   - Gabriel has $5,000 from working on weekends.
   - His brother gave him an additional $200.

   Therefore, the total amount of money Gabriel currently has is:
   \[
   5,000 + 200 = 5,200
   \]

3. **Determine how much more money Gabriel needs.**

   To find out how much more money Gabriel needs, subtract the amount of money he currently has from the total cost of the car and the phone:
   \[
   10,800 - 5,200 = 5,600
   \]

Therefore, Gabriel still needs $5,600 to buy both the car and the phone.

**Final Answer:** Gabriel needs an additional $5,600.
