==================================================

First, let's calculate how many sandwiches Cody ate. Since Cody ate a third of the sandwiches, and there were originally 12 sandwiches, we multiply 12 by 1/3 to find out how many sandwiches Cody ate:

12 * 1/3 = 4 sandwiches

Next, let's calculate how many sandwiches Trevor ate. Since Trevor ate a quarter of the sandwiches, and there were originally 12 sandwiches, we multiply 12 by 1/4 to find out how many sandwiches Trevor ate:

12 * 1/4 = 3 sandwiches

Now, to find out how many sandwiches are left, we subtract the number of sandwiches Cody ate and the number of sandwiches Trevor ate from the original number of sandwiches:

12 - 4 - 3 = 5 sandwiches

So, there are 5 sandwiches left.
