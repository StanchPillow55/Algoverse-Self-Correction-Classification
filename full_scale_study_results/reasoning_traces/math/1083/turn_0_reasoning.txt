==================================================

First, let's calculate how much Jenny would have spent if she bought the bananas individually. 

Each banana costs $0.80 and she bought 10 bunches of bananas with an average of 4 bananas per bunch. So, she bought a total of 10 bunches * 4 bananas/bunch = 40 bananas.

If she bought the bananas individually, she would have spent 40 bananas * $0.80/banana = $32.00.

Now, let's calculate how much she actually spent by buying the bananas in bunches.

Each bunch costs $3.00 and she bought 10 bunches, so she spent 10 bunches * $3.00/bunch = $30.00.

To find out how much she saved, we subtract the amount she actually spent from the amount she would have spent if she bought the bananas individually.

So, she saved $32.00 - $30.00 = $2.00.

Therefore, Jenny saved $2.00 by buying the bananas in bunches instead of individually.
