==================================================

First, let's find out the price of the gold jewel. We know that the price of a gold jewel is 4/5 times as much as the price of a diamond jewel. Given that the price of a diamond jewel is $2000, we can calculate the price of the gold jewel as follows:

Price of gold jewel = 4/5 * Price of diamond jewel
Price of gold jewel = 4/5 * $2000
Price of gold jewel = $1600

Next, let's find out the price of the silver jewel. We know that the cost of a silver jewel is $400 less than the price of gold. Given that the price of a gold jewel is $1600, we can calculate the price of the silver jewel as follows:

Price of silver jewel = Price of gold jewel - $400
Price of silver jewel = $1600 - $400
Price of silver jewel = $1200

Finally, let's find out the total price for all three jewels. We can do this by adding up the prices of the diamond, gold, and silver jewels:

Total price = Price of diamond jewel + Price of gold jewel + Price of silver jewel
Total price = $2000 + $1600 + $1200
Total price = $4800

So, the total price for all three jewels is $4800.
