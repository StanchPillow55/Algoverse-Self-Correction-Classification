To solve this problem, we need to find the number of helicopters in the private fleet of the company mentioned in the query.

Given information:
- The company has one of the world's largest private fleets of helicopters.
- The helicopters are used as a means of bypassing extremely congested roads.

2. The term "one of the world's largest private fleets" implies that the company's helicopter fleet is substantial, likely in the range of several hundred or more helicopters.

Estimation:
Based on the given information an
