To solve this problem, we need to find the number of helicopters in the private fleet of the company mentioned in the query.

Given information:
- The company has one of the world's largest private fleets of helicopters.
- The helicopters are used as a means of bypassing extremely congested roads.

Since the question does not provide any specific information about the size of the company's helicopter fleet, we cannot determine the exact number of helicopters. However, we can make some reasonable assumptions and provide an estimate.

Assumptions:
1. The company is a large corporation or organization that operates in a major metropolitan area or region with significant traffic congestion.
2. The company's helicopter fleet is likely to be in the range of hundreds or even thousands of helicopters, as it is described as one of the world's largest private fleets.

Reasoning:
1. Large corporations or organizations that operate in congested areas often use helicopters as a means of transportation to bypass traffic and improve efficiency.
2. The phrase "one of the world's largest private fleets of helicopters" suggests that the company's fleet is substantial, likely consisting of hundreds or even thousands of helicopters.

Estimated Answer:
