Question ID: record_65403
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine the placeholder value in the given statement.

Given information:
- Holder refused to answer a question.
- Several hours later, Grassley said Holder had provided him a document in a classified setting.

The placeholder in the statement is the pronoun that Grassley used to refer to Holder.

Step 1: Identify the possible placeholder values.
The pronoun that Grassley could have used to refer to Holder is "he".

Step 2: Substitute the placeholder value and evaluate the statement.
The statement with the placeholder value filled in would be:
"Holder refused to answer, but several hours later Grassley said he had provided him a document in a classified setting."

This statement makes sense and is consistent with the given information.

Therefore, the final answer is:
The placeholder value is "he".
