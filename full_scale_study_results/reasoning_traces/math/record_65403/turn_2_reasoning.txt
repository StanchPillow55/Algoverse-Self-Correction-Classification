Question ID: record_65403
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine the missing information in the query, which is the name of the person who provided the document to Senator Grassley in a classified setting.

Given information:
- Attorney General Eric Holder refused to answer a question.
- Several hours later, Senator Charles Grassley said that @placeholder had provided him a document in a classified setting.

Step 1: Identify the missing information.
The missing information in the query is the name of the person who provided the document to Senator Grassley in a classified setting, represented by the placeholder @placeholder.

Step 2: Analyze the context and determine the possible answer.
Based on the information provided in the passage, it seems that the person who provided the document to Senator Grassley in a classified setting is likely someone from the Department of Justice (DoJ), as the passage mentions the controversy surrounding the "gun-walking" tactics that have "tainted [Holder's] tenure at the Justice Department."

Therefore, the most likely answer for the @placeholder is the name of a DoJ official, possibly someone other than Attorney General Eric Holder.

Final answer:
The name of the person who provided the document to Senator
