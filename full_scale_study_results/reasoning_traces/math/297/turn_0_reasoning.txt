Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, let's find out how many crates Sam sold in total. 

Over the weekend, he sold 20 crates. On Tuesday, he sold 15 crates. On Wednesday, he sold 12 crates. And on Thursday, he sold 18 crates. 

So, the total number of crates he sold is 20 + 15 + 12 + 18 = 65 crates.

Sam's target was to sell 120 crates. 

So, to find out by how many crates Sam was off from his target, we subtract the number of crates he actually sold from his target. 

That is, 120 - 65 = 55 crates.

So, Sam was off by 55 crates from his target for the week.
