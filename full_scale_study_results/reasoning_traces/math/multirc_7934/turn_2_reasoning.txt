To determine where Toodles was when the duck bit his ear, I will carefully go through the details provided in the paragraph.

2. Toodles ran all around the pond, barking at the ducks.
3. Toodles jumped into the pond and started swimming toward the ducks, chasing them.
4. One of the ducks poked Toodles with its beak and then bit him right on one of his floppy ears.
5. Toodles barked and ran out of the pond because the duck hurt his ear.
6. Soaking wet, he ran toward where I was eating a sandwich on the grass and curled right up in my lap.

2. Toodles ran over to the pond and started chasing the ducks in the water.
3. One of the ducks bit Toodles' ear while
