==================================================

To determine where Toodles was when the duck bit his ear, I will carefully go through the details provided in the paragraph.

The paragraph states that Toodles "jumped into the pond and started swimming toward the ducks, chasing around his new playmates." This indicates that Toodles was in the pond when the duck bit his ear.

The paragraph then states that "Toodles barked and ran out of the pond because the duck hurt his ear. Soaking wet, he ran toward where I was eating a sandwich on the grass and curled right up in my lap so I could make him feel better."

This clearly shows that Toodles was in the pond when the duck bit his ear, and then he ran out of the pond, soaking wet, and went to the person who was sitting on the grass eating a sandwich.

Therefore, the answer to the question "Where was Toodles when the duck bit his ear?" is that Toodles was in the pond when the duck bit his ear.

Final answer: Toodles was in the pond when the duck bit his ear.
