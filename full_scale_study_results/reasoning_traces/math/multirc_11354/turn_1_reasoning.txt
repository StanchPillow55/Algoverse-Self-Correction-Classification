==================================================

To determine which province of Portugal contains no cosmopolitan cities, I will analyze the information provided in the paragraph.

The paragraph states:
"The Algarve is more recognizable for impenetrable blocks of tourist apartments, hotels, and meticulously manicured golf courses. And beaches. Think Algarve and the mind pictures long, glorious stretches of golden sands, secluded coves framed by odd ochre-colored rock formations, and deep green waters."

This suggests that the Algarve region, which is located in the southern part of Portugal, is known for its tourist accommodations and beaches, rather than cosmopolitan cities.

The paragraph also states:
"Most of Portugal is known for quaint towns, medieval castles, and grand palaces. The Algarve is more recognizable for impenetrable blocks of tourist apartments, hotels, and meticulously manicured golf courses."

Therefore, base
