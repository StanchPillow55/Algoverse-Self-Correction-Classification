==================================================

To determine who rinsed their mouth, we need to carefully analyze the details provided in the paragraph.

The key details are:
1. Elettra stuck the recipe slip into her pocket-book without looking at it.
2. The prescription was for a preparation of arsenic, which Matilde had formerly taken.
3. Matilde had a number of doses of the arsenic medicine put away in a drawer.
4. After Elettra left, Matilde opened one of the folded papers, looked at the white powder, and tasted a little of it on her finger.
5. Matilde then took a package of a different white substance from the same drawer, opened it, looked at it, smelled it, and touched it with the tip of her tongue very cautiously.
6. Immediately after tasting the second substance, Matilde rinsed her mouth with water.

Based on the information provided, it is clear that Matilde, not Elettra, rinsed her mouth after tasting the second substance from the drawer.

Therefore, the answer is:
Matilde rinsed her mouth.
