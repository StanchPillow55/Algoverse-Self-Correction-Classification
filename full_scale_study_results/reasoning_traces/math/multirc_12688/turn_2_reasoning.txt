==================================================

To determine who rinsed their mouth, we need to carefully analyze the details provided in the paragraph.

The key details are:
1. Elettra took a slip of paper with a recipe written on it and put it in her pocket without looking at it.
2. The recipe was for a preparation of arsenic, which Matilde had previously taken.
3. After Elettra left, Matilde opened a drawer and found several doses of the arsenic preparation.
4. Matilde opened one of the folded papers, looked at the white powder, and tasted a small amount of it.
5. Matilde then took a package of a different white substance, looked at it, smelled it, and touched it with her tongue very carefully.
6. After tasting the second substance, Matilde immediately rinsed her mouth with water.

Based on the information provided, the person who rinsed their mouth was Matilde, not Elettra.

The paragraph clearly states that after Matilde tasted the second substance, "she immediately rinsed her mouth with water, before she tied up the package again, shut the drawer, and put the key into her pocket
