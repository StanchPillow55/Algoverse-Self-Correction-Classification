Question ID: 313
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we first need to figure out the ages of Noah and Cera six years ago. 

Given that Cera is currently 46 years old, six years ago she was 46 - 6 = 40 years old.

The problem states that six years ago, Noah was half as old as Cera. Therefore, Noah was 40 / 2 = 20 years old six years ago.

The problem also states that the population of Chile six years ago was 3000 times the age of Noah. Therefore, the population of Chile six years ago was 3000 * 20 = 60,000.

Finally, the problem states that the population of Chile six years ago was half what it is now. Therefore, the current population of Chile is 60,000 * 2 = 120,000.

So, the population of Chile now is 120,000.
