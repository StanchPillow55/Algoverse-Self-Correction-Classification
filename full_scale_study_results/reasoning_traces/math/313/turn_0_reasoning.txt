Dataset Type: math
==================================================

Let's start by finding out how old Noah was six years ago. Since Cera is currently 46 years old, she was 46 - 6 = 40 years old six years ago. 

Since Noah was half as old as Cera six years ago, this means Noah was 40 / 2 = 20 years old six years ago.

The problem states that the population of Chile six years ago was 3000 times the age of Noah. So, the population of Chile six years ago was 3000 * 20 = 60,000.

The problem also states that the population of Chile six years ago was half what it is now. Therefore, the current population of Chile is 60,000 * 2 = 120,000.

So, the population of Chile now is 120,000.
