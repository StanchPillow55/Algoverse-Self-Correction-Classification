==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to find out Noah's age six years ago, and then use that to calculate the population of Chile now.

First, let's find out how old Noah was six years ago. We know that six years ago, Noah was half as old as Cera. So, we subtract six from Cera's current age to find out how old she was six years ago, which is 46 - 6 = 40 years old. Since Noah was half as old as Cera six years ago, Noah was 40 / 2 = 20 years old six years ago.

Next, we know that the population of Chile six years ago was 3000 times the age of Noah. So, we multiply Noah's age six years ago by 3000 to find out the population of Chile six years ago, which is 20 * 3000 = 60,000.

Finally, we know that the population of Chile six years ago was half what it is now. So, we multiply the population of Chile six years ago by 2 to find out the population of Chile now, which is 60,000 * 2 = 120,000.

Therefore, the population of Chile now is 120,000.
