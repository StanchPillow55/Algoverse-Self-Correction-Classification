Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, let's calculate how many hours Frankie watched TV from Monday to Friday excluding Wednesday.

On Monday and Tuesday, he watched a 1-hour episode each night, which is 1 hour * 2 days = 2 hours.

On Thursday, he watched a 1-hour episode and a 30-minute show, which is 1.5 hours.

On Friday, he watched two 1-hour episodes, which is 1 hour * 2 = 2 hours.

So, from Monday to Friday excluding Wednesday, he watched 2 hours + 1.5 hours + 2 hours = 5.5 hours.

Since he watched 7 hours of TV in all, the time he spent watching TV on Wednesday is 7 hours - 5.5 hours = 1.5 hours.

Since each episode on Wednesday is 30 minutes, or 0.5 hours, the number of episodes he watched on Wednesday is 1.5 hours / 0.5 hours/episode = 3 episodes.

Therefore, Frankie watched 3 episodes on Wednesday.
