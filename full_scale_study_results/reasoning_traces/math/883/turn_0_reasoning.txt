==================================================

Let's denote the duration of Elaina's usual concerts as x. According to the problem, her final concert is twice as long as her usual concerts and also includes a 15-minute encore. This can be represented by the equation:

2x + 15 = 65

We can solve this equation for x to find the duration of Elaina's usual concerts. First, we subtract 15 from both sides of the equation:

2x = 65 - 15
2x = 50

Then, we divide both sides of the equation by 2:

x = 50 / 2
x = 25

So, Elaina's usual concerts run for 25 minutes.
