The problem involves a geometric progression, where the common ratio is the increase in price every two months. 

First, we need to find out how many two-month periods are in 36 months. 

36 months ÷ 2 months = 18 two-month periods

The price increases by 20% every two months, so the common ratio of our geometric progression is 1 + 20% = 1.20 (since the price is increasing, the ratio is greater than 1).

In a geometric progression, the nth term can be found using the formula:

a_n = a_1 * r^(n-1)

where a_n is the nth term, a_1 is the first term, r is the common ratio, and n is the term number.

In this case, a_1 is the initial price of the bag of marbles, which is $20. The common ratio r is 1.20, and n is the number of two-month periods, which is 18.

So, we substitute these values into the formula:

a_18 = $20 * (1.20)^(18-1)
     = $20 * (1.20)^17

Now, we calculate the value:

a_18 = $20 * (1.20)^17 ≈ $185.90

So, after 36 months, a bag of marbles would cost approximately $185.90.
