==================================================

The problem involves a geometric progression, where the common ratio is the increase in price every two months. 

First, we need to determine the percentage increase in decimal form. 20% is equal to 0.20. 

Next, we need to add 1 to this decimal to represent the total price after each increase. So, 1 + 0.20 = 1.20. 

Now, we need to determine how many two-month periods are in 36 months. We do this by dividing 36 by 2, which gives us 18. 

This means that the price of the marbles increases 18 times over the course of 36 months. 

To find the final price, we multiply the initial price by the common ratio raised to the power of the number of increases. 

So, the final price is $20 * (1.20)^18. 

We can calculate (1.20)^18 using a calculator to get approximately 35.6535. 

Multiplying this by $20 gives us a final price of approximately $713.07. 

So, after 36 months, a bag of marbles would cost approximately $713.07.
