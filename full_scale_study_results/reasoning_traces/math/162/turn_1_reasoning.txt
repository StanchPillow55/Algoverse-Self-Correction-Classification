==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to understand that the price of the marbles is increasing exponentially, not linearly. This means that each new price is 20% higher than the previous price, not 20% higher than the original price.

First, let's calculate how many times the price increases over 36 months. Since the price increases every 2 months, we divide 36 by 2 to get 18 price increases.

Next, we need to calculate the new price after each increase. The formula for an exponential increase is:

New Price = Old Price * (1 + Rate of Increase)

In this case, the rate of increase is 20%, or 0.20. So the formula becomes:

New Price = Old Price * (1 + 0.20)

We start with the original price of $20 and apply this formula 18 times.

Let's do the calculations:

1. After 2 months: $20 * 1.20 = $24
2. After 4 months: $24 * 1.20 = $28.80
3. After 6 months: $28.80 * 1.20 = $34.56
4. After 8 months: $34.56 * 1.20 = $41.47
5. After 10 months: $41.47 * 1.20 = $49.76
6. After 12 months: $49.76 * 1.20 = $59.71
7. After 14 months: $59.71 * 1.20 = $71.65
8. After 16 months: $71.65 * 1.20 = $85.98
9. After 18 months: $85.98 * 1.20 = $103.18
10. After 20 months: $103.18 * 1.20 = $123.81
11. After 22 months: $123.81 * 1.20 = $148.57
12. After 24 months: $148.57 * 1.20 = $178.28
13. After 26 months: $178.28 * 1.20 = $213.94
14. After 28 months: $213.94 * 1.20 = $256.73
15. After 30 months: $256.73 * 1.20 = $308.08
16. After 32 months: $308.08 * 1.20 = $369.70
17. After 34 months: $369.70 * 1.20 = $443.64
18. After 36 months: $443.64 * 1.20 = $532.37

So, after 36 months, a bag of marbles would cost $532.37.
