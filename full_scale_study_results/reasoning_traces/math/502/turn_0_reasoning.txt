==================================================

First, let's calculate the number of gifts Cherrie bought for her friends based on their preferences. 

Two of her friends want 5 gifts each. So for these two friends, Cherrie bought 2 friends * 5 gifts = 10 gifts.

Three of her friends want 2 gifts each. So for these three friends, Cherrie bought 3 friends * 2 gifts = 6 gifts.

So, in total, Cherrie bought 10 gifts + 6 gifts = 16 gifts for her friends based on their preferences.

Cherrie then decided to buy 10 more random gifts. So, in total, Cherrie bought 16 gifts + 10 gifts = 26 gifts.

So, Cherrie bought a total of 26 gifts.
