Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, I will go through the details provided in the paragraph and extract the relevant information to determine the consequence of Ben talking back to the Judge.

Key details from the paragraph:
1. Ben crashes his 1956 Porsche 356 Speedster in the rural hamlet of Grady, South Carolina.
2. The crash damages the fence of local Judge Evans.
3. Judge Evans sentences Ben to community service at a nearby hospital.
4. Ben offers to pay for the fence, but the stern judge increases his community service each time he talks back.
5. Defeated, Ben reports to the hospital, where Nurse Packer humbles him by ordering him to clock in and out, as would a factory worker.

Reasoning:
The paragraph clearly states that the consequence of Ben talking back to the Judge was that the Judge increased his community service each time he talked back. The paragraph mentions that Ben offered to pay for the fence, but the Judge still increased the community service as a punishment for Ben talking back.

Final answer:
The consequence of Ben talking back to the Judge was that the Judge increased the period of community service each time Ben talked back.
