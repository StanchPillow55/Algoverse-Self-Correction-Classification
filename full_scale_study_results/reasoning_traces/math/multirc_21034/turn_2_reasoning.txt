==================================================

To solve this problem, I will go through the details provided in the paragraph and identify the consequence of Ben talking back to the judge.

Key details from the paragraph:
- Dr. Benjamin Stone, a young surgeon, decides to leave his job in the emergency room in Washington D.C. to become a plastic surgeon in Beverly Hills.
- On his last day, his relationship with his co-workers is not warm, and a cake has the phrase "Good riddance, asshole" written on it.
- Ben decides to drive to Beverly Hills in a 1956 Porsche 356 Speedster, but he crashes in the rural town of Grady, South Carolina.
- The crash damages the fence of local Judge Evans, who sentences Ben to community service at a nearby hospital.
- Ben offers to pay for the fence, but the judge increases his community service each time he talks back.

From the information provided, the consequence of Ben talking back to the judge is that the judge increased the period of community service each time Ben talked back.

The paragraph states: "Ben offers to pay for the fence, but the stern judge increases his community service each time he talks back."

Therefore, the final answer
