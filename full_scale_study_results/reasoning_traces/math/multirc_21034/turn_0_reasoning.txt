To solve this problem, I will go through the paragraph step by step and identify the relevant information that answers the question.

According to the paragraph, when Ben offered to pay for the fence he damaged in the crash, the stern judge increased his community service each time he talked back. The paragraph states:

"Ben offers to pay for the fence, but the stern judge increases his community service each time he talks back."

This directly answers the question - the consequence of Ben talking back to the Judge was that the Judge increased the period of community service.

The paragraph provides the complete reasoning and work to arrive at this answer. No additional calculations or explanations are needed.

Final Answer:
The consequence of Ben talking back to the Judge was that the Judge increased the period of community service each time Ben talked back.
