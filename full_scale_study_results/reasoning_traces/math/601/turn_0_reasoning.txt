Let's break this down year by year.

Year 1: 
Steve starts with 5 games from his birthday. He then buys 1 game per month for 12 months. This is 1 game/month * 12 months = 12 games. He also gets 5 games for Christmas. So, for the first year, Steve has 5 (birthday) + 12 (bought) + 5 (Christmas) = 22 games.

Year 2: 
Steve starts the year with the 22 games he already has. He then buys 2 games per month for 12 months. This is 2 games/month * 12 months = 24 games. He also gets 5 games for Christmas. So, for the second year, Steve has 22 (from previous year) + 24 (bought) + 5 (Christmas) = 51 games.

Year 3: 
Steve starts the year with the 51 games he already has. He then buys 4 games per month for 12 months. This is 4 games/month * 12 months = 48 games. He also gets 5 games for Christmas. So, for the third year, Steve has 51 (from previous years) + 48 (bought) + 5 (Christmas) = 104 games.

So, after 3 years, Steve has 104 games.
