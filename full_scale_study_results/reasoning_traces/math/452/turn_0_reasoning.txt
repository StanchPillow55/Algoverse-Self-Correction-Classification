==================================================

To find the average speed of the car during the trip, we need to divide the total distance traveled by the total time taken.

First, let's calculate the total distance traveled. The car drives at 60 mph for 2 hours, and then 30 mph for 1 hour. 

The distance traveled during the first part of the trip is speed multiplied by time, which is 60 mph * 2 hours = 120 miles.

The distance traveled during the second part of the trip is 30 mph * 1 hour = 30 miles.

So, the total distance traveled is 120 miles + 30 miles = 150 miles.

Next, let's calculate the total time taken. The car drives for 2 hours at 60 mph, and then for 1 hour at 30 mph. So, the total time taken is 2 hours + 1 hour = 3 hours.

Finally, we can calculate the average speed by dividing the total distance by the total time. This is 150 miles / 3 hours = 50 mph.

So, the car's average speed during this trip is 50 mph.
