==================================================

First, we need to calculate how much money Julie spent on clothes. Since she spent 20% of her money on clothes, we multiply $500 by 20% (or 0.20) to find out how much she spent.

$500 * 0.20 = $100

So, Julie spent $100 on clothes.

Next, we subtract the money she spent on clothes from her total amount of money to find out how much money she had left.

$500 - $100 = $400

So, after buying clothes, Julie had $400 left.

Then, we need to calculate how much money Julie spent on CDs. Since she spent 25% of her remaining money on CDs, we multiply $400 by 25% (or 0.25) to find out how much she spent.

$400 * 0.25 = $100

So, Julie spent $100 on CDs.

Finally, we subtract the money she spent on CDs from her remaining amount of money to find out how much money she had left.

$400 - $100 = $300

So, after buying clothes and CDs, Julie had $300 left. 

Therefore, Julie has $300 left.
