==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine who the speaker is in the given quote.

Given information:
- The passage discusses the Australian Open, where Roger Federer defeated Andy Murray and advanced to the semifinals to face Rafael Nadal.
- The quote is from a player talking about how tough it is to play against Nadal.

Based on the context provided in the passage, the most likely speaker of the quote is Roger Federer.

Reasoning:
1. The passage mentions that Federer and Nadal are set to face each other in the semifinals, implying that Federer is the one who made the statement about Nadal being tough to play against.
2. Federer is the one who advanced to the semifinals, so he would be the one commenting on his upcoming opponent, Nadal.
3. The passage does not mention any other players making comments about Nadal, so Federer is the most logical choice as the speaker of the quote.

Therefore, the final answer is:

Roger Federer told reporters when asked about Nadal, "He's been tough to play against, no doubt."
