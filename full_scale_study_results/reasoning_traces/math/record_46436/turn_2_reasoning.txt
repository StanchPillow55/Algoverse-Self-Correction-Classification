Dataset Type: math
==================================================

I'm afraid I don't have enough information to solve this problem. The passage provided does not contain any mathematical information or a specific question that I can work through step-by-step. The query about the player hitchhiking from one location to another also does not provide enough details for me to perform any calculations or reasoning. As an AI math problem solver, I would need a clearly stated mathematical question with relevant numerical data in order to demonstrate my problem-solving abilities. Without a well-defined math problem to work with, I cannot provide a complete solution. Please let me know if you have a different math-related question I can assist with.
