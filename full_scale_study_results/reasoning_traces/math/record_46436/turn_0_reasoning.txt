==================================================

To solve this problem, I will need to make some assumptions and inferences based on the information provided in the passage, as the query does not contain enough details to directly answer the question.

Given information:
- Silas Nacita is a college football player at Baylor University.
- He was no longer eligible to play football because he accepted housing from a family friend.

4. Let's also assume that Silas Nacita had a tough shift at
