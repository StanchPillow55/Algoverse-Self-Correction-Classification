To determine how many hours a week John spends learning, we need to calculate the total time he spends in class during the weekdays and the additional time he spends on the weekend.

**Step 1: Calculate the total minutes spent in class each day.**

John has 6 normal periods and 2 extra classes each day. Each class is 40 minutes long.

\[
\text{Total classes per day} = 6 + 2 = 8 \text{ classes}
\]

\[
\text{Minutes per day} = 8 \times 40 = 320 \text{ minutes}
\]

**Step 2: Calculate the total minutes spent in class each week.**

John attends school 5 days a week.

\[
\text{Minutes per week} = 320 \times 5 = 1600 \text{ minutes}
\]

**Step 3: Calculate the extra learning time on the weekend.**

John spends \(\frac{1}{16}\) of his weekly class minutes on each weekend day.

\[
\text{Extra learning time per day} = \frac{1}{16} \times 1600 = 100 \text{ minutes}
\]

Since he does this on both Saturday and Sunday:

\[
\text{Total extra learning time for the weekend} = 100 \times 2 = 200 \text{ minutes}
\]

**Step 4: Calculate the total learning time per week.**

Add the weekday class minutes and the weekend extra learning minutes:

\[
\text{Total weekly learning time} = 1600 + 200 = 1800 \text{ minutes}
\]

**Step 5: Convert the total minutes to hours.**

There are 60 minutes in an hour, so:

\[
\text{Total hours per week} = \frac{1800}{60} = 30 \text{ hours}
\]

Thus, John spends a total of 30 hours a week learning.

**Final Answer:**

John spends 30 hours a week learning.
