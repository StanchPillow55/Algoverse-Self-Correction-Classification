Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, let's calculate how many minutes John spends in class each day. He has 6 normal periods and 2 extra classes, which makes a total of 8 classes per day. Each class is 40 minutes long, so he spends 8 classes * 40 minutes/class = 320 minutes per day in class.

Since he goes to class for 5 days a week, he spends 320 minutes/day * 5 days/week = 1600 minutes per week in class.

On Saturday and Sunday, he spends 1/16 of his weekly minutes each day as extra learning time. This means he spends 1600 minutes/week * 1/16 = 100 minutes each on Saturday and Sunday.

So, in total, he spends 100 minutes/day * 2 days/week = 200 minutes on the weekend.

Adding this to the time he spends in class during the week, we find that he spends 1600 minutes + 200 minutes = 1800 minutes per week learning.

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we can convert this to hours by dividing by 60: 1800 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 30 hours.

So, John spends 30 hours a week learning.
