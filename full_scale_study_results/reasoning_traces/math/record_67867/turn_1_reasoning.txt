Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine the geological period during which the Torvosaurus dinosaur lived.

Given information:
- Torvosaurus was a type of carnivorous dinosaur.
- Torvosaurus lived between 153 and 148 million years ago.

The geological period during which Torvosaurus lived was the @placeholder.

Reasoning:
The given information states that Torvosaurus lived between 153 and 148 million years ago. This time period corresponds to the later part of the Jurassic period.

The Jurassic period is one of the three major geological periods of the Mesozoic Era, which lasted from approximately 252 million years ago to 66 million years ago. The Jurassic period specifically lasted from approximately 201 million years ago to 145 million years ago.

Therefore, the geological period during which Torvosaurus lived was the Jurassic period.

Final answer:
The Torvosaurus dinosaur lived during the later part of the Jurassic period.
