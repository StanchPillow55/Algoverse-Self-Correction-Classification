Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine the geological period during which the Torvosaurus dinosaur lived.

Given information:
- Torvosaurus was a type of carnivorous dinosaur.
- Torvosaurus was discovered in Portugal and was estimated to be up to 10 meters long and weigh between 4 and 5 tons.
- Torvosaurus was originally believed to be Torvosaurus tanneri, a dinosaur species from North America, but further analysis suggested it may be a new species named Torvosaurus gurney.

Based on the information provided, we can determine that Torvosaurus lived during the Jurassic period.

The Jurassic period is the second period of the Mesozoic era, lasting from approximately 201 to 145 million years ago. Carnivorous dinosaurs, such as Torvosaurus, were prevalent during the Jurassic period.

Therefore, the placeholder in the question should be filled with "Jurassic period".

Final answer:
Torvosaurus were a type of carnivorous dinosaur that lived between 153
