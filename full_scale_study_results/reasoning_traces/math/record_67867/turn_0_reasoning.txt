==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine the geological period during which the Torvosaurus dinosaur lived.

Given information:
- Torvosaurus was a type of carnivorous dinosaur.
- Torvosaurus was discovered in Portugal and is estimated to have been up to 10 meters long and weighed between four and five tons.
- Torvosaurus is believed to have lived during the later part of a specific geological period.

The question asks us to fill in the @placeholder with the name of the geological period during which Torvosaurus lived.

Based on the information provided, we can determine that Torvosaurus lived during the Jurassic period.

Reasoning:
1. The passage states that Torvosaurus was a carnivorous dinosaur, which means it lived during the Mesozoic Era, as dinosaurs were the dominant land animals during this era.
2. The Mesozoic Era is divided into three periods: Triassic, Jurassic, and Cretaceous.
3. The passage mentions that Torvosaurus lived between 153 and 148 million years ago,
