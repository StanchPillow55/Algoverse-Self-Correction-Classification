Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, let's find out how many shells team Alphas found. Since they found 40% of the total number of shells, we multiply 700 by 40% (or 0.4):

700 * 0.4 = 280 shells

So, team Alphas found 280 shells.

Next, we need to find out how many shells were left after team Alphas found their shells. We subtract the number of shells found by team Alphas from the total number of shells:

700 - 280 = 420 shells

So, there were 420 shells left after team Alphas found their shells.

Now, let's find out how many shells team The finders found. Since they found 60% of the remaining shells, we multiply 420 by 60% (or 0.6):

420 * 0.6 = 252 shells

So, team The finders found 252 shells.

Finally, to find out how many shells team Gogetters found, we subtract the number of shells found by team The finders from the number of shells left after team Alphas found their shells:

420 - 252 = 168 shells

So, team Gogetters found 168 shells.

Therefore, the final answer is that team Gogetters found 168 shells.
