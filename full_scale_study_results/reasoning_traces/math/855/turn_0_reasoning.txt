Dataset Type: math
==================================================

Let's denote the ages as follows:

- Your age = x
- Your brother's age = x + 3 (since you are three years younger than your brother)
- Your sister's age = x - 2 (since you are two years older than your sister)
- Your mom's age = 3(x + 3) - 1 (since your mom is one less than three times your brother's age)

According to the problem, the sum of all your ages is 87. So we can set up the following equation:

x + (x + 3) + (x - 2) + [3(x + 3) - 1] = 87

Solving this equation step by step:

- First, simplify the equation: 6x + 8 = 87
- Then, subtract 8 from both sides of the equation: 6x = 79
- Finally, divide both sides of the equation by 6 to solve for x: x = 79 / 6 â‰ˆ 13.17

However, age is typically expressed as a whole number, so we can round this to the nearest whole number, which is 13.

Therefore, you are 13 years old.
