Question ID: 855
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

Let's denote the ages with variables:

Let's say your age is X. 

According to the problem, your brother is 3 years older than you, so his age is X + 3. 

Your sister is 2 years younger than you, so her age is X - 2. 

Your mom's age is one less than three times your brother's age, so her age is 3*(X + 3) - 1.

The sum of all your ages is 87, so we can set up the following equation:

X + (X + 3) + (X - 2) + [3*(X + 3) - 1] = 87

Solving this equation will give us your age (X).

Let's simplify the equation:

3X + 1 + 3X + 9 - 1 = 87
6X + 9 = 87
6X = 87 - 9
6X = 78
X = 78 / 6
X = 13

So, you are 13 years old.
