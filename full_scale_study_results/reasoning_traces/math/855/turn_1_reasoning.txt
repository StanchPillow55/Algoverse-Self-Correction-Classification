==================================================

Let's denote the ages as follows:

Let B be the age of the brother.
Let S be the age of the sister.
Let M be the age of the mother.
Let X be your age.

From the problem, we know the following:

1. X = B - 3 (You are three years younger than your brother)
2. X = S + 2 (You are two years older than your sister)
3. M = 3B - 1 (Your mom's age is one less than three times your brother's age)
4. B + S + M + X = 87 (When you add all your ages, you get 87)

We can substitute the first three equations into the fourth equation to solve for the ages.

Substituting X = B - 3 into the fourth equation, we get:

B + S + M + (B - 3) = 87
2B + S + M - 3 = 87
2B + S + M = 90

Substituting X = S + 2 into the above equation, we get:

2B + (S + 2) + M = 90
2B + S + M = 88

Substituting M = 3B - 1 into the above equation, we get:

2B + S + (3B - 1) = 88
5B + S - 1 = 88
5B + S = 89

Now we have two equations with two variables (B and S):

2B + S = 88
5B + S = 89

Subtracting the first equation from the second, we get:

3B = 1
B = 1/3

But age cannot be a fraction, so there must be a mistake in the problem or in our calculations. Let's check our work.

We made a mistake when we substituted X = S + 2 into the equation 2B + S + M = 90. It should be:

2B + (B - 3 + 2) + M = 90
3B - 1 + M = 90
3B + M = 91

Substituting M = 3B - 1 into the above equation, we get:

3B + (3B - 1) = 91
6B - 1 = 91
6B = 92
B = 92 / 6
B = 15.33

Again, age cannot be a fraction, so there must be a mistake in the problem or in our calculations. Let's check our work again.

We made a mistake when we substituted X = S + 2 into the equation 2B + S + M = 90. It should be:

2B + (B - 3 + 2) + (3B - 1) = 87
6B - 2 = 87
6B = 89
B = 89 / 6
B = 14.83
