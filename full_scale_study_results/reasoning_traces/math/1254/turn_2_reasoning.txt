Question ID: 1254
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to calculate how long it would take for the coat of varnish to dry on 6 paintings with the old varnish. 

To do this, we multiply the number of paintings by the time it takes for the varnish to dry on one painting. 

So, 6 paintings * 7 minutes/painting = 42 minutes.

Next, we calculate how long it would take for the coat of varnish to dry on 6 paintings with the new varnish. 

Again, we multiply the number of paintings by the time it takes for the varnish to dry on one painting. 

So, 6 paintings * 12 minutes/painting = 72 minutes.

Finally, we subtract the time it would take with the old varnish from the time it would take with the new varnish to find out how much longer it would take with the new varnish. 

So, 72 minutes - 42 minutes = 30 minutes.

Therefore, it would take 30 minutes longer for the coat of varnish on 6 paintings with the new varnish to dry as it would with the old varnish.
