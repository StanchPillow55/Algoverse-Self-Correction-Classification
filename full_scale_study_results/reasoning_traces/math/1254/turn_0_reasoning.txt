==================================================

First, we need to calculate how long it would take for the coat of varnish to dry on 6 paintings with the old varnish. 

The old varnish takes 7 minutes to dry on one painting, so for 6 paintings, it would take 7 minutes/painting * 6 paintings = 42 minutes.

Next, we need to calculate how long it would take for the coat of varnish to dry on 6 paintings with the new varnish. 

The new varnish takes 12 minutes to dry on one painting, so for 6 paintings, it would take 12 minutes/painting * 6 paintings = 72 minutes.

To find out how much longer it will take with the new varnish, we subtract the time it takes with the old varnish from the time it takes with the new varnish: 

72 minutes (new varnish) - 42 minutes (old varnish) = 30 minutes.

So, it will take 30 minutes longer for the coat of varnish on 6 paintings with the new varnish to dry as it would with the old varnish.
