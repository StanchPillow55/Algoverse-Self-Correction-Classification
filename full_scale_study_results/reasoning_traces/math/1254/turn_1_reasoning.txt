==================================================

First, we need to calculate how long it would take for the coat of varnish to dry on 6 paintings with the old varnish. 

The time it takes for one painting to dry with the old varnish is 7 minutes. Therefore, for 6 paintings, we multiply 7 minutes by 6:

7 minutes/painting * 6 paintings = 42 minutes

Next, we calculate how long it would take for the coat of varnish to dry on 6 paintings with the new varnish. 

The time it takes for one painting to dry with the new varnish is 12 minutes. Therefore, for 6 paintings, we multiply 12 minutes by 6:

12 minutes/painting * 6 paintings = 72 minutes

Finally, to find out how much longer it will take with the new varnish, we subtract the time it would take with the old varnish from the time it would take with the new varnish:

72 minutes - 42 minutes = 30 minutes

So, it will take 30 minutes longer for the coat of varnish on 6 paintings with the new varnish to dry as it would with the old varnish.
