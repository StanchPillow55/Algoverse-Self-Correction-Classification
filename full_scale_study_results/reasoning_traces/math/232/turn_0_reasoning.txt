Dataset Type: math
==================================================

If there were half as many bugs as ants in the garden, it means there were 1/2 * 50 ants = <<50*0.5=25>>25 bugs in the garden.

The total number of insects in the garden is the sum of the ants and bugs, which is 50 ants + 25 bugs = <<50+25=75>>75 insects. 

So, there were 75 insects in the garden.
