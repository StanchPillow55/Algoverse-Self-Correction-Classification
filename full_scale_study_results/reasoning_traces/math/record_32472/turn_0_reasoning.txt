To solve this problem, we need to understand the context and the information provided in the passage, and then use logical reasoning to determine the answer.

Given information:
- Ferrari has extended Felipe Massa's contract until the end of the 2013 season.
- Ferrari made this announcement to "put an end to all the speculation" about Massa's future with the team.

Reasoning:
1. The passage mentions that there has been speculation about Massa's future with Ferrari. This suggests that there were rumors or discussions about Massa potentially leaving the team or being replaced.
2. By extending Massa's contract until the end of the 2013 season, Ferrari is trying to put an end to this speculation and uncertainty about Massa's future with the team.
3. The announcement of the contract extension is a way for Ferrari to clearly communicate their commitment to Massa and shut down any rumors or speculation about his future with the team.

Therefore, the placeholder in the statement is likely referring to Ferrari, as the team made the announcement to "put an end to all the speculation" about Massa's future.

Final answer:
The placeholder in the statement is Ferrari.
