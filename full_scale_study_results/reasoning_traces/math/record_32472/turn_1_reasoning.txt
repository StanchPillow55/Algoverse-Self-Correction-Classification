==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given information and determine the reasoning behind Ferrari's decision to announce the renewal of Felipe Massa's contract.

Given information:
- Ferrari has extended Felipe Massa's contract until the end of the 2013 season.
- Ferrari stated that "one of the reasons that pushed @placeholder and Massa to decide on announcing the renewal today (was) to put an end to all the speculation."

Reasoning:
1. Speculation about Massa's future:
   - Prior to the announcement, there was likely speculation about Massa's future with Ferrari, possibly linking him to other teams or suggesting that Ferrari might replace him.
   - By announcing the contract extension, Ferrari aimed to put an end to this speculation and confirm Massa's continued presence at the team.

2. Potential impact on Fernando Alonso:
   - The passage mentions that the announcement was also made "in a bid to help Fernando Alonso win his first Ferrari drivers' title since 2007."
   - Keeping Massa at Ferrari could provide stability and support for Alonso's championship aspirations, as Massa is a known quantity and can contribute to the team's overall performance.
