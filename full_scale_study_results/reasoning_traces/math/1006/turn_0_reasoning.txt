Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to find the volume of the pool. The volume of a rectangular prism (which is the shape of the pool) is found by multiplying the length, width, and height (or depth in this case). 

So, the volume of the pool is 14 feet (width) * 25 feet (length) * 4 feet (depth) = 1400 cubic feet.

Next, we need to convert this volume into gallons. The pool company instructed them to multiply the volume by 5.9 to get the number of gallons. 

So, the number of gallons needed is 1400 cubic feet * 5.9 = 8260 gallons.

Finally, we need to find the cost to fill the pool. The pool company charges $0.10 per gallon. 

So, the cost to fill the pool is 8260 gallons * $0.10/gallon = $826.

Therefore, it will cost the Smith family $826 to fill their pool.
