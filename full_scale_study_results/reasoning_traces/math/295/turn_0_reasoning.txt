Question ID: 295
Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

On the first day, Darren did a total of 100 pushups + 50 squats + 20 dumbbell presses = 170 exercises.

On the second day, he did 100 pushups + 20 more pushups = 120 pushups.
He also did 50 squats - 10 squats = 40 squats.
And he did 20 dumbbell presses * 2 = 40 dumbbell presses.

So on the second day, Darren did a total of 120 pushups + 40 squats + 40 dumbbell presses = 200 exercises.

Adding the total number of exercises from the first and second day, Darren did 170 exercises + 200 exercises = 370 exercises in total.

So, the total count of the activities Darren has done in the two days is 370.
