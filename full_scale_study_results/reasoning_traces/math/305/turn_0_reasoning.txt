Question ID: 305
Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

John arm wrestles 20 people and beats 80% of them. 

To find out how many people he beats, we multiply the total number of people he wrestles by the percentage he beats. 

So, 20 (people) * 0.80 (or 80%) = 16 people. 

This means John beats 16 people. 

To find out how many people he loses to, we subtract the number of people he beats from the total number of people he wrestles. 

So, 20 (people) - 16 (people) = 4 people. 

Therefore, John loses to 4 people.
