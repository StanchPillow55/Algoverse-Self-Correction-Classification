Question ID: 864
Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to calculate the total number of burritos that were eaten at the picnic.

We know that there were 50 students at the picnic and each student was given 10 burritos. So, the total number of burritos eaten by the students is 50 students * 10 burritos/student = 500 burritos.

We also know that Mr. George ate 20 burritos. 

So, the total number of burritos eaten at the picnic is 500 burritos (eaten by students) + 20 burritos (eaten by Mr. George) = 520 burritos.

We know that George ordered 600 burritos for the picnic. So, to find out the number of leftover burritos, we subtract the total number of burritos eaten at the picnic from the total number of burritos ordered.

That is, 600 burritos (ordered) - 520 burritos (eaten) = 80 burritos.

So, there were 80 burritos leftover from the picnic.
