Question ID: 634
Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

Let's start by finding out how many fish Darren caught. The problem states that Darren caught 6 less fish than Naomi. Since Naomi caught 17 fish, we can subtract 6 from 17 to find out how many fish Darren caught.

17 - 6 = 11

So, Darren caught 11 fish.

The problem also states that Tommy caught 3 more fish than Darren. So, we can add 3 to the number of fish Darren caught to find out how many fish Tommy caught.

11 + 3 = 14

So, Tommy caught 14 fish.

Therefore, Tommy caught 14 fish.
