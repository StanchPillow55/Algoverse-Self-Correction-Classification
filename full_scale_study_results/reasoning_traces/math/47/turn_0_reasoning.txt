==================================================

First, let's figure out how many blue ties John bought. We know that each blue tie costs $40 and he spent $200 on them. So, we divide the total amount he spent by the cost of each tie to find out how many he bought:

$200 รท $40 = 5 blue ties

We know that John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties. So, he bought:

2 * 5 = 10 red ties

The red ties cost 50% more than the blue ties. So, each red tie costs:

$40 + ($40 * 50/100) = $60

Finally, to find out how much John spent on red ties, we multiply the number of red ties by the cost of each red tie:

10 * $60 = $600

So, John spent $600 on red ties.

To find out how much John spent on ties in total, we add the amount he spent on blue ties to the amount he spent on red ties:

$200 (for blue ties) + $600 (for red ties) = $800

So, John spent $800 on ties.
