Dataset Type: math
==================================================

Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we know that Madeline ate 6 grapes.

Second, her brother used 5 times as many grapes as Madeline did to make grape juice. Since Madeline ate 6 grapes, her brother used 5 * 6 = 30 grapes.

Third, their mother used the remaining grapes to make 4 pies. We know that each pie requires 12 grapes, so for 4 pies, their mother used 4 * 12 = 48 grapes.

Adding up all the grapes used, we get 6 (Madeline) + 30 (brother) + 48 (mother) = 84 grapes.

So, there were 84 grapes at the beginning.
