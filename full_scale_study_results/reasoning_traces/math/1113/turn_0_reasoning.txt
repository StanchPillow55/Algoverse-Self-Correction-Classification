==================================================

The problem involves a series of temperature changes. We start with an initial temperature of 2 degrees Celsius.

First, the temperature drops 8 degrees Celsius overnight. To find the new temperature, we subtract 8 from the initial temperature:

2 degrees - 8 degrees = -6 degrees Celsius

So, after the temperature drop, it is -6 degrees Celsius.

Then, the temperature increases by 3 degrees Celsius in the morning. To find the new temperature, we add 3 to the current temperature:

-6 degrees + 3 degrees = -3 degrees Celsius

So, after the temperature increase, it is -3 degrees Celsius.

Therefore, the temperature in the morning is -3 degrees Celsius.
