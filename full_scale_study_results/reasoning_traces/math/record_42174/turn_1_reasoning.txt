Question ID: record_42174
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to find the value of the placeholder in the given query.

Given information:
- China has 649 million internet users.
- 80% of the users, which is 557 million, use smartphones and tablets to connect.
- The rate of growth is slowing, with 31 million new users added in 2014 compared to 54 million in 2013.

The query mentions the "Great Firewall", which refers to the system of internet censorship and content filtering implemented by the Chinese government.

Therefore, the placeholder in the query is likely to be "Great Firewall", as it is a key factor that makes the Chinese user experience very different from outside of China.

The final answer is:
@placeholder = Great Firewall
