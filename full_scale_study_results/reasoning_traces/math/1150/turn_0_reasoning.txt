Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

Patricia initially has 30 roses.

She gave 24 roses to her mother, so we subtract 24 from 30 to find out how many roses she has left.

30 - 24 = 6 roses

Then, Patricia bought 15 more roses. We add this to the number of roses she has left.

6 + 15 = 21 roses

So, Patricia now has 21 roses. 

This is our final answer.
