==================================================

Zaid's monthly salary is $6000.

First, we calculate how much he spends on rent and car fuel. 

He spends 1/4 of his salary on rent, which is 1/4 * $6000 = $1500.

He spends 1/3 of his salary on car fuel, which is 1/3 * $6000 = $2000.

So, the total amount he spends on rent and car fuel is $1500 + $2000 = $3500.

Subtracting this from his total salary, we find that he has $6000 - $3500 = $2500 left.

Next, Zaid donates half of the remaining amount to his favorite charity. So, he donates 1/2 * $2500 = $1250.

After this donation, he has $2500 - $1250 = $1250 left.

Then, he gives his daughter $200 and his wife $700, which totals to $200 + $700 = $900.

Subtracting this from the amount he has left after the donation, we find that he has $1250 - $900 = $350 left.

So, after all these expenses and donations, Zaid will still have $350.
