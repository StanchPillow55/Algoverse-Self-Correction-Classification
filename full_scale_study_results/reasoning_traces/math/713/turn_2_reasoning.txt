Question ID: 713
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to find out how many square feet two thirds of the bathroom is. We do this by multiplying the total square footage of the bathroom (36 sq ft) by 2/3:

36 sq ft * 2/3 = 24 sq ft

So, two thirds of the bathroom is 24 square feet.

Next, we need to find out how many mosaic tiles Mr Boarden needs to cover this area. We know that he needs 24 tiles for every square foot, so we multiply the number of square feet by the number of tiles per square foot:

24 sq ft * 24 tiles/sq ft = 576 tiles

Therefore, Mr Boarden would need 576 mosaic tiles to cover two thirds of his 36 sq ft bathroom.
