Question ID: 713
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to find out how many square feet two thirds of the bathroom is. We do this by multiplying the total square footage of the bathroom (36 sq ft) by 2/3:

36 sq ft * 2/3 = 24 sq ft

Next, we need to find out how many mosaic tiles are needed to cover this area. We do this by multiplying the area that needs to be covered (24 sq ft) by the number of tiles needed per square foot (24 tiles):

24 sq ft * 24 tiles/sq ft = 576 tiles

Therefore, Mr Boarden would need 576 mosaic tiles to cover two thirds of his 36 sq ft bathroom.
