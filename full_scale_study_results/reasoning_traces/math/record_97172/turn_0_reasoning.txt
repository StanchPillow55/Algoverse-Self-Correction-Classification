To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given passage and determine the appropriate word to fill in the placeholder.

The passage discusses the Occupy Wall Street protests and how the Republican Party (GOP) has largely ignored them so far. However, the passage suggests that the protests are gaining more attention and the GOP can no longer afford to ignore them, as they could shape the political landscape leading up to the November elections.

The passage also mentions that the Democratic Party has embraced the populist message of the protests, which align with their efforts to blame the rich for America's economic woes and demand that they pay higher taxes.

Given this context, the placeholder is likely referring to the Republican Party, as the passage suggests that some in the Republican Party hope the protesters will disappear with the first frost, taking the controversy with them.

Therefore, the appropriate word to fill in the placeholder is "GOP".

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The passage discusses the Occupy Wall Street protests and how the Republican Party (GOP) has largely ignored them so far.
2. The passage suggests that the protests are gaining more attention and the GOP can no longer afford to ignore them, as they could shape the political landscape leading up to the November
