==================================================

To solve this problem, I will need to analyze the given passage and determine the appropriate placeholder to fill in the query.

The passage discusses the growing public protests against Wall Street, known as the Occupy Wall Street movement, and how the Republican party has largely ignored these protests so far. However, the passage suggests that the Republicans can no longer afford to ignore the issue, as the protests have gained significant attention and support from President Obama and the Democratic party.

The passage also mentions that some conservatives suspect that Democratic partisans are quietly fueling the protests, implying that the protests may be politically motivated.

Given this context, the most appropriate placeholder in the query would be "Republicans", as the passage suggests that some Republicans hope the protesters will disappear with the first frost, taking the controversy with them.

Therefore, the complete query would be:

"Some in the Republicans hope the protesters will disappear with the first frost, taking the controversy with them."

This answer is based on the information provided in the passage and the logical reasoning that the Republican party would be the most likely to hope the Occupy Wall Street protests would disappear, given their reluctance to address the issues raised by the protesters.
