Question ID: 207
Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to find out the weight of each candied apple. Since each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as each candied apple and each chocolate bar weighs 40g, each candied apple weighs 40g/2 = 20g.

Next, we need to find out the total weight of the chocolate bars and the candied apples. 

The total weight of the chocolate bars is 25 chocolate bars * 40g/chocolate bar = 1000g.

The total weight of the candied apples is 80 candied apples * 20g/candied apple = 1600g.

Finally, we add the total weight of the chocolate bars and the candied apples to find the total weight of Joe's bag of candy. 

The total weight of Joe's bag of candy is 1000g + 1600g = 2600g.

So, Joe's bag of candy weighs 2600 grams.
