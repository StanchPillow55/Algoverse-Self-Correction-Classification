Question ID: 127
Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we first need to find out how many friends Amy made. We know that Amy made 20 more friends than Lily. Since Lily made 50 friends, we can add 20 to 50 to find out how many friends Amy made. 

50 (Lily's friends) + 20 (the extra friends Amy made) = 70 friends

So, Amy made 70 friends.

To find out how many friends Lily and Amy have together, we add the number of friends Lily made to the number of friends Amy made.

50 (Lily's friends) + 70 (Amy's friends) = 120 friends

So, Lily and Amy have 120 friends together. 

Therefore, the final answer is 120 friends.
