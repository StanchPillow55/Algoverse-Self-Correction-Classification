Dataset Type: math
==================================================

John is buying phones for himself, his 2 kids, and his wife. That's a total of 4 phones.

The first 2 phones are full price, so they cost $600 each. 

So, the cost of the first 2 phones is 2 * $600 = $1200.

The next 2 phones are half price, so they cost $600/2 = $300 each.

So, the cost of the next 2 phones is 2 * $300 = $600.

Adding the cost of the first 2 phones and the next 2 phones, we get $1200 + $600 = $1800.

Therefore, John paid $1800 for all the phones.
