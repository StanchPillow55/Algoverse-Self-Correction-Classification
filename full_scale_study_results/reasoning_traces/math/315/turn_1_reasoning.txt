Question ID: 315
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, let's calculate the total number of people Martha invited. She invited 2 families with 6 people each and 3 families with 4 people each. 

The total number of people from the 2 families is 2 * 6 = 12 people.
The total number of people from the 3 families is 3 * 4 = 12 people.

So, Martha invited a total of 12 + 12 = 24 people.

Next, let's calculate the total number of people who couldn't come. We know that 8 people couldn't come due to illness, and 1/4 of that number had previous commitments. 

The number of people with previous commitments is 1/4 * 8 = 2 people.

So, the total number of people who couldn't come is 8 + 2 = 10 people.

Finally, to find out how many people show up for Martha's party, we subtract the number of people who couldn't come from the total number of people invited.

The number of people who show up is 24 - 10 = 14 people.

So, 14 people show up for Martha's party.
