Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, let's calculate the total number of people Martha invited. She invited 2 families with 6 people each, which is 2*6 = <<2*6=12>>12 people. She also invited 3 families with 4 people each, which is 3*4 = <<3*4=12>>12 people. So, Martha invited a total of 12 + 12 = <<12+12=24>>24 people.

Then, let's calculate the total number of people who couldn't come. We know that 8 people couldn't come due to illness. Additionally, 1/4 of that number had previous commitments. So, 1/4 * 8 = <<1/4*8=2>>2 people had previous commitments.

Therefore, a total of 8 + 2 = <<8+2=10>>10 people couldn't come to the party.

Finally, let's subtract the number of people who couldn't come from the total number of people invited to find out how many people showed up for Martha's party. So, 24 - 10 = <<24-10=14>>14 people showed up for Martha's party.

Answer: \boxed{14}.
