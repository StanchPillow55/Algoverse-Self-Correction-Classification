Question ID: 771
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, let's calculate how much money Bennet makes from selling his eggplants. He sells 20 eggplants for $3 each, so the total amount of money he makes from the eggplants is 20 * $3 = $60.

Bennet wants to make a total of $135. He has already made $60 from selling his eggplants, so he needs to make $135 - $60 = $75 more from selling his ears of corn.

Bennet has 25 ears of corn to sell. To find out how much he should sell each ear of corn for, we divide the total amount of money he needs to make from the corn ($75) by the number of ears of corn he has to sell (25). 

So, $75 รท 25 = $3.

Therefore, Bennet should sell each ear of corn for $3.
