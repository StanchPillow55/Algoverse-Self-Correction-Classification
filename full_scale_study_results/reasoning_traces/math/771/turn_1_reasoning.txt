Question ID: 771
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, let's calculate how much money Bennet makes from selling his eggplants. He sells 20 eggplants for $3 each, so he makes 20 * $3 = $60 from selling eggplants.

Bennet wants to make a total of $135. He has already made $60 from selling eggplants, so he needs to make $135 - $60 = $75 more from selling his ears of corn.

Bennet has 25 ears of corn to sell. To find out how much he should sell each ear of corn for, we divide the total amount of money he needs to make by the number of ears of corn he has. So, $75 รท 25 = $3.

Therefore, Bennet should sell each ear of corn for $3 to reach his goal of making $135.
