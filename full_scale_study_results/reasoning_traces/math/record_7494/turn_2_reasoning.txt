To solve this problem, we need to analyze the information provided in the passage and extract the relevant details to answer the query.

Given information:
- Sir Michael Caine, the film legend, has a Â£10 million mansion in the Surrey countryside.
- His younger brother, Stanley Micklewhite, lived in a rundown terrace in a West London suburb.
- While Michael Caine's mansion has well-maintained 20-acre lawns, Stanley's modest house has weeds growing through the concrete slabs in the tiny paved-over front garden, and the paint is flaking off the windows.
- Michael Caine has personally overseen the transformation of his mansion, while Stanley's life was more modest.
- While Michael Caine's career bloomed, Stanley's film career foundered, and he had to work in Selfridges in London to make ends meet.
- The brothers had a distant relationship in the final years of Stanley's life.

To answer the query, we need to compare the success and fortunes of the two brothers.

Step 1: Identify the key differences between the brothers' careers and fortunes.
