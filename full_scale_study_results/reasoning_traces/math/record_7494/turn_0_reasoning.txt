To solve this problem, we need to analyze the information provided in the passage and extract the relevant details to answer the query.

Given information:
- Sir Michael Caine, the film legend, has a Â£10 million mansion in the Surrey countryside.
- His younger brother, Stanley Micklewhite, lived in a rundown terrace in a West London suburb.
- Michael Caine has personally overseen the transformation of his 20-acre lawns into something rivaling a stately home.
- Stanley's house has weeds growing through concrete slabs in the tiny paved-over front garden, and the paint is flaking off the windows.
- While Michael Caine went on to amass a fortune, Stanley's film career foundered, and he made ends meet by working in Selfridges in London.
