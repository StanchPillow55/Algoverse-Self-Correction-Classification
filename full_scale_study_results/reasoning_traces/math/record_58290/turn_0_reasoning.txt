To solve this problem, we need to find the name of the club where Alex Neil has been a player-manager for nearly 10 years.

Given information:
- Alex Neil is on the brink of being confirmed as Norwich City's new manager.
- Alex Neil was the player-boss at a club before travelling south for talks with Norwich City.
- The club where Alex Neil was the player-boss is referred to as @placeholder in the query.

Step 1: Identify the club where Alex Neil was the player-boss.
Based on the information provided, the club where Alex Neil was the player-boss is Hamilton. The passage states that "The Hamilton player-boss was left to weigh up his future when the New Douglas Park board accepted an approach from the Championship club."
