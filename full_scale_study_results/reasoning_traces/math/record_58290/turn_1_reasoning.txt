Question ID: record_58290
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to identify the club where Alex Neil has been a player-manager for nearly 10 years. The passage provides us with some key information:

1. **Alex Neil's Current Role**: He is currently a player-manager at a club.
2. **Duration at Current Club**: He has been at this club for nearly 10 years.
3. **Clubs Mentioned**: The passage mentions Norwich City and Hamilton, with a focus on Neil's potential move to Norwich.

From the passage, we can infer that Alex Neil is currently with Hamilton, as it states that "the Hamilton player-boss was left to weigh up his future" and "Hamilton confirmed the East Anglia club has made an approach." This indicates that he is indeed the player-manager at Hamilton.

Now, we need to fill in the placeholder in the query with the name of the club where Alex Neil has been for nearly 10 years. Given the context, the answer is Hamilton.

Thus, the final answer to the query is:

**Hamilton**
