==================================================

First, we need to find out how much material Jo uses to make one small mask and one large mask.

For small masks, she uses 2 yards of material to make 4 masks. Therefore, the amount of material used for one small mask is 2 yards / 4 = 0.5 yard.

For large masks, she uses 2.25 yards of material to make 3 masks. Therefore, the amount of material used for one large mask is 2.25 yards / 3 = 0.75 yard.

Next, we need to calculate how much material she would need to make 20 small masks and 8 large masks.

For 20 small masks, she would need 20 * 0.5 yard = 10 yards.

For 8 large masks, she would need 8 * 0.75 yard = 6 yards.

Finally, we add these two amounts together to find the total amount of material she would need. 

So, 10 yards + 6 yards = 16 yards.

Therefore, Jo would need 16 yards of material to make 20 small and 8 large masks for her class.
