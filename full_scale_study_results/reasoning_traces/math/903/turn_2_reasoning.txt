Question ID: 903
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, let's determine how much material Jo needs to make one small mask and one large mask.

For small masks, Jo uses 2 yards of material to make 4 masks. So, to find out how much material she uses for one mask, we divide the total yards by the number of masks:

2 yards ÷ 4 masks = 0.5 yards per small mask

For large masks, Jo uses 2.25 yards of material to make 3 masks. So, to find out how much material she uses for one mask, we divide the total yards by the number of masks:

2.25 yards ÷ 3 masks = 0.75 yards per large mask

Now that we know how much material Jo uses for each type of mask, we can calculate how much material she would need to make 20 small masks and 8 large masks.

For the small masks:

20 small masks × 0.5 yards per small mask = 10 yards

For the large masks:

8 large masks × 0.75 yards per large mask = 6 yards

Finally, we add the two amounts together to find out how much material Jo would need in total:

10 yards + 6 yards = 16 yards

So, Jo would need 16 yards of material to make 20 small masks and 8 large masks for her class.
