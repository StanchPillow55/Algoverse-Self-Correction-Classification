==================================================

First, let's determine how much material Jo uses to make one mask of each size.

For the small masks, she uses 2 yards of material to make 4 masks. Therefore, the amount of material used for one small mask is 2 yards / 4 masks = 0.5 yards/mask.

For the large masks, she uses 2.25 yards of material to make 3 masks. Therefore, the amount of material used for one large mask is 2.25 yards / 3 masks = 0.75 yards/mask.

Now that we know how much material is needed for one mask of each size, we can calculate how much material is needed for the quantities Jo wants to make.

For the 20 small masks, she would need 20 masks * 0.5 yards/mask = 10 yards.

For the 8 large masks, she would need 8 masks * 0.75 yards/mask = 6 yards.

Adding these two quantities together, Jo would need 10 yards + 6 yards = 16 yards of material to make 20 small and 8 large masks for her class.
