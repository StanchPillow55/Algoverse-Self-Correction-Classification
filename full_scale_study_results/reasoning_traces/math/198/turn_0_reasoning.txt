==================================================

Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Elaine initially had 20 Pokemon cards.

2. In the first month, she collected three times the number of cards she initially had. So, she collected 3 * 20 = <<3*20=60>>60 cards.

3. In the second month, she collected 20 fewer cards than those she collected in the first month. So, she collected 60 - 20 = <<60-20=40>>40 cards.

4. In the third month, she collected twice the combined number of Pokemon cards she collected in the first and second months. So, she collected 2 * (60 + 40) = 2 * 100 = <<2*(60+40)=200>>200 cards.

5. To find the total number of cards she has now, we add the number of cards she initially had to the number of cards she collected each month. So, she has 20 + 60 + 40 + 200 = <<20+60+40+200=320>>320 cards in total.

Therefore, Elaine now has 320 Pokemon cards.
