Question ID: 1152
Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

The probability of two independent events both occurring is found by multiplying the probabilities of each event.

The first ticket has a 20% chance of winning, which can be expressed as 0.20 in decimal form.

The second ticket is three times more likely to win than the first ticket, so its probability of winning is 3 * 0.20 = 0.60.

To find the probability that both tickets win, we multiply these probabilities together:

0.20 * 0.60 = 0.12

To express this as a percentage, we multiply by 100:

0.12 * 100 = 12%

So, the probability that both tickets are winners is 12%.
