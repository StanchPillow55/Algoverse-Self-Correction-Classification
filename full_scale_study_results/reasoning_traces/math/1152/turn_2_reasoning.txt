Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine the probability that both lottery tickets Mark buys are winners. We are given the probabilities for each ticket and need to calculate the combined probability of both events occurring.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Understand the probabilities for each ticket:**
   - The first ticket has a 20% chance of winning. This can be expressed as a probability of 0.20.
   - The second ticket is three times more likely to win than the first ticket. Therefore, the probability of the second ticket winning is \(3 \times 0.20 = 0.60\).

2. **Calculate the probability of both tickets winning:**
   - The probability of both independent events (both tickets winning) occurring is the product of their individual probabilities.
   - Therefore, the probability that both tickets are winners is:
     \[
     P(\text{both tickets win}) = P(\text{first ticket wins}) \times P(\text{second ticket wins}) = 0.20 \times 0.60
     \]

3. **Perform the multiplication:**
   \[
   0.20 \times 0.60 = 0.12
   \]

4. **Convert the probability to a percentage:**
   - To express the probability as a percentage, multiply by 100:
   \[
   0.12 \times 100 = 12\%
   \]

### Final Answer:
The probability that both lottery tickets are winners is 12%.
