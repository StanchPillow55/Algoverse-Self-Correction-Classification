==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to understand that the probability of two independent events both happening is the product of their individual probabilities.

First, let's look at the probability of the first ticket winning. We're told that it's 20%, or 0.20 when expressed as a decimal.

Next, we're told that the second ticket is three times more likely to win than the first. To find this probability, we multiply the probability of the first ticket by 3:

0.20 * 3 = 0.60

So, the second ticket has a 60% chance of winning, or 0.60 when expressed as a decimal.

Now, to find the probability that both tickets win, we multiply their individual probabilities together:

0.20 * 0.60 = 0.12

So, the probability that both tickets are winners is 0.12, or 12% when expressed as a percentage. 

Therefore, the final answer is 12%.
