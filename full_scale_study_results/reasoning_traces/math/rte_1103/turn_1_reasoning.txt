==================================================

To determine if the given premise entails the hypothesis, we need to analyze the logical relationship between the two statements.

Premise: Climate change is with us. A decade ago, it was conjecture. Now the future is unfolding before our eyes. Canada's Inuit see it in disappearing Arctic ice and permafrost.

Hypothesis: Greenhouse effect changes global climate.

Step 1: Understand the premise and the hypothesis.
The premise describes the observed phenomenon of climate change, which is now a reality rather than just a conjecture. It provides evidence of this change, such as the disappearing Arctic ice and permafrost observed by the Inuit in Canada.

The hypothesis states that the greenhouse effect is the cause of the observed global climate changes.

Step 2: Analyze the logical relationship between the premise and the hypothesis.
The premise describes the observed climate change, but it does not explicitly state the cause of this change. The hypothesis, on the other hand, proposes that the greenhouse effect is the cause of the observed global climate changes.

Step 3: Evaluate if the premise entails the hypothesis.
For the premise to entail the hypothesis, the premise must logically imply
