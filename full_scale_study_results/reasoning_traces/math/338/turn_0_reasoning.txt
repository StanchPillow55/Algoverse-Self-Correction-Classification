==================================================

Let's denote the number of students in each of the two equal groups as x. The number of students in the smallest group is then x - 10. 

According to the problem, the total number of students is 200, so we can write the equation:

2x + (x - 10) = 200

Solving this equation will give us the number of students in each group.

First, simplify the left side of the equation:

3x - 10 = 200

Next, add 10 to both sides of the equation to isolate the term with x on one side:

3x = 210

Finally, divide both sides of the equation by 3 to solve for x:

x = 210 / 3 = 70

So, there are 70 students in each of the two equal groups. The smallest group has 10 less than this, which is 70 - 10 = 60 students.

Therefore, the smallest group has 60 students.
