Question ID: 338
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

Let's denote the number of students in the two equal groups as x and the number of students in the smallest group as y. 

From the problem, we know that:

1) The total number of students is 200, so x + x + y = 200.

2) The smallest group is 10 less than each of the other groups, so y = x - 10.

We can substitute y from the second equation into the first equation to solve for x:

2x + (x - 10) = 200
3x - 10 = 200
3x = 210
x = 70

Substitute x = 70 into the second equation to find y:

y = 70 - 10 = 60

So, the smallest group has 60 students.
