Question ID: 386
Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To find Wilson's current math grade, we need to calculate the average of his 5 test scores. 

The average is calculated by adding up all the values and then dividing by the number of values. 

So, we add up Wilson's test scores: 

65 + 94 + 81 + 86 + 74 = 400

Then, we divide this sum by the number of tests, which is 5: 

400 รท 5 = 80

So, Wilson's current math grade is 80.
