Question ID: 684
Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

John and Jack have 30 minutes to walk to school. They have already spent 6 minutes walking to the library and another 13 minutes walking to the fire station. 

To find out how much time they have left, we need to subtract the time they have already spent walking from the total time they have.

So, we add the time spent walking to the library and to the fire station:

6 minutes (to the library) + 13 minutes (to the fire station) = 19 minutes

Then, we subtract this total from the total time they have:

30 minutes (total time) - 19 minutes (time already spent) = 11 minutes

So, John and Jack have 11 more minutes to get to school without being late.
