==================================================

First, we need to calculate the total minimum payment for all of Jessica's debts. 

Her student loans have a minimum payment of $300/month, her credit card's minimum is $200/month, and her mortgage's minimum is $500/month. 

So, the total minimum payment per month is $300 + $200 + $500 = $1000.

Jessica wants to pay 50% more than the minimum. To calculate this, we need to find 50% of the total minimum payment and then add it to the total minimum payment.

50% of $1000 is (50/100) * $1000 = $500.

So, Jessica pays $1000 (total minimum payment) + $500 (50% more) = $1500 per month.

To find out how much she pays in a year, we need to multiply this monthly payment by 12 (since there are 12 months in a year).

So, Jessica pays $1500 * 12 = $18,000 in a year.

Therefore, Jessica pays $18,000 on her debts in a year.
