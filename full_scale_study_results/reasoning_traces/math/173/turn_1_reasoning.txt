Question ID: 173
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, let's calculate the total minimum payment Jessica has to make each month. 

Minimum monthly payment = Student loan minimum + Credit card minimum + Mortgage minimum
= $300 + $200 + $500
= $1000

Jessica wants to pay 50% more than this minimum. To calculate this, we multiply the total minimum payment by 1.5 (which represents 100% + 50%).

Increased monthly payment = Minimum monthly payment * 1.5
= $1000 * 1.5
= $1500

This is the amount Jessica pays each month. To find out how much she pays in a year, we multiply this monthly payment by 12 (since there are 12 months in a year).

Annual payment = Monthly payment * 12
= $1500 * 12
= $18,000

So, Jessica pays $18,000 in a year.
