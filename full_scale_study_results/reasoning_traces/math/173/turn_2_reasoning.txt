Question ID: 173
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to find out the total minimum payment Jessica needs to make each month. 

The total minimum payment per month is the sum of the minimum payments for the student loans, credit card, and mortgage. 

So, $300 (student loans) + $200 (credit card) + $500 (mortgage) = $1000 per month.

Next, Jessica wants to pay 50% more than the minimum. To find out how much this is, we need to calculate 50% of the total minimum payment and add it to the total minimum payment.

50% of $1000 is $1000 * 0.50 = $500.

So, Jessica wants to pay $1000 (total minimum payment) + $500 (50% more) = $1500 per month.

Finally, to find out how much Jessica pays in a year, we need to multiply the monthly payment by the number of months in a year, which is 12.

So, $1500 * 12 = $18,000.

Therefore, Jessica pays $18,000 in a year.
