Question ID: 93
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

Let's denote the time it takes for Gerald to run the 400-meter hurdles before his diet change as G. According to the problem, Lee used to be able to run the 400-meter hurdles two seconds faster than Gerald, so we can write this as:

L = G - 2

We know that Lee runs the 400-meter hurdles in 38 seconds, so we can substitute L with 38:

38 = G - 2

Solving this equation for G gives us:

G = 38 + 2 = 40 seconds

So, before changing his diet, Gerald used to run the 400-meter hurdles in 40 seconds.

The problem states that Gerald improved his speed by 10% after changing his diet. An increase in speed results in a decrease in time. Therefore, we need to find 10% of the time Gerald used to take and subtract it from his original time.

10% of 40 seconds is (10/100) * 40 = 4 seconds

So, Gerald's new time is 40 - 4 = 36 seconds

Therefore, with his improved diet, Gerald can now run the 400-meter hurdles in 36 seconds.
