==================================================

Let's denote the time it took Gerald to run the 400-meter hurdles before he changed his diet as G. According to the problem, Lee used to be able to run the 400-meter hurdles two seconds faster than Gerald, so we can write this as:

L = G - 2

We know that Lee runs the 400-meter hurdles in 38 seconds, so we can substitute L with 38:

38 = G - 2

Solving this equation for G gives us Gerald's original time:

G = 38 + 2 = 40 seconds

This is the time it took Gerald to run the 400-meter hurdles before he changed his diet. After changing his diet, Gerald's speed improved by 10%. Since speed is inversely proportional to time, a 10% increase in speed corresponds to a 10% decrease in time. Therefore, Gerald's new time is 90% of his original time:

New G = 0.90 * G = 0.90 * 40 = 36 seconds

So, with his improved diet, Gerald can run the 400-meter hurdles in 36 seconds.
