Question ID: 93
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

Let's denote the time Gerald used to run the 400-meter hurdles as G. According to the problem, Lee used to run the 400-meter hurdles two seconds faster than Gerald, so we can write this as:

L = G - 2

We know that Lee runs the 400-meter hurdles in 38 seconds, so we can substitute L with 38:

38 = G - 2

Solving for G, we find that Gerald used to run the 400-meter hurdles in 40 seconds:

G = 38 + 2 = 40 seconds

However, Gerald changed his diet and improved his speed by 10%. An increase in speed by 10% means a decrease in time by 10%. So, we can calculate Gerald's new time as follows:

New G = G - 10% of G
New G = 40 seconds - 10% of 40 seconds
New G = 40 seconds - 4 seconds
New G = 36 seconds

So, with his improved diet, Gerald can now run the 400-meter hurdles in 36 seconds.
