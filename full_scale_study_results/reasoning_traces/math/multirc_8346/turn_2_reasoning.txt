==================================================

To solve this problem, I need to analyze the given paragraph and identify the existentialist writer that Camus distanced himself from ideologically.

The key information from the paragraph is:
1. Camus was a French Nobel Prize winning author, journalist, and philosopher.
2. His views contributed to the rise of the philosophy known as absurdism.
3. Camus did not consider himself to be an existentialist, despite usually being classified as one.
4. In a 1945 interview, Camus rejected any ideological associations, saying "No, I am not an existentialist. Sartre and I are always surprised to see our names linked..."

From this, we can infer that the existentialist writer that Camus distanced himself from ideologically was Jean-Paul Sartre.

The paragraph explicitly states that Camus rejected being associated with Sartre, saying they were "always surprised to see our names linked." This indicates that Camus deliberately distanced himself from Sartre and the existentialist philosophy.

Therefore, the final answer is:
Sartre
