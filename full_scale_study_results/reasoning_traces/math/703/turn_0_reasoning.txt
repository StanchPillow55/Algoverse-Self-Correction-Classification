Question ID: 703
Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, let's calculate the total number of dumplings eaten by the females. Since each female ate 3 dumplings and there are 6 females, the total number of dumplings eaten by the females is 3 * 6 = 18 dumplings.

Next, we know that each male ate 1 more dumpling than each female. Since each female ate 3 dumplings, each male ate 3 + 1 = 4 dumplings.

Since there are 8 males and each male ate 4 dumplings, the total number of dumplings eaten by the males is 8 * 4 = 32 dumplings.

Finally, to find the total number of dumplings Larry cooked, we add the number of dumplings eaten by the females and the males. So, Larry cooked 18 + 32 = 50 dumplings.

Therefore, Larry cooked 50 dumplings.
