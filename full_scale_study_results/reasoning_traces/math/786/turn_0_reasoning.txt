Question ID: 786
Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to calculate how many tomatoes Ricardo can get from his tomato plants. Since each tomato plant yields 22 tomatoes, and he planted 5 tomato plants, we multiply 22 by 5 to find the total number of tomatoes.

22 tomatoes/plant * 5 plants = 110 tomatoes

Next, we calculate how many eggplants Ricardo can get from his eggplant plants. Since each eggplant plant yields 4 eggplants, and he planted 8 eggplant plants, we multiply 4 by 8 to find the total number of eggplants.

4 eggplants/plant * 8 plants = 32 eggplants

Finally, to find the total number of fruits Ricardo can get from his plants, we add the number of tomatoes to the number of eggplants.

110 tomatoes + 32 eggplants = 142 fruits

So, Ricardo can get 142 fruits from his plants.
