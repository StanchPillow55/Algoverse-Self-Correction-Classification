==================================================

To determine who was taken by surprise at the presence of their foe, I will carefully analyze the details provided in the paragraph.

The paragraph states:
"The latter, occupied by their attack upon the houses, were unconscious of the presence of their foe until he was close upon them, and were taken utterly by surprise."

This indicates that the "Roundheads" were the ones who were taken by surprise by the presence of their foe, which was Harry and his men.

The paragraph further explains:
"The force of the charge was irresistible, and the Roundheads, dispersed and on foot, were cut down in all directions."

This reinforces that the Roundheads were caught off guard and unprepared for Harry's charge, leading to their defeat.

Therefore, the final answer is:
The Roundheads were taken by surprise at the presence of their foe.
