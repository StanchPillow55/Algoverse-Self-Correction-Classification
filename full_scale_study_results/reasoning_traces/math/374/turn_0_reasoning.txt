Dataset Type: math
==================================================

Mary has 30 sheep in total. Half of them would be 30/2 = 15 sheep.

From the first half of the sheep, she gets 1 kg of milk each. So, from 15 sheep, she gets 15*1 = 15 kg of milk.

From the second half of the sheep, she gets 2 kg of milk each. So, from the other 15 sheep, she gets 15*2 = 30 kg of milk.

Therefore, the total amount of milk Mary collects every day from all her sheep is 15 kg + 30 kg = 45 kg.

So, Mary collects 45 kg of milk every day.
