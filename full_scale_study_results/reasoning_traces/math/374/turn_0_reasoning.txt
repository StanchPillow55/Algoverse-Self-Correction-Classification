To solve the problem, we need to determine how much milk Mary collects from her sheep each day.

1. **Identify the total number of sheep**: Mary has a total of 30 sheep.

2. **Divide the sheep into two groups**: The problem states that she gets 1 kg of milk from half of them and 2 kg of milk from the other half. Since there are 30 sheep, we can find half of them:
   \[
   \text{Half of 30 sheep} = \frac{30}{2} = 15 \text{ sheep}
   \]

3. **Calculate the milk from the first group**: The first group consists of 15 sheep, and Mary collects 1 kg of milk from each of these sheep. Therefore, the total milk collected from this group is:
   \[
   \text{Milk from first group} = 15 \text{ sheep} \times 1 \text{ kg/sheep} = 15 \text{ kg}
   \]

4. **Calculate the milk from the second group**: The second group also consists of 15 sheep, and Mary collects 2 kg of milk from each of these sheep. Therefore, the total milk collected from this group is:
   \[
   \text{Milk from second group} = 15 \text{ sheep} \times 2 \text{ kg/sheep} = 30 \text{ kg}
   \]

5. **Calculate the total milk collected**: To find the total amount of milk Mary collects each day, we add the milk collected from both groups:
   \[
   \text{Total milk} = \text{Milk from first group} + \text{Milk from second group} = 15 \text{ kg} + 30 \text{ kg} = 45 \text{ kg}
   \]

Thus, the total amount of milk Mary collects every day is:
\[
\boxed{45 \text{ kg}}
\]
