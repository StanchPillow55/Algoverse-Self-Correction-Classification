Question ID: 374
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Determine the number of sheep in each group:**
   - Mary has a total of 30 sheep.
   - She gets 1 kg of milk from half of them and 2 kg of milk from the other half.
   - Since the sheep are divided into two equal groups, each group contains half of the total number of sheep.

   \[
   \text{Number of sheep in each group} = \frac{30}{2} = 15
   \]

2. **Calculate the total milk from the first group:**
   - The first group of 15 sheep produces 1 kg of milk each.
   - Therefore, the total milk from this group is:

   \[
   15 \, \text{sheep} \times 1 \, \text{kg/sheep} = 15 \, \text{kg}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total milk from the second group:**
   - The second group of 15 sheep produces 2 kg of milk each.
   - Therefore, the total milk from this group is:

   \[
   15 \, \text{sheep} \times 2 \, \text{kg/sheep} = 30 \, \text{kg}
   \]

4. **Calculate the total milk collected every day:**
   - Add the milk from both groups to find the total milk collected every day:

   \[
   15 \, \text{kg} + 30 \, \text{kg} = 45 \, \text{kg}
   \]

Therefore, Mary collects a total of 45 kg of milk every day.

**Final Answer: 45 kg**
