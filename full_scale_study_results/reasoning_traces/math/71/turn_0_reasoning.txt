Dataset Type: math
==================================================

The first recipe has 20 instructions. 

The second recipe has twice as many instructions as the first one. This means the second recipe has 20 instructions * 2 = <<20*2=40>>40 instructions.

To find out how many instructions Kelian has to read to prepare the two dishes, we add the number of instructions in the first recipe to the number of instructions in the second recipe.

So, 20 instructions + 40 instructions = <<20+40=60>>60 instructions.

Therefore, Kelian has to read 60 instructions to prepare the two dishes.
