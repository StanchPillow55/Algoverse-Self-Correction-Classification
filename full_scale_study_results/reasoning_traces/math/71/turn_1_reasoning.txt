Question ID: 71
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

The first recipe has 20 instructions. 

The second recipe has twice as many instructions as the first one. So, it has 2 * 20 = 40 instructions.

To prepare both dishes, Kelian has to read the instructions for both recipes. Therefore, he has to read 20 (from the first recipe) + 40 (from the second recipe) = 60 instructions.

So, Kelian has to read 60 instructions to prepare the two dishes.
