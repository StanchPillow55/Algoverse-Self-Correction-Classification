==================================================

Finley started off in first place. 

When she fell back 5 spots, her position became 1 + 5 = 6th place.

Then, she moved ahead 2 spots, which means her position became 6 - 2 = 4th place.

After that, she fell behind 3 spots, which means her position became 4 + 3 = 7th place.

Lastly, she jumped ahead 1 spot, which means her final position was 7 - 1 = 6th place.

So, Finley finished the race in 6th place.
