==================================================

Tim's recipe calls for 1 cup of fresh lemon juice per gallon of lemonade. He found that 6 lemons yield 1 cup of juice. 

First, let's calculate how many lemons Tim needs for the 4 gallons of lemonade for the party. 

Since 1 gallon requires 1 cup of juice, and 1 cup of juice comes from 6 lemons, then for 4 gallons, Tim will need 4 * 6 = 24 lemons.

Now, let's calculate how many lemons Tim needs for the extra gallon for Allen. Allen wants his lemonade to be twice as tart, which means it will require twice as much lemon juice. 

Since 1 gallon normally requires 6 lemons, a gallon that is twice as tart will require 2 * 6 = 12 lemons.

Adding these together, Tim will need 24 lemons for the party lemonade and 12 lemons for Allen's lemonade. 

So, Tim will need a total of 24 + 12 = 36 lemons. 

Therefore, Tim will need 36 lemons.
