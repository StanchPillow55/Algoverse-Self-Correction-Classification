Question ID: 364
Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to find out how many fourth-grade boys there are in Small Tree School. We know that there are 96 fourth-graders in total and 43 of them are girls. So, we subtract the number of girls from the total number of fourth-graders to find the number of boys.

96 (total fourth-graders) - 43 (girls) = 53 (boys)

So, there are 53 fourth-grade boys in Small Tree School.

On Friday, 4 fourth-grade boys were absent. To find out how many boys were at school on Friday, we subtract the number of absent boys from the total number of boys.

53 (total boys) - 4 (absent boys) = 49 (boys at school on Friday)

So, there were 49 fourth-grade boys at Small Tree School on Friday.
