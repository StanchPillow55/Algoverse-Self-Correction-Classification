==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to find the name of the location that is mentioned in the passage as being adjacent to Berlusconi's property development.

Given information:
- Silvio Berlusconi paid underage exotic dancer Ruby-the-Heart-stealer five million Euros to commit perjury at his sex trial.
- Prosecutors believe Karima 'Ruby' el Mahrough was promised â‚¬5 million by Berlusconi to keep quiet during his trial.
- Some were also living rent-free in apartments on Berlusconi's vast property development adjacent to @placeholder, Milan 2.

The passage mentions that some were living rent-free in apartments on Berlusconi's property development adjacent to @placeholder, Milan 2. The placeholder needs to be filled in with the name of the location.

To find the name of the location, we need to carefully read the passage and look for any clues or context that might suggest the name.

After analyzing the passage, the only relevant information that could be the name of the location is "Milan 2". Therefore, the final answer is:

Final answer: Milan 2
