Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to find out how many raspberries are in the clusters. We do this by multiplying the number of clusters by the number of raspberries in each cluster. 

So, 6 clusters * 20 raspberries/cluster = 120 raspberries

Next, we add the number of individual raspberries to the number of raspberries in the clusters to find the total number of raspberries.

So, 120 raspberries + 67 raspberries = 187 raspberries

Therefore, there are a total of 187 raspberries on the bush.
