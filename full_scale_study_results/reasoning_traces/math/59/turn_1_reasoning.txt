Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we first need to calculate the total number of raspberries in the clusters. Since each cluster has 20 raspberries and there are 6 clusters, we multiply 20 by 6. 

20 raspberries/cluster * 6 clusters = 120 raspberries

Next, we add the 67 individual raspberries that are scattered across the bush.

120 raspberries + 67 raspberries = 187 raspberries

So, there are a total of 187 raspberries on the bush.
