Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine how many action figures Peter can buy with his $70 over the course of one week, given the different costs of wooden and plastic action figures.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Determine the Total Number of Days:**
   - A week consists of 7 days.

2. **Calculate the Daily Spending:**
   - Peter wants to spend an equal amount each day for one week.
   - Total money Peter has = $70.
   - Daily spending = Total money / Number of days = $70 / 7 = $10 per day.

3. **Calculate Spending from Sunday to Wednesday:**
   - From Sunday through Wednesday, Peter buys wooden action figures.
   - Number of days from Sunday to Wednesday = 4 days.
   - Daily spending on wooden action figures = $10.
   - Cost of one wooden action figure = $5.

   For each of these 4 days:
   \[
   \text{Number of wooden action figures per day} = \frac{\text{Daily spending}}{\text{Cost per wooden action figure}} = \frac{10}{5} = 2
   \]

   Total wooden action figures from Sunday to Wednesday:
   \[
   \text{Total wooden action figures} = 2 \times 4 = 8
   \]

4. **Calculate Spending from Thursday to Saturday:**
   - From Thursday to Saturday, Peter buys plastic action figures.
   - Number of days from Thursday to Saturday = 3 days.
   - Daily spending on plastic action figures = $10.
   - Cost of one plastic action figure = $2.

   For each of these 3 days:
   \[
   \text{Number of plastic action figures per day} = \frac{\text{Daily spending}}{\text{Cost per plastic action figure}} = \frac{10}{2} = 5
   \]

   Total plastic action figures from Thursday to Saturday:
   \[
   \text{Total plastic action figures} = 5 \times 3 = 15
   \]

5. **Calculate the Total Number of Action Figures:**
   - Total action figures = Total wooden action figures + Total plastic action figures
   \[
   \text{Total action figures} = 8 + 15 = 23
   \]

### Final Answer:
By the end of the week, Peter will have a total of 23 action figures.
