==================================================

Peter has $70 and wants to spend an equal amount each day for a week. A week has 7 days, so he will spend $70/7 = $10 each day.

From Sunday through Wednesday, he spent his money on wooden action figures which cost $5 each. So, each day he bought $10/$5 = 2 wooden action figures. Since he bought wooden action figures for 4 days (Sunday through Wednesday), he bought a total of 2*4 = <<2*4=8>>8 wooden action figures.

For the rest of the week (Thursday, Friday, and Saturday), he will buy plastic action figures which cost $2 each. So, each day he can buy $10/$2 = 5 plastic action figures. Since he bought plastic action figures for 3 days, he bought a total of 5*3 = <<5*3=15>>15 plastic action figures.

By the end of the week, Peter will have a total of 8 wooden action figures + 15 plastic action figures = <<8+15=23>>23 action figures. 

So, Peter will have 23 action figures by the end of the week.
