Question ID: 570
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine how many action figures Peter can buy with his $70 over the course of one week, given the different costs of the action figures on different days.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Determine the Total Number of Days:**
   - A week consists of 7 days.

2. **Calculate the Daily Spending Limit:**
   - Peter wants to spend an equal amount each day over the week.
   - Total money = $70
   - Number of days = 7
   - Daily spending limit = Total money / Number of days = $70 / 7 = $10 per day

3. **Calculate Spending from Sunday to Wednesday:**
   - From Sunday to Wednesday, Peter buys wooden action figures, which cost $5 each.
   - Number of days from Sunday to Wednesday = 4 days
   - Daily spending on wooden action figures = $10
   - Number of wooden action figures bought per day = Daily spending / Cost per wooden action figure = $10 / $5 = 2 wooden action figures per day
   - Total wooden action figures bought from Sunday to Wednesday = 2 action figures/day * 4 days = 8 wooden action figures

4. **Calculate Spending from Thursday to Saturday:**
   - From Thursday to Saturday, Peter buys plastic action figures, which cost $2 each.
   - Number of days from Thursday to Saturday = 3 days
   - Daily spending on plastic action figures = $10
   - Number of plastic action figures bought per day = Daily spending / Cost per plastic action figure = $10 / $2 = 5 plastic action figures per day
   - Total plastic action figures bought from Thursday to Saturday = 5 action figures/day * 3 days = 15 plastic action figures

5. **Calculate the Total Number of Action Figures:**
   - Total action figures = Total wooden action figures + Total plastic action figures
   - Total action figures = 8 wooden action figures + 15 plastic action figures = 23 action figures

### Final Answer:
Peter will have a total of 23 action figures by the end of the week.
