Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to calculate how many hot dogs John needs in total. Since each guest will eat 2 hot dogs and there are 20 guests, he needs 2*20 = 40 hot dogs.

John already has 4 hot dogs left over from a previous party, so he needs to buy 40 - 4 = 36 more hot dogs.

Each pack of hot dogs contains 6 hot dogs, so he needs to buy 36 / 6 = 6 packs of hot dogs.

Each pack of hot dogs costs $2, so he needs to spend 6 * $2 = $12 on hot dogs.

So, John needs to spend $12 on hot dogs for the party.
