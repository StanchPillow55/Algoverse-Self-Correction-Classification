==================================================

The problem can be solved using a simple proportion. 

First, we can set up the proportion as follows:

6 potatoes / 36 hash browns = 96 potatoes / x hash browns

This proportion says that the ratio of potatoes to hash browns is the same in both cases. 

To solve for x, we can cross-multiply:

6 potatoes * x hash browns = 96 potatoes * 36 hash browns

This simplifies to:

6x = 3456

Then, we divide both sides by 6 to solve for x:

x = 3456 / 6

x = 576

So, you can make 576 hash browns out of 96 potatoes.
