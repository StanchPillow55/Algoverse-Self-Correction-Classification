==================================================

To determine if the word "raise" is used with the same meaning in both sentences, we need to analyze the context and usage of the word in each sentence.

Sentence 1: "We raise hogs here."
In this sentence, the word "raise" is used to mean "to breed or grow" hogs. It refers to the act of caring for and nurturing the hogs.

Sentence 2: "Raise the question of promotions."
In this sentence, the word "raise" is used to mean "to bring up" or "to introduce" the topic of promotions. It does not refer to the physical act of growing or breeding something.

Therefore, the word "raise" is not used with the same meaning in both sentences. In the first sentence, it refers to the act of breeding or growing hogs, while in the second sentence, it refers to the act of introducing or bringing up a topic for discussion.

Final answer: No, the word "raise" is not used with the same meaning in both sentences.
