==================================================

To determine if the word "raise" is used with the same meaning in both sentences, we need to analyze the context and the meaning of the word in each sentence.

Sentence 1: "We raise hogs here."
In this sentence, the word "raise" is used to mean "to breed and care for" hogs. The meaning is related to the act of growing or producing hogs.

Sentence 2: "Raise the question of promotions."
In this sentence, the word "raise" is used to mean "to bring up" or "to introduce" the topic of promotions. The meaning is related to the act of discussing or considering a particular issue.

Based on the analysis, the word "raise" is not used with the same meaning in both sentences. In the first sentence, it refers to the act of breeding and caring for hogs, while in the second sentence, it refers to the act of introducing or discussing a topic.

Therefore, the answer is:
No, the word "raise" is not used with the same meaning in both sentences.
