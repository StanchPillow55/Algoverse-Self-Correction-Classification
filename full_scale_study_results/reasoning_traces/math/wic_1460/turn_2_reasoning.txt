Question ID: wic_1460
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To determine if the word 'raise' is used with the same meaning in both sentences, we need to analyze the context and the meaning of the word in each sentence.

Sentence 1: "We raise hogs here."
In this sentence, the word 'raise' is used to mean the act of breeding and caring for hogs, or livestock.

Sentence 2: "Raise the question of promotions."
In this sentence, the word 'raise' is used to mean to bring up or introduce a particular topic for discussion or consideration.

Therefore, the word 'raise' is not used with the same meaning in both sentences. In the first sentence, it refers to the act of breeding and caring for hogs, while in the second sentence, it refers to the act of bringing up or introducing a topic for discussion.

Final answer: No, the word 'raise' is not used with the same meaning in both sentences.
