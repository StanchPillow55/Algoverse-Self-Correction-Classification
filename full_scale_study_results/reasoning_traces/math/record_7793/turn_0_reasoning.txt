==================================================

Unfortunately, there is no mathematical problem or calculation to solve in the given passage. The passage is a news article about the tragic death of a teaching assistant named Helen Hipkiss. It does not contain any numerical information or a specific question that can be answered mathematically.

The query "So we went up and said our goodbyes" also does not seem to be related to the passage. It appears to be a separate statement not connected to the information provided.

Without a clear mathematical problem or question to solve, I cannot provide a step-by-step solution or a final answer. The passage is informative, but it does not contain any quantitative information that can be used to solve a math problem. Please let me know if you have a different question or problem that I can assist with.
