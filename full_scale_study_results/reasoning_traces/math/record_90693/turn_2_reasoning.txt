Question ID: record_90693
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, I will break it down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Carney repeated that Obama found the report deeply troubling.
- An anonymous official told CNN that Shinseki was on "thin ice" with the President.

Step 1: Identify the key information in the problem.
The key information is that Shinseki, the Secretary of Veterans Affairs, is potentially in danger of being dismissed or asked to resign by President Obama due to the troubling findings in the internal report on problems at VA hospitals.

Step 2: Analyze the situation and determine the appropriate mathematical approach.
Since this is not a typical math problem with numerical calculations, the appropriate approach is to use logical reasoning and inference to arrive at a conclusion.

Step 3: Apply logical reasoning to the problem.
Based on the given information, we can infer the following:
- The internal report on problems at VA hospitals contained findings that were deeply troubling to President Obama.
- These troubling findings have put Shinseki, the VA Secretary, in a precarious position with the President.
- The use of the phrase "on thin ice" suggests that Shinseki's job
