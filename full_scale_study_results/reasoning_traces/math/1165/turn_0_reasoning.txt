Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, let's calculate the total number of apartments in the first two complexes. Since each complex has 200 apartments, the total number of apartments in the first two complexes is 200 * 2 = 400 apartments.

The third complex is 60% bigger than the first two combined. To find out how many apartments are in the third complex, we calculate 60% of 400, which is 0.60 * 400 = 240 apartments.

So, the total number of apartments in the third complex is 400 + 240 = 640 apartments.

The total number of apartments in all three complexes is 400 (from the first two) + 640 (from the third) = 1040 apartments.

John collects garbage from each apartment 3 times a week. Therefore, the total number of collections he makes in a week is 1040 apartments * 3 collections/apartment = 3120 collections.

He gets paid $.40 for each collection. Therefore, the total amount of money he makes in a week is 3120 collections * $.40/collection = $1248.

So, John makes $1248 in a week.
