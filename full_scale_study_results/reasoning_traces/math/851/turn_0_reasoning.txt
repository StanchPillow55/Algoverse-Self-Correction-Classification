Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to figure out how many pairs of shoes James buys in a year. Since he buys 2 pairs of shoes a month, and there are 12 months in a year, we multiply 2 by 12 to get the total number of pairs of shoes he buys in a year.

2 pairs/month * 12 months/year = 24 pairs/year

Next, we need to figure out how much he spends on each pair of shoes on average. We know he spends $2640 on shoes each year. To find the average cost of each pair of shoes, we divide the total amount he spends by the total number of pairs of shoes he buys.

$2640/year รท 24 pairs/year = $110/pair

So, on average, James spends $110 on each pair of shoes.
