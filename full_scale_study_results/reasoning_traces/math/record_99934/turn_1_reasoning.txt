Question ID: record_99934
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, I will need to make some assumptions and inferences based on the information provided in the passage.

Given information:
- The passage is about a high school student named Chuck Shriner who "Tebowed" on stage during his graduation ceremony.
- The passage does not mention anything about a senior asking a placeholder to prom or taking a cardboard cutout of the Jets player instead.

Since the query mentions a "dateless senior" asking "@placeholder" to prom, and the passage does not contain any information about this, I will assume that the query is referring to a separate and unrelated event.

Without any additional information provided in the query, I do not have enough context to solve this problem. The query seems to be asking about a different situation that is not described in the passage.

Therefore, I do not have a complete answer to provide. I can only state that the information given in the query does not match the information provided in the passage, and I do not have enough context to solve the problem as stated.

Final answer: I do not have enough information to solve this problem.
