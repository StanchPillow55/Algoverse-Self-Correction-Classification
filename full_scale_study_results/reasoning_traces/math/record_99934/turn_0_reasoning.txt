==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to find the answer to the query based on the information provided in the passage.

Given information:
- The passage is about a high school student named Chuck Shriner who "Tebowed" on stage during his graduation ceremony.
- The query asks about a dateless senior who asked @placeholder (presumably Tim Tebow) to her prom, and when she didn't hear back from him, she decided to take a cardboard cut-out of the Jets player instead.

However, the passage does not mention anything about a dateless senior asking Tim Tebow to her prom or taking a cardboard cut-out of him instead. The passage is focused on the incident with Chuck Shriner at his high school graduation.

Therefore, the query is not related to the information provided in the passage, and there is not enough information to answer the query.

Final answer: There is not enough information provided in the passage to answer the query.
