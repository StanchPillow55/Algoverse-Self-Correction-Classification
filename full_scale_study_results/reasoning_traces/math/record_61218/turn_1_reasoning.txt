Question ID: record_61218
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to find out who the "placeholder" is in the given passage.

Given information:
- The passage mentions that one of the early morning starters in the final round carded a one-under-par 70 for five under 279, which was some way off the pace in the $2.71 million tournament.

Step 1: Identify the "placeholder" in the passage.
The passage does not explicitly mention the name of the player who carded a one-under-par 70 for five under 279. The "placeholder" is used to represent the name of this player.

Step 2: Determine the final answer.
Since the passage does not provide the name of the player, the final answer cannot be determined. The "placeholder" is a variable that needs to be replaced with the actual name of the player.

Therefore, the complete reasoning and work for this problem cannot be provided, as the necessary information is not available in the given passage.

Final answer: The final answer cannot be determined without the name of the player represented by the "placeholder" in the passage.
