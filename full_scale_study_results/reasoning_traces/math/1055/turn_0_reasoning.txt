Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to find out how much more James has to pay for insurance because of his accident. Since the increase is 60%, we calculate 60% of the normal cost, which is $120.

60% of $120 = 0.60 * $120 = $72

So, the cost of insurance after the accident is the normal cost plus the increase, which is $120 + $72 = $192 a month.

Since there are 12 months in a year, to find out how much James pays a year, we multiply the monthly cost by 12.

$192 * 12 = $2304

So, James pays $2304 a year for insurance.
