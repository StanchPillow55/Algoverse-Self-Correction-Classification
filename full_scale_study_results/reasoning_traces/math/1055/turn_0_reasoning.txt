To find out how much James pays for insurance per year after the increase due to his accident, we will follow these steps:

1. **Determine the normal cost of insurance per month.**
   The normal cost of insurance is given as $120.

2. **Calculate the increase in cost due to the accident.**
   The increase is stated to be 60% more than the normal cost. To find 60% of the normal cost, we can use the formula:
   \[
   \text{Increase} = \text{Normal Cost} \times \frac{60}{100}
   \]
   Substituting the normal cost:
   \[
   \text{Increase} = 120 \times 0.60 = 72
   \]

3. **Calculate the new cost of insurance per month.**
   The new cost is the normal cost plus the increase:
   \[
   \text{New Cost} = \text{Normal Cost} + \text{Increase}
   \]
   Substituting the values:
   \[
   \text{New Cost} = 120 + 72 = 192
   \]

4. **Calculate the total cost per year.**
   To find the annual cost, we multiply the monthly cost by the number of months in a year (12):
   \[
   \text{Annual Cost} = \text{New Cost} \times 12
   \]
   Substituting the new cost:
   \[
   \text{Annual Cost} = 192 \times 12
   \]

   Now, we perform the multiplication:
   \[
   192 \times 12 = 2304
   \]

Thus, the total amount James pays for insurance per year is \(\$2304\).

**Final Answer:**
James pays $2304 a year for insurance.
