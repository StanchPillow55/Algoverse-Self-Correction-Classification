==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine how much James pays for his insurance annually, given that his monthly cost is 60% more than the normal cost due to an accident.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Determine the Normal Monthly Cost:**
   - The normal cost of insurance per month is given as $120.

2. **Calculate the Increased Monthly Cost:**
   - Since James's insurance is 60% more than the normal cost, we need to calculate 60% of $120 and then add that to the normal cost.
   - First, calculate 60% of $120:
     \[
     60\% \text{ of } 120 = \frac{60}{100} \times 120 = 0.6 \times 120 = 72
     \]
   - Add this increase to the normal monthly cost:
     \[
     \text{Increased Monthly Cost} = 120 + 72 = 192
     \]

3. **Calculate the Annual Cost:**
   - Since the increased monthly cost is $192, we need to find out how much James pays in a year (12 months).
   - Multiply the increased monthly cost by 12 to get the annual cost:
     \[
     \text{Annual Cost} = 192 \times 12
     \]

4. **Perform the Multiplication:**
   - Calculate \(192 \times 12\):
     \[
     192 \times 12 = 192 \times (10 + 2) = 192 \times 10 + 192 \times 2
     \]
     \[
     192 \times 10 = 1920
     \]
     \[
     192 \times 2 = 384
     \]
     \[
     1920 + 384 = 2304
     \]

Therefore, James pays $2304 a year for his insurance.

### Final Answer:
James pays $2304 a year for his insurance.
