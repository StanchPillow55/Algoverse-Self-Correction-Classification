==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine how much James pays for his insurance per month after the 60% increase due to his accident, and then calculate his total annual payment.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Determine the Increase in Monthly Cost:**
   - The normal monthly cost of insurance is $120.
   - The increase due to the accident is 60% of the normal cost.
   - To find 60% of $120, we calculate:
     \[
     0.60 \times 120 = 72
     \]
   - Therefore, the increase in the monthly cost is $72.

2. **Calculate the New Monthly Cost:**
   - Add the increase to the normal monthly cost:
     \[
     120 + 72 = 192
     \]
   - So, James now pays $192 per month for his insurance.

3. **Calculate the Annual Cost:**
   - Since there are 12 months in a year, multiply the new monthly cost by 12 to find the annual cost:
     \[
     192 \times 12 = 2304
     \]

### Conclusion:

James pays $2,304 per year for his insurance after the 60% increase due to his accident.

**Final Answer:** $2,304 per year.
