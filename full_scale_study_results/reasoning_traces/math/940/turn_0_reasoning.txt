Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to multiply the number of children in a row by the number of rows and then multiply that by the number of schools.

First, we find the total number of children from one school. Since there are 8 children in a row and 7 rows, we multiply 8 by 7. 

8 children/row * 7 rows = 56 children/school

Next, we find the total number of children from all the schools. Since there are 5 schools and each school has 56 children, we multiply 56 by 5.

56 children/school * 5 schools = 280 children

So, there can be 280 children in the drill.
