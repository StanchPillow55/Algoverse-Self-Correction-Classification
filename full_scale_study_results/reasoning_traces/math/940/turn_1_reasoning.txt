Question ID: 940
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to multiply the number of children in a row by the number of rows and then multiply that by the number of schools.

Step 1: Calculate the number of children per school
The children stand 8 in a row and there are 7 rows. So, the number of children per school is 8 children/row * 7 rows = 56 children/school.

Step 2: Calculate the total number of children
There are 5 schools, so the total number of children is 56 children/school * 5 schools = 280 children.

Therefore, there can be 280 children in the drill.
