Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to find out how many red jelly beans there are. Since there are twice as many red jelly beans as green jelly beans, and there are 17 green jelly beans, we multiply 17 by 2 to find the number of red jelly beans.

17 * 2 = 34 red jelly beans

Next, we need to find out how many jelly beans are either green or red. We do this by adding the number of green jelly beans to the number of red jelly beans.

17 green jelly beans + 34 red jelly beans = 51 green and red jelly beans

Finally, we need to find out how many blue jelly beans there are. We do this by subtracting the number of green and red jelly beans from the total number of jelly beans.

60 total jelly beans - 51 green and red jelly beans = 9 blue jelly beans

So, there are 9 blue jelly beans in the jar.
