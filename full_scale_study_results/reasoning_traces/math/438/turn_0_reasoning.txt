==================================================

First, we need to calculate the total cost of the onions and the beef stock. 

Antoine likes to double the amount of onions in his recipe, so instead of 2 pounds, he uses 4 pounds. At $2.00 a pound, the total cost for the onions is 4 pounds * $2.00/pound = $8.00.

He also needs 2 boxes of beef stock, which are $2.00 a box. So, the total cost for the beef stock is 2 boxes * $2.00/box = $4.00.

Adding these two amounts together, the total cost of the ingredients is $8.00 (onions) + $4.00 (beef stock) = $12.00.

The recipe serves 6 people, so to find the cost per serving, we divide the total cost by the number of servings: $12.00 / 6 servings = $2.00/serving.

However, the problem asks us to round to the nearest integer. Since $2.00 is already an integer, we don't need to round.

So, the cost per serving is $2.00.
