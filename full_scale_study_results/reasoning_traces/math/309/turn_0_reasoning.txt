Question ID: 309
Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

Let's break down the problem:

1. The serum will make the drinker grow an extra arm every three days. So, in 15 days, the number of new arms grown will be 15 divided by 3, which equals 5.

2. The serum will also make the drinker grow an extra leg every five days. So, in 15 days, the number of new legs grown will be 15 divided by 5, which equals 3.

3. To find the total number of new limbs grown, we add the number of new arms to the number of new legs. So, 5 (new arms) + 3 (new legs) equals 8.

Therefore, Helenaâ€™s serum will cause a person to grow 8 new limbs if they drink it for 15 days.
