Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

* The Lots-of-Limbs Serum causes the drinker to grow an extra arm every 3 days
* The serum also causes the drinker to grow an extra leg every 5 days
* We need to find out how many new limbs will be grown after 15 days

First, let's look at the arms:

* After 6 days, the drinker will have grown 2 extra arms 
* After 9 days, the drinker will have grown 3 extra arms
* After 12 days, the drinker will have grown 4 extra arms
* After 15 days, the drinker will have grown 5 extra arms

Now let's look at the legs:
* After 5 days, the drinker will have grown 1 extra leg
* After 10 days, the drinker will have grown 2 extra legs
* After 15 days, the drinker
