Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine how many times the serum will cause a new arm to grow and how many times it will cause a new leg to grow over the course of fifteen days.

First, let's consider the arms. The serum causes a new arm to grow every three days. To find out how many times this will happen over fifteen days, we divide 15 by 3. 

15 รท 3 = 5

So, the serum will cause a new arm to grow five times over the course of fifteen days.

Next, let's consider the legs. The serum causes a new leg to grow every five days. To find out how many times this will happen over fifteen days, we divide 15 by 5.

15 รท 5 = 3

So, the serum will cause a new leg to grow three times over the course of fifteen days.

To find the total number of new limbs that the serum will cause to grow, we add the number of new arms to the number of new legs.

5 (new arms) + 3 (new legs) = 8

So, if a person drinks Helena's Lots-of-Limbs Serum, they will grow eight new limbs over the course of fifteen days.
