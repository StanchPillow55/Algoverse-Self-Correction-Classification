==================================================

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. James initially has 4 toys for 4 dogs. 

2. There are 8 more dogs in the shelter now. So, he needs 8 more toys. 

3. After buying the toys, he went back to see that there are twice as many more dogs than when he left. When he left, there were 4 (initial dogs) + 8 (new dogs) = 12 dogs. Twice as many more dogs means 2 * 12 = 24 more dogs. So, he needs 24 more toys.

4. When James came back yet again, 3 dogs were gone so he no longer needed those toys. So, he needs 3 less toys.

Now, let's add up all the toys he needs:

4 (initial toys) + 8 (for new dogs) + 24 (for twice as many more dogs) - 3 (for the dogs that left) = 33 toys.

So, James needs 33 toys in total.
