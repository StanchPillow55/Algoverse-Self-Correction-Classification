==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to carefully track the number of dogs and the corresponding number of toys needed at each stage. Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial Situation:**
   - James has 4 toys for 4 dogs. So, initially, he is perfectly equipped with toys for each dog.

2. **First Change:**
   - There are 8 more dogs in the shelter now. 
   - Total number of dogs = 4 (initial dogs) + 8 (new dogs) = 12 dogs.
   - James needs 12 toys for 12 dogs, but he currently has only 4 toys.
   - Toys needed = 12 (total dogs) - 4 (toys on hand) = 8 more toys.
   - James buys 8 more toys, so now he has 12 toys.

3. **Second Change:**
   - When James returns, there are twice as many more dogs than when he left.
   - Originally, there were 12 dogs. Twice as many more dogs means there are 12 additional dogs.
   - Total number of dogs now = 12 (previous total) + 12 (new dogs) = 24 dogs.
   - James needs 24 toys for 24 dogs, but he currently has 12 toys.
   - Toys needed = 24 (total dogs) - 12 (toys on hand) = 12 more toys.
   - James buys 12 more toys, so now he has 24 toys.

4. **Third Change:**
   - When James comes back again, 3 dogs are gone.
   - Total number of dogs now = 24 (previous total) - 3 (dogs gone) = 21 dogs.
   - James needs 21 toys for 21 dogs, but he currently has 24 toys.
   - Since 3 dogs are gone, he no longer needs those 3 toys.
   - Toys needed = 21 (total dogs), and he already has 24 toys, so he has 3 extra toys.

**Final Calculation:**
- Initially, James had 4 toys.
- After the first change, he bought 8 more toys, bringing the total to 12 toys.
- After the second change, he bought 12 more toys, bringing the total to 24 toys.
- After the third change, he has 3 extra toys because 3 dogs are gone.

**Final Answer:**
James needs a total of 21 toys for the 21 dogs currently in the shelter.
