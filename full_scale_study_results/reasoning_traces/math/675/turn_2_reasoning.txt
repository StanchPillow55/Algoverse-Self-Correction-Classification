Question ID: 675
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to carefully track the number of dogs and the corresponding number of toys needed at each stage. Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial Situation:**
   - James has 4 toys for 4 dogs. 
   - There are 8 more dogs now, so the total number of dogs is \(4 + 8 = 12\).

2. **First Purchase:**
   - James needs a toy for each of the 12 dogs.
   - He already has 4 toys, so he needs to buy \(12 - 4 = 8\) more toys.

3. **Second Situation:**
   - After buying the 8 toys, James returns to find there are twice as many dogs as when he left.
   - When he left, there were 12 dogs. Now, there are \(2 \times 12 = 24\) dogs.

4. **Second Purchase:**
   - James needs a toy for each of the 24 dogs.
   - He already has 12 toys (4 initial + 8 purchased), so he needs to buy \(24 - 12 = 12\) more toys.

5. **Third Situation:**
   - After buying the 12 toys, James returns to find that 3 dogs are gone.
   - The number of dogs is now \(24 - 3 = 21\).

6. **Final Adjustment:**
   - James needs a toy for each of the 21 dogs.
   - He already has 24 toys (12 initial + 12 purchased), so he does not need to buy any more toys. In fact, he has more toys than needed.

7. **Final Calculation:**
   - James has 24 toys and needs 21 toys, so he has \(24 - 21 = 3\) extra toys.

**Final Answer:**
James needs a total of 21 toys for the dogs.
