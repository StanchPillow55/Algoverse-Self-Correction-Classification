Question ID: 290
Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to find out how many medals Izzy has. Since Izzy has 5 less medals than Ali, and Ali has 22 medals, we subtract 5 from 22 to find out how many medals Izzy has.

22 - 5 = 17 medals

So, Izzy has 17 medals.

Next, we need to find out how many medals Ali and Izzy have together. To do this, we add the number of medals Ali has to the number of medals Izzy has.

22 + 17 = 39 medals

So, Ali and Izzy together have 39 medals.

According to the problem, the total number of medals given out for counting is 10 times the number of medals that Ali and Izzy have together. To find this number, we multiply the number of medals Ali and Izzy have together by 10.

39 * 10 = 390 medals

So, 390 medals have been given out for counting.
