==================================================

To answer this question, I will go through the paragraph step-by-step and analyze the relevant information.

The paragraph discusses the drug-financed guerrillas in Colombia, including the M-19 group, which is backed by Castro. It mentions that a former U.S. attorney, Robert Merkel, does not believe that Castro has broken off his relationship with the Medellin drug cartel, even though Castro has put some high-ranking officials on trial.

The paragraph then discusses the Colombian government's efforts to combat the drug lords. It mentions that the government has arrested two high-ranking drug traffickers, Jose Abello Silva and Leonidas Vargas, and has seized 1,000 pounds of dynamite. The paragraph also states that the Colombian president, Virgilio Barco, has refused to accept U.S. troops or advisers, but has accepted U.S. military aid.

Finally, the paragraph mentions that President Bush has agreed to meet with the presidents of Colombia, Peru, and Bolivia within 90 days to discuss the drug problem. The paragraph suggests that this meeting might be a good idea to happen sooner rather than later, "after the Panama fiasco,"
