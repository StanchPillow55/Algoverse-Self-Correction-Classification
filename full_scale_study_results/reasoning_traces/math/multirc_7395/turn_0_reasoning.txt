To answer this question, I will go through the paragraph step-by-step and provide the reasoning behind the final answer.

The key information in the paragraph is:
1. The drug-financed guerrillas in Colombia, including M-19, are trying to seize the country and destroy democracy.
2. Castro has clearly backed M-19.
3. Robert Merkel, a former U.S. attorney, believes that Castro has not broken off his relationship with the Medellin drug cartel.
4. The Colombian government has arrested two high-ranking drug traffickers, Jose Abello Silva and Leonidas Vargas.
5. President Barco has refused U.S. troops or advisers but has accepted U.S. military aid.
6. President Bush has agreed to meet with the presidents of Colombia, Peru, and Bolivia to discuss the drug problem.
7. The paragraph states that "Certainly, the Colombian press is much in need of that."

Based on the context, the "that" in the last sentence refers to the reassurance that the presidents will need after the "Panama fiasco". 

Therefore, the final answer is:
The Colombian press
