Question ID: 1085
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we first need to determine the rate at which the crocodile grows per year. 

Given that the crocodile grows 8 inches in 4 years, we can find the growth rate by dividing the total growth (8 inches) by the total time (4 years). 

So, the growth rate is 8 inches / 4 years = 2 inches/year.

Now that we know the crocodile grows at a rate of 2 inches per year, we can find out how much it will grow in 13 years by multiplying the growth rate by the time.

So, the crocodile will grow 2 inches/year * 13 years = 26 inches in 13 years.

Therefore, the crocodile will grow 26 inches in 13 years.
