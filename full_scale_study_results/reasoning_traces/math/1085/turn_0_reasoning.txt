Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

The problem tells us that a crocodile grows 8 inches in 4 years. This means that the rate of growth for the crocodile is 8 inches per 4 years.

To find out how much the crocodile grows in 1 year, we divide the total growth (8 inches) by the total time (4 years):

8 inches / 4 years = 2 inches/year

So, the crocodile grows at a rate of 2 inches per year.

Now, we want to find out how much the crocodile will grow in 13 years. To do this, we multiply the rate of growth per year (2 inches/year) by the total time (13 years):

2 inches/year * 13 years = 26 inches

So, the crocodile will grow 26 inches in 13 years.
