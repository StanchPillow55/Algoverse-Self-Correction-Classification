Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we first need to figure out how many 15-minute intervals are between 8:00 AM and 11:00 PM.

There are 60 minutes in an hour, so the total time Vince was stapling reports is 11:00 PM - 8:00 AM = 15 hours.

Each hour has 60/15 = 4 intervals of 15 minutes.

So, the total number of 15-minute intervals in 15 hours is 15 hours * 4 = 60 intervals.

Since Vince can staple 30 reports every 15 minutes, in 60 intervals, he would be able to staple 60 intervals * 30 reports = 1800 reports.

So, Vince stapled 1800 reports altogether.
