Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to determine how long Vince was stapling reports. He started at 8:00 AM and finished at 11:00 PM. 

There are 12 hours from 8:00 AM to 8:00 PM and an additional 3 hours from 8:00 PM to 11:00 PM. So, Vince was stapling reports for a total of 12 + 3 = 15 hours.

We know that Vince can staple 30 reports every 15 minutes. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so in one hour, Vince can staple 60/15 * 30 = 120 reports.

Therefore, in 15 hours, Vince can staple 15 * 120 = 1800 reports.

So, Vince stapled a total of 1800 reports from 8:00 AM until 11:00 PM.
