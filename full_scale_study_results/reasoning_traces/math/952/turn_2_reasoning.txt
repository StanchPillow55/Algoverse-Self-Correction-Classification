Question ID: 952
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to determine the total time Vince spent stapling reports. He started at 8:00 AM and finished at 11:00 PM. 

To calculate this, we need to convert the time to a 24-hour format. 8:00 AM is the same as 08:00 in 24-hour format, and 11:00 PM is the same as 23:00. 

So, the total time spent is 23:00 - 08:00 = 15 hours.

Next, we need to convert this time into minutes because the rate at which Vince staples reports is given in minutes. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 15 hours is 15 * 60 = 900 minutes.

Vince can staple 30 reports every 15 minutes. So, in one minute, he can staple 30 / 15 = 2 reports.

Therefore, in 900 minutes, Vince can staple 900 * 2 = 1800 reports.

So, Vince stapled 1800 reports altogether from 8:00 AM until 11:00 PM.
