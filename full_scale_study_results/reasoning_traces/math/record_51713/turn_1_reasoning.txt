Question ID: record_51713
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine the appropriate placeholder for the given query.

Given information:
- The query expresses a wish for a world where a child could wake up and search the internet to find themselves on "best-dressed lists".
- The passage mentions a 6-year-old girl, Kaia, who was interested in the appearance of 9-year-old Quvenzhan√© Wallis at the Oscars.

Based on the context, the appropriate placeholder for the given query would be "Kaia", as she is the young girl mentioned in the passage who was interested in the fashion and appearance of a child celebrity.

Therefore, the completed query would be:

"I wish we lived in a world where Kaia could wake up this morning and search the internet with her mama to find herself on our best-dressed lists."
