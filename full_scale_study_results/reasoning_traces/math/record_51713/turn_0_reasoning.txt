To solve this problem, we need to determine the appropriate placeholder for the given query.

Given information:
- The passage mentions Sabrina James and her 6-year-old daughter Kaia watching the Oscars.
- Kaia was excited to see 9-year-old Quvenzhané Wallis on the red carpet.
- The author laments the lack of cultural respect for children's innocence.

The query suggests that the author wishes the 6-year-old daughter, Kaia, could wake up and find herself on the best-dressed lists.

Therefore, the appropriate placeholder for the given query is "@placeholder", which should be replaced with "Kaia".
