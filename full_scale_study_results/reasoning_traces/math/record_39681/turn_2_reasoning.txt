Question ID: record_39681
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, I will break it down step-by-step:

1. The passage states that a Blackwater security contractor, Daniel Carroll, threatened to kill a State Department investigator, Jean C. Richter, who was investigating allegations against Blackwater.

2. The passage also states that Richter filed an official report after the incident, alleging that Carroll told him "he could kill me at that very moment and no one could or would do anything about it as we were in Iraq."

3. However, instead of Carroll being disciplined, Richter was the one ordered to stop his investigation and leave Iraq.

4. The query asks about Richter's allegations that Blackwater also over-billed the State Department and falsified records.

Therefore, the final answer is:

Richter alleges that Blackwater over-billed the State Department and falsified records.
