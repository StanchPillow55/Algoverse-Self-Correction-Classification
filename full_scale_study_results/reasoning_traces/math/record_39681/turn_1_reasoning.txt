Question ID: record_39681
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, I will break it down step-by-step:

1. The passage states that a Blackwater security contractor, Daniel Carroll, threatened to kill a State Department investigator, Jean C. Richter, who was looking into allegations against Blackwater.

2. The passage also states that instead of Carroll being disciplined, Richter was the one ordered to stop his investigation and leave Iraq.

3. The query asks about Blackwater over-billing the State Department and falsifying records, which the passage does not explicitly state. 

4. However, the passage does mention that Richter's report alleged "massive abuse in $1billion security contract for State Department employees in Iraq".

5. This suggests that the allegations in Richter's report likely included claims of Blackwater over-billing and falsifying records related to the $1 billion security contract.

Therefore, the final answer is:

The passage alleges that Blackwater over-billed the State Department and falsified records related to the $1 billion security contract for State Department employees in Iraq.
