==================================================

To solve this problem, I will break it down step-by-step:

1. The passage states that a Blackwater security contractor, Daniel Carroll, threatened to kill a State Department investigator, Jean C. Richter, who was looking into allegations of Blackwater's cost over-runs, boozy parties, mistreatment of migrant workers, and violence against civilians.

2. The passage also states that instead of Carroll being disciplined, Richter was the one sent home and ordered to stop his investigation and leave Iraq.

3. The query asks about Blackwater over-billing the State Department and falsifying records, which the passage alleges.

Therefore, the final answer is:

The passage alleges that Blackwater over-billed the State Department and falsified records.

The reasoning is that the passage discusses various allegations against Blackwater, including cost over-runs, which implies over-billing the State Department. Additionally, the passage states that Richter's report made "scathing" allegations against Blackwater's $1 billion security contract for State Department employees in Iraq, which suggests Blackwater may have falsified records related to that contract.
