Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to calculate how long Jack spends driving. To do this, we divide the total distance he drives (150 miles there and 150 miles back, so 300 miles total) by his speed (75 mph).

300 miles / 75 mph = 4 hours

Then, we add the time he spends at the museum (6 hours) to the time he spends driving (4 hours).

4 hours + 6 hours = 10 hours

So, Jack is gone from home for 10 hours.
