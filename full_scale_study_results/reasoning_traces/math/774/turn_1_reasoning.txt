Question ID: 774
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to calculate how long Jack spends driving. To do this, we need to know the total distance he travels and his speed. 

The total distance Jack travels is 150 miles to the museum and 150 miles back, which is 150 miles * 2 = 300 miles. 

Jack drives at a speed of 75 mph. 

To find out how long he spends driving, we divide the total distance by his speed. 

So, the time spent driving is 300 miles / 75 mph = 4 hours. 

We know that Jack spends 6 hours at the museum. 

To find out how long Jack is gone from home, we add the time he spends driving to the time he spends at the museum. 

So, the total time Jack is gone from home is 4 hours (driving) + 6 hours (at the museum) = 10 hours. 

Therefore, Jack is gone from home for 10 hours.
