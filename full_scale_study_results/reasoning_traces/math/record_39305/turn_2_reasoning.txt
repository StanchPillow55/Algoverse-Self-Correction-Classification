To solve this problem, I will need to extract the relevant information from the passage and then use it to determine the name of the town that ISIS launched an offensive to capture.

Given information:
- ISIS militants are locked in a fierce battle with Kurdish fighters for the northern Syrian town of Kobane.
- ISIS militants are reported to be a few kilometers away from the strategically important town.
- Explosions and smoke are seen as buildings are hit by mortar and shell fire.
- Turkey is massing troops, tanks, and armored vehicles on the border.

The passage states that ISIS launched an offensive to capture a town, and that this offensive began on September 15. Based on the details provided in the passage, the town that ISIS launched an offensive to capture is Kobane.

Therefore, the answer is:
