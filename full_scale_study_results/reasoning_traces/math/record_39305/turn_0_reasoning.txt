To solve this problem, we need to find the name of the town that Isis militants are trying to capture, as mentioned in the passage.

Given information:
- Isis militants are locked in a fierce battle with Kurdish fighters for the northern Syrian town of Kobane.
- Isis militants are reported to be a few kilometres away from the strategically important town.

Therefore, the town that Isis militants are trying to capture is Kobane.

The final answer is:
Isis launched an offensive to capture Kobane on September 15 and have advanced steadily despite U.S.-led air strikes.
