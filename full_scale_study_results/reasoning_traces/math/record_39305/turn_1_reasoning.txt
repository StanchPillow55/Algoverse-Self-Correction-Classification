==================================================

To solve this problem, I need to find the name of the town that ISIS militants are trying to capture, as mentioned in the passage.

The passage states that "Isis militants are locked in a fierce battle with Kurdish fighters for the northern Syrian town of Kobane". Therefore, the town that ISIS militants are trying to capture is Kobane.

The final answer is:
Kobane
