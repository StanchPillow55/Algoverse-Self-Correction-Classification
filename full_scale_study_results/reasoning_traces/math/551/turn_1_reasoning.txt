==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of the items Carly buys and then determine how much change she receives from a fifty-dollar bill.

**Step 1: Calculate the cost of the hamburgers.**

Carly orders five hamburgers, and each hamburger costs $4. 

\[
\text{Cost of hamburgers} = 5 \times 4 = 20 \text{ dollars}
\]

**Step 2: Calculate the cost of the potato fries.**

Carly orders ten packs of potato fries, and each pack costs $0.30.

\[
\text{Cost of potato fries} = 10 \times 0.30 = 3 \text{ dollars}
\]

**Step 3: Calculate the cost of the fruit drinks.**

Carly orders five cans of fruit drinks, and each can costs $2.

\[
\text{Cost of fruit drinks} = 5 \times 2 = 10 \text{ dollars}
\]

**Step 4: Calculate the total cost of all items.**

Add the costs of the hamburgers, potato fries, and fruit drinks together to find the total cost.

\[
\text{Total cost} = 20 + 3 + 10 = 33 \text{ dollars}
\]

**Step 5: Calculate the change Carly receives.**

Carly gives a fifty-dollar bill, so we subtract the total cost from $50 to find the change.

\[
\text{Change} = 50 - 33 = 17 \text{ dollars}
\]

Therefore, the change Carly gets back is \(\boxed{17}\) dollars.
