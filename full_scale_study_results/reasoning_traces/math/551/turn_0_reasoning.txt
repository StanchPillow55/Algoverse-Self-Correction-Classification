Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to calculate the total cost of each item Carly ordered.

For the hamburgers, she ordered 5 at $4 each. So, the total cost for the hamburgers is 5 * $4 = $20.

For the potato fries, she ordered 10 packs at $0.30 each. So, the total cost for the potato fries is 10 * $0.30 = $3.

For the fruit drinks, she ordered 5 cans at $2 each. So, the total cost for the fruit drinks is 5 * $2 = $10.

To find the total cost of Carly's order, we add up the cost of the hamburgers, potato fries, and fruit drinks. So, the total cost is $20 + $3 + $10 = $33.

Carly gives a fifty-dollar bill to pay for her order. To find out how much change she gets back, we subtract the total cost of her order from the amount she gave. So, the change she gets back is $50 - $33 = $17.

Therefore, Carly gets back $17 in change.
