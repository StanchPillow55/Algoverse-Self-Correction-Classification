Question ID: record_60942
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given information and make logical inferences to determine the missing team name in the query.

Given information:
- The passage discusses Everton's upcoming Europa League match against Lille.
- It mentions that Everton's young midfielder, Ross Barkley, is set to start the match after returning from injury.
- The query states that the team mentioned in the placeholder "@placeholder" has not had the brightest start to their domestic campaign, with 15 points from 10 matches.

Reasoning:
Based on the information provided in the passage, the team mentioned in the placeholder "@placeholder" is likely Lille, Everton's opponent in the Europa League match.

The passage states that Lille is the 2011 Ligue 1 champion, and the query mentions that the team has not had the brightest start to their domestic campaign, with 15 points from 10 matches. This aligns with the information about Lille, as they are a French team playing in the Ligue 1 (the top division of French football).

Therefore, the missing team name in the query is Lille.

Final answer:
