Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given information and make inferences to determine the missing placeholder value.

Given information:
- Everton take on Lille in Group H of the Europa League on Thursday.
- Ross Barkley is set to start after returning from injury against Aston Villa.

Therefore, the
