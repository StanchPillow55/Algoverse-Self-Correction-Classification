Question ID: record_75232
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, I need to determine the missing word in the given query.

Given information:
- The passage discusses the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) and the potential assassination of its leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi.
- The query states that "some said that if history favored them, they would unite with the @placeholder of Syria to form a single nation."

Based on the context provided in the passage, the missing word in the query is likely referring to a group or entity that could potentially unite with ISIS to form a single nation.

Possible options for the missing word:
1. People
2. Government
3. Kurds
4. Sunnis

Reasoning:
The passage mentions that some Sunnis may see ISIS as a resistance group, not terrorists. This suggests that the Sunnis could be the group that would potentially unite with ISIS to form a single nation.

Therefore, the final answer is:
The missing word in the query is "Sunnis".
