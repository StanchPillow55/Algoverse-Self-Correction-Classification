Question ID: 730
Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to find out how many pieces of gum Parker will chew in 30 days. 

We do this by multiplying the number of pieces he chews per day (4) by the number of days (30). 

4 pieces/day * 30 days = 120 pieces

Next, we need to find out how many packs of gum Parker will need. 

We do this by dividing the total number of pieces he will chew (120) by the number of pieces in each pack (15).

120 pieces / 15 pieces/pack = 8 packs

So, Parker will need 8 packs of gum to last him 30 days.
