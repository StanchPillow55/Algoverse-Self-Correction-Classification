==================================================

Let's start by calculating how many books each bookcase can hold.

We know that each of the middle 2 shelves can hold 10 books, so that's 2 * 10 = 20 books in total for the middle shelves.

The bottom shelf can hold twice as many books as a middle shelf, so it can hold 2 * 10 = 20 books.

The top shelf can hold 5 fewer books than the bottom shelf, so it can hold 20 - 5 = 15 books.

Adding up all the shelves, one bookcase can hold 20 (middle shelves) + 20 (bottom shelf) + 15 (top shelf) = 55 books.

Elly has 110 books, so she would need 110 / 55 = 2 bookcases to hold all of her books.

So, Elly needs 2 bookcases.
