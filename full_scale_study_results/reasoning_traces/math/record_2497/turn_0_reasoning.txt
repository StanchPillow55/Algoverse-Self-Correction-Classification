To solve this problem, we need to calculate the rate at which new animal species have been identified at the original Burgess Shale fossil site in Yoho National Park.

Given information:
- Over 100 years of research have been conducted at the Burgess Shale fossil site.
- Approximately 200 animal species have been identified at the site.
- The research has been conducted over 600 field days.

Step 1: Calculate the average number of new animal species identified per field day.
Number of animal species identified / Number of field days = Average number of new animal species per field day
200 animal species / 600 field days = 0.333 animal species per field day

Step 2: Calculate the average number of new animal species identified per year.
Average number of new animal species per field day × Number of field days per year = Average number of new animal species per year
0.333 animal species per field day × (600 field days / 100 years) = 2 animal species per year

Therefore, the rate at which new animal species have been identified at the original Burgess Shale fossil site in Y
