Question ID: record_2497
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the average number of animal species discovered per field day at the original Burgess Shale fossil site in Yoho National Park.

Given information:
- Over 100 years of research
- Approximately 200 animal species identified
- Over 600 field days

Step 1: Calculate the average number of animal species discovered per field day.
Average number of animal species discovered per field day = Total number of animal species / Total number of field days
Average number of animal species discovered per field day = 200 / 600
Average number of animal species discovered per field day = 1/3 or 0.33 species per field day

Therefore, the average number of animal species discovered per field day at the original Burgess Shale fossil site in Yoho National Park is 0.33 species per field day.
