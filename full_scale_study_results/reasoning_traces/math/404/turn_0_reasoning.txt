==================================================

To find the average number of stripes on the zebras, we need to first find the total number of stripes and then divide by the number of zebras.

First, let's find the total number of stripes. Jane counts two zebras with 17 stripes each, so that's 2 * 17 = 34 stripes. She also counts a zebra with 36 stripes and another zebra with half that many stripes, which is 36 / 2 = 18 stripes.

So, the total number of stripes is 34 (from the first two zebras) + 36 (from the third zebra) + 18 (from the fourth zebra) = 88 stripes.

There are 4 zebras in total (two with 17 stripes each, one with 36 stripes, and one with 18 stripes).

So, the average number of stripes per zebra is the total number of stripes divided by the number of zebras, which is 88 / 4 = 22 stripes.

Therefore, on average, the zebras have 22 stripes each.
