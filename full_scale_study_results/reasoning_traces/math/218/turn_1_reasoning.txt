Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine the current ages of Adrian, Harriet, and Zack, and then calculate their ages in three years. Finally, we'll find the average age of the three individuals in three years.

**Step 1: Determine Harriet's current age.**

We are given that Harriet is currently 21 years old.

\[ \text{Harriet's current age} = 21 \]

**Step 2: Determine Zack's current age.**

According to the problem, Harriet is half the age of Zack. Therefore, Zack's age is twice Harriet's age.

\[ \text{Zack's current age} = 2 \times \text{Harriet's current age} = 2 \times 21 = 42 \]

**Step 3: Determine Adrian's current age.**

The problem states that Adrian's age is three times the age of Harriet. Therefore, Adrian's age is:

\[ \text{Adrian's current age} = 3 \times \text{Harriet's current age} = 3 \times 21 = 63 \]

**Step 4: Calculate their ages in three years.**

To find their ages in three years, we add 3 to each of their current ages:

- Harriet's age in three years:
  \[ 21 + 3 = 24 \]

- Zack's age in three years:
  \[ 42 + 3 = 45 \]

- Adrian's age in three years:
  \[ 63 + 3 = 66 \]

**Step 5: Calculate the average age of the three in three years.**

To find the average age, we sum their ages in three years and divide by 3:

\[ \text{Sum of ages in three years} = 24 + 45 + 66 = 135 \]

\[ \text{Average age in three years} = \frac{135}{3} = 45 \]

**Final Answer:**

The average age of Adrian, Harriet, and Zack in three years will be 45 years.
