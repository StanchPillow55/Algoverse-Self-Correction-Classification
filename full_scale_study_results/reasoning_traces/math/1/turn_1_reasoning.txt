Question ID: 1
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

The robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber. 

It also takes half as much white fiber as blue fiber. Half of 2 bolts is 1 bolt (2/2 = 1).

So, to find the total number of bolts it takes, we add the number of blue bolts to the number of white bolts. 

2 bolts (blue) + 1 bolt (white) = 3 bolts

Therefore, it takes 3 bolts in total to make the robe.
