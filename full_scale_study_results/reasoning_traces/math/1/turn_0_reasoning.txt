==================================================

The robe takes 2 bolts of blue fiber. 

It also takes half as much white fiber as blue fiber. To find out how much white fiber it takes, we divide the amount of blue fiber by 2. 

2 bolts of blue fiber รท 2 = 1 bolt of white fiber

So, the robe takes 1 bolt of white fiber. 

To find the total amount of fiber the robe takes, we add the amount of blue fiber to the amount of white fiber. 

2 bolts of blue fiber + 1 bolt of white fiber = 3 bolts of fiber

So, the robe takes 3 bolts of fiber in total.
