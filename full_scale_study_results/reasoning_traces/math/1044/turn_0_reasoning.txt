==================================================

First, we need to convert all measurements to the same unit. Since the growth is given in inches, we'll convert Xavier's height to inches. 

There are 12 inches in a foot, so Xavier's height of 4 feet is equivalent to 4 * 12 = 48 inches.

Now, we add the growth to each of their original heights. Xavier grew 3 inches, so his new height is 48 + 3 = 51 inches. Cole grew 2 inches, so his new height is 50 + 2 = 52 inches.

Finally, we find the difference between their heights. The difference is found by subtracting the smaller height from the larger one. So, the difference is 52 - 51 = 1 inch.

Therefore, the difference between Cole and Xavierâ€™s height now is 1 inch.
