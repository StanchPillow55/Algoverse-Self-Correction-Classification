==================================================

I apologize, but I do not have enough information to solve a math problem based on the given passage. The passage describes an incident where a hospital radiographer allegedly allowed her 10-year-old son to operate an X-ray machine on a 15-year-old patient. However, there are no numerical values or mathematical information provided that would allow me to solve a math problem. Without specific data or a clear mathematical question, I cannot provide a step-by-step solution. If you have a math problem you would like me to solve, please provide the necessary information, and I will be happy to work through it and show my reasoning.
