Question ID: 911
Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to find out how many packages Colby completes per hour. The problem states that he completes 10 less than 50 packages per hour, so we subtract 10 from 50 to get 40 packages per hour.

Next, we need to find out how much money he earns per hour. Since he gets paid $0.20 for every package he completes, we multiply the number of packages he completes per hour (40) by the amount he gets paid per package ($0.20). 

40 packages/hour * $0.20/package = $8/hour

Now, we need to find out how much he earns in a typical eight-hour workday. We do this by multiplying the amount he earns per hour ($8) by the number of hours he works in a day (8).

$8/hour * 8 hours/day = $64/day

So, Colby earns $64 in a typical eight-hour workday.
