Question ID: 911
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine how many packages Colby completes in a typical eight-hour workday and then calculate his earnings based on the rate he is paid per package.

**Step 1: Determine the number of packages Colby completes per hour.**

According to the problem, Colby completes 10 less than 50 packages per hour. Therefore, the number of packages he completes per hour is:

\[ 50 - 10 = 40 \]

So, Colby completes 40 packages per hour.

**Step 2: Calculate the total number of packages Colby completes in an eight-hour workday.**

Since Colby works for 8 hours in a typical workday, we multiply the number of packages he completes per hour by the number of hours he works:

\[ 40 \text{ packages/hour} \times 8 \text{ hours} = 320 \text{ packages} \]

Colby completes 320 packages in an eight-hour workday.

**Step 3: Calculate Colby's earnings for the day.**

Colby is paid $0.20 for each package he completes. To find out how much he earns in a day, we multiply the total number of packages by the rate per package:

\[ 320 \text{ packages} \times \$0.20/\text{package} = \$64.00 \]

**Final Answer:**

Colby earns $64.00 in a typical eight-hour workday.
