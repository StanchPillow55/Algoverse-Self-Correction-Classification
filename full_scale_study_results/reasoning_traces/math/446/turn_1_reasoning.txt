==================================================

Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Rozanne has 4 dozen eggs in cases and 2 loose eggs in the cupboard.
- Each tray holds 5 glasses of eggnog.
- Each glass needs 5 eggs.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of eggs Rozanne has.
4 dozen eggs = 4 Ã— 12 = 48 eggs
2 loose eggs
Total eggs = 48 + 2 = 50 eggs

Step 2: Calculate the number of glasses of eggnog Rozanne can make.
Each glass needs 5 eggs
Number of glasses = Total eggs / Eggs per glass
Number of glasses = 50 / 5 = 10 glasses

Step 3: Calculate the number of trays Rozanne can put out.
Each tray holds 5 glasses
Number of trays = Number of glasses / Glasses per tray
Number of trays = 10 / 5 = 2 trays

Therefore, Rozanne can put out 2 trays of e
