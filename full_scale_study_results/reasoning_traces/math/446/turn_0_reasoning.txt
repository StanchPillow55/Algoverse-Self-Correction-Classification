==================================================

Rozanne uses 4 dozen eggs and 2 loose eggs. Since a dozen is equal to 12, she uses 4*12 = <<4*12=48>>48 eggs from the cases.
In total, Rozanne uses 48 + 2 = <<48+2=50>>50 eggs for the eggnog.

Each glass of eggnog needs 5 eggs, so with 50 eggs, Rozanne can make 50/5 = <<50/5=10>>10 glasses of eggnog.

Each tray holds 5 glasses of eggnog, so with 10 glasses, Rozanne can put out 10/5 = <<10/5=2>>2 trays of eggnog.

So, Rozanne can put out 2 trays of eggnog.
