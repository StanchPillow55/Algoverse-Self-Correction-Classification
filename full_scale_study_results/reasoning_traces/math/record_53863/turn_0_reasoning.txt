==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to find the name of the team that is in second place in the Bundesliga based on the information provided in the passage.

Given information:
- Bayern Munich climbed to third place in the Bundesliga with a 4-0 victory over Hoffenheim.
- Borussia Dortmund were held to a 1-1 draw by Kaiserslautern.
- Bayer Leverkusen defeated Eintracht Frankfurt 3-0 to go three-points clear in second place.

From the passage, we can infer that Bayer Leverkusen is the team that is in second place in the Bundesliga.

Therefore, the @placeholder in the query should be replaced with "Bayer Leverkusen".

The complete answer is:

Despite the setback, Dortmund still hold a 10-point lead over second-placed Bayer Leverkusen and are still well-placed to secure their first league championship since 2002.
