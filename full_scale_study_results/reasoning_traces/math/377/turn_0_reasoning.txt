Question ID: 377
Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to find out how many apples Lucy sold on Monday. Since each apple is sold for $4 and she made $56 on Monday, we divide the total money she made by the price of each apple. 

$56 รท $4 = 14 apples

So, Lucy picked and sold 14 apples on Monday.

On Tuesday, we know that she picked 12 apples.

On Wednesday, she picked double the number of apples she did on Tuesday. So, she picked 2 * 12 = 24 apples on Wednesday.

To find the total number of apples Lucy picked over the three days, we add the number of apples picked each day.

14 apples (Monday) + 12 apples (Tuesday) + 24 apples (Wednesday) = 50 apples

So, Lucy picked a total of 50 apples over the three days.
