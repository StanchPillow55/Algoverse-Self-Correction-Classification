Question ID: 393
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we first need to find out the total time Carol spent on all her tasks. 

First, we know that Carol spent 4 hours writing a song. 

Second, she spent half that time recording it. Half of 4 hours is 2 hours. 

Third, she spent 90 minutes editing it. We need to convert this time to hours to be consistent with the other times. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 90 minutes is 1.5 hours. 

Now, we add up all these times to find the total time Carol spent on all her tasks. 

4 hours (writing) + 2 hours (recording) + 1.5 hours (editing) = 7.5 hours 

Next, we need to find out what percentage of this total time Carol spent editing. 

To do this, we divide the time spent editing by the total time and then multiply by 100 to convert the decimal to a percentage. 

(1.5 hours / 7.5 hours) * 100 = 20%

So, Carol spent 20% of her total work time editing.
