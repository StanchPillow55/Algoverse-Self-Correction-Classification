Question ID: 393
Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, let's find out how much time Carol spent on each task in minutes, since the editing time is given in minutes.

Writing a song: 4 hours = 4 * 60 = 240 minutes
Recording: 4 hours / 2 = 2 hours = 2 * 60 = 120 minutes
Editing: 90 minutes

Now, let's find out the total time she spent on all tasks.

Total time = Writing time + Recording time + Editing time
Total time = 240 minutes + 120 minutes + 90 minutes = 450 minutes

Now, to find out what percentage of her total work time she spent editing, we divide the editing time by the total time and multiply by 100.

Percentage of time spent editing = (Editing time / Total time) * 100
Percentage of time spent editing = (90 minutes / 450 minutes) * 100 = 20%

So, Carol spent 20% of her total work time editing the song.
