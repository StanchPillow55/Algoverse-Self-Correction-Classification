Question ID: 393
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to convert all the time Carol spent into the same unit. In this case, we'll use minutes. 

Carol spent 4 hours writing a song. Since 1 hour is 60 minutes, she spent 4 * 60 = 240 minutes writing.

She spent half that time recording, so she spent 240 / 2 = 120 minutes recording.

She spent 90 minutes editing.

To find the total time she spent, we add up all these times: 240 minutes writing + 120 minutes recording + 90 minutes editing = 450 minutes.

To find the percentage of time she spent editing, we divide the time spent editing by the total time and multiply by 100 to convert to a percentage.

So, the percentage of time spent editing is (90 / 450) * 100 = 20%.

Therefore, Carol spent 20% of her total work time editing.
