Question ID: 753
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to convert the dozens into individual units. 

1 dozen is equal to 12 units. 

So, 8 dozens of glasses is equal to 8 * 12 = 96 glasses.
And, 4 dozens of plates is equal to 4 * 12 = 48 plates.

Jeff initially had 96 glasses and 48 plates.

10 glasses were broken and 6 plates were broken.

So, the number of glasses left is 96 - 10 = 86 glasses.
And, the number of plates left is 48 - 6 = 42 plates.

Therefore, Jeff now has 86 glasses and 42 plates.
