Question ID: 529
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we first need to find out how much Tom spent on the headphone set. We know that he spent a total of $48, and that the CD cost $4. So, we subtract the cost of the CD from the total amount he spent:

$48 (total amount spent) - $4 (cost of CD) = $44 (cost of headphone set)

Now, we want to find out how many more CDs Tom could have bought if he had decided not to buy the headphone set. To do this, we divide the cost of the headphone set by the cost of one CD:

$44 (cost of headphone set) รท $4 (cost of one CD) = 11 CDs

So, if Tom had decided not to buy the headphone set, he would have been able to buy 11 more CDs. 

Final answer: Tom could have bought 11 more CDs.
