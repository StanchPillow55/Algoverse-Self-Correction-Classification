Question ID: 529
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to find out how much the headphone set cost. We know that Tom's total spending was $48, and we know that he spent $4 on a CD. Therefore, the cost of the headphone set is $48 (total cost) - $4 (cost of the CD) = $44.

Next, we need to find out how many CDs Tom could have bought with the money he spent on the headphone set. Since each CD costs $4, we divide the cost of the headphone set by the cost of one CD to find out how many CDs Tom could have bought instead. 

So, $44 (cost of the headphone set) รท $4 (cost of one CD) = 11 CDs.

Therefore, if Tom had decided not to buy the headphone set, he would have been able to buy 11 more CDs.
