Question ID: 529
Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to find out how much the headphone set cost. We know that Tom spent a total of $48, and that $4 of this was spent on a CD. Therefore, the cost of the headphone set is $48 - $4 = $44.

Next, we need to find out how many CDs Tom could have bought with this money. Since each CD costs $4, we divide the cost of the headphone set by the cost of a CD to find out how many CDs Tom could have bought instead. 

So, $44 รท $4 = 11 CDs.

Therefore, if Tom had decided not to buy the headphone set, he would have been able to buy 11 more CDs.
