==================================================

The problem states that the alarm rings a certain number of times each time it goes off. 

First, it rang 4 times. 

Second, it rang for three times as long as the first time. So, we multiply the first time by 3: 4 times * 3 = 12 times.

Third, it rang for half as long as the second time. So, we take the second time and divide it by 2: 12 times / 2 = 6 times.

To find the total number of times the alarm rang, we add up all these times: 4 times + 12 times + 6 times = 22 times.

So, the alarm rang a total of 22 times.
