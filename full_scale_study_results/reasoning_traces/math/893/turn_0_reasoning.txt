Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, let's calculate how much Mark makes in a day with his new hourly wage. His new wage is $10 + $2 = $12 per hour.

So, in a day, Mark makes $12/hour * 8 hours/day = $96/day.

Since Mark works 5 days a week, his weekly earnings are $96/day * 5 days/week = $480/week.

Therefore, Mark makes $480 a week.
