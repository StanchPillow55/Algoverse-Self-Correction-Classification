Question ID: 1038
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, let's calculate the total amount of loans Jim took out for his college education. Since he borrowed $50,000 per year for 4 years, the total amount of loans is:

$50,000/year * 4 years = $200,000

Next, let's calculate the total amount of income Jim lost by not working while in school. Since he was making $25,000 per year before going to college and he was in school for 4 years, the total income lost is:

$25,000/year * 4 years = $100,000

So, the total cost of going to college, including both the loans and the lost income, is:

$200,000 (loans) + $100,000 (lost income) = $300,000

Now, let's calculate how much Jim is making per year after college. Since his degree tripled his income, he is now making:

$25,000/year * 3 = $75,000/year

Finally, let's calculate how long it would take for Jim to earn the equivalent of the total cost of going to college. To do this, we divide the total cost by his annual income:

$300,000 / $75,000/year = 4 years

So, it would take Jim 4 years to earn the money equivalent to the loans and the money lost from not working while in school.
