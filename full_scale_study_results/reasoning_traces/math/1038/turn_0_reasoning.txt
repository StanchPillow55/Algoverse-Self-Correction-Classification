Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, let's calculate the total amount of loans Jim took out for his college education. He took out $50,000 each year for 4 years, so the total amount of loans is:

50,000 * 4 = $200,000

Next, let's calculate the total amount of money Jim could have earned if he had continued working his $25,000 per year job instead of going to college. Over the course of 4 years, he would have earned:

25,000 * 4 = $100,000

So, the total cost of Jim's decision to go to college, including both the loans and the lost income, is:

200,000 + 100,000 = $300,000

Now, let's calculate how much Jim is earning per year after college. His degree tripled his income, so he is now earning:

25,000 * 3 = $75,000 per year

Finally, let's calculate how long it would take Jim to earn the equivalent of the total cost of his decision to go to college. We divide the total cost by his new annual income:

300,000 / 75,000 = 4 years

So, it would take Jim 4 years to earn the money equivalent to the loans and the money lost from not working while in school.
