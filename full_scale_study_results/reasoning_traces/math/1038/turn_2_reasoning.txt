Question ID: 1038
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, let's calculate the total amount of loans Jim took out for his college education. He borrowed $50,000 per year for 4 years, so the total amount of loans is:

$50,000/year * 4 years = $200,000

Next, let's calculate how much money Jim lost from not working while in school. He could have been making $25,000 per year for 4 years, so the total amount of money lost is:

$25,000/year * 4 years = $100,000

So, the total amount of money equivalent to the loans and the money lost from not working while in school is:

$200,000 (loans) + $100,000 (lost income) = $300,000

Now, let's calculate how much money Jim is making after college. His degree tripled his income, so he is now making:

$25,000/year * 3 = $75,000/year

Finally, let's calculate how long it would take for Jim to earn the money equivalent to the loans and the money lost from not working while in school. To do this, we divide the total amount of money equivalent to the loans and the money lost from not working while in school by Jim's new annual income:

$300,000 / $75,000/year = 4 years

So, it would take Jim 4 years to earn the money equivalent to the loans and the money lost from not working while in school.
