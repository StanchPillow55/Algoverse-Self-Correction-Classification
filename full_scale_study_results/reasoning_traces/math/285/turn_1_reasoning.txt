Question ID: 285
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to find out how old Ann's brother is currently. Since we know that he is twice Ann's age, we multiply Ann's age by 2.

Ann's age = 9 years
Brother's age = 2 * Ann's age = 2 * 9 = 18 years

Now, we need to find out how old Ann's brother will be in 3 years. To do this, we add 3 to his current age.

Brother's age in 3 years = Brother's current age + 3 = 18 + 3 = 21 years

So, Ann's brother will be 21 years old in 3 years.
