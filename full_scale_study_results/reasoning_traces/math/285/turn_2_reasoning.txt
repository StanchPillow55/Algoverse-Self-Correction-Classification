Question ID: 285
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we first need to determine the current age of Ann's brother. Since we know that Ann's brother is twice her age, we can calculate his age by multiplying Ann's age by 2. 

Ann's age = 9 years
Ann's brother's age = 2 * Ann's age = 2 * 9 = 18 years

Now, we need to find out how old Ann's brother will be in 3 years. We can do this by adding 3 years to his current age.

Ann's brother's age in 3 years = Ann's brother's current age + 3 = 18 + 3 = 21 years

So, Ann's brother will be 21 years old in 3 years.
