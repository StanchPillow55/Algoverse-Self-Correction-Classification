==================================================

The pink frog weighs 50 pounds. 

Since the pink frog weighs the same as the blue beetle and the green toad, this means that the blue beetle and the green toad also weigh 50 pounds each. 

So, the combined weight of the pink frog, the blue beetle, and the green toad is 50 pounds + 50 pounds + 50 pounds = 150 pounds.

The pink frog weighs 10 pounds less than the yellow snake. This means that the yellow snake weighs 50 pounds + 10 pounds = 60 pounds.

The pink frog weighs 20 pounds more than the red bird. This means that the red bird weighs 50 pounds - 20 pounds = 30 pounds.

So, the combined weight of all the animals is 150 pounds (for the pink frog, blue beetle, and green toad) + 60 pounds (for the yellow snake) + 30 pounds (for the red bird) = 240 pounds.

If the container also weighs 20 pounds, then the total weight of the container carrying one of each animal is 240 pounds (for the animals) + 20 pounds (for the container) = 260 pounds.

So, the total weight of the container carrying one of each animal is 260 pounds.
