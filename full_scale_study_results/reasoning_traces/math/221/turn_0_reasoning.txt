==================================================

Celine started with 120 liters of water in the tank.

After using 90 liters of water to water her garden, she was left with 120 liters - 90 liters = 30 liters of water in the tank.

Celine then collected rainwater that was twice as much as what was left in the tank. This means she collected 2 * 30 liters = 60 liters of rainwater.

Adding the rainwater to what was left in the tank, Celine now has 30 liters + 60 liters = 90 liters of water in the tank.

So, the water tank now has 90 liters of water.
