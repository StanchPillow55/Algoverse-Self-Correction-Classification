Question ID: 524
Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to determine how many rows of red and blue tulips Jackson can plant. 

For the red tulips, since he can fit 6 in a row and he has 36 red tulips, we divide the total number of red tulips by the number he can fit in a row:

36 red tulips รท 6 tulips/row = 6 rows of red tulips

For the blue tulips, since he can fit 8 in a row and he has 24 blue tulips, we divide the total number of blue tulips by the number he can fit in a row:

24 blue tulips รท 8 tulips/row = 3 rows of blue tulips

To find the total number of rows, we add the number of rows of red tulips to the number of rows of blue tulips:

6 rows of red tulips + 3 rows of blue tulips = 9 rows of tulips

So, Jackson will plant 9 rows of tulips.
