Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, I will break it down step-by-step:

Given information:
- The passage mentions that there is fierce fighting between rebels and Syrian troops on the outskirts of the capital city of Damascus.
- A spokesman named Baraa, from the local Revolutionary Military Council, states that "All of [the area] is a battle ground -- there is nowhere to hide."

To analyze this statement, I will need to consider the following:
1. The geographical area being referred to
2. The implication of "there is nowhere to hide"

Step 1: Determine the geographical area being referred to.
From the passage, we can infer that the area being referred to is the Damascus region, specifically the suburb of Jobar, which is on the outskirts of the capital city.

Step 2: Analyze the implication of "there is nowhere to hide."
By stating that "there is nowhere to hide," Baraa is suggesting that the entire area has become a active battleground, with no safe zones or places of refuge for civilians. This implies that the fighting is widespread and intense, leaving no areas untouched by the conflict.

Step 3:
