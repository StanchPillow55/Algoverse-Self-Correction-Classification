Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to extract the relevant information from the given paragraph and perform the necessary calculations.

Given information:
- The inhabited history of the Las Vegas Valley stretches to 23,000 b.c.
- Around 3000 b.c., native Archaic Indians began to develop a lasting hunting and gathering culture.

To find the approximate time when native Archaic Indians began to develop a lasting hunting and gathering culture, we need to convert the given dates from b.c. to a.d.

Step 1: Convert 23,000 b.c. to a.d.
23,000 b.c. = 23,000 years before the current era (a.d.)
Current era (a.d.) = 2023
23,000 b.c. = 23,000 + 2023 = 25,023 years ago

Step 2: Convert 3000 b.c. to a.d.
3000 b.c. = 3000 years before the current era (a.d.)
Current era (a.d.) = 2023
3000
