==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to extract the relevant information from the given paragraph and perform the necessary calculations.

Given information:
- The inhabited history of the Las Vegas Valley stretches to 23,000 b.c.
- Around 3000 b.c., native Archaic Indians began to develop a lasting hunting and gathering culture.

To find the approximate year when native Archaic Indians began to develop a lasting hunting and gathering culture, we need to convert the given dates from "b.c." (Before Christ) to a more standard year format.

Step 1: Convert 23,000 b.c. to a standard year.
23,000 b.c. = 23,000 years before the year 0 (the birth of Christ)
Therefore, 23,000 b.c. = 23,000 years ago from the present day.

Step 2: Convert 3000 b.c. to a standard year.
3000 b.c. = 3000 years before the year 0 (the birth of Christ)
Therefore, 3000 b.c. = 3000 years ago
