==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to find the approximate time when native Archaic Indians began to develop a lasting hunting and gathering culture in the Las Vegas Valley.

Given information:
- The inhabited history of the Las Vegas Valley stretches to 23,000 b.c.
- Around 3000 b.c., native Archaic Indians began to develop a lasting hunting and gathering culture.

Reasoning:
1. The passage states that the native Archaic Indians began to develop a lasting hunting and gathering culture "around 3000 b.c.".
2. This means that the native Archaic Indians started developing their culture approximately 3000 years before the present (b.c.).

Therefore, the approximate time when native Archaic Indians began to develop a lasting hunting and gathering culture is 3000 b.c.

Final answer: 3000 b.c.
