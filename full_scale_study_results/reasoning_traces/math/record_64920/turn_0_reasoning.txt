==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given information and provide a response to the query.

Given information:
- An explosion rocked Kabul, Afghanistan on Saturday.
- At least 9 people were killed and 14 others injured in the explosion.
- The explosion targeted the Afghan ministry of defense.
- The U.S. Defense Secretary, Chuck Hagel, was in Kabul at the time but was not injured.
- The explosion was carried out by a suicide bomber on a bicycle laden with explosives.
- The query suggests that the violence does not indicate that the Taliban can do what they want, whenever they want.

2. However, the fact that Hagel, the U.S. Defense Secretary, was present in Kabul at the time but was not harmed suggests that the Taliban's ability to carry out attacks at will is limited.
3. The query suggests that the violence does not mean the Taliban can do whatever they
