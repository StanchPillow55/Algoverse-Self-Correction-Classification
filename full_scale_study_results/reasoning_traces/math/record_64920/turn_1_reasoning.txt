==================================================

To solve this problem, I will break it down step-by-step:

1. Identify the key information given in the passage:
   - An explosion occurred in Kabul, Afghanistan
   - The explosion targeted the Afghan ministry of defense
   - At least 9 people were killed and 14 others injured
   - The suicide bomber approached the ministry on a bicycle laden with explosives
   - U.S. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel was in Kabul at the time but was unharmed and continued his briefing
   - The passage includes a quote from an ISAF (International Security Assistance Force) commander stating that the Taliban's capabilities are still limited

2. Analyze the quote from the ISAF commander:
   - The commander is suggesting that despite the attack, the Taliban's ability to conduct widespread violence is still limited.
   - This implies that the Taliban is not able to do "what they want to do when they want to do it" as the query suggests.
   - The commander's statement suggests that this attack, while tragic, does not indicate the Taliban has regained full control or the ability to operate freely.

3. Interpret the overall meaning:
