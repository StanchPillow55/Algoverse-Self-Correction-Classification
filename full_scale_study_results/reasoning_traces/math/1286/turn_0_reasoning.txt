==================================================

First, we need to know the value of each coin in cents. A quarter is worth 25 cents, a nickel is worth 5 cents, and a dime is worth 10 cents.

Next, we multiply the value of each coin by the number of that coin James has.

For the quarter, he has 1, so we multiply 25 (the value of a quarter) by 1:
25 * 1 = 25 cents

For the nickels, he has 2, so we multiply 5 (the value of a nickel) by 2:
5 * 2 = 10 cents

For the dimes, he has 7, so we multiply 10 (the value of a dime) by 7:
10 * 7 = 70 cents

Finally, we add up the value of all the coins:
25 cents (from the quarter) + 10 cents (from the nickels) + 70 cents (from the dimes) = 105 cents

So, James has 105 cents.
