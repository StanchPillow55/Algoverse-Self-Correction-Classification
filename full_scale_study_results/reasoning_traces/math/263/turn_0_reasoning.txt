==================================================

Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we know that Chris has 6 trees.

Second, Ferdinand has half the number of trees that Chris has. So, we calculate this by dividing Chris's number of trees by 2:

6 trees / 2 = 3 trees

So, Ferdinand has 3 trees.

Third, Harry has 5 more than twice the number of trees that Ferdinand has. We calculate this by multiplying Ferdinand's number of trees by 2 and then adding 5:

(3 trees * 2) + 5 trees = 6 trees + 5 trees = 11 trees

So, Harry has 11 trees.

Finally, we need to find out how many more trees are in Harry's yard than Ferdinand's yard. We calculate this by subtracting Ferdinand's number of trees from Harry's number of trees:

11 trees - 3 trees = 8 trees

So, Harry has 8 more trees in his yard than Ferdinand.
