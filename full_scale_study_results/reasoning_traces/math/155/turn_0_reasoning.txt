Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to find the total length of each type of baked good. 

For the rolls, we multiply the number of rolls by their length: 
300 rolls * 4 inches/roll = 1200 inches

For the croissants, we do the same: 
120 croissants * 6 inches/croissant = 720 inches

For the baguettes, we need to convert the length from feet to inches since the lengths of the other baked goods are given in inches. There are 12 inches in a foot, so each baguette is 2 feet * 12 inches/foot = 24 inches. Then we multiply the number of baguettes by their length: 
60 baguettes * 24 inches/baguette = 1440 inches

Next, we add up the total length of all the baked goods: 
1200 inches (rolls) + 720 inches (croissants) + 1440 inches (baguettes) = 3360 inches

Finally, we convert this length from inches to feet. There are 12 inches in a foot, so we divide the total length in inches by 12: 
3360 inches รท 12 inches/foot = 280 feet

So, if Bill puts all the baked goods end to end, they will be 280 feet long.
