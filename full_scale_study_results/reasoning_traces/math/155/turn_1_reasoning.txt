Question ID: 155
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total length of all the baked goods when placed end to end and express that length in feet.

### Step-by-Step Calculation:

1. **Convert all measurements to the same unit:**
   - Rolls and croissants are measured in inches, while baguettes are measured in feet. Since we want the final answer in feet, we'll convert everything to feet.

2. **Convert the length of rolls and croissants from inches to feet:**
   - There are 12 inches in a foot.

   - **Rolls:**
     - Each roll is 4 inches long.
     - To convert inches to feet: \( \frac{4 \text{ inches}}{12 \text{ inches/foot}} = \frac{1}{3} \text{ foot} \).

   - **Croissants:**
     - Each croissant is 6 inches long.
     - To convert inches to feet: \( \frac{6 \text{ inches}}{12 \text{ inches/foot}} = \frac{1}{2} \text{ foot} \).

3. **Calculate the total length for each type of baked good:**

   - **Rolls:**
     - Bill bakes 300 rolls each day.
     - Total length in feet for rolls: \( 300 \times \frac{1}{3} = 100 \text{ feet} \).

   - **Croissants:**
     - Bill bakes 120 croissants each day.
     - Total length in feet for croissants: \( 120 \times \frac{1}{2} = 60 \text{ feet} \).

   - **Baguettes:**
     - Each baguette is 2 feet long.
     - Bill bakes 60 baguettes each day.
     - Total length in feet for baguettes: \( 60 \times 2 = 120 \text{ feet} \).

4. **Add the total lengths together:**
   - Total length in feet = Length of rolls + Length of croissants + Length of baguettes
   - Total length in feet = \( 100 + 60 + 120 = 280 \text{ feet} \).

### Final Answer:
If Bill puts all the baked goods end to end, they will be 280 feet long.
