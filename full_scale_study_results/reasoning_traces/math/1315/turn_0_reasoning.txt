==================================================

First, let's determine how many oranges each person can peel in an hour.

Ana spends 3 minutes peeling an orange. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so we divide 60 by 3 to find out how many oranges Ana can peel in an hour. 

60 รท 3 = 20 oranges

Jane spends 4 minutes peeling an orange. We divide 60 by 4 to find out how many oranges Jane can peel in an hour.

60 รท 4 = 15 oranges

To find out how many more oranges Ana can peel than Jane in an hour, we subtract the number of oranges Jane can peel from the number of oranges Ana can peel.

20 - 15 = 5 oranges

So, Ana can peel 5 more oranges than Jane in an hour.
