==================================================

First, we need to calculate the total distance Elvis traveled in each direction. 

When he was driving west, he drove for 5 hours at a speed of 18 mph. The distance he traveled can be calculated by multiplying the time by the speed. 

So, the distance he traveled west is 5 hours * 18 mph = 90 miles.

Then, he turned around and drove east for 8 hours at the same speed of 18 mph. 

So, the distance he traveled east is 8 hours * 18 mph = 144 miles.

Now, to find out how far he is from his house, we need to subtract the distance he traveled west from the distance he traveled east, because he was essentially undoing part of his journey when he turned around.

So, the distance he is from his house is 144 miles - 90 miles = 54 miles.

Therefore, Elvis is 54 miles away from his house.
