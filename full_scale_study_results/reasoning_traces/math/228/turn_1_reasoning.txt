Question ID: 228
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine how long it will take Kalinda and her mom to complete a 360-piece puzzle, given their respective rates of placing puzzle pieces.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Determine Kalinda's Rate:**
   - Kalinda can place 4 pieces per minute.

2. **Determine Mom's Rate:**
   - Kalinda's mom can place half as many pieces per minute as Kalinda.
   - Therefore, Mom's rate is \( \frac{4}{2} = 2 \) pieces per minute.

3. **Calculate Their Combined Rate:**
   - Together, Kalinda and her mom can place pieces at a combined rate of:
   \[
   4 \text{ pieces/minute (Kalinda)} + 2 \text{ pieces/minute (Mom)} = 6 \text{ pieces/minute}
   \]

4. **Determine the Total Time Required:**
   - The total number of pieces in the puzzle is 360.
   - To find the time required to complete the puzzle, divide the total number of pieces by their combined rate:
   \[
   \text{Time (in minutes)} = \frac{360 \text{ pieces}}{6 \text{ pieces/minute}} = 60 \text{ minutes}
   \]

5. **Convert Minutes to Hours:**
   - Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, 60 minutes is equivalent to 1 hour.

### Final Answer:
Kalinda and her mom will take 1 hour to complete the 360-piece puzzle.
