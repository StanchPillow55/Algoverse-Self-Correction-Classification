Question ID: 228
Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

Kalinda can add 4 pieces per minute, and her mom can add half as many, which is 2 pieces per minute. Together, they can add 4 + 2 = 6 pieces per minute.

The puzzle has 360 pieces, so it will take them 360 pieces รท 6 pieces/minute = 60 minutes to complete the puzzle.

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, it will take them 60 minutes รท 60 = 1 hour to complete the puzzle.

So, the final answer is that it will take Kalinda and her mom 1 hour to complete the puzzle.
