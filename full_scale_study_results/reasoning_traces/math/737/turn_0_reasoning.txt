==================================================

First, we need to calculate how many ounces of water Peter used for each type of ice cube.

For the giant cubes, he made 3 cubes that each use 4 ounces of water. So, he used 3 * 4 = <<3*4=12>>12 ounces of water for the giant cubes.

For the medium cubes, he made 7 cubes that each use 2 ounces of water. So, he used 7 * 2 = <<7*2=14>>14 ounces of water for the medium cubes.

For the small cubes, he made 8 cubes that each use 1/2 an ounce of water. So, he used 8 * 1/2 = <<8*1/2=4>>4 ounces of water for the small cubes.

Now, we add up the total amount of water he used for all the cubes. This is 12 ounces for the giant cubes + 14 ounces for the medium cubes + 4 ounces for the small cubes = 12 + 14 + 4 = <<12+14+4=30>>30 ounces.

Peter started with 32 ounces of water. If he used 30 ounces to make the ice cubes, then he has 32 - 30 = <<32-30=2>>2 ounces of water left.

So, Peter has 2 ounces of water left.
