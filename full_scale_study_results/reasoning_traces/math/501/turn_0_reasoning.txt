Dataset Type: math
==================================================

Mariah used 1/4 of a skein of yarn, and there are 364 yards in a skein of yarn. So, to find out how many yards Mariah used, we need to multiply 1/4 by 364. 

1/4 * 364 = 91 yards

Mariah's grandma used 1/2 of a skein of yarn. So, to find out how many yards her grandma used, we need to multiply 1/2 by 364.

1/2 * 364 = 182 yards

To find out how many yards of yarn they used altogether, we need to add the yards Mariah used to the yards her grandma used.

91 yards + 182 yards = 273 yards

So, Mariah and her grandma used 273 yards of yarn altogether.
