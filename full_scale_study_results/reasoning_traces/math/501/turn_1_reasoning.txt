Question ID: 501
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to find out how many yards of yarn Mariah and her grandma used individually. 

Mariah used 1/4 of a skein of yarn. To find out how many yards this is, we multiply the total yards in a skein (364 yards) by 1/4:

364 yards * 1/4 = 91 yards

Mariah's grandma used 1/2 of a skein of yarn. To find out how many yards this is, we multiply the total yards in a skein (364 yards) by 1/2:

364 yards * 1/2 = 182 yards

To find out how many yards they used altogether, we add the yards Mariah used to the yards her grandma used:

91 yards + 182 yards = 273 yards

So, Mariah and her grandma used 273 yards of yarn altogether.
