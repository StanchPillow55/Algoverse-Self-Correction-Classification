==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine how many books Elise sold in each of the three years and then calculate the total earnings for the second year.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Identify the Total Number of Books:**
   - Elise started with a collection of 250 books.

2. **Determine the Number of Unsold Books:**
   - There are currently 50 unsold books.

3. **Calculate the Total Number of Books Sold:**
   - Total books sold = Total initial books - Unsold books
   - Total books sold = 250 - 50 = 200 books

4. **Determine the Number of Books Sold in the Current Year:**
   - Elise sold 45 books this year (the current year).

5. **Determine the Number of Books Sold in the First Year:**
   - She sold twice as many books in the first year as she has sold in the current year.
   - Books sold in the first year = 2 * Books sold in the current year
   - Books sold in the first year = 2 * 45 = 90 books

6. **Calculate the Number of Books Sold in the Second Year:**
   - Total books sold over the three years = Books sold in the first year + Books sold in the second year + Books sold in the current year
   - 200 = 90 + Books sold in the second year + 45
   - 200 = 135 + Books sold in the second year
   - Books sold in the second year = 200 - 135 = 65 books

7. **Calculate the Total Earnings for the Second Year:**
   - Each book sells for $20.
   - Earnings from the second year = Number of books sold in the second year * Price per book
   - Earnings from the second year = 65 * 20 = $1300

### Final Answer:
Elise earned $1300 in the second year.
