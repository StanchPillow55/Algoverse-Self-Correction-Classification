Dataset Type: math
==================================================

Let's start by figuring out how many books Elise has sold in total over the three years. We know that she started with 250 books and currently has 50 unsold books, so she has sold 250 - 50 = 200 books in total.

We also know that she sold 45 books this year. Given that she sold twice as many books in the first year as she has sold in the current year, she sold 2 * 45 = 90 books in the first year.

So, to find out how many books she sold in the second year, we subtract the number of books sold in the first and third years from the total number of books sold. This gives us 200 - 90 - 45 = 65 books sold in the second year.

Each book sells for $20, so to find out how much money Elise earned in the second year, we multiply the number of books sold in the second year by the price per book. This gives us 65 * $20 = $1300.

So, Elise earned $1300 in the second year.
