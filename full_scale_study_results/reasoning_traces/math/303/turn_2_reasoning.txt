Question ID: 303
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine how many books Elise sold in each of the three years and then calculate the total amount of money she earned in the second year.

### Step-by-step Solution:

1. **Identify the Total Number of Books Sold:**
   - Elise started with 250 books.
   - There are currently 50 unsold books.
   - Therefore, the total number of books sold over the three years is:
     \[
     250 - 50 = 200 \text{ books}
     \]

2. **Determine the Number of Books Sold Each Year:**
   - Let \( x \) be the number of books sold in the current year (third year).
   - According to the problem, \( x = 45 \).

3. **Books Sold in the First Year:**
   - The problem states that Elise sold twice as many books in the first year as she has sold in the current year.
   - Therefore, the number of books sold in the first year is:
     \[
     2x = 2 \times 45 = 90 \text{ books}
     \]

4. **Books Sold in the Second Year:**
   - We know the total number of books sold over the three years is 200.
   - Therefore, the number of books sold in the second year is:
     \[
     \text{Total books sold} - (\text{Books sold in the first year} + \text{Books sold in the third year})
     \]
     \[
     200 - (90 + 45) = 200 - 135 = 65 \text{ books}
     \]

5. **Calculate the Total Earnings in the Second Year:**
   - Each book sells for $20.
   - Therefore, the total amount of money earned in the second year is:
     \[
     65 \times 20 = 1300 \text{ dollars}
     \]

### Final Answer:
Elise earned a total of $1300 in the second year.
