Question ID: 512
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to find out the total distance Hannah will run. Since each lap is 0.25 km and she runs 8 laps, we multiply these two numbers together:

0.25 km/lap * 8 laps = 2 km

So, Hannah will run a total of 2 kilometers.

Next, we know that Hannah needs to drink 60 ml of water for each kilometer she runs. So, we multiply the total distance she runs by the amount of water she needs per kilometer:

60 ml/km * 2 km = 120 ml

Therefore, Hannah will need to drink 120 milliliters of water.
