Question ID: 512
Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to find out how many kilometers Hannah will run in total. Since each lap is 0.25 km and she needs to run 8 laps, we multiply 0.25 km by 8. 

0.25 km/lap * 8 laps = 2 km

So, Hannah will run a total of 2 kilometers.

Next, we need to find out how much water Hannah needs to drink for the 2 kilometers she will run. Since she needs to drink 60 ml of water for each kilometer, we multiply 60 ml by 2.

60 ml/km * 2 km = 120 ml

So, Hannah will need to drink 120 milliliters of water.

Therefore, the final answer is that Hannah will need to drink 120 milliliters of water.
