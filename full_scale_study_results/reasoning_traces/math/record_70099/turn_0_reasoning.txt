Question ID: record_70099
Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to find out who the "placeholder" is in the given query.

From the passage, we can see that the person who was able to descend into the crevice and rescue the trapped sheepdog, Chip, was Kes Taylor, the slightly-built vet.

The passage states:
"Slightly-built Kes Taylor, 35, was brought in to wriggle down the tiny gap to reach the collie dog, Chip, stuck 82ft underground."

Therefore, the "placeholder" in the query should be replaced with "Kes Taylor".

The complete answer is:

After the male rescuers failed to reach him, they asked Kes Taylor to descend into the crevice attached to ropes.
