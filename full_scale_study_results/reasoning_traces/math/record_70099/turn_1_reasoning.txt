Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to find the person who was asked to descend into the crevice after the male rescuers failed to reach the dog.

Given information:
- The passage mentions that Kes Taylor, a slightly-built vet, was brought in to wriggle down the tiny gap to reach the collie dog, Chip, who was stuck 82ft underground.
- The passage states that "Male rescuers got stuck when they tried to reach the dog."

Therefore, the person who was asked to descend into the crevice attached to ropes after the male rescuers failed to reach the dog was Kes Taylor, the slightly-built vet.

Final answer:
Kes Taylor was the person who was asked to descend into the crevice attached to ropes after the male rescuers failed to reach the dog.
