Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine how many beads each sister has and then compare the totals.

**Step 1: Determine the number of beads Elizabeth has.**

- Elizabeth bought 1 pack of red beads and 2 packs of clear beads.
- Each pack contains 20 beads.

Calculate the total number of beads Elizabeth has:
- Red beads: \(1 \text{ pack} \times 20 \text{ beads/pack} = 20 \text{ beads}\)
- Clear beads: \(2 \text{ packs} \times 20 \text{ beads/pack} = 40 \text{ beads}\)

Add the beads together:
\[20 \text{ (red beads)} + 40 \text{ (clear beads)} = 60 \text{ beads}\]

**Step 2: Determine the number of beads Margareth has.**

- Margareth bought 3 packs of blue beads and 4 packs of red beads.
- Each pack contains 20 beads.

Calculate the total number of beads Margareth has:
- Blue beads: \(3 \text{ packs} \times 20 \text{ beads/pack} = 60 \text{ beads}\)
- Red beads: \(4 \text{ packs} \times 20 \text{ beads/pack} = 80 \text{ beads}\)

Add the beads together:
\[60 \text{ (blue beads)} + 80 \text{ (red beads)} = 140 \text{ beads}\]

**Step 3: Compare the total number of beads each sister has.**

- Elizabeth has 60 beads.
- Margareth has 140 beads.

Calculate the difference:
\[140 \text{ (Margareth's beads)} - 60 \text{ (Elizabeth's beads)} = 80 \text{ beads}\]

**Conclusion:**

Margareth has 80 more beads than Elizabeth. 

**Final Answer:**
Margareth has 80 more beads than Elizabeth.
