==================================================

First, let's calculate how many beads each sister bought. 

Elizabeth bought 1 pack of red beads and 2 packs of clear beads. Since each pack contains 20 beads, she bought a total of 1*20 + 2*20 = 20 + 40 = 60 beads.

Margareth bought 3 packs of blue beads and 4 packs of red beads. So, she bought a total of 3*20 + 4*20 = 60 + 80 = 140 beads.

To find out how many more beads one sister has than the other, we subtract the smaller number from the larger one. 

So, Margareth has 140 - 60 = 80 more beads than Elizabeth.

Therefore, one sister has 80 more beads than the other.
