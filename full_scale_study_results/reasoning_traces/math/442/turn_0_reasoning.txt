==================================================

Let's break this problem down into two parts: the heating from the oven and the cooling from the window.

First, we'll calculate how much the temperature increases due to the oven. The oven is on for 3 hours, and each hour it raises the temperature by 5 degrees. So, the total increase in temperature from the oven is:

3 hours * 5 degrees/hour = 15 degrees

So, after the baking, the house's temperature is:

40 degrees + 15 degrees = 55 degrees

Next, we'll calculate how much the temperature decreases due to the window being open. The window is open for 30 minutes, and every 10 minutes it cools the house by 2 degrees. So, the total decrease in temperature from the window is:

30 minutes / 10 minutes * 2 degrees = 6 degrees

So, after the window is open, the house's temperature is:

55 degrees - 6 degrees = 49 degrees

Therefore, the house's final temperature is 49 degrees.
