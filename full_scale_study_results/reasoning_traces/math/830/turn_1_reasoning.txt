Question ID: 830
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, let's break down the time Britany spends on each activity per week:

1. Recording TikTok videos: Britany records 18 4-minute videos each week. To find out how many minutes she spends recording, we multiply the number of videos by the length of each video. 

    18 videos * 4 minutes/video = 72 minutes/week

2. Writing songs: Britany spends 2 hours a week writing songs. To convert this to minutes (so that all our time measurements are in the same unit), we multiply by the number of minutes in an hour.

    2 hours/week * 60 minutes/hour = 120 minutes/week

3. Doing makeup: Britany spends 15 minutes doing her makeup six days a week. To find out how many minutes she spends on makeup in a week, we multiply the time spent each day by the number of days.

    15 minutes/day * 6 days/week = 90 minutes/week

Now, let's add up all the time Britany spends on TikTok-related activities in a week:

    72 minutes/week (recording) + 120 minutes/week (writing songs) + 90 minutes/week (doing makeup) = 282 minutes/week

To find out how much time Britany spends on TikTok in a month, we multiply the weekly time by the number of weeks in a month. We're assuming a month has four weeks for this problem.

    282 minutes/week * 4 weeks/month = 1128 minutes/month

So, Britany spends 1128 minutes, or about 18.8 hours, on TikTok-related activities in a month with four weeks.
