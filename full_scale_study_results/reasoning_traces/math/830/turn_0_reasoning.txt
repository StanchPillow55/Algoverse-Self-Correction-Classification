Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, let's calculate how much time Britany spends on each activity per week.

1. Recording TikTok videos: 
   Britany records 18 4-minute TikTok videos each week. 
   So, she spends 18 videos * 4 minutes/video = 72 minutes per week on recording videos.

2. Writing songs: 
   Britany spends 2 hours a week writing songs. 
   Since 1 hour = 60 minutes, she spends 2 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 120 minutes per week on writing songs.

3. Doing makeup: 
   Britany spends 15 minutes six days a week doing her makeup. 
   So, she spends 15 minutes/day * 6 days/week = 90 minutes per week on doing makeup.

Now, let's add up all the time she spends on TikTok activities per week:
72 minutes/week (recording) + 120 minutes/week (writing) + 90 minutes/week (makeup) = 282 minutes per week.

Since there are 4 weeks in a month, Britany spends 282 minutes/week * 4 weeks/month = 1128 minutes per month on TikTok.

So, Britany spends 1128 minutes or approximately 18.8 hours per month on TikTok.
