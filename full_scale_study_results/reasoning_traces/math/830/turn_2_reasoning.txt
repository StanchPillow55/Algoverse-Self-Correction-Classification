Question ID: 830
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, let's break down the time Britany spends on each activity per week:

1. Recording TikTok videos: Britany records 18 4-minute videos each week. To find the total time spent on this, we multiply the number of videos by the length of each video. 

    18 videos * 4 minutes/video = 72 minutes/week

2. Writing songs: Britany spends 2 hours a week writing songs. We need to convert this time to minutes because our other times are in minutes. 

    2 hours/week * 60 minutes/hour = 120 minutes/week

3. Doing makeup: Britany spends 15 minutes six days a week doing her makeup. To find the total time spent on this, we multiply the time spent each day by the number of days.

    15 minutes/day * 6 days/week = 90 minutes/week

Now, let's add up all the time Britany spends on TikTok-related activities each week:

72 minutes/week (videos) + 120 minutes/week (songs) + 90 minutes/week (makeup) = 282 minutes/week

To find out how much time Britany spends on TikTok in a month, we multiply the weekly time by the number of weeks in a month. We'll assume a month has 4 weeks:

282 minutes/week * 4 weeks/month = 1128 minutes/month

So, Britany spends 1128 minutes, or approximately 18.8 hours, on TikTok-related activities each month.
