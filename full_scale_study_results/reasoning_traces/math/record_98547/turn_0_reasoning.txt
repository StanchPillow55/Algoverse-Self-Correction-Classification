To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given passage and determine the relationship between the growth of @placeholder and the changes in DC Comics' storytelling during the 1960s.

Given information:
- The passage discusses the significant changes that have occurred in the world of superhero comics in recent years, including the deaths and resurrections of various characters.
- The passage mentions that there have been "a reboot in 2011 for DC Comics" and "a relaunch of many of Marvel Comics' books in 2012."
- The query asks about @placeholder's growth in the 1960s and how it challenged DC Comics and inspired them to tell new kinds of stories.

However, the passage does not mention anything about @placeholder or its growth in the 1960s. The passage is focused on more recent changes in the comic book industry, rather than events from the 1960s.

Without any information about @placeholder's growth in the 1960s or its impact on DC Comics' storytelling, I do not have enough information to provide a complete and accurate answer to the query.

Final answer: I cannot provide a complete answer to the given query based on the information provided in the passage
