==================================================

I apologize, but there does not appear to be a specific math problem in the given passage. The passage discusses changes and events in the world of superhero comics, but does not contain any mathematical information or a math problem to solve.

Without a clear math problem statement, I cannot provide a step-by-step solution with calculations and reasoning. The passage is informative about the comic book industry, but does not present a quantitative problem for me to solve.

If you have a specific math problem you would like me to work through, please provide it, and I will be happy to show my complete reasoning and work to arrive at the final answer. Otherwise, I cannot generate a meaningful math problem solution from the given information.
