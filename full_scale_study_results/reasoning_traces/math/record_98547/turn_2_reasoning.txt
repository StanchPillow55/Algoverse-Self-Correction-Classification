==================================================

To solve this problem, I will need to analyze the given passage and determine if it provides any information about @placeholder's growth in the 1960s and how that challenged DC Comics and inspired them to tell new kinds of stories.

The passage does not mention anything about @placeholder or its growth in the 1960s. The passage is focused on discussing the changes and events that have occurred in the world of superhero comics over the past five years or so, including the deaths and resurrections of various characters, revelations about characters' sexualities, and major reboots and relaunches by DC and Marvel Comics.

There is no information in the passage that would allow me to determine if @placeholder's growth in the 1960s challenged DC and inspired them to tell new kinds of stories. The passage simply does not contain any relevant information to answer this query.

Therefore, based on the information provided in the passage, I do not have enough information to provide a complete answer to the given query. The passage does not contain the necessary details to address the specific question asked.

Final answer: Unable to answer the query based on the information provided in the passage.
