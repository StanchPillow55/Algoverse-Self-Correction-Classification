Question ID: 1160
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine how many tax reports the IRS received on Wednesday, given the total number of reports received throughout the week and the number of reports received on specific days.

Here's the step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Identify the Total Reports Received:**
   - The IRS received a total of 5168 tax reports last week.

2. **Identify Reports Received on Specific Days:**
   - On Monday and Tuesday, the IRS received a total of 1907 reports.
   - On Thursday and Friday, the IRS received a total of 2136 reports.

3. **Calculate the Reports Received on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday:**
   - Combine the reports received on Monday and Tuesday with those received on Thursday and Friday:
     \[
     1907 \text{ (Monday and Tuesday)} + 2136 \text{ (Thursday and Friday)} = 4043
     \]

4. **Determine the Reports Received on Wednesday:**
   - Subtract the total reports received on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday from the total reports received throughout the week to find the number of reports received on Wednesday:
     \[
     5168 \text{ (total reports)} - 4043 \text{ (Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, Friday)} = 1125
     \]

Thus, the IRS received **1125 reports on Wednesday**.

Final Answer: 1125 reports were received on Wednesday.
