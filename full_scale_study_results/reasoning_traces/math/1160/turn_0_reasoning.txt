Question ID: 1160
Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

The total number of reports received last week is 5168. The number of reports received on Monday and Tuesday is 1907 and on Thursday and Friday is 2136. 

To find out how many reports were received on Wednesday, we need to subtract the number of reports received on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday from the total number of reports received last week.

So, we add the number of reports received on Monday and Tuesday to the number of reports received on Thursday and Friday:

1907 (Monday and Tuesday) + 2136 (Thursday and Friday) = 4043

Then, we subtract this number from the total number of reports received last week:

5168 (total reports) - 4043 (reports on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday) = 1125

So, the IRS received 1125 reports on Wednesday.
