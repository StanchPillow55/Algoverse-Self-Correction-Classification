Okay, let's think through this step-by-step:

1) The passage states that Heath Ledger died while shooting Terry Gilliam's film "The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus". 

2) It also mentions that Gilliam enlisted the help of Ledger's friends, including Johnny Depp, to complete the film after Ledger's passing.

3) The query asks you to call your friend Johnny and say "Heath just died."

4) To fill in the [@placeholder], we need to determine the appropriate name to use when addressing Johnny Depp, Ledger's friend who helped Gilliam complete the film.

5) Based on the information provided in the passage, the most appropriate way to address Johnny Depp would be "Johnny Depp".

Therefore, the complete response would be:

"And, so, you call your friend Johnny Depp and say, 'Heath just died.'"
