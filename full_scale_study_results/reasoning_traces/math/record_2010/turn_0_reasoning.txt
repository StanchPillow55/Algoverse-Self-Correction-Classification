==================================================

To solve this problem, I will need to fill in the missing information in the query. The query states that the person is calling their friend Johnny and saying "Heath just died." Based on the passage, it seems that the person being referred to is the filmmaker Terry Gilliam, and the "Heath" who died is the actor Heath Ledger, who was starring in Gilliam's film "The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus" when he passed away.

Therefore, the complete query would be:

"And, so, you call your friend Johnny Depp and say, 'Heath Ledger just died.'"

To show the complete reasoning and work:

1. The passage states that Terry Gilliam was directing Heath Ledger in "The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus" when the actor died.
2. The passage also mentions that Gilliam had to enlist the help of Ledger's friends, including Johnny Depp, to complete the film after Ledger's passing.
3. Therefore, the logical conclusion is that Gilliam would call his friend Johnny Depp to inform him of Ledger's death.

Final answer:
