Question ID: 993
Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

Let's denote the number of flights the first plane makes as F. According to the problem, the second plane makes half the number of flights as the first plane, so we can write this as:

F = 2 * 44 = 88 flights

This means the first plane makes 88 flights in a day.

Out of these 88 flights, three-quarters go to Greece, so the remaining quarter is split between France and Germany. We can calculate this as:

Flights to Greece = 3/4 * 88 = 66 flights

So, the remaining flights to France and Germany are:

Flights to France and Germany = 88 - 66 = 22 flights

Since these flights are split equally between France and Germany, the number of flights to France is:

Flights to France = 22 / 2 = 11 flights

So, the first plane makes 11 flights to France in one day.
