==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to find the missing word or phrase that fits the context of the given passage.

Given information:
- The passage mentions that former Commons deputy speaker Nigel Evans was cleared of rape, five sexual assaults, one attempted sexual assault, and two indecent assaults.
- Evans said that he could not have survived his court ordeal without the help of Coronation Street stars William Roache and Vicky Entwistle.
- Evans also admitted that he considered suicide during the trial.
- The passage states that Evans said, "@placeholder just a few weeks ago from this very spot said there are no winners in these cases and that's absolutely right."

To find the missing word or phrase, we need to analyze the context of the statement and determine what would fit the meaning.

Reasoning:
The passage suggests that someone, likely a public figure or authority, had previously made a statement about there being "no winners" in cases like Evans'. This statement seems to resonate with Evans, who agrees that it is "absolutely right."

Given the context, the missing word or phrase that would fit the statement is likely the name of the person who made the previous statement.
