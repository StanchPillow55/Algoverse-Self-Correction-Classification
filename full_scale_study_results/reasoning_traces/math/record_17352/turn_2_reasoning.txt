==================================================

I apologize, but I do not see a specific math problem in the given passage. The passage discusses Nigel Evans, a former deputy speaker of the UK House of Commons, and his experience with a court ordeal related to sexual assault charges, and the support he received from Coronation Street stars during that time.

There does not appear to be any mathematical information or a math problem that I can solve. The passage is a news article discussing a personal experience, rather than a math-related question. Without a clear math problem to work through, I am unable to provide the type of step-by-step reasoning and calculations you requested. I'm happy to assist with math problems, but this particular passage does not contain one for me to solve. Please let me know if you have a different question that involves a specific math problem.
