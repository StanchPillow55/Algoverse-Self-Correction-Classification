Question ID: record_72305
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given information and perform the necessary calculations to determine the impact of the outcome of the El Clasico match on the league standings.

Given information:
- Barcelona is currently 4 points clear of Real Madrid in the league standings.
- There are 5 league games left to be played.

Let's consider two scenarios:

Scenario 1: Barcelona wins the El Clasico match.
If Barcelona wins the match, they will extend their lead over Real Madrid to 7 points (4 points + 3 points for the win).

Scenario 2: Real Madrid wins the El Clasico match.
If Real Madrid wins the match, they will reduce Barcelona's lead to 1 point (4 points - 3 points for the win).

To determine the impact of the outcome on the league title, we need to consider the remaining 5 league games.

Assuming both teams win all their remaining matches (except the El Clasico), the final league standings would be as follows:

Scenario 1: Barcelona wins the El Clasico
Barcelona: 4 + 3 + 15 =
