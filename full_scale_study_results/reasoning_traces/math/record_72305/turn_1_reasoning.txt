Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given information and perform the necessary calculations to determine the impact of the outcome of the El Clasico match on the league standings.

Given information:
- Barcelona is currently 4 points clear of Real Madrid in the league standings.
- There are 5 league games left to be played.

Let's consider two scenarios:

Scenario 1: Barcelona wins the El Clasico match.
