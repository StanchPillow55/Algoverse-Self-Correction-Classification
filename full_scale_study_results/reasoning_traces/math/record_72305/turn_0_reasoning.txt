==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given information and perform the necessary calculations to determine the impact of the outcome of the El Clasico match on the league standings.

Given information:
- Barcelona is currently 4 points clear of Real Madrid in the league standings.
- There are 5 league games left to be played.

We need to find out how the outcome of the El Clasico match will affect the league standings.

Case 1: Barcelona wins the El Clasico match
If Barcelona wins the match, they will extend their lead over Real Madrid to 7 points.

Barcelona's current points + 3 points (for the win) = Barcelona's new points
Barcelona's new points = 4 + 3 = 7 points ahead of Real Madrid

Case 2: Real Madrid wins the El Clasico match
If Real Madrid wins the match, they will reduce Barcelona's lead to 1 point.

Real Madrid's current points + 3 points (for the win) = Real Madrid's new points
Real Madrid's new points = Barcelona's current points - 1 = 4 - 1 = 3 points behind Barcelona
