Let's denote the number of red chickens as R and the number of white chickens as W. 

We know from the problem that Jerry collects 42 eggs every day. The red chickens produce 3 eggs each day and the white chickens produce 5 eggs each day. Therefore, we can write the following equation to represent the total number of eggs Jerry collects:

3R + 5W = 42

We also know from the problem that Jerry has two more white chickens than red chickens. Therefore, we can write the following equation to represent this relationship:

W = R + 2

Now we have a system of two equations, and we can solve it step by step.

First, let's substitute the second equation into the first one:

3R + 5(R + 2) = 42
3R + 5R + 10 = 42
8R + 10 = 42
8R = 42 - 10
8R = 32
R = 32 / 8
R = 4

So, Jerry has 4 red chickens.

To find the number of white chickens, we can substitute R = 4 into the second equation:

W = R + 2
W = 4 + 2
W = 6

So, Jerry has 6 white chickens. But the problem asks for the number of red chickens, so the final answer is:

Jerry has 4 red chickens.
