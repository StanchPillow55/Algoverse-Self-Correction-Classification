==================================================

Let's denote the number of red chickens as R and the number of white chickens as W. 

From the problem, we know that:

1) W = R + 2 (since Jerry has two more white chickens than red chickens)

2) 3R + 5W = 42 (since red chickens produce 3 eggs a day and white chickens produce 5 eggs a day, and Jerry collects 42 eggs a day)

We can substitute the first equation into the second equation to solve for R:

3R + 5(R + 2) = 42
3R + 5R + 10 = 42
8R + 10 = 42
8R = 42 - 10
8R = 32
R = 32 / 8
R = 4

So, Jerry has 4 red chickens.

We can check our work by substituting R = 4 into the first equation:

W = 4 + 2
W = 6

And then substituting R = 4 and W = 6 into the second equation:

3(4) + 5(6) = 42
12 + 30 = 42
42 = 42

Since both equations are satisfied, our solution is correct. Jerry has 4 red chickens.
