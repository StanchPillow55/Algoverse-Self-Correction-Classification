Let's denote the number of red chickens as R and the number of white chickens as W. 

From the problem, we know that the white chickens produce 5 eggs a day and the red chickens produce 3 eggs a day. We also know that Jerry collects 42 eggs a day. This gives us the following equation:

5W + 3R = 42

We also know from the problem that Jerry has two more white chickens than red chickens. This gives us the following equation:

W = R + 2

Now we can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for R:

5(R + 2) + 3R = 42
5R + 10 + 3R = 42
8R + 10 = 42
8R = 42 - 10
8R = 32
R = 32 / 8
R = 4

So, Jerry has 4 red chickens.

To check our work, we can substitute R = 4 into the second equation to find W:

W = R + 2
W = 4 + 2
W = 6

Substituting R = 4 and W = 6 into the first equation, we get:

5(6) + 3(4) = 42
30 + 12 = 42
42 = 42

Since the left-hand side equals the right-hand side, our solution is correct. Jerry has 4 red chickens.
