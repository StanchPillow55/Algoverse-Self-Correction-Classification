==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to find the missing word in the given query.

Given information:
- The passage mentions that rich Arab playboys bring their supercars from the Middle East to London, usually for just a few weeks over the summer.
- The query states that a fleet of such supercars have descended on south-west London, owned by sons of sheikhs to escape the @placeholder's baking mid-summer months.

Based on the context provided in the passage, the missing word in the query is likely to be "desert" or a similar term that refers to the hot climate in the Middle East.

Reasoning:
1. The passage states that the car owners, many of them from Qatar, Saudi Arabia, UAE, and Kuwait, bring their supercars to London to escape the hot summer months in their home countries.
2. The query specifically mentions that the sons of sheikhs have brought their supercars to south-west London to escape the @placeholder's baking mid-summer months.
3. The term "desert" or a similar word that refers to the hot climate in the Middle East would be the most appropriate word to fill the @placeholder in the query.
