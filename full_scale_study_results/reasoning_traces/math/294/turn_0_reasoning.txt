Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to find out how old the youngest son is. We know that the oldest son is 8 years old, and the youngest is half as old as the oldest. So, the youngest son is 8/2 = 4 years old.

Next, we need to find out how many oranges the two sons wash. We know that each son washes as many oranges as they are years old. So, the oldest son washes 8 oranges and the youngest son washes 4 oranges. Together, they wash 8 + 4 = 12 oranges.

Finally, we need to find out how many oranges are left unwashed. We know that Will bought 15 oranges and the sons washed 12 oranges. So, there are 15 - 12 = 3 oranges left unwashed.

Therefore, the final answer is that there are 3 oranges left unwashed.
