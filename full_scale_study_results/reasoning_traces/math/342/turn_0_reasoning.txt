==================================================

Laurel's friend gave her 24 baby outfits. At her baby shower, she received twice the amount of new baby outfits. This means she received 24 outfits * 2 = <<24*2=48>>48 outfits at her baby shower.

Adding the outfits from her friend and the baby shower, Laurel has 24 outfits + 48 outfits = <<24+48=72>>72 outfits.

Then, Laurel's mom gifted her with another 15 baby outfits. So, in total, Laurel has 72 outfits + 15 outfits = <<72+15=87>>87 baby outfits.

Therefore, Laurel has 87 baby outfits for her baby.
