To find out how many baby outfits Laurel has in total, we will break down the problem step by step.

1. **Determine the number of outfits from her friend:**
   Laurel's friend gave her 24 baby outfits.
   \[
   \text{Outfits from friend} = 24
   \]

2. **Calculate the number of new outfits received at the baby shower:**
   Laurel received twice the amount of outfits from her friend at her baby shower. Therefore, we calculate:
   \[
   \text{Outfits from baby shower} = 2 \times \text{Outfits from friend} = 2 \times 24 = 48
   \]

3. **Determine the number of outfits gifted by her mom:**
   Laurel's mom gifted her an additional 15 baby outfits.
   \[
   \text{Outfits from mom} = 15
   \]

4. **Calculate the total number of outfits:**
   Now we will add all the outfits together to find the total number of baby outfits Laurel has:
   \[
   \text{Total outfits} = \text{Outfits from friend} + \text{Outfits from baby shower} + \text{Outfits from mom}
   \]
   Substituting in the values we calculated:
   \[
   \text{Total outfits} = 24 + 48 + 15
   \]

5. **Perform the addition:**
   First, add the outfits from the friend and the baby shower:
   \[
   24 + 48 = 72
   \]
   Now, add the outfits from her mom:
   \[
   72 + 15 = 87
   \]

Thus, the total number of baby outfits Laurel has is:
\[
\boxed{87}
\]
