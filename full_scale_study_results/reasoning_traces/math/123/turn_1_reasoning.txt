Question ID: 123
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to calculate how many miles Rosie can run at a speed of 10 miles per hour for 3 hours. The distance covered is calculated by multiplying the speed by the time. So, for the first 3 hours, Rosie can run:

10 miles/hour * 3 hours = 30 miles

After 3 hours, she still has 7 - 3 = 4 hours left to run at a speed of 5 miles per hour. Again, we calculate the distance covered by multiplying the speed by the time. So, for the remaining 4 hours, Rosie can run:

5 miles/hour * 4 hours = 20 miles

Finally, we add the two distances together to find the total distance Rosie can run in 7 hours:

30 miles + 20 miles = 50 miles

So, Rosie can run 50 miles in 7 hours.
