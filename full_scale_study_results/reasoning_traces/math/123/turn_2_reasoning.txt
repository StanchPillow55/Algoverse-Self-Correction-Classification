Question ID: 123
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, let's calculate how many miles Rosie can run in the first 3 hours. Since she runs at a speed of 10 miles per hour, we can find the distance she covers in 3 hours by multiplying her speed by the time. 

10 miles/hour * 3 hours = 30 miles

After 3 hours, Rosie continues to run at a speed of 5 miles per hour. We know she runs for a total of 7 hours, so she runs at this slower speed for 7 hours - 3 hours = 4 hours.

Now, let's calculate how many miles Rosie can run in these 4 hours at a speed of 5 miles per hour. 

5 miles/hour * 4 hours = 20 miles

To find the total distance Rosie can run in 7 hours, we add the distance she covers in the first 3 hours to the distance she covers in the last 4 hours.

30 miles + 20 miles = 50 miles

So, Rosie can run 50 miles in 7 hours.
