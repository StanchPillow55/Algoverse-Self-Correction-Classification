Question ID: record_97846
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, I will break down the key information and then provide a step-by-step analysis.

Given information:
- The GOP-led House passed an immigration bill by a 223-189 vote.
- Democrats, including President Obama, have criticized the measure.
- The Senate failed to push through its version and left town for the month of August.
- With no legislation, Obama will act on his own.
- Obama called the resulting GOP legislation "the most extreme" version so far and said Republicans knew it had no chance of becoming law because the @placeholder-led Senate wouldn't pass it and he would veto it.

Step 1: Identify the missing information in the query.
The query mentions a "@placeholder-led Senate," but the given information does not specify who controls the Senate. We need to determine who controls the Senate to answer the question.

Step 2: Analyze the political landscape.
Based on the information provided, we can infer the following:
- The House is controlled by the GOP (Republican Party).
- The Senate failed to pass its own version of the immigration bill, suggesting the Senate may be controlled by a different party than the House.
-
