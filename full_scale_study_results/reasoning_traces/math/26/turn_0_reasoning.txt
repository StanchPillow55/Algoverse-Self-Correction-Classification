==================================================

Mishka bought 3 pairs of each item, so we need to multiply the cost of each item by 3 to find the total cost for each type of clothing.

For the shorts:
3 pairs * $16.50/pair = $49.50

For the pants:
3 pairs * $22.50/pair = $67.50

For the shoes:
3 pairs * $42.00/pair = $126.00

Now, we add up the total cost for each type of clothing to find the total cost for all the clothing items.

$49.50 (for shorts) + $67.50 (for pants) + $126.00 (for shoes) = $243.00

So, Mishka spent $243.00 on all the clothing items.
