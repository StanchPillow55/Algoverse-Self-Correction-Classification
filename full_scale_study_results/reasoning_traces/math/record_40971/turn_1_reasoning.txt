==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to compare the price of the Sky Now TV box (£9.99) with the price of the rival streaming boxes that start at around £50.

Given information:
- Sky Now TV box costs £9.99.
- Rival streaming boxes, such as Apple TV and Roku boxes, start at around £50.

Step 1: Calculate the difference in price between the Sky Now TV box and the rival streaming boxes.
Difference in price = Price of rival streaming boxes - Price of Sky Now TV box
Difference in price = £50 - £9.99 = £40.01

Step 2: Interpret the result.
The difference in price between the Sky Now TV box and the rival streaming boxes is £40.01. This means that the Sky Now TV box is significantly cheaper than the rival streaming boxes, costing £40.01 less.

Therefore, the Sky Now TV box, priced at £9.99, is significantly cheaper than the rival streaming boxes that start at around £50.
