==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to compare the price of the Sky Now TV box (£9.99) with the price of the rival streaming boxes, which start at around £50.

Given information:
- Sky Now TV box costs £9.99.
- Rival streaming boxes, such as Apple TV and Roku boxes, start at around £50.

Step 1: Calculate the difference in price between the Sky Now TV box and the rival streaming boxes.
Difference in price = Price of rival streaming boxes - Price of Sky Now TV box
Difference in price = £50 - £9.99 = £40.01

Step 2: Interpret the results.
The Sky Now TV box is priced £40.01 lower than the rival streaming boxes, which start at around £50.

Therefore, the final answer is:
The Sky Now TV box is priced £40.01 lower than the rival streaming boxes, which start at around £50.
