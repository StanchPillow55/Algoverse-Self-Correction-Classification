Question ID: 719
Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

Goldy gave away a total of 3 sacks to her cousin and 4 sacks to her brother. 

To find the total number of sacks she gave away, we add the number of sacks given to her cousin and brother:

3 sacks (cousin) + 4 sacks (brother) = 7 sacks

Each sack of rice weighs 25 kilograms. To find out how many kilograms of rice Goldy gave away, we multiply the total number of sacks by the weight of each sack:

7 sacks * 25 kilograms/sack = 175 kilograms

So, Goldy gave away a total of 175 kilograms of rice to her cousin and brother.
