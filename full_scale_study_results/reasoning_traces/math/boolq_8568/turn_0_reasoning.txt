==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to gather information about the cast of The Honeymooners and their current status.

Given information:
- Joyce Randolph, who played Trixie Norton on The Honeymooners, was born on October 21, 1924.

To determine if any of the Honeymooners cast is still alive, we need to research the other main cast members and their current status.

The main cast of The Honeymooners consisted of:
1. Jackie Gleason as Ralph Kramden
2. Art Carney as Ed Norton
3. Audrey Meadows as Alice Kramden
4. Joyce Randolph as Trixie Norton

Let's investigate the current status of each cast member:

1. Jackie Gleason (Ralph Kramden):
   - Jackie Gleason was born on February 26, 1916.
   - He passed away on June 24, 1987, at the age of 71.

2. Art Carney (Ed Norton):
   - Art Carney was born on November 4, 1918.
   - He passed away
