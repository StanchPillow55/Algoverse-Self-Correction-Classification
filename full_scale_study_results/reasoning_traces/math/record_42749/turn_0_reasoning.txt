==================================================

This is not a typical math problem that requires calculations. The passage and the query provided do not contain any numerical information that can be used to solve a math problem. 

The passage is about a debate over where the remains of Richard III should be buried, and the query suggests that the decision should be made by an independent panel of experts rather than the archaeologists from the University of Leicester who were involved in the discovery of the remains.

To address the query, I would need to provide a response that discusses the reasoning behind the suggestion to have an independent panel make the decision, rather than performing mathematical calculations. Some key points I could make in my response:

1. The passage indicates that the Dean of York, who was previously the Dean of Leicester, has received a "torrent of hate mail" due to the ongoing debate over Richard III's burial location. This suggests there are strong opinions and biases on both sides of the issue.

2. The query suggests the archaeologists from the University of Leicester "clearly support the Leicester cause", implying they may not be impartial in deciding the final resting place.

3. Having an independent panel of experts, rather than the archaeologists directly involved, could help ensure a more objective and balanced decision
