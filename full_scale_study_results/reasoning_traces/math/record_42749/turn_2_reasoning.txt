Question ID: record_42749
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

I apologize, but I do not see a specific math problem in the provided passage. The passage discusses the debate over where the remains of Richard III should be buried, and mentions that the Dean of York has received abusive letters regarding this issue. 

However, there is no numerical information or math-related question that I can solve. The passage appears to be a news article discussing a historical and political debate, rather than a math problem. Without a clear math-related question or problem statement, I am unable to provide a step-by-step solution or final answer. Please let me know if you have a specific math problem you would like me to solve, and I will be happy to assist.
