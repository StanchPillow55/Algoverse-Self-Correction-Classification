==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine the appropriate placeholder for the investigation that is underway.

Given information:
- NSW Police have confirmed that the murder victims were Jamie Edwards and Joelene 'Peggy' Joyce.
- A police strike force, Strike Force Kennedia, has been established to investigate their deaths.
- The bodies were found on the side of a road in the NSW border town of Moama.
- The murder weapon has not yet been found.

Based on the information provided, the appropriate placeholder for the investigation that is underway is:

@placeholder = Strike Force Kennedia

Explanation:
The passage clearly states that NSW Police have established Strike Force Kennedia to investigate the deaths of Jamie Edwards and Joelene 'Peggy' Joyce. This is the police investigation that is currently underway.

Therefore, the final answer is:

An investigation is under way as part of Strike Force Kennedia.
