==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to understand the context and the key information provided in the passage.

The passage discusses the issue of firearms and gun violence in the United States. It mentions that in 2010, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) tallied more than 31,000 firearm deaths in the United States, and that each year, some 55,000 violent deaths occur in the country, costing $60 billion in medical care and lost productivity.

The passage also mentions that for the first time, protection outranks hunting as a reason to own guns.

The query asks about the position of the @placeholder (which is likely referring to the National Rifle Association, or NRA) on government research into gun violence, 17 years after the CDC restrictions were put in place.

To answer this question, we need to:
1. Understand the context of the CDC restrictions on gun violence research.
2. Determine the NRA's position on government research into gun violence.
3. Provide a final answer based on the information given.
