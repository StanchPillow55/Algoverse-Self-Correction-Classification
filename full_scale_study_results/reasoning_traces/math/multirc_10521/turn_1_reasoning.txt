==================================================

The passage provides the following key information:

1. Since the 2009 disputed elections and associated government crackdown on the overall reform movement, the Iranian government has increasingly targeted women activists.

2. The reasons behind this go beyond the misogynist nature of Iran's religious leadership. 

3. Rather, it is more part of a deliberate and calculated strategy of the Iranian authorities to strike at the heart of the regime's greatest vulnerability - its internal legitimacy with its own people.

The passage suggests that the Iranian government's targeting of women activists is not simply due to misogyny, but is a strategic move to undermine the broader reform movement and the regime's internal legitimacy.

The passage draws an analogy between the women's movement in Iran and other movements, such as religious groups in Burma or Tibet, or labor movements in Eastern Europe, which initially advocated for the freedoms of a specific group but ultimately had the power to promote broader human rights progress. 

The Iranian government recognizes and fears this transformative power of the women's movement, and is therefore deliberately targeting women activists as part of a calculated strategy to maintain its hold on power.

Therefore, the reason the Iranian government has increasingly targeted the reform movement
