Let's denote the amount of money the first person took as x. 

According to the problem, the second person took $80 more than the first person, so we can denote the second person's share as x + $80. 

The third person took twice what the second took, so we can denote the third person's share as 2*(x + $80) = 2x + $160.

The total amount of money is $1920, so we can set up the following equation:

x + (x + $80) + (2x + $160) = $1920

Solving this equation will give us the amount of money the first person took.

First, simplify the equation:

4x + $240 = $1920

Subtract $240 from both sides of the equation:

4x = $1680

Finally, divide both sides of the equation by 4 to solve for x:

x = $420

So, the first person took $420.
