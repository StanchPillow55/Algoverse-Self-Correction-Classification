==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine how much each person received from the total amount of $1920, given the conditions described.

Let's define the share of the first person as \( x \).

According to the problem:
- The second person took $80 more than the first person. Therefore, the share of the second person is \( x + 80 \).
- The third person took twice what the second person took. Therefore, the share of the third person is \( 2(x + 80) \).

Now, we can express the total amount shared by the three people as the sum of their individual shares:
\[
x + (x + 80) + 2(x + 80) = 1920
\]

Let's simplify and solve this equation step by step:
1. Expand the terms:
   \[
   x + x + 80 + 2(x + 80) = 1920
   \]

2. Distribute the 2 in the third term:
   \[
   x + x + 80 + 2x + 160 = 1920
   \]

3. Combine like terms:
   \[
   4x + 240 = 1920
   \]

4. Subtract 240 from both sides to isolate the terms with \( x \):
   \[
   4x = 1920 - 240
   \]
   \[
   4x = 1680
   \]

5. Divide both sides by 4 to solve for \( x \):
   \[
   x = \frac{1680}{4}
   \]
   \[
   x = 420
   \]

Thus, the share of the first person is \( \boxed{420} \).

To verify, let's calculate the shares of the second and third persons using \( x = 420 \):
- The second person's share: \( x + 80 = 420 + 80 = 500 \).
- The third person's share: \( 2(x + 80) = 2 \times 500 = 1000 \).

Adding these amounts together:
\[
420 + 500 + 1000 = 1920
\]

The total matches the original amount, confirming that our solution is correct. The share of the first person is indeed \( \boxed{420} \).
