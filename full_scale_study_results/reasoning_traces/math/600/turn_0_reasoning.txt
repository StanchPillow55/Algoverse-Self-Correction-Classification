Question ID: 600
Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

Jamaal initially uses an 8-pound weight. He then increases the weight he uses by 50%. 

To calculate the new weight, we need to find 50% of 8 pounds and add it to the original weight. 

50% of 8 pounds is calculated as follows:

50/100 * 8 = 4 pounds

So, the increased weight is 8 pounds (original weight) + 4 pounds (increase) = 12 pounds.

However, this weight turns out to be too heavy for Jamaal, so he uses a weight two pounds lighter than that. 

So, the weight he now uses is 12 pounds - 2 pounds = 10 pounds.

Therefore, Jamaal now uses a 10-pound weight.
