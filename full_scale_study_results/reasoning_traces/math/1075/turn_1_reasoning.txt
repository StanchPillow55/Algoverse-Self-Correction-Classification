Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, let's calculate the cost of the roses. Since a dozen roses cost $15 and she bought more than a dozen, it would be cheaper to buy a dozen and then the remaining roses separately. 

So, she bought one dozen (12 roses) for $15 and then bought the remaining 3 roses at $2 each. 

The cost of the 3 roses is 3 * $2 = $6.

So, the total cost of the roses is $15 (for the dozen) + $6 (for the 3 roses) = $21.

Jenny arrived with five 5 dollar bills, which is 5 * $5 = $25.

So, she paid $25 for the roses that cost $21. 

The change she should receive is $25 - $21 = $4.

Since the florist only has quarters for change, we need to calculate how many quarters make up $4. 

Since 1 quarter is equal to $0.25, the number of quarters in $4 is $4 / $0.25 = 16 quarters.

So, Jenny leaves with 16 quarters.
