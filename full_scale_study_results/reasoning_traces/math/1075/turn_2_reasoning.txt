Question ID: 1075
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, let's calculate how much Jenny spent on roses. 

Since a dozen roses cost $15 and she bought 15 roses, she bought one dozen and three additional roses. 

The cost for the dozen is $15. 

The cost for the three additional roses is 3 roses * $2/rose = $6.

So, the total cost for the roses is $15 + $6 = $21.

Jenny arrived with five 5-dollar bills, so she had 5 bills * $5/bill = $25.

She paid $21 out of her $25, so she had $25 - $21 = $4 left.

Since the florist only has quarters for change, we need to convert the $4 into quarters. 

There are 4 quarters in a dollar, so in $4 there are 4 quarters/dollar * $4 = 16 quarters.

Therefore, Jenny leaves with 16 quarters.
