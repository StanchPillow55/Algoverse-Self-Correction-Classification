==================================================

First, let's calculate the cost of the roses. Since a dozen roses cost $15 and Jenny bought 15 roses, she bought a dozen and three more roses. 

The cost of a dozen roses is $15. The cost of the three additional roses is 3 roses * $2/rose = $6. 

So, the total cost of the roses is $15 + $6 = $21.

Jenny arrived with five 5 dollar bills, so she had 5 bills * $5/bill = $25.

The florist only has quarters for change. A quarter is worth $0.25, so the amount of change Jenny receives is $25 - $21 = $4.

To find out how many quarters Jenny receives, we divide the total change by the value of a quarter: $4 / $0.25/quarter = 16 quarters.

Therefore, Jenny leaves with 16 quarters.
