Question ID: record_79498
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, I will need to extract the relevant information from the given passage and then apply logical reasoning to determine the answer.

Given information:
- The passage is about Prince Harry's girlfriend, Cressida Bonas, having lunch with Princess Eugenie, who introduced them.
- The passage does not mention anyone wearing a black tuxedo or arriving in a car.

Since the passage does not contain any information about someone wearing a black tuxedo and arriving in a car, I do not have enough information to answer the given query. The query appears to be unrelated to the content of the passage.

Therefore, the final answer is: I do not have enough information to answer the given query.
