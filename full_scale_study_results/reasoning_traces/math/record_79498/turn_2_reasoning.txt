==================================================

I'm afraid I don't have enough information to solve a math problem based on the given passage. The passage describes a social event involving Prince Harry, his girlfriend Cressida Bonas, and his cousin Princess Eugenie. It does not contain any numerical data or mathematical information that I could use to solve a math problem. Without a specific math question or problem statement, I cannot provide a step-by-step solution. I'd be happy to assist you with a math problem if you can provide the necessary details. Please let me know if you have a different question I can try to help with.
