==================================================

James delivers a total of 600 newspapers in a day. 

He delivers 198 newspapers to District A and 209 newspapers to District C. 

To find out how many newspapers he delivers to District B, we need to subtract the number of newspapers he delivers to District A and District C from the total number of newspapers he delivers in a day.

So, we calculate: 

600 (total newspapers) - 198 (newspapers to District A) - 209 (newspapers to District C) = number of newspapers to District B.

Doing the subtraction, we get:

600 - 198 = 402

Then, 402 - 209 = 193

Therefore, James delivers 193 newspapers to District B.
