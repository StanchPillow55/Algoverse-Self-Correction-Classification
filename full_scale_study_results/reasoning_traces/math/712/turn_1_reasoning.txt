Question ID: 712
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, let's determine how much candy each person eats in two weeks. 

We know that there are 7 days in a week, so two weeks would be 2 * 7 = 14 days.

Ginger eats 4 pieces of candy a day, so over two weeks, she would eat 4 * 14 = 56 pieces of candy.

Amy eats 3 pieces of candy a day, so over two weeks, she would eat 3 * 14 = 42 pieces of candy.

Now, let's determine how much candy each person has left after two weeks. 

Ginger started with 100 pieces and ate 56 pieces, so she has 100 - 56 = 44 pieces of candy left.

Amy started with 100 pieces and ate 42 pieces, so she has 100 - 42 = 58 pieces of candy left.

Finally, let's determine how much more candy Amy has than Ginger. 

Amy has 58 pieces and Ginger has 44 pieces, so Amy has 58 - 44 = 14 more pieces of candy than Ginger.

So, after two weeks, Amy has 14 more pieces of candy than Ginger.
