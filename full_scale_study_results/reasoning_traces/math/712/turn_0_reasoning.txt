==================================================

First, we need to determine how many days are in two weeks. Since there are 7 days in a week, two weeks would be 2 * 7 = 14 days.

Next, we need to calculate how much candy Ginger and Amy each eat in two weeks. 

Ginger eats 4 pieces of candy a day, so over 14 days, she would eat 4 * 14 = 56 pieces of candy.

Amy eats 3 pieces of candy a day, so over 14 days, she would eat 3 * 14 = 42 pieces of candy.

Now, we subtract the amount of candy each girl ate from the original amount of 100 pieces to see how much they each have left.

Ginger started with 100 pieces and ate 56, so she has 100 - 56 = 44 pieces left.

Amy started with 100 pieces and ate 42, so she has 100 - 42 = 58 pieces left.

Finally, to find out how much more candy Amy has than Ginger, we subtract Ginger's amount from Amy's amount. 

So, 58 - 44 = 14 pieces of candy.

Therefore, Amy has 14 more pieces of candy than Ginger after two weeks.
