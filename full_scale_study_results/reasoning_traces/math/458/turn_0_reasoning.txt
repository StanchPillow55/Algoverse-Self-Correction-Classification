Question ID: 458
Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to find the total number of puppies. Jennifer's dog has 8 puppies and Brandon's dog has 12 puppies. So, the total number of puppies is 8 + 12 = 20 puppies.

Next, we need to find out how many puppies have spots. Jennifer's dog has 3 puppies with spots and Brandon's dog has 4 puppies with spots. So, the total number of puppies with spots is 3 + 4 = 7 puppies.

Now, we need to find out what percentage of all the puppies have spots. To do this, we divide the number of puppies with spots by the total number of puppies and then multiply by 100 to get the percentage.

So, the percentage of puppies with spots is (7 / 20) * 100 = 35%.

Therefore, 35% of all the puppies have spots.
