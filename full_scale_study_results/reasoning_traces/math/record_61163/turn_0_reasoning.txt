To solve this problem, I will break it down into the following steps:

1. Understand the context and the question being asked.
2. Identify the relevant information and data points.
3. Analyze the information and data to formulate a response.
4. Provide a final answer with a clear explanation.

Step 1: Understanding the context and the question.
The passage discusses the economic situation in the UK and the potential impact on the upcoming general election. The question being asked is why the Conservative party, led by David Cameron, is not on track for a convincing victory, despite the recent positive economic news.

Step 2: Identifying the relevant information and data points.
The key information and data points from the passage are:
- The economy is suddenly looking "rosy" or positive.
- Lord Digby Jones, a former trade minister under Labour, claims that Ed Miliband and Ed Balls (Labour politicians) were wrong about the economy.
- Jones says Miliband and Balls made "nightmare predictions" and drew a "gloomy picture" of the economy.
- However, the passage notes that jobs figures are up, inflation and interest rates are down
