==================================================

First, we need to find out the cost of each bottle of soda and water.

Given that seven bottles of soda cost $21.00, we can find the cost of one bottle by dividing the total cost by the number of bottles. 

So, $21.00 ÷ 7 = $3.00. 

This means each bottle of soda costs $3.00.

Next, we find out the cost of each bottle of water. Given that four bottles of water cost $8.00, we can find the cost of one bottle by dividing the total cost by the number of bottles. 

So, $8.00 ÷ 4 = $2.00. 

This means each bottle of water costs $2.00.

Now that we know the cost of each bottle, we can calculate how much David will pay for 3 bottles of soda and 2 bottles of water.

The cost for the soda is 3 bottles × $3.00/bottle = $9.00.
The cost for the water is 2 bottles × $2.00/bottle = $4.00.

Adding these two amounts together gives the total cost: $9.00 + $4.00 = $13.00.

So, David will pay $13.00 for 3 bottles of soda and 2 bottles of water.
