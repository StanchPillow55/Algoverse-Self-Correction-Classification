==================================================

First, let's determine how long the Llesis family spent driving. We know they spent a total of 6 hours traveling and 1.5 hours hiking, so they must have spent 6 - 1.5 = 4.5 hours driving.

Next, let's calculate how far they drove. We know they drove at an average speed of 50 miles per hour for 4.5 hours, so they must have driven 50 * 4.5 = 225 miles.

Now, let's determine their hiking speed. We know they hiked at a speed 5 miles per hour less than half their driving speed. Half their driving speed is 50 / 2 = 25 miles per hour, so their hiking speed must have been 25 - 5 = 20 miles per hour.

Finally, let's calculate how far they hiked. We know they hiked at an average speed of 20 miles per hour for 1.5 hours, so they must have hiked 20 * 1.5 = 30 miles.

Adding the distance they drove to the distance they hiked gives us the total distance to their vacation spot: 225 miles + 30 miles = 255 miles.

So, the Llesis family's vacation spot was 255 miles away.
