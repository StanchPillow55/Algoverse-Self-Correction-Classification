==================================================

To determine if the word "stuff" is used with the same meaning in both sentences, we need to analyze the context and usage of the word in each sentence.

Sentence 1: "You don't have the stuff to be a United States Marine."
In this sentence, the word "stuff" is used to refer to the qualities, skills, or abilities required to become a United States Marine. It is used in a more abstract, figurative sense.

Sentence 2: "The trunk was full of stuff."
In this sentence, the word "stuff" is used to refer to physical objects or belongings that are stored in the trunk. It is used in a more concrete, literal sense.

Based on the different usages of the word "stuff" in the two sentences, we can conclude that the word is not used with the same meaning in both sentences.

In the first sentence, "stuff" is used to describe the necessary qualities or qualifications, while in the second sentence, "stuff" is used to describe physical items or belongings.

Therefore, the answer is:
No, the word "stuff" is not used with the same meaning in both sentences.
