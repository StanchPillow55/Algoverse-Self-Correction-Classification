Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

Christina has recorded her mood for 30 days. The first 8 days were good, the next 8 days were bad, and the third 8 days were neutral. This accounts for 24 days. The next three days were good, neutral, and good. This accounts for 27 days. 

So, there are 30 - 27 = 3 days left in the month.

We know that she had 12 good days in total. She had 8 good days in the first 8 days and 2 more good days in the next three days. So, she had 8 + 2 = 10 good days so far.

Therefore, the number of good days left in the month is 12 - 10 = 2 days. 

So, Christina had 2 more good days left in the month.
