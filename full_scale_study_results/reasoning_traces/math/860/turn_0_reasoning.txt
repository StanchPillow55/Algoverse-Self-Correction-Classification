Dataset Type: math
==================================================

Jennifer bought 12 oranges. 

She gave her three daughters 2 oranges each, so that's 3 daughters * 2 oranges/daughter = 6 oranges. 

She also gave her only boy 3 oranges. 

So in total, she gave away 6 oranges + 3 oranges = 9 oranges. 

She started with 12 oranges, so after giving away 9, she has 12 oranges - 9 oranges = 3 oranges left. 

So, Jennifer remained with 3 oranges.
