To solve this problem, we need to find the missing city name in the given passage.

Given information:
- The passage mentions the cities of Sirte and Bani Walid, which are strongholds of Moammar Gadhafi's forces.
- The passage also mentions that "fierce fighting" is ongoing in the southwestern city of Sabha.

The query states that the situation was different in a "diehard pro-Gadhafi city in southwestern Libya", which is not mentioned in the passage.
