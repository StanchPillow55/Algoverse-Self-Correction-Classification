Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

Dylan bought 38 chicken sausages. 

He bought 6 more fish sausages than chicken sausages. This means he bought 38 chicken sausages + 6 more fish sausages = 38 + 6 = 44 fish sausages.

To find the total number of sausages Dylan bought, we add the number of chicken sausages to the number of fish sausages. 

So, 38 chicken sausages + 44 fish sausages = 38 + 44 = 82 sausages.

Therefore, Dylan bought a total of 82 sausages.
