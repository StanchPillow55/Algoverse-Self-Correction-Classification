Question ID: 126
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to find out how many fish sausages Dylan bought. Since he bought 6 more fish sausages than chicken sausages, and he bought 38 chicken sausages, we add 38 and 6 to find the total number of fish sausages. 

38 chicken sausages + 6 = 44 fish sausages

Next, we add the number of chicken sausages and fish sausages together to find the total number of sausages Dylan bought.

38 chicken sausages + 44 fish sausages = 82 sausages

So, Dylan bought 82 sausages in all.
