==================================================

Let's start by figuring out how much money Anthony has. Since Anthony has saved $10.00 more than Eva, and Eva has saved $20.00, we can add $10.00 to $20.00 to find out how much Anthony has saved. 

$20.00 + $10.00 = $30.00

So, Anthony has saved $30.00.

Next, we need to figure out how much money Roy has. We know that Roy has saved 40% more than Anthony. To find out how much this is, we need to calculate 40% of $30.00. 

40% of $30.00 = 0.40 * $30.00 = $12.00

So, Roy has saved $12.00 more than Anthony. To find out how much money Roy has, we add this $12.00 to the $30.00 that Anthony has saved.

$30.00 + $12.00 = $42.00

So, Roy has saved $42.00. 

Therefore, the final answer is that Roy has $42.00.
