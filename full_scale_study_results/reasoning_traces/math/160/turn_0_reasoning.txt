==================================================

The problem involves a series of changes to the depth of water in a tank.

On Monday, the tank has a depth of 17 feet.

On Tuesday, the tank has 7 feet more water. To find the new depth, we add 7 feet to the original 17 feet:

17 feet + 7 feet = 24 feet

So, on Tuesday, the tank has a depth of 24 feet.

On Wednesday, the depth of the water is two thirds of what it was on Tuesday. To find this new depth, we multiply Tuesday's depth by 2/3:

24 feet * 2/3 = 16 feet

So, on Wednesday, the tank has a depth of 16 feet.

Therefore, the tankâ€™s water depth on Wednesday is 16 feet.
