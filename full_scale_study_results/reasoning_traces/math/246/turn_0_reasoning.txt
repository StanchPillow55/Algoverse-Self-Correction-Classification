==================================================

First, we need to calculate how much Jean is charged per day for her makeup. This is done by multiplying the hourly rate by the number of hours the makeup artist works each day. 

$250/hour * 6 hours/day = $1500/day

Next, we need to calculate how much Jean is charged per week. This is done by multiplying the daily rate by the number of days the makeup artist works each week.

$1500/day * 4 days/week = $6000/week

Then, we need to calculate how much Jean is charged for the entire movie. This is done by multiplying the weekly rate by the number of weeks the movie takes to finish.

$6000/week * 5 weeks = $30000

Finally, we need to calculate the amount of the discount. This is done by multiplying the total cost by the discount rate.

$30000 * 10% = $3000

Subtract the discount from the total cost to find out how much Jean paid.

$30000 - $3000 = $27000

So, Jean paid $27000 for her makeup for the movie.
