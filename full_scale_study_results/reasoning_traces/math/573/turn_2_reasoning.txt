Question ID: 573
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine how much money Katina will have left in her savings account after she withdraws $100 every month for 2 years.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Initial Amount:**
   - Katina starts with $3000 in her savings account.

2. **Monthly Withdrawal:**
   - She withdraws $100 each month.

3. **Time Period:**
   - The time period in question is 2 years.

4. **Convert Years to Months:**
   - Since she withdraws money monthly, we need to convert the time period from years to months.
   - There are 12 months in a year, so in 2 years, there are:
     \[
     2 \text{ years} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 24 \text{ months}
     \]

5. **Total Amount Withdrawn:**
   - Katina withdraws $100 each month for 24 months. Therefore, the total amount withdrawn is:
     \[
     100 \text{ dollars/month} \times 24 \text{ months} = 2400 \text{ dollars}
     \]

6. **Remaining Amount in the Account:**
   - To find out how much money is left in the account after 2 years, subtract the total amount withdrawn from the initial amount:
     \[
     3000 \text{ dollars} - 2400 \text{ dollars} = 600 \text{ dollars}
     \]

### Conclusion:

After 2 years, with Katina withdrawing $100 every month, she will have $600 remaining in her savings account.

**Final Answer: $600**
