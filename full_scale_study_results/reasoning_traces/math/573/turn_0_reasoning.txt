Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to determine the total amount of money Katina will remove from her savings account over the course of 2 years. 

There are 12 months in a year, so over 2 years, there are 2 * 12 = 24 months.

If Katina removes $100 from her account every month, then over 24 months, she will remove 24 * $100 = $2400 from her account.

Katina started with $3000 in her account. If she removes $2400, then the amount of money remaining in the account will be $3000 - $2400 = $600.

So, after 2 years, Katina will have $600 remaining in her savings account.
