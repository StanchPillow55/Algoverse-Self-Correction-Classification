Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine how much money Katina will have left in her savings account after 2 years if she withdraws $100 every month.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Initial Amount**: Katina starts with $3000 in her savings account.

2. **Monthly Withdrawal**: Katina withdraws $100 every month.

3. **Time Period**: We need to calculate the total amount withdrawn over 2 years. Since there are 12 months in a year, 2 years will have:
   \[
   2 \text{ years} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 24 \text{ months}
   \]

4. **Total Withdrawal Over 2 Years**: Multiply the monthly withdrawal amount by the number of months:
   \[
   100 \text{ dollars/month} \times 24 \text{ months} = 2400 \text{ dollars}
   \]

5. **Remaining Amount in the Account**: Subtract the total amount withdrawn from the initial amount:
   \[
   3000 \text{ dollars} - 2400 \text{ dollars} = 600 \text{ dollars}
   \]

### Final Answer:
After 2 years, Katina will have $600 remaining in her savings account.
