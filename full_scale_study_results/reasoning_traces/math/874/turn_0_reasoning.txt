Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to find out how much Ella earns per hour. We do this by dividing the total amount she earned by the total hours she worked. 

So, $33 รท 3 hours = $11 per hour.

This means Ella earns $11 for each hour she walks dogs.

Next, we need to find out how much she would earn for 12 hours of work. We do this by multiplying her hourly rate by the number of hours.

So, $11 per hour ร 12 hours = $132.

Therefore, if Ella continues to walk dogs at the same rate, she would earn $132 after 12 hours.
