Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, let's determine how much Lauren is saving each year. If she earns $100,000 annually and saves 20% of her paycheck, she saves $100,000 * 0.20 = $20,000 per year.

Next, let's determine how much money she needs to save for her retirement. If she plans to live on 40% of her current salary during her retirement, she will need $100,000 * 0.40 = $40,000 per year.

If she plans to retire for 20 years, she will need $40,000 * 20 = $800,000 in total.

Finally, let's determine how many more years she needs to work to save this amount. If she saves $20,000 per year, she will need $800,000 / $20,000 = 40 years to save enough for her retirement.

Therefore, Lauren needs to work for 40 more years to save enough for her retirement.
