Question ID: 1105
Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, let's determine how much Lauren is saving each year. If she's saving 20% of her $100,000 salary, she's saving $100,000 * 0.20 = $20,000 per year.

Next, let's determine how much money Lauren will need for her retirement. If she plans to live on 40% of her current salary for 20 years, she'll need $100,000 * 0.40 * 20 = $800,000.

Now, let's determine how many more years Lauren needs to work to save this amount. If she's saving $20,000 per year, she'll need to work $800,000 / $20,000 = 40 years.

However, since the question asks for how many more years she needs to work, we need to subtract the years she has already worked. Since the question doesn't specify how many years she has already worked, we can't provide a final answer. 

If the question had specified how many years Lauren has already worked, we would subtract that number from 40 to get the final answer.
