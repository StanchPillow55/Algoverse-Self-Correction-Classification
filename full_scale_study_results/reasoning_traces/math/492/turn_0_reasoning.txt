Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to find out how much the family-size pizza costs. Since it's 3 times as much as the small pizza, we multiply the cost of the small pizza by 3.

$8 * 3 = $24

So, the family-size pizza costs $24.

Next, we add the cost of the small pizza and the family-size pizza to find out how much Sally spends in total.

$8 + $24 = $32

So, Sally spends $32 in total.
