Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

The train starts with 172 people. 

At the first stop, 47 people get off, so we subtract 47 from 172. 

172 - 47 = 125 people are left on the train. 

Then, 13 more people get on the train, so we add 13 to 125. 

125 + 13 = 138 people are now on the train. 

At the next stop, 38 people get off, so we subtract 38 from 138. 

138 - 38 = 100 people. 

So, there are 100 people left on the train. 

Therefore, the final answer is 100 people.
