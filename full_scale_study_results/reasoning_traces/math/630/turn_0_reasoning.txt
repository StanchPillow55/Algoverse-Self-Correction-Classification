Question ID: 630
Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to find out how many riders can stay upright when a wave over 30 feet arrives. We know that 25% of the riders can stay upright. 

So, we calculate 25% of 100 riders, which is 0.25 * 100 = 25 riders.

Next, we need to find out how many of these riders are men. We know that 60% of the riders who can stay upright are women, which means that 40% are men (since 100% - 60% = 40%).

So, we calculate 40% of 25 riders, which is 0.40 * 25 = 10 riders.

Therefore, 10 men can stay upright on the wave.
