==================================================

First, let's find out how long each wolf howls.

Tobias howls for 20 seconds.

Chikote howls for twice as long as Tobias, which means Chikote howls for 2 * 20 = <<2*20=40>>40 seconds.

Igneous howls for as long as the other two wolves combined, which means Igneous howls for 20 (Tobias) + 40 (Chikote) = <<20+40=60>>60 seconds.

Now, let's add up the total time all three wolves howl.

20 (Tobias) + 40 (Chikote) + 60 (Igneous) = <<20+40+60=120>>120 seconds.

Since there are 60 seconds in a minute, we need to convert the total time from seconds to minutes.

120 seconds รท 60 = <<120/60=2>>2 minutes.

So, the combined length of time of the three wolves' howls is 2 minutes.
