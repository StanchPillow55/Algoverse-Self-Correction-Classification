Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we first need to calculate how many pounds of carrots will be distributed to the 40 restaurants. 

Since each restaurant is to receive 2 pounds of carrots, we multiply the number of restaurants by the amount of carrots each restaurant is to receive. 

So, 40 restaurants * 2 pounds/restaurant = 80 pounds of carrots.

Next, we subtract the amount of carrots that will be distributed from the total amount of carrots. 

So, 200 pounds - 80 pounds = 120 pounds of carrots.

Therefore, 120 pounds of carrots will not be used.
