Question ID: 7
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, let's calculate how long it takes Carla to download the file without any interruptions. Given that the file is 200 GB and her download speed is 2 GB per minute, we can divide the total size of the file by her download speed to find the total time:

200 GB / 2 GB/minute = 100 minutes

However, the download is interrupted 40% of the way through. To find out when this happens, we multiply the total time by 40%:

100 minutes * 40% = 40 minutes

So, the interruption happens 40 minutes into the download. After the interruption, Carla has to restart the download from the beginning, which means she has to download the file for another 100 minutes. 

In addition, we know that the Windows update takes 20 minutes. 

Therefore, the total time Carla spends downloading the file and waiting for the update is:

40 minutes (initial download) + 20 minutes (Windows update) + 100 minutes (restarted download) = 160 minutes

So, it takes Carla 160 minutes to download the file.
