Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, let's calculate how long it takes Carla to download the file without any interruptions. 

The file is 200 GB and her download speed is 2 GB/minute. Therefore, it would take her 200 GB / 2 GB/minute = 100 minutes to download the file without any interruptions.

However, the download was interrupted 40% of the way through. To calculate how long she had been downloading before the interruption, we multiply the total download time by 0.40 (40%). 

So, 100 minutes * 0.40 = 40 minutes.

Then, Windows forces a restart to install updates, which takes 20 minutes. 

After the restart, Carla has to download the file from the beginning, which we've already calculated takes 100 minutes.

So, the total time to download the file, including the time before the interruption, the time for the updates, and the time to re-download the file, is 40 minutes (before interruption) + 20 minutes (updates) + 100 minutes (re-download) = 160 minutes.

Therefore, it takes Carla 160 minutes to download the file.
