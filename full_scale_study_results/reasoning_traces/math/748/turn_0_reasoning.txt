Question ID: 748
Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

Let's start by figuring out how many marbles Cal has. Since Sean has half as many marbles as Cal, that means Cal has twice as many marbles as Sean. 

So, Cal has 56 marbles * 2 = 112 marbles.

Next, let's figure out how many marbles Carl has. Since Carl has four times as many marbles as Sean, we multiply the number of marbles Sean has by 4.

So, Carl has 56 marbles * 4 = 224 marbles.

Finally, to find out how many marbles Carl and Cal have combined, we add the number of marbles Carl has to the number of marbles Cal has.

So, Carl and Cal have 224 marbles + 112 marbles = 336 marbles combined.

Therefore, Carl and Cal have 336 marbles combined.
