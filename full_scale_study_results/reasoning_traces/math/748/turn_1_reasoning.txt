Question ID: 748
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

Step 1: Determine the number of marbles Carl has.

Since Carl has four times as many marbles as Sean, and we know that Sean has 56 marbles, we can calculate the number of marbles Carl has by multiplying the number of marbles Sean has by 4.

Carl's marbles = 4 * Sean's marbles
Carl's marbles = 4 * 56
Carl's marbles = 224

So, Carl has 224 marbles.

Step 2: Determine the number of marbles Cal has.

Since Sean has half as many marbles as Cal, and we know that Sean has 56 marbles, we can calculate the number of marbles Cal has by multiplying the number of marbles Sean has by 2.

Cal's marbles = 2 * Sean's marbles
Cal's marbles = 2 * 56
Cal's marbles = 112

So, Cal has 112 marbles.

Step 3: Determine the total number of marbles Carl and Cal have combined.

We can calculate this by adding the number of marbles Carl has to the number of marbles Cal has.

Total marbles = Carl's marbles + Cal's marbles
Total marbles = 224 + 112
Total marbles = 336

So, Carl and Cal have a combined total of 336 marbles.
