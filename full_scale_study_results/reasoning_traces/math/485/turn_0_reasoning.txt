Dataset Type: math
==================================================

Let's denote the cost of Jillian's handbag as H and the cost of her shoes as S.

According to the problem, we know that:

H = 3S - 20

We also know from the problem that the cost of Jillian's shoes, S, is $80. 

So we can substitute S = $80 into the equation:

H = 3 * $80 - $20
H = $240 - $20
H = $220

So, Jillian's handbag cost $220.
