Question ID: 1180
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to find out how many gallons of milk had passed the expiry date. 

We know that Mr. Marcellus bought 4000 gallons of milk, and 2/5 of this amount was expired. 

To find out how many gallons were expired, we multiply the total amount of milk by 2/5:

4000 gallons * 2/5 = 1600 gallons

So, 1600 gallons of milk were expired.

Next, we need to find out how much money Mr. Marcellus should get in refunds. 

We know that each gallon of milk cost $3.5. 

To find out the total cost of the expired milk, we multiply the number of expired gallons by the cost per gallon:

1600 gallons * $3.5/gallon = $5600

So, Mr. Marcellus should get a refund of $5600.

Therefore, the company refunded Mr. Marcellus $5600 for the expired milk.
