Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to calculate the total cost of the milk that Mr. Marcellus purchased. 

The total cost is the number of gallons of milk times the cost per gallon. 

So, the total cost is 4000 gallons * $3.5/gallon = $14,000.

Next, we need to calculate the amount of milk that had passed the expiry date. 

This is 2/5 of the total amount of milk, which is 2/5 * 4000 gallons = 1600 gallons.

The cost of the expired milk is the number of gallons of expired milk times the cost per gallon. 

So, the cost of the expired milk is 1600 gallons * $3.5/gallon = $5,600.

Therefore, Mr. Marcellus got a refund of $5,600.
