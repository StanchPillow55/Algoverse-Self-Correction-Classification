Question ID: 1180
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to determine the total amount of milk that had expired. We know that Mr. Marcellus purchased 4000 gallons of milk and that 2/5 of this amount had expired. 

To find the amount of expired milk, we multiply the total amount of milk by 2/5:

4000 gallons * 2/5 = 1600 gallons

So, 1600 gallons of milk had expired.

Next, we need to calculate the total cost of the expired milk. We know that the cost of the milk is $3.5 per gallon. 

To find the total cost of the expired milk, we multiply the amount of expired milk by the cost per gallon:

1600 gallons * $3.5/gallon = $5600

So, the total cost of the expired milk is $5600.

This is the amount that Mr. Marcellus should be refunded by the company.

Therefore, Mr. Marcellus got $5600 in refunds.
