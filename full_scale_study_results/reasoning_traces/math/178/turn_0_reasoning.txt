==================================================

Let's solve this problem step by step.

First, we know that Bo has 40 crabs.

Second, we know that Monic has 4 fewer crabs than Bo. So, we subtract 4 from the number of crabs Bo has to find out how many crabs Monic has:

40 (Bo's crabs) - 4 = 36 crabs (Monic's crabs)

Third, we know that Rani has ten more crabs than Monic. So, we add 10 to the number of crabs Monic has to find out how many crabs Rani has:

36 (Monic's crabs) + 10 = 46 crabs (Rani's crabs)

Finally, to find out the total number of crabs the three have together, we add the number of crabs each person has:

40 (Bo's crabs) + 36 (Monic's crabs) + 46 (Rani's crabs) = 122 crabs

So, the three of them together have 122 crabs.
