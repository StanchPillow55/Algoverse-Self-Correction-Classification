==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to determine how many crabs each person has based on the relationships given in the problem.

1. **Determine how many crabs Bo has:**
   - According to the problem, Bo has 40 crabs.
   \[
   \text{Bo's crabs} = 40
   \]

2. **Determine how many crabs Monic has:**
   - The problem states that Monic has 4 fewer crabs than Bo. Therefore, we can calculate Monic's crabs as follows:
   \[
   \text{Monic's crabs} = \text{Bo's crabs} - 4 = 40 - 4 = 36
   \]

3. **Determine how many crabs Rani has:**
   - The problem also states that Rani has ten more crabs than Monic. Thus, we can calculate Rani's crabs as follows:
   \[
   \text{Rani's crabs} = \text{Monic's crabs} + 10 = 36 + 10 = 46
   \]

4. **Calculate the total number of crabs:**
   - Now, we can find the total number of crabs that Rani, Monic, and Bo have together by adding their individual amounts:
   \[
   \text{Total crabs} = \text{Rani's crabs} + \text{Monic's crabs} + \text{Bo's crabs}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total crabs} = 46 + 36 + 40
   \]

5. **Perform the addition:**
   - First, add Rani's and Monic's crabs:
   \[
   46 + 36 = 82
   \]
   - Next, add Bo's crabs to this sum:
   \[
   82 + 40 = 122
   \]

Thus, the total number of crabs that Rani, Monic, and Bo have together is:
\[
\boxed{122}
\]
