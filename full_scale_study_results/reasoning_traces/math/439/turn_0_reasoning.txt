Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

The problem states that the drive from Bernadette's apartment takes four times as long as the drive from Wayne's hotel. Given that it takes Wayne four minutes to be driven to the theater, this means that it takes Bernadette 4 * 4 = <<4*4=16>>16 minutes to be driven to the theater.

Bernadette wants to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne. This means that she needs to leave her apartment 5 minutes before Wayne leaves his hotel. However, since her drive is longer, she needs to leave even earlier to account for this.

The difference in their drive times is 16 minutes (Bernadette's drive) - 4 minutes (Wayne's drive) = 12 minutes.

Therefore, Bernadette should leave 12 minutes (to account for the longer drive) + 5 minutes (to arrive before Wayne) = 17 minutes earlier than Wayne.

So, the final answer is: Bernadette should leave 17 minutes earlier than Wayne.
