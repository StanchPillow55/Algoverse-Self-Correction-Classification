To solve the problem, we need to determine how much earlier Bernadette should leave compared to Wayne, given the time it takes each of them to reach the premiere theater.

1. **Determine Wayne's travel time:**
   - Wayne takes 4 minutes to be driven to the theater.

2. **Determine Bernadette's travel time:**
   - According to the problem, the drive from Bernadette’s apartment takes four times as long as the drive from Wayne’s hotel.
   - Therefore, Bernadette's travel time is:
     \[
     \text{Bernadette's time} = 4 \times \text{Wayne's time} = 4 \times 4 \text{ minutes} = 16 \text{ minutes}
     \]

3. **Determine the time difference for their arrivals:**
   - Bernadette wants to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne. Since Wayne takes 4 minutes to arrive, he will arrive at:
     \[
     \text{Wayne's arrival time} = 0 \text{ minutes} + 4 \text{ minutes} = 4 \text{ minutes}
     \]
   - To find out when Bernadette needs to arrive, we subtract 5 minutes from Wayne's arrival time:
     \[
     \text{Bernadette's desired arrival time} = 4 \text{ minutes} - 5 \text{ minutes} = -1 \text{ minute}
     \]
   - This means Bernadette needs to arrive at the theater by -1 minute, which is equivalent to arriving 1 minute before the premiere starts (assuming the premiere starts at 0 minutes).

4. **Calculate when Bernadette needs to leave:**
   - Since Bernadette takes 16 minutes to get to the theater, she needs to leave 16 minutes before her desired arrival time of -1 minute:
     \[
     \text{Bernadette's departure time} = -1 \text{ minute} - 16 \text{ minutes} = -17 \text{ minutes}
     \]

5. **Calculate when Wayne needs to leave:**
   - Wayne leaves 4 minutes before the premiere starts, so he leaves at:
     \[
     \text{Wayne's departure time} = 0 \text{ minutes} - 4 \text{ minutes} = -4 \text{ minutes}
     \]

6. **Determine how much earlier Bernadette should leave than Wayne:**
   - To find out how much earlier Bernadette should leave than Wayne, we calculate the difference between their departure times:
     \[
     \text{Difference} = \text{Bernadette's departure time} - \text{Wayne's departure time} = -17 \text{ minutes} - (-4 \text{ minutes}) = -17 + 4 = -13 \text{ minutes}
     \]

Thus, Bernadette should leave **13 minutes earlier** than Wayne.

**Final Answer: Bernadette should leave 13 minutes earlier than Wayne.**
