==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to determine how much earlier Bernadette should leave than Wayne in order to arrive at the premiere 5 minutes before him.

1. **Determine Wayne's travel time:**
   - Wayne takes 4 minutes to be driven to the theater.

2. **Determine Bernadette's travel time:**
   - The problem states that the drive from Bernadetteâ€™s apartment takes four times as long as the drive from Wayneâ€™s hotel.
   - Therefore, Bernadette's travel time is:
     \[
     \text{Bernadette's travel time} = 4 \times \text{Wayne's travel time} = 4 \times 4 \text{ minutes} = 16 \text{ minutes}
     \]

3. **Calculate the time difference needed:**
   - Bernadette wants to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne. Since Wayne takes 4 minutes to arrive, we can calculate the time Bernadette needs to leave to arrive at the theater 5 minutes before Wayne.
   - Wayne's arrival time at the theater is:
     \[
     \text{Wayne's arrival time} = 0 \text{ minutes} + 4 \text{ minutes} = 4 \text{ minutes}
     \]
   - To arrive 5 minutes before Wayne, Bernadette needs to arrive at:
     \[
     \text{Bernadette's desired arrival time} = 4 \text{ minutes} - 5 \text{ minutes} = -1 \text{ minute}
     \]
   - Since arriving at -1 minute is not possible, we interpret this as Bernadette needing to arrive at the theater at 0 minutes (the start of the event).

4. **Calculate when Bernadette needs to leave:**
   - To arrive at the theater at 0 minutes, Bernadette needs to leave her apartment 16 minutes before 0 minutes (since it takes her 16 minutes to get there).
   - Therefore, Bernadette should leave at:
     \[
     0 \text{ minutes} - 16 \text{ minutes} = -16 \text{ minutes}
     \]

5. **Determine how much earlier Bernadette should leave than Wayne:**
   - Wayne leaves at 0 minutes and arrives at 4 minutes.
   - Bernadette leaves at -16 minutes and arrives at 0 minutes.
   - The difference in their departure times is:
     \[
     \text{Difference} = 0 \text{ minutes} - (-16 \text{ minutes}) = 16 \text{ minutes}
     \]

Thus, Bernadette should leave **16 minutes earlier** than Wayne to arrive at the premiere 5 minutes before him.

**Final Answer: Bernadette should leave 16 minutes earlier than Wayne.**
