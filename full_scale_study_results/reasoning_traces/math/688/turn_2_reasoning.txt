Question ID: 688
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to convert the hours John has before dinner into minutes, since the time he spends on his homework is given in minutes. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 3 hours is 3 * 60 = 180 minutes.

Next, we add up the time John spends on his homework. He spends 20 minutes on math, 40 minutes on reading, and 20 minutes on history. So, the total time spent on homework is 20 + 40 + 20 = 80 minutes.

To find out how much time John has to nap, we subtract the time he spends on his homework from the time he has before dinner. So, 180 minutes - 80 minutes = 100 minutes.

Therefore, John has 100 minutes to nap.
