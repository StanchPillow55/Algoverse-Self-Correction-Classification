Question ID: 688
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to convert the 3 hours John has before dinner into minutes because the time for his homework is given in minutes. We know that 1 hour is equal to 60 minutes. Therefore, 3 hours is equal to 3 * 60 = 180 minutes.

Next, we need to add up the total time John needs to complete his homework. He has 20 minutes of math homework, 40 minutes of reading homework, and 20 minutes of history homework. So, the total time for homework is 20 + 40 + 20 = 80 minutes.

To find out how much time John has left to nap, we subtract the total time for homework from the total time before dinner. Therefore, John has 180 - 80 = 100 minutes to nap.

So, John has 100 minutes to nap before he has to eat dinner.
