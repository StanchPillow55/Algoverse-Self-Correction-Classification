Question ID: 688
Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to convert the 3 hours John has before dinner into minutes because the time for his homework is given in minutes. We know that 1 hour is equal to 60 minutes, so 3 hours is equal to 3 * 60 = 180 minutes.

Next, we need to add up the total time John needs to complete his homework. He has 20 minutes of math homework, 40 minutes of reading homework, and 20 minutes of history homework. So, the total time for his homework is 20 + 40 + 20 = 80 minutes.

Now, we subtract the total time for his homework from the total time he has before dinner to find out how much time he has left to nap. So, 180 minutes - 80 minutes = 100 minutes.

Therefore, John has 100 minutes to nap.
