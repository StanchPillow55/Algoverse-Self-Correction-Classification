==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to understand the information provided in the paragraph and use it to determine the type of terrain found south of central Illinois.

Given information:
- Central Illinois is described as a flat, featureless landscape that can be seen for miles.
- In southern Illinois, the landscape changes to rolling hills.
- The paragraph mentions that there are no big rivers that could have eroded and deposited the material to create the rolling hills.
- The ground in southern Illinois is capable of supporting grass and trees, so wind erosion would not explain the formation of the rolling hills.
- The paragraph states that around 12,000 years ago, a massive ice sheet, called a glacier, covered much of the Midwest, including the area around Springfield, Illinois.

Reasoning:
The paragraph suggests that the rolling hills in southern Illinois were formed by the presence of the glacier that covered the region around 12,000 years ago. Glaciers are large masses of flowing ice that can shape the landscape as they move.

When a glacier moves, it can erode and transport large amounts of rock, soil, and other materials. As the glacier melts and retreats, it deposits these materials, creating features
