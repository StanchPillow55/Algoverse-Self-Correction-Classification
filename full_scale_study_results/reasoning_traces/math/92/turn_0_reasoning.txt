Question ID: 92
Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

Let's start by figuring out the ages of the kids one by one.

First, we know that James is 10 years old.

Second, since James is 1 year younger than Corey, that means Corey is 10 + 1 = 11 years old.

Third, since Amy is 2 years younger than Corey, that means Amy is 11 - 2 = 9 years old.

Finally, since Amy is 5 years older than Jackson, that means Jackson is 9 - 5 = 4 years old.

So, Jackson is 4 years old.
