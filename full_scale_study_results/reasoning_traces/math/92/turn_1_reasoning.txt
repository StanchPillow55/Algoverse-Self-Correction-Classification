Question ID: 92
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to determine the ages of each child based on the relationships given in the problem. Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Identify Corey's Age:**
   - We know that James is 10 years old and is 1 year younger than Corey.
   - Therefore, Corey's age is \(10 + 1 = 11\) years old.

2. **Determine Amy's Age:**
   - Amy is 2 years younger than Corey.
   - Since Corey is 11 years old, Amy's age is \(11 - 2 = 9\) years old.

3. **Determine Jackson's Age:**
   - Amy is 5 years older than Jackson.
   - Since Amy is 9 years old, Jackson's age is \(9 - 5 = 4\) years old.

By following these steps, we have determined the ages of all the children based on the relationships provided. 

The final answer is that Jackson is 4 years old.
