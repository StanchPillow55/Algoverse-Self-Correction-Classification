Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to determine the total number of hours John spent in physical therapy. 

He went twice a week for 6 weeks, so that's 2 visits/week * 6 weeks = 12 visits. 

Each visit was 2 hours long, so that's 12 visits * 2 hours/visit = 24 hours. 

Now, we know that each hour of physical therapy costs $125. So, to find the total cost, we multiply the total number of hours by the cost per hour. 

That's 24 hours * $125/hour = $3000. 

So, John's physical therapy cost $3000 in total.
