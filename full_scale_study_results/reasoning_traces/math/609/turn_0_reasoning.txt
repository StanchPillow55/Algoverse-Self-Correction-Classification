Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to determine how many dozens of croissants Juan wants to make in a week. We know that he wants to make 4 dozen a day, and there are 7 days in a week. So, we multiply 4 dozens by 7 to find the total number of dozens he wants to make in a week:

4 dozens/day * 7 days/week = 28 dozens/week

Next, we need to determine how much butter Juan needs for each dozen of croissants. We know that it takes 1/4 pound of butter to make 1 dozen croissants. So, we multiply the total number of dozens by the amount of butter needed for each dozen:

28 dozens/week * 1/4 pound/dozen = 7 pounds/week

Therefore, Juan will need 7 pounds of butter to make 4 dozen croissants a day for a week.
