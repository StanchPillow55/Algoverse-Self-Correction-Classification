Question ID: 609
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to determine how many dozens of croissants Juan wants to make in a week. Since he plans to make 4 dozen a day for 7 days, we multiply 4 by 7 to get 28 dozen.

Next, we need to calculate how much butter is needed for 28 dozen croissants. Since it takes 1/4 pound of butter to make 1 dozen croissants, we multiply 28 by 1/4 to find the total amount of butter needed.

28 * 1/4 = 7

So, Juan will need 7 pounds of butter to make 4 dozen croissants a day for a week.
