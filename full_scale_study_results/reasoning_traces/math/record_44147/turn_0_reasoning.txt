To solve this problem, we need to fill in the missing word in the given query. Based on the context provided in the passage, the missing word is likely "U.S." or "coalition".

Let's go through the reasoning step-by-step:

1. The passage discusses the Taliban's momentum in Afghanistan and the difficulty in negotiating with them.
2. It mentions that the U.S. defense secretary, Robert Gates, is visiting Afghanistan to meet with troops and assess the situation.
3. The passage states that the Taliban have had "mostly free rein in that area with few @placeholder or coalition forces to confront them until now."
4. The missing word in the query is likely "U.S." or "coalition" because the passage is discussing the U.S. and coalition forces in Afghanistan.
5. The passage suggests that the Taliban have had an advantage in the area due to the lack of U.S. or coalition forces to confront them until recently.

Therefore, the final answer to the query is:

The Taliban have had mostly free rein in that area with few U.S. or coalition forces to confront them until now.
