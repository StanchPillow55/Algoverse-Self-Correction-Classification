To solve this problem, we need to determine the appropriate word or phrase to fill in the @placeholder in the given query.

Given information:
- The Taliban have had mostly free rein in the area with few coalition forces to confront them until now.
- The query states that the Taliban have had mostly free rein in that area with few @placeholder or coalition forces to confront them until now.

Based on the context, the missing word or phrase should describe the type of forces that were lacking in the area, allowing the Taliban to have free rein.

Possible options:
1. U.S.
2. American
3. NATO

To determine the best fit, let's consider the reasoning and context:
- The passage mentions the U.S. defense secretary, Robert Gates, and his comments on the Taliban's momentum in Afghanistan.
- The passage also mentions that the U.S. is trying to reach out to the Taliban and that U.S. forces are building up in southern Afghanistan.

Therefore, the most appropriate word to fill the @placeholder is "U.S." as it best fits the context of the passage and the query.

Final answer:
The Taliban have had mostly free r
