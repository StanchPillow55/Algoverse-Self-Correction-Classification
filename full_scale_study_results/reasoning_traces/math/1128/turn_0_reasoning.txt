Let's denote Vince's current age as V.

According to the problem, two years ago, Liam was twice as old as Vince. So, we can write this relationship as:

Liam's age two years ago = 2 * Vince's age two years ago

We know that Liam is currently 16 years old, so two years ago, he was 16 - 2 = 14 years old.

Therefore, we can substitute Liam's age two years ago into the equation:

14 = 2 * Vince's age two years ago

To find Vince's age two years ago, we divide both sides of the equation by 2:

14 / 2 = Vince's age two years ago

Vince was 7 years old two years ago.

To find Vince's current age, we add 2 years to his age two years ago:

7 + 2 = V

So, Vince is 9 years old now.

Final Answer: Vince is 9 years old.
