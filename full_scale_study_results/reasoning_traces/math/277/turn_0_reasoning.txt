==================================================

First, we need to calculate the total time it takes Matthew to dig the small holes and the large holes separately.

For the small holes, it takes Matthew 3 minutes to dig one hole. So, for 30 small holes, it would take him 3 minutes/hole * 30 holes = 90 minutes.

For the large holes, it takes Matthew 10 minutes to dig one hole. So, for 15 large holes, it would take him 10 minutes/hole * 15 holes = 150 minutes.

To find the total time Matthew spends digging, we add the time it takes him to dig the small holes and the large holes together. So, 90 minutes + 150 minutes = 240 minutes.

Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we need to convert the total time from minutes to hours. We do this by dividing the total time in minutes by the number of minutes in an hour. So, 240 minutes รท 60 minutes/hour = 4 hours.

Therefore, it will take Matthew 4 hours to dig 30 small holes and 15 large holes.
