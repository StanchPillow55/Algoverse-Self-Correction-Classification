Question ID: 277
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to calculate the total time it takes Matthew to dig small and large holes separately.

For the small holes, it takes Matthew 3 minutes to dig one hole. Therefore, to dig 30 small holes, it will take him 3 minutes/hole * 30 holes = 90 minutes.

For the large holes, it takes Matthew 10 minutes to dig one hole. Therefore, to dig 15 large holes, it will take him 10 minutes/hole * 15 holes = 150 minutes.

To find the total time Matthew spends digging, we add the time it takes him to dig the small holes and the large holes together. So, 90 minutes + 150 minutes = 240 minutes.

However, the problem asks for the answer in hours, not minutes. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we divide the total minutes by 60 to convert it to hours.

So, 240 minutes รท 60 = 4 hours.

Therefore, it will take Matthew 4 hours to dig 30 small holes and 15 large holes.
