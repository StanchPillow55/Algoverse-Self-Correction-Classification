Question ID: 277
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to calculate the total time it takes Matthew to dig one small hole and one large hole. 

The time it takes to dig a small hole is 3 minutes and the time it takes to dig a large hole is 10 minutes. 

Next, we need to calculate the total time it takes to dig 30 small holes and 15 large holes. 

To find the total time for the small holes, we multiply the time it takes to dig one small hole by the number of small holes:

3 minutes/small hole * 30 small holes = 90 minutes

To find the total time for the large holes, we multiply the time it takes to dig one large hole by the number of large holes:

10 minutes/large hole * 15 large holes = 150 minutes

Now, we add these two times together to find the total time:

90 minutes + 150 minutes = 240 minutes

Finally, we need to convert this time from minutes to hours, since the problem asks for the answer in hours. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so we divide the total time by 60:

240 minutes รท 60 = 4 hours

So, it will take Matthew 4 hours to dig 30 small holes and 15 large holes.
