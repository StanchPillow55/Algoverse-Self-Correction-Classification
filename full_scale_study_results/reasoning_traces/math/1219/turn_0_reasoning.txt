==================================================

First, we need to calculate how much Ali has to pay for the tables. 

John manufactured 4 tables for $20 each. So, the total cost of the tables is 4 tables * $20/table = $80.

Next, we need to calculate how much Ali has to pay for the roof frames.

John manufactured 2 roof frames for $10 each. So, the total cost of the roof frames is 2 frames * $10/frame = $20.

Finally, to find out how much Ali has to pay John in total, we need to add the cost of the tables and the roof frames together.

So, the total cost is $80 (for the tables) + $20 (for the roof frames) = $100.

Therefore, Ali has to pay John $100.
