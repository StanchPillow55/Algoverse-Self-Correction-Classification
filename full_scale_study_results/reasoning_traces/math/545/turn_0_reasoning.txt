Dataset Type: math
==================================================

Jeff's work is 3 miles away, so he walks 3 miles to get there. But he also has to walk back home, which is another 3 miles. So, in total, he walks 3 miles to work + 3 miles back home = 6 miles each day he works.

If he works 5 times a week, then in a week he walks 5 days * 6 miles each day = 30 miles.

So, Jeff walks 30 miles in a week if he works 5 times a week. 

Final Answer: Jeff walks 30 miles in a week.
