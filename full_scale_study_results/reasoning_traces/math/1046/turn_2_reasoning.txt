Question ID: 1046
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of hours each painter worked over the course of 3 weeks, given that they worked for \( \frac{3}{8} \) of a day each day.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Determine the number of days worked:**

   - There are 7 days in a week.
   - The painters worked for 3 weeks.
   - Therefore, the total number of days worked is:
     \[
     3 \text{ weeks} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 21 \text{ days}
     \]

2. **Calculate the total hours worked per day:**

   - A full day consists of 24 hours.
   - The painters worked \( \frac{3}{8} \) of a day each day.
   - Therefore, the number of hours worked per day is:
     \[
     \frac{3}{8} \times 24 \text{ hours} = 9 \text{ hours}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total hours worked by the team over 3 weeks:**

   - The team worked 9 hours each day for 21 days.
   - Therefore, the total number of hours worked by the team is:
     \[
     9 \text{ hours/day} \times 21 \text{ days} = 189 \text{ hours}
     \]

4. **Determine the hours worked by each painter:**

   - There are 4 painters on the team.
   - The total hours worked by the team is 189 hours.
   - Therefore, the total number of hours worked by each painter is:
     \[
     \frac{189 \text{ hours}}{4 \text{ painters}} = 47.25 \text{ hours}
     \]

Thus, each painter worked a total of 47.25 hours over the 3 weeks.

**Final Answer:**
Each painter put in 47.25 hours of work.
