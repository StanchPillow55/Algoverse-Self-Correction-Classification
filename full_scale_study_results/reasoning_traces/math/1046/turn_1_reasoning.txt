Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine how many hours each painter worked over the course of 3 weeks, given that they worked for 3/8ths of a day each day.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Determine the Total Number of Days Worked:**
   - There are 7 days in a week.
   - The painters worked for 3 weeks.
   - Therefore, the total number of days worked is:
     \[
     3 \text{ weeks} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 21 \text{ days}
     \]

2. **Calculate the Total Hours Worked Per Day:**
   - A full day is typically considered to be 24 hours.
   - The painters worked for 3/8ths of a day each day.
   - Therefore, the total hours worked per day is:
     \[
     \frac{3}{8} \times 24 \text{ hours} = 9 \text{ hours}
     \]

3. **Calculate the Total Hours Worked by the Team Over 3 Weeks:**
   - The team worked 9 hours per day for 21 days.
   - Therefore, the total hours worked by the team is:
     \[
     9 \text{ hours/day} \times 21 \text{ days} = 189 \text{ hours}
     \]

4. **Determine the Hours Worked by Each Painter:**
   - There are 4 painters on the team.
   - The total hours worked by the team is 189 hours.
   - Therefore, the total hours worked by each painter is:
     \[
     \frac{189 \text{ hours}}{4 \text{ painters}} = 47.25 \text{ hours}
     \]

### Final Answer:
Each painter worked 47.25 hours over the course of 3 weeks.
