Question ID: 1046
Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, let's determine the total number of days the painters worked. 

There are 7 days in a week, so over the course of 3 weeks, the painters worked for 7 * 3 = 21 days.

Next, we need to figure out how many hours they worked each day. There are 24 hours in a day, so if they worked for 3/8ths of a day, they worked for 24 * 3/8 = 9 hours each day.

So, over the course of 21 days, each painter worked for 21 * 9 = 189 hours.

Since there are 4 painters, the total hours worked by all painters is 189 * 4 = 756 hours.

However, the question asks for the number of hours each painter worked, so we need to divide the total hours by the number of painters. 

So, each painter worked for 756 / 4 = 189 hours.

Therefore, each painter worked for 189 hours.
