Dataset Type: math
==================================================

Let's start by finding the age of Dora's father. According to the problem, Dora's father's age is eight more than twice Dora's age. Since Dora is 15 years old, twice her age would be 2*15 = 30 years. Adding eight to this gives us 30+8 = 38 years. So, Dora's father is 38 years old.

Next, we find the age of Dora's mother. The problem states that Dora's mother is four years younger than Dora's father. Since Dora's father is 38 years old, Dora's mother would be 38-4 = 34 years old.

Finally, we find the total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother by adding their ages together. This gives us 15 (Dora's age) + 38 (Dora's father's age) + 34 (Dora's mother's age) = 87 years.

So, the total combined age of Dora, her father, and her mother is 87 years.
