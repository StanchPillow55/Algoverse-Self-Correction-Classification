Question ID: 581
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we first need to convert all the times to the same unit. Since the question asks for the total time in minutes, we'll convert the hours to minutes.

First, let's convert the length of the first movie to minutes. We know that 1 hour is equal to 60 minutes. So, the first movie, which is 1 hour and 30 minutes long, is equivalent to:

1 hour * 60 minutes/hour + 30 minutes = 60 minutes + 30 minutes = 90 minutes

Next, we'll convert the length of the second movie to minutes. The second movie is 2 hours and 5 minutes long, which is equivalent to:

2 hours * 60 minutes/hour + 5 minutes = 120 minutes + 5 minutes = 125 minutes

Now, to find the total time Max will spend watching the two movies, we simply add the lengths of the two movies together:

90 minutes (first movie) + 125 minutes (second movie) = 215 minutes

So, it will take Max 215 minutes to watch the two movies.
