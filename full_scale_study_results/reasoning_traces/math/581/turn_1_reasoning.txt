Question ID: 581
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to convert the length of each movie from hours and minutes into just minutes.

For the first movie, we know that 1 hour is equivalent to 60 minutes. So, 1 hour and 30 minutes is the same as 60 minutes + 30 minutes = 90 minutes.

For the second movie, we know that 2 hours is equivalent to 120 minutes. So, 2 hours and 5 minutes is the same as 120 minutes + 5 minutes = 125 minutes.

Now that we have the length of each movie in minutes, we can add these together to find the total time Max will spend watching movies.

So, 90 minutes (first movie) + 125 minutes (second movie) = 215 minutes.

Therefore, Max will spend 215 minutes watching the two movies.
