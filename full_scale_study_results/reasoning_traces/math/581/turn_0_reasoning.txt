==================================================

First, we need to convert the length of the movies from hours and minutes into just minutes. 

For the first movie, we know that 1 hour is equal to 60 minutes. Therefore, 1 hour and 30 minutes is equal to 60 minutes + 30 minutes = 90 minutes.

For the second movie, we know that 2 hours is equal to 120 minutes. Therefore, 2 hours and 5 minutes is equal to 120 minutes + 5 minutes = 125 minutes.

To find the total time Max will spend watching the two movies, we add the length of the two movies together. 

So, 90 minutes (first movie) + 125 minutes (second movie) = 215 minutes.

Therefore, it will take Max 215 minutes to watch the two movies.
