To solve this problem, we need to carefully read the paragraph and identify the relevant information about the Salt March and its consequences.

The paragraph states:
"Advocating civil disobedience, he led his famous Salt March to the sea, to scoop up salt and circumvent the hated British salt tax. This put more than 60,000 in jail."

3. Concluded that the consequence of the Salt March was the arrest of over 60,000 people, not that they
