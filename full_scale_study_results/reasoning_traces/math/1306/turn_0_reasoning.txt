==================================================

Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we need to figure out how many of each item Igor actually gathered.

Dr. Grumpus requested 16 test tubes, but Igor gathered half as many. So, Igor gathered 16 / 2 = <<16/2=8>>8 test tubes.

Dr. Grumpus requested 14 Petri dishes, but Igor gathered two more than this. So, Igor gathered 14 + 2 = <<14+2=16>>16 Petri dishes.

Dr. Grumpus requested 7 beakers, and while we know Igor lost some, we don't know how many he actually placed on the bench. So, let's call this number B.

The total number of items Igor placed on the bench was 29. So, we can set up the following equation to solve for B:

8 (test tubes) + 16 (Petri dishes) + B (beakers) = 29

Solving for B, we get:

B = 29 - 8 - 16 = 5

So, Igor placed 5 beakers on the bench. But we know that Dr. Grumpus originally requested 7 beakers. So, Igor must have lost 7 - 5 = 2 beakers.

Therefore, Igor lost 2 beakers.
