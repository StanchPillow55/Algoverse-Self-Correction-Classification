Question ID: 1306
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

Let's start by figuring out how many of each item Igor actually gathered.

Dr. Grumpus asked for 16 test tubes, but Igor only gathered half of that amount. Half of 16 is 8, so Igor gathered 8 test tubes.

Dr. Grumpus asked for 14 Petri dishes, and Igor gathered two more than that. 14 + 2 equals 16, so Igor gathered 16 Petri dishes.

Dr. Grumpus asked for 7 beakers, and while we don't know how many Igor lost, we do know that he picked up the correct amount initially. So, Igor initially picked up 7 beakers.

Now, let's add up the total number of items Igor gathered: 8 test tubes + 16 Petri dishes + 7 beakers equals 31 items.

However, we know that Igor only placed 29 items on the lab bench. So, if we subtract the total number of items on the bench from the total number of items Igor gathered, we can figure out how many beakers Igor lost.

31 total items gathered - 29 total items on the bench equals 2 lost beakers.

So, Igor lost 2 beakers.
