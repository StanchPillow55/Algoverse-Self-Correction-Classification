Question ID: multirc_19524
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, I will go through the details provided in the paragraph step-by-step:

1. Duryodhana gains animosity towards the kingdom of Gandhara, where the king (the father of his mother Gandhari) rules.
2. Duryodhana attacks Gandhara and lays waste of the whole kingdom.
3. He then imprisons the royal family in his prison.
4. He gives them only one rice grain per prisoner.
5. The king of Gandhara then stops everyone from grabbing the little food that is provided, and says that instead of everyone dying, they could keep at least one of their princes alive.
6. The king chooses Sakuni to be alive.

Based on the information provided, the paragraph does not state that Duryodhana killed all the members of the Gandhara royal family. Instead, it says that Duryodhana imprisoned the royal family and gave them only one rice grain per prisoner. The king then chose to keep Sakuni alive, while the rest of the royal family died in prison due to starvation.

Therefore, the correct answer is:
