==================================================

First, let's calculate the total number of letters in the words that Craig has spelled out. Since each word has 15 letters and he has spelled out 20 words, the total number of letters in Craig's words is 15 * 20 = 300 letters.

Craig's brother has spelled out words with a total count of letters 50 more than Craig. This means Craig's brother has spelled out 300 + 50 = 350 letters.

The total number of letters in the words they've spelled after the ten rounds is the sum of the number of letters in Craig's words and his brother's words. This is 300 letters + 350 letters = 650 letters.

So, the total number of letters in the words they've spelled after the ten rounds is 650 letters.
