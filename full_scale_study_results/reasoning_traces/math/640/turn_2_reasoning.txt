Question ID: 640
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To find the total cost of Bill's new truck, we need to add up the cost of the base truck and all the extra features.

The base price of the truck is $30,000.

The king cab upgrade is an extra $7,500.

The cost of the leather seats is one-third the cost of the king cab upgrade. So, we calculate this as:
$7,500 / 3 = $2,500

The running boards are $500 less than the leather seats. So, we calculate this as:
$2,500 - $500 = $2,000

The upgraded exterior light package is $1,500.

Now, we add up all these costs to find the total cost of the truck:
$30,000 (base price) + $7,500 (king cab) + $2,500 (leather seats) + $2,000 (running boards) + $1,500 (light package) = $43,500

So, the total cost of Bill's new truck is $43,500.
