==================================================

The first step is to calculate the cost of the leather seats. Since they are one-third the cost of the king cab upgrade, we multiply the cost of the king cab upgrade by 1/3:

$7,500 * 1/3 = $2,500

Next, we calculate the cost of the running boards. Since they are $500 less than the leather seats, we subtract $500 from the cost of the leather seats:

$2,500 - $500 = $2,000

Now we have the cost of all the added features: the king cab upgrade ($7,500), the leather seats ($2,500), the running boards ($2,000), and the upgraded exterior light package ($1,500). To find the total cost of the added features, we add these amounts together:

$7,500 + $2,500 + $2,000 + $1,500 = $13,500

Finally, to find the total cost of the truck, we add the cost of the added features to the base price of the truck:

$30,000 + $13,500 = $43,500

So, the total cost of Bill's new truck is $43,500.
