Question ID: 640
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, let's calculate the cost of each additional feature:

- The king cab upgrade is $7,500.
- The leather seats are one-third the cost of the king cab upgrade, so they cost $7,500 / 3 = $2,500.
- The running boards are $500 less than the leather seats, so they cost $2,500 - $500 = $2,000.
- The upgraded exterior light package is $1,500.

Now, we can add up the cost of the truck and all the features:

- The base price of the truck is $30,000.
- The king cab upgrade is $7,500.
- The leather seats are $2,500.
- The running boards are $2,000.
- The upgraded exterior light package is $1,500.

So, the total cost of Bill's new truck is $30,000 + $7,500 + $2,500 + $2,000 + $1,500 = $43,500. 

Therefore, the total cost of Bill's new truck, in dollars, is $43,500.
