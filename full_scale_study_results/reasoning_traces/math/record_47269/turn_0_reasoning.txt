==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given passage and the query to understand the context and the underlying mathematical concepts involved.

Given information:
- Mitt Romney made two references to "47 percent" in a fundraising event.
- Romney also suggested that President Barack Obama "starts off with 48, 49."
- The passage suggests that the "47 percent" figure may not be referring to the number of Americans who don't pay federal income taxes.

Step 2: Analyze the query.
The query suggests that "sweeping generalizations" like the "47 percent" figure are often a "path into political quicksand." This implies that the use of such broad generalizations can
