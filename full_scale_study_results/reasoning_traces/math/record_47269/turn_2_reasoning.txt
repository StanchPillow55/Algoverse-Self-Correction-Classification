==================================================

To solve this problem, I will break it down step-by-step:

1. Understand the context of the passage:
The passage discusses Mitt Romney's comments about the "47%" of Americans who do not pay federal income taxes. It suggests that Romney's use of the "47%" figure may not be referring to the statistic about who pays federal income taxes, but rather to the president's most loyal base.

2. Analyze the query:
The query suggests that "such sweeping generalizations as those used by @placeholder are often a path into political quicksand." This implies that the passage is making a generalization that should be avoided.

3. Provide a response:
I agree with the query's assessment. The passage seems to be making a generalization about Romney's use of the "47%" figure, which may not be accurate. While a healthy debate about government programs and priorities is important, making broad generalizations can lead to political controversy and division.

To provide a more complete response, I will walk through the reasoning step-by-step:

a) The passage suggests that Romney's first reference to "47 percent" may not be referring to the statistic about who pays federal income taxes
