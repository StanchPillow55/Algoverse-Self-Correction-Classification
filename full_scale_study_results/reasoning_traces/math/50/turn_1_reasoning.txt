Question ID: 50
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

Step 1: Calculate the number of eggs produced in a week.

Lloyd's chickens produce 252 eggs per day. So, in a week (7 days), they would produce:

252 eggs/day * 7 days/week = 1764 eggs/week

Step 2: Convert the number of eggs into dozens.

Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, the number of dozens of eggs produced in a week is:

1764 eggs/week รท 12 eggs/dozen = 147 dozens/week

Step 3: Calculate the total earnings from selling the eggs.

Lloyd sells a dozen of eggs for $2. Therefore, his earnings from selling 147 dozens of eggs would be:

147 dozens/week * $2/dozen = $294/week

So, Lloyd makes $294 on eggs per week.
