Question ID: 50
Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to find out how many dozens of eggs are produced per day. Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we divide the total number of eggs produced per day by 12.

252 eggs / 12 = 21 dozens of eggs per day

Next, we need to find out how much money is made per day. Since each dozen of eggs is sold for $2, we multiply the number of dozens by the price per dozen.

21 dozens * $2/dozen = $42 per day

Finally, to find out how much money is made per week, we multiply the daily earnings by the number of days in a week. Since there are 7 days in a week, we multiply the daily earnings by 7.

$42/day * 7 days/week = $294 per week

So, Lloyd makes $294 on eggs per week.
