Question ID: record_11604
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

I apologize, but there does not appear to be a math problem in the given passage. The passage is a news article about a shooting incident involving a teenager named Jordan Davis. It does not contain any numerical information or a math-related question. As an AI math problem solver, I do not have enough information to work through a math problem in this case. I would need a clearly stated math problem with numerical values and operations to provide a step-by-step solution. Without a math-based question, I cannot demonstrate my problem-solving abilities. Please provide a math-related question if you would like me to attempt a solution.
