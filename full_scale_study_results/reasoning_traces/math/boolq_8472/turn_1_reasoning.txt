Question ID: boolq_8472
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To determine if the Chicago Blackhawks made the NHL playoffs, we need to consider the following information:

1. The Blackhawks were under the control of Rocky Wirtz starting in 2007.
2. Under Rocky Wirtz's leadership, the Blackhawks won the Stanley Cup three times within six seasons, from 2010 to 2015.

The Stanley Cup is awarded to the champion of the NHL playoffs, so the fact that the Blackhawks won the Stanley Cup three times during that period indicates that they must have made the playoffs in those years.

Therefore, the final answer is:

Yes, the Chicago Blackhawks made the NHL playoffs during the period from 2010 to 2015, as evidenced by their three Stanley Cup championships won within that six-year span.
