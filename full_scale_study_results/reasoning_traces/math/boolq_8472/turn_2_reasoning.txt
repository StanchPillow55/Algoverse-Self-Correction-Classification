==================================================

To determine if the Chicago Blackhawks made the NHL playoffs, we need to consider the following information:

1. The Blackhawks won the Stanley Cup three times within six seasons from 2010 to 2015, under the ownership of Rocky Wirtz.
2. Making the playoffs is a prerequisite for winning the Stanley Cup.

Therefore, the reasoning is as follows:

1. The Blackhawks won the Stanley Cup three times from 2010 to 2015.
2. To win the Stanley Cup, a team must first make the NHL playoffs.
3. Therefore, the Chicago Blackhawks made the NHL playoffs during the period from 2010 to 2015.

Final answer:
Yes, the Chicago Blackhawks made the NHL playoffs during the period from 2010 to 2015.
