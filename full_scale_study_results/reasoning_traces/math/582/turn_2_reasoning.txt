Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we first need to find out how much Juan's house is worth. 

We know that Juan's house is 30% less expensive than Herb's house. Herb's house is worth $76,000. 

To find out how much 30% of $76,000 is, we multiply $76,000 by 30/100 (which is the decimal equivalent of 30%). 

$76,000 * 30/100 = $22,800

So, Juan's house is $22,800 less expensive than Herb's house. 

To find out how much Juan's house is worth, we subtract $22,800 from the price of Herb's house. 

$76,000 - $22,800 = $53,200

So, Juan's house is worth $53,200. 

To find out the combined value of the two houses, we add the value of Herb's house to the value of Juan's house. 

$76,000 + $53,200 = $129,200

So, the combined value of the two houses is $129,200.
