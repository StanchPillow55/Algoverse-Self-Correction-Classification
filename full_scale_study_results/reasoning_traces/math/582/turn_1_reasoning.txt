Question ID: 582
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to find out how much Juan's house is worth. Since Juan's house is 30% less expensive than Herb's, we calculate 30% of Herb's house value, which is $76,000.

30/100 * $76,000 = $22,800

This means that Juan's house is $22,800 less expensive than Herb's. To find the value of Juan's house, we subtract this amount from the value of Herb's house:

$76,000 - $22,800 = $53,200

So, Juan's house is worth $53,200.

To find the combined value of the two houses, we add the value of Herb's house to the value of Juan's house:

$76,000 (Herb's house) + $53,200 (Juan's house) = $129,200

So, the combined value of the two houses is $129,200.
