==================================================

First, we need to find out how much Juan's house is worth. If Juan's house is 30% less expensive than Herb's, we need to calculate 30% of Herb's house value and subtract it from the value of Herb's house.

Herb's house is worth $76,000. 

To find 30% of $76,000, we multiply $76,000 by 30/100 (since percent means per hundred):

$76,000 * 30/100 = $22,800

So, 30% of Herb's house value is $22,800.

Now, we subtract this amount from the value of Herb's house to find the value of Juan's house:

$76,000 - $22,800 = $53,200

So, Juan's house is worth $53,200.

Finally, to find the combined value of the two houses, we add the value of Herb's house to the value of Juan's house:

$76,000 (Herb's house) + $53,200 (Juan's house) = $129,200

So, the combined value of the two houses is $129,200.
