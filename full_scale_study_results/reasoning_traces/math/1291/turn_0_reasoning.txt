Question ID: 1291
Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

Step 1: Determine how many pens Timothy has.
Since Timothy has three times the number of pens that George owns, we multiply the number of pens George has by 3.
Timothy's pens = George's pens * 3
Timothy's pens = 18 pens * 3 = 54 pens

Step 2: Determine how many pens Sarah has.
Since Sarah has half as many pens as Timothy, we divide the number of pens Timothy has by 2.
Sarah's pens = Timothy's pens / 2
Sarah's pens = 54 pens / 2 = 27 pens

So, Sarah has 27 pens. This is the final answer.
