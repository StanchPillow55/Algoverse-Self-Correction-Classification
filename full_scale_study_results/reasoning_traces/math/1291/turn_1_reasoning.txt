Question ID: 1291
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many pens Timothy has, and then use that number to find out how many pens Sarah has.

Step 1: Determine the number of pens Timothy has.
We know from the problem that Timothy has three times the number of pens that George owns. Since George has 18 pens, we multiply this number by 3 to find out how many pens Timothy has.

18 pens (George) * 3 = 54 pens (Timothy)

So, Timothy has 54 pens.

Step 2: Determine the number of pens Sarah has.
We know from the problem that Sarah has half as many pens as Timothy. Since Timothy has 54 pens, we divide this number by 2 to find out how many pens Sarah has.

54 pens (Timothy) / 2 = 27 pens (Sarah)

So, Sarah has 27 pens.

Therefore, if George has 18 pens, Sarah has 27 pens.
