Question ID: 493
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, let's calculate the total cost of the razors before the discount. Since each pack costs $4.00 and Heather is buying 2 packs, the total cost would be $4.00 * 2 = $8.00.

However, the razors are on sale for buy one get one free. This means that Heather will only need to pay for one pack, so the cost is reduced to $4.00.

Next, Heather has a $2.00 coupon. This reduces the cost further to $4.00 - $2.00 = $2.00.

Now, let's calculate the cost per razor. Since each pack contains 4 razors and Heather is buying 2 packs, she will get a total of 4 * 2 = 8 razors.

So, the cost per razor is $2.00 / 8 = $0.25.

Since the question asks for the cost in cents, we need to convert this from dollars to cents. There are 100 cents in a dollar, so $0.25 * 100 = 25 cents.

Therefore, each individual razor will cost 25 cents after the discount.
