==================================================

First, let's determine the total cost of the razors before the discount. Heather is buying 2 packs of razors, each costing $4.00. So, the total cost would be 2 * $4.00 = $8.00.

However, the razors are on a buy one get one free sale. This means that Heather will only need to pay for one pack of razors, which is $4.00.

Next, Heather has a $2.00 coupon. So, we subtract this from the cost of the razors after the sale. This gives us $4.00 - $2.00 = $2.00.

So, Heather will pay $2.00 for 2 packs of razors. Each pack contains 4 razors, so in total, Heather is getting 2 * 4 = 8 razors.

To find the cost of each individual razor, we divide the total cost by the total number of razors. This gives us $2.00 / 8 = $0.25 per razor.

However, the problem asks for the cost of each razor in cents. To convert dollars to cents, we multiply by 100. So, $0.25 * 100 = 25 cents.

Therefore, each individual razor will cost 25 cents after the discount.
