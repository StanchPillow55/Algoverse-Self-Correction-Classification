Question ID: 493
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, let's determine the total cost of the razors before any discounts are applied. Since Heather is buying 2 packs of razors, and each pack costs $4.00, the total cost would be 2 * $4.00 = $8.00.

However, the razors are on sale for buy one get one free. This means that Heather only has to pay for one pack of razors, so the cost is reduced to $4.00.

Next, Heather has a $2.00 coupon. This reduces the cost of the razors further, so the final cost is $4.00 - $2.00 = $2.00.

Now, let's determine the cost per individual razor. Since each pack contains 4 razors, and Heather is buying 2 packs, she is getting a total of 2 * 4 = 8 razors.

So, the cost per individual razor is $2.00 / 8 = $0.25.

However, the problem asks for the cost in cents, not dollars. To convert from dollars to cents, we multiply by 100 (since there are 100 cents in a dollar). So, the final cost per individual razor is $0.25 * 100 = 25 cents.

Therefore, each individual razor will cost 25 cents after the discount if Heather buys 2 packs of razors.
