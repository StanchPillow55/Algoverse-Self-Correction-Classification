To determine what the pronoun "she" refers to in the given text, we need to analyze the context and the information provided.

Given information:
- "Anne gave birth to a daughter last month."

3. Since the previous sentence mentioned Anne's daughter, the pronoun "she" in the second sentence is most likely referring to the daughter.

Therefore, the pronoun "she" in the given text refers to Anne's daughter.

Final answer:
The pronoun "she" refers to Anne's daughter.
