Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To determine what the pronoun "she" refers to in the given text, we need to analyze the context and the logical flow of the sentence.

Given information:
- "Anne gave birth to a daughter last month."
- "She is a very charming baby."

Step 1: Identify the potential referents for the pronoun "she".
In the given text, there are two potential referents for the pronoun "she":
1. Anne
2. Anne's daughter

Step 2: Analyze the context and logical flow of the sentence.
The first sentence states that "Anne gave birth to a daughter last month." This indicates that the subject of the second sentence, "She is a very charming baby," is referring to Anne's daughter, not Anne herself.

Step 3: Confirm the referent based on the context.
The second sentence describes the baby as "a very charming baby," which aligns with the information provided in the first sentence about Anne giving birth to a daughter. Therefore, the pronoun "she" in the second sentence refers to Anne's daughter.

Final answer:
The pronoun "she" in the given text refers to Anne's daughter.
