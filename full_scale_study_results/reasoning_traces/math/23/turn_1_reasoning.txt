Question ID: 23
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

The problem is asking us to find out how much shorter a candle will be after it burns from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM. 

First, we need to determine the number of hours the candle will be burning. 

The time from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM is 4 hours. 

We know that the candle melts by 2 centimeters every hour. 

To find out how much the candle will melt in 4 hours, we multiply the number of hours by the rate at which the candle melts. 

So, we have 4 hours * 2 centimeters/hour = 8 centimeters. 

Therefore, the candle will be 8 centimeters shorter after burning from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM.
