Question ID: 23
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we first need to determine the number of hours the candle has been burning. 

The candle started burning at 1:00 PM and stopped at 5:00 PM. To find the number of hours, we subtract the start time from the end time:

5:00 PM - 1:00 PM = 4 hours

So, the candle has been burning for 4 hours.

We know that the candle melts by 2 centimeters every hour. Therefore, to find out how many centimeters shorter the candle will be, we multiply the number of hours the candle has been burning by the amount it melts each hour:

4 hours * 2 cm/hour = 8 cm

Therefore, the candle will be 8 centimeters shorter after burning from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM.
