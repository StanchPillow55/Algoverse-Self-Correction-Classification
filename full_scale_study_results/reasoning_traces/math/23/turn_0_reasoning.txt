==================================================

The problem states that the candle burns at a rate of 2 centimeters per hour. 

The time from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM is 4 hours. 

To find out how many centimeters shorter the candle will be after burning from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM, we need to multiply the number of hours the candle burns by the rate at which the candle burns. 

This can be done using the formula:

Length burned = Burn rate * Time

Substituting the given values into the formula gives:

Length burned = 2 cm/hour * 4 hours = 8 cm

So, the candle will be 8 centimeters shorter after burning from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM.
