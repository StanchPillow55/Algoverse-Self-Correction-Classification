==================================================

First, we need to find out how much stuffing a bed for a collie takes. Since the problem states that it takes the average amount of stuffing between a Rottweiler bed and a chihuahua bed, we need to find the average of 8 pounds and 2 pounds. 

To find the average of two numbers, we add them together and then divide by 2. 

So, (8 + 2) / 2 = 10 / 2 = 5 pounds of stuffing for a collie bed.

Next, we need to find out how much stuffing Mark needs to make 4 chihuahua beds and 3 collie beds. 

Since a chihuahua bed takes 2 pounds of stuffing, 4 chihuahua beds will take 4 * 2 = 8 pounds of stuffing.

Since a collie bed takes 5 pounds of stuffing, 3 collie beds will take 3 * 5 = 15 pounds of stuffing.

Finally, to find out how much stuffing Mark needs in total, we add the amount of stuffing needed for the chihuahua beds and the collie beds together.

So, 8 + 15 = 23 pounds of stuffing.

Therefore, Mark needs 23 pounds of stuffing to make 4 chihuahua beds and 3 collie beds.
