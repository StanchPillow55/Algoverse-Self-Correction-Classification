Question ID: 362
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to find out how much stuffing a bed for a collie takes. The problem states that it takes the average amount of stuffing between a Rottweiler bed and a chihuahua bed. To find the average of two numbers, we add them together and divide by 2. 

So, the amount of stuffing for a collie bed is (8 pounds for Rottweiler + 2 pounds for chihuahua) / 2 = 10 pounds / 2 = 5 pounds.

Next, we need to calculate the total amount of stuffing Mark needs to make 4 chihuahua beds and 3 collie beds. 

For the chihuahua beds, he needs 4 beds * 2 pounds/bed = 8 pounds of stuffing.
For the collie beds, he needs 3 beds * 5 pounds/bed = 15 pounds of stuffing.

Adding these together, Mark needs a total of 8 pounds for chihuahua beds + 15 pounds for collie beds = 23 pounds of stuffing.

So, Mark needs 23 pounds of stuffing to make 4 chihuahua beds and 3 collie beds.
