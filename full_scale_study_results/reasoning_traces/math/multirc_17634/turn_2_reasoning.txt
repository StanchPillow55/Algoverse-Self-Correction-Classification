To solve this problem, I will go through the details provided in the paragraph step-by-step:

1. The paragraph mentions that Picasso "attends to an illegal underground Mixed Martial Arts fighting ring, where he flirts with businesswoman Fan Yau."
2. It then states that "After brutally beating his opponent, Picasso is invited to Fan Yau's house, where he sedates her while they're having sex, tortures and kills her."
3. From this information, we can conclude that Picasso met the woman he sedated, Fan Yau, at the illegal underground Mixed Martial Arts fighting ring.

Therefore, the answer is:
