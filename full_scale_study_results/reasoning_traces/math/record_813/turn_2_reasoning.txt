Question ID: record_813
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given information and perform the necessary calculations.

Given information:
- Martin Montano, a 26-year-old man, took his 61-year-old mother, Hope Montano, and another person, Francisco Dominguez, to a bridge over the Rio Grande.
- Montano attempted to throw both his mother and Dominguez off the bridge.
- Montano's mother survived and is in stable condition at an Albuquerque hospital.
- Montano was arrested in 2012 for false imprisonment and battery against his mother.

Step 1: Determine the age difference between Martin Montano and his mother, Hope Montano.
Age difference = Martin Montano's age - Hope Montano's age
Age difference = 26 years - 61 years = -35 years

The negative value indicates that Hope Montano is 35 years older than Martin Montano.

Step 2: Determine the age of Francisco Dominguez.
The passage does not provide the age of Francisco Dominguez, so we cannot determine it from the given information.
