Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step and show the complete reasoning and work.

Given information:
- Martin Montano, a 26-year-old man, took his 61-year-old mother, Hope Montano, and another person, Francisco Dominguez, to a bridge over the Rio Grande.
- Montano attempted to throw both his mother and Dominguez off the bridge.
- Montano's mother survived and is in stable condition at an Albuquerque hospital.
- Montano was arrested in 2012 for false imprisonment and battery against his mother.

Step 1: Identify the key events and actions taken by Martin Montano.
- Montano took his mother and Dominguez to a bridge over the Rio Grande.
- Montano attempted to throw both his mother and Dominguez off the bridge.
- Montano's mother survived the incident.
- Montano had a history of violence against his mother, as evidenced by his 2012 arrest for false imprisonment and battery.

Step 2: Analyze the reasoning behind Montano's actions.
