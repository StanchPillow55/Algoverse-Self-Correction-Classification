==================================================

First, we need to convert the height of the first child from feet to inches, since the heights of the other children are given in inches. We know that 1 foot is equal to 12 inches. Therefore, the first child is 6 feet * 12 inches/foot = 72 inches tall.

The second child is two inches taller than the first child. So, the second child is 72 inches + 2 inches = 74 inches tall.

The third child is 5 inches shorter than the second child. So, the third child is 74 inches - 5 inches = 69 inches tall.

The fourth child is three inches taller than the third child. So, the fourth child is 69 inches + 3 inches = 72 inches tall.

Therefore, the fourth child is 72 inches tall.
