==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to determine the height of each of Caroline's children in inches and then find the height of the fourth child.

1. **Convert the height of the first child to inches:**
   - The first child is 6 feet tall.
   - Since 1 foot equals 12 inches, we convert feet to inches by multiplying by 12.
   \[
   6 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 72 \text{ inches}
   \]
   So, the first child is 72 inches tall.

2. **Determine the height of the second child:**
   - The second child is 2 inches taller than the first child.
   \[
   72 \text{ inches} + 2 \text{ inches} = 74 \text{ inches}
   \]
   So, the second child is 74 inches tall.

3. **Determine the height of the third child:**
   - The third child is 5 inches shorter than the second child.
   \[
   74 \text{ inches} - 5 \text{ inches} = 69 \text{ inches}
   \]
   So, the third child is 69 inches tall.

4. **Determine the height of the fourth child:**
   - The fourth child is 3 inches taller than the third child.
   \[
   69 \text{ inches} + 3 \text{ inches} = 72 \text{ inches}
   \]
   So, the fourth child is 72 inches tall.

Therefore, the height of the fourth child is \(\boxed{72}\) inches.
