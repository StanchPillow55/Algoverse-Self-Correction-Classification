==================================================

The first step is to determine the weight of each dog in the order they are presented.

We know that the Affenpinscher weighs 10 pounds. 

The Dachshund weighs twice as much as the Affenpinscher, so the Dachshund weighs 2 * 10 pounds = 20 pounds.

The Papillon weighs one-fourth as much as the Dachshund, so the Papillon weighs 20 pounds / 4 = 5 pounds.

The Mastiff weighs 44 times the weight of the Papillon, so the Mastiff weighs 44 * 5 pounds = 220 pounds.

Therefore, the Mastiff weighs 220 pounds.
