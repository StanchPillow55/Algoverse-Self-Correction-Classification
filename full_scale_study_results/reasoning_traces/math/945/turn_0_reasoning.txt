==================================================

First, we need to calculate how far James swims at his normal pace. He swims 60% of the 20-mile lake, which is 0.60 * 20 = 12 miles.

Next, we need to calculate how long it takes him to swim this distance. Since he swims at a pace of 2 miles per hour, it takes him 12 / 2 = 6 hours to swim this distance.

After swimming, James rests for half as long as the swimming time. This means he rests for 6 / 2 = 3 hours.

Then, he finishes the remaining distance at half his normal speed. The remaining distance is 20 - 12 = 8 miles. At half his normal speed, James swims at a pace of 2 / 2 = 1 mile per hour. Therefore, it takes him 8 / 1 = 8 hours to swim the remaining distance.

Adding up the swimming and resting times, James takes 6 (first part of swimming) + 3 (resting) + 8 (second part of swimming) = 17 hours to get across the lake.

So, the final answer is 17 hours.
