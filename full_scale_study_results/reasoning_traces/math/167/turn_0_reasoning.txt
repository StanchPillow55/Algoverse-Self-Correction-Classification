Let's denote Brooke's current age as B and Seth's current age as S. 

From the problem, we know that Seth is twice as old as Brooke, so we can write this as:

S = 2B    (equation 1)

We also know that in 2 years, the sum of their ages will be 28. This can be written as:

(B + 2) + (S + 2) = 28 

Simplifying this equation gives:

B + S + 4 = 28 

Subtracting 4 from both sides gives:

B + S = 24   (equation 2)

Now we have a system of two equations (equation 1 and equation 2) that we can solve simultaneously. 

Substitute equation 1 into equation 2:

B + 2B = 24 

Combine like terms:

3B = 24 

Divide both sides by 3:

B = 8 

Substitute B = 8 into equation 1:

S = 2 * 8 = 16 

So, Seth is 16 years old.
