Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, let's understand the problem. Lindsay has 50 socks that need washing. She has already washed 10 pairs of socks and 15 loose socks. We need to find out how many socks Lindsay has missed.

A pair of socks consists of 2 socks. So, 10 pairs of socks means 10 * 2 = 20 socks.

So, Lindsay has washed a total of 20 socks (from the pairs) + 15 loose socks = 35 socks.

The total number of socks that need washing is 50. If Lindsay has already washed 35 socks, then the number of socks she has missed is 50 - 35 = 15 socks.

So, Lindsay has missed 15 socks.
