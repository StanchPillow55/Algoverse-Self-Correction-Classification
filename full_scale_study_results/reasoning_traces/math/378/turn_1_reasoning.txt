Question ID: 378
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, let's understand the problem. A pair of socks consists of 2 socks. So, if Lindsay washes 10 pairs of socks, that means she washes 10 * 2 = 20 socks.

She also washes 15 loose socks.

So in total, Lindsay washes 20 (from pairs) + 15 (loose) = 35 socks.

However, the problem states that there are 50 socks that need washing. 

So, to find out how many socks Lindsay has missed, we subtract the number of socks she has washed from the total number of socks.

That is, 50 (total socks) - 35 (washed socks) = 15 socks.

Therefore, Lindsay has missed 15 socks.
