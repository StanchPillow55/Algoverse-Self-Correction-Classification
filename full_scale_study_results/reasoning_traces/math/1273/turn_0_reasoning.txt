Question ID: 1273
Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to determine how many marbles Dallas originally received from Mazie. Since Dallas dropped 4 marbles in the playground and still has 21 marbles, we can add these two amounts together to find the original amount. 

21 marbles (that Dallas still has) + 4 marbles (that Dallas dropped) = 25 marbles

So, Dallas originally received 25 marbles from Mazie.

Next, we need to find out how many marbles Darla received. Since Mazie had 52 marbles in total and she gave 25 to Dallas, we can subtract the number of marbles Dallas received from the total number of marbles Mazie had to find out how many marbles Darla received.

52 marbles (total Mazie had) - 25 marbles (that Dallas received) = 27 marbles

So, Mazie gave 27 marbles to Darla. 

Final Answer: Darla received 27 marbles from Mazie.
