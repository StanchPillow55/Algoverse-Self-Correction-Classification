Question ID: 14
Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, let's find out how many students enrolled in contemporary dance. 

20% of 20 students is (20/100) * 20 = 4 students.

So, there are 20 - 4 = 16 students left.

Next, let's find out how many of these remaining students enrolled in jazz dance.

25% of 16 students is (25/100) * 16 = 4 students.

So, there are 16 - 4 = 12 students left.

These 12 students are the ones who enrolled in hip-hop dance.

To find out what percentage of the entire class this is, we divide the number of hip-hop students by the total number of students and multiply by 100.

So, the percentage of students who enrolled in hip-hop dance is (12/20) * 100 = 60%.

Therefore, 60% of the students enrolled in hip-hop dance.
