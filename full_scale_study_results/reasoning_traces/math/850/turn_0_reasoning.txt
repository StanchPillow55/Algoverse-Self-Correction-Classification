Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, let's figure out how many goats Mr. Smith sold from Farm Y. Since he sold twice as many goats from Farm Y as he did from Farm X, and he sold 10 goats from Farm X, he therefore sold 2 * 10 = <<2*10=20>>20 goats from Farm Y.

Now, let's calculate how many goats are left in each farm. In Farm X, he originally had 55 goats and he sold 10, so there are 55 - 10 = <<55-10=45>>45 goats left in Farm X.

In Farm Y, he originally had 45 goats and he sold 20, so there are 45 - 20 = <<45-20=25>>25 goats left in Farm Y.

Finally, to find out how many goats are left in the two farms altogether, we add the number of goats left in each farm. So, 45 goats in Farm X + 25 goats in Farm Y = <<45+25=70>>70 goats.

Therefore, Mr. Smith has 70 goats left in the two farms altogether.
