==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given information and apply logical reasoning to determine the appropriate answer.

Given information:
- Simon Cowell reportedly dumped Lauren Silverman six weeks ago, only to then be told she is pregnant with his baby.
- Cowell is expected to be joined by his ex-girlfriends Sinitta and Mezghan Hussainy on his yacht.
- The query suggests that Cowell has a good relationship with Lauren at the moment, but as a wealthy individual, he can't take any chances.

Reasoning:
1. The passage indicates that Cowell had ended his relationship with Lauren Silverman six weeks ago, before learning about her pregnancy.
2. However, the query suggests that Cowell currently has a good relationship with Lauren, implying that they have reconciled or are in the process of reconciling.
3. As a wealthy individual, Cowell may be cautious about the situation and not want to take any chances, which could explain why he is expected to be joined by his ex-girlfriends on the yacht.
4. The query suggests that Cowell's wealth may be a factor in his decision
