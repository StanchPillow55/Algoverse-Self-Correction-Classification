Question ID: 25
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, let's calculate the total cost of the chicken meal, milk packs, and apples.

The chicken meal costs $12.

The 5 packs of milk cost $3 each, so 5 packs * $3/pack = $15.

The 4 apples cost $1.50 each, so 4 apples * $1.50/apple = $6.

Adding these together, the chicken meal, milk packs, and apples cost $12 + $15 + $6 = $33.

Marie paid a total of $50, so the cost of the pizza boxes is $50 - $33 = $17.

Each box of pizza costs $8.50, so the number of boxes of pizza Marie ordered is $17 / $8.50/box = 2 boxes.

Therefore, Marie ordered 2 boxes of pizza.
