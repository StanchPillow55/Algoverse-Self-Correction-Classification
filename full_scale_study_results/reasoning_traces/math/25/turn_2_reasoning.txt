Question ID: 25
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to calculate the total cost of the chicken meal, milk packs, and apples. 

The chicken meal costs $12. 

The total cost for the milk packs is 5 packs * $3/pack = $15.

The total cost for the apples is 4 apples * $1.50/apple = $6.

So, the total cost for the chicken meal, milk packs, and apples is $12 + $15 + $6 = $33.

Marie paid a total of $50, so the amount she spent on pizza is $50 - $33 = $17.

Since each box of pizza costs $8.50, the number of boxes of pizza Marie ordered is $17 / $8.50/box = 2 boxes.

Therefore, Marie ordered 2 boxes of pizza.
