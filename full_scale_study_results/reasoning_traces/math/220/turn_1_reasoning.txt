Question ID: 220
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we first need to calculate the total time Carmen spent on each type of puzzle.

First, let's calculate the time spent on crossword puzzles. We know that Carmen takes 10 minutes to finish one crossword puzzle. So, if she solved 3 crossword puzzles, she would have spent 10 minutes/puzzle * 3 puzzles = 30 minutes on crossword puzzles.

Next, let's calculate the time spent on sudoku puzzles. We know that Carmen takes 5 minutes to finish one sudoku puzzle. So, if she solved 8 sudoku puzzles, she would have spent 5 minutes/puzzle * 8 puzzles = 40 minutes on sudoku puzzles.

Finally, to find the total time Carmen spent playing these games, we add the time spent on crossword puzzles and the time spent on sudoku puzzles. So, 30 minutes (crossword puzzles) + 40 minutes (sudoku puzzles) = 70 minutes.

Therefore, Carmen spent 70 minutes playing these games over the weekend.
