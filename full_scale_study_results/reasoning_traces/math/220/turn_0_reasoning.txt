==================================================

Carmen takes 10 minutes to finish one crossword puzzle. Over the weekend, she solved 3 crossword puzzles. Therefore, the total time she spent on crossword puzzles is 10 minutes/puzzle * 3 puzzles = 30 minutes.

Carmen takes 5 minutes to finish one sudoku puzzle. Over the weekend, she solved 8 sudoku puzzles. Therefore, the total time she spent on sudoku puzzles is 5 minutes/puzzle * 8 puzzles = 40 minutes.

To find out the total time Carmen spent playing these games, we add the time she spent on crossword puzzles and the time she spent on sudoku puzzles. 

So, 30 minutes (crossword puzzles) + 40 minutes (sudoku puzzles) = 70 minutes.

Therefore, Carmen spent 70 minutes playing these games over the weekend.
