Question ID: 220
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total time Carmen spent on each type of puzzle and then add those times together.

First, let's calculate the time Carmen spent on crossword puzzles. We know that she solved 3 crossword puzzles and that each one takes her 10 minutes to complete. So, we multiply the number of puzzles by the time each one takes:

3 crossword puzzles * 10 minutes/puzzle = 30 minutes

Next, we calculate the time Carmen spent on sudoku puzzles. We know that she solved 8 sudoku puzzles and that each one takes her 5 minutes to complete. So, we multiply the number of puzzles by the time each one takes:

8 sudoku puzzles * 5 minutes/puzzle = 40 minutes

Finally, we add the time Carmen spent on each type of puzzle to find the total time she spent playing these games:

30 minutes (crossword puzzles) + 40 minutes (sudoku puzzles) = 70 minutes

So, Carmen spent a total of 70 minutes playing these games over the weekend.
