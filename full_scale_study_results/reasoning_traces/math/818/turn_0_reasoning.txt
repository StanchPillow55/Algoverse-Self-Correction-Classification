Question ID: 818
Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

Joe has twice as many cars as Robert, so he has 2 * 20 = <<2*20=40>>40 cars.

Joe sells 20% of his cars, which is 20/100 * 40 = <<20/100*40=8>>8 cars.

Joe gives away twice as many cars as the number he sold, so he gives away 2 * 8 = <<2*8=16>>16 cars.

The total number of cars Joe gets rid of is 8 (sold) + 16 (given away) = <<8+16=24>>24 cars.

Joe initially had 40 cars, so after selling and giving away some, he remains with 40 - 24 = <<40-24=16>>16 cars.

So, Joe remains with 16 cars.
