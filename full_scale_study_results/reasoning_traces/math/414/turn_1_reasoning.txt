Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of 4 blouses that are each discounted by 30% from their regular price of $20. Let's break this down step by step:

1. **Determine the discount amount for one blouse:**

   The regular price of one blouse is $20. The discount is 30% of this regular price.

   \[
   \text{Discount per blouse} = 30\% \times 20 = 0.30 \times 20 = 6
   \]

   So, the discount on each blouse is $6.

2. **Calculate the sale price for one blouse:**

   The sale price is the regular price minus the discount.

   \[
   \text{Sale price per blouse} = 20 - 6 = 14
   \]

   Therefore, the sale price for one blouse is $14.

3. **Calculate the total cost for 4 blouses:**

   Since Misha is buying 4 blouses, we need to multiply the sale price of one blouse by 4.

   \[
   \text{Total cost for 4 blouses} = 4 \times 14 = 56
   \]

   Thus, the total cost for 4 discounted blouses is $56.

**Final Answer:**

The total cost of the 4 discounted blouses is $56.
