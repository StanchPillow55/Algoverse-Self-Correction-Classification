Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to find out how much the discount is for each blouse. 

The regular price for each blouse is $20, and they are 30% off. 

To find the discount, we multiply the regular price by the discount rate. 

$20 * 0.30 = $6

So, each blouse is $6 cheaper than the regular price. 

Next, we subtract the discount from the regular price to find the discounted price for each blouse. 

$20 - $6 = $14

So, each blouse costs $14 after the discount. 

Finally, since Misha is buying 4 blouses, we multiply the discounted price by the number of blouses. 

$14 * 4 = $56

So, the total cost of the discounted blouses is $56.
