Question ID: 168
Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

Let's denote the amount of money Jimmy has as J and the amount of money Ethel has as E.

According to the problem, we know that Ethel has $8, so E = 8.

The problem also tells us that Jimmy has $2 more than twice the money Ethel has. We can write this as an equation: J = 2E + 2.

Now we can substitute E = 8 into the equation for J:

J = 2*8 + 2 = 16 + 2 = 18.

So, Jimmy has $18.
