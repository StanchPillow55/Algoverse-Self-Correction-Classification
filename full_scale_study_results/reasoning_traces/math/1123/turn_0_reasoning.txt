First, let's find out how much Elijah's dogs weigh. 

Elijah's first dog is one-fourth the weight of Kory's dog. Since Kory's dog weighs 60 pounds, we can find the weight of Elijah's first dog by multiplying 60 by 1/4. 

60 * 1/4 = 15 pounds

Elijah's second dog is half the weight of Kory's dog. We can find the weight of Elijah's second dog by multiplying 60 by 1/2.

60 * 1/2 = 30 pounds

So, Elijah's dogs weigh 15 pounds and 30 pounds respectively.

Now, to find the total weight of all the dogs, we add the weights of Kory's dog and both of Elijah's dogs together.

60 (Kory's dog) + 15 (Elijah's first dog) + 30 (Elijah's second dog) = 105 pounds

So, Elijah and Koryâ€™s dogs weigh altogether 105 pounds.
