Question ID: 1123
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to find out the weight of Elijah's dogs. 

Elijah's first dog is one-fourth the weight of Kory's dog. Since Kory's dog is 60 pounds, we can find the weight of Elijah's first dog by multiplying 60 by 1/4. 

60 * 1/4 = 15 pounds

Elijah's second dog is half the weight of Kory's dog. We can find the weight of Elijah's second dog by multiplying 60 by 1/2. 

60 * 1/2 = 30 pounds

Now, we add the weights of all three dogs to find the total weight. 

Kory's dog: 60 pounds
Elijah's first dog: 15 pounds
Elijah's second dog: 30 pounds

60 + 15 + 30 = 105 pounds

So, Elijah and Koryâ€™s dogs weigh altogether 105 pounds.
