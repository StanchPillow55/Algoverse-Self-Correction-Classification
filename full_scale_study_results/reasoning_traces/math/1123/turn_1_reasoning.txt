Question ID: 1123
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to find out the weight of Elijah's dogs. 

We know that one of Elijah's dogs is one-fourth the weight of Kory's dog. Since Kory's dog is 60 pounds, we can calculate the weight of Elijah's first dog by multiplying 60 by 1/4. 

60 * 1/4 = 15 pounds

So, Elijah's first dog weighs 15 pounds. 

Next, we know that Elijah's other dog is half the weight of Kory's dog. We can calculate the weight of Elijah's second dog by multiplying 60 by 1/2. 

60 * 1/2 = 30 pounds

So, Elijah's second dog weighs 30 pounds. 

To find out the total weight of all the dogs, we need to add the weight of Kory's dog (60 pounds) to the weight of Elijah's two dogs (15 pounds and 30 pounds). 

60 + 15 + 30 = 105 pounds

So, the total weight of all the dogs is 105 pounds.
