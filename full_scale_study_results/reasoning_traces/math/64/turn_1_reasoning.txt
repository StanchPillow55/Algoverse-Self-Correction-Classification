Question ID: 64
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to determine how many miles Sophia's car can travel per gallon of gas. We can do this by dividing the total miles she has traveled by the amount of gas she needed to refill her tank. 

So, 100 miles รท 4 gallons = 25 miles per gallon. 

This means that for every gallon of gas, Sophia's car can travel 25 miles. 

Next, we need to determine how far Sophia can travel on a full tank of gas. We can do this by multiplying the miles per gallon by the total gallons her tank can hold.

So, 25 miles per gallon x 12 gallons = 300 miles.

Therefore, Sophia can drive 300 miles on a single tank of gas.
