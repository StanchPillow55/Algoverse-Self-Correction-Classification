Question ID: 64
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we first need to determine the fuel efficiency of Sophia's car. This is typically measured in miles per gallon (mpg). We can calculate this by dividing the distance she has traveled by the amount of gas she used. 

Sophia traveled 100 miles and used 4 gallons of gas. So, her car's fuel efficiency is 100 miles / 4 gallons = 25 miles per gallon.

Now that we know her car's fuel efficiency, we can calculate how far she can drive on a full tank of gas. According to the owner's manual, her car's tank holds 12 gallons of gas. 

So, on a full tank, Sophia can drive 25 miles/gallon * 12 gallons = 300 miles.

Therefore, Sophia can drive 300 miles on a single tank of gas.
