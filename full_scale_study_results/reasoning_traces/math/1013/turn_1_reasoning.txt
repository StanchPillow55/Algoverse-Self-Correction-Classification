Question ID: 1013
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to determine how much Janet makes in total per hour. She makes $10 an hour from wages and $15 an hour from tips, so her total hourly wage is $10 + $15 = $25.

Next, we need to calculate how much she makes in a week. If she works 40 hours a week, her weekly earnings are $25 * 40 = $1000.

Then, we need to determine how much she needs to save for the down payment on the car. If the car costs $10,000 and she wants to save 20% for a down payment, she needs to save $10,000 * 0.20 = $2000.

Finally, we need to determine how many weeks she needs to work to save this amount. If she makes $1000 a week, the number of weeks she needs to work is $2000 / $1000 = 2 weeks.

Therefore, Janet needs to work for 2 weeks to save enough for the down payment on the car.
