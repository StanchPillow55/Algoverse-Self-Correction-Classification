Question ID: 1013
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, let's calculate how much Janet makes in a week. She makes $10 an hour from wages and $15 an hour from tips, so her total hourly wage is $10 + $15 = $25.

If she works 40 hours a week, she makes $25 * 40 = $1000 a week.

Next, let's calculate how much she needs to save for the downpayment. She wants to save 20% of the cost of a $10000 car, so she needs to save 0.20 * $10000 = $2000.

Finally, let's calculate how many weeks she needs to work to save this amount. If she makes $1000 a week, she needs to work $2000 / $1000 = 2 weeks to save the downpayment.

Therefore, Janet needs to work for 2 weeks to save enough for the downpayment on the car.
