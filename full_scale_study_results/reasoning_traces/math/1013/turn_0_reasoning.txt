==================================================

First, we need to calculate how much Janet earns in a week. 

She earns $10 an hour from wages and $15 an hour from tips, so she earns $10 + $15 = $<<10+15=25>>25 an hour in total.

If she works 40 hours a week, she earns 40 hours * $25/hour = $<<40*25=1000>>1000 a week.

Next, we need to calculate how much she needs to save for the down payment. 

She wants to save 20% of the cost of a $10000 car, so she needs to save 0.20 * $10000 = $<<0.20*10000=2000>>2000.

Finally, we need to calculate how many weeks she needs to work to save this amount. 

If she earns $1000 a week, she needs to work $2000 / $1000/week = 2 weeks to save the down payment.

So, Janet needs to work for 2 weeks to save enough for the down payment on the car.
