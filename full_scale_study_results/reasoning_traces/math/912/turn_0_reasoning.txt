Question ID: 912
Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, let's find out how long it takes John to complete an extreme sudoku puzzle. We know that an extreme sudoku takes him 4 times longer than a normal one, which takes 45 minutes. So, we multiply 45 minutes by 4:

45 minutes * 4 = 180 minutes

So, an extreme sudoku puzzle takes John 180 minutes to complete.

Next, we need to find out how many bottles of water John drinks in this time. We know that he drinks a bottle of water every half hour, which is the same as every 30 minutes. 

To find out how many bottles of water he drinks, we divide the total time by the time it takes him to drink one bottle:

180 minutes / 30 minutes = 6 bottles

So, John drinks 6 bottles of water while completing an extreme sudoku puzzle.
