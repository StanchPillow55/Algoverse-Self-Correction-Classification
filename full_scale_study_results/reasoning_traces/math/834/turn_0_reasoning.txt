Dataset Type: math
==================================================

Mason's total travel time is the sum of the two periods he spent biking, which is 4 hours + 6 hours = 10 hours.

Since his speed is constant at 8 miles per hour, we can find the total distance he traveled by multiplying his speed by his total travel time. 

So, the total distance Mason traveled is 8 miles/hour * 10 hours = 80 miles.

Therefore, Mason has traveled a total of 80 miles.
