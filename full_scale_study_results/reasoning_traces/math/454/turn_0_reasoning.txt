Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

Marin and Nancy each eat 4 apples a day. This means that together, they eat 4 + 4 = 8 apples a day.

To find out how many apples they eat in 30 days, we multiply the number of apples they eat in a day by the number of days.

So, 8 apples/day * 30 days = 240 apples.

Therefore, Marin and Nancy eat 240 apples in 30 days.
