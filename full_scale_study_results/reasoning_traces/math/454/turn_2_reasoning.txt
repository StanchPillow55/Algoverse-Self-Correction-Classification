Question ID: 454
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

Marin and Nancy each eat 4 apples a day. This means that in one day, they eat a total of 4 apples (Marin) + 4 apples (Nancy) = 8 apples.

To find out how many apples they eat in 30 days, we multiply the number of apples they eat in one day by 30. 

So, 8 apples/day * 30 days = 240 apples.

Therefore, Marin and Nancy eat a total of 240 apples in 30 days.
