Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math

Step 1: Determine the daily apple consumption

First, we need to determine how many apples Marin and Nancy eat together in a day. Since each of them eats 4 apples a day, we add their daily consumption together:

4 apples (Marin's daily consumption) + 4 apples (Nancy's daily consumption) = 8 apples

So, Marin and Nancy together eat 8 apples a day.

Step 2: Determine the monthly apple consumption

Next, we need to determine how many apples Marin and Nancy eat together in a month. Since there are 30 days in the month, we multiply their daily consumption by the number of days in the month:

8 apples/day * 30 days = 240 apples

So, Marin and Nancy together eat 240 apples in 30 days.

Final Answer: Marin and Nancy together eat 240 apples in 30 days.
