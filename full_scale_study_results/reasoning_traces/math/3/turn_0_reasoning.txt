Question ID: 3
Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to multiply the number of sprints James runs each time by the distance of each sprint, and then multiply that by the number of times he runs per week.

First, we find the total distance James runs each time he sprints. He runs 3 sprints, each of 60 meters, so we multiply 3 by 60 to get 180 meters.

Next, we find the total distance he runs in a week. He runs 3 times a week, so we multiply the 180 meters he runs each time by 3. 

180 meters/time * 3 times/week = 540 meters/week

So, James runs a total of 540 meters in a week.
