Question ID: 3
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to multiply the number of sprints James runs each time by the distance of each sprint, and then multiply that by the number of times he runs per week.

Step 1: Calculate the total distance James runs each time.
He runs 3 sprints each time, and each sprint is 60 meters. So, the total distance he runs each time is 3 sprints * 60 meters/sprint = 180 meters.

Step 2: Calculate the total distance James runs in a week.
He runs 3 times a week, so the total distance he runs in a week is 180 meters/time * 3 times/week = 540 meters/week.

So, James runs a total of 540 meters in a week.
