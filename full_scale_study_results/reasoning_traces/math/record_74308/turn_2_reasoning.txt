Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, I will break it down step-by-step:

1. The passage states that the Senate Republicans blocked a Democratic measure to end tax breaks for major oil companies. The vote was 51-47, failing to reach the 60 votes needed to pass.

2. The passage mentions that 4 Democrats opposed the bill, while 1 Republican supported it.

3. To find the total number of Senators, I need to add up the votes:
   - 51 Republicans voted against the bill
   - 47 Democrats voted for the bill
   - 1 Republican voted for the bill
   - 4 Democrats voted against the bill

   Total Senators = 51 + 47 + 1 + 4 = 103

4. The passage states that the vote failed to reach the needed threshold of 60 in favor. This means the final vote count was 51-47.

5. To find the placeholder value, I need to subtract the number of Senators who voted against the bill from the total number of Senators:
   - Total Senators = 103
   - Senators who voted against the bill =
