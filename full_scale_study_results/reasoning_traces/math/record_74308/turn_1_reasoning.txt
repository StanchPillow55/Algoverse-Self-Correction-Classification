Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, I will break it down step-by-step:

Given information:
- The Senate Republicans blocked a Democratic measure championed by President Barack Obama to end tax breaks for the major oil companies.
- The procedural vote was 51-47, which failed to reach the needed threshold of 60 in favor.
- Four Democrats opposed the bill while one Republican supported it.
- President Obama framed the oil subsidy vote as a choice between that vision and protecting the status quo.
- Obama said "Today, the American people are going to be watching @placeholder to see if they have that same faith."

Step 1: Identify the key elements in the problem.
- The vote on ending oil company tax breaks
- The vote count and threshold needed
- The party affiliations of the senators who voted
- President Obama's framing of the vote
- The placeholder in Obama's statement

Step 2: Analyze the vote count and threshold.
The vote count was 51-47, which failed to reach the needed threshold of 60 in favor.
This means the measure was blocked, as it did not receive the necessary 60 votes to pass.
