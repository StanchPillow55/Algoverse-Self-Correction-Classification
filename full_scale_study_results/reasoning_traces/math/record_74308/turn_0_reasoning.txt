Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given information and determine the missing word in the query.

Given information:
- The passage discusses a vote in the Senate to end tax breaks for major oil companies.
- The vote failed to reach the needed threshold of 60 in favor, with 51-47 against the measure.
- President Obama had championed the measure, and framed the vote as a choice between his vision and protecting the status quo.
- The query states that Obama said the American people will be watching "@placeholder to see if they have that same faith."

To find the missing word, we need to determine what the American people will be watching to see if they have the same faith as Obama's vision.

Based on the context, the missing word is likely "Congress" or "Senators". The passage indicates that the vote was in the Senate, and Obama is referring to the American people watching Congress/Senators to see if they have the same faith as his vision.

Therefore, the complete query would be:

"Today, the American people are going to be watching Congress to see if they have that same faith."

Final answer: Congress
