Question ID: 1002
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we first need to add up the total number of boxes that Lisa and Peter sold. 

Lisa sold 3.5 boxes and Peter sold 4.5 boxes. 

So, the total number of boxes they sold is 3.5 + 4.5 = 8 boxes.

We know that together they sold 64 chocolate bars. 

To find out how many chocolate bars are in a box, we need to divide the total number of chocolate bars by the total number of boxes. 

So, 64 chocolate bars รท 8 boxes = 8 chocolate bars per box.

Therefore, there are 8 chocolate bars in a box.
