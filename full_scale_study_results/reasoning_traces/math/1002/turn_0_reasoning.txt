Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

Lisa and Peter sold a total of 3.5 + 4.5 = <<3.5+4.5=8>>8 boxes of chocolate bars.

They sold 64 chocolate bars in total, and these came from 8 boxes. 

To find out how many chocolate bars are in a box, we divide the total number of chocolate bars by the total number of boxes.

So, 64 รท 8 = <<64/8=8>>8.

Therefore, there are 8 chocolate bars in a box.
