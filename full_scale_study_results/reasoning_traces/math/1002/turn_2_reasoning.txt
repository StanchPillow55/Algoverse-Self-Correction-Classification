Question ID: 1002
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we first need to add up the total number of boxes that Lisa and Peter sold. Lisa sold 3.5 boxes and Peter sold 4.5 boxes. 

3.5 boxes + 4.5 boxes = 8 boxes

So, Lisa and Peter sold a total of 8 boxes of chocolate bars. 

We know that they sold 64 chocolate bars in total. To find out how many chocolate bars are in each box, we need to divide the total number of chocolate bars by the total number of boxes. 

64 chocolate bars รท 8 boxes = 8 chocolate bars per box

So, there are 8 chocolate bars in a box.
