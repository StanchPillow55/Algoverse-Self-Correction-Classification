To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given information and determine the appropriate mathematical operations to answer the query.

Given information:
- Liu Xinda purchased bitcoin when it was trading at 60 yuan (U.S.$9.85) in 2012.
- Liu Xinda sold his bitcoin when it was trading at 700 yuan ($115) in June.
- Last week, bitcoin was trading at 7,000 yuan ($1,149).

Step 1: Calculate the profit Liu Xinda made from his bitcoin investment.
Purchase price: 60 yuan
Selling price: 700 yuan
Profit = Selling price - Purchase price
Profit = 700 yuan - 60 yuan = 640 yuan

Step 2: Convert the profit to U.S. dollars.
Profit in U.S. dollars = Profit in yuan / Exchange rate
Profit in U.S. dollars = 640 yuan / 9.85 = $64.92

Step 3: Analyze the query and determine the appropriate mathematical operation.
The query states that "investors seeking similar investment success like Liu are feeding the bitcoin f
