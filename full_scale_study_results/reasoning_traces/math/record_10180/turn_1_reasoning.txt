==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given information and determine the appropriate mathematical reasoning to answer the query.

Given information:
- Liu Xinda, a 23-year-old magazine editor, invested in bitcoin in 2012.
- He purchased bitcoin when it was trading at 60 yuan (U.S.$9.85) on the Chinese market.
- He sold his bitcoin when it was trading at 700 yuan ($115) in June.
- Last week, bitcoin was trading at 7,000 yuan ($1,149).

Query: And @placeholder investors seeking similar investment success like Liu are feeding the bitcoin frenzy.

To answer the query, we need to calculate the percentage return on Liu's bitcoin investment.

Step 1: Calculate the percentage return on Liu's bitcoin investment.
Purchase price: 60 yuan
Selling price: 700 yuan
Percentage return = (Selling price - Purchase price) / Purchase price × 100
Percentage return = (700 yuan - 60 yuan) / 60 yuan × 100
Percentage return = 1066.67%

Step 2: Determine the appropriate wor
