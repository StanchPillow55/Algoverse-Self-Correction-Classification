Question ID: 885
Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

The Ben and Aggie Burrito Shop makes 125 chimichangas on Tuesdays and 125 on Wednesdays. This gives us:

125 (Tuesday) + 125 (Wednesday) = 250 chimichangas

On Fridays, they make twice as many as they do on Tuesday or Wednesday. Since they make 125 on those days, on Friday they make:

2 * 125 = 250 chimichangas

So, the total number of chimichangas they make on Tuesday, Wednesday, and Friday is:

250 (Tuesday and Wednesday) + 250 (Friday) = 500 chimichangas

So, the Ben and Aggie Burrito Shop makes 500 chimichangas on those three days.
