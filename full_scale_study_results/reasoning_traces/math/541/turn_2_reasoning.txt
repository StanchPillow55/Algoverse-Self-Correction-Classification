==================================================

First, let's break down the problem.

Elvis wants to save $1125 in April, and he plans to save twice as much each day in the second half of the month as he does in the first half.

April has 30 days, so we can divide it into two halves: the first half (April 1-15) and the second half (April 16-30). That's 15 days in each half.

Let's denote the amount he saves each day in the first half as x. Therefore, the amount he saves each day in the second half is 2x (twice as much as he saves in the first half).

The total amount he saves in April should be the sum of what he saves in the first half and the second half. So, we can set up the following equation:

15x (total savings in the first half) + 15*2x (total savings in the second half) = $1125

Solving this equation will give us the value of x, which is the daily saving amount in the first half. We can then multiply x by 2 to get the daily saving amount in the second half.

Let's solve the equation:

15x + 30x = 1125
45x = 1125
x = 1125 / 45
x = $25

So, Elvis needs to save $25 each day in the first half of April. 

To find out how much he needs to save each day in the second half, we multiply x by 2:

2x = 2 * $25 = $50

So, Elvis needs to save $50 each day in the second half of April to meet his monthly saving target of $1125.
