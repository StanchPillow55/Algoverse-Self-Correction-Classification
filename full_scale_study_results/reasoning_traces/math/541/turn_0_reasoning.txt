First, let's break down the month of April. April has 30 days, so the first half of the month is 15 days and the second half of the month is also 15 days.

Elvis wants to save twice as much daily in the second half of the month as he saves in the first half of the month. Let's denote the daily savings in the first half of the month as x. Therefore, the daily savings in the second half of the month would be 2x.

The total savings for the month would be the sum of the savings from the first half and the second half of the month. So, we can set up the following equation:

15x (savings from the first half) + 15*2x (savings from the second half) = $1125

Solving this equation will give us the value of x, which is the daily savings in the first half of the month. Then, we can find the daily savings in the second half of the month by multiplying x by 2.

Let's solve the equation:

15x + 30x = 1125
45x = 1125
x = 1125 / 45
x = $25

So, Elvis has to save $25 each day in the first half of the month. 

To find out how much he has to save each day in the second half of the month, we multiply x by 2:

2x = 2 * $25 = $50

So, Elvis has to save $50 each day in the second half of the month to hit his monthly saving target of $1125.
