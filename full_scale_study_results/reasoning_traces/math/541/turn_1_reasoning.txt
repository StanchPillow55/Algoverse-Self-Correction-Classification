Question ID: 541
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, let's break down the month of April. April has 30 days, so the first half of the month is 15 days and the second half of the month is also 15 days.

Elvis wants to save twice as much daily in the second half of the month as he does in the first half. Let's denote the daily saving in the first half of the month as x. Therefore, the daily saving in the second half of the month would be 2x.

The total amount saved in the month would be the sum of the amounts saved in the first half and the second half of the month. This can be represented by the equation:

15x + 15(2x) = $1125

This simplifies to:

15x + 30x = $1125

Combine like terms:

45x = $1125

To find the value of x, divide both sides of the equation by 45:

x = $1125 / 45

x = $25

So, Elvis saves $25 each day in the first half of the month. But the question asks for the amount he saves each day in the second half of the month, which is 2x:

2x = 2 * $25 = $50

Therefore, Elvis has to save $50 each day in the second half of the month to hit his target.
