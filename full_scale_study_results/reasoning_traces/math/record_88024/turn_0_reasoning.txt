==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to find the missing word in the query.

Given information:
- Pepsi Co. is testing a nacho cheese-inspired soda at colleges.
- The drink apparently tastes like Nacho Cheese Doritos.
- A Mountain Dew flavored Dorito chip appeared in 2008 for a limited time.
- The query states: "It's not known when the drink may be available in stores, however this isn't the first time @placeholder have been combined with Mountain Dew."

The missing word in the query is the subject that has been combined with Mountain Dew before.

Reasoning:
Based on the information provided, we can infer that the missing word is "Doritos" or "Dorito chips". The passage mentions that a Mountain Dew flavored Dorito chip appeared in 2008, indicating that Doritos and Mountain Dew have been combined before.

Therefore, the complete query would be:

"It's not known when the drink may be available in stores, however this isn't the first time Doritos have been combined with Mountain Dew."

Final answer:
