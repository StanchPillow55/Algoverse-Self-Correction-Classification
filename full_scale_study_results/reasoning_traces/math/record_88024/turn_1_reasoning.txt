Question ID: record_88024
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to find the missing word in the given query.

Given information:
- Pepsi Co. is testing a nacho cheese-inspired soda at colleges.
- The drink apparently tastes like Nacho Cheese Doritos.
- A Mountain Dew flavored Dorito chip appeared in 2008 for a limited time.
- The query states: "It's not known when the drink may be available in stores, however this isn't the first time @placeholder have been combined with Mountain Dew."

The missing word in the query is the subject that has been combined with Mountain Dew before.

Reasoning:
Based on the information provided, the subject that has been combined with Mountain Dew before is Doritos. In 2008, there was a limited-time release of a Mountain Dew flavored Dorito chip, which indicates that Doritos and Mountain Dew have been combined in the past.

Therefore, the missing word in the query is "Doritos".

Final answer:
The missing word in the query is "Doritos".
