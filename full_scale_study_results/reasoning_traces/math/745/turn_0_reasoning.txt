==================================================

First, let's calculate how much Mark spent on the packs of magic cards. He bought 3 packs for $1800 each, so the total cost is 3 * $1800 = $5400.

Next, let's calculate how much money he made from selling the cards. He sold one card for $4000 and another for $1000, so the total from these two cards is $4000 + $1000 = $5000.

He also sold 30 more cards for an average of $50 each. The total from these cards is 30 * $50 = $1500.

So, the total amount of money he made from selling all the cards is $5000 (from the two expensive cards) + $1500 (from the 30 other cards) = $6500.

Finally, to find out how much profit he made, we subtract the cost of the packs from the total amount he made from selling the cards. So, the profit is $6500 (total sales) - $5400 (cost) = $1100.

Therefore, Mark made a profit of $1100.
