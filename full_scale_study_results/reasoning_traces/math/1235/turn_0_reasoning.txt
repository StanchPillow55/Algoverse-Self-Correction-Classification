==================================================

First, we need to calculate the total distance Michael can travel in 3 days at his average speed of 50km/hr.

We know that there are 24 hours in a day, so in 3 days, there are 3*24 = 72 hours.

If Michael travels at an average speed of 50km/hr for 72 hours, he will cover a distance of 50km/hr * 72hr = 3600km.

Now, we need to calculate what percentage of the total distance between Alaska and Texas (6000km) is 3600km.

The formula to calculate the percentage is (part/whole)*100.

So, the percentage of the distance Michael has covered is (3600km/6000km)*100 = 60%.

Therefore, Michael has covered 60% of the distance between Alaska and Texas in 3 days at his average speed of 50km/hr.
