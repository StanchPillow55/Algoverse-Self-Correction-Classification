Question ID: 1235
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine how much distance Michael covers in 3 days at an average speed of 50 km/hr, and then calculate what percentage of the total distance between Alaska and Texas (6000 km) this represents.

### Step-by-Step Solution:

1. **Calculate the Total Hours Traveled:**
   - Michael is traveling for 3 days.
   - There are 24 hours in a day.
   - Total hours traveled = 3 days × 24 hours/day = 72 hours.

2. **Calculate the Total Distance Traveled:**
   - Michael's average speed is 50 km/hr.
   - Distance traveled = speed × time.
   - Distance traveled = 50 km/hr × 72 hours = 3600 km.

3. **Calculate the Percentage of the Total Distance:**
   - The total distance between Alaska and Texas is 6000 km.
   - We need to find what percentage 3600 km is of 6000 km.
   - Percentage covered = (distance traveled / total distance) × 100.
   - Percentage covered = (3600 km / 6000 km) × 100 = 60%.

### Final Answer:

Michael has covered 60% of the distance between Alaska and Texas after traveling for 3 days at an average speed of 50 km/hr.
