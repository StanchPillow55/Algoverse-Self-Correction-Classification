Question ID: 1235
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to determine how many kilometers Michael travels in a day. Since he is traveling at an average speed of 50km/hr, we can multiply this by the number of hours in a day to find the total distance he travels in a day.

There are 24 hours in a day, so:

50km/hr * 24hr/day = 1200km/day

Next, we need to determine how far Michael travels in 3 days. We can do this by multiplying the distance he travels in a day by 3:

1200km/day * 3 days = 3600km

Now, we need to determine what percentage of the total distance between Alaska and Texas (6000km) Michael has covered. We can do this by dividing the distance he has traveled by the total distance and then multiplying by 100 to convert the decimal to a percentage:

(3600km / 6000km) * 100 = 60%

So, Michael has covered 60% of the distance between Alaska and Texas.
