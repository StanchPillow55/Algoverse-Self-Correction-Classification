==================================================

To solve this problem, I will need to analyze the given passage and determine the relevant information to answer the query.

The passage provides details about the life and work of lyricist Hal David, who co-wrote many hit songs with composer Burt Bacharach. It mentions that David's songs were recorded by various artists, including Barbra Streisand and Dionne Warwick.

However, the passage does not mention anything about Hal David or Burt Bacharach working with a young vocalist. The query asks about "they" being some of the first to work with a placeholder, which is not supported by the information given in the passage.

Without any specific details about Hal David or Burt Bacharach working with a young vocalist, I do not have enough information to provide a complete answer to the query. The passage does not contain the necessary details to solve this problem.

Therefore, my final answer is:
The passage does not provide any information to answer the given query. There is no evidence in the passage that Hal David or Burt Bacharach were some of the first to work with a young vocalist.
