==================================================

To solve this problem, I will need to analyze the given passage and determine the relevant information to answer the query.

The passage provides details about the life and work of Hal David, a lyricist who co-wrote many hit songs with composer Burt Bacharach. It mentions that David's songs were recorded by various artists, including Barbra Streisand and Dionne Warwick.

However, the passage does not mention anything about Hal David or Burt Bacharach working with a young vocalist. The query asks about "they" being some of the first to work with a placeholder, but the passage does not provide any information about a placeholder or a young vocalist that Hal David and Burt Bacharach worked with.

Without any relevant information in the passage to answer the query, I do not have enough information to provide a complete solution. The query cannot be answered based solely on the information given in the passage.

Final answer: Unable to answer the query based on the information provided in the passage.
