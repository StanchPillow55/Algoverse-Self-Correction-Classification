==================================================

To solve this problem, I will go through the paragraph step-by-step and identify the relevant information to determine which company did not respond to CNN's email seeking comment.

Step 1: Identify the key companies mentioned in the paragraph.
The key companies mentioned are:
1. Transocean Ltd. - Owner of the Gulf of Mexico oil rig that exploded
2. BP - Leased the Deepwater Horizon rig
3. Halliburton - Installed the rig's cement casing

Step 2: Determine which company did not respond to CNN's email seeking comment.
The paragraph states:
"The company did not respond to an e-mail from CNN seeking comment."
This statement is made immediately after discussing Transocean's actions, including the bonuses and raises awarded to its executives.
Therefore, the company that did not respond to CNN's email seeking comment is Transocean Ltd.

Step 3: Verify that the other companies are not the ones that did not respond.
The paragraph does not state that BP or Halliburton did not respond to CNN's email.

Final Answer:
Transocean Ltd. di
