Question ID: multirc_531
Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To determine which company did not respond to CNN's email seeking comment, I will carefully read through the paragraph and identify the companies mentioned.

The paragraph mentions three companies:
1. Transocean Ltd. - the owner of the Gulf of Mexico oil rig that exploded
2. BP - the company that leased the rig
3. Halliburton - the company that installed the rig's cement casing

The paragraph states that "The company did not respond to an e-mail from CNN seeking comment." This statement is referring to Transocean Ltd., as they are the last company mentioned before this statement.

Therefore, the company that did not respond to CNN's email seeking comment is Halliburton.

Final answer: Halliburton
