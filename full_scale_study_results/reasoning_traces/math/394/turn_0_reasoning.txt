==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to determine how many books Wendy wants to place in her shelving system based on the given conditions.

1. **Understanding the shelving system**: 
   The shelving system has 6 rows and 6 columns. To find the total number of spaces available for books, we multiply the number of rows by the number of columns:
   \[
   \text{Total spaces} = \text{rows} \times \text{columns} = 6 \times 6 = 36
   \]
   This means there are 36 spaces available for books in the shelving system.

2. **Setting up the equation for the number of books**:
   According to the problem, Wendy wants to place "20 more than double the number of books." Let's denote the number of books she wants to place as \( x \). The expression for the number of books she wants is:
   \[
   x = 2x + 20
   \]

3. **Solving the equation**:
   We can rearrange the equation to isolate \( x \):
   \[
   x = 2x + 20
   \]
   Subtract \( 2x \) from both sides:
   \[
   x - 2x = 20
   \]
   This simplifies to:
   \[
   -x = 20
   \]
   Multiplying both sides by -1 gives:
   \[
   x = -20
   \]

4. **Interpreting the result**:
   The result \( x = -20 \) does not make sense in the context of the problem, as the number of books cannot be negative. This indicates that there is a misunderstanding in the interpretation of the phrase "20 more than double the number of books." 

   Let's clarify the requirement:
   Wendy wants to place a number of books that is "20 more than double the number of books." This can be interpreted as:
   \[
   \text{Number of books} = 2 \times \text{Number of books} + 20
   \]
   This leads to a contradiction, as it implies that the number of books is both equal to and greater than itself.

5. **Conclusion**:
   Since the equation leads to an impossible scenario, we can conclude that Wendy's requirement cannot be satisfied with a positive number of books. Therefore, the number of books she needs to carry to complete her task is not feasible under the given conditions.

Thus, the final answer is that Wendy cannot carry a valid number of books based on the provided condition.
