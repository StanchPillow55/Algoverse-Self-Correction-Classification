Question ID: 394
Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, let's find out how many books the shelving system can hold. Since there are 6 rows and 6 columns, we can find the total number of books the shelving system can hold by multiplying the number of rows by the number of columns.

6 rows * 6 columns = 36 books

This means that the shelving system can hold 36 books.

Wendy wants to place 20 more than double the number of books that the shelving system can hold. To find out how many books this is, we first need to double the number of books the shelving system can hold.

36 books * 2 = 72 books

Then, we add 20 to this number to find out how many books Wendy wants to place.

72 books + 20 books = 92 books

Therefore, Wendy will need to carry 92 books to complete her task.
