Question ID: 394
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to determine how many books Wendy wants to place in her shelving system based on the information given.

1. **Understanding the shelving system**: 
   The shelving system has 6 rows and 6 columns. To find the total number of spaces available for books, we calculate:
   \[
   \text{Total spaces} = \text{Number of rows} \times \text{Number of columns} = 6 \times 6 = 36
   \]
   This means there are 36 spaces available for books in the shelving system.

2. **Setting up the equation for the number of books**:
   According to the problem, Wendy wants to place "20 more than double the number of books". Let's denote the number of books she wants to place as \( x \). The phrase "double the number of books" can be expressed mathematically as \( 2x \). Therefore, "20 more than double the number of books" can be expressed as:
   \[
   2x + 20
   \]

3. **Finding the total number of books**:
   We know that Wendy wants to fill the shelving system with books, and the total number of books she wants to place is equal to the total spaces available in the shelving system. Thus, we set up the equation:
   \[
   2x + 20 = 36
   \]

4. **Solving for \( x \)**:
   To find \( x \), we will solve the equation step by step:
   - First, subtract 20 from both sides:
   \[
   2x + 20 - 20 = 36 - 20
   \]
   This simplifies to:
   \[
   2x = 16
   \]
   - Next, divide both sides by 2:
   \[
   x = \frac{16}{2} = 8
   \]

5. **Calculating the total number of books**:
   Now that we have \( x = 8 \), we can find the total number of books Wendy wants to place:
   \[
   \text{Total number of books} = 2x + 20 = 2(8) + 20 = 16 + 20 = 36
   \]

6. **Final answer**:
   Wendy needs to carry a total of 36 books to complete her task.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{36}
\]
