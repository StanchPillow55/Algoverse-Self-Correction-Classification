Question ID: 394
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine how many books Wendy needs to place in the shelving system. Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Understand the Shelving System:**
   - The shelving system has 6 rows and 6 columns.
   - Therefore, the total number of slots available in the shelving system is:
     \[
     6 \times 6 = 36 \text{ slots}
     \]

2. **Determine the Number of Books Wendy Wants to Place:**
   - Wendy wants to place "20 more than double the number of books" in the shelving system.
   - Let's denote the number of books Wendy initially considers as \( x \).
   - According to the problem, Wendy wants to place:
     \[
     2x + 20 \text{ books}
     \]

3. **Relate the Number of Books to the Shelving System:**
   - Since the shelving system has 36 slots, Wendy can place up to 36 books.
   - Therefore, the equation we need to solve is:
     \[
     2x + 20 = 36
     \]

4. **Solve for \( x \):**
   - Subtract 20 from both sides of the equation:
     \[
     2x = 36 - 20
     \]
     \[
     2x = 16
     \]
   - Divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( x \):
     \[
     x = \frac{16}{2}
     \]
     \[
     x = 8
     \]

5. **Calculate the Total Number of Books Wendy Needs to Carry:**
   - Substitute \( x = 8 \) back into the expression for the number of books:
     \[
     2x + 20 = 2(8) + 20
     \]
     \[
     = 16 + 20
     \]
     \[
     = 36
     \]

Thus, Wendy needs to carry a total of 36 books to complete her task.

**Final Answer:**
Wendy needs to carry 36 books.
