==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to determine how many books Wendy wants to place in her shelving system based on the information given.

1. **Understanding the shelving system**: The shelving system has 6 rows and 6 columns. To find the total number of spaces available for books, we calculate the total number of slots in the shelving system:
   \[
   \text{Total slots} = \text{Number of rows} \times \text{Number of columns} = 6 \times 6 = 36
   \]

2. **Defining the number of books**: According to the problem, Wendy wants to place "20 more than double the number of books." Let's denote the number of books she wants to carry as \( x \).

3. **Setting up the equation**: The phrase "20 more than double the number of books" can be expressed mathematically as:
   \[
   \text{Books Wendy wants} = 2x + 20
   \]

4. **Finding the number of books**: Since Wendy is placing these books in a shelving system that can hold a maximum of 36 books, we set up the inequality:
   \[
   2x + 20 \leq 36
   \]

5. **Solving the inequality**:
   - First, we subtract 20 from both sides:
   \[
   2x \leq 36 - 20
   \]
   \[
   2x \leq 16
   \]
   - Next, we divide both sides by 2:
   \[
   x \leq \frac{16}{2}
   \]
   \[
   x \leq 8
   \]

6. **Conclusion**: The maximum number of books Wendy can carry, based on the inequality we derived, is 8. 

7. **Calculating the total number of books she wants**: If \( x = 8 \), we can calculate how many books she wants to place:
   \[
   \text{Books Wendy wants} = 2(8) + 20 = 16 + 20 = 36
   \]

Since the total number of books she wants (36) matches the total capacity of the shelving system (36), she can indeed carry 8 books to fulfill her requirement.

Thus, the final answer is:
\[
\boxed{8}
\]
