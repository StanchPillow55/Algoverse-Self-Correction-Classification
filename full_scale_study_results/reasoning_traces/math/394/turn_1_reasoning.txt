Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine how many books Wendy needs to place in the shelving system. Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Understand the Shelving System:**
   - The shelving system has 6 rows and 6 columns.
   - Therefore, the total number of slots available in the shelving system is:
     \[
     6 \times 6 = 36 \text{ slots}
     \]

2. **Determine the Number of Books Wendy Wants to Place:**
   - Wendy wants to place "20 more than double the number of books" in the shelving system.
   - Let's denote the number of books she initially considers as \( x \).
   - Double the number of books is \( 2x \).
   - Adding 20 more books gives us:
     \[
     2x + 20
     \]

3. **Set Up the Equation:**
   - Since Wendy wants to fill the entire shelving system, the number of books she wants to place should equal the total number of slots available:
     \[
     2x + 20 = 36
     \]

4. **Solve for \( x \):**
   - First, subtract 20 from both sides of the equation to isolate the term with \( x \):
     \[
     2x + 20 - 20 = 36 - 20
     \]
     \[
     2x = 16
     \]

   - Next, divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( x \):
     \[
     x = \frac{16}{2} = 8
     \]

5. **Calculate the Total Number of Books:**
   - Now that we know \( x = 8 \), we can calculate the total number of books Wendy wants to place:
     \[
     2x + 20 = 2(8) + 20 = 16 + 20 = 36
     \]

6. **Conclusion:**
   - Wendy needs to carry a total of 36 books to complete her task of filling the shelving system.

Therefore, the final answer is that Wendy needs to carry **36 books**.
