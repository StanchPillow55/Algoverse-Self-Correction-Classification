Question ID: 1169
Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

Let's break down the problem step by step.

First, we know that Ronnie was given $5 and Rissa was given thrice as much. So, Rissa was given 3 * $5 = $15.

Next, we know that after giving some money to their little sister, Rissa is left with 4/5 of her money. This means that she gave away 1/5 of her money. 

So, Rissa gave away 1/5 * $15 = $3 to their little sister.

Since the problem states that Ronnie and Rissa gave an equal amount of money to their little sister, this means that Ronnie also gave away $3.

Finally, to find out how much money is left with Ronnie, we subtract the amount he gave away from the amount he was given. 

So, Ronnie is left with $5 - $3 = $2.

Therefore, Ronnie has $2 left.
