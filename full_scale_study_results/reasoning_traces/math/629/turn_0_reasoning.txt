Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, let's calculate the total cost of the cars that James sold. He sold 10 cars at $25,000 each, so the total cost is 10 * $25,000 = $250,000.

The company paid 30% of that price to acquire the cars. So, the cost to acquire the cars is 30/100 * $250,000 = $75,000.

The profit the company made is the selling price minus the cost to acquire the cars. So, the profit is $250,000 - $75,000 = $175,000.

James got a 10% commission on the profits. So, the amount he made is 10/100 * $175,000 = $17,500.

So, James made $17,500 from selling the cars.
