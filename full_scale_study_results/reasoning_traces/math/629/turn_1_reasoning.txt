Question ID: 629
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, let's calculate the total price of the cars sold by James. 

He sold 10 cars at $25,000 each, so the total price is 10 * $25,000 = $250,000.

Next, we need to calculate how much the company paid to acquire these cars. The company paid 30% of the selling price, so the cost is 30/100 * $250,000 = $75,000.

The profit made by the company on these cars is the selling price minus the cost price. So, the profit is $250,000 - $75,000 = $175,000.

James gets a 10% commission on this profit. So, the amount he made is 10/100 * $175,000 = $17,500.

So, James made $17,500 from selling these cars.
