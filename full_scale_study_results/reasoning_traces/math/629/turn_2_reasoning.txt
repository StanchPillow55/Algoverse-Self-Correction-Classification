Question ID: 629
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, let's calculate the total cost of the cars that James sold. He sold 10 cars at $25,000 each, so the total cost is 10 * $25,000 = $250,000.

Next, we need to find out how much the company paid to acquire these cars. The company paid 30% of the selling price to acquire the cars, so the total acquisition cost is 30% of $250,000. To calculate this, we multiply $250,000 by 30/100 (or 0.3), which gives us $75,000.

The profit the company made on these cars is the selling price minus the acquisition cost. So, the profit is $250,000 - $75,000 = $175,000.

James gets a 10% commission on the profits. To calculate this, we multiply $175,000 by 10/100 (or 0.1), which gives us $17,500.

So, James made $17,500 from selling these cars.

Final Answer: James made $17,500.
