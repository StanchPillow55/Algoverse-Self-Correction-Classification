==================================================

The problem states that the amount of water passing through the river at one point in time is 4000 gallons. 

After a day of heavy rain, the amount of water passing through the river doubles. This means that the amount of water passing through the river after the heavy rain is 2 * 4000 = 8000 gallons.

On the third day, the volume of water passing through the river at that point increases by 6000 gallons. This means that the total amount of water passing through the river on the third day is 8000 + 6000 = 14000 gallons.

So, the total amount of water passing through the river at that point after the three days is 14000 gallons.
