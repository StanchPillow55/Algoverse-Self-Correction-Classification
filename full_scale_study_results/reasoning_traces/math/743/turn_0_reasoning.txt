Question ID: 743
Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

Mara initially had 2 slices of cake on her plate. She added 3 more slices, so the total number of slices became 2 + 3 = 5 slices.

Feeling hungrier, she tripled the number of slices on her plate. So, the total number of slices became 5 * 3 = 15 slices.

After eating 2 slices, the number of slices left on the plate became 15 - 2 = 13 slices.

Then, her friend stole 5 slices from her plate, leaving her with 13 - 5 = 8 slices.

So, the final number of cake slices remaining on the plate is 8.
