Question ID: 1260
Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to find out how many photos Jade can upload in one day. Since she uploads 7 photos in one batch and she uploads 6 batches each day, we can multiply these two numbers together to find out how many photos she can upload in one day.

7 photos/batch * 6 batches/day = 42 photos/day

Next, we need to find out how many days it will take for her to upload all 210 photos. To do this, we can divide the total number of photos by the number of photos she can upload in one day.

210 photos / 42 photos/day = 5 days

Therefore, it will take Jade 5 days to upload all of her photos.
