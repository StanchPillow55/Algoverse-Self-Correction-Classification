==================================================

Let's denote the number of spoons in the package that Julia bought as x.

According to the problem, Julia's husband bought 5 spoons and gave them to Julia. So, the total number of spoons Julia had before she used any was x + 5.

Then, Julia used 3 spoons to sample her stew. So, the number of spoons she had left was (x + 5) - 3.

Finally, we know that after using the spoons, Julia had 12 spoons left. So, we can set up the equation (x + 5) - 3 = 12 to find the value of x.

Solving the equation, we get:

x + 5 - 3 = 12
x + 2 = 12
x = 12 - 2
x = 10

So, the package that Julia bought contained 10 spoons.
