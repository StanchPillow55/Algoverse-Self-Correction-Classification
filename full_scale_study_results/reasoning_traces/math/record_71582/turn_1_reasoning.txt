Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to find the placeholder for the event name mentioned in the query.

Given information:
- The event is the New Hampshire Democratic Party's Jefferson-Jackson Dinner.
- Normally, 400-450 Democrats attend the dinner, but this year at least 1,200 Democrats have tickets.

The placeholder in the query is "@placeholder".

To find the placeholder, we need to replace it with the name of the event mentioned in the passage.

Final answer:
With news of his headlining appearance, 1,200 people have purchased tickets to the New Hampshire Democratic Party's Jefferson-Jackson Dinner, the biggest crowd since the state party revived it as a fall fundraising event in 1991.
