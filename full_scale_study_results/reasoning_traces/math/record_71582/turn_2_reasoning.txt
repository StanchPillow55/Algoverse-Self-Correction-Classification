Question ID: record_71582
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to find the placeholder for the event name mentioned in the query.

Given information:
- The event is the New Hampshire Democratic Party's Jefferson-Jackson Dinner.
- Normally, 400-450 Democrats attend the dinner.
- This year, at least 1,200 Democrats have purchased tickets, which is the biggest crowd since the state party revived the event as a fall fundraising event in 1991.

Therefore, the placeholder in the query should be "Jefferson-Jackson Dinner".
