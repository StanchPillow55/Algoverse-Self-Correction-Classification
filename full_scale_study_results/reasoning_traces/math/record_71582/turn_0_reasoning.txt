To solve this problem, we need to find the name of the event that Bill Clinton is speaking at, which is mentioned in the passage as the placeholder.

Given information:
- Bill Clinton is speaking at the New Hampshire Democratic Party's Jefferson-Jackson Dinner on Thursday.
- Normally, 400-450 Democrats attend the dinner, but this year at least 1,200 Democrats have tickets.

The placeholder in the query is the name of the event that Bill Clinton is speaking at, which is the New Hampshire Democratic Party's Jefferson-Jackson Dinner.

Therefore, the final answer is:
