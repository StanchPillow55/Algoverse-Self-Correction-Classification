Question ID: 91
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

Step 1: Determine the number of pets Marcia has

The problem states that Marcia has two more pets than Cindy. Since Cindy has four pets, we can calculate the number of pets Marcia has by adding two to Cindy's total.

Marcia's pets = Cindy's pets + 2
Marcia's pets = 4 + 2
Marcia's pets = 6

Step 2: Determine the number of pets Jan has

The problem states that Jan has three times the number of pets as Marcia. Now that we know Marcia has six pets, we can calculate the number of pets Jan has by multiplying Marcia's total by three.

Jan's pets = Marcia's pets * 3
Jan's pets = 6 * 3
Jan's pets = 18

Step 3: Calculate the total number of pets

Now that we know how many pets each person has, we can calculate the total number of pets by adding together the number of pets each person has.

Total pets = Cindy's pets + Marcia's pets + Jan's pets
Total pets = 4 + 6 + 18
Total pets = 28

So, the three of them have a total of 28 pets.
