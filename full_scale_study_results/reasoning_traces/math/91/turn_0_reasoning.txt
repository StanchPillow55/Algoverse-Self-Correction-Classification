Question ID: 91
Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to find out how many pets Marcia has. Since the problem states that Marcia has two more pets than Cindy, and Cindy has four pets, we can calculate the number of pets Marcia has by adding two to the number of pets Cindy has.

Marcia's pets = Cindy's pets + 2
Marcia's pets = 4 + 2 = 6 pets

Next, we need to find out how many pets Jan has. The problem states that Jan has three times the number of pets as Marcia. So, we can calculate the number of pets Jan has by multiplying the number of pets Marcia has by three.

Jan's pets = Marcia's pets * 3
Jan's pets = 6 * 3 = 18 pets

Finally, to find out the total number of pets the three have, we add the number of pets each person has.

Total pets = Cindy's pets + Marcia's pets + Jan's pets
Total pets = 4 + 6 + 18 = 28 pets

So, the three of them together have 28 pets.
