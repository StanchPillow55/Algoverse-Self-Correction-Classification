==================================================

Let's break this problem down step by step.

First, we know that the program had 60 downloads in the first month.

Second, the number of downloads in the second month was three times as many as the downloads in the first month. So, we multiply 60 by 3 to find the number of downloads in the second month:

60 * 3 = 180 downloads in the second month.

Third, the number of downloads in the third month reduced by 30% from the second month. To find this, we need to calculate 30% of 180 and then subtract that from 180:

30% of 180 = 0.30 * 180 = 54 downloads reduction.

So, the number of downloads in the third month is 180 - 54 = 126 downloads.

Finally, to find the total number of downloads over the three months, we add the number of downloads from each month:

60 (first month) + 180 (second month) + 126 (third month) = 366 downloads total.

So, the program had a total of 366 downloads over the three months.
