Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, let's calculate how long it will take Emily to peel 90 shrimp. 

Emily can peel 6 shrimp in 1 minute. Therefore, to peel 90 shrimp, she will need 90 shrimp / 6 shrimp/minute = 15 minutes.

Next, let's calculate how long it will take Emily to sauté 90 shrimp. 

Emily can sauté 30 shrimp in 10 minutes. Therefore, to sauté 90 shrimp, she will need 90 shrimp / 30 shrimp/10 minutes = 30 minutes.

However, it's important to note that Emily can sauté the shrimp while she is peeling the rest. So, after 10 minutes, she can start sautéing the first 30 shrimps while peeling the next 30 shrimps. This will take another 10 minutes. Then, she can sauté the second batch of 30 shrimps while peeling the last 30 shrimps, which will take another 10 minutes. Finally, she can sauté the last 30 shrimps, which will take another 10 minutes. 

So, in total, it will take Emily 10 minutes + 10 minutes + 10 minutes + 10 minutes = 40 minutes to peel and cook 90 shrimp. 

Therefore, the final answer is 40 minutes.
