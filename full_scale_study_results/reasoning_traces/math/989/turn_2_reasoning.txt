Question ID: 989
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, let's calculate how long it will take Emily to peel 90 shrimp. 

Emily can peel 6 shrimp in a minute. Therefore, to peel 90 shrimp, she will need 90 shrimp / 6 shrimp per minute = 15 minutes.

Next, let's calculate how long it will take Emily to saute 90 shrimp. 

Emily can saute 30 shrimp in 10 minutes. Therefore, to saute 90 shrimp, she will need 90 shrimp / 30 shrimp per 10 minutes = 30 minutes.

Finally, we add the time it takes to peel the shrimp and the time it takes to saute the shrimp to find the total time Emily will spend.

So, 15 minutes (peeling) + 30 minutes (sauteing) = 45 minutes.

Therefore, it will take Emily 45 minutes to peel and cook 90 shrimp.
