Question ID: 989
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, let's determine how long it will take Emily to peel 90 shrimp. 

Emily can peel 6 shrimp in 1 minute. Therefore, to find out how long it will take her to peel 90 shrimp, we divide 90 by 6. 

90 รท 6 = 15 minutes

So, it will take Emily 15 minutes to peel 90 shrimp.

Next, let's determine how long it will take Emily to saute 90 shrimp. 

Emily can saute 30 shrimp in 10 minutes. Therefore, to find out how long it will take her to saute 90 shrimp, we divide 90 by 30 and then multiply the result by 10. 

(90 รท 30) x 10 = 30 minutes

So, it will take Emily 30 minutes to saute 90 shrimp.

Finally, to find out how long it will take Emily to peel and cook 90 shrimp, we add the time it takes her to peel the shrimp to the time it takes her to saute the shrimp. 

15 minutes (peeling) + 30 minutes (sauteing) = 45 minutes

Therefore, it will take Emily 45 minutes to peel and cook 90 shrimp.
