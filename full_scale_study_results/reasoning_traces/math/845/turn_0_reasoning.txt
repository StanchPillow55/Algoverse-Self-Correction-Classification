==================================================

The problem states that there are 20 students in Miss Susan's class. Of these, 5 are good at math only and 8 are good at English only. 

To find out how many students are good at both math and English, we subtract the number of students who are good at only one subject from the total number of students. 

So, we have 20 students in total, minus 5 who are good at math only, and minus 8 who are good at English only. 

This calculation is as follows: 

20 (total students) - 5 (math only) - 8 (English only) = 7 students 

So, there are 7 students who are good at both math and English. 

To find out how many students are good at math, we add the number of students who are good at math only to the number of students who are good at both math and English. 

This calculation is as follows: 

5 (math only) + 7 (both subjects) = 12 students 

So, there are 12 students who are good at math. 

Therefore, the final answer is 12 students.
