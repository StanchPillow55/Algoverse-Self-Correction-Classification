==================================================

Let's denote the total amount of land Mr. Ruther had at first as X hectares. 

According to the problem, Mr. Ruther sold 3/5 of his land, which means he kept 1 - 3/5 = 2/5 of his land. 

We know that this remaining 2/5 of his land is equal to 12.8 hectares. 

So, we can set up the equation: 

2/5 * X = 12.8 

To solve for X, we need to isolate X on one side of the equation. We can do this by dividing both sides of the equation by 2/5, which is the same as multiplying by the reciprocal, 5/2. 

So, X = 12.8 * 5/2 = 32 hectares 

So, Mr. Ruther originally had 32 hectares of land.
