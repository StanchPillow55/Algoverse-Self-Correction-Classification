Question ID: 384
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to understand that the 12.8 hectares of land Mr. Ruther has left is the remaining 2/5 (since 1 - 3/5 = 2/5) of his original land.

Let's denote the original amount of land as X. 

We know that 2/5 of X is equal to 12.8 hectares. We can express this as a simple equation:

(2/5)X = 12.8

To solve for X, we need to isolate X on one side of the equation. We can do this by dividing both sides of the equation by 2/5. 

Remember that dividing by a fraction is the same as multiplying by its reciprocal. The reciprocal of 2/5 is 5/2. So, we multiply both sides of the equation by 5/2:

X = 12.8 * (5/2)

X = 32 hectares

So, Mr. Ruther originally had 32 hectares of land.
