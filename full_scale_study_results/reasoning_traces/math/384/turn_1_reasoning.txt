Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to understand that the 12.8 hectares of land Mr. Ruther has left is the remaining 2/5 of his original land. 

Let's denote the original amount of land as X. 

According to the problem, we know that 2/5 of X equals 12.8 hectares. We can write this as an equation:

(2/5)X = 12.8

To solve for X, we need to isolate X on one side of the equation. We can do this by multiplying both sides of the equation by the reciprocal of 2/5, which is 5/2:

X = 12.8 * (5/2)

Performing the multiplication gives:

X = 32 hectares

So, Mr. Ruther originally had 32 hectares of land.
