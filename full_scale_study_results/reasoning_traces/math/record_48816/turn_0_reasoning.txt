To solve this problem, we need to determine the placeholder in the given query.

Given information:
- The passage mentions that Nancy Dunsavage Fiedler, 57, of Incline Village, Nevada, was arrested on suspicion of abducting her daughter, Eva Marie Fiedler, during a custody struggle more than 25 years ago.
- The query states that "Investigators in @placeholder have not interviewed her yet, he said, and are awaiting a request to do so from New Jersey."

The placeholder in the query refers to the location where the investigators have not interviewed Nancy Fiedler yet.

Based on the information provided in the passage, the location where Nancy Fiedler was arrested is Incline Village, Nevada.

Therefore, the placeholder in the query should be "Incline Village, Nevada".

Final answer:
Investigators in Incline Village, Nevada have not interviewed her yet, he said, and are awaiting a request to do so from New Jersey.
