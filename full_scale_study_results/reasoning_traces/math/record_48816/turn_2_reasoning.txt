Question ID: record_48816
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine the placeholder value in the given query.

Given information:
- The passage mentions that the former New Jersey woman, Nancy Dunsavage Fiedler, was arrested in Nevada on suspicion of abducting her daughter more than 25 years ago.
- The query states that "Investigators in @placeholder have not interviewed her yet, he said, and are awaiting a request to do so from New Jersey."

To find the placeholder value, we need to determine the location where the investigators have not interviewed the woman yet.

Based on the information provided in the passage, the woman was arrested in Incline Village, Nevada. Therefore, the placeholder value should be "Nevada".

Final answer: Nevada
