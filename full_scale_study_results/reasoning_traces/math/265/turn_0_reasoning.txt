First, let's calculate the brokerage fee and the transfer fee.

The brokerage fee is 5% of the selling price. We can calculate this by multiplying the selling price by 5% (or 0.05 in decimal form):

$350,000 * 0.05 = $17,500

The transfer fee is 12% of the selling price. We can calculate this by multiplying the selling price by 12% (or 0.12 in decimal form):

$350,000 * 0.12 = $42,000

Now, let's add these fees to the selling price to find the total price of the house:

$350,000 (selling price) + $17,500 (brokerage fee) + $42,000 (transfer fee) = $409,500

So, the total price of the house is $409,500.

Finally, let's subtract Mrs. Cruz's budget from the total price of the house to find out how much more the house costs than her budget:

$409,500 (total price) - $400,000 (budget) = $9,500

Therefore, the total price of the house is $9,500 more than Mrs. Cruz's budget.
