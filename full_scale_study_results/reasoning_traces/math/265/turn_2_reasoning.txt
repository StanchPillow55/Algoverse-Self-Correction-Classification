Question ID: 265
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to calculate the brokerage fee and the transfer fee.

The brokerage fee is 5% of the selling price. To calculate this, we multiply the selling price by 5% (or 0.05).

350,000 * 0.05 = 17,500

The transfer fee is 12% of the selling price. To calculate this, we multiply the selling price by 12% (or 0.12).

350,000 * 0.12 = 42,000

Next, we add the selling price, the brokerage fee, and the transfer fee to get the total price of the house.

350,000 + 17,500 + 42,000 = 409,500

The total price of the house is $409,500.

To find out how much more this is than Mrs. Cruz's budget, we subtract her budget from the total price.

409,500 - 400,000 = 9,500

Therefore, the total price of the house is $9,500 more than Mrs. Cruz's budget.
