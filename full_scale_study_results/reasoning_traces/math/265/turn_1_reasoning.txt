Question ID: 265
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, let's calculate the brokerage fee and the transfer fee.

The brokerage fee is 5% of the selling price. To calculate this, we multiply the selling price by 5% (or 0.05):

$350,000 * 0.05 = $17,500

The transfer fee is 12% of the selling price. To calculate this, we multiply the selling price by 12% (or 0.12):

$350,000 * 0.12 = $42,000

Next, we add the selling price, the brokerage fee, and the transfer fee to get the total price of the house:

$350,000 + $17,500 + $42,000 = $409,500

Now, we subtract Mrs. Cruz's budget from the total price of the house to find out how much more the house costs than her budget:

$409,500 - $400,000 = $9,500

So, the total price of the house is $9,500 more than Mrs. Cruz's budget.
