Question ID: 1089
Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to find out the height from which Nathan drops the ball. Since each story is 24 feet high and he drops it from the third floor, the initial height is 3 * 24 = 72 feet.

The ball bounces to 2/3rds of its starting height with each bounce. So, after the first bounce, the ball reaches a height of 2/3 * 72 = 48 feet.

After the second bounce, the ball reaches a height of 2/3 * 48 = 32 feet.

So, the ball goes up to a height of 32 feet on its second bounce.
