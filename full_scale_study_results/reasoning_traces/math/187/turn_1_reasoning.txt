==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount Mandy owes Benedict after 3 months, taking into account the 2% monthly interest.

First, let's understand how the interest works. The 2% interest is applied to the remaining balance each month. This means that the amount of money Mandy owes Benedict increases by 2% each month.

Let's calculate it step by step:

1. After the first month, the amount Mandy owes is $100 + $100 * 2/100 = $100 + $2 = $102. 

2. After the second month, the amount Mandy owes is $102 + $102 * 2/100 = $102 + $2.04 = $104.04.

3. After the third month, the amount Mandy owes is $104.04 + $104.04 * 2/100 = $104.04 + $2.08 = $106.12.

So, if Mandy was able to pay it after 3 months, she should give Benedict $106.12.
