The problem involves calculating compound interest over a period of 3 months. The formula for compound interest is:

A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt)

where:
A = the amount of money accumulated after n years, including interest.
P = the principal amount (the initial amount of money)
r = annual interest rate (in decimal)
n = number of times that interest is compounded per year
t = time the money is invested for in years

In this problem, Mandy owes Benedict $100 (P = 100), the monthly interest rate is 2% (r = 0.02), the interest is compounded monthly (n = 12), and the time is 3 months (t = 3/12 = 0.25 years).

Substituting these values into the formula, we get:

A = 100(1 + 0.02/12)^(12*0.25)

Solving inside the parentheses first:

1 + 0.02/12 = 1.00166667

Then raising this to the power of (12*0.25):

(1.00166667)^(12*0.25) = 1.00499226

Finally, multiplying this by the principal amount:

100 * 1.00499226 = 100.499226

So, Mandy should give Benedict approximately $100.50 after 3 months.
