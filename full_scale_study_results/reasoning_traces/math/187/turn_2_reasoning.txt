==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to understand how interest works. In this case, Mandy owes Benedict $100 with a monthly interest rate of 2%. This means that for each month that Mandy does not pay Benedict, the amount she owes increases by 2%.

Let's calculate how much Mandy owes each month:

1st month: 
The initial amount is $100. The interest for the first month is 2% of $100, which is $2. Therefore, at the end of the first month, Mandy owes Benedict $100 + $2 = $102.

2nd month: 
Now, the initial amount is $102. The interest for the second month is 2% of $102, which is $2.04. Therefore, at the end of the second month, Mandy owes Benedict $102 + $2.04 = $104.04.

3rd month: 
Now, the initial amount is $104.04. The interest for the third month is 2% of $104.04, which is approximately $2.08. Therefore, at the end of the third month, Mandy owes Benedict $104.04 + $2.08 = $106.12.

So, if Mandy pays Benedict after 3 months, she should give him $106.12.
