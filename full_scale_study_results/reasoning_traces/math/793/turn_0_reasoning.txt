Dataset Type: math
==================================================

Jamie's regular hourly rate is $20 per hour. She worked for 8 hours at this rate, so she earned 20 * 8 = $<<20*8=160>>160 for these hours.

If she works more than 8 hours, she gets paid 150% of her regular hourly rate. This means she gets paid 20 * 1.5 = $<<20*1.5=30>>30 per hour for the additional hours.

On Tuesday, she worked 11 hours, which is 11 - 8 = 3 hours more than her regular 8 hours.

For these 3 hours, she was paid 3 * 30 = $<<3*30=90>>90.

So, for the entire day, she was paid 160 + 90 = $<<160+90=250>>250.

Therefore, Jamie was paid $250 for her work on Tuesday.
