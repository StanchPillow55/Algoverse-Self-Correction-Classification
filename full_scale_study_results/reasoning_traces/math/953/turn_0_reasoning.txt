==================================================

Kim usually sleeps from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m., which is a total of 8 hours. 

To convert these hours into minutes, we multiply by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour). 

8 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 480 minutes 

Kim was sleepwalking from 2:15 to 2:38 am, which is a total of 23 minutes. 

To find out how many minutes she was actually sleeping on her bed, we subtract the time she was sleepwalking from the total time she usually sleeps. 

480 minutes - 23 minutes = 457 minutes 

However, Kim also woke up 5 minutes earlier than usual to go to the bathroom. So we need to subtract these 5 minutes from the total time she was sleeping. 

457 minutes - 5 minutes = 452 minutes 

So, Kim slept on her bed for 452 minutes that day. 

Final Answer: Kim slept on her bed for 452 minutes that day.
