Question ID: 80
Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, let's find out how much water the two girls got.

Each girl got 1/6 of the 24 liters of water. So, to find out how much water each girl got, we multiply 24 liters by 1/6:

24 liters * 1/6 = 4 liters

Since there are two girls, we multiply the amount one girl got by 2:

4 liters * 2 = 8 liters

So, the two girls got a total of 8 liters of water.

Next, we know that a boy got 6 liters of water. 

To find out how much water is left, we subtract the amount the girls and the boy got from the total amount of water:

24 liters - 8 liters - 6 liters = 10 liters

So, there are 10 liters of water left.
