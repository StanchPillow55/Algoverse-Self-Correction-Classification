Dataset Type: math
==================================================

The Doubtfire sisters initially adopted 7 kittens from the local animal shelter.

According to their mother, Patchy, their first house cat, has had thrice the number of adopted kittens. This means Patchy has had 3 * 7 = <<3*7=21>>21 kittens.

Trixie, their other house cat, has had 12 kittens.

To find the total number of kittens the Doubtfire family now has, we add the number of kittens from each source: the adopted kittens, the kittens from Patchy, and the kittens from Trixie.

So, the total number of kittens is 7 (adopted kittens) + 21 (kittens from Patchy) + 12 (kittens from Trixie) = <<7+21+12=40>>40 kittens.

Therefore, the Doubtfire family now has 40 kittens.
