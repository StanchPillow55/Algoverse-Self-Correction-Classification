==================================================

The first step is to determine the cost price of each watermelon. The vendor bought 50 watermelons for $80, so the cost price of each watermelon is $80/50 = $1.60.

Next, we need to calculate the selling price of each watermelon. The vendor made a profit of 25% on each watermelon. This means that the selling price is 125% of the cost price. 

To calculate this, we first convert the percentage to a decimal by dividing by 100, giving us 1.25. We then multiply this by the cost price to find the selling price: $1.60 * 1.25 = $2.00.

Therefore, each watermelon was sold for $2.00.
