Question ID: 977
Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to find out how many hours Pamela will be outside in total. She will be outside for 4 hours each day, and she will be outside for 8 days. So, we multiply the number of hours per day by the number of days to find the total hours:

4 hours/day * 8 days = 32 hours

Next, we know that Pamela uses 1 ounce of sunscreen each hour she is outside. So, we multiply the total hours by the amount of sunscreen used per hour to find the total amount of sunscreen needed:

32 hours * 1 ounce/hour = 32 ounces

Finally, we know that each bottle of sunscreen contains 8 ounces. So, we divide the total amount of sunscreen needed by the amount of sunscreen per bottle to find the number of bottles needed:

32 ounces รท 8 ounces/bottle = 4 bottles

So, Pamela will need to pack 4 bottles of sunscreen for her vacation.
