==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine how many cups of flour Carla will need to make the cookies today and tomorrow. Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Step 1: Determine the flour needed for today's cookies

Carla is making 36 cookies today. We know that 2 cups of flour are needed to make a dozen (12) cookies. First, we need to calculate how many dozens of cookies Carla is making today:

\[
\text{Number of dozens today} = \frac{36 \text{ cookies}}{12 \text{ cookies/dozen}} = 3 \text{ dozens}
\]

Since 2 cups of flour are needed per dozen cookies, the amount of flour needed for today's cookies is:

\[
\text{Flour needed today} = 3 \text{ dozens} \times 2 \text{ cups/dozen} = 6 \text{ cups}
\]

### Step 2: Determine the flour needed for tomorrow's cookies

Carla is making 30 cookies tomorrow. Again, we calculate how many dozens of cookies this represents:

\[
\text{Number of dozens tomorrow} = \frac{30 \text{ cookies}}{12 \text{ cookies/dozen}} = 2.5 \text{ dozens}
\]

Using the same rate of 2 cups of flour per dozen cookies, the amount of flour needed for tomorrow's cookies is:

\[
\text{Flour needed tomorrow} = 2.5 \text{ dozens} \times 2 \text{ cups/dozen} = 5 \text{ cups}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the total flour needed

Now, we add the flour needed for today and tomorrow to find the total amount of flour Carla will need:

\[
\text{Total flour needed} = \text{Flour needed today} + \text{Flour needed tomorrow} = 6 \text{ cups} + 5 \text{ cups} = 11 \text{ cups}
\]

### Final Answer

Carla will need a total of 11 cups of flour to bake the cookies today and tomorrow.
