Question ID: 260
Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, let's determine how many cups of flour are needed for one cookie. If two cups of flour are needed for a dozen cookies, then to find the amount of flour needed for one cookie, we divide the number of cups by the number of cookies:

2 cups รท 12 cookies = 0.167 cups/cookie

Next, we need to find out how many cups of flour Carla will need for 36 cookies today. We multiply the number of cookies by the amount of flour needed for one cookie:

36 cookies * 0.167 cups/cookie = 6 cups

Then, we need to find out how many cups of flour Carla will need for 30 cookies tomorrow. We again multiply the number of cookies by the amount of flour needed for one cookie:

30 cookies * 0.167 cups/cookie = 5 cups

Finally, we add the amount of flour needed for today and tomorrow:

6 cups + 5 cups = 11 cups

So, Carla will need 11 cups of flour to bake the cookies today and tomorrow.
