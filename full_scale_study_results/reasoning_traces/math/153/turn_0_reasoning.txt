==================================================

Let's start from the end of the problem and work our way back to the beginning.

We know that there were 5 fries left after the ants carried off one. So before the ants came, there were 5 + 1 = 6 fries.

Before the raccoon came, there were more fries. We know the raccoon ate two thirds of the fries, so the remaining one third was 6 fries. To find the total before the raccoon came, we can set up the equation 1/3 * x = 6, where x is the total number of fries. Solving for x, we get x = 6 * 3 = 18 fries.

Before the pigeons came, there were more fries. Each pigeon ate 3 fries, and there were 3 pigeons, so they ate 3 * 3 = 9 fries in total. So before the pigeons came, there were 18 + 9 = 27 fries.

Before the seagull came, there were more fries. The seagull ate half the amount that Dave ate, and we know Dave ate 14 fries. So the seagull ate 14 / 2 = 7 fries. So before the seagull came, there were 27 + 7 = 34 fries.

Finally, before Dave started eating, there were more fries. Dave ate 14 fries, so before he started eating, there were 34 + 14 = 48 fries.

So, the pack of french fries that Dave bought had 48 fries in it.
