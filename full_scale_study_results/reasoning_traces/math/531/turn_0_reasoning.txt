Let's solve this problem step by step.

Step 1: 
We start with 48 passengers on the bus. On the first stop, 8 passengers get off. So, we subtract 8 from 48. 

48 - 8 = 40 passengers remain on the bus.

Step 2: 
Then, 5 times as many people as the number who got off from the bus get into the bus. Since 8 people got off, 5 times that number would be 5 * 8 = 40 people get on the bus.

So, we add 40 to the number of passengers remaining on the bus after the first stop.

40 + 40 = 80 passengers are on the bus after the first stop.

Step 3: 
On the second stop, 21 passengers get off. So, we subtract 21 from 80.

80 - 21 = 59 passengers remain on the bus.

Step 4: 
Then, 3 times fewer passengers get on than got off. Since 21 people got off, 21 divided by 3 equals 7 people get on the bus.

So, we add 7 to the number of passengers remaining on the bus after the second stop.

59 + 7 = 66 passengers are on the bus after the second stop.

So, the final answer is 66 passengers.
