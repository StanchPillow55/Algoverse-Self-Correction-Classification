Question ID: 185
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we first need to find out how many apples Jenna picked. The problem states that Jenna picked half as many apples as her mom. Since her mom picked 20 apples, Jenna picked half of that amount. 

To find half of a number, we divide that number by 2. So, Jenna picked 20 รท 2 = 10 apples.

Now, to find out how many apples they both picked, we add the number of apples Jenna picked to the number of apples her mom picked. 

So, the total number of apples they both picked is 10 (Jenna's apples) + 20 (mom's apples) = 30 apples.

Therefore, Jenna and her mom picked a total of 30 apples.
