Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

Jenna picked half as many apples as her mom. This means she picked 1/2 * 20 = <<1/2*20=10>>10 apples.

To find the total number of apples they both picked, we add the number of apples Jenna picked to the number of apples her mom picked. 

So, 10 (Jenna's apples) + 20 (mom's apples) = 30 apples.

Therefore, Jenna and her mom picked a total of 30 apples.
