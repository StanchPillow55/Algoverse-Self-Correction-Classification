Question ID: record_6818
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of lives claimed by Hurricane Sandy across the region.

Given information:
- Hurricane Sandy claimed at least 67 lives.
- 51 of those lives were in Haiti.

Step 1: Find the number of lives claimed by Hurricane Sandy outside of Haiti.
Total lives claimed - Lives claimed in Haiti = Lives claimed outside of Haiti
67 - 51 = 16 lives claimed outside of Haiti

Therefore, the final answer is that Hurricane Sandy claimed at least 67 lives, with 51 of those in Haiti and 16 lives claimed outside of Haiti.
