Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of lives claimed by Hurricane Sandy across the affected regions.

Given information:
- Hurricane Sandy could affect as many as 60 million people across the eastern U.S.
- The query states that Hurricane Sandy claimed at least 67 lives, 51 in Haiti, as it crossed the region last week.

Step 1: Find the total number of lives claimed by Hurricane Sandy.
Total lives claimed = Lives claimed in Haiti + Lives claimed in other regions
Total lives claimed = 51 + (at least 67 - 51)
Total lives claimed = 51 + 16
Total lives claimed = 67

Therefore, the total number of lives claimed by Hurricane Sandy is at least 67.

Final answer: Hurricane Sandy claimed at least 67 lives across the affected regions.
