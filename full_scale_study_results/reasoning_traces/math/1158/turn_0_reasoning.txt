Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, let's determine how many bottles of juice are needed to satisfy 100% of one person's daily energy needs. Since one bottle of juice covers 20% of the daily energy demand, we would need 5 bottles to cover 100% (since 100% / 20% = 5).

Next, let's calculate how many bottles are needed to satisfy the daily energy needs of 2300 people. We do this by multiplying the number of people by the number of bottles needed per person, which gives us 2300 people * 5 bottles/person = 11500 bottles.

Now, we need to determine how many more bottles Hortex would need to produce to meet this demand. We do this by subtracting the number of bottles they currently produce from the total number of bottles needed. This gives us 11500 bottles - 4200 bottles = 7300 bottles.

Therefore, Hortex would need to produce 7300 more bottles of juice to be able to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people.
