Question ID: 1158
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, let's determine how many bottles of juice are needed to satisfy 100% of one person's daily energy needs. Since one bottle of juice covers 20% of a person's daily energy needs, we would need 5 bottles to cover 100% (since 100% รท 20% = 5).

Next, we need to calculate how many bottles are needed to satisfy 2300 people's daily energy needs. We do this by multiplying the number of people by the number of bottles needed per person. So, 2300 people x 5 bottles/person = 11500 bottles.

Currently, Hortex produces 4200 bottles of juice per day. To find out how many more bottles they need to produce, we subtract the current production from the required production. So, 11500 bottles - 4200 bottles = 7300 bottles.

Therefore, Hortex would need to produce 7300 more bottles of juice to be able to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people.
