Question ID: 1158
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, let's determine how many bottles of juice are needed to satisfy 100% of one person's daily energy needs. Since one bottle covers 20% of the daily energy demand, we would need 5 bottles to cover 100% (because 100% รท 20% = 5).

Next, we need to calculate how many bottles are needed for 2300 people. We multiply the number of people by the number of bottles needed per person, which is 5. So, 2300 people ร 5 bottles/person = 11500 bottles.

The Hortex company currently produces 4200 bottles per day. To find out how many more bottles they need to produce, we subtract the current production from the total needed. So, 11500 bottles - 4200 bottles = 7300 bottles.

Therefore, the Hortex company would need to produce 7300 more bottles of juice to be able to satisfy 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people.
