Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to find the time it took the holidaymaker to reach the resort he wanted to, given the information provided in the passage.

Given information:
- British holidaymakers are stranded in Austrian ski resorts due to heavy snowfalls.
- Some holidaymakers are four days overdue to be back home and back at work.
- As much as 18 feet of snow has fallen over the past few days.
- The passage mentions that the holidaymaker flew into a certain location on Saturday and only reached the resort he wanted to.

Step 1: Identify the missing information in the question.
The question asks to find the time it took the holidaymaker to reach the resort he wanted to, but the location he flew into is not provided. We need to find the missing placeholder in the question.

Step 2: Analyze the passage for clues about the location the holidaymaker flew into.
The passage mentions that British holidaymakers are stranded in Austrian ski resorts, and it provides the names of two specific locations: Ischgl and Galtuer. However, the question does not specify which resort the holidaymaker flew into.
