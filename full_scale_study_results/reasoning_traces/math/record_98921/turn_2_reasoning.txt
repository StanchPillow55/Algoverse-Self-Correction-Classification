Question ID: record_98921
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to find the time it took the holidaymaker to reach the resort he wanted to, given the information provided in the passage.

Given information:
- British holidaymakers are stranded in Austrian ski resorts due to heavy snowfall.
- Some holidaymakers are four days overdue to be back home and back at work.
- The passage mentions that the holidaymaker "flew into @placeholder on Saturday and only reached the resort he wanted to".

To find the time it took the holidaymaker to reach the resort, we need to make the following assumptions:
1. The holidaymaker flew into the airport on Saturday.
2. The resort the holidaymaker wanted to reach was affected by the heavy snowfall.
3. The heavy snowfall and resulting road blockages caused the delay in reaching the resort.

Step 1: Determine the day the holidaymaker reached the resort.
Since the passage states that the holidaymaker is "four days overdue to be back home and back at work", we can infer that the holidaymaker reached the resort on Wednesday.

Step 2: Calculate the time it took the holidaymaker to reach the resort
