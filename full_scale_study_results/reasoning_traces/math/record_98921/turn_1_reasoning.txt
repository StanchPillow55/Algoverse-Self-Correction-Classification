==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to find the resort the holidaymaker wanted to reach and the time it took him to get there.

Given information:
- The holidaymaker flew into a certain airport on Saturday.
- The holidaymaker only reached the resort he wanted to on a later day.

Step 1: Identify the airport the holidaymaker flew into.
The passage does not provide the specific airport the holidaymaker flew into. The passage only mentions "British holidaymakers" being stranded in the Austrian ski resorts, so we can assume the holidaymaker flew into an airport in Austria.

Step 2: Determine the resort the holidaymaker wanted to reach.
The passage mentions several ski resorts in Austria, such as Ischgl and Galtuer, that were affected by the heavy snowfall. However, the passage does not specify which resort the particular holidaymaker wanted to reach.

Step 3: Calculate the time it took the holidaymaker to reach the resort.
Since the passage states that the holidaymaker "only reached the resort he wanted to" on a later day, we can infer that it took him more than one day to reach the
