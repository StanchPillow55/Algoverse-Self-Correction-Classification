Question ID: 1069
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine how many trucks successfully delivered their loads of fertilizer and then calculate the total amount of fertilizer delivered.

1. **Determine the total number of trucks dispatched:**
   Mr. Hezekiah dispatched 20 trucks.

2. **Calculate the number of trucks that had mechanical failures:**
   We are told that a quarter of the trucks had mechanical failures. To find a quarter of the trucks, we calculate:
   \[
   \frac{1}{4} \times 20 = 5
   \]
   So, 5 trucks had mechanical failures and could not deliver the fertilizer.

3. **Calculate the number of trucks that successfully delivered the fertilizer:**
   Since 5 trucks had mechanical failures, the number of trucks that successfully delivered the fertilizer is:
   \[
   20 - 5 = 15
   \]

4. **Determine the amount of fertilizer each truck was carrying:**
   Each truck was carrying 20 tons of fertilizer.

5. **Calculate the total amount of fertilizer delivered by the successful trucks:**
   Since 15 trucks successfully delivered their loads, the total amount of fertilizer delivered is:
   \[
   15 \times 20 = 300 \text{ tons}
   \]

Therefore, the total number of tons of fertilizer that reached the farmers that day is **300 tons**.
