Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine how many trucks successfully delivered their loads of fertilizer and then calculate the total amount of fertilizer delivered.

1. **Determine the Total Number of Trucks:**
   - Mr. Hezekiah dispatched 20 trucks.

2. **Calculate the Number of Trucks with Mechanical Failures:**
   - A quarter of the trucks had mechanical failures. To find out how many trucks this is, we calculate:
     \[
     \text{Number of trucks with failures} = \frac{1}{4} \times 20 = 5
     \]
   - Therefore, 5 trucks experienced mechanical failures and could not deliver the fertilizer.

3. **Calculate the Number of Trucks that Successfully Delivered:**
   - Subtract the number of trucks with failures from the total number of trucks:
     \[
     \text{Number of successful trucks} = 20 - 5 = 15
     \]

4. **Determine the Amount of Fertilizer Each Truck Carries:**
   - Each truck carries 20 tons of fertilizer.

5. **Calculate the Total Amount of Fertilizer Delivered:**
   - Multiply the number of successful trucks by the amount of fertilizer each truck carries:
     \[
     \text{Total tons delivered} = 15 \times 20 = 300
     \]

Thus, the total number of tons of fertilizer that reached the farmers that day is \(\boxed{300}\).
