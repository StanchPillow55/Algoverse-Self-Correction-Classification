==================================================

First, let's find out how many trucks had mechanical failures. A quarter of the total number of trucks dispatched is 20 trucks * 1/4 = 5 trucks.

So, 5 trucks failed to deliver the fertilisers to the farmers. 

This means that the number of trucks that successfully delivered the fertilisers is 20 trucks - 5 trucks = 15 trucks.

Since each truck was carrying 20 tons of fertiliser, the total amount of fertiliser that reached the farmers is 15 trucks * 20 tons/truck = 300 tons.

So, 300 tons of fertiliser reached the farmers that day.
