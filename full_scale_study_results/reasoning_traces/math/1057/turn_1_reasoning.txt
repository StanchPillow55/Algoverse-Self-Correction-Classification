Question ID: 1057
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, let's determine how many movies Jill and her friends watch in a single weekend.

On Saturday, they watch 4 movies. On Sunday, they watch half the number of movies they watched on Saturday. Half of 4 is 2, so they watch 2 movies on Sunday.

Therefore, in a single weekend, they watch 4 (Saturday) + 2 (Sunday) = 6 movies.

If they watch movies every weekend, and there are 4 weeks in a month, then they watch 6 (movies per weekend) * 4 (weeks) = 24 movies in 4 weeks.

So, Jill and her friends can watch 24 movies in 4 weeks.
