Question ID: 1057
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, let's determine how many movies Jill and her friends watch in a single weekend. 

On Saturday, they watch 4 movies. On Sunday, they watch half the number of movies they watch on Saturday, which is 4/2 = 2 movies.

So, in one weekend, they watch 4 (Saturday) + 2 (Sunday) = 6 movies.

Now, let's calculate how many movies they can watch in 4 weeks. 

Since there are 4 weekends in 4 weeks, they can watch 6 (movies per weekend) * 4 (weekends) = 24 movies.

So, Jill and her friends can watch 24 movies in 4 weeks.
