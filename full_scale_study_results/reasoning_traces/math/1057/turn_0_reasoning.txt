Dataset Type: math
==================================================

Jill and her friends watch 4 movies every Saturday. So, on Sunday, they watch half the number of movies they watch on Saturday. This means they watch 4/2 = 2 movies on Sunday.

Therefore, in one weekend (Saturday and Sunday), they watch 4 + 2 = 6 movies.

If they watch movies every weekend, in 4 weeks (which is equivalent to 4 weekends), they will watch 4 * 6 = 24 movies.

So, Jill and her friends can watch 24 movies in 4 weeks.
