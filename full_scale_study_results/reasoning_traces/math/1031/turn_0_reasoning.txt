==================================================

First, we need to find out how many seats are left for friends and family after accounting for the seats for graduates and faculty. 

The Fine Arts Center has space for 6000 people. If we subtract the 950 seats for graduates and the 300 seats for faculty, we can find out how many seats are left for friends and family.

6000 (total seats) - 950 (graduate seats) - 300 (faculty seats) = 4750 seats available for friends and family.

Next, we need to find out how many tickets each graduate would receive. To do this, we divide the number of seats available for friends and family by the number of graduates.

4750 (seats for friends and family) รท 950 (number of graduates) = 5 tickets per graduate.

So, each graduate would receive 5 tickets to give to their friends and family.
