Question ID: 639
Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to calculate the volume of the hole that Bob wants to dig. The volume of a rectangular prism (which this hole is) can be calculated by multiplying its length, width, and height. 

So, the volume of the hole is 6 feet * 4 feet * 3 feet = 72 cubic feet.

Now, we know that Bob can shovel a cubic foot of earth in 3 seconds. Therefore, to find out how long it will take him to dig the hole, we need to multiply the volume of the hole by the time it takes him to shovel a cubic foot of earth.

So, the time it will take Bob to dig the hole is 72 cubic feet * 3 seconds/cubic foot = 216 seconds.

Therefore, it will take Bob 216 seconds to dig the hole.
