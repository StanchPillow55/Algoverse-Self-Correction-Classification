Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, let's calculate how many pounds of oats one horse consumes in a day. Since each horse eats 5 pounds of oats per meal and they are fed twice a day, one horse consumes 5 * 2 = 10 pounds of oats per day.

Uncle Ben has four horses, so in total, his horses consume 10 * 4 = 40 pounds of oats per day.

For five days, the horses will consume 40 * 5 = 200 pounds of oats.

Since one bag of oats weighs 50 pounds, Uncle Ben will need 200 / 50 = 4 bags of oats to feed his horses for five days.

So, Uncle Ben needs 4 bags of oats.
