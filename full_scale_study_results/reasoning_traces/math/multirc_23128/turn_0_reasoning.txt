==================================================

To solve this problem, I need to carefully read the given paragraph and identify the relevant information that answers the question.

The paragraph states:
"He is attacked by a pig-masked figure in the passage and awakens with his head sealed in a box slowly filling with water, Which he survives by performing a tracheotomy using a pen."

From this, we can see that Agent Peter Strahm used a pen to perform a tracheotomy in order to survive the situation where his head was sealed in a box filling with water.

Therefore, the answer to the question "What did Agent Peter Strahm use to perform a tracheotomy?" is a pen.

The complete reasoning and work is as follows:
1. Read the given paragraph carefully to identify the relevant information.
2. The paragraph states that Agent Peter Strahm performed a tracheotomy using a pen to survive the situation where his head was sealed in a box filling with water.
3. Therefore, the answer to the question is that Agent Peter Strahm used a pen to perform the tracheotomy.

Final answer: Pen
