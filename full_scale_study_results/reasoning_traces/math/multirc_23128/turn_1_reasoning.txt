==================================================

To solve this problem, I will go through the details provided in the paragraph and identify the information relevant to answering the question.

The key details are:
1. Agent Peter Strahm is sealed in the sickroom and finds a hidden passage.
2. In the passage, Strahm is attacked by a pig-masked figure and awakens with his head sealed in a box slowly filling with water.
3. To survive, Strahm performs a tracheotomy using a pen.

From this information, we can conclude that Strahm used a pen to perform the tracheotomy in order to breathe and survive while his head was sealed in the box.

Therefore, the answer is:
Pen

The complete reasoning and work is as follows:
1. The paragraph states that Strahm "awakens with his head sealed in a box slowly filling with water, Which he survives by performing a tracheotomy using a pen."
2. A tracheotomy is a surgical procedure that involves making an incision in the trachea (windpipe) to allow for breathing when the normal airway is blocked or obstructed.
3. The
