Question ID: multirc_23128
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, I will go through the details provided in the paragraph and identify the information relevant to answering the question.

The key details are:
1. Agent Peter Strahm is sealed in the sickroom and finds a hidden passage.
2. In the passage, Strahm is attacked by a pig-masked figure and awakens with his head sealed in a box slowly filling with water.
3. To survive, Strahm performs a tracheotomy using a pen.

From this information, we can conclude that Strahm used a pen to perform the tracheotomy.

The reasoning is as follows:
1. Strahm was in a life-threatening situation, with his head sealed in a box filling with water.
2. To survive, he needed to perform a tracheotomy, which is a surgical procedure to create an opening in the trachea to allow for breathing.
3. The paragraph specifically states that Strahm "performs a tracheotomy using a pen."

Therefore, the answer is that Agent Peter Strahm used a pen to perform the tracheotomy.

Final answer: Pen
