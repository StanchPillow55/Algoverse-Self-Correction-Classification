Question ID: copa_84
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To determine the cause of the slow service at the restaurant, we need to analyze the given choices and use logical reasoning to arrive at the most likely explanation.

Given information:
- The service at the restaurant was slow.
- Choice 1: There were many empty tables.
- Choice 2: The restaurant was crowded.

Reasoning:
1. If there were many empty tables, it would suggest that the restaurant was not crowded, and the slow service could not be attributed to the restaurant being crowded.
2. If the restaurant was crowded, it would indicate that there was a high demand for the restaurant's services, which could lead to slow service due to the increased workload on the staff.

Therefore, the most likely cause of the slow service at the restaurant is that the restaurant was crowded.

Final answer: Choice 2 - The restaurant was crowded.
