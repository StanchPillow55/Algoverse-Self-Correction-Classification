Question ID: 284
Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

In the first week, Alani wrote 20 stories, Braylen wrote 40 stories, and Margot wrote 60 stories. To find the total number of stories they wrote in the first week, we add these numbers together:

20 + 40 + 60 = 120 stories

In the second week, each of them doubled the number of stories they'd written in the first week. This means Alani wrote 20 * 2 = 40 stories, Braylen wrote 40 * 2 = 80 stories, and Margot wrote 60 * 2 = 120 stories.

Adding these together gives us the total number of stories they wrote in the second week:

40 + 80 + 120 = 240 stories

To find the total number of stories they wrote altogether, we add the number of stories they wrote in the first week to the number of stories they wrote in the second week:

120 + 240 = 360 stories

So, Alani, Braylen, and Margot wrote a total of 360 stories altogether.
