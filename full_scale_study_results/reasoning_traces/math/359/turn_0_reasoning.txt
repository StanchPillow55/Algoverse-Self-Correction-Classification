Question ID: 359
Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to find out how much Billy spent on gumballs. Since each gumball costs $.05 and he bought 40 of them, we multiply $.05 by 40 to get $2. 

Since Billy spent half his change on gumballs, we know that he had $4 left after buying the candy ($2 for the gumballs and $2 remaining). 

So, if Billy started with $10 and had $4 left after buying the candy, he must have spent $6 on the candy. 

The candy costs $1.5 per pound, so to find out how many pounds of candy Billy bought, we divide the total amount he spent on candy by the cost per pound. 

$6 รท $1.5 = 4 pounds

So, Billy bought 4 pounds of candy.
