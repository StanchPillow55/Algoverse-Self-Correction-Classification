Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to work backwards from the information given.

First, we know that Billy spent half his change on gumballs. We also know that he bought 40 gumballs at $0.05 each. So, we can calculate how much he spent on gumballs by multiplying the number of gumballs by the cost of each gumball:

40 gumballs * $0.05/gumball = $2.00

Since this amount represents half his change, we can find the total amount of change he had by doubling this amount:

$2.00 * 2 = $4.00

Now, we know that Billy started with $10 and ended with $4 in change. So, we can calculate how much he spent on candy by subtracting the amount of change from the amount he started with:

$10.00 - $4.00 = $6.00

Finally, we know that the candy costs $1.5 per pound. So, we can calculate how many pounds of candy Billy bought by dividing the amount he spent on candy by the cost per pound:

$6.00 / $1.5/pound = 4 pounds

So, Billy bought 4 pounds of candy.
