Question ID: 359
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, let's figure out how much money Billy spent on gumballs. Since each gumball costs $.05, and he bought 40 gumballs, he spent 40 * $.05 = $2 on gumballs.

Since Billy spent half his change on gumballs, that means he had $2 * 2 = $4 left after buying the candy.

Billy started with $10, so that means the candy cost him $10 - $4 = $6.

Since the candy costs $1.5 per pound, Billy bought $6 / $1.5 = 4 pounds of candy.

So, Billy bought 4 pounds of candy.
