Question ID: 670
Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to find out how much candy they have in total. 

To do this, we add up the amount of candy each person has:

Robert's candy = 3 pounds
Cindy's candy = 5 pounds
Aaron's candy = 4 pounds

Total candy = Robert's candy + Cindy's candy + Aaron's candy
Total candy = 3 pounds + 5 pounds + 4 pounds = 12 pounds

Now, they want to share this candy equally among themselves. Since there are 3 people (Robert, Cindy, and Aaron), we divide the total amount of candy by 3.

Each person's share = Total candy / Number of people
Each person's share = 12 pounds / 3 = 4 pounds

So, each of them would have 4 pounds of candy after they share it equally.
