Question ID: 670
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to find out the total amount of candy that Robert, Cindy, and Aaron have together. We do this by adding the amount of candy each person has:

3 pounds (Robert) + 5 pounds (Cindy) + 4 pounds (Aaron) = 12 pounds

Next, we need to divide this total amount of candy equally among the three of them. We do this by dividing the total amount of candy by the number of people:

12 pounds รท 3 people = 4 pounds per person

So, if Robert, Cindy, and Aaron decide to pool and share their candy equally with each other, each of them would have 4 pounds of candy.
