Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, let's calculate how much money John earned in a week. He earned 50 dollars an hour and worked 6 hours, so he earned 50*6 = 300 dollars.

Next, let's subtract his expenses. He spent 50 dollars on gas and wants to deposit 100 dollars in the bank, so he has 300 - 50 - 100 = 150 dollars left.

Then, let's subtract the cost of the pencils. Each pencil costs 10 dollars and he wants to buy 5, so the pencils cost 10*5 = 50 dollars.

After buying the pencils, he has 150 - 50 = 100 dollars left.

Finally, let's calculate how many 25 dollar pens he can buy. Each pen costs 25 dollars, so he can buy 100/25 = 4 pens.

So, John can buy 4 pens.
