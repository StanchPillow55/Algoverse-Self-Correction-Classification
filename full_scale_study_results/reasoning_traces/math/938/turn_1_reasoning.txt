==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to calculate John's total earnings, his expenses, and then determine how many 25-dollar pens he can buy with the remaining money after his expenses.

**Step 1: Calculate John's Total Earnings**
John earns 50 dollars per hour and works for 6 hours in the week.

\[
\text{Total Earnings} = \text{Hourly Rate} \times \text{Hours Worked} = 50 \, \text{dollars/hour} \times 6 \, \text{hours} = 300 \, \text{dollars}
\]

**Step 2: Calculate John's Total Expenses**
John has several expenses:
- He spends 50 dollars on gas.
- He wants to deposit 100 dollars in the bank.
- He buys 5 pencils at 10 dollars each.

First, calculate the cost of the pencils:

\[
\text{Cost of Pencils} = 5 \, \text{pencils} \times 10 \, \text{dollars/pencil} = 50 \, \text{dollars}
\]

Now, add up all the expenses:

\[
\text{Total Expenses} = \text{Gas} + \text{Bank Deposit} + \text{Cost of Pencils} = 50 \, \text{dollars} + 100 \, \text{dollars} + 50 \, \text{dollars} = 200 \, \text{dollars}
\]

**Step 3: Calculate Remaining Money**
Subtract the total expenses from the total earnings to find out how much money John has left:

\[
\text{Remaining Money} = \text{Total Earnings} - \text{Total Expenses} = 300 \, \text{dollars} - 200 \, \text{dollars} = 100 \, \text{dollars}
\]

**Step 4: Determine How Many 25-Dollar Pens John Can Buy**
Each pen costs 25 dollars. To find out how many pens John can buy with his remaining money, divide the remaining money by the cost of one pen:

\[
\text{Number of Pens} = \frac{\text{Remaining Money}}{\text{Cost per Pen}} = \frac{100 \, \text{dollars}}{25 \, \text{dollars/pen}} = 4 \, \text{pens}
\]

**Final Answer:**
John can buy 4 pens.
