==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to analyze the information provided in the paragraph and extract the relevant details to answer the question.

Given information:
- Within the past 100 years, the amount of land used for agriculture has almost doubled.
- Land used for grazing cattle has more than doubled.
- Many wetlands have also been lost to agriculture.
- The U.S. has lost almost all the natural tall-grass prairies.

Step 1: Determine the growth in land used for agriculture.
The paragraph states that the amount of land used for agriculture has "almost doubled" within the past 100 years.
This means the land used for agriculture has increased by approximately 100%.

Step 2: Determine how the agricultural land is used.
The paragraph mentions that the land is used for the following purposes:
- Agriculture (to grow crops)
- Grazing cattle
- Replacing wetlands and tall-grass prairies

Therefore, the agricultural clearing has grown by almost 100% in the last 100 years, and it is primarily used for the following purposes:
1. Growing crops to feed humans
2. Grazing cattle
3. Replacing natural hab
