Question ID: multirc_17976
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, I will go through the information provided in the paragraph step-by-step and perform the necessary calculations to determine how much the agricultural clearing has grown in the last 100 years.

Given information:
- Within the past 100 years, the amount of land used for agriculture has almost doubled.
- Land used for grazing cattle has more than doubled.
- Many wetlands have also been lost to agriculture.
- The U.S. has lost almost all the natural tall-grass prairies.

Step 1: Determine the growth in land used for agriculture.
The paragraph states that the amount of land used for agriculture has "almost doubled" in the last 100 years.
This means the land used for agriculture has increased by approximately 100%.

Step 2: Determine the growth in land used for grazing cattle.
The paragraph states that the land used for grazing cattle has "more than doubled" in the last 100 years.
This means the land used for grazing cattle has increased by more than 100%.

Step 3: Determine the use of the cleared land.
The paragraph states that the land may be cleared for agriculture or for building
