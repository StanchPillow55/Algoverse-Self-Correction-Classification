==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to understand the process of heat transfer from the body to the environment through the skin.

Given information:
- The skin has the function of maintaining a constant body temperature.
- When the body needs to cool down, the skin helps in two ways:
  1. Sweat from sweat glands in the skin evaporates to cool the body.
  2. Blood vessels in the skin dilate, or widen, which increases blood flow to the body surface, allowing more heat to reach the surface and then radiate off the body.

Reasoning:
When the heat reaches the surface of the skin, the following happens:

1. The increased blood flow to the body surface brings more heat to the skin.
2. The heat at the skin's surface can then be radiated off the body to the surrounding environment.

This process of heat radiation from the skin's surface is the main mechanism by which the body loses excess heat and maintains a constant body temperature.

When the body needs to retain heat, the opposite happens:
- Blood vessels in the skin constrict, or narrow, which decreases blood flow to the body surface.
- This reduces the amount of heat
