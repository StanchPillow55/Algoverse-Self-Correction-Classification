==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to understand the process of heat transfer from the body to the environment through the skin.

Given information:
- The skin has the function of maintaining a constant body temperature.
- When the body needs to cool down, the blood vessels in the skin dilate, increasing blood flow to the body surface.
- This allows more heat to reach the surface of the skin.

Reasoning:
1. When the heat reaches the surface of the skin, it can be lost to the environment through the process of radiation.
2. Radiation is the transfer of heat energy through electromagnetic waves, without the need for a physical medium.
3. The heat energy from the body's surface is emitted as infrared radiation, which is then absorbed by the surrounding environment.
4. The rate of heat loss through radiation depends on the temperature difference between the skin surface and the surrounding environment, as well as the emissivity of the skin.
5. As the heat reaches the surface of the skin, the temperature of the skin increases, which in turn increases the rate of heat loss through radiation.

Calculation:
The rate of heat loss through radiation can be calculated using the Stefan-Boltzmann law:
