==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to understand the process of heat transfer from the body to the environment through the skin.

Given information:
- The skin has the function of maintaining a constant body temperature.
- When the body needs to cool down, the blood vessels in the skin dilate, increasing blood flow to the body surface.
- This allows more heat to reach the surface of the skin.

Reasoning:
1. When the heat reaches the surface of the skin, it can be transferred to the environment through the process of radiation.
2. Radiation is the transfer of heat energy through electromagnetic waves, without the need for a physical medium.
3. The heat energy that reaches the surface of the skin is in the form of infrared radiation, which is part of the electromagnetic spectrum.
4. As the heat energy reaches the surface of the skin, it causes the molecules on the skin's surface to vibrate more, increasing their kinetic energy.
5. This increased kinetic energy is then emitted as infrared radiation, which is radiated away from the body and into the surrounding environment.
6. The rate of heat radiation from the skin's surface depends on the temperature difference between the skin and the surrounding environment
