Question ID: 491
Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to find out how many eggs Jaime can place on the trays. Since each tray can hold 24 eggs, and he has 2 trays, he can place a total of 24 * 2 = 48 eggs on the trays.

Next, we need to find out how many eggs Jaime won't be able to place on the trays. He has 64 eggs, and he can place 48 of them on the trays. Therefore, the number of eggs he won't be able to place on the trays is 64 - 48 = 16 eggs.

So, Jaime won't be able to place 16 eggs on the trays.
