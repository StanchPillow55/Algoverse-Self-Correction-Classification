==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to evaluate the plausibility of the megalodon, a prehistoric shark, existing today based on the information provided in the passage.

Given information:
- The Discovery Channel aired a special called "Megalodon: The Monster Shark That Lives" during Shark Week.
- The special explored the possibility of the massive prehistoric shark megalodon still existing today.
- Some viewers were expecting to watch shark experts and scientists examine evidence that the megalodon could still be swimming around somewhere.

Step 1: Understand the megalodon and its characteristics.
The megalodon was a prehistoric shark that lived approximately 23 to 3.6 million years ago. It was one of the largest known predatory sharks, with estimates of its size ranging from 15 to 18 meters (49 to 59 feet) in length.

Step 2: Evaluate the likelihood of the megalodon existing today.
There are several factors to consider when evaluating the likelihood of the megalodon existing today:

1. Fossil evidence:
   - The megalodon is known from an extensive fossil record, with numerous well-preserved teeth and some skel
