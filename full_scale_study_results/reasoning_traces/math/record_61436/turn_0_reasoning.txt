==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given information and determine the appropriate mathematical approach to answer the question.

Given information:
- The Discovery Channel aired a special during Shark Week that explored the possibility of the prehistoric megalodon shark still existing today.
- The special was titled "Megalodon: The Monster Shark That Lives" and was billed as a search for a massive killer great white shark.
- Viewers were expecting to watch shark experts and scientists examine evidence that the megalodon could still be swimming around somewhere.

The key question to be answered is:
"Can the megalodon shark exist today?"

To answer this question, we need to consider the following factors:

1. Megalodon Characteristics:
   - Megalodon (Carcharocles megalodon) was a prehistoric shark that lived approximately 23 to 3.6 million years ago.
   - It was one of the largest known predatory sharks, with estimates of its length ranging from 15 to 18 meters (49 to 59 feet).
   - Megalodon had a massive, powerful jaw and teeth that were up to 17 cent
