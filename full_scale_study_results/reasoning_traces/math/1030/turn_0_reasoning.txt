First, let's calculate the probability that Marcus will not have to turn in his homework tomorrow.

There are three scenarios in which Marcus will not have to turn in his homework:

1. There's a 50% chance that he'll have a substitute teacher who won't collect the homework.
2. If the normal teacher comes in, there's a 50% chance of that happening. And in that case, there's a 40% chance she'll give everyone an extension. So, the probability of this scenario is 50% * 40% = 20%.
3. If the whole class doesn't get an extension, there's a 60% chance of that happening (100% - 40% = 60%). And in that case, there's a 20% chance Marcus can convince the teacher his dog ate his assignment. So, the probability of this scenario is 50% (chance that the normal teacher comes in) * 60% (chance that the whole class doesn't get an extension) * 20% (chance Marcus can convince the teacher his dog ate his assignment) = 6%.

Adding up these probabilities gives us the total probability that Marcus will not have to turn in his homework:

50% + 20% + 6% = 76%.

Therefore, the probability that Marcus will actually have to turn in his homework tomorrow is 100% - 76% = 24%.

So, there's a 24% chance that Marcus will have to turn in his homework tomorrow.
