Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to find the value of the placeholder in the given passage.

Given information:
- Tom Daley won the gold medal at the Commonwealth Games with a score of 516.55.
- The passage mentions that Daley secured his win in his fifth dive with a "superb back 3.5 somersault".

Step 1: Identify the placeholder in the passage.
The placeholder in the given passage is "@placeholder".

Step 2: Determine the value of the placeholder.
The passage states that Daley secured his win in his fifth dive with a "superb back 3.5 somersault". This suggests that the placeholder represents the difficulty score of the back 3.5 somersault dive.

The difficulty score for a back 3.5 somersault dive is typically around 3.6 to 3.8.

Therefore, the value of the placeholder "@placeholder" is likely to be in the range of 3.6 to 3.8.

Final answer:
The value of the placeholder "@placeholder" is likely to be in the range of 3.6 to 3.
