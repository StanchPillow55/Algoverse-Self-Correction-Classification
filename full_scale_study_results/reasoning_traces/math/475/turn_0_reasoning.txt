Question ID: 475
Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to find out how many days Jason has to break in his shoes. Since he can walk 4 days a week and he has 3 weeks before the tryouts, he has 4 days/week * 3 weeks = <<4*3=12>>12 days to break in his shoes.

Next, we need to find out how long he has to walk each day. Since it takes 240 minutes to break in the shoes and he has 12 days to do this, he needs to walk 240 minutes / 12 days = <<240/12=20>>20 minutes each day.

So, Jason needs to walk 20 minutes each day to break in his new shoes before the track team tryouts.
