Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to calculate the cost of each type of pastry by multiplying the cost per dozen by the number of dozens bought.

For the donuts:
3 dozen * $68/dozen = $204

For the mini cupcakes:
2 dozen * $80/dozen = $160

For the mini cheesecakes:
6 dozen * $55/dozen = $330

Then, we add up the cost of each type of pastry to find the total cost.

$204 (for donuts) + $160 (for mini cupcakes) + $330 (for mini cheesecakes) = $694

So, the total cost of all the pastries Toula bought is $694.
