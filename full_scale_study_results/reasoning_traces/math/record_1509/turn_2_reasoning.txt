==================================================

To solve this problem, I will break it down step-by-step:

1. Identify the key information given in the passage:
   - Cathy Woods was imprisoned for over 30 years for the 1976 murder of a 19-year-old nursing student, Michele Mitchell.

   - Shortly after this, she claimed to have killed a woman, referring to the murder of Michele Mitchell.
   - The placeholder "@placeholder" indicates that
