==================================================

To answer the question "Why did she adopt the stage name Fontaine?", we need to refer to the information provided in the paragraph.

The paragraph states:
"She later adopted the stage name Fontaine -- the name of her mother's second husband."

This indicates that Joan Fontaine adopted the stage name Fontaine because it was the name of her mother's second husband. She likely chose this name to use as her stage name, rather than her birth name of Joan de Beauvoir de Havilland.

The reasoning behind this is that it was common for actors and actresses to adopt stage names, often taking the name of a spouse or other family member, in order to have a more memorable or marketable name for their acting career.

Therefore, the complete answer is:
Joan Fontaine adopted the stage name Fontaine because it was the name of her mother's second husband.
