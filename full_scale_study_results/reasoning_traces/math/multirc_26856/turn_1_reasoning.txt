Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To answer the question "Why did she adopt the stage name Fontaine?", we need to look at the information provided in the paragraph.

The paragraph states:
"She later adopted the stage name Fontaine -- the name of her mother's second husband."

This indicates that Joan Fontaine adopted the stage name Fontaine because it was the name of her mother's second husband. She likely chose this name to use as her stage name, rather than her birth name of Joan de Beauvoir de Havilland.

The reasoning is that she wanted to have a different stage name that was not her birth name, and she chose the name of her mother's second husband, Fontaine, as her stage name.

Therefore, the final answer is:
She adopted the stage name Fontaine because it was the name of her mother's second husband.
