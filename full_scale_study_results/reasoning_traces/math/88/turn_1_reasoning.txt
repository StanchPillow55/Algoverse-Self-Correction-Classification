Question ID: 88
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

Let's denote the number of copies Harald sold as H. According to the problem, Marilyn sold 10 times as many copies as Harald, so we can denote the number of copies Marilyn sold as 10H.

The problem states that together they sold 88,000 copies. So, we can set up the following equation to represent this situation:

H + 10H = 88,000

This simplifies to:

11H = 88,000

To find the value of H (the number of copies Harald sold), we need to divide both sides of the equation by 11:

H = 88,000 / 11

H = 8,000

Therefore, Harald sold 8,000 copies.
