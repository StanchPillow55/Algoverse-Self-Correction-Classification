Dataset Type: math
==================================================

Let's denote the number of copies Harald sold as H. According to the problem, Marilyn sold 10 times as many copies as Harald, so we can denote the number of copies Marilyn sold as 10H.

The problem states that together they sold 88,000 copies. So, we can set up the following equation to represent this situation:

H (Harald's sales) + 10H (Marilyn's sales) = 88,000

Solving this equation will give us the number of copies Harald sold.

Combine like terms:

11H = 88,000

Now, divide both sides of the equation by 11 to solve for H:

H = 88,000 / 11

H = 8,000

So, Harald sold 8,000 copies.
