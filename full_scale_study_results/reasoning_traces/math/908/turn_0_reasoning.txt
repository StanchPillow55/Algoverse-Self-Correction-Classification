Question ID: 908
Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to find out how many marbles Dean gives to Jamie. Since he gives Jamie 1/5 of his marbles, we calculate 1/5 of 30. 

1/5 * 30 = 6 marbles

So, Dean gives Jamie 6 marbles. 

Next, we know that Dean gives Donald 10 marbles. 

So, in total, Dean gives away 6 (to Jamie) + 10 (to Donald) = 16 marbles.

Dean originally had 30 marbles. If he gives away 16, we subtract 16 from 30 to find out how many marbles Dean has left.

30 - 16 = 14 marbles

So, Dean has 14 marbles left.
