Question ID: 908
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to find out how many marbles Dean gives to Jamie. Since he gives Jamie 1/5 of his marbles, we multiply 30 by 1/5:

30 * 1/5 = 6 marbles

So, Dean gives Jamie 6 marbles.

Next, we know that Dean gives Donald 10 marbles.

Now, we subtract the total number of marbles Dean gave away from his original amount. He started with 30 marbles, gave away 6 to Jamie and 10 to Donald:

30 - 6 - 10 = 14 marbles

So, Dean has 14 marbles left.
