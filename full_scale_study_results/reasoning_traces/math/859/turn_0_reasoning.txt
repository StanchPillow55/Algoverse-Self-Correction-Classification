==================================================

First, let's calculate how much money Rafaela received in tips. Since each of the forty customers gave her a $20 tip, she received 40 * $20 = $<<40*20=800>>800 in tips.

Julieta received 10% less money in tips than Rafaela. To find out how much money that is, we need to calculate 10% of $800. To do this, we multiply $800 by 10/100 (which is the decimal equivalent of 10%), so $800 * 10/100 = $<<800*10/100=80>>80.

So, Julieta received $800 - $80 = $<<800-80=720>>720 in tips.

Altogether, Julieta and Rafaela received $800 (Rafaela's tips) + $720 (Julieta's tips) = $<<800+720=1520>>1520 in tips. 

So, the final answer is $1520.
