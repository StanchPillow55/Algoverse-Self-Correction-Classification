Question ID: 1275
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to calculate the total weight of the car including the luggage and the two children. 

The total weight is the sum of the weight of the car, the weight of the luggage, and the weight of the two children. 

So, the total weight is 1200 pounds (car) + 250 pounds (luggage) + 2*75 pounds (children) = 1200 + 250 + 150 = 1600 pounds.

Next, we need to calculate the force needed to move the car. The problem states that the force needed to move the car is 1% of the total weight. 

To find 1% of a number, we multiply the number by 0.01. 

So, the force needed to move the car is 0.01 * 1600 pounds = 16 pounds.

Therefore, John needs a force of 16 pounds to push the car.
