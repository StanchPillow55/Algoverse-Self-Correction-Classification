Question ID: 1275
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to find the total weight of the car, luggage, and the two children. 

The weight of the car is 1200 pounds, the luggage is 250 pounds, and each child weighs 75 pounds. So, we have two children, which means we need to multiply 75 pounds by 2. 

75 pounds/child * 2 children = 150 pounds

Now, we add all these weights together to get the total weight:

1200 pounds (car) + 250 pounds (luggage) + 150 pounds (children) = 1600 pounds

The force needed to move the car is 1% of this total weight. To find this, we multiply the total weight by 0.01 (which is the decimal equivalent of 1%).

1600 pounds * 0.01 = 16 pounds

So, John needs to apply a force of 16 pounds to move the car.
