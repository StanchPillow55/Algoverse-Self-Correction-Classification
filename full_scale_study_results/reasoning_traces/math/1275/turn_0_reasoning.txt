Question ID: 1275
Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to find the total weight of the car, luggage, and children. 

The car weighs 1200 pounds, the luggage weighs 250 pounds, and the two children weigh 75 pounds each, so the total weight is:

1200 pounds (car) + 250 pounds (luggage) + 2 * 75 pounds (children) = 1200 + 250 + 150 = 1600 pounds.

Next, we need to find out how much force is needed to move the car. The problem states that the force needed to move the car is 1% of the total weight. 

To find 1% of a number, we multiply that number by 0.01. 

So, the force needed to move the car is 0.01 * 1600 pounds = 16 pounds.

Therefore, John needs 16 pounds of force to push the car.
