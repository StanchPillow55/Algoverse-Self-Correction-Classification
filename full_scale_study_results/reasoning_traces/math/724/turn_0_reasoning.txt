==================================================

First, let's calculate how many slices of pizza Bryce and his two friends ate. They each ate 2/3 of their pizzas, and since each pizza has 12 slices, they each ate 2/3 * 12 = 8 slices of pizza. Since there are three of them, they ate a total of 3 * 8 = 24 slices of pizza.

Next, let's calculate how many slices of pizza the two remaining friends ate. They each ate 3/4 of their pizzas, so they each ate 3/4 * 12 = 9 slices of pizza. Since there are two of them, they ate a total of 2 * 9 = 18 slices of pizza.

So, in total, all five friends ate 24 + 18 = 42 slices of pizza.

Since each friend had their own pizza, and each pizza had 12 slices, there were a total of 5 * 12 = 60 slices of pizza.

Therefore, the number of slices of pizza that were left is 60 - 42 = 18 slices. 

So, 18 slices of pizza were left.
