Question ID: 255
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, let's find out how many cows are in each stall before Mr. Sylas buys new cows. We know that there are 10 stalls with 20 cows each. So, there are 10 stalls * 20 cows/stall = 200 cows in total.

Then, Mr. Sylas buys 40 new cows and divides them equally among the 20 stalls. This means that each stall gets 40 cows / 20 stalls = 2 new cows.

So, after Mr. Sylas adds the new cows, each stall now has 20 original cows + 2 new cows = 22 cows.

Finally, we want to find out how many cows are in 8 of the stalls. So, there are 8 stalls * 22 cows/stall = 176 cows in 8 stalls.

Therefore, there are 176 cows in 8 stalls.
