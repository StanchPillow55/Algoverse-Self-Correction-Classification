==================================================

First, let's find out how many cows are in each stall before Mr. Sylas buys new cows. 

There are 10 stalls with 20 cows each, so there are 10*20 = <<10*20=200>>200 cows in total.

Mr. Sylas buys 40 new cows and divides them equally among the 20 stalls. This means each stall gets 40/20 = <<40/20=2>>2 new cows.

So, after Mr. Sylas adds the new cows, each stall now has 20+2 = <<20+2=22>>22 cows.

We want to find out how many cows are in 8 of the stalls. Since each stall has 22 cows, there are 8*22 = <<8*22=176>>176 cows in 8 stalls.

So, there are 176 cows in 8 stalls.
