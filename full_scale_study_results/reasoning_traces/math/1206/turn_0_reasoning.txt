Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to find out how much John gets from the loan. Since the loan is worth 40% of the value of his house, we calculate 40% of $250,000.

40% of $250,000 = 0.40 * $250,000 = $100,000

So, John gets a loan of $100,000.

Next, we need to find out how much of this loan John uses to pay off his debts. We know that he uses 60% of the loan amount to pay off his debts.

60% of $100,000 = 0.60 * $100,000 = $60,000

So, John uses $60,000 of his loan to pay off his debts.

Finally, we need to find out how much money John has left over after paying off his debts. We do this by subtracting the amount he used to pay off his debts from the total loan amount.

$100,000 - $60,000 = $40,000

So, John has $40,000 left over after paying off his debts.
