Question ID: 1206
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to calculate the amount of the loan John gets. Since the loan is worth 40% of the value of his house, we multiply the value of the house by 0.40 (which is the decimal equivalent of 40%).

$250,000 * 0.40 = $100,000

So, John gets a loan of $100,000.

Next, we need to calculate how much of this loan John uses to pay off his debts. Since he uses 60% of the loan to pay off his debts, we multiply the amount of the loan by 0.60 (which is the decimal equivalent of 60%).

$100,000 * 0.60 = $60,000

So, John uses $60,000 of his loan to pay off his debts.

Finally, we need to calculate how much money John has left over after paying off his debts. We do this by subtracting the amount he used to pay off his debts from the total amount of the loan.

$100,000 - $60,000 = $40,000

So, John has $40,000 left over after paying off his debts.
