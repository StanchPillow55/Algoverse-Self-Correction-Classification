Question ID: 1206
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to determine the amount of the loan John gets by mortgaging his house. Since the loan is worth 40% of the value of his house, we calculate this by multiplying the value of the house ($250,000) by 40% (or 0.40 in decimal form). 

$250,000 * 0.40 = $100,000

So, John gets a loan of $100,000.

Next, we need to determine how much of this loan John uses to pay off his debts. We know he uses 60% of the loan amount, so we calculate this by multiplying the loan amount ($100,000) by 60% (or 0.60 in decimal form).

$100,000 * 0.60 = $60,000

So, John uses $60,000 of his loan to pay off his debts.

Finally, we need to determine how much money John has leftover after paying off his debts. We calculate this by subtracting the amount used to pay off debts ($60,000) from the total loan amount ($100,000).

$100,000 - $60,000 = $40,000

So, John has $40,000 leftover after paying off his debts.
