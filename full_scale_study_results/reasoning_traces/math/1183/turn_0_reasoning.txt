==================================================

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Two apples fell out of the tree. Newton picked up these two apples.

2. He put one apple in his pocket and threw the other one into the tree. So, he has one apple in his pocket.

3. This caused 5 more apples to fall out of the tree. Newton picked up these apples, so now he has 1 (from step 2) + 5 = 6 apples.

4. He put all but one in his pocket and threw the remaining one at the tree. So, he has 6 - 1 = 5 apples in his pocket.

5. This caused another 6 apples to fall out of the tree. Newton picked up all of the remaining apples. So, now he has 5 (from step 4) + 6 = 11 apples.

Therefore, Newton brought home 11 apples.
