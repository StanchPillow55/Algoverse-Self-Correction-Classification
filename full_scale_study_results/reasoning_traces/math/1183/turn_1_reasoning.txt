Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

Let's break down the problem step by step to determine how many apples Newton brought home.

1. **Initial Situation:**
   - Two apples fell out of the tree.
   - One apple landed on Newton's head.

2. **First Action:**
   - Newton picked up the two apples.
   - He put one apple in his pocket.
   - He threw the other apple into the tree.

3. **Result of First Action:**
   - Throwing the apple into the tree caused 5 more apples to fall out.

4. **Second Action:**
   - Newton picked up the 5 apples.
   - He put all but one in his pocket, which means he put 4 apples in his pocket.
   - He threw the remaining apple at the tree.

5. **Result of Second Action:**
   - Throwing the apple at the tree caused 6 more apples to fall out.

6. **Final Action:**
   - Newton picked up all 6 apples.

Now, let's calculate the total number of apples Newton brought home:

- Initially, Newton put 1 apple in his pocket.
- After the first action, he put 4 more apples in his pocket.
- After the second action, he picked up 6 apples.

Therefore, the total number of apples Newton brought home is:

\[ 1 + 4 + 6 = 11 \]

Thus, Newton brought home 11 apples.

**Final Answer:**
Newton brought home 11 apples.
