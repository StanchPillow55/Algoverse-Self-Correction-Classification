Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

The basketball game is divided into 4 quarters, and each quarter is 12 minutes long. So, the total time for the 4 quarters is 4 quarters * 12 minutes/quarter = 48 minutes.

However, the last quarter was extended by 5 minutes because of a tie. So, the total time for the game is the time for the 4 quarters plus the extra time: 48 minutes + 5 minutes = 53 minutes.

So, the entire game lasted 53 minutes.
