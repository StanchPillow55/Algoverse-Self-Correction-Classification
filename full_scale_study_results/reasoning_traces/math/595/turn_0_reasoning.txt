Dataset Type: math
==================================================

Let's denote Jerry's current age as J. 

According to the problem, Jerry is twice as old as he was 5 years ago. This can be written as an equation:

J = 2 * (J - 5)

Solving this equation will give us Jerry's current age. 

First, distribute the 2 on the right side of the equation:

J = 2J - 10

Then, subtract 2J from both sides to isolate J:

- J = -10

Multiply both sides by -1 to get J alone:

J = 10

So, Jerry is currently 10 years old. 

The problem also asks us to find out how old Jerry will be in 3 years. 

To find this, we simply add 3 to Jerry's current age:

10 + 3 = 13

So, Jerry will be 13 years old in 3 years.
