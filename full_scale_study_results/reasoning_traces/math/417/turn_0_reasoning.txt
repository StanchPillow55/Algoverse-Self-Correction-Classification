==================================================

First, we need to calculate the total distance Tom traveled in the first four days. Since he traveled 200 kilometers each day, we multiply 200 by 4:

200 km/day * 4 days = 800 km

Next, we calculate the distance he traveled over the next two days. We know this is 30% of the distance he traveled over the first four days. To find 30% of 800 km, we multiply 800 by 0.30:

800 km * 0.30 = 240 km

So, in the first week, Tom traveled a total of 800 km (from the first four days) plus 240 km (from the next two days). Adding these together gives us:

800 km + 240 km = 1040 km

We know that Tom didn't travel at all on the seventh day of the first week. 

In the second week, Tom traveled 300 kilometers each day. Since a week has 7 days, we multiply 300 by 7 to find the total distance he traveled in the second week:

300 km/day * 7 days = 2100 km

So, in the second week, Tom traveled a total of 2100 km.

To find the total distance Tom traveled over the two weeks, we add the total distance he traveled in the first week to the total distance he traveled in the second week:

1040 km (from the first week) + 2100 km (from the second week) = 3140 km

So, Tom traveled a total of 3140 kilometers during his two-week-long trip.
