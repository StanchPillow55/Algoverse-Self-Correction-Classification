Question ID: 262
Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

Maddison initially has 5 boxes of marbles, with each box containing 50 marbles. 

To find out the total number of marbles she has initially, we multiply the number of boxes by the number of marbles in each box. 

So, 5 boxes * 50 marbles/box = 250 marbles

Then, Maddison gets an additional 20 marbles from her friend. 

To find out the total number of marbles she has now, we add the number of marbles she got from her friend to the number of marbles she had initially. 

So, 250 marbles + 20 marbles = 270 marbles

Therefore, Maddison now has 270 marbles.
