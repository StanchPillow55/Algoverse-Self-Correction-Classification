Question ID: 262
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

Step 1: Calculate the total number of marbles Maddison initially has

Maddison has 5 boxes with 50 marbles in each box. To find out the total number of marbles she has, we need to multiply the number of boxes by the number of marbles in each box.

This can be calculated as follows:

5 boxes * 50 marbles/box = 250 marbles

So, Maddison initially has 250 marbles.

Step 2: Add the number of marbles she gets from her friend

Maddison then gets 20 more marbles from her friend. To find out the total number of marbles she now has, we need to add the number of marbles she got from her friend to the initial number of marbles she had.

This can be calculated as follows:

250 marbles + 20 marbles = 270 marbles

So, after getting 20 marbles from her friend, Maddison now has 270 marbles.

Final Answer: Maddison has 270 marbles.
