Question ID: 259
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

Let's start by breaking down the information given in the problem.

We know that Andrea has 52 apples, which is 8 more than Jamal. So, Jamal has 52 - 8 = 44 apples.

We also know that Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples. So, Jamal has 44 + 4 = 48 bananas.

Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal. So, Andrea has 48 / 2 = 24 bananas.

Now, we can add up all the fruits to find the total. 

Andrea has 52 apples + 24 bananas = 76 fruits.
Jamal has 44 apples + 48 bananas = 92 fruits.

So, in total, there are 76 + 92 = 168 fruits. 

Therefore, the final answer is 168 fruits.
