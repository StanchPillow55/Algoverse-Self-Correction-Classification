Question ID: 259
Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

Let's start by identifying what we know from the problem:

1. Andrea has 52 apples.
2. Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal, so Jamal has 52 - 8 = 44 apples.
3. Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples, so Jamal has 44 + 4 = 48 bananas.
4. Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal, so Andrea has 48 / 2 = 24 bananas.

Now, we can add up all the fruits:

- Andrea's apples: 52
- Jamal's apples: 44
- Jamal's bananas: 48
- Andrea's bananas: 24

Adding these together, we get 52 + 44 + 48 + 24 = 168 fruits.

So, there are 168 fruits in total.
