Question ID: 43
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, let's determine how many calories you have left to consume for the day. If your daily calorie target is 2000 and you have already consumed 1800 calories, then you have:

2000 - 1800 = 200 calories left to consume.

Next, we need to find out how many grams of chips correspond to 200 calories. We know that one serving of chips, which is 250 calories, is equivalent to 300g/5 = 60g.

So, we need to find out how many grams of chips correspond to 200 calories. We can set up a proportion to solve this:

(250 calories / 60g) = (200 calories / x g)

Cross-multiplying gives:

250x = 60 * 200

Solving for x gives:

x = (60 * 200) / 250 = 48g

So, if you have 200 calories left for the day, you can eat 48 grams of chips.
