Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to find out how many calories are left for the day. 

2000 (daily calorie target) - 1800 (calories already consumed) = 200 calories

Next, we need to find out how many grams of chips correspond to these 200 calories. 

We know that 1 serving of chips has 250 calories and weighs 300g/5 = 60g. 

Therefore, 1 calorie of chips weighs 60g/250 = 0.24g. 

So, 200 calories of chips weigh 200 * 0.24 = 48g.

Therefore, you can eat 48g of chips.
