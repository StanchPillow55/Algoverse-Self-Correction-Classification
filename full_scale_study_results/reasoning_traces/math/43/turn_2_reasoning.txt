Question ID: 43
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to determine how many calories we have left for the day. We start with a daily target of 2000 calories and have already consumed 1800 calories. 

2000 calories (daily target) - 1800 calories (already consumed) = 200 calories (remaining)

Next, we need to figure out how many grams of chips correspond to these 200 calories. We know that one serving of chips, which is 250 calories, is 300g/5 = 60g. 

So, 250 calories correspond to 60g of chips. 

We can set up a proportion to solve for the unknown quantity of chips (in grams) that correspond to 200 calories:

250 calories / 60g = 200 calories / x g

Cross-multiplying gives us:

250 * x = 200 * 60

Solving for x gives us:

x = (200 * 60) / 250 = 48g

So, if you have already consumed 1800 calories and your daily target is 2000 calories, you can eat 48g of these chips.
