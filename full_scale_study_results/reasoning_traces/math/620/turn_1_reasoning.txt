The problem is asking for the total number of times both DVDs can be played before they break. 

We know that each DVD can be played 1000 times before it breaks. 

The first DVD has already been played 356 times. So, we subtract 356 from 1000 to find out how many more times it can be played. 

1000 - 356 = 644 times

The second DVD has been played 135 times. So, we subtract 135 from 1000 to find out how many more times it can be played. 

1000 - 135 = 865 times

To find the total number of times both DVDs can be played before they break, we add the number of times the first DVD can be played to the number of times the second DVD can be played. 

644 + 865 = 1509 times

So, both DVDs can be played a total of 1509 times before they break.
