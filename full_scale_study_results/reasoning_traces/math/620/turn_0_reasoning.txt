The problem is asking for the total number of times both DVDs can be played before they break. 

We know that each DVD can be played 1000 times before it breaks. 

The first DVD has been played 356 times. So, it can be played 1000 - 356 = 644 more times before it breaks.

The second DVD has been played 135 times. So, it can be played 1000 - 135 = 865 more times before it breaks.

To find the total number of times both DVDs can be played before they break, we add the number of times the first DVD can be played to the number of times the second DVD can be played.

So, 644 + 865 = 1509

Therefore, both DVDs can be played a total of 1509 times before they break.
