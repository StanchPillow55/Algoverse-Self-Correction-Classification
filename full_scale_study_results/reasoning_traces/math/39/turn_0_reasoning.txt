==================================================

First, let's find out Dana's running and walking speeds. 

We know that Dana's skipping speed is 3 miles per hour and that her running speed is twice her skipping speed. So, Dana's running speed is 2 * 3 = <<2*3=6>>6 miles per hour.

We also know that Dana's running speed is four times her walking speed. So, Dana's walking speed is 6 / 4 = <<6/4=1.5>>1.5 miles per hour.

Now, let's calculate how much time Dana spends running and walking. 

We know that Dana spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking. Since the total time is 6 hours, Dana spends 6 / 3 = <<6/3=2>>2 hours running and 6 * 2 / 3 = <<6*2/3=4>>4 hours walking.

Now, let's calculate how many miles Dana can travel running and walking. 

While running, Dana can travel 6 miles per hour * 2 hours = <<6*2=12>>12 miles.

While walking, Dana can travel 1.5 miles per hour * 4 hours = <<1.5*4=6>>6 miles.

So, in total, Dana can travel 12 miles + 6 miles = <<12+6=18>>18 miles in six hours if she spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking. 

So, the final answer is 18 miles.
