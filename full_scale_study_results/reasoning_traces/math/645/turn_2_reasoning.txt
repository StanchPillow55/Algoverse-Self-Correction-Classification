Question ID: 645
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we first need to determine the total amount of flour in one bag. Since each bag is divided into 8 portions of 2 kilograms each, we can find the total amount of flour in one bag by multiplying the number of portions by the weight of each portion.

So, 8 portions * 2 kilograms/portion = 16 kilograms

This means that each bag contains 16 kilograms of flour.

Next, we need to find out how much flour was in three bags in total. We can do this by multiplying the amount of flour in one bag by the number of bags.

So, 16 kilograms/bag * 3 bags = 48 kilograms

This means that there were 48 kilograms of flour in three bags in total, before it was divided into portions.

So, the final answer is 48 kilograms.
