Question ID: 645
Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

The problem states that a bag of flour is divided into 8 portions of 2 kilograms each. To find out how much flour was in one bag, we need to multiply the number of portions by the weight of each portion.

So, 8 portions * 2 kilograms/portion = 16 kilograms

This means that one bag of flour weighed 16 kilograms before it was divided into portions.

The problem then asks how much flour was in three bags in total, before it was divided into portions. To find this, we multiply the weight of one bag by the number of bags.

So, 16 kilograms/bag * 3 bags = 48 kilograms

Therefore, there were 48 kilograms of flour in three bags in total, before it was divided into portions.
