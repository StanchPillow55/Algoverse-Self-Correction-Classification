Question ID: 645
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we first need to determine the total amount of flour in one bag. Since each bag is divided into 8 portions of 2 kilograms each, we multiply the number of portions by the weight of each portion to find the total weight of one bag.

So, 8 portions * 2 kilograms/portion = 16 kilograms/bag.

This means that each bag of flour weighs 16 kilograms before it is divided into portions.

Next, we need to find out how much flour was in three bags in total. We do this by multiplying the weight of one bag by the number of bags.

So, 16 kilograms/bag * 3 bags = 48 kilograms.

Therefore, there were 48 kilograms of flour in three bags in total, before it was divided into portions.
