Question ID: 463
Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we first need to determine the amount of the tip Ashley wants to give. Since the tip is 1/5 of the amount she ordered, and we know that the amount she ordered is $15, we can calculate the tip by multiplying $15 by 1/5.

$15 * 1/5 = $3

So, Ashley wants to give a $3 tip to the delivery man.

To find the total amount that Ashley should give the delivery man, we need to add the cost of the pizza delivery to the tip.

$15 (cost of the pizza delivery) + $3 (tip) = $18

Therefore, Ashley should give the delivery man a total of $18.
