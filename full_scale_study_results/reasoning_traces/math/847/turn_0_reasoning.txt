==================================================

The formula for simple interest is I = PRT, where I is the interest, P is the principal amount (the initial amount of money), R is the rate of interest per year, and T is the time the money is invested for in years.

In this case, Brenda's principal amount (P) is $300. The rate of interest (R) is three-quarters of the original amount per year, which is 0.75 or 75% per year. The time (T) is 3 years.

First, we need to calculate the interest Brenda will earn over the 3 years.

I = PRT
I = $300 * 0.75 * 3
I = $675

So, Brenda will earn $675 in interest over the 3 years.

To find out how much in total she will have after 3 years, we need to add this interest to her original investment.

Total = P + I
Total = $300 + $675
Total = $975

So, Brenda will have $975 in total after 3 years.
