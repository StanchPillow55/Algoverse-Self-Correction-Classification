Question ID: 906
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, let's calculate how many blue shoe boxes are left after Tim uses 3 for fishing. 

He initially has 7 blue shoe boxes. If he uses 3, we subtract 3 from 7:

7 - 3 = 4 blue shoe boxes left.

Next, let's calculate how many red shoe boxes are left. Tim uses 1/3 of his red shoe boxes for fishing. 

He initially has 9 red shoe boxes. To find out how many he uses for fishing, we multiply 9 by 1/3:

9 * 1/3 = 3 red shoe boxes used for fishing.

To find out how many red shoe boxes are left, we subtract the number used for fishing from the initial number:

9 - 3 = 6 red shoe boxes left.

So, after going fishing, Tim has 4 blue shoe boxes and 6 red shoe boxes left in his box.
