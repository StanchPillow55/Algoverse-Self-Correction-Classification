Question ID: 906
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, let's calculate how many blue shoe boxes are left after Tim uses 3 for fishing. He initially had 7 blue shoe boxes, so after using 3, he has:

7 blue shoe boxes - 3 blue shoe boxes = 4 blue shoe boxes

Next, let's calculate how many red shoe boxes are left. Tim uses 1/3 of his red shoe boxes for fishing. He initially had 9 red shoe boxes, so the number of red shoe boxes he uses for fishing is:

1/3 * 9 red shoe boxes = 3 red shoe boxes

So, after using 3 red shoe boxes for fishing, he has:

9 red shoe boxes - 3 red shoe boxes = 6 red shoe boxes

Therefore, after going fishing, Tim has 4 blue shoe boxes and 6 red shoe boxes left in his box.
