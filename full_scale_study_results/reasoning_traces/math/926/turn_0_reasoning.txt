First, let's calculate how much Colby has spent so far.

He saw 5 movies on a Friday or Saturday, which cost $10 each. So, he spent 5 * $10 = $<<5*10=50>>50 on Friday or Saturday movies.

He saw 8 movies on other days, which cost $7 each. So, he spent 8 * $7 = $<<8*7=56>>56 on movies on other days.

He had 2 tubs of popcorn, which cost $8 each. So, he spent 2 * $8 = $<<2*8=16>>16 on popcorn.

He had 4 boxes of candy, which cost $2 each. So, he spent 4 * $2 = $<<4*2=8>>8 on candy.

So, in total, Colby has spent $50 + $56 + $16 + $8 = $<<50+56+16+8=130>>130 so far.

Colby's parents give him $150 to spend at the movies every month. So, he has $150 - $130 = $<<150-130=20>>20 left to spend.

He wants to get a popcorn and a box of candy on the last day of the month, which will cost him $8 + $2 = $<<8+2=10>>10.

So, after buying popcorn and candy, he will have $20 - $10 = $<<20-10=10>>10 left.

Since it's a Friday, movie tickets cost $10. So, with the remaining money, Colby can see 1 more movie. 

So, the final answer is that Colby can see 1 more movie.
