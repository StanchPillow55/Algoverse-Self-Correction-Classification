==================================================

First, let's calculate how much money Colby has spent so far.

He saw 5 movies on a Friday or Saturday, and each of those tickets cost $10. So, he spent 5 * $10 = $50 on those tickets.

He saw 8 movies on other days, and each of those tickets cost $7. So, he spent 8 * $7 = $56 on those tickets.

He had 2 tubs of popcorn, and each tub cost $8. So, he spent 2 * $8 = $16 on popcorn.

He had 4 boxes of candy, and each box cost $2. So, he spent 4 * $2 = $8 on candy.

Adding all these expenses together, Colby has spent $50 + $56 + $16 + $8 = $130 so far this month.

His parents give him $150 to spend at the movies each month, so he has $150 - $130 = $20 left to spend.

He wants to get a popcorn and a box of candy on the last day of the month, which will cost him $8 + $2 = $10.

Subtracting this from the amount he has left gives $20 - $10 = $10.

Since it's a Friday, tickets cost $10, so he can afford to see 1 more movie. 

So, Colby can see 1 more movie this month.
