Dataset Type: math
==================================================

Let's break down the problem:

On the first day, Conor saw 50 people at the beach.

On the second day, he saw 20 more people than the first day, which means he saw 50 + 20 = 70 people.

On the third day, the total number of people increased to twice the number that were there on the second day, which means he saw 2 * 70 = 140 people.

For the rest of the week (which is 4 days, since a week has 7 days and we already accounted for 3), Conor saw an average of 60 people each day. This means he saw 60 * 4 = 240 people over those 4 days.

To find the total number of people Conor saw at the beach that week, we add up the number of people he saw each day:

50 (first day) + 70 (second day) + 140 (third day) + 240 (next four days) = 500 people.

So, Conor saw a total of 500 people at the beach that week.
