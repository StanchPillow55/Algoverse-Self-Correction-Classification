Question ID: 738
Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

Let's start by finding out how many books Steven has. Since Clara has two times as many books as Steven and Clara has 20 books, Steven has 20/2 = 10 books.

Alice has 6 more books than Steven, so Alice has 10 + 6 = 16 books.

To find out how many more books Clara has than Alice, we subtract the number of Alice's books from the number of Clara's books. So, Clara has 20 - 16 = 4 more books than Alice.

So, the final answer is that Clara has 4 more books than Alice.
