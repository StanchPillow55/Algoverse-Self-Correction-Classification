Question ID: 966
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, let's convert all the dozens of brownies to individual brownies. 

1 dozen = 12 brownies. 

So, Greta made 1 dozen cream cheese swirl brownies, which is 1*12 = 12 brownies.

At her office, they sent her home with 1/2 a dozen brownies. 1/2 dozen is 1/2*12 = 6 brownies.

Her friends had 4 dozen brownies waiting, which is 4*12 = 48 brownies.

During the party, 1 1/2 dozen brownies were eaten. 1 1/2 dozen is 1.5*12 = 18 brownies.

Now, let's add up all the brownies Greta had initially:

12 (from her own baking) + 6 (from her office) + 48 (from her friends) = 66 brownies.

Then, subtract the brownies that were eaten during the party:

66 - 18 = 48 brownies.

So, Greta had 48 individual brownies left over from the entire day.
