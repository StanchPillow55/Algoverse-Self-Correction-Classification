==================================================

First, we need to convert all the quantities of brownies into the same unit. Since a dozen is equal to 12, we can convert all the dozens into individual brownies.

Greta made a batch of cream cheese swirl brownies for herself, which is one dozen. So, she made 1 dozen * 12 = <<1*12=12>>12 brownies.

At her office, they gave her half a dozen brownies. So, she received 1/2 dozen * 12 = <<1/2*12=6>>6 brownies.

Her friends had 4 dozen brownies waiting for her at the surprise party. So, there were 4 dozen * 12 = <<4*12=48>>48 brownies.

During the party, 1 1/2 dozen brownies were eaten. So, 1 1/2 dozen * 12 = <<1.5*12=18>>18 brownies were eaten.

To find out how many brownies Greta had left over from the entire day, we need to add up all the brownies she had and then subtract the number of brownies that were eaten.

So, Greta had 12 (her own) + 6 (from office) + 48 (from friends) = <<12+6+48=66>>66 brownies in total.

Then, we subtract the number of brownies that were eaten from the total number of brownies. So, 66 - 18 = <<66-18=48>>48 brownies were left over.

Therefore, Greta had 48 individual brownies left over from the entire day.
