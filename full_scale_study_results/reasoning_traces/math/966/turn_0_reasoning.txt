==================================================

First, let's convert all the dozens of brownies to individual brownies. 

Greta made a batch of brownies for herself, which was one dozen. One dozen is equal to 12, so she made 12 brownies.

At her office, they gave her half a dozen brownies. Half a dozen is equal to 6, so she received 6 brownies from her office.

Her friends had 4 dozen brownies waiting for her at the surprise party. Four dozen is equal to 48, so her friends made 48 brownies.

During the party, 1 1/2 dozen brownies were eaten. One and a half dozen is equal to 18, so 18 brownies were eaten at the party.

Now, let's add up all the brownies Greta had:

12 (from her batch) + 6 (from her office) + 48 (from her friends) = 66 brownies

Then, subtract the brownies that were eaten at the party:

66 - 18 = 48 brownies

So, Greta had 48 individual brownies left over from the entire day.
