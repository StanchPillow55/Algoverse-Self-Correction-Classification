To solve this problem, we need to analyze the information provided in the passage and use it to answer the query.

Given information:
- The United Nations is asking for urgent aid for the victims of the flooding in Pakistan.
- The aid requested for Pakistan is only half the amount the world body asked for in the aftermath of Haiti's devastating earthquake this year.

- The money poured in for survivors of Haiti's quake, but the funds are only slowly trickling in for people left homeless or ill in the wake of widespread flooding in Pakistan.

Query: In @placeholder, pictures of the collapsed presidential palace and vast tent cities tugged at hearts.

1. The aid requested for Pakistan is only half the amount the world body asked for in the aftermath of Haiti's earthquake.
2. The money poure
