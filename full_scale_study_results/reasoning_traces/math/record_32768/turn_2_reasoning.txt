==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to analyze the information provided in the passage and determine the probability of the person losing their balance and falling into the tracks.

Given information:
- The video shows two men jumping across subway platforms in Brooklyn, New York.
- The platforms are located at the 9th Avenue and 39st stop on the D line.
- One of the men "almost loses his balance and topples into the tracks."

To calculate the probability of the person losing their balance and falling into the tracks, we need to consider the following factors:

1. Distance between the platforms:
   - The passage does not provide the exact distance between the platforms, but we can assume it is a significant distance, as the act is described as "life-risking" and "dangerous."
   - The wider the gap between the platforms, the higher the probability of the person losing their balance and falling.

2. Platform width:
   - The passage does not provide the width of the platforms, but we can assume they are standard subway platform widths, which are typically around 12-15 feet (3.7-4.6 meters).
   - A narrower platform would make it more challenging for
