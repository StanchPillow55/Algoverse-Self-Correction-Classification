==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to analyze the information provided in the passage and determine the probability of one of the daredevils losing their balance and falling into the tracks.

Given information:
- The video shows two men jumping across subway platforms in Brooklyn, New York.
- The platforms are located at the 9th Avenue and 39th Street stop on the D line.
- The two men appear to be in their late teens or early twenties.
- One of the men almost loses his balance and topples into the tracks.

To calculate the probability of one of the daredevils falling into the tracks, we need to consider the following factors:

1. The distance between the platforms:
   - The passage does not provide the exact distance between the platforms, but we can assume it is a typical subway platform distance, which is usually around 4-5 feet.
   - The risk of falling increases as the distance between the platforms increases.

2. The height of the platforms:
   - Subway platforms are typically around 3-4 feet high.
   - The higher the platforms, the greater the risk of injury or death if someone falls.

3. The presence of a
