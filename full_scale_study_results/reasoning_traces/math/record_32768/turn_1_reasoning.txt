Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to analyze the information provided in the passage and determine the probability of one of the daredevils losing their balance and falling into the tracks.

Given information:
- The video shows two men jumping across subway platforms in Brooklyn, New York.
- The platforms are located at the 9th Avenue and 39th Street stop on the D line.
- The two men appear to be in their late teens or early twenties.
- One of the men almost loses his balance and topples into the tracks.

Step 1: Identify the relevant factors that could affect the probability of the man losing his balance.
Factors to consider:
- Distance between the platforms
- Width of the platforms
- Condition of the platforms (e.g., slippery, uneven)
- Physical abilities and coordination of the jumpers
- Potential distractions or environmental factors

Step 2: Estimate the distance between the platforms.
The passage does not provide the exact distance, but we can make an educated guess based on typical subway platform dimensions.
Assuming a standard subway platform width of around 12 feet, the distance between the platforms is likely to be in the
