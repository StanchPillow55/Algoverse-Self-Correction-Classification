Question ID: 765
Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to find out how many pears George has. We know that George has 45% more pears than bananas. Since George has 200 bananas, we can calculate the number of pears as follows:

45% of 200 bananas = 0.45 * 200 = 90 pears

So, George has 90 more pears than bananas, which means he has 200 bananas + 90 pears = 290 pears.

Now, we can calculate the total number of fruits George has:

200 bananas + 290 pears = 490 fruits

So, George has 490 fruits.
