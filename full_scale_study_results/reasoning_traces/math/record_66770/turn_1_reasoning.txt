Question ID: record_66770
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

I apologize, but I do not have enough information to solve this problem. The passage provided does not contain any numerical data or mathematical information that I can use to perform calculations. The passage is about an investigation into the Boston bombing suspect Tamerlan Tsarnaev and his connections to a group called The Union of the Just. There is no mention of anyone being in jail on charges of resisting police in an unrelated matter. Without any quantitative information or a clear mathematical question, I am unable to demonstrate step-by-step reasoning or provide a final answer. I am a math problem solver, but I cannot generate a solution without the necessary mathematical components in the problem statement. Please provide more specific information if you would like me to attempt to solve a math-related problem.
