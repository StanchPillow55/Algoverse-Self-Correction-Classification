==================================================

I apologize, but I do not see a math problem in the given passage. The passage discusses an investigation into the Boston bombing suspect Tamerlan Tsarnaev and his connections to a distant cousin named Magomed Kartashov, who is the founder of an Islamist group called "The Union of the Just". 

The query at the end states that "@placeholder is currently in jail on charges of resisting police in an unrelated matter." However, there is no information provided in the passage about a "@placeholder" person or any math-related problem.

Without a clear math problem statement and the necessary information to solve it, I am unable to provide a step-by-step solution or a final answer. If you could restate the problem in a more explicit mathematical form, I would be happy to assist you further.
