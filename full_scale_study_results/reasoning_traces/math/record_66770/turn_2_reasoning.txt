Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

I apologize, but I do not have enough information to solve this problem. The passage provided does not contain any numerical data or mathematical information that I can use to perform calculations. The passage is about an investigation into the Boston bombing suspect Tamerlan Tsarnaev and his potential connections to an Islamist group leader named Magomed Kartashov. Without any specific numbers, quantities, or mathematical relationships in the text, I cannot generate a meaningful solution. If you could provide additional details or a more clearly defined mathematical question, I would be happy to try solving it step-by-step. However, based on the information given in the passage alone, I do not have the necessary elements to work through a math problem. Please let me know if you can rephrase the question in a way that involves numerical data or mathematical concepts.
