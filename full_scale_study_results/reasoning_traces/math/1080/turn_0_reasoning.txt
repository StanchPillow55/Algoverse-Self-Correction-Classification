Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to figure out how many seconds are in 4 hours. 

There are 60 seconds in a minute and 60 minutes in an hour, so there are 60*60 = 3600 seconds in an hour.

Therefore, in 4 hours, there are 4*3600 = 14400 seconds.

If each spring creates a new jellyfish every second, then in 14400 seconds, each spring would create 14400 jellyfish.

If there are 5 springs all working at this rate, then together they would create 5*14400 = 72000 jellyfish in 4 hours.

So, the final answer is that 5 springs would create 72000 jellyfish in 4 hours.
