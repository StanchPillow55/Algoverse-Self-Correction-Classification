Question ID: 1080
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to determine how many seconds are in 4 hours. 

There are 60 seconds in a minute and 60 minutes in an hour, so there are 60*60 = 3600 seconds in an hour. 

Therefore, there are 3600*4 = 14,400 seconds in 4 hours.

Since each spring creates a new jellyfish every second, in 4 hours, one spring would create 14,400 jellyfish.

If we have 5 springs working at the same rate, they would create 5*14,400 = 72,000 jellyfish in 4 hours.

So, the final answer is 72,000 jellyfish.
