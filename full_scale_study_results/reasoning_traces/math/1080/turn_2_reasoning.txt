Question ID: 1080
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to determine how many seconds are in 4 hours. 

We know that:
1 minute = 60 seconds
1 hour = 60 minutes

Therefore, 1 hour = 60 minutes/hour * 60 seconds/minute = 3600 seconds

So, 4 hours = 4 * 3600 seconds = 14400 seconds

Now, we know that each spring creates 1 jellyfish per second. So, in 4 hours (or 14400 seconds), each spring would create 14400 jellyfish.

Finally, if we have 5 springs all working at the same rate, they would collectively create 5 * 14400 jellyfish = 72000 jellyfish in 4 hours.

So, the final answer is that 5 springs would create 72000 jellyfish in 4 hours.
