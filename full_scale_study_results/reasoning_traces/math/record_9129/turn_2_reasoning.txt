Question ID: record_9129
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine who the placeholder "@placeholder" refers to in the given passage.

Given information:
- The passage mentions that Ian Brady compared himself to Jack the Ripper, saying that he is as notorious as Jack the Ripper.
- The passage also mentions that Brady complained that the public and media remained as "obsessed" with his crimes as with @placeholder's.

Based on the context, the placeholder "@placeholder" likely refers to Jack the Ripper, as Brady made a direct comparison between himself and Jack the Ripper in the passage.

Therefore, the final answer is:
Jack the Ripper
