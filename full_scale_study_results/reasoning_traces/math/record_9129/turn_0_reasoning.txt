Question ID: record_9129
Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine who the placeholder "@placeholder" represents in the given passage.

Given information:
- The passage mentions that Ian Brady compared his notoriety to that of Jack the Ripper.
- The query states that Brady claimed the public and media remained as "obsessed" with his crimes as with "@placeholder's".

Based on the context, the placeholder "@placeholder" likely refers to Jack the Ripper, as Brady made a direct comparison between his own notoriety and that of Jack the Ripper.

Therefore, the complete answer to the query is:

Claiming that he was the real victim, Brady – who has fought for a public hearing over the state of his mental health for a decade – complained that the public and media remained as 'obsessed' with his crimes as with Jack the Ripper's.
