Question ID: record_9129
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine who the placeholder "@placeholder" refers to in the given passage.

Given information:
- The passage mentions that Ian Brady compared himself to Jack the Ripper, saying that "they still talk about Jack the Ripper because of the drama. Mine's the same."
- The passage also states that Brady "complained that the public and media remained as 'obsessed' with his crimes as with @placeholder's."

Based on the context, the placeholder "@placeholder" is likely referring to Jack the Ripper, as Brady explicitly compared himself to this notorious historical figure.

Therefore, the final answer is:

The placeholder "@placeholder" refers to Jack the Ripper.
