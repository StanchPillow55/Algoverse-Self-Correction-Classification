Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to find the cost of the two most expensive Rolls-Royce Phantoms that Stephen Hung ordered.

Given information:
- Stephen Hung ordered 30 bespoke Rolls-Royce Phantoms for £20 million.
- The two most expensive Phantoms in the fleet will feature external and internal gold-plated detailing.

Step 1: Calculate the cost of each Rolls-Royce Phantom.
Total cost of 30 Phantoms = £20 million
Cost of each Phantom = Total cost / Number of Phantoms
Cost of each Phantom = £20 million / 30 = £666,666.67

Step 2: Determine the additional cost of the two most expensive Phantoms with gold-plated detailing.
Since the passage states that these two Phantoms are the "most luxurious vehicles Rolls-Royce has ever built," we can assume that the additional cost for the gold-plated detailing is significant.
Let's estimate the additional cost for the gold-plating to be 50% of the base cost of each Phantom
