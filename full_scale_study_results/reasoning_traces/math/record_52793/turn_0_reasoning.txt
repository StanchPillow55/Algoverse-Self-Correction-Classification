==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the cost of the 30 Rolls-Royce Phantoms and the cost of the two most expensive Phantoms.

Given information:
- The businessman, Stephen Hung, has splashed out £20 million on 30 bespoke Rolls-Royce Phantoms.
- The two most expensive Phantoms will feature external and internal gold-plated detailing.

Step 1: Calculate the cost of the 30 Rolls-Royce Phantoms.
Total cost of 30 Rolls-Royce Phantoms = £20 million

Step 2: Calculate the cost of the two most expensive Phantoms.
Since the passage does not provide the specific cost of the two most expensive Phantoms, we cannot determine the exact cost. However, we can infer that the two most expensive Phantoms are part of the 30 Phantoms ordered, and their cost is included in the total cost of £20 million.

Therefore, the final answer is:
The businessman, Stephen Hung, has splashed out £20 million on 30 bespoke
