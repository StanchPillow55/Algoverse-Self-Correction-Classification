Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the cost of the 30 Rolls-Royce Phantoms and the cost of the two most expensive Phantoms.

Given information:
- The businessman, Stephen Hung, has splashed out £20 million on 30 bespoke Rolls-Royce Phantoms.
- The two most expensive Phantoms will feature external and internal gold-plated detailing.

Step 1: Calculate the cost of the 30 Rolls-Royce Phantoms.
Total cost of 30 Rolls-Royce Phantoms = £20 million

Step 2: Calculate the cost of the two most expensive Phantoms.
Since the passage states that the two most expensive Phantoms will feature external and internal gold-plated detailing, we can assume that the cost of these two Phantoms will be higher than the cost of the other 28 Phantoms.
However, the passage does not provide the exact cost of the two most expensive Phantoms.

Therefore, the final answer is:
The businessman, Stephen Hung, has splashed out £20 million on
