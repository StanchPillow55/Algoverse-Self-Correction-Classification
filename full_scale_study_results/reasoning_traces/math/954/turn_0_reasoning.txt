Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

Jonathan has two dozen measuring cups. Since a dozen is 12, two dozen cups are 2*12 = <<2*12=24>>24 cups.

Jonathan has 2/3 as many measuring spoons as measuring cups, meaning he has 2/3*24 = <<2/3*24=16>>16 measuring spoons.

The total number of utensils Jonathan has is the sum of the measuring cups and spoons, which is 24 cups + 16 spoons = <<24+16=40>>40 utensils.

If he gifts Pedro 6 measuring spoons, the number of utensils he remains with is 40 utensils - 6 spoons = <<40-6=34>>34 utensils.

Jonathan has 34 utensils remaining.
