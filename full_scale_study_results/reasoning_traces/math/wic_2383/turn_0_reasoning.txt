==================================================

To determine if the word "charge" is used with the same meaning in both sentences, we need to analyze the context and meaning of the word in each sentence.

Sentence 1: "This cartridge has a powder charge of 50 grains."
In this sentence, the word "charge" refers to the amount of gunpowder or propellant contained within the cartridge. This is a specific measurement of the quantity of explosive material used in the cartridge.

Sentence 2: "The battery needed a fresh charge."
In this sentence, the word "charge" refers to the process of replenishing the electrical energy stored in a battery. This is a different meaning of the word "charge" compared to the first sentence.

Therefore, the word "charge" is not used with the same meaning in both sentences. In the first sentence, it refers to a measurement of gunpowder, while in the second sentence, it refers to the process of recharging a battery.

Final answer: No, the word "charge" is not used with the same meaning in both sentences.
