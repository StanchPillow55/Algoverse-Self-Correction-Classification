==================================================

To determine if the word "charge" is used with the same meaning in both sentences, we need to analyze the context and meaning of the word in each sentence.

Sentence 1: "This cartridge has a powder charge of 50 grains."
In this sentence, the word "charge" refers to the amount of gunpowder or propellant used in a cartridge or ammunition. This is a specific technical term used in the context of firearms and ammunition.

Sentence 2: "The battery needed a fresh charge."
In this sentence, the word "charge" refers to the process of restoring the electrical energy stored in a battery. This is a common usage of the word "charge" in the context of electrical devices and batteries.

Based on the analysis, the word "charge" is not used with the same meaning in both sentences. In the first sentence, it refers to the powder charge in a cartridge, while in the second sentence, it refers to the electrical charge of a battery.

Therefore, the answer is:
No, the word "charge" is not used with the same meaning in both sentences.
