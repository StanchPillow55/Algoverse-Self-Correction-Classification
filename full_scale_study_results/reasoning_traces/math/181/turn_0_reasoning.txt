==================================================

First, let's denote the number of white carnations as x. 

According to the problem, Sandra ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations. This means she ordered 4x red roses.

The problem also states that Sandra ordered 200 pink calla lilies, which were five times the number of white carnations. This means 5x = 200.

To find the value of x, we need to solve the equation 5x = 200. Dividing both sides of the equation by 5, we get x = 200 / 5 = 40.

So, Sandra ordered 40 white carnations.

Substituting x = 40 into the equation for the number of red roses, we get 4x = 4 * 40 = 160.

Therefore, to keep Sandra's business, Fred must deliver 160 red roses by 5 pm.
