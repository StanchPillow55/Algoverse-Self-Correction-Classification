Question ID: 181
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine how many red roses Sandra ordered, which will tell us how many Fred needs to deliver.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Define Variables:**
   - Let \( x \) be the number of white carnations Sandra ordered.

2. **Relate Pink Calla Lilies to White Carnations:**
   - Sandra ordered 200 pink calla lilies, which is five times the number of white carnations.
   - Therefore, we can write the equation: 
     \[
     5x = 200
     \]

3. **Solve for \( x \):**
   - Divide both sides of the equation by 5 to find \( x \):
     \[
     x = \frac{200}{5} = 40
     \]
   - So, Sandra ordered 40 white carnations.

4. **Relate Red Roses to White Carnations:**
   - Sandra ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations.
   - Therefore, the number of red roses is:
     \[
     4x = 4 \times 40 = 160
     \]

5. **Conclusion:**
   - Sandra ordered 160 red roses. Therefore, Fred must deliver 160 red roses by 5 pm to fulfill the order.

**Final Answer:**
Fred must deliver 160 red roses by 5 pm.
