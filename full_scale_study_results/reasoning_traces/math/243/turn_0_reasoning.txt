==================================================

Jason's daily call to his boss lasts 15 minutes. Over the course of a 30-day month, this amounts to 15 minutes/day * 30 days = 450 minutes.

In addition to these calls, Jason has also used an extra 300 minutes this month.

So, the total minutes Jason has used this month is 450 minutes (for his boss) + 300 minutes (extra) = 750 minutes.

Jason's phone plan allows for 1000 minutes per month. Therefore, the number of minutes Jason has left is 1000 minutes (total) - 750 minutes (used) = 250 minutes.

So, Jason has 250 minutes left on his phone plan for this month.
