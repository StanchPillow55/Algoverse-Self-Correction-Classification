Question ID: 999
Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

Let's denote the size of the slice that each kid gets as "x". Therefore, each adult gets a slice that is twice as big, or "2x".

Since there are 4 kids and 2 adults in the family, the whole watermelon is divided into 4x (for the kids) + 2*2x (for the adults) = 4x + 4x = 8x.

We want to find out what percentage of the watermelon each adult gets, which is 2x out of the total 8x. 

To find this percentage, we divide the size of the adult's slice by the total size of the watermelon and multiply by 100:

(2x / 8x) * 100 = 25%

So, each adult gets 25% of the watermelon.
