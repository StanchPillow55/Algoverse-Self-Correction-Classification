Question ID: 1036
Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to find out how many apples Uncle Franky has in total. Since there are 40 apples in one box and he ordered two boxes, we multiply 40 by 2. 

40 apples/box * 2 boxes = 80 apples

Next, we need to find out how many packs of apples Uncle Franky can make. Since he is planning to pack the apples with eight apples in one pack, we divide the total number of apples by the number of apples in one pack.

80 apples รท 8 apples/pack = 10 packs

Therefore, Uncle Franky can make 10 packs of apples with the two boxes of apples.
