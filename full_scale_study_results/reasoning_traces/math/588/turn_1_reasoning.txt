Question ID: 588
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, let's list out the three measurements of Jared's typing speed. 

The first measurement is 47 WPM. 
The second measurement, after some lessons, is 52 WPM. 
If he increases his typing speed once more by 5 words, the third measurement will be 52 + 5 = 57 WPM. 

To find the average of these three measurements, we add them together and then divide by the number of measurements, which is 3. 

So, the sum of the three measurements is 47 + 52 + 57 = 156 WPM. 

Then, we divide this sum by 3 to find the average: 156 รท 3 = 52 WPM. 

Therefore, the average of the three measurements of Jared's typing speed is 52 words per minute.
