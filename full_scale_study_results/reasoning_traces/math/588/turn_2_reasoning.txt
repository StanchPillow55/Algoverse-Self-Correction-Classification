Question ID: 588
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To find the average of the three measurements, we first need to find the total number of words per minute (WPM) Jared typed across all three measurements.

First, we know that Jared started with a typing speed of 47 WPM. After some lessons, his typing speed increased to 52 WPM. If he increases his typing speed once more by 5 words, his new typing speed will be 52 WPM + 5 WPM = 57 WPM.

Now, we add up all three measurements to find the total number of words Jared typed across all three measurements. This is 47 WPM + 52 WPM + 57 WPM = 156 WPM.

To find the average typing speed, we divide the total number of words typed by the number of measurements. In this case, we divide 156 WPM by 3 (since there are three measurements), which gives us an average typing speed of 156 WPM / 3 = 52 WPM.

So, if Jared continues to increase his typing speed once more by 5 words, the average of the three measurements will be 52 words per minute.
