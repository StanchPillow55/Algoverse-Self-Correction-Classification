Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To find the average of the three measurements, we first need to find the total sum of the three measurements and then divide it by the number of measurements.

The first measurement is 47 WPM, the second is 52 WPM, and if he increases his speed by 5 words again, the third measurement will be 52 + 5 = 57 WPM.

So, the total sum of the three measurements is 47 + 52 + 57 = 156 WPM.

There are three measurements, so to find the average, we divide the total sum by the number of measurements.

Average = Total Sum / Number of Measurements
Average = 156 WPM / 3
Average = 52 WPM

So, the average of the three measurements is 52 words per minute.
