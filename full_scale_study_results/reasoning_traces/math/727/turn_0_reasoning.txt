Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to calculate the total number of windows in the students' cars and the teachers' cars.

For the students' cars, there are 64 cars and each car has 4 windows. So, the total number of windows in the students' cars is 64 cars * 4 windows/car = 256 windows.

For the teachers' cars, there are 32 cars and each car has 2 windows. So, the total number of windows in the teachers' cars is 32 cars * 2 windows/car = 64 windows.

Now, we know that Hannah smashes a quarter of the students' cars' windows and 3/4ths of the teachers' cars' windows. 

So, the number of students' cars' windows that Hannah smashes is 1/4 * 256 windows = 64 windows.

And, the number of teachers' cars' windows that Hannah smashes is 3/4 * 64 windows = 48 windows.

Adding these two quantities together, the total number of windows that Hannah smashes is 64 windows + 48 windows = 112 windows.

So, Hannah smashes 112 windows.
