==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to set up equations based on the information given and solve for the number of Pokemon each person has caught.

Let's define:
- \( A \) as the number of Pokemon Alex has caught.
- \( S \) as the number of Pokemon Stan has caught.
- \( W \) as the number of Pokemon Adelwolfe has caught.

We are given the following information:
1. Together, they have caught 339 Pokemon:
   \[
   A + S + W = 339
   \]

2. Alex has caught 5 more Pokemon than Stan:
   \[
   A = S + 5
   \]

3. Stan has caught 13 less than 4 times as many Pokemon as Adelwolfe:
   \[
   S = 4W - 13
   \]

Now, we will substitute the expressions for \( A \) and \( S \) from equations 2 and 3 into equation 1.

Substitute \( A = S + 5 \) and \( S = 4W - 13 \) into the first equation:
\[
(S + 5) + S + W = 339
\]

Substitute \( S = 4W - 13 \) into the equation:
\[
((4W - 13) + 5) + (4W - 13) + W = 339
\]

Simplify the equation:
\[
(4W - 13 + 5) + 4W - 13 + W = 339
\]

Combine like terms:
\[
4W + 4W + W - 13 + 5 - 13 = 339
\]

\[
9W - 21 = 339
\]

Add 21 to both sides to solve for \( W \):
\[
9W = 360
\]

Divide both sides by 9:
\[
W = 40
\]

Now that we have \( W = 40 \), we can find \( S \) using the equation \( S = 4W - 13 \):
\[
S = 4(40) - 13
\]

\[
S = 160 - 13
\]

\[
S = 147
\]

Thus, Stan has caught 147 Pokemon.

Final Answer:
Stan has caught 147 Pokemon.
