==================================================

Let's denote the number of Pokemon caught by Alex, Stan, and Adelwolfe as A, S, and Ad respectively.

From the problem, we know that:

A + S + Ad = 339 (equation 1)

We also know that Alex has caught 5 more than Stan, which can be written as:

A = S + 5 (equation 2)

And Stan has caught 13 less than 4 times as many as Adelwolfe has caught, which can be written as:

S = 4Ad - 13 (equation 3)

Now we can use these equations to solve for the number of Pokemon each person has caught.

Let's substitute equation 2 and equation 3 into equation 1:

(S + 5) + (4Ad - 13) + Ad = 339

Simplify this to:

S + 5Ad - 8 = 339

Rearrange this to:

S + 5Ad = 347

Substitute equation 3 into this equation:

4Ad - 13 + 5Ad = 347

Combine like terms:

9Ad - 13 = 347

Add 13 to both sides:

9Ad = 360

Divide both sides by 9:

Ad = 40

Now that we know Adelwolfe has caught 40 Pokemon, we can substitute this into equation 3 to find out how many Stan has caught:

S = 4*40 - 13

S = 160 - 13

S = 147

So, Stan has caught 147 Pokemon.
