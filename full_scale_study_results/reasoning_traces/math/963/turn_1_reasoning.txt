==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to set up equations based on the information given and solve for the number of Pokemon each person has caught.

Let's define the variables:
- Let \( A \) be the number of Pokemon Alex has caught.
- Let \( S \) be the number of Pokemon Stan has caught.
- Let \( W \) be the number of Pokemon Adelwolfe has caught.

We are given the following information:
1. Together, they have caught 339 Pokemon: 
   \[
   A + S + W = 339
   \]

2. Alex has caught 5 more Pokemon than Stan:
   \[
   A = S + 5
   \]

3. Stan has caught 13 less than 4 times as many as Adelwolfe:
   \[
   S = 4W - 13
   \]

Now, we have a system of three equations:
1. \( A + S + W = 339 \)
2. \( A = S + 5 \)
3. \( S = 4W - 13 \)

We can substitute equations (2) and (3) into equation (1) to solve for \( W \).

Substitute \( A = S + 5 \) into equation (1):
\[
(S + 5) + S + W = 339
\]
Simplify:
\[
2S + W + 5 = 339
\]
Subtract 5 from both sides:
\[
2S + W = 334
\]

Substitute \( S = 4W - 13 \) into the equation \( 2S + W = 334 \):
\[
2(4W - 13) + W = 334
\]
Distribute the 2:
\[
8W - 26 + W = 334
\]
Combine like terms:
\[
9W - 26 = 334
\]
Add 26 to both sides:
\[
9W = 360
\]
Divide by 9:
\[
W = 40
\]

Now that we have \( W = 40 \), we can find \( S \) using equation (3):
\[
S = 4W - 13 = 4(40) - 13 = 160 - 13 = 147
\]

Finally, we can verify by finding \( A \) using equation (2):
\[
A = S + 5 = 147 + 5 = 152
\]

Check the total:
\[
A + S + W = 152 + 147 + 40 = 339
\]

Everything checks out, so the number of Pokemon Stan has caught is \(\boxed{147}\).
