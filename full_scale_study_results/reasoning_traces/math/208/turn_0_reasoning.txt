Question ID: 208
Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

On Monday, Rose bought 4 cakes.

On Tuesday, she bought three times the number of cakes she bought on Monday. So, she bought 3 * 4 = <<3*4=12>>12 cakes.

On Wednesday, she bought five times the number of cakes she bought on Tuesday. So, she bought 5 * 12 = <<5*12=60>>60 cakes.

To find the total number of cakes she bought over the three days, we add the number of cakes she bought each day. 

So, 4 (Monday) + 12 (Tuesday) + 60 (Wednesday) = 76 cakes.

Therefore, Rose bought 76 cakes over the three days.
