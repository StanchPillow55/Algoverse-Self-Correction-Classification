Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to determine how many pounds of ground beef Aiden will need to make 80 meatballs. Since he gets 16 meatballs from each pound of meat, we can divide the total number of meatballs he wants to make by the number of meatballs he gets from each pound of meat.

80 meatballs รท 16 meatballs/pound = 5 pounds of ground beef

Next, we need to determine how much seasoning Aiden will need for 5 pounds of ground beef. Since he uses 2 tablespoons of seasoning for each pound of ground beef, we can multiply the number of pounds of ground beef by the amount of seasoning he uses per pound.

5 pounds ร 2 tablespoons/pound = 10 tablespoons of seasoning

So, Aiden will need 10 tablespoons of his secret steakhouse seasoning to make 80 meatballs.
