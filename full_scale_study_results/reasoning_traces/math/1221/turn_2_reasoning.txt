Question ID: 1221
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to determine how many pounds of ground beef Aiden will need to make 80 meatballs. Since he gets 16 meatballs from each pound of meat, we divide the total number of meatballs by the number of meatballs per pound:

80 meatballs รท 16 meatballs/pound = 5 pounds of ground beef

Next, we need to calculate how much seasoning Aiden will need. He uses 2 tablespoons of seasoning for each pound of ground beef, so we multiply the number of pounds by the amount of seasoning per pound:

5 pounds ร 2 tablespoons/pound = 10 tablespoons of seasoning

So, Aiden will need 10 tablespoons of his secret steakhouse seasoning to make 80 meatballs.
