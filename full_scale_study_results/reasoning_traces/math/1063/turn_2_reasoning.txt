Question ID: 1063
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to find out how many emails James doesn't respond to daily. Since 20% of the emails don't require any response, we calculate 20% of 80:

80 * 20/100 = 16 emails

So, James doesn't respond to 16 emails daily.

Next, we subtract the number of emails he doesn't respond to from the total number of emails he receives daily to find out how many emails he responds to daily:

80 - 16 = 64 emails

So, James responds to 64 emails daily.

Finally, we multiply the number of emails he responds to daily by the number of days in a work week (5 days) to find out how many emails he responds to in a week:

64 * 5 = 320 emails

So, James responds to 320 emails in a 5 day work week.
