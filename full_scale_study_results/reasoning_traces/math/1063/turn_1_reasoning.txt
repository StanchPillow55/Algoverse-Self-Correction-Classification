Question ID: 1063
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to find out how many emails James doesn't respond to each day. We know that 20% of the 80 emails he gets daily don't require a response. To find this number, we multiply 80 by 20% (or 0.20):

80 emails * 0.20 = 16 emails

So, James doesn't respond to 16 emails each day.

Next, we need to find out how many emails he does respond to each day. We subtract the number of emails he doesn't respond to from the total number of emails he gets:

80 emails - 16 emails = 64 emails

So, James responds to 64 emails each day.

Finally, we need to find out how many emails he responds to in a 5-day work week. We multiply the number of emails he responds to each day by 5:

64 emails/day * 5 days = 320 emails

So, James responds to 320 emails in a 5-day work week.
