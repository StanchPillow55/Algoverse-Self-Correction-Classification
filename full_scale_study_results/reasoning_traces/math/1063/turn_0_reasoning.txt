Question ID: 1063
Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to find out how many emails James gets in a 5 day work week. 

Since James gets 80 emails a day, in a 5 day work week, he would receive 80 emails/day * 5 days/week = 400 emails/week.

Next, we need to find out how many of those emails don't require any response. 

Since 20% of the emails don't require any response, that means 20/100 * 400 emails/week = 80 emails/week don't require any response.

Finally, we need to find out how many emails James responds to in a week. 

Since he responds to all the emails that require a response, and we know that 80 emails don't require a response, that means he responds to 400 emails/week - 80 emails/week = 320 emails/week.

So, James responds to 320 emails in a 5 day work week.
