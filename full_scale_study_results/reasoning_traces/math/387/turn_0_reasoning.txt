Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to calculate the total cost of the erasers. 

Since one eraser costs $2, six erasers would cost 6 * $2 = $12.

Next, we need to calculate the total cost of the pencils. 

Since one pencil costs $3, eight pencils would cost 8 * $3 = $24.

Finally, we add the total cost of the erasers and the pencils to find the total cost of all the items. 

So, $12 (for the erasers) + $24 (for the pencils) = $36.

Therefore, 6 erasers and 8 pencils cost $36.
