Question ID: 387
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of the erasers and the pencils separately, then add those amounts together.

First, let's calculate the cost of the erasers. Each eraser costs $2, and we are buying 6 erasers. So, we multiply the cost of one eraser by the number of erasers:

2 (cost of one eraser) * 6 (number of erasers) = $12

Next, let's calculate the cost of the pencils. Each pencil costs $3, and we are buying 8 pencils. So, we multiply the cost of one pencil by the number of pencils:

3 (cost of one pencil) * 8 (number of pencils) = $24

Finally, we add the cost of the erasers and the pencils together to find the total cost:

12 (cost of erasers) + 24 (cost of pencils) = $36

So, 6 erasers and 8 pencils cost $36.
