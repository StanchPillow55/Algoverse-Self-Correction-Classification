I apologize, but there does not appear to be a math problem in the given passage. The passage discusses the lawyers for George Zimmerman withdrawing as his counsel because they have not been able to contact him. There is no numerical information or math-related question that I can solve. If you have a specific math problem you would like me to work through, please provide it, and I will be happy to show my complete reasoning and work. Otherwise, I cannot provide a solution for this passage.
