Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

Unfortunately, there is no mathematical problem or calculation to solve in the given passage. The passage is a news article about the lawyers for George Zimmerman, the neighborhood watch captain who shot Trayvon Martin, withdrawing as his counsel. There is no mention of a specific mathematical problem or query that needs to be solved.

The only relevant quote in the passage is "They always get away," which was said by an unspecified person during a 911 call. This quote does not contain any numerical information that can be used to solve a math problem.

Without a clear mathematical problem or query to work with, I am unable to provide a step-by-step solution or a final answer. The passage is informative, but does not contain any information that can be used to solve a math problem.
