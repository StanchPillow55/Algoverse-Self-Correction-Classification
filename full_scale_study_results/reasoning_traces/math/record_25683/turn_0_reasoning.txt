==================================================

Unfortunately, there is no math problem or calculation to solve in the given passage. The passage is a news article about the lawyers for George Zimmerman, the neighborhood watch captain who shot Trayvon Martin, withdrawing as his counsel. There is no mathematical information or data provided that would require any calculations or mathematical reasoning.

The only part of the passage that could be considered a "query" is the quote "They always get away," which was stated during a 911 call. However, this is not a math problem, but rather a statement made during an emergency call. There is no numerical information or mathematical operation that needs to be performed.

Without any numerical data or mathematical information provided in the passage, I am unable to solve a math problem or show any mathematical reasoning. The passage is simply a news article discussing a legal situation, and does not contain any mathematical components that would require solving a math problem.
