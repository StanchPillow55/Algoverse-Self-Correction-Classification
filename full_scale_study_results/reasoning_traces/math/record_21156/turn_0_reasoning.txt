To solve this problem, we need to determine the value of the placeholder in the given statement.

Given information:
- The 3D model is an accurate, scientific reconstruction of the Harbor.
- The Harbor was destroyed after a certain event.

The statement suggests that the 3D model will allow many to see and experience a site that was destroyed after a specific event. Based on the context provided in the passage, the event that led to the destruction of the Mulberry Harbor was the Invasion of Normandy during World War II.

Therefore, the placeholder in the statement should be filled with the phrase "the Invasion of Normandy".

The complete statement with the placeholder filled in is:
"The 3D model is an accurate, scientific reconstruction of the Harbor that will allow many to see and experience a site that was destroyed after the Invasion of Normandy."

This statement accurately reflects the information provided in the passage, where the French researchers recreated the Mulberry Harbor as part of the virtual recreation of the Invasion of Normandy, which ultimately led to the destruction of the actual Mulberry Harbor.

Final answer:
