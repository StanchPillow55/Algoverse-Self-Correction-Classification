Question ID: record_21156
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine the value of the placeholder in the given statement.

Given information:
- The 3D model is an accurate, scientific reconstruction of the Mulberry Harbor.
- The Mulberry Harbor was destroyed after a certain event.

The placeholder in the statement refers to the event when the Mulberry Harbor was destroyed.

To find the value of the placeholder, we need to look for information in the passage about the destruction of the Mulberry Harbor.

The passage states:
"The Mulberry Harbor was one of the most extraordinary technological feats of WWII. Developed in part by Major Allan Beckett of the Royal Engineers, it was an artificial harbor built in England, transported across the English Channel and assembled off the coast at Arromanches to unload the vast quantities of supplies and men that were needed for battle."

The passage does not explicitly mention when the Mulberry Harbor was destroyed. However, we can infer that it was destroyed after the Invasion of Normandy, also known as D-Day, which was the event that the 3D model is recreating.

Therefore, the value of the placeholder is:
D-Day
