Step 1: Identify the number of roses in the vase. According to the problem, there are 4 roses in the vase.

Step 2: Determine the number of dahlias in the vase. The problem states that there are 7 more dahlias than roses. Since there are 4 roses, this means there are 4 roses + 7 more dahlias = 11 dahlias.

Step 3: Add the number of roses and dahlias to find the total number of flowers in the vase. So, 4 roses + 11 dahlias = 15 flowers.

Therefore, there are 15 flowers in the vase in total.
