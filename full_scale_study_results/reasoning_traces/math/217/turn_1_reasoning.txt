Question ID: 217
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we know there are 4 roses in the vase.

The problem states that there are 7 more dahlias than roses. So, to find the number of dahlias, we add 7 to the number of roses:

4 roses + 7 = 11 dahlias

To find the total number of flowers in the vase, we add the number of roses and dahlias together:

4 roses + 11 dahlias = 15 flowers

So, there are 15 flowers in the vase in total.
