Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we first need to find the total number of spools of thread that Candy has. We do this by adding together the number of each type of spool:

15 light blue + 45 dark blue + 40 light green + 50 dark green = 150 total spools

Next, we need to find the total number of blue spools, which we do by adding together the number of light blue and dark blue spools:

15 light blue + 45 dark blue = 60 blue spools

Now we can find the percentage of spools that are blue by dividing the number of blue spools by the total number of spools and then multiplying by 100 to convert the decimal to a percentage:

(60 blue / 150 total) * 100 = 40%

So, 40% of Candy's spools of thread are blue.
