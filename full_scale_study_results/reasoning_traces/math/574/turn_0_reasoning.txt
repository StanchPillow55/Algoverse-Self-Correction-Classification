First, let's calculate the cost of making 10 sandwiches.

The cost of bread for 10 sandwiches is $3.00 because each loaf makes 10 sandwiches.

The cost of cheese and condiments for 10 sandwiches is $30.00.

So, the total cost of making 10 sandwiches is $3.00 (bread) + $30.00 (cheese and condiments) = $33.00.

Next, let's calculate the revenue from selling 10 sandwiches.

If each sandwich is sold for $7.00, then the revenue from selling 10 sandwiches is 10 * $7.00 = $70.00.

Finally, let's calculate the net profit.

The net profit is the revenue minus the cost. So, the net profit from selling 10 sandwiches is $70.00 (revenue) - $33.00 (cost) = $37.00.

Therefore, the food truck's net profit from selling 10 sandwiches is $37.00.
