==================================================

First, we need to calculate the discount Mark gets on the radiator. 

The radiator is $400 and he gets 80% off. To find out how much he saves, we multiply the original price by the discount rate:

$400 * 0.80 = $320

So, Mark saves $320 on the radiator. 

To find out how much he actually pays for the radiator, we subtract the discount from the original price:

$400 - $320 = $80

So, Mark pays $80 for the radiator at the junk shop.

Next, we need to calculate the cost of the mechanic's labor. The mechanic charges $50 an hour and works for 3 hours. So, we multiply the hourly rate by the number of hours:

$50/hour * 3 hours = $150

So, the mechanic's labor costs $150.

Finally, we add the cost of the radiator and the cost of the labor to find out how much Mark pays in total:

$80 + $150 = $230

So, Mark pays $230 in total.
