==================================================

Let's solve this problem step by step.

First, we know that Aliya is 3 years old.

Second, we know that Shawna is three times as old as Aliya. So, we multiply Aliya's age by 3 to find out Shawna's age.

3 years * 3 = 9 years

So, Shawna is 9 years old.

Finally, we know that Shawna's father is five times as old as Shawna. So, we multiply Shawna's age by 5 to find out the age of Shawna's father.

9 years * 5 = 45 years

So, Shawna's father is 45 years old.

Therefore, the final answer is that Shawna's father is 45 years old.
