Let's denote the number of orange fish Bob bought at the store as O and the number of white fish as W. 

We know that Bob bought 17 fish in total at the store, so we can write the first equation as:

O + W = 17

We also know that after adding the new fish to his pond, Bob had twice as many orange fish as white fish. Before buying new fish, Bob had 3 orange and 4 white fish. So, after adding the new fish, the number of orange fish (3 + O) is twice the number of white fish (4 + W). We can write the second equation as:

3 + O = 2 * (4 + W)

Let's solve these two equations step by step.

First, simplify the second equation:

3 + O = 8 + 2W
O - 2W = 8 - 3
O - 2W = 5

Now we have a system of two equations:

O + W = 17
O - 2W = 5

We can solve this system by substitution or elimination. Let's use elimination. Subtract the second equation from the first:

O + W - (O - 2W) = 17 - 5
3W = 12

Divide both sides by 3 to solve for W:

W = 12 / 3
W = 4

So, Bob bought 4 white fish at the store.
