Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. In the morning, 50 people entered the restaurant.

2. At around 10:00, 40 more people entered the restaurant. So, the total number of people who had entered the restaurant by 10:00 is 50 (from the morning) + 40 (at 10:00) = 90 people.

3. After a while, twice the number of people who entered the restaurant at 10:00 came in. This means 2 * 40 = 80 people came in. So, the total number of people who had entered the restaurant by this time is 90 (from before) + 80 (now) = 170 people.

4. By evening, an additional 3 times as many people as the number that came in first had entered the restaurant. This means 3 * 50 = 150 people came in. So, the total number of people who had entered the restaurant by the end of the day is 170 (from before) + 150 (now) = 320 people.

So, the total number of people that entered the restaurant on that day is 320.
