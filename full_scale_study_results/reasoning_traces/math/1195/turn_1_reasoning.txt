Question ID: 1195
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to calculate the total number of people who entered the restaurant throughout the day. We will break down the problem step by step:

1. **Morning Entry:**
   - Initially, 50 people entered the restaurant in the morning.

2. **10:00 Entry:**
   - At 10:00, 40 more people entered the restaurant.

3. **Lunch Entry:**
   - After a while, twice the number of people who entered at 10:00 came in for lunch. 
   - Number of people entering for lunch = 2 × 40 = 80 people.

4. **Evening Entry:**
   - By evening, an additional 3 times as many people as the number that came in first had entered the restaurant.
   - Number of people entering in the evening = 3 × 50 = 150 people.

Now, we sum up all the people who entered the restaurant throughout the day:

- Morning: 50 people
- 10:00: 40 people
- Lunch: 80 people
- Evening: 150 people

Total number of people = 50 + 40 + 80 + 150 = 320 people

Therefore, the total number of people that entered the restaurant on that day is **320**.
