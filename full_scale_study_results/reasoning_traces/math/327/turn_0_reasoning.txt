Dataset Type: math
==================================================

Oscar starts with 24 lollipops. 

He eats 2 on his way to school, so we subtract 2 from 24: 
24 - 2 = 22 lollipops.

Then, he gives 14 to his friends, so we subtract 14 from 22: 
22 - 14 = 8 lollipops.

On his way home, he buys twice as many lollipops as he gave to his friends. He gave 14 to his friends, so he buys 14 * 2 = 28 lollipops.

Now, we add the 28 lollipops he bought to the 8 he still had: 
8 + 28 = 36 lollipops.

He eats 3 more that night, so we subtract 3 from 36: 
36 - 3 = 33 lollipops.

Finally, he eats 2 more in the morning, so we subtract 2 from 33: 
33 - 2 = 31 lollipops.

So, Oscar has 31 lollipops left.
