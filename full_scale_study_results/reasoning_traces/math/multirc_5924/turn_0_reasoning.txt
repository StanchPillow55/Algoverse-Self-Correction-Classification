==================================================

To determine the types of stones that Paul's watch was adorned with, I will carefully read through the given paragraph and extract the relevant information.

The paragraph states:
"Topazes ran in a foamy stream
Over the cover, the hands were studded
With garnets, and seemed red roses, budded.
The face was of crystal, and engraved
Upon it the figures flashed and waved
With zircons, and beryls, and amethysts."

From this, we can see that the watch was adorned with the following types of stones:
1. Topazes
2. Garnets
3. Zircons
4. Beryls
5. Amethysts
6. Crystal (for the face)

The paragraph also mentions that "the watch was so light and thin it seemed to catch the sunlight's nothingness, and its gleam," suggesting that the watch was made with a combination of these precious stones and metals.

Therefore, the final answer is:
The types of stones that Paul's watch was adorned with were topazes, garnets, zircons, beryls, amethysts
