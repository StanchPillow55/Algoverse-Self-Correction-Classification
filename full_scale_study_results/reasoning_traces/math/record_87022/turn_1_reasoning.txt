==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to find the total cost of the items Francesca Grillo purchased in one day.

Given information:
- Francesca Grillo's biggest splurge was £700 on a pair of @placeholder glasses, Fendi boots, and a Marc Jacobs scarf.

Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the items purchased.
Total cost = Cost of @placeholder glasses + Cost of Fendi boots + Cost of Marc Jacobs scarf
Total cost = £700

Therefore, Francesca Grillo's biggest splurge was £700 on a pair of @placeholder glasses, Fendi boots, and a Marc Jacobs scarf in one day.
