Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to convert the required height for the ride from feet to inches because Adam's height is given in inches. 

1 foot = 12 inches

So, 4 feet = 4 * 12 = 48 inches

Adam needs to be 48 inches tall to ride the roller coaster. 

Currently, Adam is 40 inches tall. 

So, he needs to grow 48 - 40 = 8 inches to reach the required height. 

Adam grows 2 inches a year. 

So, to grow 8 inches, it will take him 8 / 2 = 4 years. 

Therefore, Adam will have to wait 4 years until he is tall enough to ride the biggest roller coaster at the park.
