To find the total amount of money Terry makes, we need to calculate the total amount he makes from each item and then add those amounts together.

First, let's calculate how much Terry makes from selling milkshakes. He sells 6 milkshakes for $5.50 each, so the total amount he makes from milkshakes is 6 * $5.50 = $33.

Next, let's calculate how much Terry makes from selling burger platters. He sells 9 burger platters for $11 each, so the total amount he makes from burger platters is 9 * $11 = $99.

Finally, let's calculate how much Terry makes from selling sodas. He sells 20 sodas for $1.50 each, so the total amount he makes from sodas is 20 * $1.50 = $30.

Now, let's add up the total amounts from each item to find the total amount of money Terry makes. The total amount is $33 (from milkshakes) + $99 (from burger platters) + $30 (from sodas) = $162.

So, Terry makes a total of $162.
