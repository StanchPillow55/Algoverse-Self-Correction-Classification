Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

The Smith twins each found 30 eggs. Since there are two of them, they found a total of 2 * 30 = <<2*30=60>>60 eggs.

The total number of eggs hidden was 100. If we subtract the number of eggs the Smith twins found, we get 100 - 60 = <<100-60=40>>40 eggs.

The problem states that all the other eggs except 10 were found by their friends. This means that the friends found 40 - 10 = <<40-10=30>>30 eggs.

So, the friends found 30 eggs.
