Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine how many eggs the friends found. Let's break down the information given and work through the problem step by step:

1. **Total Eggs Hidden**: The Easter egg hunt team hid a total of 100 eggs.

2. **Eggs Found by the Smith Twins**: The Smith twins each found 30 eggs. Since there are two twins, the total number of eggs found by the twins is:
   \[
   30 \, (\text{eggs found by one twin}) \times 2 \, (\text{twins}) = 60 \, \text{eggs}
   \]

3. **Eggs Not Found**: We are told that all the other eggs except 10 were found by their friends. This means that 10 eggs were not found by anyone.

4. **Eggs Found by Friends**: To find out how many eggs the friends found, we first need to determine how many eggs were found in total. Since 10 eggs were not found, the total number of eggs found is:
   \[
   100 \, (\text{total eggs}) - 10 \, (\text{eggs not found}) = 90 \, \text{eggs found in total}
   \]

5. **Calculate Eggs Found by Friends**: Now, subtract the number of eggs found by the Smith twins from the total number of eggs found to determine how many eggs the friends found:
   \[
   90 \, (\text{total eggs found}) - 60 \, (\text{eggs found by twins}) = 30 \, \text{eggs found by friends}
   \]

Therefore, the friends found 30 eggs.

**Final Answer**: The friends found 30 eggs.
