Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine how many eggs the friends found during the Easter egg hunt. Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Total Eggs Hidden:**  
   The total number of eggs hidden by the Easter egg hunt team is 100.

2. **Eggs Found by the Smith Twins:**  
   There are two Smith twins, and each found 30 eggs.  
   Therefore, the total number of eggs found by the Smith twins is:  
   \[
   30 \text{ (eggs found by one twin)} + 30 \text{ (eggs found by the other twin)} = 60 \text{ eggs}
   \]

3. **Eggs Not Found by the Friends:**  
   According to the problem, all the other eggs except 10 were found by their friends.  
   This means that 10 eggs were not found by anyone.

4. **Eggs Found by the Friends:**  
   To find the number of eggs found by the friends, we first need to determine how many eggs were found in total.  
   Since 10 eggs were not found, the number of eggs that were found is:  
   \[
   100 \text{ (total eggs)} - 10 \text{ (eggs not found)} = 90 \text{ eggs}
   \]

5. **Calculate Eggs Found by the Friends:**  
   We know that the Smith twins found 60 eggs. Therefore, the number of eggs found by the friends is:  
   \[
   90 \text{ (total eggs found)} - 60 \text{ (eggs found by the Smith twins)} = 30 \text{ eggs}
   \]

Thus, the friends found 30 eggs.

**Final Answer:** The friends found 30 eggs.
