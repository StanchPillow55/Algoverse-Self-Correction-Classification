Question ID: record_9397
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to find the value of the @placeholder in the given query.

Given information:
- Lincoln, Nebraska has the largest concentration of Yazidis in the United States.
- The city is home to about 200 Yazidi families, which is roughly half the nation's Yazidi population.

To find the total Yazidi population in the United States, we can use the information provided:

Step 1: Determine the total number of Yazidi families in Lincoln.
Total Yazidi families in Lincoln = 200 families

Step 2: Determine the total Yazidi population in the United States.
Since the 200 Yazidi families in Lincoln represent roughly half the nation's Yazidi population, we can double the number of families to find the total Yazidi population in the United States.

Total Yazidi population in the United States = 200 families Ã— 2 = 400 families

Therefore, the @placeholder in the given query is the total Yazidi population in the United States, which is 400 families.
