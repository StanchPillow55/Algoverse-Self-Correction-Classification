==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to find the value of the @placeholder in the given query.

Given information:
- Lincoln, Nebraska has the largest concentration of Yazidis in the United States.
- The passage states that "roughly half the nation's @placeholder population — about 200 families — lives" in Lincoln.

To find the value of the @placeholder, we need to determine the total Yazidi population in the United States.

Step 1: Calculate the total Yazidi population in Lincoln.
Total Yazidi population in Lincoln = 200 families

Step 2: Determine the total Yazidi population in the United States.
Since the passage states that the Yazidi population in Lincoln is "roughly half the nation's @placeholder population," we can use this information to find the total Yazidi population in the United States.

Let the total Yazidi population in the United States be x.
Then, the Yazidi population in Lincoln is approximately x/2.

We know that the Yazidi population in Lincoln is about 200 families, so:
x/2 = 200
x = 400 families

Therefore, the total Yaz
