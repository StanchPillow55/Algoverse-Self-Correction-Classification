Question ID: record_9397
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to find the value of the @placeholder in the given query.

Given information:
- Lincoln, Nebraska has the largest concentration of Yazidis in the United States.
- Roughly half the nation's Yazidi population, which is about 200 families, lives in Lincoln.

To find the value of the @placeholder, we need to calculate the total Yazidi population in the United States.

Step 1: Calculate the total Yazidi population in Lincoln.
Total Yazidi population in Lincoln = 200 families

Step 2: Calculate the total Yazidi population in the United States.
Since Lincoln has roughly half the nation's Yazidi population, we can double the Yazidi population in Lincoln to find the total Yazidi population in the United States.
Total Yazidi population in the United States = 2 Ã— 200 families = 400 families

Therefore, the value of the @placeholder is 400 families, which represents the total Yazidi population in the United States.
