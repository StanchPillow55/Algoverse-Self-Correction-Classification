==================================================

To solve this problem, I will need to analyze the given passage and determine the appropriate placeholder to fill in the query.

The passage discusses the evacuation of the town of Minot, North Dakota due to major flooding. It mentions that the mayor and governor congratulated the citizens on an "organized and efficient evacuation" and that the process "had gone extremely well."

The query states that "@placeholder got some support from a hometown hero who was halfway around the world." Based on the information in the passage, the most likely placeholder would be "Minot" or the people of Minot.

The passage mentions that actor Josh Duhamel, who is from Minot, appealed for the public's help. This suggests that Minot, the town facing the flooding, received support from a hometown hero (Josh Duhamel) who was halfway around the world.

Therefore, the final answer to the query is:

Minot got some support from a hometown hero who was halfway around the world.
