Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, I will need to make some inferences based on the given passage. The passage does not directly mention "@placeholder", so I will need to make an educated guess about who or what that refers to.

Given information:
- The passage is about a major flooding event in Minot, North Dakota.
- The mayor and governor congratulated residents on an organized and efficient evacuation.
- There are roughly 12,000 people in the evacuation zone.
- Actor Josh Duhamel, who is from Minot, appealed for the public's help.

Inference:
Based on the information provided, it seems that "@placeholder" is likely referring to the residents of Minot who were evacuated due to the flooding. The passage mentions that the evacuation process went well, and a hometown hero (Josh Duhamel) appealed for help, likely to support the evacuated residents.

Reasoning:
1) The passage states that the mayor and governor congratulated the citizens on the organized and efficient evacuation, indicating that the residents were the ones being evacuated.
2) The passage also mentions that there are roughly 12,000 people in the evacuation zone
