Question ID: 535
Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

Let's denote the number of candies George had initially as G. According to the problem, George ate 5 candies and now has 3 left. This means that initially, George had 5 + 3 = 8 candies.

The problem also states that Nick had twice as many candies as George. So, Nick had 2 * G = 2 * 8 = 16 candies.

Therefore, Nick has 16 candies.
