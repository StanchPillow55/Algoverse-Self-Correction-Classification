Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, let's break down the problem into smaller parts. 

We know that John received $100,000 for the first 5 months of research. This means that his monthly funding for the first 5 months was $100,000 / 5 = $20,000.

The problem states that his research took 10 times longer than the initial 5 months. This means his research took 10 * 5 = 50 months in total.

So, after the first 5 months, he had 50 - 5 = 45 months of research left.

The problem also states that every month after the first 5 took 50% more funding per month. This means that each of these months took $20,000 * 1.5 = $30,000.

So, the cost of the remaining 45 months of research was 45 * $30,000 = $1,350,000.

Adding this to the initial $100,000 for the first 5 months, the total cost of his research was $100,000 + $1,350,000 = $1,450,000.

So, John's research cost $1,450,000.
