Question ID: 611
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, let's break down the problem into two parts: the initial funding for the first 5 months, and the additional funding for the remaining months.

The initial funding is straightforward: John received $100,000 for the first 5 months. 

The problem states that his research took 10 times longer than initially expected. This means it took 10 * 5 = 50 months in total.

Subtracting the initial 5 months, we find that John needed additional funding for 50 - 5 = 45 months.

The problem also states that every month after the first 5 took 50% more funding. This means each of these months took $100,000 / 5 months * 1.5 = $30,000 per month.

So, the total cost for these 45 months is 45 months * $30,000/month = $1,350,000.

Adding this to the initial $100,000, we find that John's research cost $100,000 + $1,350,000 = $1,450,000 in total.
