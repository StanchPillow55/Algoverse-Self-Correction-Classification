==================================================

First, let's figure out how much funding John received per month for the first 5 months. We do this by dividing the total amount of initial funding by the number of months. 

$100,000 / 5 months = $20,000 per month

Next, we need to find out how long the research took in total. We know it took 10 times longer than the initial 5 months, so we multiply 5 months by 10.

5 months * 10 = 50 months

Now, we know that the research took 50 months in total. But we already know the cost for the first 5 months, so we need to find out how many months are left. We do this by subtracting the first 5 months from the total.

50 months - 5 months = 45 months

We also know that every month after the first 5 took 50% more funding. So we need to find out what 50% of the initial monthly funding is. 

$20,000 * 50% = $10,000

So each month after the first 5 cost $20,000 + $10,000 = $30,000.

Finally, we need to find out how much the remaining 45 months cost. We do this by multiplying the number of months by the cost per month.

45 months * $30,000 per month = $1,350,000

So the cost for the remaining 45 months is $1,350,000. 

To find the total cost of the research, we add the cost of the first 5 months to the cost of the remaining 45 months.

$100,000 + $1,350,000 = $1,450,000

So, John's research cost $1,450,000 in total.
