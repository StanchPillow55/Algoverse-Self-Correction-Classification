==================================================

Erin has $6.00 and each scoop of ice cream costs $1.50. 

First, we need to determine how many scoops of ice cream Erin can buy with her $6.00. 

To do this, we divide the total amount of money Erin has by the cost of each scoop of ice cream:

$6.00 รท $1.50 = 4 scoops

So, Erin can buy 4 scoops of ice cream with her $6.00.

However, the ice cream parlor is offering a deal where if you buy 2 scoops of ice cream, you get 1 scoop free. 

Since Erin can buy 4 scoops, she can take advantage of this deal twice. 

For each deal, she buys 2 scoops and gets 1 scoop free. So, for 2 deals, she gets 2 free scoops of ice cream.

Therefore, in total, Erin can get 4 (the scoops she bought) + 2 (the free scoops) = 6 scoops of ice cream.

So, Erin should buy 4 scoops of ice cream to take full advantage of the deal and get a total of 6 scoops of ice cream.
