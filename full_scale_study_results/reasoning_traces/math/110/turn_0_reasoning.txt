==================================================

First, we need to calculate how many fruit roll-ups each person ate. 

The number of roll-ups is calculated by multiplying the width by the length. 

For Beatrice, her roll-ups were 2 wide and 24 long. So, she ate 2 * 24 = 48 roll-ups.

For Marcell, his roll-ups were 3 wide and 14 long. So, he ate 3 * 14 = 42 roll-ups.

Next, we need to calculate the total number of roll-ups they both ate. 

The total number of roll-ups is calculated by adding the number of roll-ups each person ate. 

So, the total number of roll-ups is 48 (from Beatrice) + 42 (from Marcell) = 90 roll-ups.

Finally, we need to calculate the average number of roll-ups they both ate. 

The average is calculated by dividing the total number of roll-ups by the number of people. 

So, the average number of roll-ups is 90 (total roll-ups) / 2 (people) = 45 roll-ups.

Therefore, on average, they each ate 45 fruit roll-ups.
