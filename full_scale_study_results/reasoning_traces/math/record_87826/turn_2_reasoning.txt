Question ID: record_87826
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to find the value of the placeholder in the given query.

Given information:
- The developer, Nguyen Ha Dong, had turned his telephone off after cancelling an interview with a certain entity on Thursday and not finalizing arrangements for one on Friday.

The query states that the entity is represented by the placeholder "@placeholder".

To find the value of the placeholder, we need to analyze the information provided in the passage.

The passage mentions that the developer, Nguyen Ha Dong, had received a "barrage of death threats on Twitter" after removing the Flappy Bird game from the app stores.

Based on this information, it is reasonable to assume that the placeholder represents "Twitter" in the given query.

Therefore, the complete query would be:

"He had turned his telephone off after cancelling an interview with Twitter on Thursday and not finalizing arrangements for one on Friday."

Final answer:
The value of the placeholder "@placeholder" is "Twitter".
