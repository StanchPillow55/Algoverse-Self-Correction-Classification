==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine how much Tom pays for car washes in a year, given that he gets 4 car washes each month and each car wash costs $15.

Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Calculate the monthly cost of car washes:**
   - Tom gets 4 car washes each month.
   - Each car wash costs $15.
   - Therefore, the monthly cost for car washes is calculated by multiplying the number of car washes per month by the cost per car wash:
     \[
     \text{Monthly Cost} = 4 \, \text{car washes/month} \times 15 \, \text{dollars/car wash} = 60 \, \text{dollars/month}
     \]

2. **Calculate the annual cost of car washes:**
   - There are 12 months in a year.
   - To find the annual cost, multiply the monthly cost by the number of months in a year:
     \[
     \text{Annual Cost} = 60 \, \text{dollars/month} \times 12 \, \text{months/year} = 720 \, \text{dollars/year}
     \]

Therefore, Tom pays $720 for car washes in a year.

**Final Answer:**
Tom pays $720 for car washes in a year.
