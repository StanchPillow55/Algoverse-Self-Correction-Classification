==================================================

To solve the problem of determining how much Tom pays for car washes in a year, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the Monthly Cost:**
   - Tom gets 4 car washes each month.
   - Each car wash costs $15.
   - Therefore, the cost for car washes in one month is calculated by multiplying the number of car washes by the cost per car wash:
     \[
     \text{Monthly Cost} = 4 \text{ car washes} \times 15 \text{ dollars/car wash} = 60 \text{ dollars}
     \]

2. **Calculate the Annual Cost:**
   - There are 12 months in a year.
   - To find the total cost for the year, multiply the monthly cost by the number of months in a year:
     \[
     \text{Annual Cost} = 60 \text{ dollars/month} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 720 \text{ dollars}
     \]

Therefore, Tom pays a total of $720 for car washes in a year.

**Final Answer:** Tom pays $720 in a year for car washes.
