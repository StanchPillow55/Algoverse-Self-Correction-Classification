Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, we need to calculate how much Tom spends on car washes each month. Since each car wash costs $15 and he gets 4 car washes a month, we multiply the cost of each car wash by the number of car washes he gets each month.

$15 * 4 = $60

So, Tom spends $60 on car washes each month.

Next, we need to calculate how much he spends in a year. Since there are 12 months in a year, we multiply the amount he spends each month by the number of months in a year.

$60 * 12 = $720

So, Tom spends $720 on car washes in a year.

Therefore, the final answer is $720.
