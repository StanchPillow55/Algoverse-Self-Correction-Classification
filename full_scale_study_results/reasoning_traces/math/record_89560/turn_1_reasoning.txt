==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine what word or phrase should replace the @placeholder in the given statement.

Given information:
- The statement is made by a North Korean official at a press conference.
- The official hopes the event (the International Pro Wrestling Festival) will bring the DPRK (North Korea) closer to something after years of tension.

Based on the context, the most logical word or phrase to replace the @placeholder would be "Japan" or "Japan and the international community".

Reasoning:
1. The passage mentions that "Relations between Japan and North Korea are starting to thaw", indicating that there has been tension between the two countries in the past.
2. The event is organized by a Japanese wrestling star turned politician, Kanji "Antonio" Inoki, suggesting that this event is an attempt to improve relations between North Korea and Japan.
3. The North Korean official's statement at the press conference expresses the hope that the event will bring North Korea closer to something after years of tension, which aligns with the context of improving relations with Japan.

Therefore, the final answer to replace the @placeholder is:

"Japan"

or

"Japan and the international community"
