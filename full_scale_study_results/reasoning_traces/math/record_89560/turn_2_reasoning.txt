Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine what word or phrase should replace the @placeholder in the given statement.

Given information:
- The statement is about a North Korean official hoping that the International Pro Wrestling Festival event will bring the DPRK (Democratic People's Republic of Korea, or North Korea) closer to something after years of tension.

Step 1: Analyze the context of the statement.
The passage mentions that the event is organized by a Japanese wrestling star turned politician, and it also mentions that "relations between Japan and North Korea are starting to thaw." This suggests that the word or phrase that should replace the @placeholder is likely related to Japan.

Step 2: Determine the most appropriate word or phrase to replace the @placeholder.
Based on the context, the most logical word or phrase to replace the @placeholder is "Japan" or "the Japanese."

Therefore, the complete statement with the @placeholder replaced would be:

"At a press conference, one North Korean official said he hopes the event will bring the DPRK closer to Japan after years of tension."
