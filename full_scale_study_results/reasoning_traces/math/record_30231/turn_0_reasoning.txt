==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given information and make reasonable assumptions to determine the impact of Ukraine's decision to reject the EU trade deal.

Given information:
- Ukraine's trade is split more or less equally between Russia and the EU.
- Ukraine rejected the EU trade deal due to concerns about losing trade with Russia.

Assumptions:
1. We will assume that Ukraine's trade with Russia and the EU is approximately 50% each.
2. We will assume that if Ukraine had signed the EU trade deal, it would have resulted in a significant increase in trade with the EU, potentially doubling or tripling the trade volume.
3. We will assume that rejecting the EU trade deal would lead to a significant decrease in trade with the EU, potentially by 50% or more.

Reasoning and Calculations:
1. Let's assume Ukraine's total trade volume is 100 units, with 50 units going to Russia and 50 units going to the EU.
2. If Ukraine had signed the EU trade deal, the trade volume with the EU could have increased to 100 units or more, while the trade with Russia would have remained at 50 units.
3.
