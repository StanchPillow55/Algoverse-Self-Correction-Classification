==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given information and make calculations based on the provided details.

Given information:
- Ukraine's trade is split more or less equally between Russia and the EU.

Step 1: Assume that Ukraine's total trade is 100 units.
Since the trade is split more or less equally between Russia and the EU, we can divide the total trade into two equal parts:
Trade with Russia = 50 units
Trade with the EU = 50 units

Step 2: Analyze the impact of rejecting the EU trade deal.
If Ukraine rejects the EU trade deal, it will lose its trade with the EU, which is 50 units.

Step 3: Determine the impact on Ukraine's overall trade.
Total trade before rejecting the EU deal = 100 units
Total trade after rejecting the EU deal = Trade with Russia (50 units) + Trade with the EU (0 units) = 50 units

Step 4: Calculate the percentage change in Ukraine's total trade.
Percentage change in total trade = (New total trade - Original total trade) / Original total trade Ã— 100
Percentage change in total
