==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to understand the context provided in the passage and then use the given information to calculate the approximate trade split between Russia and the EU for Ukraine.

Given information:
- Ukraine rejected a trade agreement with the EU, opting to appease Russia instead.
- The Ukrainian prime minister stated that the EU could not offer Ukraine any compensation if the country lost trade with Russia.

Reasoning:
1. The passage suggests that Ukraine's trade is split more or less equally between Russia and the EU.
2. If Ukraine rejected the EU trade deal to appease Russia, it implies that Ukraine's trade with Russia is significant and important to its economy.
3. The prime minister's statement about the EU not being able to compensate for lost trade with Russia further supports the idea that Ukraine's trade with Russia is substantial.

Calculation:
Based on the information provided, we can assume that Ukraine's trade is split approximately 50% with Russia and 50% with the EU.

Final answer:
Ukraine's trade is split more or less equally, with approximately 50% of its trade going to Russia and 50% going to the EU.
