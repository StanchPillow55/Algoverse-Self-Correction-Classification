Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, let's find out how many articles Meredith wrote on each day.

On Monday, she wrote 5 articles. 

On Tuesday, she wrote 2/5 times more articles than she did on Monday. This means she wrote 2/5 * 5 = 2 more articles on Tuesday than on Monday. Therefore, she wrote 5 + 2 = <<5+2=7>>7 articles on Tuesday.

On Wednesday, she wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday. This means she wrote 2 * 7 = <<2*7=14>>14 articles on Wednesday.

Now, let's calculate the total number of articles she wrote in the three days. 

She wrote 5 articles on Monday, 7 articles on Tuesday, and 14 articles on Wednesday. This means she wrote a total of 5 + 7 + 14 = <<5+7+14=26>>26 articles in the three days.

Since each article takes an average of 4 hours to research and write, Meredith spent 26 articles * 4 hours/article = <<26*4=104>>104 hours writing articles in the three days.

So, Meredith spent a total of 104 hours writing articles in the three days.
