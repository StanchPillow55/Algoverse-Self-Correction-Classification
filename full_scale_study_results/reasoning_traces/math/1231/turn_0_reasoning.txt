Question ID: 1231
Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

The mean score is calculated by adding up all the scores and then dividing by the number of scores. 

First, let's add up all of Sally's quiz scores:

50 + 80 + 80 + 60 + 40 + 90 + 100 + 70 + 60 = 630

Next, we need to know how many quizzes there were in total. We can see that there are 9 quiz scores.

So, to find the mean, we divide the total score by the number of quizzes:

630 รท 9 = 70

Therefore, Sally's mean quiz score is 70.
