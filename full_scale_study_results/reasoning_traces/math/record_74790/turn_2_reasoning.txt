==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the amount of money awarded to Mary Kortner after she sued Craig Martise for the alleged sadomasochistic sexual relationship with her severely handicapped adult daughter, Kendall.

Given information:
- Mary Kortner was awarded about $638,000 after she sued Craig Martise.
- The lawsuit was filed in 2006 for an alleged abusive sexual relationship that occurred in 2003.
- Kendall, Mary Kortner's daughter, died in 2010 at the age of 39 from an undisclosed illness.

Step 1: Understand the timeline of events.
- The alleged abusive sexual relationship occurred in 2003.
- The lawsuit was filed in 2006.
- The final trial resulted in the jury finding in favor of Mary Kortner on Thursday, which is the latest information provided.
- Kendall, the daughter, died in 2010.

Step 2: Determine the relevance of Kendall's death in 2010.
The passage does not indicate that Kendall's death in 2010 had any direct impact on the lawsuit
