Question ID: 520
Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

First, let's calculate how many skeins of wool Martha needs to knit one set of winter wear for one grandchild.

She needs:
- 2 skeins for a hat
- 4 skeins for a scarf
- 12 skeins for a sweater
- 1 skein for a pair of mittens
- 2 skeins for a pair of socks

So, for one grandchild, she needs 2 + 4 + 12 + 1 + 2 = 21 skeins of wool.

Since she has 3 grandchildren, and they're all the same size, she will need 3 times the amount of wool. 

So, she will need 21 skeins x 3 = 63 skeins of wool.

Therefore, Martha needs to buy 63 skeins of wool to make a hat, scarf, sweater, mittens, and socks for each of her 3 grandchildren.
