Question ID: 520
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we first need to calculate the total number of skeins of wool Martha needs to knit one set of winter wear for one grandchild.

The number of skeins needed for one set of winter wear is:

2 (for a hat) + 4 (for a scarf) + 12 (for a sweater) + 1 (for mittens) + 2 (for socks) = 21 skeins

Since Martha is knitting for 3 grandchildren, we multiply the number of skeins needed for one set by 3:

21 (for one set) * 3 (for three grandchildren) = 63 skeins

So, Martha needs to buy 63 skeins of wool.
