Question ID: record_60984
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, I need to determine who the "her" in the query refers to and provide a concise answer based on the information given in the passage.

The passage mentions two players - Dominika Cibulkova and Agnieszka Radwanska. The query states "it took her a long time to recover from that start", which suggests the "her" refers to Radwanska, as Cibulkova dominated the match.

Therefore, the answer is:

It was like an uppercut to the chin and it took Agnieszka Radwanska a long time to recover from that start.
