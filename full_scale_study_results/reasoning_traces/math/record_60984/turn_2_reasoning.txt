Question ID: record_60984
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, I will need to determine who the "her" in the query refers to, and then provide a reasonable explanation for the statement based on the information given in the passage.

Given information:
- The passage discusses Dominika Cibulkova's victory over Agnieszka Radwanska in the women's semifinals of the Australian Open.
- Cibulkova won the match 6-1 6-2 in an hour and 10 minutes.

The query states "It was like an uppercut to the chin and it took her a long time to recover from that start."

Based on the context, the "her" in the query is most likely referring to Agnieszka Radwanska, Cibulkova's opponent in the match.

Reasoning:
Cibulkova's dominant performance, winning the first set 6-1 and the second set 6-2 in just 70 minutes, can be described as an "uppercut to the chin" for Radwanska. The quick and decisive nature of Cibulkova's victory suggests that Radwanska was caught off
