Turn: 0
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to determine who the "her" in the query refers to and provide the appropriate answer.

Given information:
- The passage discusses the Australian Open semifinal match between Dominika Cibulkova and Agnieszka Radwanska.
- Cibulkova defeated Radwanska 6-1, 6-2 in an hour and 10 minutes.

Based on the context, the "her" in the query refers to Agnieszka Radwanska, as she was the one who was defeated by Cibulkova.

The query states that "it took her a long time to recover from that start." This suggests that Radwanska had a difficult start to the match, which Cibulkova dominated.

Therefore, the appropriate answer to the query is:

It was like an uppercut to the chin and it took Agnieszka Radwanska a long time to recover from that start.
