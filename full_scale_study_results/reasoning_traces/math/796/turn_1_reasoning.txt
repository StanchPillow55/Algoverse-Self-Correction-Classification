==================================================

To solve this problem, we first need to calculate the total number of employees the company has after three months. 

We know that the company hires 20 new employees every month. So, after three months, the company would have hired 20 * 3 = 60 new employees.

Adding these new hires to the initial number of employees, the company now has 200 + 60 = 260 employees.

Next, we need to calculate how much the company pays to its employees per month. We know that each employee is paid a $4000 salary per month. So, the total amount of money the company pays to its employees per month is 260 * $4000 = $1,040,000.

Finally, to find out how much the company pays to its employees after three months, we multiply the monthly total by 3. 

So, the total amount of money the company pays to its employees after three months is $1,040,000 * 3 = $3,120,000.

Therefore, the company pays a total of $3,120,000 to its employees after three months.
