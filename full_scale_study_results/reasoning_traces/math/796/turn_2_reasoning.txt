Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we first need to understand how the number of employees is increasing every month and then calculate the total salary for each month.

Step 1: Calculate the number of employees each month

The company starts with 200 employees and hires 20 new employees each month. So, the number of employees for each month is:

- Month 1: 200 employees
- Month 2: 200 (initial employees) + 20 (new hires) = 220 employees
- Month 3: 220 (employees at the end of Month 2) + 20 (new hires) = 240 employees

Step 2: Calculate the total salary for each month

Each employee is paid a $4000 salary per month. So, the total salary for each month is:

- Month 1: 200 employees * $4000/employee = $800,000
- Month 2: 220 employees * $4000/employee = $880,000
- Month 3: 240 employees * $4000/employee = $960,000

Step 3: Calculate the total amount of money the company pays to its employees after three months

The total amount of money the company pays to its employees after three months is the sum of the total salaries for each month:

- Total = Month 1 + Month 2 + Month 3
- Total = $800,000 + $880,000 + $960,000 = $2,640,000

So, the company pays a total of $2,640,000 to its employees after three months.
