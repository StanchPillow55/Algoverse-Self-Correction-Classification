==================================================

First, let's calculate how many employees the company will have after three months. 

The company hires 20 new employees every month. So, after three months, the company will have hired 20 * 3 = <<20*3=60>>60 new employees.

Adding these new employees to the initial number of employees, the company will have 200 + 60 = <<200+60=260>>260 employees after three months.

Each employee is paid a $4000 salary per month. So, the total amount of money the company pays to its employees in a month is 260 * $4000 = $1,040,000.

Therefore, the total amount of money the company pays to its employees after three months is $1,040,000 * 3 = $3,120,000.

So, the company pays $3,120,000 to its employees after three months.
