Turn: 2
Dataset Type: math
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to understand the concepts of mechanical energy and the different types of energy involved in the motion of objects like a moving arrow or ball.

Given information:
- Mechanical energy is a combination of the energy of motion (kinetic energy) and the energy of position (potential energy).
- A moving ball or arrow has mechanical energy.
- The energy of motion comes from the energy created by position, which is stored energy (potential energy).
- An arrow gains energy from the drawn bow, and as it is released, the bow releases its stored energy and puts the arrow into motion.

Step 1: Identify the type of energy a moving arrow or ball has.
Based on the information provided, a moving arrow or ball has kinetic energy, which is the energy of motion.

Explanation:
- When an object is in motion, it possesses kinetic energy, which is the energy it has due to its motion.
- A moving ball or arrow has kinetic energy because they are in motion and possess the energy of motion.
- The energy of motion comes from the energy created by position (potential energy) that is released and converted into kinetic energy.

Step 2:
