==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to understand the concepts of mechanical energy and the different types of energy involved in the examples provided in the paragraph.

The paragraph states that mechanical energy is a combination of the energy of motion (kinetic energy) and the energy of position (potential energy). It also mentions that a moving ball and a moving arrow are examples of mechanical energy.

Let's analyze the examples provided:

1. Moving ball:
   - A moving ball has energy from motion, which is known as kinetic energy.
   - Kinetic energy is the energy an object possesses due to its motion.

2. Moving arrow:
   - The paragraph states that an arrow can also have the energy of motion, which is also kinetic energy.
   - When an arrow is released from a drawn bow, it gains kinetic energy as it moves through the air.

The paragraph also mentions that the energy of motion comes from the energy created by position, which is potential energy.

Potential energy is the energy an object possesses due to its position or configuration. In the example of the arrow, the potential energy is stored in the drawn bow. As the arrow is released, the bow releases its stored potential energy and converts it
