To solve this problem, we need to understand the concepts of mechanical energy, kinetic energy, and potential energy.

Mechanical energy is the sum of kinetic energy (energy of motion) and potential energy (energy of position or stored energy).

In the given paragraph, the examples of a moving ball and a moving arrow are described as having mechanical energy.

Specifically, the paragraph states that a moving ball and a moving arrow have "energy from motion", which is the definition of kinetic energy.

The paragraph also mentions that the energy of motion comes from the "energy created by position", which is the definition of potential energy.

Therefore, the type of energy that a moving arrow or ball have is kinetic energy.

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. Mechanical energy is a combination of kinetic energy (energy of motion) and potential energy (energy of position or stored energy).
2. The paragraph states that a moving ball and a moving arrow have "energy from motion", which is the definition of kinetic energy.
3. The paragraph also mentions that the energy of motion comes from the "energy created by position", which is the definition of potential energy.
4. Therefore, the type of energy that a moving
