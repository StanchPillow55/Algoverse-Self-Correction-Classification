The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers in which each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, usually starting with 0 and 1. That is, the sequence starts 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, and so on. The mathematical definition of the Fibonacci sequence is:

F(0) = 0, F(1) = 1
F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2) for n > 1

So, to solve this problem, we need to implement a function that calculates the n-th Fibonacci number. There are several ways to implement this, including using a recursive function, an iterative function, or using a mathematical formula. However, the recursive function has an exponential time complexity because it does a lot of repeated work, so it's not efficient for large inputs. The iterative function and the mathematical formula have linear and constant time complexity, respectively, so they are more efficient.

Here, I will use the iterative approach because it's simple and efficient. The idea is to start from the first two Fibonacci numbers, 0 and 1, and then keep adding the last two numbers to get the next one until we reach the n-th number.

Here is the Python function that implements this approach:

```python
def fib(n: int) -> int:
    """Return n-th Fibonacci number."""
    if n <= 0:
        return 0
    elif n == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        a, b = 0, 1
        for _ in range(2, n + 1):
            a, b = b, a + b
        return b
```

This function first checks if the input n is less than or equal to 0, and if so, it returns 0 because the 0-th Fibonacci number is 0. Then it checks if n is 1, and if so, it returns 1 because the 1-st Fibonacci number is 1. Otherwise, it initializes two variables a and b to 0 and 1, respectively, which represent the last two Fibonacci numbers, and then it enters a loop that runs from 2 to n. In each iteration, it updates a and b to be the last two Fibonacci numbers, and then it returns b, which is the n-th Fibonacci number.
