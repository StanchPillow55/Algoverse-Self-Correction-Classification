Reasoning:

Given a string value representing a number, we are to determine the closest integer to the number. If the number is equidistant from two integers, we would round it away from zero. We can obtain a solution for this by performing the following steps:
1. Convert the string to a float
2. Check if the float value is greater than or equal to 0. If it is, we would use the built-in python function `math.ceil()` to round up the float value to the nearest integer. If it is not, we would use the built-in python function `math.floor()` to round down the float value to the nearest integer.

Implementation:

The Python built-in `math` module provides the `ceil()` and `floor()` functions which can be used to round up and down respectively. We would use these functions in our implementation as follows:

```python
import math

def closest_integer(value):
    # convert string to float
    float_value = float(value)
    
    # check if float value is greater than or equal to 0
    if float_value >= 0:
        # round up to nearest integer
        return math.ceil(float_value)
    else:
        # round down to nearest integer
        return math.floor(float_value)
```

This function works by first converting the input string to a float. It then checks if the float is greater than or equal to 0. If it is, it rounds the float up to the nearest integer using `math.ceil()`. If it's not, it rounds the float down to the nearest integer using `math.floor()`. This ensures that the function always rounds away from zero, as required by the problem statement.
