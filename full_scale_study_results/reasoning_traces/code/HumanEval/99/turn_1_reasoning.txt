==================================================

Reasoning:

The problem is asking to return the closest integer to the given number. If the number is equidistant from two integers, we should round it away from zero. 

To solve the problem I will use the following steps
- First, I will convert the given string to a float number
- Then, I will check if the number is positive or negative
- If the number is positive I will use the built-in function `round()` to round the number to the nearest integer. The `round()` function rounds a number to the nearest integer, if the number is equidistant from two integers it rounds it to the nearest even number. But in our case, we need to round it away from zero. So, I will add 0.5 to the number before rounding it. This will ensure that if the number is equidistant from two integers it will be rounded to the higher number.
- If the number is negative I will subtract 0.5 from the number before rounding it. This will ensure that if the number is equidistant from two integers it will be rounded to the lower number.
- Finally, I will return the rounded number.

Now I will implement this in the function.

Implementation: 

```python
def closest_integer(value):
    number = float(value)
    if number > 0:
        return int(round(number + 0.5))
    else:
        return int(round(number - 0.5))
```

This function works as follows:
- It first converts the input string to a float.
- It then checks if the number is positive or negative.
- If the number is positive, it adds 0.5 to the number and rounds it to the nearest integer.
- If the number is negative, it subtracts 0.5 from the number and rounds it to the nearest integer.
- It finally returns the rounded number.
