==================================================

Reasoning:

The problem is asking to return the largest even number in the range [x, y] inclusive. If there is no such number, then the function should return -1.

To solve the problem I will use the following steps
- First, I will check if y is less than x. If it is, then there is no number in the range [x, y] and I will return -1.
- If y is greater than or equal to x, then I will check if y is an even number. If it is, then I will return y because y is the largest number in the range [x, y] and it is even.
- If y is not an even number, then I will subtract 1 from y to make it even and return it. This is because if y is an odd number, then y-1 will be the largest even number in the range [x, y].

Now I will implement this in code.

Implementation:

```python
def choose_num(x, y):
    if y < x:
        return -1
    elif y % 2 == 0:
        return y
    else:
        return y - 1
```

This function works as follows:
- It first checks if y is less than x. If it is, it returns -1.
- If y is not less than x, it checks if y is an even number. If it is, it returns y.
- If y is not an even number, it subtracts 1 from y to make it even and returns the result.
