==================================================

Reasoning:

The problem is asking to return true if a number x is a simple power of n and false in other cases. 

A number x is a simple power of n if there exists an integer m such that n**m equals x. 

To solve the problem I will use the following steps
- First, I will check if n is 1 and x is not 1, if so return False because 1 raised to any power is always 1, so x can't be a simple power of n unless x is also 1.
- Then, I will use a while loop to check if n raised to some power equals x. 
- In each iteration of the loop, I will increase the power by 1 and check if n raised to the current power equals x. 
- If it does, I will return True because x is a simple power of n.
- If n raised to the current power is greater than x, I will return False because x can't be a simple power of n.
- If the loop finishes without finding a power that makes n raised to that power equal to x, I will return False because x is not a simple power of n.

Now I will implement this in code.

Implementation: 

```python
def is_simple_power(x, n):
    if n == 1:
        return x == 1
    power = 0
    while n ** power <= x:
        if n ** power == x:
            return True
        power += 1
    return False
```

This function works by checking if n raised to increasing powers equals x. If it finds a power that makes n raised to that power equal to x, it returns True. If it doesn't find such a power and n raised to the current power is greater than x, it returns False. If n is 1 and x is not 1, it returns False because 1 raised to any power is always 1, so x can't be a simple power of n unless x is also 1.
