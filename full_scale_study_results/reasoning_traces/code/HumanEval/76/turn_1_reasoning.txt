==================================================

The problem is asking to return true if the number x is a simple power of n, and false otherwise. 

A number x is a simple power of n if there exists an integer i such that n to the power of i equals x. 

To solve the problem I will use the following steps
- First, I will handle the edge case where n is 1. In this case, x must also be 1 for it to be a simple power of n. If x is not 1, I will return false.
- If n is not 1, I will start a loop where I will keep multiplying a variable, initially set to n, by n until it is greater than or equal to x. 
- If it is equal to x, I will return true, as this means that x is a simple power of n. 
- If it is greater than x, I will return false, as this means that x is not a simple power of n.

Now I will implement this in code.

```python
def is_simple_power(x, n):
    if n == 1:
        return x == 1
    power = n
    while power < x:
        power *= n
    return power == x
```

This function works by first checking if n is 1. If it is, it returns whether x is also 1. If n is not 1, it enters a loop where it keeps multiplying a variable, initially set to n, by n until it is greater than or equal to x. If it is equal to x, it returns true, as this means that x is a simple power of n. If it is greater than x, it returns false, as this means that x is not a simple power of n.
