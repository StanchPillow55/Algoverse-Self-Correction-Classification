==================================================

To solve the problem of returning sorted unique elements from a list, we need to break down the task into a few clear steps. Let's walk through the thought process and reasoning:

### Problem Analysis

1. **Input**: A list of integers (e.g., `[5, 3, 5, 2, 3, 3, 9, 0, 123]`).
2. **Output**: A list of unique integers sorted in ascending order (e.g., `[0, 2, 3, 5, 9, 123]`).

### Steps to Solve the Problem

1. **Identify Unique Elements**: 
   - We need to filter out duplicates from the list. A set is a perfect data structure for this purpose because it inherently stores only unique elements.

2. **Sort the Unique Elements**:
   - Once we have a set of unique elements, we need to convert it back to a list and sort it in ascending order.

3. **Return the Result**:
   - The final step is to return the sorted list of unique elements.

### Implementation Details

- **Using a Set**: Convert the list to a set to remove duplicates. This is efficient because the average time complexity for adding elements to a set is O(1).
- **Sorting**: Use Python's built-in `sorted()` function to sort the elements. This function returns a new list and has a time complexity of O(n log n), which is efficient for sorting.

### Edge Cases

- **Empty List**: If the input list is empty, the function should return an empty list.
- **Single Element List**: If the list contains only one element, the function should return a list with that single element.
- **Already Unique and Sorted List**: The function should handle this gracefully and return the same list.

### Implementation

Now, let's implement the function based on the above reasoning:

```python
def unique(l: list):
    """Return sorted unique elements in a list
    >>> unique([5, 3, 5, 2, 3, 3, 9, 0, 123])
    [0, 2, 3, 5, 9, 123]
    """
    # Convert the list to a set to remove duplicates
    unique_elements = set(l)
    
    # Sort the unique elements and return as a list
    return sorted(unique_elements)

# Example usage
print(unique([5, 3, 5, 2, 3, 3, 9, 0, 123]))  # Output: [0, 2, 3, 5, 9, 123]
```

### Explanation

- **Line 5**: We convert the input list `l` to a set `unique_elements`, which automatically removes any duplicate values.
- **Line 8**: We use the `sorted()` function to sort the unique elements and return the sorted list.

This solution is efficient and handles all the specified requirements and edge cases.
