Reasoning:

The problem is asking to return a sorted list of unique elements from the given list. 

To solve the problem I will use the following steps
- First, I will convert the list to a set. The set data type in Python does not allow duplicate elements. So, when we convert the list to a set, all the duplicate elements will be removed.
- Then, I will convert the set back to a list. This is because the set data type in Python is unordered, and we need to return a sorted list. The list data type in Python is ordered, so we can sort it.
- Finally, I will sort the list and return it.

Implementation:

Here is the Python function that implements the above approach:

```python
def unique(l: list):
    """Return sorted unique elements in a list
    >>> unique([5, 3, 5, 2, 3, 3, 9, 0, 123])
    [0, 2, 3, 5, 9, 123]
    """
    # Convert the list to a set to remove duplicates
    unique_set = set(l)
    
    # Convert the set back to a list
    unique_list = list(unique_set)
    
    # Sort the list
    unique_list.sort()
    
    return unique_list
```

This function works for any list of hashable elements, not just integers. It has a time complexity of O(n log n) due to the sort operation, where n is the number of elements in the list. The space complexity is O(n), where n is the number of unique elements in the list.
