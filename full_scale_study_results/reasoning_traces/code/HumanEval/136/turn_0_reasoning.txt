==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to iterate through the list and find the largest negative integer and the smallest positive integer. 

Here's a step-by-step approach:

1. Initialize two variables, `largest_negative` and `smallest_positive`, to `None`. These will hold our results.

2. Iterate through the list. For each element:
    - If the element is negative and either `largest_negative` is `None` or the element is larger than `largest_negative`, update `largest_negative` to the element.
    - If the element is positive and either `smallest_positive` is `None` or the element is smaller than `smallest_positive`, update `smallest_positive` to the element.

3. Return a tuple of `largest_negative` and `smallest_positive`.

This approach works because it checks each element in the list exactly once, and updates the results if it finds a larger negative number or a smaller positive number. It handles the case where there are no negative or positive numbers by initializing the results to `None` and only updating them if it finds a suitable number.

Here's the Python code that implements this approach:

```python
def largest_smallest_integers(lst):
    largest_negative = None
    smallest_positive = None

    for num in lst:
        if num < 0 and (largest_negative is None or num > largest_negative):
            largest_negative = num
        elif num > 0 and (smallest_positive is None or num < smallest_positive):
            smallest_positive = num

    return (largest_negative, smallest_positive)
```

This function should work for any list of integers, and it should return the correct results according to the problem statement.
