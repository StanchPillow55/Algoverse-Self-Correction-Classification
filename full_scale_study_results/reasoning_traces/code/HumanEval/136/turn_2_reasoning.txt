==================================================

Reasoning:

The problem is asking to return a tuple of two values, the largest negative integer and the smallest positive integer from a given list. If there are no negative or positive integers, we should return None for the respective value in the tuple.

To solve this problem, I will follow these steps:

1. Initialize two variables, `largest_negative` and `smallest_positive`, to None. These will hold the largest negative and smallest positive integers found in the list, respectively.

2. Iterate over the list. For each integer, if it's negative and either `largest_negative` is None or the integer is larger than `largest_negative`, update `largest_negative` to the integer. If it's positive and either `smallest_positive` is None or the integer is smaller than `smallest_positive`, update `smallest_positive` to the integer.

3. After iterating over the list, return a tuple of `largest_negative` and `smallest_positive`.

Implementation:

Here is the Python function that implements the above approach:

```python
def largest_smallest_integers(lst):
    largest_negative = None
    smallest_positive = None

    for num in lst:
        if num < 0 and (largest_negative is None or num > largest_negative):
            largest_negative = num
        elif num > 0 and (smallest_positive is None or num < smallest_positive):
            smallest_positive = num

    return (largest_negative, smallest_positive)
```

This function works by iterating over the list and updating `largest_negative` and `smallest_positive` as it finds larger negative integers and smaller positive integers. It uses the `None` value to handle the case where there are no negative or positive integers in the list. After the loop, it returns a tuple of the two values.
