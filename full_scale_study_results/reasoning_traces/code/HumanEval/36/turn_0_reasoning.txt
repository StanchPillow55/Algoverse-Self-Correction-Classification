==================================================

The problem is asking to return the number of times the digit 7 appears in integers less than n which are divisible by 11 or 13.

To solve the problem, I will use the following steps:
- Initialize a counter to 0. This will be used to count the number of times the digit 7 appears.
- Iterate through all the numbers from 1 to n-1.
- For each number, check if it is divisible by 11 or 13. If it is, convert the number to a string and count the number of times the digit 7 appears in the string. Add this count to the counter.
- Finally, return the counter.

Here is the Python function that implements the above steps:

```python
def fizz_buzz(n: int) -> int:
    count = 0
    for i in range(1, n):
        if i % 11 == 0 or i % 13 == 0:
            count += str(i).count('7')
    return count
```

This function works by iterating over all the numbers less than n. For each number, it checks if it is divisible by 11 or 13. If it is, it converts the number to a string and counts the number of times the digit 7 appears in the string. This count is then added to the total count. The function finally returns the total count.

This function should solve the problem as stated. It has a time complexity of O(n), as it needs to iterate over all the numbers less than n. The space complexity is O(1), as it only uses a constant amount of space to store the count.
