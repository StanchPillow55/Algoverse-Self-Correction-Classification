Reasoning:

The problem is asking to find the nth element of the fib4 sequence. The fib4 sequence is defined as follows:

- fib4(0) -> 0
- fib4(1) -> 0
- fib4(2) -> 2
- fib4(3) -> 0
- fib4(n) -> fib4(n-1) + fib4(n-2) + fib4(n-3) + fib4(n-4)

The problem specifically asks to not use recursion, which is a common way to solve problems involving Fibonacci-like sequences. Instead, we will use a dynamic programming approach to solve this problem.

Dynamic programming is a method for solving a complex problem by breaking it down into a collection of simpler subproblems, solving each of those subproblems just once, and storing their solutions. If the same subproblem is encountered later, instead of re-computing its solution, one simply looks up the previously computed solution, thereby saving computation time at the expense of a (hopefully) modest expenditure in storage space. 

The approach is as follows:

- We will create a list to store the fib4 values. 
- We will initialize the first four elements of the list as per the problem statement.
- Then, for each subsequent number, we will calculate its fib4 value by adding the previous four fib4 values.
- Finally, we will return the nth element of the list.

This approach ensures that we only calculate each fib4 value once, and we can simply look up the value when we need it. This makes the function very efficient, even for large values of n.

Implementation:

Now, let's implement this approach in Python. 

```python
def fib4(n: int) -> int:
    # Initialize the list with the first four fib4 values
    fib4_values = [0, 0, 2, 0]

    # Calculate the fib4 value for each subsequent number
    for i in range(4, n + 1):
        fib4_values.append(fib4_values[i - 1] + fib4_values[i - 2] + fib4_values[i - 3] + fib4_values[i - 4])

    # Return the nth fib4 value
    return fib4_values[n]
```

This function works by first initializing a list with the first four fib4 values. Then, for each subsequent number, it calculates the fib4 value by adding the previous four fib4 values. Finally, it returns the nth fib4 value.
