To solve this problem, we need to convert an integer to its equivalent Roman numeral. The Roman numeral system is a positional numeral system that uses symbols to represent numbers. The symbols are:

- I: 1
- V: 5
- X: 10
- L: 50
- C: 100
- D: 500
- M: 1000

There are also certain rules in the Roman numeral system:

- Symbols are placed from left to right in order of value, starting with the largest.
- However, in a few specific cases, to avoid four characters being repeated in a row (such as IIII or XXXX), subtractive notation is often used as follows:
  - I placed before V or X indicates one less, so four is IV (one less than five) and nine is IX (one less than ten)
  - X placed before L or C indicates ten less, so forty is XL (ten less than fifty) and ninety is XC (ten less than a hundred)
  - C placed before D or M indicates a hundred less, so four hundred is CD (a hundred less than five hundred) and nine hundred is CM (a hundred less than a thousand)

Given these rules, we can create a list of tuples, where each tuple contains a Roman numeral and its equivalent integer value. We start from the largest value and go down to the smallest. For each tuple, while the given number is greater than or equal to the integer value, we subtract the integer value from the number and add the Roman numeral to the result.

Here is the Python function that implements this approach:

```python
def int_to_mini_roman(number):
    """
    Given a positive integer, obtain its roman numeral equivalent as a string,
    and return it in lowercase.
    Restrictions: 1 <= num <= 1000

    Examples:
    >>> int_to_mini_roman(19) == 'xix'
    >>> int_to_mini_roman(152) == 'clii'
    >>> int_to_mini_roman(426) == 'cdxxvi'
    """
    # Define the list of tuples
    roman_numerals = [(1000, 'm'), (900, 'cm'), (500, 'd'), (400, 'cd'), (100, 'c'), (90, 'xc'),
                      (50, 'l'), (40, 'xl'), (10, 'x'), (9, 'ix'), (5, 'v'), (4, 'iv'), (1, 'i')]

    # Initialize the result
    result = ''

    # Iterate over the list of tuples
    for integer, numeral in roman_numerals:
        # While the number is greater than or equal to the integer value
        while number >= integer:
            # Subtract the integer value from the number
            number -= integer
            # Add the Roman numeral to the result
            result += numeral

    # Return the result
    return result
```

This function works for any positive integer up to 1000. It returns the Roman numeral equivalent of the given number in lowercase.
