To solve this problem, we need to convert an integer to its equivalent Roman numeral. Roman numerals are represented by seven different symbols: I, V, X, L, C, D and M. 

The symbols are defined as follows:

- I: 1
- V: 5
- X: 10
- L: 50
- C: 100
- D: 500
- M: 1000

In addition, Roman numerals are written by combining the letters and adding the values. For example, two is written as 'II' in Roman numeral, just two one's added together. Twelve is written as 'XII', which is simply X + II. The number twenty seven is written as 'XXVII', which is XX + V + II.

Roman numerals are usually written largest to smallest from left to right. However, the numeral for four is not 'IIII'. Instead, the number four is written as 'IV'. Because the one is before the five we subtract it making four. The same principle applies to the number nine, which is written as 'IX'. There are six instances where subtraction is used:

- I can be placed before V (5) and X (10) to make 4 and 9. 
- X can be placed before L (50) and C (100) to make 40 and 90. 
- C can be placed before D (500) and M (1000) to make 400 and 900.

Given these rules, we can create a solution by creating a list of tuples where each tuple contains a Roman numeral and its corresponding integer value. We start from the largest numeral, and work our way down to the smallest. For each numeral, we see how many times it can fit into the remaining amount of the number, append that numeral that many times to our result, and subtract that amount from our number. We repeat this process until the number is reduced to 0.

Here is the Python function that implements this approach:

```python
def int_to_mini_roman(num):
    roman_numerals = [
        (1000, 'm'), (900, 'cm'), (500, 'd'), (400, 'cd'),
        (100, 'c'), (90, 'xc'), (50, 'l'), (40, 'xl'),
        (10, 'x'), (9, 'ix'), (5, 'v'), (4, 'iv'),
        (1, 'i')
    ]
    result = ''
    for value, numeral in roman_numerals:
        count = num // value
        result += numeral * count
        num -= value * count
    return result
```

This function works by iterating over the list of tuples, and for each tuple, it calculates how many times the current Roman numeral fits into the remaining number. It then appends the Roman numeral to the result string that many times, and subtracts the corresponding amount from the number. This process is repeated until the number is reduced to 0. The result string is then returned.
