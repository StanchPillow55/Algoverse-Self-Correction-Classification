Reasoning:

Given a string of words separated by commas or spaces, we are to determine an array of the words. We can obtain a solution for this by performing the following steps:
1. Replace all commas in the string with a space. This is done so that we can split the string into words using a space as the delimiter.
2. Split the string into words using a space as the delimiter.

Implementation:

In Python, we can use the `replace()` function to replace all commas in the string with a space. Then, we can use the `split()` function to split the string into words using a space as the delimiter. Here is the Python function that implements this:

```python
def words_string(s):
    # replace all commas in the string with a space
    s = s.replace(',', ' ')
    
    # split the string into words using a space as the delimiter
    words = s.split()
    
    return words
```

This function first replaces all commas in the string `s` with a space. Then, it splits the string into words using a space as the delimiter. The resulting list of words is returned.
