Question ID: HumanEval/160
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: code
==================================================

Reasoning:

Given two lists, `operator` and `operand`, we are to determine the evaluation of the algebraic expression formed from the two lists. We can obtain a solution for this by performing the following steps:
1. Initialize a variable `result` to hold the first element in the `operand` list
2. Iterate through the `operator` list and for each operator, perform the corresponding operation with the next element in the `operand` list. We would update the `result` variable with the result of the operation performed.
3. Return the `result` variable as the evaluation of the algebraic expression

Implementation:

We would implement this in python as follows: 

```python
def do_algebra(operator, operand):
    # Step 1
    result = operand[0]
    
    # Step 2
    for i in range(len(operator)):
        if operator[i] == '+':
            result += operand[i+1]
        elif operator[i] == '-':
            result -= operand[i+1]
        elif operator[i] == '*':
            result *= operand[i+1]
        elif operator[i] == '//':
            result //= operand[i+1]
        elif operator[i] == '**':
            result **= operand[i+1]
    
    # Step 3
    return result
```

This function works by first setting the `result` to the first operand. Then, for each operator in the `operator` list, it checks what the operator is and performs the corresponding operation with the next operand in the `operand` list. The result of this operation is then stored back into `result`. This process is repeated until all operators have been processed. Finally, the function returns the `result` as the evaluation of the algebraic expression.
