==================================================

Reasoning:

Given two lists, one containing operators and the other containing operands, we are to evaluate the algebraic expression that is formed when we combine the two lists. 

We can obtain a solution for this by performing the following steps:
1. Initialize a variable `result` to hold the value of the first operand in the list of operands.
2. Iterate through the list of operators. For each operator, perform the operation on the current value of `result` and the next operand in the list of operands.
3. Return the final value of `result`.

Implementation:

Now, let's implement this in Python. We'll use the built-in `eval` function to evaluate the algebraic expressions. The `eval` function parses the expression passed to it and executes Python expression(s) which are written as strings. 

Here is the Python function that implements the above approach: 

```python
def do_algebra(operator, operand):
    result = operand[0]
    for i in range(len(operator)):
        result = eval(f"{result} {operator[i]} {operand[i+1]}")
    return result
```

This function works by first setting `result` to the first operand. Then, it iterates through the list of operators. For each operator, it constructs a string representing the algebraic expression to be evaluated (using the current value of `result`, the operator, and the next operand), and uses `eval` to evaluate this expression. The result of this evaluation is then stored back in `result`. Finally, the function returns the final value of `result`.

Note: The use of `eval` can be potentially dangerous as it can execute arbitrary Python code. In this case, it's safe to use because we have control over what's being passed to it (i.e., we know it's always going to be a simple algebraic expression). However, in a real-world application, you should avoid using `eval` if you're dealing with user-supplied input or other data that you don't have complete control over.
