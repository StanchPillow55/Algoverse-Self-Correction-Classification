Reasoning:

The problem is asking to evaluate an algebraic expression that is given in the form of two lists. The first list contains the operators and the second list contains the operands. 

The first step is to combine the two lists into a single string that represents the algebraic expression. This can be done by iterating over the two lists simultaneously and concatenating the current operator and operand together. 

After the string is formed, it can be evaluated using Python's built-in eval function. The eval function takes a string and evaluates it as a Python expression. 

The only tricky part is to make sure that the operators and operands are combined in the correct order. Since the operators are applied from left to right, the first operator should be combined with the first two operands, the second operator with the second and third operands, and so on. 

Here is the step-by-step process:

1. Initialize an empty string to hold the algebraic expression.
2. Iterate over the two lists simultaneously. For each iteration, concatenate the current operand, the current operator, and the next operand to the string.
3. After the loop, there will be one operand left. Append this operand to the string.
4. Use the eval function to evaluate the string and return the result.

Implementation:

Here is the Python function that implements the above approach:

```python
def do_algebra(operator, operand):
    # Initialize the algebraic expression with the first operand
    expression = str(operand[0])
    
    # Iterate over the operator list
    for i in range(len(operator)):
        # Append the current operator and the next operand to the expression
        expression += operator[i] + str(operand[i+1])
    
    # Evaluate the expression and return the result
    return eval(expression)
```

This function works by first converting the first operand to a string and storing it in the expression variable. Then it iterates over the operator list. For each operator, it appends the operator and the next operand to the expression. After the loop, the expression is a string that represents the algebraic expression. The function then uses the eval function to evaluate this string and returns the result.
