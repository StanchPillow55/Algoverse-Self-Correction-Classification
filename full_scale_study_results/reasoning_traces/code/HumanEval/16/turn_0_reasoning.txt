Reasoning:

The problem is asking to return the number of distinct characters in a given string. We need to ignore the case of the characters, meaning 'a' and 'A' should be considered as the same character.

To solve this problem, we can use the built-in Python data structure called a set. A set is an unordered collection of unique elements. We can convert our string to a set, which will automatically remove any duplicate characters. Before we do this, we need to convert the string to lower case to ensure that characters are not considered distinct based on case.

Once we have our set, we can simply return its length, which will be the number of distinct characters in the string.

Here is the Python function that implements this approach:

Implementation:

```python
def count_distinct_characters(string: str) -> int:
    # Convert the string to lower case
    string = string.lower()
    
    # Convert the string to a set
    distinct_characters = set(string)
    
    # Return the length of the set
    return len(distinct_characters)
```

This function works by first converting the input string to lower case. This ensures that characters are not considered distinct based on case. The lower case string is then converted to a set, which automatically removes any duplicate characters. Finally, the function returns the length of the set, which is the number of distinct characters in the string.
