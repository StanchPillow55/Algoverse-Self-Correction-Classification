Reasoning:

The problem is asking to rescale a list of numbers such that the smallest number becomes 0 and the largest number becomes 1. All other numbers should be scaled proportionally. This is a common operation in data normalization, where we want to adjust the values measured on different scales to a notionally common scale.

To solve this problem, we can use the following steps:

1. Find the minimum and maximum values in the list. We can use Python's built-in min() and max() functions for this.

2. Subtract the minimum value from each number in the list. This will make the smallest number 0.

3. Divide each number in the list by the range of the original list (i.e., max - min). This will make the largest number 1, and all other numbers will be a proportion of the maximum.

4. Return the rescaled list.

Implementation:

Here is the Python function that implements the above steps:

```python
from typing import List

def rescale_to_unit(numbers: List[float]) -> List[float]:
    min_val = min(numbers)
    max_val = max(numbers)
    range_val = max_val - min_val
    rescaled = [(num - min_val) / range_val for num in numbers]
    return rescaled
```

This function uses a list comprehension to create the rescaled list. The expression `(num - min_val) / range_val` performs the rescaling for each number in the list.

This function assumes that the input list has at least two elements and that not all numbers in the list are the same (which would make the range 0 and cause a division by zero error). If these assumptions may not hold, additional error checking should be added.
