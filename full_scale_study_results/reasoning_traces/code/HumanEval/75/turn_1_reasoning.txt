Reasoning:

Given a number `a`, we are to determine if the number `a` is a product of three prime numbers. We can obtain a solution for this by performing the following steps:

1. First, we would generate all prime numbers less than `a`. We can do this by iterating from 2 through `a` and checking if each number is a prime number. A number is prime if it has no divisors other than 1 and itself.

2. Next, we would iterate through all combinations of three numbers from the list of prime numbers we generated in step 1. For each combination, we would check if the product of the three numbers is equal to `a`. If we find a combination that satisfies this condition, we return `True`.

3. If no combination of three prime numbers multiplies to `a`, we return `False`.

Implementation:

Now we would implement the steps described above in python. We would define a helper function `is_prime` to check if a number is prime. Then in the main function `is_multiply_prime`, we would generate the prime numbers and check for the combinations that multiply to `a`.

Here is the python function that implements the above steps: 

```python
import itertools

def is_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n**0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

def is_multiply_prime(a):
    primes = [i for i in range(2, a) if is_prime(i)]
    for combination in itertools.combinations(primes, 3):
        if combination[0] * combination[1] * combination[2] == a:
            return True
    return False
```

This function works by first generating all prime numbers less than `a` using a list comprehension. It then uses the `itertools.combinations` function to generate all combinations of three numbers from the list of primes. For each combination, it checks if the product of the three numbers is equal to `a`. If it finds a combination that satisfies this condition, it returns `True`. If it doesn't find any such combination, it returns `False`.
