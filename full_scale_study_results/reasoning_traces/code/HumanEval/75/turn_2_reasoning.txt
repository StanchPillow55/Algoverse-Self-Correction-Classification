==================================================

First, let's understand the problem. We need to check if a given number is a product of exactly three prime numbers. A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. The first few prime numbers are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, and 13.

Since the input number is less than 100, the possible prime numbers that can multiply to give this number are from 2 to 7 (2*3*7 = 42 < 100, 2*3*11 = 66 > 100). So we only need to check the combinations of 2, 3, 5, and 7.

Here is the approach to solve this problem:

1. Create a list of prime numbers less than 10, which are 2, 3, 5, and 7.
2. Use three nested loops to iterate through each combination of these prime numbers.
3. In each iteration, check if the product of the three prime numbers equals the input number.
4. If it does, return True. If no combination matches the input number, return False.

Now, let's implement this in Python. 

```python
def is_multiply_prime(a):
    primes = [2, 3, 5, 7]
    for i in primes:
        for j in primes:
            for k in primes:
                if i * j * k == a:
                    return True
    return False
```

This function works by iterating through each possible combination of three prime numbers and checking if their product equals the input number. If it does, the function immediately returns True. If no combination matches the input number, the function returns False.
