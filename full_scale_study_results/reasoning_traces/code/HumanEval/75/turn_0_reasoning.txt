==================================================

First, we need to understand the problem. We are given a number and we need to check if this number is a product of exactly three prime numbers. A prime number is a number that has exactly two distinct positive divisors: 1 and itself. 

To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:

1. First, we need to generate all prime numbers less than the given number. We can do this by creating a helper function that checks if a number is prime or not. We iterate from 2 to the given number and for each number, we check if it's prime or not. If it's prime, we add it to our list of primes.

2. After generating all prime numbers, we need to check if the given number is a product of exactly three prime numbers. We can do this by iterating over our list of prime numbers. For each prime number, we divide the given number by this prime number and check if the result is also a product of two prime numbers. If it is, we return True. If we finish our iteration and we didn't find any three prime numbers that their product equals the given number, we return False.

Now, let's implement this solution in Python.

```python
def is_multiply_prime(a):
    def is_prime(n):
        if n < 2:
            return False
        for i in range(2, int(n**0.5) + 1):
            if n % i == 0:
                return False
        return True

    primes = [i for i in range(2, a) if is_prime(i)]

    for p in primes:
        if a % p == 0:
            temp = a // p
            count = 0
            for p in primes:
                if temp % p == 0:
                    temp //= p
                    count += 1
                    if count > 2:
                        break
            if count == 2 and temp == 1:
                return True
    return False
```

This function works by first generating all prime numbers less than the given number. Then, for each prime number, it checks if the given number divided by this prime number results in a number that is a product of exactly two prime numbers. If it finds such three prime numbers, it returns True. Otherwise, it returns False.
