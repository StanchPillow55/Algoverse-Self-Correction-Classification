Dataset Type: code
==================================================

Reasoning:

Given a file name, we are to determine if the file name is valid. A file name is valid if it satisfies the following conditions:

- There should not be more than three digits ('0'-'9') in the file's name.
- The file's name contains exactly one dot '.'
- The substring before the dot should not be empty, and it starts with a letter from the latin alphapet ('a'-'z' and 'A'-'Z').
- The substring after the dot should be one of these: ['txt', 'exe', 'dll']

We can obtain a solution for this by performing the following steps:
1. Check if the file name contains exactly one dot '.'
2. If it does, split the file name into two substrings using the dot as the delimiter.
3. Check if the substring before the dot is not empty and starts with a letter from the latin alphabet.
4. Check if the substring after the dot is one of these: ['txt', 'exe', 'dll']
5. Check if the file name contains not more than three digits.
6. If all these conditions are met, return 'Yes'. Otherwise, return 'No'.

Implementation:

Now we can implement this plan in code. We'll use Python's built-in functions and string methods to perform the necessary checks. 

Here is the Python function that implements the above plan: 

```python
def file_name_check(file_name):
    # Check if the file name contains exactly one dot
    if file_name.count('.') != 1:
        return 'No'
    
    # Split the file name into two substrings using the dot as the delimiter
    name, extension = file_name.split('.')
    
    # Check if the substring before the dot is not empty and starts with a letter from the latin alphabet
    if not name or not name[0].isalpha():
        return 'No'
    
    # Check if the substring after the dot is one of these: ['txt', 'exe', 'dll']
    if extension not in ['txt', 'exe', 'dll']:
        return 'No'
    
    # Check if the file name contains not more than three digits
    if sum(c.isdigit() for c in file_name) > 3:
        return 'No'
    
    # If all these conditions are met, return 'Yes'
    return 'Yes'
```

This function should solve the problem as expected. It checks all the required conditions for a valid file name and returns 'Yes' or 'No' accordingly.
