==================================================

Reasoning:

Given a file name, we are to determine if the file name is valid. A file name is valid if it satisfies the following conditions:

- There should not be more than three digits ('0'-'9') in the file's name.
- The file's name contains exactly one dot '.'
- The substring before the dot should not be empty, and it starts with a letter from the latin alphapet ('a'-'z' and 'A'-'Z').
- The substring after the dot should be one of these: ['txt', 'exe', 'dll']

We can obtain a solution for the problem prompt by performing the following steps:

1. Check if the file name contains exactly one dot '.'
2. Split the file name into two parts using the dot as the delimiter. The first part of the split result should be the name of the file and the second part should be the file extension.
3. Check if the file name starts with a letter from the latin alphapet ('a'-'z' and 'A'-'Z') and if the file extension is one of these: ['txt', 'exe', 'dll']
4. Check if the file name contains more than three digits ('0'-'9')

If all these conditions are met, we would output 'Yes' else we would output 'No'

Approach:

- Check if the file name contains exactly one dot '.'
- Split the file name into two parts using the dot as the delimiter. The first part of the split result should be the name of the file and the second part should be the file extension.
- Check if the file name starts with a letter from the latin alphapet ('a'-'z' and 'A'-'Z') and if the file extension is one of these: ['txt', 'exe', 'dll']
- Check if the file name contains more than three digits ('0'-'9')
- If all these conditions are met, return 'Yes' else return 'No'

Implementation:

Now, let's implement the solution in Python. 

We'll use the built-in Python functions `split()`, `isdigit()`, `isalpha()`, and `count()` to perform the necessary checks. 

The `split()` function is used to split the file name into two parts using the dot as the delimiter. 

The `isdigit()` function is used to check if a character is a digit. 

The `isalpha()` function is used to check if a character is a letter. 

The `count()` function is used to count the number of occurrences of a character in a string. 

We'll also use a for loop to iterate through each character in the file name to count the number of digits. 

Finally, we'll use conditional statements to check if all the conditions are met and return the appropriate result. 

Here is the Python code that implements this solution:
