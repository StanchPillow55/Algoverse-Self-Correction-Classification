==================================================

To solve this problem, we can break it down into the following steps:

1. Check if the file name contains exactly one dot. If not, return 'No'.
2. Split the file name into two parts using the dot as a separator. The first part is the name of the file and the second part is the extension.
3. Check if the file name starts with a letter from the latin alphabet. If not, return 'No'.
4. Check if the file name contains more than three digits. If yes, return 'No'.
5. Check if the file extension is one of 'txt', 'exe', 'dll'. If not, return 'No'.
6. If all the above conditions are met, return 'Yes'.

Now, let's implement this in Python:

```python
def file_name_check(file_name):
    # Step 1: Check if the file name contains exactly one dot
    if file_name.count('.') != 1:
        return 'No'
    
    # Step 2: Split the file name into two parts
    name, extension = file_name.split('.')
    
    # Step 3: Check if the file name starts with a letter from the latin alphabet
    if not name[0].isalpha():
        return 'No'
    
    # Step 4: Check if the file name contains more than three digits
    if sum(c.isdigit() for c in name) > 3:
        return 'No'
    
    # Step 5: Check if the file extension is one of 'txt', 'exe', 'dll'
    if extension not in ['txt', 'exe', 'dll']:
        return 'No'
    
    # Step 6: If all the above conditions are met, return 'Yes'
    return 'Yes'
```

This function should work as expected for the given problem. It first checks if the file name is in the correct format, then checks the specific conditions for the name and extension. If any of these conditions are not met, it immediately returns 'No'. If all conditions are met, it returns 'Yes'.
