==================================================

First, let's understand the problem. We are given a number n and we are supposed to find the largest prime factor of n. A prime number is a number that has only two distinct positive divisors: 1 and itself. The factors of a number are the numbers that divide it exactly. 

The approach to solve this problem could be as follows:

1. We start by initializing a variable max_prime to -1. This variable will keep track of the largest prime factor we have found so far.

2. We divide the given number n by 2 as many times as possible. This is because 2 is the smallest prime number and we want to remove all factors of 2 from n. Each time we successfully divide n by 2, we update max_prime to 2.

3. After we have removed all factors of 2 from n, we start trying to divide n by odd numbers starting from 3. We increment the divisor by 2 each time because the divisor can't be an even number (we have already removed all factors of 2 from n). Each time we successfully divide n by an odd number, we update max_prime to that odd number.

4. We continue this process until the divisor squared is greater than n. If n is still greater than 1 at this point, then n is a prime number and it is the largest prime factor of itself. So we update max_prime to n.

5. Finally, we return max_prime as the largest prime factor of n.

Now let's implement this approach in Python:

```python
def largest_prime_factor(n: int) -> int:
    max_prime = -1

    while n % 2 == 0:
        max_prime = 2
        n //= 2

    divisor = 3
    while divisor * divisor <= n:
        while n % divisor == 0:
            max_prime = divisor
            n //= divisor
        divisor += 2

    if n > 1:
        max_prime = n

    return max_prime
```

This function works by repeatedly dividing n by its smallest prime factor until n becomes 1 or a prime number. The largest prime factor of n is the last prime number that n was divided by. This approach is efficient because it avoids unnecessary divisions by composite numbers.
