Reasoning:

To solve this problem, we need to find the largest prime factor of a given number. We can do this by dividing the number by 2 until it's no longer divisible, then by 3, then by 5, and so on, until we reach the square root of the number. This is because a larger factor of the number must be a multiple of a smaller factor that has already been checked.

The reason we only need to check up to the square root of the number is because a larger factor would be a multiple of a smaller factor that has already been checked. For example, if we're checking the number 100, we don't need to check any factors larger than 10, because they would necessarily be a multiple of a smaller factor. For example, 20 is a factor of 100, but it's also a multiple of 5, which is a smaller factor.

We can implement this in Python by using a while loop to divide the number by 2 until it's no longer divisible, then incrementing the divisor and repeating the process until we reach the square root of the number. The largest prime factor will be the last number that the input number was divisible by.

Implementation:

Here is the Python function that implements the above approach:

```python
def largest_prime_factor(n: int):
    # Start by dividing n by 2 until it's no longer divisible
    divisor = 2
    while n % divisor == 0:
        n //= divisor

    # Then increment the divisor and repeat the process
    divisor = 3
    while divisor * divisor <= n:
        if n % divisor:
            divisor += 2
        else:
            n //= divisor

    return n
```

This function works by repeatedly dividing the input number by the smallest possible prime factors until it's no longer divisible. The largest prime factor is the last number that the input number was divisible by. This approach ensures that the function will always return the largest prime factor of the input number.
