The median of a list of numbers is the middle number when the list is sorted in ascending order. If the list has an even number of elements, the median is the average of the two middle numbers.

Here is the step-by-step approach to solve this problem:

1. First, we need to sort the list in ascending order. Python's built-in `sort()` function can be used for this purpose.

2. Next, we need to find the middle element. If the length of the list is odd, the middle element is at the index `len(l) // 2`. If the length of the list is even, we need to take the average of the elements at indices `(len(l) // 2) - 1` and `len(l) // 2`.

3. Finally, we return the median.

Here is the Python code that implements this approach:

```python
def median(l: list):
    l.sort()
    n = len(l)
    if n % 2 == 1:
        return l[n // 2]
    else:
        return (l[n // 2 - 1] + l[n // 2]) / 2
```

This function first sorts the list `l`. It then checks if the length of the list `n` is odd. If it is, it returns the middle element. If `n` is even, it returns the average of the two middle elements.

This function should work for any list of numbers, as long as the list is not empty. If the list is empty, the function will raise an `IndexError`. To handle this case, we could add a check at the beginning of the function to return `None` if the list is empty. However, since the problem statement does not specify what to do in this case, I have left this check out of the function.
