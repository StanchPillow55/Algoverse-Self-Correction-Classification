==================================================

The problem is asking to return a list of tuples where each tuple represents the coordinates (row, column) of the occurrences of a given integer in a 2D list. The tuples should be sorted by row in ascending order and by column in descending order.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning and approach to solve this problem:

1. Initialize an empty list to store the coordinates of the occurrences of the given integer.

2. Iterate over the 2D list using enumerate to get both the index and the value of each element. The index will represent the row number.

3. For each row, iterate over it again using enumerate to get both the index and the value of each element. The index will represent the column number.

4. If the current element is equal to the given integer, add a tuple with the coordinates (row, column) to the list.

5. After iterating over the entire 2D list, sort the list of tuples by the first element of each tuple (the row) in ascending order and by the second element of each tuple (the column) in descending order.

6. Return the sorted list of tuples.

Here is the Python function that implements this approach:

```python
def get_row(lst, x):
    coordinates = []
    for i, row in enumerate(lst):
        for j, value in enumerate(row):
            if value == x:
                coordinates.append((i, j))
    coordinates.sort(key=lambda coord: (coord[0], -coord[1]))
    return coordinates
```

This function works by first creating a list of all coordinates where the given integer is found. It then sorts this list by row in ascending order and by column in descending order using a custom sort key. The sort key is a function that takes a coordinate and returns a tuple where the first element is the row and the second element is the negated column. This ensures that the coordinates are sorted in the desired order.
