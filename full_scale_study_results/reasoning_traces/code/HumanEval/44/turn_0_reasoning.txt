The problem is asking to convert a decimal number to a different base. The base can be any number less than 10.

To solve this problem, we can use the division-remainder method. This method involves dividing the number by the base and keeping track of the remainder. The quotient is then divided by the base again, and the remainder is recorded. This process is repeated until the quotient is zero. The base-b number is then the recorded remainders, in reverse order.

Here is the step by step process:

1. Divide the number by the base and record the remainder.
2. Replace the number with the quotient.
3. Repeat steps 1 and 2 until the number is 0.
4. The base-b number is the recorded remainders, in reverse order.

Let's implement this in Python.

```python
def change_base(x: int, base: int) -> str:
    if x == 0:
        return '0'
    digits = []
    while x:
        digits.append(str(x % base))
        x //= base
    digits.reverse()
    return ''.join(digits)
```

This function works by repeatedly dividing the input number by the base and appending the remainder to a list. The list is then reversed to get the digits in the correct order, and joined into a string to get the final result.

For example, if we call `change_base(8, 2)`, the function will divide 8 by 2 to get a quotient of 4 and a remainder of 0. It will then divide 4 by 2 to get a quotient of 2 and a remainder of 0. Finally, it will divide 2 by 2 to get a quotient of 1 and a remainder of 0, and 1 by 2 to get a quotient of 0 and a remainder of 1. The remainders, in reverse order, give the binary representation of 8: '1000'.
