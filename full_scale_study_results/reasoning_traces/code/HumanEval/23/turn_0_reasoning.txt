==================================================

Reasoning:

The problem is asking to return the length of a given string. In Python, there is a built-in function called len() which can be used to get the length of a string. This function counts the number of characters in a string and returns that count as an integer.

Approach:

1. Use the len() function to get the length of the string.
2. Return the length.

Implementation:

Here is the Python function that implements the above approach.

```python
def strlen(string: str) -> int:
    """ Return length of given string
    >>> strlen('')
    0
    >>> strlen('abc')
    3
    """
    return len(string)
```

This function takes a string as input and returns its length. The len() function is used to get the length of the string. The length is then returned by the function. This function will work for any string, including an empty string. If the string is empty, the len() function will return 0, as there are no characters in the string.
