The problem is asking to implement a function that finds a root (zero) of a polynomial. The polynomial is defined by a list of coefficients, and the function should return a single root, even if there are multiple roots. The function should only take lists with an even number of coefficients and the largest non-zero coefficient, as it guarantees a solution.

The problem also provides a function `poly` that evaluates a polynomial at a given point.

To solve this problem, we can use the bisection method, which is a root-finding method that applies to any continuous function for which one knows two values with opposite signs. The method consists of repeatedly bisecting the interval defined by these values and then selecting the subinterval in which the function changes sign, and therefore must contain a root.

Here are the steps of the bisection method:

1. Choose a starting interval [a, b] such that f(a) and f(b) have opposite signs. In our case, we can choose [-100, 100] as the starting interval, because the problem guarantees a solution.

2. Compute the midpoint c = (a + b)/2.

3. If f(c) is very close to zero (less than a small tolerance), then c is a root of the function and we can return c.

4. Otherwise, f(c) is not close to zero. If f(a) and f(c) have opposite signs, then the root must be between a and c. So we set b = c and repeat the process.

5. If f(b) and f(c) have opposite signs, then the root must be between b and c. So we set a = c and repeat the process.

Here is the Python code that implements the above steps:

```python
def find_zero(xs: list):
    a, b = -100, 100
    while True:
        c = (a + b) / 2
        if abs(poly(xs, c)) < 1e-6:
            return c
        if poly(xs, a) * poly(xs, c) < 0:
            b = c
        else:
            a = c
```

This function uses a while loop to repeatedly bisect the interval [a, b] until it finds a root of the polynomial. The function `poly` is used to evaluate the polynomial at points a, b, and c. The tolerance for deciding whether c is a root of the polynomial is set to 1e-6, which means that the function will stop when it finds a value of c such that the absolute value of poly(xs, c) is less than 1e-6.
