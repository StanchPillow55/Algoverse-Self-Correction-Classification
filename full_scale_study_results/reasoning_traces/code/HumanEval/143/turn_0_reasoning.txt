Reasoning:

Given a sentence, we are to determine which words in the sentence have lengths that are prime numbers. We can obtain a solution for this by performing the following steps:
- First, we would create a helper function `is_prime` that would check if a number is prime. A number is prime if it is greater than 1 and has no other factors other than 1 and itself. We would iterate from 2 through the square root of the number and check if the number is divisible by any number in this range. If it is, then the number is not prime, else it is prime.
- Next, we would split the sentence into a list of words. We would iterate through all the words in the sentence and check if the length of the word is a prime number using the `is_prime` helper function. If it is, we would add it to our result list.
- Finally, we would join all the words in the result list with a space and return the result.

Let's implement this now.

Implementation:

```python
import math

def words_in_sentence(sentence):
    def is_prime(n):
        if n < 2:
            return False
        for i in range(2, math.isqrt(n) + 1):
            if n % i == 0:
                return False
        return True

    words = sentence.split()
    result = [word for word in words if is_prime(len(word))]
    return ' '.join(result)
```

This function works as follows:
- The `is_prime` function checks if a number is prime.
- The `words_in_sentence` function splits the sentence into words, checks if the length of each word is a prime number, and if it is, adds it to the result list.
- Finally, it joins all the words in the result list with a space and returns the result.
