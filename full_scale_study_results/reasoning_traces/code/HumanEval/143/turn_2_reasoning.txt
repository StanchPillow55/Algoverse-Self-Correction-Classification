Dataset Type: code
==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Split the sentence into words.
2. Check the length of each word.
3. Check if the length of the word is a prime number.
4. If it is, add it to the result string.
5. Return the result string.

To check if a number is prime, we can use the following approach:

1. If the number is less than 2, it is not prime.
2. If the number is 2, it is prime.
3. For numbers greater than 2, we check if it can be divided evenly by any number from 2 to the square root of the number. If it can, it is not prime. If it can't, it is prime.

Now, let's implement this in Python:

```python
def words_in_sentence(sentence):
    def is_prime(n):
        if n < 2:
            return False
        if n == 2:
            return True
        for i in range(2, int(n**0.5) + 1):
            if n % i == 0:
                return False
        return True

    words = sentence.split()
    result = [word for word in words if is_prime(len(word))]
    return ' '.join(result)
```

This function first defines a helper function `is_prime` to check if a number is prime. It then splits the sentence into words and uses a list comprehension to create a list of words whose lengths are prime numbers. Finally, it joins the words in the list into a string with spaces in between and returns this string.
