==================================================

Reasoning:

Given a sentence, we are to determine which words in the sentence have lengths that are prime numbers. We can obtain a solution for this by performing the following steps:
1. Initialize a helper function `is_prime` that would check if a number is prime or not.
2. Split the sentence into a list of words.
3. Iterate through all the words in the list and check if the length of the word is a prime number. If it is, we add it to our result list.
4. Join all the words in the result list into a string separated by a space and return it.

Implementation:

Let's implement this step by step.

First, we need to implement a helper function `is_prime` that checks if a number is prime or not. A number is prime if it is greater than 1 and has no divisors other than 1 and itself. We can check this by iterating from 2 to the square root of the number (since a larger factor of the number would be a multiple of smaller factor that has already been checked) and checking if the number is divisible by any of these values.

Next, we split the sentence into a list of words using the `split` function.

Then, we iterate through all the words in the list and check if the length of the word is a prime number using the `is_prime` function. If it is, we add it to our result list.

Finally, we join all the words in the result list into a string separated by a space using the `join` function and return it.

Here is the Python code that implements this:

```python
def words_in_sentence(sentence):
    def is_prime(n):
        if n < 2:
            return False
        for i in range(2, int(n**0.5) + 1):
            if n % i == 0:
                return False
        return True

    words = sentence.split()
    result = [word for word in words if is_prime(len(word))]
    return ' '.join(result)
```

This function works as follows:
- The `is_prime` function checks if a number is prime.
- The `split` function splits the sentence into a list of words.
- The list comprehension `[word for word in words if is_prime(len(word))]` generates a new list that contains only the words whose lengths are prime numbers.
- The `join` function joins all the words in the result list into a string separated by a space.
- The function returns this string.
