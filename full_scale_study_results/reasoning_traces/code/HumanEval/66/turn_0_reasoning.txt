Dataset Type: code
==================================================

Reasoning:

The problem is asking to return the sum of the ASCII values of the uppercase characters in the given string. 

ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange) is a character encoding standard used to represent characters on electronic devices. Each character is assigned a unique integer value. For example, the ASCII value of 'A' is 65 and 'B' is 66.

To solve the problem I will use the following steps
- Initialize a variable to hold the sum of the ASCII values of the uppercase characters.
- Iterate through the given string.
- For each character, check if it is an uppercase letter. In Python, we can use the isupper() method to check if a character is uppercase.
- If the character is uppercase, add its ASCII value to the sum. We can get the ASCII value of a character in Python using the ord() function.
- Finally, return the sum.

Now let's implement this in code.

Implementation: 

def digitSum(s):
    # Initialize sum to 0
    sum = 0
    
    # Iterate through the string
    for char in s:
        # Check if character is uppercase
        if char.isupper():
            # Add ASCII value to sum
            sum += ord(char)
    
    # Return sum
    return sum

# Test the function
print(digitSum("")) # Expected output 0
print(digitSum("abAB")) # Expected output 131
print(digitSum("abcCd")) # Expected output 67
print(digitSum("helloE")) # Expected output 69
print(digitSum("woArBld")) # Expected output 131
print(digitSum("aAaaaXa")) # Expected output 153
