==================================================

To solve the problem of identifying numbers that do not contain any even digits from a list of positive integers, we need to follow a structured approach. Let's break down the problem and devise a solution step by step.

### Problem Analysis

1. **Input**: A list of positive integers.
2. **Output**: A sorted list of integers from the input list that do not contain any even digits.
3. **Constraints**:
   - We need to check each digit of each number to determine if it is even.
   - Even digits are: 0, 2, 4, 6, 8.
   - The output list should be sorted in increasing order.

### Approach

1. **Iterate through the list**: We need to examine each number in the input list.
2. **Check digits**: For each number, convert it to a string to easily iterate over each digit.
3. **Identify even digits**: Check if any digit in the number is an even digit.
4. **Filter numbers**: If a number contains no even digits, include it in the result list.
5. **Sort the result**: Once we have filtered the numbers, sort the resulting list in increasing order.
6. **Return the result**: Return the sorted list of numbers that contain no even digits.

### Implementation

Let's implement the function based on the above approach:

```python
def unique_digits(x):
    """Given a list of positive integers x, return a sorted list of all 
    elements that don't have any even digit.
    """
    result = []
    for number in x:
        # Convert the number to a string to iterate over its digits
        str_number = str(number)
        # Check if any digit is even
        has_even_digit = any(digit in '02468' for digit in str_number)
        # If no even digit is found, add the number to the result list
        if not has_even_digit:
            result.append(number)
    # Sort the result list in increasing order
    result.sort()
    return result

# Example usage:
print(unique_digits([15, 33, 1422, 1]))  # Output: [1, 15, 33]
print(unique_digits([152, 323, 1422, 10]))  # Output: []
```

### Explanation

- **Conversion to String**: We convert each number to a string to easily iterate over its digits.
- **Checking for Even Digits**: We use a generator expression with `any()` to check if any digit in the number is an even digit.
- **Filtering**: If a number passes the check (i.e., it has no even digits), we add it to the `result` list.
- **Sorting**: Finally, we sort the `result` list before returning it to ensure the numbers are in increasing order.

This implementation efficiently filters and sorts the numbers as required by the problem statement.
