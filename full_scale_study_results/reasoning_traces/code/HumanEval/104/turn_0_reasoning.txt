==================================================

Reasoning:

The problem is asking to return a sorted list of all elements that do not contain any even digit. 

To solve the problem I will use the following steps
- Initialize an empty list to store the numbers that do not contain any even digit
- Iterate through the given list
- Convert each number to a string
- Check if the number contains any even digit
- If the number does not contain any even digit, add it to the list
- Finally, return the sorted list

Implementation: 

Now I will implement the solution in Python. 

```python
def unique_digits(x):
    result = []
    for num in x:
        if all(int(digit) % 2 != 0 for digit in str(num)):
            result.append(num)
    return sorted(result)
```

This function works by iterating over each number in the input list. For each number, it converts the number to a string and checks if all the digits are odd. If they are, it adds the number to the result list. Finally, it returns the sorted result list. 

The time complexity for this function is O(n*m*log(n)), where n is the length of the input list and m is the average number of digits in the numbers in the list. This is because for each number, we need to check all its digits (which takes O(m) time), and we need to do this for all numbers (which takes O(n) time). Sorting the result list takes O(n*log(n)) time. Therefore, the total time complexity is O(n*m + n*log(n)) = O(n*m*log(n)). 

The space complexity for this function is O(n), where n is the length of the input list. This is because in the worst case, all numbers in the input list do not contain any even digit, so we need to store all of them in the result list.
