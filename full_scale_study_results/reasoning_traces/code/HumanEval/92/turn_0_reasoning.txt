Reasoning:

Given three numbers, we are to determine if one of the numbers is equal to the sum of the other two numbers. We can obtain a solution for this by performing the following steps:
1. Check if all the numbers are integers. If not, return False.
2. Check if the sum of any two numbers is equal to the third number. If yes, return True.
3. If none of the above conditions are met, return False.

Implementation:

Now, let's implement this in Python. We'll use the built-in Python function `isinstance()` to check if the numbers are integers. Then, we'll use simple arithmetic operations to check if the sum of any two numbers is equal to the third number. 

Here is the Python function that implements the above approach: 

```python
def any_int(x, y, z):
    # Check if all numbers are integers
    if not all(isinstance(i, int) for i in [x, y, z]):
        return False

    # Check if the sum of any two numbers is equal to the third number
    if x + y == z or x + z == y or y + z == x:
        return True

    # If none of the above conditions are met, return False
    return False
```

This function first checks if all numbers are integers. If not, it returns False. Then, it checks if the sum of any two numbers is equal to the third number. If yes, it returns True. If none of these conditions are met, it returns False.
