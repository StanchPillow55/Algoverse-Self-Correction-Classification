To solve the problem of counting the number of n-digit positive integers that start or end with 1, we need to break down the problem and consider the constraints and possibilities.

### Problem Breakdown

1. **Understanding n-digit numbers**:
   - An n-digit number is a number that has exactly n digits.
   - The smallest n-digit number is \(10^{(n-1)}\).
   - The largest n-digit number is \(10^n - 1\).

2. **Counting numbers that start with 1**:
   - If a number starts with 1, the first digit is fixed as 1.
   - The remaining \(n-1\) digits can be anything from 0 to 9.
   - Therefore, there are \(10^{(n-1)}\) numbers that start with 1.

3. **Counting numbers that end with 1**:
   - If a number ends with 1, the last digit is fixed as 1.
   - The first digit can be anything from 1 to 9 (to ensure it's an n-digit number).
   - The remaining \(n-2\) digits can be anything from 0 to 9.
   - Therefore, there are \(9 \times 10^{(n-2)}\) numbers that end with 1.

4. **Avoid double counting numbers that both start and end with 1**:
   - If a number both starts and ends with 1, the first and last digits are fixed as 1.
   - The remaining \(n-2\) digits can be anything from 0 to 9.
   - Therefore, there are \(10^{(n-2)}\) numbers that both start and end with 1.

5. **Using the principle of inclusion-exclusion**:
   - Total numbers that start or end with 1 = (Numbers that start with 1) + (Numbers that end with 1) - (Numbers that both start and end with 1).

### Implementation

Now, let's implement the function `starts_one_ends(n)` using the above reasoning:

```python
def starts_one_ends(n):
    """
    Given a positive integer n, return the count of the numbers of n-digit
    positive integers that start or end with 1.
    """
    if n == 1:
        # Special case: For 1-digit numbers, they are 1, 2, ..., 9.
        # Only 1 starts or ends with 1.
        return 1
    
    # Numbers that start with 1
    start_with_1 = 10**(n-1)
    
    # Numbers that end with 1
    end_with_1 = 9 * 10**(n-2)
    
    # Numbers that both start and end with 1
    both_start_and_end_with_1 = 10**(n-2)
    
    # Total using inclusion-exclusion principle
    total = start_with_1 + end_with_1 - both_start_and_end_with_1
    
    return total

# Example usage:
# print(starts_one_ends(2))  # Should return 18
```

### Explanation

- For \(n = 1\), the only number that starts or ends with 1 is 1 itself.
- For \(n \geq 2\), we calculate the numbers that start with 1, end with 1, and both start and end with 1, and apply the inclusion-exclusion principle to avoid double counting.
- This approach efficiently counts the desired numbers using basic arithmetic operations and powers of 10.
