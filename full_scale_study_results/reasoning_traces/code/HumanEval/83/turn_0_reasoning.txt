The problem is asking to find the count of n-digit positive integers that start or end with 1.

Let's break down the problem:

1. We need to find the numbers that start with 1. For an n-digit number, the first digit can be 1 and the rest (n-1) digits can be any number from 0 to 9. So, there are 10^(n-1) such numbers.

2. We need to find the numbers that end with 1. For an n-digit number, the last digit can be 1 and the rest (n-1) digits can be any number from 1 to 9 (as 0 at the start of a number is not considered). So, there are 9*(10^(n-2)) such numbers.

3. But, there is an overlap in the numbers that start and end with 1. These are the numbers that both start and end with 1. For an n-digit number, the first and last digits can be 1 and the rest (n-2) digits can be any number from 0 to 9. So, there are 10^(n-2) such numbers.

4. To find the total count, we need to add the counts from step 1 and step 2 and then subtract the count from step 3 to remove the overlap.

Let's implement this in Python:

```python
def starts_one_ends(n):
    """
    Given a positive integer n, return the count of the numbers of n-digit
    positive integers that start or end with 1.
    """
    if n == 1:
        return 1  # Only one 1-digit number that starts or ends with 1
    else:
        starts_with_one = 10 ** (n - 1)
        ends_with_one = 9 * (10 ** (n - 2))
        starts_and_ends_with_one = 10 ** (n - 2)
        return starts_with_one + ends_with_one - starts_and_ends_with_one
```

This function works by calculating the count of numbers that start with 1, end with 1, and both start and end with 1, then returning the total count after removing the overlap.
