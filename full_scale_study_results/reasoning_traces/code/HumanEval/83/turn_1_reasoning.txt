==================================================

To solve the problem of counting the number of n-digit positive integers that start or end with 1, we need to consider the following:

### Problem Analysis

1. **Definition of n-digit Numbers**:
   - An n-digit number is a number that has exactly n digits.
   - For example, 3-digit numbers range from 100 to 999.

2. **Constraints**:
   - The number must either start with 1 or end with 1, or both.

3. **Counting Strategy**:
   - **Start with 1**: The first digit is 1, and the remaining (n-1) digits can be anything from 0 to 9.
   - **End with 1**: The last digit is 1, and the first (n-1) digits can be anything from 1 to 9 for the first digit and 0 to 9 for the rest.

4. **Avoid Double Counting**:
   - Numbers that both start and end with 1 are counted twice in the above two cases, so we need to subtract these from the total.

### Detailed Steps

1. **Count Numbers Starting with 1**:
   - The first digit is fixed as 1.
   - The remaining (n-1) digits can be any digit from 0 to 9.
   - Total numbers starting with 1: \(10^{(n-1)}\).

2. **Count Numbers Ending with 1**:
   - The last digit is fixed as 1.
   - The first digit can be any digit from 1 to 9 (to ensure it's an n-digit number).
   - The remaining (n-2) digits can be any digit from 0 to 9.
   - Total numbers ending with 1: \(9 \times 10^{(n-2)}\).

3. **Count Numbers Starting and Ending with 1**:
   - Both the first and last digits are fixed as 1.
   - The remaining (n-2) digits can be any digit from 0 to 9.
   - Total numbers starting and ending with 1: \(10^{(n-2)}\).

4. **Combine the Counts**:
   - Total = (Numbers starting with 1) + (Numbers ending with 1) - (Numbers starting and ending with 1).

### Implementation

Now, let's implement the function based on the above reasoning:

```python
def starts_one_ends(n):
    """
    Given a positive integer n, return the count of the numbers of n-digit
    positive integers that start or end with 1.
    """
    if n == 1:
        # Special case for 1-digit numbers: 1, 2, ..., 9
        return 1  # Only the number 1 satisfies the condition

    # Count numbers starting with 1
    start_with_1 = 10**(n-1)
    
    # Count numbers ending with 1
    end_with_1 = 9 * 10**(n-2)
    
    # Count numbers starting and ending with 1
    start_and_end_with_1 = 10**(n-2)
    
    # Total count
    total = start_with_1 + end_with_1 - start_and_end_with_1
    
    return total
```

### Explanation of Edge Cases

- **n = 1**: For single-digit numbers, only the number 1 starts or ends with 1.
- **n > 1**: The formula applies as described, ensuring no double counting.

This solution efficiently calculates the desired count using basic arithmetic operations and powers of 10, making it suitable for large values of n.
