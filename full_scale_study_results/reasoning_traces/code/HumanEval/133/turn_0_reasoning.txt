Reasoning:

Given a list of numbers, we are to determine the sum of the square of each number in the list. We can obtain a solution for this by performing the following steps:
1. Iterate through all the elements in the list
2. For each element in the list, we would find the ceiling of the number. The ceiling of a number is the smallest integer greater than or equal to the number. In python, we can find the ceiling of a number by using the `math.ceil()` function.
3. After finding the ceiling of the number, we would then find the square of the number by multiplying the number by itself.
4. We would then sum up all the squared numbers in the list and output the sum as the result.

Example
----------
Suppose we have a list such that `lst = [1.4,4.2,0]`. The ceiling of `1.4` is `2`, the ceiling of `4.2` is `5` and the ceiling of `0` is `0`. Thus the sum of the squares of the numbers in the list would be `2^2 + 5^2 + 0^2 = 4 + 25 + 0 = 29`

Implementation
-----------------
We can implement this in python by using the `math.ceil()` function to find the ceiling of a number and then squaring the number. We would then sum up all the squared numbers in the list and output the sum as the result. 

Here is the python function to solve the problem: 

```python
import math

def sum_squares(lst):
    # sum up the square of the ceiling of each number in the list
    return sum(math.ceil(i)**2 for i in lst)
```

The function `sum_squares(lst)` takes in a list `lst` as input and returns the sum of the square of the ceiling of each number in the list. The function uses a generator expression to iterate over each element in the list, find the ceiling of the number, square it, and then sum up all the squared numbers. The `math.ceil(i)` function is used to find the ceiling of a number and `i**2` is used to find the square of a number. The `sum()` function is then used to sum up all the squared numbers.
