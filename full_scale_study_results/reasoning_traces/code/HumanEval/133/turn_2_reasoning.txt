Turn: 2
Dataset Type: code
==================================================

Reasoning:

Given a list of numbers, we are to determine the sum of the square of each number in the list. We can obtain a solution for this by performing the following steps:
1. Iterate through all the elements in the list
2. For each element in the list, round it up to the nearest integer and square it
3. Sum up all the squared numbers and return the sum as the output

Approach:

1. Initialize a variable `sum` to 0. This will hold the sum of the squares of the numbers in the list.
2. Iterate through the list of numbers. For each number, round it up to the nearest integer using the `math.ceil()` function, square it using the `**` operator, and add it to `sum`.
3. After the loop, return `sum`.

Implementation:

Let's implement this in a function `sum_squares(lst)`. We'll need to import the `math` module to use the `math.ceil()` function. 

Here is the Python code for the above approach:

```python
import math

def sum_squares(lst):
    sum = 0
    for num in lst:
        sum += math.ceil(num) ** 2
    return sum
```

This function works by iterating through each number in the list, rounding it up to the nearest integer, squaring it, and adding it to the sum. The `math.ceil()` function is used to round up the number, and the `**` operator is used to square it. The sum of the squares is then returned. 

This function should work for any list of numbers, including lists with negative numbers and floating-point numbers. The `math.ceil()` function rounds up to the nearest integer, so it will correctly handle negative numbers and floating-point numbers. The squaring operation and the addition operation are also well-defined for all numbers, so they will not cause any problems.
