Question ID: HumanEval/133
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: code
==================================================

Reasoning:

Given a list of numbers, we are to find the sum of the squares of each number in the list. We are to round each number to the nearest upper integer before squaring. We can obtain a solution for this by performing the following steps:
1. Iterate through all the elements in the list
2. For each element in the list, round it up to the nearest integer
3. Square the rounded up integer
4. Sum all the squared integers

Approach:
- Initialize a variable `sum` to 0. This will hold the sum of the squares of the numbers in the list.
- Iterate through each number in the list. For each number:
  - Use the `math.ceil()` function to round the number up to the nearest integer.
  - Square the rounded number using the `**` operator.
  - Add the squared number to `sum`.
- After iterating through all the numbers, return `sum`.

Implementation: 

Now, let's implement this in Python. We'll use the `math` module for the `ceil()` function, which rounds a number up to the nearest integer.
