==================================================

Reasoning:

Given a list of integers, we are to sort the list in ascending order based on the sum of their digits. If there are several items with similar sum of their digits, we are to order them based on their index in the original list. 

We can obtain a solution for this by performing the following steps:
1. Initialize a list to keep track of the sum of the digits of each element in the list. For each element in the list, we would calculate the sum of the digits and append it to our list
2. Next, we would sort the list of sums and the original list in parallel. We would sort the list of sums in ascending order and the original list according to the order of the sorted list of sums. 

In python, we can use the built-in `sorted` function to sort the list. The `sorted` function takes two arguments: the list to sort and a key function that computes a value for each element in the list. The elements are then sorted based on these computed values. In this case, the key function would be a lambda function that returns the sum of the digits of a number.

Approach:
1. Define a function `order_by_points` that takes a list `nums` as input.
2. Use the `sorted` function to sort `nums`. The key function should be a lambda function that computes the sum of the digits of a number.
3. Return the sorted list.

Implementation: 

Let's implement this in code.
