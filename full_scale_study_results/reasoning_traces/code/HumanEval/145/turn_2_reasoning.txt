Turn: 2
Dataset Type: code
==================================================

Reasoning:

Given a list of integers, we are to sort the list in ascending order based on the sum of their digits. We can obtain a solution for this by performing the following steps:
1. Initialize a list to keep track of the sum of the digits of each integer in the list
2. Iterate through all the integers in the list. On each iteration, we would calculate the sum of the digits of the integer and append it to the list we initialized in step 1
3. After obtaining the list of sums, we would sort the list of integers based on the sum of their digits. In the event that two integers have the same sum of digits, we would maintain their original order in the list

Implementation:

We can implement this in python by using the built-in `sorted` function. We would pass in a lambda function as the key to the `sorted` function. The lambda function would calculate the sum of the digits of each integer. The `sorted` function would then sort the list based on the sum of the digits of each integer. In the event that two integers have the same sum of digits, the `sorted` function would maintain their original order in the list. This is because python's `sorted` function is stable (i.e., it maintains the relative order of items with equal sort keys).

Here is the python function that implements the above approach:

```python
def order_by_points(nums):
    return sorted(nums, key=lambda x: sum(int(digit) for digit in str(abs(x))))
```

In the lambda function, we convert each integer to its absolute value before converting it to a string. This is because the problem statement does not specify how to handle negative integers. By converting each integer to its absolute value, we ensure that the sum of the digits of a negative integer is the same as the sum of the digits of its positive counterpart. This seems to be the most reasonable interpretation of the problem statement.
