The problem is asking to sort a list of integers based on the sum of their digits. If two numbers have the same sum of digits, they should remain in their original order. This is a stable sort, meaning that equal elements retain their relative positions.

Here is the step by step reasoning and approach to solve this problem:

1. We need to create a function that takes a list of integers as an argument.

2. We need to sort this list, but not in the usual way. We need to sort it based on the sum of the digits of each number. 

3. To get the sum of the digits of a number, we can convert the number to a string, iterate over each character in the string, convert each character back to an integer, and add them up.

4. We can use the built-in sorted function in Python, which takes an optional key argument. This argument should be a function that takes one input (an element from the list) and returns a value that will be used for sorting. In our case, this function should return the sum of the digits of the input number.

5. The sorted function also retains the relative order of items with equal sort keys (i.e., it is a stable sort), which is exactly what we need.

6. Finally, we return the sorted list.

Here is the Python code that implements this approach:

```python
def order_by_points(nums):
    # Define a function that returns the sum of the digits of a number
    def sum_of_digits(n):
        return sum(int(digit) for digit in str(abs(n)))

    # Sort the list using the sum of the digits as the sort key
    return sorted(nums, key=sum_of_digits)
```

This function works by defining a helper function sum_of_digits that calculates the sum of the digits of a number. It then uses this function as the key function for the sorted function, which sorts the list in ascending order based on the sum of the digits. The sorted function is stable, so numbers with the same sum of digits retain their original order.
