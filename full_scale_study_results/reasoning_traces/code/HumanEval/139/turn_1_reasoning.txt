==================================================

To solve the problem of calculating the "Brazilian factorial" (or "special factorial") of a given integer `n`, we need to understand the definition provided:

The Brazilian factorial of `n` is defined as the product of the factorials of all integers from `n` down to 1. Mathematically, this can be expressed as:

\[ \text{brazilian\_factorial}(n) = n! \times (n-1)! \times (n-2)! \times \ldots \times 1! \]

Where `n!` denotes the factorial of `n`, which is the product of all positive integers up to `n`.

### Step-by-step Approach:

1. **Understand Factorial Calculation**: 
   - The factorial of a number `k`, denoted as `k!`, is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to `k`. For example, `4! = 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 24`.

2. **Iterate from `n` to `1`**:
   - We need to calculate the factorial for each integer from `n` down to `1`.

3. **Multiply Factorials**:
   - As we calculate each factorial, we multiply it with the running product to get the Brazilian factorial.

4. **Implementation Details**:
   - We can use a helper function to calculate the factorial of a number.
   - We will iterate from `n` down to `1`, calculate the factorial for each number, and multiply it to a cumulative product.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - Since the problem states `n > 0`, we don't need to handle the case where `n` is zero or negative.

### Implementation:

Let's implement the function `special_factorial` using the above approach:

```python
def factorial(k):
    """Helper function to calculate the factorial of k."""
    if k == 0 or k == 1:
        return 1
    result = 1
    for i in range(2, k + 1):
        result *= i
    return result

def special_factorial(n):
    """Calculate the Brazilian factorial of n."""
    if n <= 0:
        raise ValueError("n must be greater than 0")
    
    brazilian_factorial = 1
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        brazilian_factorial *= factorial(i)
    
    return brazilian_factorial

# Example usage:
print(special_factorial(4))  # Output: 288
```

### Explanation:

- **Factorial Calculation**: The `factorial` function calculates the factorial of a given number `k` using a simple loop.
- **Brazilian Factorial Calculation**: In `special_factorial`, we initialize `brazilian_factorial` to 1. We then iterate from 1 to `n`, calculate the factorial of each number using the `factorial` helper function, and multiply it to `brazilian_factorial`.
- **Edge Case Handling**: We raise a `ValueError` if `n` is less than or equal to 0, as the problem specifies `n > 0`.

This solution efficiently calculates the Brazilian factorial by leveraging the factorial calculation in a loop, ensuring correctness and clarity.
