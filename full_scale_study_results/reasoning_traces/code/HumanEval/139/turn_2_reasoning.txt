To solve the problem of calculating the "Brazilian factorial" or "special factorial" of a number \( n \), we need to understand the definition provided:

The Brazilian factorial of \( n \) is defined as:
\[ \text{brazilian\_factorial}(n) = n! \times (n-1)! \times (n-2)! \times \ldots \times 1! \]

This means we need to compute the factorial of each integer from 1 to \( n \) and then multiply all these factorials together.

Let's break down the steps to solve this:

1. **Understand Factorial**: The factorial of a number \( k \), denoted as \( k! \), is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to \( k \). For example, \( 4! = 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 24 \).

2. **Iterate from 1 to \( n \)**: We need to compute the factorial for each number from 1 to \( n \).

3. **Compute Factorials**: For each number \( i \) from 1 to \( n \), calculate \( i! \).

4. **Accumulate the Product**: Multiply all these factorials together to get the Brazilian factorial.

5. **Return the Result**: Finally, return the accumulated product.

Now, let's implement this in Python:

```python
def special_factorial(n):
    """The Brazilian factorial is defined as:
    brazilian_factorial(n) = n! * (n-1)! * (n-2)! * ... * 1!
    where n > 0
    """
    # Initialize the result to 1 (multiplicative identity)
    result = 1
    
    # Iterate over each number from 1 to n
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        # Calculate the factorial of i
        factorial = 1
        for j in range(1, i + 1):
            factorial *= j
        
        # Multiply the current factorial to the result
        result *= factorial
    
    return result

# Example usage:
print(special_factorial(4))  # Output should be 288
```

### Explanation:

- We start with a `result` initialized to 1 because we are multiplying values.
- We loop through each integer \( i \) from 1 to \( n \).
- For each \( i \), we calculate its factorial by multiplying all integers from 1 to \( i \).
- We multiply the calculated factorial of \( i \) to the `result`.
- Finally, after the loop, `result` holds the Brazilian factorial of \( n \), which we return.

This approach ensures that we correctly compute the Brazilian factorial by iterating through each factorial and accumulating their product.
