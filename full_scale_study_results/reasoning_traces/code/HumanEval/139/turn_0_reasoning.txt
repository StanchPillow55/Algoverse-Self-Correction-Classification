==================================================

First, let's understand the problem. We need to calculate the special factorial of a number. The special factorial is defined as the product of the factorial of all numbers from n to 1.

The factorial of a number n is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n. It is denoted by n!.

For example, the factorial of 5 is 5*4*3*2*1 = 120.

The special factorial of a number n is the product of the factorial of all numbers from n to 1.

For example, the special factorial of 4 is 4! * 3! * 2! * 1! = 24 * 6 * 2 * 1 = 288.

To solve this problem, we can use a loop to calculate the factorial of each number from n to 1, and then multiply these factorials together.

Here is the Python code for this problem:

```python
def special_factorial(n):
    def factorial(n):
        if n == 0:
            return 1
        else:
            return n * factorial(n-1)
    
    result = 1
    for i in range(n, 0, -1):
        result *= factorial(i)
    
    return result
```

In this code, we define a helper function `factorial` to calculate the factorial of a number. Then, in the `special_factorial` function, we use a loop to calculate the factorial of each number from n to 1, and multiply these factorials together to get the special factorial.

The time complexity of this code is O(n^2), because for each number from n to 1, we calculate its factorial, which takes O(n) time. Therefore, the total time complexity is O(n) * O(n) = O(n^2).

The space complexity of this code is O(n), because the maximum depth of the recursion stack is n when calculating the factorial of a number.
