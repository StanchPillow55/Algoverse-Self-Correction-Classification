==================================================

The problem is asking to return the number of mangoes in the basket. We are given the total number of fruits in the basket, and a string that contains the number of apples and oranges. 

To solve the problem, I will use the following steps:
- Extract the number of apples and oranges from the string. 
- Subtract the number of apples and oranges from the total number of fruits to get the number of mangoes.

To extract the numbers from the string, I will use the split() function in Python, which splits a string into a list where each word is a list item. The split function splits the string at whitespace by default. 

After splitting the string, I will have a list like this: ['5', 'apples', 'and', '6', 'oranges']. The first and fourth elements of the list are the numbers of apples and oranges, respectively. I will convert these elements to integers and subtract them from the total number of fruits to get the number of mangoes.

Here is the Python function that implements this approach:

```python
def fruit_distribution(s, n):
    # Split the string into a list of words
    words = s.split()
    # Extract the number of apples and oranges
    apples = int(words[0])
    oranges = int(words[3])
    # Calculate and return the number of mangoes
    return n - apples - oranges
```

This function works by first splitting the input string into a list of words. It then converts the first and fourth words to integers, which represent the number of apples and oranges, respectively. Finally, it subtracts the number of apples and oranges from the total number of fruits to get the number of mangoes, and returns this value.
