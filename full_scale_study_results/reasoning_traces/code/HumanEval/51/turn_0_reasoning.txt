==================================================

Reasoning:

Given a string, we are to determine a string without any vowels. We can easily obtain a solution for this by iterating through all the characters in the string and checking if the current character is a vowel. If it is, we skip that character. If it isn't, we add it to our result string. 

We would also have to take into consideration both uppercase and lowercase vowels. 

Steps: 
- Initialize an empty string, result.
- Iterate through each character in the input string.
- If the character is not a vowel (not in 'aeiouAEIOU'), add it to the result.
- Return the result.

Now let's implement this in code.

Implementation:

```python
def remove_vowels(text):
    """
    remove_vowels is a function that takes string and returns string without vowels.
    """
    result = ''
    for char in text:
        if char not in 'aeiouAEIOU':
            result += char
    return result
```

This function works by iterating over each character in the input string. If the character is not a vowel (i.e., it's not in the string 'aeiouAEIOU'), it's added to the result string. Once all characters have been processed, the result string is returned. This string contains all the original characters from the input string, minus any vowels.
