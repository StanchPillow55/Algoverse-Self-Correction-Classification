==================================================

Reasoning:

The problem is asking to return a dictionary that contains the frequency of each letter in the given string. The string is space-separated, so we need to split the string by space to get each letter. 

After getting each letter, we can use a dictionary to keep track of the frequency of each letter. 

In Python, dictionary is a built-in data type that can be used to store key-value pairs. The key in our case will be the letter and the value will be the frequency of the letter.

We can iterate through each letter in the string, and for each letter, we can increase its count in the dictionary by 1. If the letter is not in the dictionary, we can add it with a count of 1.

Finally, we need to return the dictionary that contains the letter with the most repetition. If several letters have the same occurrence, we need to return all of them. To do this, we can iterate through the dictionary and find the maximum value. Then, we can create a new dictionary that contains only the letters with the maximum value.

Here is the Python function that implements the above approach:

Implementation:

```python
def histogram(test):
    # Split the string by space to get each letter
    letters = test.split()
    
    # Initialize an empty dictionary to store the frequency of each letter
    freq = {}
    
    # Iterate through each letter
    for letter in letters:
        # If the letter is in the dictionary, increase its count by 1
        if letter in freq:
            freq[letter] += 1
        # If the letter is not in the dictionary, add it with a count of 1
        else:
            freq[letter] = 1
    
    # Find the maximum value in the dictionary
    max_value = max(freq.values()) if freq else 0
    
    # Create a new dictionary that contains only the letters with the maximum value
    max_freq = {key: value for key, value in freq.items() if value == max_value}
    
    return max_freq
```

This function works for any string of space-separated lowercase letters. It returns an empty dictionary if the input string is empty.
