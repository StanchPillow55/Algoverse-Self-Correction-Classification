==================================================

First, let's understand the problem. We are given a string of space-separated lowercase letters. We need to return a dictionary where the keys are the letters and the values are the counts of each letter in the string. If several letters have the same maximum count, we need to return all of them. 

Here is the step-by-step approach to solve this problem:

1. First, we need to split the string into individual letters. We can use the split() function in Python for this. This function splits a string into a list where each word is a list item.

2. Next, we need to count the occurrence of each letter. We can use a dictionary for this. The keys of the dictionary will be the letters and the values will be the counts.

3. Then, we need to find the maximum count. We can use the max() function in Python for this. This function returns the largest item in an iterable or the largest of two or more arguments.

4. Finally, we need to create a new dictionary that only contains the letters with the maximum count. We can use a dictionary comprehension for this. This is a concise way to create dictionaries from an existing iterable.

Now, let's implement this approach in code.

```python
def histogram(test):
    # Step 1: Split the string into individual letters
    letters = test.split()

    # Step 2: Count the occurrence of each letter
    counts = {}
    for letter in letters:
        if letter in counts:
            counts[letter] += 1
        else:
            counts[letter] = 1

    # Step 3: Find the maximum count
    max_count = max(counts.values()) if counts else 0

    # Step 4: Create a new dictionary that only contains the letters with the maximum count
    max_counts = {letter: count for letter, count in counts.items() if count == max_count}

    return max_counts
```

This function works by first splitting the string into individual letters, then counting the occurrence of each letter, then finding the maximum count, and finally creating a new dictionary that only contains the letters with the maximum count.
