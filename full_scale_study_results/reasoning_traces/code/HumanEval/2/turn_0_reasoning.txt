==================================================

The problem is asking to return the decimal part of a given positive floating point number.

To solve this problem, we can use the built-in Python function int() which converts a number or a string to an integer. If the argument is a floating point number, it will truncate the number at the decimal point. 

So, if we subtract the integer part of the number from the original number, we will get the decimal part of the number.

Here is the step by step approach:

1. Convert the given number to an integer using the int() function. This will give us the integer part of the number.
2. Subtract the integer part from the original number to get the decimal part.
3. Return the decimal part.

Here is the Python function that implements this approach:

```python
def truncate_number(number: float) -> float:
    integer_part = int(number)
    decimal_part = number - integer_part
    return decimal_part
```

This function works by first converting the input number to an integer, which removes the decimal part. Then it subtracts this integer from the original number, leaving only the decimal part. This decimal part is then returned.

Let's test this function with the provided example:

```python
print(truncate_number(3.5))  # Expected output: 0.5
```

This function should work for any positive floating point number. However, it will not work correctly for negative numbers, since the int() function rounds towards zero, not downwards. For example, int(-3.5) would return -3, not -4. But this is not a problem, since the problem statement specifies that the input will be a positive number.
