Reasoning:

Given a list of integers, we are to determine the maximum element at each index in the list. We can obtain a solution for this by performing the following steps: 

- Initialize a variable `max_val` to hold the maximum value at each index in the list. We would set this to the first element in the list
- Next, we would iterate through the entire list of integers. At each index, we would check if the current element in the list is greater than the `max_val`. If it is, we would update the `max_val` to be the current element in the list
- We would then append the `max_val` to our result list
- Finally, we would output the result list which would be the maximum element at each index in the list

Let's implement this:

Implementation:

```python
from typing import List, Tuple

def rolling_max(numbers: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    """ From a given list of integers, generate a list of rolling maximum element found until given moment
    in the sequence.
    >>> rolling_max([1, 2, 3, 2, 3, 4, 2])
    [1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4]
    """
    # store the maximum value at each index in the list
    max_val = numbers[0]
    
    # store the result list
    result = [max_val]
    
    # iterate through the entire list
    for i in range(1, len(numbers)):
        # check if the current element in the list is greater than the max_val
        if numbers[i] > max_val:
            # update the max_val to be the current element in the list
            max_val = numbers[i]
            
        # append the max_val to the result list
        result.append(max_val)
        
    # output the result list
    return result
```

The time complexity of this solution is O(n) because we iterate through the list of numbers once. The space complexity is also O(n) because we store the maximum value at each index in a new list.
