==================================================

Reasoning:

The problem is asking to return a list of maximum numbers found until the given moment in the sequence. This is also known as the rolling maximum.

The rolling maximum is a sequence of maximum values where each value is the maximum of the current element and all the previous elements.

To solve this problem, I will use the following steps:

1. Initialize an empty list to store the rolling maximum values.
2. Initialize a variable to keep track of the current maximum value. Set it to negative infinity to start with because any number in the list will be greater than this initial maximum.
3. Iterate over the list of numbers. For each number, update the current maximum if the number is greater than the current maximum.
4. Append the current maximum to the list of rolling maximum values.
5. Return the list of rolling maximum values.

This approach works because it keeps track of the maximum value seen so far and updates it whenever a larger number is encountered. This ensures that the rolling maximum is always the maximum of all the numbers seen so far.

Now let's implement this solution.

Implementation:

```python
from typing import List

def rolling_max(numbers: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    """ From a given list of integers, generate a list of rolling maximum element found until given moment
    in the sequence.
    """
    # Initialize the list to store the rolling maximum values
    max_values = []
    # Initialize the current maximum to negative infinity
    current_max = float('-inf')
    # Iterate over the list of numbers
    for num in numbers:
        # Update the current maximum if the current number is greater
        if num > current_max:
            current_max = num
        # Append the current maximum to the list of maximum values
        max_values.append(current_max)
    # Return the list of maximum values
    return max_values
```

This function works by maintaining a running maximum and updating it whenever a larger number is encountered. It then appends the current maximum to the list of maximum values. This ensures that the list of maximum values always contains the maximum of all the numbers seen so far.
