Reasoning:

The problem is asking to find the number of times we need to lower the buckets to empty the wells. Each well has a corresponding bucket that can be used to extract water from it, and all buckets have the same capacity.

We can solve this problem by following these steps:
1. Count the total number of units of water in the grid. We can do this by summing up all the 1s in the grid.
2. Divide the total number of units of water by the capacity of the bucket. This will give us the number of times we need to lower the buckets to empty the wells. If there is a remainder after the division, we need to lower the bucket one more time to extract the remaining water.

Let's implement this in Python.

Implementation:

```python
def max_fill(grid, capacity):
    # Step 1: Count the total number of units of water in the grid
    total_water = sum(sum(row) for row in grid)
    
    # Step 2: Divide the total number of units of water by the capacity of the bucket
    # If there is a remainder after the division, we need to lower the bucket one more time
    return total_water // capacity + (total_water % capacity > 0)
```

This function works by first calculating the total amount of water in the grid by summing up all the 1s in the grid. Then, it calculates the number of times we need to lower the buckets to empty the wells by dividing the total amount of water by the capacity of the bucket. If there is a remainder after the division, it means that there is still some water left in the wells, so we need to lower the bucket one more time. This is why we add `(total_water % capacity > 0)` to the result. This expression is `True` if there is a remainder after the division, and `False` otherwise. In Python, `True` is equivalent to `1` and `False` is equivalent to `0`, so this effectively adds 1 to the result if there is a remainder, and 0 otherwise.
