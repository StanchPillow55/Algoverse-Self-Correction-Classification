==================================================

First, let's understand the problem. We have a grid of wells, where each row represents a well and each 1 in a row represents a unit of water. We have a bucket of a certain capacity and we want to find out how many times we need to lower the bucket to empty all the wells.

The bucket can be filled with water from different wells in one go, but it cannot exceed its capacity. Once the bucket is full or there is no more water in the wells, we count it as one time of lowering the bucket.

To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:

1. Count the total amount of water in all wells.
2. Divide the total amount of water by the capacity of the bucket.
3. If there is a remainder, add 1 to the result because we need to lower the bucket one more time to get the remaining water.

Now, let's implement this in Python.

```python
def max_fill(grid, capacity):
    # Step 1: Count the total amount of water in all wells
    total_water = sum(sum(row) for row in grid)
    
    # Step 2: Divide the total amount of water by the capacity of the bucket
    times = total_water // capacity
    
    # Step 3: If there is a remainder, add 1 to the result
    if total_water % capacity != 0:
        times += 1
    
    return times
```

This function works by first calculating the total amount of water in all wells, which is done by summing up all the 1s in the grid. Then it calculates how many times we need to lower the bucket by dividing the total amount of water by the capacity of the bucket. If there is a remainder, it means that we need to lower the bucket one more time to get the remaining water, so we add 1 to the result. Finally, it returns the number of times we need to lower the bucket.

This function has a time complexity of O(n*m), where n is the number of rows in the grid and m is the number of columns in the grid. This is because we need to iterate over all elements in the grid to count the total amount of water. The space complexity is O(1), as we only use a constant amount of space to store the total amount of water and the number of times we need to lower the bucket.
