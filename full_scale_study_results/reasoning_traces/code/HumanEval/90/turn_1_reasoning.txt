Reasoning:

Given a list of integers, we are to determine the second smallest element in the list. We can obtain a solution for this by performing the following steps:
1. First, we would check if the length of the list is less than 2. If it is, we would return None as there would be no second smallest element in the list
2. Next, we would initialize two variables `first` and `second` to positive infinity. These variables would be used to keep track of the smallest and second smallest elements in the list
3. We would then iterate through all the elements in the list. On each iteration, we would check if the current element is less than the variable `first`. If it is, we would update the value of `second` to be equal to `first` and update the value of `first` to be equal to the current element in the list
4. If the current element in the list is not less than `first` but is less than `second`, we would update the value of `second` to be equal to the current element in the list
5. Finally, we would check if the value of `second` is still equal to positive infinity. If it is, we would return None as there is no second smallest element in the list. If it is not, we would return the value of `second` as the second smallest element in the list

Example
----------
Suppose we have a single test case such that the list is equal to [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. The smallest element in the list is 1 and the second smallest element in the list is 2. Thus the output would be equal to 2

Suppose we have a single test case such that the list is equal to [5, 1, 4, 3, 2]. The smallest element in the list is 1 and the second smallest element in the list is 2. Thus the output would be equal to 2

Suppose we have a single test case such that the list is equal to [1, 1]. The smallest element in the list is 1 and there is no second smallest element in the list. Thus the output would be equal to None

Suppose we have a single test case such that the list is equal to []. There is no element in the list. Thus the output would be equal to None

Implementation:
-------------------
We can implement the solution as follows: 

```python
def next_smallest(lst):
    if len(lst) < 2:
        return None

    first = float('inf')
    second = float('inf')

    for num in lst:
        if num < first:
            second = first
            first = num
        elif num < second and num != first:
            second = num

    if second == float('inf'):
        return None
    else:
        return second
```
This function works by first checking if the length of the list is less than 2. If it is, it returns None. If it is not, it initializes two variables `first` and `second` to positive infinity. It then iterates through the list, updating `first` and `second` as necessary. Finally, it checks if `second` is still equal to positive infinity. If it is, it returns None. If it is not, it returns `second`.
