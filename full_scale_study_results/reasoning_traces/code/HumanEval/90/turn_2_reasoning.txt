Reasoning:

Given a list of integers, we are to determine the second smallest element in the list. We can obtain a solution for this by performing the following steps:
1. Check if the length of the list is less than 2. If it is, we would return `None` since there would be no second smallest element in the list.
2. If the length of the list is greater than or equal to 2, we would initialize two variables `min1` and `min2` to `float('inf')`. `min1` would keep track of the smallest element in the list and `min2` would keep track of the second smallest element in the list.
3. Next, we would iterate through all the elements in the list. On each iteration, we would check if the current element is less than `min1`. If it is, we would update `min2` to be equal to `min1` and `min1` to be equal to the current element. If the current element is not less than `min1` but is less than `min2`, we would update `min2` to be equal to the current element.
4. After iterating through all the elements in the list, we would check if `min2` is still equal to `float('inf')`. If it is, it means there is no second smallest element in the list and we would return `None`. If `min2` is not equal to `float('inf')`, we would return `min2` as the second smallest element in the list.

Plan:
1. Check if the length of the list is less than 2. If it is, return `None`.
2. Initialize two variables `min1` and `min2` to `float('inf')`.
3. Iterate through all the elements in the list. On each iteration, check if the current element is less than `min1`. If it is, update `min2` to be equal to `min1` and `min1` to be equal to the current element. If the current element is not less than `min1` but is less than `min2`, update `min2` to be equal to the current element.
4. After iterating through all the elements in the list, check if `min2` is still equal to `float('inf')`. If it is, return `None`. If `min2` is not equal to `float('inf')`, return `min2`.

Let's implement this now.

Implementation:

```python
def next_smallest(lst):
    if len(lst) < 2:
        return None

    min1, min2 = float('inf'), float('inf')

    for num in lst:
        if num < min1:
            min2 = min1
            min1 = num
        elif min1 < num < min2:
            min2 = num

    return None if min2 == float('inf') else min2
```

This function works by maintaining two variables `min1` and `min2` to keep track of the smallest and second smallest elements in the list. It iterates over the list and updates these variables as necessary. If no second smallest element is found (i.e., `min2` is still `float('inf')` after the iteration), it returns `None`. Otherwise, it returns the second smallest element.
