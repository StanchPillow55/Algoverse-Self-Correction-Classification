==================================================

The problem is asking to return a list where each element is incremented by 1.

To solve the problem I will use the following steps
- Define a function named `incr_list` that takes in a list.
- Use list comprehension to iterate over the list and increment each element by 1.

Step 1: Define a function named `incr_list` that takes in a list.
- This function will take in a list of integers as input.

Step 2: Use list comprehension to iterate over the list and increment each element by 1.
- List comprehension is a concise way to create lists. It consists of brackets containing an expression followed by a for statement, then zero or more for or if clauses. The expressions can be anything, meaning you can put in all kinds of objects in lists.
- In this case, the expression will be `x+1` for each element `x` in the list `l`. This will create a new list where each element is the corresponding element from `l` incremented by 1.

Here is the Python code that implements these steps:

```python
def incr_list(l: list):
    """Return list with elements incremented by 1.
    >>> incr_list([1, 2, 3])
    [2, 3, 4]
    >>> incr_list([5, 3, 5, 2, 3, 3, 9, 0, 123])
    [6, 4, 6, 3, 4, 4, 10, 1, 124]
    """
    return [x+1 for x in l]
```

This function works by iterating over each element in the input list and adding 1 to it. The result is a new list where each element is the corresponding element from the input list incremented by 1.
