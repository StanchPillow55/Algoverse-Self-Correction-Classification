==================================================

The problem is asking to return a tuple of the sum and product of all the integers in a list. If the list is empty, the sum should be 0 and the product should be 1.

To solve this problem, I will use Python's built-in functions sum() and reduce(). The sum() function returns the sum of all items in an iterable (like a list). The reduce() function applies a function of two arguments cumulatively to the items of an iterable, from left to right, so as to reduce the iterable to a single output. In this case, I will use it to calculate the product of all numbers in the list.

Here is the step-by-step approach:

1. Check if the list is empty. If it is, return (0, 1) as per the problem statement.
2. If the list is not empty, calculate the sum using the sum() function.
3. Calculate the product using the reduce() function with the operator.mul function as the function to apply. The operator.mul function multiplies two numbers.
4. Return the sum and product as a tuple.

Here is the Python code that implements this approach:

```python
from typing import List, Tuple
from functools import reduce
import operator

def sum_product(numbers: List[int]) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    if not numbers:
        return (0, 1)
    else:
        return (sum(numbers), reduce(operator.mul, numbers))
```

This function works for any list of integers, including an empty list. It uses built-in Python functions and the functools and operator modules, which are part of the Python Standard Library.
