==================================================

Reasoning:

Given a list of integers, we are to determine a list of integers that do not contain any duplicates. We can obtain a solution for this by performing the following steps: 

- Initialize an empty list to keep track of the unique elements in the list
- Iterate through all the elements in the list
- On each iteration, we would check if the current element in the list exists in the list of unique elements. If it does not exist, we would add it to the list of unique elements
- Finally we would return the list of unique elements

By doing this, we would be able to maintain the order of the elements in the list and also remove any duplicates from the list.

Let's implement this now.

Implementation:

```python
from typing import List

def remove_duplicates(numbers: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    unique_numbers = []
    for number in numbers:
        if number not in unique_numbers:
            unique_numbers.append(number)
    return unique_numbers
```

This function works by iterating over the input list and adding each number to the `unique_numbers` list if it's not already there. This ensures that each number only appears once in the `unique_numbers` list, and that the order of numbers is preserved from the input list. The `unique_numbers` list is then returned as the result.
