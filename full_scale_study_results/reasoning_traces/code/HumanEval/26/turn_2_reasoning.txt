==================================================

Reasoning:

Given a list of integers, we are to determine a list of integers that do not have any duplicates. We can obtain a solution for this by performing the following steps: 

1. Initialize an empty list `result` to keep track of the unique elements in the list
2. Iterate through all the elements in the list
3. On each iteration, check if the current element is in the `result` list
4. If it is not, append it to the `result` list
5. If it is, continue to the next iteration
6. After iterating through all the elements, return the `result` list

This approach ensures that we maintain the order of the elements in the list, as we are iterating through the list in order and only appending an element to the `result` list the first time we encounter it.

Let's implement this now.

Implementation:

from typing import List

def remove_duplicates(numbers: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    result = []
    for num in numbers:
        if num not in result:
            result.append(num)
    return result

This function works by iterating through the list of numbers and adding each number to the `result` list only if it is not already in the `result` list. This ensures that all duplicates are removed, while the order of the remaining elements is preserved.
