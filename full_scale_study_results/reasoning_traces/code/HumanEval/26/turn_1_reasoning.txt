Turn: 1
Dataset Type: code
==================================================

Reasoning:

Given a list of integers, we are to determine the elements in the list that occur more than once. We can obtain a solution for this by performing the following steps:
1. Initialize a new list to keep track of the unique elements in the list
2. Iterate through all the elements in the list
3. On each iteration, check if the current element exists in the list of unique elements. If it does not exist, add it to the list of unique elements. If it does exist, remove it from the list of unique elements
4. At the end of the iteration, the list of unique elements would contain all the elements in the list that occur only once.

Let's implement this.

Implementation:

from typing import List

def remove_duplicates(numbers: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    unique_numbers = []
    for num in numbers:
        if num not in unique_numbers:
            unique_numbers.append(num)
        else:
            unique_numbers.remove(num)
    return unique_numbers

# Testing the function
print(remove_duplicates([1, 2, 3, 2, 4])) # it should print: [1, 3, 4]
