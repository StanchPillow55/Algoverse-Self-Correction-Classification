Reasoning:

The problem is asking to count the number of uppercase vowels that are at even indices in the given string. 

To solve the problem, I will use the following steps:
- Initialize a counter to 0. This will keep track of the number of uppercase vowels at even indices.
- Iterate over the string using a for loop. The loop variable will be the index of the current character.
- Check if the index is even. This can be done using the modulo operator (%). If the index % 2 is 0, then the index is even.
- If the index is even, check if the character at that index is an uppercase vowel. This can be done by checking if the character is in the string 'AEIOU'.
- If the character is an uppercase vowel, increment the counter by 1.
- After the loop, return the counter.

This approach works because it checks each character at an even index and counts it if it is an uppercase vowel. The time complexity is O(n), where n is the length of the string, because it needs to check each character once.

Now, let's implement this in code.

Implementation:

```python
def count_upper(s):
    """
    Given a string s, count the number of uppercase vowels in even indices.
    """
    counter = 0
    for i in range(len(s)):
        if i % 2 == 0 and s[i] in 'AEIOU':
            counter += 1
    return counter
```

This function works as described in the reasoning. It initializes a counter to 0, then iterates over the string. If the index is even and the character is an uppercase vowel, it increments the counter. Finally, it returns the counter.
