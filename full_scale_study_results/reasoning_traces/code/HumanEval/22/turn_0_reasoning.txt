Dataset Type: code
==================================================

Reasoning:

The problem is asking to filter out the integers from a given list of any Python values. 

To solve this problem, I will use Python's built-in function isinstance() which checks if an object (first argument) is an instance or subclass of classinfo class (second argument). This function is used to check the type of an object.

I will iterate over the list and for each element, I will check if it is an instance of the int class. If it is, I will add it to a new list. At the end, I will return this new list.

Implementation:

Here is the Python function that implements the above approach:

```python
from typing import List, Any

def filter_integers(values: List[Any]) -> List[int]:
    """ Filter given list of any python values only for integers """
    return [value for value in values if isinstance(value, int)]
```

This function uses list comprehension to create a new list that contains only the elements of the input list that are integers. The isinstance() function is used to check if each element is an integer. If it is, it is included in the new list. If it is not, it is skipped. 

This function assumes that the input is a list of any Python values. If the input is not a list, or if it contains elements that are not Python values, the function may not work correctly.
