Dataset Type: code
==================================================

Reasoning:

Given an array of integers, we are to determine the sum of the magnitudes of the integers multiplied by the product of all signs of each number in the array. 

We can obtain a solution for this by performing the following steps:
- Initialize a variable `prod` to keep track of the product of the signs of the integers in the array and a variable `sum` to keep track of the sum of the magnitudes of the integers in the array
- Iterate through all the integers in the array. On each iteration, we would update the `prod` variable by multiplying it with the sign of the integer and update the `sum` variable by adding the absolute value of the integer to it
- Finally we would return the product of the `prod` and `sum` variable

Implementation:

Now we would implement the steps in python: 

```python
def prod_signs(arr):
    # check if array is empty
    if len(arr) == 0:
        return None

    # initialize variables
    prod = 1
    sum = 0

    # iterate through all the integers in the array
    for num in arr:
        # update the prod variable by multiplying it with the sign of the integer
        if num < 0:
            prod *= -1
        elif num > 0:
            prod *= 1
        else:
            prod *= 0

        # update the sum variable by adding the absolute value of the integer to it
        sum += abs(num)

    # return the product of the prod and sum variable
    return prod * sum
```

The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the number of integers in the array. This is because we are iterating through each integer in the array exactly once. The space complexity is O(1), as we are using a constant amount of space to store our variables, regardless of the size of the input array.
