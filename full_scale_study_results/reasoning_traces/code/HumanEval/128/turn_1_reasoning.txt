Question ID: HumanEval/128
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: code
==================================================

Reasoning:

The problem is asking to return the sum of the absolute values of the integers in the array multiplied by the product of the signs of each number in the array. The sign of a number is represented by 1 if the number is positive, -1 if the number is negative, and 0 if the number is zero. 

The steps to solve this problem are:

1. Check if the array is empty. If it is, return None.
2. Initialize a variable to hold the product of the signs. Since we are multiplying, we start with 1.
3. Initialize a variable to hold the sum of the absolute values. Since we are adding, we start with 0.
4. Iterate over the array. For each number:
   - If the number is negative, multiply the product of the signs by -1 and add the absolute value of the number to the sum of the absolute values.
   - If the number is positive, add the absolute value of the number to the sum of the absolute values.
   - If the number is zero, set the product of the signs to 0 (since anything multiplied by zero is zero) and continue to the next number.
5. Multiply the sum of the absolute values by the product of the signs and return the result.

Implementation:

Now I will implement the solution in Python.
