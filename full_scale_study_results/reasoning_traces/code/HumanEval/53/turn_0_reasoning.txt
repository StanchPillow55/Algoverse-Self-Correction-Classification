The problem is asking to implement a function that takes two integers as input and returns their sum. This is a simple problem and can be solved by using the '+' operator in Python which is used for addition of numbers.

Here is the step by step reasoning:

1. Define a function named 'add' which takes two parameters, 'x' and 'y'. Both 'x' and 'y' are integers as specified in the problem statement.

2. Inside the function, use the '+' operator to add 'x' and 'y'. Store the result in a variable, say 'sum'.

3. Return 'sum' from the function.

Here is the Python code that implements the above steps:

```python
def add(x: int, y: int) -> int:
    """Add two numbers x and y
    >>> add(2, 3)
    5
    >>> add(5, 7)
    12
    """
    # Step 2: Add 'x' and 'y' using '+' operator and store the result in 'sum'
    sum = x + y
    
    # Step 3: Return 'sum'
    return sum
```

This function will now return the sum of two integers 'x' and 'y'. For example, add(2, 3) will return 5 and add(5, 7) will return 12.
