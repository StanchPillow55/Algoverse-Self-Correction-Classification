To solve the problem of counting the number of "boredoms" in a given string, we need to identify sentences that start with the word "I". Sentences are delimited by '.', '?', or '!'. Let's break down the problem and devise a solution step-by-step.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Understanding the Input and Output:**
   - Input: A string `S` containing sentences.
   - Output: An integer representing the number of sentences that start with the word "I".

2. **Identify Sentence Delimiters:**
   - Sentences in the string are separated by '.', '?', or '!'. These characters act as delimiters.

3. **Splitting the String into Sentences:**
   - We can split the string into individual sentences using these delimiters. However, using `str.split()` directly on each delimiter might be cumbersome. Instead, we can use regular expressions to split the string on any of these delimiters.

4. **Trimming and Checking Each Sentence:**
   - After splitting, each sentence might have leading or trailing whitespace. We should trim these whitespaces.
   - Check if the trimmed sentence starts with the word "I". This can be done using `str.startswith("I")`.

5. **Counting the "Boredoms":**
   - Initialize a counter to zero.
   - For each sentence, if it starts with "I", increment the counter.

6. **Return the Count:**
   - Finally, return the count of sentences that start with "I".

### Implementation

Let's implement the function `is_bored` based on the above reasoning:

```python
import re

def is_bored(S):
    """
    You'll be given a string of words, and your task is to count the number
    of boredoms. A boredom is a sentence that starts with the word "I".
    Sentences are delimited by '.', '?' or '!'.
   
    For example:
    >>> is_bored("Hello world")
    0
    >>> is_bored("The sky is blue. The sun is shining. I love this weather")
    1
    """
    # Use regular expression to split the string by '.', '?', or '!'
    sentences = re.split(r'[.?!]', S)
    
    # Initialize boredom count
    boredom_count = 0
    
    # Iterate over each sentence
    for sentence in sentences:
        # Strip leading and trailing whitespace
        trimmed_sentence = sentence.strip()
        
        # Check if the sentence starts with "I"
        if trimmed_sentence.startswith("I"):
            boredom_count += 1
    
    return boredom_count

# Example usage
print(is_bored("Hello world"))  # Output: 0
print(is_bored("The sky is blue. The sun is shining. I love this weather"))  # Output: 1
```

### Explanation of the Code

- We use `re.split(r'[.?!]', S)` to split the input string `S` into sentences based on the delimiters '.', '?', and '!'.
- We initialize a counter `boredom_count` to zero.
- For each sentence obtained from the split, we strip any leading or trailing whitespace using `strip()`.
- We then check if the trimmed sentence starts with "I" using `startswith("I")`. If it does, we increment the `boredom_count`.
- Finally, we return the `boredom_count` which gives the number of sentences starting with "I".
