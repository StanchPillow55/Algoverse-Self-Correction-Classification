To solve the problem of counting the number of "boredoms" in a given string, we need to break down the task into a series of logical steps. Here's how we can approach this:

### Step-by-Step Approach:

1. **Understand the Input and Output:**
   - Input: A string `S` containing multiple sentences. Sentences are delimited by '.', '?', or '!'.
   - Output: An integer representing the number of sentences that start with the word "I".

2. **Identify Sentences:**
   - We need to split the string into individual sentences. Sentences are separated by '.', '?', or '!'. We can use Python's `re.split()` function to split the string based on these delimiters.

3. **Trim and Check Each Sentence:**
   - After splitting the string into sentences, each sentence might have leading or trailing spaces. We should trim these spaces using the `strip()` method.
   - Check if the trimmed sentence starts with the word "I". This can be done using the `startswith()` method.

4. **Count the Boredoms:**
   - Initialize a counter to zero.
   - Iterate over each sentence, and if it starts with "I", increment the counter.

5. **Return the Count:**
   - Finally, return the counter which represents the number of boredoms.

### Implementation:

Now, let's implement the solution based on the above steps:

```python
import re

def is_bored(S):
    """
    You'll be given a string of words, and your task is to count the number
    of boredoms. A boredom is a sentence that starts with the word "I".
    Sentences are delimited by '.', '?' or '!'.
   
    For example:
    >>> is_bored("Hello world")
    0
    >>> is_bored("The sky is blue. The sun is shining. I love this weather")
    1
    """
    # Split the string into sentences using regex
    sentences = re.split(r'[.?!]', S)
    
    # Initialize the boredom counter
    boredom_count = 0
    
    # Iterate over each sentence
    for sentence in sentences:
        # Trim leading and trailing spaces
        trimmed_sentence = sentence.strip()
        
        # Check if the sentence starts with "I"
        if trimmed_sentence.startswith("I"):
            boredom_count += 1
    
    return boredom_count

# Test cases
print(is_bored("Hello world"))  # Output: 0
print(is_bored("The sky is blue. The sun is shining. I love this weather"))  # Output: 1
```

### Explanation:

- **Regex Split:** We use `re.split(r'[.?!]', S)` to split the string into sentences based on the delimiters '.', '?', and '!'.
- **Trimming:** We use `strip()` to remove any leading or trailing spaces from each sentence.
- **Counting:** We check if each trimmed sentence starts with "I" using `startswith("I")` and increment the counter accordingly.
- **Return:** Finally, we return the count of sentences that start with "I".

This solution efficiently counts the number of sentences starting with "I" and handles various sentence delimiters.
