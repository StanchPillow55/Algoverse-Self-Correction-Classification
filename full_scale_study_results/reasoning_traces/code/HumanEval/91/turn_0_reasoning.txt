==================================================

The problem is asking to return the number of sentences that start with the word "I". A sentence is defined as a string of words that ends with either '.', '?' or '!'. 

To solve this problem, I will follow these steps:

1. Split the input string into sentences. This can be done by replacing all punctuation marks ('.', '!', '?') with a specific character (for example, '.'). Then, the string can be split by this character to get a list of sentences.

2. Iterate over the list of sentences. For each sentence, split it into words and check if the first word is "I". If it is, increment a counter.

3. Return the counter.

Now, let's implement this in code:

```python
def is_bored(S):
    # Step 1: Split the string into sentences
    S = S.replace('!', '.').replace('?', '.')
    sentences = S.split('.')
    
    # Initialize the counter
    boredoms = 0
    
    # Step 2: Iterate over the sentences
    for sentence in sentences:
        words = sentence.split()
        if words and words[0] == "I":
            # If the first word is "I", increment the counter
            boredoms += 1
            
    # Step 3: Return the counter
    return boredoms
```

This function should work for any string of words. It assumes that the input string is well-formed, i.e., sentences are properly delimited by punctuation marks and words are separated by spaces. It also assumes that the word "I" is always capitalized. If these assumptions are not met, the function may not work correctly.
