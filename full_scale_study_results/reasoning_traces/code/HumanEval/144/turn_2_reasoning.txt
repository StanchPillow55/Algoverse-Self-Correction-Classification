==================================================

Reasoning:

Given two fractions x and n, we are to determine if the multiplication of the two fractions results in a whole number. We can obtain a solution for this by performing the following steps:

1. Split the fractions into their numerator and denominator parts.
2. Convert the numerators and denominators to integers.
3. Multiply the numerators together to get the numerator of the result.
4. Multiply the denominators together to get the denominator of the result.
5. Check if the numerator of the result is divisible by the denominator of the result. If it is, then the result is a whole number, so return True. Otherwise, return False.

Implementation:

Now, let's implement the steps in Python. We'll use the built-in `split` function to split the fractions into numerators and denominators, and the `int` function to convert the numerators and denominators to integers. We'll use the `*` operator to multiply the numerators and denominators together, and the `%` operator to check if the numerator of the result is divisible by the denominator of the result.

Here is the Python function that implements the above steps:

```python
def simplify(x, n):
    # Step 1: Split the fractions into their numerator and denominator parts.
    x_numerator, x_denominator = x.split('/')
    n_numerator, n_denominator = n.split('/')
    
    # Step 2: Convert the numerators and denominators to integers.
    x_numerator, x_denominator = int(x_numerator), int(x_denominator)
    n_numerator, n_denominator = int(n_numerator), int(n_denominator)
    
    # Step 3: Multiply the numerators together to get the numerator of the result.
    result_numerator = x_numerator * n_numerator
    
    # Step 4: Multiply the denominators together to get the denominator of the result.
    result_denominator = x_denominator * n_denominator
    
    # Step 5: Check if the numerator of the result is divisible by the denominator of the result.
    if result_numerator % result_denominator == 0:
        # If it is, then the result is a whole number, so return True.
        return True
    else:
        # Otherwise, return False.
        return False
```

This function should work for any valid fractions x and n, as long as they do not have zero as denominator.
