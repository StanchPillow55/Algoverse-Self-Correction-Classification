==================================================

Reasoning:

Given two fractions, we are to determine if the multiplication of the two fractions would result in a whole number. We can obtain a solution for this by performing the following steps:
- First, we would convert the string representation of the fraction to a float by dividing the numerator by the denominator.
- Next, we would multiply the two fractions and check if the result is a whole number. We can check if a number is a whole number by checking if the number modulo 1 is equal to 0. If it is, then it is a whole number else it is not a whole number.

Implementation:

We would implement the steps in the reasoning above in python as follows:

- First, we would define a helper function `convert_to_float` that would convert the string representation of the fraction to a float.
- Next, we would define the main function `simplify` that would take in two fractions as input, convert them to floats using the `convert_to_float` function and then multiply them. It would then check if the result is a whole number and return True if it is and False if it is not. 

Let's write the code now. 

```python
def convert_to_float(fraction):
    # split the fraction into numerator and denominator
    numerator, denominator = fraction.split('/')
    # convert the numerator and denominator to integers and divide them
    return int(numerator) / int(denominator)

def simplify(x, n):
    # convert the fractions to floats
    x = convert_to_float(x)
    n = convert_to_float(n)
    # multiply the fractions and check if the result is a whole number
    result = x * n
    return result % 1 == 0
```

Let's test the function with the sample testcases

```python
print(simplify("1/5", "5/1")) # expected output: True
print(simplify("1/6", "2/1")) # expected output: False
print(simplify("7/10", "10/2")) # expected output: False
```

The function passes all the sample testcases.
