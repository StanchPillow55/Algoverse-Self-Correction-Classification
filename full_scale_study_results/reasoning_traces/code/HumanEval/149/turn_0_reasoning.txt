Reasoning:

Given a list of strings, we are to determine the strings that have even lengths and sort them in ascending order. If two strings have the same length, we are to sort them alphabetically. We can obtain a solution for this by performing the following steps:

1. Initialize a new list to store the strings with even lengths
2. Iterate through all the strings in the given list
3. On each iteration, check if the length of the string is even. If it is, add it to the new list
4. After iterating through all the strings, sort the new list in ascending order by length. If two strings have the same length, sort them alphabetically
5. Return the sorted list

Implementation:

Now we can implement this in Python. We'll use the built-in `filter` function to filter out the strings with odd lengths, and the `sorted` function to sort the list. We'll pass a custom sorting function to `sorted` that sorts by length first, and then alphabetically if the lengths are the same.

Here is the Python function that implements the above approach:

```python
def sorted_list_sum(lst):
    # Filter out strings with odd lengths
    even_strings = list(filter(lambda x: len(x) % 2 == 0, lst))
    
    # Sort the list by length, then alphabetically
    sorted_list = sorted(even_strings, key=lambda x: (len(x), x))
    
    return sorted_list
```

This function works by first filtering out the strings with odd lengths using the `filter` function. The `filter` function takes a function and a list as arguments, and returns a new list that contains only the elements of the original list for which the function returns `True`. In this case, the function is a lambda function that checks if the length of a string is even.

After filtering out the strings with odd lengths, the function sorts the remaining strings using the `sorted` function. The `sorted` function takes a list and a key function as arguments, and returns a new list that contains the elements of the original list sorted according to the key function. In this case, the key function is a lambda function that returns a tuple containing the length of a string and the string itself. This causes the `sorted` function to sort the strings by length first, and then alphabetically if the lengths are the same.

Finally, the function returns the sorted list.
