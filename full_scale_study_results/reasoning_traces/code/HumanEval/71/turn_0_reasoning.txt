The problem is asking to return the area of a triangle given the lengths of its three sides. The area should be rounded to 2 decimal points. If the three sides do not form a valid triangle, the function should return -1.

A valid triangle is one where the sum of the lengths of any two sides is greater than the length of the third side. This is known as the triangle inequality theorem.

The area of a triangle with sides of lengths a, b, and c can be calculated using Heron's formula:

Area = sqrt[s(s - a)(s - b)(s - c)]

where s is the semi-perimeter of the triangle, calculated as:

s = (a + b + c) / 2

Here are the steps we'll take to solve this problem:

1. Check if the input lengths form a valid triangle. If not, return -1.
2. Calculate the semi-perimeter of the triangle.
3. Use Heron's formula to calculate the area of the triangle.
4. Round the area to 2 decimal points and return it.

Let's implement this in Python:

```python
import math

def triangle_area(a, b, c):
    # Check if the input lengths form a valid triangle
    if a + b <= c or a + c <= b or b + c <= a:
        return -1

    # Calculate the semi-perimeter
    s = (a + b + c) / 2

    # Use Heron's formula to calculate the area
    area = math.sqrt(s * (s - a) * (s - b) * (s - c))

    # Round the area to 2 decimal points and return it
    return round(area, 2)
```

This function first checks if the input lengths form a valid triangle. If they don't, it returns -1. If they do, it calculates the semi-perimeter and then uses Heron's formula to calculate the area. Finally, it rounds the area to 2 decimal points and returns it.
