==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. First, we need to check if the given sides can form a valid triangle. According to the triangle inequality theorem, a triangle is valid if the sum of the lengths of any two sides is greater than the length of the third side. So, we need to check if a + b > c, a + c > b, and b + c > a. If any of these conditions is not met, we return -1.

2. If the triangle is valid, we can calculate its area using Heron's formula. Heron's formula allows us to compute the area of a triangle if we know the lengths of all three sides. The formula is:

   Area = sqrt[s(s - a)(s - b)(s - c)]

   where s is the semi-perimeter of the triangle, calculated as (a + b + c) / 2.

3. Finally, we need to round the area to 2 decimal points using the round() function.

Let's implement this in Python:

```python
def triangle_area(a, b, c):
    # Check if the sides form a valid triangle
    if a + b > c and a + c > b and b + c > a:
        # Calculate the semi-perimeter
        s = (a + b + c) / 2
        # Calculate the area using Heron's formula
        area = (s * (s - a) * (s - b) * (s - c)) ** 0.5
        # Round the area to 2 decimal points and return it
        return round(area, 2)
    else:
        # The sides do not form a valid triangle
        return -1
```

This function first checks if the given sides can form a valid triangle. If they can, it calculates the semi-perimeter and then uses it to compute the area of the triangle using Heron's formula. The area is then rounded to 2 decimal points and returned. If the sides cannot form a valid triangle, the function returns -1.
