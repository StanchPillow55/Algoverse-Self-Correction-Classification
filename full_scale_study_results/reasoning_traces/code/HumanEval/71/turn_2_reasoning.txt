To solve the problem of calculating the area of a triangle given its three sides, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Check if the sides form a valid triangle**: 
   - A set of three sides can form a triangle if the sum of any two sides is greater than the third side. This is known as the triangle inequality theorem. Specifically, for sides `a`, `b`, and `c`, the conditions are:
     - \(a + b > c\)
     - \(a + c > b\)
     - \(b + c > a\)
   - If any of these conditions are not met, the sides do not form a valid triangle, and we should return `-1`.

2. **Calculate the area using Heron's formula**:
   - If the sides form a valid triangle, we can use Heron's formula to calculate the area. Heron's formula states that the area \(A\) of a triangle with sides \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) is:
     \[
     s = \frac{a + b + c}{2}
     \]
     \[
     A = \sqrt{s \times (s - a) \times (s - b) \times (s - c)}
     \]
   - Here, \(s\) is the semi-perimeter of the triangle.

3. **Round the result**:
   - The problem specifies that the area should be rounded to 2 decimal places. We can use Python's built-in `round()` function for this.

4. **Return the result**:
   - If the triangle is valid, return the rounded area. Otherwise, return `-1`.

Now, let's implement the function `triangle_area` following the above steps:

```python
import math

def triangle_area(a, b, c):
    # Check if the sides form a valid triangle
    if a + b <= c or a + c <= b or b + c <= a:
        return -1
    
    # Calculate the semi-perimeter
    s = (a + b + c) / 2
    
    # Calculate the area using Heron's formula
    area = math.sqrt(s * (s - a) * (s - b) * (s - c))
    
    # Round the area to 2 decimal places
    return round(area, 2)

# Example usage:
# print(triangle_area(3, 4, 5))  # Should return 6.00
# print(triangle_area(1, 2, 10)) # Should return -1
```

This function first checks if the sides form a valid triangle using the triangle inequality theorem. If they do, it calculates the area using Heron's formula and returns the area rounded to two decimal places. If not, it returns `-1`.
