Reasoning:

Given two variables, we are to determine the larger variable in its given variable type. We can obtain a solution for this by performing the following steps:
1. Check if the variables are of the same type. If they are not, convert them to the same type. If a variable is a string, we would check if it contains a comma. If it does, we would replace the comma with a period and convert the string to a float. If it does not contain a comma, we would convert the string to an integer.
2. After converting the variables to the same type, we would compare the two variables. If they are equal, we would return None. If they are not equal, we would return the larger variable.

Implementation:

We would implement this in python by creating a function `compare_one` that takes in two parameters `a` and `b`. We would then perform the steps outlined in the reasoning above. 

Here is the python function to solve the problem: 

```python
def compare_one(a, b):
    # check if a is a string
    if type(a) == str:
        # check if a contains a comma
        if ',' in a:
            # replace comma with period and convert to float
            a = float(a.replace(',', '.'))
        else:
            # convert a to int
            a = int(a)
    # check if b is a string
    if type(b) == str:
        # check if b contains a comma
        if ',' in b:
            # replace comma with period and convert to float
            b = float(b.replace(',', '.'))
        else:
            # convert b to int
            b = int(b)
    # compare a and b
    if a == b:
        return None
    elif a > b:
        return a
    else:
        return b
```

This function works by first checking if the variables `a` and `b` are strings. If they are, it checks if they contain a comma. If they do, it replaces the comma with a period and converts the string to a float. If they do not contain a comma, it converts the string to an integer. After converting the variables to the same type, it compares the two variables. If they are equal, it returns None. If they are not equal, it returns the larger variable.
