Reasoning:

The problem is asking to return True if the given list is either monotonically increasing or decreasing. 

A sequence is said to be monotonically increasing if each term is greater than or equal to the one before it. If each term is strictly greater than the one before it, the sequence is called strictly increasing. 

Similarly, a sequence is said to be monotonically decreasing if each term is less than or equal to the one before it. If each term is strictly less than the one before it, the sequence is called strictly decreasing.

To solve the problem I will use the following steps
- First, I will check if the list is empty or contains only one element. If it does, I will return True because a list with one or no elements is considered monotonically increasing or decreasing.
- Then, I will check if the list is monotonically increasing or decreasing.
- To check if the list is monotonically increasing, I will compare each element with the next one. If the current element is greater than the next one, then the list is not monotonically increasing.
- To check if the list is monotonically decreasing, I will compare each element with the next one. If the current element is less than the next one, then the list is not monotonically decreasing.
- If the list is neither monotonically increasing nor decreasing, I will return False. Otherwise, I will return True.

Now I will implement this in code.

Implementation:

```python
def monotonic(l: list):
    if len(l) < 2:
        return True
    if all(l[i] <= l[i + 1] for i in range(len(l) - 1)):
        return True
    if all(l[i] >= l[i + 1] for i in range(len(l) - 1)):
        return True
    return False
```

This function works by first checking if the list has less than 2 elements. If it does, it returns True. Then it checks if the list is monotonically increasing by using the all() function and a generator expression that checks if each element is less than or equal to the next one. If all elements satisfy this condition, it returns True. If not, it checks if the list is monotonically decreasing by using the all() function and a generator expression that checks if each element is greater than or equal to the next one. If all elements satisfy this condition, it returns True. If the list is neither monotonically increasing nor decreasing, it returns False.
