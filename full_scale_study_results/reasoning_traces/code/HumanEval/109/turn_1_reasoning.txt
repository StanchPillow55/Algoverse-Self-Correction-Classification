Reasoning:

The problem is asking to determine if it is possible to get an array sorted in non-decreasing order by performing right shift operation any number of times. 

A right shift operation means shifting all elements of the array by one position in the right direction. The last element of the array will be moved to the starting position in the array i.e. 0th index.

If it is possible to obtain the sorted array by performing the above operation then return True else return False. If the given array is empty then return True.

The first step is to check if the array is empty. If it is, we return True as per the problem statement.

Next, we need to check if the array can be sorted by right shifting. To do this, we can check if the array is a rotation of a sorted array. 

A rotation of a sorted array will have a pattern where all elements are in increasing order except for one "drop" where the last element is less than the first. This "drop" represents the point where the array was rotated.

To find this "drop", we can iterate through the array and check if each element is less than the previous one. If we find more than one such "drop", we return False as the array cannot be sorted by right shifting. If we find exactly one "drop", we return True.

Approach:

1. Check if the array is empty. If it is, return True.
2. Initialize a variable 'drops' to 0. This will keep track of the number of "drops" in the array.
3. Iterate through the array. For each element, check if it is less than the previous one. If it is, increment 'drops'.
4. After the loop, check the value of 'drops'. If it is more than 1, return False. If it is 1 or 0, return True.

Let's implement this now.

Implementation: 

```python
def move_one_ball(arr):
    if len(arr) == 0:
        return True
    drops = 0
    for i in range(1, len(arr)):
        if arr[i] < arr[i-1]:
            drops += 1
    return drops <= 1
```

This function works by first checking if the array is empty. If it is, it returns True. Then it initializes a variable 'drops' to 0. This variable will keep track of the number of "drops" in the array. 

The function then enters a loop that iterates through the array. For each element, it checks if it is less than the previous one. If it is, it increments 'drops'. 

After the loop, the function checks the value of 'drops'. If 'drops' is more than 1, it returns False. If 'drops' is 1 or 0, it returns True. This is because a sorted array can have at most one "drop", which represents the point where the array was rotated. 

This function should correctly determine whether the given array can be sorted by right shifting.
