The problem is asking to determine if it is possible to sort an array in non-decreasing order by performing right shift operations. A right shift operation is defined as moving all elements of the array one position to the right, with the last element moving to the first position.

To solve this problem, we can use the following approach:

1. First, we need to check if the array is already sorted in non-decreasing order. If it is, we return True because no operation is needed.

2. If the array is not sorted, we need to find the number of times the next number is smaller than the current number. This is because a right shift operation can only fix the situation where a larger number is followed by a smaller number by moving the larger number to the beginning of the array.

3. If the number of times the next number is smaller than the current number is more than 1, it means we have more than one larger number followed by a smaller number. In this case, it is impossible to sort the array by right shift operations, so we return False.

4. If the number of times the next number is smaller than the current number is exactly 1, it means we have exactly one larger number followed by a smaller number. In this case, we can sort the array by performing right shift operations, so we return True.

5. If the array is empty, we return True because an empty array is considered sorted.

Now, let's implement this approach in Python:

```python
def move_one_ball(arr):
    # If the array is empty, return True
    if not arr:
        return True

    # Initialize the count of times the next number is smaller than the current number
    count = 0

    # Iterate over the array
    for i in range(len(arr) - 1):
        # If the next number is smaller than the current number
        if arr[i] > arr[i + 1]:
            # Increment the count
            count += 1

    # If the first number is smaller than the last number
    if arr[0] < arr[-1]:
        # Increment the count
        count += 1

    # If the count is more than 1, return False
    # If the count is exactly 1 or 0, return True
    return count <= 1
```

This function works by counting the number of times the next number is smaller than the current number. If this count is more than 1, it returns False. If this count is exactly 1 or 0, it returns True. If the array is empty, it returns True.
