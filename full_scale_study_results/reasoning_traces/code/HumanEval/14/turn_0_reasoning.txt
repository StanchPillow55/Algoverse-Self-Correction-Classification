Reasoning:

The problem is asking to return a list of all prefixes of the input string. A prefix of a string is any leading contiguous part of the string. For example, the prefixes of the string "abc" are "a", "ab", and "abc".

To solve this problem, we can use Python's list comprehension feature. We can iterate over the range from 1 to the length of the string (inclusive), and for each iteration, we slice the string from the beginning to the current index. This will give us all the prefixes of the string.

Here is the step-by-step approach:

1. Initialize an empty list to store the prefixes.
2. Iterate over the range from 1 to the length of the string (inclusive).
3. For each iteration, slice the string from the beginning to the current index.
4. Append the sliced string to the list of prefixes.
5. After the loop, return the list of prefixes.

Let's implement this in code.

Implementation:

```python
from typing import List

def all_prefixes(string: str) -> List[str]:
    """ Return list of all prefixes from shortest to longest of the input string
    >>> all_prefixes('abc')
    ['a', 'ab', 'abc']
    """
    return [string[:i] for i in range(1, len(string) + 1)]
```

In this function, we use a list comprehension to generate the list of prefixes. The expression `string[:i]` slices the string from the beginning to the index `i`, and `for i in range(1, len(string) + 1)` iterates over the range from 1 to the length of the string (inclusive). The result is a list of all prefixes of the input string.
