==================================================

The problem is asking to implement a function that decodes a string that was encoded using the `encode_shift` function. The `encode_shift` function works by shifting each character in the input string 5 places to the right in the alphabet. For example, if the input string is "abc", the output will be "fgh". 

To decode the string, we need to reverse the process, which means shifting each character in the input string 5 places to the left in the alphabet. 

The `ord` function in Python returns the Unicode code point of a character, and the `chr` function returns the character that represents the specified Unicode. The `ord` function can be used to convert a character to its corresponding ASCII value, and the `chr` function can be used to convert an ASCII value back to its corresponding character.

The `ord("a")` is subtracted to normalize the ASCII value of the character to the range 0-25 (a-z), then the shift is applied. The `% 26` operation is used to ensure that the result wraps around in the range 0-25. Finally, `ord("a")` is added back to convert the normalized value back to an ASCII value.

In the `decode_shift` function, instead of adding 5 to the ASCII value of the character, we subtract 5. This will shift the character 5 places to the left in the alphabet.

Here is the implementation of the `decode_shift` function:

```python
def decode_shift(s: str):
    """
    takes as input string encoded with encode_shift function. Returns decoded string.
    """
    return "".join([chr(((ord(ch) - 5 - ord("a")) % 26) + ord("a")) for ch in s])
```

This function works by iterating over each character in the input string, converting it to its ASCII value, subtracting 5 and the ASCII value of "a", taking the modulus 26 to ensure the result is in the range 0-25, adding the ASCII value of "a" back, and converting the result back to a character. The resulting characters are joined together to form the decoded string.
