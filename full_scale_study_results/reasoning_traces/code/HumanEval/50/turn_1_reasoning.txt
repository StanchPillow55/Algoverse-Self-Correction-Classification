==================================================

The problem is asking to implement a function that decodes a string that was encoded by shifting every character by 5 in the alphabet. 

The encode_shift function works by converting each character in the string to its ASCII value using the ord() function, adding 5 to it, subtracting the ASCII value of 'a', taking the modulus of 26 (the number of letters in the alphabet), and then converting it back to a character using the chr() function. 

The decode_shift function should do the opposite of the encode_shift function. It should convert each character in the string to its ASCII value, subtract 5 from it, add the ASCII value of 'a', take the modulus of 26, and then convert it back to a character. 

However, there is a caveat. If we simply subtract 5 from the ASCII value, we might end up with an ASCII value that does not correspond to a lowercase letter. To avoid this, we can add 21 (which is equivalent to subtracting 5 in the modulus 26 world) instead of subtracting 5. This will ensure that we always end up with an ASCII value that corresponds to a lowercase letter.

Here is the implementation of the decode_shift function:

```python
def decode_shift(s: str):
    """
    takes as input string encoded with encode_shift function. Returns decoded string.
    """
    return "".join([chr(((ord(ch) + 21 - ord("a")) % 26) + ord("a")) for ch in s])
```

This function works by iterating over each character in the input string, converting it to its ASCII value, adding 21, subtracting the ASCII value of 'a', taking the modulus of 26, and then converting it back to a character. The resulting characters are joined together to form the decoded string.
