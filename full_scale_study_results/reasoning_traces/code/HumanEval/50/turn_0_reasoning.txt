==================================================

The problem is asking us to implement a function that decodes a string that was encoded by shifting every character by 5 in the alphabet. This is a simple Caesar cipher, where each letter in the input string is 'shifted' a certain number of places down the alphabet. In this case, the shift is 5 places.

The encode_shift function works by converting each character in the input string to its ASCII value with the ord() function, adding 5 to it, subtracting the ASCII value of "a" to normalize it to the range 0-25, taking the modulus 26 to ensure it wraps around the alphabet if necessary, and then adding the ASCII value of "a" back to get it back into the correct ASCII range for lowercase letters. The chr() function is then used to convert this ASCII value back to a character, and the join() function is used to combine all these characters back into a single string.

The decode_shift function should do the opposite of the encode_shift function. It should subtract 5 from the ASCII value of each character instead of adding 5. However, we need to be careful with this, because if the ASCII value of the character is less than 5 plus the ASCII value of "a", then subtracting 5 will result in a number that is not a valid ASCII value for a lowercase letter. To handle this, we can add 26 (the number of letters in the alphabet) before subtracting 5, and then take the modulus 26 as before to ensure it wraps around the alphabet if necessary.

Here is the implementation of the decode_shift function:

```python
def decode_shift(s: str):
    """
    takes as input string encoded with encode_shift function. Returns decoded string.
    """
    return "".join([chr(((ord(ch) - 5 - ord("a") + 26) % 26) + ord("a")) for ch in s])
```

This function works by converting each character in the input string to its ASCII value with the ord() function, subtracting 5 from it, subtracting the ASCII value of "a" to normalize it to the range 0-25, adding 26 to ensure it doesn't go below the valid ASCII range for lowercase letters, taking the modulus 26 to ensure it wraps around the alphabet if necessary, and then adding the ASCII value of "a" back to get it back into the correct ASCII range for lowercase letters. The chr() function is then used to convert this ASCII value back to a character, and the join() function is used to combine all these characters back into a single string.
