Reasoning:

The problem is asking to replace all spaces in a given string with underscores. However, if there are more than two consecutive spaces, we should replace them with a single dash. 

To solve this problem, we can use Python's built-in string methods and regular expressions. 

Here is the step-by-step approach:

1. First, we need to handle the case where there are more than two consecutive spaces. We can use the `re` module's `sub` method to replace all occurrences of more than two consecutive spaces with a dash. The regular expression pattern for this is `" {3,}"`, which matches any sequence of spaces that is three or more characters long.

2. After handling the case of more than two consecutive spaces, we can replace the remaining single and double spaces with underscores. We can use the string `replace` method for this.

3. Finally, we return the modified string.

Implementation:

Now, let's implement this approach in code. We need to import the `re` module to use regular expressions. 

Here is the Python function that implements the above approach: 

```python
import re

def fix_spaces(text):
    text = re.sub(" {3,}", "-", text)
    text = text.replace(" ", "_")
    return text
```

This function first replaces all occurrences of more than two consecutive spaces with a dash, and then replaces the remaining spaces with underscores. 

Let's test this function with the provided examples to make sure it works as expected:

```python
print(fix_spaces("Example"))  # Expected output: "Example"
print(fix_spaces("Example 1"))  # Expected output: "Example_1"
print(fix_spaces(" Example 2"))  # Expected output: "_Example_2"
print(fix_spaces(" Example   3"))  # Expected output: "_Example-3"
```

This function should produce the expected output for all test cases, demonstrating that it correctly solves the problem.
