==================================================

Reasoning:

The problem is asking to replace all spaces in a string with underscores. However, if there are more than two consecutive spaces, we should replace them with a single dash. 

To solve this problem, we can use Python's built-in string methods and regular expressions. 

Here is the step-by-step approach:

1. First, we need to handle the case where there are more than two consecutive spaces. We can use the `re` module's `sub` function to replace all occurrences of more than two consecutive spaces with a dash. The regular expression pattern for this is `" {3,}"`, which matches any sequence of spaces that is three or more characters long.

2. After that, we replace the remaining single and double spaces with underscores using the `str.replace` method.

Implementation:

Now, let's implement this in code. We'll need to import the `re` module to use regular expressions. 

Here is the complete function definition: 

```python
import re

def fix_spaces(text):
    # Replace more than two consecutive spaces with a dash
    text = re.sub(" {3,}", "-", text)
    # Replace the remaining single and double spaces with underscores
    text = text.replace(" ", "_")
    return text
```

This function first replaces all occurrences of more than two consecutive spaces with a dash, then replaces the remaining spaces with underscores. The `re.sub` function is used to perform the first replacement, and the `str.replace` method is used for the second replacement. 

Let's test this function with the provided examples to verify that it works as expected:

```python
print(fix_spaces("Example"))  # Should print: "Example"
print(fix_spaces("Example 1"))  # Should print: "Example_1"
print(fix_spaces(" Example 2"))  # Should print: "_Example_2"
print(fix_spaces(" Example   3"))  # Should print: "_Example-3"
```

This function should correctly solve the problem according to the provided specifications.
