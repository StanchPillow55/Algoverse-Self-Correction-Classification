Reasoning:

The problem is asking to replace all spaces in a given string with underscores, and if a string has more than 2 consecutive spaces, then replace all consecutive spaces with a single dash.

To solve this problem, I will use the Python built-in re (regular expressions) module. 

The re module offers a set of functions that allows us to search a string for a match:

- The re.sub() function in the re module can be used to replace substrings. The syntax of re.sub() is: re.sub(pattern, replace, string).

- The pattern is the regular expression, the replace is the text that will replace the matches, and the string is where to search for matches.

- The regular expression "\s{2,}" will match any whitespace character that appears 2 or more times.

- The regular expression "\s" will match any whitespace character.

So, the approach will be:

1. First, replace all occurrences of 2 or more consecutive spaces with a dash using the re.sub() function.

2. Then, replace the remaining single spaces with underscores using the re.sub() function again.

This approach will ensure that we first handle the case of multiple spaces before dealing with single spaces.

Implementation:

Here is the Python function that implements the above approach:

```python
import re

def fix_spaces(text):
    text = re.sub("\s{2,}", "-", text)
    text = re.sub("\s", "_", text)
    return text
```

This function first replaces all occurrences of 2 or more consecutive spaces with a dash, and then replaces the remaining single spaces with underscores. The modified string is then returned.
