==================================================

Reasoning:

Given a list of integers, we are to determine the sum of all entries in the list. We can obtain a solution for this by performing the following steps:
1. Initialize a variable `total` to keep track of the sum of all entries in the list
2. Iterate through all the elements in the list. On each iteration, we would check if the index of the current element is a multiple of 3 or 4. If the index of the current element is a multiple of 3, we would square the current element and add it to the `total` variable. If the index of the current element is a multiple of 4 and not a multiple of 3, we would cube the current element and add it to the `total` variable. If the index of the current element is not a multiple of 3 or 4, we would add the current element to the `total` variable
3. After iterating through all the elements in the list, we would output the `total` variable as the sum of all entries in the list

Example
----------
Suppose we have a single test case such that the list is equal to [1,2,3]. The sum of all entries in the list would be computed as follows:
- On the first iteration, the index of the current element is 0 which is a multiple of 3. Thus we would square the current element and add it to the `total` variable. The `total` variable would be equal to 1
- On the second iteration, the index of the current element is 1 which is not a multiple of 3 or 4. Thus we would add the current element to the `total` variable. The `total` variable would be equal to 3
- On the third iteration, the index of the current element is 2 which is not a multiple of 3 or 4. Thus we would add the current element to the `total` variable. The `total` variable would be equal to 6

Thus the output would be equal to 6

Implementation
-----------------
We can implement the solution as follows: 

```python
def sum_squares(lst):
  total = 0
  for i in range(len(lst)):
    if i % 3 == 0:
      total += lst[i] ** 2
    elif i % 4 == 0:
      total += lst[i] ** 3
    else:
      total += lst[i]
  return total
```

This function works by iterating through the list and checking the index of each element. If the index is a multiple of 3, it squares the element and adds it to the total. If the index is a multiple of 4 but not 3, it cubes the element and adds it to the total. If the index is not a multiple of 3 or 4, it simply adds the element to the total. After iterating through the entire list, it returns the total.
