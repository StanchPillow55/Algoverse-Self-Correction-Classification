==================================================

First, let's understand the problem. We are given two lists of strings. We need to return the list which has the total number of characters in all its strings less than the other list. If both lists have the same total number of characters, we return the first list.

To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:

1. Initialize two variables, `count1` and `count2`, to 0. These will hold the total number of characters in `lst1` and `lst2` respectively.

2. Iterate over each string in `lst1` and add the length of the string to `count1`.

3. Repeat step 2 for `lst2`, adding the length of each string to `count2`.

4. If `count1` is less than or equal to `count2`, return `lst1`. Otherwise, return `lst2`.

Now, let's implement this in code.

```python
def total_match(lst1, lst2):
    count1 = sum(len(s) for s in lst1)
    count2 = sum(len(s) for s in lst2)
    
    if count1 <= count2:
        return lst1
    else:
        return lst2
```

This function works by using a generator expression to sum the lengths of all strings in each list. It then compares these totals and returns the appropriate list. The use of the `<=` operator ensures that `lst1` is returned when the totals are equal.
