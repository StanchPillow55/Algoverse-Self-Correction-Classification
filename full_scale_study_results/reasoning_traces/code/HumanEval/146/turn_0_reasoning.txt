Reasoning:

Given an array of numbers, we are to determine the number of elements in the array that are greater than 10 and both the first and last digits of a number are odd. We can obtain a solution for this by performing the following steps:
1. Initialize a counter variable to keep track of the number of elements that satisfy the condition.
2. Iterate through all the elements in the array.
3. For each element, check if it is greater than 10.
4. If it is, convert the number to a string (to easily access the first and last digits), and check if both the first and last digits are odd.
5. If they are, increment the counter.
6. At the end of the iteration, return the counter.

Implementation:

Now let's implement this in Python. We'll use the built-in `str` function to convert numbers to strings, and the `int` function to convert digits back to integers for the odd check. We'll also use Python's string indexing to access the first and last characters of the string representation of the number. 

Here is the Python function that implements the above approach: 

```python
def specialFilter(nums):
    count = 0
    for num in nums:
        if num > 10:
            str_num = str(num)
            if int(str_num[0]) % 2 != 0 and int(str_num[-1]) % 2 != 0:
                count += 1
    return count
```

This function works by iterating over each number in the input list. If a number is greater than 10 and both its first and last digits are odd, it increments the count. The function finally returns the count. The time complexity for this function is O(n), where n is the number of elements in the input list. This is because we are performing a constant amount of work for each element in the list.
