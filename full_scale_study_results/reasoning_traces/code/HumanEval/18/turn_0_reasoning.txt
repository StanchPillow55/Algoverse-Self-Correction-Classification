==================================================

Reasoning:

The problem is asking to return the number of times a given substring can be found in the original string. It also mentions that we need to count overlapping cases.

To solve this problem, I will use the built-in function in Python called count(). This function returns the number of times a specified value appears in the string. However, the count() function does not count overlapping substrings. 

To count overlapping substrings, I will use a loop to iterate over the string. For each character in the string, I will check if the substring starting at that character matches the given substring. If it does, I will increment a counter. 

Finally, I will return the counter, which represents the number of times the substring appears in the string, including overlaps.

Implementation:

Here is the Python function that implements the above approach. 

```python
def how_many_times(string: str, substring: str) -> int:
    count = 0
    sub_len = len(substring)
    for i in range(len(string)):
        if string[i:i+sub_len] == substring:
            count += 1
    return count
```

This function starts by initializing a counter to 0. It then enters a loop that iterates over each character in the string. For each character, it checks if the substring starting at that character matches the given substring. If it does, it increments the counter. After the loop, it returns the counter.

This function handles overlapping substrings correctly because it checks for a match at every character, not just at the characters where it has not already found a match. This means that if a substring overlaps with a previously found substring, it will still be counted.
