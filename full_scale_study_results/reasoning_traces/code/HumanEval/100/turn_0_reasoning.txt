This problem is asking to create a list of numbers where the first number is the input number and the next numbers are the next odd or even number depending on whether the input number is odd or even. The length of the list should be equal to the input number.

To solve this problem, I will use a for loop to iterate from 0 to n. For each iteration, I will add the current number to the list. The current number is calculated by adding the input number with twice the current iteration. This is because the difference between two consecutive even or odd numbers is always 2. 

For example, if the input number is 3 (which is odd), the next odd number is 3 + 2 = 5, and the next odd number after that is 5 + 2 = 7. If the input number is 4 (which is even), the next even number is 4 + 2 = 6, and the next even number after that is 6 + 2 = 8.

Here is the Python code that implements this solution:

```python
def make_a_pile(n):
    return [n + 2*i for i in range(n)]
```

This function uses list comprehension to create the list of numbers. The expression `n + 2*i` calculates the current number, and `for i in range(n)` iterates over the range from 0 to n-1. The result is a list of n numbers where the first number is n and the next numbers are the next odd or even numbers.
