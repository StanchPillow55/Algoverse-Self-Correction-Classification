==================================================

The problem is asking to return a list of strings. Each string should be "the number of odd elements in the string i of the input." where all the i's should be replaced by the number of odd digits in the i'th string of the input.

To solve the problem I will use the following steps
- Initialize an empty list to store the result
- Iterate through the given list
- For each element in the list, count the number of odd numbers in the string
- Replace all the 'i' in the string "the number of odd elements in the string i of the input." with the count of odd numbers
- Append the modified string to the result list
- Return the result list

Now I will implement this in the function.

```python
def odd_count(lst):
    result = []
    for s in lst:
        odd_count = sum(1 for c in s if int(c) % 2 != 0)
        result.append("the number of odd elements {}n the str{}ng {} of the {}nput.".format(odd_count, odd_count, odd_count, odd_count))
    return result
```

This function works by iterating over each string in the input list. For each string, it counts the number of odd digits by converting each character to an integer and checking if it is odd. It then constructs the output string by replacing all occurrences of 'i' with the count of odd digits and appends this string to the result list. Finally, it returns the result list.
