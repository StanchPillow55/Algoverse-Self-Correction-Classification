Reasoning:

Given two intervals, we are to determine if the length of the intersection of the two intervals is a prime number. We can obtain a solution for this by performing the following steps:

1. First, we would find the intersection of the two intervals. The intersection of two intervals can be found by taking the maximum of the start points and the minimum of the end points. If the start point is greater than the end point, then the intervals do not intersect.

2. Next, we would calculate the length of the intersection by subtracting the start point from the end point.

3. We would then check if the length of the intersection is a prime number. A prime number is a number that has exactly two distinct positive divisors: 1 and itself. Therefore, to check if a number is prime, we can iterate from 2 to the square root of the number and check if the number is divisible by any of these values. If it is, then it is not a prime number. If it is not, then it is a prime number.

4. Finally, we would return "YES" if the length of the intersection is a prime number and "NO" otherwise.

Let's implement this now.

Implementation:

Here is the Python function that implements the above approach: 

```python
def intersection(interval1, interval2):
    # Find the intersection of the two intervals
    start = max(interval1[0], interval2[0])
    end = min(interval1[1], interval2[1])

    # If the start point is greater than the end point, then the intervals do not intersect
    if start > end:
        return "NO"

    # Calculate the length of the intersection
    length = end - start

    # Check if the length is a prime number
    if length < 2:
        return "NO"
    for i in range(2, int(length**0.5) + 1):
        if length % i == 0:
            return "NO"

    return "YES"
```

This function works by first finding the intersection of the two intervals, then calculating the length of the intersection, and finally checking if the length is a prime number. If the length is a prime number, it returns "YES", otherwise it returns "NO". If the two intervals do not intersect, it also returns "NO".
