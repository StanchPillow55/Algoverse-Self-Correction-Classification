Dataset Type: code
==================================================

Reasoning:

Given two intervals, we are to determine if the length of the intersection of the two intervals is a prime number. We can obtain a solution for this by performing the following steps:

1. First, we would find the intersection of the two intervals. We can do this by finding the maximum of the start of the two intervals and the minimum of the end of the two intervals. This would give us the start and end of the intersection respectively.

2. Next, we would check if the length of the intersection is a prime number. We can do this by first checking if the length of the intersection is less than 2. If it is, we would return "NO" since the length of the intersection is not a prime number. If it is not, we would iterate from 2 through the square root of the length of the intersection and check if the length of the intersection is divisible by any number in that range. If it is, we would return "NO" since the length of the intersection is not a prime number. If it is not, we would return "YES" since the length of the intersection is a prime number.

3. If the start of the intersection is greater than the end of the intersection, it means that the two intervals do not intersect. In this case, we would return "NO".

Implementation:

Now we would implement the steps in the function definition.
