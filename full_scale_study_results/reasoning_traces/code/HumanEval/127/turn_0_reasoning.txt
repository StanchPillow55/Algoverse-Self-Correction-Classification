==================================================

The problem is asking to return "YES" if the length of the intersection of two given intervals is a prime number, otherwise return "NO". If the two intervals don't intersect, we should also return "NO".

To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:

1. Find the intersection of the two intervals. We can do this by taking the maximum of the two start points and the minimum of the two end points. If the start point of the intersection is greater than the end point, it means the two intervals do not intersect, so we return "NO".

2. Calculate the length of the intersection by subtracting the start point from the end point.

3. Check if the length is a prime number. A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. We can check this by iterating from 2 to the square root of the number (inclusive), and if the number is divisible by any of these values, it is not prime. If we reach the end of the loop without finding any divisors, the number is prime.

4. If the length is prime, return "YES". Otherwise, return "NO".

Now let's implement this in Python:

```python
def intersection(interval1, interval2):
    # Find the intersection of the two intervals
    start = max(interval1[0], interval2[0])
    end = min(interval1[1], interval2[1])

    # If the intervals do not intersect, return "NO"
    if start > end:
        return "NO"

    # Calculate the length of the intersection
    length = end - start

    # Check if the length is a prime number
    if length < 2:
        return "NO"
    for i in range(2, int(length**0.5) + 1):
        if length % i == 0:
            return "NO"

    # If the length is prime, return "YES"
    return "YES"
```

This function should solve the problem as expected. It first finds the intersection of the two intervals, then checks if the length of the intersection is a prime number, and returns "YES" or "NO" accordingly.
