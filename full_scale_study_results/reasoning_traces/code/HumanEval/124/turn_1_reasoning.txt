Turn: 1
Dataset Type: code
==================================================

Reasoning:

The problem is asking to validate a given date string. The date string is valid if it satisfies the following rules:

1. The date string is not empty.
2. The number of days is not less than 1 or higher than 31 days for months 1,3,5,7,8,10,12. And the number of days is not less than 1 or higher than 30 days for months 4,6,9,11. And, the number of days is not less than 1 or higher than 29 for the month 2.
3. The months should not be less than 1 or higher than 12.
4. The date should be in the format: mm-dd-yyyy

To solve the problem I will use the following steps
- First, I will check if the date string is empty or not. If it is empty return False.
- Then, I will split the date string by '-' and check if the length of the split string is 3 or not. If it is not 3 return False.
- Then, I will check if the year, month, and day are digits or not. If they are not digits return False.
- Then, I will check if the month is less than 1 or higher than 12. If it is return False.
- Then, I will check if the day is less than 1 or higher than 31 days for months 1,3,5,7,8,10,12. And the number of days is not less than 1 or higher than 30 days for months 4,6,9,11. And, the number of days is not less than 1 or higher than 29 for the month 2. If it is not return False.
- If all the above conditions are satisfied return True.

Now I will start implementing the function.

Implementation:

def valid_date(date):
    if not date:
        return False
    date_parts = date.split('-')
    if len(date_parts) != 3:
        return False
    month, day, year = date_parts
    if not (month.isdigit() and day.isdigit() and year.isdigit()):
        return False
    month, day, year = int(month), int(day), int(year)
    if month < 1 or month > 12:
        return False
    if month in [1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, 12]:
        if day < 1 or day > 31:
            return False
    elif month in [4, 6, 9, 11]:
        if day < 1 or day > 30:
            return False
    else:  # month == 2
        if day < 1 or day > 29:
            return False
    return True

The time complexity is O(1) and the space complexity is also O(1).
