Reasoning:

Given a list of strings, we are to determine the string with the maximum number of unique characters. If multiple strings have the maximum number of unique characters, we are to return the one which comes first in lexicographical order. 

We can obtain a solution for this by performing the following steps: 
- Initialize a variable `max_unique_chars` to keep track of the maximum number of unique characters and a variable `max_word` to keep track of the word with the maximum number of unique characters. 
- Next, we would iterate through all the words in the list of strings. On each iteration, we would find the number of unique characters in the current word by converting the word to a set and finding the length of the set. 
- If the number of unique characters in the current word is greater than `max_unique_chars`, we would update `max_unique_chars` and `max_word` with the number of unique characters in the current word and the current word respectively. 
- If the number of unique characters in the current word is equal to `max_unique_chars`, we would compare the current word and `max_word` lexicographically and update `max_word` with the word that comes first in lexicographical order. 
- Finally, we would return `max_word` as the word with the maximum number of unique characters.

Plan:
1. Initialize `max_unique_chars` to 0 and `max_word` to an empty string.
2. Iterate through all the words in the list of strings.
3. On each iteration, find the number of unique characters in the current word by converting the word to a set and finding the length of the set.
4. If the number of unique characters in the current word is greater than `max_unique_chars`, update `max_unique_chars` and `max_word` with the number of unique characters in the current word and the current word respectively.
5. If the number of unique characters in the current word is equal to `max_unique_chars`, compare the current word and `max_word` lexicographically and update `max_word` with the word that comes first in lexicographical order.
6. Return `max_word`.

Let's implement this now.

Implementation:

```python
def find_max(words):
    max_unique_chars = 0
    max_word = ""
    for word in words:
        unique_chars = len(set(word))
        if unique_chars > max_unique_chars:
            max_unique_chars = unique_chars
            max_word = word
        elif unique_chars == max_unique_chars:
            max_word = min(max_word, word)
    return max_word
```

This function works by iterating over each word in the input list, counting the number of unique characters in each word, and keeping track of the word with the maximum number of unique characters. If two words have the same number of unique characters, the function uses the `min` function to select the word that comes first in lexicographical order. The function returns the word with the maximum number of unique characters.
