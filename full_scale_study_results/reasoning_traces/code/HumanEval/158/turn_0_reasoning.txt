Reasoning:

Given a list of strings, we are to determine the string with the maximum number of unique characters. If multiple strings have the maximum number of unique characters, we are to return the one which comes first in lexicographical order. 

We can obtain a solution for this by performing the following steps:
1. Initialize a variable `max_unique` to keep track of the maximum number of unique characters and a variable `max_word` to keep track of the word with the maximum number of unique characters.
2. Iterate through all the words in the list. For each word, we would find the number of unique characters in the word by converting the word to a set (since sets only contain unique elements) and finding the length of the set.
3. If the number of unique characters in the current word is greater than `max_unique`, we update `max_unique` and `max_word`.
4. If the number of unique characters in the current word is equal to `max_unique`, we check if the current word comes before `max_word` in lexicographical order. If it does, we update `max_word`.
5. After iterating through all the words, `max_word` would contain the word with the maximum number of unique characters. If multiple words have the same number of unique characters, `max_word` would contain the one that comes first in lexicographical order.

Let's implement this.

Implementation:

```python
def find_max(words):
    max_unique = 0
    max_word = ""

    for word in words:
        unique_chars = len(set(word))
        if unique_chars > max_unique:
            max_unique = unique_chars
            max_word = word
        elif unique_chars == max_unique:
            if word < max_word:
                max_word = word

    return max_word
```

This function works by iterating through all the words in the list and finding the number of unique characters in each word. It keeps track of the word with the maximum number of unique characters, and if multiple words have the same number of unique characters, it keeps track of the one that comes first in lexicographical order.
