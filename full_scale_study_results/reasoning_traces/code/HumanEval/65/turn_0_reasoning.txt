Reasoning:

The problem is asking to perform a circular shift on the digits of a given integer. A circular shift is a type of shift operation where the positions of the digits are shifted to the right by a certain amount, and the digits that "fall off" the end are put back at the beginning. 

If the shift value is greater than the number of digits in the integer, we are asked to return the digits in reverse order. 

To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:

1. Convert the integer to a string to make it easier to manipulate the digits.
2. Check if the shift value is greater than the length of the string. If it is, return the reversed string.
3. If the shift value is less than or equal to the length of the string, perform the circular shift. This can be done by slicing the string at the index that corresponds to the shift value, and swapping the two halves.
4. Return the result as a string.

Implementation:

Here is the Python function that implements the above reasoning:

```python
def circular_shift(x, shift):
    # Convert the integer to a string
    x_str = str(x)
    
    # Check if the shift value is greater than the length of the string
    if shift > len(x_str):
        # If it is, return the reversed string
        return x_str[::-1]
    else:
        # If it is not, perform the circular shift
        # This is done by slicing the string at the index that corresponds to the shift value,
        # and swapping the two halves
        return x_str[-shift:] + x_str[:-shift]
```

This function works by first converting the input integer to a string. It then checks if the shift value is greater than the length of the string. If it is, it returns the reversed string. Otherwise, it performs the circular shift by slicing the string at the index that corresponds to the shift value, and swapping the two halves. The result is then returned as a string.
