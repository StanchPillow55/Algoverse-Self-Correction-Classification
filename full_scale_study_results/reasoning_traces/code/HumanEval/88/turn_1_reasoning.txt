Reasoning:

Firstly, we need to understand the problem and its requirements. The problem is asking to sort an array of non-negative integers. The sorting order depends on the sum of the first and last elements of the array. If the sum is odd, we sort in ascending order. If the sum is even, we sort in descending order. 

The problem also mentions that we should not modify the original array, which means we need to create a copy of the array before sorting it.

To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:

1. Check if the array is empty or contains only one element. If so, return the array as it is because it's already sorted.
2. Calculate the sum of the first and last elements of the array.
3. If the sum is odd, sort the array in ascending order. If the sum is even, sort the array in descending order.
4. Return the sorted array.

Now, let's implement this in Python.

Implementation:

```python
def sort_array(array):
    # If the array is empty or contains only one element, return the array as it is.
    if len(array) < 2:
        return array

    # Create a copy of the array to avoid modifying the original array.
    array_copy = array.copy()

    # Calculate the sum of the first and last elements of the array.
    sum_of_first_and_last = array_copy[0] + array_copy[-1]

    # If the sum is odd, sort the array in ascending order.
    if sum_of_first_and_last % 2 != 0:
        array_copy.sort()
    # If the sum is even, sort the array in descending order.
    else:
        array_copy.sort(reverse=True)

    # Return the sorted array.
    return array_copy
```

This function should solve the problem as expected. It first checks if the array is empty or contains only one element, and if so, it returns the array as it is. Then, it creates a copy of the array to avoid modifying the original array. After that, it calculates the sum of the first and last elements of the array. If the sum is odd, it sorts the array in ascending order. If the sum is even, it sorts the array in descending order. Finally, it returns the sorted array.
