Question ID: HumanEval/88
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: code
==================================================

Reasoning:

The problem is asking to return a sorted array based on the sum of the first and last element in the array. If the sum is odd, we need to sort the array in ascending order. If the sum is even, we need to sort the array in descending order.

Here are the steps I will follow to solve this problem:

1. First, I will check if the array is empty or contains only one element. If it is, I will return the array as it is because we can't sort an empty array or an array with only one element.

2. Then, I will calculate the sum of the first and last element in the array.

3. If the sum is odd, I will sort the array in ascending order. If the sum is even, I will sort the array in descending order.

4. Finally, I will return the sorted array.

Implementation:

Now, I will implement the solution in Python:

```python
def sort_array(array):
    # If the array is empty or contains only one element, return the array as it is
    if len(array) < 2:
        return array

    # Calculate the sum of the first and last element in the array
    sum_of_first_and_last = array[0] + array[-1]

    # If the sum is odd, sort the array in ascending order
    if sum_of_first_and_last % 2 != 0:
        return sorted(array)

    # If the sum is even, sort the array in descending order
    else:
        return sorted(array, reverse=True)
```

This function works by first checking if the array is empty or contains only one element. If it does, it returns the array as it is. Otherwise, it calculates the sum of the first and last element in the array. If the sum is odd, it sorts the array in ascending order. If the sum is even, it sorts the array in descending order. Finally, it returns the sorted array.
