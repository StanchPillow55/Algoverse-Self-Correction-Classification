The problem is asking to return a sorted copy of the given array. The sorting order is determined by the sum of the first and last elements of the array. If the sum is odd, the array should be sorted in ascending order. If the sum is even, the array should be sorted in descending order.

Here is the step by step reasoning and approach for the problem:

1. First, we need to check if the array is empty or contains only one element. In these cases, we can return the array itself as it is already sorted.

2. Next, we calculate the sum of the first and last elements of the array.

3. If the sum is odd, we sort the array in ascending order. If the sum is even, we sort the array in descending order.

4. Finally, we return the sorted array.

Now, let's implement this in Python:

```python
def sort_array(array):
    # If the array is empty or contains only one element, return the array itself
    if len(array) <= 1:
        return array

    # Calculate the sum of the first and last elements of the array
    sum_of_first_and_last = array[0] + array[-1]

    # If the sum is odd, sort the array in ascending order
    if sum_of_first_and_last % 2 != 0:
        return sorted(array)

    # If the sum is even, sort the array in descending order
    else:
        return sorted(array, reverse=True)
```

This function works by first checking the length of the array. If the array is empty or contains only one element, it returns the array itself. Otherwise, it calculates the sum of the first and last elements of the array. Depending on whether this sum is odd or even, it sorts the array in ascending or descending order, respectively. The sorted array is then returned.
