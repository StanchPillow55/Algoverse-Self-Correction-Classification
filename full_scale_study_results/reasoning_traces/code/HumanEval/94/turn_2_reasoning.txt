Turn: 2
Dataset Type: code
==================================================

Reasoning:

The problem is asking to return the sum of the digits of the largest prime number in the given list. 

To solve the problem I will use the following steps
- Initialize a variable to hold the maximum prime number, max_prime, to -1. This is because the smallest prime number is 2, so -1 will be replaced as soon as we find a prime number.
- Iterate through the list
- For each number in the list, check if it is a prime number and if it is greater than max_prime. If it is, update max_prime.
- To check if a number is prime, we can use a helper function, is_prime, that takes a number as an argument and returns True if the number is prime and False otherwise. A number is prime if it is greater than 1 and has no divisors other than 1 and itself. We can check this by trying to divide the number by all numbers from 2 to the square root of the number. If we find a divisor, the number is not prime.
- After finding the maximum prime number, calculate the sum of its digits by converting it to a string, iterating through the characters, converting each character back to an integer, and adding them up.
- Return the sum of the digits.

Now I will implement this plan into code.

Implementation:

```python
import math

def skjkasdkd(lst):
    def is_prime(n):
        if n < 2:
            return False
        for i in range(2, math.isqrt(n) + 1):
            if n % i == 0:
                return False
        return True

    max_prime = -1
    for num in lst:
        if is_prime(num) and num > max_prime:
            max_prime = num

    return sum(int(digit) for digit in str(max_prime))
```

This function works by first defining a helper function, is_prime, that checks if a number is prime. It then initializes max_prime to -1 and iterates through the list, updating max_prime whenever it finds a prime number that is larger than the current max_prime. Finally, it calculates and returns the sum of the digits of max_prime.
