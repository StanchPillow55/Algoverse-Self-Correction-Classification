Reasoning:

Given a list of integers, we are to determine the largest prime number in the list and return the sum of its digits. A prime number is a number that has only two distinct positive divisors: 1 and itself. The first few prime numbers are {2, 3, 5, 7, 11, â€¦}. We can obtain a solution for this by performing the following steps:

1. Initialize a variable `max_prime` to keep track of the maximum prime number. Set it to -1 as a start, since we haven't found any prime numbers yet.

2. Iterate through the list of integers. For each integer, check if it is a prime number. We can do this by checking if the number is divisible by any number from 2 to its square root (inclusive). If it is divisible, then it is not a prime number. If it is not divisible by any of these numbers, then it is a prime number.

3. If the current number is a prime number and it is greater than `max_prime`, update `max_prime` to be the current number.

4. After iterating through the list, if `max_prime` is still -1, it means there were no prime numbers in the list. In this case, return 0.

5. If `max_prime` is not -1, calculate the sum of its digits by converting it to a string, iterating through each character (which represents a digit), converting each character back to an integer, and adding these integers together.

6. Return the sum of the digits of `max_prime`.

Now let's implement this in code.

Implementation:

```python
def skjkasdkd(lst):
    def is_prime(n):
        if n <= 1:
            return False
        if n <= 3:
            return True
        if n % 2 == 0 or n % 3 == 0:
            return False
        i = 5
        while i * i <= n:
            if n % i == 0 or n % (i + 2) == 0:
                return False
            i += 6
        return True

    max_prime = -1
    for num in lst:
        if is_prime(num) and num > max_prime:
            max_prime = num

    if max_prime == -1:
        return 0

    return sum(int(digit) for digit in str(max_prime))
```

This function first defines a helper function `is_prime` to check if a number is prime. It then iterates through the list to find the maximum prime number. If no prime number is found, it returns 0. Otherwise, it calculates and returns the sum of the digits of the maximum prime number.
