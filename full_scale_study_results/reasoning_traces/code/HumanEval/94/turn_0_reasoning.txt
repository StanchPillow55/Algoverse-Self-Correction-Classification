First, let's understand the problem. We are given a list of integers and we need to find the largest prime number in the list and return the sum of its digits. 

A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. The first few prime numbers are {2, 3, 5, 7, 11, â€¦}. 

The steps to solve this problem are:

1. Iterate over the list of integers.
2. For each integer, check if it is a prime number.
3. If it is a prime number, check if it is larger than the current largest prime number found.
4. If it is larger, update the largest prime number.
5. After iterating over the entire list, find the sum of the digits of the largest prime number.

Now, let's implement the solution in Python:

```python
def skjkasdkd(lst):
    def is_prime(n):
        if n <= 1:
            return False
        if n <= 3:
            return True
        if n % 2 == 0 or n % 3 == 0:
            return False
        i = 5
        while i * i <= n:
            if n % i == 0 or n % (i + 2) == 0:
                return False
            i += 6
        return True

    max_prime = 0
    for num in lst:
        if is_prime(num) and num > max_prime:
            max_prime = num

    return sum(int(digit) for digit in str(max_prime))
```

In this solution, we first define a helper function `is_prime` that checks if a number is prime. We then initialize `max_prime` to 0 and iterate over the list. For each number, we check if it is prime and if it is larger than `max_prime`. If both conditions are true, we update `max_prime`. Finally, we return the sum of the digits of `max_prime`.
