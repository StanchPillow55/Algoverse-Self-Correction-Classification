Reasoning:

The problem is asking to return a list of positive numbers from the given list. 

To solve this problem, I will use list comprehension, which provides a concise way to create lists based on existing lists. 

In Python, list comprehension is an easy and flexible way to create lists. It consists of brackets containing an expression followed by a for statement, then zero or more for or if clauses. The expressions can be anything, meaning you can put in all kinds of objects in lists. 

The result will be a new list resulting from evaluating the expression in the context of the for and if statements which follow it. 

In this case, I will iterate over each element in the list and check if it is greater than zero. If it is, I will include it in the new list. 

This approach will give us a new list that only contains the positive numbers from the original list.

Implementation:

Here is the Python function that implements the above approach:

```python
def get_positive(l: list):
    return [i for i in l if i > 0]
```

This function uses list comprehension to create a new list that only includes the elements from the original list that are greater than zero. The `if i > 0` part of the list comprehension is a condition that filters out the negative numbers and zero. 

So, when you call `get_positive([-1, 2, -4, 5, 6])`, it will return `[2, 5, 6]`. And when you call `get_positive([5, 3, -5, 2, -3, 3, 9, 0, 123, 1, -10])`, it will return `[5, 3, 2, 3, 9, 123, 1]`.
