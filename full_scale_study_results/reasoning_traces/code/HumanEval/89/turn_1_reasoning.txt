To solve the problem of encrypting a string by rotating the alphabet, let's break down the requirements and steps needed to implement the solution.

### Problem Understanding

The task is to create a function `encrypt` that takes a string `s` and returns a new string where each letter in `s` is shifted down the alphabet by a certain number of positions. The shift is specified as "two multiplied to two places," which means each letter should be shifted by 4 positions (2 * 2 = 4).

For example:
- 'a' shifted by 4 becomes 'e'
- 'b' shifted by 4 becomes 'f'
- 'z' shifted by 4 wraps around to 'd'

### Steps to Solve the Problem

1. **Iterate Over Each Character**: We need to process each character in the input string individually.

2. **Determine the Shift**: The shift amount is 4 positions down the alphabet.

3. **Handle Alphabet Wrapping**: Since the alphabet is circular, if a letter goes past 'z', it should wrap around to the beginning of the alphabet. This can be handled using modular arithmetic.

4. **Construct the Encrypted String**: For each character, determine its new position after the shift and construct the resulting encrypted string.

5. **Return the Result**: Finally, return the encrypted string.

### Implementation Details

- Use the ASCII values of characters to calculate the new shifted character.
- The ASCII value of 'a' is 97 and 'z' is 122. We can use these to calculate the new position after the shift.
- For a character `c`, the new character can be calculated as:
  - `new_char = chr(((ord(c) - ord('a') + shift) % 26) + ord('a'))`
  - Here, `ord(c) - ord('a')` gives the zero-based index of the character in the alphabet.
  - Adding the shift and taking modulo 26 ensures wrapping around the alphabet.
  - Adding `ord('a')` converts the zero-based index back to an ASCII value.

### Implementation

Now, let's implement the `encrypt` function:

```python
def encrypt(s):
    """Encrypts the string by rotating each letter by 4 positions in the alphabet."""
    shift = 4
    encrypted_string = []
    
    for char in s:
        # Calculate the new character after shifting
        new_char = chr(((ord(char) - ord('a') + shift) % 26) + ord('a'))
        encrypted_string.append(new_char)
    
    # Join the list into a single string and return
    return ''.join(encrypted_string)

# Test cases
print(encrypt('hi'))        # Expected output: 'lm'
print(encrypt('asdfghjkl')) # Expected output: 'ewhjklnop'
print(encrypt('gf'))        # Expected output: 'kj'
print(encrypt('et'))        # Expected output: 'ix'
```

### Explanation

- We iterate over each character in the input string.
- For each character, we calculate its new position after shifting by 4 positions.
- We handle the wrapping around the alphabet using modulo 26.
- We construct the encrypted string by appending each new character to a list and then joining the list into a string.
- Finally, we return the encrypted string.
