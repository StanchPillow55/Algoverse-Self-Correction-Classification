Reasoning:

The problem is asking to create a function that takes a string as an argument and returns a string encrypted with the alphabet being rotated. The alphabet should be rotated in a manner such that the letters shift down by two multiplied to two places. This is also known as a Caesar Cipher, which is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is 'shifted' a certain number of places down the alphabet. In this case, the shift is 4 places.

To solve this problem, we need to:

1. Define a function named `encrypt` that takes a string `s` as an argument.
2. Create an empty string `result` to store the encrypted string.
3. Iterate over each character `c` in the string `s`.
4. Check if the character `c` is a letter. If it is not a letter, add it to `result` as is.
5. If the character `c` is a letter, calculate the ASCII value of the character `c` shifted by 4 places. If the shifted value exceeds the ASCII value of 'z' or 'Z', wrap it around to the start of the alphabet.
6. Convert the shifted ASCII value back to a character and add it to `result`.
7. Return `result` as the encrypted string.

Implementation:

Here is the Python code that implements the above approach:

```python
def encrypt(s):
    result = ''
    for c in s:
        if c.isalpha():
            ascii_val = ord(c)
            shift = 4
            if c.islower():
                ascii_val = (ascii_val - ord('a') + shift) % 26 + ord('a')
            else:
                ascii_val = (ascii_val - ord('A') + shift) % 26 + ord('A')
            result += chr(ascii_val)
        else:
            result += c
    return result
```

This function works by iterating over each character in the input string. If the character is a letter, it calculates the ASCII value of the character shifted by 4 places. If the shifted value exceeds the ASCII value of 'z' or 'Z', it wraps it around to the start of the alphabet. The shifted ASCII value is then converted back to a character and added to the result string. If the character is not a letter, it is added to the result string as is. The function finally returns the result string as the encrypted string.
