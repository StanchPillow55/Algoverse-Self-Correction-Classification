==================================================

Reasoning:

Given two lists, we are to determine the common elements in both lists. We can obtain a solution for this by performing the following steps:
1. Convert both lists to a set. This would remove any duplicate elements in the list
2. Find the intersection of both sets. This would give us the common elements in both lists
3. Convert the result back to a list and sort the list in ascending order

Let's implement this.

Implementation: 

```python
def common(l1: list, l2: list):
    # convert list to set to remove duplicates
    set1 = set(l1)
    set2 = set(l2)
    
    # find common elements
    common_elements = set1.intersection(set2)
    
    # convert back to list and sort
    return sorted(list(common_elements))
```

This function works by first converting the input lists to sets, which automatically removes any duplicate values. Then it uses the `intersection` method of the set class to find the common elements between the two sets. Finally, it converts the resulting set back to a list and sorts it before returning it. The time complexity for this function is O(n log n) due to the sorting operation, where n is the number of common elements.
