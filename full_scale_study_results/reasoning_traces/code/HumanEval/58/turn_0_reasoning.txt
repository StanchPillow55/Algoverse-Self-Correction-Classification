Reasoning:

Given two lists, we are to determine the common elements in both lists. We can obtain a solution for this by performing the following steps:
1. Convert both lists to sets. This will automatically remove any duplicates in each list since sets only contain unique elements.
2. Perform an intersection operation on both sets. This will give us a new set that contains only the elements that are common to both sets.
3. Convert the resulting set back to a list and sort it. This will give us a list of the common elements, sorted in ascending order.

Implementation:

Now let's implement this in code. We'll define a function `common` that takes two lists as input and returns a sorted list of their common elements. 

Here is the Python function: 

```python
def common(l1: list, l2: list):
    # Convert lists to sets
    set1 = set(l1)
    set2 = set(l2)

    # Find common elements
    common_elements = set1.intersection(set2)

    # Convert to list and sort
    sorted_common_elements = sorted(list(common_elements))

    return sorted_common_elements
```

This function first converts the input lists to sets, then finds the intersection of these sets to get the common elements. It then converts the resulting set back to a list and sorts it before returning it. 

This solution has a time complexity of O(n log n) due to the sorting operation, where n is the number of common elements. The space complexity is O(n), where n is the total number of unique elements in both lists.
