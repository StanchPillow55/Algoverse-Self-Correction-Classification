==================================================

Reasoning:

The problem is asking to find the minimum path of length k in the grid. The path is considered minimum if the ordered list of the values on the cells that the path goes through is lexicographically less than any other path of the same length. 

To solve the problem, I will use the Depth-First Search (DFS) algorithm. The DFS algorithm is an algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures. The algorithm starts at the root (selecting some arbitrary node as the root in the case of a graph) and explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.

Here is my step-by-step approach:

1. I will first initialize an empty list to store the minimum path.
2. Then, I will iterate over each cell in the grid and perform a DFS from that cell.
3. In the DFS function, I will first check if the current path length is equal to k. If it is, I will compare the current path with the minimum path and update the minimum path if the current path is lexicographically smaller.
4. If the current path length is less than k, I will explore the neighboring cells by moving up, down, left, or right. I will ensure not to go off the grid by checking the boundaries.
5. After exploring a cell, I will backtrack by removing the last cell from the current path.
6. Finally, I will return the minimum path.

Let's implement this now.
