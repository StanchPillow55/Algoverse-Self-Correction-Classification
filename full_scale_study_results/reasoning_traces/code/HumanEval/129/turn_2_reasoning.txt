==================================================

The problem is asking to find the minimum path of length k in the grid. The path is considered minimum if the ordered list of the values on the cells that the path goes through is lexicographically less than any other path of the same length. 

To solve this problem, we can use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. The BFS algorithm is an algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures. It starts at the tree root (or some arbitrary node of a graph, sometimes referred to as a 'search key') and explores the neighbor nodes at the present depth prior to moving on to nodes at the next depth level.

Here is the step-by-step approach to solve the problem:

1. Initialize a priority queue. Each element in the queue is a tuple of three elements: the current value of the cell, the current position (row and column), and the path taken so far.

2. Start by adding all the cells in the grid to the priority queue. The priority queue will automatically sort the cells based on their values.

3. Pop the cell with the smallest value from the priority queue. 

4. Check if the length of the path taken so far is equal to k. If it is, return the path since it's the minimum path of length k. 

5. If the length of the path taken so far is less than k, add the neighboring cells to the priority queue. Make sure not to add cells that are out of the grid or cells that have already been visited.

6. Repeat steps 3-5 until the priority queue is empty.

Now, let's implement this approach in Python:

```python
import heapq

def minPath(grid, k):
    N = len(grid)
    visited = set()
    queue = [(grid[i][j], i, j, []) for i in range(N) for j in range(N)]
    heapq.heapify(queue)

    while queue:
        val, i, j, path = heapq.heappop(queue)
        if (i, j) not in visited:
            visited.add((i, j))
            path = path + [val]
            if len(path) == k:
                return path
            for x, y in [(i-1, j), (i+1, j), (i, j-1), (i, j+1)]:
                if 0 <= x < N and 0 <= y < N and (x, y) not in visited:
                    heapq.heappush(queue, (grid[x][y], x, y, path))
```

This Python function uses the heapq module which provides an implementation of the heap queue algorithm, also known as the priority queue algorithm. The function first initializes the priority queue with all the cells in the grid and the visited set to keep track of the cells that have been visited. Then, it enters a loop where it pops the cell with the smallest value from the queue, checks if the length of the path is equal to k, and adds the neighboring cells to the queue. The loop continues until the queue is empty.
