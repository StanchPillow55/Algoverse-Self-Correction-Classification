The problem is asking to find the minimum path of length k in the grid. The path is considered minimum if the ordered list of the values on the cells that the path goes through is lexicographically less than any other path of the same length. 

To solve this problem, we can use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm. The BFS algorithm is a graph traversal algorithm that explores all the vertices of a graph in breadth-first order, i.e., it explores all the vertices at the present depth before moving on to vertices at the next depth level. 

Here is the step by step approach to solve this problem:

1. Initialize a priority queue. The priority queue will store the tuples of the form (value, row, column, path), where value is the value of the current cell, row and column are the coordinates of the current cell, and path is the list of values on the cells that the path has gone through so far. The priority queue is sorted in ascending order based on the value.

2. Add all the cells of the grid to the priority queue.

3. Pop the cell with the smallest value from the priority queue. This will be the starting cell of the minimum path.

4. Perform a BFS from the starting cell. In each step of the BFS, add the neighboring cells to the priority queue and update the path.

5. Continue the BFS until the length of the path is equal to k. The path at this point will be the minimum path of length k.

6. Return the path.

Now let's implement this approach in Python.

```python
import heapq

def minPath(grid, k):
    N = len(grid)
    pq = [(grid[i][j], i, j, []) for i in range(N) for j in range(N)]
    heapq.heapify(pq)
    directions = [(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]
    while pq:
        val, x, y, path = heapq.heappop(pq)
        path = path + [val]
        if len(path) == k:
            return path
        for dx, dy in directions:
            nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
            if 0 <= nx < N and 0 <= ny < N:
                heapq.heappush(pq, (grid[nx][ny], nx, ny, path))
```

This function works by first initializing a priority queue with all the cells in the grid. Then it performs a BFS from the cell with the smallest value, adding the neighboring cells to the priority queue and updating the path in each step. The BFS continues until the length of the path is equal to k, at which point the function returns the path.
