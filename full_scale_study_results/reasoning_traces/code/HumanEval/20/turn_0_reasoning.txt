==================================================

The problem is asking to return the two closest numbers from the given list. Here is my approach to solve this problem:

1. First, I will sort the given list of numbers in ascending order. This will help in comparing the adjacent numbers to find the closest pair.

2. Then, I will initialize two variables, min_diff and closest_pair. min_diff will keep track of the minimum difference found so far and closest_pair will store the pair of numbers with the minimum difference.

3. I will iterate over the sorted list from the second element to the end. For each number, I will calculate the difference with the previous number. If this difference is less than min_diff, I will update min_diff and closest_pair.

4. Finally, I will return the closest_pair.

Here is the Python code implementing this approach:

```python
from typing import List, Tuple

def find_closest_elements(numbers: List[float]) -> Tuple[float, float]:
    # Sort the list in ascending order
    numbers.sort()
    
    # Initialize min_diff and closest_pair
    min_diff = float('inf')
    closest_pair = None
    
    # Iterate over the sorted list
    for i in range(1, len(numbers)):
        # Calculate the difference with the previous number
        diff = numbers[i] - numbers[i - 1]
        
        # If this difference is less than min_diff, update min_diff and closest_pair
        if diff < min_diff:
            min_diff = diff
            closest_pair = (numbers[i - 1], numbers[i])
    
    # Return the closest pair
    return closest_pair
```

This function works by comparing each number with its previous number in the sorted list, which ensures that it finds the pair of numbers with the smallest difference. The time complexity is O(n log n) due to the sorting operation, where n is the length of the input list. The space complexity is O(1) as it uses a constant amount of space to store the minimum difference and the closest pair.
