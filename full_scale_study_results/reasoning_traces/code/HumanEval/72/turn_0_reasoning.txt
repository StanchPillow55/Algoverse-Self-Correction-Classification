==================================================

The problem is asking to return True if the given list is a palindrome and the sum of the list is less than or equal to the given maximum weight, otherwise return False.

To solve the problem I will use the following steps
- First, I will check if the given list is a palindrome. A list is a palindrome if it remains the same when reversed. So, I will compare the list with its reversed version. If they are the same, then the list is a palindrome.
- If the list is a palindrome, I will then calculate the sum of the elements in the list and check if it is less than or equal to the given maximum weight. If it is, I will return True, otherwise, I will return False.
- If the list is not a palindrome, I will return False.

Now I will implement this in the function.

```python
def will_it_fly(q, w):
    if q == q[::-1]: # check if the list is a palindrome
        if sum(q) <= w: # check if the sum of the elements is less than or equal to the maximum weight
            return True
    return False
```

This function first checks if the list is a palindrome by comparing it with its reversed version. If they are the same, it then calculates the sum of the elements in the list and checks if it is less than or equal to the maximum weight. If it is, it returns True. If either of these conditions is not met, it returns False.
