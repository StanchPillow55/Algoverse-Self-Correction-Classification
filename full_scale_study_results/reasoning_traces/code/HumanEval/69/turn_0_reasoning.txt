Reasoning:

Given a list of positive integers, we are to determine the greatest integer that is greater than zero, and has a frequency greater than or equal to the value of the integer itself. We can obtain a solution for this by performing the following steps:

1. Initialize a dictionary to keep track of the frequency of each integer in the list
2. Iterate through all the elements in the list and update the frequency of each integer in the dictionary
3. Iterate through all the keys in the dictionary and check if the frequency of the key is greater than or equal to the key itself. If it is, we would update our result variable with the maximum value between the current key and the result variable
4. After iterating through all the keys in the dictionary, we would check if the result variable is still equal to zero. If it is, we would output -1 else we would output the result variable

Example
----------
Suppose we have a single test case such that the list is equal to [4, 1, 2, 2, 3, 1]. The frequency of each integer in the list would be equal to {4: 1, 1: 2, 2: 2, 3: 1}. Iterating through all the keys in the dictionary, we would find that the integer `2` has a frequency that is greater than or equal to the integer itself. Thus the output would be equal to `2`

Implementation
------------------
We can implement this solution in python as follows:

def search(lst):
    # step 1
    frequency = {}
    
    # step 2
    for num in lst:
        if num in frequency:
            frequency[num] += 1
        else:
            frequency[num] = 1
    
    # step 3
    result = 0
    for key in frequency:
        if frequency[key] >= key:
            result = max(result, key)
    
    # step 4
    if result == 0:
        return -1
    else:
        return result
