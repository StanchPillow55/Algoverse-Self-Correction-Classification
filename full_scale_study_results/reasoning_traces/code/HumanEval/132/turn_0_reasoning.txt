Reasoning:

The problem is asking to check if a given string of square brackets is properly nested or not. A string is properly nested if it meets the following conditions:

1. An empty string is properly nested.
2. If "S" is properly nested, then "[S]" is also properly nested.
3. If "S" and "T" are properly nested strings, then "ST" is also properly nested.

To solve this problem, we can use a stack data structure. We iterate through the string and for each character:

- If it's an opening bracket, we push it into the stack.
- If it's a closing bracket, we check if the stack is not empty and the top element of the stack is an opening bracket. If it is, we pop the opening bracket from the stack. If the stack is empty or the top element is not an opening bracket, the string is not properly nested.

After iterating through the string, if the stack is empty, the string is properly nested. If the stack is not empty, the string is not properly nested.

However, this approach only checks if the string is properly nested. The problem also asks us to check if there is at least one nested bracket in the string. To do this, we can add a counter that increments every time we find a nested bracket (i.e., every time we pop an opening bracket from the stack). If the counter is greater than zero at the end, we return True. If the counter is zero, we return False.

Implementation:

Now let's implement this approach in Python. We'll use a list to represent the stack, since Python lists have O(1) time complexity for append and pop operations. We'll also use a counter variable to keep track of the number of nested brackets.
