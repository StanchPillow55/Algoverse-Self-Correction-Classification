Reasoning:

The problem is asking to check if the given string of brackets is nested or not. A string of brackets is considered nested if there is a valid subsequence of brackets where at least one bracket in the subsequence is nested. 

A nested bracket is a bracket that is enclosed by another bracket. For example, in the string "[[]]", the inner brackets "[]" are nested within the outer brackets "[]". 

To solve this problem, we can use a stack data structure. We iterate through the string, and for each character:

- If the character is an opening bracket "[", we push it onto the stack.
- If the character is a closing bracket "]", we check if the top of the stack is an opening bracket. If it is, we pop it from the stack. If the stack is empty or the top of the stack is not an opening bracket, we return False because the string is not properly nested.

After iterating through the string, if the stack is not empty, we return False because there are unmatched opening brackets. If the stack is empty, we return True because all brackets are properly nested.

However, this approach only checks if the brackets are properly nested, not if there is at least one nested bracket. To check for at least one nested bracket, we can add a counter that increments every time we find a nested bracket (i.e., every time we pop an opening bracket from the stack). If the counter is greater than 0 at the end of the function, we return True. Otherwise, we return False.

Implementation:

Now let's implement this approach in Python.
