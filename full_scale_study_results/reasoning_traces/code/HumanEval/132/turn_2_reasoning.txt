Reasoning:

The problem is asking to check if the given string of square brackets is nested or not. A string of square brackets is considered nested if there is at least one pair of brackets that is completely enclosed by another pair of brackets. 

To solve this problem, I will use a stack data structure. The stack is a last-in, first-out (LIFO) data structure, which means the last element added to the stack will be the first one to be removed. This property of the stack makes it ideal for this problem because we can use it to keep track of the opening brackets and match them with the closing brackets.

Here is the step-by-step approach to solve this problem:

1. Initialize an empty stack.
2. Iterate over each character in the string.
3. If the character is an opening bracket ('['), push it to the stack.
4. If the character is a closing bracket (']'), check if the stack is empty. If it is, return False because a closing bracket cannot appear before an opening bracket. If the stack is not empty, pop the top element from the stack.
5. After iterating over all the characters in the string, check if the stack is empty. If it is not, return False because there are unmatched opening brackets. If it is, return True because all the brackets are properly nested.
6. If at any point the stack size is less than 2, return False because there are not enough brackets to form a nested structure.

Let's implement this approach in the function.

Implementation: 

Here is the Python function that implements the above approach:
