Reasoning:

Given a number `n`, we are to determine a list of size `n` such that the value of the element at index `i` is the factorial of `i` if `i` is even or the sum of numbers from `1` to `i` otherwise. 

We can obtain a solution for this by performing the following steps:
1. Initialize a list `result` to keep track of the factorial or sum of numbers from `1` to `i`
2. Next, we would iterate through the range of `n` and at each `i-th` index, we would check if the index is even. If it is, we would calculate the factorial of `i` and append it to the `result` list. If it is not, we would calculate the sum of numbers from `1` to `i` and append it to the `result` list
3. Finally, we would output the `result` list

Example
----------
Suppose `n` is `5`, we would initialize an empty list `result`. Next, we would iterate through the range of `n` and at each `i-th` index, we would check if the index is even. If it is, we would calculate the factorial of `i` and append it to the `result` list. If it is not, we would calculate the sum of numbers from `1` to `i` and append it to the `result` list. Thus the output would be `[1, 2, 6, 24, 15]`

Implementation
-------------------
Here is a python function that implements the above approach:

```python
def f(n):
    # helper function to calculate factorial
    def factorial(num):
        if num == 0 or num == 1:
            return 1
        else:
            return num * factorial(num - 1)

    # helper function to calculate sum of numbers from 1 to num
    def sum_nums(num):
        return sum(range(1, num + 1))

    # initialize result list
    result = []

    # iterate through the range of n
    for i in range(n):
        # check if index is even
        if i % 2 == 0:
            # calculate factorial and append to result list
            result.append(factorial(i))
        else:
            # calculate sum of numbers and append to result list
            result.append(sum_nums(i))

    return result
```
