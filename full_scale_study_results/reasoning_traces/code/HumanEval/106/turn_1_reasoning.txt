==================================================

Reasoning:

The problem is asking to return a list of size n, where the value of the element at index i is the factorial of i if i is even or the sum of numbers from 1 to i otherwise. 

The factorial of a number is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to that number. For example, the factorial of 5 (denoted as 5!) is 1*2*3*4*5 = 120.

The sum of numbers from 1 to i is simply the sum of all integers from 1 up to i. For example, the sum of numbers from 1 to 5 is 1+2+3+4+5 = 15.

The problem also specifies that i starts from 1, so we need to be careful with indexing, as Python lists are 0-indexed. 

We can solve this problem by initializing an empty list, then iterating from 1 to n. For each number i, we check if it's even. If it is, we calculate its factorial and append it to the list. If it's not, we calculate the sum of numbers from 1 to i and append it to the list.

Finally, we return the list.

Implementation:

Let's implement this in Python. We'll need to define two helper functions: one to calculate the factorial of a number, and one to calculate the sum of numbers from 1 to a given number. We'll use the built-in range function to generate the numbers to sum or multiply. 

Here is the Python code for the problem:
