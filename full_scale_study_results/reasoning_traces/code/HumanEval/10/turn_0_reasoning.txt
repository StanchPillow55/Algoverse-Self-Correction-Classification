The problem is asking to implement a function that takes a string as input and returns the shortest palindrome that can be created by appending characters to the end of the input string.

The approach to solve this problem is as follows:

1. First, we need to find the longest palindromic suffix of the input string. A suffix is a substring that occurs at the end of the string. A palindromic suffix is a suffix that is a palindrome. 

2. Once we have found the longest palindromic suffix, we need to append to the end of the input string the reverse of the prefix that comes before the palindromic suffix. The prefix is the part of the string that comes before the suffix.

3. To find the longest palindromic suffix, we can use the following approach: Start from the end of the string and move towards the beginning. At each step, check if the current suffix is a palindrome. If it is, then we have found the longest palindromic suffix. We can use the `is_palindrome` function to check if a string is a palindrome.

4. To append the reverse of the prefix to the end of the string, we can use slicing and the `[::-1]` syntax to reverse the string.

Now, let's implement this approach in code.

```python
def is_palindrome(string: str) -> bool:
    """ Test if given string is a palindrome """
    return string == string[::-1]

def make_palindrome(string: str) -> str:
    """ Find the shortest palindrome that begins with a supplied string. """
    if is_palindrome(string):
        return string
    else:
        for i in range(len(string) - 1, -1, -1):
            if is_palindrome(string[i:]):
                return string + string[:i][::-1]
```

In the `make_palindrome` function, we first check if the input string is already a palindrome. If it is, we simply return the string. If it is not, we start from the end of the string and move towards the beginning. At each step, we check if the current suffix is a palindrome. If it is, we append the reverse of the prefix to the end of the string and return the result.
