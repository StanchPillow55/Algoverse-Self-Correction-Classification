Turn: 1
Dataset Type: code
==================================================

Reasoning:

Given a list of integers, we are to determine the sum of all odd elements that are in even positions. We can obtain a solution for this by performing the following steps:
1. Initialize a variable `sum` to keep track of the sum of all odd elements in even positions
2. Iterate through all the elements in the list. On each iteration, we would check if the index of the current element is even and if the current element is odd. If it is, we would add the current element to the `sum` variable
3. After iterating through all the elements in the list, we would output the value of the `sum` variable

Example
----------
Suppose we have a single test case such that the list is equal to `[5, 8, 7, 1]`. The elements at even indices are `5` and `7` and they are both odd. Thus the sum of all odd elements in even positions would be equal to `5 + 7 = 12`

Implementation
-------------------
We can implement this solution in python as follows:

```python
def solution(lst):
    # store sum of all odd elements in even positions
    sum = 0

    # iterate through all the elements in the list
    for i in range(len(lst)):
        # check if the index of the current element is even and if the current element is odd
        if i % 2 == 0 and lst[i] % 2 != 0:
            # add the current element to the sum variable
            sum += lst[i]
            
    # output the sum of all odd elements in even positions
    return sum
```
