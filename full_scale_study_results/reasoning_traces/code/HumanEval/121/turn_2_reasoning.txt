Question ID: HumanEval/121
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: code
==================================================

Reasoning:

Given a list of integers, we are to determine the sum of all odd elements that are in even positions. We can obtain a solution for this by performing the following steps:
1. Initialize a variable `sum` to keep track of the sum of all odd elements in even positions
2. Iterate through all the elements in the list. On each iteration, check if the index of the current element is even and if the current element is odd. If it is, add it to the sum
3. Return the sum

Approach:

1. Initialize `sum` to 0
2. Iterate through the list using a for loop. Use the `enumerate` function to get both the index and value of each element.
3. Inside the loop, use an if statement to check if the index is even (index % 2 == 0) and if the value is odd (value % 2 != 0). If both conditions are true, add the value to `sum`.
4. After the loop, return `sum`.

Implementation: 

Now we can implement this approach in code. Here is the Python function that solves the problem: 

```python
def solution(lst):
    sum = 0
    for i, val in enumerate(lst):
        if i % 2 == 0 and val % 2 != 0:
            sum += val
    return sum
```

This function works by iterating over the list and adding to `sum` any odd numbers that are in even positions. The `enumerate` function is used to get both the index and value of each element in the list. The index is used to check if the position is even, and the value is used to check if the number is odd. If both conditions are true, the value is added to `sum`. After all elements have been checked, the function returns `sum`, which is the sum of all odd numbers in even positions.
