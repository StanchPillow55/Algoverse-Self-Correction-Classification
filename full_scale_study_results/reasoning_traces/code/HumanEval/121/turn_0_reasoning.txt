Turn: 0
Dataset Type: code
==================================================

Reasoning:

Given a list of integers, we are to determine the sum of all odd elements that are in even positions. We can obtain a solution for this by performing the following steps: 
- Initialize a variable `sum` to keep track of the sum of all odd elements that are in even positions
- Iterate through the entire list and at each iteration, check if the current index is even and if the element at the current index is odd. If it is, we would add the element at the current index to the `sum` variable
- Finally we would output the `sum` variable

Implementation:

Now let's translate our approach into code.

```python
def solution(lst):
    # Initialize sum variable
    sum = 0

    # Iterate through the list
    for i in range(len(lst)):
        # Check if index is even and element is odd
        if i % 2 == 0 and lst[i] % 2 != 0:
            # Add element to sum
            sum += lst[i]

    # Return sum
    return sum
```

This function works by iterating over the list and checking each element. If the index of the element is even (i.e., the element is in an even position) and the element itself is odd, it adds the element to the sum. At the end of the function, it returns the sum of all the odd elements in even positions.
