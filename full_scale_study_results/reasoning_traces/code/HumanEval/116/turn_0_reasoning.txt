==================================================

The problem is asking to sort an array of non-negative integers based on the number of ones in their binary representation. If two numbers have the same number of ones, then we need to sort them based on their decimal value.

Here is my approach to solve this problem:

1. I will use the built-in `sort` function in Python which sorts the elements in ascending order. This function also accepts a key parameter which is a function that serves as a key or a basis of sort comparison.

2. For the key function, I will use a lambda function that returns a tuple. The first element of the tuple is the count of ones in the binary representation of the number, and the second element is the number itself. This is because when comparing two tuples in Python, the comparison is done lexicographically. That means the first elements of the tuples are compared, and if they are equal, then the second elements are compared, and so on. This behavior is exactly what we need for this problem.

3. To get the binary representation of a number, I will use the `bin` function in Python which returns a string of the binary representation of the number. I will then count the number of ones in this string using the `count` method.

Here is the Python code that implements this approach:

```python
def sort_array(arr):
    return sorted(arr, key=lambda x: (bin(x).count('1'), x))
```

This function works as follows:

- For each number in the array, it computes a key which is a tuple. The first element of the tuple is the count of ones in the binary representation of the number, and the second element is the number itself.

- It then sorts the array based on these keys. Since the keys are tuples, the sort is done lexicographically. That means the numbers are first sorted based on the count of ones, and then based on their decimal value if the counts are equal.

- Finally, it returns the sorted array.
