Reasoning:

Given two lists, `game` and `guess`, we are to determine how far off each guess was. We can obtain a solution for this by iterating through both lists and at each index, we would find the absolute difference between the `game` list and the `guess` list. If the guess is correct, we would append `0` to our result list else we would append the absolute difference between the `game` list and the `guess` list.

Steps:
- Initialize an empty list `result`
- Iterate through both lists simultaneously using the `zip` function
- On each iteration, check if the `game` score is equal to the `guess` score
- If they are equal, append `0` to the `result` list
- If they are not equal, append the absolute difference between the `game` score and the `guess` score to the `result` list
- Return the `result` list

Implementation: 

Now we would implement the plan in python. We would use the `zip` function to iterate through both lists simultaneously. On each iteration, we would check if the `game` score is equal to the `guess` score. If they are equal, we would append `0` to the `result` list. If they are not equal, we would append the absolute difference between the `game` score and the `guess` score to the `result` list. Finally, we would return the `result` list. 

Here is the python function to achieve this: 

```python
def compare(game, guess):
    result = []
    for game_score, guess_score in zip(game, guess):
        if game_score == guess_score:
            result.append(0)
        else:
            result.append(abs(game_score - guess_score))
    return result
```

This function works as follows:
- It first initializes an empty list `result`
- It then iterates through both `game` and `guess` lists simultaneously using the `zip` function
- On each iteration, it checks if the `game` score is equal to the `guess` score
- If they are equal, it appends `0` to the `result` list
- If they are not equal, it appends the absolute difference between the `game` score and the `guess` score to the `result` list
- Finally, it returns the `result` list
