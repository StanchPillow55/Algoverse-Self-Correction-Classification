==================================================

Reasoning:

The problem is asking to change the case of each character in the given string. If a character is in uppercase, it should be changed to lowercase and vice versa. 

To solve this problem, I will use the built-in Python functions `isupper()` and `islower()`. These functions check if a character is in uppercase or lowercase respectively. 

I will iterate over each character in the string. If the character is in uppercase, I will convert it to lowercase using the `lower()` function. If the character is in lowercase, I will convert it to uppercase using the `upper()` function. 

If the character is not a letter (for example, it's a number or a special character), I will leave it as it is. 

Finally, I will join all the characters together to form the final string and return it.

Implementation:

Here is the Python function that implements the above approach:

```python
def flip_case(string: str) -> str:
    result = []
    for char in string:
        if char.isupper():
            result.append(char.lower())
        elif char.islower():
            result.append(char.upper())
        else:
            result.append(char)
    return ''.join(result)
```

This function works by iterating over each character in the input string. If the character is uppercase, it is converted to lowercase and added to the result list. If the character is lowercase, it is converted to uppercase and added to the result list. If the character is not a letter, it is added to the result list as it is. Finally, the function returns the result list joined into a string.
