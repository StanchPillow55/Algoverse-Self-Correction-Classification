==================================================

A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequence of characters that reads the same forward and backward, ignoring spaces, punctuation, and capitalization.

To solve this problem, we can use the property of palindromes where the string remains the same even if it is reversed. So, we can simply reverse the given string and compare it with the original string. If both are the same, then the string is a palindrome, otherwise it is not.

Here is the step-by-step approach to solve this problem:

1. Reverse the given string.
2. Compare the reversed string with the original string.
3. If both are the same, return True, indicating that the string is a palindrome.
4. If both are not the same, return False, indicating that the string is not a palindrome.

Now, let's implement this in Python:

```python
def is_palindrome(text: str) -> bool:
    """
    Checks if given string is a palindrome
    """
    # Reverse the string and compare with the original string
    return text == text[::-1]
```

This function uses Python's slicing feature to reverse the string. The `[::-1]` slice means start at the end of the string and end at position 0, move with the step -1, which is used for reversing a string. Then it compares the reversed string with the original string using the `==` operator, which returns True if both are the same, otherwise it returns False.
