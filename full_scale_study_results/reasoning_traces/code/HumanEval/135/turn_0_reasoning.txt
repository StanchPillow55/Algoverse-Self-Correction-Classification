==================================================

The problem is asking to return the largest index of an element which is not greater than or equal to the element immediately preceding it. This means we are looking for the first instance where the sequence of numbers is not in ascending order. If the sequence is entirely in ascending order, we return -1 as per the problem statement.

To solve this problem, we can iterate through the array from the end to the start. We compare each element with the one before it. If the current element is less than the previous one, we return the index of the current element. If we reach the start of the array without finding such an element, we return -1.

Here is the Python function that implements this logic:

```python
def can_arrange(arr):
    for i in range(len(arr) - 1, 0, -1):
        if arr[i] < arr[i - 1]:
            return i
    return -1
```

This function starts from the end of the array (index `len(arr) - 1`) and goes up to the second element (index `1`). It checks if the current element is less than the previous one and returns the index if it is. If it reaches the second element without finding such an element, it returns -1.

This function has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the array. This is because in the worst case, it needs to check every element of the array. The space complexity is O(1), as it only uses a constant amount of space to store the index and does not depend on the size of the input array.
