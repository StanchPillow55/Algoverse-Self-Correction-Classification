==================================================

Reasoning:

Given an integer `n`, we are to determine a string sequence of numbers from `0` to `n` inclusive. We can obtain a solution for this by performing the following steps: 
- Initialize an empty string `sequence`
- Iterate through a range object from `0` to `n` inclusive
- On each iteration, convert the current integer to a string and append it to the `sequence` string
- Return the `sequence` string

Implementation:

Now we can implement this in code. We will use the `range()` function to generate the sequence of numbers from 0 to `n`. Then we will use a list comprehension to convert each number to a string. Finally, we will use the `join()` method to concatenate all the strings into one string with a space between each number. 

Here is the Python function that implements this approach:

```python
def string_sequence(n: int) -> str:
    """ Return a string containing space-delimited numbers starting from 0 upto n inclusive.
    >>> string_sequence(0)
    '0'
    >>> string_sequence(5)
    '0 1 2 3 4 5'
    """
    # Use a list comprehension to generate a list of strings
    sequence = [str(i) for i in range(n+1)]
    
    # Join the list of strings into one string with a space between each number
    return ' '.join(sequence)
```

This function works by first generating a list of strings using a list comprehension. The `range(n+1)` generates a sequence of numbers from 0 to `n` inclusive. The `str(i)` converts each number to a string. The result is a list of strings.

Then, the `join()` method is used to concatenate all the strings in the list into one string. The `' '.join(sequence)` statement inserts a space between each number in the string. The result is a string containing space-delimited numbers starting from 0 up to `n` inclusive.
