==================================================

Reasoning:

Given two strings consisting of open and close parentheses, we are to determine if it is possible to concatenate the two strings in some order such that the resulting string will be good. A string is considered good if and only if all parentheses in the string are balanced. 

We can obtain a solution for this by performing the following steps:
1. Initialize two variables `open_parens` and `close_parens` to keep track of the number of open and close parentheses in the string.
2. Iterate through each string in the list. For each string, iterate through each character in the string. If the character is an open parenthesis, increment the `open_parens` counter. If the character is a close parenthesis, check if there are any open parentheses that have not been closed (i.e., `open_parens` > 0). If there are, decrement the `open_parens` counter (since the close parenthesis would balance one open parenthesis). If there are no open parentheses, increment the `close_parens` counter.
3. After iterating through all strings and characters, check if there are any open or close parentheses that have not been balanced (i.e., `open_parens` or `close_parens` > 0). If there are, return 'No'. If there are not, return 'Yes'.

This approach works because it ensures that every open parenthesis is balanced by a close parenthesis, and vice versa. It also takes into account the order of the parentheses, since a close parenthesis cannot balance an open parenthesis that comes after it.

Implementation:

Now let's implement this approach in Python.
