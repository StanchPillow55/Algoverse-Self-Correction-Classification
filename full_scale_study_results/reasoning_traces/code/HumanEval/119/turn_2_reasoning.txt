==================================================

Reasoning:

Given two strings that consist of open parentheses '(' or close parentheses ')' only, we are to determine if it is possible to concatenate the two strings in some order, such that the resulting string will be good. A string is considered good if and only if all parentheses in the string are balanced. 

We can obtain a solution for this by performing the following steps:
1. Initialize two variables `open_count` and `close_count` to keep track of the number of open and close parentheses respectively. 
2. Iterate through the first string in the list. If we encounter an open parenthesis, we increment the `open_count` variable. If we encounter a close parenthesis, we check if the `open_count` variable is greater than 0. If it is, we decrement the `open_count` variable, else we increment the `close_count` variable.
3. Repeat step 2 for the second string in the list.
4. At the end of the iteration, if the `open_count` and `close_count` variables are both equal to 0, it means that the parentheses in the string are balanced, hence we return 'Yes'. If not, we return 'No'.

Implementation:

Now we would implement the solution in python. 

```python
def match_parens(lst):
    open_count = 0
    close_count = 0

    for string in lst:
        for char in string:
            if char == '(':
                open_count += 1
            else:
                if open_count > 0:
                    open_count -= 1
                else:
                    close_count += 1

    if open_count == 0 and close_count == 0:
        return 'Yes'
    else:
        return 'No'
```

This function works by iterating through each character in the strings in the list. It keeps track of the number of open and close parentheses, and checks if they are balanced. If they are, it returns 'Yes', else it returns 'No'.
