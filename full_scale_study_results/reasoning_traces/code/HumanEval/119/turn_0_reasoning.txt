Reasoning:

Given two strings consisting of open and close parentheses, we are to determine if we can concatenate the two strings in some order such that the resulting string will be good. A string is considered good if and only if all parentheses in the string are balanced. 

We can obtain a solution for this by performing the following steps: 
- First, we would initialize two variables `open_parens` and `close_parens` to keep track of the number of open and close parentheses in the string. 
- Next, we would iterate through all the characters in the first string in the list. If the character is an open parenthesis, we would increment the `open_parens` variable by one. If the character is a close parenthesis, we would check if the `open_parens` variable is greater than zero. If it is, we would decrement the `open_parens` variable by one. If it is not, we would increment the `close_parens` variable by one.
- We would then repeat the above step for the second string in the list.
- Finally, we would check if the `open_parens` and `close_parens` variables are both equal to zero. If they are, it means that all parentheses in the string are balanced and we would return 'Yes'. If they are not, it means that all parentheses in the string are not balanced and we would return 'No'.

Plan:
1. Initialize `open_parens` and `close_parens` to 0.
2. Iterate through all characters in the first string in the list.
3. If the character is an open parenthesis, increment `open_parens` by one.
4. If the character is a close parenthesis, check if `open_parens` is greater than zero. If it is, decrement `open_parens` by one. If it is not, increment `close_parens` by one.
5. Repeat steps 2-4 for the second string in the list.
6. Check if `open_parens` and `close_parens` are both equal to zero. If they are, return 'Yes'. If they are not, return 'No'.

Let's implement this now.

Implementation:

```python
def match_parens(lst):
    open_parens = 0
    close_parens = 0

    for string in lst:
        for char in string:
            if char == '(':
                open_parens += 1
            elif char == ')':
                if open_parens > 0:
                    open_parens -= 1
                else:
                    close_parens += 1

    return 'Yes' if open_parens == 0 and close_parens == 0 else 'No'
```

This function works by counting the number of open and close parentheses in the strings and checking if they are balanced. If they are, it returns 'Yes'. If they are not, it returns 'No'.
