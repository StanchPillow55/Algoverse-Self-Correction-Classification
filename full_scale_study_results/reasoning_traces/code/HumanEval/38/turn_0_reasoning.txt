==================================================

The problem is asking to implement a function that decodes a string that was encoded using the encode_cyclic function. The encode_cyclic function takes a string, splits it into groups of three characters, and then cycles the characters in each group. If a group has fewer than three characters, it leaves the group as it is. The cycling operation takes the first character of the group and moves it to the end of the group.

To decode the string, we need to reverse the operation done by the encode_cyclic function. This means that we need to take the last character of each group and move it to the beginning of the group. If a group has fewer than three characters, we leave it as it is.

Here is the implementation of the decode_cyclic function:

```python
def decode_cyclic(s: str):
    """
    takes as input string encoded with encode_cyclic function. Returns decoded string.
    """
    # split string to groups. Each of length 3.
    groups = [s[(3 * i):min((3 * i + 3), len(s))] for i in range((len(s) + 2) // 3)]
    # cycle elements in each group in reverse. Unless group has fewer elements than 3.
    groups = [(group[-1] + group[:-1]) if len(group) == 3 else group for group in groups]
    return "".join(groups)
```

This function first splits the input string into groups of three characters. Then, for each group, it checks if the group has three characters. If it does, it takes the last character of the group and moves it to the beginning of the group. If the group has fewer than three characters, it leaves the group as it is. Finally, it joins all the groups together into a single string and returns it.
