Reasoning:

The problem is asking to implement two functions, encode_cyclic and decode_cyclic. The encode_cyclic function takes a string as input and encodes it by cycling groups of three characters. This means that for every three characters in the string, the first character is moved to the end of the group. If the group has fewer than three characters, it remains the same.

The decode_cyclic function is supposed to do the opposite of encode_cyclic. It takes an encoded string as input and decodes it to get the original string. This means that for every group of three characters, the last character is moved to the beginning of the group. If the group has fewer than three characters, it remains the same.

Approach:

For the encode_cyclic function, we first split the string into groups of three characters. We then cycle the elements in each group, unless the group has fewer than three characters. We do this by slicing the group from the second character to the end and appending the first character to the end. We then join the groups back together to get the encoded string.

For the decode_cyclic function, we do the opposite. We first split the encoded string into groups of three characters. We then cycle the elements in each group, unless the group has fewer than three characters. We do this by slicing the group from the first character to the second last and prepending the last character to the beginning. We then join the groups back together to get the decoded string.

Implementation:

Here is the Python code for the decode_cyclic function:

```python
def decode_cyclic(s: str):
    """
    takes as input string encoded with encode_cyclic function. Returns decoded string.
    """
    # split string to groups. Each of length 3.
    groups = [s[(3 * i):min((3 * i + 3), len(s))] for i in range((len(s) + 2) // 3)]
    # cycle elements in each group. Unless group has fewer elements than 3.
    groups = [(group[-1] + group[:-1]) if len(group) == 3 else group for group in groups]
    return "".join(groups)
```

This function works by first splitting the string into groups of three characters. It then cycles the elements in each group, unless the group has fewer than three characters. It does this by slicing the group from the first character to the second last and prepending the last character to the beginning. It then joins the groups back together to get the decoded string.
