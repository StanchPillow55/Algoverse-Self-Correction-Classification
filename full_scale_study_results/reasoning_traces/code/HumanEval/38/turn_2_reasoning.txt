==================================================

The problem is asking to implement two functions. The first function, `encode_cyclic`, takes a string and encodes it by cycling groups of three characters. The second function, `decode_cyclic`, takes an encoded string and decodes it back to the original string.

Let's first understand how the `encode_cyclic` function works. It splits the input string into groups of three characters. Then, it cycles the characters in each group. For example, if we have a group "abc", it becomes "bca" after cycling. If a group has fewer than three characters, it remains the same.

The `decode_cyclic` function should reverse the operation of the `encode_cyclic` function. That is, it should take the encoded string and return the original string. To do this, we need to reverse the cycling operation. If we have a group "bca", it should become "abc" after decoding. If a group has fewer than three characters, it remains the same.

Here is the implementation of the `decode_cyclic` function:

```python
def decode_cyclic(s: str):
    """
    takes as input string encoded with encode_cyclic function. Returns decoded string.
    """
    # split string to groups. Each of length 3.
    groups = [s[(3 * i):min((3 * i + 3), len(s))] for i in range((len(s) + 2) // 3)]
    # reverse cycle elements in each group. Unless group has fewer elements than 3.
    groups = [(group[-1] + group[:-1]) if len(group) == 3 else group for group in groups]
    return "".join(groups)
```

In this function, we first split the input string into groups of three characters. Then, we reverse the cycling operation for each group. If a group has three characters, we move the last character to the front. If a group has fewer than three characters, it remains the same. Finally, we join the groups back into a single string and return it.
