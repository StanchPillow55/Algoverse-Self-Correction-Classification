==================================================

Reasoning:

Given a list of deposit and withdrawal operations, we are to determine if at any point in time the balance of the account falls below zero. We can obtain a solution for this by performing the following steps:
1. Initialize a variable `balance` to keep track of the current balance of the account. Set it to 0 since the account starts with zero balance.
2. Iterate through the list of operations. For each operation, add the operation to the `balance`.
3. Check if the `balance` is less than 0 after each operation. If it is, return `True` because the balance has fallen below zero.
4. If after iterating through all the operations the balance never falls below zero, return `False`.

Now let's implement this in code.

Implementation:

```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    balance = 0
    for operation in operations:
        balance += operation
        if balance < 0:
            return True
    return False
```

This function works by keeping track of the balance and checking after each operation if the balance has fallen below zero. If it has, it immediately returns `True`. If it gets through all the operations without the balance ever falling below zero, it returns `False`.
