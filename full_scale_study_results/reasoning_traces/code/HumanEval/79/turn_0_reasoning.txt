==================================================

The problem is asking to convert a decimal number to binary and return the binary number as a string with 'db' at the beginning and end of the string.

To solve the problem I will use the following steps
- Convert the decimal number to binary using the built-in bin() function in python. The bin() function converts the decimal number to binary and returns the binary number as a string. The string starts with '0b' to indicate that it is a binary number.
- Remove the '0b' from the beginning of the string using string slicing.
- Add 'db' at the beginning and end of the string.

Let's write the code now.

```python
def decimal_to_binary(decimal):
    binary = bin(decimal)[2:] # Convert to binary and remove '0b'
    return 'db' + binary + 'db' # Add 'db' at the beginning and end
```

Let's test the function with the sample testcases

```python
assert decimal_to_binary(15) == "db1111db"
assert decimal_to_binary(32) == "db100000db"
```

The function passes the sample testcases.
