==================================================

First, let's break down the problem and understand what we need to do.

We are given two planet names and we need to return a tuple of all the planets that are located between these two planets. The planets should be sorted by their proximity to the sun. If either of the input planet names is not a valid planet name, we should return an empty tuple.

To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:

1. Define a list of all the planets in order, starting from the one closest to the sun.
2. Check if both input planet names are in the list of planets. If not, return an empty tuple.
3. Find the indices of the two input planets in the list.
4. Slice the list to get all the planets between these two indices.
5. Sort the sliced list by their proximity to the sun, which is the same as their order in the original list.
6. Convert the list to a tuple and return it.

Now, let's implement this in code.

```python
def bf(planet1, planet2):
    # Define the list of planets in order
    planets = ["Mercury", "Venus", "Earth", "Mars", "Jupiter", "Saturn", "Uranus", "Neptune"]
    
    # Check if both planet names are valid
    if planet1 not in planets or planet2 not in planets:
        return ()
    
    # Find the indices of the two planets
    index1 = planets.index(planet1)
    index2 = planets.index(planet2)
    
    # Make sure index1 is less than index2
    if index1 > index2:
        index1, index2 = index2, index1
    
    # Get the planets between the two indices
    between_planets = planets[index1+1:index2]
    
    # Convert the list to a tuple and return it
    return tuple(between_planets)
```

This function should solve the problem as described. It first checks if the input planet names are valid, then finds their indices in the list of planets. It then slices the list to get the planets between these two indices and returns them as a tuple.
