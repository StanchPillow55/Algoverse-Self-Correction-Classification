The problem is asking to determine if a given number can be written as the sum of exactly 4 positive even numbers. 

First, let's consider the smallest possible even number, which is 2. If we need to sum exactly 4 positive even numbers, the smallest possible sum would be 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 8. Therefore, any number less than 8 cannot be written as the sum of exactly 4 positive even numbers.

Next, let's consider the nature of even numbers. The sum of any two even numbers is always even. Therefore, the sum of any four even numbers will also be even. This means that any odd number cannot be written as the sum of exactly 4 positive even numbers.

So, our function needs to return False for any number less than 8 or any odd number. For any other number (an even number that is 8 or greater), it can be written as the sum of exactly 4 positive even numbers, so our function should return True.

Here is the Python function that implements this logic:

```python
def is_equal_to_sum_even(n):
    """Evaluate whether the given number n can be written as the sum of exactly 4 positive even numbers"""
    if n < 8 or n % 2 != 0:
        return False
    else:
        return True
```

This function first checks if the input number `n` is less than 8 or odd (i.e., `n % 2 != 0`). If either of these conditions is True, the function returns False. Otherwise, it returns True.
