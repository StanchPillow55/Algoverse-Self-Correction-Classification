Reasoning:

Given two lists, we are to determine if we can exchange elements between the two lists such that the first list contains only even numbers. We can obtain a solution for this by performing the following steps:
1. First, we would iterate through all the elements in the first list and count the number of odd numbers in the list.
2. Next, we would iterate through all the elements in the second list and count the number of even numbers in the list.
3. If the count of odd numbers in the first list is less than or equal to the count of even numbers in the second list, we would return "YES". This is because we can replace all the odd numbers in the first list with the even numbers in the second list. 
4. If the count of odd numbers in the first list is greater than the count of even numbers in the second list, we would return "NO". This is because we cannot replace all the odd numbers in the first list with the even numbers in the second list as there are not enough even numbers in the second list to replace all the odd numbers in the first list.

Let's implement this.

Implementation:

def exchange(lst1, lst2):
    # count the number of odd numbers in the first list
    odd_count_lst1 = sum(1 for num in lst1 if num % 2 != 0)
    
    # count the number of even numbers in the second list
    even_count_lst2 = sum(1 for num in lst2 if num % 2 == 0)
    
    # check if the count of odd numbers in the first list is less than or equal to the count of even numbers in the second list
    if odd_count_lst1 <= even_count_lst2:
        return "YES"
    else:
        return "NO"
