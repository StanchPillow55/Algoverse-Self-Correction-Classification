Reasoning:

The problem is asking to convert a given string into its MD5 hash equivalent. MD5 (Message-Digest algorithm 5) is a widely used cryptographic hash function that produces a 128-bit (16-byte) hash value. It is commonly used to verify data integrity. MD5 has been utilized in a wide variety of security applications and is also commonly used to check the integrity of files. However, MD5 is not collision-resistant; as of 2012, a group of researchers have been able to generate the same MD5 hash for different inputs.

The Python standard library provides a hashlib module which contains interfaces to many different secure hash and message digest algorithms. We can use the md5() function provided by this module to solve this problem.

The md5() function takes a bytes-like object as input and returns a new md5 hash object. We can then use the hexdigest() method of this object to get the hexadecimal representation of the hash.

If the input string is empty, we should return None as per the problem statement.

Approach:

1. Check if the input string is empty. If it is, return None.
2. If the string is not empty, convert it to bytes using the encode() method, because the md5() function requires a bytes-like object as input.
3. Pass the bytes-like object to the md5() function to get a new md5 hash object.
4. Use the hexdigest() method of the md5 hash object to get the hexadecimal representation of the hash.
5. Return the hexadecimal representation.

Implementation:

Here is the Python function that implements the above approach: 

```python
import hashlib

def string_to_md5(text):
    """
    Given a string 'text', return its md5 hash equivalent string.
    If 'text' is an empty string, return None.
    """
    if text == '':
        return None
    else:
        return hashlib.md5(text.encode()).hexdigest()
```

This function first checks if the input string is empty. If it is, it returns None. Otherwise, it converts the string to bytes using the encode() method, passes the bytes-like object to the md5() function to get a new md5 hash object, and then uses the hexdigest() method of the md5 hash object to get the hexadecimal representation of the hash. The hexadecimal representation is then returned.
