Reasoning:

MD5 (Message Digest Algorithm 5) is a widely used cryptographic hash function that produces a 128-bit (16-byte) hash value. It is commonly used to verify data integrity. MD5 has been utilized in a wide variety of security applications and is also commonly used to check the integrity of files. However, MD5 is not collision-resistant; as of 2012, researchers have shown that a collision can be found in less than a minute of computation.

In Python, the hashlib module provides a variety of different secure hash and message digest algorithms, including MD5. We can use this module to compute the MD5 hash of the input string.

To solve this problem, we will:

1. Check if the input string is empty. If it is, we will return None.
2. If the input string is not empty, we will use the hashlib.md5() function to compute the MD5 hash of the string.
3. The hashlib.md5() function returns a hash object. We can use the .hexdigest() method of this object to get the hexadecimal representation of the hash.
4. Finally, we will return this hexadecimal representation of the hash.

Implementation:

Here is the Python function that implements the above approach:

```python
import hashlib

def string_to_md5(text):
    """
    Given a string 'text', return its md5 hash equivalent string.
    If 'text' is an empty string, return None.
    """
    if text == '':
        return None
    else:
        md5_hash = hashlib.md5()
        md5_hash.update(text.encode('utf-8'))
        return md5_hash.hexdigest()
```

In this function, we first import the hashlib module. Then, in the string_to_md5 function, we check if the input string is empty. If it is, we return None. If it is not, we create a new MD5 hash object, update it with the input string (which we first encode to bytes using the .encode() method), and then return the hexadecimal representation of the hash using the .hexdigest() method.
