==================================================

The problem is asking to check if the given string of brackets is correctly bracketed. This means that every opening bracket "(" should have a corresponding closing bracket ")" and they should be in the correct order. 

To solve this problem, we can use a stack data structure. A stack is a collection of elements, with two main principal operations: push, which adds an element to the collection, and pop, which removes the most recently added element that was not yet removed. 

The algorithm works as follows:

1. Initialize an empty stack.
2. Iterate over the string of brackets from left to right.
3. If the current bracket is an opening bracket "(", push it into the stack.
4. If the current bracket is a closing bracket ")", check if the stack is empty. If the stack is empty, return False because there is no corresponding opening bracket for this closing bracket. If the stack is not empty, pop the top element from the stack.
5. After iterating over all the brackets, check if the stack is empty. If the stack is empty, return True because all opening brackets have a corresponding closing bracket. If the stack is not empty, return False because there are some opening brackets that do not have a corresponding closing bracket.

Let's implement this algorithm in Python.

```python
def correct_bracketing(brackets: str) -> bool:
    stack = []
    for bracket in brackets:
        if bracket == "(":
            stack.append(bracket)
        elif bracket == ")":
            if not stack:
                return False
            stack.pop()
    return not stack
```

This function correctly checks if the given string of brackets is correctly bracketed. It uses a stack to keep track of the opening brackets and checks if there is a corresponding closing bracket for each opening bracket. The time complexity of this function is O(n), where n is the length of the string of brackets, because it iterates over the string once. The space complexity is also O(n), because in the worst case scenario (when all brackets are opening brackets), the function pushes all brackets into the stack.
