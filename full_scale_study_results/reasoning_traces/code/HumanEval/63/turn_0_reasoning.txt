==================================================

The problem is asking to implement a function that calculates the n-th element of the FibFib sequence. The FibFib sequence is similar to the Fibonacci sequence, but it has a different base case and recurrence relation. The base case is defined as fibfib(0) == 0, fibfib(1) == 0, and fibfib(2) == 1. The recurrence relation is defined as fibfib(n) == fibfib(n-1) + fibfib(n-2) + fibfib(n-3).

The naive approach to solve this problem is to use recursion directly. However, this approach is very inefficient because it has a time complexity of O(3^n), which is due to the fact that each function call branches into three new function calls.

A more efficient approach is to use dynamic programming to store the results of the subproblems, so that each subproblem is only solved once. This approach has a time complexity of O(n), which is much more efficient than the naive approach.

Here is the Python code that implements the dynamic programming approach:

```python
def fibfib(n: int) -> int:
    if n < 0:
        raise ValueError("n must be a non-negative integer")
    elif n == 0 or n == 1:
        return 0
    elif n == 2:
        return 1
    else:
        fibfib_sequence = [0, 0, 1] + [0] * (n - 2)
        for i in range(3, n + 1):
            fibfib_sequence[i] = fibfib_sequence[i - 1] + fibfib_sequence[i - 2] + fibfib_sequence[i - 3]
        return fibfib_sequence[n]
```

This function first checks if the input n is a non-negative integer. If n is less than 0, it raises a ValueError. If n is 0 or 1, it returns 0. If n is 2, it returns 1. If n is greater than 2, it creates a list to store the FibFib sequence, initializes the first three elements of the list according to the base case, and then calculates the rest of the elements of the list according to the recurrence relation. Finally, it returns the n-th element of the list.
