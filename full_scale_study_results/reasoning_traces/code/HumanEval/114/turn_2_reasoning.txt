==================================================

To solve the problem of finding the minimum sum of any non-empty sub-array in a given array of integers, we can use a variation of Kadane's algorithm. Kadane's algorithm is typically used to find the maximum sum of a sub-array, but we can adapt it to find the minimum sum instead.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to find the minimum sum of any non-empty sub-array in the given list of integers.
   - A sub-array is a contiguous part of the array, meaning the elements are consecutive.

2. **Examples Analysis:**
   - For `minSubArraySum([2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 4])`, the minimum sum sub-array is `[1]`, which sums to `1`.
   - For `minSubArraySum([-1, -2, -3])`, the minimum sum sub-array is the entire array `[-1, -2, -3]`, which sums to `-6`.

3. **Approach:**
   - We will iterate through the array while maintaining a running sum of the current sub-array.
   - If the running sum becomes greater than the current element, we reset the running sum to the current element. This is because starting a new sub-array at the current element might yield a smaller sum.
   - We will also keep track of the minimum sum encountered during the iteration.

4. **Algorithm:**
   - Initialize `min_sum` to a large positive value (or infinity) to ensure any sub-array sum will be smaller initially.
   - Initialize `current_sum` to 0.
   - Iterate through each element in the array:
     - Update `current_sum` to be the minimum of the current element or `current_sum + current element`. This step ensures we are always considering the smallest possible sub-array sum ending at the current element.
     - Update `min_sum` to be the minimum of `min_sum` and `current_sum`.
   - After iterating through the array, `min_sum` will hold the minimum sum of any sub-array.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - If the array contains only one element, the minimum sum is the element itself.
   - If all elements are positive, the minimum sum will be the smallest element.
   - If all elements are negative, the minimum sum will be the sum of the entire array.

### Implementation:

```python
def minSubArraySum(nums):
    if not nums:
        raise ValueError("The input array cannot be empty")
    
    min_sum = float('inf')
    current_sum = 0
    
    for num in nums:
        current_sum = min(num, current_sum + num)
        min_sum = min(min_sum, current_sum)
    
    return min_sum

# Test cases
print(minSubArraySum([2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 4]))  # Output: 1
print(minSubArraySum([-1, -2, -3]))        # Output: -6
```

This function efficiently finds the minimum sum of any non-empty sub-array using a single pass through the array, making it O(n) in time complexity. The space complexity is O(1) since we are using a constant amount of extra space.
