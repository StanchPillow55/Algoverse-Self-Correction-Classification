==================================================

Reasoning:

The problem is asking to find the minimum sum of any non-empty sub-array of the given array. A sub-array is a contiguous part of an array. The minimum sum of a sub-array can be a single element if it is the smallest, or it can be the sum of multiple elements if they are negative (since the sum of negative numbers is smaller than any single negative number).

Approach:

1. Initialize a variable min_sum with the first element of the array.
2. Initialize a variable current_sum also with the first element of the array.
3. Iterate over the array starting from the second element.
4. For each element, update current_sum to be the maximum of the current element and the sum of current_sum and the current element. This is because if the current element is larger than the sum of current_sum and the current element, it means that starting a new sub-array from the current element will give a smaller sum.
5. Update min_sum to be the minimum of min_sum and current_sum.
6. Return min_sum.

This approach works because it considers all possible sub-arrays by keeping track of the current sum and the minimum sum. It uses the Kadane's algorithm which is a dynamic programming algorithm for finding the maximum (or minimum) sum of a contiguous subsequence in an array of integers.

Now let's implement this approach in code.

Implementation: 

```python
def minSubArraySum(nums):
    min_sum = nums[0]
    current_sum = nums[0]
    
    for num in nums[1:]:
        current_sum = min(num, current_sum + num)
        min_sum = min(min_sum, current_sum)
        
    return min_sum
```

This function works by iterating over the array and for each element, it updates the current sum and the minimum sum. It returns the minimum sum which is the minimum sum of any non-empty sub-array of the given array.
