Reasoning:

A sub-array is a contiguous part of an array. The problem is asking to find the minimum sum of any non-empty sub-array. The minimum sum of a sub-array can be a single element if it is the smallest in the array. 

The approach to solve this problem is simple. We just need to find the smallest element in the array. If the smallest element is negative, we need to check if there is a sub-array with a sum smaller than this element. This is because a sub-array with multiple negative numbers can have a sum smaller than a single negative number. 

To find the smallest sum of a sub-array, we can use the Kadane's algorithm. This algorithm is used for finding the maximum sum of a sub-array, but we can modify it to find the minimum sum. The idea is to keep track of the current sum and the minimum sum. If the current sum is greater than 0, we reset it to 0 because we are looking for the minimum sum. If the current sum is less than the minimum sum, we update the minimum sum.

Here is the step-by-step process:

1. Initialize min_sum and curr_sum to the first element of the array.
2. Iterate over the array starting from the second element.
3. For each element, add it to curr_sum.
4. If curr_sum is greater than 0, reset it to 0.
5. If curr_sum is less than min_sum, update min_sum.
6. Return min_sum.

Now let's implement this in Python.

Implementation:

```python
def minSubArraySum(nums):
    if not nums:
        return 0

    min_sum = curr_sum = nums[0]
    for num in nums[1:]:
        curr_sum = min(curr_sum + num, num)
        min_sum = min(min_sum, curr_sum)

    return min_sum
```

This function works for both positive and negative numbers. It returns 0 if the array is empty. The time complexity is O(n) where n is the length of the array, and the space complexity is O(1) because we only use a constant amount of space.
