Turn: 0
Dataset Type: code
==================================================

Reasoning:

Given two integers, we are to determine the product of the unit digits of the two integers. We can obtain a solution for this by performing the following steps:
1. Obtain the unit digit of the first integer by performing a modulo operation with 10 on the first integer.
2. Obtain the unit digit of the second integer by performing a modulo operation with 10 on the second integer.
3. Multiply the unit digit of the first integer and the unit digit of the second integer.

Implementation:

Now, let's implement the solution in Python.

```python
def multiply(a, b):
    # get the unit digit of the first integer
    unit_digit_a = abs(a) % 10

    # get the unit digit of the second integer
    unit_digit_b = abs(b) % 10

    # return the product of the unit digits
    return unit_digit_a * unit_digit_b
```

The abs() function is used to handle negative numbers, as the problem does not specify that the input will always be positive. The modulo operation (%) with 10 gives the last digit of a number, so we use it to get the unit digit of the integers. Then we simply multiply these unit digits and return the result.
