==================================================

Reasoning:

Given two integers, we are to determine the product of the unit digits of the two integers. We can obtain a solution for this by performing the following steps:
1. Extract the unit digit of the first integer by performing a modulo operation on the integer by 10
2. Extract the unit digit of the second integer by performing a modulo operation on the integer by 10
3. Multiply the unit digits of the two integers and return the result.

Implementation:

The Python function below implements the steps outlined above. It takes two integers as input, extracts the unit digits, multiplies them, and returns the result. 

```python
def multiply(a, b):
    # Extract the unit digit of the first integer
    unit_digit_a = abs(a) % 10

    # Extract the unit digit of the second integer
    unit_digit_b = abs(b) % 10

    # Multiply the unit digits and return the result
    return unit_digit_a * unit_digit_b
```

The function uses the modulo operator (%) to extract the unit digit of each integer. The modulo operation returns the remainder of the division of the number by the divisor. When the divisor is 10, the remainder is the unit digit of the number. 

The function uses the abs() function to ensure that the unit digit is always positive, even if the input integer is negative. This is because the problem statement does not specify how to handle negative numbers, and the unit digit of a negative number is typically considered to be the same as the unit digit of the corresponding positive number.

The function then multiplies the unit digits and returns the result.
