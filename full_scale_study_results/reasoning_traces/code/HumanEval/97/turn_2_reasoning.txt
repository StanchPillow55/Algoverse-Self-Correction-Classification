==================================================

Reasoning:

Given two integers, we are to determine the product of the unit digits of the two integers. We can obtain a solution for this by performing the following steps:
1. Extract the unit digit of the first integer by performing a modulo operation with 10
2. Extract the unit digit of the second integer by performing a modulo operation with 10
3. Multiply the unit digits of the two integers and return the result

Approach:

1. Extract the unit digit of the first integer by performing a modulo operation with 10
2. Extract the unit digit of the second integer by performing a modulo operation with 10
3. Multiply the unit digits of the two integers and return the result

Implementation:

Here is the Python function that implements the above approach:

```python
def multiply(a, b):
    # Extract the unit digit of the first integer
    unit_digit_a = abs(a) % 10

    # Extract the unit digit of the second integer
    unit_digit_b = abs(b) % 10

    # Multiply the unit digits and return the result
    return unit_digit_a * unit_digit_b
```

This function works by first extracting the unit digit of each input integer. This is done by taking the absolute value of the integer (to handle negative numbers) and then performing a modulo operation with 10. The modulo operation gives the remainder of the division of the integer by 10, which is the unit digit. The function then returns the product of the two unit digits.

The absolute value is used to handle negative numbers, because the unit digit of a negative number is the same as the unit digit of its absolute value. For example, the unit digit of -15 is 5, which is the same as the unit digit of 15.
