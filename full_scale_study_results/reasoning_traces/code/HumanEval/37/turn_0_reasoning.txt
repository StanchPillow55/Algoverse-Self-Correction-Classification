Reasoning:

The problem is asking to sort the elements at the even indices of the list. The elements at the odd indices should remain the same. 

To solve this problem, I will follow these steps:

1. First, I will create a new list that contains the elements at the even indices of the input list. 

2. I will sort this new list in ascending order.

3. Then, I will replace the elements at the even indices of the input list with the sorted elements. 

4. Finally, I will return the modified input list.

Implementation:

Here is the Python function that implements the above steps:

```python
def sort_even(l: list):
    # Step 1: Create a new list that contains the elements at the even indices of the input list.
    even_indices_elements = [l[i] for i in range(len(l)) if i % 2 == 0]
    
    # Step 2: Sort this new list in ascending order.
    even_indices_elements.sort()
    
    # Step 3: Replace the elements at the even indices of the input list with the sorted elements.
    for i in range(len(l)):
        if i % 2 == 0:
            l[i] = even_indices_elements.pop(0)
    
    # Step 4: Return the modified input list.
    return l
```

This function works by first extracting the elements at the even indices of the input list and sorting them. It then replaces the elements at the even indices of the input list with the sorted elements. The elements at the odd indices remain the same. The time complexity of this function is O(n log n) due to the sorting operation, where n is the length of the input list.
