Question ID: HumanEval/108
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: code
==================================================

The problem is asking to return the count of numbers in the given list where the sum of the digits is greater than 0. The problem also specifies that if a number is negative, then its first digit will be considered negative. 

For example, if we have a number -123, the sum of the digits will be -1+2+3 = 4. 

To solve the problem I will use the following steps:
- Initialize a counter to 0
- Iterate over the list of numbers
- For each number, convert it to a string to be able to iterate over the digits
- Initialize a sum variable to 0
- Iterate over the digits of the number
- If the number is negative and we are at the first digit, subtract the digit from the sum
- Otherwise, add the digit to the sum
- After calculating the sum of the digits for a number, if the sum is greater than 0, increment the counter
- Finally, return the counter

Now I will implement this in code. 

```python
def count_nums(arr):
    count = 0
    for num in arr:
        num_str = str(num)
        sum_digits = 0
        for i, digit in enumerate(num_str):
            if num < 0 and i == 1:  # the first digit of a negative number is '-'
                sum_digits -= int(digit)
            else:
                sum_digits += int(digit)
        if sum_digits > 0:
            count += 1
    return count
```

This function works by iterating over each number in the input list, converting it to a string, and then iterating over each character in the string. If the number is negative and we are at the first digit (which will be the '-' character), we subtract the digit from the sum. Otherwise, we add the digit to the sum. After calculating the sum of the digits for a number, if the sum is greater than 0, we increment the counter. Finally, we return the counter.
