Question ID: HumanEval/108
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: code
==================================================

The problem is asking to return the count of numbers in the given list where the sum of its digits is greater than 0. The problem also specifies that if a number is negative, its first digit should be considered as negative. 

For example, if the input list is [-1, 11, -11], the sum of digits for -1 is -1, for 11 is 2, and for -11 is -1+1=0. So, there is only one number (11) whose sum of digits is greater than 0. Hence, the function should return 1.

To solve this problem, I will use the following steps:
1. Initialize a counter to 0.
2. Iterate over each number in the input list.
3. Convert each number to a string to easily access its digits.
4. If the number is negative, I will consider its first digit as negative. To do this, I will check if the first character of the string is '-'.
5. Calculate the sum of the digits of the number.
6. If the sum is greater than 0, increment the counter.
7. Finally, return the counter.

Now, I will implement this approach in code.
