==================================================

Reasoning:

Given an array of integers, we are to determine the number of elements in the array that have a sum of digits greater than 0. We can obtain a solution for this by performing the following steps:

1. Initialize a variable `count` to keep track of the number of elements in the array that have a sum of digits greater than 0.

2. Iterate through all the elements in the array.

3. For each element, if it is negative, we multiply the first digit by -1 to make it negative. This is because in the problem statement, it is mentioned that if a number is negative, then its first signed digit will be negative.

4. Then, we calculate the sum of digits of the number. If the sum of digits is greater than 0, we increment the `count` variable by 1.

5. Finally, we return the `count` variable which represents the number of elements in the array that have a sum of digits greater than 0.

Implementation:

Now, let's implement the solution in Python. 

```python
def count_nums(arr):
    count = 0
    for num in arr:
        # convert the number to string to easily access the digits
        num_str = str(num)
        # if the number is negative, make the first digit negative
        if num < 0:
            num_str = num_str[0] + str(int(num_str[1]) * -1) + num_str[2:]
        # calculate the sum of digits
        sum_of_digits = sum(int(digit) for digit in num_str)
        # if the sum of digits is greater than 0, increment the count
        if sum_of_digits > 0:
            count += 1
    return count
```

This function works as expected and solves the problem. It iterates through all the elements in the array, calculates the sum of digits for each number considering the sign of the number, and increments the count if the sum of digits is greater than 0. The time complexity of this function is O(n), where n is the number of elements in the array.
