This problem is a classic example of a problem that can be solved using a stack data structure. The idea is to iterate through the string of brackets. Every time we encounter an opening bracket, we push it onto the stack. Every time we encounter a closing bracket, we check if the stack is empty. If it is, that means there's a closing bracket without a corresponding opening bracket, so we return False. If the stack isn't empty, we pop an opening bracket off the stack to match with the closing bracket. At the end of the string, if there are still opening brackets left on the stack, that means there are opening brackets without corresponding closing brackets, so we return False. If the stack is empty, that means every opening bracket had a corresponding closing bracket, so we return True.

Here is the Python code that implements this approach:

```python
def correct_bracketing(brackets: str) -> bool:
    stack = []
    for bracket in brackets:
        if bracket == '<':
            stack.append(bracket)
        elif bracket == '>':
            if not stack:
                return False
            stack.pop()
    return not stack
```

This function works by maintaining a stack of opening brackets. For each character in the input string, if the character is an opening bracket, it is pushed onto the stack. If the character is a closing bracket, the function checks if the stack is empty. If it is, that means there's a closing bracket without a corresponding opening bracket, so the function returns False. If the stack isn't empty, an opening bracket is popped off the stack to match with the closing bracket. After all characters in the string have been processed, the function checks if there are still opening brackets left on the stack. If there are, that means there are opening brackets without corresponding closing brackets, so the function returns False. If the stack is empty, that means every opening bracket had a corresponding closing bracket, so the function returns True.
