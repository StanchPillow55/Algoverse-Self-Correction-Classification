==================================================

The problem is asking to implement a function that sums all the numbers from 1 to n. 

To solve this problem, we can use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series. The formula is n*(n+1)/2, where n is the number of terms. This formula is derived from the fact that the sum of an arithmetic series is equal to the average of the first and last term, multiplied by the number of terms. 

In this case, the first term is 1 and the last term is n, so the sum is (1+n)*n/2. 

Here is the Python function that implements this:

```python
def sum_to_n(n: int) -> int:
    """sum_to_n is a function that sums numbers from 1 to n.
    """
    return n * (n + 1) // 2
```

This function takes an integer n as input and returns the sum of all integers from 1 to n. The sum is calculated using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series. The result is an integer, so we use integer division (//) to get an integer result. 

This function has a time complexity of O(1), because it performs a constant number of operations regardless of the size of the input. 

Let's test this function with the provided test cases:

```python
print(sum_to_n(30))  # Expected output: 465
print(sum_to_n(100))  # Expected output: 5050
print(sum_to_n(5))  # Expected output: 15
print(sum_to_n(10))  # Expected output: 55
print(sum_to_n(1))  # Expected output: 1
```

All of these should return the expected results.
