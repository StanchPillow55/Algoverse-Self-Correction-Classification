==================================================

First, let's understand the problem. We are given two positive integers a and b, and we need to return the even digits between a and b, in ascending order. If b is less than a, we still need to return the numbers in ascending order.

The problem is straightforward. We just need to iterate through the range from a to b, and check if the number is even. If it is, we add it to our result list. In the end, we return the result list.

However, there is a small catch. The problem statement says "return the even digits", not "return the even numbers". This means that we are interested in the numbers that consist only of even digits, not just the numbers that are even. For example, the number 12 is even, but it contains the odd digit 1, so it should not be included in the result. On the other hand, the number 20 is even and contains only even digits, so it should be included in the result.

To implement this, we can add an additional check in our loop. For each number, we convert it to a string, and check if all its digits are even. If they are, we add the number to our result list.

Here is the Python code that implements this approach:

```python
def generate_integers(a, b):
    # Initialize the result list
    result = []
    
    # Make sure a is less than or equal to b
    if a > b:
        a, b = b, a
    
    # Iterate through the range from a to b
    for i in range(a, b + 1):
        # Convert the number to a string
        str_i = str(i)
        
        # Check if all digits are even
        if all(int(digit) % 2 == 0 for digit in str_i):
            # If they are, add the number to the result list
            result.append(i)
    
    # Return the result list
    return result
```

This function works by first ensuring that a is less than or equal to b. Then, it iterates through the range from a to b, and for each number, it checks if all its digits are even. If they are, it adds the number to the result list. Finally, it returns the result list.
