Reasoning:

The problem is asking to return a list of even numbers between two given positive integers a and b. The order of a and b does not matter, the function should return the same output for (a, b) and (b, a). 

The problem can be solved by following these steps:

1. Check if a is greater than b. If it is, swap the values of a and b. This ensures that a is always less than or equal to b, which simplifies the following steps.

2. Initialize an empty list to store the even numbers.

3. Iterate over the range from a to b (inclusive). For each number in this range, check if it is even. If it is, append it to the list of even numbers.

4. Return the list of even numbers.

Note that a number is even if it is divisible by 2. This can be checked using the modulo operator (%). If a number x is even, then x % 2 will be 0.

Here is the Python function that implements this approach:

```python
def generate_integers(a, b):
    # Ensure that a is less than or equal to b
    if a > b:
        a, b = b, a

    # Initialize the list of even numbers
    even_numbers = []

    # Iterate over the range from a to b (inclusive)
    for i in range(a, b + 1):
        # Check if the current number is even
        if i % 2 == 0:
            # If it is, append it to the list of even numbers
            even_numbers.append(i)

    # Return the list of even numbers
    return even_numbers
```

This function should solve the problem as described. It has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the difference between a and b. This is because it needs to iterate over all numbers in this range. The space complexity is also O(n), because in the worst case (when all numbers in the range are even), the function needs to store all of these numbers in the list of even numbers.
