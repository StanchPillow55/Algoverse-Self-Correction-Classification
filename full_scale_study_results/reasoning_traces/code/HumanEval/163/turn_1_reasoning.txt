Dataset Type: code
==================================================

The problem is asking to return a list of even numbers between two given numbers a and b. The list should be in ascending order. If the second number is smaller than the first one, we should still return the numbers in ascending order. If there are no even numbers between the two given numbers, we should return an empty list.

To solve the problem I will use the following steps
- First, I will check if the first number is greater than the second number. If it is, I will swap the two numbers. This is because we always want to generate numbers in ascending order.
- Then, I will create an empty list to store the even numbers.
- I will iterate through the range from the first number to the second number inclusive.
- For each number in the range, I will check if it is even. If it is, I will add it to the list.
- Finally, I will return the list of even numbers.

Now I will implement this in code.

Here is the Python function:

```python
def generate_integers(a, b):
    # If a is greater than b, swap them
    if a > b:
        a, b = b, a

    # Create an empty list to store the even numbers
    even_numbers = []

    # Iterate through the range from a to b inclusive
    for i in range(a, b + 1):
        # If the number is even, add it to the list
        if i % 2 == 0:
            even_numbers.append(i)

    # Return the list of even numbers
    return even_numbers
```

This function should solve the problem as described. It iterates through the range from a to b inclusive, checking each number to see if it is even. If it is, it adds it to the list. It then returns the list of even numbers. If there are no even numbers in the range, it will return an empty list.
