Question ID: HumanEval/134
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: code
==================================================

Reasoning:

Given a string, we are to determine if the last character of the string is an alphabetical character and is not part of a word. We can obtain a solution for this by performing the following steps: 
- First, we would check if the string is empty. If it is, we would return False
- Next, we would check if the last character of the string is a space. If it is, we would return False
- Finally, we would check if the last character of the string is an alphabetical character. If it is, we would return True, else we would return False

Implementation:

Now we would implement the steps outlined above in python:

```python
def check_if_last_char_is_a_letter(txt):
    # check if string is empty
    if txt == "":
        return False

    # check if last character is a space
    if txt[-1] == " ":
        return False

    # check if last character is an alphabetical character
    if txt[-1].isalpha():
        return True

    return False
```

Testing:

We would now test the function `check_if_last_char_is_a_letter` with some test cases:

```python
print(check_if_last_char_is_a_letter("apple pie")) # Expected output False
print(check_if_last_char_is_a_letter("apple pi e")) # Expected output True
print(check_if_last_char_is_a_letter("apple pi e ")) # Expected output False
print(check_if_last_char_is_a_letter("")) # Expected output False
```

The function `check_if_last_char_is_a_letter` should pass all the test cases.
