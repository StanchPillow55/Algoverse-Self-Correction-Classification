==================================================

The problem is asking to return True if the last character of the given string is an alphabetical character and is not a part of a word, and False otherwise.

To solve the problem I will use the following steps
- First, I will check if the given string is empty or not. If it is empty I will return False.
- Then I will remove the trailing spaces from the given string using the rstrip() method.
- After that, I will check if the last character of the string is an alphabetical character or not. If it is not an alphabetical character I will return False.
- Then I will check if the second last character of the string is a space or not. If it is a space I will return True, because it means the last character is not a part of a word. If it is not a space I will return False, because it means the last character is a part of a word.

Now I will implement this in code.

```python
def check_if_last_char_is_a_letter(txt):
    if txt == "":
        return False
    txt = txt.rstrip()
    if not txt[-1].isalpha():
        return False
    if txt[-2] == " ":
        return True
    return False
```

This function works as follows:
- First, it checks if the input string is empty. If it is, it returns False.
- Then, it removes any trailing spaces from the string.
- It then checks if the last character of the string is a letter. If it's not, it returns False.
- Finally, it checks if the second last character of the string is a space. If it is, it returns True, because it means the last character is not a part of a word. If it's not, it returns False, because it means the last character is a part of a word.
