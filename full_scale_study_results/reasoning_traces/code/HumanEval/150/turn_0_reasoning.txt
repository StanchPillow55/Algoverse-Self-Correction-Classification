Reasoning:

The problem is asking to return the value of x if the given number n is a prime number and return the value of y if the given number n is not a prime number.

A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. The first few prime numbers are {2, 3, 5, 7, 11, â€¦}.

So, to solve the problem I will use the following steps:

- First, I will check if the given number n is less than 2. If it is, I will return y because there are no prime numbers less than 2.
- Then, I will check if the given number n is 2. If it is, I will return x because 2 is a prime number.
- If the given number n is not less than 2 and it is not 2, I will check if it is divisible by any number from 2 to the square root of n. If it is divisible, I will return y because n is not a prime number.
- If the given number n is not divisible by any number from 2 to the square root of n, I will return x because n is a prime number.

Now, I will implement this in the function.

Implementation:

Here is the Python function that implements the above approach:

```python
import math

def x_or_y(n, x, y):
    if n < 2:
        return y
    elif n == 2:
        return x
    else:
        for i in range(2, math.isqrt(n) + 1):
            if n % i == 0:
                return y
        return x
```

In this function, I used the math.isqrt() function to get the integer square root of n. This function is available in Python 3.8 and later. If you are using an earlier version of Python, you can use int(math.sqrt(n)) instead.
