==================================================

The problem is asking to return the value of x if the given number n is a prime number and return the value of y if the given number n is not a prime number.

A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. The first few prime numbers are {2, 3, 5, 7, 11, â€¦.}.

To solve the problem I will use the following steps
- First, I will check if the given number n is less than 2, if it is I will return the value of y because there is no prime number less than 2.
- If the given number n is greater than or equal to 2, I will check if the number is divisible by any number from 2 to the square root of n. If it is divisible, I will return the value of y because it is not a prime number.
- If the given number n is not divisible by any number from 2 to the square root of n, I will return the value of x because it is a prime number.

Now I will start implementing the function.

```python
import math

def x_or_y(n, x, y):
    if n < 2:
        return y
    for i in range(2, math.isqrt(n) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return y
    return x
```

In the function above, I used the `math.isqrt(n)` function to get the integer part of the square root of n. This is because we only need to check divisibility up to the square root of n to determine if n is prime. If n is divisible by any number greater than its square root, then it must also be divisible by a number smaller than its square root, so we don't need to check the larger numbers. This optimization reduces the time complexity of the function from O(n) to O(sqrt(n)), making it more efficient for large inputs.
