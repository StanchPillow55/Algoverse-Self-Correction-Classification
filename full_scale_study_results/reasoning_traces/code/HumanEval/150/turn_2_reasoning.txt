==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to create a function that checks if a number is prime and then use that function in our x_or_y function to determine which value to return.

A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. The first few prime numbers are {2, 3, 5, 7, 11, â€¦}.

To check if a number is prime, we can use the following steps:

1. If the number is less than 2, it is not prime.
2. If the number is 2, it is prime.
3. For numbers greater than 2, we check if the number can be divided evenly by any number from 2 to the square root of the number. If it can, it is not prime. If it can't, it is prime.

We use the square root of the number as the upper limit of our range because a larger factor of the number would be a multiple of smaller factor that has already been checked.

Once we have our function to check if a number is prime, we can use it in our x_or_y function. If the number is prime, we return x. If it is not prime, we return y.

Here is the Python code that implements this:

```python
import math

def is_prime(n):
    """Check if a number is prime."""
    if n < 2:
        return False
    if n == 2:
        return True
    if n % 2 == 0:
        return False
    sqrt_n = math.isqrt(n)
    for i in range(3, sqrt_n + 1, 2):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

def x_or_y(n, x, y):
    """Return x if n is prime, y otherwise."""
    if is_prime(n):
        return x
    else:
        return y
```

This code should solve the problem as described. It checks if a number is prime and returns the appropriate value based on that.
