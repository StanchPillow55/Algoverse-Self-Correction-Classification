The problem is asking to return a list of integers sorted in a specific way. The sorting should start with the smallest integer, then the largest of the remaining integers, then the smallest of the remaining integers, and so on.

Here is how I would approach this problem:

1. First, I would sort the list in ascending order. This would make it easier to find the smallest and largest integers.

2. Then, I would create an empty list to store the sorted integers.

3. I would then use a while loop to repeatedly find and remove the smallest and largest integers from the sorted list, and add them to the new list. The loop would continue until the sorted list is empty.

4. Finally, I would return the new list.

Here is the Python code that implements this approach:

```python
def strange_sort_list(lst):
    # Sort the list in ascending order
    lst.sort()
    
    # Create an empty list to store the sorted integers
    sorted_lst = []
    
    # Use a while loop to repeatedly find and remove the smallest and largest integers
    while lst:
        # Add the smallest integer to the sorted list
        sorted_lst.append(lst.pop(0))
        
        # If there are still integers left, add the largest integer to the sorted list
        if lst:
            sorted_lst.append(lst.pop(-1))
    
    # Return the sorted list
    return sorted_lst
```

This function works by repeatedly removing the smallest and largest integers from the sorted list and adding them to the new list. The `pop(0)` method removes and returns the first element of the list (which is the smallest integer), and the `pop(-1)` method removes and returns the last element of the list (which is the largest integer). The while loop continues until the sorted list is empty, which means all integers have been sorted.
