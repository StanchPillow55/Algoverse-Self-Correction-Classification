==================================================

Reasoning:

Given two strings `s` and `c`, we are to determine if after deleting all the characters in `s` that are equal to any character in `c`, the resulting string is a palindrome. A string is a palindrome if it reads the same forward as backward. We can obtain a solution for this by performing the following steps:

1. Initialize a variable `result` to store the string `s` after deleting all characters in `s` that are equal to any character in `c`. We can obtain this by using a list comprehension to iterate through all the characters in `s` and only keep the characters that are not in `c`.

2. Next, we would check if the `result` string is a palindrome. We can do this by comparing the `result` string with its reverse. If they are the same, then the `result` string is a palindrome.

3. Finally, we would return a tuple containing the `result` string and a boolean value indicating whether or not the `result` string is a palindrome.

Implementation:

Now we would implement the plan in python: 

```python
def reverse_delete(s,c):
    # step 1
    result = ''.join([i for i in s if i not in c])
    
    # step 2
    is_palindrome = result == result[::-1]
    
    # step 3
    return (result, is_palindrome)
```

The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the string `s`. This is because we are iterating through each character in `s` once. The space complexity is also O(n), as we are storing the `result` string, which can be as long as `s` in the worst case scenario.
