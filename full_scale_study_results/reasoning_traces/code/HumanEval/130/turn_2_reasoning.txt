==================================================

The problem is asking to return a list of the first n + 1 numbers of the Tribonacci sequence. The Tribonacci sequence is defined by the recurrence:

- tri(1) = 3
- tri(n) = 1 + n / 2, if n is even.
- tri(n) =  tri(n - 1) + tri(n - 2) + tri(n + 1), if n is odd.

The sequence starts from index 1, not 0. The sequence is defined for n >= 1, and the sequence is defined differently for even and odd n. 

To solve the problem, I will use the following steps:
- Initialize a list to store the Tribonacci sequence. The list will start with [1, 3] because tri(1) = 3 and we know that for n = 2, tri(n) = 1 + n / 2 = 2.
- Then, for each number from 2 to n, calculate the next number in the sequence based on whether the current number is even or odd.
- If the number is even, calculate the next number as 1 + n / 2.
- If the number is odd, calculate the next number as the sum of the previous two numbers and the next number in the sequence.
- Add the calculated number to the list.
- Finally, return the list.

Let's implement this now.
