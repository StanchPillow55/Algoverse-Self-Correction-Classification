The problem is asking to generate the first n + 1 numbers of the Tribonacci sequence. The Tribonacci sequence is defined as follows:

- tri(1) = 3
- tri(n) = 1 + n / 2, if n is even.
- tri(n) =  tri(n - 1) + tri(n - 2) + tri(n + 1), if n is odd.

The sequence starts from 1, so the index n is 1-based.

The first step is to handle the base case. If n is 1, we return [3] as the sequence.

Next, we create a list to store the sequence. We initialize it with [3] because we know that the first element is always 3.

Then, we start a loop from 2 to n + 1. For each number i, we check if it is even or odd.

- If it is even, we calculate tri(i) as 1 + i / 2, and append it to the sequence.
- If it is odd, we calculate tri(i) as tri(i - 1) + tri(i - 2) + tri(i + 1). However, tri(i + 1) is not yet calculated at this point. So we need to calculate it first, and then use it to calculate tri(i). To do this, we can use a recursive function.

Finally, we return the sequence.

Here is the Python code that implements this approach:

```python
def tri(n):
    if n == 1:
        return [3]
    
    sequence = [3]
    
    def calculate(i):
        if i % 2 == 0:
            return 1 + i / 2
        else:
            if i + 1 > len(sequence):
                sequence.append(calculate(i + 1))
            return sequence[i - 2] + sequence[i - 3] + sequence[i]
    
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        sequence.append(calculate(i))
    
    return sequence
```

This function works, but it is not efficient because it calculates the same values multiple times. To improve the efficiency, we can use dynamic programming to store the calculated values and reuse them. Here is the improved version:

```python
def tri(n):
    if n == 1:
        return [3]
    
    sequence = [3]
    
    def calculate(i):
        if i % 2 == 0:
            return 1 + i / 2
        else:
            while i + 1 > len(sequence):
                sequence.append(calculate(len(sequence) + 1))
            return sequence[i - 2] + sequence[i - 3] + sequence[i]
    
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        sequence.append(calculate(i))
    
    return sequence
```

This function calculates each value only once, so it is more efficient.
