Reasoning:

The problem is asking to sort the elements of the list at indices that are divisible by three. This means we need to sort the elements at index 0, 3, 6, 9, etc. 

To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:

1. Extract the elements at indices divisible by three into a separate list.
2. Sort this list.
3. Replace the elements at indices divisible by three in the original list with the sorted elements.

Implementation:

Here is the Python function implementing the above steps:

```python
def sort_third(l: list):
    # Step 1: Extract the elements at indices divisible by three
    elements_at_indices_divisible_by_three = [l[i] for i in range(0, len(l), 3)]
    
    # Step 2: Sort this list
    elements_at_indices_divisible_by_three.sort()
    
    # Step 3: Replace the elements at indices divisible by three in the original list
    for i in range(0, len(l), 3):
        l[i] = elements_at_indices_divisible_by_three.pop(0)
        
    return l
```

This function works by first creating a list of the elements at indices divisible by three. It then sorts this list. Finally, it iterates over the original list again, replacing the elements at indices divisible by three with the sorted elements. The pop(0) function is used to remove and return the first element of the list of sorted elements, ensuring that the smallest remaining element is used each time.
