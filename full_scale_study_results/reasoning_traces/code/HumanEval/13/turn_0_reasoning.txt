The problem is asking to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two integers. The GCD of two integers is the largest number that divides both of them without leaving a remainder.

One of the most efficient ways to find the GCD of two integers is by using the Euclidean algorithm. The Euclidean algorithm is based on the principle that the greatest common divisor of two numbers does not change if the larger number is replaced by its difference with the smaller number.

Here is the step-by-step approach to solve the problem:

1. If the second number is 0, then the GCD is the first number.
2. If the second number is not 0, then recursively call the function with the second number and the remainder of the first number divided by the second number.

Now, let's implement this approach in Python:

```python
def greatest_common_divisor(a: int, b: int) -> int:
    """ Return a greatest common divisor of two integers a and b
    >>> greatest_common_divisor(3, 5)
    1
    >>> greatest_common_divisor(25, 15)
    5
    """
    if b == 0:
        return a
    else:
        return greatest_common_divisor(b, a % b)
```

This function works by recursively calling itself until it finds the GCD. It first checks if the second number is 0. If it is, it returns the first number as the GCD. If the second number is not 0, it calls itself with the second number and the remainder of the first number divided by the second number. This process continues until the second number becomes 0, at which point the first number is the GCD.
