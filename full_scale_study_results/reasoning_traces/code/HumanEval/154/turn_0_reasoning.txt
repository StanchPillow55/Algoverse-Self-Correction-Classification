Reasoning:

Given two words, we are to determine if the second word or any of its rotations is a substring in the first word. We can obtain a solution for this by performing the following steps:
1. We would iterate through all the characters in the second word
2. On each iteration, we would rotate the second word by one character to the left. This can be done by taking the substring of the second word from the first character to the end and appending the first character of the second word to the end of the substring.
3. We would then check if the rotated word is a substring of the first word. If it is, we would output True
4. If after iterating through all the characters in the second word, we do not find a rotation that is a substring of the first word, we would output False

Example
----------
Suppose we have a single test case such that the first word is "hello" and the second word is "ell". The rotations of the second word are "ell", "lle" and "ell". Since "ell" is a substring of the first word, we would output True

Implementation
-------------------
We can implement this solution in python as follows:

def cycpattern_check(a , b):
    # iterate through all the characters in the second word
    for i in range(len(b)):
        # rotate the second word by one character to the left
        b = b[1:] + b[0]
        # check if the rotated word is a substring of the first word
        if b in a:
            return True
    return False
