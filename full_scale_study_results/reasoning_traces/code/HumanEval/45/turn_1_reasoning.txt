Question ID: HumanEval/45
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: code
==================================================

Reasoning:

The problem is asking to calculate the area of a triangle. The formula to calculate the area of a triangle is 1/2 * base * height. Here, the base of the triangle is given as 'a' and the height of the triangle is given as 'h'. We need to implement this formula in our function.

Approach:

1. Define a function named 'triangle_area' that takes two parameters: 'a' (the base of the triangle) and 'h' (the height of the triangle).
2. Inside the function, calculate the area of the triangle by multiplying 'a' and 'h', then dividing the result by 2. This is because the formula for the area of a triangle is 1/2 * base * height.
3. Return the calculated area.

Implementation:

Here is the Python function that implements the above approach:

```python
def triangle_area(a, h):
    """Given length of a side and high return area for a triangle.
    >>> triangle_area(5, 3)
    7.5
    """
    # Calculate the area of the triangle
    area = 0.5 * a * h

    # Return the calculated area
    return area
```

This function takes the base and height of a triangle as input, calculates the area of the triangle using the formula 1/2 * base * height, and returns the calculated area.
