The area of a triangle can be calculated using the formula:

Area = 0.5 * base * height

In this problem, we are given the length of a side (which we can consider as the base of the triangle) and the height. We can use these values in the formula to calculate the area of the triangle.

Here is the step-by-step approach:

1. Multiply the base and the height.
2. Divide the result by 2.
3. Return the result.

Now, let's implement this in Python.

```python
def triangle_area(a, h):
    """Given length of a side and high return area for a triangle.
    >>> triangle_area(5, 3)
    7.5
    """
    # calculate the area
    area = 0.5 * a * h

    # return the area
    return area
```

This function takes two arguments, `a` and `h`, which represent the base and the height of the triangle, respectively. It calculates the area by multiplying `a` and `h` and dividing the result by 2. Finally, it returns the calculated area.
