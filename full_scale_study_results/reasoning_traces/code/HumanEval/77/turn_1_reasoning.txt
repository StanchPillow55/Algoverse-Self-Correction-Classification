==================================================

To solve the problem of determining whether a given integer `a` is a perfect cube of some integer, we need to follow a systematic approach. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: We need to check if there exists an integer `n` such that `n^3 = a`. If such an `n` exists, then `a` is a perfect cube, and we should return `True`. Otherwise, we return `False`.

2. **Handling Negative Numbers**: Since the cube of a negative number is also negative (e.g., `(-2)^3 = -8`), we need to consider both positive and negative potential cube roots.

3. **Handling Zero**: The cube of zero is zero (`0^3 = 0`), so if `a` is zero, it is trivially a perfect cube.

4. **Iterative Approach**: 
   - We can iterate over possible integer values of `n` and check if `n^3` equals `a`.
   - The range of `n` should be from `-abs(a)^(1/3)` to `abs(a)^(1/3)`. This ensures we cover both negative and positive potential cube roots.
   - We can use the `int` function to convert the cube root to an integer, which gives us the floor value. We should check both this value and the next integer to ensure we cover the exact cube root.

5. **Efficiency Considerations**: 
   - Instead of iterating over all integers, we can directly calculate the integer cube root and check if its cube equals `a`.
   - For positive `a`, check `n = int(a**(1/3))` and `n+1`.
   - For negative `a`, check `n = -int((-a)**(1/3))` and `n-1`.

6. **Implementation**: Based on the above reasoning, we can implement the function `iscube`.

Here's the complete function definition:

```python
def iscube(a):
    '''
    Write a function that takes an integer a and returns True 
    if this integer is a cube of some integer number.
    '''
    if a == 0:
        return True
    
    # Calculate the absolute value's cube root and convert to integer
    abs_a = abs(a)
    n = int(abs_a ** (1/3))
    
    # Check both n and n+1 for positive a, and n and n-1 for negative a
    if a > 0:
        return n**3 == a or (n+1)**3 == a
    else:
        return (-n)**3 == a or (-(n+1))**3 == a

# Test cases
print(iscube(1))    # True
print(iscube(2))    # False
print(iscube(-1))   # True
print(iscube(64))   # True
print(iscube(0))    # True
print(iscube(180))  # False
```

This function efficiently checks whether the given integer `a` is a perfect cube by calculating potential cube roots and verifying their cubes.
