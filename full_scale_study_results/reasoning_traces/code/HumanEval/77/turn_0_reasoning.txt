Reasoning:

The problem is asking to check if the given integer is a cube of some integer number. 

To solve the problem I will use the following steps
- First, I will check if the given integer is less than 0. If it is less than 0, I will change it to a positive number because the cube of a negative number is also a negative number. 
- Then, I will find the cube root of the given number. In python, to find the cube root of a number, we can use the power function with 1/3 as the power.
- After finding the cube root, I will check if the cube of the cube root is equal to the given number. If it is equal, then the given number is a cube of some integer, so I will return True. Otherwise, I will return False.

Now let's implement this in code.

Implementation:

```python
def iscube(a):
    if a < 0:
        a = -a
    cube_root = round(a ** (1 / 3))
    return cube_root ** 3 == a
```

This function works as follows:
- If the input number `a` is negative, it is converted to positive.
- The cube root of `a` is calculated and rounded to the nearest integer. This is because the cube root of a perfect cube is an integer, but due to the precision issues with floating point arithmetic, the calculated cube root might not be an exact integer. So, we round it to the nearest integer.
- Finally, the function checks if the cube of the calculated cube root is equal to `a`. If it is, then `a` is a perfect cube and the function returns `True`. Otherwise, it returns `False`.
