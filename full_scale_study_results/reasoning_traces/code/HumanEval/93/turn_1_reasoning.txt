==================================================

To solve the problem, we need to create a function `encode` that performs two main transformations on the input message:

1. **Swap the case of all letters**: This means converting all lowercase letters to uppercase and all uppercase letters to lowercase.

2. **Replace all vowels with the letter that appears two places ahead in the English alphabet**: The vowels in the English alphabet are 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u' (and their uppercase counterparts 'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U'). We need to replace each vowel with the letter that is two positions ahead. For example:
   - 'a' becomes 'c'
   - 'e' becomes 'g'
   - 'i' becomes 'k'
   - 'o' becomes 'q'
   - 'u' becomes 'w'
   Similarly, for uppercase vowels:
   - 'A' becomes 'C'
   - 'E' becomes 'G'
   - 'I' becomes 'K'
   - 'O' becomes 'Q'
   - 'U' becomes 'W'

Let's break down the steps to implement this:

1. **Initialize a result list**: We'll build the encoded message by appending transformed characters to this list.

2. **Iterate through each character in the input message**:
   - If the character is a vowel (either lowercase or uppercase), replace it with the letter two positions ahead in the alphabet.
   - If the character is not a vowel, simply swap its case.

3. **Join the list of characters into a single string** and return it as the encoded message.

Now, let's implement the function:

```python
def encode(message):
    # Define the mapping for vowels to their replacements
    vowel_map = {
        'a': 'c', 'e': 'g', 'i': 'k', 'o': 'q', 'u': 'w',
        'A': 'C', 'E': 'G', 'I': 'K', 'O': 'Q', 'U': 'W'
    }
    
    # Initialize an empty list to store the result
    result = []
    
    # Iterate through each character in the message
    for char in message:
        if char in vowel_map:
            # If the character is a vowel, replace it using the vowel_map
            result.append(vowel_map[char])
        else:
            # If the character is not a vowel, swap its case
            if char.islower():
                result.append(char.upper())
            else:
                result.append(char.lower())
    
    # Join the list into a string and return it
    return ''.join(result)

# Test cases
print(encode('test'))  # Expected output: 'TGST'
print(encode('This is a message'))  # Expected output: 'tHKS KS C MGSSCGG'
```

This function should correctly encode the message according to the specified rules.
