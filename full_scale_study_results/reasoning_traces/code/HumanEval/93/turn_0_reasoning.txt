The problem is asking to create a function that takes a message and encodes it by swapping the case of all letters and replacing all vowels with the letter that appears 2 places ahead of that vowel in the English alphabet.

To solve the problem, I will use the following steps:

- First, I will iterate over each character in the message.
- If the character is a letter, I will swap its case using the swapcase() function.
- If the character is a vowel, I will replace it with the letter that appears 2 places ahead of it in the English alphabet. To do this, I will use the ord() function to get the ASCII value of the character, add 2 to it, and then use the chr() function to convert it back to a character.
- If the character is not a letter, I will leave it as it is.
- Finally, I will join all the characters together to form the encoded message and return it.

Here is the Python code that implements this approach:

```python
def encode(message):
    vowels = 'aeiouAEIOU'
    encoded_message = ''
    for char in message:
        if char.isalpha():
            if char in vowels:
                encoded_message += chr(ord(char.swapcase()) + 2)
            else:
                encoded_message += char.swapcase()
        else:
            encoded_message += char
    return encoded_message
```

This function works by iterating over each character in the message. If the character is a letter, it checks if it is a vowel. If it is a vowel, it swaps its case and replaces it with the letter that appears 2 places ahead of it in the English alphabet. If it is not a vowel, it simply swaps its case. If the character is not a letter, it leaves it as it is. Finally, it joins all the characters together to form the encoded message and returns it.
