==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to perform two main transformations on the input message:

1. **Swap the case of all letters**: This means converting all lowercase letters to uppercase and all uppercase letters to lowercase.

2. **Replace all vowels with the letter that appears two places ahead in the English alphabet**: The vowels in the English alphabet are 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u', and their uppercase counterparts 'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U'. We need to replace each vowel with the letter that is two positions ahead in the alphabet.

Let's break down the steps to implement this:

### Step-by-step Approach:

1. **Iterate through each character in the message**:
   - For each character, first check if it is a vowel.
   - If it is a vowel, replace it with the letter that is two positions ahead in the alphabet.
   - If it is not a vowel, keep the character as is.

2. **Swap the case of the character**:
   - Use Python's built-in string method `.swapcase()` to change lowercase letters to uppercase and vice versa.

3. **Construct the encoded message**:
   - As we process each character, append the transformed character to a result list.
   - Finally, join the list into a single string to form the encoded message.

### Implementation Details:

- To find the letter two positions ahead of a vowel, we can use the `ord()` function to get the ASCII value of the character, add 2 to it, and then convert it back to a character using `chr()`.
- We need to handle both lowercase and uppercase vowels separately to ensure the correct case is maintained after transformation.

### Implementation:

Let's implement the function based on the above reasoning:

```python
def encode(message):
    # Define vowels and their replacements
    vowel_replacements = {
        'a': 'c', 'e': 'g', 'i': 'k', 'o': 'q', 'u': 'w',
        'A': 'C', 'E': 'G', 'I': 'K', 'O': 'Q', 'U': 'W'
    }
    
    # Initialize an empty list to store the transformed characters
    result = []
    
    # Iterate over each character in the message
    for char in message:
        # If the character is a vowel, replace it
        if char in vowel_replacements:
            transformed_char = vowel_replacements[char]
        else:
            # If not a vowel, keep the character as is
            transformed_char = char
        
        # Swap the case of the transformed character
        transformed_char = transformed_char.swapcase()
        
        # Append the transformed character to the result list
        result.append(transformed_char)
    
    # Join the list into a single string and return
    return ''.join(result)

# Test the function with examples
print(encode('test'))  # Output: 'TGST'
print(encode('This is a message'))  # Output: 'tHKS KS C MGSSCGG'
```

This function should correctly encode the message according to the specified rules.
