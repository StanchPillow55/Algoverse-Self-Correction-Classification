==================================================

The problem is asking to return a sorted list of odd numbers from the Collatz sequence of a given number.

The Collatz sequence is defined as follows:
- Start with any positive integer n.
- Each term is obtained from the previous term as follows:
  - If the previous term is even, the next term is one half of the previous term.
  - If the previous term is odd, the next term is 3 times the previous term plus 1.
- The sequence will always reach 1, no matter what value of n.

To solve the problem, I will use the following steps:
- Initialize an empty list to store the odd numbers in the Collatz sequence.
- Start a while loop that continues until n becomes 1.
- In each iteration of the loop, check if n is odd. If it is, append it to the list of odd numbers.
- Then, calculate the next term in the Collatz sequence. If n is even, divide it by 2. If n is odd, multiply it by 3 and add 1.
- After the loop ends, sort the list of odd numbers in increasing order and return it.

Let's implement this now.

```python
def get_odd_collatz(n):
    odd_numbers = []
    while n != 1:
        if n % 2 != 0:
            odd_numbers.append(n)
        n = n // 2 if n % 2 == 0 else 3 * n + 1
    odd_numbers.append(1)  # The sequence always ends with 1, which is odd
    return sorted(odd_numbers)
```

This function works by iterating through the Collatz sequence of n and collecting the odd numbers. It then sorts and returns these numbers. The time complexity is O(log n) for the while loop (since n is halved in each iteration) and O(n log n) for the sorting, so the overall time complexity is O(n log n). The space complexity is O(n) for storing the odd numbers.
