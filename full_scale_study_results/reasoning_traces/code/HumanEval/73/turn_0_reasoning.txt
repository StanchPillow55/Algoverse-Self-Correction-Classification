==================================================

To solve this problem, we can use the concept of two pointers. We will start with two pointers, one at the beginning of the array and one at the end of the array. We will compare the elements at these two positions. If they are the same, we move both pointers towards the center of the array. If they are not the same, we increment a counter (which represents the number of changes we need to make to the array to make it palindromic) and move both pointers towards the center of the array. We continue this process until the two pointers meet in the middle of the array. The counter at the end of this process will be the minimum number of changes we need to make to the array to make it palindromic.

Here is the Python code that implements this approach:

```python
def smallest_change(arr):
    # Initialize the two pointers and the counter
    i = 0
    j = len(arr) - 1
    changes = 0

    # Continue until the two pointers meet
    while i < j:
        # If the elements at the two pointers are not the same, increment the counter
        if arr[i] != arr[j]:
            changes += 1

        # Move the pointers towards the center of the array
        i += 1
        j -= 1

    # Return the counter
    return changes
```

This function works in O(n) time, where n is the length of the array. This is because we are making a single pass through the array. The space complexity of the function is O(1), as we are not using any additional space that scales with the size of the input.
