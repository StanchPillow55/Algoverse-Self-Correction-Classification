Question ID: HumanEval/73
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: code
==================================================

Reasoning:

To solve this problem, we need to compare the elements of the array from both ends. If the elements are not the same, we need to change one of them to make them the same. We continue this process until we reach the middle of the array. The number of changes we made is the minimum number of changes needed to make the array palindromic.

Here is the step-by-step approach:

1. Initialize a variable `changes` to 0. This will keep track of the number of changes we need to make.

2. Use two pointers, one at the beginning of the array and one at the end. Compare the elements at these two positions.

3. If the elements are the same, move both pointers towards the center of the array.

4. If the elements are not the same, increment `changes` by 1 and move both pointers towards the center of the array.

5. Repeat steps 2-4 until the pointers meet in the middle.

6. Return `changes` as the minimum number of changes needed to make the array palindromic.

Implementation:

Now, let's implement this approach in Python.
