Dataset Type: code
==================================================

Reasoning:

The problem is asking to return the minimum number of changes needed to make the array palindromic. An array is palindromic if it reads the same from both ends. 

To solve the problem I will use the following steps:
- Initialize a counter to 0. This will keep track of the number of changes needed.
- Iterate over the array from both ends simultaneously. 
- If the elements at the current indices are not the same, increment the counter by 1.
- Continue this process until the indices meet in the middle. 

This approach works because each time we find a pair of elements that are not the same, we can change one of them to match the other, thus making that part of the array palindromic. The total number of changes needed is then just the number of non-matching pairs we find.

Now let's implement this in code.

Implementation:

```python
def smallest_change(arr):
    changes = 0
    i, j = 0, len(arr) - 1
    while i < j:
        if arr[i] != arr[j]:
            changes += 1
        i += 1
        j -= 1
    return changes
```

This function works by initializing two pointers at the start and end of the array, and then moving them towards each other. Each time the elements at the pointers are not the same, we increment the counter. The function returns the counter, which represents the minimum number of changes needed to make the array palindromic.
