The problem is asking to sort a string of numbers where the numbers are represented in words. The numbers are from 'zero' to 'nine'. The numbers are separated by a space. We need to return the sorted string of numbers.

Approach:

1. First, we need to convert the string of numbers into a list of numbers. We can use the split() function in Python to split the string into a list where each element is a word in the string.

2. Then, we need to sort the list of numbers. But we can't directly sort the list because the numbers are in words, not in digits. So, we need to convert the words into digits, sort the list, and then convert the digits back into words.

3. To convert the words into digits, we can use a dictionary where the keys are the words and the values are the corresponding digits.

4. After converting the words into digits, we can sort the list using the sort() function in Python.

5. Then, we need to convert the digits back into words. We can use the same dictionary but in reverse order where the keys are the digits and the values are the corresponding words.

6. Finally, we need to convert the list back into a string. We can use the join() function in Python to join the elements of the list into a string where each element is separated by a space.

Let's implement this.

```python
def sort_numbers(numbers: str) -> str:
    # dictionary to convert words into digits
    word_to_digit = {'zero': 0, 'one': 1, 'two': 2, 'three': 3, 'four': 4, 'five': 5, 'six': 6, 'seven': 7, 'eight': 8, 'nine': 9}
    # dictionary to convert digits into words
    digit_to_word = {v: k for k, v in word_to_digit.items()}

    # convert the string into a list
    numbers = numbers.split()

    # convert the words into digits
    numbers = [word_to_digit[number] for number in numbers]

    # sort the list
    numbers.sort()

    # convert the digits back into words
    numbers = [digit_to_word[number] for number in numbers]

    # convert the list back into a string
    numbers = ' '.join(numbers)

    return numbers
```

This function should solve the problem. It first converts the string into a list, then converts the words into digits, sorts the list, converts the digits back into words, and finally converts the list back into a string.
