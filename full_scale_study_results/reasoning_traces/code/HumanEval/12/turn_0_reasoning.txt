==================================================

Reasoning:

Given a list of strings, we are to determine the longest string in the list. If there are multiple strings of the same length, we are to return the first one. If the list is empty, we are to return None. We can obtain a solution for this by performing the following steps:
1. Initialize a variable `max_len` to keep track of the maximum length of a string in the list and set it to 0.
2. Initialize a variable `longest_string` to keep track of the longest string in the list and set it to None.
3. Iterate through all the strings in the list. For each string, check if its length is greater than `max_len`. If it is, update `max_len` to the length of the current string and update `longest_string` to the current string.
4. After the loop, return `longest_string`.

Implementation:

Now let's implement the steps in code.

```python
from typing import List, Optional

def longest(strings: List[str]) -> Optional[str]:
    max_len = 0
    longest_string = None

    for string in strings:
        if len(string) > max_len:
            max_len = len(string)
            longest_string = string

    return longest_string
```

This function works by iterating through each string in the input list, checking its length, and updating the longest string found so far if the current string is longer. If the input list is empty, the function will return None, as `longest_string` is initially set to None and the loop will not be executed. If there are multiple strings of the same length, the function will return the first one it encounters, as it only updates `longest_string` when it finds a string that is strictly longer than the previous longest string.
