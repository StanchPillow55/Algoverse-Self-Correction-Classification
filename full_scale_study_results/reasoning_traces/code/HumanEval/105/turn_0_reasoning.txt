Reasoning:

Given an array of integers, we are to sort the array in ascending order, reverse the array and then replace each digit by its corresponding name from "One", "Two", "Three", "Four", "Five", "Six", "Seven", "Eight", "Nine". We can obtain a solution for this by performing the following steps:

1. Initialize a dictionary where the keys are the integers from 1 to 9 and the values are the corresponding names in English.

2. Filter the array to keep only the integers between 1 and 9 inclusive.

3. Sort the filtered array in ascending order.

4. Reverse the sorted array.

5. Replace each integer in the reversed array by its corresponding name in English using the dictionary.

6. Return the resulting array.

Implementation:

Now, let's implement the solution in Python:

```python
def by_length(arr):
    # Initialize a dictionary where the keys are the integers from 1 to 9 and the values are the corresponding names in English.
    num_to_name = {1: "One", 2: "Two", 3: "Three", 4: "Four", 5: "Five", 6: "Six", 7: "Seven", 8: "Eight", 9: "Nine"}

    # Filter the array to keep only the integers between 1 and 9 inclusive.
    arr = [num for num in arr if 1 <= num <= 9]

    # Sort the filtered array in ascending order and reverse it.
    arr.sort(reverse=True)

    # Replace each integer in the reversed array by its corresponding name in English using the dictionary.
    arr = [num_to_name[num] for num in arr]

    # Return the resulting array.
    return arr
```

This function works as follows:

- It first initializes a dictionary that maps each integer from 1 to 9 to its corresponding name in English.
- It then filters the input array to keep only the integers between 1 and 9 inclusive.
- It sorts the filtered array in ascending order and then reverses it to get the array in descending order.
- It replaces each integer in the reversed array by its corresponding name in English using the dictionary.
- Finally, it returns the resulting array.
