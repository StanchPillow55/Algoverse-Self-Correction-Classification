Dataset Type: code
==================================================

The problem is asking to sort the integers that are between 1 and 9 inclusive, reverse the resulting array, and then replace each digit by its corresponding name from "One", "Two", "Three", "Four", "Five", "Six", "Seven", "Eight", "Nine". 

If the array is empty, return an empty array. If the array has any strange number ignore it.

To solve the problem I will use the following steps
- First, I will filter out the numbers that are not between 1 and 9 inclusive.
- Then, I will sort the filtered numbers in descending order.
- After that, I will map each number to its corresponding name.
- Finally, I will return the result.

Now I will implement this in the function.

```python
def by_length(arr):
    # Mapping of numbers to their names
    number_to_name = {
        1: "One",
        2: "Two",
        3: "Three",
        4: "Four",
        5: "Five",
        6: "Six",
        7: "Seven",
        8: "Eight",
        9: "Nine"
    }
    
    # Filter out the numbers that are not between 1 and 9 inclusive
    filtered_numbers = [num for num in arr if 1 <= num <= 9]
    
    # Sort the numbers in descending order
    sorted_numbers = sorted(filtered_numbers, reverse=True)
    
    # Map each number to its corresponding name
    result = [number_to_name[num] for num in sorted_numbers]
    
    return result
```

This function first creates a mapping of numbers to their names. Then it filters out the numbers that are not between 1 and 9 inclusive. After that, it sorts the numbers in descending order. Finally, it maps each number to its corresponding name and returns the result.
