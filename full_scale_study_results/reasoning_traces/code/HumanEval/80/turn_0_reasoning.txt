==================================================

The problem is asking to return True if the string is happy and False otherwise. A string is considered happy if its length is at least 3 and every 3 consecutive letters are distinct.

To solve the problem I will use the following steps
- Check if the length of the string is less than 3, if so return False
- Iterate through the string while taking 3 characters at a time
- Check if the 3 characters are distinct, if not return False
- If the loop finishes without returning False, return True

Now I will implement this in code.

```python
def is_happy(s):
    if len(s) < 3:
        return False
    for i in range(len(s) - 2):
        if len(set(s[i:i+3])) != 3:
            return False
    return True
```

In the code above:
- I first check if the length of the string is less than 3. If it is, I return False because the string cannot be happy.
- Then I iterate through the string with a for loop. In each iteration, I take a slice of the string from the current index to the current index + 3. This gives me a substring of 3 consecutive characters.
- I convert this substring to a set to remove any duplicate characters. If the length of the set is not 3, it means that not all characters in the substring were distinct, so I return False.
- If the loop finishes without returning False, it means that all substrings of 3 consecutive characters were distinct, so I return True.
