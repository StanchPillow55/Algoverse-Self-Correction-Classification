To solve the problem of finding the n-th number that is both a Fibonacci number and a prime number, we need to break down the task into manageable steps:

1. **Generate Fibonacci Numbers**: We need a way to generate Fibonacci numbers. The Fibonacci sequence starts with 0 and 1, and each subsequent number is the sum of the previous two. We can generate Fibonacci numbers iteratively.

2. **Check for Primality**: For each Fibonacci number, we need to check if it is a prime number. A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. We can implement a function to check if a number is prime.

3. **Count Prime Fibonacci Numbers**: We need to keep track of how many Fibonacci numbers are prime as we generate them. Once we reach the n-th prime Fibonacci number, we return it.

Let's implement these steps:

- **Step 1**: Implement a function to generate Fibonacci numbers.
- **Step 2**: Implement a function to check if a number is prime.
- **Step 3**: Use these functions to find the n-th prime Fibonacci number.

### Implementation

1. **Fibonacci Generator**: We can use a simple loop to generate Fibonacci numbers. We start with the first two numbers, 0 and 1, and keep generating the next number by summing the last two.

2. **Prime Check Function**: To check if a number is prime, we can use trial division up to the square root of the number. If a number is not divisible by any number up to its square root, it is prime.

3. **Main Function**: Use the Fibonacci generator and prime check function to find the n-th prime Fibonacci number.

Here's the complete implementation:

```python
def is_prime(num):
    """Check if a number is prime."""
    if num <= 1:
        return False
    if num <= 3:
        return True
    if num % 2 == 0 or num % 3 == 0:
        return False
    i = 5
    while i * i <= num:
        if num % i == 0 or num % (i + 2) == 0:
            return False
        i += 6
    return True

def prime_fib(n: int):
    """Return the n-th Fibonacci number that is also prime."""
    fib1, fib2 = 0, 1
    count = 0
    while True:
        fib1, fib2 = fib2, fib1 + fib2
        if is_prime(fib2):
            count += 1
            if count == n:
                return fib2

# Example usage:
print(prime_fib(1))  # Output: 2
print(prime_fib(2))  # Output: 3
print(prime_fib(3))  # Output: 5
print(prime_fib(4))  # Output: 13
print(prime_fib(5))  # Output: 89
```

### Explanation

- **is_prime Function**: This function checks if a number is prime by first handling small numbers and even numbers, then using trial division for numbers greater than 3.

- **prime_fib Function**: This function generates Fibonacci numbers and checks each one for primality. It keeps a count of how many prime Fibonacci numbers have been found and returns the n-th one.

This solution efficiently finds the n-th prime Fibonacci number by leveraging the properties of Fibonacci numbers and prime checking.
