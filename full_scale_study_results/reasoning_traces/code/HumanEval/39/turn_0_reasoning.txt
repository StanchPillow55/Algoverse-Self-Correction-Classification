The problem is asking for the nth Fibonacci number that is also a prime number. 

To solve this problem, we need to generate Fibonacci numbers and check if they are prime. We continue this process until we have found the nth Fibonacci number that is also prime.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the approach:

1. Initialize two variables, `a` and `b`, to 0 and 1 respectively. These will be used to generate Fibonacci numbers.

2. Initialize a counter, `prime_fib_count`, to 0. This will keep track of how many prime Fibonacci numbers we've found.

3. Enter a while loop that continues until `prime_fib_count` is equal to `n`.

4. In each iteration of the loop, generate the next Fibonacci number by adding `a` and `b`.

5. Check if the generated Fibonacci number is prime. If it is, increment `prime_fib_count`.

6. Update `a` and `b` to prepare for the next iteration.

7. Once `prime_fib_count` is equal to `n`, return the last generated Fibonacci number.

To check if a number is prime, we can use a helper function that checks if the number is divisible by any number from 2 to its square root. If it is, it's not prime. Otherwise, it is prime.

Now, let's implement this approach in Python:

```python
import math

def prime_fib(n: int) -> int:
    def is_prime(num: int) -> bool:
        if num < 2:
            return False
        for i in range(2, math.isqrt(num) + 1):
            if num % i == 0:
                return False
        return True

    a, b = 0, 1
    prime_fib_count = 0
    while prime_fib_count < n:
        a, b = b, a + b
        if is_prime(b):
            prime_fib_count += 1
    return b
```

This function should solve the problem as expected. It generates Fibonacci numbers and checks if they are prime until it has found the nth prime Fibonacci number.
