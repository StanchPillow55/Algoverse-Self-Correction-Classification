To solve the problem of finding the n-th Fibonacci number that is also prime, we need to break down the task into several steps:

1. **Generate Fibonacci Numbers**: We need a way to generate Fibonacci numbers. The Fibonacci sequence is defined as:
   - F(0) = 0
   - F(1) = 1
   - F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2) for n >= 2

2. **Check for Primality**: We need a function to check if a number is prime. A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.

3. **Combine Both Tasks**: We need to generate Fibonacci numbers one by one, check if they are prime, and count how many prime Fibonacci numbers we have found until we reach the n-th one.

Let's go through these steps in detail:

### Step 1: Generate Fibonacci Numbers
We can generate Fibonacci numbers using an iterative approach. We start with the first two Fibonacci numbers (0 and 1) and keep generating the next number by summing the last two numbers in the sequence.

### Step 2: Check for Primality
To check if a number is prime, we can use the following approach:
- If the number is less than 2, it is not prime.
- Check divisibility from 2 up to the square root of the number. If the number is divisible by any of these, it is not prime.

### Step 3: Combine Both Tasks
We will iterate through the Fibonacci sequence, check each number for primality, and keep a count of how many prime Fibonacci numbers we have found. Once we reach the n-th prime Fibonacci number, we return it.

Now, let's implement the solution:

```python
def is_prime(num):
    """Check if a number is prime."""
    if num <= 1:
        return False
    if num <= 3:
        return True
    if num % 2 == 0 or num % 3 == 0:
        return False
    i = 5
    while i * i <= num:
        if num % i == 0 or num % (i + 2) == 0:
            return False
        i += 6
    return True

def prime_fib(n: int):
    """Return the n-th Fibonacci number that is also prime."""
    if n < 1:
        raise ValueError("n must be a positive integer.")
    
    fib1, fib2 = 0, 1
    count = 0
    
    while True:
        fib_next = fib1 + fib2
        fib1, fib2 = fib2, fib_next
        
        if is_prime(fib_next):
            count += 1
            if count == n:
                return fib_next

# Test cases
print(prime_fib(1))  # Output: 2
print(prime_fib(2))  # Output: 3
print(prime_fib(3))  # Output: 5
print(prime_fib(4))  # Output: 13
print(prime_fib(5))  # Output: 89
```

### Explanation of the Code:
- **`is_prime` function**: This function checks if a number is prime using trial division up to the square root of the number.
- **`prime_fib` function**: This function generates Fibonacci numbers iteratively. For each Fibonacci number, it checks if the number is prime using the `is_prime` function. It keeps track of how many prime Fibonacci numbers have been found and returns the n-th one.
