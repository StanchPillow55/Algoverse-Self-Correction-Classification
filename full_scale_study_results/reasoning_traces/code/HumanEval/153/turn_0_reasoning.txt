The problem is asking to find the strongest extension from a list of extensions and return it in a specific format. The strength of an extension is defined as the number of uppercase letters minus the number of lowercase letters in the extension's name. If there are two or more extensions with the same strength, we should choose the one that comes first in the list.

To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:

1. Initialize a variable, `strongest_extension`, to keep track of the strongest extension found so far. We can initially set it to the first extension in the list.

2. Initialize a variable, `max_strength`, to keep track of the maximum strength found so far. We can initially set it to the strength of the first extension.

3. Iterate over the rest of the extensions in the list. For each extension, calculate its strength. If its strength is greater than `max_strength`, update `max_strength` and `strongest_extension` to the current extension and its strength.

4. After iterating over all extensions, return the class name and the strongest extension in the required format.

Now, let's implement this in Python:

```python
def Strongest_Extension(class_name, extensions):
    # Calculate the strength of an extension
    def strength(extension):
        CAP = sum(1 for c in extension if c.isupper())
        SM = sum(1 for c in extension if c.islower())
        return CAP - SM

    # Initialize strongest_extension and max_strength
    strongest_extension = extensions[0]
    max_strength = strength(strongest_extension)

    # Iterate over the rest of the extensions
    for extension in extensions[1:]:
        current_strength = strength(extension)
        if current_strength > max_strength:
            max_strength = current_strength
            strongest_extension = extension

    # Return the class name and the strongest extension in the required format
    return f'{class_name}.{strongest_extension}'
```

This function works by calculating the strength of each extension and keeping track of the strongest one. It uses the `isupper` and `islower` string methods to count the number of uppercase and lowercase letters in an extension. The `f-string` is used to format the output string.
