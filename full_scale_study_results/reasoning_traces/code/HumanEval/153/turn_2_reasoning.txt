==================================================

Reasoning:

Given a class name and a list of extensions, we are to determine the extension with the highest strength. The strength of an extension is determined by the difference between the number of uppercase letters and the number of lowercase letters in the extension. 

We can obtain a solution for this by performing the following steps:
1. Initialize a variable `max_strength` to a very small number and `strongest_extension` to an empty string. These variables will be used to keep track of the extension with the highest strength and its corresponding strength.
2. Iterate through all the extensions in the list. For each extension, calculate its strength by subtracting the number of lowercase letters from the number of uppercase letters. If the strength of the current extension is greater than `max_strength`, update `max_strength` to the strength of the current extension and `strongest_extension` to the current extension.
3. After iterating through all the extensions, return the class name concatenated with the `strongest_extension` separated by a period.

This approach works because it checks all extensions and keeps track of the one with the highest strength, which is exactly what the problem is asking for.

Now let's implement this in code.

Implementation:

Here is the Python function that implements the above approach: 

```python
def Strongest_Extension(class_name, extensions):
    max_strength = float('-inf')
    strongest_extension = ''
    for extension in extensions:
        strength = sum(1 for char in extension if char.isupper()) - sum(1 for char in extension if char.islower())
        if strength > max_strength:
            max_strength = strength
            strongest_extension = extension
    return f'{class_name}.{strongest_extension}'
```

This function works by iterating over each extension in the `extensions` list, calculating the strength of the extension, and updating `max_strength` and `strongest_extension` if the current extension's strength is greater than `max_strength`. Finally, it returns the class name concatenated with the `strongest_extension` separated by a period.
