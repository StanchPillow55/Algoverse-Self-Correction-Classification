==================================================

Reasoning:

Given a class name and a list of extensions, we are to determine the extension with the highest strength. We can obtain a solution for this by performing the following steps:
1. Initialize a variable `max_strength` to hold the maximum strength of an extension and set it to negative infinity.
2. Initialize a variable `strongest_extension` to hold the extension with the maximum strength.
3. Iterate through all the extensions in the list. For each extension, calculate its strength by subtracting the number of lowercase letters from the number of uppercase letters.
4. If the strength of the current extension is greater than `max_strength`, update `max_strength` and `strongest_extension` with the strength and name of the current extension respectively.
5. After iterating through all the extensions, return the class name concatenated with the `strongest_extension` with a dot (.) in between.

Now let's implement this in code.

Implementation: 

```python
def Strongest_Extension(class_name, extensions):
    max_strength = float('-inf')
    strongest_extension = ''

    for extension in extensions:
        strength = sum(1 for c in extension if c.isupper()) - sum(1 for c in extension if c.islower())
        if strength > max_strength:
            max_strength = strength
            strongest_extension = extension

    return class_name + '.' + strongest_extension
```

This function works by iterating through each extension in the list, calculating its strength, and keeping track of the extension with the highest strength. The strength of an extension is calculated by subtracting the number of lowercase letters from the number of uppercase letters in the extension's name. If the strength of the current extension is greater than the maximum strength found so far, the function updates the maximum strength and the strongest extension. Finally, the function returns the class name concatenated with the strongest extension, separated by a dot.
