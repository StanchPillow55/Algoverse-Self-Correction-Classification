==================================================

Reasoning:

Given a word, we are to find the closest vowel that stands between two consonants from the right side of the word. We can obtain a solution for this by performing the following steps:
1. Initialize a variable `closest_vowel` to keep track of the closest vowel that stands between two consonants from the right side of the word
2. Iterate through the word from the right side. On each iteration, we would check if the current character is a vowel and the previous and next characters are consonants. If it is, we would update the `closest_vowel` variable with the current character
3. After iterating through the entire word, we would output the `closest_vowel` variable

Example
----------
Suppose we have a single test case such that the word is `yogurt`. If we iterate through the word from the right side, the closest vowel that stands between two consonants from the right side of the word is `u`

Suppose we have a single test case such that the word is `FULL`. If we iterate through the word from the right side, the closest vowel that stands between two consonants from the right side of the word is `U`

Suppose we have a single test case such that the word is `quick`. If we iterate through the word from the right side, there is no vowel that stands between two consonants from the right side of the word

Suppose we have a single test case such that the word is `ab`. If we iterate through the word from the right side, there is no vowel that stands between two consonants from the right side of the word

Implementation
-------------------
We can implement the solution as follows:

def get_closest_vowel(word):
    vowels = 'aeiouAEIOU'
    closest_vowel = ''
    for i in range(len(word)-2, 0, -1):
        if word[i] in vowels and word[i-1] not in vowels and word[i+1] not in vowels:
            closest_vowel = word[i]
            break
    return closest_vowel
