==================================================

Reasoning:

The problem is asking to return a tuple that contains the number of even and odd integer palindromes from 1 to n inclusive. 

A palindrome is a number that remains the same when its digits are reversed. For example, 121 is a palindrome, but 123 is not.

To solve the problem I will use the following steps
- Initialize two variables, even_count and odd_count, to 0. These will hold the count of even and odd palindromes respectively.
- Iterate over the range from 1 to n inclusive.
- For each number, convert it to a string and check if it is the same as its reverse. If it is, then it is a palindrome.
- If the number is a palindrome, check if it is even or odd by taking the modulus of 2. If the modulus is 0, then it is even, otherwise it is odd.
- Increment the appropriate count variable.
- Finally, return a tuple of the even and odd counts.

Now let's implement this in code.

Implementation: 

```python
def even_odd_palindrome(n):
    even_count = 0
    odd_count = 0
    for i in range(1, n+1):
        if str(i) == str(i)[::-1]:
            if i % 2 == 0:
                even_count += 1
            else:
                odd_count += 1
    return (even_count, odd_count)
```

This function works by iterating over the range from 1 to n inclusive. For each number, it checks if it is a palindrome by converting it to a string and comparing it to its reverse. If the number is a palindrome, it then checks if it is even or odd by taking the modulus of 2. If the modulus is 0, then the number is even, and the even_count is incremented. Otherwise, the number is odd, and the odd_count is incremented. Finally, the function returns a tuple of the even and odd counts.
