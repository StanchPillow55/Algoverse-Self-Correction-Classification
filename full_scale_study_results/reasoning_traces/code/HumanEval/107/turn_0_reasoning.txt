==================================================

Reasoning:

Given a positive integer `n`, we are to determine the number of even and odd integer palindromes that fall within the range `(1, n)`. A palindrome is a number that reads the same backward as forward. We can obtain a solution for this by performing the following steps:

1. Initialize two variables `even` and `odd` to keep track of the number of even and odd palindromes respectively.
2. Iterate through the range `(1, n+1)`. On each iteration, we would check if the current number is a palindrome. We can do this by converting the number to a string and checking if the string is equal to its reverse. If it is, we would then check if the number is even or odd and increment the corresponding counter.
3. Finally, we would return a tuple containing the count of even and odd palindromes.

Let's implement this.

Implementation:

```python
def even_odd_palindrome(n):
    even, odd = 0, 0

    for i in range(1, n+1):
        if str(i) == str(i)[::-1]:  # check if number is a palindrome
            if i % 2 == 0:  # check if number is even
                even += 1
            else:  # number is odd
                odd += 1

    return even, odd
```

This function works by iterating through all numbers from 1 to `n` (inclusive), checking if each number is a palindrome, and if it is, checking if it's even or odd. The counts of even and odd palindromes are stored in the variables `even` and `odd` respectively, which are returned as a tuple at the end of the function.
