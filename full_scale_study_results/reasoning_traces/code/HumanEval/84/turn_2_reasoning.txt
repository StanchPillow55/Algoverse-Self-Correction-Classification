Question ID: HumanEval/84
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: code
==================================================

Reasoning:

The problem is asking to return the total sum of the digits in binary form. 

Here are the steps I am going to take to solve this problem:

1. Convert the given number to binary.
2. Count the number of 1's in the binary representation. This is because in binary, the only digits are 0 and 1. So, the sum of the digits is simply the count of 1's.
3. Convert the count to binary and return it as a string.

Implementation:

Now, I will implement the solution in Python. I will use the built-in function bin() to convert the number to binary. This function returns a string that starts with '0b'. I will slice off the first two characters to get the binary digits. Then, I will use the count() method to count the number of 1's. Finally, I will convert the count to binary using bin() and return it as a string. 

Here is the Python function:
