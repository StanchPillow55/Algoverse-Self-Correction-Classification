==================================================

Reasoning:

Given a number `N`, we are to determine the sum of the digits in binary. We can obtain a solution for this by performing the following steps:
1. Convert the number to binary
2. Sum up the digits in the binary representation
3. Convert the sum to binary and return the result

Approach:

1. Convert the number `N` to binary using the built-in `bin()` function in Python. This function converts an integer to binary and returns the result as a string. The string starts with the prefix '0b' to indicate that it's a binary number. We can remove this prefix by slicing the string from the 2nd index.
2. Iterate through the binary string and sum up the digits. Since the digits are in string format, we need to convert them to integers before adding them up.
3. Convert the sum to binary again using the `bin()` function and remove the '0b' prefix.
4. Return the binary sum as a string.

Implementation:

Now let's implement this approach in code. 

```python
def solve(N):
    # Convert N to binary and remove the '0b' prefix
    binary_N = bin(N)[2:]
    
    # Sum up the digits in the binary representation
    sum_of_digits = sum(int(digit) for digit in binary_N)
    
    # Convert the sum to binary and remove the '0b' prefix
    binary_sum = bin(sum_of_digits)[2:]
    
    return binary_sum
```

This function works by first converting the input number to binary, then summing up the digits in the binary representation, and finally converting the sum to binary again. The result is returned as a string.
