==================================================

Reasoning:

Given an array of non-negative integers, we are to determine the smallest even integer in the array and its index. We can obtain a solution for this by performing the following steps:
1. Initialize a variable `min_val` to keep track of the smallest even integer in the array
2. Initialize a variable `min_index` to keep track of the index of the smallest even integer in the array
3. Iterate through the entire list and on each iteration, check if the current integer in the list is an even number. If it is, check if it is less than the current `min_val`. If it is, update `min_val` and `min_index` with the current integer and its index respectively.
4. After iterating through the entire list, check if `min_val` is still `None`. If it is, return an empty list. If not, return a list containing `min_val` and `min_index`.

Plan:
1. Initialize `min_val` and `min_index` to `None`
2. Iterate through the entire list. On each iteration, check if the current integer is an even number. If it is, check if it is less than `min_val`. If it is, update `min_val` and `min_index` with the current integer and its index respectively.
3. After iterating through the entire list, check if `min_val` is `None`. If it is, return an empty list. If not, return a list containing `min_val` and `min_index`.

Let's implement this plan in code.

Implementation: 

```python
def pluck(arr):
    min_val = None
    min_index = None

    for i in range(len(arr)):
        if arr[i] % 2 == 0:
            if min_val is None or arr[i] < min_val:
                min_val = arr[i]
                min_index = i

    if min_val is None:
        return []
    else:
        return [min_val, min_index]
```

This function works by iterating through the entire list and checking if each integer is an even number. If it is, it checks if it is less than the current `min_val`. If it is, it updates `min_val` and `min_index` with the current integer and its index. After iterating through the entire list, it checks if `min_val` is `None`. If it is, it returns an empty list. If not, it returns a list containing `min_val` and `min_index`.
