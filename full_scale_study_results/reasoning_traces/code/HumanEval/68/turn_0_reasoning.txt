Dataset Type: code
==================================================

Reasoning:

Given an array of non-negative integers, we are to determine the smallest even number in the array and its index. We can obtain a solution for this by performing the following steps:
1. Initialize a variable `min_even` to keep track of the smallest even number and `min_index` to keep track of the index of the smallest even number
2. Iterate through the entire list and on each iteration check if the current element in the list is an even number and if it is less than the current smallest even number. If it is, update the `min_even` and `min_index` variables
3. After iterating through the entire list, check if the `min_even` variable is still `None`. If it is, then there were no even numbers in the list and we would return an empty list. If not, we would return a list containing the smallest even number and its index

Example
----------
Suppose we have a single test case such that the array is `[5, 0, 3, 0, 4, 2]`. The smallest even number in the list is `0` and it occurs at index `1` and `3`. Since we are to return the smallest index, we would output a list containing the smallest even number and its index as `[0, 1]`

Implementation
-------------------
We can implement this in python as follows: 

```python
def pluck(arr):
    min_even = None
    min_index = None

    # iterate through the entire list
    for i in range(len(arr)):
        # check if current element is an even number and if it is less than the current smallest even number
        if arr[i] % 2 == 0 and (min_even is None or arr[i] < min_even):
            min_even = arr[i]
            min_index = i

    # check if there were no even numbers in the list
    if min_even is None:
        return []
    else:
        return [min_even, min_index]
```

This solution iterates through the list once, so it has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of elements in the list.
