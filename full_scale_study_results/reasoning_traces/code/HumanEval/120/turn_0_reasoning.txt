The problem is asking to return the maximum k numbers from the given array in ascending order. 

To solve the problem I will use the following steps
- First, I will sort the array in descending order. This will place the largest numbers at the beginning of the array.
- Then, I will slice the array from the start to the kth index. This will give me the k largest numbers in the array.
- Finally, I will sort the sliced array in ascending order and return it.

This approach will work because sorting the array in descending order ensures that the largest numbers are at the beginning of the array. Slicing the array from the start to the kth index then gives us the k largest numbers. Sorting this sliced array in ascending order ensures that the output is in the correct format.

Here is the Python function that implements this approach:

```python
def maximum(arr, k):
    # Sort the array in descending order
    arr.sort(reverse=True)
    # Slice the array from the start to the kth index
    max_k_numbers = arr[:k]
    # Sort the sliced array in ascending order
    max_k_numbers.sort()
    # Return the sorted array
    return max_k_numbers
```

This function first sorts the array in descending order using the sort() method with the reverse parameter set to True. It then slices the array from the start to the kth index using array slicing. The sliced array is then sorted in ascending order using the sort() method and returned. 

The time complexity of this function is O(n log n) due to the sort() method, where n is the length of the array. The space complexity is O(k) for the sliced array, where k is the input to the function.
