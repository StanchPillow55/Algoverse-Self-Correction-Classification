==================================================

Reasoning:

The problem is asking to concatenate a list of strings into a single string. In Python, we can use the built-in function join() to concatenate all the strings in a list. The join() function is a string method and returns a string in which the elements of sequence have been joined by str separator.

Approach:

1. Use the join() function to concatenate all the strings in the list.
2. Return the concatenated string.

Implementation:

Here is the Python function that implements the above approach.

```python
from typing import List

def concatenate(strings: List[str]) -> str:
    """ Concatenate list of strings into a single string
    >>> concatenate([])
    ''
    >>> concatenate(['a', 'b', 'c'])
    'abc'
    """
    # Use the join() function to concatenate all the strings in the list
    return ''.join(strings)
```

This function takes a list of strings as input and returns a single string that is the concatenation of all the strings in the list. If the list is empty, the function returns an empty string.
