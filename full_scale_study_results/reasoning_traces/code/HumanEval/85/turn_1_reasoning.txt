Dataset Type: code
==================================================

Reasoning:

Given a list of integers, we are to determine the sum of all even elements at odd indices. We can obtain a solution for this by performing the following steps:
1. Initialize a variable `sum` to keep track of the sum of even elements at odd indices
2. Iterate through all the elements in the list. On each iteration, we would check if the current index is odd and if the element at the current index is even. If it is, we would add the element to our `sum` variable
3. Return the `sum` variable

Implementation:

Now we can implement this in a function. We will use the built-in `enumerate` function to iterate over the list with access to both the current element and its index. We will use the modulo operator `%` to check if an index or number is odd or even. An index is odd if `index % 2 != 0` and a number is even if `number % 2 == 0`.

Here is the Python function implementing this approach:

```python
def add(lst):
    """Given a non-empty list of integers lst. add the even elements that are at odd indices..

    Examples:
        add([4, 2, 6, 7]) ==> 2 
    """
    # Step 1: Initialize sum to 0
    sum = 0

    # Step 2: Iterate over the list
    for index, number in enumerate(lst):
        # Check if index is odd and number is even
        if index % 2 != 0 and number % 2 == 0:
            # Add number to sum
            sum += number

    # Step 3: Return sum
    return sum
```

This function works for any non-empty list of integers and correctly adds up the even elements at odd indices.
