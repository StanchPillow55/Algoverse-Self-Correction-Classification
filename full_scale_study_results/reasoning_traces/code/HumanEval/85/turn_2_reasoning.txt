==================================================

Reasoning:

Given a list of integers, we are to find the sum of all even elements at odd indices. We can obtain a solution for this by performing the following steps:
1. Initialize a variable `sum` to keep track of the sum of all even elements at odd indices.
2. Iterate through all the elements in the list. On each iteration, we would check if the index of the current element is odd. If it is, we would then check if the element at the current index is even. If it is, we would add it to our `sum` variable.
3. After iterating through all the elements in the list, we would output the value of the `sum` variable as the sum of all even elements at odd indices.

Let's implement this.

Implementation: 

```python
def add(lst):
    # Step 1
    sum = 0

    # Step 2
    for i in range(len(lst)):
        if i % 2 != 0 and lst[i] % 2 == 0:
            sum += lst[i]

    # Step 3
    return sum
```

This function works by iterating over the list and checking each index to see if it's odd (i.e., `i % 2 != 0`). If the index is odd, it then checks if the number at that index is even (i.e., `lst[i] % 2 == 0`). If both conditions are met, it adds the number to the sum. After going through all the numbers in the list, it returns the sum.
