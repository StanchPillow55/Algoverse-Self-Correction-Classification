==================================================

Reasoning:

Given a list of integers, we are to determine the sum of all even elements at odd indices. We can obtain a solution for this by performing the following steps:
1. Initialize a variable `sum` to keep track of the sum of even elements at odd indices.
2. Iterate through the entire list. On each iteration, we would check if the index of the current element is odd and if the current element is even. If it is, we would add the current element to our `sum` variable.
3. After iterating through the entire list, we would output the `sum` variable as the sum of all even elements at odd indices.

Implementation:

Now we would implement the steps in python:

```python
def add(lst):
    # step 1
    sum = 0

    # step 2
    for i in range(len(lst)):
        if i % 2 != 0 and lst[i] % 2 == 0:
            sum += lst[i]

    # step 3
    return sum
```

This function works by iterating over the list with a for loop. The range function is used to generate a sequence of numbers from 0 to the length of the list minus 1. This sequence is used as the indices for accessing the elements in the list. The if statement checks if the index is odd (i % 2 != 0) and if the element at that index is even (lst[i] % 2 == 0). If both conditions are true, the element is added to the sum. After the loop finishes, the sum is returned.
