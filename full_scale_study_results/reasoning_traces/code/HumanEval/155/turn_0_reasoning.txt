Reasoning:

Given a number, we are to determine the number of even and odd digits in the number. We can obtain a solution for this by performing the following steps:
1. Convert the number to a string and remove any negative signs if it exists.
2. Initialize two variables `even_count` and `odd_count` to keep track of the number of even and odd digits in the number.
3. Iterate through all the digits in the number. On each iteration, check if the digit is even or odd. If the digit is even, increment the `even_count` by 1. If the digit is odd, increment the `odd_count` by 1.
4. After iterating through all the digits in the number, return a tuple of the `even_count` and `odd_count`.

Implementation:

Now, let's implement the solution in Python. 

```python
def even_odd_count(num):
    # convert the number to a string and remove any negative signs
    num = str(abs(num))
    
    # initialize even and odd count
    even_count = 0
    odd_count = 0
    
    # iterate through all the digits in the number
    for digit in num:
        # check if the digit is even or odd
        if int(digit) % 2 == 0:
            even_count += 1
        else:
            odd_count += 1
            
    # return a tuple of the even and odd count
    return (even_count, odd_count)
```

Now, let's test the function with the provided examples.

```python
print(even_odd_count(-12))  # Expected output: (1, 1)
print(even_odd_count(123))  # Expected output: (1, 2)
```

The function should return the correct output for the provided examples.
