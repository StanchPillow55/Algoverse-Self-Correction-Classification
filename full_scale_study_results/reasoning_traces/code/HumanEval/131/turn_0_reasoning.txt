Reasoning:

Given a positive integer, we are to determine the product of the odd digits in the integer. We can obtain a solution for this by performing the following steps:
1. Initialize a variable `product` to keep track of the product of the odd digits. Set it to 1 initially.
2. Convert the integer to a string to be able to iterate over each digit.
3. Iterate over each digit in the string. Convert it back to an integer and check if it's odd. If it is, multiply the `product` by this digit.
4. After the loop, check if the `product` is still 1. If it is, it means there were no odd digits, so return 0. Otherwise, return the `product`.

Implementation:

Now, let's implement this in Python: 

```python
def digits(n):
    product = 1
    for digit in str(n):
        digit = int(digit)
        if digit % 2 != 0:
            product *= digit
    if product == 1:
        return 0
    else:
        return product
```

This function works by iterating over each digit in the number (which is converted to a string to allow this). It then checks if the digit is odd, and if it is, it multiplies the current product by this digit. If no odd digits are found, the function returns 0. Otherwise, it returns the product of the odd digits.
