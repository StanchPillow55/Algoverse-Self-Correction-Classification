==================================================

Reasoning:

Given a positive integer n, we are to determine the product of the odd digits in the integer. If all digits are even, we should return 0. We can obtain a solution for this by performing the following steps:
1. Initialize a variable `product` to keep track of the product of the odd digits. We would set this to 1 as the initial value since 1 is the identity for multiplication.
2. Convert the integer to a string to easily iterate through each digit.
3. Iterate through each digit in the string. If the digit is odd (i.e., `digit % 2 != 0`), multiply the current product by the digit.
4. After the iteration, if the product is still 1, it means there were no odd digits, so we return 0. Otherwise, we return the product.

Implementation: 

Now we can implement this plan in code. We'll define a function `digits(n)` that takes an integer `n` as input and returns the product of its odd digits. If there are no odd digits, the function will return 0. 

Here is the Python code for the function: 

```python
def digits(n):
    product = 1
    for digit in str(n):
        if int(digit) % 2 != 0:
            product *= int(digit)
    return product if product != 1 else 0
```

This function works by first converting the input integer to a string, which allows us to iterate through its digits. For each digit, we check if it's odd by converting it back to an integer and checking if it's not divisible by 2. If the digit is odd, we multiply the current product by the digit. After going through all the digits, we return the product if it's not 1 (which would mean there were odd digits), or 0 if the product is still 1 (which would mean there were no odd digits).
