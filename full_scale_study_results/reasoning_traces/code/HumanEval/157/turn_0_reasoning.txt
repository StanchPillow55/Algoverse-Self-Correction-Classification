Reasoning:

A right-angled triangle follows the Pythagorean theorem, which states that the square of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides. This can be written as:

c² = a² + b²

where c is the length of the hypotenuse, and a and b are the lengths of the other two sides.

So, to solve this problem, we can use the Pythagorean theorem. We first need to find the longest side (hypotenuse) among the three given sides. Then, we check if the square of the longest side is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides. If it is, then the triangle is a right-angled triangle, and we return True. Otherwise, we return False.

Approach:

1. Find the longest side among a, b, and c.
2. Check if the square of the longest side is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides.
3. If it is, return True. Otherwise, return False.

Implementation:

Here is the Python function that implements the above approach.
