==================================================

Reasoning:

A right-angled triangle is a triangle in which one angle is a right angle (90 degrees). According to the Pythagorean theorem, in a right-angled triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides. This can be written as:

c² = a² + b²

where c is the length of the hypotenuse, and a and b are the lengths of the other two sides.

So, to solve this problem, we can use the Pythagorean theorem. We first need to find the longest side of the triangle (the potential hypotenuse). Then we check if the square of this side is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides. If it is, then the triangle is right-angled and we return True. If not, we return False.

Implementation:

Let's implement this in Python. We'll first sort the input lengths so that we can easily find the longest side. Then we'll apply the Pythagorean theorem and return the result.
