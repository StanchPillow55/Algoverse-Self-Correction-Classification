Reasoning:

A right-angled triangle is a triangle in which one angle is a right angle or 90 degree. According to the Pythagorean theorem, in a right-angled triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides. This can be written as:

c² = a² + b²

where c is the length of the hypotenuse, and a and b are the lengths of the other two sides.

To solve this problem, we can use the Pythagorean theorem. We can first find the longest side of the triangle (which would be the hypotenuse if the triangle is right-angled). Then we check if the square of the longest side is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides. If it is, then the triangle is right-angled.

Implementation:

Here is the Python function that implements the above approach:

```python
def right_angle_triangle(a, b, c):
    # Find the longest side
    sides = [a, b, c]
    sides.sort()
    hypotenuse = sides[2]
    other_sides = sides[:2]

    # Check if the triangle is right-angled
    if hypotenuse**2 == sum(side**2 for side in other_sides):
        return True
    else:
        return False
```

This function first finds the longest side of the triangle by sorting the list of side lengths and taking the last element. It then checks if the square of the longest side is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides. If it is, the function returns True, indicating that the triangle is right-angled. Otherwise, it returns False.
