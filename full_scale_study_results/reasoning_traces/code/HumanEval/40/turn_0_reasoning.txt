The problem is asking to return True if there are three distinct elements in the list that sum to zero, and False otherwise.

To solve the problem I will use the following steps
- First, I will check if the length of the list is less than 3, if so return False because we can't find three numbers from a list that has less than three numbers.
- Then I will sort the list, sorting the list will help to easily check if there are three numbers that sum to zero.
- After sorting the list I will use a for loop to iterate through the list.
- For each number, I will use the two-pointer technique to find if there are two numbers that sum to the negative of the current number.
- If I find three numbers that sum to zero, I will return True
- If I finish the loop without finding three numbers that sum to zero, I will return False

Now I will start implementing this.

```python
def triples_sum_to_zero(l: list):
    if len(l) < 3:
        return False
    l.sort()
    for i in range(len(l) - 2):
        if i > 0 and l[i] == l[i - 1]:
            continue
        left = i + 1
        right = len(l) - 1
        while left < right:
            total = l[i] + l[left] + l[right]
            if total < 0:
                left += 1
            elif total > 0:
                right -= 1
            else:
                return True
    return False
```

This function works by first sorting the list, then iterating over each element with a for loop. For each element, it uses a while loop to move two pointers, left and right, towards each other. If the sum of the current element and the elements at the left and right pointers is less than zero, it moves the left pointer one step to the right. If the sum is greater than zero, it moves the right pointer one step to the left. If the sum is exactly zero, it returns True. If the for loop finishes without finding three elements that sum to zero, it returns False. The time complexity is O(n^2), where n is the length of the list.
