==================================================

First, let's understand the problem. We are given three numbers: the number of carrots already eaten, the number of carrots needed to be eaten, and the number of remaining carrots. We need to return an array with two numbers: the total number of eaten carrots after meals and the number of carrots left after meals. If there are not enough remaining carrots, we eat all remaining carrots, but will still be hungry.

The problem seems straightforward. We just need to add the number of carrots eaten and the number of carrots needed to be eaten to get the total number of eaten carrots. However, if the number of carrots needed to be eaten is more than the remaining carrots, we can only eat the remaining carrots. Therefore, we need to check if the number of carrots needed to be eaten is more than the remaining carrots. If it is, we eat all remaining carrots. Otherwise, we eat the number of carrots needed to be eaten.

After eating, we need to calculate the number of remaining carrots. If the number of carrots needed to be eaten is more than the remaining carrots, there will be no carrots left. Otherwise, we subtract the number of carrots needed to be eaten from the remaining carrots.

Now, let's implement this in Python.

```python
def eat(number, need, remaining):
    if need > remaining:
        total_eaten = number + remaining
        remaining = 0
    else:
        total_eaten = number + need
        remaining -= need
    return [total_eaten, remaining]
```

This function first checks if the number of carrots needed to be eaten is more than the remaining carrots. If it is, it adds the number of remaining carrots to the number of carrots already eaten and sets the number of remaining carrots to 0. Otherwise, it adds the number of carrots needed to be eaten to the number of carrots already eaten and subtracts the number of carrots needed to be eaten from the remaining carrots. Finally, it returns an array with the total number of eaten carrots and the number of remaining carrots.
