Reasoning:

Given a number `n`, we are to determine the largest number that divides `n` evenly. We can obtain a solution for this by performing the following steps:

1. Initialize a variable `i` to `n - 1`. This variable will be used to keep track of the current number we are checking to see if it divides `n` evenly.

2. Start a while loop that continues as long as `i` is greater than 1.

3. In each iteration of the loop, check if `n` divided by `i` leaves a remainder of 0. If it does, then `i` is a divisor of `n`.

4. If `i` is a divisor of `n`, return `i` as the largest divisor. If `i` is not a divisor of `n`, decrement `i` by 1 and continue to the next iteration of the loop.

5. If the loop completes without finding a divisor, return 1 as the largest divisor (since 1 is a divisor of all numbers).

This approach works because it starts from the largest possible divisor (n - 1) and works its way down to the smallest possible divisor (1). This ensures that the first divisor found is the largest possible divisor.

Now let's implement this in code.

Implementation:

```python
def largest_divisor(n: int) -> int:
    i = n - 1
    while i > 1:
        if n % i == 0:
            return i
        i -= 1
    return 1
```

This function works by starting with `i` as `n - 1` and decrementing `i` in each iteration of the while loop. If `n` divided by `i` leaves a remainder of 0, `i` is returned as the largest divisor. If the loop completes without finding a divisor, 1 is returned as the largest divisor.
