==================================================

The problem is asking to calculate the number of collisions between two sets of cars moving towards each other. Given that each set has 'n' cars, and all cars move at the same speed, it can be inferred that each car from one set will collide with each car from the other set. 

This is because the cars are infinitely sturdy and strong, and they continue moving in their trajectory as if they did not collide. Therefore, the number of collisions will be the product of the number of cars in each set, which is n*n = n^2.

Let's implement this in Python.

```python
def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    This function outputs the number of collisions between two sets of cars moving towards each other.
    """
    # Each car from one set will collide with each car from the other set
    # Therefore, the number of collisions will be the product of the number of cars in each set
    return n * n
```

This function takes an integer 'n' as input, which represents the number of cars in each set. It returns the number of collisions, which is the square of 'n'. 

The time complexity of this function is O(1), as it performs a constant amount of work regardless of the input size. The space complexity is also O(1), as it uses a constant amount of space.
