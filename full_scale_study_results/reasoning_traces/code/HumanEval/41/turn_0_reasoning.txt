Question ID: HumanEval/41
Turn: 0
Dataset Type: code
==================================================

Reasoning:

Given n cars moving from left to right and n cars moving from right to left, we are to determine the number of collisions that would occur. Since all cars are moving at the same speed, each car moving from left to right will collide with exactly one car moving from right to left, and vice versa. Therefore, the total number of collisions will be n.

Approach:

This problem does not require any complex calculations or algorithms. The number of collisions is equal to the number of cars moving in either direction, which is given as input to the function. Therefore, the function simply needs to return the input value.

Implementation:

Here is the Python function implementing the above approach:

```python
def car_race_collision(n: int) -> int:
    """
    Returns the number of collisions in a car race.

    Parameters:
    n (int): The number of cars moving in each direction.

    Returns:
    int: The number of collisions.
    """
    return n
```

This function takes an integer n as input and returns the same integer. The time complexity is O(1), and the space complexity is also O(1).
