Reasoning:

Given a string of parentheses, we are to determine the separate groups of parentheses. We can obtain a solution for this by performing the following steps:
1. Initialize a counter to keep track of the number of open and closed parentheses.
2. Initialize an empty string to keep track of the current group of parentheses.
3. Iterate through the string. For each character in the string:
    - If the character is an open parenthesis, increment the counter and add the character to the current group.
    - If the character is a closed parenthesis, decrement the counter and add the character to the current group.
    - If the counter is zero and the current group is not empty, this means we have found a complete group of parentheses. Add the current group to the list of groups and reset the current group to an empty string.
4. After the loop, return the list of groups.

This approach works because the counter effectively keeps track of the nesting level of the parentheses. When the counter is zero, this means we have found a complete group of parentheses.

Let's implement this now.

Implementation:

```python
from typing import List

def separate_paren_groups(paren_string: str) -> List[str]:
    paren_string = paren_string.replace(" ", "")
    groups = []
    group = ""
    counter = 0
    for char in paren_string:
        if char == '(':
            counter += 1
            group += char
        elif char == ')':
            counter -= 1
            group += char
            if counter == 0:
                groups.append(group)
                group = ""
    return groups
```

This function first removes all spaces from the input string. Then it initializes an empty list to store the groups of parentheses and an empty string to store the current group. It also initializes a counter to zero. It then iterates through each character in the input string. If the character is an open parenthesis, it increments the counter and adds the character to the current group. If the character is a closed parenthesis, it decrements the counter and adds the character to the current group. If the counter is zero, it adds the current group to the list of groups and resets the current group to an empty string. Finally, it returns the list of groups.
