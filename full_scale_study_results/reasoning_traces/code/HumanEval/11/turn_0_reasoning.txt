==================================================

The problem is asking to perform a binary XOR operation on two input strings. XOR stands for exclusive OR. It is a binary operation that is true if exactly one of the binary inputs is true. In other words, it returns true if the two binary inputs are not equal. 

Here is the truth table for XOR operation:

| A | B | A XOR B |
|---|---|---------|
| 0 | 0 |    0    |
| 0 | 1 |    1    |
| 1 | 0 |    1    |
| 1 | 1 |    0    |

The approach to solve this problem is straightforward. We iterate over each character in the input strings simultaneously, perform the XOR operation on the corresponding characters, and append the result to the output string.

Here is the Python function that implements this approach:

```python
def string_xor(a: str, b: str) -> str:
    result = ''
    for i in range(len(a)):
        result += str(int(a[i]) ^ int(b[i]))
    return result
```

In this function, we first initialize an empty string `result` to store the result of the XOR operation. Then we iterate over each character in the input strings `a` and `b` using the `range` function and the `len` function. For each character, we convert it to an integer using the `int` function, perform the XOR operation using the `^` operator, convert the result back to a string using the `str` function, and append it to the `result` string. Finally, we return the `result` string.

This function assumes that the input strings `a` and `b` have the same length. If they have different lengths, we need to pad the shorter string with leading zeros to make their lengths equal before performing the XOR operation.
