==================================================

Reasoning:

Given a list of integers, we are to determine if there are two distinct elements in the list that sum up to zero. We can obtain a solution for this by performing the following steps:
1. Initialize a set to keep track of the elements in the list
2. Iterate through all the elements in the list
3. For each element in the list, check if the negative of the current element exists in the set
4. If it does, return True
5. If it doesn't, add the current element to the set
6. If no pair is found after iterating through all the elements in the list, return False

This approach works because for any two numbers to sum up to zero, one must be the negative of the other. So for each number, we check if its negative is in the set of seen numbers. If it is, we have found a pair that sums to zero. If it isn't, we add the number to the set and continue with the next number.

Let's implement this now.

Implementation:

def pairs_sum_to_zero(l):
    seen = set()
    for num in l:
        if -num in seen:
            return True
        seen.add(num)
    return False

This function works in O(n) time, where n is the length of the list. This is because we are making a single pass through the list. The space complexity is also O(n), as in the worst case, we might need to store all the elements in the set.
