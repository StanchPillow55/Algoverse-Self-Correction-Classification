Question ID: HumanEval/151
Turn: 0
Dataset Type: code
==================================================

The problem is asking to return the sum of squares of the numbers in the list that are odd and positive. If the number is negative or not an integer, we should ignore it. If the list is empty, we should return 0.

To solve the problem I will use the following steps
- Initialize a variable to hold the sum
- Iterate through the given list
- Check if the current number is an integer, positive, and odd
- If it is, square the number and add it to the sum
- Finally, return the sum

Now I will implement this in code.

```python
def double_the_difference(lst):
    sum = 0
    for num in lst:
        if isinstance(num, int) and num > 0 and num % 2 != 0:
            sum += num ** 2
    return sum
```

Let's test the function with the sample testcases

```python
assert double_the_difference([1, 3, 2, 0]) == 10
assert double_the_difference([-1, -2, 0]) == 0
assert double_the_difference([9, -2]) == 81
assert double_the_difference([0]) == 0
```

The function returns the expected output for the sample testcases. I will now test the function with some additional testcases

```python
assert double_the_difference([1, 3, 5, 7, 9]) == 165
assert double_the_difference([-1, -3, -5, -7, -9]) == 0
assert double_the_difference([2, 4, 6, 8, 10]) == 0
assert double_the_difference([]) == 0
```

The function returns the expected output for the additional testcases as well.
