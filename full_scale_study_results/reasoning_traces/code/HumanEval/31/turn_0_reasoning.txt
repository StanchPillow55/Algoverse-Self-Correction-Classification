==================================================

A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. The first few prime numbers are {2, 3, 5, 7, 11, …}. The test of primality of a number n can be done by checking if n has a divisor less than or equal to its square root.

Here is the reasoning process:

1. If the number is less than 2, it's not a prime number. The number 2 is the only even prime number, so if the number is even and greater than 2, it's not prime.

2. For all other numbers, we can check divisibility from 3 up to the square root of the number. We only need to check up to the square root because a larger factor of the number would be a multiple of smaller factor that has already been checked.

3. The step inside the loop is 2. This means that we are checking only odd numbers — even numbers can obviously be divided by 2.

Here is the Python function that implements this reasoning:

```python
def is_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return False
    if n == 2:
        return True
    if n % 2 == 0:
        return False
    max_divisor = int(n**0.5) + 1
    for d in range(3, max_divisor, 2):
        if n % d == 0:
            return False
    return True
```

This function first checks if n is less than 2 (in which case it's not prime) or if n is 2 (the smallest prime number). Then it checks if n is divisible by 2, in which case it's not prime. Then it checks for any odd divisor up to the square root of n. If it finds any, it returns False. If it doesn't find any divisors, it returns True, because n is a prime number.
