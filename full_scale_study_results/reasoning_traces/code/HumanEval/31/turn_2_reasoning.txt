==================================================

To determine if a number \( n \) is prime, we need to check if it has any divisors other than 1 and itself. A prime number is defined as a natural number greater than 1 that cannot be formed by multiplying two smaller natural numbers.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how we can approach this problem:

1. **Handle Small Numbers**: 
   - If \( n \leq 1 \), the number is not prime. By definition, prime numbers are greater than 1.

2. **Check for Divisibility**:
   - A number \( n \) is not prime if it can be divided evenly by any number other than 1 and itself.
   - We only need to check divisibility up to the square root of \( n \). This is because if \( n \) is divisible by some number \( p \), then \( n = p \times q \), and at least one of those factors \( p \) or \( q \) must be less than or equal to the square root of \( n \).

3. **Optimize by Skipping Even Numbers**:
   - If \( n \) is even and greater than 2, it is not prime.
   - For odd numbers, we can skip even numbers during our checks and only test odd divisors.

4. **Implementation Steps**:
   - Check if \( n \leq 1 \). If so, return `False`.
   - If \( n = 2 \), return `True` because 2 is the only even prime number.
   - If \( n \) is even and greater than 2, return `False`.
   - For odd numbers, check divisibility from 3 up to the integer square root of \( n \), incrementing by 2 (to skip even numbers).

Now, let's implement the function `is_prime` based on this reasoning:

```python
def is_prime(n):
    """Return true if a given number is prime, and false otherwise."""
    if n <= 1:
        return False
    if n == 2:
        return True
    if n % 2 == 0:
        return False
    for i in range(3, int(n**0.5) + 1, 2):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True
```

### Explanation of the Code:
- **Line 2-3**: Check if \( n \) is less than or equal to 1. If so, return `False` because such numbers are not prime.
- **Line 4**: Check if \( n \) is 2. Return `True` because 2 is a prime number.
- **Line 5**: Check if \( n \) is even and greater than 2. Return `False` because even numbers greater than 2 are not prime.
- **Line 6-8**: Iterate over odd numbers starting from 3 up to the square root of \( n \). If \( n \) is divisible by any of these numbers, return `False`.
- **Line 9**: If no divisors are found, return `True`, indicating that \( n \) is prime.
