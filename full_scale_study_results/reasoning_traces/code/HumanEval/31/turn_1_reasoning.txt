==================================================

To determine if a number is prime, we need to understand the definition of a prime number. A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. This means that a prime number is only divisible by 1 and the number itself.

### Step-by-step Approach:

1. **Handle Small Numbers:**
   - If the number `n` is less than or equal to 1, it is not prime. Return `False`.

2. **Check for Small Primes:**
   - If `n` is 2 or 3, it is prime. Return `True`. These are the smallest prime numbers.

3. **Eliminate Even Numbers:**
   - If `n` is even and greater than 2, it cannot be prime. Return `False`.

4. **Check Divisibility for Odd Numbers:**
   - For numbers greater than 3, we need to check if they are divisible by any odd number up to the square root of `n`. This is because if `n` is divisible by any number greater than its square root, the corresponding factor would be less than the square root, and we would have already checked it.
   - We can iterate over odd numbers starting from 3 up to the integer value of the square root of `n` (inclusive). If `n` is divisible by any of these numbers, it is not prime.

5. **Return Result:**
   - If no divisors are found, the number is prime, and we return `True`.

### Implementation:

```python
import math

def is_prime(n):
    """Return true if a given number is prime, and false otherwise."""
    # Step 1: Handle numbers less than or equal to 1
    if n <= 1:
        return False
    
    # Step 2: Check for small primes
    if n <= 3:
        return True
    
    # Step 3: Eliminate even numbers greater than 2
    if n % 2 == 0:
        return False
    
    # Step 4: Check divisibility for odd numbers up to sqrt(n)
    max_divisor = int(math.sqrt(n))
    for i in range(3, max_divisor + 1, 2):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    
    # Step 5: If no divisors found, n is prime
    return True
```

### Explanation:

- **Efficiency:** The algorithm efficiently checks for primality by reducing the number of checks needed. Instead of checking all numbers up to `n-1`, it only checks up to the square root of `n`, and only odd numbers after eliminating even numbers.
- **Edge Cases:** The function correctly handles edge cases such as numbers less than or equal to 1, and small prime numbers like 2 and 3.
- **Correctness:** The function is designed to return `True` for prime numbers and `False` for non-prime numbers, as demonstrated in the provided test cases.
