==================================================

Reasoning:

The problem is asking to return a new string where all the words are replaced by a new word where all the characters arranged in ascending order based on ASCII value.

To solve the problem I will use the following steps
- Split the string by space to get the words in the string
- For each word in the string, sort the characters in the word in ascending order based on ASCII value
- Join the sorted characters to form a new word
- Join the new words with space to form a new string
- Return the new string

Implementation: 

Now I will implement the solution in python. 

```python
def anti_shuffle(s):
    # Split the string by space to get the words in the string
    words = s.split(' ')
    new_words = []
    # For each word in the string
    for word in words:
        # sort the characters in the word in ascending order based on ASCII value
        sorted_word = sorted(word)
        # Join the sorted characters to form a new word
        new_word = ''.join(sorted_word)
        new_words.append(new_word)
    # Join the new words with space to form a new string
    new_s = ' '.join(new_words)
    # Return the new string
    return new_s
```

This function works by first splitting the input string into words. Then, for each word, it sorts the characters in the word in ascending order based on their ASCII values. The sorted characters are then joined together to form a new word. Finally, all the new words are joined together with spaces to form the final string, which is returned.
