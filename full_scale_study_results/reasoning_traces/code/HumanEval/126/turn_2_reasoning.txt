Question ID: HumanEval/126
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: code
==================================================

Reasoning:

The problem is asking to return True if the given list is sorted in ascending order and does not contain more than one duplicate of the same number, otherwise return False.

To solve the problem I will use the following steps
- Initialize a variable, count, to 0. This will be used to count the number of duplicates of a number.
- Iterate through the given list
- - For each number in the list, check if it is equal to the next number in the list. If it is, increment the count variable by 1.
- - If the count variable is greater than 1, return False because there are more than one duplicates of the same number.
- - If the current number is greater than the next number, return False because the list is not sorted in ascending order.
- If the loop completes without returning False, return True because the list is sorted in ascending order and does not contain more than one duplicate of the same number.

Now I will implement this logic into code.

Implementation:

def is_sorted(lst):
    count = 0
    for i in range(len(lst) - 1):
        if lst[i] == lst[i + 1]:
            count += 1
            if count > 1:
                return False
        elif lst[i] > lst[i + 1]:
            return False
        else:
            count = 0
    return True

The time complexity for this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the list. This is because we are iterating through the list once. The space complexity is O(1), because we are using a constant amount of space to store the count variable.
