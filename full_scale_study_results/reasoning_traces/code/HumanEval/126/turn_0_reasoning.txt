Reasoning:

Given a list of numbers, we are to determine if the list is sorted in ascending order. If the list has more than one duplicate of the same number, we are to return False. We can obtain a solution for this by performing the following steps:
1. Initialize a variable `count` to keep track of the number of times a number appears in the list
2. Initialize a variable `prev` to keep track of the previous number in the list
3. Iterate through all the elements in the list
    - On each iteration, check if the current number is less than the previous number. If it is, then the list is not sorted in ascending order thus we would return False
    - If the current number is equal to the previous number, increment the count by one. If the count is greater than 1, then we have more than one duplicate of the same number thus we would return False
    - If the current number is greater than the previous number, set the count to 1 and update the previous number to the current number
4. If we are able to iterate through all the elements in the list without returning False, then the list is sorted in ascending order thus we would return True

Example
---------
Suppose we have a single test case such that the list is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. On the first iteration, the previous number is set to 1 and the count is set to 1. On the second iteration, the current number is 2 which is greater than the previous number 1. Thus we set the count to 1 and update the previous number to 2. We would perform similar operations for the rest of the elements in the list. Since we were able to iterate through all the elements in the list without returning False, the list is sorted in ascending order thus we would return True

Implementation:
----------------
We can implement the solution as follows:

```python
def is_sorted(lst):
    # check if list is empty
    if len(lst) == 0:
        return True

    # initialize count and previous number
    count = 1
    prev = lst[0]

    # iterate through all elements in the list
    for num in lst[1:]:
        # check if current number is less than previous number
        if num < prev:
            return False
        # check if current number is equal to previous number
        elif num == prev:
            count += 1
            # check if count is greater than 1
            if count > 1:
                return False
        # check if current number is greater than previous number
        else:
            count = 1
            prev = num

    # list is sorted in ascending order
    return True
```

This function works by iterating through the list and checking if each number is less than, equal to, or greater than the previous number. If the number is less than the previous number, the function returns False because the list is not sorted in ascending order. If the number is equal to the previous number, the function increments a count and checks if the count is greater than 1. If the count is greater than 1, the function returns False because there are more than one duplicates of the same number. If the number is greater than the previous number, the function resets the count to 1 and updates the previous number. If the function is able to iterate through all the numbers without returning False, it returns True because the list is sorted in ascending order.
