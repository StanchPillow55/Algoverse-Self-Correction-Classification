Dataset Type: code
==================================================

Reasoning:

Given a list of numbers, we are to determine if the list is sorted in ascending order. If the list has more than 1 duplicate of the same number, we should return False. We can obtain a solution for this by performing the following steps:
1. Initialize a variable `count` to keep track of the number of duplicates in the list
2. Iterate through the entire list and on each iteration, check if the current number is equal to the next number in the list. If it is, increment the count variable by one. If the count variable is greater than 1, return False
3. If the list is not in ascending order, return False
4. If none of the above conditions are met, return True

Implementation:

Now we would implement the steps in the function `is_sorted`. The function would take in a list as a parameter and return a boolean indicating whether the list is sorted in ascending order and does not contain more than one duplicate of the same number. 

Here is the Python function: 

```python
def is_sorted(lst):
    count = 0
    for i in range(len(lst) - 1):
        if lst[i] == lst[i + 1]:
            count += 1
        if count > 1 or lst[i] > lst[i + 1]:
            return False
    return True
```

This function works by iterating through the list and checking if the current number is equal to the next number. If it is, it increments a count variable. If the count variable is greater than 1 or if the current number is greater than the next number (indicating that the list is not in ascending order), it returns False. If it gets through the entire list without returning False, it returns True, indicating that the list is sorted in ascending order and does not contain more than one duplicate of the same number.
