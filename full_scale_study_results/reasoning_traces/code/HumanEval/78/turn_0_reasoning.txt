Reasoning:

Given a hexadecimal number as a string, we are to determine the number of hexadecimal digits that are prime. A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that is not a product of two smaller natural numbers. Hexadecimal digits are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, A, B, C, D, E, F. Prime numbers are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17,... So we have to determine a number of the following digits: 2, 3, 5, 7, B (=decimal 11), D (=decimal 13). 

We can obtain a solution for the problem prompt by performing the following steps:
1. Initialize a variable `count` to keep track of the number of prime hexadecimal digits
2. Iterate through all the characters in the hexadecimal string
3. On each iteration, check if the current character is a prime hexadecimal digit (i.e. 2, 3, 5, 7, B, D)
4. If it is, increment the `count` variable by 1
5. After iterating through all the characters in the hexadecimal string, return the `count` variable

Example
----------
Suppose we have a single test case such that the hexadecimal string is `ABED1A33`. The prime hexadecimal digits are `B`, `D`, `3`, `3`. Thus the output would be `4`

Implementation
-------------------
We can implement this as follows: 

```python
def hex_key(num):
    # prime hexadecimal digits
    primes = ['2', '3', '5', '7', 'B', 'D']
    
    # count of prime hexadecimal digits
    count = 0
    
    # iterate through all characters in the hexadecimal string
    for char in num:
        # check if current character is a prime hexadecimal digit
        if char in primes:
            # increment count
            count += 1
            
    return count
```

This function works by iterating through each character in the input string `num`, checking if it is in the list of prime hexadecimal digits `primes`, and if it is, incrementing the count. The function then returns the count.
