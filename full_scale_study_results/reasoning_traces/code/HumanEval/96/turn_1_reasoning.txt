==================================================

The problem is asking to return a list of prime numbers that are less than the given number.

To solve the problem I will use the following steps
- First, I will define a helper function that checks if a number is prime or not.
- A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. The first few prime numbers are {2, 3, 5, 7, 11, â€¦}.
- To check if a number is prime or not, I will iterate from 2 to the square root of the number. If the number is divisible by any number in the iteration, then the number is not prime, and I will return False. If the number is not divisible by any number in the iteration, then the number is prime, and I will return True.
- After defining the helper function, I will define the main function that takes a non-negative integer and returns a list of the first n integers that are prime numbers and less than n.
- I will define an empty list to store the prime numbers.
- I will iterate from 2 to the given number. If the number is prime, I will add it to the list.
- Finally, I will return the list of prime numbers.

Now I will implement this.

```python
import math

def is_prime(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return False
    if n == 2:
        return True
    if n % 2 == 0:
        return False
    sqrt_n = math.isqrt(n)
    for i in range(3, sqrt_n + 1, 2):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

def count_up_to(n):
    primes = []
    for i in range(2, n):
        if is_prime(i):
            primes.append(i)
    return primes
```

This solution works for any non-negative integer n and returns a list of prime numbers less than n. The time complexity is O(n sqrt(n)) because for each number up to n we are checking if it is prime, which takes O(sqrt(n)) time. The space complexity is O(n) because in the worst case we are storing all numbers up to n in the primes list.
