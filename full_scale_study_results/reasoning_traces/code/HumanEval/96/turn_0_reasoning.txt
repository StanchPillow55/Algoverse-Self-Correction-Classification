==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to generate a list of prime numbers less than the given number 'n'. 

A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. The first few prime numbers are {2, 3, 5, 7, 11, â€¦}. 

The approach to solve this problem is as follows:

1. Initialize an empty list to store the prime numbers.
2. Iterate over the numbers from 2 to 'n'.
3. For each number, check if it is prime.
4. If it is prime, append it to the list.
5. Continue this process until we have checked all numbers less than 'n'.
6. Return the list of prime numbers.

To check if a number is prime, we can use the following approach:

1. If the number is less than 2, it is not prime.
2. If the number is 2, it is prime.
3. For numbers greater than 2, check if it is divisible by any number up to its square root. If it is divisible, it is not prime. If it is not divisible by any number, it is prime.

Now, let's implement this in Python:

```python
def count_up_to(n):
    def is_prime(num):
        if num < 2:
            return False
        for i in range(2, int(num**0.5) + 1):
            if num % i == 0:
                return False
        return True

    primes = []
    for i in range(2, n):
        if is_prime(i):
            primes.append(i)
    return primes
```

This function works by first defining a helper function `is_prime()` that checks if a number is prime. Then it initializes an empty list `primes` to store the prime numbers. It iterates over the numbers from 2 to 'n', checks if each number is prime using the `is_prime()` function, and if it is, appends it to the `primes` list. Finally, it returns the `primes` list.
