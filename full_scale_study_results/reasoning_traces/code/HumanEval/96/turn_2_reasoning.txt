Question ID: HumanEval/96
Turn: 2
Dataset Type: code
==================================================

Reasoning:

The problem is asking to return a list of prime numbers that are less than the given number. A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. The first few prime numbers are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, and 13.

To solve the problem I will use the following steps
- Define a helper function that checks if a number is prime or not.
- Initialize an empty list to store the prime numbers.
- Iterate from 2 up to the given number.
- For each number, check if it is a prime number using the helper function.
- If it is a prime number, add it to the list.
- Finally, return the list of prime numbers.

Implementation: 

Now I will implement the solution in Python.
