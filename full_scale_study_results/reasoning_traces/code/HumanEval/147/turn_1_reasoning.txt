==================================================

First, let's understand the problem statement. We are given a positive integer n and we need to create an array of length n such that each element a[i] is calculated as i * i - i + 1. Then, we need to find the number of triples (a[i], a[j], a[k]) where i < j < k and the sum of these triples is a multiple of 3.

Let's try to understand the pattern of the array a. The first few elements of the array a for n = 5 are [1, 3, 7, 13, 21]. If we look closely, we can see that all elements are 1 modulo 3 except for the second element which is 0 modulo 3. This pattern will continue for all n because (i * i - i + 1) % 3 = 1 for all i except i = 2. 

So, to find the triples (a[i], a[j], a[k]) where i < j < k and the sum of these triples is a multiple of 3, we need to find the number of ways to choose 3 elements from the array such that their sum is a multiple of 3. Since all elements are 1 modulo 3 except for the second element, the only way to get a sum that is a multiple of 3 is to either choose the second element and any other two elements or choose three elements that are 1 modulo 3. 

The number of ways to choose 3 elements from n elements is given by the combination formula nC3 = n! / ((n-3)! * 3!). However, since the second element is 0 modulo 3, we need to subtract the number of ways to choose 3 elements from the first 2 elements which is 2C3 = 0. So, the total number of valid triples is nC3 - 2C3.

Now, let's implement this solution in Python.

```python
def get_max_triples(n):
    # Calculate the factorial of n
    fact_n = 1
    for i in range(1, n+1):
        fact_n *= i

    # Calculate the factorial of n-3
    fact_n_3 = 1
    for i in range(1, n-2):
        fact_n_3 *= i

    # Calculate the number of ways to choose 3 elements from n elements
    nC3 = fact_n / (fact_n_3 * 6)

    # Since the second element is 0 modulo 3, subtract the number of ways to choose 3 elements from the first 2 elements
    valid_triples = nC3 - 0

    return int(valid_triples)
```

This function first calculates the factorial of n and n-3. Then, it calculates the number of ways to choose 3 elements from n elements using the combination formula. Finally, it subtracts the number of ways to choose 3 elements from the first 2 elements and returns the result.
