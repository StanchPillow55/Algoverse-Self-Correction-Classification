==================================================

First, let's understand the problem. We are given a positive integer n. We have to create an integer array a of length n. For each i (1 ≤ i ≤ n), the value of a[i] = i * i - i + 1. We need to return the number of triples (a[i], a[j], a[k]) of a where i < j < k, and a[i] + a[j] + a[k] is a multiple of 3.

Let's break down the problem:

1. We need to create an array of length n, where each element is calculated as i * i - i + 1.
2. We need to find all triples (a[i], a[j], a[k]) where i < j < k.
3. We need to count the number of these triples where the sum of the elements is a multiple of 3.

The first step is straightforward. We can use a list comprehension to create the array.

The second step is a bit more complex. We need to find all triples where the indices are in increasing order. We can do this by using three nested loops. The outer loop will iterate over all elements, the middle loop will iterate over all elements after the current element of the outer loop, and the inner loop will iterate over all elements after the current element of the middle loop. This will ensure that we find all triples where i < j < k.

The third step is also straightforward. We just need to check if the sum of the elements of the triple is a multiple of 3. If it is, we increment a counter.

Finally, we return the counter.

Here is the Python code that implements this approach:

```python
def get_max_triples(n):
    # Step 1: Create the array
    a = [i * i - i + 1 for i in range(1, n + 1)]

    # Step 2 and 3: Find all triples and count the ones where the sum is a multiple of 3
    count = 0
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(i + 1, n):
            for k in range(j + 1, n):
                if (a[i] + a[j] + a[k]) % 3 == 0:
                    count += 1

    return count
```

This solution works, but it is not very efficient. The time complexity is O(n^3) because of the three nested loops. However, since the problem does not specify any constraints on the input size, this solution should be acceptable.
