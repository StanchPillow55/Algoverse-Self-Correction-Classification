Reasoning:

Given a positive integer `n`, we are to determine the number of triples `(a[i], a[j], a[k])` of `a` where `i < j < k`, and `a[i] + a[j] + a[k]` is a multiple of `3`. We can obtain a solution for this by performing the following steps:
1. Initialize a list `a` and a variable `count` to keep track of the number of triples `(a[i], a[j], a[k])` of `a` where `i < j < k`, and `a[i] + a[j] + a[k]` is a multiple of `3`.
2. Next, we would iterate through the range of the given integer `n` and at each `i-th` iteration, we would calculate the value of `a[i] = i * i - i + 1` and append it to the list `a`.
3. After obtaining the list `a`, we would find all possible triples `(a[i], a[j], a[k])` of `a` where `i < j < k`, and `a[i] + a[j] + a[k]` is a multiple of `3`. We can do this by iterating through the list `a` and at each `i-th` iteration, we would iterate through the list `a` from the `i+1-th` index and at each `j-th` iteration, we would iterate through the list `a` from the `j+1-th` index. At each `k-th` iteration, we would check if the sum of `a[i] + a[j] + a[k]` is a multiple of `3`. If it is, we would increment the count of the number of triples by `1`.
4. Finally, we would output the count of the number of triples `(a[i], a[j], a[k])` of `a` where `i < j < k`, and `a[i] + a[j] + a[k]` is a multiple of `3`.

Example
----------
Suppose `n = 5`, the list `a` would be `[1, 3, 7, 13, 21]`. The only valid triple is `(1, 7, 13)` since `1 + 7 + 13 = 21` which is a multiple of `3`. Thus the output would be `1`.

Implementation
-------------------
We can implement this in python as follows:

```python
def get_max_triples(n):
  # step 1
  a = []
  count = 0

  # step 2
  for i in range(1, n+1):
    a.append(i * i - i + 1)

  # step 3
  for i in range(len(a)):
    for j in range(i+1, len(a)):
      for k in range(j+1, len(a)):
        if (a[i] + a[j] + a[k]) % 3 == 0:
          count += 1

  # step 4
  return count
```

This solution has a time complexity of `O(n^3)` due to the three nested loops.
