==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Check if n is greater than m. If it is, return -1 as per the problem statement.
2. If n is not greater than m, calculate the average of the numbers from n to m. This can be done by calculating the sum of all numbers from n to m and then dividing by the total number of numbers (which is m - n + 1). The sum of all numbers from n to m can be calculated using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series: sum = (m - n + 1) * (n + m) / 2.
3. Round the average to the nearest integer. This can be done using the round() function in Python.
4. Convert the rounded average to binary. This can be done using the bin() function in Python, which returns a string that starts with "0b". 
5. Return the binary representation of the rounded average.

Now let's implement this in Python:

```python
def rounded_avg(n, m):
    if n > m:
        return -1
    else:
        avg = (m - n + 1) * (n + m) / 2 / (m - n + 1)
        rounded_avg = round(avg)
        return bin(rounded_avg)
```

This function first checks if n is greater than m. If it is, it returns -1. Otherwise, it calculates the average of the numbers from n to m, rounds it to the nearest integer, converts it to binary, and returns the binary representation.
