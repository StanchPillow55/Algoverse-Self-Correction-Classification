Reasoning:

The problem is asking to return the number of vowels in a given string. The vowels are 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u' and 'y' but 'y' is only considered a vowel when it is at the end of the word.

To solve the problem I will use the following steps
- Initialize a counter to 0
- Convert the given string to lower case to make the comparison case insensitive
- Iterate through the given string
- If the current character is a vowel increment the counter by 1
- If the current character is 'y' and it is the last character in the string increment the counter by 1
- Finally return the counter

Implementation:

Now I will implement the solution in Python.

```python
def vowels_count(s):
    count = 0
    s = s.lower()
    for i in range(len(s)):
        if s[i] in 'aeiou':
            count += 1
        elif s[i] == 'y' and i == len(s) - 1:
            count += 1
    return count
```

Test:

I will now test the function with the provided test cases and some additional ones.

```python
print(vowels_count("abcde"))  # It should return 2
print(vowels_count("ACEDY"))  # It should return 3
print(vowels_count("y"))  # It should return 1
print(vowels_count("Y"))  # It should return 1
print(vowels_count("Yy"))  # It should return 1
print(vowels_count("YyY"))  # It should return 2
```

In the first test case, the vowels are 'a' and 'e' so the function should return 2.
In the second test case, the vowels are 'a', 'e' and 'y' so the function should return 3.
In the third test case, 'y' is a vowel because it is at the end of the word so the function should return 1.
In the fourth test case, 'Y' is a vowel because it is at the end of the word and the function is case insensitive so the function should return 1.
In the fifth test case, the vowels are 'y' so the function should return 1.
In the sixth test case, the vowels are 'y' and 'Y' so the function should return 2.
