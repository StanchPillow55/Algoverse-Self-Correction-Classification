Question ID: HumanEval/5
Turn: 1
Dataset Type: code
==================================================

The problem is asking to insert a given number between every two consecutive elements of the input list.

To solve the problem I will use the following steps
- Initialize an empty list to store the result
- Iterate through the given list
- For each element in the list, add the element and the delimiter to the result list. But for the last element in the list, we only add the element not the delimiter.

Let's write the code now.

```python
from typing import List

def intersperse(numbers: List[int], delimeter: int) -> List[int]:
    result = []
    for i in range(len(numbers)):
        result.append(numbers[i])
        if i != len(numbers) - 1:
            result.append(delimeter)
    return result
```

Let's test the function with the sample testcases

```python
assert intersperse([], 4) == []
assert intersperse([1, 2, 3], 4) == [1, 4, 2, 4, 3]
```

The function passes all the sample testcases. I will assume my code is correct. 

The time complexity of the function is O(n), where n is the number of elements in the list. The space complexity is also O(n), where n is the number of elements in the list.
