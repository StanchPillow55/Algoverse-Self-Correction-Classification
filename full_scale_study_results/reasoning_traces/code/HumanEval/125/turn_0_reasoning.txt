The problem is asking to split the given string into a list of words. The splitting is based on the following rules:

1. If the string contains whitespaces, split the string on whitespaces.
2. If the string does not contain whitespaces but contains commas, split the string on commas.
3. If the string does not contain either whitespaces or commas, count the number of lowercase letters in the string that have an odd order in the alphabet and return this count.

To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:

1. Check if the string contains whitespaces. If it does, split the string on whitespaces and return the resulting list of words.
2. If the string does not contain whitespaces, check if it contains commas. If it does, split the string on commas and return the resulting list of words.
3. If the string does not contain either whitespaces or commas, iterate over each character in the string. If the character is a lowercase letter and its order in the alphabet is odd, increment a counter. Return this counter at the end.

Here is the Python function that implements this logic:

```python
def split_words(txt):
    if ' ' in txt:
        return txt.split()
    elif ',' in txt:
        return txt.split(',')
    else:
        count = 0
        for char in txt:
            if char.islower():
                if (ord(char) - ord('a')) % 2 != 0:
                    count += 1
        return count
```

This function first checks if the string `txt` contains a whitespace. If it does, it splits `txt` on whitespaces using the `split` method and returns the resulting list of words. If `txt` does not contain a whitespace, the function checks if `txt` contains a comma. If it does, it splits `txt` on commas and returns the resulting list of words. If `txt` does not contain either a whitespace or a comma, the function iterates over each character in `txt`. If the character is a lowercase letter and its order in the alphabet is odd (which is checked by subtracting the ASCII value of 'a' from the ASCII value of the character and checking if the result is odd), the function increments a counter. The function finally returns this counter.
