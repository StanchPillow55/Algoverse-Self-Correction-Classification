Reasoning:

Given a string, we are to determine if the string contains any letters. If it does, we are to reverse the case of the letters in the string. If it does not, we are to reverse the string. We can obtain a solution for this by performing the following steps:

1. Initialize a variable `letters` to keep track of the number of letters in the string. 

2. Iterate through all the characters in the string. On each iteration, we would check if the character is a letter. If it is, we would increment the `letters` variable by one and reverse the case of the letter. If it is not, we would keep the character as it is.

3. After iterating through all the characters in the string, we would check if the `letters` variable is equal to zero. If it is, it means that there are no letters in the string. Thus, we would reverse the string. If it is not, we would return the string as it is.

Implementation:

Now we would implement the steps in code as follows:

```python
def solve(s):
    letters = 0
    result = ''
    for char in s:
        if char.isalpha():
            letters += 1
            if char.islower():
                result += char.upper()
            else:
                result += char.lower()
        else:
            result += char
    if letters == 0:
        return result[::-1]
    else:
        return result
```

This function works by iterating through each character in the string. If the character is a letter, it increments the `letters` variable and appends the reversed case of the letter to the `result` string. If the character is not a letter, it appends the character as it is to the `result` string. After iterating through all the characters, it checks if the `letters` variable is zero. If it is, it returns the reversed `result` string. If it is not, it returns the `result` string as it is.
