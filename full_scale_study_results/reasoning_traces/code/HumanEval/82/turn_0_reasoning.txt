==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to check if the length of the string is a prime number. A prime number is a number that has exactly two distinct positive divisors: 1 and itself. So, we need to write a helper function to check if a number is prime.

Here's the step-by-step plan:

1. Calculate the length of the string.
2. Check if the length is a prime number.
3. If it is a prime number, return True.
4. If it is not a prime number, return False.

Now, let's write the helper function to check if a number is prime. We'll iterate from 2 to the square root of the number (because a larger factor of the number would be a multiple of smaller factor that has already been checked). If the number is divisible by any number in this range, it is not a prime number. If it is not divisible by any number in this range, it is a prime number.

Here's the Python code for the problem:

```python
import math

def prime_length(string):
    """Write a function that takes a string and returns True if the string
    length is a prime number or False otherwise
    """
    def is_prime(n):
        """Check if a number is prime."""
        if n < 2:
            return False
        for i in range(2, math.isqrt(n) + 1):
            if n % i == 0:
                return False
        return True

    return is_prime(len(string))
```

Let's test the function with the provided examples:

```python
print(prime_length('Hello'))  # True
print(prime_length('abcdcba'))  # True
print(prime_length('kittens'))  # True
print(prime_length('orange'))  # False
```

The function works as expected.
