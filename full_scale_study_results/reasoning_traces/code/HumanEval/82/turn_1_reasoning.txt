==================================================

To solve this problem, we need to first understand what a prime number is. A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. The first few prime numbers are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, and 13.

The problem requires us to check if the length of a given string is a prime number. To do this, we first need to find the length of the string. Then, we need to check if this length is a prime number.

To check if a number is prime, we can use a simple algorithm. We start by checking if the number is less than 2 (the smallest prime number is 2). If it is, we return False. Then, we check if the number is divisible by any number from 2 to the square root of the number. If it is, we return False. If the number is not divisible by any of these numbers, it is a prime number, and we return True.

Here is the Python function that implements this logic:

```python
def prime_length(string):
    # Find the length of the string
    length = len(string)

    # Check if the length is less than 2
    if length < 2:
        return False

    # Check if the length is divisible by any number up to its square root
    for i in range(2, int(length**0.5) + 1):
        if length % i == 0:
            return False

    # If the length is not divisible by any number, it is a prime number
    return True
```

This function works by first finding the length of the string. It then checks if this length is a prime number by checking if it is divisible by any number from 2 to its square root. If the length is divisible by any of these numbers, it is not a prime number, and the function returns False. If the length is not divisible by any of these numbers, it is a prime number, and the function returns True.
