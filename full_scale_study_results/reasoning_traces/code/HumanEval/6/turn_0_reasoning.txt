Reasoning:

The problem is asking to find the maximum depth of nested parentheses for each group in the given string. The groups are separated by spaces. 

To solve this problem, we can use a stack data structure. We iterate over each character in the string. If the character is an opening parenthesis '(', we push it into the stack. If the character is a closing parenthesis ')', we pop an element from the stack. The depth of the nested parentheses at any point is the size of the stack. We keep track of the maximum depth for each group. 

When we encounter a space, we know that we have finished processing a group, so we add the maximum depth of the current group to the result list and reset the maximum depth and the stack for the next group.

Here is the Python function implementing this approach:

```python
from typing import List

def parse_nested_parens(paren_string: str) -> List[int]:
    stack = []
    max_depth = 0
    current_depth = 0
    result = []
    for char in paren_string:
        if char == '(':
            stack.append(char)
            current_depth = len(stack)
            max_depth = max(max_depth, current_depth)
        elif char == ')':
            stack.pop()
        elif char == ' ':
            result.append(max_depth)
            stack = []
            max_depth = 0
    result.append(max_depth)  # for the last group
    return result
```

This function works by maintaining a stack of parentheses and a counter for the maximum depth of nesting. When it encounters an opening parenthesis, it increases the current depth and updates the maximum depth if necessary. When it encounters a closing parenthesis, it decreases the current depth. When it encounters a space, it resets the current depth and the maximum depth for the next group. After processing all characters in the string, it returns the list of maximum depths for all groups.
