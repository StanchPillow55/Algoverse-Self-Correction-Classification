Reasoning:

Given a string of musical notes, we are to determine the number of beats each note lasts. We can obtain a solution for this by performing the following steps:
1. Initialize an empty list `beats`
2. Split the string into a list of notes
3. Iterate through the list of notes. For each note, check if it is a whole note, half note or quarter note and append the corresponding number of beats to the `beats` list
4. Return the `beats` list

Approach:

1. Split the string into a list of notes using the `split` function
2. Initialize an empty list `beats`
3. Iterate through the list of notes. For each note:
   - If the note is 'o', it is a whole note and lasts four beats. Append 4 to `beats`
   - If the note is 'o|', it is a half note and lasts two beats. Append 2 to `beats`
   - If the note is '.|', it is a quarter note and lasts one beat. Append 1 to `beats`
4. Return `beats`

Implementation:

Here is the Python function that implements the above approach:

```python
from typing import List

def parse_music(music_string: str) -> List[int]:
    notes = music_string.split()
    beats = []
    for note in notes:
        if note == 'o':
            beats.append(4)
        elif note == 'o|':
            beats.append(2)
        elif note == '.|':
            beats.append(1)
    return beats
```

This function takes a string `music_string` as input, splits it into a list of notes, and then iterates through the list, appending the corresponding number of beats for each note to the `beats` list. Finally, it returns the `beats` list.
