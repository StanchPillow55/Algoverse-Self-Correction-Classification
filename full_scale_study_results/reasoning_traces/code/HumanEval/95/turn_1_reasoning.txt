Reasoning:

Given a dictionary, we are to determine if all keys in the dictionary are either in lower case or upper case. We can obtain a solution for this by performing the following steps:
1. Check if the dictionary is empty. If it is, we would return False.
2. Initialize two boolean variables `lower_case` and `upper_case` to True.
3. Iterate through all the keys in the dictionary. For each key, we would check if it is a string. If it is not a string, we would return False.
4. If the key is a string, we would check if it is in lower case or upper case. If it is not in lower case, we would set `lower_case` to False. If it is not in upper case, we would set `upper_case` to False.
5. After iterating through all the keys, we would check if either `lower_case` or `upper_case` is True. If either of them is True, we would return True. Otherwise, we would return False.

This approach works because it checks all the keys in the dictionary and ensures that they are all either in lower case or upper case.

Now let's implement this in code.

Implementation:

```python
def check_dict_case(dict):
    # Step 1: Check if the dictionary is empty
    if not dict:
        return False

    # Step 2: Initialize lower_case and upper_case to True
    lower_case = True
    upper_case = True

    # Step 3: Iterate through all the keys in the dictionary
    for key in dict:
        # Check if the key is a string
        if not isinstance(key, str):
            return False

        # Step 4: Check if the key is in lower case or upper case
        if key != key.lower():
            lower_case = False
        if key != key.upper():
            upper_case = False

    # Step 5: Check if either lower_case or upper_case is True
    return lower_case or upper_case
```

This function works as expected and solves the problem. It checks if all keys in the dictionary are either in lower case or upper case and returns True if they are, and False otherwise. It also returns False if the dictionary is empty.
