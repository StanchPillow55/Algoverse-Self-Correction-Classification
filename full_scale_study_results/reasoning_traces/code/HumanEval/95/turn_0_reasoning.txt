Reasoning:

Given a dictionary, we are to determine if all the keys in the dictionary are either in lower case or upper case. We can obtain a solution for this by performing the following steps:
1. Check if the dictionary is empty. If it is, return False.
2. Initialize two boolean variables, `lower` and `upper`, to False. These will be used to track if we have encountered a lower case or upper case key.
3. Iterate through the keys in the dictionary. For each key, check if it is a string. If it is not, return False. If it is, check if it is in lower case or upper case and update the `lower` or `upper` variable accordingly.
4. After the loop, check the values of `lower` and `upper`. If both are True, it means we have both lower case and upper case keys, so return False. If both are False, it means we have no keys or no string keys, so return False. Otherwise, return True.

Implementation:

Now we can implement this plan in code. We will use the `isinstance` function to check if a key is a string, and the `islower` and `isupper` methods to check if a string is in lower case or upper case. We will use a for loop to iterate through the keys in the dictionary. 

Here is the Python function that implements this plan:

```python
def check_dict_case(dict):
    # Step 1: Check if the dictionary is empty
    if not dict:
        return False

    # Step 2: Initialize lower and upper to False
    lower = False
    upper = False

    # Step 3: Iterate through the keys in the dictionary
    for key in dict:
        # Check if the key is a string
        if not isinstance(key, str):
            return False
        # Check if the key is in lower case or upper case
        if key.islower():
            lower = True
        elif key.isupper():
            upper = True

    # Step 4: Check the values of lower and upper
    if lower and upper:
        return False
    elif not lower and not upper:
        return False
    else:
        return True
```
This function should work as expected for the given problem. It checks if all keys in a dictionary are either in lower case or upper case, and returns False if the dictionary is empty or if it contains keys that are not strings.
