Reasoning:

Given a dictionary, we are to determine if all the keys in the dictionary are either in lower case or upper case. We can obtain a solution for this by performing the following steps:
1. Check if the dictionary is empty. If it is, we would return False
2. Initialize two variables `lower_case` and `upper_case` to keep track of the number of keys in the dictionary that are in lower case and upper case respectively
3. Iterate through all the keys in the dictionary. On each iteration, we would check if the key is a string and if it is in lower case. If it is, we would increment the `lower_case` variable by 1. If it is not, we would check if the key is a string and if it is in upper case. If it is, we would increment the `upper_case` variable by 1
4. Finally, we would check if the number of keys in the dictionary is equal to the number of keys in lower case or if the number of keys in the dictionary is equal to the number of keys in upper case. If it is, we would return True else we would return False

Plan:
1. Check if the dictionary is empty. If it is, return False
2. Initialize two variables `lower_case` and `upper_case` to keep track of the number of keys in the dictionary that are in lower case and upper case respectively
3. Iterate through all the keys in the dictionary. On each iteration, check if the key is a string and if it is in lower case. If it is, increment the `lower_case` variable by 1. If it is not, check if the key is a string and if it is in upper case. If it is, increment the `upper_case` variable by 1
4. Finally, check if the number of keys in the dictionary is equal to the number of keys in lower case or if the number of keys in the dictionary is equal to the number of keys in upper case. If it is, return True else return False

Let's implement this plan in code.

Implementation:

def check_dict_case(dict):
    if not dict:
        return False

    lower_case = 0
    upper_case = 0

    for key in dict:
        if isinstance(key, str) and key.islower():
            lower_case += 1
        elif isinstance(key, str) and key.isupper():
            upper_case += 1

    return len(dict) == lower_case or len(dict) == upper_case
