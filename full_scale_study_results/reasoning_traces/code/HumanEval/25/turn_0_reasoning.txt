==================================================

The problem is asking to return a list of prime factors of a given integer. The prime factors should be listed in the order from smallest to largest. Each of the factors should be listed the number of times corresponding to how many times it appears in the factorization. The input number should be equal to the product of all factors.

To solve the problem I will use the following steps
- Initialize an empty list to store the prime factors
- Start a loop from 2 (the smallest prime number) to the input number
- In each iteration, check if the number is divisible by the current loop variable
- If it is divisible, append the loop variable to the list of prime factors and divide the number by the loop variable
- Continue this process until the number is not divisible by the loop variable
- Continue the loop until the number is reduced to 1
- Return the list of prime factors

Now I will implement this approach in code.

```python
from typing import List

def factorize(n: int) -> List[int]:
    factors = []
    i = 2
    while i * i <= n:
        if n % i:
            i += 1
        else:
            n //= i
            factors.append(i)
    if n > 1:
        factors.append(n)
    return factors
```

This function works by repeatedly dividing the input number by its smallest prime factor, which is found by checking divisibility starting from 2. The factors are added to the list in the order they are found, which is from smallest to largest because of the way the loop is structured. The loop continues until the number has been reduced to 1, at which point all of its prime factors have been found. If the number is greater than 1 after the loop, it is itself a prime number and is added to the list of factors.
