To solve the problem of finding the prime factors of a given integer `n`, we need to break down the number into its prime components. Here's how we can approach this problem step by step:

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Understanding Prime Factorization**:
   - Prime factorization involves expressing a number as a product of its prime numbers.
   - For example, the prime factorization of 70 is \(2 \times 5 \times 7\).

2. **Iterative Division**:
   - We can find the prime factors by iteratively dividing the number by the smallest possible prime number until the number becomes 1.
   - Start with the smallest prime number, which is 2, and divide the number as long as it is divisible by 2.
   - Move to the next possible divisor (3, 5, 7, ...) and repeat the process.

3. **Optimization**:
   - We only need to check for factors up to the square root of the number because if `n` is divisible by a number greater than its square root, the corresponding co-factor would be smaller than the square root.
   - After checking up to the square root, if `n` is still greater than 1, then `n` itself is a prime number.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - Consider edge cases such as when `n` is 1 (no prime factors) or when `n` is a prime number itself.

### Implementation:

Let's implement the function `factorize` based on the above reasoning:

```python
from typing import List

def factorize(n: int) -> List[int]:
    """ Return list of prime factors of given integer in the order from smallest to largest.
    Each of the factors should be listed number of times corresponding to how many times it appears in factorization.
    Input number should be equal to the product of all factors.
    """
    factors = []
    # Start with the smallest prime number
    divisor = 2
    
    # Check for factors up to the square root of n
    while divisor * divisor <= n:
        while n % divisor == 0:
            factors.append(divisor)
            n //= divisor
        divisor += 1
    
    # If n is still greater than 1, then it is a prime number
    if n > 1:
        factors.append(n)
    
    return factors

# Example usage:
print(factorize(8))   # Output: [2, 2, 2]
print(factorize(25))  # Output: [5, 5]
print(factorize(70))  # Output: [2, 5, 7]
```

### Explanation of the Code:

- We initialize an empty list `factors` to store the prime factors.
- We start with the smallest prime number, `divisor = 2`.
- We use a `while` loop to check divisibility up to the square root of `n`.
- Inside the loop, we use another `while` loop to divide `n` by `divisor` as long as it is divisible, appending `divisor` to the `factors` list each time.
- We increment the `divisor` to check the next possible factor.
- After the loop, if `n` is greater than 1, it means `n` itself is a prime number and should be added to the `factors` list.
- Finally, we return the list of factors.
