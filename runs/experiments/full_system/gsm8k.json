      "question": "When Jason plays the video game, Duty for Ashes, his mission to slay the dragon hoard requires that he fire his weapon on average every 15 seconds.   And each time he fires his weapon, his power-fire setting allows him to shoot a flame for 5 seconds.  On average, how many seconds per minute does Jason shoot flames at the dragon hoard?",
      "reference": "Since he fires his weapon on average every 15 seconds, then in one minute he fires the flamethrower 60/15=<<60/15=4>>4 times.\nAnd since each time he fires his weapon, he shoots flame for 5 seconds, then Jason shoots flames at the dragon hoard a total of 4*5=<<4*5=20>>20 seconds of every minute.\n#### 20",
