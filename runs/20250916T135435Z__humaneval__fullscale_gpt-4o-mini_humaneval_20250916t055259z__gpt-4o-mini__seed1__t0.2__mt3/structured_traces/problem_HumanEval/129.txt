To solve the problem of finding the minimum path of length `k` in a grid, we need to carefully consider the constraints and requirements laid out in the problem statement. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the approach we'll take:

### Step 1: Understanding the Problem
- We have a grid of size `N x N` where each cell contains a unique integer from `1` to `N*N`.
- We need to find a path of exactly `k` cells, starting from any cell and moving to adjacent cells (up, down, left, right).
- The path should be lexicographically minimal when represented as a list of cell values.

### Step 2: Path Representation
- A path of length `k` means we will visit `k` cells, which can include revisiting cells.
- The lexicographical comparison means that we need to ensure that the sequence of values we collect from the cells is the smallest possible.

### Step 3: Search Strategy
- We can use Depth-First Search (DFS) to explore all possible paths of length `k` starting from each cell in the grid.
- During the DFS, we will maintain a current path and check if it can be extended to length `k`.
- We will also keep track of the minimum path found so far.

### Step 4: Implementation Details
- We will define a recursive function that explores each cell and its neighbors.
- We will use a list to keep track of the current path and a variable to store the minimum path found.
- We will ensure that we do not go out of the grid bounds during our exploration.

### Step 5: Edge Cases
- If `k` is `1`, we simply need to return the smallest value in the grid.
- We need to ensure that our implementation efficiently handles the grid size and the number of paths explored.

### Implementation
Now, let's implement the solution based on the reasoning above:

```python
def minPath(grid, k):
    from collections import deque
    
    N = len(grid)
    min_path = None
    
    def dfs(x, y, path):
        nonlocal min_path
        if len(path) == k:
            if min_path is None or path < min_path:
                min_path = path[:]
            return
        
        # Explore neighbors
        for dx, dy in [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]:
            nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
            if 0 <= nx < N and 0 <= ny < N:  # Check bounds
                path.append(grid[nx][ny])
                dfs(nx, ny, path)
                path.pop()  # Backtrack
    
    # Start DFS from every cell in the grid
    for i in range(N):
        for j in range(N):
            dfs(i, j, [grid[i][j]])
    
    return min_path

# Example usage:
grid1 = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]
k1 = 3
print(minPath(grid1, k1))  # Output: [1, 2, 1]

grid2 = [[5, 9, 3], [4, 1, 6], [7, 8, 2]]
k2 = 1
print(minPath(grid2, k2))  # Output: [1]
```

### Explanation of the Code
- We define a `dfs` function that takes the current cell coordinates and the current path.
- We check if the path length equals `k`, and if so, we compare it with the current minimum path.
- We explore all four possible directions from the current cell and recursively call `dfs` for valid neighboring cells.
- Finally, we iterate through each cell in the grid to initiate the DFS, ensuring we explore all possible starting points.

This implementation should efficiently find the minimum path of length `k` in the grid while adhering to the problem constraints.
