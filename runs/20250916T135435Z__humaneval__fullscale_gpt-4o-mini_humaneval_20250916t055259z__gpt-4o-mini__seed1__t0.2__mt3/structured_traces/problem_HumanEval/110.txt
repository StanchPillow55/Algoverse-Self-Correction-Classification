To solve the problem of determining whether we can make all elements of `lst1` even by exchanging elements with `lst2`, we need to break down the requirements and constraints step by step.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Understanding Even and Odd Numbers**:
   - An even number is divisible by 2 (e.g., 0, 2, 4, 6, ...).
   - An odd number is not divisible by 2 (e.g., 1, 3, 5, 7, ...).

2. **Identifying the Problem**:
   - We need to check if we can replace all odd numbers in `lst1` with even numbers from `lst2`.
   - If `lst1` has an odd number, we need to find at least one even number in `lst2` to exchange with.

3. **Plan**:
   - Count the number of odd numbers in `lst1`.
   - Check if there is at least one even number in `lst2`.
   - If `lst1` has odd numbers and `lst2` has at least one even number, we can perform the necessary exchanges to make all elements of `lst1` even.
   - If `lst1` has no odd numbers, it is already valid, and we can return "YES".
   - If `lst1` has odd numbers but `lst2` has no even numbers, return "NO".

4. **Implementation**:
   - We will iterate through `lst1` to check for odd numbers.
   - We will iterate through `lst2` to check for even numbers.
   - Based on the findings, we will return "YES" or "NO".

### Implementation

Now, let's implement the function based on the above reasoning:

```python
def exchange(lst1, lst2):
    """Determines if we can exchange elements between lst1 and lst2 to make all elements of lst1 even."""
    
    # Check for odd numbers in lst1
    has_odd_in_lst1 = any(x % 2 != 0 for x in lst1)
    
    # Check for even numbers in lst2
    has_even_in_lst2 = any(x % 2 == 0 for x in lst2)
    
    # If lst1 has odd numbers and lst2 has even numbers, we can perform the exchange
    if has_odd_in_lst1 and has_even_in_lst2:
        return "YES"
    
    # If lst1 has no odd numbers, it's already valid
    if not has_odd_in_lst1:
        return "YES"
    
    # If lst1 has odd numbers but lst2 has no even numbers, we cannot perform the exchange
    return "NO"

# Example test cases
print(exchange([1, 2, 3, 4], [1, 2, 3, 4]))  # Expected: "YES"
print(exchange([1, 2, 3, 4], [1, 5, 3, 4]))  # Expected: "NO"
```

### Explanation of the Code:
- We use the `any()` function to check for the presence of odd numbers in `lst1` and even numbers in `lst2`.
- The first condition checks if there are any odd numbers in `lst1` and if there are any even numbers in `lst2`.
- The second condition checks if `lst1` is already valid (i.e., contains no odd numbers).
- Finally, we return "NO" if there are odd numbers in `lst1` but no even numbers in `lst2`.

This solution is efficient and straightforward, ensuring that we only traverse each list once, resulting in a time complexity of O(n + m), where n and m are the lengths of `lst1` and `lst2`, respectively.

To solve the problem, we need to determine if we can exchange elements between two lists, `lst1` and `lst2`, such that all elements in `lst1` become even numbers. 

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Understanding Even and Odd Numbers**:
   - An even number is any integer that is divisible by 2 (e.g., -4, -2, 0, 2, 4).
   - An odd number is any integer that is not divisible by 2 (e.g., -3, -1, 1, 3).

2. **Identifying Requirements**:
   - We need to check if `lst1` can be transformed into a list of only even numbers through exchanges with `lst2`.
   - For each odd number in `lst1`, we need to find at least one even number in `lst2` to exchange with.

3. **Plan**:
   - Count the number of odd numbers in `lst1`.
   - Count the number of even numbers in `lst2`.
   - If the number of odd numbers in `lst1` is less than or equal to the number of even numbers in `lst2`, then it is possible to make all numbers in `lst1` even through exchanges. Otherwise, it is not possible.

4. **Implementation**:
   - We will iterate through `lst1` to count the odd numbers.
   - We will iterate through `lst2` to count the even numbers.
   - Finally, we will compare the counts and return "YES" or "NO" based on the condition explained above.

### Implementation:

Now, let's implement the solution in Python:

```python
def exchange(lst1, lst2):
    """Determine if it's possible to make all elements of lst1 even by exchanging elements with lst2."""
    
    # Count odd numbers in lst1
    odd_count_lst1 = sum(1 for num in lst1 if num % 2 != 0)
    
    # Count even numbers in lst2
    even_count_lst2 = sum(1 for num in lst2 if num % 2 == 0)
    
    # If the number of odd numbers in lst1 is less than or equal to the number of even numbers in lst2,
    # we can make lst1 all even by exchanging.
    if odd_count_lst1 <= even_count_lst2:
        return "YES"
    else:
        return "NO"

# Example test cases
print(exchange([1, 2, 3, 4], [1, 2, 3, 4]))  # Expected output: "YES"
print(exchange([1, 2, 3, 4], [1, 5, 3, 4]))  # Expected output: "NO"
```

### Explanation of the Code:
- We use a generator expression within the `sum()` function to count the odd numbers in `lst1` and the even numbers in `lst2`.
- The condition checks if the count of odd numbers in `lst1` is less than or equal to the count of even numbers in `lst2`. If true, we return "YES"; otherwise, we return "NO".

This implementation is efficient and straightforward, ensuring that we correctly determine the possibility of making `lst1` consist solely of even numbers through exchanges with `lst2`.
