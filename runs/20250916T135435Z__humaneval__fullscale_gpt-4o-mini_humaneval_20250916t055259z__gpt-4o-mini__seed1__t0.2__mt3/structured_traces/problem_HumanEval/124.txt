To solve the problem of validating a date string according to the specified rules, we need to break down the requirements and implement a function that checks each condition step by step. Hereâ€™s how we can approach this:

### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Check for Empty String**: The first condition states that the date string should not be empty. If it is empty, we can immediately return `False`.

2. **Check Format**: The date must be in the format `mm-dd-yyyy`. We can use string manipulation to check if the string contains exactly two hyphens and that the parts before and after the hyphens are numeric.

3. **Extract Month, Day, Year**: If the format is correct, we can split the string using the hyphen (`-`) as a delimiter to extract the month, day, and year.

4. **Convert to Integers**: Convert the extracted month, day, and year strings into integers for further validation.

5. **Validate Month**: Check if the month is between 1 and 12 (inclusive).

6. **Validate Day Based on Month**:
   - For months with 31 days (January, March, May, July, August, October, December), ensure the day is between 1 and 31.
   - For months with 30 days (April, June, September, November), ensure the day is between 1 and 30.
   - For February, we need to check if the year is a leap year to determine if it can have 28 or 29 days. A leap year is defined as:
     - Divisible by 4
     - Not divisible by 100 unless also divisible by 400

7. **Return Result**: If all checks pass, return `True`; otherwise, return `False`.

### Implementation

Now, let's implement the function based on the reasoning above:

```python
def valid_date(date):
    """Validates a given date string in the format mm-dd-yyyy."""
    
    # Step 1: Check if the date string is empty
    if not date:
        return False
    
    # Step 2: Check the format
    parts = date.split('-')
    if len(parts) != 3:
        return False
    
    month_str, day_str, year_str = parts
    
    # Step 3: Check if all parts are numeric
    if not (month_str.isdigit() and day_str.isdigit() and year_str.isdigit()):
        return False
    
    # Step 4: Convert to integers
    month = int(month_str)
    day = int(day_str)
    year = int(year_str)
    
    # Step 5: Validate month
    if month < 1 or month > 12:
        return False
    
    # Step 6: Validate day based on month
    if month in {1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, 12}:  # Months with 31 days
        if day < 1 or day > 31:
            return False
    elif month in {4, 6, 9, 11}:  # Months with 30 days
        if day < 1 or day > 30:
            return False
    elif month == 2:  # February
        if (year % 4 == 0 and year % 100 != 0) or (year % 400 == 0):  # Leap year
            if day < 1 or day > 29:
                return False
        else:  # Not a leap year
            if day < 1 or day > 28:
                return False
    
    # If all checks passed, the date is valid
    return True
```

### Explanation of the Code

- The function starts by checking if the input string is empty.
- It splits the string into three parts and checks if they are numeric.
- It converts the parts into integers for month, day, and year.
- It validates the month and day according to the rules provided.
- Finally, it returns `True` if all conditions are satisfied, otherwise `False`.

This implementation should correctly validate the date strings according to the specified rules.
