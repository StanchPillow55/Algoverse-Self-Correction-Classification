To solve the problem of decoding a string that has been encoded using the `encode_shift` function, we need to reverse the encoding process. The `encode_shift` function shifts each character in the input string by 5 positions in the alphabet. Therefore, to decode the string, we need to shift each character back by 5 positions.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Understand the Encoding Process**: 
   - The `encode_shift` function takes a string and shifts each character by 5 positions. For example, 'a' becomes 'f', 'b' becomes 'g', and so on. When the end of the alphabet is reached, it wraps around (e.g., 'z' becomes 'e').

2. **Decoding Logic**:
   - To decode, we need to shift each character back by 5 positions. This means that:
     - 'f' should become 'a'
     - 'g' should become 'b'
     - ...
     - 'e' should become 'z' (when wrapping around)
   - The mathematical operation for decoding can be derived similarly to encoding:
     - For a character `ch`, the decoding can be expressed as:
       \[
       \text{decoded\_char} = \text{chr}(((\text{ord}(ch) - 5 - \text{ord}('a')) \% 26) + \text{ord}('a'))
       \]
     - Here, we subtract 5 instead of adding, and we still use modulo 26 to handle the wrap-around.

3. **Implementation**:
   - We will iterate through each character in the input string, apply the decoding logic, and join the results to form the final decoded string.

### Implementation:

Now, let's implement the `decode_shift` function based on the reasoning above.

```python
def decode_shift(s: str) -> str:
    """
    Takes as input a string encoded with the encode_shift function.
    Returns the decoded string by shifting every character back by 5 in the alphabet.
    """
    return "".join([chr(((ord(ch) - 5 - ord("a")) % 26) + ord("a")) for ch in s])

# Example usage:
encoded_string = encode_shift("hello")  # This should return "mjqqt"
decoded_string = decode_shift(encoded_string)  # This should return "hello"
print(decoded_string)  # Output: hello
```

### Explanation of the Code:
- The function `decode_shift` takes a string `s` as input.
- It uses a list comprehension to iterate over each character `ch` in the string `s`.
- For each character, it calculates the decoded character using the formula discussed.
- Finally, it joins all the decoded characters into a single string and returns it.

### Testing:
To ensure that the function works correctly, we can test it with various encoded strings and verify that it returns the original strings. The example provided in the comments demonstrates this process.

To solve the problem of implementing the `decode_shift` function, we need to reverse the encoding process defined in the `encode_shift` function. The `encode_shift` function shifts each character in the input string by 5 positions in the alphabet. Therefore, to decode the string, we need to shift each character back by 5 positions.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Encoding**: 
   - The `encode_shift` function takes a string `s` and shifts each character by 5 positions. For example, 'a' becomes 'f', 'b' becomes 'g', ..., 'z' wraps around to 'e'.
   - The encoding is done using the formula: 
     ```python
     chr(((ord(ch) + 5 - ord("a")) % 26) + ord("a"))
     ```
   - Here, `ord(ch)` gives the ASCII value of the character `ch`, and we adjust it to wrap around using modulo 26.

2. **Decoding Logic**:
   - To decode, we need to reverse the shift. This means we will shift each character back by 5 positions.
   - The formula for decoding a character would be:
     ```python
     chr(((ord(ch) - 5 - ord("a")) % 26) + ord("a"))
     ```
   - This formula works similarly to the encoding formula but subtracts 5 instead of adding it.

3. **Handling Edge Cases**:
   - We need to ensure that when we subtract 5, we correctly wrap around the alphabet. For example, if we decode 'a', we should get 'v' (since 'a' - 5 wraps around to 'v').

4. **Implementation**:
   - We will iterate through each character in the input string, apply the decoding formula, and join the results to form the decoded string.

### Implementation of `decode_shift`:

Now, let's implement the `decode_shift` function based on the reasoning above.

```python
def decode_shift(s: str) -> str:
    """
    Takes as input a string encoded with the encode_shift function.
    Returns the decoded string by shifting every character back by 5 in the alphabet.
    """
    return "".join([chr(((ord(ch) - 5 - ord("a")) % 26) + ord("a")) for ch in s])

# Example usage:
encoded_string = encode_shift("hello")  # This will encode "hello" to "mjqqt"
decoded_string = decode_shift(encoded_string)  # This should decode back to "hello"
print(decoded_string)  # Output: hello
```

### Explanation of the Code:
- We define the `decode_shift` function which takes a string `s`.
- We use a list comprehension to iterate over each character `ch` in the string `s`.
- For each character, we calculate its decoded value using the formula discussed.
- Finally, we join the list of decoded characters into a single string and return it.

This implementation effectively reverses the encoding done by `encode_shift`, allowing us to retrieve the original string from its encoded form.

To solve the problem of decoding a string that has been encoded using the `encode_shift` function, we need to understand how the encoding process works. The `encode_shift` function shifts each character in the input string by 5 positions in the alphabet. 

### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Understanding the Encoding Process**:
   - The function `encode_shift` takes a string `s` and for each character `ch` in `s`, it calculates a new character by:
     - Converting `ch` to its ASCII value using `ord(ch)`.
     - Adding 5 to this value.
     - Adjusting for wrapping around the alphabet using modulo 26.
     - Converting back to a character using `chr()`.
   - This means that 'a' becomes 'f', 'b' becomes 'g', ..., 'z' wraps around to become 'e'.

2. **Decoding Process**:
   - To decode the string, we need to reverse the encoding process. This means we should shift each character back by 5 positions.
   - The decoding can be done similarly to encoding, but instead of adding 5, we will subtract 5.
   - We also need to ensure that if the result goes below 'a', it wraps around to 'z'.

3. **Implementation Details**:
   - We will iterate through each character in the encoded string.
   - For each character, we will:
     - Convert it to its ASCII value.
     - Subtract 5.
     - Use modulo 26 to handle wrapping around.
     - Convert back to a character.
   - Finally, we will join all the characters to form the decoded string.

### Implementation

Now, let's implement the `decode_shift` function based on the reasoning above.

```python
def decode_shift(s: str) -> str:
    """
    Takes as input a string encoded with the encode_shift function.
    Returns the decoded string by shifting every character back by 5 in the alphabet.
    """
    decoded_chars = []
    
    for ch in s:
        # Shift back by 5
        new_char = chr(((ord(ch) - 5 - ord('a')) % 26) + ord('a'))
        decoded_chars.append(new_char)
    
    return "".join(decoded_chars)

# Example usage:
encoded_string = encode_shift("hello")  # This would encode "hello" to "mjqqt"
decoded_string = decode_shift(encoded_string)  # This should decode back to "hello"
print(decoded_string)  # Output should be "hello"
```

### Explanation of the Code:
- We define the `decode_shift` function that takes a string `s`.
- We initialize an empty list `decoded_chars` to store the decoded characters.
- We loop through each character `ch` in the input string `s`.
- For each character, we calculate the new character by:
  - Subtracting 5 from its ASCII value.
  - Adjusting for wrapping using modulo 26.
  - Converting back to a character.
- We append each decoded character to `decoded_chars`.
- Finally, we join the list of characters into a single string and return it.

This implementation effectively reverses the encoding process, allowing us to retrieve the original string from the encoded version.
