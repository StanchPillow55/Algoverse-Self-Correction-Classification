To solve the problem of determining whether a bank account balance falls below zero at any point during a series of deposit and withdrawal operations, we can follow a straightforward approach:

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: 
   - We start with a balance of zero.
   - We have a list of integers where positive integers represent deposits (increasing the balance) and negative integers represent withdrawals (decreasing the balance).
   - Our goal is to check if the balance ever becomes negative after processing each operation in the list.

2. **Initial Setup**:
   - We will initialize a variable to keep track of the current balance, starting at zero.

3. **Iterate Through Operations**:
   - We will loop through each operation in the list.
   - For each operation, we will update the current balance by adding the operation value to it.

4. **Check for Negative Balance**:
   - After updating the balance with each operation, we will check if the balance is less than zero.
   - If it is, we will return `True` immediately, indicating that the balance has fallen below zero.

5. **Final Check**:
   - If we finish processing all operations without the balance going below zero, we will return `False`.

### Implementation:

Now, let's implement the above logic in the `below_zero` function.

```python
from typing import List

def below_zero(operations: List[int]) -> bool:
    """ 
    Detect if the balance of a bank account falls below zero at any point 
    during a series of deposit and withdrawal operations.
    
    Args:
    operations (List[int]): A list of integers representing deposits and withdrawals.
    
    Returns:
    bool: True if the balance falls below zero at any point, otherwise False.
    
    Examples:
    >>> below_zero([1, 2, 3])
    False
    >>> below_zero([1, 2, -4, 5])
    True
    """
    balance = 0  # Start with a balance of zero
    
    for operation in operations:
        balance += operation  # Update the balance with the current operation
        if balance < 0:  # Check if the balance has fallen below zero
            return True  # Return True immediately if it has
    
    return False  # Return False if the balance never fell below zero
```

### Explanation of the Implementation:
- We define the function `below_zero` that takes a list of integers as input.
- We initialize `balance` to zero.
- We loop through each integer in the `operations` list, updating the `balance` accordingly.
- After each update, we check if the `balance` is less than zero. If it is, we return `True`.
- If we complete the loop without the balance going below zero, we return `False`.

### Testing the Function:
We can test the function using the provided examples to ensure it behaves as expected. The function should return `False` for `[1, 2, 3]` and `True` for `[1, 2, -4, 5]`. 

This implementation is efficient and straightforward, with a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of operations in the list.
