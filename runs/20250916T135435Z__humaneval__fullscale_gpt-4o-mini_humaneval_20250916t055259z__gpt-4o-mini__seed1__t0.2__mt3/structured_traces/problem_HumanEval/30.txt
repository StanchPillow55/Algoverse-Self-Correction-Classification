To solve the problem of filtering out only the positive numbers from a given list, we can break down the task into a series of logical steps:

1. **Understanding the Input and Output**: 
   - The function `get_positive` takes a list of numbers (which can include positive numbers, negative numbers, and zero).
   - The output should be a new list that contains only the positive numbers from the input list.

2. **Defining Positive Numbers**: 
   - A positive number is defined as any number greater than zero. Therefore, we need to check each number in the list to see if it meets this criterion.

3. **Iterating Through the List**: 
   - We will need to iterate through each element in the input list. For each element, we will check if it is greater than zero.

4. **Collecting Positive Numbers**: 
   - We can use a new list to collect all the positive numbers we find during our iteration.

5. **Returning the Result**: 
   - Finally, we will return the list of positive numbers.

6. **Testing the Function**: 
   - We will ensure that the function works correctly by using the provided examples in the docstring as test cases.

Now, let's implement the function based on this reasoning:

```python
def get_positive(l: list):
    """Return only positive numbers in the list.
    >>> get_positive([-1, 2, -4, 5, 6])
    [2, 5, 6]
    >>> get_positive([5, 3, -5, 2, -3, 3, 9, 0, 123, 1, -10])
    [5, 3, 2, 3, 9, 123, 1]
    """
    # Initialize an empty list to hold positive numbers
    positive_numbers = []
    
    # Iterate through each number in the input list
    for number in l:
        # Check if the number is positive
        if number > 0:
            # If it is positive, add it to the positive_numbers list
            positive_numbers.append(number)
    
    # Return the list of positive numbers
    return positive_numbers
```

### Explanation of the Code:
- We define the function `get_positive` that takes a single argument `l`, which is expected to be a list.
- We initialize an empty list called `positive_numbers` to store the positive numbers we find.
- We use a `for` loop to iterate over each `number` in the input list `l`.
- Inside the loop, we check if `number` is greater than zero. If it is, we append it to the `positive_numbers` list.
- After the loop completes, we return the `positive_numbers` list, which contains only the positive numbers from the input list.

### Testing the Function:
The function includes docstring examples that can be tested using a Python interactive environment or a testing framework to ensure correctness. The expected outputs are provided, and we can verify that the function behaves as intended.
