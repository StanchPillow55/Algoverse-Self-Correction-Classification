To solve the problem of calculating the sum and product of a list of integers, we need to follow a systematic approach. Let's break down the requirements and the steps needed to implement the solution.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Understanding the Input and Output**:
   - The input is a list of integers, which can be empty.
   - The output is a tuple containing two values: the sum of the integers and the product of the integers.

2. **Handling Edge Cases**:
   - If the list is empty, the sum should be `0` and the product should be `1`. This is a common convention in mathematics where the sum of no numbers is zero, and the product of no numbers is one.

3. **Calculating the Sum**:
   - We can use Python's built-in `sum()` function to calculate the sum of the list. This function handles the case of an empty list by returning `0`.

4. **Calculating the Product**:
   - For the product, we need to initialize a variable to `1` (since multiplying by one does not change the product) and iterate through the list, multiplying each number to this variable.
   - If the list is empty, we should directly return `1` as the product.

5. **Implementation**:
   - We will define the function `sum_product` that takes a list of integers as input.
   - We will calculate the sum and product as described and return them as a tuple.

### Implementation

Now, let's implement the function based on the reasoning above.

```python
from typing import List, Tuple

def sum_product(numbers: List[int]) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    """ For a given list of integers, return a tuple consisting of a sum and a product of all the integers in a list.
    Empty sum should be equal to 0 and empty product should be equal to 1.
    >>> sum_product([])
    (0, 1)
    >>> sum_product([1, 2, 3, 4])
    (10, 24)
    """
    # Calculate the sum
    total_sum = sum(numbers)
    
    # Calculate the product
    total_product = 1
    for number in numbers:
        total_product *= number
    
    return (total_sum, total_product)

# Example usage
print(sum_product([]))          # Output: (0, 1)
print(sum_product([1, 2, 3, 4]))  # Output: (10, 24)
```

### Explanation of the Code:
- We import the necessary types from the `typing` module.
- The function `sum_product` is defined to take a list of integers.
- We calculate the sum using the built-in `sum()` function.
- We initialize `total_product` to `1` and iterate through each number in the list, multiplying it to `total_product`.
- Finally, we return a tuple containing the sum and product.

This implementation is efficient and straightforward, handling both the empty list case and the general case effectively.
