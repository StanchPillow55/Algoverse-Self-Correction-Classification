To solve the problem, we need to create a function `fizz_buzz(n: int)` that counts how many times the digit '7' appears in all integers less than `n` that are divisible by either 11 or 13.

### Step-by-step Approach:

1. **Understand the Requirements**:
   - We need to check all integers from 0 up to (but not including) `n`.
   - For each integer, we need to determine if it is divisible by 11 or 13.
   - If it is divisible, we will convert the integer to a string and count how many times the digit '7' appears in that string.

2. **Loop through the Range**:
   - We will use a loop to iterate through all integers from 0 to `n-1`.

3. **Check Divisibility**:
   - For each integer, we will check if it is divisible by 11 or 13 using the modulus operator (`%`).

4. **Count the '7's**:
   - If the integer is divisible, we will convert it to a string and use the string method `.count('7')` to count occurrences of '7'.

5. **Accumulate the Count**:
   - We will maintain a running total of the counts of '7's for all qualifying integers.

6. **Return the Result**:
   - Finally, we will return the total count.

### Implementation:

Now, let's implement the function based on the above reasoning.

```python
def fizz_buzz(n: int) -> int:
    """Return the number of times the digit 7 appears in integers less than n which are divisible by 11 or 13.
    
    >>> fizz_buzz(50)
    0
    >>> fizz_buzz(78)
    2
    >>> fizz_buzz(79)
    3
    """
    count_of_sevens = 0
    
    for i in range(n):
        if i % 11 == 0 or i % 13 == 0:
            count_of_sevens += str(i).count('7')
    
    return count_of_sevens
```

### Explanation of the Code:
- We define the function `fizz_buzz` that takes an integer `n`.
- We initialize a variable `count_of_sevens` to zero to keep track of the total count of '7's.
- We loop through all integers from 0 to `n-1`.
- For each integer `i`, we check if it is divisible by 11 or 13.
- If it is, we convert `i` to a string and count how many times '7' appears in that string, adding that count to `count_of_sevens`.
- Finally, we return the total count.

### Testing the Function:
We can test the function using the provided examples to ensure it works correctly. The expected outputs are:
- `fizz_buzz(50)` should return `0`
- `fizz_buzz(78)` should return `2`
- `fizz_buzz(79)` should return `3`

This implementation is efficient and straightforward, adhering to the problem requirements.
