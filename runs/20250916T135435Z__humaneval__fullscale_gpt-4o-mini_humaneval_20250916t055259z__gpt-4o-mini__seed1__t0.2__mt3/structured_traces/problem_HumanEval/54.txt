To solve the problem of checking if two words have the same characters, we need to consider the following points:

1. **Character Count**: The two strings should have the same characters with the same frequency. For example, the strings "aabb" and "bbaa" have the same characters ('a' and 'b') with the same counts (2 of each).

2. **Character Set**: We need to ensure that both strings contain the same unique characters. For instance, "abcd" and "abc" do not have the same characters since the first string has 'd' while the second does not.

3. **Efficiency**: We want to implement a solution that is efficient in terms of time complexity. A good approach is to use a dictionary or a `Counter` from the `collections` module to count the occurrences of each character in both strings.

4. **Edge Cases**: We should also consider edge cases, such as when one or both strings are empty. If both strings are empty, they should be considered to have the same characters.

### Approach

1. **Count Characters**: Use `collections.Counter` to count the frequency of each character in both strings.
2. **Compare Counts**: Compare the two `Counter` objects. If they are equal, it means both strings have the same characters with the same frequencies.
3. **Return Result**: Return `True` if they are equal, otherwise return `False`.

### Implementation

Now, let's implement the function based on the reasoning above.

```python
from collections import Counter

def same_chars(s0: str, s1: str) -> bool:
    """
    Check if two words have the same characters.
    
    >>> same_chars('eabcdzzzz', 'dddzzzzzzzddeddabc')
    True
    >>> same_chars('abcd', 'dddddddabc')
    True
    >>> same_chars('dddddddabc', 'abcd')
    True
    >>> same_chars('eabcd', 'dddddddabc')
    False
    >>> same_chars('abcd', 'dddddddabce')
    False
    >>> same_chars('eabcdzzzz', 'dddzzzzzzzddddabc')
    False
    """
    # Count the characters in both strings
    count_s0 = Counter(s0)
    count_s1 = Counter(s1)
    
    # Compare the two counts
    return count_s0 == count_s1
```

### Explanation of the Code

- We import `Counter` from the `collections` module, which allows us to easily count the occurrences of each character in the strings.
- The function `same_chars` takes two strings as input.
- We create two `Counter` objects, `count_s0` and `count_s1`, which hold the frequency of characters for `s0` and `s1`, respectively.
- Finally, we compare the two `Counter` objects. If they are equal, it means both strings have the same characters with the same frequencies, and we return `True`. If not, we return `False`.

This implementation is efficient and straightforward, leveraging Python's built-in capabilities to handle counting and comparison.

To solve the problem of checking if two words have the same characters, we need to consider the following:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: We need to determine if two strings contain the same unique characters, regardless of their frequency. For example, the strings "abcd" and "dddddddabc" both contain the characters 'a', 'b', 'c', and 'd', so they should return `True`. Conversely, "eabcd" and "dddddddabc" should return `False` because 'e' is not present in the second string.

2. **Approach**:
   - We can use Python's `set` data structure, which automatically handles unique elements. By converting both strings into sets, we can easily compare the unique characters in both strings.
   - If the sets of characters from both strings are equal, then the two strings have the same characters.

3. **Implementation Steps**:
   - Convert both input strings `s0` and `s1` into sets.
   - Compare the two sets.
   - Return `True` if they are equal, otherwise return `False`.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - If either string is empty, we should consider that two empty strings have the same characters (both have none), so they should return `True`.
   - If one string is empty and the other is not, they should return `False`.

Now, let's implement the function based on this reasoning:

```python
def same_chars(s0: str, s1: str) -> bool:
    """
    Check if two words have the same characters.
    
    >>> same_chars('eabcdzzzz', 'dddzzzzzzzddeddabc')
    True
    >>> same_chars('abcd', 'dddddddabc')
    True
    >>> same_chars('dddddddabc', 'abcd')
    True
    >>> same_chars('eabcd', 'dddddddabc')
    False
    >>> same_chars('abcd', 'dddddddabce')
    False
    >>> same_chars('eabcdzzzz', 'dddzzzzzzzddddabc')
    False
    """
    # Convert both strings to sets to get unique characters
    set_s0 = set(s0)
    set_s1 = set(s1)
    
    # Compare the two sets
    return set_s0 == set_s1
```

### Explanation of the Code:
- The function `same_chars` takes two strings as input.
- It converts each string into a set, which removes duplicate characters and retains only unique ones.
- It then compares the two sets using the equality operator (`==`).
- The function returns `True` if both sets are equal (indicating both strings have the same unique characters) and `False` otherwise.

### Testing:
The provided examples in the docstring serve as tests to validate the function's correctness. You can run these tests in a Python environment to ensure the function behaves as expected.
