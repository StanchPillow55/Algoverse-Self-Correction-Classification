To solve the problem of splitting a string into words based on commas and spaces, we need to follow a systematic approach. Hereâ€™s how I would think through the problem step by step:

### Step 1: Understand the Input and Output
- **Input**: A string `s` that contains words separated by either commas (`,`) or spaces.
- **Output**: An array (or list in Python) of words.

### Step 2: Identify the Delimiters
The string can be split by two types of delimiters:
1. Commas (`,`)
2. Spaces (` `)

### Step 3: Plan the Approach
1. **Normalization**: First, we need to ensure that we can handle both delimiters effectively. A good approach is to replace all commas with spaces. This way, we can treat the string as a space-separated list of words.
2. **Splitting**: After normalizing the string, we can use the `split()` method, which by default splits a string by whitespace. This method will also handle multiple spaces correctly by ignoring them.
3. **Return the Result**: Finally, we will return the list of words.

### Step 4: Implementation
Now, let's implement the function based on the above reasoning.

```python
def words_string(s):
    """
    Splits the input string into words separated by commas or spaces and returns a list of words.
    
    Args:
    s (str): The input string containing words separated by commas or spaces.
    
    Returns:
    list: A list of words extracted from the input string.
    """
    # Replace commas with spaces to normalize the delimiters
    normalized_string = s.replace(',', ' ')
    
    # Split the normalized string by whitespace and return the list of words
    return normalized_string.split()

# Example usage:
print(words_string("Hi, my name is John"))  # Output: ["Hi", "my", "name", "is", "John"]
print(words_string("One, two, three, four, five, six"))  # Output: ["One", "two", "three", "four", "five", "six"]
```

### Explanation of the Code:
1. **Normalization**: The line `normalized_string = s.replace(',', ' ')` replaces all commas in the input string with spaces.
2. **Splitting**: The `split()` method is called on the normalized string, which splits it into words based on whitespace. This method automatically handles multiple spaces and returns only the non-empty words.
3. **Return**: The resulting list of words is returned.

### Testing
We can test the function with various inputs to ensure it behaves as expected, including cases with:
- Only spaces
- Only commas
- Mixed spaces and commas
- Leading and trailing spaces

This implementation should cover all the requirements of the problem effectively.
