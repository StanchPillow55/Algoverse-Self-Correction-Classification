To solve the problem of finding the median of a list of numbers, we need to follow a systematic approach. Let's break down the steps involved:

### Step 1: Understanding the Median
The median is the middle value of a sorted list of numbers. If the list has an odd number of elements, the median is the middle element. If the list has an even number of elements, the median is the average of the two middle elements.

### Step 2: Steps to Calculate the Median
1. **Sort the List**: The first step is to sort the list of numbers. This is crucial because the median is defined based on the order of the numbers.
2. **Determine the Length**: We need to find out whether the length of the list is odd or even.
3. **Calculate the Median**:
   - If the length is odd, the median is the element at the index `length // 2`.
   - If the length is even, the median is the average of the elements at indices `length // 2 - 1` and `length // 2`.

### Step 3: Edge Cases
- An empty list should ideally return an error or a specific value since the median is undefined for an empty set.
- We should also consider lists with negative numbers and floating-point numbers, but the median calculation remains the same.

### Step 4: Implementation
Now that we have a clear understanding of how to calculate the median, we can implement the function. Hereâ€™s the complete function definition:

```python
def median(l: list):
    """Return median of elements in the list l.
    
    >>> median([3, 1, 2, 4, 5])
    3
    >>> median([-10, 4, 6, 1000, 10, 20])
    15.0
    """
    if not l:  # Check for empty list
        raise ValueError("Cannot compute median of an empty list.")
    
    # Step 1: Sort the list
    sorted_list = sorted(l)
    
    # Step 2: Determine the length of the list
    n = len(sorted_list)
    
    # Step 3: Calculate the median
    if n % 2 == 1:  # Odd length
        return sorted_list[n // 2]
    else:  # Even length
        mid1 = sorted_list[n // 2 - 1]
        mid2 = sorted_list[n // 2]
        return (mid1 + mid2) / 2.0  # Return average of the two middle values
```

### Explanation of the Code:
1. **Input Check**: We first check if the list is empty and raise a `ValueError` if it is.
2. **Sorting**: We use Python's built-in `sorted()` function to sort the list.
3. **Length Calculation**: We calculate the length of the sorted list.
4. **Median Calculation**: Depending on whether the length is odd or even, we either return the middle element or the average of the two middle elements.
