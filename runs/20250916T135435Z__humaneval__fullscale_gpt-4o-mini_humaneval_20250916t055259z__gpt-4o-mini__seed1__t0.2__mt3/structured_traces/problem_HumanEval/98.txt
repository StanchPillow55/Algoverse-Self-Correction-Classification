To solve the problem of counting uppercase vowels at even indices in a given string, we can break down the task into a series of logical steps:

1. **Understanding the Input and Output**:
   - The input is a string `s`.
   - The output should be an integer representing the count of uppercase vowels ('A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U') that are located at even indices (0, 2, 4, etc.) in the string.

2. **Identifying Uppercase Vowels**:
   - The uppercase vowels we need to check for are: 'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U'.

3. **Iterating Over the String**:
   - We need to loop through the string while checking the index of each character.
   - We will only consider characters at even indices.

4. **Counting the Uppercase Vowels**:
   - For each character at an even index, we will check if it is an uppercase vowel.
   - If it is, we will increment our count.

5. **Returning the Result**:
   - Finally, we will return the count of uppercase vowels found at even indices.

Now, let's implement this logic in the `count_upper` function.

```python
def count_upper(s):
    """
    Given a string s, count the number of uppercase vowels in even indices.
    
    For example:
    count_upper('aBCdEf') returns 1
    count_upper('abcdefg') returns 0
    count_upper('dBBE') returns 0
    """
    # Define the set of uppercase vowels
    uppercase_vowels = {'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U'}
    
    # Initialize a counter for uppercase vowels at even indices
    count = 0
    
    # Iterate over the string using index
    for index in range(len(s)):
        # Check if the index is even
        if index % 2 == 0:
            # Check if the character at this index is an uppercase vowel
            if s[index] in uppercase_vowels:
                count += 1
                
    return count
```

### Explanation of the Code:
- We define a set `uppercase_vowels` containing the uppercase vowels for quick membership testing.
- We initialize a counter `count` to zero.
- We loop through the indices of the string using `range(len(s))`.
- For each index, we check if it is even using `index % 2 == 0`.
- If the index is even, we check if the character at that index is in our set of uppercase vowels.
- If it is, we increment our count.
- Finally, we return the count.

### Testing the Function:
We can test the function with the provided examples to ensure it behaves as expected.

```python
print(count_upper('aBCdEf'))  # Expected output: 1
print(count_upper('abcdefg'))  # Expected output: 0
print(count_upper('dBBE'))     # Expected output: 0
```

This implementation is efficient and straightforward, adhering to the problem requirements.
