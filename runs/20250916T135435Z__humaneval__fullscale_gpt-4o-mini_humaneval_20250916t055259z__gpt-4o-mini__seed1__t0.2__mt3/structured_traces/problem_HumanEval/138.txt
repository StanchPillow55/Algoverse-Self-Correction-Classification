To solve the problem of determining whether a given number \( n \) can be expressed as the sum of exactly four positive even numbers, we need to consider a few mathematical properties of even numbers and their sums.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Understanding Even Numbers**: 
   - Even numbers are integers that are divisible by 2. The smallest positive even number is 2.

2. **Sum of Four Positive Even Numbers**:
   - The smallest sum we can achieve using four positive even numbers is \( 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 8 \). This means that any number less than 8 cannot be expressed as the sum of four positive even numbers.

3. **General Formulation**:
   - If we denote the four positive even numbers as \( 2a, 2b, 2c, 2d \) (where \( a, b, c, d \) are positive integers), then their sum can be expressed as:
     \[
     2a + 2b + 2c + 2d = 2(a + b + c + d)
     \]
   - This shows that the sum of four positive even numbers is always even.

4. **Conditions for \( n \)**:
   - For \( n \) to be expressible as the sum of four positive even numbers, it must be:
     - Even (since the sum of even numbers is even).
     - At least 8 (since the minimum sum of four positive even numbers is 8).

5. **Conclusion**:
   - Therefore, the function should return `False` if \( n \) is less than 8 or if \( n \) is odd. It should return `True` if \( n \) is even and at least 8.

### Implementation

Now that we have established the conditions, we can implement the function `is_equal_to_sum_even`.

```python
def is_equal_to_sum_even(n):
    """Evaluate whether the given number n can be written as the sum of exactly 4 positive even numbers."""
    # Check if n is less than 8 or if n is odd
    if n < 8 or n % 2 != 0:
        return False
    return True
```

### Explanation of the Code:
- The function takes an integer \( n \) as input.
- It first checks if \( n \) is less than 8 or if \( n \) is odd using the conditions `n < 8` and `n % 2 != 0`.
- If either condition is true, it returns `False`.
- If both conditions are false (meaning \( n \) is even and at least 8), it returns `True`.

### Testing the Function
We can test the function with the provided examples:

```python
print(is_equal_to_sum_even(4))  # Expected: False
print(is_equal_to_sum_even(6))  # Expected: False
print(is_equal_to_sum_even(8))  # Expected: True
print(is_equal_to_sum_even(10)) # Expected: True
print(is_equal_to_sum_even(12)) # Expected: True
print(is_equal_to_sum_even(7))  # Expected: False
print(is_equal_to_sum_even(9))  # Expected: False
```

This implementation is efficient and directly checks the necessary conditions to determine if \( n \) can be expressed as the sum of four positive even numbers.
