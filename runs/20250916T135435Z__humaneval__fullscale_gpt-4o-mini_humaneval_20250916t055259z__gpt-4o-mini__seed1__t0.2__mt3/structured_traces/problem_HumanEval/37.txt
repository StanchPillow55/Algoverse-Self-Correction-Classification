To solve the problem of sorting the even-indexed elements of a list while keeping the odd-indexed elements unchanged, we can break down the task into a series of clear steps:

### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Understanding the Input and Output**:
   - The function takes a list `l` as input.
   - The output should be a new list where:
     - Elements at odd indices remain the same as in the original list.
     - Elements at even indices are sorted in ascending order.

2. **Identifying Even and Odd Indices**:
   - In Python, list indices start at 0. Therefore:
     - Even indices are 0, 2, 4, etc.
     - Odd indices are 1, 3, 5, etc.

3. **Extracting Even Indexed Elements**:
   - We need to create a new list that contains only the elements at the even indices from the original list.

4. **Sorting the Even Indexed Elements**:
   - Once we have the even indexed elements, we can sort them using Python's built-in sorting functions.

5. **Reconstructing the List**:
   - We will create a new list and populate it:
     - For even indices, we will place the sorted elements.
     - For odd indices, we will retain the original elements.

6. **Returning the Result**:
   - Finally, we will return the newly constructed list.

### Implementation

Now, let's implement the above reasoning in the function `sort_even`.

```python
def sort_even(l: list):
    """This function takes a list l and returns a list l' such that
    l' is identical to l in the odd indices, while its values at the even indices are equal
    to the values of the even indices of l, but sorted.
    
    >>> sort_even([1, 2, 3])
    [1, 2, 3]
    >>> sort_even([5, 6, 3, 4])
    [3, 6, 5, 4]
    """
    
    # Step 1: Extract even indexed elements
    even_elements = [l[i] for i in range(0, len(l), 2)]
    
    # Step 2: Sort the even indexed elements
    even_elements.sort()
    
    # Step 3: Create a new list to hold the result
    result = []
    
    # Step 4: Reconstruct the list
    even_index = 0  # Pointer for sorted even elements
    for i in range(len(l)):
        if i % 2 == 0:  # Even index
            result.append(even_elements[even_index])
            even_index += 1
        else:  # Odd index
            result.append(l[i])
    
    return result

# Example usage
print(sort_even([5, 6, 3, 4]))  # Output: [3, 6, 5, 4]
print(sort_even([1, 2, 3]))      # Output: [1, 2, 3]
```

### Explanation of the Code:
- We first extract the elements at even indices using a list comprehension.
- We sort these extracted elements.
- We then create a new list `result` and iterate through the original list, checking the index:
  - If the index is even, we append the next sorted element.
  - If the index is odd, we append the original element.
- Finally, we return the `result` list.

This solution efficiently sorts the even-indexed elements while preserving the odd-indexed elements, fulfilling the requirements of the problem statement.
