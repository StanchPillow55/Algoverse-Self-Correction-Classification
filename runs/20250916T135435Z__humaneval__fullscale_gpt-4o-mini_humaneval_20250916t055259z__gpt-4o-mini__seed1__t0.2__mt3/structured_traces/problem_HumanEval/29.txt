To solve the problem of filtering a list of strings based on a given prefix, we can break down the task into a few clear steps:

1. **Understand the Input and Output**: 
   - We are given a list of strings (`strings`) and a string (`prefix`).
   - The output should be a new list containing only those strings from the input list that start with the specified prefix.

2. **Consider Edge Cases**:
   - If the input list is empty, the output should also be an empty list.
   - If the prefix is an empty string, we should include all strings since all strings start with an empty prefix.
   - We should also consider cases where no strings match the prefix, in which case the output should be an empty list.

3. **Implementing the Logic**:
   - We can use a list comprehension to iterate through each string in the input list and check if it starts with the given prefix using the `str.startswith()` method.
   - This method is efficient and directly checks if a string begins with the specified substring.

4. **Function Definition**:
   - We will define the function `filter_by_prefix` that takes two parameters: `strings` (a list of strings) and `prefix` (a string).
   - We will return a new list that contains only the strings that start with the specified prefix.

Now, let's implement the function based on this reasoning:

```python
from typing import List

def filter_by_prefix(strings: List[str], prefix: str) -> List[str]:
    """ Filter an input list of strings only for ones that start with a given prefix.
    
    >>> filter_by_prefix([], 'a')
    []
    >>> filter_by_prefix(['abc', 'bcd', 'cde', 'array'], 'a')
    ['abc', 'array']
    """
    # Using list comprehension to filter strings that start with the given prefix
    return [s for s in strings if s.startswith(prefix)]
```

### Explanation of the Implementation:
- We use a list comprehension `[s for s in strings if s.startswith(prefix)]` which iterates over each string `s` in the `strings` list.
- The condition `s.startswith(prefix)` checks if the string `s` starts with the specified `prefix`.
- If the condition is true, `s` is included in the resulting list.
- Finally, the function returns the filtered list.

### Testing the Function:
The provided docstring includes examples that can be used as tests. We can run these tests to verify that the function behaves as expected. 

This implementation is efficient and straightforward, leveraging Python's built-in string methods to achieve the desired filtering.
