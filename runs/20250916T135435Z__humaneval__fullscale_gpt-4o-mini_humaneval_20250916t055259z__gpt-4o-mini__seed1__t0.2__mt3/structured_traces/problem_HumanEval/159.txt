To solve the problem, we need to determine how many total carrots the rabbit has eaten after trying to meet its daily meal requirement, and how many carrots are left after the meal.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Understanding Inputs**:
   - `number`: The number of carrots the rabbit has already eaten.
   - `need`: The number of additional carrots the rabbit needs to eat to satisfy its hunger.
   - `remaining`: The number of carrots that are still available to eat.

2. **Calculating Total Carrots Eaten**:
   - The total number of carrots the rabbit will eat after the meal can be calculated as:
     - If the `remaining` carrots are greater than or equal to the `need`, the rabbit can eat exactly `need` more carrots.
     - If the `remaining` carrots are less than the `need`, the rabbit will eat all the `remaining` carrots.

3. **Calculating Remaining Carrots**:
   - After determining how many carrots the rabbit will eat, we can calculate the remaining carrots:
     - If the rabbit eats `need` carrots, the remaining will be `remaining - need`.
     - If the rabbit eats all `remaining` carrots, then the remaining will be `0`.

4. **Final Output**:
   - We need to return a list containing:
     - The total number of carrots eaten (which is `number + carrots eaten`).
     - The number of carrots left after the meal.

### Implementation:

Now, let's implement the function based on the above reasoning.

```python
def eat(number, need, remaining):
    # Determine how many carrots the rabbit can eat
    if remaining >= need:
        carrots_eaten = need
    else:
        carrots_eaten = remaining
    
    # Calculate total eaten and remaining carrots
    total_eaten = number + carrots_eaten
    remaining_after_meal = remaining - carrots_eaten
    
    # Return the result as a list
    return [total_eaten, remaining_after_meal]

# Example test cases
print(eat(5, 6, 10))  # Expected output: [11, 4]
print(eat(4, 8, 9))   # Expected output: [12, 1]
print(eat(1, 10, 10))  # Expected output: [11, 0]
print(eat(2, 11, 5))   # Expected output: [7, 0]
```

### Explanation of the Code:
- We first check if the `remaining` carrots are enough to fulfill the `need`. If they are, we set `carrots_eaten` to `need`. Otherwise, we set it to `remaining`.
- We then calculate the total number of carrots eaten by adding `carrots_eaten` to `number`.
- Finally, we compute the remaining carrots after the meal and return the results in a list format.

This implementation is efficient and straightforward, adhering to the constraints provided in the problem statement.
