To solve the problem of determining whether a given number \( a \) (where \( a < 100 \)) is the product of exactly three prime numbers, we can break down the solution into several steps:

### Step 1: Understanding Prime Numbers
First, we need to understand what prime numbers are. A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. The first few prime numbers are: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97.

### Step 2: Generating Prime Numbers
Since \( a \) is less than 100, we can generate a list of all prime numbers less than 100. This will help us in checking combinations of these primes.

### Step 3: Finding Combinations
We need to check all combinations of three prime numbers (with repetition allowed) to see if their product equals \( a \). For example, for \( a = 30 \), we can check combinations like \( 2 \times 3 \times 5 \).

### Step 4: Implementing the Function
1. Generate a list of prime numbers less than 100.
2. Use nested loops to iterate through all combinations of three primes.
3. For each combination, calculate the product and check if it equals \( a \).
4. Return `True` if we find a combination that matches, otherwise return `False`.

### Implementation
Now, let's implement the function based on the above reasoning.

```python
def is_multiply_prime(a):
    """Write a function that returns true if the given number is the multiplication of 3 prime numbers
    and false otherwise.
    Knowing that (a) is less than 100. 
    Example:
    is_multiply_prime(30) == True
    30 = 2 * 3 * 5
    """
    
    # Step 1: List of prime numbers less than 100
    primes = [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 
              53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97]
    
    # Step 2: Check all combinations of three primes
    for i in range(len(primes)):
        for j in range(len(primes)):
            for k in range(len(primes)):
                product = primes[i] * primes[j] * primes[k]
                if product == a:
                    return True
    
    return False

# Example usage
print(is_multiply_prime(30))  # Should return True
print(is_multiply_prime(60))  # Should return True (3 * 5 * 4, but 4 is not prime)
print(is_multiply_prime(28))  # Should return False
```

### Explanation of the Code
1. **List of Primes**: We create a list of all prime numbers less than 100.
2. **Triple Nested Loop**: We use three nested loops to iterate through the list of primes. Each loop selects a prime number, allowing for repetition.
3. **Product Calculation**: For each combination of three primes, we calculate the product.
4. **Comparison**: We check if the product equals \( a \). If we find a match, we return `True`.
5. **Final Return**: If no combination matches \( a \), we return `False`.

This approach ensures that we check all possible combinations of three primes efficiently, given the constraint that \( a < 100 \).
