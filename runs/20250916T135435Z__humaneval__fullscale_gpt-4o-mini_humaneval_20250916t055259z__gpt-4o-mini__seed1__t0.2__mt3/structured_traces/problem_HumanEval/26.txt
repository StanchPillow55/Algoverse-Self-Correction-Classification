To solve the problem of removing duplicates from a list of integers while keeping the order of the remaining elements, we can break down the task into a series of steps:

1. **Understand the Requirements**: We need to create a function that takes a list of integers and returns a new list containing only those integers that appear exactly once in the original list. The order of the elements in the output list should match their first appearance in the input list.

2. **Plan the Approach**:
   - We will use a dictionary (or a `Counter` from the `collections` module) to count the occurrences of each integer in the input list.
   - After counting the occurrences, we will iterate through the original list and select only those integers that have a count of 1.
   - Finally, we will return the list of these selected integers.

3. **Implementation Steps**:
   - Import the necessary module for type hinting.
   - Define the function `remove_duplicates` that takes a list of integers as input.
   - Use a dictionary to count occurrences of each integer.
   - Create a new list to store integers that occur exactly once.
   - Iterate through the original list and append integers with a count of 1 to the new list.
   - Return the new list.

4. **Edge Cases**: Consider edge cases such as:
   - An empty list should return an empty list.
   - A list with all unique elements should return the same list.
   - A list where all elements are duplicates should return an empty list.

Now, let's implement the solution based on this reasoning:

```python
from typing import List
from collections import Counter

def remove_duplicates(numbers: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    """ From a list of integers, remove all elements that occur more than once.
    Keep order of elements left the same as in the input.
    >>> remove_duplicates([1, 2, 3, 2, 4])
    [1, 3, 4]
    """
    # Count occurrences of each number
    counts = Counter(numbers)
    
    # Create a list of numbers that occur exactly once
    result = [num for num in numbers if counts[num] == 1]
    
    return result
```

### Explanation of the Code:
- We import `List` from `typing` for type hinting and `Counter` from `collections` to easily count occurrences of each integer.
- The `remove_duplicates` function starts by counting the occurrences of each integer in the input list using `Counter`.
- We then use a list comprehension to create a new list, `result`, which includes only those integers from the original list that have a count of 1.
- Finally, we return the `result` list.

### Testing the Function:
You can test the function with the provided example and additional cases to ensure it behaves as expected:

```python
print(remove_duplicates([1, 2, 3, 2, 4]))  # Output: [1, 3, 4]
print(remove_duplicates([1, 1, 1, 1]))      # Output: []
print(remove_duplicates([1, 2, 3]))          # Output: [1, 2, 3]
print(remove_duplicates([]))                  # Output: []
print(remove_duplicates([1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4])) # Output: [1, 4]
```

This implementation is efficient and straightforward, adhering to the problem requirements.
