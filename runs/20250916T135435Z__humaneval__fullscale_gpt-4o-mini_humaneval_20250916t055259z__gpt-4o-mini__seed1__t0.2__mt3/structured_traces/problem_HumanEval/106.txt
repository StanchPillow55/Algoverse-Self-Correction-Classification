To solve the problem, we need to create a function `f(n)` that generates a list of size `n`. The elements of this list will depend on whether their index (starting from 1) is even or odd:

1. **Understanding the requirements**:
   - If the index `i` (1-based) is even, the value at that index should be the factorial of `i`.
   - If the index `i` is odd, the value at that index should be the sum of all integers from 1 to `i`.

2. **Factorial Calculation**:
   - The factorial of a number `i` (denoted as `i!`) is calculated as `1 * 2 * ... * i`. 
   - We can use a loop to compute the factorial iteratively.

3. **Sum Calculation**:
   - The sum of the first `i` natural numbers can be calculated using the formula: 
     \[
     \text{sum}(1 \text{ to } i) = \frac{i \times (i + 1)}{2}
     \]
   - Alternatively, we can also compute it using a loop, but the formula is more efficient.

4. **Iterating through indices**:
   - We will iterate from 1 to `n`, checking if the index is even or odd, and then compute the appropriate value to append to our result list.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - If `n` is 0, we should return an empty list.

Now, let's implement the function based on this reasoning:

```python
def f(n):
    """ Implement the function f that takes n as a parameter,
    and returns a list of size n, such that the value of the element at index i is the factorial of i if i is even
    or the sum of numbers from 1 to i otherwise.
    i starts from 1.
    """
    result = []
    
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        if i % 2 == 0:  # i is even
            # Calculate factorial of i
            factorial = 1
            for j in range(1, i + 1):
                factorial *= j
            result.append(factorial)
        else:  # i is odd
            # Calculate sum of numbers from 1 to i
            sum_to_i = (i * (i + 1)) // 2
            result.append(sum_to_i)
    
    return result

# Example usage:
print(f(5))  # Output: [1, 2, 6, 24, 15]
```

### Explanation of the Code:
- We define the function `f(n)` that initializes an empty list `result`.
- We loop from 1 to `n` (inclusive).
- For each index `i`, we check if it is even or odd:
  - If `i` is even, we compute the factorial using a simple loop.
  - If `i` is odd, we compute the sum using the formula.
- Finally, we return the constructed list.

This implementation is efficient and straightforward, adhering to the problem's requirements.
