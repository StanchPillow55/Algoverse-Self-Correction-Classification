To solve the problem of checking if the second word or any of its rotations is a substring of the first word, we can break down the solution into clear steps:

### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Understanding Rotations**: A rotation of a string can be generated by taking a substring from the beginning and moving it to the end. For example, the rotations of "abc" are "abc", "bca", and "cab".

2. **Generating Rotations**: For a string `b` of length `n`, we can generate all its rotations by concatenating `b` with itself (i.e., `b + b`). This way, all possible rotations of `b` will appear as substrings in the concatenated string. For example, for `b = "abc"`, `b + b = "abcabc"` contains "abc", "bca", and "cab".

3. **Checking for Substring**: Once we have the concatenated string, we can simply check if the first word `a` contains any of the rotations of `b` by checking if `b` (or its rotations) exists in `a`.

4. **Implementation**: We will implement a function that:
   - Concatenates `b` with itself.
   - Checks if `a` contains any substring of the concatenated string that matches `b`.

### Implementation

Now, let's implement the function based on the reasoning above.

```python
def cycpattern_check(a, b):
    """Check if the second word or any of its rotations is a substring in the first word."""
    # Create the concatenated string of b with itself
    b_rotations = b + b
    
    # Check if any rotation of b is a substring of a
    return b in b_rotations and any(rotation in a for rotation in (b_rotations[i:i+len(b)] for i in range(len(b))))

# Test cases
print(cycpattern_check("abcd", "abd"))  # False
print(cycpattern_check("hello", "ell"))  # True
print(cycpattern_check("whassup", "psus"))  # False
print(cycpattern_check("abab", "baa"))  # True
print(cycpattern_check("efef", "eeff"))  # False
print(cycpattern_check("himenss", "simen"))  # True
```

### Explanation of the Code

1. **Concatenation**: We create `b_rotations` by concatenating `b` with itself. This allows us to easily access all rotations.

2. **Substring Check**: We check if `b` is in `b_rotations` and then use a generator expression to check if any of the rotations (slices of `b_rotations` of length equal to `b`) are present in `a`.

3. **Return Value**: The function returns `True` if any rotation of `b` is found in `a`, otherwise it returns `False`.

### Testing

We can run the provided test cases to verify that the function behaves as expected. Each test case checks different scenarios of substring presence and rotation matching.

This approach is efficient and straightforward, leveraging string manipulation and substring checking to solve the problem effectively.
