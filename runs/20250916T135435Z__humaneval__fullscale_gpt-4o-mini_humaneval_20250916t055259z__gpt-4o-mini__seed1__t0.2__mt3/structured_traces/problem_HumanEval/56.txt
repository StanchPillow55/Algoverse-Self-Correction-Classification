To solve the problem of checking if every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket in a string of brackets (`<` and `>`), we can follow a systematic approach. Here’s how we can reason through the problem step by step:

### Step 1: Understanding the Problem
We need to determine if the string of brackets is correctly balanced. This means:
- Every `<` must have a corresponding `>`.
- The brackets must be in the correct order, meaning that at no point in the string should there be more closing brackets than opening brackets.

### Step 2: Defining the Conditions
1. **Count of Brackets**: We can maintain a counter that increments when we encounter a `<` and decrements when we encounter a `>`.
2. **Balance Check**: If at any point the counter goes negative, it means there are more closing brackets than opening brackets, and we should return `False`.
3. **Final Check**: At the end of the string, if the counter is zero, it means all opening brackets have been matched with closing brackets, and we return `True`. If it’s not zero, we return `False`.

### Step 3: Implementation
Now that we have a clear understanding of the logic, we can implement the function.

```python
def correct_bracketing(brackets: str) -> bool:
    """ 
    brackets is a string of "<" and ">".
    return True if every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket.
    """
    balance = 0  # Initialize a counter for the balance of brackets
    
    for char in brackets:
        if char == '<':
            balance += 1  # Increment for an opening bracket
        elif char == '>':
            balance -= 1  # Decrement for a closing bracket
        
        # If balance goes negative, we have more closing brackets than opening
        if balance < 0:
            return False
    
    # At the end, balance should be zero for a valid sequence
    return balance == 0

# Test cases
print(correct_bracketing("<"))        # Expected: False
print(correct_bracketing("<>"))       # Expected: True
print(correct_bracketing("<<><>>"))   # Expected: True
print(correct_bracketing("><<>"))     # Expected: False
```

### Explanation of the Code
- We initialize a variable `balance` to keep track of the number of unmatched opening brackets.
- We iterate through each character in the input string `brackets`.
- For each `<`, we increment the `balance`, and for each `>`, we decrement it.
- If at any point during the iteration the `balance` becomes negative, we immediately return `False` because it indicates that there are unmatched closing brackets.
- After processing all characters, we check if `balance` is zero. If it is, we return `True`, indicating that all opening brackets have been matched correctly.

This approach is efficient with a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the input string, as we only make a single pass through the string.
