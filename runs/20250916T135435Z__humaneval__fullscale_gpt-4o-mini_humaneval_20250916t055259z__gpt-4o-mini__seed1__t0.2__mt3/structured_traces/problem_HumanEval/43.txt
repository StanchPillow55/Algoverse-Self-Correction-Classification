To solve the problem of determining whether there are two distinct elements in a list that sum to zero, we can follow a systematic approach. Here's how I would think through the problem step by step:

### Step 1: Understand the Requirements
We need to check if there are two distinct integers in the list such that their sum equals zero. This means we are looking for pairs of numbers where one number is the negative of the other (e.g., if we have `x`, we need `-x`).

### Step 2: Analyze the Input and Output
- Input: A list of integers.
- Output: A boolean value (`True` or `False`).

### Step 3: Consider Edge Cases
- If the list has fewer than two elements, we can immediately return `False` since we need at least two distinct numbers to form a pair.
- We should also consider cases where the list contains duplicates, as we need distinct elements.

### Step 4: Choose an Efficient Approach
A naive approach would involve checking all pairs of numbers, which would take O(n^2) time. Instead, we can use a set to keep track of the numbers we have seen so far. This allows us to check for the existence of the negative counterpart in O(1) time.

### Step 5: Implementation Plan
1. Initialize an empty set to keep track of the numbers we encounter.
2. Iterate through each number in the list:
   - Check if the negative of the current number is already in the set.
   - If it is, return `True` (we found a pair).
   - If not, add the current number to the set.
3. If we finish iterating through the list without finding any pairs, return `False`.

### Step 6: Implement the Function
Now, let's implement the function based on the reasoning above.

```python
def pairs_sum_to_zero(l):
    """
    pairs_sum_to_zero takes a list of integers as an input.
    it returns True if there are two distinct elements in the list that
    sum to zero, and False otherwise.
    >>> pairs_sum_to_zero([1, 3, 5, 0])
    False
    >>> pairs_sum_to_zero([1, 3, -2, 1])
    False
    >>> pairs_sum_to_zero([1, 2, 3, 7])
    False
    >>> pairs_sum_to_zero([2, 4, -5, 3, 5, 7])
    True
    >>> pairs_sum_to_zero([1])
    False
    """
    seen = set()
    
    for number in l:
        if -number in seen:
            return True
        seen.add(number)
    
    return False
```

### Explanation of the Code
- We define the function `pairs_sum_to_zero` that takes a list `l`.
- We initialize an empty set called `seen`.
- We loop through each `number` in the list:
  - We check if `-number` is in the `seen` set.
  - If it is, we immediately return `True`.
  - If not, we add the `number` to the `seen` set.
- If we complete the loop without finding any pairs, we return `False`.

This implementation is efficient with a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of elements in the list, and it uses O(n) space for the set.
