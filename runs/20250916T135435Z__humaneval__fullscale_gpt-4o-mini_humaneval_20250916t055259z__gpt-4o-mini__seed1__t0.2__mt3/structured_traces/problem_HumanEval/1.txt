To solve the problem of separating groups of nested parentheses from a given string, we need to follow a systematic approach. Here's how I would break down the problem:

### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Input Processing**: The input is a string that may contain spaces and multiple groups of parentheses. Our first step will be to remove any spaces from the string to simplify our parsing.

2. **Initialization**: We will need to keep track of the current group of parentheses we are processing. We can use a list to store the separated groups of parentheses.

3. **Iterating Through the String**: We will iterate through each character in the cleaned string:
   - If we encounter an opening parenthesis `(`, we will start a new group.
   - If we encounter a closing parenthesis `)`, we will check if we are currently in a group. If we are, we will close the current group.

4. **Balancing Parentheses**: We need to ensure that we maintain a balance between opening and closing parentheses. We can use a counter to keep track of how many opening parentheses we have seen minus how many closing parentheses we have seen. When this counter returns to zero, it indicates that we have a complete group.

5. **Storing Groups**: Each time we complete a group (when the counter is zero), we will store that group in our list of results.

6. **Return the Result**: Finally, we will return the list of separated groups.

### Implementation

Now, let's implement the function based on the reasoning above:

```python
from typing import List

def separate_paren_groups(paren_string: str) -> List[str]:
    """Separate groups of nested parentheses from a string."""
    # Step 1: Remove spaces from the input string
    paren_string = paren_string.replace(" ", "")
    
    # Step 2: Initialize variables
    groups = []
    current_group = ""
    balance = 0
    
    # Step 3: Iterate through the characters in the string
    for char in paren_string:
        if char == '(':
            # Start a new group
            if balance == 0 and current_group:
                # If we were already in a group, save it before starting a new one
                groups.append(current_group)
                current_group = ""
            current_group += char
            balance += 1
        elif char == ')':
            current_group += char
            balance -= 1
            
            # Step 4: Check if we have a complete group
            if balance == 0:
                groups.append(current_group)
                current_group = ""
    
    # Return the list of groups
    return groups

# Example usage
print(separate_paren_groups('( ) (( )) (( )( ))'))  # Output: ['()', '(())', '(()())']
```

### Explanation of the Code

- We first remove spaces from the input string to focus solely on the parentheses.
- We initialize an empty list `groups` to store the resulting groups and a string `current_group` to build the current group of parentheses.
- We use a `balance` counter to track the number of open parentheses minus the number of closed parentheses.
- As we iterate through the string:
  - When we encounter an opening parenthesis, we check if we are starting a new group and update our `current_group` accordingly.
  - When we encounter a closing parenthesis, we append it to `current_group` and adjust the `balance`.
  - If the `balance` returns to zero, it indicates that we have completed a group, and we store it in the `groups` list.
- Finally, we return the list of separated groups.

This implementation effectively separates the groups of parentheses as required by the problem statement.
