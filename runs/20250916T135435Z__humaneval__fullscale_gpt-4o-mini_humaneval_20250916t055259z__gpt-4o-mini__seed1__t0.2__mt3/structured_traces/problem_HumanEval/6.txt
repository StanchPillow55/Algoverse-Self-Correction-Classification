To solve the problem of finding the maximum depth of nested parentheses for each group in a given string, we can break down the task into several steps:

1. **Input Parsing**: We need to split the input string into separate groups of parentheses. Each group is separated by spaces.

2. **Depth Calculation**: For each group, we need to calculate the maximum depth of nested parentheses. This can be done by iterating through each character in the group:
   - Increment a counter when we encounter an opening parenthesis `(`.
   - Decrement the counter when we encounter a closing parenthesis `)`.
   - Keep track of the maximum value of this counter during the iteration, which will represent the maximum depth of nesting.

3. **Output**: We will collect the maximum depths for each group and return them as a list of integers.

### Implementation Steps:
- Use the `split()` method to divide the input string into groups.
- For each group, initialize a depth counter and a variable to track the maximum depth.
- Loop through each character in the group to update the depth counter and the maximum depth.
- Append the maximum depth of each group to a result list.
- Finally, return the result list.

### Edge Cases:
- We should consider cases with empty groups or groups with no parentheses, which should return a depth of 0.

Now, let's implement the function based on this reasoning:

```python
from typing import List

def parse_nested_parens(paren_string: str) -> List[int]:
    """ Input to this function is a string represented multiple groups for nested parentheses separated by spaces.
    For each of the group, output the deepest level of nesting of parentheses.
    E.g. (()()) has maximum two levels of nesting while ((())) has three.

    >>> parse_nested_parens('(()()) ((())) () ((())()())')
    [2, 3, 1, 3]
    """
    # Split the input string into groups based on spaces
    groups = paren_string.split()
    result = []
    
    for group in groups:
        max_depth = 0
        current_depth = 0
        
        for char in group:
            if char == '(':
                current_depth += 1
                max_depth = max(max_depth, current_depth)
            elif char == ')':
                current_depth -= 1
        
        # Append the maximum depth found for this group
        result.append(max_depth)
    
    return result
```

### Explanation of the Code:
- We use `split()` to break the input string into groups.
- For each group, we initialize `max_depth` to keep track of the maximum depth encountered and `current_depth` to track the current level of nesting.
- We iterate through each character in the group:
  - If we encounter `(`, we increase the `current_depth` and check if it exceeds `max_depth`.
  - If we encounter `)`, we decrease the `current_depth`.
- After processing each group, we append the `max_depth` to the result list.
- Finally, we return the list of maximum depths for each group.

This implementation efficiently calculates the maximum depth of nested parentheses for each group in the input string.
