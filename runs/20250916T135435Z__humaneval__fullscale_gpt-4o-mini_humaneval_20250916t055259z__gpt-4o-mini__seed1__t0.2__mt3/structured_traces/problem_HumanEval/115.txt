To solve the problem of determining how many times we need to lower buckets to extract water from a grid of wells, we can break down the problem into a series of logical steps:

### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Understanding the Grid**: Each element in the grid represents a well, where `1` indicates the presence of water and `0` indicates no water. Each row corresponds to a different well.

2. **Counting Water Units**: We need to count the total number of `1`s in the grid, as each `1` represents a unit of water that needs to be extracted.

3. **Using Buckets**: Each bucket has a specific capacity, which tells us how many units of water can be extracted in one lowering of the bucket. To determine how many times we need to lower the buckets, we can use the total count of water units and divide it by the bucket capacity.

4. **Calculating Lowerings**: The number of times we need to lower the buckets can be calculated using the formula:
   \[
   \text{lowerings} = \lceil \frac{\text{total\_water}}{\text{capacity}} \rceil
   \]
   In Python, we can achieve this using integer division and the `math.ceil` function or by calculating it directly using:
   \[
   \text{lowerings} = \frac{\text{total\_water} + \text{capacity} - 1}{\text{capacity}}
   \]
   This formula effectively rounds up the division without needing to import additional libraries.

5. **Implementation**: We will iterate through the grid, count the total number of `1`s, and then apply the formula to find the number of lowerings required.

### Implementation

Now, let's implement the solution based on the reasoning above:

```python
def max_fill(grid, capacity):
    total_water = 0
    
    # Count the total number of water units (1s) in the grid
    for row in grid:
        total_water += sum(row)  # Each row is a list of 0s and 1s, sum gives the count of 1s
    
    # Calculate the number of times we need to lower the buckets
    if total_water == 0:
        return 0  # No water to extract
    
    # Using the formula to calculate the number of lowerings
    lowerings = (total_water + capacity - 1) // capacity  # This is equivalent to math.ceil(total_water / capacity)
    
    return lowerings

# Example usage:
print(max_fill([[0,0,1,0], [0,1,0,0], [1,1,1,1]], 1))  # Output: 6
print(max_fill([[0,0,1,1], [0,0,0,0], [1,1,1,1], [0,1,1,1]], 2))  # Output: 5
print(max_fill([[0,0,0], [0,0,0]], 5))  # Output: 0
```

### Explanation of the Code

- We initialize `total_water` to zero and iterate through each row of the grid.
- For each row, we sum the values (which counts the `1`s) and add that to `total_water`.
- After counting, we check if `total_water` is zero; if so, we return `0` since there is no water to extract.
- Finally, we calculate the number of lowerings using the formula and return that value.

This implementation is efficient and straightforward, adhering to the constraints provided in the problem statement.

To solve the problem of determining how many times we need to lower buckets to empty the wells represented by a grid, we can break down the problem into manageable steps. Hereâ€™s the reasoning and thought process:

### Step-by-Step Approach:

1. **Understanding the Grid**: Each element in the grid represents a well, where `1` indicates a unit of water and `0` indicates no water. The grid can have multiple rows, and each row corresponds to a different well.

2. **Bucket Capacity**: Each bucket can hold a certain number of units of water (given by `capacity`). This means that if a well has `n` units of water, it will take `ceil(n / capacity)` bucket lowers to empty that well.

3. **Iterate Through the Grid**: We need to iterate through each cell in the grid, count the total number of `1`s (units of water), and then calculate how many times we need to lower the buckets based on the capacity.

4. **Calculate Total Lowers**: For each well (row in the grid), we will sum the total units of water and then determine how many bucket lowers are needed by dividing the total units by the bucket capacity and rounding up.

5. **Return the Result**: Finally, we will return the total number of times we need to lower the buckets.

### Implementation:

Now, let's implement this logic in the `max_fill` function.

```python
def max_fill(grid, capacity):
    import math
    
    total_lowers = 0
    
    # Iterate through each row in the grid
    for row in grid:
        # Count the number of 1's in the current row (units of water)
        water_units = sum(row)
        
        # If there are water units, calculate how many lowers are needed
        if water_units > 0:
            lowers_needed = math.ceil(water_units / capacity)
            total_lowers += lowers_needed
            
    return total_lowers

# Example usage:
print(max_fill([[0,0,1,0], [0,1,0,0], [1,1,1,1]], 1))  # Output: 6
print(max_fill([[0,0,1,1], [0,0,0,0], [1,1,1,1], [0,1,1,1]], 2))  # Output: 5
print(max_fill([[0,0,0], [0,0,0]], 5))  # Output: 0
```

### Explanation of the Code:

- We import the `math` module to use the `ceil` function for rounding up.
- We initialize `total_lowers` to zero, which will keep track of the total number of times we need to lower the buckets.
- We loop through each row in the grid, counting the number of `1`s using `sum(row)`, which gives us the total units of water in that row.
- If there are water units, we calculate how many times we need to lower the bucket using `math.ceil(water_units / capacity)` and add that to `total_lowers`.
- Finally, we return the total number of lowers needed.

This implementation efficiently calculates the required number of bucket lowers based on the provided grid and bucket capacity.
