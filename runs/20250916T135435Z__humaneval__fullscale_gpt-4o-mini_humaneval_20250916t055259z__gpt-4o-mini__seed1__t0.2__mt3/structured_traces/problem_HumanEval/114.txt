To solve the problem of finding the minimum sum of any non-empty sub-array in a given list of integers, we can use a systematic approach. Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Step 1: Understanding Sub-arrays
A sub-array is a contiguous part of an array. For example, in the array `[2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 4]`, some possible sub-arrays are:
- `[2]`
- `[3, 4]`
- `[1, 2, 4]`
- `[2, 3, 4, 1]`
- etc.

### Step 2: Problem Requirements
We need to find the minimum sum of any of these sub-arrays. This means we need to consider all possible contiguous segments of the array and calculate their sums.

### Step 3: Efficient Calculation
Instead of generating all possible sub-arrays and calculating their sums (which would be inefficient), we can use a more efficient approach:
1. We can iterate through the array while maintaining a running sum of the current sub-array.
2. If the running sum becomes negative, we can reset it to zero (since starting a new sub-array from the next element might yield a smaller sum).
3. We will keep track of the minimum sum encountered during this process.

### Step 4: Implementation
We will implement the above logic in the `minSubArraySum` function. We will initialize a variable to keep track of the current sub-array sum and another variable to store the minimum sum found.

Here is the complete function definition:

```python
def minSubArraySum(nums):
    """
    Given an array of integers nums, find the minimum sum of any non-empty sub-array
    of nums.
    Example
    minSubArraySum([2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 4]) == 1
    minSubArraySum([-1, -2, -3]) == -6
    """
    # Initialize the minimum sum to a very large number
    min_sum = float('inf')
    current_sum = 0
    
    for num in nums:
        # Add the current number to the current sum
        current_sum += num
        
        # Update the minimum sum if the current sum is lower
        if current_sum < min_sum:
            min_sum = current_sum
        
        # If the current sum is positive, reset it to 0
        if current_sum > 0:
            current_sum = 0
    
    return min_sum
```

### Explanation of the Code:
1. **Initialization**: We start by initializing `min_sum` to infinity, which will help us find the minimum value. `current_sum` is initialized to zero.
2. **Iteration**: We loop through each number in the input list `nums`.
3. **Updating Current Sum**: We add the current number to `current_sum`.
4. **Checking Minimum**: If `current_sum` is less than `min_sum`, we update `min_sum`.
5. **Resetting Current Sum**: If `current_sum` becomes positive, we reset it to zero because starting a new sub-array from the next element could yield a smaller sum.
6. **Return Value**: Finally, we return `min_sum`, which contains the minimum sum of any non-empty sub-array.

### Complexity Analysis:
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the number of elements in the input array. We traverse the array once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), as we are using a constant amount of space for our variables.

This approach efficiently finds the minimum sub-array sum while ensuring we only traverse the list once, making it optimal for large inputs.
