To solve the problem of counting the number of sentences that start with the word "I" in a given string, we need to follow a systematic approach. Here’s how we can break down the problem:

### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Understanding the Input and Output**:
   - The input is a string `S` that may contain multiple sentences.
   - Sentences are separated by punctuation marks: `.`, `?`, or `!`.
   - We need to count how many of these sentences start with the word "I".

2. **Identifying Sentences**:
   - We can split the string into sentences using the specified delimiters. This can be achieved using the `re.split()` function from the `re` (regular expressions) module, which allows us to split the string based on multiple delimiters.

3. **Checking Each Sentence**:
   - After splitting the string into sentences, we need to check each sentence to see if it starts with "I". 
   - We should also consider leading whitespace that might be present before the word "I".

4. **Counting Valid Sentences**:
   - We will maintain a count of how many sentences start with "I" and return this count as the final output.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - We should handle cases where the input string is empty or contains no sentences.
   - We should also ensure that we are case-sensitive, meaning "I" should be counted, but "i" should not.

### Implementation

Now that we have a clear plan, let's implement the function `is_bored`.

```python
import re

def is_bored(S):
    """
    Count the number of sentences that start with the word "I".
    
    Parameters:
    S (str): The input string containing sentences.
    
    Returns:
    int: The count of sentences that start with "I".
    """
    # Split the string into sentences using regex to match the delimiters
    sentences = re.split(r'[.!?]', S)
    
    # Initialize the boredom count
    boredom_count = 0
    
    # Iterate through each sentence
    for sentence in sentences:
        # Strip leading and trailing whitespace
        stripped_sentence = sentence.strip()
        # Check if the stripped sentence starts with "I"
        if stripped_sentence.startswith("I"):
            boredom_count += 1
            
    return boredom_count

# Example usage
print(is_bored("Hello world"))  # Output: 0
print(is_bored("The sky is blue. The sun is shining. I love this weather"))  # Output: 1
print(is_bored("I am bored! Are you? I want to go home."))  # Output: 2
```

### Explanation of the Code:
- We import the `re` module to use regular expressions for splitting the string.
- The `re.split(r'[.!?]', S)` line splits the input string `S` into a list of sentences based on the specified delimiters.
- We initialize a counter `boredom_count` to zero.
- We iterate through each sentence, strip any leading or trailing whitespace, and check if it starts with "I".
- If it does, we increment the `boredom_count`.
- Finally, we return the count of sentences that start with "I".

This implementation is efficient and straightforward, adhering to the requirements of the problem.

To solve the problem of counting the number of sentences that start with the word "I" in a given string, we can break down the task into several steps:

1. **Understanding Sentence Delimiters**: We need to identify sentences in the input string. Sentences are separated by the characters '.', '?', or '!'. This means we can split the input string based on these delimiters.

2. **Splitting the String**: We can use the `re.split()` function from the `re` (regular expressions) module to split the string into sentences. This function allows us to specify multiple delimiters easily.

3. **Trimming Whitespace**: After splitting the string, we should trim any leading or trailing whitespace from each sentence. This is important because we want to accurately check if a sentence starts with "I".

4. **Counting Sentences**: We will iterate through the list of sentences and check if each one starts with the word "I". We can use the `str.startswith()` method for this purpose.

5. **Returning the Count**: Finally, we will return the count of sentences that start with "I".

Now, let's implement this logic in the `is_bored` function.

```python
import re

def is_bored(S):
    """
    Count the number of sentences that start with the word "I".
    
    A sentence is defined as a sequence of characters ending with '.', '?', or '!'.
    
    Args:
    S (str): The input string containing sentences.
    
    Returns:
    int: The count of sentences that start with "I".
    """
    # Step 1: Split the string into sentences using regex
    sentences = re.split(r'[.!?]', S)
    
    # Step 2: Initialize a counter for boredoms
    boredom_count = 0
    
    # Step 3: Iterate through each sentence
    for sentence in sentences:
        # Step 4: Strip leading/trailing whitespace
        trimmed_sentence = sentence.strip()
        
        # Step 5: Check if the trimmed sentence starts with "I"
        if trimmed_sentence.startswith("I"):
            boredom_count += 1
    
    # Step 6: Return the total count of boredoms
    return boredom_count

# Example usage:
print(is_bored("Hello world"))  # Output: 0
print(is_bored("The sky is blue. The sun is shining. I love this weather"))  # Output: 1
```

### Explanation of the Code:
- We import the `re` module to use regular expressions for splitting the string.
- The `re.split(r'[.!?]', S)` line splits the input string `S` at every occurrence of '.', '?', or '!', resulting in a list of sentences.
- We initialize a counter `boredom_count` to keep track of how many sentences start with "I".
- We loop through each sentence, trim it, and check if it starts with "I". If it does, we increment our counter.
- Finally, we return the count of sentences that start with "I".

This implementation is efficient and straightforward, adhering to the problem requirements.

To solve the problem of counting the number of sentences that start with the word "I" in a given string, we need to break down the task into manageable steps. Here’s how I would approach it:

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Input and Output**:
   - The input is a string `S` that contains sentences.
   - The output should be an integer representing the number of sentences that start with the word "I".

2. **Identifying Sentence Delimiters**:
   - Sentences are separated by '.', '?', or '!'. We need to split the string into sentences based on these delimiters.

3. **Processing Each Sentence**:
   - After splitting the string into sentences, we need to check each sentence to see if it starts with the word "I".
   - We should also consider leading whitespace, so we will need to strip any whitespace from the start of each sentence before checking.

4. **Counting Valid Sentences**:
   - We will maintain a counter that increments each time we find a sentence that starts with "I".

5. **Returning the Result**:
   - Finally, we will return the count of sentences that start with "I".

### Implementation:

Now, let's implement the function based on the above reasoning.

```python
def is_bored(S):
    """
    Count the number of sentences that start with the word "I".
    
    Parameters:
    S (str): A string containing sentences.
    
    Returns:
    int: The number of sentences that start with "I".
    """
    # Define the sentence delimiters
    delimiters = '.!?'
    
    # Split the string into sentences using the delimiters
    sentences = []
    current_sentence = []
    
    for char in S:
        if char in delimiters:
            # Join the current sentence and strip whitespace, then add to the list
            sentences.append(''.join(current_sentence).strip())
            current_sentence = []  # Reset for the next sentence
        else:
            current_sentence.append(char)
    
    # Don't forget to add the last sentence if there's no delimiter at the end
    if current_sentence:
        sentences.append(''.join(current_sentence).strip())
    
    # Count the sentences that start with "I"
    count = 0
    for sentence in sentences:
        if sentence.startswith("I"):
            count += 1
            
    return count

# Example usage
print(is_bored("Hello world"))  # Output: 0
print(is_bored("The sky is blue. The sun is shining. I love this weather"))  # Output: 1
```

### Explanation of the Code:
- We define the function `is_bored` that takes a string `S` as input.
- We iterate through each character in the string to build sentences based on the defined delimiters.
- Each time we encounter a delimiter, we join the characters collected so far into a sentence, strip any leading or trailing whitespace, and store it in a list.
- After processing all characters, we check each sentence in the list to see if it starts with "I" and count how many do.
- Finally, we return the count.

This implementation effectively counts the number of sentences starting with "I" while handling various edge cases, such as sentences without any delimiters at the end of the string.
