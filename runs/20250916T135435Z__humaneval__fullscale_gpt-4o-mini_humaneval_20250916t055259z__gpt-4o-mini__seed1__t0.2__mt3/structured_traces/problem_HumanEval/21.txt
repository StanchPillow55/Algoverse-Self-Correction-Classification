To solve the problem of rescaling a list of numbers such that the smallest number becomes 0 and the largest becomes 1, we can follow these steps:

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Understand the Linear Transformation**: 
   The goal is to transform the numbers in such a way that:
   - The minimum value in the list maps to 0.
   - The maximum value in the list maps to 1.
   
   For a given number \( x \) in the list, we can use the formula for linear transformation:
   \[
   \text{scaled\_value} = \frac{x - \text{min}}{\text{max} - \text{min}}
   \]
   where:
   - \( \text{min} \) is the minimum value in the list.
   - \( \text{max} \) is the maximum value in the list.

2. **Calculate Minimum and Maximum**:
   We will first find the minimum and maximum values in the input list. This can be done using Python's built-in `min()` and `max()` functions.

3. **Apply the Transformation**:
   We will iterate through each number in the list and apply the scaling formula to compute the new scaled value.

4. **Return the Result**:
   Finally, we will return a new list containing the scaled values.

### Implementation:

Now, let's implement the function based on the above reasoning.

```python
from typing import List

def rescale_to_unit(numbers: List[float]) -> List[float]:
    """ Given list of numbers (of at least two elements), apply a linear transform to that list,
    such that the smallest number will become 0 and the largest will become 1.
    
    >>> rescale_to_unit([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0])
    [0.0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0]
    """
    # Step 1: Find the minimum and maximum values in the list
    min_value = min(numbers)
    max_value = max(numbers)
    
    # Step 2: Calculate the range
    range_value = max_value - min_value
    
    # Step 3: Rescale each number
    scaled_numbers = [(x - min_value) / range_value for x in numbers]
    
    return scaled_numbers
```

### Explanation of the Code:

- We start by importing the `List` type from the `typing` module to specify the input type.
- The function `rescale_to_unit` takes a list of floats as input.
- We compute the minimum and maximum values using `min()` and `max()`.
- We calculate the range as the difference between the maximum and minimum values.
- We then use a list comprehension to apply the scaling formula to each number in the list.
- Finally, we return the new list of scaled numbers.

### Testing the Function:

The provided example in the docstring can be tested to ensure that the function works as expected. You can also add more test cases to validate the function with different inputs.
