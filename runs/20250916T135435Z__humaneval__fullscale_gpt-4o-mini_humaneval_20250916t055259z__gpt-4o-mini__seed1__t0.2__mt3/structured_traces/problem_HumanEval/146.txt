To solve the problem, we need to create a function `specialFilter` that processes a list of numbers and counts how many of them meet specific criteria. Let's break down the requirements step by step.

### Step 1: Understand the Requirements
The function should:
1. Take a list of numbers as input.
2. Return the count of numbers that:
   - Are greater than 10.
   - Have both their first and last digits as odd numbers (1, 3, 5, 7, 9).

### Step 2: Define the Criteria
- **Greater than 10**: This is straightforward; we can use a simple comparison.
- **First and Last Digits**: 
  - To find the first digit of a number, we can convert the number to a string and access the first character.
  - To find the last digit, we can access the last character of the string representation.
  - We need to check if both of these digits are odd.

### Step 3: Implementation Plan
1. Initialize a counter to zero.
2. Loop through each number in the input list:
   - Check if the number is greater than 10.
   - Convert the number to a string (taking care of negative numbers by using the absolute value).
   - Extract the first and last digits.
   - Check if both digits are odd.
   - If both conditions are satisfied, increment the counter.
3. Return the counter at the end.

### Step 4: Implement the Function
Now, let's implement the function based on the above reasoning.

```python
def specialFilter(nums):
    """Write a function that takes an array of numbers as input and returns 
    the number of elements in the array that are greater than 10 and both 
    first and last digits of a number are odd (1, 3, 5, 7, 9).
    For example:
    specialFilter([15, -73, 14, -15]) => 1 
    specialFilter([33, -2, -3, 45, 21, 109]) => 2
    """
    
    count = 0  # Initialize the counter
    
    for num in nums:
        if num > 10:  # Check if the number is greater than 10
            # Convert the number to a string, using absolute value to ignore negative sign
            str_num = str(abs(num))
            first_digit = str_num[0]  # First digit
            last_digit = str_num[-1]   # Last digit
            
            # Check if both first and last digits are odd
            if first_digit in '13579' and last_digit in '13579':
                count += 1  # Increment the counter if both conditions are met
    
    return count  # Return the final count
```

### Step 5: Testing the Function
We can test the function with the provided examples and some additional cases to ensure it behaves as expected.

```python
# Test cases
print(specialFilter([15, -73, 14, -15]))  # Expected output: 1
print(specialFilter([33, -2, -3, 45, 21, 109]))  # Expected output: 2
print(specialFilter([11, 13, 19, 20, 31]))  # Expected output: 3
print(specialFilter([-11, -13, -19, -20, -31]))  # Expected output: 0
print(specialFilter([22, 44, 66, 88]))  # Expected output: 0
```

This implementation should effectively count the numbers that meet the specified criteria.
