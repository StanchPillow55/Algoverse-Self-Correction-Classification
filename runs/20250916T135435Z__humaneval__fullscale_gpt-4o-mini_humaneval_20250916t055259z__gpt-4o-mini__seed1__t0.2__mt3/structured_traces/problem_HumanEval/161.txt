To solve the problem, we need to implement a function that processes a given string `s` according to specific rules regarding letter casing and string reversal. Let's break down the requirements step by step:

1. **Identify Characters**: We need to differentiate between letters (both uppercase and lowercase) and non-letter characters (like digits, symbols, etc.).

2. **Case Reversal**: For each letter in the string:
   - If it's lowercase (e.g., 'a'), we convert it to uppercase (e.g., 'A').
   - If it's uppercase (e.g., 'A'), we convert it to lowercase (e.g., 'a').
   - Non-letter characters should remain unchanged.

3. **String Reversal**: If the string contains no letters at all, we need to reverse the entire string.

4. **Return the Result**: Finally, we will return the modified string based on the above rules.

### Implementation Steps:
- First, we will check if there are any letters in the string.
- If there are letters, we will create a new string where we reverse the case of each letter while keeping non-letter characters unchanged.
- If there are no letters, we will simply reverse the entire string.
- We will use Python's string methods to check for letters and to change their case.

### Edge Cases:
- An empty string should return an empty string.
- Strings with only non-letter characters should be reversed.

Now, let's implement the function based on this reasoning.

```python
def solve(s):
    """You are given a string s.
    if s[i] is a letter, reverse its case from lower to upper or vice versa, 
    otherwise keep it as it is.
    If the string contains no letters, reverse the string.
    The function should return the resulted string.
    """
    # Check if there are any letters in the string
    has_letters = any(c.isalpha() for c in s)
    
    if has_letters:
        # Reverse case for letters and keep non-letters unchanged
        result = ''.join(c.upper() if c.islower() else c.lower() for c in s)
    else:
        # Reverse the entire string
        result = s[::-1]
    
    return result

# Test cases
print(solve("1234"))    # Output: "4321"
print(solve("ab"))      # Output: "AB"
print(solve("#a@C"))    # Output: "#A@c"
print(solve(""))        # Output: ""
print(solve("!@#$%^"))  # Output: "^%$#@!"
```

### Explanation of the Code:
- We use a generator expression `any(c.isalpha() for c in s)` to check if there are any letters in the string `s`.
- If letters are present, we construct a new string using a list comprehension that checks each character:
  - If the character is lowercase, we convert it to uppercase.
  - If it is uppercase, we convert it to lowercase.
  - Non-letter characters are appended unchanged.
- If no letters are found, we simply reverse the string using slicing `s[::-1]`.
- Finally, we return the resulting string. 

This implementation efficiently handles the requirements and edge cases specified in the problem statement.
