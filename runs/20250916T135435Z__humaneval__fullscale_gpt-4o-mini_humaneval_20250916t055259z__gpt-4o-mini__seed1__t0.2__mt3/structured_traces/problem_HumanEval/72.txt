To solve the problem of determining whether an object represented by a list `q` will fly based on two conditions (being balanced and having a sum of elements less than or equal to a maximum weight `w`), we can break down the solution into clear steps.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Check for Balance (Palindrome)**:
   - A list is considered balanced if it is a palindrome. A palindrome reads the same forwards and backwards. We can check this by comparing the list to its reverse.
   - In Python, we can reverse a list using slicing: `q[::-1]`.

2. **Calculate the Sum of Elements**:
   - We need to compute the sum of the elements in the list `q`. This can be done using the built-in `sum()` function.

3. **Check Conditions**:
   - The object will fly if:
     - The list is a palindrome (balanced).
     - The sum of the elements in the list is less than or equal to `w`.

4. **Return the Result**:
   - Based on the checks, we will return `True` if both conditions are satisfied; otherwise, we will return `False`.

### Implementation

Now that we have a clear understanding of the steps involved, we can implement the function `will_it_fly`.

```python
def will_it_fly(q, w):
    '''
    Write a function that returns True if the object q will fly, and False otherwise.
    The object q will fly if it's balanced (it is a palindromic list) and the sum of its elements is less than or equal the maximum possible weight w.
    '''
    # Check if the list is a palindrome
    is_balanced = (q == q[::-1])
    
    # Calculate the sum of the elements
    total_weight = sum(q)
    
    # Check if the total weight is less than or equal to w
    is_within_weight_limit = (total_weight <= w)
    
    # The object will fly if both conditions are satisfied
    return is_balanced and is_within_weight_limit

# Example test cases
print(will_it_fly([1, 2], 5))  # ➞ False
print(will_it_fly([3, 2, 3], 1))  # ➞ False
print(will_it_fly([3, 2, 3], 9))  # ➞ True
print(will_it_fly([3], 5))  # ➞ True
```

### Explanation of the Code

- The function `will_it_fly` takes two parameters: `q` (the list of weights) and `w` (the maximum weight).
- We first check if `q` is a palindrome by comparing it to its reverse.
- We then calculate the total weight of the elements in `q`.
- Finally, we check if both conditions (palindrome and weight limit) are satisfied and return the appropriate boolean value.

This implementation is efficient and straightforward, leveraging Python's built-in capabilities for list manipulation and arithmetic.
