To solve the problem of finding the second smallest element in a list of integers, we need to consider a few key points:

1. **Understanding the Input and Output**:
   - The input is a list of integers.
   - The output should be the second smallest unique integer from the list.
   - If the list has fewer than two unique integers, we should return `None`.

2. **Identifying Unique Elements**:
   - Since we are interested in the second smallest unique integer, we need to filter out duplicates from the list.

3. **Sorting the Unique Elements**:
   - Once we have the unique elements, we can sort them. The second smallest element will then be the element at index 1 of the sorted list (if it exists).

4. **Handling Edge Cases**:
   - If the list is empty, we should return `None`.
   - If there is only one unique element, we should also return `None`.

### Step-by-Step Approach:

1. **Remove Duplicates**: Convert the list to a set to eliminate duplicates.
2. **Sort the Unique Elements**: Convert the set back to a list and sort it.
3. **Check the Length**: If the length of the sorted list is less than 2, return `None`.
4. **Return the Second Smallest**: If there are at least two unique elements, return the element at index 1.

### Implementation:

Now, let's implement this logic in the `next_smallest` function.

```python
def next_smallest(lst):
    """
    Returns the 2nd smallest unique element from the list of integers.
    Returns None if there is no such element.
    """
    # Step 1: Remove duplicates by converting the list to a set
    unique_elements = set(lst)
    
    # Step 2: Convert the set back to a sorted list
    sorted_unique = sorted(unique_elements)
    
    # Step 3: Check if there are at least two unique elements
    if len(sorted_unique) < 2:
        return None
    
    # Step 4: Return the second smallest element
    return sorted_unique[1]

# Test cases
print(next_smallest([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]))  # Expected output: 2
print(next_smallest([5, 1, 4, 3, 2]))  # Expected output: 2
print(next_smallest([]))                # Expected output: None
print(next_smallest([1, 1]))            # Expected output: None
```

### Explanation of the Code:

- We start by converting the input list `lst` into a set called `unique_elements` to remove any duplicate values.
- We then sort the unique elements and store them in `sorted_unique`.
- We check the length of `sorted_unique`. If it has fewer than two elements, we return `None`.
- If there are at least two unique elements, we return the second smallest element, which is at index 1 of the sorted list.

This implementation is efficient and straightforward, handling all specified edge cases correctly.
