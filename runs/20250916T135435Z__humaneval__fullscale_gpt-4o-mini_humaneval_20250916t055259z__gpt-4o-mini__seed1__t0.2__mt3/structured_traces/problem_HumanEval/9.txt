To solve the problem of generating a list of rolling maximums from a given list of integers, we need to understand what a rolling maximum is. The rolling maximum at each position in the list is the maximum value encountered in the list from the start up to that position.

### Step-by-Step Approach:

1. **Initialization**: We need to keep track of the maximum value encountered so far as we iterate through the list. We can initialize a variable, say `current_max`, to a very small number (or the first element of the list if it exists).

2. **Iteration**: We will iterate through each number in the input list. For each number:
   - Compare it with `current_max`.
   - Update `current_max` if the current number is greater than `current_max`.
   - Append `current_max` to the result list.

3. **Output**: After processing all numbers, we will have a list that contains the rolling maximums, which we will return.

### Implementation:

Now, let's implement this logic in the `rolling_max` function.

```python
from typing import List

def rolling_max(numbers: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    """ From a given list of integers, generate a list of rolling maximum element found until given moment
    in the sequence.
    
    >>> rolling_max([1, 2, 3, 2, 3, 4, 2])
    [1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4]
    """
    if not numbers:  # Handle the case of an empty list
        return []
    
    result = []
    current_max = numbers[0]  # Initialize current_max with the first element
    
    for number in numbers:
        if number > current_max:
            current_max = number  # Update current_max if the current number is greater
        result.append(current_max)  # Append the current maximum to the result list
    
    return result
```

### Explanation of the Code:

1. **Input Check**: We first check if the input list `numbers` is empty. If it is, we return an empty list immediately.

2. **Initialization**: We initialize `result` as an empty list to store the rolling maximums. We set `current_max` to the first element of the list.

3. **Loop Through Numbers**: We loop through each number in the list:
   - If the current number is greater than `current_max`, we update `current_max`.
   - We append the current maximum to the `result` list.

4. **Return Result**: Finally, we return the `result` list, which contains the rolling maximums.

### Testing the Function:

We can test the function using the provided example and additional test cases to ensure it works correctly.

```python
# Test cases
print(rolling_max([1, 2, 3, 2, 3, 4, 2]))  # Expected: [1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4]
print(rolling_max([5, 3, 8, 1, 4]))        # Expected: [5, 5, 8, 8, 8]
print(rolling_max([-1, -5, -3, -4]))       # Expected: [-1, -1, -1, -1]
print(rolling_max([]))                      # Expected: []
print(rolling_max([10]))                    # Expected: [10]
```

This implementation is efficient with a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the input list, as we only make a single pass through the list.
