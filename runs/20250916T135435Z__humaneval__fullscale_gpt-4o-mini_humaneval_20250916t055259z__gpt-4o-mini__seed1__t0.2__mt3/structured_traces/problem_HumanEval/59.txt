To solve the problem of finding the largest prime factor of a given integer \( n \), we need to follow a systematic approach. Hereâ€™s how we can break down the problem:

### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Understanding Prime Factors**: A prime factor of a number \( n \) is a prime number that divides \( n \) without leaving a remainder. For example, the prime factors of 13195 are 5, 7, 13, and 29.

2. **Finding Factors**: To find the prime factors of \( n \), we can start dividing \( n \) by the smallest prime (which is 2) and continue dividing until \( n \) becomes 1. If \( n \) is divisible by a number, we keep dividing \( n \) by that number until it no longer divides evenly.

3. **Iterating Through Possible Factors**: We can iterate through potential factors starting from 2 up to the square root of \( n \). If a factor divides \( n \), we will keep dividing \( n \) by that factor and keep track of the largest factor found.

4. **Handling Remaining \( n \)**: After checking all factors up to the square root of \( n \), if \( n \) is still greater than 1, then \( n \) itself is a prime factor and should be considered.

5. **Implementation**: We will implement this logic in the `largest_prime_factor` function.

### Implementation

Now, let's implement the function based on the reasoning above:

```python
def largest_prime_factor(n: int) -> int:
    """Return the largest prime factor of n. Assume n > 1 and is not a prime.
    >>> largest_prime_factor(13195)
    29
    >>> largest_prime_factor(2048)
    2
    """
    # Initialize the largest prime factor
    largest_factor = None
    
    # Check for number of 2s that divide n
    while n % 2 == 0:
        largest_factor = 2
        n //= 2  # Divide n by 2
    
    # n must be odd at this point, so we can skip even numbers
    for i in range(3, int(n**0.5) + 1, 2):
        while n % i == 0:
            largest_factor = i
            n //= i  # Divide n by i
    
    # This condition is to check if n is a prime number greater than 2
    if n > 2:
        largest_factor = n
    
    return largest_factor
```

### Explanation of the Code

1. **Initialization**: We start by initializing `largest_factor` to `None`.

2. **Handling Factor of 2**: We use a while loop to divide \( n \) by 2 until it is no longer divisible. Each time we do this, we update `largest_factor` to 2.

3. **Checking Odd Factors**: We then iterate through odd numbers starting from 3 up to the square root of \( n \). For each odd number \( i \), we again use a while loop to divide \( n \) by \( i \) until it is no longer divisible, updating `largest_factor` accordingly.

4. **Final Check**: After the loop, if \( n \) is still greater than 2, it means \( n \) itself is a prime number and is the largest prime factor.

5. **Return Value**: Finally, we return the largest prime factor found.

### Conclusion

This implementation efficiently finds the largest prime factor of \( n \) using a combination of trial division and careful tracking of the largest factor encountered. The time complexity is approximately \( O(\sqrt{n}) \), making it suitable for reasonably large values of \( n \).
