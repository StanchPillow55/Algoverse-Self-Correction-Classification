To solve the problem of finding the word with the maximum number of unique characters from a list of strings, we can break down the task into several clear steps:

1. **Understanding Unique Characters**: For each word, we need to determine how many unique characters it contains. This can be easily achieved by converting the word into a set, as sets inherently store only unique items.

2. **Comparing Words**: We need to keep track of the word with the highest count of unique characters. If we encounter another word with the same count of unique characters, we will compare them lexicographically (i.e., in dictionary order) to determine which one should be retained.

3. **Iterating Through the List**: We will iterate through each word in the provided list, calculate the number of unique characters, and update our tracking variables accordingly.

4. **Return the Result**: After processing all words, we will return the word that has the maximum number of unique characters, or the one that comes first lexicographically in case of a tie.

Now, let's implement this logic in the `find_max` function.

### Implementation

```python
def find_max(words):
    """Write a function that accepts a list of strings.
    The list contains different words. Return the word with maximum number
    of unique characters. If multiple strings have maximum number of unique
    characters, return the one which comes first in lexicographical order.
    """
    
    max_word = ""
    max_unique_count = 0
    
    for word in words:
        # Calculate the number of unique characters in the word
        unique_count = len(set(word))
        
        # Check if this word has more unique characters
        if unique_count > max_unique_count:
            max_unique_count = unique_count
            max_word = word
        elif unique_count == max_unique_count:
            # If the count is the same, check lexicographical order
            if word < max_word:
                max_word = word
    
    return max_word
```

### Explanation of the Code

1. **Initialization**: We start by initializing `max_word` to an empty string and `max_unique_count` to zero. These will help us keep track of the best candidate as we iterate through the list.

2. **Loop Through Words**: We loop through each word in the input list `words`.

3. **Count Unique Characters**: For each word, we convert it to a set to count the unique characters using `len(set(word))`.

4. **Update Logic**:
   - If the current word has more unique characters than our current maximum, we update both `max_unique_count` and `max_word`.
   - If the unique character count is the same as the current maximum, we compare the words lexicographically using the `<` operator. If the current word is smaller (comes first), we update `max_word`.

5. **Return the Result**: After the loop, we return `max_word`, which will be the word with the maximum number of unique characters or the lexicographically smallest one in case of a tie.

### Testing the Function

We can test the function with the provided examples to ensure it behaves as expected:

```python
print(find_max(["name", "of", "string"]))  # Expected: "string"
print(find_max(["name", "enam", "game"]))  # Expected: "enam"
print(find_max(["aaaaaaa", "bb", "cc"]))   # Expected: "aaaaaaa"
```

This implementation is efficient and straightforward, adhering to the problem's requirements.
