To solve the problem of summing the elements with at most two digits from the first `k` elements of the given array `arr`, we can break down the solution into several clear steps:

1. **Understanding the Input and Output**:
   - We have an array of integers `arr` and an integer `k`.
   - We need to consider only the first `k` elements of `arr`.
   - We will sum only those elements that have at most two digits (i.e., numbers between -99 and 99 inclusive).

2. **Constraints**:
   - The length of `arr` is between 1 and 100.
   - The value of `k` is guaranteed to be at least 1 and at most the length of `arr`.

3. **Plan**:
   - We will iterate through the first `k` elements of `arr`.
   - For each element, we will check if it is within the range of -99 to 99.
   - If it is, we will add it to a cumulative sum.
   - Finally, we will return the cumulative sum.

4. **Implementation**:
   - We will define a function `add_elements` that takes `arr` and `k` as parameters.
   - We will initialize a variable to hold the sum.
   - We will use a loop to iterate through the first `k` elements and apply the conditions mentioned.

Now, let's implement the solution in Python:

```python
def add_elements(arr, k):
    """
    Given a non-empty array of integers arr and an integer k, return
    the sum of the elements with at most two digits from the first k elements of arr.
    """
    total_sum = 0  # Initialize the sum to zero
    
    # Iterate through the first k elements of arr
    for i in range(k):
        # Check if the current element has at most two digits
        if -99 <= arr[i] <= 99:
            total_sum += arr[i]  # Add to the sum if condition is met
    
    return total_sum  # Return the final sum
```

### Explanation of the Code:
- We define the function `add_elements` which takes `arr` and `k` as parameters.
- We initialize `total_sum` to zero to start accumulating the sum.
- We use a `for` loop to iterate over the range from `0` to `k-1`, which gives us the first `k` elements of the array.
- Inside the loop, we check if the current element is between -99 and 99. If it is, we add it to `total_sum`.
- After the loop completes, we return the `total_sum`.

### Example Walkthrough:
For the input `arr = [111, 21, 3, 4000, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]` and `k = 4`:
- The first `k` elements are `[111, 21, 3, 4000]`.
- Among these, `21` and `3` are the only numbers with at most two digits.
- Their sum is `21 + 3 = 24`, which is the expected output.

This implementation is efficient and straightforward, adhering to the problem constraints and requirements.
