To solve the problem, we need to create a function called `sum_squares` that processes a list of integers according to specific rules based on the indices of the elements in the list. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of how we can approach this problem:

### Step 1: Understand the Requirements
1. **Input**: A list of integers.
2. **Processing**:
   - If the index of an integer is a multiple of 3, we square that integer.
   - If the index is a multiple of 4 but not a multiple of 3, we cube that integer.
   - If the index is neither, we leave the integer unchanged.
3. **Output**: The function should return the sum of all processed integers.

### Step 2: Identify Edge Cases
- An empty list should return 0.
- Lists with negative integers should be handled correctly since squaring and cubing will affect their values.

### Step 3: Plan the Implementation
1. Initialize a variable to hold the sum of the processed integers.
2. Iterate through the list using `enumerate` to get both the index and the value.
3. For each index-value pair:
   - Check if the index is a multiple of 3.
   - If true, square the value.
   - If false, check if it is a multiple of 4.
   - If true, cube the value.
   - If neither, keep the value unchanged.
4. Add the processed value to the sum.
5. Return the final sum.

### Step 4: Implement the Function
Now that we have a clear plan, let's implement the function.

```python
def sum_squares(lst):
    """
    This function will take a list of integers. For all entries in the list, the function shall square the integer entry if its index is a 
    multiple of 3 and will cube the integer entry if its index is a multiple of 4 and not a multiple of 3. The function will not 
    change the entries in the list whose indexes are not a multiple of 3 or 4. The function shall then return the sum of all entries. 
    """
    total_sum = 0  # Initialize the sum
    
    for index, value in enumerate(lst):
        if index % 3 == 0:  # Check if index is a multiple of 3
            total_sum += value ** 2  # Square the value
        elif index % 4 == 0:  # Check if index is a multiple of 4 (and not 3 due to the previous condition)
            total_sum += value ** 3  # Cube the value
        else:
            total_sum += value  # Keep the value unchanged
    
    return total_sum  # Return the total sum
```

### Step 5: Testing the Function
Now we can test the function with the provided examples to ensure it behaves as expected.

```python
# Test cases
print(sum_squares([1, 2, 3]))  # Expected output: 6
print(sum_squares([]))         # Expected output: 0
print(sum_squares([-1, -5, 2, -1, -5]))  # Expected output: -126
```

### Conclusion
The function `sum_squares` has been implemented according to the problem's requirements. It processes the list based on the index conditions and returns the correct sum. The implementation has been tested with example cases to verify its correctness.
