To solve the problem of computing the n-th element of the FibFib number sequence, we need to understand the sequence's definition and how it differs from the traditional Fibonacci sequence.

### Understanding the FibFib Sequence

The FibFib sequence is defined as follows:
- fibfib(0) = 0
- fibfib(1) = 0
- fibfib(2) = 1
- For n >= 3, fibfib(n) = fibfib(n-1) + fibfib(n-2) + fibfib(n-3)

This means that each term in the sequence (starting from the third term) is the sum of the three preceding terms.

### Step-by-Step Approach

1. **Base Cases**: We need to handle the base cases explicitly:
   - If n = 0, return 0.
   - If n = 1, return 0.
   - If n = 2, return 1.

2. **Recursive Definition**: For n >= 3, we will compute the value using the recursive definition. However, a naive recursive approach would lead to a lot of repeated calculations, which is inefficient.

3. **Dynamic Programming**: To efficiently compute the n-th FibFib number, we can use a dynamic programming approach:
   - We will maintain a list (or array) to store the computed values of the sequence up to n.
   - We will iteratively fill this list using the defined relationship.

4. **Space Optimization**: Since we only need the last three computed values at any time to calculate the next value, we can optimize our space usage by only keeping track of the last three values instead of storing the entire sequence.

### Implementation

Now, let's implement the function based on the above reasoning:

```python
def fibfib(n: int) -> int:
    """Compute the n-th element of the FibFib number sequence."""
    # Handle base cases
    if n == 0:
        return 0
    elif n == 1:
        return 0
    elif n == 2:
        return 1
    
    # Initialize the first three FibFib numbers
    a, b, c = 0, 0, 1  # fibfib(0), fibfib(1), fibfib(2)
    
    # Compute fibfib(n) for n >= 3
    for i in range(3, n + 1):
        # fibfib(i) = fibfib(i-1) + fibfib(i-2) + fibfib(i-3)
        next_value = a + b + c
        # Update the last three values
        a, b, c = b, c, next_value
    
    return c  # c holds fibfib(n)

# Testing the function with provided examples
print(fibfib(1))  # Expected output: 0
print(fibfib(5))  # Expected output: 4
print(fibfib(8))  # Expected output: 24
```

### Explanation of the Code

- We start by checking the base cases for n = 0, 1, and 2.
- For n >= 3, we initialize three variables `a`, `b`, and `c` to represent the last three computed values of the sequence.
- We then use a loop to compute the next value in the sequence by summing the last three values and updating them accordingly.
- Finally, we return the value of `c`, which will contain the n-th FibFib number after the loop completes.

This implementation is efficient, with a time complexity of O(n) and a space complexity of O(1), making it suitable for larger values of n.
