To solve the problem of encoding a message according to the specified rules, we need to break down the requirements step by step:

1. **Swap Case**: For each character in the message, if it's lowercase, we need to convert it to uppercase, and vice versa.

2. **Replace Vowels**: We need to identify vowels (a, e, i, o, u) and replace each vowel with the letter that appears two places ahead in the English alphabet. For example:
   - 'a' becomes 'c'
   - 'e' becomes 'g'
   - 'i' becomes 'k'
   - 'o' becomes 'q'
   - 'u' becomes 'w'
   We also need to consider the uppercase vowels:
   - 'A' becomes 'C'
   - 'E' becomes 'G'
   - 'I' becomes 'K'
   - 'O' becomes 'Q'
   - 'U' becomes 'W'

3. **Iterate Through the Message**: We will iterate through each character in the input message, apply the case swap, and if the character is a vowel, replace it accordingly.

4. **Construct the Result**: We will build the resulting encoded message as we process each character.

5. **Return the Result**: Finally, we will return the encoded message.

Now, let's implement the function based on this reasoning.

```python
def encode(message):
    # Define the vowels and their replacements
    vowels = {
        'a': 'c', 'e': 'g', 'i': 'k', 'o': 'q', 'u': 'w',
        'A': 'C', 'E': 'G', 'I': 'K', 'O': 'Q', 'U': 'W'
    }
    
    # Initialize an empty list to hold the encoded characters
    encoded_message = []
    
    # Iterate through each character in the message
    for char in message:
        # Swap case
        if char.islower():
            swapped_char = char.upper()
        else:
            swapped_char = char.lower()
        
        # Replace if it's a vowel
        if swapped_char in vowels:
            swapped_char = vowels[swapped_char]
        
        # Append the processed character to the result list
        encoded_message.append(swapped_char)
    
    # Join the list into a single string and return
    return ''.join(encoded_message)

# Example usage
print(encode('test'))  # Output: 'TGST'
print(encode('This is a message'))  # Output: 'tHKS KS C MGSSCGG'
```

### Explanation of the Code:
- We define a dictionary `vowels` that maps each vowel to its corresponding replacement.
- We create an empty list `encoded_message` to store the processed characters.
- We loop through each character in the input `message`:
  - We check if the character is lowercase or uppercase and swap its case accordingly.
  - If the swapped character is a vowel (checked using the `vowels` dictionary), we replace it with its corresponding value from the dictionary.
  - We append the processed character to the `encoded_message` list.
- Finally, we join the list into a single string and return it.

This implementation efficiently encodes the message according to the specified rules.
