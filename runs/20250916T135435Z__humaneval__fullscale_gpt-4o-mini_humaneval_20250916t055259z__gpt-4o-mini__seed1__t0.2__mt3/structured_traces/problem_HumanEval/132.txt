To solve the problem of determining whether a string of square brackets contains a valid subsequence where at least one bracket is nested, we need to break down the requirements and develop a systematic approach.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Understanding Nested Brackets**: 
   - A nested bracket is defined as a pair of brackets where one bracket is inside another. For example, in the string `[[]]`, the inner `[]` is nested within the outer `[]`.
   - A valid subsequence means that the brackets must be properly opened and closed. For example, `[]` is valid, but `][` is not.

2. **Identifying Valid Nested Structures**:
   - We need to check if there exists at least one pair of brackets that are nested. This can be identified by ensuring that there are at least two pairs of brackets, where one pair is completely enclosed by another.

3. **Approach**:
   - We can use a stack-based approach to keep track of the opening brackets.
   - We will iterate through the string:
     - For every opening bracket `[`, we push it onto the stack.
     - For every closing bracket `]`, we check if there is a corresponding opening bracket in the stack.
     - If we find a closing bracket and the stack is not empty, we pop the top of the stack.
     - We also need to keep track of whether we have encountered a nested structure. This can be done by checking if we have more than one opening bracket before we close one.

4. **Implementation**:
   - We will maintain a counter for the number of opening brackets and a flag to indicate if we have found a nested structure.
   - If we close a bracket and the count of opening brackets before this closing bracket was more than one, we can conclude that we have found a nested structure.

### Implementation:

Now, let's implement the function `is_nested` based on the above reasoning.

```python
def is_nested(string):
    # Stack to keep track of opening brackets
    stack = []
    # Counter for the number of opening brackets
    open_count = 0
    # Flag to indicate if we have found a nested structure
    nested_found = False
    
    for char in string:
        if char == '[':
            # Push to stack and increment open count
            stack.append(char)
            open_count += 1
        elif char == ']':
            if stack:
                # We have a matching opening bracket
                stack.pop()
                open_count -= 1
                # If we had more than one opening bracket before this closing
                if open_count > 0:
                    nested_found = True
            else:
                # Unmatched closing bracket
                return False
    
    # At the end, we should have no unmatched opening brackets
    if stack:
        return False
    
    # We need at least one nested structure
    return nested_found

# Testing the function with provided examples
print(is_nested('[[]]'))  # ➞ True
print(is_nested('[]]]]]]][[[[[]'))  # ➞ False
print(is_nested('[][]'))  # ➞ False
print(is_nested('[]'))  # ➞ False
print(is_nested('[[][]]'))  # ➞ True
print(is_nested('[[]][['))  # ➞ True
```

### Explanation of the Code:
- We initialize a stack to keep track of opening brackets and a counter for how many opening brackets we have encountered.
- As we iterate through the string, we handle opening and closing brackets accordingly.
- We check for nesting by seeing if we have more than one opening bracket before we close one.
- Finally, we ensure that the stack is empty (indicating all brackets were matched) and return whether we found any nested structures.

This implementation efficiently checks for nested brackets in a single pass through the string, ensuring a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the input string.

To solve the problem of determining whether a string of square brackets contains a valid nested subsequence, we need to break down the requirements and formulate a plan.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Understanding Nested Brackets**:
   - A nested bracket structure means that there is at least one pair of brackets where one bracket is inside another. For example, in the string `[[]]`, the inner `[]` is nested within the outer `[]`.

2. **Valid Subsequences**:
   - A valid subsequence of brackets means that the brackets are properly opened and closed. For instance, `[]` is valid, but `][` is not.

3. **Conditions for Nesting**:
   - To have a nested structure, we need at least one pair of brackets that contains another pair. This means we need to find at least one instance of `[` followed by another `[` before we find a closing `]`.

4. **Iterative Approach**:
   - We can use a counter to track the balance of opening and closing brackets. We will iterate through the string and:
     - Increment the counter for each `[` encountered.
     - Decrement the counter for each `]` encountered.
     - If at any point the counter goes negative, it means we have an unmatched closing bracket, and we can immediately return `False`.
     - We also need to check if we have seen at least one nested structure.

5. **Final Check**:
   - After processing the string, if the counter is zero (indicating all brackets are matched) and we have found at least one nested structure, we return `True`. Otherwise, we return `False`.

### Implementation:

Now, let's implement the function based on the above reasoning.

```python
def is_nested(string):
    '''
    Create a function that takes a string as input which contains only square brackets.
    The function should return True if and only if there is a valid subsequence of brackets 
    where at least one bracket in the subsequence is nested.
    '''
    balance = 0
    has_nested = False
    
    for char in string:
        if char == '[':
            balance += 1
            # Check if we have seen at least one opening bracket before this one
            if balance > 1:
                has_nested = True
        elif char == ']':
            balance -= 1
            
            # If balance goes negative, we have an unmatched closing bracket
            if balance < 0:
                return False
    
    # At the end, balance should be zero for valid brackets
    return balance == 0 and has_nested

# Test cases
print(is_nested('[[]]'))  # True
print(is_nested('[]]]]]]][[[[[]'))  # False
print(is_nested('[][]'))  # False
print(is_nested('[]'))  # False
print(is_nested('[[][]]'))  # True
print(is_nested('[[]][['))  # True
```

### Explanation of the Code:
- We initialize `balance` to keep track of the number of unmatched opening brackets and `has_nested` to check if we have found a nested structure.
- We loop through each character in the input string:
  - For each `[`, we increment the balance and check if we have more than one opening bracket, which indicates nesting.
  - For each `]`, we decrement the balance and check if it goes negative, which would indicate an invalid sequence.
- Finally, we check if the balance is zero (indicating all brackets are matched) and if we have found at least one nested structure before returning the result. 

This approach ensures that we efficiently determine if the string contains a valid nested subsequence of brackets.

To solve the problem of determining whether a string of square brackets contains a valid subsequence where at least one bracket is nested, we need to follow a systematic approach. Let's break down the requirements and the steps needed to implement the solution.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Understanding Nested Brackets**: 
   - A bracket is considered nested if it is enclosed within another pair of brackets. For example, in the string `[[]]`, the inner `[]` is nested within the outer `[]`.
   - We need to check if there exists at least one pair of nested brackets in the input string.

2. **Valid Bracket Sequences**:
   - A valid bracket sequence must have matching opening and closing brackets. For every `[` there should be a corresponding `]`.
   - The sequence must also maintain the order, meaning we can't close a bracket before it has been opened.

3. **Approach**:
   - We can use a stack-like approach to keep track of the brackets. 
   - As we iterate through the string:
     - For every `[`, we push it onto a stack.
     - For every `]`, we check if there is a corresponding `[`. If there is, we pop from the stack.
     - If we ever encounter a `]` without a matching `[`, the sequence is invalid.
   - To check for nesting, we can maintain a counter that tracks how many brackets are currently open. If we ever have more than one bracket open (i.e., the counter is greater than 1), we have found a nested structure.

4. **Implementation**:
   - We will define the function `is_nested` that takes a string as input.
   - We will use a counter to track the number of open brackets and a boolean flag to indicate if we have found nested brackets.

### Implementation

Now, let's implement the function based on the reasoning above.

```python
def is_nested(string):
    open_count = 0  # To count the number of open brackets
    nested = False   # To track if we have found nested brackets

    for char in string:
        if char == '[':
            open_count += 1
            # If we have more than one open bracket, we have nesting
            if open_count > 1:
                nested = True
        elif char == ']':
            if open_count == 0:
                # More closing brackets than opening brackets
                return False
            open_count -= 1

    # If we finish processing and there are still open brackets, it's invalid
    if open_count != 0:
        return False

    return nested

# Test cases
print(is_nested('[[]]'))  # ➞ True
print(is_nested('[]]]]]]][[[[[]'))  # ➞ False
print(is_nested('[][]'))  # ➞ False
print(is_nested('[]'))  # ➞ False
print(is_nested('[[][]]'))  # ➞ True
print(is_nested('[[]][['))  # ➞ True
```

### Explanation of the Code:
- We initialize `open_count` to keep track of the number of open brackets and `nested` to check if we have found any nested brackets.
- We loop through each character in the string:
  - If we encounter `[`, we increment `open_count`. If `open_count` exceeds 1, we set `nested` to `True`.
  - If we encounter `]`, we check if there are any unmatched opening brackets. If there are none, we return `False`. Otherwise, we decrement `open_count`.
- After processing the string, if `open_count` is not zero, it means there are unmatched opening brackets, so we return `False`.
- Finally, we return the value of `nested`, which indicates whether we found any nested brackets.

This implementation efficiently checks for nested brackets while ensuring the sequence is valid.
