To solve the problem of calculating the sum of squares of odd integers from a given list while ignoring negative numbers and non-integer values, we can break down the task into a series of logical steps:

### Step-by-Step Approach:

1. **Input Validation**: We need to ensure that we only consider integers that are non-negative. This means we will filter out any negative numbers and non-integer types from the list.

2. **Identifying Odd Numbers**: For the integers that remain after filtering, we need to check if they are odd. An integer is odd if it is not divisible by 2 (i.e., `number % 2 != 0`).

3. **Calculating Squares**: For each odd integer identified, we will calculate its square.

4. **Summing the Squares**: Finally, we will sum all the squares of the odd integers to get the desired result.

5. **Edge Cases**: We need to handle edge cases such as:
   - An empty list should return 0.
   - Lists with no valid odd integers should also return 0.

### Implementation:

Now, let's implement this logic in the `double_the_difference` function.

```python
def double_the_difference(lst):
    '''
    Given a list of numbers, return the sum of squares of the numbers
    in the list that are odd. Ignore numbers that are negative or not integers.
    
    double_the_difference([1, 3, 2, 0]) == 1 + 9 + 0 + 0 = 10
    double_the_difference([-1, -2, 0]) == 0
    double_the_difference([9, -2]) == 81
    double_the_difference([0]) == 0  
   
    If the input list is empty, return 0.
    '''
    
    # Initialize the sum of squares
    sum_of_squares = 0
    
    # Iterate through each number in the list
    for num in lst:
        # Check if the number is a non-negative integer
        if isinstance(num, int) and num >= 0:
            # Check if the number is odd
            if num % 2 != 0:
                # Add the square of the odd number to the sum
                sum_of_squares += num ** 2
    
    return sum_of_squares
```

### Explanation of the Code:

- We start by defining the function `double_the_difference` which takes a list `lst` as an argument.
- We initialize a variable `sum_of_squares` to 0 to keep track of the cumulative sum of squares of odd integers.
- We loop through each element in the list:
  - We check if the element is an integer and non-negative using `isinstance(num, int)` and `num >= 0`.
  - If the number passes these checks, we then check if it is odd using `num % 2 != 0`.
  - If it is odd, we calculate its square (`num ** 2`) and add it to `sum_of_squares`.
- Finally, we return the total `sum_of_squares`.

### Testing the Function:

We can test the function with the provided examples to ensure it behaves as expected:

```python
print(double_the_difference([1, 3, 2, 0]))  # Expected output: 10
print(double_the_difference([-1, -2, 0]))    # Expected output: 0
print(double_the_difference([9, -2]))         # Expected output: 81
print(double_the_difference([0]))              # Expected output: 0
print(double_the_difference([]))               # Expected output: 0
```

This implementation should correctly compute the desired results based on the problem statement.
