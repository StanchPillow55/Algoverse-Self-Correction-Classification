To solve the problem of encrypting a string by rotating the alphabet, we need to follow a systematic approach. Let's break down the requirements and the steps needed to implement the solution.

### Problem Breakdown

1. **Understanding the Rotation**: The problem states that each letter in the input string should be shifted down the alphabet by two multiplied by two places. This means each letter will be shifted by 4 positions in the alphabet. For example:
   - 'a' becomes 'e'
   - 'b' becomes 'f'
   - 'z' wraps around and becomes 'd'

2. **Handling the Alphabet**: Since the alphabet is circular, we need to ensure that when we reach the end of the alphabet (after 'z'), we wrap around back to the beginning (starting from 'a').

3. **Character Handling**: We need to consider only lowercase letters ('a' to 'z'). Any character outside this range should be ignored.

4. **Implementation Steps**:
   - Iterate through each character in the input string.
   - For each character, check if it is a lowercase letter.
   - If it is, calculate its new position by shifting it 4 places down the alphabet.
   - If the new position exceeds 'z', wrap around using modulo arithmetic.
   - Collect the transformed characters and join them to form the final encrypted string.

### Implementation

Now, let's implement the `encrypt` function based on the above reasoning.

```python
def encrypt(s):
    """Encrypts a string by rotating each letter down the alphabet by 4 positions."""
    encrypted_string = []
    
    for char in s:
        if 'a' <= char <= 'z':  # Check if the character is a lowercase letter
            # Calculate the new character after shifting by 4
            new_char = chr((ord(char) - ord('a') + 4) % 26 + ord('a'))
            encrypted_string.append(new_char)
    
    return ''.join(encrypted_string)

# Test cases
print(encrypt('hi'))          # Expected output: 'lm'
print(encrypt('asdfghjkl'))   # Expected output: 'ewhjklnop'
print(encrypt('gf'))          # Expected output: 'kj'
print(encrypt('et'))          # Expected output: 'ix'
```

### Explanation of the Code

1. **Initialization**: We start by creating an empty list `encrypted_string` to store the transformed characters.

2. **Loop through the input string**: We iterate over each character in the input string `s`.

3. **Character Check**: For each character, we check if it is a lowercase letter using the condition `'a' <= char <= 'z'`.

4. **Character Transformation**:
   - We use `ord(char)` to get the ASCII value of the character.
   - We subtract `ord('a')` to normalize it to a 0-based index (where 'a' is 0, 'b' is 1, ..., 'z' is 25).
   - We add 4 to this index and use modulo 26 to wrap around if necessary.
   - Finally, we convert it back to a character using `chr()` and append it to our list.

5. **Return the Result**: After processing all characters, we join the list into a single string and return it.

This implementation effectively handles the encryption as specified in the problem statement.
