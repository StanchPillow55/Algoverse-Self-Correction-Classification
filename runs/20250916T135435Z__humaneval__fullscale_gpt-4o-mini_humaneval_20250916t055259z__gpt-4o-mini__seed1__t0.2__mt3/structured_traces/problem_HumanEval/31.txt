turn 1
To determine if a number \( n \) is prime, we need to follow a systematic approach. A prime number is defined as a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. 

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Input**: 
   - The function will take a single integer \( n \).

2. **Basic Cases**:
   - If \( n \) is less than or equal to 1, it is not prime. This includes 0, 1, and negative numbers.
   - The smallest prime number is 2, which is also the only even prime number.

3. **Even Numbers**:
   - If \( n \) is greater than 2 and even, it cannot be prime (since it is divisible by 2).

4. **Checking for Divisibility**:
   - For odd numbers greater than 2, we need to check for factors from 3 up to the square root of \( n \). This is because if \( n \) can be factored into two factors \( a \) and \( b \) (i.e., \( n = a \times b \)), at least one of those factors must be less than or equal to \( \sqrt{n} \).
   - We can check for divisibility by iterating through odd numbers starting from 3 up to \( \sqrt{n} \).

5. **Returning the Result**:
   - If we find any divisor in the range, \( n \) is not prime. If we complete the checks without finding any divisors, \( n \) is prime.

### Implementation:

Now, let's implement the function based on the reasoning above.

```python
import math

def is_prime(n):
    """Return true if a given number is prime, and false otherwise.
    >>> is_prime(6)
    False
    >>> is_prime(101)
    True
    >>> is_prime(11)
    True
    >>> is_prime(13441)
    True
    >>> is_prime(61)
    True
    >>> is_prime(4)
    False
    >>> is_prime(1)
    False
    """
    # Check for numbers less than or equal to 1
    if n <= 1:
        return False
    # Check for the number 2
    if n == 2:
        return True
    # Check for even numbers greater than 2
    if n % 2 == 0:
        return False
    
    # Check for factors from 3 to sqrt(n)
    for i in range(3, int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1, 2):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    
    return True
```

### Explanation of the Code:
- We start by checking if \( n \) is less than or equal to 1, returning `False` if so.
- We handle the special case for 2, returning `True`.
- We then check if \( n \) is even and greater than 2, returning `False`.
- Finally, we loop through all odd numbers from 3 to \( \sqrt{n} \) and check if any of them divide \( n \) evenly. If we find such a divisor, we return `False`. If no divisors are found, we return `True`.

This implementation efficiently checks for primality and adheres to the mathematical properties of prime numbers.

To determine whether a number \( n \) is prime, we need to follow a systematic approach. A prime number is defined as a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. 

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Input and Output**:
   - The function `is_prime(n)` takes an integer \( n \) as input and returns `True` if \( n \) is a prime number and `False` otherwise.

2. **Identifying Edge Cases**:
   - Numbers less than 2 (i.e., 0 and 1) are not prime.
   - The smallest prime number is 2, which is also the only even prime number.

3. **Divisibility Check**:
   - For any number \( n \) greater than 2, we need to check if it can be divided evenly by any integer from 2 up to the square root of \( n \). This is because if \( n \) can be factored into two factors \( a \) and \( b \) (i.e., \( n = a \times b \)), at least one of those factors must be less than or equal to \( \sqrt{n} \).

4. **Optimization**:
   - We can skip even numbers greater than 2 since they are not prime. This means we can check for divisibility only with odd numbers starting from 3.

5. **Implementation**:
   - We will implement the function based on the above reasoning.

### Implementation:

Hereâ€™s how the function can be implemented in Python:

```python
def is_prime(n):
    """Return true if a given number is prime, and false otherwise.
    >>> is_prime(6)
    False
    >>> is_prime(101)
    True
    >>> is_prime(11)
    True
    >>> is_prime(13441)
    True
    >>> is_prime(61)
    True
    >>> is_prime(4)
    False
    >>> is_prime(1)
    False
    """
    # Check for numbers less than 2
    if n < 2:
        return False
    # Check for 2, which is prime
    if n == 2:
        return True
    # Check for even numbers greater than 2
    if n % 2 == 0:
        return False
    # Check for factors from 3 to sqrt(n)
    for i in range(3, int(n**0.5) + 1, 2):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True
```

### Explanation of the Code:
- We first check if \( n \) is less than 2, returning `False` if it is.
- We then check if \( n \) is 2, returning `True` since 2 is prime.
- Next, we check if \( n \) is even (and greater than 2), returning `False` if it is.
- Finally, we loop through all odd numbers starting from 3 up to the square root of \( n \). If \( n \) is divisible by any of these numbers, we return `False`. If we find no divisors, we return `True`.

This implementation efficiently checks for primality while minimizing unnecessary calculations.
