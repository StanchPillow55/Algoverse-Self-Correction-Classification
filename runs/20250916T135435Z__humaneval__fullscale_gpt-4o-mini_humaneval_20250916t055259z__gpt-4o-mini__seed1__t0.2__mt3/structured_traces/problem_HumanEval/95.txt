To solve the problem of checking whether all keys in a given dictionary are either all lowercase strings or all uppercase strings, we can break down the solution into a series of logical steps:

1. **Check for an Empty Dictionary**: The first condition we need to handle is whether the dictionary is empty. If it is, we should return `False` immediately.

2. **Iterate Through the Keys**: We will need to iterate through the keys of the dictionary to check their case. 

3. **Determine Case of Keys**: For each key, we will check:
   - If it is a string.
   - If it is in lowercase or uppercase.

4. **Track the Case**: We can maintain two flags:
   - One for tracking if we have seen any lowercase keys.
   - Another for tracking if we have seen any uppercase keys.

5. **Return the Result**: After iterating through all keys, we will check the flags:
   - If we have seen only lowercase keys, return `True`.
   - If we have seen only uppercase keys, return `True`.
   - If we have seen a mix of both or any non-string keys, return `False`.

Now, let's implement this logic in the function `check_dict_case`.

```python
def check_dict_case(input_dict):
    """
    Given a dictionary, return True if all keys are strings in lower 
    case or all keys are strings in upper case, else return False.
    The function should return False if the given dictionary is empty.
    """
    # Step 1: Check if the dictionary is empty
    if not input_dict:
        return False
    
    # Step 2: Initialize flags
    has_lower = False
    has_upper = False
    
    # Step 3: Iterate through the keys
    for key in input_dict.keys():
        # Check if the key is a string
        if not isinstance(key, str):
            return False
        
        # Check if the key is lowercase or uppercase
        if key.islower():
            has_lower = True
        elif key.isupper():
            has_upper = True
        
        # If both flags are true, we can return False early
        if has_lower and has_upper:
            return False
    
    # Step 4: Determine the result based on the flags
    return has_lower or has_upper

# Example test cases
print(check_dict_case({"a": "apple", "b": "banana"}))  # True
print(check_dict_case({"a": "apple", "A": "banana", "B": "banana"}))  # False
print(check_dict_case({"a": "apple", 8: "banana", "a": "apple"}))  # False
print(check_dict_case({"Name": "John", "Age": "36", "City": "Houston"}))  # False
print(check_dict_case({"STATE": "NC", "ZIP": "12345"}))  # True
```

### Explanation of the Implementation:
- We start by checking if the input dictionary is empty. If it is, we return `False`.
- We initialize two boolean flags, `has_lower` and `has_upper`, to track the presence of lowercase and uppercase keys.
- We then loop through each key in the dictionary:
  - If the key is not a string, we immediately return `False`.
  - We check if the key is lowercase or uppercase and update our flags accordingly.
  - If both flags are true at any point, we can conclude that the keys are mixed case and return `False`.
- Finally, we return `True` if either `has_lower` or `has_upper` is true, indicating that all keys are consistently in one case. 

This approach ensures that we efficiently check the conditions with a single pass through the dictionary keys.
