To solve the problem of finding the largest even integer in the range \([x, y]\), we need to follow a systematic approach. Let's break down the steps:

### Step 1: Understand the Range
The function takes two parameters, \(x\) and \(y\). We need to consider the range of numbers between \(x\) and \(y\) inclusive. Since the order of \(x\) and \(y\) is not guaranteed (i.e., \(x\) could be greater than \(y\)), we should first determine the actual range by identifying the minimum and maximum values.

### Step 2: Identify Even Numbers
An even number is any integer that is divisible by 2 (i.e., `number % 2 == 0`). We need to find the largest even number within the specified range.

### Step 3: Determine the Largest Even Number
To find the largest even number in the range:
1. Start from the maximum of \(x\) and \(y\).
2. Check if this number is even. If it is, return it.
3. If it is not even, subtract 1 to get the largest even number and check if it falls within the range.
4. If the adjusted number is still within the range, return it; otherwise, return -1.

### Step 4: Handle Edge Cases
- If \(x\) is greater than \(y\), we should return -1 immediately since there are no valid numbers in the range.
- If there are no even numbers in the range, we should also return -1.

### Implementation
Now, let's implement the function based on the above reasoning:

```python
def choose_num(x, y):
    """This function takes two positive numbers x and y and returns the
    biggest even integer number that is in the range [x, y] inclusive. If 
    there's no such number, then the function should return -1.
    """
    # Determine the minimum and maximum of x and y
    lower_bound = min(x, y)
    upper_bound = max(x, y)
    
    # Start checking from the upper bound
    if upper_bound % 2 == 0:
        largest_even = upper_bound
    else:
        largest_even = upper_bound - 1  # Move to the next lower even number
    
    # Check if the largest even number is within the range
    if largest_even >= lower_bound:
        return largest_even
    else:
        return -1  # No even number in the range

# Example test cases
print(choose_num(12, 15))  # Output: 14
print(choose_num(13, 12))  # Output: -1
```

### Explanation of the Code
1. We first determine the lower and upper bounds of the range using `min` and `max`.
2. We check if the upper bound is even. If it is, we set it as the largest even number. If not, we subtract 1 to get the largest even number.
3. Finally, we check if this largest even number is within the bounds. If it is, we return it; otherwise, we return -1.

This implementation efficiently finds the largest even number in the specified range while handling edge cases appropriately.

To solve the problem of finding the largest even integer within a given range [x, y], we need to follow a systematic approach. Let's break down the steps:

### Step 1: Understand the Input and Output
- The function `choose_num(x, y)` takes two positive integers `x` and `y`.
- The output should be the largest even integer in the inclusive range from `x` to `y`. If there are no even integers in that range, the function should return -1.

### Step 2: Determine the Range
- The range can be defined as starting from the minimum of `x` and `y` and ending at the maximum of `x` and `y`. This means we need to handle cases where `x` might be greater than `y`.

### Step 3: Identify Even Numbers
- An even number is defined as any integer that is divisible by 2 (i.e., `n % 2 == 0`).
- To find the largest even number in the range, we can start from the maximum of the two numbers and check downwards.

### Step 4: Implement the Logic
1. Determine the minimum and maximum of `x` and `y`.
2. Start from the maximum number and check if it is even.
3. If it is even, return it.
4. If it is not even, decrement by 1 and check again.
5. Continue this until we reach the minimum number.
6. If we exhaust the range without finding an even number, return -1.

### Step 5: Edge Cases
- If `x` and `y` are the same and that number is odd, the function should return -1.
- If the range is very small (like 1 or 2), we should ensure our logic still holds.

### Implementation
Now, let's implement the function based on the above reasoning:

```python
def choose_num(x, y):
    """This function takes two positive numbers x and y and returns the
    biggest even integer number that is in the range [x, y] inclusive. If 
    there's no such number, then the function should return -1.
    """
    # Determine the minimum and maximum of x and y
    start = min(x, y)
    end = max(x, y)
    
    # Start from the end and check for the largest even number
    for num in range(end, start - 1, -1):
        if num % 2 == 0:  # Check if the number is even
            return num  # Return the first even number found
    
    return -1  # If no even number is found, return -1

# Example test cases
print(choose_num(12, 15))  # Output: 14
print(choose_num(13, 12))  # Output: -1
```

### Explanation of the Code
- We first determine the `start` and `end` of the range using `min` and `max`.
- We then iterate from `end` down to `start` (inclusive).
- For each number, we check if it is even. If we find an even number, we return it immediately.
- If the loop completes without finding an even number, we return -1.

This implementation is efficient and straightforward, ensuring that we cover all possible scenarios as outlined in our reasoning.

To solve the problem of finding the largest even integer in the range [x, y], we need to follow a systematic approach. Let's break down the steps:

### Step 1: Understand the Input and Output
- The function `choose_num` takes two parameters, `x` and `y`, which are both positive integers.
- The output should be the largest even integer within the inclusive range from `x` to `y`. If no even integer exists in that range, the function should return -1.

### Step 2: Determine the Range
- We need to consider the range from `x` to `y`. However, since the order of `x` and `y` is not guaranteed (i.e., `x` could be greater than `y`), we should determine the minimum and maximum of the two values.
- Let's denote `start` as the minimum of `x` and `y`, and `end` as the maximum.

### Step 3: Find the Largest Even Number
- To find the largest even number in the range, we can start from `end` and check if it is even:
  - If `end` is even, it is our candidate.
  - If `end` is odd, we can check `end - 1` (the next lower number) to see if it is even.
- We need to ensure that this candidate is still within the range defined by `start` and `end`.

### Step 4: Handle Edge Cases
- If `start` is greater than `end`, it means the range is invalid, and we should return -1.
- If the largest even number we find is less than `start`, we should also return -1.

### Step 5: Implementation
Now that we have a clear plan, we can implement the function.

```python
def choose_num(x, y):
    """This function takes two positive numbers x and y and returns the
    biggest even integer number that is in the range [x, y] inclusive. If 
    there's no such number, then the function should return -1.
    """
    # Determine the start and end of the range
    start = min(x, y)
    end = max(x, y)
    
    # Check if the end is even or odd
    if end % 2 == 0:
        largest_even = end
    else:
        largest_even = end - 1  # The largest even number less than end
    
    # Check if the largest even number is within the range
    if largest_even >= start:
        return largest_even
    else:
        return -1  # No even number in the range

# Example test cases
print(choose_num(12, 15))  # Output: 14
print(choose_num(13, 12))  # Output: -1
```

### Explanation of the Code:
1. We first determine the `start` and `end` of the range using `min` and `max`.
2. We check if `end` is even. If it is, we set `largest_even` to `end`. If it is odd, we set `largest_even` to `end - 1`.
3. Finally, we check if `largest_even` is greater than or equal to `start`. If it is, we return it; otherwise, we return -1.

This implementation efficiently finds the largest even number in the specified range and handles edge cases appropriately.
