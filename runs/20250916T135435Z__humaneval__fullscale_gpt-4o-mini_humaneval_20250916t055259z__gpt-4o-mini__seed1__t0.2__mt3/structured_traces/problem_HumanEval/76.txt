To solve the problem of determining if a number \( x \) is a simple power of \( n \), we need to check if there exists an integer \( k \) such that \( n^k = x \). This means we are looking for integer values of \( k \) that satisfy this equation.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Inputs**:
   - We have two inputs: \( x \) (the number we want to check) and \( n \) (the base).
   - We need to handle special cases, particularly when \( n \) is 1 or 0.

2. **Special Cases**:
   - If \( n = 1 \): The only power of 1 is 1 itself (i.e., \( 1^k = 1 \) for any \( k \)). Therefore, if \( x \) is not 1, the function should return `False`.
   - If \( n = 0 \): The only power of 0 is 0 itself (i.e., \( 0^k = 0 \) for \( k > 0 \)). If \( x \) is not 0, the function should return `False`.

3. **General Case**:
   - For \( n > 1 \): We can use a loop to calculate powers of \( n \) starting from \( n^0 \) (which is 1) and continue until \( n^k \) exceeds \( x \).
   - If at any point \( n^k \) equals \( x \), we return `True`.
   - If we exceed \( x \) without finding a match, we return `False`.

4. **Efficiency Considerations**:
   - The loop will run until \( n^k \) exceeds \( x \), which is efficient since the growth of powers is exponential.

### Implementation:

Now, let's implement the function based on the reasoning above.

```python
def is_simple_power(x, n):
    """Check if x is a simple power of n."""
    
    # Handle special cases
    if n == 1:
        return x == 1  # 1^k = 1 for any k, so only x = 1 is valid
    if n == 0:
        return x == 0  # 0^k = 0 for k > 0, so only x = 0 is valid
    
    # General case for n > 1
    power = 1  # Start with n^0
    k = 0
    
    while power < x:
        k += 1
        power = n ** k  # Calculate n^k
        
    return power == x  # Check if we found a match

# Example test cases
print(is_simple_power(1, 4))  # True
print(is_simple_power(2, 2))  # True
print(is_simple_power(8, 2))  # True
print(is_simple_power(3, 2))  # False
print(is_simple_power(3, 1))  # False
print(is_simple_power(5, 3))  # False
```

### Explanation of the Code:
- We first check for special cases where \( n \) is 1 or 0.
- For \( n > 1 \), we initialize `power` to 1 (which is \( n^0 \)) and use a while loop to calculate successive powers of \( n \).
- If we find a power that matches \( x \), we return `True`. If we exceed \( x \) without finding a match, we return `False`.

This implementation is straightforward and efficiently checks if \( x \) is a simple power of \( n \).
