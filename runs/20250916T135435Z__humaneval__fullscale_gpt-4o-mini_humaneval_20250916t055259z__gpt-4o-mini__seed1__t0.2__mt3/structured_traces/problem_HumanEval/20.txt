To solve the problem of finding the two closest elements in a list of numbers, we can break down the task into a series of logical steps. Here’s how I would approach it:

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Input and Output**:
   - We are given a list of floating-point numbers with at least two elements.
   - Our goal is to find two numbers in this list that are closest to each other and return them in a tuple, ordered from the smaller to the larger number.

2. **Identifying the Closest Elements**:
   - To find the closest elements, we need to calculate the absolute difference between every pair of numbers in the list.
   - We will keep track of the minimum difference found and the corresponding pair of numbers.

3. **Iterating Through the List**:
   - We can use a nested loop to compare each number with every other number in the list. This will allow us to calculate the differences.
   - Since we want to return the smaller number first, we will sort the pair before storing it.

4. **Handling Edge Cases**:
   - The problem guarantees that the list has at least two elements, so we don’t need to handle cases with fewer elements.
   - We should also consider cases where the closest numbers are the same (e.g., two identical numbers).

5. **Efficiency Consideration**:
   - The algorithm will have a time complexity of O(n^2) due to the nested loops, which is acceptable for reasonably sized lists.

### Implementation:

Now, let's implement the function based on the reasoning above.

```python
from typing import List, Tuple

def find_closest_elements(numbers: List[float]) -> Tuple[float, float]:
    # Initialize variables to track the minimum difference and the closest pair
    min_diff = float('inf')
    closest_pair = (0.0, 0.0)
    
    # Iterate through each pair of numbers
    for i in range(len(numbers)):
        for j in range(i + 1, len(numbers)):
            # Calculate the absolute difference
            diff = abs(numbers[i] - numbers[j])
            # If this difference is smaller than the current minimum, update
            if diff < min_diff:
                min_diff = diff
                # Store the pair in sorted order
                closest_pair = (min(numbers[i], numbers[j]), max(numbers[i], numbers[j]))
    
    return closest_pair

# Example usage
print(find_closest_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.2]))  # Output: (2.0, 2.2)
print(find_closest_elements([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 2.0]))  # Output: (2.0, 2.0)
```

### Explanation of the Code:
- We initialize `min_diff` to infinity to ensure any found difference will be smaller.
- We use two nested loops to compare each unique pair of numbers.
- For each pair, we calculate the absolute difference and check if it is smaller than the current minimum difference.
- If it is, we update `min_diff` and store the pair in sorted order.
- Finally, we return the closest pair.

This implementation effectively finds the two closest numbers in the list and returns them in the required format.
