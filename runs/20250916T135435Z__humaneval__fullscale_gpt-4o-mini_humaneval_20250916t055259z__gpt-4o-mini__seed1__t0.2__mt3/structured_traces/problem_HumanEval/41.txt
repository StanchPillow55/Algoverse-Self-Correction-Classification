To solve the problem of counting the number of collisions between two sets of cars moving in opposite directions, we need to analyze the situation step by step.

### Problem Breakdown:

1. **Understanding the Movement**:
   - We have `n` cars moving from left to right (let's call them set A).
   - We have another `n` cars moving from right to left (let's call them set B).
   - Each car moves at the same speed.

2. **Collision Definition**:
   - A collision occurs when a car from set A (moving right) meets a car from set B (moving left).
   - Since the cars are infinitely sturdy, they do not stop or change direction upon collision.

3. **Collision Count**:
   - Given that all cars are moving at the same speed, every car from set A will eventually collide with every car from set B.
   - Therefore, if there are `n` cars in set A and `n` cars in set B, the total number of collisions can be calculated as:
     \[
     \text{Total Collisions} = n \times n = n^2
     \]

### Implementation Plan:

1. Define the function `car_race_collision` that takes an integer `n` as input.
2. Calculate the number of collisions using the formula \( n^2 \).
3. Return the calculated number of collisions.

### Implementation:

Now, let's implement the function based on the reasoning above.

```python
def car_race_collision(n: int) -> int:
    """
    Calculate the number of collisions between two sets of cars moving in opposite directions.
    
    Args:
    n (int): The number of cars in each set.
    
    Returns:
    int: The total number of collisions.
    """
    # Each car from set A collides with each car from set B
    total_collisions = n * n
    return total_collisions
```

### Explanation of the Code:

- The function `car_race_collision` takes an integer `n` as input, which represents the number of cars in each direction.
- It computes the total number of collisions by squaring `n` (i.e., `n * n`).
- Finally, it returns the computed value.

### Example Usage:

If we call `car_race_collision(3)`, it will return `9`, indicating that there are 9 collisions (3 cars from set A colliding with 3 cars from set B). 

This implementation is efficient and runs in constant time \( O(1) \) since it only involves a single multiplication operation.
