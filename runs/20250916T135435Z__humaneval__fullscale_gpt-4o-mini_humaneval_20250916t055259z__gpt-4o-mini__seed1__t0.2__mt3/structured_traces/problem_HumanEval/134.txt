To solve the problem of checking if the last character of a given string is an alphabetical character and is not part of a word, we need to break down the requirements step by step.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Input**: The input is a string (`txt`). We need to analyze the last character of this string.

2. **Identifying the Last Character**: We can access the last character of a string in Python using indexing. Specifically, `txt[-1]` gives us the last character, but we need to ensure that the string is not empty before doing this.

3. **Checking for Spaces**: A "word" is defined as a group of characters separated by spaces. Therefore, if the last character is a space, it means that there is no word ending at that position. We need to ignore spaces when checking the last character.

4. **Finding the Last Non-Space Character**: We can iterate backward through the string to find the last non-space character. This will help us determine if that character is an alphabetical character.

5. **Checking if the Character is Alphabetical**: We can use the string method `.isalpha()` to check if a character is an alphabetical character.

6. **Returning the Result**: Finally, we return `True` if the last non-space character is alphabetical, and `False` otherwise.

### Implementation:

Now, let's implement the function based on the above reasoning.

```python
def check_if_last_char_is_a_letter(txt):
    '''
    Create a function that returns True if the last character
    of a given string is an alphabetical character and is not
    a part of a word, and False otherwise.
    Note: "word" is a group of characters separated by space.

    Examples:
    check_if_last_char_is_a_letter("apple pie") ➞ False
    check_if_last_char_is_a_letter("apple pi e") ➞ True
    check_if_last_char_is_a_letter("apple pi e ") ➞ False
    check_if_last_char_is_a_letter("") ➞ False 
    '''
    
    # Strip any trailing spaces from the string
    txt = txt.rstrip()
    
    # Check if the string is empty after stripping spaces
    if not txt:
        return False
    
    # Find the last character that is not a space
    for char in reversed(txt):
        if char != ' ':
            # Check if this character is alphabetical
            return char.isalpha()
    
    # If we exit the loop without finding a non-space character
    return False

# Testing the function with provided examples
print(check_if_last_char_is_a_letter("apple pie"))  # ➞ False
print(check_if_last_char_is_a_letter("apple pi e"))  # ➞ True
print(check_if_last_char_is_a_letter("apple pi e "))  # ➞ False
print(check_if_last_char_is_a_letter(""))  # ➞ False 
```

### Explanation of the Code:

1. **Stripping Spaces**: We use `txt.rstrip()` to remove any trailing spaces from the string. This ensures that we don't mistakenly consider a space as the last character.

2. **Empty Check**: We check if the string is empty after stripping. If it is, we return `False`.

3. **Reversed Iteration**: We iterate through the string in reverse to find the last non-space character. 

4. **Alphabetical Check**: For the first non-space character we encounter, we check if it is alphabetical using `char.isalpha()`.

5. **Return Value**: If we find an alphabetical character, we return `True`. If we finish the loop without finding any, we return `False`.

This implementation efficiently checks the conditions specified in the problem statement and handles edge cases like empty strings and strings with only spaces.

To solve the problem of checking if the last character of a given string is an alphabetical character and is not part of a word, we need to break down the requirements step by step.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Input**: The input is a string (`txt`). We need to analyze the last character of this string.

2. **Identifying the Last Character**: We can obtain the last character of the string using indexing. In Python, `txt[-1]` gives us the last character of the string.

3. **Checking for Alphabetical Character**: We need to check if this last character is an alphabetical character. In Python, we can use the `isalpha()` method, which returns `True` if the character is a letter (a-z or A-Z).

4. **Determining if it is Part of a Word**: A "word" is defined as a group of characters separated by spaces. To check if the last character is part of a word, we need to ensure that it is not preceded by a space. This means we should check if the character before the last character (i.e., `txt[-2]` if it exists) is a space.

5. **Handling Edge Cases**: We need to consider:
   - An empty string, which should return `False`.
   - A string that ends with spaces, which should also return `False` since the last character would be a space.

### Implementation Plan:

1. Check if the string is empty. If it is, return `False`.
2. Trim any trailing spaces from the string to simplify the checks.
3. Check if the last character is alphabetical using `isalpha()`.
4. Check if the last character is not preceded by a space (i.e., the character before it should not be a space).
5. Return `True` if both conditions are satisfied; otherwise, return `False`.

### Implementation:

Now, let's implement the function based on the above reasoning.

```python
def check_if_last_char_is_a_letter(txt):
    '''
    Create a function that returns True if the last character
    of a given string is an alphabetical character and is not
    a part of a word, and False otherwise.
    Note: "word" is a group of characters separated by space.

    Examples:
    check_if_last_char_is_a_letter("apple pie") ➞ False
    check_if_last_char_is_a_letter("apple pi e") ➞ True
    check_if_last_char_is_a_letter("apple pi e ") ➞ False
    check_if_last_char_is_a_letter("") ➞ False 
    '''
    
    # Step 1: Check if the string is empty
    if not txt:
        return False
    
    # Step 2: Trim trailing spaces
    txt = txt.rstrip()
    
    # Step 3: Check if the last character is alphabetical
    last_char = txt[-1]
    if not last_char.isalpha():
        return False
    
    # Step 4: Check if the last character is not part of a word
    if len(txt) > 1 and txt[-2] == ' ':
        return False
    
    # If both conditions are satisfied, return True
    return True

# Testing the function with the provided examples
print(check_if_last_char_is_a_letter("apple pie"))  # ➞ False
print(check_if_last_char_is_a_letter("apple pi e"))  # ➞ True
print(check_if_last_char_is_a_letter("apple pi e "))  # ➞ False
print(check_if_last_char_is_a_letter(""))  # ➞ False
```

### Explanation of the Code:
- The function first checks if the input string is empty and returns `False` if it is.
- It then trims any trailing spaces to ensure that we are only working with the relevant characters.
- The last character is checked to see if it is alphabetical. If it is not, the function returns `False`.
- Finally, it checks if the character before the last character is a space. If it is, the last character is considered part of a word, and the function returns `False`.
- If both checks pass, the function returns `True`. 

This implementation effectively meets the requirements outlined in the problem statement.

To solve the problem of determining whether the last character of a given string is an alphabetical character and not part of a word, we need to break down the requirements step by step.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Input**: The function takes a single string input, `txt`.

2. **Identifying the Last Character**: We need to find the last character of the string. However, we must also consider any trailing spaces that may exist. If the string is empty, we should return `False`.

3. **Checking for Trailing Spaces**: We can use the `rstrip()` method to remove any trailing whitespace from the string. This will help us isolate the last meaningful character.

4. **Determining if the Last Character is a Letter**: After trimming the string, we need to check if the last character is an alphabetical character. In Python, we can use the `isalpha()` method for this purpose.

5. **Checking if the Character is Part of a Word**: According to the problem, we need to ensure that the last character is not part of a word. This means that it should be preceded by a space or be the very first character in the string (if it exists). 

6. **Final Decision**: Based on the checks above, we will return `True` if the last character is an alphabetical character and is not part of a word; otherwise, we will return `False`.

### Implementation:

Now that we have a clear understanding of the requirements, we can implement the function.

```python
def check_if_last_char_is_a_letter(txt):
    '''
    Create a function that returns True if the last character
    of a given string is an alphabetical character and is not
    a part of a word, and False otherwise.
    Note: "word" is a group of characters separated by space.

    Examples:
    check_if_last_char_is_a_letter("apple pie") ➞ False
    check_if_last_char_is_a_letter("apple pi e") ➞ True
    check_if_last_char_is_a_letter("apple pi e ") ➞ False
    check_if_last_char_is_a_letter("") ➞ False 
    '''
    
    # Step 1: Trim the string to remove trailing spaces
    trimmed_txt = txt.rstrip()
    
    # Step 2: Check if the trimmed string is empty
    if not trimmed_txt:
        return False
    
    # Step 3: Get the last character
    last_char = trimmed_txt[-1]
    
    # Step 4: Check if the last character is an alphabetical character
    if not last_char.isalpha():
        return False
    
    # Step 5: Check if the last character is preceded by a space or is the first character
    # We can check if the last character is the first character or if the character before it is a space
    if len(trimmed_txt) == 1 or trimmed_txt[-2] == ' ':
        return True
    
    return False
```

### Explanation of the Code:

- We first trim the input string to remove any trailing spaces.
- We check if the trimmed string is empty; if it is, we return `False`.
- We retrieve the last character of the trimmed string.
- We check if this character is an alphabetical character using `isalpha()`.
- Finally, we check if this character is either the first character of the string or is preceded by a space. If either condition is met, we return `True`; otherwise, we return `False`.

This implementation effectively meets the requirements outlined in the problem statement.
