To determine if a string is "happy," we need to follow a few logical steps based on the problem's requirements. Let's break down the problem step by step:

### Step 1: Understand the Requirements
- A string is considered "happy" if:
  1. Its length is at least 3.
  2. Every group of 3 consecutive characters in the string are distinct.

### Step 2: Analyze the Conditions
- **Length Check**: If the string's length is less than 3, we can immediately return `False`.
- **Consecutive Characters Check**: We need to iterate through the string and check every substring of length 3 to ensure that all characters in that substring are distinct.

### Step 3: Implementation Plan
1. First, check if the length of the string is less than 3. If so, return `False`.
2. Loop through the string from the start to the third-to-last character (since we are checking groups of three).
3. For each position, extract the substring of the next three characters.
4. Check if all characters in this substring are distinct. This can be done by converting the substring to a set and comparing its length to 3 (since there should be 3 unique characters).
5. If any substring fails the distinct check, return `False`.
6. If all checks pass, return `True`.

### Step 4: Implement the Function
Now, let's implement the function based on the above reasoning.

```python
def is_happy(s):
    """Check if the string s is happy."""
    # Step 1: Check if the length is at least 3
    if len(s) < 3:
        return False
    
    # Step 2: Check every group of 3 consecutive characters
    for i in range(len(s) - 2):
        # Extract the substring of the next three characters
        substring = s[i:i + 3]
        
        # Check if all characters in the substring are distinct
        if len(set(substring)) != 3:
            return False
    
    # If all checks passed, the string is happy
    return True

# Test cases
print(is_happy("a"))      # False
print(is_happy("aa"))     # False
print(is_happy("abcd"))   # True
print(is_happy("aabb"))   # False
print(is_happy("adb"))    # True
print(is_happy("xyy"))    # False
```

### Explanation of the Implementation
- We start by checking the length of the string. If it's less than 3, we return `False`.
- We then loop through the string using a range that allows us to access three characters at a time.
- For each substring of three characters, we convert it to a set to check for distinctness. If the length of the set is not equal to 3, it means there are duplicate characters in that substring, and we return `False`.
- If we finish the loop without returning `False`, we conclude that the string is happy and return `True`.

This implementation is efficient and straightforward, adhering to the problem's requirements.
