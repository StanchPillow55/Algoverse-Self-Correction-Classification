To solve the problem of finding the maximum `k` numbers from an array `arr` and returning them in sorted order, we can break down the solution into a series of logical steps:

### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Understanding the Input and Output**:
   - We have an array of integers `arr` and a positive integer `k`.
   - Our goal is to extract the `k` largest numbers from `arr` and return them as a sorted list.

2. **Constraints**:
   - The length of `arr` can range from 1 to 1000.
   - The values in `arr` can range from -1000 to 1000.
   - `k` can be between 0 and the length of `arr`.

3. **Approach**:
   - **Sorting**: One straightforward approach is to sort the array in descending order and then take the first `k` elements. After that, we can sort these `k` elements in ascending order before returning them.
   - **Using a Heap**: Alternatively, we could use a min-heap to efficiently find the `k` largest elements, but given the constraints, sorting might be simpler and more intuitive.

4. **Implementation Steps**:
   - Sort the array in descending order.
   - Slice the first `k` elements from the sorted array.
   - Sort this slice in ascending order to meet the output requirement.
   - Return the sorted slice.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - If `k` is 0, we should return an empty list.
   - If `k` is equal to the length of `arr`, we should return the entire array sorted.

### Implementation

Now, let's implement the solution based on the reasoning above:

```python
def maximum(arr, k):
    """
    Given an array arr of integers and a positive integer k, return a sorted list 
    of length k with the maximum k numbers in arr.
    """
    if k == 0:
        return []  # Return an empty list if k is 0
    
    # Step 1: Sort the array in descending order
    sorted_arr = sorted(arr, reverse=True)
    
    # Step 2: Take the first k elements
    max_k_elements = sorted_arr[:k]
    
    # Step 3: Sort these k elements in ascending order
    result = sorted(max_k_elements)
    
    return result

# Example usage:
print(maximum([-3, -4, 5], 3))  # Output: [-4, -3, 5]
print(maximum([4, -4, 4], 2))   # Output: [4, 4]
print(maximum([-3, 2, 1, 2, -1, -2, 1], 1))  # Output: [2]
```

### Explanation of the Code:
- The function first checks if `k` is 0 and returns an empty list if true.
- It sorts the input array `arr` in descending order to prioritize larger numbers.
- It then slices the first `k` elements from this sorted array.
- Finally, it sorts these `k` elements in ascending order before returning them.

This solution is efficient and straightforward, leveraging Python's built-in sorting capabilities to achieve the desired result.
