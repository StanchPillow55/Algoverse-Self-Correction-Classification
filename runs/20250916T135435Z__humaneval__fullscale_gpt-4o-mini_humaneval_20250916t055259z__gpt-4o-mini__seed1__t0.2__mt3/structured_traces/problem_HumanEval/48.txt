To determine if a given string is a palindrome, we need to understand what a palindrome is. A palindrome is a string that reads the same forwards and backwards. For example, "aba" and "aaaaa" are palindromes, while "zbcd" is not.

### Step-by-Step Approach:

1. **Understanding Input and Output**:
   - The function `is_palindrome` takes a single string input `text`.
   - It returns a boolean value: `True` if the string is a palindrome and `False` otherwise.

2. **Handling Edge Cases**:
   - An empty string (`''`) is considered a palindrome because there are no characters to contradict the definition.
   - We should also consider strings with mixed cases or spaces, but based on the examples provided, we will assume the input is a simple string without spaces or special characters.

3. **Reversing the String**:
   - To check if a string is a palindrome, we can reverse the string and compare it to the original string.
   - In Python, we can reverse a string using slicing: `text[::-1]`.

4. **Comparison**:
   - If the reversed string is equal to the original string, then it is a palindrome.

5. **Implementation**:
   - We will implement the function according to the steps outlined above.

### Implementation:

Here is the complete function definition based on the reasoning:

```python
def is_palindrome(text: str) -> bool:
    """
    Checks if given string is a palindrome.
    
    A string is considered a palindrome if it reads the same forwards and backwards.
    
    >>> is_palindrome('')
    True
    >>> is_palindrome('aba')
    True
    >>> is_palindrome('aaaaa')
    True
    >>> is_palindrome('zbcd')
    False
    """
    # Reverse the string and compare it with the original
    return text == text[::-1]
```

### Explanation of the Code:
- The function `is_palindrome` takes a string `text` as input.
- It checks if `text` is equal to its reverse (`text[::-1]`).
- If they are equal, it returns `True`, indicating that the string is a palindrome; otherwise, it returns `False`.

### Testing the Function:
The provided docstring includes examples that can be used to test the function. You can run these tests in a Python environment to verify that the function behaves as expected. 

This implementation is efficient and straightforward, leveraging Python's string manipulation capabilities to achieve the desired result.
