To solve the problem of creating a histogram from a string of space-separated lowercase letters, we need to follow a systematic approach. Hereâ€™s how I would break down the problem:

### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Input Understanding**: The input is a string of lowercase letters separated by spaces. We need to count the occurrences of each letter.

2. **Output Requirements**: The output should be a dictionary where:
   - The keys are the letters with the highest frequency.
   - The values are the counts of those letters.
   - If multiple letters have the same highest count, all of them should be included in the dictionary.

3. **Handling Edge Cases**: 
   - An empty string should return an empty dictionary.
   - Strings with unique letters should return each letter with a count of 1.

4. **Plan**:
   - Split the input string into a list of letters.
   - Use a dictionary to count occurrences of each letter.
   - Determine the maximum count from the dictionary.
   - Create a new dictionary to store letters that have this maximum count.

5. **Implementation**: We will implement the function based on the above plan.

### Implementation

Now, let's implement the function `histogram` based on our reasoning:

```python
def histogram(test):
    """Given a string representing a space separated lowercase letters, return a dictionary
    of the letter with the most repetition and containing the corresponding count.
    If several letters have the same occurrence, return all of them.
    
    Example:
    histogram('a b c') == {'a': 1, 'b': 1, 'c': 1}
    histogram('a b b a') == {'a': 2, 'b': 2}
    histogram('a b c a b') == {'a': 2, 'b': 2}
    histogram('b b b b a') == {'b': 4}
    histogram('') == {}
    """
    
    # Step 1: Handle empty input
    if not test:
        return {}
    
    # Step 2: Split the input string into a list of letters
    letters = test.split()
    
    # Step 3: Count occurrences using a dictionary
    count_dict = {}
    for letter in letters:
        if letter in count_dict:
            count_dict[letter] += 1
        else:
            count_dict[letter] = 1
    
    # Step 4: Find the maximum count
    max_count = max(count_dict.values())
    
    # Step 5: Create a new dictionary for letters with the maximum count
    result = {letter: count for letter, count in count_dict.items() if count == max_count}
    
    return result
```

### Explanation of the Code

- **Line 2-3**: The function starts by checking if the input string is empty. If it is, we return an empty dictionary.
- **Line 6**: We split the input string into a list of letters using `split()`, which handles the spaces.
- **Lines 9-14**: We iterate through the list of letters and populate a dictionary (`count_dict`) with the counts of each letter.
- **Line 17**: We find the maximum count of occurrences using the `max()` function on the dictionary values.
- **Lines 20-21**: We create a new dictionary (`result`) that includes only those letters that have the maximum count.
- **Line 23**: Finally, we return the result.

This implementation efficiently counts the occurrences of letters and constructs the desired output format.
