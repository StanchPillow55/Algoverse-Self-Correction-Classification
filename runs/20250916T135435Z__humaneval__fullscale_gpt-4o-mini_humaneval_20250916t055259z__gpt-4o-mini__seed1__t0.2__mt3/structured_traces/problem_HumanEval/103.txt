To solve the problem of calculating the rounded average of integers from `n` to `m`, we need to follow a systematic approach. Let's break down the steps:

1. **Input Validation**: First, we need to check if `n` is greater than `m`. If it is, we should return -1 as specified in the problem statement.

2. **Calculate the Average**:
   - The integers from `n` to `m` can be represented as a sequence. The average of a sequence of numbers can be calculated using the formula:
     \[
     \text{average} = \frac{\text{sum of the numbers}}{\text{count of the numbers}}
     \]
   - The sum of integers from `n` to `m` can be calculated using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series:
     \[
     \text{sum} = \frac{(m - n + 1) \times (n + m)}{2}
     \]
   - The count of integers from `n` to `m` is simply \( m - n + 1 \).

3. **Rounding**: After calculating the average, we need to round it to the nearest integer. In Python, we can use the built-in `round()` function for this.

4. **Convert to Binary**: Finally, we need to convert the rounded average to binary format. In Python, we can use the `bin()` function, which returns a string representation of the binary number prefixed with "0b".

5. **Return the Result**: We will return the binary representation of the rounded average.

Now, let's implement the function based on this reasoning:

```python
def rounded_avg(n, m):
    """Compute the rounded average of integers from n to m and convert to binary."""
    # Step 1: Input validation
    if n > m:
        return -1
    
    # Step 2: Calculate the sum and count of integers from n to m
    count = m - n + 1
    total_sum = (count * (n + m)) // 2  # Using integer division for sum
    
    # Step 3: Calculate the average
    average = total_sum / count
    
    # Step 4: Round the average
    rounded_average = round(average)
    
    # Step 5: Convert to binary
    binary_result = bin(rounded_average)
    
    return binary_result

# Example test cases
print(rounded_avg(1, 5))  # Expected output: "0b11"
print(rounded_avg(7, 5))  # Expected output: -1
print(rounded_avg(10, 20))  # Expected output: "0b1111"
print(rounded_avg(20, 33))  # Expected output: "0b11010"
```

### Explanation of the Code:
- We start by checking if `n` is greater than `m` and return -1 if true.
- We calculate the count of integers and their total sum using the arithmetic series formula.
- We compute the average and round it to the nearest integer.
- Finally, we convert the rounded average to binary and return it.

This implementation should work correctly for all valid inputs as specified in the problem statement.
