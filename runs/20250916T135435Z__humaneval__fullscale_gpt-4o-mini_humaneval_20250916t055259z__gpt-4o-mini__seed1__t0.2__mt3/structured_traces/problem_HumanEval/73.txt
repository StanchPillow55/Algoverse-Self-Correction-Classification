To solve the problem of finding the minimum number of changes required to make an array palindromic, we need to understand the properties of a palindrome. A palindromic array reads the same forwards and backwards. This means that for an array `arr`, the first element must equal the last element, the second element must equal the second-to-last element, and so on.

### Step-by-Step Approach:

1. **Identify Pairs**: For an array of length `n`, we can compare elements in pairs:
   - Compare `arr[0]` with `arr[n-1]`
   - Compare `arr[1]` with `arr[n-2]`
   - Continue this until we reach the middle of the array.

2. **Count Mismatches**: For each pair of elements that do not match, we will need to change one of the elements to make them equal. Each mismatch represents a necessary change.

3. **Calculate Changes**: The total number of changes required to make the array palindromic will be equal to the number of mismatched pairs.

4. **Iterate Until Middle**: We only need to iterate through half of the array (up to `n // 2`) since each comparison involves two elements.

### Implementation:

Now, let's implement this logic in the `smallest_change` function.

```python
def smallest_change(arr):
    """
    Given an array arr of integers, find the minimum number of elements that
    need to be changed to make the array palindromic.
    """
    n = len(arr)
    changes = 0
    
    # Compare elements from the start and end moving towards the center
    for i in range(n // 2):
        if arr[i] != arr[n - 1 - i]:
            changes += 1  # Increment change count for each mismatch
    
    return changes

# Test cases
print(smallest_change([1, 2, 3, 5, 4, 7, 9, 6]))  # Expected output: 4
print(smallest_change([1, 2, 3, 4, 3, 2, 2]))     # Expected output: 1
print(smallest_change([1, 2, 3, 2, 1]))            # Expected output: 0
```

### Explanation of the Code:
- We first determine the length of the array `n`.
- We initialize a counter `changes` to zero, which will keep track of the number of changes needed.
- We loop from `0` to `n // 2`, comparing the elements at index `i` and `n - 1 - i`.
- If the elements do not match, we increment the `changes` counter.
- Finally, we return the total number of changes.

This approach is efficient with a time complexity of O(n/2), which simplifies to O(n), where `n` is the length of the array. The space complexity is O(1) since we are using a constant amount of extra space.
