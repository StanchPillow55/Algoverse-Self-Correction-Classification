To solve the problem of implementing the `add` function, we need to follow a structured approach. Let's break down the steps involved:

### Step 1: Understand the Requirements
The function `add` is supposed to take two integers, `x` and `y`, as input and return their sum. The function should also include a docstring that describes its purpose and provides examples of how it works.

### Step 2: Analyze the Docstring
The provided docstring includes two examples:
- `add(2, 3)` should return `5`
- `add(5, 7)` should return `12`

These examples clarify that the function should perform a straightforward addition operation.

### Step 3: Define the Function
We need to define the function `add` to take two parameters, `x` and `y`, and return their sum. The function signature indicates that both parameters are integers.

### Step 4: Implement the Function
The implementation will be simple:
1. Define the function with the parameters `x` and `y`.
2. Use the `+` operator to compute the sum of `x` and `y`.
3. Return the result.

### Step 5: Write the Complete Function Definition
We will include the docstring as specified, and then implement the function.

Here is the complete implementation:

```python
def add(x: int, y: int) -> int:
    """Add two numbers x and y.
    
    >>> add(2, 3)
    5
    >>> add(5, 7)
    12
    """
    return x + y
```

### Explanation of the Implementation
- The function is defined with the name `add` and takes two parameters, `x` and `y`, both of which are expected to be integers.
- The return type is specified as `int`, indicating that the function will return an integer.
- The body of the function simply computes the sum of `x` and `y` using the `+` operator and returns the result.

### Conclusion
The function is now complete and adheres to the requirements specified in the problem statement. It is straightforward and efficient, performing the addition operation in constant time. The docstring also provides clear examples of how the function should behave.
