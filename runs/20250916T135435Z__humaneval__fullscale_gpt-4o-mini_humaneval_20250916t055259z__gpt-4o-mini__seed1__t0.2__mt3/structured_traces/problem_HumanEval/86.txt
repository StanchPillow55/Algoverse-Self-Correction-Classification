To solve the problem of creating an "anti-shuffle" function, we need to follow a systematic approach. Let's break down the requirements and the steps needed to implement the solution.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Understanding the Input and Output**:
   - The input is a string `s` which may contain words separated by spaces and possibly punctuation.
   - The output should be a string where each word's characters are sorted in ascending order based on their ASCII values, while maintaining the original order of the words and spaces.

2. **Identifying Words and Spaces**:
   - We need to split the string into words while preserving the spaces. This means we should not lose any spaces between words or at the beginning/end of the string.

3. **Sorting Characters**:
   - For each word, we will sort the characters. This can be done using Python's built-in `sorted()` function, which sorts characters based on their ASCII values.

4. **Reconstructing the String**:
   - After sorting the characters of each word, we will join them back together with spaces to form the final output string.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - We should consider edge cases such as:
     - An empty string should return an empty string.
     - Strings with only spaces should return the same string.
     - Strings with punctuation should maintain the punctuation in their original positions.

### Implementation

Now, let's implement the function based on the above reasoning.

```python
def anti_shuffle(s):
    """
    Write a function that takes a string and returns an ordered version of it.
    Ordered version of string, is a string where all words (separated by space)
    are replaced by a new word where all the characters arranged in
    ascending order based on ascii value.
    Note: You should keep the order of words and blank spaces in the sentence.
    """
    # Split the string into words while preserving spaces
    words = s.split(' ')
    
    # Sort characters in each word
    sorted_words = [''.join(sorted(word)) for word in words]
    
    # Join the sorted words back with spaces
    result = ' '.join(sorted_words)
    
    return result

# Test cases
print(anti_shuffle('Hi'))  # Expected: 'Hi'
print(anti_shuffle('hello'))  # Expected: 'ehllo'
print(anti_shuffle('Hello World!!!'))  # Expected: 'Hello !!!Wdlor'
print(anti_shuffle('   '))  # Expected: '   ' (preserving spaces)
print(anti_shuffle('a b c'))  # Expected: 'a b c' (single characters)
```

### Explanation of the Code

- We start by splitting the input string `s` using `split(' ')`, which keeps the spaces intact by splitting on spaces.
- We then use a list comprehension to sort each word. The `sorted(word)` function sorts the characters of the word, and `''.join(...)` combines them back into a string.
- Finally, we join the sorted words back together with a space using `' '.join(sorted_words)` and return the result.

This implementation effectively meets the requirements of the problem while maintaining the order of words and spaces.
