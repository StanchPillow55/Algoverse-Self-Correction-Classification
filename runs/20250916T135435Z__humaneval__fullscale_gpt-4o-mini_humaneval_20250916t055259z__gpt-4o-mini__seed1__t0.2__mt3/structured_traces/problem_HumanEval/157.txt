To determine whether three given lengths can form a right-angled triangle, we can utilize the Pythagorean theorem. The theorem states that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the longest side) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides. 

### Step-by-Step Approach:

1. **Identify the longest side**: Since we need to determine which side is the hypotenuse, we first need to identify the longest side among the three given lengths.

2. **Sort the sides**: We can sort the three sides to easily identify the longest side and the other two sides. This will help us avoid manually comparing the sides.

3. **Apply the Pythagorean theorem**: Once we have the sides sorted, we can apply the Pythagorean theorem:
   - Let the sides be \( x \), \( y \), and \( z \) such that \( z \) is the longest side.
   - We check if \( z^2 = x^2 + y^2 \).

4. **Return the result**: If the condition holds true, we return `True`, indicating that the sides can form a right-angled triangle. Otherwise, we return `False`.

### Implementation:

Now, let's implement the function based on the above reasoning.

```python
def right_angle_triangle(a, b, c):
    '''
    Given the lengths of the three sides of a triangle. Return True if the three
    sides form a right-angled triangle, False otherwise.
    A right-angled triangle is a triangle in which one angle is right angle or 
    90 degree.
    Example:
    right_angle_triangle(3, 4, 5) == True
    right_angle_triangle(1, 2, 3) == False
    '''
    # Step 1: Sort the sides
    sides = sorted([a, b, c])
    
    # Step 2: Assign the sides to variables
    x, y, z = sides  # x and y are the shorter sides, z is the longest side
    
    # Step 3: Check the Pythagorean theorem condition
    return z**2 == x**2 + y**2

# Example test cases
print(right_angle_triangle(3, 4, 5))  # Expected output: True
print(right_angle_triangle(1, 2, 3))  # Expected output: False
```

### Explanation of the Code:
- We first sort the sides using `sorted()`, which gives us a list of the sides in ascending order.
- We then unpack the sorted list into three variables: `x`, `y`, and `z`, where `z` is the longest side.
- Finally, we check if the square of the longest side (`z**2`) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides (`x**2 + y**2`). If they are equal, we return `True`, indicating that the sides can form a right-angled triangle; otherwise, we return `False`. 

This implementation is efficient and straightforward, leveraging the properties of right-angled triangles effectively.
