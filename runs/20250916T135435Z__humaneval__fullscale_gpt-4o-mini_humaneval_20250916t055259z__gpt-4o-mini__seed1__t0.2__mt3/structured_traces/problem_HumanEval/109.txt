To solve the problem of determining whether we can sort an array in non-decreasing order by performing right shift operations, we need to analyze the properties of the array and the effect of the right shift operation.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Understanding Right Shift Operation**:
   - A right shift operation moves the last element of the array to the front and shifts all other elements one position to the right. For example, if we have an array `[3, 4, 5, 1, 2]`, performing one right shift results in `[2, 3, 4, 5, 1]`.

2. **Identifying Sorted Order**:
   - The goal is to determine if we can rearrange the array into a sorted order (non-decreasing) through these shifts. 

3. **Key Observations**:
   - If we can sort the array by right shifts, it implies that there exists a "pivot" point in the array where the sorted order can be achieved by wrapping around.
   - Specifically, if we can find a point in the array where the sequence of numbers transitions from a higher number to a lower number (i.e., a drop), this drop should occur only once for the array to be sortable by shifts.

4. **Implementation Steps**:
   - Count how many times the array transitions from a higher number to a lower number. This can be done by iterating through the array and checking adjacent elements.
   - If there are more than one such transitions, it is impossible to sort the array through right shifts.
   - If there are zero transitions, the array is already sorted.
   - If there is exactly one transition, it indicates that the array can be sorted by right shifts.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - An empty array should return `True` since it is trivially sorted.

### Implementation:

Now that we have a clear understanding of the problem, we can implement the solution in Python.

```python
def move_one_ball(arr):
    """Determine if the array can be sorted by right shifts."""
    if not arr:  # If the array is empty, return True
        return True
    
    n = len(arr)
    count_drop = 0
    
    for i in range(n):
        # Check if the current element is greater than the next element
        if arr[i] > arr[(i + 1) % n]:  # Use modulo to wrap around
            count_drop += 1
            
    # We can have at most one drop to be able to sort the array by shifts
    return count_drop <= 1

# Example test cases
print(move_one_ball([3, 4, 5, 1, 2]))  # True
print(move_one_ball([3, 5, 4, 1, 2]))  # False
```

### Explanation of the Code:
- We first check if the array is empty and return `True` if it is.
- We initialize a counter `count_drop` to count the number of times we find a drop in the array.
- We loop through the array and check each element against the next one, using modulo to wrap around to the start of the array.
- Finally, we check if the count of drops is less than or equal to one, which indicates that the array can be sorted through right shifts. If so, we return `True`; otherwise, we return `False`.
