To solve the problem of converting the sum of the digits of a given integer \( N \) into its binary representation, we can break down the task into a series of clear steps:

### Step-by-Step Approach

1. **Extract the Digits**: We need to extract each digit from the integer \( N \). This can be done by converting the integer to a string and iterating over each character, converting it back to an integer.

2. **Sum the Digits**: After extracting the digits, we will sum them up to get a total.

3. **Convert to Binary**: Once we have the total sum of the digits, we need to convert this sum into its binary representation. In Python, this can be done using the built-in `bin()` function, which returns a string that starts with '0b'. We will need to strip off the '0b' prefix.

4. **Return the Result**: Finally, we will return the binary representation as a string.

### Implementation

Now, let's implement the function based on the above reasoning:

```python
def solve(N):
    """Given a positive integer N, return the total sum of its digits in binary.
    
    Example
        For N = 1000, the sum of digits will be 1 the output should be "1".
        For N = 150, the sum of digits will be 6 the output should be "110".
        For N = 147, the sum of digits will be 12 the output should be "1100".
    
    Variables:
        @N integer
             Constraints: 0 ≤ N ≤ 10000.
    Output:
         a string of binary number
    """
    
    # Step 1: Convert N to string and extract digits
    digits = [int(digit) for digit in str(N)]
    
    # Step 2: Sum the digits
    total_sum = sum(digits)
    
    # Step 3: Convert the sum to binary and strip the '0b' prefix
    binary_representation = bin(total_sum)[2:]
    
    # Step 4: Return the binary representation
    return binary_representation
```

### Explanation of the Code

- **Line 1-2**: We define the function `solve` that takes an integer \( N \).
- **Line 5**: We convert \( N \) to a string to iterate over each character, converting each character back to an integer and creating a list of digits.
- **Line 8**: We calculate the sum of the digits using the built-in `sum()` function.
- **Line 11**: We convert the total sum to binary using `bin()`, and we slice the string to remove the '0b' prefix.
- **Line 14**: Finally, we return the binary string.

### Testing the Function

We can test the function with the provided examples to ensure it works correctly:

```python
print(solve(1000))  # Output: "1"
print(solve(150))   # Output: "110"
print(solve(147))   # Output: "1100"
```

This implementation is efficient and straightforward, adhering to the constraints provided in the problem statement.
