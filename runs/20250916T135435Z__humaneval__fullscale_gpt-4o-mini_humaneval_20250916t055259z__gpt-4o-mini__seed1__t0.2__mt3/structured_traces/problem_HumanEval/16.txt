To solve the problem of counting distinct characters in a string regardless of case, we can break down the solution into a series of logical steps:

### Step 1: Understand the Problem
We need to count how many unique characters are present in the input string, treating uppercase and lowercase letters as the same. For example, the string "xyzXYZ" should be counted as having 3 distinct characters: 'x', 'y', and 'z'.

### Step 2: Normalize the Case
To ensure that we treat characters case-insensitively, we can convert the entire string to either lowercase or uppercase. This way, 'A' and 'a' will be considered the same character.

### Step 3: Identify Distinct Characters
To find distinct characters, we can utilize a data structure that inherently manages uniqueness. A set in Python is perfect for this purpose because it automatically handles duplicates.

### Step 4: Count the Distinct Characters
Once we have a set of characters from the normalized string, we can simply return the size of the set, which will give us the count of distinct characters.

### Step 5: Implement the Function
Now that we have a clear plan, we can implement the function `count_distinct_characters`.

Hereâ€™s the complete function definition:

```python
def count_distinct_characters(string: str) -> int:
    """ Given a string, find out how many distinct characters (regardless of case) does it consist of
    >>> count_distinct_characters('xyzXYZ')
    3
    >>> count_distinct_characters('Jerry')
    4
    """
    # Normalize the string to lowercase
    normalized_string = string.lower()
    
    # Create a set of characters from the normalized string
    distinct_characters = set(normalized_string)
    
    # Return the number of distinct characters
    return len(distinct_characters)

# Example usage
print(count_distinct_characters('xyzXYZ'))  # Output: 3
print(count_distinct_characters('Jerry'))    # Output: 4
```

### Explanation of the Code:
1. **Normalization**: We convert the input string to lowercase using `string.lower()`.
2. **Set Creation**: We create a set from the normalized string, which automatically filters out duplicate characters.
3. **Count Distinct Characters**: We use `len()` to get the number of unique characters in the set and return this value.

### Testing the Function
The provided docstring includes examples that can be used to verify the correctness of the function. We can run these examples to ensure the implementation behaves as expected. 

This approach is efficient and straightforward, leveraging Python's built-in capabilities to handle strings and sets effectively.
