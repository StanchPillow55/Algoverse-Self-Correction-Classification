To solve the problem of generating a sorted list of odd numbers from the Collatz sequence of a given positive integer \( n \), we can follow these steps:

### Step-by-Step Reasoning

1. **Understanding the Collatz Sequence**:
   - The sequence starts with a positive integer \( n \).
   - If the current number is even, the next number is obtained by dividing it by 2.
   - If the current number is odd, the next number is calculated as \( 3 \times \text{current} + 1 \).
   - This process continues until we reach 1.

2. **Collecting Odd Numbers**:
   - As we generate the Collatz sequence, we need to check each number to see if it is odd.
   - If it is odd, we will add it to a list.

3. **Sorting the List**:
   - Once we have collected all the odd numbers from the sequence, we will sort this list in increasing order before returning it.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The smallest input \( n = 1 \) should return a list containing just [1].

### Implementation Plan

- Create a function `get_odd_collatz(n)` that:
  - Initializes an empty list to store odd numbers.
  - Uses a loop to generate the Collatz sequence until reaching 1.
  - Checks if each number in the sequence is odd and adds it to the list if it is.
  - Finally, sorts the list of odd numbers and returns it.

### Implementation

Now, let's implement the function based on the above reasoning:

```python
def get_odd_collatz(n):
    """
    Given a positive integer n, return a sorted list that has the odd numbers in collatz sequence.
    """
    odd_numbers = []  # List to store odd numbers in the Collatz sequence
    
    # Generate the Collatz sequence
    while n != 1:
        if n % 2 == 1:  # Check if n is odd
            odd_numbers.append(n)
        n = n // 2 if n % 2 == 0 else 3 * n + 1  # Update n according to Collatz rules
    
    # Add the last number (which is 1)
    odd_numbers.append(1)  # 1 is always part of the sequence
    
    # Sort the list of odd numbers
    odd_numbers.sort()
    
    return odd_numbers

# Example usage
print(get_odd_collatz(5))  # Output: [1, 5]
```

### Explanation of the Code

- We start by initializing an empty list `odd_numbers` to store the odd numbers found in the Collatz sequence.
- We use a `while` loop to continue generating the sequence until \( n \) becomes 1.
- Inside the loop, we check if \( n \) is odd using the modulus operator (`n % 2 == 1`). If it is, we append it to our list.
- We then update \( n \) according to the Collatz rules.
- After the loop, we append 1 to the list since it is always part of the sequence.
- Finally, we sort the list of odd numbers and return it.

This implementation efficiently generates the required output while adhering to the Collatz sequence rules.
