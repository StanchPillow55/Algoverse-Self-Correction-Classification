To solve the problem of generating all prefixes of a given string, we need to understand what a prefix is. A prefix of a string is any substring that starts from the beginning of the string and extends to any point within it. For example, the prefixes of the string "abc" are:

- "a" (the first character)
- "ab" (the first two characters)
- "abc" (the entire string)

### Step-by-Step Approach:

1. **Understanding the Input and Output**:
   - Input: A single string (e.g., "abc").
   - Output: A list of all prefixes of the input string, starting from the shortest to the longest.

2. **Identifying the Length of the String**:
   - We need to determine the length of the input string to know how many prefixes we need to generate.

3. **Generating Prefixes**:
   - We can use a loop to iterate through the indices of the string from 1 to the length of the string (inclusive). For each index `i`, we can take the substring from the start of the string up to index `i`.

4. **Storing the Prefixes**:
   - We will store each prefix in a list, which we will return at the end of the function.

5. **Implementation**:
   - We will define the function `all_prefixes` that takes a string as input and returns a list of prefixes.

### Implementation:

Now, let's implement the function based on the reasoning above.

```python
from typing import List

def all_prefixes(string: str) -> List[str]:
    """ Return list of all prefixes from shortest to longest of the input string
    >>> all_prefixes('abc')
    ['a', 'ab', 'abc']
    """
    prefixes = []  # Initialize an empty list to store prefixes
    for i in range(1, len(string) + 1):  # Loop from 1 to length of string
        prefixes.append(string[:i])  # Append the substring from start to i
    return prefixes  # Return the list of prefixes
```

### Explanation of the Code:

- We import `List` from the `typing` module to specify the return type of the function.
- We define the function `all_prefixes` which takes a single string argument.
- We initialize an empty list called `prefixes` to hold the prefixes.
- We use a `for` loop that iterates from `1` to `len(string) + 1`. This ensures that we include the entire string as the last prefix.
- Inside the loop, we use slicing (`string[:i]`) to get the prefix from the start of the string up to the current index `i` and append it to the `prefixes` list.
- Finally, we return the list of prefixes.

### Testing the Function:

We can test the function using the provided example and other test cases to ensure it works correctly.

```python
# Test cases
print(all_prefixes('abc'))  # Expected: ['a', 'ab', 'abc']
print(all_prefixes(''))     # Expected: []
print(all_prefixes('a'))    # Expected: ['a']
print(all_prefixes('hello')) # Expected: ['h', 'he', 'hel', 'hell', 'hello']
```

This implementation is efficient and straightforward, providing the desired output as specified in the problem statement.
