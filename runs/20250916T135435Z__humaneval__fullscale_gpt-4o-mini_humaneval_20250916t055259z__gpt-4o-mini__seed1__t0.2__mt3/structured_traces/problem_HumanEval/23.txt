To solve the problem of creating a function `strlen` that returns the length of a given string, we can break down the task into a few clear steps:

### Step 1: Understand the Requirements
The function `strlen` should:
- Take a single argument, which is a string.
- Return an integer that represents the length of that string.
- Handle edge cases, such as an empty string.

### Step 2: Analyze the Examples
The provided examples in the docstring give us a clear idea of the expected behavior:
- `strlen('')` should return `0` because there are no characters in an empty string.
- `strlen('abc')` should return `3` because there are three characters in the string "abc".

### Step 3: Identify the Built-in Functionality
Python provides a built-in function `len()` that can be used to determine the length of a string. This function is efficient and handles all edge cases, including empty strings.

### Step 4: Implement the Function
Given that we can leverage the built-in `len()` function, our implementation will be straightforward. We will define the function `strlen`, call `len()` on the input string, and return the result.

### Step 5: Write the Function
Now, let's implement the function according to our plan.

```python
def strlen(string: str) -> int:
    """ Return length of given string
    >>> strlen('')
    0
    >>> strlen('abc')
    3
    """
    return len(string)
```

### Step 6: Testing the Function
To ensure that our function works correctly, we can run the provided examples as tests. In a real-world scenario, we would also want to test additional cases, such as strings with spaces, special characters, or very long strings, but the provided examples are sufficient for our current implementation.

### Conclusion
The function `strlen` is now implemented. It uses the built-in `len()` function to return the length of the input string, and it adheres to the expected behavior as described in the docstring. 

Here is the complete function definition again:

```python
def strlen(string: str) -> int:
    """ Return length of given string
    >>> strlen('')
    0
    >>> strlen('abc')
    3
    """
    return len(string)
```
PASS: All tests passed
