To solve the problem of calculating the area of a triangle given its three sides, we need to follow a systematic approach. Here’s how we can break down the problem:

### Step 1: Validate the Triangle
Before calculating the area, we need to ensure that the three sides provided can indeed form a triangle. The triangle inequality theorem states that for three sides \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) to form a valid triangle, the following conditions must be satisfied:
1. \(a + b > c\)
2. \(a + c > b\)
3. \(b + c > a\)

If any of these conditions fail, we should return -1, indicating that the sides do not form a valid triangle.

### Step 2: Calculate the Area
If the sides are valid, we can calculate the area using Heron's formula. Heron's formula states that the area \(A\) of a triangle with sides \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) can be calculated as follows:
1. Calculate the semi-perimeter \(s\):
   \[
   s = \frac{a + b + c}{2}
   \]
2. Then, the area \(A\) can be calculated using:
   \[
   A = \sqrt{s \cdot (s - a) \cdot (s - b) \cdot (s - c)}
   \]

### Step 3: Round the Result
Finally, we need to round the area to two decimal places before returning it.

### Implementation
Now that we have a clear plan, we can implement the function `triangle_area`:

```python
import math

def triangle_area(a, b, c):
    # Step 1: Validate the triangle
    if (a + b <= c) or (a + c <= b) or (b + c <= a):
        return -1
    
    # Step 2: Calculate the semi-perimeter
    s = (a + b + c) / 2
    
    # Step 3: Calculate the area using Heron's formula
    area = math.sqrt(s * (s - a) * (s - b) * (s - c))
    
    # Step 4: Return the area rounded to 2 decimal points
    return round(area, 2)

# Example test cases
print(triangle_area(3, 4, 5))  # Expected output: 6.00
print(triangle_area(1, 2, 10))  # Expected output: -1
```

### Explanation of the Code:
1. We import the `math` module to use the `sqrt` function for calculating the square root.
2. We define the function `triangle_area` that takes three parameters \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\).
3. We check the triangle inequality conditions. If any condition fails, we return -1.
4. If the triangle is valid, we compute the semi-perimeter \(s\).
5. We then calculate the area using Heron's formula.
6. Finally, we round the area to two decimal places and return it.

This implementation is efficient and adheres to the requirements outlined in the problem statement.

To solve the problem of calculating the area of a triangle given its three sides, we need to follow a systematic approach. Here’s how we can break down the problem:

### Step 1: Validate the Triangle
Before calculating the area, we need to ensure that the three sides provided can actually form a triangle. The triangle inequality theorem states that for any three sides \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\):
- \(a + b > c\)
- \(a + c > b\)
- \(b + c > a\)

If any of these conditions fail, the sides do not form a valid triangle, and we should return -1.

### Step 2: Calculate the Area
If the sides are valid, we can calculate the area of the triangle using Heron's formula. Heron's formula states that the area \(A\) of a triangle with sides \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) can be calculated as follows:
1. Compute the semi-perimeter \(s\):
   \[
   s = \frac{a + b + c}{2}
   \]
2. Then, the area \(A\) can be calculated using:
   \[
   A = \sqrt{s \cdot (s - a) \cdot (s - b) \cdot (s - c)}
   \]

### Step 3: Round the Result
Finally, we need to round the area to two decimal places before returning it.

### Implementation
Now, let's implement the function based on the above reasoning:

```python
import math

def triangle_area(a, b, c):
    # Step 1: Validate the triangle
    if (a + b <= c) or (a + c <= b) or (b + c <= a):
        return -1
    
    # Step 2: Calculate the semi-perimeter
    s = (a + b + c) / 2
    
    # Step 3: Calculate the area using Heron's formula
    area = math.sqrt(s * (s - a) * (s - b) * (s - c))
    
    # Step 4: Round the area to 2 decimal points
    return round(area, 2)

# Example usage
print(triangle_area(3, 4, 5))  # Expected output: 6.00
print(triangle_area(1, 2, 10))  # Expected output: -1
```

### Explanation of the Code:
1. **Validation**: The first `if` statement checks the triangle inequality conditions. If any condition fails, it returns -1.
2. **Semi-perimeter Calculation**: We calculate the semi-perimeter \(s\) by summing the sides and dividing by 2.
3. **Area Calculation**: We apply Heron's formula to compute the area.
4. **Rounding**: Finally, we round the area to two decimal places using the `round()` function before returning it.

This implementation effectively handles both the validation of the triangle and the calculation of its area, ensuring that we adhere to the requirements of the problem statement.

To solve the problem of calculating the area of a triangle given the lengths of its three sides, we need to follow a systematic approach. Here’s how we can break down the problem:

### Step 1: Validate the Triangle
Before calculating the area, we must ensure that the three sides can indeed form a valid triangle. The triangle inequality theorem states that for any triangle with sides of lengths \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\):
- \(a + b > c\)
- \(a + c > b\)
- \(b + c > a\)

If any of these conditions are not met, the sides do not form a valid triangle, and we should return -1.

### Step 2: Calculate the Area
If the sides are valid, we can calculate the area using Heron's formula. Heron's formula states that the area \(A\) of a triangle with sides \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) can be calculated as follows:
1. Compute the semi-perimeter \(s\):
   \[
   s = \frac{a + b + c}{2}
   \]
2. Then, the area \(A\) can be calculated using:
   \[
   A = \sqrt{s \cdot (s - a) \cdot (s - b) \cdot (s - c)}
   \]

### Step 3: Round the Result
Finally, we need to round the area to two decimal places before returning it.

### Implementation
Now, let's implement the function based on the reasoning above:

```python
import math

def triangle_area(a, b, c):
    '''
    Given the lengths of the three sides of a triangle. Return the area of
    the triangle rounded to 2 decimal points if the three sides form a valid triangle. 
    Otherwise return -1.
    '''
    # Step 1: Validate the triangle using the triangle inequality theorem
    if a + b <= c or a + c <= b or b + c <= a:
        return -1
    
    # Step 2: Calculate the semi-perimeter
    s = (a + b + c) / 2
    
    # Step 3: Calculate the area using Heron's formula
    area = math.sqrt(s * (s - a) * (s - b) * (s - c))
    
    # Step 4: Round the area to 2 decimal points
    return round(area, 2)

# Example test cases
print(triangle_area(3, 4, 5))  # Expected output: 6.00
print(triangle_area(1, 2, 10)) # Expected output: -1
```

### Explanation of the Code
1. We first check if the triangle inequality conditions are satisfied. If not, we return -1.
2. We calculate the semi-perimeter \(s\).
3. We then apply Heron's formula to compute the area.
4. Finally, we round the area to two decimal places and return it.

This implementation is efficient and straightforward, adhering to the requirements of the problem statement.
