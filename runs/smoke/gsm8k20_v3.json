      "question": "Frankie's parents let him have many pets. He has six more snakes than he has cats. He has one less parrot than cats. Six of his pets have four legs. He has 2 dogs. How many pets does he have in total?",

          "answer": "Let's define the number of each type of pet Frankie has:\n\n- Let \\( c \\) be the number of cats.\n- Since Frankie has six more snakes than cats, the number of snakes \\( s \\) can be expressed as:\n  \\[\n  s = c + 6\n  \\]\n- Frankie has one less parrot than cats, so the number of parrots \\( p \\) is:\n  \\[\n  p = c - 1\n  \\]\n- We know he has 2 dogs, so the number of dogs \\( d \\) is:\n  \\[\n  d = 2\n  \\]\n\nNow, we need to find the total number of pets Frankie has. The total number of pets \\( T \\) can be calculated as:\n\\[\nT = c + s + p + d\n\\]\n\nSubstituting the expressions for \\( s \\) and \\( p \\):\n\\[\nT = c + (c + 6) + (c - 1) + 2\n\\]\nSimplifying this:\n\\[\nT = c + c + 6 + c - 1 + 2\n\\]\n\\[\nT = 3c + 7\n\\]\n\nNext, we know that six of Frankie's pets have four legs. The pets that typically have four legs are cats, dogs, and snakes. Since dogs have four legs and each cat has four legs, we can express the total number of four-legged pets as:\n\\[\n\\text{Four-legged pets} = c + d + s\n\\]\nSubstituting \\( d = 2 \\) and \\( s = c + 6 \\):\n\\[\nc + 2 + (c + 6) = 6\n\\]\nThis simplifies to:\n\\[\n2c + 8 = 6\n\\]\nSubtracting 8 from both sides gives:\n\\[\n2c = 6 - 8\n\\]\n\\[\n2c = -2\n\\]\n\\[\nc = -1\n\\]\n\nSince the number of cats cannot be negative, we need to re-evaluate our understanding of the problem. Let's check the four-legged pets again:\n\nWe have:\n- Dogs: 2 (which have 4 legs)\n- Cats: \\( c \\) (each has 4 legs)\n- Snakes: \\( s = c + 6 \\) (which do not have 4 legs)\n\nThus, the equation for four-legged pets should be:\n\\[\nc + d = 6\n\\]\nSubstituting \\( d = 2 \\):\n\\[\nc + 2 = 6\n\\]\n\\[\nc = 4\n\\]\n\nNow we can find the number of each type of pet:\n- Cats \\( c = 4 \\)\n- Snakes \\( s = c + 6 = 4 + 6 = 10 \\)\n- Parrots \\( p = c - 1 = 4 - 1 = 3 \\)\n- Dogs \\( d = 2 \\)\n\nNow we can calculate the total number of pets:\n\\[\nT = c + s + p + d = 4 + 10 + 3 + 2 = 19\n\\]\n\nThus, the total number of pets Frankie has is:\n#### 19",
