Therefore, the total value of the cards he gives away is:\n   \\[\n   2 \\text{ cards} \\times 8 \\text{ dollars/card} = 16 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Value of the card received**: Nicky receives one card worth $21.\n\n3. **Calculating profit**: Profit is calculated as the value of what is received minus the value of what is given away. Thus, Nicky's profit from the trade is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Profit} = \\text{Value of card received} - \\text{Value of cards given away}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\text{Profit} = 21 \\text{ dollars} - 16 \\text{ dollars} = 5 \\text{ dollars}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, Nicky makes a profit of $5 from the trade.\n\n#### 5",

          "answer": "To find the average time each player gets in Patricia's highlight film, we first need to calculate the total time of video recorded for all players. \n\nThe times recorded for each player are as follows:\n- Point guard: 130 seconds\n- Shooting guard: 145 seconds\n- Small forward: 85 seconds\n- Power forward: 60 seconds\n- Center: 180 seconds\n\nNow, we will sum these times:\n\n\\[\n130 + 145 + 85 + 60 + 180 = 600 \\text{ seconds}\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to determine how many players there are. In this case, there are 5 players (point guard, shooting guard, small forward, power forward, and center).\n\nTo find the average time per player, we divide the total time by the number of players:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Average time per player} = \\frac{600 \\text{ seconds}}{5} = 120 \\text{ seconds}\n\\]\n\nNow, we need to convert this average time from seconds to minutes. Since there are 60 seconds in a minute, we divide by 60:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Average time in minutes} = \\frac{120 \\text{ seconds}}{60} = 2 \\text{ minutes}\n\\]\n\nThus, the average time each player gets in the highlight film is 2 minutes.\n\nFinal answer:\n\n#### 2",
