Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- There are 17 green jelly beans
- There are twice as many red jelly beans as green jelly beans
- The rest of the jelly beans are blue

Step 1: Calculate the number of red jelly beans.
Since there are twice as many red jelly beans as green jelly beans, we can calculate the number of red jelly beans as follows:
Number of red jelly beans = 2 Ã— 17 = 34

Step 2: Calculate the total number of green and red jelly beans.
Total number of green and red jelly beans = 17 + 34 = 51

Step 3: Calculate the number of blue jelly beans.
We know that the total number of jelly beans is 60, so we can subtract the number of green and red jelly beans from the total to find the number of blue jelly beans:
Number of blue jelly beans = Total jelly beans - (Green jelly beans + Red jelly beans)
Number of blue jelly beans = 60 - 51 = 9
