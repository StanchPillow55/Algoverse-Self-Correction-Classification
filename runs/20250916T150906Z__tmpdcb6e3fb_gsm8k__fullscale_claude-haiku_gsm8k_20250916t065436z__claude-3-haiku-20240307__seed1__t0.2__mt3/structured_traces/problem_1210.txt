Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Jolene and her friends filled up 10 packs of balloons
- Each pack has 30 balloons
- By the end of the afternoon, 12 balloons were left

To find the total number of balloons thrown, we need to:
1. Calculate the total number of balloons filled
2. Subtract the number of balloons left at the end

Step 1: Calculate the total number of balloons filled
Total balloons filled = Number of packs × Balloons per pack
Total balloons filled = 10 × 30 = 300 balloons

Step 2: Subtract the number of balloons left at the end
Balloons thrown = Total balloons filled - Balloons left
Balloons thrown = 300 - 12 = 288 balloons

Therefore, Jolene and her friends threw 288 balloons during their water balloon fight.
