Okay, let's break down this problem step by step and solve it completely.

Given information:
- On the first day, Conor found 50 people at the beach.
- On the second day, the number of people increased by 20 compared to the first day.
- On the third day, the total number of people increased to twice the number that were there on the second day.
- For the rest of the week, Conor saw an average of 60 people each day.

Step 1: Calculate the number of people at the beach on the second day.
Number of people on the second day = Number of people on the first day + 20
Number of people on the second day = 50 + 20 = 70 people

Step 2: Calculate the number of people at the beach on the third day.
Number of people on the third day = 2 × Number of people on the second day
Number of people on the third day = 2 × 70 = 140 people

Step 3: Calculate the total number of people Conor saw at the beach for the rest of the week.

Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- On the first day, there were 50 people at the beach.
- On the second day, there were 20 more people than on the first day.
- On the third day, the total number of people was twice the number from the second day.
- For the rest of the week, Conor saw an average of 60 people each day.

Step 1: Calculate the number of people on the second day.
Number of people on the second day = 50 + 20 = 70 people

Step 2: Calculate the number of people on the third day.
Number of people on the third day = 2 × 70 = 140 people

Step 3: Calculate the number of people for the rest of the week.
Number of days left in the week = 4 (Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday)
Average number of people per day for the rest of the week = 60
Total number of people for the rest of the week = 4 × 60 = 240 people

Step 4: Calculate the

Total for the first three days = 50 + 70 + 140 = 260 people

Step 4: Calculate the number of people for the remaining 4 days of the week.
Average number of people per day for the remaining 4 days = 60
