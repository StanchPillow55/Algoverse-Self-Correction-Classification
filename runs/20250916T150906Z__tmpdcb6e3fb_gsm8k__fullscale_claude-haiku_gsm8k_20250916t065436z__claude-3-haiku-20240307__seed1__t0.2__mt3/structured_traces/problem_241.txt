Okay, let's solve this math problem step-by-step.

Given information:
- Dolly has 2 books.
- Pandora has 1 book.
- Both Dolly and Pandora read each other's books as well as their own.

To find the total number of books they will collectively read, we need to add up the number of books each person will read.

Step 1: Calculate the number of books Dolly will read.
Dolly's own books = 2
Pandora's book = 1
Total books Dolly will read = 2 + 1 = 3

Step 2: Calculate the number of books Pandora will read.
Pandora's own book = 1
Dolly's books = 2
Total books Pandora will read = 1 + 2 = 3

Step 3: Calculate the total number of books they will collectively read.
Total books read = Dolly's books + Pandora's books
Total books read = 3 + 3 = 6

Therefore, Dolly and Pandora will collectively
