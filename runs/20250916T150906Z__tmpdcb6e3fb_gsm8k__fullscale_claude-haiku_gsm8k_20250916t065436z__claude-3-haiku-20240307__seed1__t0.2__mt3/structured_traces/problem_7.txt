To solve this problem, we need to calculate the time it takes to download the file, considering the interruption caused by the Windows update.

Given information:
- The file size is 200 GB.
- Carla's normal download speed is 2 GB/minute.
- The Windows update takes 20 minutes.

Step 1: Calculate the time it takes to download 40% of the file.
40% of 200 GB = 0.4 × 200 GB = 80 GB
Time to download 80 GB = 80 GB / 2 GB/minute = 40 minutes

Step 2: Calculate the time it takes to restart the download from the beginning.
Time to download the remaining 60% of the file = (200 GB - 80 GB) / 2 GB/minute = 60 GB / 2 GB/minute = 30 minutes

Step 3: Calculate the total time to download the file, including the interruption.
Total time = Time to download 40% + Time for Windows update + Time to download the remaining 60%
Total time = 40 minutes +

Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Carla is downloading a 200 GB file.
2. Normally, she can download 2 GB/minute.
3. 40% of the way through the download, Windows forces a restart to install updates, which takes 20 minutes.
4. Then Carla has to restart the download from the beginning.

Let's calculate the time it takes to download the file:

* Initial download speed: 2 GB/minute
* 40% of 200 GB = 0.4 * 200 GB = 80 GB
* Time to download 80 GB = 80 GB / 2 GB/minute = 40 minutes

Then, the Windows update takes 20 minutes.

After the restart, Carla has to download the full 200 GB file again.
* Time to download 200 GB = 200 GB / 2 GB/minute = 100 minutes

Total time:
* Initial download: 40 minutes
* Windows update: 20 minutes
* Restart download: 100 minutes

Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- The file size is 200 GB.
- Carla's normal download speed is 2 GB/minute.
- 40% of the way through the download, Windows forces a restart to install updates, which takes 20 minutes.
- Carla has to restart the download from the beginning.

Step 1: Calculate how much of the file was downloaded before the restart.
40% of 200 GB = 0.4 × 200 GB = 80 GB

Step 2: Calculate how long it took to download the 80 GB before the restart.
Time taken to download 80 GB = 80 GB / 2 GB/minute = 40 minutes

Step 3: Calculate the remaining file size to be downloaded after the restart.
Remaining file size = 200 GB - 80 GB = 120 GB

Step 4: Calculate the total time taken to download the remaining 120 GB.
Time taken to download 120 GB = 120 GB / 2 GB/minute = 60
