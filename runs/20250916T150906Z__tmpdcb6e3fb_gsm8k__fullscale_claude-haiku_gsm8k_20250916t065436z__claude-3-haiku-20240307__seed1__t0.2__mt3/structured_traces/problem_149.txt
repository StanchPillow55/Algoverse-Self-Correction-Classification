Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Charlie has three times as many Facebook friends as Dorothy.
- James has four times as many Facebook friends as Dorothy.
- Charlie has 12 Facebook friends.

Step 1: Find the number of Facebook friends Dorothy has.
Since Charlie has three times as many Facebook friends as Dorothy, we can use the following equation:
Charlie's friends = 3 × Dorothy's friends
12 = 3 × Dorothy's friends
Dorothy's friends = 12 / 3 = 4 Facebook friends

Step 2: Find the number of Facebook friends James has.
Since James has four times as many Facebook friends as Dorothy, we can use the following equation:
James' friends = 4 × Dorothy's friends
James' friends = 4 × 4 = 16 Facebook friends

Therefore, James has 16 Facebook friends.
