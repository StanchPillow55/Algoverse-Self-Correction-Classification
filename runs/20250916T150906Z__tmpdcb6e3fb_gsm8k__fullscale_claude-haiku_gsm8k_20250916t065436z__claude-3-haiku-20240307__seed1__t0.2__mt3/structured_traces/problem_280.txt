Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- Peter purchased 20 popsicles at $0.25 each.
- Peter purchased 4 ice cream bars at $0.50 each.

Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the popsicles.
Cost of 20 popsicles = 20 × $0.25 = $5.00

Step 2: Calculate the total cost of the ice cream bars.
Cost of 4 ice cream bars = 4 × $0.50 = $2.00

Step 3: Calculate the total amount Peter paid.
Total amount paid = Cost of popsicles + Cost of ice cream bars
Total amount paid = $5.00 + $2.00 = $7.00

Therefore, Peter paid a total of $7.00 for the popsicles and ice cream bars.

Final answer: Peter paid a total of $7.00.
