Okay, let's break down this problem step by step:

Given information:
- 90 single-use contacts come in 1 box
- The contacts will last Pete 45 days
- Each box costs $100.00
- The boxes are currently 10% off

Step 1: Calculate the number of pairs of contacts in 2 boxes.
Number of pairs of contacts in 1 box = 90 contacts / 2 contacts per pair = 45 pairs
Number of pairs of contacts in 2 boxes = 45 pairs × 2 boxes = 90 pairs

Step 2: Calculate the total cost of 2 boxes of contacts.
Original cost of 2 boxes = $100.00 × 2 = $200.00
Discount (10%) = $200.00 × 0.10 = $20.00
Total cost of 2 boxes = $200.00 - $20.00 = $180.00

Step 3: Calculate the cost per pair of contacts.
Cost per pair of contacts = Total cost of 2 boxes / Number of pairs of contacts in

Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- 90 single use contacts come in 1 box
- The contacts will last Pete 45 days
- Each box costs $100.00
- The boxes are currently 10% off

Step 1: Calculate the cost of 1 box of contacts after the 10% discount.
Original price of 1 box = $100.00
Discount = 10% of $100.00 = $10.00
Discounted price of 1 box = $100.00 - $10.00 = $90.00

Step 2: Calculate the number of pairs of contacts in 2 boxes.
Number of contacts in 1 box = 90
Number of contacts in 2 boxes = 2 × 90 = 180 contacts
Number of pairs of contacts in 2 boxes = 180 / 2 = 90 pairs

Step 3: Calculate the total cost of 2 boxes of contacts.
Total cost of 2 boxes = 2 × $90.00 = $180

Discounted price of 1 box = $100.00 - $10.00 = $90.00

Step 2: Calculate the number of days Pete can use the contacts from 2 boxes.
Contacts in 1 box = 90
Contacts in 2 boxes = 90 × 2 = 180
Days of use from 2 boxes = 45 days × 2 = 90 days

Step 3: Calculate the cost of 2 boxes of contacts.
Cost of 2 boxes = $90.00 × 2 = $180.00
