To solve this problem, we need to find the time it takes for Bernadette to get to the theater and then determine how much earlier she should leave compared to Wayne.

Given information:
- Bernadette wants to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne.
- The drive from Bernadette's apartment takes four times as long as the drive from Wayne's hotel.
- It takes Wayne 4 minutes to be driven to the theater.

Step 1: Find the time it takes for Bernadette to get to the theater.
Time for Wayne to get to the theater = 4 minutes
Time for Bernadette to get to the theater = 4 × 4 = 16 minutes

Step 2: Find the time difference between Bernadette's arrival and Wayne's arrival.
Bernadette wants to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne.
Time difference = 5 minutes

Step 3: Calculate how much earlier Bernadette should leave than Wayne.
Time for Bernadette to get to the theater = 16 minutes
Time for Wayne to get to the theater = 4 minutes
Time difference = 16

Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Bernadette wants to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne.
- The drive from Bernadette's apartment takes four times as long as the drive from Wayne's hotel.
- It takes Wayne 4 minutes to be driven to the theater.

Step 1: Calculate the time it takes Bernadette to get to the theater.
Since the drive from Bernadette's apartment takes four times as long as the drive from Wayne's hotel, and it takes Wayne 4 minutes to get to the theater, we can calculate the time it takes Bernadette as follows:
Time for Bernadette = 4 × 4 minutes = 16 minutes

Step 2: Calculate how much earlier Bernadette should leave than Wayne.
Bernadette wants to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne, so we need to add 5 minutes to the time it takes Wayne to get to the theater.
Time for Wayne = 4 minutes
Time for Bernadette to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne = 4 minutes + 5 minutes =

Therefore, Bernadette should leave
