To solve this problem, we need to find the number of students who are good at math.

Given information:
- There are 20 students in Miss Susan's class.
- 5 students are good at math only.
- 8 students perform well in English only.
- The rest are good at both math and English.

Let's represent the students in a Venn diagram:

Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1) We know that there are 20 students in Miss Susan's class.
2) 5 of them are good at math only.
3) 8 of them perform well in English only.
4) The rest are good at both math and English.

To find the number of students who are good at math, we need to add the students who are good at math only and the students who are good at both math and English.

The number of students who are good at both math and English is the total number of students (20) minus the number of students who are good at math only (5) and the number of students who are good at English only (8).

So, the number of students who are good at both math and English is:
20 - 5 - 8 = 7

Now, to find the total number of students who are good at math, we add the students who are good at math only (5) and the students who are good at both math and English (7):

5 + 7 = 12

Therefore, the final answer is that 12 students
