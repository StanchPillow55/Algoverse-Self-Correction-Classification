To solve this problem, we need to calculate the value of the boat after each year of depreciation.

Given information:
- Gary bought a boat for $9000.
- The first year, the boat depreciated by 30%.
- The second year, the boat depreciated by another 30%.
- The third year, the boat depreciated by 20%.

Step 1: Calculate the value of the boat after the first year.
Initial value of the boat = $9000
Depreciation in the first year = 30% of $9000 = 0.30 × $9000 = $2700
Value of the boat after the first year = $9000 - $2700 = $6300

Step 2: Calculate the value of the boat after the second year.
Value of the boat after the first year = $6300
Depreciation in the second year = 30% of $6300 = 0.30 × $6300 = $1890
Value of the boat after the second year = $6300 - $1890 = $4410

Step 3: Calculate the value of the boat after

Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- Gary bought a boat for $9000.
- In the first year, the boat depreciated by 30%.
- In the second year, the boat depreciated by another 30%.
- In the third year, the boat depreciated by 20%.

Step 1: Calculate the value of the boat after the first year.
Initial value of the boat = $9000
Depreciation in the first year = 30% of $9000 = 0.30 × $9000 = $2700
Value of the boat after the first year = $9000 - $2700 = $6300

Step 2: Calculate the value of the boat after the second year.
Value of the boat after the first year = $6300
Depreciation in the second year = 30% of $6300 = 0.30 × $6300 = $1890
Value of the boat after the second year = $6300 - $1890 = $4410

Step 3: Calculate the value of the boat after the third year.
