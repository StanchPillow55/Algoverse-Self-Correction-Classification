Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- Mulan has $40 initially.
- Her father gave her $100.
- She buys two pairs of jeans at $30 each.
- She buys a bag for $20.

Step 1: Calculate the total amount of money Mulan has after her father gave her $100.
Initial amount + Amount given by father = Total amount
$40 + $100 = $140

Step 2: Calculate the total cost of the two pairs of jeans and the bag.
Cost of two pairs of jeans = 2 Ã— $30 = $60
Cost of the bag = $20
Total cost = $60 + $20 = $80

Step 3: Calculate the amount of money Mulan has left.
Total amount - Total cost = Amount left
$140 - $80 = $60

Therefore, Mulan has $60 left.

Final answer: Mulan has $60 left.
