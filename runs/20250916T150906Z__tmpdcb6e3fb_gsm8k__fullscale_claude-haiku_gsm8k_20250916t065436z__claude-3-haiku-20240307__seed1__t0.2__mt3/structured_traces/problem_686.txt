Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Greta bakes 30 cookies.
- Celinda bakes twice as many cookies as Greta.
- Greta and Celinda eat 10 cookies while they are cooling.
- The remaining cookies are put in a box.

Step 1: Calculate the number of cookies Celinda baked.
Celinda baked twice as many cookies as Greta.
Celinda's cookies = 2 × Greta's cookies
Celinda's cookies = 2 × 30 = 60 cookies

Step 2: Calculate the total number of cookies baked.
Total cookies baked = Greta's cookies + Celinda's cookies
Total cookies baked = 30 + 60 = 90 cookies

Step 3: Calculate the number of cookies eaten while cooling.
Cookies eaten while cooling = 10

Step 4: Calculate the number of cookies put in the box.
Cookies put in the box = Total cookies baked - Cookies eaten while cooling
Cookies put in the box =

Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

1. Greta bakes 30 cookies.
2. Celinda bakes twice as many cookies as Greta, so Celinda bakes 2 x 30 = 60 cookies.
3. The total number of cookies baked is 30 + 60 = 90 cookies.
4. Greta and Celinda eat 10 cookies while they are cooling.
5. The remaining cookies are put in a box.
6. The number of cookies in the box is 90 - 10 = 80 cookies.

Therefore, the final answer is that there are 80 cookies in the box.
