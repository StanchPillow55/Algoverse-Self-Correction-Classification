Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- The fee to rent the theater is $125 for a party of 20, plus $6 for each additional guest.
- Kayla invited 25 classmates, 7 girls from her dance class, and 13 family members.
- 4 people said they could not come.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of guests invited.
Total guests invited = 25 classmates + 7 dance class girls + 13 family members = 45 guests

Step 2: Calculate the number of guests who will attend the party.
Guests attending = Total guests invited - Guests who cannot come
Guests attending = 45 - 4 = 41 guests

Step 3: Calculate the additional guests beyond the initial 20.
Additional guests = Guests attending - 20
Additional guests = 41 - 20 = 21 guests

Step 4: Calculate the total cost of the party.
Base cost = $125 (for the first 20 guests)
Additional cost = $6 per additional guest

Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. The base cost to rent the theater is $125 for a party of 20 people.
2. The additional cost is $6 per person beyond the initial 20.
3. Kayla invited:
   - 25 classmates
   - 7 girls from her dance class
   - 13 family members
   - Total invited: 25 + 7 + 13 = 45 people
4. 4 people said they could not come, so the final number of attendees is:
   - 45 - 4 = 41 people
5. The additional cost for the 21 people beyond the initial 20 is:
   - 21 people x $6 per person = $126
6. The total cost for the party is:
   - Base cost: $125
   - Additional cost: $126
   - Total cost: $125 + $126 = $251

Therefore, the total cost for Kayla's birthday party at the movie theater will be $251.
