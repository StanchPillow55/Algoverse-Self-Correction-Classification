To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of people sent by all four schools to the basketball tournament.

Given information:
- There are four schools competing in the tournament.
- Each school has sent a girls' basketball team and a boys' basketball team.
- Each team has 5 players.
- Each school has also sent a coach for each team.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of players.
Number of players per team = 5
Number of teams per school = 2 (girls' team and boys' team)
Number of schools = 4
Total number of players = 5 players per team × 2 teams per school × 4 schools = 40 players

Step 2: Calculate the total number of coaches.
Number of coaches per school = 2 (one for the girls' team and one for the boys' team)
Number of schools = 4
Total number of coaches = 2 coaches per school × 4 schools = 8 coaches

Step 3: Calculate the total number of people sent by all four schools.
Total number of people = Total number of players + Total number of coaches

Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- There are 4 schools competing in the basketball tournament.
- Each school has sent a girls' basketball team and a boys' basketball team.
- Each team has 5 players.
- Each school has also sent a coach for each team.

To find the total number of people sent by all the schools, we need to calculate the following:
1. Total number of players
2. Total number of coaches

Step 1: Calculate the total number of players.
Number of players per team = 5
Number of teams per school = 2 (girls' team and boys' team)
Number of schools = 4

Total number of players = Number of players per team × Number of teams per school × Number of schools
Total number of players = 5 × 2 × 4 = 40

Step 2: Calculate the total number of coaches.
Number of coaches per school = 2 (one for the girls' team and one for the boys' team)
Number of schools = 4

Total number of coaches = Number of coaches per school × Number of schools
