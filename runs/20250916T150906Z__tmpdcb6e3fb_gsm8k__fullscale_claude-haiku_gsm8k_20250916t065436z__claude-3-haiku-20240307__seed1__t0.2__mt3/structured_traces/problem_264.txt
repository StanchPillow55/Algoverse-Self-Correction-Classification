Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Carmen has $100
- Samantha has $25 more than Carmen
- Daisy has $50 more than Samantha

Step 1: Calculate how much Samantha has.
Samantha has $25 more than Carmen.
Samantha's amount = Carmen's amount + $25
Samantha's amount = $100 + $25 = $125

Step 2: Calculate how much Daisy has.
Daisy has $50 more than Samantha.
Daisy's amount = Samantha's amount + $50
Daisy's amount = $125 + $50 = $175

Step 3: Calculate the total amount all three girls have combined.
Total amount = Carmen's amount + Samantha's amount + Daisy's amount
Total amount = $100 + $125 + $175 = $400

Therefore, the total amount all three girls have combined is $400.
