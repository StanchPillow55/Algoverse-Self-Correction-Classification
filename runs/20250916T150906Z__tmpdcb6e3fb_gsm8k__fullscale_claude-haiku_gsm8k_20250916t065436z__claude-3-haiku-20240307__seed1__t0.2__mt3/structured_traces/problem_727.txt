Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- There are 64 students' cars, each with 4 windows.
- There are 32 teachers' cars, each with 2 windows.
- Hannah smashes a quarter (1/4) of the students' cars' windows.
- Hannah smashes three-quarters (3/4) of the teachers' cars' windows.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of windows in the students' cars.
Total windows in students' cars = 64 cars × 4 windows per car = 256 windows

Step 2: Calculate the number of windows Hannah smashes in the students' cars.
Windows smashed in students' cars = 1/4 of 256 windows = 256 × 1/4 = 64 windows

Step 3: Calculate the total number of windows in the teachers' cars.
Total windows in teachers' cars = 32 cars × 2 windows per car = 64 windows

Step 4: Calculate the number of windows Hannah smashes in the teachers' cars.

Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Students' cars:
   * There are 64 students' cars
   * Each car has 4 windows
   * Hannah smashes a quarter (1/4) of the students' cars' windows

To calculate the number of students' car windows smashed:
* Total students' car windows = 64 cars x 4 windows per car = 256 windows
* Hannah smashes 1/4 of 256 windows = 256 x 1/4 = 64 windows

2. Teachers' cars:
   * There are 32 teachers' cars
   * Each car has 2 windows
   * Hannah smashes 3/4 of the teachers' cars' windows

To calculate the number of teachers' car windows smashed:
* Total teachers' car windows = 32 cars x 2 windows per car = 64 windows
* Hannah smashes 3/4 of 64 windows = 64 x 3/4 = 48 windows

3. Total windows smashed:
   * Students' car
