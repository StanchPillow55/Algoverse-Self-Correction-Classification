Okay, let's break down this problem step by step.

Given information:
- Tim has a box with 7 blue shoe boxes and 9 red shoe boxes.
- He uses 3 blue shoeboxes and 1/3 of the red shoeboxes to go fishing.

Step 1: Calculate the number of red shoeboxes used for fishing.
1/3 of 9 red shoeboxes = 1/3 × 9 = 3 red shoeboxes

Step 2: Calculate the number of blue and red shoeboxes left in the box.
Blue shoeboxes left = 7 - 3 = 4 blue shoeboxes
Red shoeboxes left = 9 - 3 = 6 red shoeboxes

Therefore, the number of red and blue shoe boxes left in Tim's box is:
4 blue shoeboxes and 6 red shoeboxes

Final answer: 4 blue shoeboxes and 6 red shoeboxes are left in Tim's box.
