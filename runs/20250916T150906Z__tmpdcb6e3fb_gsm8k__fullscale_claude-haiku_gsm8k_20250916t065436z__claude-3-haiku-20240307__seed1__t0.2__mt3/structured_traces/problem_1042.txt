Okay, let's break down this problem step by step.

Given information:
- On the first race, Johnny's dad lost $5.
- On the second race, he won $1 more than twice the amount he previously lost.
- On the third race, he lost 1.5 times as much as he won in the second race.

Step 1: Calculate the amount he won in the second race.
Amount he won in the second race = 2 × $5 + $1 = $11

Step 2: Calculate the amount he lost in the third race.
Amount he lost in the third race = 1.5 × $11 = $16.50

Step 3: Calculate the total amount he lost or won.
Total amount lost or won = -$5 + $11 - $16.50 = -$10.50

Step 4: Calculate the average amount he lost that day.
Average amount lost = Total amount lost or won / 3 races
Average amount lost = -$10.50 / 3 = -$3.50

Therefore, on average, Johnny's dad lost $3
