To solve this problem, we need to find the total amount of flour and milk required for the quadruple batch of brownies, and then determine how many bags of flour and bottles of milk Mark needs to buy.

Given information:
- The normal recipe calls for 3 cups of flour and 1 cup of milk.
- Mark is making a quadruple batch of brownies.
- Flour is sold in 2-cup bags, and milk is sold in 2-cup bottles.

Step 1: Calculate the total amount of flour and milk required for the quadruple batch.
Total flour required = 3 cups × 4 (quadruple batch) = 12 cups
Total milk required = 1 cup × 4 (quadruple batch) = 4 cups

Step 2: Determine the number of bags of flour and bottles of milk Mark needs to buy.
Bags of flour required = Total flour required / Size of each bag
Bags of flour required = 12 cups / 2 cups per bag = 6 bags

Bottles of milk required = Total milk required / Size of each bottle
Bottles of milk

Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. The normal recipe calls for 3 cups of flour and 1 cup of milk.
2. Mark is making a quadruple batch, which means he needs 4 times the normal amount of ingredients.

To calculate the amount of flour and milk needed for the quadruple batch:
* Flour needed: 3 cups x 4 = 12 cups
* Milk needed: 1 cup x 4 = 4 cups

Now, we need to determine how many bags of flour and bottles of milk Mark needs to buy.

Flour is sold in 2-cup bags, so:
* 12 cups of flour / 2 cups per bag = 6 bags of flour

Milk is sold in 2-cup bottles, so: 
* 4 cups of milk / 2 cups per bottle = 2 bottles of milk

To find the difference between the number of bags of flour and bottles of milk, we subtract:
* 6 bags of flour - 2 bottles of milk = 4 more bags of flour than bottles
