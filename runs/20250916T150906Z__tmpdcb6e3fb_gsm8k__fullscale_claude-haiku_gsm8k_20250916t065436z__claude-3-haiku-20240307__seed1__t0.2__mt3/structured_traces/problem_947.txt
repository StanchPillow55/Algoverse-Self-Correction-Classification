Okay, let's break down this problem step by step:

Given information:
- Jasmine was given 15 stickers for participating in class.
- She lost 7 stickers during playtime.
- Her teacher gave her another 5 stickers for helping her classmates.

Step 1: Calculate the number of stickers Jasmine had after losing 7 stickers during playtime.
Initial number of stickers: 15
Stickers lost during playtime: 7
Number of stickers after losing 7: 15 - 7 = 8 stickers

Step 2: Calculate the number of stickers Jasmine had after receiving an additional 5 stickers from her teacher.
Number of stickers after losing 7: 8
Additional stickers received: 5
Total number of stickers: 8 + 5 = 13 stickers

Therefore, Jasmine has 13 stickers at the end.

Final answer: Jasmine has 13 stickers at the end.
