Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- Misha picks out 4 blouses from the 30% off rack.
- The regular price for each blouse is $20.

To find the total cost of the discounted blouses, we need to follow these steps:

Step 1: Calculate the discount amount for each blouse.
Discount percentage = 30%
Discount amount per blouse = Regular price × Discount percentage
Discount amount per blouse = $20 × 0.30 = $6

Step 2: Calculate the discounted price for each blouse.
Discounted price per blouse = Regular price - Discount amount
Discounted price per blouse = $20 - $6 = $14

Step 3: Calculate the total cost of the 4 discounted blouses.
Total cost = Discounted price per blouse × Number of blouses
Total cost = $14 × 4 = $56

Therefore, the total cost of the 4 discounted blouses is $56.
