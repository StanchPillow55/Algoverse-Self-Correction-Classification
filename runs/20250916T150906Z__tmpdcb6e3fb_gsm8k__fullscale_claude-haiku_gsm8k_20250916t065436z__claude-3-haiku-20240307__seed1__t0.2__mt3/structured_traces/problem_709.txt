To solve this problem, we need to find the rate of production for both chocolate and vanilla ice cream, and then calculate the total amount of ice cream produced in 48 hours.

Given information:
- The ice cream factory makes 100 quarts of chocolate ice cream in 2 hours.
- The ice cream factory makes 50 quarts of vanilla ice cream in 4 hours.

Step 1: Find the rate of production for chocolate ice cream.
Rate of production for chocolate ice cream = 100 quarts / 2 hours = 50 quarts per hour

Step 2: Find the rate of production for vanilla ice cream.
Rate of production for vanilla ice cream = 50 quarts / 4 hours = 12.5 quarts per hour

Step 3: Calculate the total amount of chocolate ice cream produced in 48 hours.
Total chocolate ice cream produced = Rate of production × Time
Total chocolate ice cream produced = 50 quarts per hour × 48 hours = 2,400 quarts

Step 4: Calculate the total amount of vanilla ice cream produced in 48 hours.

Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- The ice cream factory makes 100 quarts of chocolate ice cream in 2 hours.
- The ice cream factory makes 50 quarts of vanilla ice cream in 4 hours.
- We need to find the total quarts made in 48 hours.

Step 1: Calculate the rate of production for chocolate ice cream.
Rate of chocolate ice cream production = 100 quarts / 2 hours = 50 quarts per hour

Step 2: Calculate the rate of production for vanilla ice cream.
Rate of vanilla ice cream production = 50 quarts / 4 hours = 12.5 quarts per hour

Step 3: Calculate the total quarts of chocolate ice cream made in 48 hours.
Total chocolate ice cream = Rate of chocolate ice cream production × Time
Total chocolate ice cream = 50 quarts/hour × 48 hours = 2,400 quarts

Step 4: Calculate the total quarts of vanilla ice cream made in 48 hours.
Total vanilla ice cream = Rate of vanilla ice cream
