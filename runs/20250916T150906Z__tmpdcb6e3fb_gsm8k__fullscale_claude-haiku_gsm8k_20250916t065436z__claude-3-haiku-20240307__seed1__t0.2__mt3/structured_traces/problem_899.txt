Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- Susan made 100 cookies for Christmas.
- Susan was going to divide the cookies equally between her 6 nephews.
- Before Susan could package the cookies, her husband snuck 4 cookies for himself.

Step 1: Determine the number of cookies left after the husband took 4 cookies.
Total cookies made = 100
Cookies taken by the husband = 4
Cookies left = 100 - 4 = 96 cookies

Step 2: Divide the remaining cookies equally among the 6 nephews.
Cookies left = 96
Number of nephews = 6
Cookies per nephew = 96 รท 6 = 16 cookies

Therefore, each of Susan's 6 nephews will get 16 cookies.

Final answer: Each of Susan's 6 nephews will get 16 cookies.

Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Susan made 100 cookies for Christmas.
2. She was going to divide them equally between her 6 nephews.
3. Before she could package them, her husband took 4 cookies for himself.

To find out how many cookies each nephew will get, we need to:
1. Subtract the 4 cookies that the husband took from the total 100 cookies.
2. Divide the remaining cookies equally among the 6 nephews.

Step 1: Subtract the 4 cookies taken by the husband.
100 cookies - 4 cookies = 96 cookies remaining

Step 2: Divide the 96 cookies equally among the 6 nephews.
96 cookies รท 6 nephews = 16 cookies per nephew

Therefore, each of Susan's 6 nephews will get 16 cookies.

Final answer: Each of Susan's 6 nephews will get 16 cookies.
