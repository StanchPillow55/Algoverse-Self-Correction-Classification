To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total time it takes for John to drive to his friend's house and then back home.

Given information:
- Distance to friend's house: 200 miles
- Speed to friend's house: 70 mph
- Detour distance: 10 miles
- Distance back home: 240 miles
- Speed back home: 80 mph

Step 1: Calculate the total distance to the friend's house.
Total distance to friend's house = 200 miles + 10 miles (detour) = 210 miles

Step 2: Calculate the time it takes to drive to the friend's house.
Time to friend's house = Total distance to friend's house / Speed to friend's house
Time to friend's house = 210 miles / 70 mph = 3 hours

Step 3: Calculate the time it takes to drive back home.
Time back home = Distance back home / Speed back home
Time back home = 240 miles / 80 mph = 3 hours

Step 4: Calculate the total time for the trip.
Total time for the trip = Time to friend's

Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- John drives to his friend's house 200 miles away.
- He drives at a speed of 70 mph.
- The detour added 10 miles to his trip.
- On the way back, the route is 240 miles, and he drives at 80 mph.

Step 1: Calculate the total distance of the trip to his friend's house.
Original distance = 200 miles
Detour distance = 10 miles
Total distance to friend's house = 200 miles + 10 miles = 210 miles

Step 2: Calculate the time it takes to drive to his friend's house.
Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 210 miles / 70 mph = 3 hours

Step 3: Calculate the time it takes to drive back home.
Distance = 240 miles
Speed = 80 mph
Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 240 miles / 80 mph = 3 hours

Step 4: Calculate the total time of the trip.
Total time = Time to friend's
