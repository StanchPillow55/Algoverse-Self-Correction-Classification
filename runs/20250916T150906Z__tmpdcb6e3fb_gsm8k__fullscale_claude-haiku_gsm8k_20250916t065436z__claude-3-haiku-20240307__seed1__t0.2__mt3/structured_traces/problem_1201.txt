Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- There are 66 fish in the fish tank.
- One-third of the fish have red stripes.
- 5/11 of the remaining fish have blue stripes.

Step 1: Calculate the number of fish with red stripes.
One-third of 66 fish = 66 รท 3 = 22 fish have red stripes.

Step 2: Calculate the number of fish remaining after the red-striped fish.
Total fish - Fish with red stripes = Fish remaining
66 - 22 = 44 fish remaining.

Step 3: Calculate the number of fish with blue stripes.
5/11 of the remaining 44 fish = (5 รท 11) ร 44 = 20 fish have blue stripes.

Step 4: Calculate the total number of fish with red stripes and blue stripes.
Fish with red stripes + Fish with blue stripes = Total fish with red and blue stripes
22 + 20 = 42 fish have re
