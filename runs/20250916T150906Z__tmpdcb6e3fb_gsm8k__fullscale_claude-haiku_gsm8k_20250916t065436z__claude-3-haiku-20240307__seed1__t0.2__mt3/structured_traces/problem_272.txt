To solve this problem, we need to find the total cost of the items the mother bought and then subtract it from the amount she paid.

Given information:
- Cocoa costs $4.20.
- Laundry costs $9.45.
- A package of pasta costs $1.35.
- The mother paid $20.

Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the items.
Total cost = Cost of cocoa + Cost of laundry + Cost of pasta
Total cost = $4.20 + $9.45 + $1.35 = $15.00

Step 2: Calculate the change the cashier should give back.
Change = Amount paid - Total cost
Change = $20.00 - $15.00 = $5.00

Therefore, the cashier should give the mother $5.00 in change.

Final answer: The cashier should give the mother $5.00 in change.
