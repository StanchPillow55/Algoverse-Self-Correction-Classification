Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Jamal's phone can hold 6 times more photographs than Brittany's phone.
- The maximum number of photographs that Brittany's phone can hold is 50 times more than the number of birds in Jamal's photograph of the ducks at the zoo.
- Jamal's phone can hold 1800 photographs.

Step 1: Find the maximum number of photographs that Brittany's phone can hold.
Since Jamal's phone can hold 6 times more photographs than Brittany's phone, we can divide the number of photographs Jamal's phone can hold by 6 to find the maximum number of photographs Brittany's phone can hold.
Maximum number of photographs Brittany's phone can hold = 1800 รท 6 = 300 photographs

Step 2: Find the number of birds in Jamal's photograph of the ducks at the zoo.
The maximum number of photographs that Brittany's phone can hold is 50 times more than the number of birds in Jamal's photograph of the

Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Jamal's phone can hold 6 times more photographs than Brittany's phone.
   * Let's call the number of photographs Brittany's phone can hold as 'x'.
   * Then, Jamal's phone can hold 6x photographs.

2. The maximum number of photographs that Brittany's phone can hold is 50 times more than the number of birds in Jamal's photograph of the ducks at the zoo.
   * Let's call the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph as 'y'.
   * Then, the maximum number of photographs Brittany's phone can hold is 50y.
   * We know that Brittany's phone can hold 'x' photographs, so 50y = x.
   * Solving for 'x', we get x = 50y.

3. We know that Jamal's phone can hold 1800 photographs.
   * We know that Jamal's phone can hold 6 times more photographs than Brittany's phone.
   * So,
