Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Initially, James has 4 toys for 4 dogs.

2. There are now 8 more dogs in the shelter, so the total number of dogs is 4 + 8 = 12 dogs.

3. James needs to buy toys for the additional 8 dogs, so he needs to buy 8 more toys.

4. After buying the 8 toys, there are now 4 + 8 = 12 toys for the 12 dogs.

5. However, the problem states that when James went back, there were twice as many more dogs than when he left. This means the number of dogs has doubled from 12 to 24.

6. James now needs to buy toys for the additional 12 dogs, so he needs to buy 12 more toys.

7. The total number of toys James has now is 12 + 12 = 24 toys.

8. Finally, the problem states that 3 dogs were gone, so James no longer needs those 3 toys.

Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Initially, James has 4 toys for 4 dogs.

2. There are now 8 more dogs in the shelter, so he needs to buy 8 more toys.
   * Total toys needed = 4 (initial) + 8 (new) = 12 toys

3. After buying the 8 new toys, there are now twice as many dogs as when he left.
   * If there were 4 dogs initially, and 8 more were added, that means there are now 12 dogs total.
   * Twice as many dogs as when he left means there are now 24 dogs.
   * So he needs to buy 12 more toys (24 dogs - 12 toys he already has).
   * Total toys needed = 12 (initial) + 12 (new) = 24 toys

4. When James came back again, 3 dogs were gone, so he no longer needs those 3 toys.
   * Total toys needed = 24 (previous) - 3 (no longer
