To solve this problem, we need to find the number of green cards and yellow cards, and then add them to the number of red cards to get the total number of cards.

Given information:
- There are 15 red cards.
- The number of green cards is 60% more than the number of red cards.
- The number of yellow cards is equal to the sum of the number of red and green cards.

Step 1: Find the number of green cards.
Number of green cards = Number of red cards + 60% of the number of red cards
Number of green cards = 15 + (0.6 × 15)
Number of green cards = 15 + 9
Number of green cards = 24

Step 2: Find the number of yellow cards.
Number of yellow cards = Number of red cards + Number of green cards
Number of yellow cards = 15 + 24
Number of yellow cards = 39

Step 3: Find the total number of cards.
Total number of cards = Number of red cards + Number of green cards + Number of yellow cards
Total number of cards = 15 + 24 + 39

Okay, let's break down this problem step by step:

Given information:
- There are 15 red cards in the set of magician's cards.
- The number of green cards is 60% more than the number of red cards.
- The number of yellow cards is equal to the sum of the number of red and green cards.

Step 1: Calculate the number of green cards.
Number of green cards = Number of red cards + 60% of red cards
Number of green cards = 15 + (0.6 × 15)
Number of green cards = 15 + 9
Number of green cards = 24

Step 2: Calculate the number of yellow cards.
Number of yellow cards = Number of red cards + Number of green cards
Number of yellow cards = 15 + 24
Number of yellow cards = 39

Step 3: Calculate the total number of cards of all mentioned colors.
Total number of cards = Number of red cards + Number of green cards + Number of yellow cards
Total number of cards = 15 + 24 + 39
Total number of cards = 78

Therefore, the total number
