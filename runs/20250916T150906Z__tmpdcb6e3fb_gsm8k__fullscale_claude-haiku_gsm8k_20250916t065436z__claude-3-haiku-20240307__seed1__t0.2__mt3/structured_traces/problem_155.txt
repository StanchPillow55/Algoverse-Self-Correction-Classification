Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Bill bakes 300 rolls, 120 chocolate croissants, and 60 baguettes every day.
- Each roll is 4 inches long.
- Each croissant is 6 inches long.
- Each baguette is 2 feet long.

Step 1: Convert the lengths of the rolls and croissants from inches to feet.
1 foot = 12 inches
Rolls: 300 rolls × 4 inches/roll = 1,200 inches
Rolls in feet = 1,200 inches / 12 inches/foot = 100 feet
Croissants: 120 croissants × 6 inches/croissant = 720 inches
Croissants in feet = 720 inches / 12 inches/foot = 60 feet

Step 2: Add up the lengths of all the baked goods.
Total length = Length of rolls + Length of croissants + Length of baguettes
Total length = 100 feet + 60 feet

Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Bill bakes 300 rolls, each 4 inches long.
   * Total length of rolls = 300 rolls x 4 inches/roll = 1,200 inches

2. Bill bakes 120 chocolate croissants, each 6 inches long.
   * Total length of croissants = 120 croissants x 6 inches/croissant = 720 inches

3. Bill bakes 60 baguettes, each 2 feet long.
   * 1 foot = 12 inches
   * Total length of baguettes = 60 baguettes x 2 feet/baguette x 12 inches/foot = 1,440 inches

4. Now we need to add up the total length of all the baked goods:
   * Total length = 1,200 inches (rolls) + 720 inches (croissants) + 1,440 inches (baguettes)
   * Total length = 3,360 inches

5. To convert the total length
