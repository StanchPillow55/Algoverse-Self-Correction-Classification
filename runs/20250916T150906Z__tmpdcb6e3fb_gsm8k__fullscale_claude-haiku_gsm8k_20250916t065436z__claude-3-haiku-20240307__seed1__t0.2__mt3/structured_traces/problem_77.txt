Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah.
- Sarah does 4 times as much laundry as David.
- Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry.

Step 1: Calculate how much laundry Sarah does.
Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry.

Step 2: Calculate how much laundry David does.
Since Sarah does 4 times as much laundry as David, we can divide Sarah's laundry by 4 to find David's laundry.
David's laundry = 400 pounds รท 4 = 100 pounds

Step 3: Calculate how much laundry Raymond does.
Since Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah, we can divide Sarah's laundry by 2 to find Raymond's laundry.
Raymond's laundry = 400 pounds รท 2 = 200 pounds

Step 4: Calculate the difference in the amount of laundry Raymond and David do.
Difference = Raymond's la

Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah.
- Sarah does 4 times as much laundry as David.
- Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry.

Step 1: Calculate how much laundry Sarah does.
Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry.

Step 2: Calculate how much laundry Raymond does.
Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah.
Raymond's laundry = 1/2 ร 400 pounds = 200 pounds

Step 3: Calculate how much laundry David does.
Sarah does 4 times as much laundry as David.
David's laundry = 400 pounds / 4 = 100 pounds

Step 4: Calculate the difference in the amount of laundry Raymond and David do.
Difference = Raymond's laundry - David's laundry
Difference = 200 pounds - 100 pounds = 100 pounds

Therefore, the difference in the amount of laundry Raymond and David do is 100
