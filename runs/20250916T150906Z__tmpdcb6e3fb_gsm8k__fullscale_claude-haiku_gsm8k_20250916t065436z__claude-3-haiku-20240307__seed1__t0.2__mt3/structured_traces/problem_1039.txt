Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- The king-sized bed measures 6 feet long by 8 feet wide.
- Jim needs two pieces of fabric that are 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed.

Step 1: Calculate the dimensions of the fabric pieces.
Length of the fabric pieces = 6 feet + 2 feet + 2 feet = 10 feet
Width of the fabric pieces = 8 feet + 2 feet + 2 feet = 12 feet

Step 2: Calculate the area of each fabric piece.
Area of each fabric piece = Length × Width
Area of each fabric piece = 10 feet × 12 feet = 120 square feet

Step 3: Calculate the total area of fabric needed.
Total area of fabric needed = Area of 2 fabric pieces
Total area of fabric needed = 2 × 120 square feet = 240 square feet

Therefore, Jim needs to buy 240 square feet of fabric to make the comforter for his king-sized bed.

Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- The king-sized bed measures 6 feet long by 8 feet wide.
- Jim needs two pieces of fabric that are 2 feet longer and 2 feet wider than the bed.

Step 1: Calculate the dimensions of the fabric needed.
Bed dimensions: 6 feet long by 8 feet wide
Fabric dimensions: 6 feet + 2 feet = 8 feet long, 8 feet + 2 feet = 10 feet wide

Step 2: Calculate the area of one piece of fabric.
Area of one piece of fabric = Length × Width
Area of one piece of fabric = 8 feet × 10 feet = 80 square feet

Step 3: Calculate the total area of fabric needed.
Since Jim needs two pieces of fabric, the total area of fabric needed is:
Total area of fabric = 2 × Area of one piece of fabric
Total area of fabric = 2 × 80 square feet = 160 square feet

Therefore, Jim needs to buy 160 square feet of
