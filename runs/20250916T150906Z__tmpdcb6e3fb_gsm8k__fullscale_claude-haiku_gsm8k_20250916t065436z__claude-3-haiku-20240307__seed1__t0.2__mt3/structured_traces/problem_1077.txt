To solve this problem, we need to calculate the arrival and departure times of each train, and then determine the total time Paul will wait for his train.

Given information:
- The first train arrives in 10 minutes and stays in the station for 20 minutes.
- The second train arrives half an hour after the first train leaves the station and stays for a quarter of the time the first train stayed.
- The third train arrives an hour after the second train leaves the station and leaves immediately.
- The fourth train, which Paul needs to board, arrives 20 minutes after the third train leaves.

Step 1: Calculate the arrival and departure times of the first train.
Arrival time of the first train: 10 minutes
Departure time of the first train: 10 minutes + 20 minutes = 30 minutes

Step 2: Calculate the arrival and departure times of the second train.
Arrival time of the second train: 30 minutes + 30 minutes = 1 hour
Departure time of the second train: 1 hour + (20 minutes / 4) = 1 hour 5 minutes

Step 3: Calculate
