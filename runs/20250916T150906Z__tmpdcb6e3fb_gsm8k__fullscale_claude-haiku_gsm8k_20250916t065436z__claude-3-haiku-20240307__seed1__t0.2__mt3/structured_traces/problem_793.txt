To solve this problem, we need to calculate Jamie's earnings for the regular 8 hours of work and the additional 3 hours of work at the special hourly rate.

Given information:
- Jamie's regular hourly rate is $20.
- Jamie's special hourly rate is 150% of her regular hourly rate.
- Jamie worked 11 hours last Tuesday.

Step 1: Calculate Jamie's earnings for the regular 8 hours of work.
Regular hourly rate = $20
Regular hours worked = 8 hours
Earnings for regular hours = $20 × 8 hours = $160

Step 2: Calculate Jamie's earnings for the additional 3 hours of work at the special hourly rate.
Special hourly rate = 150% of regular hourly rate = 1.5 × $20 = $30
Additional hours worked = 11 hours - 8 hours = 3 hours
Earnings for additional hours = $30 × 3 hours = $90

Step 3: Calculate the total amount Jamie was paid for her work last Tuesday.
Total earnings = Earnings for regular hours + Earnings
