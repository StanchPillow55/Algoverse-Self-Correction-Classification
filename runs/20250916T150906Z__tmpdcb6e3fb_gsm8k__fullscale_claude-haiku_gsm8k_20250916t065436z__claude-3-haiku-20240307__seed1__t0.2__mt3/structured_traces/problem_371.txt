Okay, let's break down this problem step by step:

Given information:
- On Friday, the store sold 14 pairs of tennis shoes.
- On Saturday, they sold double the number of shoes they sold on Friday.
- On Sunday, they sold one-half the number of shoes they sold on Saturday, but 6 people returned their pairs.
