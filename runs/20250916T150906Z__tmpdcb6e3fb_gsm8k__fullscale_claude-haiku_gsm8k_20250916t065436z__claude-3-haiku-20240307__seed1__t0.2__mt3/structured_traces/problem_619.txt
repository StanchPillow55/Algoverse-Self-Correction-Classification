To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of street lights at each intersection.
2. Calculate the total number of street lights on the road.
3. Subtract the number of non-functioning street lights from the total to find the number of functioning street lights.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of street lights at each intersection.
* Each pole has 4 street lights.
* There are 6 poles at each intersection.
* Total street lights per intersection = 4 street lights per pole × 6 poles = 24 street lights.

Step 2: Calculate the total number of street lights on the road.
* There are 4 intersections on the road.
* Total street lights on the road = 24 street lights per intersection × 4 intersections = 96 street lights.

Step 3: Subtract the number of non-functioning street lights from the total to find the number of functioning street lights.
* There are 20 non-functioning street lights.
* Functioning street lights = Total street lights - Non-functioning street lights
* Functioning street lights = 96 -

Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Each pole on a road intersection has 4 street lights.
- The number of poles at each intersection is 6.
- The road has 4 intersections.
- 20 streetlights from the total number are not working.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of street lights.
Number of street lights per pole = 4
Number of poles per intersection = 6
Number of intersections = 4

Total number of street lights = Number of street lights per pole × Number of poles per intersection × Number of intersections
Total number of street lights = 4 × 6 × 4 = 96 street lights

Step 2: Calculate the number of functioning street lights.
Total number of street lights = 96
Number of street lights not working = 20

Number of functioning street lights = Total number of street lights - Number of street lights not working
Number of functioning street lights = 96 - 20 = 76 street lights

Therefore, the total number of functioning street lights is 76.

Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Each pole has 4 street lights.
2. There are 6 poles at each intersection.
3. There are 4 intersections on the road.
4. The total number of street lights is the number of poles multiplied by the number of street lights per pole, multiplied by the number of intersections.

Total number of street lights = 6 poles per intersection x 4 street lights per pole x 4 intersections
= 96 street lights

5. We are told that 20 streetlights from the total number are not working.

So, the total number of functioning street lights is:
Total street lights - Non-functioning street lights
= 96 - 20
= 76 functioning street lights

Therefore, the total number of functioning street lights is 76.
