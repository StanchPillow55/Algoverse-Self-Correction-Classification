Okay, let's break down this problem step by step:

Given information:
- In the first half of the soccer match, team A scores 4 goals.
- In the first half, team B scores 2 goals fewer than team A.
- In the second half, team A scores 1/4 of the number of goals scored by team B.
- In the second half, team B scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half.

Step 1: Calculate the number of goals scored by team B in the first half.
Team B's goals in the first half = Team A's goals in the first half - 2
Team B's goals in the first half = 4 - 2 = 2 goals

Step 2: Calculate the number of goals scored by team B in the second half.
Team B's goals in the second half = 4 × Team B's goals in the first half
Team B's goals in the second half = 4 × 2 = 8 goals

Step 3: Calculate the number of goals scored by team A in the second half.

Okay, let's break down this problem step by step:

1. In the first half of the soccer match:
   - Team A scores 4 goals
   - Team B scores 2 goals fewer than Team A, so 4 - 2 = 2 goals

2. In the second half of the soccer match:
   - Team B scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half, which is 4 × 2 = 8 goals
   - Team A scores 1/4 of the number of goals scored by Team B, which is 1/4 × 8 = 2 goals

3. To calculate the total number of goals scored in the match:
   - First half:
     - Team A: 4 goals
     - Team B: 2 goals
   - Second half:
     - Team A: 2 goals
     - Team B: 8 goals
   - Total goals scored in the match:
     - Team A: 4 + 2 = 6 goals
     - Team B: 2 + 8 =

Okay, let's break down this problem step by step:

1. In the first half of the soccer match:
   - Team A scores 4 goals
   - Team B scores 2 goals fewer than Team A, so Team B scores 2 goals

2. In the second half of the soccer match:
   - Team A scores 1/4 of the number of goals scored by Team B
   - Team B scores 4 times the number of goals it scored in the first half, which is 4 × 2 = 8 goals

To find the number of goals scored by Team A in the second half:
   - Team B scored 8 goals in the second half
   - Team A scores 1/4 of 8 goals, which is 8 ÷ 4 = 2 goals

3. Now, let's calculate the total number of goals scored in the match:
   - In the first half:
     - Team A scored 4 goals
     - Team B scored 2 goals
   - In the second half:
     - Team A scored 2 goals
