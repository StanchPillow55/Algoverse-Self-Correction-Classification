Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- Mishka bought 3 pairs of shorts, 3 pairs of pants, and 3 pairs of shoes.
- One pair of shorts costs $16.50.
- One pair of pants costs $22.50.
- One pair of shoes costs $42.

To find the total amount Mishka spent, we need to calculate the cost of each item and then add them up.

Step 1: Calculate the cost of the shorts.
Cost of 3 pairs of shorts = 3 × $16.50 = $49.50

Step 2: Calculate the cost of the pants.
Cost of 3 pairs of pants = 3 × $22.50 = $67.50

Step 3: Calculate the cost of the shoes.
Cost of 3 pairs of shoes = 3 × $42 = $126

Step 4: Calculate the total amount Mishka spent.
Total amount spent = Cost of shorts + Cost of pants + Cost of shoes
Total amount spent = $49.50 + $67.50 +

To find the total amount Mishka spent, we need to calculate the cost of each item and then add them up.

Step 1: Calculate the cost of the 3 pairs of shorts.
Cost of 1 pair of shorts = $16.50
Cost of 3 pairs of shorts = 3 × $16.50 = $49.50

Step 2: Calculate the cost of the 3 pairs of pants.
Cost of 1 pair of pants = $22.50
Cost of 3 pairs of pants = 3 × $22.50 = $67.50

Step 3: Calculate the cost of the 3 pairs of shoes.
Cost of 1 pair of shoes = $42

Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

1. Calculating the cost of the shorts:
   * Mishka bought 3 pairs of shorts
   * Each pair of shorts costs $16.50
   * Total cost of the shorts = 3 × $16.50 = $49.50

2. Calculating the cost of the pants:
   * Mishka bought 3 pairs of pants
   * Each pair of pants costs $22.50
   * Total cost of the pants = 3 × $22.50 = $67.50

3. Calculating the cost of the shoes:
   * Mishka bought 3 pairs of shoes
   * Each pair of shoes costs $42
   * Total cost of the shoes = 3 × $42 = $126

4. Calculating the total amount Mishka spent:
   * Total cost = Cost of shorts + Cost of pants + Cost of shoes
   * Total cost = $49.50 + $67.50 + $126 = $243

Therefore, the total amount Mishka spent on all the clothing items is $243
