To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of girls in the choir.
2. Determine the number of girls who were able to perform on the day of the performance.
3. Add the number of teachers who sang with the choir.
4. Provide the final answer.

Step 1: Calculate the number of girls in the choir.
* The choir has 52 members, with 50% being boys and 50% being girls.
* To find the number of girls, we can divide the total number of members by 2:
* 52 รท 2 = 26 girls

Step 2: Determine the number of girls who were able to perform on the day of the performance.
* On the day of the performance, half the people performing couldn't make it due to a bus breakdown.
* This means that half of the 26 girls were able to perform:
* 26 รท 2 = 13 girls

Step 3: Add the number of teachers who sang with the choir.
* The choir's 3 teachers decided to sing with them.

Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. The choir has 52 members total.
2. 50% of the choir members are boys, and 50% are girls.
   * So, the number of boys and girls are both 26 (52 * 0.5 = 26).
3. The choir decides to perform with just its female members.
   * So, the initial number of performers is 26 (the 26 girls).
4. On the day of the performance, half the people performing can't make it to the show.
   * So, the number of performers is now 13 (26 * 0.5 = 13).
5. The choir's 3 teachers then decide to sing with them.
   * So, the final number of people who sang in the performance is 16 (13 + 3 = 16).

Therefore, the final answer is 16 people sang in the performance.
