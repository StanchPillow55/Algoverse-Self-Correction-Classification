To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of the newspaper ads and the television ads, and then add them together to find the total amount spent by the real estate agent.

Given information:
- The real estate agent spent $5 on each newspaper ad.
- The real estate agent spent $75 on each television ad.
- The real estate agent bought 50 newspaper ads.
- The real estate agent bought 15 television ads.

Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the newspaper ads.
Cost per newspaper ad × Number of newspaper ads = Total cost of newspaper ads
$5 × 50 = $250

Step 2: Calculate the total cost of the television ads.
Cost per television ad × Number of television ads = Total cost of television ads
$75 × 15 = $1,125

Step 3: Calculate the total amount spent by the real estate agent.
Total cost of newspaper ads + Total cost of television ads = Total amount spent
$250 + $1,125 = $1,375

Therefore, the real estate agent spent a total of $1,375 on buying all the ads.

Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- The real estate agent spent $5 on each newspaper ad.
- The real estate agent spent $75 on each television ad.
- The real estate agent bought 50 newspaper ads.
- The real estate agent bought 15 television ads.

Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the newspaper ads.
Cost per newspaper ad = $5
Number of newspaper ads = 50
Total cost of newspaper ads = $5 × 50 = $250

Step 2: Calculate the total cost of the television ads.
Cost per television ad = $75
Number of television ads = 15
Total cost of television ads = $75 × 15 = $1,125

Step 3: Calculate the total cost of all the ads.
Total cost = Total cost of newspaper ads + Total cost of television ads
Total cost = $250 + $1,125 = $1,375

Therefore, the real estate agent spent a total of $1,375 on buying all the ads.

Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. The real estate agent spent $5 on each newspaper ad.
2. He bought 50 newspaper ads.
3. So the total cost of the newspaper ads is:
   * 50 newspaper ads x $5 per ad = $250

4. The real estate agent spent $75 on each television ad.
5. He bought 15 television ads.
6. So the total cost of the television ads is:
   * 15 television ads x $75 per ad = $1,125

7. To find the total amount spent on all the ads, we add the costs of the newspaper ads and television ads:
   * $250 + $1,125 = $1,375

Therefore, the real estate agent spent a total of $1,375 on buying all the ads.
