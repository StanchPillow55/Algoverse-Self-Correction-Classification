To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of the senior gifts, including the picture frames, the etching, the pins, and the cords.

Given information:
- 44 seniors need to receive awards.
- Each picture frame costs $20.
- The etching on each picture frame costs an additional 20% of the frame cost.
- 2 seniors will receive pins that cost $5 each.
- 1/4 of the seniors are officers and will receive cords that cost $12 each.

Step 1: Calculate the cost of the picture frames.
Cost of picture frames = 44 seniors × $20 per frame = $880

Step 2: Calculate the cost of the etching on the picture frames.
Etching cost per frame = 20% of $20 = $4
Total etching cost = 44 seniors × $4 per frame = $176

Step 3: Calculate the cost of the pins.
Cost of pins = 2 seniors × $5 per pin = $10

Step 4: Calculate the cost of the cords for the officers.
Number of officers =

Okay, let's break down this problem step by step and solve it completely.

Given information:
- 44 seniors need to receive awards.
- Each senior receives a picture frame that costs $20.
- Each picture frame needs to be etched with a logo for an additional 20% cost per frame.
- 2 of the seniors will also receive pins that are $5 each.
- 1/4 of the seniors are officers and they will need to receive cords that are $12 each.

Step 1: Calculate the cost of the picture frames.
Cost of picture frames = 44 seniors × $20 per frame = $880

Step 2: Calculate the additional cost for etching the logo on the picture frames.
Additional cost for etching = 20% of $880 = 0.20 × $880 = $176
Total cost of picture frames with etching = $880 + $176 = $1,056

Step 3: Calculate the cost of the pins for 2 seniors.
Cost of pins = 2 seniors × $5 per pin = $10

Step 4: Calculate the
