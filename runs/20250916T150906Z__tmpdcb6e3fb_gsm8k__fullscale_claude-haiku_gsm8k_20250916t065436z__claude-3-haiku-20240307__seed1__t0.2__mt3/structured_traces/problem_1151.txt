To solve this problem, we need to find the total distance traveled and the total time taken, and then calculate the average speed.

Given information:
- Sid traveled 110 miles in 2 hours.
- Sid then traveled an additional 140 miles in 3 hours.

Step 1: Calculate the total distance traveled.
Total distance traveled = 110 miles + 140 miles = 250 miles

Step 2: Calculate the total time taken.
Total time taken = 2 hours + 3 hours = 5 hours

Step 3: Calculate the average speed.
Average speed = Total distance traveled / Total time taken
Average speed = 250 miles / 5 hours = 50 miles per hour

Therefore, the average speed Sid was traveling is 50 miles per hour.
