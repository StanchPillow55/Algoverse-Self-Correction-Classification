To solve this problem, we need to find the average price per ticket that Deepa paid for watching the Fast and the Furious movies.

Given information:
- There are 9 Fast and the Furious movies.
- Deepa has seen each movie in the theatre three times.
- Deepa has spent a total of $216 seeing these movies.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of tickets Deepa bought.
Total number of tickets = Number of movies × Number of times per movie
Total number of tickets = 9 × 3 = 27 tickets

Step 2: Calculate the average price per ticket.
Average price per ticket = Total amount spent / Total number of tickets
Average price per ticket = $216 / 27 tickets
Average price per ticket = $8

Therefore, the average price Deepa paid per ticket for watching the Fast and the Furious movies is $8.

Final answer: The average price Deepa paid per ticket is $8.
