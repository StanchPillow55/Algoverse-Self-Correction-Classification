To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of squares in the comforter and then multiply it by the size of each square (1 square foot) to get the total area of the comforter.

Given information:
- The comforter has 14 red squares.
- The number of blue squares is 4 more than the number of red squares.
- The number of green squares is 6 more than the number of blue squares.
- The number of white squares is 12 fewer than the number of green squares.

Step 1: Find the number of blue squares.
Number of blue squares = Number of red squares + 4
Number of blue squares = 14 + 4 = 18

Step 2: Find the number of green squares.
Number of green squares = Number of blue squares + 6
Number of green squares = 18 + 6 = 24

Step 3: Find the number of white squares.
Number of white squares = Number of green squares - 12
Number of white squares = 24 - 12 = 12

Step 4: Find the total number of squares in the

Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Brittany's comforter has 1-foot by 1-foot colored squares.
2. The comforter has 14 red squares.
3. The comforter has 4 more blue squares than red squares.
   * So, the number of blue squares = 14 + 4 = 18.
4. The comforter has 6 more green squares than blue squares.
   * So, the number of green squares = 18 + 6 = 24.
5. The comforter has 12 fewer white squares than green squares.
   * So, the number of white squares = 24 - 12 = 12.

Now, to calculate the total square feet of the comforter:
* Each square is 1-foot by 1-foot, so each square is 1 square foot.
* The total number of squares is:
   * Red squares: 14
   * Blue squares: 18
   * Green squares: 24
   * White squares: 12
* Total squares

Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Brittany's comforter has 1-foot by 1-foot colored squares.
2. The comforter has:
   - 14 red squares
   - 4 more blue squares than red squares
   - 6 more green squares than blue squares
   - 12 fewer white squares than green squares

To find the total number of square feet in the comforter, we need to calculate the number of each colored square and then add them up.

Step 1: Calculate the number of blue squares.
Number of blue squares = 14 + 4 = 18

Step 2: Calculate the number of green squares.
Number of green squares = 18 + 6 = 24

Step 3: Calculate the number of white squares.
Number of white squares = 24 - 12 = 12

Step 4: Calculate the total number of squares in the comforter.
Total number of squares = 14 + 18 + 24 + 12 = 68

Step 5: Calculate the total square feet
