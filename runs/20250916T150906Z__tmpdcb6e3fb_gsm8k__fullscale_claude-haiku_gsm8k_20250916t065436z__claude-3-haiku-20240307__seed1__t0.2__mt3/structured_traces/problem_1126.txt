To solve this problem, we need to find the distance Alfie needs to fly to reach half the circumference of the earth, and then calculate the number of days it will take him to cover that distance.

Given information:
- Alfie the albatross flies 400 kilometers every day.
- The circumference of the earth is 40,000 kilometers.

Step 1: Calculate the distance Alfie needs to fly to reach half the circumference of the earth.
Half the circumference of the earth = 40,000 km / 2 = 20,000 km

Step 2: Calculate the number of days it will take Alfie to fly a distance equal to half the circumference of the earth.
Distance to fly = 20,000 km
Distance Alfie flies per day = 400 km
Number of days = Distance to fly / Distance per day
Number of days = 20,000 km / 400 km per day = 50 days

Therefore, it will take Alfie the albatross 50 days to fly a distance equal to half the circumference of the earth.

Final answer: It will
