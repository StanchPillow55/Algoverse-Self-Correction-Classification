To solve this problem, we need to find the ages of Emil's dad and brother based on the given information.

Given information:
- Emil is 19 years old now.
- When Emil turns 24, he will be half the age of his dad but twice as old as his brother.

Step 1: Find Emil's age when he turns 24.
Emil's age when he turns 24 = 24 years

Step 2: Find the age of Emil's dad when Emil turns 24.
Since Emil will be half the age of his dad when he turns 24, we can set up the following equation:
Emil's age when he turns 24 = 1/2 × Dad's age when Emil turns 24
24 = 1/2 × Dad's age when Emil turns 24
Dad's age when Emil turns 24 = 24 × 2 = 48 years

Step 3: Find the age of Emil's brother when Emil turns 24.
Since Emil will be twice as old as his brother when he turns 24, we can set up the following equation:
Emil's age when he turns 24 =

Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Emil is 19 years old now.
- When Emil turns 24, he will be half the age of his dad but twice as old as his brother.

Step 1: Find Emil's age when he turns 24.
Emil's age when he turns 24 = 24 years

Step 2: Find the relationship between Emil's age and his dad's age when Emil turns 24.
When Emil turns 24, he will be half the age of his dad.
Emil's age / Dad's age = 1/2
24 / Dad's age = 1/2
Dad's age = 48 years

Step 3: Find the relationship between Emil's age and his brother's age when Emil turns 24.
When Emil turns 24, he will be twice as old as his brother.
Emil's age / Brother's age = 2
24 / Brother's age = 2
Brother's age = 12 years

Step 4: Find the sum of the ages of Emil's dad and brother now.
Dad's age now = 48
