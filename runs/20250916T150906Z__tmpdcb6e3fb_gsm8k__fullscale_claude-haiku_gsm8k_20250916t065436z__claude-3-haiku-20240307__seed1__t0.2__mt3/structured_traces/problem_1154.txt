Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Mason eats 4 carrots each on weekdays (Monday to Friday)
- Mason eats 5 carrots each on Saturday and Sunday

To find the total number of carrots Mason eats in a week, we need to calculate the number of carrots he eats on weekdays and the number of carrots he eats on weekends, then add them together.

Step 1: Calculate the number of carrots Mason eats on weekdays.
Number of carrots per weekday × Number of weekdays = Total carrots on weekdays
4 carrots × 5 days = 20 carrots

Step 2: Calculate the number of carrots Mason eats on weekends.
Number of carrots per weekend day × Number of weekend days = Total carrots on weekends
5 carrots × 2 days = 10 carrots

Step 3: Calculate the total number of carrots Mason eats in a week.
Total carrots on weekdays + Total carrots on weekends = Total carrots per week
20 carrots + 10

To find the total number of carrots Mason eats in a week, we need to calculate the number of carrots he eats on weekdays and the number of carrots he eats on weekends, then add them together.

Step 1: Calculate the number of carrots Mason eats on weekdays.
Number of weekdays = 5 (Monday to Friday)
Number of carrots per weekday = 4
Total carrots eaten on weekdays = 5 days × 4 carrots per day = 20 carrots

Step 2: Calculate the number of carrots Mason eats on weekends.
Number of weekend days = 2 (Saturday and Sunday)
Number of carrots per weekend day = 5
Total carrots eaten on weekends = 2 days × 5 carrots per day = 10 carrots

Step 3: Calculate the total number of carrots Mason eats

Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Mason eats 4 carrots each on weekdays.
   * There are 5 weekdays in a week (Monday through Friday).
   * So, on weekdays, he eats:
     * 4 carrots x 5 days = 20 carrots

2. Mason eats 5 carrots each on Saturday and Sunday.
   * There are 2 weekend days in a week (Saturday and Sunday).
   * So, on weekends, he eats:
     * 5 carrots x 2 days = 10 carrots

3. To calculate the total number of carrots Mason eats in a week, we add the weekday and weekend amounts:
   * 20 carrots (weekdays) + 10 carrots (weekends) = 30 carrots

Therefore, the total number of carrots Mason eats in a week is 30 carrots.
