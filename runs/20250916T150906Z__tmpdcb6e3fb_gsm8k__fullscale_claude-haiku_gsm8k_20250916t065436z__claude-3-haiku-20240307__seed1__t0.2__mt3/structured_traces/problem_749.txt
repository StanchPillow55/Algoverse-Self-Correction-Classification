Okay, let's break down this problem step-by-step:

Given information:
- There are 54 students
- They need to be separated into 6 groups of equal size
- The activity requires 12 groups

Step 1: Determine the number of students in each group.
Total number of students / Number of groups = Number of students per group
54 students / 6 groups = 9 students per group

Step 2: Determine the total number of groups needed for the activity.
The activity requires 12 groups.

Step 3: Determine how many more groups are needed.
Number of groups required for the activity - Number of groups formed = Number of additional groups needed
12 groups - 6 groups = 6 more groups needed

Therefore, 6 more groups are needed to form the 12 groups required for the activity.

Final answer: 6 more groups are needed.

Okay, let's break down this problem step-by-step:

Given information:
- There are 54 students
- They need to be separated into 6 groups of equal size
- The activity requires 12 groups

Step 1: Calculate the number of students per group when divided into 6 groups.
Number of students per group = 54 students / 6 groups = 9 students per group

Step 2: Calculate the number of groups needed for the activity.
Number of groups needed = 12 groups

Step 3: Calculate the number of additional groups needed.
Number of additional groups needed = 12 groups - 6 groups = 6 more groups

Therefore, 6 more groups are needed to form the 12 groups required for the activity.

Final answer: 6 more groups are needed.
