To solve this problem, we need to find the total miles Soledad needs to hike during the month of June and then calculate the additional miles she needs to hike per day to complete her journey on time.

Given information:
- Soledad plans to hike 9,300 miles during the month of June.
- She plans to walk twice a day, covering 125 miles each time.

Step 1: Calculate the total miles Soledad can hike in a month.
Total miles per day = 125 miles × 2 = 250 miles
Total miles in a month = 250 miles × 30 days = 7,500 miles

Step 2: Calculate the additional miles Soledad needs to hike per day to complete her journey on time.
Total miles to hike = 9,300 miles
Total miles Soledad can hike in a month = 7,500 miles
Additional miles to hike = 9,300 miles - 7,500 miles = 1,800 miles

Step 3: Calculate the additional miles Soledad needs to hike per day.

Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Soledad wants to hike 9,300 miles in the month of June.
- She plans to hike twice a day, covering 125 miles each time.

Step 1: Calculate the total miles Soledad plans to hike in a day.
Miles hiked per day = 2 hikes × 125 miles per hike = 250 miles per day

Step 2: Calculate the total miles Soledad plans to hike in the month of June.
Total miles planned = 250 miles per day × 30 days in June = 7,500 miles

Step 3: Calculate the difference between the total miles Soledad wants to hike and the total miles she plans to hike.
Miles left to hike = 9,300 miles - 7,500 miles = 1,800 miles

Step 4: Calculate the additional miles per day Soledad needs to hike to complete her journey on time.
Additional miles per day = 1,800 miles / 30 days = 60 miles per
