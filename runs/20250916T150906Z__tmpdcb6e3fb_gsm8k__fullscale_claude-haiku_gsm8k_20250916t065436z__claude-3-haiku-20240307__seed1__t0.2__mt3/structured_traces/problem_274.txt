To solve this problem, we need to find the total cost of the tomato seeds and the celery seeds, and then add them together to get the total amount of money Mrs. Rylan used to buy the seeds.

Given information:
- Mrs. Rylan bought 20 packets of tomato seeds.
- Mrs. Rylan bought 80 packets of celery seeds.
- A packet of tomato seeds costs $40.
- A packet of celery seeds costs $30.

Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the tomato seeds.
Total cost of tomato seeds = Number of packets × Cost per packet
Total cost of tomato seeds = 20 × $40 = $800

Step 2: Calculate the total cost of the celery seeds.
Total cost of celery seeds = Number of packets × Cost per packet
Total cost of celery seeds = 80 × $30 = $2,400

Step 3: Calculate the total amount of money Mrs. Rylan used to buy the seeds.
Total amount of money used = Total cost of tomato seeds + Total cost of celery seeds
Total amount of money used = $

Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Mrs. Rylan bought 20 packets of tomato seeds
- Mrs. Rylan bought 80 packets of celery seeds
- Each packet of tomato seeds costs $40
- Each packet of celery seeds costs $30

To find the total amount of money Mrs. Rylan used to buy the seeds, we need to calculate the cost of the tomato seeds and the cost of the celery seeds, then add them together.

Step 1: Calculate the cost of the tomato seeds.
Cost of tomato seeds = Number of packets × Cost per packet
Cost of tomato seeds = 20 × $40 = $800

Step 2: Calculate the cost of the celery seeds.
Cost of celery seeds = Number of packets × Cost per packet
Cost of celery seeds = 80 × $30 = $2,400

Step 3: Calculate the total cost of all the seeds.
Total cost = Cost of tomato seeds + Cost of celery seeds
Total cost = $800 + $2,400 = $3,200
