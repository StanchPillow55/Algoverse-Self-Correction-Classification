Okay, let's break down this problem step-by-step:

Given information:
- Hannah needs to drink 60 ml of water for each kilometer she runs.
- Her gym teacher tells her to run 8 laps.
- Each lap is 0.25 km.

Step 1: Calculate the total distance Hannah needs to run.
Total distance = Number of laps × Distance per lap
Total distance = 8 laps × 0.25 km/lap = 2 km

Step 2: Calculate the amount of water Hannah needs to drink.
Water needed = Total distance × Water needed per kilometer
Water needed = 2 km × 60 ml/km = 120 ml

Therefore, Hannah will need to drink 120 milliliters of water.

Final answer: 120 milliliters
