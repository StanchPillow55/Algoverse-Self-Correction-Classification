Okay, let's break down this problem step-by-step:

Given information:
- Jeff sent 8 dozen glasses and 4 dozen plates for the party.
- 10 glasses were broken and 6 plates were broken.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of glasses and plates sent for the party.
Glasses sent = 8 dozen = 8 × 12 = 96 glasses
Plates sent = 4 dozen = 4 × 12 = 48 plates

Step 2: Calculate the number of glasses and plates that were returned.
Glasses returned = Total glasses sent - Broken glasses
Glasses returned = 96 - 10 = 86 glasses

Plates returned = Total plates sent - Broken plates
Plates returned = 48 - 6 = 42 plates

Step 3: Calculate the number of glasses and plates Jeff has now.
Glasses Jeff has now = Glasses returned = 86 glasses
Plates Jeff has now = Plates returned = 42 plates

Therefore, the final answer is:
Jeff has 86 glasses and 42 plates
