To solve this problem, we need to find the total time it takes Matthew to dig all the small holes and all the large holes, and then convert the total time from minutes to hours.

Given information:
- It takes Matthew 3 minutes to dig a small hole for shrubs.
- It takes Matthew 10 minutes to dig a large hole for trees.
- Matthew needs to dig 30 small holes and 15 large holes.

Step 1: Calculate the total time to dig all the small holes.
Time to dig 1 small hole = 3 minutes
Time to dig 30 small holes = 30 × 3 minutes = 90 minutes

Step 2: Calculate the total time to dig all the large holes.
Time to dig 1 large hole = 10 minutes
Time to dig 15 large holes = 15 × 10 minutes = 150 minutes

Step 3: Calculate the total time to dig all the holes.
Total time = Time to dig all small holes + Time to dig all large holes
Total time = 90 minutes + 150 minutes = 240 minutes

Step 4:
