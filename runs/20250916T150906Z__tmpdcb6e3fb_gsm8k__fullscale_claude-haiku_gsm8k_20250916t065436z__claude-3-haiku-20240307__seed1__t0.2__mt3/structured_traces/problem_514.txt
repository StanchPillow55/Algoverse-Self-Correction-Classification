To solve this problem, we need to find the cost of the house given that the house and the lot cost $120,000 and the house costs three times as much as the lot.

Let's define the variables:
- Let x be the cost of the lot.
- Then, the cost of the house is 3x.

Given information:
- The house and the lot cost $120,000.
- The house costs three times as much as the lot.

Step 1: Set up an equation to represent the given information.
Total cost = Cost of the house + Cost of the lot
$120,000 = 3x + x
$120,000 = 4x

Step 2: Solve for the cost of the lot (x).
$120,000 = 4x
x = $120,000 / 4
x = $30,000

Step 3: Calculate the cost of the house.
Cost of the house = 3x
Cost of the house = 3 × $30,000
Cost of the house = $90,000

Therefore, the house cost $90,000.

Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- The house and the lot cost $120,000 in total.
- The house cost three times as much as the lot.

Let's define the variables:
- Let x be the cost of the lot.
- Then, the cost of the house is 3x.

We can set up an equation to solve for the cost of the house:

Total cost = Cost of the house + Cost of the lot
$120,000 = 3x + x
$120,000 = 4x

Solving for x:
x = $120,000 / 4
x = $30,000

Therefore, the cost of the lot is $30,000.

Now, we can find the cost of the house:
Cost of the house = 3 × $30,000 = $90,000

Therefore, the house cost $90,000.

Final answer: The house cost $90,000.
