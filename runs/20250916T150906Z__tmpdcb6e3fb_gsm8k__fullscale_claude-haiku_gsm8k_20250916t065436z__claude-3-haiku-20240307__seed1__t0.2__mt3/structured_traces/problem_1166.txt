To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of fruits produced by the avocado tree in each year and then add them up to find the total number of fruits produced during its 10 years of life.

Given information:
- A 5-year-old avocado tree produces 50 fruits.
- A 6-year-old avocado tree produces 3 times the initial amount of fruits.
- A 7-year-old avocado tree produces 7 times the initial amount of fruits.
- An 8-year-old avocado tree produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old one.
- During the ninth year, the avocado tree doesn't produce any fruit.
- A 10-year-old avocado tree produces 20 times the initial amount of fruits.

Step 1: Calculate the number of fruits produced by the avocado tree in each year.
Year 5: 50 fruits
Year 6: 3 × 50 = 150 fruits
Year 7: 7 × 50 = 350 fruits
Year 8:

Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. A 5-year-old avocado tree produces 50 fruits.
2. A 6-year-old tree produces 3 times the initial amount, which is 3 * 50 = 150 fruits.
3. A 7-year-old tree produces 7 times the initial amount, which is 7 * 50 = 350 fruits.
4. An 8-year-old tree produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old tree. We don't know the 10-year-old tree's production yet, so we'll come back to this.
5. During the 9th year, the tree doesn't produce any fruits.
6. A 10-year-old tree produces 20 times the initial amount, which is 20 * 50 = 1000 fruits.
7. Now we can calculate the 8-year-old tree's production: 1000 - 200 = 800 fruits.

Adding up the total fruits produced over the 10 years:

Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. 5-year-old tree produces 50 fruits
2. 6-year-old tree produces 3 times the initial amount, which is 3 * 50 = 150 fruits
3. 7-year-old tree produces 7 times the initial amount, which is 7 * 50 = 350 fruits
4. 8-year-old tree produces 200 fruits less than a 10-year-old tree. We don't know the 10-year-old tree's production yet, so we'll come back to this.
5. 9-year-old tree doesn't produce any fruits
6. 10-year-old tree produces 20 times the initial amount, which is 20 * 50 = 1000 fruits

Now, let's go back to the 8-year-old tree. We know it produces 200 fruits less than the 10-year-old tree, so:
* 10-year-old tree produces 1000 fruits
* 8-year-old tree
