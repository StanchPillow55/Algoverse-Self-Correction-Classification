Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Jackie grew 3" over the summer.
- Jackie is now 2" shorter than Anne.
- Anne is twice the size of Albert.
- Albert is 36" tall.

Step 1: Find Anne's height.
Since Anne is twice the size of Albert, we can calculate her height as:
Anne's height = 2 × Albert's height
Anne's height = 2 × 36" = 72"

Step 2: Find Jackie's current height.
Jackie is 2" shorter than Anne, so:
Jackie's current height = Anne's height - 2"
Jackie's current height = 72" - 2" = 70"

Step 3: Find Jackie's height before the summer.
We know that Jackie grew 3" over the summer, so:
Jackie's height before the summer = Jackie's current height - 3"
Jackie's height before the summer = 70" - 3" = 67"

Therefore, Jackie was 67" tall before the summer.
