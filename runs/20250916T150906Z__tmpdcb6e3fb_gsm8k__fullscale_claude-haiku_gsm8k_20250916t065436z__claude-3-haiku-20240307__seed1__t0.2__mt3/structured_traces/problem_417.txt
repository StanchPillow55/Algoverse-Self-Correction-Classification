Okay, let's break down this problem step by step:

Given information:
- Tom traveled for 2 weeks (14 days)
- In the first 4 days, he traveled 200 kilometers every day
- Over the next 2 days, he traveled 30% of the distance traveled over the first 4 days
- On the next day, he didn't travel at all
- During the second week, he traveled 300 kilometers every day

Step 1: Calculate the distance traveled in the first 4 days.
Distance traveled in the first 4 days = 4 days × 200 kilometers/day = 800 kilometers

Step 2: Calculate the distance traveled in the next 2 days.
Distance traveled in the next 2 days = 30% of 800 kilometers = 0.3 × 800 kilometers = 240 kilometers

Step 3: Calculate the distance traveled on the day he didn't travel.
Distance traveled on the day he didn't travel = 0 kilometers

Step 4: Calculate the distance traveled during the second week.
Distance traveled during the second week = 7

Okay, let's break down this problem step by step:

Step 1: Calculate the distance traveled in the first 4 days.
* Tom traveled 200 kilometers every day for the first 4 days.
* Total distance traveled in the first 4 days = 200 km x 4 days = 800 km

Step 2: Calculate the distance traveled in the next 2 days.
* Tom traveled 30% of the distance traveled in the first 4 days.
* 30% of 800 km = 0.3 x 800 km = 240 km

Step 3: Calculate the total distance traveled in the first week.
* Total distance traveled in the first week = 800 km + 240 km = 1,040 km

Step 4: Calculate the distance traveled in the second week.
* Tom traveled 300 kilometers every day for the second week.
* Total distance traveled in the second week = 300 km x 7 days = 2,100 km

Step 5: Calculate the total distance traveled during the two-week-long trip.
* Total distance

Okay, let's break down this problem step by step and solve it completely.

Given information:
- Tom went on a two-week-long trip through Europe.
- In the first 4 days, he traveled 200 kilometers every day.
- Over the next two days, he totaled only 30% of the distance traveled over the first four days.
- On the next day, he wasn't traveling at all.
- During the second week, he made 300 kilometers every day.

Step 1: Calculate the distance traveled in the first 4 days.
Distance traveled in the first 4 days = 200 km × 4 days = 800 km

Step 2: Calculate the distance traveled in the next two days.
Distance traveled in the next two days = 30% of 800 km = 0.3 × 800 km = 240 km

Step 3: Calculate the total distance traveled in the first week.
Total distance traveled in the first week = Distance traveled in the first 4 days + Distance traveled in the next two days
Total distance traveled in the first week = 800 km +
