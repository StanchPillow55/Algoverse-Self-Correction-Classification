To solve this problem, we need to set up a system of equations based on the given information and then solve for the number of dromedaries.

Given information:
- The herd consists of camels and dromedaries.
- There are 180 heads (animals) in the herd.
- There are 304 bumps (humps) in the herd.
- Camels have two humps each, and dromedaries have one hump each.

Let's define the variables:
- Let x be the number of camels.
- Let y be the number of dromedaries.

Step 1: Set up the first equation based on the total number of heads (animals) in the herd.
Total number of heads = Number of camels + Number of dromedaries
180 = x + y

Step 2: Set up the second equation based on the total number of bumps (humps) in the herd.
Total number of bumps = (Number of camels × 2) + (Number of dromedaries × 1)
304 = 2x + y

Step 3: Solve the system of equations to

Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- The herd consists of camels and dromedaries.
- There are 180 heads in total.
- There are 304 bumps in total.
- Camels have 2 humps each.
- Dromedaries have 1 hump each.

Let's define the variables:
- Let x = the number of camels
- Let y = the number of dromedaries

We can set up two equations based on the given information:

1. Total number of heads:
   x + y = 180 (since each animal has 1 head)

2. Total number of bumps:
   2x + y = 304 (since camels have 2 humps each and dromedaries have 1 hump each)

Now, we can solve this system of equations to find the number of dromedaries.

Step 1: Solve for x in the first equation.
x + y = 180
x = 180 - y

Step 2: Substitute the expression for x in the second equation.

- The herd consists of camels and dromedaries.
- There are 180 heads in the herd.
- There are 304 bumps in the herd.
- Camels have two humps each, and dromedaries have one hump each.

Let's define the variables:
- Let x be the number of camels in the herd.
- Let y be the number of dromedaries in the herd.

We can set up two equations to solve for x and y:

1. Total number of heads:
   x + y = 180 (since each animal has one head)

2. Total number of bumps:
   2x + y = 304 (since camels have two humps each and dromedaries have one hump each)

Now, we can solve this system of equations:

Step 1: Solve for x in the first equation.
x + y = 180
x = 180 - y

Step 2: Substitute the expression for x in the second equation.
