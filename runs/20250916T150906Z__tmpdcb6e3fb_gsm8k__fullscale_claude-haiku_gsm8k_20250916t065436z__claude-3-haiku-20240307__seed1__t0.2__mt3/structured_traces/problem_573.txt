Okay, let's solve this problem step-by-step.

Given information:
- Katina has $3000 in her savings account.
- She removes $100 from the account every month.
- We need to find the amount of money remaining in the account after 2 years.

Step 1: Calculate the total amount of money removed from the account over 2 years.
Number of months in 2 years = 24 months
Amount removed per month = $100
Total amount removed = $100 Ã— 24 months = $2400

Step 2: Calculate the remaining amount in the account after 2 years.
Initial amount in the account = $3000
Total amount removed = $2400
Remaining amount in the account = $3000 - $2400 = $600

Therefore, the amount of money remaining in Katina's savings account after 2 years is $600.

Final answer: $600
