Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Miss Albert's class has 12 boys and 12 girls, for a total of 24 students.
- One-third of the girls are on varsity.
- One-fourth of the boys are on varsity.

Step 1: Calculate the number of girls on varsity.
One-third of 12 girls = 12 รท 3 = 4 girls on varsity

Step 2: Calculate the number of boys on varsity.
One-fourth of 12 boys = 12 รท 4 = 3 boys on varsity

Step 3: Calculate the total number of students on varsity.
Number of girls on varsity + Number of boys on varsity = 4 + 3 = 7 students on varsity

Step 4: Calculate the number of students not on varsity.
Total students - Students on varsity = 24 - 7 = 17 students not on varsity

Therefore, the final answer is:
17 students are not on varsity
