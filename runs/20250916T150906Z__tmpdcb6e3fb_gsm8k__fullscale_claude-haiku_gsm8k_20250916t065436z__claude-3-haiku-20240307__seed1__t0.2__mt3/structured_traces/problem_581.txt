To solve this problem, we need to convert the time of each movie into minutes and then add them together to find the total time it will take Max to watch the two movies.

Given information:
- The first movie is 1 hour and 30 minutes long.
- The second movie is 2 hours and 5 minutes long.

Step 1: Convert the time of the first movie into minutes.
1 hour = 60 minutes
30 minutes = 30 minutes
Total time of the first movie = 60 minutes + 30 minutes = 90 minutes

Step 2: Convert the time of the second movie into minutes.
2 hours = 120 minutes
5 minutes = 5 minutes
Total time of the second movie = 120 minutes + 5 minutes = 125 minutes

Step 3: Calculate the total time it will take Max to watch the two movies.
Total time = Time of the first movie + Time of the second movie
Total time = 90 minutes + 125 minutes = 215 minutes

Therefore, it will take Max 215 minutes to watch the two movies.
