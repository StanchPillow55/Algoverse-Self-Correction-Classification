Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- 7 bottles of soda cost $21.00
- 4 bottles of water cost $8.00
- David wants to buy 3 bottles of soda and 2 bottles of water

Step 1: Find the cost of 1 bottle of soda.
Cost of 7 bottles of soda = $21.00
Cost of 1 bottle of soda = $21.00 / 7 = $3.00

Step 2: Find the cost of 1 bottle of water.
Cost of 4 bottles of water = $8.00
Cost of 1 bottle of water = $8.00 / 4 = $2.00

Step 3: Calculate the cost of 3 bottles of soda.
Cost of 3 bottles of soda = 3 × $3.00 = $9.00

Step 4: Calculate the cost of 2 bottles of water.
Cost of 2 bottles of water = 2 × $2.00 = $4.

Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- 7 bottles of soda cost $21.00
- 4 bottles of water cost $8.00
- David wants to buy 3 bottles of soda and 2 bottles of water

Step 1: Calculate the cost of 1 bottle of soda.
Cost of 7 bottles of soda / 7 = $21.00 / 7 = $3.00 per bottle of soda

Step 2: Calculate the cost of 1 bottle of water.
Cost of 4 bottles of water / 4 = $8.00 / 4 = $2.00 per bottle of water

Step 3: Calculate the cost of 3 bottles of soda.
3 bottles of soda × $3.00 per bottle = $9.00

Step 4: Calculate the cost of 2 bottles of water.
2 bottles of water × $2.00 per bottle = $4.00

Step 5: Calculate the total cost for 3 bottles of soda an
