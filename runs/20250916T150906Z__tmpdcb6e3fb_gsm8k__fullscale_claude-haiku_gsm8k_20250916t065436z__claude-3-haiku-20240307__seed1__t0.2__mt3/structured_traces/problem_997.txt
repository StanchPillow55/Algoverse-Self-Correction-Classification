Okay, let's break down this problem step by step:

Given information:
- Walter collects $500 from his neighbors.
- Walter collects $1500 from an online fund.
- Walter's lawyer offers to donate three times as much as everyone else donates.
- Walter's friend gives him an additional $200.

Step 1: Calculate the total amount collected from the neighbors and the online fund.
Total amount collected = $500 (from neighbors) + $1500 (from online fund) = $2000

Step 2: Determine the amount the lawyer will contribute.
The lawyer offers to donate three times as much as everyone else donates.
Total amount donated by everyone else = $2000
Amount the lawyer will contribute = 3 × $2000 = $6000

Step 3: Verify the final amount.
The problem states that Walter will tell his lawyer about the neighbors and the online fund until his friend gives him $200 as well.
Total amount collected = $2000 (from neighbors and online fund) + $200 (from friend) = $2200
Amount the lawyer will contribute = 3 × $
