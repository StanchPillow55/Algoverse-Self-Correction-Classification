Okay, let's break down this problem step by step:

Given information:
- Roses cost $2 each or $15 for a dozen.
- Jenny bought 15 roses.
- Jenny arrived with five 5-dollar bills (total of $25).
- The florist only has quarters for change.

Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the 15 roses.
Cost of 15 roses = 15 × $2 = $30

Step 2: Calculate the amount of money Jenny paid.
Jenny paid with five 5-dollar bills = 5 × $5 = $25

Step 3: Calculate the amount of change Jenny should receive.
Change = Amount paid - Total cost of roses
Change = $25 - $30 = -$5

Since the change is negative, this means that Jenny did not have enough money to pay for the 15 roses.

Step 4: Determine the number of quarters Jenny will receive as change.
Since the florist only has quarters for change, and Jenny did not have enough money, she will not receive any quarters as change.

Final answer:
Jenny will not receive

Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Roses cost $2 each or $15 for a dozen.
2. Jenny bought 15 roses.
3. To calculate the cost of 15 roses:
   * 15 roses at $2 each = 15 x $2 = $30

4. Jenny arrived with five $5 bills, which is a total of $25.
5. The total cost of the 15 roses is $30, so Jenny needs to pay an additional $5.
6. Since the florist only has quarters for change, we need to calculate how many quarters Jenny will receive.
   * $5 / $0.25 (value of a quarter) = 20 quarters

Therefore, the final answer is that Jenny will leave with 20 quarters.
