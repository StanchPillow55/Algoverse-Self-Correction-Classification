To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total distance the bird traveled from its northern home to its southern home.

Given information:
- The bird flies in a southerly direction for 10 hours at a speed of 30 miles per hour.
- The bird then flies in a northerly direction for 2 hours at a speed of 18 miles per hour.
- Finally, the bird flies in a southerly direction for 5 hours at a speed of 22 miles per hour.

Step 1: Calculate the distance traveled in the first southerly direction.
Distance = Speed × Time
Distance = 30 miles/hour × 10 hours = 300 miles

Step 2: Calculate the distance traveled in the northerly direction.
Distance = Speed × Time
Distance = 18 miles/hour × 2 hours = 36 miles

Step 3: Calculate the distance traveled in the final southerly direction.
Distance = Speed × Time
Distance = 22 miles/hour × 5 hours = 110 miles

Step 4: Calculate the total distance traveled by the bird.
Total distance = Distance in first southerly direction -

Okay, let's break down this problem step-by-step and solve it completely.

Given information:
- The bird flies in a southerly direction for 10 hours at a speed of 30 miles per hour.
- The bird then flies in a northerly direction for 2 hours at a speed of 18 miles per hour.
- Finally, the bird flies in a southerly direction for 5 hours at a speed of 22 miles per hour.

Step 1: Calculate the distance the bird travels in the first southerly direction.
Distance = Speed × Time
Distance = 30 miles/hour × 10 hours = 300 miles

Step 2: Calculate the distance the bird travels in the northerly direction.
Distance = Speed × Time
Distance = 18 miles/hour × 2 hours = 36 miles

Step 3: Calculate the distance the bird travels in the final southerly direction.
Distance = Speed × Time
Distance = 22 miles/hour × 5 hours = 110 miles

Step 4: Calculate the total distance between the bird's northern and southern homes.
Total distance = Distance in
