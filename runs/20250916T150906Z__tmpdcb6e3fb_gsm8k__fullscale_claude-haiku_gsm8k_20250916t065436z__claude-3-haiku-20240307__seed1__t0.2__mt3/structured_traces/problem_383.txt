Okay, let's break down this problem step-by-step:

Given information:
- Millie spends $18 to buy supplies to make 3 pitchers of lemonade.
- Each pitcher holds 12 cups of lemonade.
- Millie sells each cup of lemonade for $1.
- Millie sells an average of 4 cups per hour.
- Millie sells all of the lemonade.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of cups of lemonade Millie can make.
Total cups of lemonade = 3 pitchers × 12 cups per pitcher = 36 cups

Step 2: Calculate the total revenue Millie will make from selling all the lemonade.
Total revenue = 36 cups × $1 per cup = $36

Step 3: Calculate Millie's profit per hour.
Profit per hour = Total revenue - Cost of supplies
Profit per hour = $36 - $18 = $18

Therefore, Millie will make a profit of $18 per hour that she spends running the lemonade stan

Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Millie spends $18 to make 3 pitchers of lemonade.
2. Each pitcher holds 12 cups of lemonade.
3. She sells each cup of lemonade for $1.
4. She sells an average of 4 cups per hour.

To calculate the profit per hour, we need to find the total revenue and total cost, then subtract the cost from the revenue.

Total Revenue:
* 3 pitchers x 12 cups per pitcher = 36 cups of lemonade
* 36 cups x $1 per cup = $36 total revenue

Total Cost:
* $18 spent on supplies

Profit per Hour:
* Total Revenue - Total Cost = $36 - $18 = $18
* Millie sells an average of 4 cups per hour
* $18 profit / 4 cups per hour = $4.50 profit per hour

Therefore, Millie will make $4.50 profit per hour that she spends running the lemonade stand.

Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Millie spends $18 to buy supplies for 3 pitchers of lemonade.
2. Each pitcher holds 12 cups of lemonade.
3. She sells each cup of lemonade for $1.
4. She sells an average of 4 cups per hour.

To calculate the profit per hour, we need to:
1. Calculate the total revenue from selling all the lemonade.
2. Subtract the initial cost of supplies.
3. Divide the profit by the number of hours the stand is open.

Step 1: Calculate the total revenue.
* Total cups of lemonade = 3 pitchers x 12 cups per pitcher = 36 cups
* Revenue = 36 cups x $1 per cup = $36

Step 2: Calculate the profit.
* Profit = Total revenue - Initial cost of supplies
* Profit = $36 - $18 = $18

Step 3: Calculate the profit per hour.
* Profit per hour = Profit / Hours the stand is open
