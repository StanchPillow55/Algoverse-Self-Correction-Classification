Okay, let's break down this problem step-by-step:

Given information:
- Adam bought new trousers for $30.
- His mother gave him $6 for this purpose.
- His father gave him twice as much as his mother.

Step 1: Calculate the amount of money Adam's father gave him.
Adam's father gave him twice as much as his mother, which means:
Amount from father = 2 Ã— $6 = $12

Step 2: Calculate the total amount of money Adam received from his parents.
Total amount from parents = Amount from mother + Amount from father
Total amount from parents = $6 + $12 = $18

Step 3: Calculate the amount of money Adam had to contribute from his savings.
Amount Adam had to contribute = Total cost of trousers - Total amount from parents
Amount Adam had to contribute = $30 - $18 = $12

Therefore, Adam had to contribute $12 from his savings to buy the new trousers.

Final answer: Adam had to contribute $12 from his savings to buy the new trousers.
