To solve this problem, we need to calculate the daily revenue for the factory when they were making tractors and compare it to the daily revenue when they are making silos. Then, we can find the percentage increase in daily revenue.

Given information:
- When making tractors, the factory sold 10 tractors per day and made $100 per tractor.
- Now, the factory sells 5 silos per day and makes $220 per silo.

Step 1: Calculate the daily revenue when making tractors.
Daily revenue when making tractors = Number of tractors sold per day × Price per tractor
Daily revenue when making tractors = 10 × $100 = $1,000

Step 2: Calculate the daily revenue when making silos.
Daily revenue when making silos = Number of silos sold per day × Price per silo
Daily revenue when making silos = 5 × $220 = $1,100

Step 3: Calculate the percentage increase in daily revenue.
Percentage increase in daily revenue = [(New daily revenue - Original daily revenue) / Original daily revenue] × 100
Percentage increase in daily revenue = [($

Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. When they made tractors:
   * They sold 10 tractors per day
   * They made $100 per tractor
   * Daily revenue = 10 tractors x $100 per tractor = $1,000 per day

2. Now they make silos:
   * They sell 5 silos per day
   * They make $220 per silo
   * Daily revenue = 5 silos x $220 per silo = $1,100 per day

3. To calculate the percentage increase:
   * Increase in daily revenue = $1,100 - $1,000 = $100
   * Percentage increase = (Increase in daily revenue) / (Original daily revenue) x 100
   * = ($100) / ($1,000) x 100
   * = 0.1 x 100
   * = 10%

Therefore, the factory is making 10% more per day now that they are making silos instead of tractors.

Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. When they made tractors:
   * They sold 10 tractors per day
   * They made $100 per tractor
   * Daily revenue = 10 tractors x $100 per tractor = $1,000 per day

2. Now they make silos:
   * They sell 5 silos per day
   * They make $220 per silo
   * Daily revenue = 5 silos x $220 per silo = $1,100 per day

3. To calculate the percentage increase:
   * Increase in daily revenue = $1,100 - $1,000 = $100
   * Percentage increase = (Increase in daily revenue) / (Original daily revenue) x 100
   * = ($100) / ($1,000) x 100
   * = 0.10 x 100
   * = 10%

Therefore, the factory is making 10% more per day now that they are making silos instead of tractors.
