To solve this problem, we need to find the relationship between the number of sandwiches and the price, and then use it to calculate the cost of the package with 8 sandwiches.

Given information:
- Package 1: 2 sandwiches for $3
- Package 2: 4 sandwiches for $6
- Package 3: 8 sandwiches, price not indicated

Step 1: Find the cost per sandwich.
Cost per sandwich = Price of package / Number of sandwiches in the package

For Package 1:
Cost per sandwich = $3 / 2 = $1.50 per sandwich

For Package 2:
Cost per sandwich = $6 / 4 = $1.50 per sandwich

Since the prices are proportional, the cost per sandwich is the same for all packages.

Step 2: Find the cost of the package with 8 sandwiches.
Cost of package with 8 sandwiches = Cost per sandwich × Number of sandwiches in the package
Cost of package with 8 sandwiches = $1.50 × 8 = $

Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. We have three different package sizes:
   - Package 1: 2 sandwiches for $3
   - Package 2: 4 sandwiches for $6
   - Package 3: 8 sandwiches, price not indicated

2. We know that the prices are proportional, which means that the cost per sandwich is the same across all three packages.

3. To find the cost per sandwich, we can use the information from the first two packages:
   - Package 1: 2 sandwiches for $3, so cost per sandwich = $3 / 2 = $1.50
   - Package 2: 4 sandwiches for $6, so cost per sandwich = $6 / 4 = $1.50

4. Since the cost per sandwich is the same across all packages, we can use this information to find the cost of the third package.
   - Package 3: 8 sandwiches
   - Cost per sandwich = $1.50
   - Total cost of Package 3 = 8

4. Since the cost per sandwich is the same for all three packages, we can use this information to find the cost of the third package.

5. The third package has 8 sandwiches, and the cost per sandwich is $1.50.
   - Cost of the third package = 8
