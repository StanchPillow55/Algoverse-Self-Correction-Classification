Okay, let's break down this problem step by step.

Given information:
- Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal.
- Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal.
- Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples.
- Andrea has 52 apples.

Step 1: Find the number of apples Jamal has.
Since Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal, we can use the following equation:
Andrea's apples = Jamal's apples + 8
52 = Jamal's apples + 8
Jamal's apples = 52 - 8 = 44 apples

Step 2: Find the number of bananas Jamal has.
Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples, so:
Jamal's bananas = Jamal's apples + 4
Jamal's bananas = 44 + 4 = 48 bananas

Step 3: Find the number of bananas Andrea has.
Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal

Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal
- Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal
- Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples
- Andrea has 52 apples

Step 1: Find how many apples Jamal has.
Since Andrea has 8 more apples than Jamal, we can subtract 8 from Andrea's 52 apples to find Jamal's apples.
Jamal's apples = Andrea's apples - 8
Jamal's apples = 52 - 8 = 44 apples

Step 2: Find how many bananas Jamal has.
Jamal has 4 more bananas than apples, so:
Jamal's bananas = Jamal's apples + 4
Jamal's bananas = 44 + 4 = 48 bananas

Step 3: Find how many bananas Andrea has.
Andrea has half as many bananas as Jamal, so:
