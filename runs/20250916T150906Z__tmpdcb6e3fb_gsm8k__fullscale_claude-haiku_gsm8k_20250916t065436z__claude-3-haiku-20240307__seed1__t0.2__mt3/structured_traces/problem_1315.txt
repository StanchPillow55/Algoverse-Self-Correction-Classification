Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Ana takes 3 minutes to peel an orange.
- Jane takes 4 minutes to peel an orange.
- Ana and Jane start peeling oranges at the same time.
- We need to find how many more oranges Ana will have peeled than Jane after an hour (60 minutes).

Step 1: Calculate how many oranges Ana can peel in 60 minutes.
Time available for Ana = 60 minutes
Time to peel 1 orange = 3 minutes
Number of oranges Ana can peel in 60 minutes = 60 minutes / 3 minutes per orange = 20 oranges

Step 2: Calculate how many oranges Jane can peel in 60 minutes.
Time available for Jane = 60 minutes
Time to peel 1 orange = 4 minutes
Number of oranges Jane can peel in 60 minutes = 60 minutes / 4 minutes per orange = 15 oranges

Step 3: Calculate the difference between the number of oranges peeled by

Number of oranges Ana can peel = 60 minutes / 3 minutes per orange = 20 oranges

Step 2: Calculate how many oranges Jane can peel in 60 minutes.
Time available for Jane = 60 minutes
Time to peel 1 orange = 4 minutes
Number of oranges Jane can peel = 60 minutes / 4 minutes per orange = 15 oranges

Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:
* Ana takes 3 minutes to peel one orange
* Jane takes 4 minutes to peel one orange
* They start peeling oranges at the same time

To find how many more oranges Ana will have peeled than Jane after an hour (60 minutes):

1) Calculate how many oranges Ana can peel in 60 minutes:
* Ana can peel 1 orange every 3 minutes
* In 60 minutes, Ana can peel 60 / 3 = 20 oranges

2) Calculate how many oranges Jane can peel in 60 minutes: 
* Jane can peel 1 orange every 4 minutes
* In 60 minutes, Jane can peel 60 / 4 = 15 oranges

3) Calculate the difference between the number of oranges peeled by Ana and Jane:
* Ana peeled 20 oranges, Jane peeled 15 oranges
* Difference = 20 - 15 = 5 oranges

Therefore, after an hour, Ana
