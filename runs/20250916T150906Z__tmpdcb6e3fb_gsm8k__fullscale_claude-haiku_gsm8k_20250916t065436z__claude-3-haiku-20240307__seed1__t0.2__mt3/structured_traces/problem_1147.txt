To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of picture scenes Lauren needs to create and then calculate the number of days it will take her to complete the project.

Given information:
- Lauren can draw 5 large-sized picture scenes per day, 6 medium-sized picture scenes per day, or 7 small-sized picture scenes per day.
- Lauren was hired to create 45 large-sized picture scenes, 36 medium-sized picture scenes, and 49 small-sized picture scenes.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of picture scenes Lauren needs to create.
Total number of picture scenes = 45 large-sized + 36 medium-sized + 49 small-sized
Total number of picture scenes = 45 + 36 + 49 = 130 picture scenes

Step 2: Calculate the number of days it will take Lauren to create all the picture scenes.
For large-sized picture scenes:
Number of days = 45 large-sized picture scenes / 5 large-sized picture scenes per day = 9 days

For medium-sized picture scenes:
Number of days = 36 medium

Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Lauren can draw:
   - 5 large-sized picture scenes per day
   - 6 medium-sized picture scenes per day
   - 7 small-sized picture scenes per day

2. She was hired to create:
   - 45 large-sized picture scenes
   - 36 medium-sized picture scenes
   - 49 small-sized picture scenes

3. To calculate the number of days it will take her to create all the picture scenes, we need to find the number of days required for each size of picture scene.

For the large-sized picture scenes:
- 45 large-sized picture scenes / 5 large-sized picture scenes per day = 9 days

For the medium-sized picture scenes:
- 36 medium-sized picture scenes / 6 medium-sized picture scenes per day = 6 days

For the small-sized picture scenes:
- 49 small-sized picture scenes / 7 small-sized picture scenes per day = 7 days

4. To find the total number of days, we ad

To find the total number of days it will take Lauren to create all the picture scenes, we need to calculate the number of days required for each size of picture scene and then add them together.

Step 1: Calculate the number of days required for the large-sized picture scenes.
Number of large-sized picture scenes = 45
Number of large-sized picture scenes per day = 5
Number of days required for large-sized picture scenes = 45 รท 5 = 9 days

Step 2: Calculate the number of days required for the medium-sized picture scenes.
Number of medium-sized picture scenes = 36
Number of medium-sized picture scenes per day =
