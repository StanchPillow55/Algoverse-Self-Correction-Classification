Okay, let's break down this problem step by step:

Given information:
- The initial temperature of the house is 40 degrees.
- Marcus spends 3 hours baking, and the oven raises the house's temperature by 5 degrees per hour.
- After baking, Marcus opens a window for 30 minutes, and the house cools down 2 degrees for every 10 minutes the window is open.

Step 1: Calculate the temperature increase due to the oven.
Temperature increase per hour = 5 degrees
Total time the oven is on = 3 hours
Total temperature increase = 5 degrees Ã— 3 hours = 15 degrees

Step 2: Calculate the new temperature after the oven is turned off.
Initial temperature = 40 degrees
Temperature increase due to the oven = 15 degrees
New temperature after the oven is turned off = 40 degrees + 15 degrees = 55 degrees

Step 3: Calculate the temperature decrease due to the open window.
Temperature decrease per 10 minutes = 2 degrees
Total time the window is open = 30

Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Initial house temperature: 40 degrees

2. Baking for 3 hours:
   - Every hour the oven is on, the house temperature increases by 5 degrees
   - So for 3 hours, the temperature increases by 3 x 5 = 15 degrees
   - New temperature: 40 + 15 = 55 degrees

3. Opening the window for 30 minutes:
   - The house cools down 2 degrees for every 10 minutes the window is open
   - For 30 minutes, the house cools down 2 x (30/10) = 6 degrees
   - New temperature: 55 - 6 = 49 degrees

Final answer: The house's final temperature is 49 degrees.
