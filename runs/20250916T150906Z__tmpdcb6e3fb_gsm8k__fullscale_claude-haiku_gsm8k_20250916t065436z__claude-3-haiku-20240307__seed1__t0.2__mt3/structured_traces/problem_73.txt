To solve this problem, we need to find the total cost of the cell phones, including the interest, and then divide it by the number of installments to get the monthly payment.

Given information:
- Shiela bought 5 cell phones.
- Each cell phone costs $150.
- The installment period is 3 months.
- The interest rate is 2% for each unit.

Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the cell phones without interest.
Total cost of cell phones = 5 × $150 = $750

Step 2: Calculate the interest for each cell phone.
Interest per cell phone = $150 × 0.02 = $3

Step 3: Calculate the total interest for all 5 cell phones.
Total interest = 5 × $3 = $15

Step 4: Calculate the total cost of the cell phones, including the interest.
Total cost = Total cost of cell phones + Total interest
Total cost = $750 + $15 = $765

Step 5: Calculate the monthly payment.
Monthly payment = Total cost / Number of installments
Monthly payment = $765 /

Okay, let's break down this problem step-by-step:

Given information:
- Shiela bought 5 cell phones
- Each cell phone costs $150
- The payment plan is for 3 months
- There is a 2% interest charge for each unit

Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the 5 cell phones without the interest.
Total cost of cell phones = 5 × $150 = $750

Step 2: Calculate the interest charge for each cell phone.
Interest charge per cell phone = 2% of $150 = 0.02 × $150 = $3

Step 3: Calculate the total interest charge for all 5 cell phones.
Total interest charge = 5 × $3 = $15

Step 4: Calculate the total amount Shiela will pay, including the interest.
Total amount to be paid = Total cost of cell phones + Total interest charge
Total amount to be paid = $750 + $15 = $765

Step 5: Calculate the monthly payment for the 3-month installment plan.
Monthly payment = Total amount to be paid / 3

Total amount to pay = Total cost of cell phones + Total interest charge
Total amount to pay = $750 + $15 = $765

Step 5: Calculate the monthly payment for the 3-month installment plan.
Monthly payment = Total amount to pay / 3 months
