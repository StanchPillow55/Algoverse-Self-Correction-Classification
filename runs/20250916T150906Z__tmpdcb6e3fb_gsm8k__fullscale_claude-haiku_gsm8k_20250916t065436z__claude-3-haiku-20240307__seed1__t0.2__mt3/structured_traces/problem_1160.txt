To solve this problem, we need to find the number of reports received on Wednesday by subtracting the total number of reports received on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday from the total number of reports received last week.

Given information:
- The IRS received a total of 5168 tax reports last week.
- On Monday and Tuesday, they received a total of 1907 reports.
- On Thursday and Friday, they received a total of 2136 reports.

Step 1: Find the total number of reports received on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday.
Total reports received on Monday and Tuesday = 1907
Total reports received on Thursday and Friday = 2136
Total reports received on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday = 1907 + 2136 = 4043

Step 2: Find the number of reports received on Wednesday.
Total reports received last week - Total reports received on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday = Reports received on Wednesday
5168 - 4043 = 1125

Therefore, the IRS received 1125 reports on Wednesday.
