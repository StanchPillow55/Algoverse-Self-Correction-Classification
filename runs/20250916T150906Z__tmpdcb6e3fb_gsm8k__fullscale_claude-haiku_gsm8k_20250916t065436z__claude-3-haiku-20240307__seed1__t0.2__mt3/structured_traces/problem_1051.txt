Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- Ingrid drinks 8 cups of water every day.
- There are 16 cups in a gallon.
- We need to find how many gallons of water she drinks in 30 days.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of cups of water Ingrid drinks in 30 days.
Cups of water per day × Number of days = Total cups of water
8 cups × 30 days = 240 cups

Step 2: Convert the total cups of water to gallons.
Total cups of water / Cups per gallon = Total gallons of water
240 cups / 16 cups per gallon = 15 gallons

Therefore, Ingrid drinks 15 gallons of water in 30 days.

Final answer: Ingrid drinks 15 gallons of water in 30 days.
