Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Mario has 6 sled dogs
- Each dog has 4 legs
- Each pair of snowshoes costs $12.00

To find the total cost of the snowshoes, we need to:
1. Calculate the total number of legs for all the dogs
2. Determine the number of pairs of snowshoes needed
3. Multiply the number of pairs by the cost per pair

Step 1: Calculate the total number of legs for all the dogs
Number of dogs × Number of legs per dog = Total number of legs
6 dogs × 4 legs per dog = 24 legs

Step 2: Determine the number of pairs of snowshoes needed
Total number of legs / Number of legs per pair of snowshoes = Number of pairs of snowshoes needed
24 legs / 4 legs per pair = 6 pairs of snowshoes

Step 3: Multiply the number of pairs by the cost per pair
Number of pairs × Cost per pair = Total cost
6 pairs × $12.00 per pair = $72.

Number of sled dogs × Number of legs per dog = Total number of legs
6 × 4 = 24 legs

Step 2: Determine the number of pairs of snowshoes needed
Total number of legs / Number of legs per pair of snowshoes = Number of pairs of snowshoes needed
24 legs / 4 legs per pair = 6 pairs of snowshoes

Step 3: Multiply the number of pairs of snowshoes by the cost per pair
Number of pairs of snowshoes × Cost per pair = Total cost

Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Mario has 6 sled dogs.
2. Each sled dog has 4 legs.
3. Each pair of snowshoes costs $12.00.

To calculate the total cost, we need to find the total number of legs that need snowshoes, and then multiply that by the cost per pair of snowshoes.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of legs that need snowshoes.
Total number of legs = 6 dogs x 4 legs per dog = 24 legs

Step 2: Calculate the number of pairs of snowshoes needed.
Since each pair of snowshoes covers 2 legs, we need to divide the total number of legs by 2 to get the number of pairs needed.
Number of pairs of snowshoes = 24 legs / 2 legs per pair = 12 pairs

Step 3: Calculate the total cost.
Total cost = 12 pairs x $12.00 per pair = $144.00

Therefore, the total cost for Mario to buy snowshoes for all 6 of his
