Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- Harry slept 9 hours last night.
- James slept only 2/3 of what Harry slept.

Step 1: Calculate how many hours James slept.
James slept 2/3 of what Harry slept.
Harry slept 9 hours.
So, James slept 2/3 Ã— 9 hours = 6 hours.

Step 2: Calculate the difference between the hours Harry and James slept.
Harry slept 9 hours.
James slept 6 hours.
The difference is 9 hours - 6 hours = 3 hours.

Therefore, the final answer is:
Harry slept 3 more hours than James.
