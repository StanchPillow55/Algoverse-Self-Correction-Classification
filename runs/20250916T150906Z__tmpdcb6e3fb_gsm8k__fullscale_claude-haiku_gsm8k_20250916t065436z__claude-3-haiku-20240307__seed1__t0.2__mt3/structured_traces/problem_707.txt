To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the amount of water Colorado City uses from the Colorado River.
2. Calculate the amount of water used for industrial purposes.
3. Calculate the amount of water used for non-industrial purposes.
4. Calculate the percentage of the river's total water used by the city for non-industrial purposes.

Step 1: Calculate the amount of water Colorado City uses from the Colorado River.
Colorado City uses 40% of the water from the Colorado River.
This means that Colorado City uses 40% of the river's total water.

Step 2: Calculate the amount of water used for industrial purposes.
80% of the water used by Colorado City is used for industrial purposes.
This means that 80% of the 40% of the river's total water used by the city is used for industrial purposes.

Step 3: Calculate the amount of water used for non-industrial purposes.
The remaining 20% of the 40% of the river's total water used by the city is used for non-industrial purposes.
This means that 20% of the 40% of the river's total water is used for non-

Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Colorado City uses 40% of the water from the Colorado River.
2. 80% of that 40% is used for industrial purposes.
3. To find the percentage of the river's total water that is used by the city for non-industrial purposes, we need to first find the percentage used for industrial purposes, then subtract that from the total 40%.

Step 1: Calculate the percentage used for industrial purposes.
40% of the river's water is used by Colorado City.
80% of that 40% is used for industrial purposes.
So, the percentage of the river's total water used for industrial purposes is:
40% Ã— 80% = 32%

Step 2: Calculate the percentage used for non-industrial purposes.
The total water used by Colorado City is 40%.
The water used for industrial purposes is 32%.
Therefore, the water used for non-industrial purposes is:
40% - 32% = 8%

Final answer: 8% of the Colorado River's total water is used by Colorado City for non-industrial purposes.
