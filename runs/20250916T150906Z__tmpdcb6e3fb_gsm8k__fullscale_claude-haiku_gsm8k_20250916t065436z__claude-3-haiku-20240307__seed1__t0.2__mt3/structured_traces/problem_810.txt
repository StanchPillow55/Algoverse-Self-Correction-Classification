Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- The number of students on campus doubles at the end of every month.
- There are 10 students on campus at the beginning of the year.

To find the additional students that joined by the end of May, above and beyond the initial 10 students, we need to calculate the number of students at the end of each month and then find the difference between the final number and the initial 10 students.

Step 1: Calculate the number of students at the end of each month.
End of January: 10 × 2 = 20 students
End of February: 20 × 2 = 40 students
End of March: 40 × 2 = 80 students
End of April: 80 × 2 = 160 students
End of May: 160 × 2 = 320 students

Step 2: Find the difference between the final number of students (at the end of May) and the initial 10 students.
Final number of students - Initial number of students = Additional students
320 - 10

Okay, let's work through this step-by-step:

1. We start with 10 students on campus at the beginning of the year.

2. At the end of the first month (January), the number of students doubles, so there are now 20 students.

3. At the end of the second month (February), the number of students doubles again, so there are now 40 students.

4. At the end of the third month (March), the number of students doubles again, so there are now 80 students.

5. At the end of the fourth month (April), the number of students doubles again, so there are now 160 students.

6. At the end of the fifth month (May), the number of students doubles again, so there are now 320 students.

To find the additional students that joined by the end of May, above and beyond the initial 10 students, we need to subtract the initial 10 students from the total number of students at the end of May:

320 students - 10 initial students = 310 additional students

Therefore, the final answer is that 310 additional students joined by the en
