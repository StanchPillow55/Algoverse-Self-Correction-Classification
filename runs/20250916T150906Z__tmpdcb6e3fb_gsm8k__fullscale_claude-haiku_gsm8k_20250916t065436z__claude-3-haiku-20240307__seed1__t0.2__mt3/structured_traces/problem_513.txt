Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- Julie had $500 initially.
- She spent 20% of it on clothes.
- She then spent 25% of the remaining money on CDs.

Step 1: Calculate the amount of money Julie spent on clothes.
20% of $500 = 0.20 × $500 = $100

Step 2: Calculate the amount of money Julie had left after buying clothes.
Amount of money left after buying clothes = $500 - $100 = $400

Step 3: Calculate the amount of money Julie spent on CDs.
25% of $400 = 0.25 × $400 = $100

Step 4: Calculate the amount of money Julie had left after buying CDs.
Amount of money left after buying CDs = $400 - $100 = $300

Therefore, Julie had $300 left.

Final answer: Julie had $300 left.
