Okay, let's break down this problem step by step:

Given information:
- Johnny has a Lego boxed set with 500 pieces.
- He has another Lego boxed set that has 3 times more pieces than the 500-piece set.
- He has another Lego boxed set that has 1/4 the number of pieces of the 500-piece set.

Step 1: Calculate the number of pieces in the second Lego boxed set.
Number of pieces in the second set = 3 × 500 = 1,500 pieces

Step 2: Calculate the number of pieces in the third Lego boxed set.
Number of pieces in the third set = 1/4 × 500 = 125 pieces

Step 3: Calculate the total number of Lego pieces Johnny picks up.
Total number of Lego pieces = 500 + 1,500 + 125 = 2,125 pieces

Therefore, Johnny picks up a total of 2,125 Lego pieces.

Final answer: Johnny picks up 2,125

Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Lego boxed set 1 has 500 pieces
- Lego boxed set 2 has 3 times more pieces than the 500 piece set
- Lego boxed set 3 has 1/4 the number of pieces as the 500 piece set

Step 1: Calculate the number of pieces in Lego boxed set 2.
Lego boxed set 2 has 3 times more pieces than the 500 piece set.
Number of pieces in Lego boxed set 2 = 500 × 3 = 1,500 pieces

Step 2: Calculate the number of pieces in Lego boxed set 3.
Lego boxed set 3 has 1/4 the number of pieces as the 500 piece set.
Number of pieces in Lego boxed set 3 = 500 ÷ 4 = 125 pieces

Step 3: Calculate the total number of Lego pieces Johnny picks up

Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. The first lego boxed set has 500 pieces.

2. The second lego boxed set has 3 times more pieces than the first one. 
   * 3 x 500 = 1,500 pieces

3. The third lego boxed set has 1/4 the number of pieces as the first one.
   * 1/4 x 500 = 125 pieces

4. To find the total number of pieces, we add up the pieces from all three sets:
   * 500 + 1,500 + 125 = 2,125 pieces

Therefore, the total number of lego pieces that Johnny picks up is 2,125.
