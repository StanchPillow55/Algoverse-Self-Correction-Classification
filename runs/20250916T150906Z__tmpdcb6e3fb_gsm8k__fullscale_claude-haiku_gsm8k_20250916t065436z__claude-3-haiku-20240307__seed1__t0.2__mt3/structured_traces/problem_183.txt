To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total time taken by each team to complete the 4 x 400 meter relay race and then find the difference between the two times to determine the winning margin.

Given information:
- Team 1 (well-rounded team): Each runner takes 55 seconds to complete their 400-meter leg.
- Team 2 (less well-rounded team): The first runner takes 60 seconds, and each subsequent runner is 3 seconds faster than the previous runner.

Step 1: Calculate the total time taken by Team 1 to complete the 4 x 400 meter relay.
Time taken by each runner = 55 seconds
Total time taken by Team 1 = 4 × 55 seconds = 220 seconds

Step 2: Calculate the total time taken by Team 2 to complete the 4 x 400 meter relay.
Time taken by the first runner = 60 seconds
Time taken by the second runner = 60 - 3 = 57 seconds
Time taken by the third runner = 57 - 3 = 54 seconds

- Team 2 (less well-rounded team): The first runner takes 60 seconds, and each subsequent runner is 3 seconds faster than the previous runner.

Step 1: Calculate the total time taken by Team 1.
Time taken by each runner = 55 seconds
Total time taken by Team 1 = 4 × 55 seconds = 220 seconds

Step 2: Calculate the total time taken by Team 2.
Time taken by the first runner = 60 seconds
Time taken by the second runner = 60 - 3 = 57 seconds
Time taken by the third runner = 57 - 3 = 54 seconds
Time taken by the fourth runner = 54 - 3 = 51 seconds
Total time taken by Team 2 = 60 + 57 + 54 +
