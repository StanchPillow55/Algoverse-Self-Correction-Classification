Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Chris has 6 trees in his yard.
- Ferdinand has half the number of trees that Chris has.
- Harry has 5 more than twice the number of trees that Ferdinand has.

Step 1: Calculate the number of trees Ferdinand has.
Ferdinand has half the number of trees that Chris has.
Ferdinand's trees = 6 รท 2 = 3 trees

Step 2: Calculate the number of trees Harry has.
Harry has 5 more than twice the number of trees that Ferdinand has.
Harry's trees = (2 ร 3) + 5 = 6 + 5 = 11 trees

Step 3: Calculate the difference between the number of trees in Harry's yard and Ferdinand's yard.
Difference = Harry's trees - Ferdinand's trees
Difference = 11 - 3 = 8 trees

Therefore, there are 8 more trees in Harry's yard than in Ferdinand's yard.

Final answer: There are 8 more trees in Harry's yard than in Ferdinand's yard.
