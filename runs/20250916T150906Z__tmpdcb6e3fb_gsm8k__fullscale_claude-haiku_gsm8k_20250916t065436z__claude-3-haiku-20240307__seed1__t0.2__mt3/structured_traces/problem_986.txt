Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Katherine has 5 hanging baskets to fill.
2. In each basket, she wants to add:
   - 3 petunias
   - 2 sweet potato vines
3. The petunias cost $3.00 apiece.
4. The sweet potato vines cost $2.50 apiece.

To calculate the total cost, we need to find the cost for each basket and then multiply it by the number of baskets.

Cost per basket:
- 3 petunias x $3.00 = $9.00
- 2 sweet potato vines x $2.50 = $5.00
- Total cost per basket = $9.00 + $5.00 = $14.00

Total cost for all 5 baskets:
- $14.00 per basket x 5 baskets = $70.00

Therefore, the total amount Katherine will spend filling all 5 hanging baskets is $70.00.
