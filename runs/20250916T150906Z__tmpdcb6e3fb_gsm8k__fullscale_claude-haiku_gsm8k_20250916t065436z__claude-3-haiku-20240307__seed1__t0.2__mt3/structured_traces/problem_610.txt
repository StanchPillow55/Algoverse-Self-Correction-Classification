Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- Cost to repave per meter: $194
- Length of Monica's street: 150 meters
- Length of Lewis' street: 490 meters

Step 1: Calculate the cost to repave Monica's street.
Cost to repave Monica's street = Cost per meter × Length of Monica's street
Cost to repave Monica's street = $194 × 150 meters = $29,100

Step 2: Calculate the cost to repave Lewis' street.
Cost to repave Lewis' street = Cost per meter × Length of Lewis' street
Cost to repave Lewis' street = $194 × 490 meters = $95,060
