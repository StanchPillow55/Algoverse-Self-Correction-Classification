To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of minutes John spends in class per week.
2. Calculate the total number of minutes John spends on extra learning time on Saturday and Sunday.
3. Add the total minutes spent in class and on extra learning time to get the total minutes spent learning per week.
4. Convert the total minutes spent learning per week to hours.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of minutes John spends in class per week.
* John has 8 classes per day (6 normal classes + 2 extra classes)
* Each class is 40 minutes long
* He goes to class for 5 days a week
* Total minutes in class per week = 8 classes × 40 minutes × 5 days = 1,600 minutes

Step 2: Calculate the total number of minutes John spends on extra learning time on Saturday and Sunday.
* John spends 1/16 of his weekly minutes on extra learning time on Saturday and Sunday
* Total minutes per week = 1,600 minutes
* Minutes spent on extra learning time = 1,600 minutes

Okay, let's break down this problem step by step and solve it completely.

Given information:
- There are 6 periods in a normal day for a student.
- John has to take 2 extra classes.
- Each class is 40 minutes long.
- He goes to class for 5 days a week.
- He spends 1/16 of his weekly minutes each on Saturday and Sunday as extra learning time.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of minutes John spends in class per day.
Number of periods per day = 6 + 2 = 8 periods
Duration of each period = 40 minutes
Total minutes per day = 8 periods × 40 minutes = 320 minutes

Step 2: Calculate the total number of minutes John spends in class per week.
Total minutes per week = Total minutes per day × 5 days = 320 minutes × 5 days = 1,600 minutes

Step 3: Calculate the total number of minutes John spends on extra learning time on Saturday and Sunday.
Total minutes per week = 1,600 minutes

Okay, let's break down this problem step by step:

Given information:
- There are 6 periods in a normal student's day.
- John has to take 2 extra classes.
- Each class is 40 minutes long.
- He goes to class for 5 days a week.
- He spends 1/16 of his weekly minutes each on Saturday and Sunday as extra learning time.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of minutes John spends in class per day.
Number of periods per day = 6 + 2 = 8 periods
Duration of each period = 40 minutes
Total minutes per day = 8 periods × 40 minutes = 320 minutes

Step 2: Calculate the total number of minutes John spends in class per week.
Total minutes per week = 320 minutes per day × 5 days = 1,600 minutes

Step 3: Calculate the total number of minutes John spends on extra learning time on Saturday and Sunday.
Total minutes per week = 1,600 minutes
Extra learning time per day = 1/16 of total minutes per week
