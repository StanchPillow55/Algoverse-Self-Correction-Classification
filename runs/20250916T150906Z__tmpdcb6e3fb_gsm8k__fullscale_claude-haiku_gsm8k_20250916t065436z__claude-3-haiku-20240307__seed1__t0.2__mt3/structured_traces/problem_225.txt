To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of days Andrew will travel if he goes to Rochester by bus and returns from Rochester by car.

Given information:
- It takes 6 days to travel from New Jersey to Rochester by bus.
- It takes half as many days to travel from New Jersey to Rochester by car.

Step 1: Calculate the number of days it takes to travel from New Jersey to Rochester by car.
Number of days by car = 6 days / 2 = 3 days

Step 2: Calculate the total number of days for the round trip.
Total days = Days to Rochester by bus + Days from Rochester by car
Total days = 6 days + 3 days = 9 days

Therefore, Andrew will travel for a total of 9 days if he plans to go to Rochester by bus and return from Rochester by car.

Final answer: Andrew will travel for a total of 9 days.
