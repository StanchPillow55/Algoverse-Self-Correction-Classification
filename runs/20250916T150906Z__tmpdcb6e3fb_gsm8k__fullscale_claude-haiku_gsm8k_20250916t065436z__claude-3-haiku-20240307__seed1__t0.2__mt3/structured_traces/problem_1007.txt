Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- There are 9 red sticks
- There are 5 more blue sticks than red sticks
- The number of yellow sticks is 3 less than the number of blue sticks

Step 1: Calculate the number of blue sticks.
Number of blue sticks = Number of red sticks + 5
Number of blue sticks = 9 + 5 = 14

Step 2: Calculate the number of yellow sticks.
Number of yellow sticks = Number of blue sticks - 3
Number of yellow sticks = 14 - 3 = 11

Step 3: Calculate the total number of sticks.
Total number of sticks = Number of red sticks + Number of blue sticks + Number of yellow sticks
Total number of sticks = 9 + 14 + 11 = 34

Therefore, the two friends have a total of 34 sticks.

Final answer: The two friends have a total of 34 sticks.
