Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- Sally buys one small pizza that costs $8.
- Sally buys one family-size pizza that costs 3 times as much as the small pizza.

Step 1: Calculate the cost of the family-size pizza.
Cost of family-size pizza = 3 × Cost of small pizza
Cost of family-size pizza = 3 × $8 = $24

Step 2: Calculate the total amount Sally spends.
Total amount spent = Cost of small pizza + Cost of family-size pizza
Total amount spent = $8 + $24 = $32

Therefore, the total amount Sally spends is $32.

Final answer: Sally spends a total of $32.
