Okay, let's solve this problem step-by-step.

Given information:
- Mark has $50 in his bank account.
- He earns $10 per day at his work.
- The bike he wants to buy costs $300.

To find the number of days Mark needs to save his money, we need to calculate how much more money he needs to save and then divide it by his daily earnings.

Step 1: Calculate the amount of money Mark needs to save.
Amount needed for the bike = $300
Amount Mark currently has = $50
Amount Mark needs to save = $300 - $50 = $250

Step 2: Calculate the number of days Mark needs to save.
Amount Mark needs to save = $250
Amount Mark earns per day = $10
Number of days needed to save = $250 / $10 = 25 days

Therefore, Mark needs to save for 25 days to be able to buy the bike that costs $300.

Final answer: Mark needs to save for 25 days to be able to buy the bike that costs $300.

Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Mark has $50 in his bank account.
2. He earns $10 per day at his work.
3. He wants to buy a bike that costs $300.

To find out how many days Mark needs to save his money, we need to calculate how much more money he needs to save to reach the $300 required for the bike.

* Amount needed for the bike: $300
* Amount Mark currently has: $50
* Amount Mark needs to save: $300 - $50 = $250

Now, we need to figure out how many days it will take Mark to save the remaining $250.

* Mark earns $10 per day
* $250 / $10 per day = 25 days

Therefore, Mark needs to save for 25 days to have enough money to buy the $300 bike.

Final answer: Mark needs to save for 25 days to have enough money to buy the $300 bike.

Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Mark has $50 in his bank account.
- He earns $10 per day at his work.
- The bike he wants to buy costs $300.

Step 1: Calculate how much more money Mark needs to save to buy the bike.
Cost of the bike - Amount in his bank account = Amount Mark needs to save
$300 - $50 = $250

Step 2: Calculate how much Mark earns per day.
Mark earns $10 per day at his work.

Step 3: Calculate how many days Mark needs to save to have the required $250.
Amount Mark needs to save / Amount Mark earns per day = Number of days
$250 / $10 per day = 25 days

Therefore, Mark needs to save for 25 days to have enough money to buy the $300 bike.

Final answer: Mark needs to save for 25 days to have enough money to buy the $300 bike.
