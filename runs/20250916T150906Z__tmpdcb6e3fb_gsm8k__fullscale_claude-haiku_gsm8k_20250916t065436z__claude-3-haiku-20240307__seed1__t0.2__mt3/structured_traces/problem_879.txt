Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Iris spent $400 to do her hair.
- Iris spent 1/4 as much to do a manicure.
- Iris spent 3/4 as much money as a manicure to do a pedicure.

Step 1: Calculate the cost of the manicure.
Cost of manicure = 1/4 of $400 = $100

Step 2: Calculate the cost of the pedicure.
Cost of pedicure = 3/4 of $100 = $75

Step 3: Calculate the total amount Iris spent at the spa.
Total amount spent = Cost of hair + Cost of manicure + Cost of pedicure
Total amount spent = $400 + $100 + $75 = $575

Therefore, Iris spent a total of $575 at the spa.
