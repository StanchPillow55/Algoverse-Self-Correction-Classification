Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- John drinks a bottle of water every half hour.
- A normal sudoku puzzle takes him 45 minutes.
- An extreme sudoku takes 4 times as long as a normal sudoku puzzle.

Step 1: Calculate the time it takes to solve an extreme sudoku puzzle.
Time for an extreme sudoku puzzle = 4 × 45 minutes = 180 minutes

Step 2: Convert the time for an extreme sudoku puzzle to hours.
Time for an extreme sudoku puzzle = 180 minutes / 60 minutes per hour = 3 hours

Step 3: Calculate the number of half-hour intervals in 3 hours.
Number of half-hour intervals = 3 hours × 2 intervals per hour = 6 intervals

Step 4: Calculate the number of bottles of water John drinks during the time it takes to solve an extreme sudoku puzzle.
Number of bottles of water = Number of half-hour intervals = 6 bottles

Therefore, John drinks 6 bottles of water while solving an extreme sudoku puzzle.
