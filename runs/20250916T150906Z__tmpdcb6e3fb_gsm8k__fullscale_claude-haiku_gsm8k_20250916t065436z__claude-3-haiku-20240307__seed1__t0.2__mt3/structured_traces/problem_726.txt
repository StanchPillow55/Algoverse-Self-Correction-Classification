To solve this problem, we need to find the length of one of Bobby's shoes given the information about the length of Topher's shoes.

Given information:
- The length of one of Topher's shoes is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of one of Bobby's shoes.
- The length of one of Topher's shoes is 8 feet and 4 inches.

Step 1: Convert the length of Topher's shoes from feet and inches to inches.
8 feet and 4 inches = (8 × 12) + 4 = 100 inches

Step 2: Find the length of one of Bobby's shoes.
Let the length of one of Bobby's shoes be x inches.
The length of one of Topher's shoes is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of one of Bobby's shoes.
Topher's shoe length = 9x + 10
100 inches = 9x + 10
9x = 100 - 10
9x = 90
x = 10 inches

Therefore, the length of one of Bobby's shoes is

Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- The length of one of Topher's shoes is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of one of Bobby's shoes.
- The length of one of Topher's shoes is 8 feet and 4 inches.

Step 1: Convert the length of Topher's shoe from feet and inches to just inches.
8 feet = 8 × 12 inches = 96 inches
4 inches
Total length of Topher's shoe = 96 inches + 4 inches = 100 inches

Step 2: Set up an equation to solve for the length of one of Bobby's shoes.
Let x = the length of one of Bobby's shoes in inches.
The length of one of Topher's shoes is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of one of Bobby's shoes.
100 inches = 9x + 10

Step 3: Solve the equation for x.
100 inches = 9x + 10
100 inches - 10 = 9x
90
