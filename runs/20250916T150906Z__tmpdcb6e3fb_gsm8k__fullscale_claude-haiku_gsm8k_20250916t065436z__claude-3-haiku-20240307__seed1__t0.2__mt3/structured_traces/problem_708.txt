Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- There are 7 days in a week.
- Alex charges $12 per day for tutoring.
- Alex is providing tutoring for 2 weeks.

To find the total amount Alex charges for 2 weeks of tutoring, we need to follow these steps:

Step 1: Calculate the number of days in 2 weeks.
Number of days in 2 weeks = 7 days per week × 2 weeks = 14 days

Step 2: Calculate the total amount Alex charges for 14 days of tutoring.
Total amount charged = Number of days × Charge per day
Total amount charged = 14 days × $12 per day = $168

Therefore, Alex charges $168 for 2 weeks of tutoring.

Final answer: Alex charges $168 for 2 weeks of tutoring.
