To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of chocolate bars produced in two weeks and then calculate the total revenue from selling all the bars.

Given information:
- The company can produce 5,000 chocolate bars per day.
- The company sells each chocolate bar for $2.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of chocolate bars produced in two weeks.
Number of days in two weeks = 14 days
Total number of chocolate bars produced in two weeks = 5,000 bars per day × 14 days = 70,000 bars

Step 2: Calculate the total revenue from selling all the produced chocolate bars.
Total revenue = Total number of chocolate bars produced × Price per bar
Total revenue = 70,000 bars × $2 per bar = $140,000

Therefore, the company will receive $140,000 for selling the produced chocolate bars during two weeks.

Final answer: The company will receive $140,000 for selling the produced chocolate bars during two weeks.

Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- The company can produce 5000 chocolate bars per day.
- The company sells each chocolate bar for $2.
- We need to find the total money the company will receive for selling the produced chocolate bars during two weeks.

Step 1: Calculate the number of chocolate bars produced in two weeks.
Number of days in two weeks = 14 days
Number of chocolate bars produced in two weeks = 5000 bars per day × 14 days = 70,000 bars

Step 2: Calculate the total money the company will receive for selling the produced chocolate bars.
Price per chocolate bar = $2
Total money received = Number of chocolate bars produced × Price per chocolate bar
Total money received = 70,000 bars × $2 per bar = $140,000

Therefore, the company will receive $140,000 for selling the produced chocolate bars during two weeks.
