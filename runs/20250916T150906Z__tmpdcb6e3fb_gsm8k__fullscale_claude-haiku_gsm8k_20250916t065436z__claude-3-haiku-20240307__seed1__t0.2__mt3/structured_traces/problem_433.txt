Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- 15 gallons of gas were equally divided into 5 different containers.
- Josey needed 1/4 of a container to run her lawnmower.

Step 1: Calculate the amount of gas in each container.
Total gas / Number of containers = Amount of gas per container
15 gallons / 5 containers = 3 gallons per container

Step 2: Calculate the amount of gas Josey needed.
1/4 of a container = 1/4 × 3 gallons = 0.75 gallons

Step 3: Convert the amount of gas Josey needed from gallons to pints.
1 gallon = 8 pints
0.75 gallons × 8 pints/gallon = 6 pints

Therefore, Josey needed 6 pints of gasoline to run her lawnmower.
