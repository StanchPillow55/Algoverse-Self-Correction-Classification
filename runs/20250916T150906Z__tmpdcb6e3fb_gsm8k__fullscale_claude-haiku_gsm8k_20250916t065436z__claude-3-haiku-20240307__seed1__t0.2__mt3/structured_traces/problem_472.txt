Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Matt can have half as many cookies as the number of carrot sticks he eats.
- Matt gets 2 extra cookies for cleaning his room.
- Matt wants to eat 5 cookies in total.

Let's define the variables:
- Let x = the number of carrot sticks Matt eats.
- Let y = the number of cookies Matt gets from the carrot sticks.
- Let z = the 2 extra cookies for cleaning his room.

Step 1: Find the number of cookies Matt gets from the carrot sticks.
y = 1/2 × x

Step 2: Find the total number of cookies Matt wants to eat.
Total cookies = Cookies from carrot sticks + Extra cookies
5 = y + z
5 = 1/2 × x + 2

Step 3: Solve for the number of carrot sticks Matt needs to eat.
5 = 1/2 × x + 2
3 = 1/2 × x
x = 6
