To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of units in the building and then subtract the number of occupied units to get the number of unoccupied units.

Given information:
- The building has 15 floors.
- Each floor contains 8 units.
- 3/4 of the building is occupied.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of units in the building.
Total number of units = Number of floors × Number of units per floor
Total number of units = 15 × 8 = 120 units

Step 2: Calculate the number of occupied units.
Occupied units = 3/4 of the total number of units
Occupied units = 3/4 × 120 = 90 units

Step 3: Calculate the number of unoccupied units.
Unoccupied units = Total number of units - Occupied units
Unoccupied units = 120 - 90 = 30 units

Therefore, the total number of unoccupied units in the building is 30 units.
