- She purchased a package of post-it notes at the store.
- At work, she placed a single post-it note on each of 220 different cups of coffee.
- She had 23 post-it notes remaining overall.

Step 1: Calculate the number of post-it notes used at work.
Number of post-it notes used at work = 220

Step 2: Calculate the total number of post-it notes Candice had before using them at work.
