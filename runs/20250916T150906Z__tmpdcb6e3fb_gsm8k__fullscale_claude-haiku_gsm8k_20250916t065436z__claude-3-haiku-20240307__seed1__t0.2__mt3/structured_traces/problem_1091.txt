Okay, let's solve this math problem step-by-step.

Given information:
- The apple orchard sells apples in bags of 10.
- The orchard sold a total of 2000 apples in one day.
- The price per bag is $5.

To find the total amount the orchard earned, we need to follow these steps:

Step 1: Calculate the number of bags sold.
Number of apples per bag = 10
Total number of apples sold = 2000
Number of bags sold = Total number of apples sold / Number of apples per bag
Number of bags sold = 2000 / 10 = 200 bags

Step 2: Calculate the total amount earned.
Price per bag = $5
Total amount earned = Number of bags sold × Price per bag
Total amount earned = 200 × $5 = $1,000

Therefore, the apple orchard earned $1,000 for selling 2000 apples in one day.

Final answer: The apple orchard earned $1,000 for selling 2000 apples in one day.

Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

1. We know that the orchard sells apples in bags of 10.
2. The orchard sold a total of 2000 apples in one day.
3. To find the number of bags sold, we need to divide the total number of apples by the number of apples per bag:
   * 2000 apples / 10 apples per bag = 200 bags

4. We also know that the price per bag is $5.
5. To find the total amount earned, we need to multiply the number of bags sold by the price per bag:
   * 200 bags x $5 per bag = $1000

Therefore, the orchard earned $1000 for selling 2000 apples in one day.
