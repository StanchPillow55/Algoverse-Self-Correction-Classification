Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- 40 customers came into the restaurant
- Each customer gave Rafaela a $20 tip
- Julieta received 10% less money in tips than Rafaela

Step 1: Calculate the total amount of tips Rafaela received.
Total tips for Rafaela = Number of customers × Tip per customer
Total tips for Rafaela = 40 × $20 = $800

Step 2: Calculate the total amount of tips Julieta received.
Julieta's tips = Rafaela's tips - 10% of Rafaela's tips
Julieta's tips = $800 - (0.10 × $800) = $800 - $80 = $720

Step 3: Calculate the total amount of tips Rafaela and Julieta received altogether.
Total tips = Rafaela's tips + Julieta's tips
Total tips = $800 + $720 = $1,520

Therefore, Julieta and Rafaela
