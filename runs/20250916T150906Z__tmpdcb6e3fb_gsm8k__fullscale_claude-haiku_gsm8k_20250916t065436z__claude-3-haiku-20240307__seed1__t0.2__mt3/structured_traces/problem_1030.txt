To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability of Marcus having to turn in his homework tomorrow.

Given information:
- There's a 50% chance that tomorrow he'll have a substitute teacher who won't collect the homework.
- Even if the normal teacher comes in, there's a 40% chance she'll give everyone an extension.
- Even if the whole class doesn't get an extension, there's a 20% chance Marcus can convince the teacher his dog ate his assignment and get a personal extension.

Step 1: Calculate the probability of Marcus not having to turn in his homework.
Probability of having a substitute teacher = 50% = 0.5
Probability of the normal teacher giving an extension = 40% = 0.4
Probability of getting a personal extension = 20% = 0.2

Probability of not having to turn in homework = Probability of having a substitute teacher + Probability of the normal teacher giving an extension + Probability of getting a personal extension
Probability of not having to turn in homework = 0.5 + (0.4 × 0.5) + (0.2 × 0.6)

Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. We have three possible scenarios that could happen:
   a. Substitute teacher comes in (50% chance)
   b. Normal teacher comes in, but gives an extension (40% chance)
   c. Normal teacher comes in, no extension, but Marcus convinces the teacher (20% chance)

2. Let's calculate the probability of each scenario:
   a. Substitute teacher comes in (50% chance): 
      - This means Marcus does not have to turn in his homework, so the probability is 50%.
   b. Normal teacher comes in, but gives an extension (40% chance):
      - This also means Marcus does not have to turn in his homework, so the probability is 40%.
   c. Normal teacher comes in, no extension, but Marcus convinces the teacher (20% chance):
      - This is the only scenario where Marcus has to turn in his homework.

3. To calculate the overall probability that Marcus will have to turn in his homework, we need to add up the probabilities of the scenarios where he does not have to turn it in, and subtract that from 100

Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. We have three possible scenarios that could happen:
   a. Substitute teacher (50% chance)
   b. Normal teacher with class extension (40% chance)
   c. Normal teacher without class extension, but Marcus gets a personal extension (20% chance)

2. To find the percentage chance that Marcus will have to turn in his homework, we need to find the probability of the one scenario where he doesn't get an extension.

3. Scenario A (Substitute teacher): If there is a substitute teacher, Marcus does not have to turn in his homework, so this scenario does not contribute to the final probability.

4. Scenario B (Normal teacher with class extension): If the normal teacher comes in and gives the class an extension, Marcus also does not have to turn in his homework, so this scenario also does not contribute to the final probability.

5. Scenario C (Normal teacher without class extension, but Marcus gets a personal extension): This is the only scenario where Marcus has to turn in his homework.

6. The probability of this scenario is 20%, or 0.20.

Therefore, the percentage chance that
