Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- Each tomato plant yields 22 tomatoes.
- Each eggplant plant yields 4 eggplants.
- Ricardo planted 5 tomato plants and 8 eggplant plants.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of tomatoes Ricardo can get from his tomato plants.
Number of tomato plants × Tomatoes per plant = Total tomatoes
5 × 22 = 110 tomatoes

Step 2: Calculate the total number of eggplants Ricardo can get from his eggplant plants.
Number of eggplant plants × Eggplants per plant = Total eggplants
8 × 4 = 32 eggplants

Step 3: Calculate the total number of fruits Ricardo can get from all his plants.
Total tomatoes + Total eggplants = Total fruits
110 + 32 = 142 fruits

Therefore, Ricardo can get a total of 142 fruits from his plants.
