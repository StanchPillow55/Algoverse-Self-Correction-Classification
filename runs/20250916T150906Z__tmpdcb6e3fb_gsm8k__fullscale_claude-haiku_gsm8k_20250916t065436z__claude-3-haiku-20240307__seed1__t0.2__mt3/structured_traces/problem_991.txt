To solve this problem, we need to find out how old Bill was when he saw the Comet for the first time.

Given information:
- Comet Halley orbits the sun every 75 years.
- Bill's dad saw the Comet when he was 30 years old.
- Bill saw the Comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the Comet.

Step 1: Find the age of Bill's dad when he saw the Comet for the second time.
Since Comet Halley orbits the sun every 75 years, Bill's dad would have seen the Comet again 75 years after his first sighting.
Age of Bill's dad when he saw the Comet for the second time = 30 + 75 = 105 years old

Step 2: Find the age of Bill when he saw the Comet for the second time.
Bill saw the Comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the Comet.
Age of Bill when he saw the Comet for the second time =

Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Comet Halley orbits the sun every 75 years.
- Bill's dad saw the Comet when he was 30 years old.
- Bill saw the comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the Comet.

Step 1: Calculate how old Bill's dad was when Bill saw the Comet for the second time.
Bill's dad was 30 years old when he first saw the Comet.
Bill saw the Comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he first saw the Comet.
Therefore, Bill saw the Comet a second time when his dad was 3 Ã— 30 = 90 years old.

Step 2: Calculate the time between Bill's dad seeing the Comet and Bill seeing the Comet a second time.
Time between Bill's dad seeing the Comet and Bill seeing the Comet a second time = 90 years - 30 years = 60 years

Step 3: Calculate how

Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Comet Halley orbits the sun every 75 years.
- Bill's dad saw the Comet when he was 30 years old.
- Bill saw the comet a second time when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the Comet.

To find Bill's age when he saw the Comet for the first time, we need to follow these steps:

Step 1: Calculate how many years it took for Bill's dad to see the Comet again.
Since Comet Halley orbits the sun every 75 years, we can calculate the number of years it took for Bill's dad to see the Comet again:
75 years - (30 years) = 45 years

Step 2: Calculate Bill's age when he saw the Comet for the second time.
We know that Bill saw the Comet when he was three times the age his father was when he saw the Comet.
Bill's dad was 30 years old when he saw the Comet, so:
