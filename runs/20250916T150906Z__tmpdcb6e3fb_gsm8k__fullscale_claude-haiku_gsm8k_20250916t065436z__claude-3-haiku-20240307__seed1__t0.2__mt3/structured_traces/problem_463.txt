Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- The cost of the pizza delivery is $15.
- Ashley wants to give a tip that is equal to 1/5 of the amount she ordered.

Step 1: Calculate the tip amount.
Tip amount = 1/5 of the pizza delivery cost
Tip amount = 1/5 Ã— $15 = $3

Step 2: Calculate the total amount Ashley should give the delivery man.
Total amount = Pizza delivery cost + Tip amount
Total amount = $15 + $3 = $18

Therefore, the total amount that Ashley should give the delivery man is $18.
