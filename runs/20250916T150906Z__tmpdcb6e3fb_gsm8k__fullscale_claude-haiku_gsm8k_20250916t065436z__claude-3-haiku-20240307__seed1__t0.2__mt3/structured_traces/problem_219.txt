turn 1
Okay, let's break down this problem step by step:

Given information:
- Four students scored a total of 251 points in a board game.
- Naomi scored 68 points.
- Yuri scored 10 more than half as many points as Naomi.
- Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi.

Step 1: Calculate how many points Yuri scored.
Yuri's points = (Naomi's points / 2) + 10
Yuri's points = (68 / 2) + 10 = 34 + 10 = 44 points

Step 2: Calculate how many points Brianna scored.
Brianna's points = Naomi's points + 17
Brianna's points = 68 + 17 = 85 points

Step 3: Calculate the total points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna.
Total points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna = Naomi's points + Yuri's points + Brianna's points
