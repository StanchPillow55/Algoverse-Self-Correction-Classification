Okay, let's break down this problem step by step.

Given information:
- Plane tickets cost $5000 each.
- The hotel is 20% more expensive than normal.
- The normal price of the hotel is $1500 per day.
- They are staying for 3 days.

Step 1: Calculate the cost of the plane tickets.
Since there are two plane tickets, the total cost of the plane tickets is:
2 × $5000 = $10,000

Step 2: Calculate the normal price of the hotel for 3 days.
Normal price of the hotel per day = $1500
Normal price of the hotel for 3 days = 3 × $1500 = $4,500

Step 3: Calculate the increased price of the hotel due to the 20% increase.
Increased price of the hotel per day = $1500 + (20% of $1500) = $1500 + $300 = $1800
Increased price of the hotel for 3 days = 3 × $1800 = $5,400

Step 4: Calculate the

Step 2: Calculate the normal cost of the hotel per day.
Normal cost of the hotel per day = $1500

Step 3: Calculate the increased cost of the hotel per day due to the 20% increase.
Increased cost of the hotel per day = $1500 + (20% of $1500)
Increased cost of the hotel per day = $1500 + $300 = $1800

Step 4: Calculate the total cost of the hotel for 3 days.
Total cost of the hotel = 3 × $1800 = $5,400

Okay, let's break down this problem step-by-step:

Given information:
- Plane tickets cost $5000 each.
- The hotel is 20% more expensive than normal.
- The normal price of the hotel is $1500 per day.
- They are staying for 3 days.

Step 1: Calculate the cost of the plane tickets.
Since there are two plane tickets, the total cost of the plane tickets is:
2 × $5000 = $10,000

Step 2: Calculate the normal cost of the hotel per day.
Normal hotel cost per day = $1500

Step 3: Calculate the increased cost of the hotel per day due to the 20% increase.
Increased hotel cost per day = $1500 + (20% of $1500)
Increased hotel cost per day = $1500 + $300 = $1800

Step 4: Calculate the total cost of the hotel for 3 days.
Total hotel cost = Increased hotel cost per day × Number of days
Total hotel cost = $1800 × 3 = $5,400
