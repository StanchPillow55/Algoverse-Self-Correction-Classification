To solve this problem, we need to find out how many days Jade will need to upload all 210 photos on her Instagram.

Given information:
- Jade took 210 photos in a week.
- She uploads 7 photos in one batch.
- She uploads 6 batches each day.

Step 1: Calculate the number of photos Jade can upload in one day.
Number of photos uploaded per day = Number of photos per batch × Number of batches per day
Number of photos uploaded per day = 7 × 6 = 42 photos

Step 2: Calculate the number of days needed to upload all 210 photos.
Number of days needed = Total number of photos / Number of photos uploaded per day
Number of days needed = 210 / 42 = 5 days

Therefore, Jade will need 5 days to upload all 210 photos on her Instagram.

Final answer: Jade will need 5 days to upload all 210 photos on her Instagram.

Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Jade took 210 photos in total.
2. She uploads 7 photos in one batch.
3. She uploads 6 batches each day.

To find the number of days needed to upload all 210 photos, we need to calculate the total number of photos uploaded per day, and then divide the total number of photos by the daily upload.

Total photos uploaded per day:
* 7 photos per batch x 6 batches per day = 42 photos per day

Total number of days needed:
* 210 total photos / 42 photos per day = 5 days

Therefore, Jade will need 5 days to upload all 210 of her photos to Instagram.
