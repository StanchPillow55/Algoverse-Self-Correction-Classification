To solve this problem, we need to find the number of years it will take for the revenue from selling the lemons to exceed the cost of planting and maintaining the lemon tree.

Given information:
- The cost of planting the lemon tree is $90.
- The tree will grow 7 lemons per year, which can be sold for $1.5 each.
- The annual cost of watering and feeding the tree is $3.

Step 1: Calculate the annual revenue from selling the lemons.
Annual revenue = Number of lemons per year × Price per lemon
Annual revenue = 7 × $1.5 = $10.5

Step 2: Calculate the annual net profit from the lemon tree.
Annual net profit = Annual revenue - Annual cost
Annual net profit = $10.5 - $3 = $7.5

Step 3: Calculate the number of years it will take to recover the initial cost of planting the tree.
Initial cost / Annual net profit = Number of years
$90 / $7.5 = 12 years

Therefore, it will take 12 years before Carlos starts earning

Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- The cost to plant the lemon tree is $90.
- The tree will grow 7 lemons per year, which can be sold for $1.5 each.
- It costs $3 per year to water and feed the tree.

To determine how many years it will take before Carlos starts earning money on the lemon tree, we need to find the point where the total revenue from selling the lemons exceeds the total cost of planting and maintaining the tree.

Step 1: Calculate the annual revenue from selling the lemons.
Annual revenue = Number of lemons per year × Price per lemon
Annual revenue = 7 × $1.5 = $10.5

Step 2: Calculate the annual cost of maintaining the tree.
Annual cost = Cost to water and feed the tree
Annual cost = $3

Step 3: Calculate the net annual profit.
Net annual profit = Annual revenue - Annual cost
Net annual profit = $10.5 - $3 = $7.5

Step 4: Calculate the number of years it will take to recover

Step 3: Calculate the net annual profit (or loss) from the lemon tree.
Net annual profit = Annual revenue - Annual cost
Net annual profit = $10.5 - $3 = $7.5
