To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of burritos consumed and then subtract it from the total number of burritos ordered to find the number of leftover burritos.

Given information:
- George ordered 600 burritos for the sixth-grade class picnic.
- There were 50 students at the picnic.
- Each student was given 10 burritos.
- Mr. George ate 20 burritos.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of burritos consumed by the students.
Number of burritos consumed by students = Number of students × Number of burritos per student
Number of burritos consumed by students = 50 × 10 = 500 burritos

Step 2: Calculate the total number of burritos consumed by Mr. George.
Number of burritos consumed by Mr. George = 20 burritos

Step 3: Calculate the total number of burritos consumed at the picnic.
Total burritos consumed = Burritos consumed by students + Burritos consumed by Mr. George
Total burritos consumed = 500

Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- George ordered 600 burritos for the sixth-grade class picnic.
- There were 50 students at the picnic.
- Each student was given 10 burritos.
- Mr. George ate 20 burritos.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of burritos given to the students.
Number of students × Number of burritos per student = Total burritos given to students
50 students × 10 burritos per student = 500 burritos

Step 2: Calculate the total number of burritos eaten by Mr. George.
Mr. George ate 20 burritos.

Step 3: Calculate the total number of burritos consumed at the picnic.
Total burritos given to students + Burritos eaten by Mr. George = Total burritos consumed
500 burritos + 20 burritos = 520 burritos

Step 4: Calculate the number of leftover burritos.
Total burritos ordered - Total burritos consumed =
