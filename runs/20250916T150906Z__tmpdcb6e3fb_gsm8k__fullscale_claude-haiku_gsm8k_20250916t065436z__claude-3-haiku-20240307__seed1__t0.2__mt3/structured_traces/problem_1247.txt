Okay, let's break down this problem step-by-step:

1. Brendan started with a bag of 10 marbles.

2. He dropped half of them when he tripped over a pebble. 
   * Half of 10 is 5.
   * So he dropped 5 marbles.

3. He was able to find 3 of the dropped marbles.
   * He started with 10 marbles, dropped 5, and found 3.
   * So he had 10 - 5 + 3 = 8 marbles at this point.

4. When he inspected the marbles further, he found that one of them was actually a bead, not a marble.
   * He had 8 marbles, and he got rid of 1 bead.
   * So he ended up with 8 - 1 = 7 marbles.

Therefore, the final answer is that Brendan ended up with 7 marbles.

Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Brendan started with a bag of 10 marbles.
2. He dropped half of them when he tripped over a pebble.
   * Half of 10 is 5, so he dropped 5 marbles.
   * He was left with 10 - 5 = 5 marbles.
3. He searched and found 3 of the dropped marbles.
   * So now he has 5 + 3 = 8 marbles.
4. When he inspected the marbles, he found that one of them was actually a bead, not a marble.
   * So he got rid of that one bead.
   * He was left with 8 - 1 = 7 marbles.

Therefore, the final number of marbles Brendan ended up with is 7.
