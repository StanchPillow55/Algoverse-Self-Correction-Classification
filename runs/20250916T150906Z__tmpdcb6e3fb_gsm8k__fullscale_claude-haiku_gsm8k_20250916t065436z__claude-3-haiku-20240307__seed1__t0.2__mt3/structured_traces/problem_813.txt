Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- The bag of marshmallows has 35 marshmallows.
- Each S'more uses one marshmallow.
- John makes 9 S'mores.
- DeSean makes 9 S'mores.
- They dropped 3 marshmallows on the ground.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of marshmallows used for the S'mores.
John's S'mores: 9 marshmallows
DeSean's S'mores: 9 marshmallows
Total marshmallows used for S'mores = 9 + 9 = 18 marshmallows

Step 2: Calculate the number of marshmallows dropped on the ground.
Marshmallows dropped on the ground = 3

Step 3: Calculate the total number of marshmallows used and dropped.
Total marshmallows used and dropped = Marshmallows used for S'mores + Marshmallows dropped
Total marshmallows used an

Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. The bag has 35 marshmallows total.
2. John makes 9 S'mores and DeSean makes 9 S'mores, so that's a total of 18 S'mores.
3. Each S'more uses 1 marshmallow, so 18 marshmallows were used for the S'mores.
4. They also dropped 3 marshmallows on the ground, so that's 3 more marshmallows gone.
5. In total, 18 + 3 = 21 marshmallows have been used or lost.
6. The original bag had 35 marshmallows, so the number of marshmallows left is 35 - 21 = 14.

Therefore, the number of S'mores that each kid can have with the marshmallows left in the bag is:
14 marshmallows / 1 marshmallow per S'more = 14 S'mores
Each kid can have 7 S'

Step 2: Calculate the number of marshmallows dropped on the ground.
Marshmallows dropped on the ground = 3

Step 3: Calculate the total number of marshmallows used and dropped.
Total marshmallows used and dropped = 18 (for S'mores) + 3 (dropped) = 21 marshmallows
