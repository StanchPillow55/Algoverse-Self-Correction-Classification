To solve this problem, we need to compare the cost of hiring an accountant versus the lost income from doing the taxes yourself.

Given information:
- If Jackie does the taxes herself, she'll lose 3 hours of freelance work.
- The hourly rate for her freelance work is $35/hour.
- The accountant charges $90.

Step 1: Calculate the lost income from doing the taxes herself.
Lost income = 3 hours Ã— $35/hour = $105

Step 2: Calculate the cost of hiring the accountant.
Cost of hiring the accountant = $90

Step 3: Compare the cost of hiring the accountant and the lost income from doing the taxes herself.
Cost of hiring the accountant = $90
Lost income from doing the taxes herself = $105
Difference = $105 - $90 = $15

Therefore, if Jackie hires the accountant, she will have $15 more than if she does the taxes herself.

Final answer: If Jackie hires the accountant, she will have $15 more than if she does the taxes herself.
