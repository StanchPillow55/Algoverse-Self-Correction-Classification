Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Mazie has 52 marbles.
- Mazie gives the marbles to twins, Dallas and Darla.
- Dallas has a total of 21 marbles after dropping 4 of them in the playground.

Step 1: Find how many marbles Dallas had before dropping 4 of them.
Dallas's final number of marbles = 21
Dallas dropped 4 marbles
Dallas's initial number of marbles = 21 + 4 = 25

Step 2: Find how many marbles Mazie gave to Dallas.
Mazie gave Dallas 25 marbles.

Step 3: Find how many marbles Mazie gave to Darla.
Mazie had a total of 52 marbles.
Mazie gave 25 marbles to Dallas.
Mazie gave the remaining marbles to Darla.
Marbles given to Darla = 52 - 25 = 27

Therefore, Mazie gave 27 marbles to Darla.
