Okay, let's break down this problem step by step:

Given information:
- Ronnie was given $5.
- Rissa was given thrice as much as Ronnie, which means Rissa was given $15.
- After each of them had given an equal amount of money to their little sister, Rissa is left with 4/5 of her money.

Step 1: Find the amount of money Ronnie and Rissa gave to their little sister.

Rissa's remaining money = 4/5 of $15 = $12
Rissa's remaining money = $15 - x

Therefore, $12 = $15 - x
x = $3

So, Ronnie and Rissa each gave $3 to their little sister.

Step 2: Find the amount of money Ronnie has left.
Ronnie's initial money = $5
Ronnie's remaining money = $5 - $3 = $2

Therefore, the amount
