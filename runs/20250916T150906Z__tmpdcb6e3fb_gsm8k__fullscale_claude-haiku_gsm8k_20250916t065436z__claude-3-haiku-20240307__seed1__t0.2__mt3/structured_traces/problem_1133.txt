To solve this problem, we need to find the time it takes for Grandma to complete the entire 3-mile walk.

Given information:
- Grandma walks 3 miles every day on her favorite walking trail.
- The trail includes 2 miles of walking on the beach and 1 mile of walking on the sidewalk.
- Grandma walks at twice the rate of speed on the sidewalk compared to the beach.
- Grandma spends 40 minutes of her walk on the beach.

Step 1: Find the time it takes for Grandma to walk the 2 miles on the beach.
Time spent on the beach = 40 minutes

Step 2: Find the time it takes for Grandma to walk the 1 mile on the sidewalk.
Since Grandma walks at twice the rate of speed on the sidewalk compared to the beach, the time it takes her to walk the 1 mile on the sidewalk will be half the time it takes her to walk the 2 miles on the beach.
Time spent on the sidewalk = 40 minutes / 2 = 20 minutes

Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Grandma walks 3 miles every day on her favorite walking trail.
- The trail includes 2 miles of walking on the beach and 1 mile of walking on the sidewalk.
- Grandma walks at twice the rate of speed on the sidewalk compared to the beach.
- Grandma spends 40 minutes walking on the beach.

Step 1: Calculate the time it takes Grandma to walk the 1 mile on the sidewalk.
Since Grandma walks at twice the rate of speed on the sidewalk compared to the beach, we can use the following equation:
Time on sidewalk = Time on beach / 2
Time on sidewalk = 40 minutes / 2 = 20 minutes

Step 2: Calculate the total time it takes Grandma to complete the 3-mile walk.
Total time = Time on beach + Time on sidewalk
Total time = 40 minutes + 20 minutes = 60 minutes

Therefore, it takes Grandma 60 minutes to complete the entire 3-mile
