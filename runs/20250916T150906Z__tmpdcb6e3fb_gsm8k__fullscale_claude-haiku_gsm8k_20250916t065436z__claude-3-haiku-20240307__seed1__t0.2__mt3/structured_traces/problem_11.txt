Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

Given information:
- Toula bought 3 dozen donuts at $68 per dozen.
- Toula bought 2 dozen mini cupcakes at $80 per dozen.
- Toula bought 6 dozen mini cheesecakes at $55 per dozen.

Step 1: Calculate the cost of the donuts.
Cost of donuts = 3 dozen × $68 per dozen = $204

Step 2: Calculate the cost of the mini cupcakes.
Cost of mini cupcakes = 2 dozen × $80 per dozen = $160

Step 3: Calculate the cost of the mini cheesecakes.
Cost of mini cheesecakes = 6 dozen × $55 per dozen = $330

Step 4: Calculate the total cost.
Total cost = Cost of donuts + Cost of mini cupcakes + Cost of mini cheesecakes
Total cost = $204 + $160 + $330 = $694

Therefore, the total cost of the pastries Toula bought at the bakery is $
