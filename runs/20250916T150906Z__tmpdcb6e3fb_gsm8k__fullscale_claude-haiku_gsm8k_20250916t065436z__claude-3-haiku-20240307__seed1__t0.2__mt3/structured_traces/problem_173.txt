To solve this problem, we need to find the total minimum payment for all of Jessica's debts, then calculate the amount she wants to pay, which is 50% more than the minimum. Finally, we'll calculate the total amount she pays in a year.

Given information:
- Student loan minimum payment: $300/month
- Credit card minimum payment: $200/month
- Mortgage minimum payment: $500/month
- Jessica wants to pay 50% more than the minimum

Step 1: Calculate the total minimum payment for all of Jessica's debts.
Student loan minimum payment + Credit card minimum payment + Mortgage minimum payment = Total minimum payment
$300 + $200 + $500 = $1,000/month

Step 2: Calculate the amount Jessica wants to pay, which is 50% more than the minimum.
Total minimum payment + 50% of total minimum payment = Amount Jessica wants to pay
$1,000 + (0.5 × $1,000) = $1,000 + $500 = $1,500/month

Step 3: Calculate the total amount Jessica pays in a year.

Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Student loan minimum payment: $300/month
- Credit card minimum payment: $200/month
- Mortgage minimum payment: $500/month
- Jessica wants to pay 50% more than the minimum

Step 1: Calculate the total minimum payment per month.
Student loan minimum + Credit card minimum + Mortgage minimum = Total minimum payment
$300 + $200 + $500 = $1,000/month

Step 2: Calculate the additional 50% payment per month.
Total minimum payment × 0.5 = Additional 50% payment
$1,000 × 0.5 = $500/month

Step 3: Calculate the total monthly payment.
Total minimum payment + Additional 50% payment = Total monthly payment
$1,000 + $500 = $1,500/month

Step 4: Calculate the total payment in a year.
Total monthly payment × 12 months = Total payment in a year
$1,500 × 12 = $18,000

Therefore, the total amount Jessica pays in a year
