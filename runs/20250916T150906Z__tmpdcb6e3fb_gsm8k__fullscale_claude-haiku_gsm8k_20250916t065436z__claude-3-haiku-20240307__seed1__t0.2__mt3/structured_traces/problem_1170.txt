To solve this problem, we need to find the amount of red paint used in the mural.

Given information:
- The mural has four different colors of paint: red, white, purple, and yellow.
- There are equal amounts of red, white, and purple paint in the mural.
- Half the mural is yellow.
- The mural used 12 pints of paint in total.

Step 1: Determine the amount of each color of paint used.
Since there are equal amounts of red, white, and purple paint, and half the mural is yellow, we can divide the total amount of paint as follows:
- Red, white, and purple paint: 1/2 of 12 pints = 6 pints
- Yellow paint: 1/2 of 12 pints = 6 pints

Step 2: Determine the amount of red paint used.
Since the red, white, and purple paint are in equal amounts, each color accounts for 1/3 of the 6 pints.
Amount of red paint = 1/3 of 6 pints = 2 p
