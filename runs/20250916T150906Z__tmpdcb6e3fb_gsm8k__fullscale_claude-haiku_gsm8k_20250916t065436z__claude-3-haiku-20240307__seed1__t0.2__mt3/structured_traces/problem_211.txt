To solve this problem, we need to find the number of red chickens that Jerry has.

Given information:
- Red chickens produce 3 eggs per day.
- White chickens produce 5 eggs per day.
- Jerry collects 42 eggs per day.
- Jerry has two more white chickens than red chickens.

Let's define the variables:
- Let x be the number of red chickens.
- Let x + 2 be the number of white chickens.

Step 1: Set up an equation to represent the total number of eggs collected per day.
Total eggs collected per day = (Number of red chickens × 3) + (Number of white chickens × 5)
42 = (x × 3) + ((x + 2) × 5)

Step 2: Simplify the equation.
42 = 3x + 5x + 10
42 = 8x + 10

Step 3: Solve the equation for x.
42 - 10 = 8x
32 = 8x
x = 4

Therefore, Jerry has 4
