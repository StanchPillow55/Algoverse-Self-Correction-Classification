To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the distance Tyson runs per day with the coach's advice.
2. Calculate the total distance Tyson runs in a month (June) with the coach's advice.

Step 1: Calculate the distance Tyson runs per day with the coach's advice.
* Tyson originally runs 5000 meters per day.
* The coach wants him to run 1/5 times more meters in a day.
* 1/5 of 5000 meters = 1000 meters.
* So, the new distance Tyson runs per day is 5000 meters + 1000 meters = 6000 meters.

Step 2: Calculate the total distance Tyson runs in a month (June) with the coach's advice.
* June has 30 days.
* Tyson runs 6000 meters per day.
* Total distance covered in June = 6000 meters × 30 days = 180,000 meters.

Therefore, the total distance Tyson covered in June with the coach's advice is 180,000

Okay, let's break down this problem step by step:

Given information:
- Tyson runs 5000 meters every day.
- His coach wants him to run 1/5 times more meters in a day.
- Tyson trains for a month (June).

Step 1: Calculate the additional distance Tyson needs to run per day based on his coach's advice.
Additional distance per day = 1/5 × 5000 meters = 1000 meters

Step 2: Calculate the total distance Tyson runs per day with the coach's advice.
Total distance per day = 5000 meters + 1000 meters = 6000 meters

Step 3: Calculate the total distance Tyson covers in June.
Number of days in June = 30 days
Total distance covered in June = 6000 meters × 30 days = 180,000 meters

Therefore, the total distance Tyson covered in June, following his coach's advice, is 180,000 meters.

Okay, let's break down this problem step by step:

Given information:
- Tyson runs 5000 meters every day.
- His coach wants him to run 1/5 times more meters in a day.
- We need to find the total distance he covered in June.

Step 1: Calculate the additional distance Tyson needs to run per day based on his coach's advice.
Additional distance per day = 1/5 × 5000 meters = 1000 meters

Step 2: Calculate the total distance Tyson runs per day with the coach's advice.
Total distance per day = 5000 meters + 1000 meters = 6000 meters

Step 3: Calculate the total distance Tyson covered in June.
Number of days in June = 30 days
Total distance covered in June = 6000 meters × 30 days = 180,000 meters

Therefore, the total distance Tyson covered in June, following his coach's advice, is 180,000 meters.
