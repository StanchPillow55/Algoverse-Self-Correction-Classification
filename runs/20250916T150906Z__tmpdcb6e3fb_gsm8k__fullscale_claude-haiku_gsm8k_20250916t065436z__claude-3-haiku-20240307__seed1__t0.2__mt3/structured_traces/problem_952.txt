To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of reports Vince can staple in the given time frame.

Given information:
- Vince can staple 30 reports every 15 minutes.
- Vince was stapling reports from 8:00 AM until 11:00 PM.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of hours Vince was stapling reports.
Total time = 11:00 PM - 8:00 AM = 15 hours

Step 2: Convert the total time from hours to minutes.
Total time in minutes = 15 hours × 60 minutes/hour = 900 minutes

Step 3: Calculate the number of 15-minute intervals in the total time.
Number of 15-minute intervals = 900 minutes / 15 minutes = 60 intervals

Step 4: Calculate the total number of reports Vince can staple.
Total reports stapled = Number of 15-minute intervals × Reports stapled per interval
Total reports stapled = 60 intervals × 30 reports/interval = 1,800 reports

Therefore,

Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Vince can staple 30 reports every 15 minutes.
- Vince was stapling reports from 8:00 AM until 11:00 PM.

To find the total number of reports Vince stapled, we need to calculate the number of 15-minute intervals in the time period and multiply it by the number of reports he can staple in each interval.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of hours Vince was stapling reports.
Time period = 11:00 PM - 8:00 AM = 15 hours

Step 2: Convert the total number of hours to minutes.
Total minutes = 15 hours × 60 minutes/hour = 900 minutes

Step 3: Calculate the number of 15-minute intervals in the total time period.
Number of 15-minute intervals = 900 minutes / 15 minutes per interval = 60 intervals

Step 4: Calculate the total number of reports Vince stapled.
Number of reports stapled per interval = 30 reports

Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Vince can staple 30 reports every 15 minutes.
   * This means he can staple 120 reports per hour (30 reports x 4 quarters per hour).

2. Vince was stapling reports from 8:00 AM until 11:00 PM.
   * This is a total of 15 hours (11:00 PM - 8:00 AM = 15 hours).

3. To calculate the total number of reports stapled:
   * Vince can staple 120 reports per hour.
   * He worked for 15 hours.
   * So the total number of reports stapled is:
     * 120 reports/hour x 15 hours = 1,800 reports.

Therefore, the final answer is:
Vince stapled a total of 1,800 reports.
