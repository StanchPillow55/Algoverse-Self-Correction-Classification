Okay, let's break down this problem step by step and solve it completely.

Given information:
- The three friends spent $20.25 on 3 tickets to the fair.
- They spent $4.50 less on food than on the tickets.
- They went on 2 different rides, which cost $33 for each ride.
- They agreed to split all the costs evenly.

Step 1: Calculate the cost of the tickets per person.
Cost of 3 tickets = $20.25
Cost of 1 ticket = $20.25 / 3 = $6.75
Cost of tickets per person = $6.75

Step 2: Calculate the cost of the food.
Cost of food = Cost of tickets - $4.50
Cost of food = $20.25 - $4.50 = $15.75

Step 3: Calculate the cost of the rides.
Cost of 2 rides = $33 × 2 = $66

Step 4: Calculate the total cost of the fair.
Total cost = Cost of tickets + Cost of food + Cost of rides

- They spent $4.50 less on food than on the tickets.
- They went on 2 different rides, which cost $33 for each ride.
- They agreed to split all the costs evenly.

Step 1: Calculate the cost of the tickets.
Cost of 3 tickets = $20.25
Cost of 1 ticket = $20.25 / 3 = $6.75

Step 2: Calculate the cost of the food.
Cost of food = Cost of tickets - $4.50
Cost of food = $20.25 - $4.50 = $15.75

Step 3: Calculate the total cost of the fair visit.
Total cost = Cost of tickets + Cost of food + Cost of rides
Total cost = $20.25 + $15.75 + ($33 × 2) = $102.00

Step 4: Calculate the amount each friend paid.

Step 4: Calculate the amount each friend paid.
Amount paid by each friend = Total cost / 3
Amount paid by each friend = $102.00 / 3
