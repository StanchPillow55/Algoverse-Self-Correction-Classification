To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of dumplings that Larry cooked.

Given information:
- There are 8 males, including Larry, and 6 females.
- Each male ate 1 more dumpling than each female.
- Each female ate 3 dumplings.
- There were no leftovers.

Step 1: Find the number of dumplings eaten by the females.
Number of females × Number of dumplings per female = Total dumplings eaten by females
6 × 3 = 18 dumplings

Step 2: Find the number of dumplings eaten by the males.
Since each male ate 1 more dumpling than each female, we can calculate the number of dumplings per male as:
Number of dumplings per male = Number of dumplings per female + 1
Number of dumplings per male = 3 + 1 = 4 dumplings

Now, we can calculate the total dumplings eaten by the males:
Number of males × Number of dumplings per male = Total dumplings eaten by males
8

Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. We know that there are 8 males, including Larry, and 6 females.
2. Each male ate 1 more dumpling than each female.
3. Each female ate 3 dumplings.

To find the total number of dumplings cooked, we need to calculate the total number of dumplings eaten by the males and the females.

For the females:
* 6 females x 3 dumplings each = 18 dumplings

For the males:
* Each male ate 1 more dumpling than each female, so 4 dumplings each.
* 8 males x 4 dumplings each = 32 dumplings

Total dumplings cooked:
* 18 dumplings (females) + 32 dumplings (males) = 50 dumplings

Therefore, Larry cooked 50 dumplings for the group of friends, and there were no leftovers.

- There are 8 males, including Larry, and 6 females in the group.
- Each male ate 1 more dumpling than each female.
- Each female ate 3 dumplings.
- There were no leftovers.

Step 1: Calculate the number of dumplings eaten by the females.
Number of females = 6
Each female ate 3 dumplings
Total dumplings eaten by females = 6 × 3 = 18 dumplings

Step 2: Calculate the number of dumplings eaten by the males.
Number of males = 8
Each male ate 1 more dumpling than each female
