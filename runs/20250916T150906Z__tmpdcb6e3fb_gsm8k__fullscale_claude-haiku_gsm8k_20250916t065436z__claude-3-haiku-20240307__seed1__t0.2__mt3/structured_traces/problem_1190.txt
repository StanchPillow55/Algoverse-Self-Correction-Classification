To solve this problem, we need to keep track of the number of bandages used and ordered on each day, and then use the information provided to find the total number of bandages they started with on the first day.

Given information:
- On the first day, the nurses used 38 bandages and ordered one bulk pack of 50 bandages.
- On the second day, they used 10 fewer bandages than the first day.
- On the third day, they ordered two bulk packs of 50 bandages and used half a pack.
- They had 78 bandages left at the end of the third day.

Step 1: Calculate the number of bandages used on the second day.
Bandages used on the second day = 38 - 10 = 28 bandages

Step 2: Calculate the number of bandages used on the third day.
Bandages used on the third day = 0.5 Ã— 50 = 25 bandages

Step 3: Calculate the total number of bandages ordered.
Bandages ordered on the first day = 1 Ã— 50 = 50

Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Day 1:
* The nurses used 38 bandages
* They ordered 1 bulk pack of 50 bandages

Day 2:
* They used 10 fewer bandages than Day 1, so they used 38 - 10 = 28 bandages

Day 3:
* They ordered 2 bulk packs of 50 bandages each, so 2 * 50 = 100 bandages
* They used half a pack, so 50 / 2 = 25 bandages

At the end of Day 3, they had 78 bandages left.

To find the total number of bandages they started with on the first day, we need to add up all the bandages used and the bandages left:

Bandages used:
* Day 1: 38
* Day 2: 28
* Day 3: 25
Total bandages used = 38 + 28 + 25 = 91

Bandages left at end of Day 3: 78
