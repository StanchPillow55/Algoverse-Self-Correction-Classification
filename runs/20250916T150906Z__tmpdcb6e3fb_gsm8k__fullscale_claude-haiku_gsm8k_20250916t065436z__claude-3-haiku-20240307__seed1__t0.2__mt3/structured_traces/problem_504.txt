Okay, let's break down this problem step by step:

Given information:
- Suzie bought 4 packs of gum in total.
- She bought 2 packs of strawberry gum.
- She paid $2 for a pack of grape gum.
- She paid half as much for a small pack of green apple gum.
- She paid $7 in total.

Step 1: Calculate the cost of the green apple gum.
Since Suzie paid half as much for the green apple gum, we can assume the cost of the green apple gum was $1.

Step 2: Calculate the cost of the grape gum.
We know that the grape gum cost $2.

Step 3: Calculate the total cost of the strawberry gum.
We know that Suzie paid $7 in total, and the cost of the grape gum was $2 and the cost of the green apple gum was $1.
Total cost of strawberry gum = $7 - $2 - $1 = $4

Step 4: Calculate the cost of each pack of strawberry g

Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Suzie bought 4 packs of gum in total
- 2 packs were strawberry flavor
- 1 pack was grape flavor, which cost $2
- 1 pack was green apple flavor, which cost half as much as the grape flavor

To find the cost of each pack of strawberry gum, we need to:
1. Calculate the total cost of the non-strawberry gum
2. Subtract the non-strawberry gum cost from the total amount paid ($7)
3. Divide the remaining amount by the number of strawberry gum packs (2)

Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the non-strawberry gum
- Grape gum: $2
- Green apple gum: $2 / 2 = $1
Total cost of non-strawberry gum = $2 + $1 = $3

Step 2: Subtract the non-strawberry gum cost from the total amount paid
Total amount paid = $7
Cost of non-strawberry gum = $

Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Suzie bought 4 packs of gum in total
- 2 packs were strawberry flavor
- 1 pack was grape flavor and cost $2
- 1 pack was green apple flavor and cost half as much as the grape flavor

To find the cost of each pack of strawberry gum, we need to:
1. Calculate the total cost of the non-strawberry gum
2. Subtract the non-strawberry gum cost from the total amount paid ($7)
3. Divide the remaining amount by the number of strawberry gum packs (2)

Step 1: Calculate the total cost of the non-strawberry gum
- Grape gum: $2
- Green apple gum: $2 / 2 = $1
Total non-strawberry gum cost = $2 + $1 = $3

Step 2: Subtract the non-strawberry gum cost from the total amount paid
Total amount paid = $7
Non-strawberry gum cost = $3
