Okay, let's break down this problem step by step:

Given information:
- John has 13 Lego sets.
- He sells each Lego set for $15.
- He buys 8 video games for $20 each.
- He has $5 left after buying the video games.

Step 1: Calculate the total amount of money John made from selling the Lego sets.
Total money from Lego sets = Number of Lego sets × Price per Lego set
Total money from Lego sets = 13 × $15 = $195

Step 2: Calculate the total amount of money John spent on the video games.
Total money spent on video games = Number of video games × Price per video game
Total money spent on video games = 8 × $20 = $160

Step 3: Calculate the amount of money John has left after buying the video games.
Money left = Total money from Lego sets - Total money spent on video games
Money left = $195 - $160 = $35

Step 4: Determine how many Lego sets John still has.
