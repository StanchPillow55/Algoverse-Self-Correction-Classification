Okay, let's solve this math problem step-by-step.

Given information:
- Ray had 25 lollipops.
- He kept 5 lollipops for himself.
- He shared the remaining lollipops equally with his four friends.

Step 1: Calculate the number of lollipops Ray had left to share with his friends.
Total lollipops - Lollipops kept for himself = Lollipops to be shared
25 lollipops - 5 lollipops = 20 lollipops

Step 2: Divide the remaining lollipops equally among his four friends.
Lollipops to be shared / Number of friends = Lollipops each friend received
20 lollipops / 4 friends = 5 lollipops per friend

Therefore, each of Ray's four friends received 5 lollipops.

Final answer: Each of Ray's four friends received 5 lollipops.
