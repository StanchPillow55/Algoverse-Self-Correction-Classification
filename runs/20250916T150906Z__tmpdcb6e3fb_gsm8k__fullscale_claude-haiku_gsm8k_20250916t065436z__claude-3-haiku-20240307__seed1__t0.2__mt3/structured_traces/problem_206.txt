To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total distance Micheal rode his bike over the two different time periods.

Given information:
- For the first four weeks, Micheal rode his bike at least 5 times a week, making 25 kilometers each time.
- For the next three weeks, Micheal rode his bike 2 times a week, making 60 kilometers each time.

Step 1: Calculate the total distance Micheal rode his bike in the first four weeks.
Distance per ride × Number of rides per week × Number of weeks = Total distance in the first four weeks
25 kilometers × 5 rides per week × 4 weeks = 500 kilometers

Step 2: Calculate the total distance Micheal rode his bike in the next three weeks.
Distance per ride × Number of rides per week × Number of weeks = Total distance in the next three weeks
60 kilometers × 2 rides per week × 3 weeks = 360 kilometers

Step 3: Calculate the total distance Micheal rode his bike in both time periods.
Total distance in the first four weeks + Total distance in the next three weeks = Total distance

Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Step 1: Calculate the distance Micheal rode in the first 4 weeks.
* Micheal rode the bike 5 times a week, and each time he rode 25 kilometers.
* So, in one week, he rode 5 x 25 = 125 kilometers.
* In 4 weeks, he rode 4 x 125 = 500 kilometers.

Step 2: Calculate the distance Micheal rode in the next 3 weeks.
* Micheal rode the bike 2 times a week, and each time he rode 60 kilometers.
* So, in one week, he rode 2 x 60 = 120 kilometers.
* In 3 weeks, he rode 3 x 120 = 360 kilometers.

Step 3: Calculate the total distance Micheal rode.
* Total distance = Distance in first 4 weeks + Distance in next 3 weeks
* Total distance = 500 kilometers + 360 kilometers = 860 kilometers

Therefore, the total distance
