Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Kelsie made two times more cookies than Josh.
- Josh made one-fourth the number of cookies that Suzanne made.
- Suzanne made 36 cookies.

Step 1: Find how many cookies Josh made.
Since Josh made one-fourth the number of cookies that Suzanne made, we can calculate this as:
Josh's cookies = 1/4 × Suzanne's cookies
Josh's cookies = 1/4 × 36 = 9 cookies

Step 2: Find how many cookies Kelsie made.
Since Kelsie made two times more cookies than Josh, we can calculate this as:
Kelsie's cookies = 2 × Josh's cookies
Kelsie's cookies = 2 × 9 = 18 cookies

Therefore, Kelsie made 18 cookies.

Final answer: Kelsie made 18 cookies.
