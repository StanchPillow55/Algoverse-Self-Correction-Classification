To solve this problem, we need to find the total volume of the hole that Bob wants to dig and then calculate the time it will take him to dig the entire hole.

Given information:
- The hole is 6 feet long, 4 feet wide, and 3 feet deep.
- It takes Bob 3 seconds to shovel a cubic foot of earth.

Step 1: Calculate the total volume of the hole.
Volume of the hole = Length × Width × Depth
Volume of the hole = 6 feet × 4 feet × 3 feet
Volume of the hole = 72 cubic feet

Step 2: Calculate the time it will take Bob to dig the entire hole.
Time to dig the hole = Volume of the hole × Time to shovel a cubic foot of earth
Time to dig the hole = 72 cubic feet × 3 seconds/cubic foot
Time to dig the hole = 216 seconds

Step 3: Convert the time from seconds to minutes and seconds.
Time to dig the hole in minutes and seconds = 216 seconds
Minutes = 216 seconds ÷ 60 seconds/minute =

Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Determine the volume of the hole that Bob needs to dig:
   * Length: 6 feet
   * Width: 4 feet
   * Depth: 3 feet
   * Volume = Length x Width x Depth
   * Volume = 6 feet x 4 feet x 3 feet
   * Volume = 72 cubic feet

2. Determine how long it takes Bob to shovel 1 cubic foot of earth:
   * Bob takes 3 seconds to shovel 1 cubic foot of earth

3. Determine how long it will take Bob to dig the entire hole:
   * Total volume of the hole: 72 cubic feet
   * Time to shovel 1 cubic foot: 3 seconds
   * Total time to dig the hole = Total volume x Time per cubic foot
   * Total time to dig the hole = 72 cubic feet x 3 seconds/cubic foot
   * Total time to dig the hole = 216 seconds

4. Convert the total time from seconds to minutes and seconds:

Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Calculate the volume of the hole:
   * Length: 6 feet
   * Width: 4 feet
   * Depth: 3 feet
   * Volume = Length x Width x Depth
   * Volume = 6 ft x 4 ft x 3 ft = 72 cubic feet

2. Calculate the time it takes to dig the hole:
   * It takes Bob 3 seconds to shovel 1 cubic foot of earth
   * To dig the entire hole (72 cubic feet), it will take:
   * Time = Volume x Time per cubic foot
   * Time = 72 cubic feet x 3 seconds/cubic foot = 216 seconds

3. Convert the time from seconds to minutes and seconds:
   * 216 seconds = 3 minutes and 36 seconds

Therefore, it will take Bob 3 minutes and 36 seconds to dig the hole.
