To solve this problem, we need to find the time it took Anna to complete the puzzle.

Given information:
- Steve took 10 hours to complete the puzzle.
- Anna took 2 hours more than half of Steve's time to complete the puzzle.

Step 1: Find half of Steve's time.
Half of Steve's time = 10 hours / 2 = 5 hours

Step 2: Find the time it took Anna to complete the puzzle.
Anna's time = Half of Steve's time + 2 hours
Anna's time = 5 hours + 2 hours = 7 hours

Therefore, it took Anna 7 hours to finish the difficult puzzle.

Final answer: It took Anna 7 hours to complete the puzzle.
