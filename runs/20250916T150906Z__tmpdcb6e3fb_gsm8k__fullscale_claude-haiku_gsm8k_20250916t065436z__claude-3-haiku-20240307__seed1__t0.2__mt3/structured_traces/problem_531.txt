To solve this problem, we need to follow the given information step by step and calculate the number of passengers on the bus after the second stop.

Given information:
- Initially, there are 48 people riding the bus.
- At the first stop, 8 passengers get off, and 5 times as many people as the number who got off get into the bus.
- At the second stop, 21 passengers get off, and 3 times fewer passengers get on.

Step 1: Calculate the number of passengers on the bus after the first stop.
Number of passengers who got off at the first stop = 8
Number of passengers who got on at the first stop = 5 × 8 = 40
Number of passengers on the bus after the first stop = 48 - 8 + 40 = 80

Step 2: Calculate the number of passengers on the bus after the second stop.
Number of passengers who got off at the second stop = 21
Number of passengers who got on at the second stop = 40 ÷ 3 = 13.33 (rounded down to 13)

Okay, let's solve this step-by-step:

1. Initial number of passengers on the bus: 48

2. First stop:
   - 8 passengers get off the bus
   - 5 times as many people as the number who got off (8) get into the bus
   - Number of people who got on = 5 × 8 = 40
   - Number of passengers on the bus after the first stop = 48 - 8 + 40 = 80

3. Second stop:
   - 21 passengers get off the bus
   - 3 times fewer passengers get on compared to the number who got off
   - Number of people who got on = (21 / 3) = 7
   - Number of passengers on the bus after the second stop = 80 - 21 + 7 = 66

Therefore, the final number of passengers riding the bus after the second stop is 66.
