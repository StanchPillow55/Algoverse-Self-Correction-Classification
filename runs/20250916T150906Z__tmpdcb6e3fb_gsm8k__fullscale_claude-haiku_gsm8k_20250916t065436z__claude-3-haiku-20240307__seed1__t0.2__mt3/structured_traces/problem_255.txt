To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of cows in the 10 stalls initially.
2. Calculate the number of cows in each stall after Mr. Sylas adds the 40 new cows.
3. Calculate the number of cows in 8 of the stalls.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of cows in the 10 stalls initially.
* 10 stalls with 20 cows each
* Total cows = 10 × 20 = 200 cows

Step 2: Calculate the number of cows in each stall after Mr. Sylas adds the 40 new cows.
* Total cows after adding 40 = 200 + 40 = 240 cows
* Number of stalls = 20
* Cows per stall = 240 ÷ 20 = 12 cows

Step 3: Calculate the number of cows in 8 of the stalls.
* Number of cows in 8 stalls = 8 ×

Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. We have 10 stalls, each with 20 cows.
   * Total number of cows in the 10 stalls = 10 stalls x 20 cows per stall = 200 cows

2. Mr. Sylas buys 40 additional cows.
   * He divides these 40 cows equally among the 20 stalls (the original 10 stalls plus the 10 new stalls he created).
   * So each stall gets an additional 40 / 20 = 2 cows.

3. Now, each stall has:
   * Original 20 cows
   * Plus 2 additional cows
   * Total of 22 cows per stall

4. The question asks how many cows are in 8 of the stalls.
   * 8 stalls x 22 cows per stall = 176 cows

Therefore, the final answer is 176 cows in 8 of the stalls.

Okay, let's break down this problem step-by-step:

Given information:
- There are 10 stalls, each with 20 cows.
- Mr. Sylas buys 40 additional cows.
- Mr. Sylas divides the 40 new cows equally among the 20 stalls.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of cows in the 10 stalls before Mr. Sylas bought the additional 40 cows.
Total cows in 10 stalls = 10 stalls × 20 cows per stall = 200 cows

Step 2: Calculate the total number of cows in the 20 stalls after Mr. Sylas bought the additional 40 cows.
Total cows in 20 stalls = 200 cows (from step 1) + 40 new cows = 240 cows

Step 3: Calculate the number of cows in each stall after the 40 new cows are divided equally.
Cows per stall = Total cows in 20 stalls
