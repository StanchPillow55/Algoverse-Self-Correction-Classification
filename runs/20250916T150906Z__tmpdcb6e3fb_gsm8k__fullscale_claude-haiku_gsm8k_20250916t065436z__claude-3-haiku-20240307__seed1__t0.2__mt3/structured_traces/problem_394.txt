Okay, let's break down this problem step-by-step:

Given information:
- Wendy wants to place 20 more than double the number of books in a shelving system.
- The shelving system has 6 rows and 6 columns.

Step 1: Determine the total number of spaces in the shelving system.
Total number of spaces = Number of rows × Number of columns
Total number of spaces = 6 × 6 = 36 spaces

Step 2: Calculate the number of books that is double the number of spaces.
Double the number of spaces = 2 × 36 = 72 books

Step 3: Add 20 more books to the double of the number of spaces.
Number of books needed = Double the number of spaces + 20
Number of books needed = 72 + 20 = 92 books

Therefore, Wendy will need to carry 92 books to complete her task.

Final answer: Wendy will need to carry 92 books to complete her task.

Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Wendy wants to place 20 more than double the number of books.
   * Let's call the number of books "x".
   * Wendy wants to place 2x + 20 books.

2. The shelving system has 6 rows and 6 columns.
   * This means the shelving system can hold 6 x 6 = 36 books.

3. Wendy wants to fill the shelving system completely.
   * So, the number of books she needs to carry is 2x + 20 = 36.

4. Solving for x:
   * 2x + 20 = 36
   * 2x = 16
   * x = 8

Therefore, Wendy needs to carry 8 books to complete her task.

Final answer: Wendy needs to carry 8 books to complete her task.
