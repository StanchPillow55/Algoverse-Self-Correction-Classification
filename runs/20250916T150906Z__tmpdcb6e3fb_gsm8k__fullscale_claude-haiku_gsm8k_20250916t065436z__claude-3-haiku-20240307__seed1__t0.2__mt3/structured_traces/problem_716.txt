Okay, let's solve this problem step-by-step.

Given information:
- John makes a 6 egg omelet.
- The omelet contains 2 oz of cheese and an equal amount of ham.
- Eggs are 75 calories each.
- Cheese is 120 calories per ounce.
- Ham is 40 calories per ounce.

Step 1: Calculate the calories from the eggs.
Calories from eggs = 6 eggs × 75 calories per egg = 450 calories

Step 2: Calculate the calories from the cheese.
Calories from cheese = 2 oz × 120 calories per ounce = 240 calories

Step 3: Calculate the calories from the ham.
Calories from ham = 2 oz × 40 calories per ounce = 80 calories

Step 4: Calculate the total calories in the omelet.
Total calories = Calories from eggs + Calories from cheese + Calories from ham
Total calories = 450 + 240 + 80 = 770 calories

Therefore, the omelet contains 770 calories
