Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Chester eats 3 eggs a day for the first 30 days.
- Then, Chester increases his egg consumption to 5 eggs a day for the next 30 days.
- We need to find the total number of dozens of eggs Chester will need for 60 days.

Step 1: Calculate the number of eggs Chester eats in the first 30 days.
Eggs per day × Number of days = Total eggs in first 30 days
3 eggs × 30 days = 90 eggs

Step 2: Calculate the number of eggs Chester eats in the next 30 days.
Eggs per day × Number of days = Total eggs in next 30 days
5 eggs × 30 days = 150 eggs

Step 3: Calculate the total number of eggs Chester eats in 60 days.
Total eggs in first 30 days + Total eggs in next 30 days = Total eggs in 60 days
90 eggs + 150 eggs = 240 eggs
