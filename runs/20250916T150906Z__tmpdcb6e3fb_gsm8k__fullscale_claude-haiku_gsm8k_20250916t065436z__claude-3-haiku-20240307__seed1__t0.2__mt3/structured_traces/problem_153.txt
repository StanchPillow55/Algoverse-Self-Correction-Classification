To solve this problem, we need to work backward from the final amount of french fries left to find the original number of fries in the pack.

Given information:
- Dave ate 14 fries before the seagull stole the pack.
- The seagull ate half the amount of fries that Dave ate.
- Three pigeons each ate 3 fries.
- The raccoon stole two-thirds of the remaining fries.
- Ants carried off one final fry, leaving 5 fries behind.

Step 1: Calculate the number of fries the seagull ate.
Seagull ate = 1/2 × 14 = 7 fries

Step 2: Calculate the number of fries remaining after the seagull's theft.
Remaining fries = 14 - 7 = 7 fries

Step 3: Calculate the number of fries eaten by the three pigeons.
Pigeons ate = 3 × 3 = 9 fries

Step 4: Calculate the number of fries remaining after the pigeons' theft.

Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Dave ate 14 french fries before the seagull stole the pack.

2. The seagull then ate half the amount that Dave ate, which is 14 / 2 = 7 french fries.
   * Remaining fries = Original amount - Dave's eaten - Seagull's eaten
   * Remaining fries = Original amount - 14 - 7 = Original amount - 21

3. Three pigeons then each ate 3 fries, so 3 x 3 = 9 fries were eaten by the pigeons.
   * Remaining fries = Original amount - 21 - 9 = Original amount - 30

4. A raccoon then stole two-thirds of the remaining fries.
   * Remaining fries = Original amount - 30
   * Raccoon took two-thirds of (Original amount - 30)
   * Remaining fries = (Original amount - 30) - (2/3 * (Original amount - 30))
   * Remaining
