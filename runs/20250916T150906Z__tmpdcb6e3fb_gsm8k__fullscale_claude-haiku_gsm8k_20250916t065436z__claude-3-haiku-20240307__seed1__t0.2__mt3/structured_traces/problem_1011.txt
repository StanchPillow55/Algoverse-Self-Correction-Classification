To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of water pumped into the tank over the two days and then subtract it from the tank's capacity to find the remaining gallons of water needed to fill the tank.

Given information:
- The tank's capacity is 18,000 gallons.
- On the first day:
  - Wanda filled 1/4 of the tank's capacity with water.
  - Ms. B pumped 3/4 as much water as Wanda.
- On the second day:
  - Wanda pumped 2/3 of the amount of water she pumped on the previous day.
  - Ms. B pumped 1/3 of the number of gallons she pumped on the first day.

Step 1: Calculate the amount of water pumped on the first day.
Wanda's contribution on the first day:
1/4 of 18,000 gallons = 4,500 gallons

Ms. B's contribution on the first day:
3/4 of Wanda's contribution = 3/4 × 4,500

Okay, let's break down this problem step by step.

Given information:
- The tank has a capacity of 18,000 gallons.
- On the first day:
  - Wanda filled 1/4 of the tank's capacity with water.
  - Ms. B pumped 3/4 as much water as Wanda.
- On the second day:
  - Wanda pumped 2/3 of the amount of water she pumped on the previous day.
  - Ms. B pumped 1/3 of the number of gallons she pumped on the first day.

Step 1: Calculate the amount of water Wanda pumped on the first day.
1/4 of 18,000 gallons = 0.25 × 18,000 = 4,500 gallons

Step 2: Calculate the amount of water Ms. B pumped on the first day.
Ms. B pumped 3/4 as much as Wanda, so:
3/4 × 4,500 gallons = 3,375 gallons
