To solve this problem, we need to find the number of each type of bike sold and then calculate the total revenue earned by Marcel.

Given information:
- The price of one MTB is $500.
- The price of one BMX is half the price of an MTB, which is $250.
- The price of one Trekking bike is $450.
- The total number of bikes sold is 300.
- Half of the bikes sold were Trekking bikes.
- 15% of the bikes sold were BMX bikes.

Step 1: Calculate the number of each type of bike sold.
Total number of bikes sold = 300

Number of Trekking bikes sold = 50% of 300 = 150 bikes

Number of BMX bikes sold = 15% of 300 = 0.15 × 300 = 45 bikes

Number of MTB bikes sold = Total bikes - Trekking bikes - BMX bikes
Number of MTB bikes sold = 300 - 150 - 45 = 105 bikes

Step 2: Calculate the total revenue earned by Marcel.

Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Price of one MTB bike: $500
- Price of one BMX bike: half the price of an MTB, which is $250
- Price of one Trekking bike: $450
- Total number of bikes sold in one month: 300
- Half of the bikes sold were Trekking bikes
- 15% of the bikes sold were BMX bikes
- The remaining bikes sold were MTB type

Step 1: Calculate the number of each type of bike sold.
Total bikes sold = 300
Trekking bikes sold = 50% of 300 = 150
BMX bikes sold = 15% of 300 = 45
MTB bikes sold = Total - Trekking - BMX = 300 - 150 - 45 = 105

Step 2: Calculate the total revenue from each type of bike.
Revenue from Trekking bikes = 150 × $450 = $67,500
Revenue from BMX bikes = 45 × $250 = $11,250

Okay, let's break down this problem step-by-step:

Given information:
- The price of one MTB bike is $500.
- The price of one BMX bike is half the price of an MTB, which is $250.
- The price of one Trekking bike is $450.
- In one month, Marcel sold a total of 300 bikes.
- Half of the bikes sold were Trekking bikes.
- 15% of the bikes sold were BMX bikes.
- The remaining bikes sold were MTB type.

Step 1: Calculate the number of each type of bike sold.
Total bikes sold = 300

Trekking bikes sold = 50% of 300 = 150 bikes
BMX bikes sold = 15% of 300 = 45 bikes
MTB bikes sold = Total bikes - Trekking bikes - BMX bikes = 300 - 150 - 45 = 105 bikes

Step 2: Calculate the total revenue from selling each type of bike.
Revenue from Trekking bikes = 150 bikes × $450 = $67
