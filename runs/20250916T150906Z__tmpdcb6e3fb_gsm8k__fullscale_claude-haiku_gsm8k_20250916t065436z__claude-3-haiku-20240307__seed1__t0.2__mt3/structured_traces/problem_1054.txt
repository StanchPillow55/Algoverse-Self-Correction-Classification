To solve this problem, we need to find the number of tiles required to cover the kitchen floor and then calculate the total cost of the tiles.

Given information:
- The total area of the kitchen floor is 200 square feet (SqFt).
- The cost of each square floor tile is $12.
- Each tile side is 1 foot (ft) in length.

Step 1: Calculate the number of tiles required to cover the kitchen floor.
Since the tiles are square and each side is 1 foot in length, the area of each tile is 1 SqFt.
Number of tiles required = Total area of the kitchen floor / Area of each tile
Number of tiles required = 200 SqFt / 1 SqFt
Number of tiles required = 200 tiles

Step 2: Calculate the total cost of the tiles.
Total cost = Number of tiles required × Cost per tile
Total cost = 200 tiles × $12 per tile
Total cost = $2,400

Therefore, the total cost to renovate the kitchen floor with the new square floor tiles will be $2,400.

Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- The total area of the kitchen floor is 200 square feet (SqFt).
- The new square floor tiles cost $12 each.
- Each tile side is 1 foot (ft) in length.

Step 1: Calculate the number of tiles needed to cover the floor.
Since each tile side is 1 ft, the area of each tile is 1 ft × 1 ft = 1 SqFt.
To find the number of tiles needed, we divide the total floor area by the area of each tile:
Number of tiles = Total floor area / Area of each tile
Number of tiles = 200 SqFt / 1 SqFt = 200 tiles

Step 2: Calculate the total cost of the tiles.
Total cost = Number of tiles × Cost per tile
Total cost = 200 tiles × $12 per tile = $2,400

Therefore, the total cost to renovate the kitchen floor with the new square floor tiles will be $2,400.
