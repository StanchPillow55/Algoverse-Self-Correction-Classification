To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Find the number of likes after 3 weeks.
2. Add the new 20,000 likes to the total number of likes.

Step 1: Find the number of likes after 3 weeks.
* Initial number of likes: 2,000
* After 3 weeks, the number of likes was 70 times as many as the initial number of likes.
* Number of likes after 3 weeks = 2,000 × 70 = 140,000

Step 2: Add the new 20,000 likes to the total number of likes.
* Total number of likes = 140,000 + 20,000 = 160,000

Therefore, the total number of Instagram likes is 160,000.

Final answer: 160,000 Instagram likes.

Okay, let's break down this problem step by step:

Given information:
- Fishio received 2000 likes on her photo after 1 week.
- Three weeks later, the number of likes was 70 times as many as the initial number of likes.
- Fishio recently received 20,000 more new likes.

Step 1: Calculate the number of likes after 3 weeks.
Initial number of likes = 2000
Number of likes after 3 weeks = 70 × 2000 = 140,000 likes

Step 2: Calculate the total number of likes after the recent 20,000 new likes.
Total number of likes = Initial number of likes + New likes
Total number of likes = 140,000 + 20,000 = 160,000 likes

Therefore, the final answer is that Fishio's Instagram post has a total of 160,000 likes.
