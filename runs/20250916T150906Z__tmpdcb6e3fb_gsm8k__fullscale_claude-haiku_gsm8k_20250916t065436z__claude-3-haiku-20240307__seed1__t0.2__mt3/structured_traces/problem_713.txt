To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total area of the bathroom.
2. Calculate the area that needs to be covered with mosaic tiles.
3. Calculate the number of mosaic tiles required.

Step 1: Calculate the total area of the bathroom.
Total area of the bathroom = 36 sq ft

Step 2: Calculate the area that needs to be covered with mosaic tiles.
Mr. Boarden needs to cover two-thirds of the bathroom.
Area to be covered = 2/3 × 36 sq ft = 24 sq ft

Step 3: Calculate the number of mosaic tiles required.
For every square foot, Mr. Boarden needs 24 mosaic tiles.
Number of mosaic tiles required = 24 tiles/sq ft × 24 sq ft = 576 mosaic tiles

Therefore, Mr. Boarden would need 576 mosaic tiles to cover two-thirds of his 36 sq ft bathroom.

Final answer: 576 mosaic tiles
