Okay, let's solve this problem step-by-step.

Given information:
- Brownies are sold for $3 per slice.
- Cheesecakes are sold for $4 per slice.
- Tommy sold 43 brownies.
- Tommy sold 23 slices of cheesecake.

To find the total amount of money Tommy raised, we need to calculate the revenue from selling brownies and the revenue from selling cheesecakes, then add them together.

Step 1: Calculate the revenue from selling brownies.
Revenue from brownies = Number of brownies sold × Price per brownie
Revenue from brownies = 43 × $3 = $129

Step 2: Calculate the revenue from selling cheesecakes.
Revenue from cheesecakes = Number of cheesecake slices sold × Price per cheesecake slice
Revenue from cheesecakes = 23 × $4 = $92

Step 3: Calculate the total amount of money Tommy raised.
Total money raised = Revenue from brownies + Revenue from cheesecakes
Total money raised = $129 + $92 = $
