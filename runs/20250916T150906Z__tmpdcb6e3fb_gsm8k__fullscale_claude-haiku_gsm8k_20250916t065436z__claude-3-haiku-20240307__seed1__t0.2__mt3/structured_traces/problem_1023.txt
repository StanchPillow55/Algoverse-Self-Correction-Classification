To solve this problem, we need to find the total number of sandwiches eaten by the family in one week.

Given information:
- The man eats 5 sandwiches per day.
- The wife eats 4 sandwiches per day.
- The son eats 2 sandwiches per day.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of sandwiches eaten by the family per day.
Sandwiches eaten by the man per day = 5
Sandwiches eaten by the wife per day = 4
Sandwiches eaten by the son per day = 2
Total sandwiches eaten per day = 5 + 4 + 2 = 11 sandwiches

Step 2: Calculate the total number of sandwiches eaten by the family in one week.
There are 7 days in a week.
Total sandwiches eaten in one week = Total sandwiches eaten per day × Number of days in a week
Total sandwiches eaten in one week = 11 sandwiches × 7 days = 77 sandwiches

Therefore, the family eats 77

Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. We have a family consisting of a man, his wife, and their son.
2. The man eats 5 sandwiches per day.
3. The wife eats 4 sandwiches per day.
4. The son eats 2 sandwiches per day.
5. We need to find how many sandwiches the family eats in one week.

To calculate this, we need to:
* Find the total number of sandwiches eaten per day.
* Multiply that by the number of days in a week.

Total sandwiches per day:
* Man: 5 sandwiches
* Wife: 4 sandwiches
* Son: 2 sandwiches
* Total per day: 5 + 4 + 2 = 11 sandwiches

Total sandwiches per week:
* 11 sandwiches per day x 7 days in a week = 77 sandwiches

Therefore, the family eats 77 sandwiches in one week.
