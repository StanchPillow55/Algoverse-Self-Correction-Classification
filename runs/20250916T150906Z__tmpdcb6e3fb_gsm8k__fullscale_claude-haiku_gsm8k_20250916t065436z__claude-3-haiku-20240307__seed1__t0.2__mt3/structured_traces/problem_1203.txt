To solve this problem, we need to find the height of the house and then calculate the height of the roof from the second floor's floor.

Given information:
- Mattison is 60 inches tall.
- The house is 7 times as high as Mattison.
- The floor to the ceiling on the first floor is 3 times as high as Mattison.

Step 1: Calculate the height of the house.
Height of the house = Mattison's height × 7
Height of the house = 60 inches × 7 = 420 inches

Step 2: Calculate the height of the first floor.
Height of the first floor = Mattison's height × 3
Height of the first floor = 60 inches × 3 = 180 inches

Step 3: Calculate the height of the second floor.
Height of the second floor = Height of the house - Height of the first floor
Height of the second floor = 420 inches - 180 inches = 240 inches

Step 4: Calculate the height of the roof from the second floor's floor.

Okay, let's break down this problem step by step and solve it completely.

Given information:
- Mattison is 60 inches tall.
- His two-story house is 7 times as high as he is.
- The floor to the ceiling on the first floor is thrice as high as he is.

Step 1: Calculate the height of the house.
Height of the house = 7 × Mattison's height
Height of the house = 7 × 60 inches = 420 inches

Step 2: Calculate the height of the first floor.
Height of the first floor = 3 × Mattison's height
Height of the first floor = 3 × 60 inches = 180 inches

Step 3: Calculate the height of the second floor.
Height of the house - Height of the first floor = Height of the second floor
420 inches - 180 inches = 240 inches

Therefore, the height of the roof from the second floor's floor is 240 inches.

Final answer: The height of the roof from the second floor's floor is 240 inches.
