To solve this problem, we need to find the number of Spanish books in the library.

Given information:
- There are 50 books in the library.
- Half of the books are written in English.
- 10% of the books are written in German.

Step 1: Find the number of books written in English.
Half of the books are written in English.
Number of books written in English = 50 × 1/2 = 25 books

Step 2: Find the number of books written in German.
10% of the books are written in German.
Number of books written in German = 50 × 0.10 = 5 books

Step 3: Find the number of books written in Spanish.
The remaining books are written in Spanish.
Number of books written in Spanish = Total books - Books written in English - Books written in German
Number of books written in Spanish = 50 - 25 - 5 = 20 books

Therefore, there are 20 Spanish books in the library.

Final answer: There are 20 Spanish books in the library.
