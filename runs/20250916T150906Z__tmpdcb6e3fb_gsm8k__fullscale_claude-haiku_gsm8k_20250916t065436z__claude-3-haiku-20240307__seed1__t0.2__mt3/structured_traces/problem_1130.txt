Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Nik has 200 crayons
- He wants to separate them into groups of 8 and put them into boxes
- Each box weighs 8 ounces
- Each crayon weighs 1 ounce
- There are 16 ounces in a pound

Step 1: Calculate the number of boxes Nik needs.
Number of crayons per box = 8
Total number of crayons = 200
Number of boxes needed = 200 ÷ 8 = 25 boxes

Step 2: Calculate the total weight of the crayons.
Weight of each crayon = 1 ounce
Total weight of crayons = 200 crayons × 1 ounce per crayon = 200 ounces

Step 3: Calculate the total weight of the boxes.
Weight of each box = 8 ounces
Total weight of boxes = 25 boxes × 8 ounces per box = 200 ounces

Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Nik has 200 crayons.
2. He wants to separate them into groups of 8 and put them into boxes.
3. Each box weighs 8 ounces.
4. Each crayon weighs 1 ounce.
5. There are 16 ounces in a pound.

First, we need to find out how many boxes Nik will need to hold all 200 crayons.
* 200 crayons / 8 crayons per box = 25 boxes

Now, we can calculate the total weight of the crayons:
* 200 crayons x 1 ounce per crayon = 200 ounces

Next, we can calculate the total weight of the boxes:
* 25 boxes x 8 ounces per box = 200 ounces

Finally, we can calculate the total weight in pounds:
* (200 ounces + 200 ounces) / 16 ounces per pound = 25
