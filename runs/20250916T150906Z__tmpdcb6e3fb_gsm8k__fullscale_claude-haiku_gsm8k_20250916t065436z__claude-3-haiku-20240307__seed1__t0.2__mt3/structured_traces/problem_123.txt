Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

Given information:
- Rosie can run 10 miles per hour for 3 hours.
- After that, she runs 5 miles per hour.
- We need to find how many miles she can run in 7 hours.

Step 1: Calculate the distance Rosie can run in the first 3 hours at 10 miles per hour.
Distance = Speed × Time
Distance = 10 miles/hour × 3 hours = 30 miles

Step 2: Calculate the remaining time Rosie has to run at 5 miles per hour.
Total time = 7 hours
Time already used = 3 hours
Remaining time = 7 hours - 3 hours = 4 hours

Step 3: Calculate the distance Rosie can run in the remaining 4 hours at 5 miles per hour.
Distance = Speed × Time
Distance = 5 miles/hour × 4 hours = 20 miles

Step 4: Calculate the total distance Rosie can run in 7 hours.

Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Rosie can run 10 miles per hour for 3 hours.
   * In the first 3 hours, she can run:
     * 10 miles/hour x 3 hours = 30 miles

2. After the first 3 hours, she runs 5 miles per hour.
   * For the remaining 4 hours (7 hours total - 3 hours), she can run:
     * 5 miles/hour x 4 hours = 20 miles

3. To find the total miles Rosie can run in 7 hours, we add the miles from the first 3 hours and the remaining 4 hours:
   * 30 miles + 20 miles = 50 miles

Therefore, Rosie can run a total of 50 miles in 7 hours.

Okay, let's break this down step-by-step:

1. Rosie can run 10 miles per hour for 3 hours.
   * In 3 hours, she can run 10 miles/hour * 3 hours = 30 miles.

2. After that, she runs 5 miles per hour.
   * She has 4 hours left (7 hours total - 3 hours).
   * In the remaining 4 hours, she can run 5 miles/hour * 4 hours = 20 miles.

3. To find the total miles she can run in 7 hours:
   * Total miles = Miles in first 3 hours + Miles in remaining 4 hours
   * Total miles = 30 miles + 20 miles = 50 miles

Therefore, Rosie can run a total of 50 miles in 7 hours.
