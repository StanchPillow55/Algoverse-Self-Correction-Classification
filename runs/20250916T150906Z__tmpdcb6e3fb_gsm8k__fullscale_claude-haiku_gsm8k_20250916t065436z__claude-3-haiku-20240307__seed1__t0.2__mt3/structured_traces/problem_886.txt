To solve this problem, we need to find the number of microphones that were arranged in pairs on the stage.

Given information:
- The singer has 50 microphones.
- 20% of the microphones won't find any space to fit in after arranging the rest in pairs.

Step 1: Calculate the number of microphones that won't find any space to fit in.
20% of 50 microphones = 0.20 Ã— 50 = 10 microphones

Step 2: Calculate the number of microphones that can be arranged in pairs.
Total microphones - Microphones that won't find any space = Microphones that can be arranged in pairs
50 microphones - 10 microphones = 40 microphones

Step 3: Calculate the number of pairs of microphones that can be arranged.
Microphones that can be arranged in pairs / 2 = Number of pairs
40 microphones / 2 = 20 pairs

Therefore, the singer was able to arrange 20 pairs of microphones on the stage.

Final answer: 20 pairs of microphones.
